00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
mr. president Senator Schumer came out
and said that the meeting from his point

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.610
of view and speaker Pelosi's was
contentious he also said you said in the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.920
meeting
this is him quoting you I just want to

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.920
check that the shutdown could go on for
months or even a year or longer did you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.560
say that? 
I did I did 
absolutely I said that, I don't think it will

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.140
but I am prepared and I think
I can speak for Republicans in the House

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.640
and Republicans in the Senate they feel
very strongly about having a safe

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.500
country having a border that makes sense
without borders I've said it many times

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.719
we don't have a country I hope it
doesn't go on even beyond a few more

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.460
days it really could open very quickly I
told them that bring who you want we

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.760
have three people you can ideally bring
three but you can bring six you can

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.030
bring nine you can bring twelve and
they're gonna be working over the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.870
weekend I think it may have been
somewhat contentious but I think it was

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.390
very productive I have to say that and I
think he said that too
