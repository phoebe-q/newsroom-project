00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.600
Whose bodies? Ours!

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.900 position:72%
This bill does a really good job of protecting

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.767 position:75%
the most vulnerable members of our human family.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.133 position:69%
We’re going to be shouting from the rooftops

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.833 position:78%
that abortion is still safe, legal and accessible.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:18.000 position:97%
Abortion is back on the agenda in America - and it’s got both sides energised.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.033 position:84%
In May, Alabama approved a near outright abortion ban,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.667 position:58%
including in cases of rape or incest.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.700 position:83%
And seven other states have passed “heartbeat bills”,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.000 position:91%
which ban abortion as soon as a heartbeat can be detected.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000 position:92%
So far this year, more than 20 other states have introduced

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.467 position:77%
or proposed some form of restriction on abortion.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.833 position:95%
There is a heartbeat, this is a thriving growing human person

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.833 position:97%
and we need to acknowledge that and protect that life as well.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:51.267 position:98%
I work at an abortion clinic escort in Huntsville, Alabama, and what we’ve seen

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:58.800 position:98%
since these heartbeat bills and this legislation has started being passed across the US

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.533 position:61%
we’ve seen the activism and the threats

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:07.367 position:84%
from the anti-choice movement on the sidewalk ramp up.

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:15.834 position:98%
This is part of a comprehensive and rather clever campaign by pro-life advocates.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.739 position:95%
They have passed laws of different types in different states.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:25.467 position:97%
Good evening, in a landmark ruling the Supreme Court today legalised abortion.

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:30.867 position:97%
The aim is to challenge Roe vs Wade, the 1973 ruling by the US Supreme Court

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.533
that legalised abortion.

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:41.167 position:97%
The procedure has been allowed only until viability - that is, the point at which a foetus

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:47.333 position:97%
is able to live outside the womb, generally between 24 and 28 weeks.

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.467 position:88%
In recent years, some states have tried to ban abortions

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:54.467 position:78%
in the second trimester - that’s before viability.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:59.667 position:97%
The heartbeat bills passed in 2019 would prohibit abortions around the six-week mark

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:03.000 position:72%
before most women even know they are pregnant.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.667 position:97%
And the Alabama law now goes to the very beginning of a pregnancy,

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.633 position:95%
effectively banning abortion from just days after conception.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:14.967 position:97%
This one is different because it is a frontal attack on Roe vs Wade.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:18.767 position:98%
It is clearly unconstitutional under the Supreme Court precedent.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.233 position:83%
Gorsuch: As Associate Justice at the Supreme Court...

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:30.100 position:98%
President Trump appointed two strongly anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.833 position:56%
giving conservatives a 5-4 majority.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:35.567 position:75%
But it’s likely to be Chief Justice John Roberts

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.400 position:75%
who decides whether to take up the Alabama case.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:43.467 position:97%
So the concern for pro-choice advocates in the country really is two-fold.

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:47.472 position:98%
This is a direct assault but it may not be the most serious threat.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:51.809 position:97%
John Roberts could reject this, could even block it from being heard

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:56.213 position:97%
but they could still grant review in these collateral attacks,

00:02:56.218 --> 00:03:01.184 position:97%
chipping away making it more difficult to get an abortion in various states.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.323 position:64%
Roberts could very well sign off on that.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.467 position:75%
That would not make abortion illegal everywhere.

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:11.567 position:97%
It would leave it up to each state to decide when and how a woman could get an abortion.
