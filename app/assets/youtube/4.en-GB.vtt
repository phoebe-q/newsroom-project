00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Lack of moral principle.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.440
Keep Europe for Europeans.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.960
If female Dalai Lama comes,
then she should be more attractive.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.880
His emotions also, little bit...

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.040
too complicated.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.120
What do you mean by that?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.720
What do you think of him in office?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.880 position:59%
One day he says something, another day

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.040
he says something,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.200 position:75%
but I think [there's a] lack of moral principle.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.800
When he become president

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.840
he expressed: 'America first.'

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.200
That is wrong.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.720
America, they should take
the global responsibility.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.760 position:89%
I am one admirer of [the] spirit of [the] European Union.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.600
I'm outsider

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.320 position:67%
but I feel better [to] remain in the union.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.000 position:63%
The campaign to leave the European Union

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200 position:64%
used one of your quotes in their posters.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.720 position:98%
It said: 'The goal should be that migrants return and help rebuild their countries.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.200
You have to be practical.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200 position:59%
It's impossible for everyone to come.'

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.560
The European countries

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.680
should take these refugees

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.400
and give them education

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.440
and training

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.320 position:72%
and then aiming is - return to their own land.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.760 position:67%
And if these people want to stay in Europe,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.000
shouldn't they be allowed to?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.920
Limited number... OK.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.800
But whole Europe

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.480
eventually become Muslim country?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.120
Impossible.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.720 position:56%
Or African country. Also impossible.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.120 position:66%
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.640
I mean, you're a refugee yourself.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.520
They themselves, I think
better to their own land.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.600
Better.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.160
Keep Europe for Europeans.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.840 position:63%
Have you given up the hope of returning?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.920
No, no, no.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.440
Tibetan people very much
showed their trust in me,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.640
so they are very, very eager.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.720
Many old people,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
with tears, they ask me:

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.400
'Please come to Tibet.'

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.360
So how would that happen,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.600
Your Holiness?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.320
Now, China is changing.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.400
So you have had contact

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.920
Yes.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.280 position:78%
in the last few years with Chinese officials? Who?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.000
Entirely

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.360
privately.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.120
Number of Chinese retired officials

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.040
and some scholars

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.640
who have some connections
with Chinese government.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Has President Xi
ever asked you for a meeting?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.880
Not yet.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.800 position:59%
Do you think China's growing influence

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640
is having an impact on your own
influence and the cause of Tibet?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.000
I don't care.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.920
No.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.880 position:66%
I think the Chinese themselves is changing

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.160
their attitude.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.520
You once said

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.160
that you would be open to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.640
a female successor.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.840
That's also possible.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.560
You also told one of my colleagues

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.000 position:58%
that: 'That female must be attractive

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.480
otherwise it's not much use.'

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.360
Yes.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.560
Can you see why that
comment upset a lot of women?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.320
That is one time.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.840
If female Dalai Lama comes,
then she should be more attractive.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.520
If female Dalai Lama...

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.280
Oh, oh...

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.120 position:64%
That people, I think prefer, not see her,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.400
that face.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.560
A lot of women would say
that's objectifying women

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.880 position:67%
and it's about who you are inside isn't it?

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.960
Yes, I think both.
