00:29:05.918 --> 00:29:11.463
&gt;&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WANT 
ME TO BE A NOMINEE. 

00:29:11.464 --> 00:29:13.464
&gt;&gt; WE NEED A MASS 

00:29:16.247 --> 00:29:18.240
POLITICAL MOVEMENT. 
&gt;&gt; NOT JUST TO GO TO WASHINGTON 

00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:19.617
BUT CHANGE IT BEFORE IT'S TOO 
LATE. 

00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:22.789
&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT'S BROKEN IN THIS 
COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT. 

00:29:22.982 --> 00:29:24.976
&gt;&gt; THE STAKES COULD NOT BE 
HIGHER. 

00:29:24.977 --> 00:29:26.977
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO OUT EAT THEM 

00:29:30.461 --> 00:29:32.121
AND WIN. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF 

00:29:32.122 --> 00:29:34.927
WINNING IN RED, LIKE BLUE AND 
PURPLE AREAS. 

00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:47.534
&gt;&gt;&gt; TONIGHT IOWANS WILL BE THE 
FIRST IN 

00:29:52.534 --> 00:29:56.119
THE NATION ON WHO COULD BE THE 
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:58.288
STATES. IT'S CAUCUS NIGHT AND 
ALL ACROSS GENTOO PEOPLE ARE 

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:00.289
GATHERING TO PICK THEIR FAVORITE
CANDIDATE. THE QUESTION IS WHICH

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:04.589
CONTENDERS WILL LEAVE HERE WITH 
MOMENTUM AND SUPPORT. YOU ARE 

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.790
LOOKING LIVE AT TWO CAUCUS 
VENUES WE WILL FOLLOW CLOSELY. 

00:30:06.883 --> 00:30:09.663
ONE AT DRAKE UNIVERSITY AND THE 
OTHER IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE

00:30:09.863 --> 00:30:11.863
STATE IN 

00:30:14.131 --> 00:30:16.131
COUNCIL BLUFFS. GOOD EVENING I'M
LIBBY CASEY. YOU ARE WATCHING 

00:30:16.229 --> 00:30:19.009
LIVE COVERAGE OF THE IOWA CAUCUS
FROM " THE WASHINGTON POST " . 

00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:22.061
WE ARE HERE AT THE IOWA EVENTS 
CENTER HOME BASE FOR MUCH OF THE

00:30:22.262 --> 00:30:24.696
MEDIA. JOINING ME THIS EVENING 
ARE JAMES HOMAN NATIONAL 

00:30:25.514 --> 00:30:29.164
POLITICAL REPORTER, EUGENE SCOTT
POLITICAL REPORTER AND JIM 

00:30:29.363 --> 00:30:32.826
McCORMICK PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL
SCIENCE AT IOWA 

00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:38.565
STATE UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU TO 
ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:41.360
EUGENE, WHAT IS ON THE LINE FOR 
TONIGHT FOR THE CANDIDATES AND 

00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:43.561
THOSE WHO 

00:30:46.775 --> 00:30:48.775
WILL CAUCUS? 
&gt;&gt;

00:30:50.497 --> 00:30:52.531
FOR THE CANDIDATES IT DEPENDS ON
WHICH CANDIDATE YOU ARE TALKING 

00:30:52.731 --> 00:30:54.764
ABOUT. THERE ARE SOME CANDIDATES
WHO ARE NOT PERFORMING AS WELL 

00:30:54.969 --> 00:30:57.284
AS OTHERS. FOR THEM, THEY NEED A
STRONG SHOWING TONIGHT TO PROVE 

00:30:57.483 --> 00:30:59.852
TO VOTERS OUTSIDE OF IOWA THEY 
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE THEIR 

00:31:00.047 --> 00:31:02.282
PARTY'S NOMINEE  AND TO GO UP 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. IN TERMS 

00:31:02.484 --> 00:31:04.484
OF VOTERS ONE OF THE MAIN 
CONVERSATIONS FROM THIS ELECTION

00:31:04.504 --> 00:31:06.504
CYCLE HAS BEEN 

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.238
ABOUT WHETHER IOWA SHOULD REMAIN
THE FIRST CONTENTS. FOR A FEW 

00:31:10.432 --> 00:31:12.432
REASONS.  THERE ARE QUESTIONS 

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:16.291
ABOUT THE DIVERSIFYING COUNTRY 
AND ESPECIALLY THE DIVERSIFYING 

00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:18.816
PARTY ON THE LEFT AND WHETHER OR
NOT IOWA  CAN ACCURATELY SHOULD 

00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:25.455
WE SAY,. A NOMINEE OR INFLUENCE 
A NOMINEE TO THE DEGREE IT 

00:31:25.649 --> 00:31:28.791
CURRENTLY DOES. I THINK WE ARE 
SEEING VOTERS HERE FIGHTING TO 

00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:32.953
MAKE A CASE THAT THEIR VOICES 
NOT ONLY SHOULD BE HEARD BUT 

00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:37.013
SHOULD REMAIN ONE OF THE FIRST 
VOICES. 

00:31:37.014 --> 00:31:38.399
&gt;&gt; JAMES WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING 
FOR? 

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.090
&gt;&gt; AFTER ONE YEAR, THE FIELD IS 
WINDOWED AND IOWA HAS PLAYED THE

00:31:42.296 --> 00:31:44.534
ROLE OF WINNOWING THE FIELD . 
YOU THINK OF ALL THE CANDIDATES 

00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:46.734
WE 

00:31:47.771 --> 00:31:49.771
STARTED WITH, THE HISTORICALLY 
DIVERSE FIELD AND HOW THERE ARE 

00:31:49.893 --> 00:31:52.239
FIVE, SIX COMPETITIVE CANDIDATES
TONIGHT. IT WILL WINNOW MORE. WE

00:31:52.454 --> 00:31:54.454
THINK A LOT OF LANES AND 

00:31:57.928 --> 00:32:00.439
I THINK TONIGHT WE WILL KNOW WHO
IS THE DOMINANT FIGURE IN THE 

00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:03.424
ESTABLISHMENT LANE, THE MODERATE
LANE FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER 

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:07.278
WORD IN THE LIBERAL LANE. THE 
BIG THING TO WATCH IS 

00:32:11.547 --> 00:32:13.547
BERNIE SANDERS. HIS MOMENTUM AND
HE'S PERCEIVED AS STRONG WITHIN 

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.219
AN ORGANIZATION. CAN HE DELIVER 
THAT? HOW DOES HIS PERFORMANCE 

00:32:16.424 --> 00:32:20.073
TONIGHT COMPARED TO FOUR YEARS 
AGO. HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY HAVE

00:32:20.283 --> 00:32:22.283
MORE PEOPLE 

00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:26.230
COMMITTED TO CAUCUS FOR HIM THAN
2016 WHEN IT WAS A TWO-WAY RACE.

00:32:26.426 --> 00:32:30.838
A LOT OF US  WILL BE ON SANDERS 
AND HOW HE DEALS, IF HE DOES 

00:32:32.872 --> 00:32:35.183
WELL WITH BEING A FRONT RUNNER 
WHICH HE'S NEVER HAD TO DEAL 

00:32:35.377 --> 00:32:38.157
WITH BEFORE. 
&gt;&gt; I EXPECT HAITIANS CREATE 

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:40.792
THEIR OWN THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO 
DO AND THEY CREATES 

00:32:45.806 --> 00:32:47.806
CHALLENGES. PROFESSOR, THE 
UNIQUENESS OF THE IOWA CAUCUSES 

00:32:47.896 --> 00:32:50.147
SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENS 
IN THE REST OF THE NATION. 

00:32:50.148 --> 00:32:52.579
&gt;&gt; IT REALLY IS. THE REAL 
DIFFERENCES THAT INSTEAD OF JUST

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.818
GOING INTO A VOTING BOOTH 
CASTING A BALLOT AND GOING HOME,

00:32:56.032 --> 00:33:01.517
THIS IS A COMMUNITY MEETING. YOU
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE 

00:33:01.723 --> 00:33:05.571
CANDIDATES AND THERE WILL BE A 
DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESS THIS 

00:33:05.784 --> 00:33:07.706
EVENING. YOU WILL HAVE THREE 
DIFFERENT VOTES. IT'S REALLY 

00:33:07.707 --> 00:33:09.707
UNUSUAL 

00:33:11.058 --> 00:33:13.095
BECAUSE THE CAUCUSES HAVE NEVER 
HAD THAT BEFORE. I THINK IT 

00:33:13.298 --> 00:33:15.538
REALLY DOES BRING OUT SORT OF 
THE GRASSROOTS NATURE  OF WHAT 

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.373
IOWANS ARE ABOUT AND WHAT THEY 
REALLY WANT THE CAUCUSES TO BE. 

00:33:18.577 --> 00:33:22.845
I AM REALLY LOOKING FOR WHAT 
KIND OF TURNOUT WE HAVE TONIGHT.

00:33:23.045 --> 00:33:25.045
THIS IS A 

00:33:27.112 --> 00:33:29.009
DIFFERENT PROCESS. THERE IS A 
LOT OF CANDIDATES. FRANKLY, 

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.181
THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE AS JAMES 
WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. THE 

00:33:32.382 --> 00:33:36.649
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AND AMONG 
THE CANDIDATES IN TERMS OF WHERE

00:33:36.856 --> 00:33:39.356
THEY WANT TO TAKE THE DIRECTION 
OF THE COUNTRY. I THINK THAT'S A

00:33:39.556 --> 00:33:41.556
KEY THAT WE WILL BE FOCUSING 

00:33:45.388 --> 00:33:46.797
ON TONIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; IN A TRADITIONAL PRIMARY 

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:49.117
POLLS WOULD BE CLOSING DOWN AND 
WE WOULD GET RESULTS SOON AFTER 

00:33:49.323 --> 00:33:51.521
THAT IN THE CAUCUS IS JUST 
BEGINNING OF THIS HOUR  AND 

00:33:51.723 --> 00:33:53.723
SINCE IT REALLY IS A FLUID 
PROCESS OF DEBATE 

00:33:57.573 --> 00:33:59.676
AND DISCUSSION AND COULD HAVE 
MORE THAN ONE ROUND. WE WON'T 

00:33:59.877 --> 00:34:02.261
GET ANY RESULTS FOR A WHILE. WE 
KNOW THE RACE BETWEEN THE TOP 

00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:04.459
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IS TIGHT 
AND IT SHIFTED. LET'S LOOK AT 

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.253
THAT. THIS IS THE WAPELLO 
POLLING AVERAGES OF RECENT POLLS

00:34:09.453 --> 00:34:14.839
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. BIDEN HAS
BEEN 22% SANDERS AT 20% ,  

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:21.344
BUTTIGIEG 18% , WARREN 15% AND 
KLOBUCHAR AT 9%. NEXT TUESDAY IS

00:34:21.543 --> 00:34:24.381
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY AND 
HERE ARE THE " THE WASHINGTON 

00:34:24.594 --> 00:34:30.781
POST "  SANDERS HAS BEEN LEADING

00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:37.797

14%  WARREN AT 13 AND CLOSE ARE 

00:34:38.005 --> 00:34:41.328

THE FIRST RESULTS DOWN THE PIPE.
WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR WAYS 

00:35:03.063 --> 00:35:05.063
WE CAN BRING YOU 

00:35:07.648 --> 00:35:09.692
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT, MAYBE A PEEK
BEHIND THE CURTAIN WHERE WE CAN 

00:35:09.889 --> 00:35:11.889
SHOW YOU INTERESTING THINGS THAT
MAYBE WOULD NOT BE SO 

00:35:12.116 --> 00:35:14.116
IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS IN THOSE 
RESULTS. I'M NOT DOING THIS BY 

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:19.031

DAVID BYLER AN OPINION COLUMNIST

00:35:26.761 --> 00:35:32.734
WHO ALL UPSETS. WE KNOW FROM 
HISTORICAL DATA CANDIDATES WHO 

00:35:32.935 --> 00:35:34.935
OUTPERFORMED THEIR POLES OR 
EXPECTATIONS THAT A BEEN SET 

00:35:35.072 --> 00:35:37.072
TEND TO GET A BOOST IN LATER 
STATES LIKE 

00:35:40.356 --> 00:35:44.822
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND OTHERS DOWN 
THE CALENDAR. I'M LOOKING FOR 

00:35:45.118 --> 00:35:47.328
CANDIDATES WHO HAVE PUT A LOT ON
THIS RACE I'M THINKING AMY 

00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:50.475
KLOBUCHAR BEATING BUTTIGIEG THE 
CANDIDATE WHO WANTS TO DO WELL 

00:35:50.507 --> 00:35:54.575
IN IOWA  BUT DOESN'T DO AS WELL 
NATIONALLY AS THEY DO IN THE 

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.045
STATE. FINALLY, I'M LOOKING AT 
THE LOWER TIER CANDIDATES. IT'S 

00:35:59.253 --> 00:36:01.085
EASY TO FORGET THERE ARE 
CANDIDATES THROUGH ARE STILLNESS

00:36:01.086 --> 00:36:04.126
RACE. IOWA IS THE KEY STATE  
THAT WINDOWS THE FIELD AGAINST 

00:36:05.545 --> 00:36:07.257
THE FINALISTS. 
&gt;&gt; SPEAKING OF THE FINALISTS WE 

00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:10.214

NOMINATION BUT IN THE MEANTIME 

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.872

2020 AND IT COMES TO THIS 
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. 

00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:55.721
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THE 
DIFFERENCE IN 2016 

00:37:00.734 --> 00:37:04.459
IS THAT IT ONLY HAD TWO 
CANDIDATES COMPETING IT WAS 

00:37:04.661 --> 00:37:06.661
BERNIE SANDERS VERSUS HILLARY 
CLINTON. I'M GOING TO LOOK OUT 

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:08.710
FOR HOW MANY SUPPORTERS BERNIE 
SANDERS CAN RETAIN AND WE ARE 

00:37:08.932 --> 00:37:10.356
HILLARY CLINTON VOTERS MY GOAL 
THIS YEAR. 

00:37:10.357 --> 00:37:14.204
&gt;&gt; THAT'S INTERESTING THE THING 
WE ARE WATCHING OF THOSE LANES. 

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:16.409
WHERE THE PROGRESSIVE VOTERS 
GOING AND WHERE ARE THE 

00:37:20.898 --> 00:37:23.216
ESTABLISHMENTS GOING. WE HAVE 
ALL OF THAT UP YEAR ON THE BOARD

AVAILABLE. FOR NOW, WE WILL TOSS

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.028
IT BACK TO LIBBY IN IOWA. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU JEREMY. HOW MUCH 

00:37:28.232 --> 00:37:32.764
COMPLICATED IS IT TO CRUNCH THE 
NUMBERS ON A PRIMARY NIGHT? 

00:37:32.765 --> 00:37:34.755
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GETTING THREE 
DIFFERENT SETS OF RESULTS WHICH 

00:37:34.756 --> 00:37:37.969
IS MAKING OUR JOB MORE 
DIFFICULT. WE ARE GETTING THESE 

00:37:38.179 --> 00:37:42.566
FIRST ALIGNMENT NUMBERS THAT 
FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. 

00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:45.010
THE INITIAL VOTES THAT SHOW UP 
WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO A PRIMARY 

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.230
LOCATION. WE HAVE 

00:37:48.738 --> 00:37:50.802
SECOND ALIGNMENT RESULTS WHICH 
ARE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE HAVE A

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.715
LIABILITY STANDARDS. FINALLY, WE
GET THE STATE DELEGATES 

00:37:52.716 --> 00:37:54.541
EQUIVALENTS THAT WILL TURN INTO 
DELEGATES LATER THIS IS 

00:37:54.542 --> 00:37:56.542
DIFFICULT 

00:37:59.428 --> 00:38:01.847
FOR US THAT IT MAKES ELECTION 
NERDS LIKE ME HAPPY BECAUSE IT 

00:38:02.044 --> 00:38:04.380
MEANS WE HAVE EXTRA STUFF TO 
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT. WE WILL TAKE 

00:38:04.592 --> 00:38:06.683
IT BACK TO YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU JEREMY. I LOVE YOU 

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:09.100
DOING THAT. WE GET TO SEE HOW 
THE SAUSAGE IS MADE. THESE 

00:38:09.299 --> 00:38:13.426
PEOPLE DO THIS WORK AT " THE 
WASHINGTON POST " AND WE DIRECT 

00:38:13.626 --> 00:38:16.056
THEM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS AND
THEY WILL SHOW US EVERYTHING , 

00:38:16.266 --> 00:38:18.706
IN ALL OF ITS GLORY.  IS YOU'VE 
TRAVELED AROUND IOWA , HOW 

00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:22.468
HEAVILY ARE THEY WEIGHING THE 
RESPONSIBLE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO 

00:38:22.674 --> 00:38:25.978
BE FIRST? BOX SIGNIFICANTLY AND 
I THINK WE'VE SEEN SOME 

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.161
REPORTING IN DIFFERENT ARTICLES 
IN THE POST THERE IS AN 

00:38:30.376 --> 00:38:35.650
AWARENESS THERE ARE ISSUES THAT 
VOTERS CARE ABOUT, THAT PERHAPS 

00:38:35.952 --> 00:38:38.706
AREN'T INCREDIBLY WELL 
REPRESENTED POPULATION -WISE IN 

00:38:38.907 --> 00:38:46.312
IOWA. FOR EXAMPLE,  I REMEMBER 
GOING TO A PETE BUTTIGIEG  EVENT

00:38:46.518 --> 00:38:48.518
AND A WHITE VOTER, WHITE MALE 

00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:53.291
ASKED ABOUT BLACK WOMEN 
MORTALITY ISSUES RELATED TO 

00:38:54.539 --> 00:38:56.539
MATERNITY, RIGHT. WE DO HAVE 
DATA SHOWING THAT BLACK WOMEN 

00:38:57.189 --> 00:39:00.839
FACE HIGHER CASES OF DANGER AND 
HEALTH ISSUES AND BIRTHING AND 

00:39:01.656 --> 00:39:06.853
DELIVERY PROCESS, WHITE WOMEN 
OVERALL. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT 

00:39:07.048 --> 00:39:09.048
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN 
THEY LOOK AT HEALTHCARE MORE 

00:39:09.172 --> 00:39:12.013
BROADLY. I'VE SEEN OLDER VOTERS 
ASK ABOUT THE STUDENT DEBT 

00:39:12.213 --> 00:39:18.315
CRISIS. OTHER THINGS QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE WAR AND THE IDEAS 

00:39:18.625 --> 00:39:20.952
OTHER FEARS OF WAR AND HOW COULD
THAT AFFECT AMERICANS IN OTHER 

00:39:21.155 --> 00:39:23.155
PARTS OF 

00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:26.646
THE COUNTRY. THERE IS A REAL 
SENSE THERE ARE A LOT OF 

00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:28.777
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TO HAVE 
CONCERNS REPRESENTING BROUGHT TO

00:39:28.778 --> 00:39:32.738
THE TABLE AND IOWA AND VOTERS 
ARE DOING THAT. 

00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:37.009
&gt;&gt; CONFESSOR, LEAVE HER TO 
CRITIQUE OF IOWA  IS WHITE AND 

00:39:37.216 --> 00:39:39.216
OLDER STATE EVEN THE PRESIDENT 
CANDIDATES LIKE JULIAN CASTRO 

00:39:39.327 --> 00:39:41.065
RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT IOWA 
GETTING THIS FIRST CRACK. 

00:39:41.066 --> 00:39:45.539
&gt;&gt; HE DID HE SAID MAYBE THEY 
SHOULDN'T HAVE THE FIRST NATION 

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:50.486
CAUCUS SET IN HERE BUT I THINK 
WE'VE JUST HEARD HEAR WHAT 

00:39:50.682 --> 00:39:54.066
EUGENE WAS TALKING ABOUT, THE 
KIND OF CONCERN THAT IOWANS HAVE

00:39:54.272 --> 00:39:57.719
THEY ARE VERY EDUCATED 
POPULATION. THEY ARE VERY 

00:39:57.926 --> 00:39:59.926
INTERESTED IN 

00:40:01.988 --> 00:40:03.988
NATIONAL POLITICS AND I THINK 
WHAT OF COURSE THE CAUCUSES 

00:40:04.124 --> 00:40:06.363
BRING OUT ARE THE ACTIVISTS 
WITHIN THE PARTY. THEY ARE VERY 

00:40:06.569 --> 00:40:09.301
MUCH ALERT TO NOT ONLY THE LOCAL
ISSUES AND AGRICULTURE, 

00:40:09.503 --> 00:40:14.073
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE TOP AND THE
TRADE ISSUE, IN TERMS OF THE 

00:40:16.408 --> 00:40:19.473
USMCA OR THE FIRST PHASE OF THE 
CHINA AGREEMENT A REALLY SORT OF

00:40:19.676 --> 00:40:22.698
NUMBER ONE ISSUES BUT ALSO 
IOWANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 

00:40:26.764 --> 00:40:29.128
CLIMATE CHANGE. JUST WITHIN THIS
PAST YEAR WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL 

00:40:29.338 --> 00:40:31.360
OF FLOODING IN WESTERN IOWA. WE 
HAVE HAD OVER THE DECADES 

00:40:31.559 --> 00:40:34.684
REALLY, SERIOUS FLOODING. OF 
COURSE THAT IS RELATED TO 

00:40:34.891 --> 00:40:38.868
CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK IOWANS 
ARE ALERT TO THESE ISSUES. THEY 

00:40:39.066 --> 00:40:41.066
ARE ATTENTIVE 

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.859
AND EDUCATED. IN THAT SENSE, I 
THINK THAT THEY CAN REALLY SPEAK

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:48.661
TO SOME OF THE ISSUES AT THE 
NATIONAL LEVEL. IT IS NOT JUST 

00:40:48.861 --> 00:40:54.187
KIND OF INSULAR, FLYOVER STATE 
THAT WE SOMETIMES HEAR. THEY ARE

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.822
REALLY ENGAGED. I THINK THAT 
MAKES THE CAUCUSES IN THE 

00:40:57.032 --> 00:40:59.032
PROCESS DIFFERENT . 

00:41:02.106 --> 00:41:04.234
EFFECT THAT THEY CAN CHALLENGE 
SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES AS YOU 

00:41:04.436 --> 00:41:06.436
ARE JUST SAYING WITH SOME OF 
THESE ISSUES, MAYBE THESE 

00:41:11.183 --> 00:41:13.761
CANDIDATES HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
THESE ISSUES AND NOW THERE PUT 

00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:16.575
ON THE SPOT TO COME BACK WITH A 
RESPONSE. I THINK THAT IS THE 

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.770
MERIT OF THIS PROCESS. 
&gt;&gt; ITSELF OR FOR THE CANDIDATES,

00:41:18.813 --> 00:41:22.929
IF THEY DON'T GET ASKED THESE 
QUESTIONS NOW AND WORK OUT THEIR

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.133
ANSWERS THEY WILL GET THEM IN 
NEVADA AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND 

00:41:26.282 --> 00:41:28.712
FURTHER ON. IT'S A GREAT PLACE 
TO WORKSHOP YOUR ANSWERS. 

00:41:28.713 --> 00:41:33.092
&gt;&gt; LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO 
OUTLINE WHAT WILL BE A VERY BUSY

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.830
FEW WEEKS IN THE 2020 RACE. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTESTS 

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.030
LEADING UP TO NOW WHAT 

00:41:40.096 --> 00:41:41.940
IS MASSIVE SUPER TUESDAY 
TONIGHT'S IOWA CAUCUS 41 PLEDGE 

00:41:41.941 --> 00:41:45.379
DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS. NEXT
TUESDAY, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE 

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.848
PRIMARY HAS ANOTHER 24 DELEGATES
AT STAKE. AFTER THAT IS NEVADA'S

00:41:50.048 --> 00:41:52.048
CAUCUS SATURDAY, 

00:41:54.305 --> 00:41:56.305
FEBRUARY 22, 36 DELEGATES THERE.
SOUTH CAROLINA'S PRIMARY IS THE 

00:41:56.422 --> 00:42:00.425
FOLLOWING SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 29.
54 DELEGATES AVAILABLE ALL THIS 

00:42:00.886 --> 00:42:03.117
TO EMPHASIZE HOW BIG SUPER 
TUESDAY WILL BE THIS YEAR ON 

00:42:03.316 --> 00:42:05.316
MARCH 3 AND THAT ONE 

00:42:08.124 --> 00:42:10.124
DAY, 1357 DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES 
WILL BE UP FOR GRABS. THAT'S 

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.828
ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL THE 
DELEGATES. KEEP IN MIND THE 

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:17.472
CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO REACH A
MAGIC NUMBER OF 1990 DELEGATES 

00:42:17.673 --> 00:42:20.109
TO SECURE THE NOMINATION IN 
THEIR CONVENTION IN MILWAUKEE IN

00:42:22.746 --> 00:42:25.795
JULY. JAMES, THIS QUESTION OF 
JUST HOW IOWA WILL INFLUENCE 

00:42:25.995 --> 00:42:30.377
THINGS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE 
LOOKED AT THE DELEGATE COUNT. 

00:42:30.593 --> 00:42:32.697
I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU, THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DELEGATE 

00:42:32.918 --> 00:42:36.364
COUNT BUT THE INFLUENCE THAT 
JUST GOING FORWARD HAS AND HOW 

00:42:36.571 --> 00:42:38.571
IT WILL SET 

00:42:40.218 --> 00:42:41.953
THE TONE. 
&gt;&gt; IT ABSOLUTELY SETS THE TONE. 

00:42:41.954 --> 00:42:43.954
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IOWANS 
GET THAT PICTURE WHAT EUGENE WAS

00:42:47.739 --> 00:42:49.739
TALKING ABOUT AND THEY WERE 
ASKING BUTTIGIEG ABOUT HE IS 

00:42:49.769 --> 00:42:51.703
STRUGGLING WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN
VOTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA . ONE 

00:42:51.704 --> 00:42:54.029
OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN THIS 
IS MY FOURTH IOWA CAUCUS. 

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:59.509
COMPARED TO THE OTHER THREE, 
ELECTABILITY IS THE FIXATION OF 

00:42:59.717 --> 00:43:03.988
VOTERS ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL 
SPECTRUM. PEOPLE ARE SO SHOCKED 

00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:08.457
BY DONALD TRUMP'S VICTORY IN 
2016 AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE ON 

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.309
THE LEFT THEY WERE SO TAKEN 
ABACK BY IT THAT THEY WANT TO BE

00:43:11.503 --> 00:43:13.503
TRUMP. THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE 
HIM. 

00:43:16.989 --> 00:43:19.073
THEY WANT LIBERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE
WILLING TO SUPPORT THE CANDIDATE

00:43:19.269 --> 00:43:21.269
THEY VIEW AS 

00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:26.378
MOST DELECTABLE
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT JUST THINKING 

00:43:26.379 --> 00:43:28.411
ABOUT HOW THEIR FELLOW IOWANS 
WILL VOTE BUT THE NATION. 

00:43:28.412 --> 00:43:32.240
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHO CAN DO 

00:43:32.441 --> 00:43:34.266
SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE 
NOT JUST ACROSS THE SUPER 

00:43:34.267 --> 00:43:36.796
TUESDAY STATES. IT'S BEEN 
FASCINATING BECAUSE ALL 

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.243
THE CANDIDATES IN THE CLOSING 
DAYS ARE PUT EMPHASIS ON WHY 

00:43:44.442 --> 00:43:46.560
THEY CAN WIN AND WHY THEY ARE 
MOST DELECTABLE. SOME ARGUMENTS 

00:43:46.766 --> 00:43:49.902
ARE MORE DUBIOUS BUT THEY ALL 
MAKE THE CASE. IT'S BECAUSE 

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.347
THESE IOWA CAUCUS GOERS MANY OF 
WHOM HAVE REMAINED ON DECIDED 

00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:57.719
ARE HOLDING UP BECAUSE THEY'RE 
TRYING TO DECIDE WHO'S THE MOST 

00:43:57.918 --> 00:44:01.480
DELECTABLE. I SPOKE TO A WOMAN 
YESTERDAY, A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER

00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:07.353
IN OSCEOLA. SHE CAUCUSED FOR 
BERNIE SANDERS LAST TIME. THIS 

00:44:07.657 --> 00:44:10.605
TIME SHE NARROWED IT DOWN TO 
FOUR AND THEN TWO. YESTERDAY SHE

00:44:10.807 --> 00:44:14.878
WATCHED A PETE BUTTIGIEG AND  
ELIZABETH WARREN RALLY AND 

00:44:15.077 --> 00:44:18.950
DECIDED TO SUPPORT ELIZABETH 
WARREN  SHE THINKS SHE CAN 

00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:22.611
WINDOW. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
WARREN BEING THE FIRST WOMAN 

00:44:22.812 --> 00:44:25.644
PRESIDENT IN HER PLANT SHE 
WEIGHED ALL OF 

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.816
THIS STUFF AND IT'S A REFLECTION
OF HOW SHE TAKE THIS 

00:44:31.019 --> 00:44:33.362
RESPONSIBILITY AS A VOTER. THERE
ARE PEOPLE, AT THE WARREN 

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:37.233
RALEIGH I TALKED TO SOMEONE WHO 
I SAID ELIZABETH WARREN SHE'S MY

00:44:37.828 --> 00:44:44.121
FIFTH CHOICE. AND SO YOU'VE RUN 
INTO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THEY'VE 

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:49.411
GOT ASK QUESTIONS NOW. NOT JUST 
BECAUSE THEY WILL COME UP LATER 

00:44:49.614 --> 00:44:51.614
BUT ALSO BECAUSE CANDIDATES 

00:44:53.265 --> 00:44:55.210
AREN'T ACCESSIBLE. THIS IS THE 
MOST ACCESSIBLE THE CANDIDATES 

00:44:55.211 --> 00:44:57.756
WILL BE TO REAL PEOPLE. ONCE YOU
HAVE SUPER TUESDAY WHERE HALF 

00:44:57.958 --> 00:45:02.199
THE DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS, 
YOU ARE JUST RUNNING TELEVISION 

00:45:02.402 --> 00:45:05.049
ADS. HERE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH
THE VOTERS IN ANSWER QUESTIONS. 

00:45:05.254 --> 00:45:08.699
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE REPORTERS ACROSS IOWA
TONIGHT AND SOME OF THOSE CAUCUS

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.353
SITES WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON. 
JUST A COUPLE MILES DOWN THE 

00:45:12.566 --> 00:45:15.298
ROAD HANNA JEWELL IS AT DRAKE 
UNIVERSITY WHICH IS A HUB FOR 

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.087
POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT I'M 

00:45:20.293 --> 00:45:24.337
HERE AT DRAKE UNIVERSITY IN A 
PRECINCT WHICH INCLUDES HOUSING 

00:45:24.637 --> 00:45:29.016
FOR DRAKE UNIVERSITY IN A BERING
STRAITS. A CAUCUS CAN BE A FEW 

00:45:29.217 --> 00:45:33.289
PEOPLE IN THE LIVING ROOM BUT AS
I CAN SEE THAT'S NOT THE CASE. 

00:45:33.489 --> 00:45:35.489
THERE ARE HUNDREDS HERE IN THE 
ENERGY IS HIGH. PREACHING 

00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:39.166
CAPTAINS ARE LEADING CHEERS FOR 
THE LAST HALF HOUR. IT'S LIKE A 

00:45:42.629 --> 00:45:44.629
FOOTBALL GAME. PARTY BUSINESS IS
UNDERWAY AND EVERYONE IS SIGNED 

00:45:44.692 --> 00:45:49.933
IN AND THE DOORS ARE CLOSED. IF 
YOU WANT TO CAUCUS YOU HAVE TO 

00:45:50.138 --> 00:45:52.997
BE ON TIME AND IN THE ROOM BY 7 
PM. AFTER SOME SPEECHES AND SOME

00:45:53.198 --> 00:45:55.198
BUSINESS, PEOPLE WILL FILTER 
INTO THE DESIGNATED AREAS FOR 

00:45:55.315 --> 00:45:59.076
THEIR FIRST CHOICE CANDIDATE. 
AFTER THAT, THERE WILL BE A 

00:45:59.283 --> 00:46:01.719
REALIGNMENT IN WHICH THE 
PRECINCT CAPTAINS FIGHT OVER IT 

00:46:02.322 --> 00:46:06.674
A BIT THAT WILL BE A KEY MOMENT 
IN DELEGATES WILL BE APPORTIONED

00:46:06.876 --> 00:46:09.641
AFTER THE FINAL ALIGNMENT. I WAS
TALKING TO A STUDENT WHO SAID IT

00:46:09.848 --> 00:46:13.705
WAS NOT HARD TO GET HER FRIENDS 
DOWN TO CAUCUS EVEN THOUGH ARE 

00:46:13.906 --> 00:46:17.449
THEY ARE NOT POLITICALLY 
ENGAGED. THIS IS WHERE THEIR 

00:46:17.661 --> 00:46:19.914
FRIENDS ARE ANYWAY SO THEY 
THOUGHT TO COME TOO. WE WILL SEE

00:46:20.117 --> 00:46:22.840
WHERE THEY END UP. A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXCITEMENT 

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:26.805
AND COMMITMENT OF PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CAMPAIGNS 

00:46:27.013 --> 00:46:29.210
AND THEY BEEN STUDENTS AND THOSE
WHO COME BECAUSE THEIR FRIENDS 

00:46:30.757 --> 00:46:35.235
ARE HERE. IT'S AN UNUSUAL FORM 
OF DEMOCRACY TO BE SURE. IT'S 

00:46:35.437 --> 00:46:38.083
ONE THAT MAKES PEOPLE WONDER WHY
WE DO IT THIS WAY, WHY IOWA. 

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.329
&gt;&gt; WE SPOKE TO IOWANS TO FIND 
OUT WHAT IS LIKE TO BE FIRST IN 

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:43.530
THE NATION. LET'S TAKE 

00:46:46.408 --> 00:46:48.408
A LOOK.
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IOWA IN ONE WORD? 

00:46:49.044 --> 00:46:53.714
PARK REAL. 
&gt;&gt; IDEA WAS OUR KIND. 

00:46:53.715 --> 00:46:56.560
&gt;&gt; KNOWLEDGEABLE. 
&gt;&gt; COMMITTED. 

00:46:56.561 --> 00:46:58.064
&gt;&gt; EXCITED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE IOWA CAUCUS OF 

00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:00.065
THE 

00:47:01.835 --> 00:47:03.835
FIRST TEST CANDIDATES FACE WHEN 
THEY RUN FOR THEIR PARTY'S 

00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:05.716
NOMINATION. 
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF AGAIN 

00:47:05.717 --> 00:47:08.069
IT IS VIABLE IOWA IS THE PLACE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE STATE HAS BEEN 

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.280
FIRST IN THE NATION SINCE 1972 
IN A 1976 

00:47:13.005 --> 00:47:14.655
JIMMY CARTER'S SMALL CAMPAIGN 
WOULD LAUNCH THE NATIONAL 

00:47:14.656 --> 00:47:16.082
PROMINENCE BECAUSE OF HIS 
SUCCESS IN IOWA. 

00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:20.029
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY OF THE 
CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT WORKING

00:47:20.226 --> 00:47:22.566
IN THE HOT AUGUST SUN? 
&gt;&gt; IOWA IS A GOOD EVEN PLAYING 

00:47:22.772 --> 00:47:27.447
FIELD I THINK. WE'VE GOT MEDIA 
MARKETS THAT ARE SMALL. 

00:47:27.448 --> 00:47:29.267
&gt;&gt; DOES THAT MEAN IT'S NOT THAT 
EXPENSIVE? 

00:47:29.268 --> 00:47:32.926
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S EASIER TO BE ON THE 

00:47:33.128 --> 00:47:36.793
GROUND IN IOWA. 
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, WE ARE GOOD-SIZED 

00:47:36.992 --> 00:47:42.203
STATE WITH 3 MILLION PEOPLE. YOU
CAN GET FROM BORDER TO BORDER IN

00:47:42.403 --> 00:47:43.815

TO SOUTH.

00:47:43.816 --> 00:47:47.346
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE SPOKE TO DRAKE 
UNIVERSITY CLUB MEMBERS ABOUT 

00:47:47.556 --> 00:47:49.571
WHAT MAKES THEIR STATE 
DIFFERENCE. 

00:47:49.572 --> 00:47:51.200
&gt;&gt; IOWANS PUT CANDIDATES THROUGH
THE RINGER. 

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:55.661
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE EASIER TO LEARN 
HERE AND THEY WILL ASK EVERY 

00:47:55.863 --> 00:47:59.114
QUESTION AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. 
THAT'S MY OPINION. 

00:47:59.115 --> 00:48:02.074
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR ALL ITS PASSION
IOWA IS NOT A 

00:48:05.413 --> 00:48:07.042
REPRESENTATIVE STATE. ACCORDING 
TO THE UNITED STATES CENSUS 

00:48:07.043 --> 00:48:09.081
BUREAU THE STATE IS OVER 90% 
WHITE WHICH LEAD SOME PEOPLE 

00:48:12.114 --> 00:48:14.238
TO ASK, SHOULD A LESS DIVERSE 
STATE HAVE SO MUCH POLITICAL 

00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:15.457
INFLUENCE IN A DIVERSIFYING 
COUNTRY? 

00:48:15.458 --> 00:48:17.458
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE FOREVER WE 
SHOULD 

00:48:20.851 --> 00:48:22.790
BE MARRIED TO IOWA AND NEW 
HAMPSHIRE GOING FIRST. 

00:48:22.791 --> 00:48:24.791

SPEAKING IOWA DOES PICK WINNERS.

00:48:24.926 --> 00:48:28.771

OF THEIR MESSAGE, THEIR 
ORGANIZATION AND THE PASSION OF 

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:40.982
THEIR VOTERS. IT'S WHERE BARACK 
OBAMA GOT THE MOMENTUM THAT 

00:48:41.171 --> 00:48:43.171
LAUNCHED HIM TO 

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:45.921

HAVE A HUGE TASK AT HAND AND 

00:48:52.745 --> 00:48:54.795
THEY WILL LIKELY PUT AN END TO 
SOME LESS SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS. 

00:48:55.089 --> 00:48:58.840
SOME OF THE STUDENTS IN THAT 
VIDEO HERE TONIGHT AND WE WILL 

00:48:59.038 --> 00:49:01.038
TRY TO GRAB 

00:49:02.897 --> 00:49:04.897
THEM LATER.  OF YOU ARE 
VOLUNTEERING FOR THE PETE 

00:49:04.953 --> 00:49:06.953
BUTTIGIEG CAMPAIGN AND THEY ARE 
EXCITED AND THEY WERE VERY 

00:49:07.058 --> 00:49:09.252
ANXIOUS EARLIER.  EVERYONE IS 
STRESSED BUT IN A KIND OF FUN, 

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.032
COLLEGE WAY. THINGS WILL GET 
BUSY HERE AND VERY LOUD. WE WILL

00:49:12.235 --> 00:49:14.478
KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IN COME BACK TO YOU SOON.

00:49:14.479 --> 00:49:16.913
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. THE POST 

00:49:19.964 --> 00:49:22.425
JOYCE KOH HAS FOLLOWED THE RACE 
ALL WINTER LONG BACK IN THE FALL

00:49:22.633 --> 00:49:27.370
IN THE SUMMER AND SHE IS NOW IN 
COUNCIL BLUFFS. WHY HAS THAT 

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:31.536
AREA BEEN A FOCUS FOR THE 
CANDIDATES?

00:49:31.537 --> 00:49:33.537
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LIBBY, CANDIDATES 
HAVE BEEN IN COUNCIL BLUFFS FOR 

00:49:33.573 --> 00:49:37.316
MONTHS IN THE LEAD UP TO THE 
CAUCUSES. EVEN IN THE LAST WEEK 

00:49:37.518 --> 00:49:40.283
WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL CANDIDATES 
COME AND HOLD EVENTS, JOE BIDEN,

00:49:40.485 --> 00:49:42.485
PETE 

00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:45.921
BUTTIGIEG , ANDREW YANG AND AMY 
KLOBUCHAR WERE HERE HAVING 

00:49:45.956 --> 00:49:49.406
EVENTS TO REACH THE VOTERS OUT 
IN SOUTHWEST IOWA. THEY ALSO ALL

00:49:49.616 --> 00:49:52.654
HAVE DEVOTED FIELD OFFICES HERE 
AS WELL. THEY ARE ALL TRYING TO 

00:49:52.866 --> 00:49:56.923
REACH THIS POPULATION OF MORE 
RURAL VOTERS IN IOWA. AS FAR AS 

00:49:57.217 --> 00:49:59.771
DEMOCRATS, WE'VE SEEN HISTORY 
SHOW THAT THERE REALLY IS NO 

00:50:02.407 --> 00:50:04.845
CLEAR PREFERENCE. IN 2016, 
BERNIE SANDERS TOOK THIS AREA 

00:50:05.054 --> 00:50:07.054
AND IN 2008, 

00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:11.439
HILLARY CLINTON WON IN COUNCIL 
BLUFFS. WE WILL SEE IF IT'S 

00:50:11.638 --> 00:50:13.989
ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT FOR BERNIE 
SANDERS OR IF ANOTHER CANDIDATE 

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.190
ENDS UP TAKING THE WIN. 

00:50:18.659 --> 00:50:20.199
LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; JOYCE, OUR PEOPLE DECIDED ON 

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.126
WHO THEY WILL VOTE FOR TONIGHT?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S INTERESTING, 

00:50:23.327 --> 00:50:27.593
IN LARGE PART PEOPLE ARE 
MOTIVATED TO COME OUT AND CAUCUS

00:50:27.797 --> 00:50:30.444
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REMOVE 
TRUMP FROM OFFICE AND GET 

00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:32.741
ANOTHER PRESIDENT IN THE 

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:37.155
OVAL OFFICE. THAT IS THE NUMBER 
ONE MOTIVATOR FOR A LOT OF THESE

00:50:37.356 --> 00:50:40.235
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS THERE'S. THE 
ONES WE SPOKEN TO HAVE ONE OR 

00:50:40.436 --> 00:50:42.771
TWO CANDIDATES AT THE TOP OF 
THEIR LIST BUT MANY HAVE SAID 

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:47.505
THEY ARE WILLING TO BE PERSUADED
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TONIGHT. IT 

00:50:47.709 --> 00:50:52.095
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. WE DID GET TO SPEAK TO 

00:50:52.303 --> 00:50:54.321
SOME PEOPLE HERE IN COUNCIL 
BLUFFS EARLY THIS WEEK. TAKE A 

00:50:54.523 --> 00:50:58.264
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID. 
&gt;&gt; I'M VOTING BERNIE SANDERS. 

00:50:58.475 --> 00:51:03.756
AUTHENTICITY AND I TRUST HIM. 
ANYONE IN CONGRESS IN THE HOUSE 

00:51:03.976 --> 00:51:08.624
AND THE SENATE IS MY NUMBER ONE 
GUY. BERNIE'S RECORD HAS BEEN 

00:51:08.826 --> 00:51:15.327
THE MOST CONSISTENT OUT OF ANY 
BODY IN THE RACE RIGHT NOW. YOU 

00:51:15.532 --> 00:51:18.578
KNOW HE IS ELECTED IN THE HOUSE 
IN 1990. AND I TRUST 

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.163
HIM TO, IF I WERE IN A CAR I 
WOULD STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE 

00:51:26.362 --> 00:51:30.770
ROAD AND HE WOULD HELP ME
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN WITH AMY SINCE 

00:51:30.978 --> 00:51:34.222
AUGUST. I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE
HER AT A FORM IN SIOUX CITY. I 

00:51:34.422 --> 00:51:36.668
HAD THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SIT WITH HER FOR AN HOUR AND 

00:51:36.869 --> 00:51:41.125
HALF COFFEE. SHE IS THE REAL 
DEAL. ONE THING THAT ATTRACTED 

00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:46.290
ME TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR IS SHE 
GAVE US CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF 

00:51:46.488 --> 00:51:51.081
WHAT SHE HAS DONE AS A UNITED 
STATES SENATOR. THE 100 BILLS 

00:51:51.284 --> 00:51:54.328
PASSED, BEING IN THE MINORITY, 
THAT IS QUITE AN 

00:51:58.184 --> 00:52:00.414
AMAZING FEAT.
&gt;&gt; WHY IS THAT? 

00:52:00.415 --> 00:52:04.682
&gt;&gt; I JUST LIKE HER NO-NONSENSE 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THINGS AND THE 

00:52:06.517 --> 00:52:10.066
FACT THAT I FIND HER VERY 
REALISTIC. I GENUINELY THINK 

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:17.072
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON AND I THINK 
SHE IS INTELLIGENT. SHE SPEAKS 

00:52:17.276 --> 00:52:23.774
WELL. I BELIEVE SHE SPEAKS FOR 
NOT JUST YOU KNOW, THE 

00:52:27.226 --> 00:52:28.454
1%.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TO GIVE YOU SOME 

00:52:28.455 --> 00:52:31.090
GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT OF WHERE 
COUNCIL BLUFFS IS, IT'S NEXT TO 

00:52:31.305 --> 00:52:35.761
OMAHA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
RIVER. IT HUGS THE NEBRASKA-IOWA

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.221
STATE LINE. IT'S A MORE RURAL 
AND SUBURBAN AREA 

00:52:42.865 --> 00:52:44.997
OF IOWA BUT IT ALSO HAS THIS 
METROPOLITAN INFLUENCE FROM ITS 

00:52:45.197 --> 00:52:49.576
PROXIMITY TO OMAHA. ANOTHER 
THING TO MENTION IS THAT IN 

00:52:49.781 --> 00:52:52.438
COUNCIL BLUFFS IT HAS A HIGHER 
REGISTRATION RATE AMONG AFRICAN 

00:52:52.633 --> 00:52:55.057
AMERICAN VOTERS AND ELSEWHERE IN
THE STATE. THAT'S AN INTERESTING

00:52:55.267 --> 00:53:00.136
THING TO NOTE AS FAR AS WHY SO 
MANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HAVE 

00:53:00.336 --> 00:53:05.320
BEEN IN THIS AREA TRYING TO 
REACH VOTERS HERE. BEFORE I SEND

00:53:05.519 --> 00:53:08.147
IT BACK TO YOU I WANT TO MENTION
THAT PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO GET 

00:53:08.669 --> 00:53:10.911
IN LINE, THEY ARE STARTING TO 
FILL OUT THEIR CARDS AND SUBMIT 

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.554
THEM FOR THE FIRST ALIGNMENT SO 
THINGS WILL GET GOING AS WE HEAD

00:53:13.756 --> 00:53:17.994
INTO THE NIGHT. WE WILL BRING 
YOU MORE UPDATES AS AN EYE 

00:53:18.422 --> 00:53:20.422
CONTINUES. LIBBY.
&gt;&gt; 

00:53:23.087 --> 00:53:25.119
GREAT, JOYCE. THANK YOU. EUGENE,
THE VOTERS THAT JOYCE SPOKE TO 

00:53:25.328 --> 00:53:27.663
SOUNDED FIRM IN WHO THEY LIKE. 
THERE ARE SO MANY VOTERS WHO 

00:53:27.857 --> 00:53:29.857
SAID THEY ARE UNDECIDED AND THAT

00:53:32.437 --> 00:53:34.667
THEY ARE -- WHAT ARE THEY 
WAITING FOR? AS YOU SPOKE TO 

00:53:34.869 --> 00:53:37.415
PEOPLE DID YOU GET A SENSE OF 
WHEN THE MOMENT OF TRUTH MIGHT 

00:53:37.616 --> 00:53:39.848
BE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE? 
&gt;&gt; A GOOD NUMBER IMPLIED THE 

00:53:40.045 --> 00:53:42.587
MOMENT OF TRUTH WOULD NOT COME 
UNTIL TONIGHT. I SPOKE WITH 

00:53:42.795 --> 00:53:45.426
FOLKS WHO SAID THEY NARROW 
THINGS DOWN TO THEIR TOP TWO OR 

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:50.910
THREE. THEY WERE STILL LISTENING
AND WAITING FOR ANSWERS FROM THE

00:53:51.122 --> 00:53:52.954
CANDIDATES. I THINK COUNCIL 
BLUFFS IS AN INTERESTING PLACE 

00:53:52.955 --> 00:53:57.297
TO LOOK AT. I WAS AT EIGHT 
BUTTIGIEG EVENT THERE FRIDAY AND

00:53:57.496 --> 00:53:59.914
ONE REASONS I'M FASCINATED AT  
WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN A PLACE AS 

00:54:00.112 --> 00:54:02.112
COUNCIL BLUFFS IS 

00:54:03.713 --> 00:54:05.953
BECAUSE WE PAID ATTENTION IN 
2016 AND 22 INTO THE SUBURBS. WE

00:54:06.156 --> 00:54:10.826
KNOW DONALD TRUMP WON THE 
SUBURBS IN 2016 AND 2018 THE 

00:54:11.029 --> 00:54:15.085
LEFT WON THE SUBURBS. IT WILL BE
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE 

00:54:15.286 --> 00:54:18.839
SUBURBS WANT IN 2020, IF THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE 

00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:23.823
PRAGMATIC AND MODERATE. IF THEY 
WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE YOU

00:54:24.025 --> 00:54:25.645
KNOW NONCONVENTIONAL AND 
REVOLUTIONARY LIKE SOME OF THESE

00:54:25.646 --> 00:54:29.388
CANDIDATES ON THE LEFT ARE 
PROMPTING OR IF THEY WILL GO TO 

00:54:29.594 --> 00:54:31.594
TRUMP AGAIN. 
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR, 

00:54:35.134 --> 00:54:40.154
WE HEARD HOW THE CAUCUS WORKS 
AND HOW THIS PROCESS GOES CAN 

00:54:40.352 --> 00:54:42.973
YOU JUST DIG INTO THIS FOR US IF
YOU WALK INTO THE CAUCUS SITE 

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:45.403
AND YOU'VE GOT A FIRST CHOICE 
HOW MUCH ARE YOU STILL THINKING 

00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:47.628
OVER YOUR SECOND CHOICE OR THIRD
CHOICE OR YOUR OTHER OPTIONS? 

00:54:47.832 --> 00:54:50.631
&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS 
YEAR. WHEN YOU MAKE THE FIRST 

00:54:50.835 --> 00:54:56.319
CHOICE, IF YOUR CANDIDATE GETS 
15%, YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR 

00:54:57.735 --> 00:55:02.832
SELECTION. IN PAST CAUCUSES, 
GOING BACK TO 1972, THERE WAS 

00:55:03.038 --> 00:55:07.697
MUCH MORE OF A SORT OF A CHAOTIC
PROCESS. THAT WAS WITHIN THE 

00:55:07.898 --> 00:55:13.984
CAUCUSES, YOU COULD COME IN WITH
YOUR FIRST CHOICE DIVIDED UP. 

00:55:14.199 --> 00:55:18.466
MAYBE, THERE WOULD BE A 15 
MINUTE REARRANGEMENT KIND OF 

00:55:18.684 --> 00:55:20.684
PROCESS. THAT WAS NOT THE 

00:55:23.536 --> 00:55:25.658
FINAL ONE. IF THERE WERE STILL 
SOME UNDECIDED PEOPLE YOU WOULD 

00:55:25.862 --> 00:55:28.268
STILL BE TRYING TO COERCE THEM. 
ONE OF THE PAYOFFS IS NOT A 

00:55:28.464 --> 00:55:33.090
MONETARY PAYOFF BUT IN FACT, 
BEING A DELEGATE TO THE COLONY 

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:35.290
CONVENTION. WHAT 

00:55:36.741 --> 00:55:39.277
HAPPENS AT CAUCUSES IS THAT YOU 
ELECT PEOPLE TO GO TO THE COUNTY

00:55:39.588 --> 00:55:41.823
CONVENTION  IN THIS WHOLE 
PROCESS. THAT WAS ONE OF THE 

00:55:42.037 --> 00:55:45.879
TICKETS THAT YOU KIND OF HELD 
OUT TO TRY TO BRING SOMEBODY 

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:51.779
INTO YOUR 15% OR PLUS 15%. THIS 
YEAR WILL BE DIFFERENT. FIRST 

00:55:51.978 --> 00:55:55.631
TIME YOU MAKE A CHOICE YOU ARE 
STUCK WITH THAT. UNLESS YOUR 

00:55:55.833 --> 00:55:59.899
CANDIDATE DOES NOT GET 15%. IF 
YOUR CANDIDATE DOES NOT GET 15%,

00:56:00.111 --> 00:56:03.762
THEN ON THE SECOND GO AROUND YOU
CAN MAKE ANOTHER CHOICE. BUT 

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.211
THEN IF YOU ARE STILL STUCK 
WITHOUT A CANDIDATE WITH 15%, 

00:56:07.415 --> 00:56:09.415
YOU CAN 

00:56:12.288 --> 00:56:14.080
GO HOME.
&gt;&gt; WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE NIGHT 

00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:16.101
OF HOW THE PROCESS WORKS. IT'S 
FASCINATING TO THOSE OF US 

00:56:16.302 --> 00:56:19.201
OUTSIDE IOWA.  ONE THING WE HEAR
FROM PEOPLE IS I WANT TO FIND 

00:56:19.404 --> 00:56:22.843
SOMEONE WHO CAN BEAT PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP. ELECTABILITY IS 

00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:25.442
KEY AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A 
NO-BRAINER, OF COURSE BUT IT'S 

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:30.156
NOT BECAUSE IT'S SO SIGNIFICANT.
THEY ARE NOT SAYING I WANT 

00:56:30.361 --> 00:56:32.636
SOMEONE WHO IS STRONG IN XYZ. 
THEY MAY CONSIDER IT BUT IT 

00:56:32.835 --> 00:56:34.835
SEEMS LIKE ELECTABILITY IS 

00:56:38.692 --> 00:56:40.717
JUST OUTSIZED COMPARED TO WHAT 
WE'VE SEEN IN PAST YEARS. 

00:56:40.718 --> 00:56:43.360
&gt;&gt; THE IOWANS ARE STRATEGIC 
VOTERS. ONE OF THE THINGS IS 

00:56:43.563 --> 00:56:45.563
THEY ARE LOOKING AT HEAD-TO-HEAD
MATCHUP. IT'S FUNNY. AT 

00:56:48.446 --> 00:56:50.466
BIDEN RALLIES THEY WILL PUT UP 
POWERPOINT SLIDES THAT SHOW HOW 

00:56:50.678 --> 00:56:53.111
JOE BIDEN DOES IN MATCH UPS 
AGAIN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND

00:56:53.929 --> 00:56:56.773
BERNIE SANDERS BECAUSE THEY'RE 
IS SUCH A CONCERN 

00:57:00.215 --> 00:57:02.260
ABOUT ELECTABILITY. WE WILL DO 
THE SAME AND POINT TO SPECIFIC 

00:57:02.463 --> 00:57:05.402
FULL WHERE HE SPEEDING DONALD 
TRUMP. THERE IS A LOT OF 

00:57:05.596 --> 00:57:09.569
STRATEGIC THINKING GOING IN BUT 
DURING THE CAUCUSES IT'S A 

00:57:09.772 --> 00:57:11.999
COMMUNITY MEETING ON THE 
PRIMARY. ONE OF THE THINGS THIS 

00:57:12.199 --> 00:57:15.662
WEEKEND, THE DES MOINES REGISTER
WAS GOING TO PUT OUT THE FINAL 

00:57:15.868 --> 00:57:18.118
IOWA POLL SATURDAY NIGHT, IT'S 
CONSIDERED THE 

00:57:21.139 --> 00:57:23.187
GOLD STANDARD. IT'S FUN FOR US 
BECAUSE WE ARE POLITICAL JUNKIES

00:57:23.386 --> 00:57:26.646
AND WE WANT TO SEE IT. BELIEVE 
IT OR NOT, I RAN INTO VOTERS. I 

00:57:26.846 --> 00:57:32.103
WENT TO SIX RALLIES YESTERDAY. 
YOU RUN INTO A LOT OF VOTERS --

00:57:32.104 --> 00:57:34.751
&gt;&gt; PLEDGING. 
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE UPSET THEY COULD 

00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:37.390
NOT SEE THE POLLS. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD HAVE INFLUENCE 

00:57:37.593 --> 00:57:40.036
THEM ON ELECTABILITY AND WHO 
THEIR NEIGHBORS 

00:57:43.287 --> 00:57:45.287
ARE THINKING. 
&gt;&gt; IF BIDEN IS FADING DO I THEN 

00:57:45.302 --> 00:57:50.594
GO TO BUTTIGIEG.  PEOPLE WANT TO
GET BEHIND THE WINNER. THERE'S A

00:57:50.798 --> 00:57:52.670
BANDWAGON ELEMENT AND THAT 
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE IN THESE 

00:57:52.671 --> 00:57:54.910
ROOMS. YOU CAN REALLY SEE IT. 
YOU MIGHT HAVE PEOPLE WHO KIND 

00:57:55.105 --> 00:57:57.610
OF LIKE AND I DON'T WANT TO PICK
A SPECIFIC CANDIDATE BECAUSE WE 

00:57:58.111 --> 00:58:00.542
DON'T KNOW BUT YOU CAN THINK OF 
PAST YEARS WHERE MAYBE I REALLY 

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:05.020
LIKED CHRIS DODD AND THEN ALL OF
A SUDDEN THERE ARE FIVE OF YOUR 

00:58:05.226 --> 00:58:08.474
NEIGHBORS BUT THERE ARE 50 
PEOPLE OVER WITH BARACK OBAMA 

00:58:08.675 --> 00:58:12.333
CREW AND 30 ARE WITH JOHN 
EDWARDS. YOU SAY, OH MY FRIENDS 

00:58:12.527 --> 00:58:14.527
ARE WITH 

00:58:15.982 --> 00:58:17.937
OBAMA AND THERE IS DEFINITELY 
HORSETRADING WITH DELEGATES BUT 

00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:21.464
IT REALLY IS A COMMUNITY 
MEETING. IT'S NOT A SECRET 

00:58:21.677 --> 00:58:24.534
BALLOT. WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO 
THINKING OF A SECRET BALLOT. ALL

00:58:24.729 --> 00:58:28.282
OF THOSE CALCULATIONS WAY ON 
PEOPLE. IN SOME WAYS IT HOLDS 

00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:32.846
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE IT 
MAKES PEOPLE THINK EXTRA HARD 

00:58:33.047 --> 00:58:35.047
LIKE IS THIS SOMEONE I CAN BE 
PROUD ENOUGH TO 

00:58:39.867 --> 00:58:42.799
PUBLICLY SUPPORT. IT'S GOING AND
STANDING IN SOMEONE'S CORNER AT 

00:58:42.999 --> 00:58:45.041
ONE OF THESE EVENTS LIKE WE ARE 
SEEING WITH OUR CORRESPONDENCE 

00:58:45.242 --> 00:58:47.242
IN THE FIELD. IT REALLY IS 
TAKING A 

00:58:51.653 --> 00:58:52.148
STAND. 
&gt;&gt; LITERALLY. 

00:58:52.149 --> 00:58:55.797
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE REASONS I KNOW 
THAT SOME VOTERS I SPOKE WITH 

00:58:55.998 --> 00:58:58.236
THIS MORNING REALLY WANTED TO 
SEE THAT POLL IS BECAUSE A LOT 

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.440
OF PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING HAS 
OPENLY WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS AND 

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:04.425
CHURCH MEMBERS AND FAMILY ABOUT 
POLITICS RIGHT NOW. I'VE TALKED 

00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:07.248
TO VOTERS WHO SAY THEY FOUND IT 
TO BE SO DIVISIVE AND THEY WERE 

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.633
SO SCARED OF JUST CAUSING 
TENSION WITH PEOPLE THEY CARE 

00:59:10.835 --> 00:59:13.261
ABOUT THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN 
ASKING DIRECTLY, WHO ARE YOU 

00:59:13.468 --> 00:59:18.545
BACKING IN THE WAYS WE HAVE IN 
THE PAST. IFAD DIFFERENT IDEA OF

00:59:18.775 --> 00:59:21.393
WHAT THEIR NEIGHBORS WERE 
THINKING AND WAYS THEY HAD IN 

00:59:24.033 --> 00:59:25.584
THE PAST. 
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT TOO. 

00:59:25.585 --> 00:59:28.503
IF THE POLL HAD COME OUT WE MAY 
HAVE GOTTEN A BETTER IDEA TO 

00:59:28.707 --> 00:59:31.956
WHAT EXTENT PEOPLE MADE A 
DECISION OR NOT. ALL OF THE 

00:59:32.163 --> 00:59:36.630
OTHER EARLIER POLLS SHOWED 60% 
UNDECIDED AND 40% UNDECIDED. I 

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:41.920
THINK THAT POLL WOULD HAVE BEEN 
KIND OF VERY INFORMATIVE TO SOME

00:59:42.124 --> 00:59:46.890
PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE FENCE, ON 
WHICH CANDIDATE PARTICULARLY IF 

00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:49.089
YOU TIED IN WITH ELECTABILITY 
DIMENSION. THAT MIGHT HAVE 

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.691
BEEN PIVOTAL. 
&gt;&gt; EVEN HAVE YOU BEEN HERE IN 

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.797
IOWA WATCHING ALL OF THIS 
UNFOLD. A LOT OF THE NATION'S 

00:59:57.996 --> 01:00:00.990
ATTENTION HAS BEEN TURNED TO 
WASHINGTON AND CONGRESS. TODAY, 

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.834
SENATOR HAD CLOSING ARGUMENTS 
AND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF 

01:00:02.835 --> 01:00:05.475
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THIS WAS
A MOMENT THAT EVERYTHING THAT 

01:00:05.684 --> 01:00:07.684
FINALLY LAID ON 

01:00:09.124 --> 01:00:11.242
THE TABLE. OUR COLLEAGUE RHONDA 
COLEMAN HAS BEEN ON CAPITOL HILL

01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:13.802
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS. 
RHONDA, BRING US UP TO SPEED ON 

01:00:13.999 --> 01:00:16.437
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S RIGHTLY BE, 

01:00:16.639 --> 01:00:21.213
GOOD EVENING FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
TODAY, BOTH THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

01:00:21.412 --> 01:00:23.428
AND ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL
GAVE THEIR CLOSING ODDMENTS IN 

01:00:23.628 --> 01:00:26.388
THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. WHAT WE 
HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS IS THERE 

01:00:27.606 --> 01:00:29.606
IMPASSIONED PLEA TO REMOVE 

01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:33.782
THE PRESIDENT AND WHAT WE HEARD 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL IS 

01:00:33.984 --> 01:00:37.962
THAT IMPEACHMENT BEGAN LONG AGO,
IT WAS PLANNED AND IT NEEDS TO 

01:00:38.169 --> 01:00:40.407
END NOW. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT 
THEY HAD TO SAY TODAY. 

01:00:40.408 --> 01:00:42.536
&gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENTS 
WE'VE BEEN MAKING. AT THE END OF

01:00:42.843 --> 01:00:44.843
THE DAY, THE KEY CONCLUSION WE 
BELIEVE THE 

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:49.513
ONLY CONCLUSION BASED ON THE 
EVIDENCE AND BASED ON THE 

01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:51.573
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 
THEMSELVES IN THE CONSTITUTION 

01:00:51.574 --> 01:00:53.509
IS THAT YOU MUST VOTE TO ACQUIT 
THE PRESIDENT. 

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:57.262
&gt;&gt; AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS 
IS AN EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE 

01:00:57.473 --> 01:00:59.500
RESULTS OF ONE ELECTION AND TO 
TRY 

01:01:02.548 --> 01:01:04.981
TO INTERFERE IN THE COMING 
ELECTION THAT BEGINS TODAY IN 

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:07.615
IOWA.
&gt;&gt; CAN WE BE CONFIDENT THAT 

01:01:07.827 --> 01:01:09.827
AMERICANS AND NOT FOREIGN POWERS
WILL GET TO DECIDE IN 

01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:15.034
THE PRESIDENT WILL SHUN ANY 
FURTHER FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN 

01:01:15.035 --> 01:01:19.408
OUR DEMOCRATIC AFFAIRS? AND THE 
SHORT PLANE, SAD MY 

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:23.969
INCONTESTABLE ANSWER IS NO, YOU 
CAN'T. YOU CAN'T TRUST THIS 

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:27.326
PRESIDENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING 
NOT FOR ONE MINUTE, NOT FOR ONE 

01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:32.405
ELECTION, NOT FOR THE SAKE OF 
OUR COUNTRY. YOU JUST CAN'T. HE 

01:01:32.618 --> 01:01:34.618
WILL NOT CHANGE. AND YOU 

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.896
KNOW IT.
&gt;&gt; ARGUMENTS LASTED FOR ABOUT 

01:01:43.365 --> 01:01:45.365
FOUR HOURS AND AFTER THAT THE 
SENATE WENT INTO REGULAR 

01:01:45.522 --> 01:01:47.522
BUSINESS WHERE SENATORS WERE 
ABLE TO GIVE THEIR REMARKS ON 

01:01:47.585 --> 01:01:50.294
THE FLOOR FOR A FEW MINUTES.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MOST NOTABLY 

01:01:50.497 --> 01:01:53.729
SENATOR MANSON OF WEST VIRGINIA 
A MODERATE DEMOCRAT, HE ASKED 

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:58.406
HIS COLLEAGUES TO VOTE FOR 
RESOLUTION CONSENT SHARING THE 

01:01:58.607 --> 01:02:00.607
PRESIDENT THAT IS 

01:02:04.004 --> 01:02:07.359
NOT AS SERIOUS AS IMPEACHMENT 
BUT IT'S SOMETHING HE'S PUT ON 

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.821
THE TABLE SO WE EXPECT TO HEAR 
FROM WHERE SENATORS TOMORROW AND

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.502
WE HAVE THE STATE OF THE UNION 
AT NIGHTTIME AND THE DAY AFTER 

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.862
LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT TALKS TO BOTH CHAMBERS

01:02:18.519 --> 01:02:20.768
TOMORROW NIGHT, WE WILL SEE THAT
SENATE VOTE ON IMPEACHMENT AT 4 

01:02:20.972 --> 01:02:24.708
PM WEDNESDAY. LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; SO MANY HISTORIC EVENTS ALL 

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:29.711
PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. TONIGHT, WE 

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.913
WILL GET MORE INFORMATION ON 

01:02:34.775 --> 01:02:36.701
VOTER PREFERENCES IN IOWA THAN 
PREVIOUS ELECTIONS BUT MULTIPLE 

01:02:36.702 --> 01:02:38.522
NUMBERS COULD CAUSE SOME 
CONFUSION. LET'S GO BACK TO 

01:02:38.523 --> 01:02:40.874
WASHINGTON AND OUR ELECTION 
INSIGHTS SCENE. JEREMY, HELP US 

01:02:41.073 --> 01:02:43.515
UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION WE 
WILL GET TONIGHT.

01:02:43.516 --> 01:02:48.064
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, IT'S 
COMPLICATED I WANT MY. WE ARE 

01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:50.268
GETTING ALL OF THESE NUMBERS 
FROM THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:52.312
FOR THE 

01:02:53.661 --> 01:02:56.122
FIRST TIME AND SO IT FEELS LIKE 
THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO 

01:02:56.324 --> 01:02:58.673
WALK THROUGH WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
AND A CAUCUS LOCATION NOT JUST 

01:02:58.879 --> 01:03:01.790
FROM THE WIDE SHOT BUT ALSO WHAT
DO WE SEE WITH THE ACTUAL VOTERS

01:03:01.993 --> 01:03:03.993
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING? 

01:03:07.821 --> 01:03:13.028
LET'S LOOK. YOU CAN SEE THAT 
WE'VE GOT A MOCKUP OF THE CAUCUS

01:03:13.225 --> 01:03:15.484
LOCATION. YOU CAN SEE THE VOTERS
HAVE MOVED TO THE CORNERS FOR 

01:03:15.698 --> 01:03:17.733
THE CANDIDATES I'D LIKE TO VOTE 
FOR. THERE'S NO SECRET BALLOT 

01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:20.484
HERE IN IOWA. EVERYBODY HAS TO 
MOVE WITH THEIR FEET TO THE SPOT

01:03:20.686 --> 01:03:22.928
WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO VOTE. 
CANDIDATE A IS 40%, CANDIDATE B 

01:03:23.135 --> 01:03:25.135
30%, 

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.500
CANDIDATE C 20% IN CANDIDATE D 
20%. THIS IS ONE THING THAT 

01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:30.719
MAKES IOWA SO SPECIAL. CANDIDATE
D  NUMBER IS NOT SUFFICIENT, 

01:03:30.923 --> 01:03:35.109
THEY ARE BELOW 15% IN MOST 
PRECINCTS HAVE A 15% CUT OFF FOR

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:38.675
VIABILITY. THAT MEANS THE NEXT 
STEP FOR THESE VOTERS WHO VOTED 

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:41.821
FOR CANDIDATE D WILL HAVE TO 
MOVE BACK TO THE CENTER OF THE 

01:03:42.024 --> 01:03:45.065
FLOOR AND MAKE ANOTHER DECISION.
THE DECISION THEY GET TO MAKE 

01:03:45.274 --> 01:03:49.834
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THREE THINGS. 
THEY CAN EITHER A. DECIDE THEY 

01:03:50.033 --> 01:03:52.568
WOULD LIKE TO CAUCUS FROM ONE OF
THE THREE REMAINING CANDIDATES. 

01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:56.028
B. THEY CAN DECIDE TO BECOME 
UNCOMMITTED BUT THEY WILL STILL 

01:03:56.263 --> 01:03:58.263
NEED ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAKE 

01:04:00.696 --> 01:04:03.028
THAT HAPPEN. FINALLY, THEY HAVE 
THE OPTION TO JUST PACK UP AND 

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:05.230
LEAVE WHICH IS WHY THOSE SECOND 
ALIGNMENT NUMBERS WILL LOOK 

01:04:05.278 --> 01:04:07.299
SMALLER THAN THE FIRST ALIGNMENT
NUMBERS THAT WE GOT FROM EARLIER

01:04:07.498 --> 01:04:09.908
IN THE NIGHT. THE NEXT STEP FOR 
THESE VOTERS IS TO DECIDE WHAT 

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:14.196
THEY WILL DO. IN OUR 
ILLUSTRATION THEY DECIDED TO 

01:04:14.402 --> 01:04:16.238
CHOOSE ONE OF THE THREE 
REMAINING CANDIDATES. HERE WE 

01:04:16.239 --> 01:04:21.851
SEE KENNEDY A WITH 43%, 
CANDIDATE B WITH 20% IN 

01:04:22.056 --> 01:04:24.056
CANDIDATE C 

01:04:25.676 --> 01:04:28.323
WITH 13%. WHEN THESE TALLIES GET
MADE THOSE ARE GOING TO BE 

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:32.587
TRANSLATED ALONG WITH A LITTLE 
BIT OF COMPLEX MATH ABOUT HOW 

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:34.623
MANY PEOPLE IT TURNED OUT 
PREVIOUSLY FOR THIS CAUCUS 

01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:39.185
LOCATION, INTO A STATE DELEGATE 
EQUIVALENT IN THE STATE DELEGATE

01:04:39.386 --> 01:04:42.947
EQUIVALENTS WILL GET TRANSLATED 
INTO DELEGATES. THOSE DELEGATES 

01:04:43.147 --> 01:04:45.591
WILL ALLOW CANDIDATES TO WIN IN 
THE CONVENTION THIS SUMMER. IOWA

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:49.540
ONLY HAS 41 DELEGATES OUT FOR 
PLAY TONIGHT AND UNLESS 

01:04:49.748 --> 01:04:51.748
SOMETHING GOES WILDLY DIFFERENT 
THAN WHAT WE EXPECT BASED ON 

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.930
PULLING WE ARE PROBABLY ONLY 
GOING TO SEE THE FRONT ONE OR 

01:04:55.135 --> 01:04:59.918
GET BETWEEN 15 AND 20 DATA 
THAT'S. THERE COULD EASILY BE A 

01:05:00.135 --> 01:05:02.146
SCENARIO WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE 
GET 10 OR MORE WHICH MEANS IOWA 

01:05:02.344 --> 01:05:04.344
WILL TAKE ON MORE 

01:05:07.314 --> 01:05:09.314
OF A INTERESTING DIMENSION 
BECAUSE IT WON'T REALLY BE THE 

01:05:09.455 --> 01:05:11.505
MATH THAT PROPELS YOU BUT THE 
FRONT RUNNER STATUS OF HAVING 

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.430
PICKED UP A BIG WIN. YOU WILL 
NEED 1900 DELEGATES TO WIN THIS 

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:17.077
SUMMER. FOR A LITTLE MORE 
INSIGHT INTO WHAT THAT MEANS I'M

01:05:17.274 --> 01:05:20.622
BRING IT BACK TO DAVID BYLER. 
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON A 

01:05:20.822 --> 01:05:22.959
SIMULATOR THAT GIVES PEOPLE A 
LITTLE INSIGHT INTO HOW THIS 

01:05:23.162 --> 01:05:25.162
MIGHT PLAY OUT HOST IOWA. 
&gt;&gt; 

01:05:29.594 --> 01:05:31.707
THANKS, JEREMY. WE BUILD A 
SIMULATOR THAT ALLOWS OUR USERS 

01:05:31.908 --> 01:05:34.555
TO SORT OF EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT
POSSIBLE SPREADS AND RANGES OF 

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.364
OUTCOMES FOR DIFFERENT 
CANDIDATES UNDER DIFFERENT 

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:41.133
CONDITIONS. I WILL HAVE YOU LOOK
INSIDE NOW. TO BUILD THE MODEL 

01:05:41.334 --> 01:05:45.298
HOW THE CAUCUS IS MICHAEL WE 
SELECTED HISTORICAL DATA ON 

01:05:45.497 --> 01:05:48.146
FACTORS INCLUDING POOLS AND 
FUNDRAISERS AND ANALYZED THOSE 

01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:50.473
NUMBERS TO SEE WHAT THEY TOLD US
ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE 

01:05:50.675 --> 01:05:52.675
IN AN ELECTION THAT STILL 
UNDERWAY. BECAUSE ELECTIONS ARE 

01:05:56.466 --> 01:05:58.499
VOLATILE AND THE RUN-UP TO IOWA 
LET READERS PLAY AROUND WITH 

01:05:58.699 --> 01:06:01.149
FOUL POLES AND MONEY MIGHT 
FLUCTUATE. SIMULATING THE 

01:06:01.455 --> 01:06:03.455
CAUCASUS 10,000 TIMES TO SEE 
WHAT OUTCOMES ARE MOST LIKELY 

01:06:03.465 --> 01:06:07.057
FOR EACH CANDIDATE. THE SHORT 
VERSION IS NOW THAT ELECTION DAY

01:06:07.266 --> 01:06:11.603
IS HERE THE MATH SUGGEST ANY OF 
THE LEADING CANDIDATES COULD 

01:06:11.807 --> 01:06:14.216
PULL OFF A WIN. IF YOU WANT TO 
SEE THE RANGE OF OUTCOMES 

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:20.451
CHECK OUT THE POST OPINIONS HOME
PAGE WHERE YOU CAN EXPLORE THE 

01:06:20.654 --> 01:06:22.365
POSSIBILITIES FOR IOWA AND LOOK 
AHEAD TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.

01:06:22.366 --> 01:06:27.757
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD TIMES. I KEEP IT 
BOOKMARKED AND I HAVE IT UP ALL 

01:06:27.957 --> 01:06:30.192
THE TIME. I GUESS WE WILL GET 
MORE INSIGHT IN IOWA, LIBBY. 

01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:34.353
&gt;&gt; OH GOSH. SINCE THERE ARE 
THREE DIFFERENT VOTE TIMES 

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:38.726
TONIGHT. HOW IS THE WAPELLO 
GOING TO DECLARE A WINNER? BUT 

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:40.927
THIS WAS THE 

01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:45.318
SUBJECT OF INTENSE DEBATE I CAN 
TELL YOU THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE 

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.067
OPTION THAT WE THROUGHOUT RIGHT 
OUT OF THE GATE AND THAT WAS THE

01:06:48.268 --> 01:06:51.331
FIRST ALIGNMENT NUMBERS THOSE 
ARE A LOT OF FUN AND THEY SHOW 

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:53.530
IN EARLY 

01:06:54.771 --> 01:06:56.510
PREFERENCE FOR CANDIDATES. IT 
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO 

01:06:56.511 --> 01:07:00.457
TRANSLATING DELEGATE SO THAT IS 
OUT. BETWEEN THE SECOND 

01:07:00.659 --> 01:07:02.659
ALIGNMENT NUMBER OR FINAL 
ALIGNMENT IN THE 

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.890
STATE DELEGATE

01:07:11.219 --> 01:07:13.219
EQUIVALENTS WAS WHERE THE 
MAJORITY OF OUR TIME WAS SPENT. 

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.487
WE DECIDED ON THE WEB WE WILL 
SHOW YOU THE FINAL ALIGNMENT 

01:07:15.687 --> 01:07:17.615
NUMBERS. WE LIKE THEM BECAUSE 
THEY SHOW ONE-TO-ONE SINGLE 

01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:19.877
VOTER AND SINGLE VOTE BUT WE 
WILL HANDLE OUR RACE CALLS ON 

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.417
THE STATE DELEGATE EQUIVALENTS 
BECAUSE THEY TRANSFER INTO 

01:07:22.418 --> 01:07:24.243
DELEGATES AND DELEGATES NOT 
VOTES IS WHAT WINS THE 

01:07:24.244 --> 01:07:26.244
CONVENTION THIS SUMMER.
&gt;&gt; JEREMY THANK YOU 

01:07:28.889 --> 01:07:31.622
SO MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN
ALL OF WHAT THIS MEANS AND GO 

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.820
THROUGH ALL THE NUMBERS AND 
THANKFULLY WE HAVE JEREMY AND 

01:07:33.844 --> 01:07:35.864
HIS TEAM MAKING IT SENSE. HOW 
ARE THE CANDIDATES AND THEIR 

01:07:36.066 --> 01:07:39.053
TEAMS LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS? 
WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR THEM TO 

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360
SAY WE NAILED IT AND WE WON 

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.774
THIS STATE OR WE HIT THE BAR? 
HOW DO YOU TAKE THE MESSAGE OF 

01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:48.975
SUCCESS OUT OF IOWA? 
&gt;&gt;  IOWA, WE TALKED ABOUT 

01:07:49.042 --> 01:07:51.845
DIVERSITY EARLIER IN THE STATE 
BUT SOMETHING ELSE I LEARNED 

01:07:52.045 --> 01:07:55.910
THIS PAST WEEK IS JUST HOW 
DIVERSE IT IS IN TERMS OF 

01:07:56.111 --> 01:07:58.111
COMMUNITIES. THEY ARE URBAN 
AREAS AND SUBURBAN AREAS AND 

01:07:58.344 --> 01:08:03.014
RURAL AREAS. THERE ARE LEVELS TO
THEM AND WHATNOT. I THINK WE 

01:08:03.264 --> 01:08:06.883
WILL SEE SOME CANDIDATES PAYING 
ATTENTION TO HOW THEY PERFORMED 

01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:09.531
IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS AND 
WONDERING IF THEY CAN CONNECT 

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:15.827
MORE WITH RURAL OR MORE YOU KNOW
AGRICULTURAL FOCUS MORE AND 

01:08:16.032 --> 01:08:20.086
EDUCATED AND I MORE DIVERSE OR 
YOUNGER, OLDER, MORE RELIGIOUS. 

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.296
ALL OF 

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.621
THESE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT EXIST IN
THIS DAY AND TAKE SOME SIGNALS 

01:08:28.822 --> 01:08:32.264
TO SEE HOW SHOULD THAT SAY HOW I
CAMPAIGN IN NEVADA AND SOUTH 

01:08:32.463 --> 01:08:34.463
CAROLINA AND OTHER SPACES. THERE
ARE CANDIDATES WHO PROBABLY ARE 

01:08:34.502 --> 01:08:36.644
EXPECTING TO UNDERPERFORM IN 
SOME AREAS. IF THEY DO BETTER IN

01:08:36.841 --> 01:08:39.175
THAT SPACE THEY MAY SAY YOU KNOW
WHAT MAYBE WE CAN ACTUALLY 

01:08:39.379 --> 01:08:43.465
TARGET THIS AREA AND BE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE IN OUR CAMPAIGNING 

01:08:45.068 --> 01:08:47.068
MOVING FORWARD. ONE OF THE 
THINGS PEOPLE HAVE NOTICED 

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.404
ABOUT THE BUTTIGIEG CAMPAIGN A 
CRITIQUE OR PRAISE DEPENDING 

01:08:54.614 --> 01:08:56.950
WHERE YOU STAND IS HOW DIFFERENT
SOME OF HIS MESSAGES RIGHT NOW 

01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.386
COMPARED TO WHEN HE FIRST CAME 
OUT . IT'S MORE MODERATE AND 

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:02.523
FOCUSED ON WINNING SOME FORMER 
TRUMP VOTERS. THEY WILL LOOK AND

01:09:02.737 --> 01:09:04.737
SEE HOW WELL THESE MESSAGES WENT
WITH 

01:09:08.965 --> 01:09:10.965
DIFFERENT VOTERS. 
&gt;&gt;

01:09:14.714 --> 01:09:17.160
IT'S A QUESTION OF ROAD TESTING 
YOUR MESSAGE TO PARTS OF IOWA. I

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:20.097
LOVE TO HEAR THAT AND THE SHEAR 
LIKE I WON THIS DATE MIKE WHO 

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.538
DECLARES VICTORY. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MENTORS. 

01:09:21.539 --> 01:09:23.800
&gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY GET THE MOMENTUM 
OUT AND SHOW THESE NERVOUS 

01:09:24.011 --> 01:09:26.011
MOTORS I CAN BE PRESIDENTIAL. 
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE WILL DECLARE VICTORY

01:09:26.019 --> 01:09:30.091
EVEN SOMEONE WHO UNDERPERFORMS 
AND TONIGHT THEY WILL SPEAK TO 

01:09:30.303 --> 01:09:32.331
THE SUPPORTERS AND SAY THIS IS 
FANTASTIC. WE DID AMAZING ON 

01:09:32.528 --> 01:09:34.528
THIS METRIC. NO ONE WOULD HAVE 

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:39.470
THOUGHT THAT. RIVAL CAMPAIGNS, 
MOST CAMPAIGNS BELIEVE BERNIE 

01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:44.670
SANDERS CONS AND WITH AN EDGE ON
THE FIRST METRIC THAT HE WILL BE

01:09:44.893 --> 01:09:48.246
ABLE TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE 
FOR HIM ON THE FIRST BALLOT. 

01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:50.444
WHAT THE OTHER CAMPAIGNS HAVE 
BEEN WARNING REPORTERS ABOUT AND

01:09:50.869 --> 01:09:52.869
WORRYING ABOUT IS THAT THE 
SANDERS CAMPAIGN WILL COME OUT 

01:09:53.003 --> 01:09:56.364
ONCE WE GET THE FIRST NUMBER AND
THAT BERNIE SANDERS WILL DECLARE

01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:58.571
VICTORY 

01:10:00.006 --> 01:10:02.545
AND SAY, I GOT THE MOST PEOPLE 
BUT HE WON'T GET THE MOST 

01:10:02.752 --> 01:10:04.752
DELEGATES OR THE MOST STATE 
DELEGATE EQUIVALENTS BUT HE WILL

01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:08.751
USE THAT. SOME OF THIS IS 
MANAGING EXPECTATIONS. YOU COULD

01:10:08.959 --> 01:10:10.959
CONCEIVE HIM SAYING MORE PEOPLE 
SHOWED UP 

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:17.779
TO VOTE OR CAUCUS FOR ME THAN 
ANYONE ELSE, HOW IS THAT NOT A 

01:10:17.982 --> 01:10:20.009
VICTORY AND THEN YOU CONCEIVE A 
SCENARIO WHERE SOMEONE ELSE KIND

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.458
OF WANTS THE SORTING HAPPENS AND
PEOPLE GO TO THEIR SECOND CHOICE

01:10:22.659 --> 01:10:24.659
THEY OVERTAKE SOMEONE LIKE 
SANDERS. THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. 

01:10:26.825 --> 01:10:28.825
TO THAT, IT'S THE 

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:33.742
JUMP BALL. THEY ARE ALL GOING TO
NEW HAMPSHIRE TO TRY TO CLAIM 

01:10:33.944 --> 01:10:36.172
MOMENTUM. ANOTHER POINT TO MAKE 
BECAUSE WE SHOWED THE GREAT 

01:10:36.374 --> 01:10:40.443
PRESENTATION ABOUT DELEGATES. 
WAITING IN THE WINGS HERE IS 

01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:42.892
WORTH MENTIONING IS MIKE 
BLOOMBERG. THERE ARE 40 SOME 

01:10:44.896 --> 01:10:46.896
DELEGATES TONIGHT AND IT'S 
POSSIBLE AS JEREMY SAID, THREE 

01:10:47.345 --> 01:10:49.345
DIFFERENT PEOPLE COULD GET 

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:53.199
10 DELEGATES. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG 
IS SKIPPING THE FIRST FOUR STATE

01:10:53.234 --> 01:10:56.297
SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  ON
THOSE SUPER TUESDAY STATES AS 

01:10:56.501 --> 01:10:58.501
YOU EXPLAINED HOW IMPORTANT THEY
ARE AND WHAT MICHAEL BLOOMBERG 

01:10:58.668 --> 01:11:00.668
ONCE  IS IT FOR ME TO BE A 

01:11:04.805 --> 01:11:06.437
VERY SCATTERSHOT DECISION WHERE 
EVERYONE CAN CREDIBLY CLAIM 

01:11:06.438 --> 01:11:09.773
VICTORY, KNOW WHEN EMERGES 
STRONG. BLOOMBERG WOULD WANT JOE

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:12.428
BIDEN TO UNDERPERFORM IN LOOK 
VERY WEAK  SO HE CAN BE OF 

01:11:14.359 --> 01:11:16.991
ESTABLISH CANDIDATE. TO STOP 
BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH 

01:11:17.198 --> 01:11:20.446
WARREN, HE IS SOMEONE YOU CANNOT
WRITE OFF. MICHAEL BENNET  ALSO 

01:11:20.655 --> 01:11:27.357
NOT HERE COMPETING NEW 
HAMPSHIRE, HE IS A MODERATE 

01:11:27.563 --> 01:11:30.006
SENATOR HOPING BIDEN AND IN SOME
WAYS BUTTIGIEG UNDERPERFORM  SO 

01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:32.660
HE CAN GET A LITTLE LIFT OFF 
DURING THE WEEK BETWEEN IOWA AND

01:11:33.244 --> 01:11:36.898
NEW HAMPSHIRE. THERE'S AN 
EXPECTATION BUT WE WILL, EVEN 

01:11:37.108 --> 01:11:40.962
THOUGH EVERYONE WILL CLAIM 
VICTORY IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ONE OR

01:11:41.265 --> 01:11:44.427
TWO PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGNS WILL 
FUNCTIONALLY END TONIGHT. THEY 

01:11:44.628 --> 01:11:46.877
WON'T DROP OUT TONIGHT OR 
WHATEVER, BUT THEIR MONEY WILL 

01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:51.734
DRY UP. THEY WON'T GET PEOPLE. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS ARE 

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:54.982
STRATEGIC. THEY ARE WATCHING 
WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE SAYING IN 

01:11:55.187 --> 01:12:00.052
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS IOWA PICKS CORN
NEW HAMPSHIRE PICKS PRESIDENT'S.

01:12:00.261 --> 01:12:02.261
&gt;&gt; THEY LIKE THE 

01:12:05.953 --> 01:12:07.802
HEALTHY COMPETITION. 
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE WATCHING AND SO ALL 

01:12:07.803 --> 01:12:11.043
OF THOSE THINGS ARE HOVERING 
OVER AND ULTIMATELY THE MOMENTUM

01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:15.289
AND THE PERCEPTION IS WHAT 
MATTERS MORE THAN THE DELEGATES,

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:17.734
BECAUSE YOU NEED 1800 DELEGATES 
IN THERE ARE 40 UP FOR GRABS 

01:12:17.936 --> 01:12:19.936
TODAY. IT DOES SET THE TONE.
&gt;&gt; WE WILL 

01:12:24.368 --> 01:12:27.130
TALK MORE. PROFESSOR HOLD ON I 
WANT TO SPEAK MORE WITH ALL OF 

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:30.008
YOU ABOUT WHO HAS TO DO WELL AND
WHO IS SUPER VULNERABLE. I WANT 

01:12:30.202 --> 01:12:32.202
TO REMIND EVERYONE WE HAVE 
REPORTERS ACROSS THE STATE AT 

01:12:32.283 --> 01:12:36.730
CAUCUS SITES. LET'S CHECK BEGIN 
WITH JOYCE KOH IN COUNCIL BLUFFS

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:41.086
AND SOUTHWEST IOWA. PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP WON IN 2016 BUT 

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.935
IT'S AN AREA WHERE CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND TRADE WARS HAVE HAD A

01:12:44.144 --> 01:12:49.083
MAJOR IMPACT OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS. JOYCE, AS YOU TALK TO 

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.282
VOTERS ARE THEY CHANGING THEIR 
MIND ABOUT THE 

01:12:55.649 --> 01:12:57.649
PRESIDENT?
&gt;&gt; Reporter:

01:12:59.565 --> 01:13:02.068
LIBBY, I HAVE YET TO TALK TO A 
DEMOCRATIC OFFICER WHO IS A 

01:13:02.269 --> 01:13:04.083
FORMER TRUMP SUPPORTER. WE HAVE 
RUN INTO SEVERAL FORMER 

01:13:04.084 --> 01:13:05.897
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OUT HERE 
CAUCUSING, TONIGHT. MAINLY FOUND

01:13:05.898 --> 01:13:08.112
IN THE BUTTIGIEG CAMP.  THAT'S 
INTERESTING TO NOTE OUT OF THIS 

01:13:08.311 --> 01:13:10.809
VERY RED AREA OF IOWA LIKE YOU 
SAID IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT

01:13:11.006 --> 01:13:14.803
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WON IN 
IOWA HANDEDLY LARGELY BECAUSE OF

01:13:15.415 --> 01:13:20.812
AREAS LIKE COUNCIL BLUFFS. BACK 
IN 2016 HE WON THE REPUBLICAN 

01:13:21.014 --> 01:13:23.014
PRIMARY HERE 

01:13:24.553 --> 01:13:26.604
AS WELL. SPEAKING OF PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP, HE WAS IN IOWA 

01:13:26.806 --> 01:13:30.043
JUST DAYS BEFORE THE CAUCUS. HE 
HELD A RALLY IN DES MOINES WHERE

01:13:30.245 --> 01:13:33.912
HE TALKED ABOUT THE CAUCUSES. 
HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT

01:13:34.117 --> 01:13:37.956
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.
&gt;&gt; LET'S VOTE FOR POCAHONTAS. 

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:45.274
LET'S VOTE FOR BERNIE. LET'S 
VOTE FOR SLEEPY JOE. 

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:53.191
JOE, OH. HOW ABOUT BUTTIGIEG .  
BUTTIGIEG , THEY CALL HIM MAYOR 

01:13:53.408 --> 01:13:57.664
PETE DO YOU KNOW WHY? NOBODY CAN
PRONOUNCE HIS NAME. NOBODY HAS 

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:02.839
ANY IDEAS. BUTTIGIEG. WE ARE 
GOING TO IN THE GREAT STATE OF 

01:14:03.962 --> 01:14:07.814
IOWA . AND IT IS GOING TO BE A 
HISTORIC LANDSLIDE.

01:14:07.815 --> 01:14:10.265
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE HEAR A LOT OF 

01:14:14.932 --> 01:14:17.068
THAT NAME-CALLING. THAT RESPONSE
FROM THE CROWD WHEN HE IS SO 

01:14:17.271 --> 01:14:19.629
CONFIDENTLY SAYING HE WILL IN IN
NOVEMBER AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY 

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.286
THE CONSENSUS AMONG A LOT OF THE
TRUMP SUPPORTERS WE SPOKE TO AT 

01:14:24.486 --> 01:14:28.845
THAT RALLY. WE ASKED THEM IF 
THERE ARE ANY DEMOCRATIC 

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040
CANDIDATES THAT THEY THINK 
POSING A THREAT TO TRUMP. THEY 

01:14:31.119 --> 01:14:34.021
SORT OF LAUGHED THAT QUESTION 
AND SAY NO, THEY THINK THE 

01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:38.597
INCUMBENT HAS IT. ONE OF THE 
THING TO MENTION, SPECIFICALLY 

01:14:38.794 --> 01:14:41.741
HERE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS, WE WERE 
WALKING DOWNTOWN THE OTHER DAY 

01:14:41.946 --> 01:14:43.986
AND TRYING TO TALK TO SOME 
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS THERE'S. WE 

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:47.636
RAN INTO MORE TRUMP SUPPORTERS 
WHO WEREN'T CAUCUSING AND 

01:14:47.837 --> 01:14:49.837
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WHO WERE. THAT

01:14:52.107 --> 01:14:54.942
TELLS YOU HOW READ THIS AREA IS 
AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 

01:14:55.159 --> 01:14:59.500
SEE IF A MORE MODERATE CANDIDATE
WINDS OUT OF THIS MORE RED AREA 

01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:01.703
OF 

01:15:04.081 --> 01:15:05.510
IOWA. LIBBY
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. THERE ARE KEY 

01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:07.952
CHANGES IN THE CAUCUS RULES THIS
YEAR. FOR MORE ON THAT LET'S GO 

01:15:08.157 --> 01:15:11.200
BACK TO HANNA JEWELL WHO'S JUST 
SOUTH FROM US AT DRAKE 

01:15:12.211 --> 01:15:14.211
UNIVERSITY 

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.444
.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TEENS ARE REALLY 

01:15:18.445 --> 01:15:20.567
STARTING TO MOVE PEOPLE ARE 
MOVING OUT OF THE BLEACHERS AND 

01:15:20.769 --> 01:15:22.769
STARTING TO CAUCUS FOR 
CANDIDATES. WE SEE A LOT OF 

01:15:22.797 --> 01:15:25.817
SUPPORT FOR SANDERS AND PETE 
BUTTIGIEG AND WARREN .  WE ARE 

01:15:26.027 --> 01:15:28.262
STANDING NEXT TO THE BENNET 
CROWD.  KNOWN FOR HIM YET AND 

01:15:28.468 --> 01:15:32.937
WHO KNOWS. NOBODY FOR BLOOMBERG 
SO FAR NOT EVERYONE IS IN PLACE 

01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:39.026
AND NO ONE FIRST IR. I'VE HEARD 
A LOT ABOUT NEW HAMPSHIRE SO 

01:15:39.227 --> 01:15:42.592
USED TO GETTING THAT 
FACE-TO-FACE CONDUCT BUT SOME 

01:15:42.792 --> 01:15:46.338
WERE OFFENDED BY CAMPAIGNS WHO 
FOCUS ON ADVERTISING BECAUSE THE

01:15:46.532 --> 01:15:49.993
CAUCUS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON HAVING
PRECINCT CAPTAINS WITH HUNDREDS 

01:15:50.599 --> 01:15:56.000
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WILLING TO DO A LOT OF WORK FOR 

01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:58.201
YOUR CAMPAIGN. THERE ARE CHANGES

01:16:00.552 --> 01:16:02.806
WE MENTIONED THERE WILL BE MORE 
DATA AVAILABLE THAT CAN LEAD TO 

01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:05.008
MULTIPLE CAMPAIGNS CLIMBING ONE 
VICTORY ANOTHER. ANOTHER CHANGE 

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.666
THIS YEAR IS THE RESULT OF 2016 
THERE WERE CLOSED 

01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:12.704
CAUCUSES BETWEEN CLINTON AND 
SANDERS AND THERE WAS NOTE WAY 

01:16:13.141 --> 01:16:17.631
TO CHECK. SANDERS SUPPORTERS 
CRITIQUED 

01:16:21.876 --> 01:16:24.320
IT SO PEOPLE GET PAPER WHEN THEY
COME IN AND MARKED THEIR FIRST 

01:16:24.523 --> 01:16:26.646
CHOICE AND HANDED OVER AFTER THE
FIRST COUNT. THEY THEN REALIGNED

01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:30.215
AND MARKED THEIR SECOND CHOICE 
IN HAND THAT OVER, IF SOMEONE 

01:16:30.412 --> 01:16:32.843
GETS MAD AT SOMEONE ELSE WE CAN 
GO AND SEE THAT PAPER TRAIL. 

01:16:33.057 --> 01:16:35.057
ANOTHER CHANGES 

01:16:36.711 --> 01:16:39.050
THERE ARE SATELLITE CAUCUSES FOR
PEOPLE WHO CANNOT MAKE IT IN A 

01:16:39.249 --> 01:16:41.875
NIGHT OR AT THE PLACE.  THERE IS
ONE IN PARIS AND THERE'S ONE 

01:16:42.074 --> 01:16:44.432
HERE EARLIER TODAY WITH 
DELEGATES GOING TO SANDERS AND 

01:16:44.639 --> 01:16:48.300
WARREN. A BIGGER CROWD TONIGHT. 
A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR PETE 

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:54.383
BUTTIGIEG AND  ELIZABETH WARREN.
I SPOKE TO A SAD CLUB SURE 

01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:56.618
SUPPORTER AND SAID HE COMES FROM
A MIDDLE 

01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:02.205
BACK ROUND. HE SAID WITH THE 
STUDENTS IT'S MORE WEALTHY AND 

01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:06.969
PEOPLE ARE NOT OR HE SAID HE DID
NOT RELATE TO THEM ON A CLASS 

01:17:07.182 --> 01:17:09.414
BASIS AND HE SEES THAT AS A 
SOURCE OF SUPPORT FOR BUTTIGIEG 

01:17:09.616 --> 01:17:16.122
AND WARREN  AND THERE ARE ONLY A
FEW, BIDEN AND KLOBUCHAR DON'T 

01:17:16.325 --> 01:17:18.570
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE NECESSARILY 
GOING TO BE VIABLE. WE DID SEE 

01:17:18.791 --> 01:17:23.836
THEM JOINING EARLIER. WE WILL 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE 

01:17:24.037 --> 01:17:27.294
RE-ALIGNMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. JOYCE KOH WAS 

01:17:27.492 --> 01:17:29.492
TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT DONALD 

01:17:31.954 --> 01:17:33.954
TRUMP AND AT DRAKE UNIVERSITY IS
WHERE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.083
JUST AT A RALLY. YOU WERE THERE 

01:17:38.456 --> 01:17:41.122
EUGENE . DID YOU GET THE SENSE 
OF HOW THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE

01:17:41.319 --> 01:17:43.038
AS TRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE 
THINKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC 

01:17:43.039 --> 01:17:45.492
CAUCUS IN THE PROCESS? DID THEY 
SEE IT AS A THREAT? JOYCE SEEM 

01:17:45.699 --> 01:17:48.002
TO THINK PEOPLE WERE NOT 
CONCERNED. 

01:17:48.003 --> 01:17:52.070
&gt;&gt; THEY DID NOT IN THE LOT OF 
THAT HAS TO DO WITH, I SAY THIS 

01:17:52.273 --> 01:17:54.707
RESPECTFULLY, WE HAVE ENOUGH 
RESEARCH TO SHOW CONSERVATIVES 

01:17:54.916 --> 01:17:56.916
CONSUME MEDIA AND 

01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:02.783
HAVE A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN 
TRUMP BASED OFF OF THAT. SOME 

01:18:02.993 --> 01:18:06.077
THINGS THAT HAVE BROUGHT PEOPLE 
THE AWARENESS OR THE IDEA THAT 

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:09.746
TRUMP PERHAPS IS NOT AS STRONG 
AS SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS THINK 

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:15.332
HE IS OUR NOT BEING REPORTED ON 
FOX NEWS IN THE TRUMP FRIENDLY 

01:18:15.537 --> 01:18:17.872
OUTLETS. THEY'RE CONFIDENT THAT 
TRUMP WILL PREVAIL 

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:24.131
IN NOVEMBER. THE THING THAT'S 
FASCINATING ABOUT THAT IS I 

01:18:24.186 --> 01:18:27.815
SPENT OUT TIME AND THERE WERE 
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF 

01:18:28.035 --> 01:18:31.075
PROTESTERS. GRANTED THIS WAS THE
UNIVERSITY AND MILLENNIALS IN 

01:18:33.299 --> 01:18:37.279
YOUNGER PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THE 
MOST PRO-TRUMP ENVIRONMENT. 

01:18:37.477 --> 01:18:39.480
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE WONDER 
IF SOME OF THOSE VOTERS WHO 

01:18:44.412 --> 01:18:46.412
SAY TRUMP

01:18:48.335 --> 01:18:50.367
REALIZES THERE ARE VOTERS IN 
THEIR OWN COMMUNITY WHO ARE NOT 

01:18:50.578 --> 01:18:53.826
SO SUPPORTIVE OF TRUMP THAT THEY
WOULD STAND OUTSIDE AND 25 

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.029
DEGREE WEATHER ON THURSDAY TO 
COMMUNICATE THAT THEY BELIEVE HE

01:18:56.056 --> 01:18:59.994
SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE. 
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR McCORMICK HOW DOES 

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:02.190
THE SPECTER OF THE 2016 ELECTION
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AFFECT 

01:19:02.219 --> 01:19:04.219
CAUCUS 

01:19:07.154 --> 01:19:09.083
GOERS? 
&gt;&gt;  IT'S A MAJOR FORCE IT'S THE 

01:19:09.084 --> 01:19:11.084
THING THAT IS PROPELLING THEM 
NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF 

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:13.310
PARTICIPATION BUT IN TERMS OF 
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER 

01:19:13.522 --> 01:19:18.190
ELECTABILITY. THE SORT OF 
VISCERAL DISLIKE, IT'S THAT THE 

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:21.042
EUPHEMISM OF PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP I THINK IT DRIVES A LOT OF

01:19:23.273 --> 01:19:25.273
DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS. ALSO, 

01:19:28.543 --> 01:19:30.543
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORTERS. I THINK 
IT ALSO GETS TO WHAT WAS 

01:19:30.662 --> 01:19:35.255
SUGGESTED EARLIER IN TERMS OF 
THE SUBURBS. THAT HAS MOVED AWAY

01:19:35.457 --> 01:19:37.509
FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WE
SAW THAT IN 2018. 

01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:40.052
&gt;&gt; IN THE MIDTERMS. 
&gt;&gt; YES AND THAT WILL BE THE BIG 

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:45.239
TURNING POINT. I THINK IT'S KIND
OF INTERESTING THAT IN SOME 

01:19:45.444 --> 01:19:47.444
REPORTS CAN COMMENT 

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:52.925
BUT BIDEN WENT OUT TO SOME OF 
WESTERN IOWA IN THE REPUBLICAN 

01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:55.369
AREAS TO SEE IN THOSE RURAL 
AREAS IF HE COULD GET SUFFICIENT

01:19:55.569 --> 01:20:00.334
NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO CAUCUS. YOU 
PROBABLY COULD NOT DO DRAKE 

01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:05.314
UNIVERSITY AND THAT  WHOLE 
ENVIRONMENT. IT WON'T BE AN AREA

01:20:05.518 --> 01:20:08.765
WHERE AS THE REPORTER SUGGESTED 
WHERE BIDEN IS GOING TO DO VERY 

01:20:08.983 --> 01:20:12.098
WELL. 
&gt;&gt; SO WESTERN IOWA IS THE MORE 

01:20:12.299 --> 01:20:14.299
CONSERVATIVE PART OF 

01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:18.319
THE STATE.  IT'S CLOSER TO 
NEBRASKA. EASTERN IOWA IS THE 

01:20:18.517 --> 01:20:22.069
MORE DEMOCRATIC PART OF THE 
STATE . IT'S ALONG THE 

01:20:22.269 --> 01:20:24.134
MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN. IT'S 
MORE BLUE-COLLAR AND IT'S MUCH 

01:20:24.135 --> 01:20:27.054
MORE CATHOLIC. ACTUALLY, IT'S 
CLOSER TO ILLINOIS. THOSE ARE 

01:20:29.087 --> 01:20:31.124
ANCESTRAL DEMOCRATS. ABOUT ONE 
THIRD OF IOWA'S  COUNTIES VOTED 

01:20:35.174 --> 01:20:38.428
FOR BARACK OBAMA IN 2008 AND 
2012 AND THEN VOTED TRUMP IN 

01:20:38.628 --> 01:20:40.664
2016. PART OF THE ELECTABILITY 
PITCH MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER 

01:20:40.868 --> 01:20:44.532
STATE, MOORE COUNTY SLIPPED. 
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE 99 COUNTIES 

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:50.135
IN IOWA.
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WAYS THE 

01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:53.051
CANDIDATES HAVE MADE THE 
ELECTABILITY WE'VE BEEN TALKING 

01:20:53.252 --> 01:20:55.252
ABOUT IS TO GO TO THOSE 
COLONIES. 

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:01.819
YOU SAW PETE BUTTIGIEG DID A 
RALLY YESTERDAY MORNING IN ONE 

01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:05.449
OF THOSE COUNTIES AND SAID I CAN
WIN HERE . AND BERNIE SANDERS 

01:21:05.649 --> 01:21:10.815
COULD NOT. YOU'VE SEEN JOE BIDEN
GO FOR WESTERN IOWA.  SOME OF MY

01:21:11.018 --> 01:21:13.240
AMY KLOBUCHAR WILL NOT DO WELL 
ON A  DRAKE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS 

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:17.021
BUT SHE NEEDS TO DO WELL  AT THE
COUNCIL BLUFFS POLLING SITE THAT

01:21:17.222 --> 01:21:21.200
WE HAVE SOMEONE AT. IF SHE ISN'T
DOING WELL THERE IS NOT GOING TO

01:21:21.399 --> 01:21:23.399
BE A GOOD THING. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO JEREMY 

01:21:23.403 --> 01:21:25.403
BAUDER'S IN 

01:21:28.311 --> 01:21:31.342
THE STUDIO WITH THE TEAM TO 
BREAK DOWN THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE 

01:21:31.536 --> 01:21:32.955
STATE AND HOW THAT COULD INDEED 
INFLUENCE TONIGHT.

01:21:32.956 --> 01:21:35.176
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANK YOU LIBBY. 
THIS IS THE MAP YOU'VE SEEN ALL 

01:21:35.386 --> 01:21:38.753
NIGHT. IT'S IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES 
IN 1680 SOMETHING PRECINCTS. 

01:21:38.957 --> 01:21:43.307
IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED. 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT IT THAT 

01:21:43.502 --> 01:21:48.502
WE FIND SO INTERESTING IS THAT 
THERE ARE LARGE AREAS OF URBAN 

01:21:48.706 --> 01:21:52.478
VOTERS AND THERE ARE VAST SLOTS 
OF RURAL AREAS. TO GET A BETTER 

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:56.238
HANDLE ON WHAT IOWA IS REALLY 
LIKE WE WANT TO TALK YOU THROUGH

01:21:56.437 --> 01:22:00.490
THE POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE 
STATE. SOME OF WHAT THIS MEANS 

01:22:00.696 --> 01:22:04.553
IS FINDING THOSE AREAS WHERE WE 
HAVE LARGE GROUPS OF LIKE 

01:22:04.756 --> 01:22:06.987
VOTERS. THOSE FOUR AREAS WE WILL
TALK ABOUT TONIGHT ARE THE BIG 

01:22:07.187 --> 01:22:09.631
CITY OF DES MOINES. THE LIBERAL 
ARCHIPELAGO THAT VOTED LARGELY 

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:13.422
SANDERS IN 2016. WE HAVE THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER CORRIDOR IN 

01:22:13.616 --> 01:22:17.565
THE FAR EAST AND OUT WEST WHICH 
IS RURAL. LET'S GET STARTED AND 

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:22.020
LOOK AT THAT CITY OF DES MOINES.
THE DEAL ABOUT DES MOINES IS 

01:22:22.225 --> 01:22:26.489
IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE VOTERS
THAT WILL VOTE IN THE CAUCUS 

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.733
TONIGHT. IT'S A BIG TARGET AND 
INVITING IF YOUR POLITICIAN IS 

01:22:28.934 --> 01:22:33.187
LOOKING TO TRY TO WINDOW IN THE 
CONVENTION BUT YOU WANT TO BE 

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:35.491
CAREFUL. MARCO RUBIO SPEND A TON
OF 

01:22:39.072 --> 01:22:41.356
TIME HERE IN WON THE CITY AND 
MANY OF THE OUTLYING COUNTIES 

01:22:41.569 --> 01:22:43.860
BUT FAILED TO WHEN THE STATE. 
THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN 

01:22:44.065 --> 01:22:46.065
TO A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IF 
THEY AREN'T CAREFUL. NEXT, WE 

01:22:46.187 --> 01:22:50.054
WILL LOOK AT THE LIVE LIBERAL 
ARCHIPELAGO IT'S UNIVERSITY 

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.265
TOWNS LIKE HERE IN 

01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:58.378
IOWA CITY WHERE WE HAVE THE 
UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. THESE ARE 

01:22:58.579 --> 01:23:00.620
YOUNGER FOLKS. THERE ARE 10,000 
COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IT'S A MIX 

01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:04.057
OF URBAN AND SUBURBAN VOTERS, 
WHO WILL SUPPORT SANDERS IN 

01:23:04.258 --> 01:23:07.206
2016. THE DEAL IS SANDERS DOES 
NOT HAVE THE SAME SUPPORT THIS 

01:23:07.407 --> 01:23:10.977
YEAR THAT HE WOULD EXPECT 
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER 

01:23:11.191 --> 01:23:13.809
CANDIDATES IN HIS LANE. HE'S GOT
FOLKS LIKE ANDREW YANG, 

01:23:16.244 --> 01:23:19.494
ELIZABETH WARREN HEAR PEOPLE 
NIPPING AT HIS HEELS AND EVEN 

01:23:19.707 --> 01:23:21.707
THOSE PETE BUTTIGIEG PULLING 
HIM. WE WILL LOOK AT THE 

01:23:21.794 --> 01:23:24.408
MISSISSIPPI RIVER  CORRIDOR THIS
IS TRADITIONAL FAIRLY 

01:23:24.618 --> 01:23:26.618
DEMOCRATIC, IT'S BLUE COLLAR 
VOTERS AND IT'S 

01:23:30.665 --> 01:23:32.958
FOLKS WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP IN 
2016 AFTER VOTING FOR OBAMA IN 

01:23:33.161 --> 01:23:38.309
2012. THIS AREA WAS A CRAZY 
FLIP. THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR US. 

01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:43.066
FINALLY WE WILL LOOK AT THAT 
ROLE LAST. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF 

01:23:43.272 --> 01:23:45.513
DEMOCRATS OUT HERE IT'S A LOT OF
REPUBLICANS BUT IT'S A GREAT 

01:23:45.725 --> 01:23:49.788
PLACE TO SHAKE HANDS WITH PEOPLE
WHO'VE BEEN AFFECT DID BY THE 

01:23:49.986 --> 01:23:51.986
PRESIDENT STRAIGHT POLICIES. 
WITH THAT WE WILL KICK IT BACK 

01:23:52.037 --> 01:23:54.446
TO YOU IN IOWA, LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. PROFESSOR 

01:23:54.646 --> 01:23:57.894
McCORMICK YOU'VE COVERED THE 
IOWA CAUCUSES FOR DEER I SAY, 

01:23:58.193 --> 01:23:59.913
DECADES. 
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY FOR DECADES. 

01:23:59.914 --> 01:24:04.795
&gt;&gt; WHAT HE WATCHING FOR TONIGHT?
BUT WHAT I REALLY WATCHING FOR 

01:24:05.002 --> 01:24:09.162
IS THE MULTIPLICITY OF 
CANDIDATES THAT WILL CLAIM 

01:24:09.369 --> 01:24:12.547
SUCCESS OUT OF THIS. THIS IS 
VERY UNUSUAL. ARE USUALLY SAY 

01:24:12.746 --> 01:24:16.816
OUT OF IOWA THERE ARE THREE 
TICKETS. 

01:24:16.817 --> 01:24:18.838
&gt;&gt; IN THE SENSE LIKE YOU GET 
ONTO THE NEXT? 

01:24:18.839 --> 01:24:21.140
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THREE TICKETS 
AND IF YOU DO WELL YOU CAN 

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:25.311
PROCEED. THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO 
THAT WAS JOHN McCAIN WHEN HE 

01:24:25.514 --> 01:24:30.299
CAME IN 4th INNING MENTALLY WON 
THE NOMINATION. IN FACT, THESE 

01:24:30.497 --> 01:24:33.230
NUMBER OF VOTES WE WILL HAVE 
SOME OF THESE TWO REPORTING 

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:38.539
THESE VOTES ARE GOING TO REALLY 
ALLOW CANDIDATES TO MAKE CLAIMS 

01:24:38.735 --> 01:24:43.518
THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING IN 
PREVIOUS YEARS. THAT WILL MARK A

01:24:43.734 --> 01:24:45.734
DIFFERENCE FOR THE CAUCUSES AND 
WHETHER THAT WILL BE SOMETHING 

01:24:45.757 --> 01:24:50.504
THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE. THE 
OTHER MESSAGE THAT I THINK WE 

01:24:50.703 --> 01:24:52.703
WANT TO FOCUS IN ON IS TO WHAT 

01:24:56.392 --> 01:24:58.741
EXTENT WILL THE MEDIA DECLARE A 
WINNER OUT OF THIS? THEY ALWAYS 

01:24:58.948 --> 01:25:00.948
HAVE IN THE PAST SAID THAT SOME 
CANDIDATES EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.335
THAT HE OR SHE DID MUCH BETTER 
THAN THEY EXPECTED TO DO AND 

01:25:06.547 --> 01:25:11.220
THAT THEY EXHIBITED PARTICULAR 
STRENGTHS AS WE WERE TALKING 

01:25:11.423 --> 01:25:15.484
ABOUT WITH EUGENE IN TERMS OF 
PARTICULAR GROUPS OR 

01:25:15.685 --> 01:25:17.685
CONSTITUENCIES I THINK THAT IS 
THE OTHER KIND OF INTERESTING 

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:22.788
THING I WANT TO LOOK AT. 
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A QUESTION OF HOW 

01:25:23.003 --> 01:25:26.255
THE NATIONAL MEDIA FOCUS AFFECT 
THINGS AND HOW MUCH 

01:25:30.923 --> 01:25:33.065
THAT IMPACTS IOWA. SO MUCH GREAT
LOCAL JOURNALISM TEACHES US SO 

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.074
MUCH BUT THOUSANDS OF 
JOURNALISTS AROUND THE WORLD . 

01:25:35.075 --> 01:25:37.514
&gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH WE 
LOVE THE NATIONAL MEDIA. 

01:25:37.515 --> 01:25:40.092
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE VERY GRACIOUS HOST. 
&gt;&gt; THEY SORT OF TAKE OVER 

01:25:43.312 --> 01:25:47.579
THE STATE AT LEAST FOR A MONTH, 
IT SEEMS TO ME BEFORE THE 

01:25:47.786 --> 01:25:49.786
CAUCUSES AND OBVIOUSLY BEFORE 
THAT AS WELL. I THINK THE 

01:25:49.814 --> 01:25:53.266
NATIONAL MEDIA CAN REALLY 
MAGNIFY THE RESULTS HERE. I 

01:25:55.903 --> 01:25:59.352
MEAN, SOME OR CERTAINLY THE 
PUBLIC WILL LOVE THAT THEY ARE 

01:25:59.564 --> 01:26:02.232
TREATED TO THIS KIND OF NATIONAL
ATTENTION. WE ARE USUALLY 

01:26:03.017 --> 01:26:07.897
CONSIDERED THIS SMALL, ISOLATED 
STATE. IT'S A FLYOVER STATE AND 

01:26:08.098 --> 01:26:12.159
FOR A BRIEF SHINING MOMENT, WE 
ARE NOT THE FLYOVER STATE. WE 

01:26:12.364 --> 01:26:17.551
ARE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. 
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH IS NOT HAVING THE 

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:19.564
DES MOINES REGISTER POLL COME 
OUT THIS WEEKEND CHANGING 

01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:21.918
PEOPLE'S CALCULATIONS ON THE 
NARRATIVE? 

01:26:21.919 --> 01:26:27.514
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT WAS A MAJOR KIND
OF DIFFICULTY, REALLY. BECAUSE 

01:26:27.722 --> 01:26:33.086
THE REGISTER POLL HAS BEEN LOOK 
AT AS SUCH A MODEL OF IMPORTANCE

01:26:33.282 --> 01:26:39.478
IN TERMS OF PREDICT DURING AND 
IN THE PAST REGISTERS POLLS AT 

01:26:39.704 --> 01:26:41.727
LEAST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL 
HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXACTLY ON THE 

01:26:41.937 --> 01:26:44.453
MARK. SO IT HAS A LOT OF 
CREDIBILITY. THE FACT THAT IT 

01:26:44.654 --> 01:26:49.128
DID NOT COME OUT, THAT THERE WAS
A HICCUP IN TERMS OF APPARENTLY 

01:26:49.435 --> 01:26:55.424
IN THE SURVEY, IN TERMS OF 
RESPONDENTS. I THINK THAT THAT 

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:59.785
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IOWANS 
WILL TALK ABOUT CONSTANTLY AS A 

01:26:59.979 --> 01:27:01.979
SOURCE 

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:05.149
OF PRIDE. 
&gt;&gt; AND IT WAS INDEED A CONCERN 

01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:07.201
ABOUT HOW THE QUESTION WAS 
PRESENTED. 

01:27:07.202 --> 01:27:10.851
&gt;&gt; AND APPARENTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
ACCORDING TO THE POLLSTER WHO IS

01:27:11.152 --> 01:27:15.539
AMAZING. THE PERSON WHO WAS IN 
THE CALL CENTER CALLING TO DO 

01:27:16.951 --> 01:27:19.391
THE POLL. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO 
SEE THE NAMES THEY EXPANDED THE 

01:27:19.586 --> 01:27:23.305
FONT. IN THAT PUSHED PETE 
BUTTIGIEG'S NAME  AT LEAST IN 

01:27:23.854 --> 01:27:27.314
ONE SURVEY OFF THE LIST OF NAMES
READ. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS A 

01:27:27.514 --> 01:27:31.689
BUTTIGIEG SUPPORTER GOT  A CALL 
FROM THE POLLSTER AND THEY DID 

01:27:32.598 --> 01:27:37.061
NOT OFFER BUTTIGIEG AS AN OPTION
. THEY CALLED THE CAMPAIGN AND 

01:27:37.265 --> 01:27:39.904
THE CAMPAIGN CALLED THE POLLSTER
AND THEN THE POLLSTER REALIZED 

01:27:40.105 --> 01:27:42.639
THAT AND CANCELED THE ENTIRE 
POLL. 

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CHANGED IT. 
PROFESSOR McCORMICK THANK YOU . 

01:27:47.424 --> 01:27:52.090
JAMES HOMAN, SCOTT IN EUGENE. 
AND YOU AS WELL. WE WILL WATCH 

01:27:52.291 --> 01:27:54.640

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLE AND 

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.841
WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE YOU WITH

LIKE TO WELCOME MY GUEST BUT 
FIRST YOU SEE THESE IMAGES FROM 

01:29:58.224 --> 01:30:02.303
AROUND THE STATE OF IOWA. JAMES 
HOMAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

01:30:02.521 --> 01:30:07.979
EUGENE SCOTT AND HELLO IOWA 
STATE PROFESSOR OF 

01:30:12.651 --> 01:30:14.692
POLITICAL SCIENCE. WE LEFT THIS 
OFF IN THE LAST HOUR TALKING 

01:30:14.891 --> 01:30:19.650
ABOUT THE CAUCUSES AND WHAT A 
NOVEL AND INTERESTING AN AMAZING

01:30:19.864 --> 01:30:23.007
DEMOCRACY IT IS BUT THERE ARE 
SOME CRITICISMS. WHILE THIS 

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.220
BRINGS PEOPLE OUT AND CAUSES 
THEM TO GET TOGETHER 

01:30:28.492 --> 01:30:30.444
WITH THEIR COMMUNITY AND 
NEIGHBORS IN STATE WHO THEY 

01:30:30.445 --> 01:30:32.770
BELIEVE SHOULD BE THE NEXT 
PRESIDENT, IT ALSO HAS DRAWBACKS

01:30:32.979 --> 01:30:37.045
IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY AND IN
JUST YOU CAN PARTICIPATE TALK TO

01:30:37.256 --> 01:30:39.256
ME ABOUT 

01:30:41.299 --> 01:30:43.211
THAT DICHOTOMY. 
&gt;&gt; THERE IS AN IDEA THAT NOT 

01:30:43.212 --> 01:30:45.369
EVERYONE IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THE CAUCUSES WHO WANTS TO. 

01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:47.570
ONE THING I SAW IN THE LAST 

01:30:50.433 --> 01:30:52.433
24 HOURS THAT WAS VERY 
INTERESTING IS THAT THE WARREN 

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.144
CAMPAIGN HAS VOLUNTEERS 
PROVIDING CHILDCARE. IF YOU ARE 

01:30:54.145 --> 01:30:57.394
A SINGLE PARENT AND YOU WANT TO 
CAUCUS AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN 

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.211
OPTION FOR CHILDCARE, THAT CAN 
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU 

01:31:01.412 --> 01:31:03.412
TO CAUCUS. IT 

01:31:06.477 --> 01:31:08.719
ALSO SEEMS TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT 
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST WORKING 

01:31:08.918 --> 01:31:11.359
OR WHO ARE ELDERLY WHO LIVE IN 
MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE 

01:31:11.563 --> 01:31:13.563
WHERE TRANSPORTATION COULD 

01:31:15.214 --> 01:31:17.214
BE DIFFICULT. ESPECIALLY, IF IN 
THE PAST THERE ARE WEATHER 

01:31:17.253 --> 01:31:19.697
ISSUES WHICH WE HAVE NOT HAD 
THIS YEAR BUT IT CAN HAPPEN IN 

01:31:19.909 --> 01:31:21.909
IOWA SOMETIMES. THERE IS THIS 

01:31:24.755 --> 01:31:26.860
IDEA THAT PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS MAY
HAVE WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN 

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:29.840
THE PAST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. 
WE SEE HOW CAMPAIGNS HAVE 

01:31:30.043 --> 01:31:31.873
RESPONDED. 
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR WHERE YOU WATCHING 

01:31:31.874 --> 01:31:36.230
THE WEATHER BUT IT HAS 
IMPLICATIONS. I'M SURE SOME 

01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:38.452
CAMPAIGNS WERE WATCHING TO MAKE 
SURE WAS GOOD WEATHER BECAUSE IT

01:31:38.663 --> 01:31:42.236
IS TAX THEM MORE THAN OTHERS. 
HOW DO THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE TO 

01:31:42.433 --> 01:31:49.740
THINK ABOUT THE TURF? 
&gt;&gt; IT'S SNOWING. IT'S THE 

01:31:49.954 --> 01:31:52.997
MIDWEST. YOU GET THE WIND, THE 
BITTER WIND AND I THINK IT KEEPS

01:31:55.841 --> 01:31:57.841
TURN OUT DOWN. THE RECORD 
TURNOUT IS ONLY 

01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:04.999
239,000 PEOPLE. AND THAT IS NOT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE DECIDING 

01:32:05.202 --> 01:32:06.624
SUCH A MAJOR PART OF AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY. 

01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:08.625
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS WITH BARACK 

01:32:10.869 --> 01:32:11.264
OBAMA. 
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

01:32:11.265 --> 01:32:14.320
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE MORE THAN 3 MILLION
PEOPLE IN THE STATE. YOU SEE HOW

01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:17.360
SMALL A PORTION THAT IS. 
&gt;&gt; THEIR CAMPAIGNS LIKE THE 

01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:23.159
BIDEN CAMPAIGN THAT WANT TO MAKE
SURE THE WEATHER IS GOOD.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.800
&gt;&gt; IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT'S
A FUN PARLOR GAME BECAUSE IT IS 

01:32:26.005 --> 01:32:30.174
NOT TOTALLY OBVIOUS WHO BENEFITS
FROM BETTER WEATHER AND IT WAS 

01:32:30.369 --> 01:32:32.398
ACTUALLY UNSEASONABLY WARM OVER 
THE WEEKEND. THE SNOWPACK WAS 

01:32:32.605 --> 01:32:37.064
MELTING. IT WAS KIND OF WHAT 
BECAUSE OF THE MELT. IT WAS 

01:32:37.278 --> 01:32:40.941
BEAUTIFUL. PEOPLE WERE WEARING 
SHORTS. TONIGHT, IT'S COLDER BUT

01:32:41.147 --> 01:32:43.779
IT'S FINE FOR FEBRUARY. YOU 

01:32:48.246 --> 01:32:50.881
ARE -- ANDREW YANG IS COUNTING 
ON FIRST TIME CAUCUSGOERS.  

01:32:51.082 --> 01:32:53.122
BERNIE SANDERS IS TRYING TO 

01:32:57.382 --> 01:32:59.486
SPEND THE ELECTORATE TO GET 
PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER GONE TO A 

01:32:59.687 --> 01:33:03.069
COMMUNITY MEETING TO SHOW UP. 
JOE BIDEN DEFINITELY, HIS 

01:33:03.296 --> 01:33:05.717
SUPPORTERS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE DONE THIS YEAR IN AND YEAR 

01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:09.169
OUT. THEY ARE LESS IMPASSIONED 
AND LESS ENERGY BUT THEY ARE 

01:33:09.376 --> 01:33:11.376
RELIABLE. THE 

01:33:12.822 --> 01:33:15.877
BERNIE SANDERS, AND ALL OF HIS 
RALLIES HE SAID IF TURNOUT IS 

01:33:16.079 --> 01:33:19.324
LOW I WILL LOOSE. THE LOWER 
TURNOUT IS THE WORST FOR ME AND 

01:33:19.525 --> 01:33:24.402
IN THIS CONTEXT THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; WE WATCH FOR TURN IT. THE 

01:33:24.603 --> 01:33:29.174
CANDIDATES HAVE MADE STRONG 
PERSONAL CLOSING IOWA'S. LET'S 

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:31.687
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY'VE HAD 

01:33:34.358 --> 01:33:36.358
TO SAY. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE TAKING ON WALL STREET.

01:33:36.384 --> 01:33:41.689
WE ARE TAKING ON THE INSURANCE 
COMPANIES, THE DRUG COMPANIES, 

01:33:41.889 --> 01:33:45.536
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, MILITARY, 
WE ARE TAKING ON ALL 

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.912
OF THEM. WE ARE TAKING ON TRUMP 
ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE ARE 

01:33:53.114 --> 01:33:56.693
TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC 
ESTABLISHMENT. 

01:33:56.694 --> 01:33:58.747
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOTTEN THE ENDORSEMENTS 
FROM THE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND UNION

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.065
LEADER TO THE QUAD-CITY TIMES 
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

01:34:02.267 --> 01:34:04.314
TACKLE THE ISSUES NOT JUST THE 
TALKING POINTS, I'VE HAD THE 

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:08.293
EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO GET THINGS 
DONE. YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT AND 

01:34:08.493 --> 01:34:12.041
THAT'S HOW WE WILL IN. 
&gt;&gt; THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOOD,

01:34:12.242 --> 01:34:15.392
DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE. AND 
GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, THEY WOULD 

01:34:16.195 --> 01:34:18.195
NEVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY 
DOWN. 

01:34:20.865 --> 01:34:22.865
THEY DESERVE, THEY DESERVE A 
PRESIDENT THAT TELLS THE TRUTH. 

01:34:24.316 --> 01:34:26.316
NOT LIE, LIE AFTER LIE 

01:34:28.582 --> 01:34:30.027
AFTER LIE.
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE 

01:34:30.028 --> 01:34:32.750
BETWEEN LISTENING TO YOUR HEAD 
AND YOUR HEART. YOU DON'T HAVE 

01:34:32.949 --> 01:34:34.989
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOVERNING WELL
AND WINNING BIG. WE DON'T HAVE 

01:34:36.514 --> 01:34:39.762
TO CHOOSE. WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ALL
OF THESE THINGS. WE HAVE TO GET 

01:34:39.964 --> 01:34:44.030
ALL OF THIS RIGHT AND THIS IS 
OUR ONE SHOT, IT'S OUR ONLY 

01:34:44.231 --> 01:34:47.073
CHANCE. 
&gt;&gt; THE DANGER IS REAL. OUR 

01:34:47.277 --> 01:34:51.546
DEMOCRACY HANGS IN THE BALANCE. 
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE 

01:34:52.348 --> 01:34:58.650
CAN TOUR, WE CAN BE TIMID, WE 
CAN CROUCH OR WE CAN FIGHT BACK.

01:34:58.854 --> 01:35:00.854
ME, I'M 

01:35:04.048 --> 01:35:05.556
FIGHTING BACK. 
&gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT THE CLOSING 

01:35:05.557 --> 01:35:08.411
ARGUMENTS THE CANDIDATES WERE 
TRYING TO MAKE, EUGENE. WHAT DID

01:35:08.617 --> 01:35:12.670
YOU HEAR THEM PUSHING HOME? 
&gt;&gt; ONE THEME THAT I HEARD AND AT

01:35:12.875 --> 01:35:17.547
THE WARREN RALLY AND AT 
BUTTIGIEG'S  RALLY IS THE 

01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:22.212
IMPORTANCE OF UNIFYING. WE HAD 
ONE HEADLINE IN PARTICULAR 

01:35:22.419 --> 01:35:24.419
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO ABOUT ONE 
CANDIDATE SURROGATE BOOING 

01:35:24.854 --> 01:35:26.854
HILLARY CLINTON AS A 

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:31.563
SURROGATE FOR BERNIE SANDERS. 
THERE WAS CONCERN THAT IT 

01:35:31.564 --> 01:35:32.988
HIGHLIGHTED HOW DIVIDED THE 
PARTY REALLY IS. 

01:35:32.989 --> 01:35:35.702
&gt;&gt; LIKE THE RASHIDA CHILLY? BUT 
LATER APOLOGIZED. 

01:35:35.703 --> 01:35:37.703
&gt;&gt; 

01:35:40.433 --> 01:35:44.154
SHE DID APOLOGIZE AND WE SAW 
CANDIDATES INCLUDING BERNIE 

01:35:44.358 --> 01:35:46.510
SANDERS OUTSIDE A RALLY OF HIS 
SAYING ULTIMATELY HE NEEDED HIS 

01:35:46.713 --> 01:35:48.526
SUPPORTERS TO BACK THE 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN THE END 

01:35:48.527 --> 01:35:52.498
SO THEY COULD DEFEAT TRUMP. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SEE THAT'S DIFFERENT

01:35:52.715 --> 01:35:59.409
THIS YEAR PROFESSOR? AS CAUCUS 
GOERS MAKE THERE, NATIONS ON WHO

01:35:59.607 --> 01:36:01.607
THEY SHOULD SUPPORT. THE SHEER 
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES IS UNUSUAL.

01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:07.591
WE HAVE NOT HAD 11 AND THEY 
WON'T ALL BE VIABLE COMING OUT 

01:36:07.792 --> 01:36:09.792
OF IOWA BUT WITH 

01:36:11.573 --> 01:36:13.626
THE NEW RULES YOU CAN ONLY 
REALIGN ONCE AT THE CAUCUSES. 

01:36:13.822 --> 01:36:17.259
THAT'S NEW THIS YEAR. THAT 
PROBABLY HURTS THE FRINGE 

01:36:17.555 --> 01:36:19.597
CANDIDATES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
WANT TO ALIGN WITH THE VIABLE 

01:36:19.796 --> 01:36:23.562
GROUP AND THAT'S IT THEY CAN'T 
MOVE AGAIN. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:36:23.759 --> 01:36:27.706
MORE OF A WINNOWING EFFECT IT'S 
ALWAYS BEEN A WINNOWING AFFECT 

01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:29.908
BUT IT'S BIGGER THIS TIME. 
&gt;&gt; 

01:36:33.098 --> 01:36:35.328
HOW SIGNIFICANT? TALK MORE ABOUT
THAT WITH US, HOW MAKE IT OR 

01:36:35.543 --> 01:36:37.543
BREAK IN IOWA FEELS BECAUSE 
THERE ARE SO MANY CANDIDATES. 

01:36:37.627 --> 01:36:41.432
&gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON THE CANDIDATE. 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY TO 

01:36:41.628 --> 01:36:43.661
WIN BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR 
OTHERS. IF AMY KLOBUCHAR DOES 

01:36:43.862 --> 01:36:50.165
NOT BREAK 15% IN PRECINCTS SHE 
WILL BE IN BIG TROUBLE. THIS IS 

01:36:50.370 --> 01:36:53.218
OBVIOUSLY THAT SHE IS A FAVORITE
DAUGHTER AND THAT MINNESOTA IS 

01:36:53.431 --> 01:36:56.883
RIGHT UP NORTH. THAT WOULD BE A 
BIG PROBLEM FOR HER. BERNIE 

01:36:57.083 --> 01:37:01.352
SANDERS PROBABLY NEEDS AT LAST. 
HE WILL LIKELY WIN IN NEW 

01:37:01.555 --> 01:37:05.820
HAMPSHIRE WHERE HE'S THE 
FAVORITE SON. BUT, AS SOMEONE 

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:10.389
LIKE JOE BIDEN WHO IS VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO WIN BUT HE 

01:37:10.597 --> 01:37:13.956
HAS STRONGER SUPPORT IN THE 
LATER CONTEST. IN SOUTH CAROLINA

01:37:14.158 --> 01:37:17.201
HE WILL WIN IN NEVADA HE HAS 
SUPPORT. IT'S REALLY MORE 

01:37:17.603 --> 01:37:19.603
IMPORTANT 

01:37:22.602 --> 01:37:25.732
FOR PERHAPS NOT QUITE THE TOP OF
THE FIRST YEAR CANDIDATES TO 

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.379
BREAK THROUGH. 
&gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU WATCHING JAMES?

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:32.031
&gt;&gt; AMY KLOBUCHAR, IF SHE IS NOT 
VIABLE IN A LOT OF THESE TONIGHT

01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:37.507
SHE IS OVER. FOR A MINUTE, I 
WOULD NOT CALL HER A FAVORITE 

01:37:37.714 --> 01:37:39.541
DAUGHTER. THERE'S TENSION 
HISTORICALLY BETWEEN IOWA AND 

01:37:39.542 --> 01:37:43.002
MINNESOTA BUT IF SHE CAN'T DO 
WELL IN IOWA SHE CAN'T DO WELL 

01:37:43.301 --> 01:37:45.301
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IF SHE 

01:37:48.277 --> 01:37:50.319
OVER PERFORMS, SHE IS THE PERSON
WHO IS ACTUALLY MOST SURPRISING 

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.944
THAT SHE IS NOT DOING WELL. SHE 
HAS GOTTEN TO BE A BETTER 

01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:55.150
CANDIDATE. WE HAVEN'T 

01:37:57.009 --> 01:37:59.071
TALKED ABOUT THIS PACKAGE BUT 
THAT'S THE FACTOR HERE IN IOWA. 

01:37:59.267 --> 01:38:04.325
THESE FOUR SENATORS MICHAEL 
BENNET FOCUSED ON NEW HAMPSHIRE 

01:38:04.625 --> 01:38:07.778
. THREE SENATORS ON JURY DUTY, 
OUT OF THE STATE THAT HAVE AN 

01:38:07.991 --> 01:38:09.991
IMPACT AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR 
FROM REPORTING THAT 

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:15.423
AMY KLOBUCHAR WAS HURT THE MOST 
BECAUSE WARREN AND SANDERS HAD 

01:38:15.622 --> 01:38:17.622
MONEY AND ORGANIZATION. 
KLOBUCHAR GETTING MOMENTUM LATE 

01:38:18.535 --> 01:38:20.778
IN GETTING BIG ENDORSEMENTS FROM
NOT JUST THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:26.161
SHE GOT WITH WARREN IN THE QUAD 
CITY PAPER. PEOPLE WHO WERE 

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:30.530
HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT BIDEN, SHE 
IS THE OBVIOUS PERSON TO GO TO. 

01:38:30.731 --> 01:38:32.731
PETE BUTTIGIEG HAD SOME OF 

01:38:35.193 --> 01:38:37.907
THE  BARK KNOCKED OFF AFTER HE 
TOOK SOME HITS WHEN HE LED IN 

01:38:38.108 --> 01:38:41.503
THE POLLS. KLOBUCHAR IS SOMEONE 
WHO IS MORE I THINK THAT ANYONE 

01:38:41.702 --> 01:38:46.279
IS MAKE OR BREAK. I THINK IT'S 
INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU 

01:38:46.498 --> 01:38:48.498
TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE KLOBUCHAR 
CAMP. THEY 

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.702
FEEL -- 
&gt;&gt; LIKE WASHINGTON. 

01:38:54.703 --> 01:38:57.257
&gt;&gt; IF THEY HAD TWO MORE WEEKS. 
&gt;&gt; I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE 

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.480
REPORTERS WHO ASKED WHY SHE 
CAMPED OUT AND THEY SAID IOWANS 

01:38:59.683 --> 01:39:03.023
NO BECAUSE THEY'RE TUNED IN BUT 
IT'S NOTHING LIKE FACE TIME IN 

01:39:03.222 --> 01:39:05.264
THE PERSONAL RETAIL POLITICS 
IOWA IS SO WELL KNOWN FOR. WE 

01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:07.470
WILL TALK 

01:39:10.682 --> 01:39:14.214
ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE A LOT 
OF KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE ALONG 

01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.431
WITH OUR RESEARCH PARTNERS HAVE 
BEEN ASKING IOWA VOTERS AS THEY 

01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:18.899
HEAD INTO THEIR CAUCUSES . WE 
ARE GETTING A MORE CLEAR PICTURE

01:39:19.098 --> 01:39:21.444
OF WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS. LET'S 
TOSS BACK NOW TO OUR ELECTION 

01:39:21.639 --> 01:39:23.084
INSIGHTS TEAM IN THE POSTS DAVID
BYLER. 

01:39:23.085 --> 01:39:26.791
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU LIBBY. HERE WE HAVE
THE FIRST STREAM OF DATA COMING 

01:39:26.998 --> 01:39:31.260
IN IN WASHINGTON, D.C.. EARLY 
ENTRANCE POLLS OF IOWA CAUCUS 

01:39:31.573 --> 01:39:33.573
GOERS. HERE WITH ME IS EMILY 

01:39:37.549 --> 01:39:39.608
WHO IS HALF OF THE POSTPONING 
TEAM. SHE DOES OUR IN-HOUSE 

01:39:39.809 --> 01:39:44.057
SURVEYS AND I AM JUST CURIOUS 
ABOUT THESE POLLS. FIRST, ARE 

01:39:44.261 --> 01:39:48.145
THERE ANY DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS 
THAT ARE INTERESTING? BUT 

01:39:48.337 --> 01:39:51.164
REMEMBER THESE ARE ONLY 
PRELIMINARY DATA. THEY COULD 

01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:55.625
CHANGE AS THE EVENING GOES ON. 
WE KNOW THAT WITH A VERY LIBERAL

01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.122
VOTERS THOUGH WHOSE WHO SAID 
THEY WERE LIBERAL AND SAID THEY 

01:40:01.323 --> 01:40:05.796
VOTED FOR SANDERS. OF THOSE WHO 
SAID THEY WERE MODERATE 

01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:09.856
CONSERVATIVE MORE IN THAT GROUP 
PULLED FOR BIDEN. AMONG BOTH 

01:40:10.064 --> 01:40:14.641
GROUPS PETE BUTTIGIEG AND WARREN
ARE BEHIND . BUT PREFERENCE BY 

01:40:14.839 --> 01:40:18.186
AGE IS ANOTHER INTERESTING TO 
LOOK AT. WE WILL SPLIT THE 

01:40:18.387 --> 01:40:21.223
GROUPS BETWEEN THOSE 45 AND 
OLDER AND THOSE YOUNGER THAN 45 

01:40:21.426 --> 01:40:27.928
AND THOSE YOUNGER WINDS THROUGH 
SANDERS BY LARGER MARGIN THAN 

01:40:28.127 --> 01:40:31.793
THE OLDER ONES WHO WENT FOR 
BIDEN IT WAS A WIDER MARGIN. 

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.761
BUTTIGIEG AND WARREN  EVEN FOR 

01:40:39.098 --> 01:40:40.526
BOTH GROUPS. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S SO INTERESTING. SORT 

01:40:40.527 --> 01:40:43.163
OF ALONG THOSE LINES, ONE OF THE
BIG THINGS WE'VE SEEN ARE THOSE 

01:40:43.376 --> 01:40:45.376
IDEOLOGICAL FIGHTS AND POLICY 

01:40:47.015 --> 01:40:49.015
FIGHTS AROUND HEALTHCARE, SORT 
OF BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVES AND 

01:40:49.866 --> 01:40:51.866
THE MODERATES. ARE THERE ANY 
INTERESTING PATTERNS THAT YOU 

01:40:52.715 --> 01:40:54.747
SEE? BUT WE LOOKED AT SOMEWHAT 
LIBERAL WHICH IS THE LARGEST 

01:40:58.603 --> 01:41:01.438
GROUP IN, NOT THE MAJORITY BUT A
PLURALITY OF VOTERS IN THE IOWA 

01:41:04.689 --> 01:41:06.689
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. BUTTIGIEG 
RECEIVED 1 IN 4  

01:41:10.176 --> 01:41:12.176
OF THOSE WHILE BIDEN, SANDERS 
AND WARREN ARE SLIGHTLY BEHIND 

01:41:12.286 --> 01:41:15.466
HIM WITH THAT GROUP. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S INTERESTING. LAST 

01:41:15.666 --> 01:41:17.666
QUESTION, ARE THERE ANY 
TOP-LEVEL FINDINGS ARE 

01:41:19.730 --> 01:41:21.856
INTERESTING NUGGETS THAT ARE 
STICKING OUT TO YOU THAT YOU SAY

01:41:22.056 --> 01:41:24.287
THAT IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE 
OUR AUDIENCE TO KNOW? BUT YEAH, 

01:41:24.486 --> 01:41:26.941
WE LOOKED AT THOSE WHO MADE 
THEIR MINDS UP IN THE LAST FEW 

01:41:27.143 --> 01:41:32.822
DAYS. ABOUT 3 IN 10 OF THE 
VOTERS IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES MADE

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:37.817
UP THEIR MINDS IN THE LAST FEW 
DAYS WHICH IS INTERESTING AND 

01:41:38.019 --> 01:41:41.258
THAT'S MORE THAN 2016. BIDEN AND
BUTTIGIEG PULLED IN MORE OF 

01:41:41.464 --> 01:41:43.464
THEIR SUPPORT  AMONG THIS GROUP 
THAN 

01:41:46.127 --> 01:41:48.388
OTHER CANDIDATES. IN THOSE WHO 
DECIDED EARLIER WHICH IS 6 IN 10

01:41:48.584 --> 01:41:52.727
VOTERS OF ROUGHLY SANDERS HAD 
THE EDGE AND THEN BUTTIGIEG, 

01:41:52.929 --> 01:41:54.671
WARREN AND BIDEN ARE CLOSE 
BEHIND. 

01:41:54.672 --> 01:41:58.941
&gt;&gt;  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND
TALKING TO US. WE WILL HAVE MORE

01:41:59.143 --> 01:42:01.189
ON THESE NUMBERS AT ALL SORTS OF
OTHER THINGS THROUGHOUT THE 

01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:04.011
NIGHT. BACK TO YOU, LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DAVID. LET'S CHECK

01:42:04.209 --> 01:42:08.497
BACK IN WITH OUR CAUCUS SITES. 
HANNA JEWELL IS AT A SITE AT 

01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:11.291
DRAKE UNIVERSITY.
&gt;&gt; 

01:42:15.097 --> 01:42:17.218
Reporter: HELLO. THAT QUIET IN 
CONCENTRATION YOU CAN HEAR AND 

01:42:17.424 --> 01:42:21.069
FEEL IN THE AIR AS PEOPLE ARE 
DOING THAT. WE ARE COMING TO THE

01:42:21.275 --> 01:42:24.312
END OF THE FIRST ALIGNMENT AND 
WE ARE ON THE FLOOR BUT WE HAVE 

01:42:24.526 --> 01:42:26.961
STICKERS SO WE DON'T 
ACCIDENTALLY CAUCUS AND CREATE A

01:42:27.163 --> 01:42:31.229
SCANDAL. I WANT TO TALK TO MARIE
WHO IS A VOLUNTEER. NOT A PAID 

01:42:31.431 --> 01:42:35.103
CAMPAIGN WORKER, SHE WANTS US TO
KNOW FOR THE PETE BUTTIGIEG 

01:42:35.302 --> 01:42:38.136
CAMPAIGN. OUR THING SO FAR FOR 
YOU? PARK  IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE 

01:42:38.342 --> 01:42:42.999
DOING PRETTY GOOD. THEY ARE 
COUNTING BUT WE ARE IN ROWS OF 

01:42:43.212 --> 01:42:45.447
10. THE VIABILITY THRESHOLD IS 
61 AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE MADE 

01:42:45.652 --> 01:42:48.497
THAT. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I HAVE A MISSION 

01:42:50.317 --> 01:42:53.366
22%? AWESOME. THAT'S WHAT I'M 
BEING TOLD. IT'S THE FIRST 

01:42:53.566 --> 01:42:59.669
ALIGNMENT, HOW DOES IT FEEL? BUT
THAT FEELS REALLY GOOD. OH MY 

01:42:59.887 --> 01:43:03.526
GOD. IT LOOKS LIKE AMY AND YANG 
AND I CANNOT SEE BIDEN BUT THEY 

01:43:03.723 --> 01:43:07.787
NOT BE VIABLE. IT LOOKS LIKE WE 
WILL GO REALLY HARD AT THE 

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.312
KLOBUCHAR PEOPLE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT IS YOUR PITCH 

01:43:11.313 --> 01:43:15.735
IF I'M A SUPPORTER? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK BOTH PETE AND AMY 

01:43:15.972 --> 01:43:19.983
HAVE REALLY STRONG MODERATE 
POLICIES BUT I THINK PETE IS 

01:43:20.184 --> 01:43:22.621
ABILITY TO INSPIRE PEOPLE HAS 
OUTSHINED 

01:43:26.881 --> 01:43:28.881
AMY'S ABILITY, PETE STARTED FROM
ZERO NAME RECOGNITION THAT'S NOT

01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:33.381
WHERE AMY STARTED FROM. THIS 
ENTIRE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN BUILT 

01:43:33.598 --> 01:43:36.633
FROM NOTHING IN A YEAR AND I 
THINK THAT SHOWS THE POWER THAT 

01:43:36.837 --> 01:43:41.302
PETE HAS TO MOBILIZE PEOPLE AND 
GET THEM INSPIRED AND JUST THIS 

01:43:41.509 --> 01:43:43.509
ATTITUDE OF BELONGING THAT THE 

01:43:45.973 --> 01:43:48.334
CAMPAIGN HAS. THAT'S WHAT I 
WOULD SAY TO AMY PEOPLE LIKE THE

01:43:48.529 --> 01:43:50.726
POLICIES ARE SIMILAR BUT WE HAVE
A GOOD VIBE OVER HERE. 

01:43:50.727 --> 01:43:52.725
&gt;&gt; Reporter: EARLIER WE WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE 

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:56.545
WERE FILTERING AND. YOU HAD 
COMPASS CAUCUS EARLIER. I CAN'T 

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:02.842
GET COUNTED. I WILL JUST TELL 
YOU. OH, WE 

01:44:05.886 --> 01:44:09.028
ARE BACK. WE ARE ALL GOOD I DID 
NOT GET COUNTED. YOU HAD A MOCK 

01:44:09.232 --> 01:44:14.415
CAUCUS WHERE NO ONE'S TURNING UP
FOR SANDERS. THEY SAID THEY DID 

01:44:16.436 --> 01:44:18.475
NOT ADVERTISE.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A SATELLITE CAUCUS. 

01:44:18.683 --> 01:44:24.998
&gt;&gt; THE MOCK ONE. THE SATELLITE 
CAUCUS WAS SOLID SANDERS. TELL 

01:44:25.203 --> 01:44:29.039
ME WHY YOU WERE NERVOUS ABOUT 
SANDERS SUPPORTERS?

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:35.944
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY ARE MOBILIZED 
AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY. I

01:44:36.143 --> 01:44:38.143
THINK THERE CAMPAIGN 

01:44:47.331 --> 01:44:49.359
TENDS TO DO CHAOTIC STUFF. YOU 
ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT 

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.364
WILL HAPPEN. I RESPECT BERNIE 
SANDERS AND EVERYONE INVOLVED 

01:44:51.365 --> 01:44:53.791
BUT THEY CAN GET INTO WILD 
STRATEGIES TO SET THE ROOM IN A 

01:44:53.994 --> 01:44:56.460
CHAOTIC MOOD. I WAS NERVOUS BUT 
WE WILL SEE. 

01:44:56.461 --> 01:44:58.461
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU DON'T 

01:45:01.538 --> 01:45:03.260
LIKE CHAOS?
&gt;&gt; CAUCUSES ARE HARD AS IT IS. 

01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:08.642
YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A LOT OF 
LINING PEOPLE UP AND COUNTING 

01:45:08.844 --> 01:45:11.724
AND GETTING PEOPLE TO STAY STILL
AND STAY ORGANIZED. CHAOS, IT 

01:45:12.021 --> 01:45:17.178
DOES NOT HELP BUT I HAVE FRIENDS
AND THEY ARE COOL. 

01:45:17.179 --> 01:45:19.179
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WOULD YOU PREFER 
YOUR A 

01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:24.461
PRIMARY SYSTEM? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK PRIMARY SYSTEMS ARE 

01:45:28.685 --> 01:45:31.188
MORE ACCESSIBLE. I THINK THAT'S 
IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY THE 

01:45:31.398 --> 01:45:33.398
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE PARTY 
TRYING TO CHAMPION PEOPLE WITH 

01:45:33.532 --> 01:45:35.558
DISABILITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR
AND THOSE WHO HAVE TO WORK 

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.906
DURING THE CAUCUSES. I THINK THE
CAUCUSES ARE COOL BECAUSE THEY 

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.746
ARE A TRADITION. THEY FEEL 
REALLY DEMOCRATIC. YOU ARE 

01:45:40.946 --> 01:45:43.897
CONVINCING YOUR NEIGHBORS. I 
THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS

01:45:44.118 --> 01:45:46.118
TO BE 

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:49.487
THE CHAMPION OF PEOPLE THAT 
CAN'T GO TO CAUCUSES. I THINK 

01:45:49.694 --> 01:45:52.519
THE PRIMARIES ARE GOOD IDEA 
MOVING FORWARD. 

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.964
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT IF THAT MAY 
IOWA LESS SPECIAL NEXT TIME?  

01:45:55.165 --> 01:45:58.012
YOU'RE A PERSON THAT LOVES 
POLITICS. 

01:45:58.013 --> 01:46:01.870
&gt;&gt; SURE. THE THING THAT KEEPS 
IOWA IMPORTANT IS ITS PLACE ON 

01:46:05.112 --> 01:46:07.440
THE CALENDAR. EVEN GOT SWITCH TO
A PRIMARY OF ITS EARLY IMMEDIATE

01:46:07.654 --> 01:46:09.654
ATTENTION WILL STILL BE HERE. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S TRUE ARE YOU

01:46:09.844 --> 01:46:12.652
FEELING LESS SANCTIONS? BUT YET.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE WILL COME BACK 

01:46:12.849 --> 01:46:16.406
AFTER THE REALIGNMENT.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU HANNAH KEEP YOUR 

01:46:16.602 --> 01:46:18.602
MEDIA 

01:46:19.942 --> 01:46:21.942
STICKER ON. WE HAVE BREAKING 
NEWS THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HAS 

01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.980
BEEN CALLED FOR PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:28.879
THE WINNER OF THE REPUBLICAN 
CAUCUS THAT'S ALSO GOING ON 

01:46:29.079 --> 01:46:31.079
TONIGHT BUT NO REAL CONTEST 
COMPARED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.151
THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE 
FIELD. WE WILL BRING YOU RESULTS

01:46:33.348 --> 01:46:35.348
AS THEY ARE RELEASED 

01:46:38.016 --> 01:46:40.016
THROUGHOUT IOWA PRECINCT BY 
PRECINCT. STAY TUNED TO " THE 

01:46:40.162 --> 01:46:42.197
WASHINGTON POST " FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC RESULTS.  BUT IN THE 

01:46:42.398 --> 01:46:45.533
MEANTIME LET'S GO TO JOYCE KOH 
IN COUNCIL BLUFFS AT A CAUCUS 

01:46:46.151 --> 01:46:48.151
SITE.
&gt;&gt; 

01:46:49.602 --> 01:46:53.055
Reporter: HELLO. WE ARE STANDING
BY AS WE AWAIT THE NUMBERS FOR 

01:46:53.257 --> 01:46:55.903
REALIGNMENT. LABOR LINCOLN HIGH 
SCHOOL IN COUNCIL BLUFFS. THERE 

01:46:56.103 --> 01:47:00.261
ARE JUST TO GIVE YOU THE WIDE 
PICTURE THERE ARE 153 CAUCUSERS 

01:47:00.462 --> 01:47:08.090
THAT STARTED IN THE ROOM. THE 
15% VIABILITY THRESHOLD WAS 23 

01:47:08.298 --> 01:47:12.758
PEOPLE. EACH CAMPAIGNS HAD TO 
GET 23 PEOPLE TO CAUCUS WITH 

01:47:12.967 --> 01:47:16.414
HIM. THESE WERE THE RESULTS OF 
THE FIRST ALIGNMENT. PETE 

01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:22.511
BUTTIGIEG WAS THE  WINNER AT 35,
THIS IS JUST IN THE FIRST 

01:47:22.728 --> 01:47:24.728
ALIGNMENT. THAN THE NUMBERS CAME

01:47:27.179 --> 01:47:29.421
DOWN TO BIDEN 31, KLOBUCHAR THEY
JUST THAT A RECOUNT HER NUMBER 

01:47:29.618 --> 01:47:35.918
WAS 30. ELIZABETH WARREN 28 AND 
BERNIE SANDERS 24. THE ONLY 

01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:41.923
NON-VIABLE CANDIDATE WAS YANG. 
YANG HAD FOUR SUPPORTERS. THERE 

01:47:42.124 --> 01:47:45.872
WERE A BUNCH OF OTHER CAMPAIGNS 
AROUND THE TABLE TRYING TO 

01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:50.744
CONVINCE THOSE VOTERS TO SIT 
WITH THEIR CAMPAIGN. I DID SEE 

01:47:50.958 --> 01:47:57.657
ONE YANG SUPPORTER GO OVER TO 
BUTTIGIEG . BUTTIGIEG'S CAMPAIGN

01:47:57.861 --> 01:48:03.230
, THEY STARTED TO CHEER AND THEY
WERE HAPPY TO GET THE ONE VOTER.

01:48:03.437 --> 01:48:07.623
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE OTHER 
YANG VOTER WENT. I ALSO SAW TWO 

01:48:07.823 --> 01:48:09.823
YANG VOTERS WALKOUT THE DOOR. 
THAT IS 

01:48:13.092 --> 01:48:15.212
ANOTHER OPTION. THEY CAN CHOOSE 
TO ENTIRELY GO HOME IF THEIR 

01:48:15.413 --> 01:48:19.993
FIRST CANDIDATE DOES NOT GET 
ENOUGH VOTES TO BE VIABLE. RIGHT

01:48:20.206 --> 01:48:23.254
NOW, WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT
THE NEW NUMBERS ARE. 

01:48:27.712 --> 01:48:29.767
I BELIEVE BUTTIGIEG WILL STILL 
BE IN THE LEAD WHEN THEY 

01:48:29.974 --> 01:48:33.409
ANNOUNCE THE REALIGNMENT 
NUMBERS.  ONE THING I WANT TO 

01:48:33.711 --> 01:48:36.066
MENTION, WE WERE OVERHEARING 
SOME CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE 

01:48:36.658 --> 01:48:38.658
YANG SUPPORTERS 

01:48:39.898 --> 01:48:43.764
AND EVERYONE THAT WAS TRYING TO 
CONVINCE THEM TO GO TO THEIR 

01:48:44.069 --> 01:48:46.117
CAMPAIGN. ONE INTERESTING THING 
TO NOTE IS THAT ONE OF THE 

01:48:46.314 --> 01:48:49.861
VOTERS SAID HE WAS CONSIDERING 
DO I VOTE FOR A MORE PROGRESSIVE

01:48:50.063 --> 01:48:55.454
OR MODERATE CANDIDATE. IN THE 
END,  HE SAID HE CHOSE BUTTIGIEG

01:48:55.673 --> 01:48:59.005
BECAUSE HE FELT  A MORE MODERATE
CANDIDATE WOULD APPEAL TO BOTH 

01:48:59.207 --> 01:49:03.877
SIDES AND ULTIMATELY DEFEAT 
DONALD TRUMP. WE WILL BRING YOU 

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.122
THE RESULTS OUT OF THIS PRECINCT
LOCATION ONCE WE GET THE FINAL 

01:49:07.328 --> 01:49:10.784
RESULTS. THEY ARE COUNTING THEM 
RIGHT NOW. BUT FOR NOW, BACK TO 

01:49:12.202 --> 01:49:14.202
YOU LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; THANKS SO 

01:49:17.072 --> 01:49:19.390
MUCH, JOYCE. IT'S SO AMAZING TO 
SEE THE PROCESS TAKING PLACE IN 

01:49:19.593 --> 01:49:21.593
YOU CAN SEE THERE WAS SOMEONE 
WITH THE WARREN RE-SYNCED 

01:49:21.677 --> 01:49:25.407
CAPTAIN T-SHIRT TALKING. YOU'VE 
ATTENDED THESE CAUCUSES? 

01:49:25.408 --> 01:49:30.486
&gt;&gt; I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAVE 
THESE REPORTS THEY WERE BOTH 

01:49:30.693 --> 01:49:33.128
DELIGHTFUL. YOU SAW WITH THAT 
BUTTIGIEG SUPPORTER THAT  THESE 

01:49:33.328 --> 01:49:35.572
ARE MY FRIENDS AND THAT'S WHAT 
IT IS 

01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:41.155
LIKE AT THESE EVENTS AND WE ARE 
ALSO GETTING THE COLLEGE CAMPUS 

01:49:41.377 --> 01:49:45.515
FEEL IN THE RURAL IOWA FIELD. 
THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL SITES NOT 

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.640
NECESSARY SAMPLES. THERE'S BEEN 
A TON OF MANEUVERING BEHIND THE 

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.079
SCENES AT THE OPERATIVE LEVEL TO
TRY TO MAKE SPECIAL DEALS. THESE

01:49:55.281 --> 01:49:57.723
ARE HISTORICALLY COMMON. THERE 
IS A LOT 

01:50:01.568 --> 01:50:03.510
OF PRECEDENCE FOR A CAMPAIGN 
WILL ENCOURAGE THEIR SUPPORTERS 

01:50:03.511 --> 01:50:06.180
TO GO TO SOMEONE ON THE SECOND 
BALLOT BUT WHAT WE JUST SAW IS 

01:50:06.387 --> 01:50:09.287
WHY THAT IS HARD. THERE MAY BE 
SOME KIND OF DEAL WHERE ANDREW 

01:50:11.724 --> 01:50:14.159
YANG'S CAMPAIGN AGREES WITH 
BERNIE'S CAMPAIGN TO DO 

01:50:14.359 --> 01:50:16.799
SOMETHING. THAT'S NOT IN 
PRACTICE ON THE GROUND COME OF 

01:50:16.997 --> 01:50:18.997
THERE 

01:50:20.462 --> 01:50:22.796
ARE INDIVIDUALS. THEY ARE NOT SO
WEDDED TO YANG THEY WILL LISTEN 

01:50:22.997 --> 01:50:25.341
TO A STRATEGIST. THEY WILL GO 
WITH THEIR GOT AND LISTEN TO 

01:50:25.545 --> 01:50:30.013
THEIR NEIGHBORS MAKE A PITCH, 
FOR WHY WARREN IS BETTER OR WHY 

01:50:30.216 --> 01:50:33.973
WHOEVER IS BETTER. THAT IS WHY 
THESE DEALS, WHICH WE'VE WRITTEN

01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:37.108
ABOUT SO MUCH BUT WITH A GRAIN 
OF CAUTION BECAUSE WHAT WE JUST 

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.006
HEARD, WHICH IS PEOPLE AREN'T 
JUST LISTENING TO WHAT THE 

01:50:43.208 --> 01:50:46.459
CAMPAIGNS WOULD NECESSARILY TELL
THEM TO DO ON KIND OF THE MOST 

01:50:46.665 --> 01:50:51.539
BASIC MATH LEVEL. WE ARE SEEING 
THE RESORTING. THE OTHER THING, 

01:50:53.973 --> 01:50:55.916
NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE 
THAT WAS INTERESTING FROM 

01:50:55.917 --> 01:51:00.295
JOYCE'S REPORT. ALL OF BUT ONE 
PERSON IS VIABLE. THAT SUPPORTS 

01:51:00.489 --> 01:51:05.961
THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO WELL OUT OF

01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:08.161
THAT. THOSE EMILY GUSKIN NUMBERS

01:51:12.261 --> 01:51:14.130
WERE FASCINATING. 
&gt;&gt; I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A 

01:51:14.131 --> 01:51:16.131
MOMENT BUT FIRST PROFESSOR AS WE
WATCH THE ALIGNMENTS, WHAT 

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:18.971
HAPPENS IF A LOT OF CANDIDATES 
AT THE 15%? HOW MANY TICKETS OUT

01:51:21.395 --> 01:51:23.040
OF IOWA? 
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF CANDIDATES WILL 

01:51:23.041 --> 01:51:26.956
DECLARE THEMSELVES THE WINNER. 
WE MAY SEE THREE OR FOUR WINNERS

01:51:27.158 --> 01:51:29.544
COMING OUT OF IOWA AT LEAST 
SELF-DECLARED. OBVIOUSLY, THE 

01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:34.406
REAL NUMBER THAT MATTERS IS THE 
STATE DELEGATE EQUIVALENTS WILL 

01:51:34.607 --> 01:51:36.607
BE ANNOUNCED AS ONE 

01:51:39.471 --> 01:51:41.853
OF THREE PIECES OF INFORMATION 
THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED LATER. WE

01:51:42.068 --> 01:51:44.263
WILL SEE A LOT OF SPIN BEFORE WE
GET THE STATE DELEGATE 

01:51:44.497 --> 01:51:48.819
EQUIVALENTS COMING OUT. THIS IS 
PART OF WHY IT'S SO INCREDIBLY 

01:51:49.027 --> 01:51:52.565
DIFFICULT TO PULL WE'RE. IS THE 
REALIGNMENT SAYS THE PROCESS 

01:51:52.766 --> 01:51:54.766
THAT SO DIFFERENT FROM 

01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:03.373
A PRIMARY. IT'S HARD TO KNOW 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU CAN 

01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:06.003
DO AN ENTRANCE POLL AT A CAUCUS 
BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE 

01:52:06.208 --> 01:52:07.821
FINAL RESULTS. 
&gt;&gt; HOW HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING 

01:52:07.822 --> 01:52:10.035
REALIGNMENTS OR HOW CAUCUS GOERS
SAY I LIKE THIS PERSON BUT MY 

01:52:10.237 --> 01:52:13.885
SECOND CHOICE IS SO-AND-SO. 
&gt;&gt; BERNIE SANDERS HAS A STRONG 

01:52:14.086 --> 01:52:16.332
PRIMARY SUPPORT BUT SEEMS TO BE 
A LITTLE MORE WEAK ON SECOND 

01:52:16.534 --> 01:52:18.534
CHOICE. 

01:52:19.696 --> 01:52:21.741
SOMEONE LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN 
AND ALL THE POLLS I'VE SEEN HER 

01:52:21.944 --> 01:52:26.211
NUMBERS ARE STRONG ON SECOND 
CHOICE. IF THERE ARE DISTRICTS 

01:52:26.414 --> 01:52:28.647
WHERE SANDERS IS NOT VIABLE 
WHICH WE MIGHT EXPECT IN A MORE 

01:52:28.845 --> 01:52:30.845
RURAL AREA OR 

01:52:34.258 --> 01:52:37.172
OLDER POPULATIONS, THOSE NUMBERS
ME GO TO ELIZABETH WARREN WHO'S 

01:52:37.367 --> 01:52:39.406
IN THE SAME LANE AS BERNIE IN 
TERMS OF IDEOLOGY. 

01:52:39.407 --> 01:52:41.407
&gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:45.817
ENTRANCE POLLS. THE INFORMATION 
EMILY GUSKIN SHARED. WHAT IS 

01:52:45.818 --> 01:52:48.040
STANDING OUT EUGENE IN TERMS OF 
THE INITIAL DATA? BACK IT LOOKED

01:52:48.238 --> 01:52:51.588
AS IF A LOT OF THE IDEAS WE HAVE
ABOUT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS 

01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:56.133
MILLENNIALS AND OLDER VOTERS AND
RURAL VOTERS AND URBAN VOTERS 

01:52:56.328 --> 01:53:01.161
SEEM TO BE CONFIRMED A BIT, SO 
FAR IN THE DATA SHE GAVE US. IT 

01:53:01.366 --> 01:53:03.369
IS STILL EARLY. ANYTHING COULD 
HAPPEN. THERE 

01:53:07.842 --> 01:53:09.977
IS NOTHING ANYONE SHOULD HANG 
ONTO. THIS IS DATA WE'VE BEEN 

01:53:10.178 --> 01:53:12.713
LOOKING AT FOR A WHILE EVEN 
NATIONALLY AND HAVE SEEN SOME 

01:53:12.916 --> 01:53:15.563
SUPPORT. I THINK IT WILL BE 
REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 

01:53:20.574 --> 01:53:25.320
CANDIDATES DO IN THE COUNTIES 
THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO PERFORM

01:53:25.524 --> 01:53:27.542
REALLY WELL IN AND WHAT THAT 
WILL MEAN AND INDICATE MOVING 

01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:29.740
FORWARD. 
&gt;&gt; WE RECEIVED EXIT POLLS LIKE 

01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:33.644
THESE WERE ENTRANCE POLLS 
BECAUSE THEY SPEAK TO CAUCUS 

01:53:33.847 --> 01:53:36.891
GOERS AS THEY HAD IN. 
&gt;&gt; WE DID NOT GET SEE 

01:53:40.141 --> 01:53:44.193
THE PROFESSOR. WE DID NOT KNOW 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SO 

01:53:44.406 --> 01:53:45.648
UNDECIDED
&gt;&gt; ONE POLL THAT COMES OUT 

01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:48.291
BEFORE THE CAUCUS DID NOT COME 
OUT  DUE TO AN ERROR THAT THEY 

01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:51.825
HAVE SAID, NEGATED THE POLL 
RESULTS SO THEY PULLED IT. THEY 

01:53:52.029 --> 01:53:58.624
DID NOT RELEASE IT. IT'S SO MUCH
MORE OF A MYSTERY ABOUT THE LATE

01:53:58.839 --> 01:54:00.653
DECIDERS. 
&gt;&gt; WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE A LOT

01:54:00.654 --> 01:54:03.709
SO IT SOUNDS ON THE ENTRANCE 
POLL THAT IT WAS 3 IN 10 NOT 

01:54:03.911 --> 01:54:06.544
INSIGNIFICANT TO DECIDE. THOSE 
FOLKS WERE BREAKING TOWARD 

01:54:11.556 --> 01:54:14.269
BIDEN AND BUTTIGIEG. IT'S NOT 
TOTALLY SURPRISING BECAUSE IF 

01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:17.714
YOU ARE FOR BERNIE SANDERS YOU 
ARE FOR BERNIE SANDERS.  YOU ARE

01:54:17.923 --> 01:54:20.359
NOT LIKE OH MAYBE ON FOR BERNIE 
SANDERS OLD YOUR BIDEN. YOU MAY 

01:54:20.562 --> 01:54:25.527
BE FOR ERNIE THE WHOLE TIME AND 
THEY BEEN ORGANIZING TO IDENTIFY

01:54:28.894 --> 01:54:30.933
THOSE PEOPLE AND ACTIVATE THOSE 
PEOPLE TO GET THEM INVOLVED BUT 

01:54:31.136 --> 01:54:33.136
NO ONE IS BREAKING HIS WAY LATE.
ELIZABETH WARREN 

01:54:37.947 --> 01:54:40.468
IS SOMEONE WHO I THINK HAD HOPED
TO BENEFIT FROM THE LATE 

01:54:40.673 --> 01:54:42.862
DECIDERS THAT SHE WAS DOING WELL
IN THE SUMMER AND LOST SOME 

01:54:43.063 --> 01:54:45.752
OXYGEN, PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS 
STUCK BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF 

01:54:45.956 --> 01:54:47.956
THE CANDIDATES. IT WAS 
INTERESTING 

01:54:52.788 --> 01:54:56.383
THAT EMILY AND HER REPORT THAT 
OUR NUMBERS DO NOT SHOW THAT SHE

01:54:56.581 --> 01:54:58.581
WAS WHEN PEOPLE THAT BENEFITED 
FROM THE LATE DECIDERS. IT 

01:54:58.596 --> 01:55:02.411
DOESN'T MEAN SHE DIDN'T DO WELL 
EARLIER BUT IT DOES SUGGEST SHE 

01:55:02.617 --> 01:55:04.751
DID NOT HAVE THE MOMENTUM THAT 
PERHAPS HER CAMPAIGN HAD HOPED 

01:55:04.946 --> 01:55:06.168
FOR. 
&gt;&gt; THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF 

01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:09.713
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS 
WRAPPING UP THIS WEEK BUT IT'S 

01:55:09.929 --> 01:55:14.595
OVERSHADOWED THE IOWA CAUCUS 
BECAUSE CANDIDATES WERE LOCKED 

01:55:15.812 --> 01:55:17.812
IN WASHINGTON. RHONDA COLEMAN 

01:55:20.478 --> 01:55:23.934
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING EVERY TWIST 
AND TURN AND JOINS US. 

01:55:23.935 --> 01:55:28.611
&gt;&gt; HOW ARE THEY BALANCING 
CAMPAIGNING WITH THEIR DAY JOBS?

01:55:28.811 --> 01:55:31.463
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THERE ARE 
APPROACHES HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. 

01:55:31.664 --> 01:55:34.497
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR AND SENATOR 
WARREN HAVE NOT BEEN SHYING AWAY

01:55:37.148 --> 01:55:39.148
FROM CAMERAS. EACH DAY OF THESE 
PROCEEDINGS THEY HAVE FOUND 

01:55:39.273 --> 01:55:43.073
REPORTERS AND MADE COMMENTS. 
THEY WANT TO CONVEY TO THE 

01:55:43.282 --> 01:55:46.083
VOTERS THAT THEY CAN WALK AND 
CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TYPE. 

01:55:46.284 --> 01:55:48.425
THEY'VE SAID THAT IN SOME OF 
THEIR COMMENTS. I WANTED TO 

01:55:48.623 --> 01:55:50.623
LISTEN 

01:55:52.173 --> 01:55:54.016
TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR FROM THIS 
MORNING WHICH ILLUSTRATES MY 

01:55:54.017 --> 01:55:56.017
POINT. 
&gt;&gt; I MY MOM I CAN DO TWO THINGS 

01:55:56.022 --> 01:55:59.018
AT ONCE. I WILL BE HEADED BACK 
TO IOWA. AND I WAS JUST WITH OUR

01:55:59.219 --> 01:56:03.148
TEAM LATE LAST NIGHT. WE'VE HAD 
HUGE EVENTS WHEREVER WE GO. WE 

01:56:03.349 --> 01:56:05.986
ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT THE 
SURGE. WE ARE KEEPING ONGOING. 

01:56:08.423 --> 01:56:11.270
I'M PUNCHING BEYOND MY WAY WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT MONEY PEOPLE HAVE 

01:56:16.275 --> 01:56:19.478
BEEN SPENDING. WE HAVE BEEN MUCH
MORE FRUGAL AND THAT'S WHY I AM 

01:56:19.678 --> 01:56:22.237
STILL STANDING. I THINK PEOPLE 
PREDICTED WHEN I WAS IN THAT 

01:56:22.456 --> 01:56:24.456
BLIZZARD, I WOULD NOT MAKE IT 
THROUGH MY ANNOUNCEMENT MUCH 

01:56:24.506 --> 01:56:27.522
LESS TO THIS POINT IN THE 
CAMPAIGN. WE KEEP GOING.

01:56:27.523 --> 01:56:32.102
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NOW, ON THE OTHER 
HAND BERNIE SANDERS HAS NOT 

01:56:32.306 --> 01:56:35.900
REALLY SOUGHT OUT ANY MEDIA. HE 
HAS NOT STOPPED THE REPORTERS IN

01:56:36.456 --> 01:56:39.717
THE HALLWAY AND WHEN HE HAS 
THEY'VE BEEN SHORT COMMENTS. BUT

01:56:39.919 --> 01:56:42.260
HE IS THE FRONT RUNNER SO 
PERHAPS HE DOESN'T FEEL HE NEEDS

01:56:42.458 --> 01:56:46.416
TO DO THAT. SENATOR MICHAEL 
BENNET IS STILL IN THE RACE AND 

01:56:46.617 --> 01:56:51.809
HIS CAMP SAID THEY ARE WILL 
FOCUS ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IN 

01:56:52.009 --> 01:56:55.360
FACT HE'S ONLY BEEN TO IOWA ONCE
IN THE LAST MONTH. HE HAS BEEN 

01:56:55.571 --> 01:56:57.587
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE 50 TIMES FOR 50
TOWN HALLS. 

01:57:01.844 --> 01:57:03.844
HIS TONE.
&gt;&gt; 

01:57:05.505 --> 01:57:07.505
THANK YOU. RHONDA HAS BEEN 
SURROUNDED BY REPORTERS 

01:57:11.393 --> 01:57:13.938
IN COLLEGE. CAPITOL HILL HAS 
BEEN SO BUSY AND IT WILL BE SO 

01:57:14.136 --> 01:57:16.595
BUSY TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE STATE
OF THE UNION. THERE ARE SO MANY 

01:57:16.797 --> 01:57:20.744
HISTORIC EVENTS BACK TO BACK 
THIS WEEK. THIS HAS BEEN A REAL 

01:57:20.948 --> 01:57:23.077
BLOW TO THE SENATORS WHO BEEN 
STUCK IN WASHINGTON ACTING AS 

01:57:23.276 --> 01:57:25.276
JURORS. WE MAY LOOK BACK 

01:57:27.646 --> 01:57:29.904
ON THAT AND WE WILL SEE HOW 
INFLUENTIAL IT WAS OR ULTIMATELY

01:57:30.115 --> 01:57:33.828
NOT INFLUENTIAL ON THEIR ABILITY
TO PERFORM. WHAT WAS YOUR SENSE 

01:57:34.028 --> 01:57:36.028
OF IT 

01:57:38.413 --> 01:57:40.036
THIS WEEKEND? 
&gt;&gt; ONE THING I NOTICED THIS 

01:57:40.037 --> 01:57:42.037
WEEKEND WITH THE SENATOR'S 
ABSENCE IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS 

01:57:42.116 --> 01:57:45.930
TO HAVE HIGH PROFILE SURROGATES.
I WENT TO ELIZABETH WARREN 

01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:48.978
RALLY'S WHERE THE SENATOR WAS 
ABSENT BECAUSE SHE WAS VOTING. 

01:57:49.179 --> 01:57:51.214
BUT REPRESENTATIVE AYANNA 
PRESSLEY WAS THERE A MEMBER OF 

01:57:52.431 --> 01:57:57.501
THE SQUAD. JULIAN CASTRO FORMER 
HOUSE SECRETARY WHO HAD A HIGH 

01:57:57.713 --> 01:57:59.713
PROFILE PRESIDENTIAL 

01:58:01.167 --> 01:58:02.999
CAMPAIGN HIMSELF. ONCE THE 
EVENTS WHERE BERNIE SANDERS WAS 

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
NOT 

01:58:08.002 --> 01:58:10.502
REPRESENTED BUT ILHAN OMAR WAS 
THERE. AMY KLOBUCHAR HAS NOT HAD

01:58:10.705 --> 01:58:12.132
HIGH PROFILE SENATORS OR 
SURROGATE SHOULD I SAY.

01:58:12.133 --> 01:58:14.768
&gt;&gt; SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HAVING MORE OF A GRASSROOTS 

01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:19.033
SURROGATES.
&gt;&gt; SHE HAS A CURLING WINNER? HER

01:58:19.339 --> 01:58:24.320
DAUGHTER ABIGAIL HAS BEEN OUT 
SHE'S 24 AND VERY IMPRESSIVE. 

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:27.970
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS TAKING OVER HER 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND AMY" SHAR WAS 

01:58:28.186 --> 01:58:36.102
TOUTING ABOUT THE REAL PEOPLE. 
&gt;&gt; PEGGY FLANAGAN THE NEW 

01:58:36.315 --> 01:58:39.151
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THE 
HIGHEST-RANKING NATIVE AMERICAN 

01:58:40.569 --> 01:58:42.604
PUBLIC OFFICIAL. SHE'S BEEN 
CAMPAIGNING BUT YOU ARE RIGHT. 

01:58:42.804 --> 01:58:47.683
IT'S NOT THE SQUAD. IT'S NOT AOC
AND I THINK KLOBUCHAR WILL 

01:58:49.304 --> 01:58:51.304
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.
&gt;&gt; THE 

01:58:52.755 --> 01:58:54.880
QUESTION IS, IF SHE CAN GET 
THOSE SURROGATES OR THE HOME 

01:58:55.091 --> 01:59:00.485
GROUND SURROGATES TO CONNECT 
PERSONALLY BUT THAT MIGHT MAKE A

01:59:00.692 --> 01:59:02.736
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE 
RETAIL POLITICKING BUT IT MAY 

01:59:03.527 --> 01:59:05.527
NOT BEING PEOPLE TO 

01:59:08.194 --> 01:59:10.651
YOUR RALLY. NO ONE WILL WANT TO 
COME AND SEE THE CURLING CHAMP 

01:59:10.865 --> 01:59:13.726
TO SEE AOC. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S TRUE. WE TALKED ABOUT 

01:59:14.027 --> 01:59:19.163
HOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PARTICIPATING ARE LIKE POLITICAL

01:59:19.366 --> 01:59:23.631
GEEKS. THEY ARE LIKE OH WOW, 
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO MASSACHUSETTS

01:59:23.831 --> 01:59:27.904
THAT I KNOW THIS CONGRESSPERSON 
AND I'M WILLING TO WAIT AN HOUR 

01:59:28.112 --> 01:59:30.138
AFTER THE EVENT THAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO START TO 

01:59:33.584 --> 01:59:35.584
GO HERE. WE SEE THE POWER 

01:59:37.856 --> 01:59:39.856
OF SURROGATES. I'M WATCHING THAT
BECAUSE I'M WONDERING HOW THAT 

01:59:39.887 --> 01:59:42.553
WHILE PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
AND SOUTH CAROLINA, ESPECIALLY 

01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:46.666
BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF 
SURROGATES IS TO HELP YOU WITH 

01:59:46.874 --> 01:59:48.874
COMMUNITIES YOU MAY NOT BE DOING
SO 

01:59:51.874 --> 01:59:54.108
WELL WITH ON YOUR OWN. IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 

01:59:54.315 --> 01:59:56.461
CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT THAT 
POPULAR AND DON'T HAVE POPULAR 

01:59:56.658 --> 01:59:58.658
SURROGATES ARE ABLE 

02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.031
TO DO. 
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR, HOW HAS THE 

02:00:02.032 --> 02:00:03.251
ABSENCE OF THOSE CANDIDATES 
SHAPED THINGS? 

02:00:03.252 --> 02:00:05.252
&gt;&gt; IT 

02:00:08.259 --> 02:00:11.794
KILLS MOMENTUM, IF YOU ARE 
HAVING RALLIES AND SUDDENLY YOU 

02:00:11.998 --> 02:00:14.026
CAN'T HAVE RALLIES. MOMENTUM 
SEEMS TO MATTER A LOT IN THESE 

02:00:14.232 --> 02:00:16.244
EVENTS. PERHAPS IF THE CAUCUSES 
HAD BEEN HELD TWO OR THREE 

02:00:17.872 --> 02:00:19.775
MONTHS EARLIER, ELIZABETH WARREN
WOULD BE COMING OUT STRONGER 

02:00:19.776 --> 02:00:21.776
THAN SHE 

02:00:24.915 --> 02:00:27.827
IS TODAY. I MEAN JUST BEING AWAY
FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL MAKES A 

02:00:28.027 --> 02:00:30.027
DIFFERENCE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
A POTENTIALLY HELPS OTHER 

02:00:30.173 --> 02:00:32.173
CANDIDATES WHO CAN AVOID THE 
WASHINGTON SHOW, PEOPLE LIKE JOE

02:00:33.505 --> 02:00:36.969
BIDEN WHO NO LONGER HAS TO 
PRESIDE OVER THE SENATE AS VICE 

02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:38.827
PRESIDENT. POTENTIALLY, THAT 
GIVES HIM AN ADVANTAGE ALTHOUGH 

02:00:38.828 --> 02:00:40.828
IT'S HARD TO KNOW AND IT'S HARD 
TO MEASURE 

02:00:43.674 --> 02:00:45.716
THESE THINGS AS A POLITICAL 
SCIENTIST. THIS IS TOUGH TO DO 

02:00:45.918 --> 02:00:49.876
TO WHAT EXTENT THAT IT MATTERS 
WE KNOW IT MATTERS SOME BUT WE 

02:00:50.074 --> 02:00:52.074
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN WILL 

02:00:55.045 --> 02:00:57.517
YOU KNOW? WILL YOU TELL US 
TOMORROW OR WILL IT TAKE A YEAR?

02:00:57.714 --> 02:00:58.923
HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THESE 
THINGS? 

02:00:58.924 --> 02:01:02.564
&gt;&gt; THANKFULLY, THAT IS NOT -- WE
HAVE SOME TIME IT'S NOT 

02:01:02.798 --> 02:01:06.605
SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO. 
&gt;&gt; HOW UNIQUE IS THAT FEEL TO 

02:01:06.810 --> 02:01:08.810
HAVE THE SENATORS LOCKED 

02:01:12.241 --> 02:01:14.556
IN WASHINGTON? 
&gt;&gt; THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ONLY 

02:01:14.755 --> 02:01:17.991
THREE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL SO THE 
NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION WAS 

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:20.454
THERE. IT WAS NOT ON THE JURORS.
IT WAS ON THE LAWYERS 

02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:22.660
PRESENTING. IT WAS ON PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP. I THINK THAT 

02:01:22.798 --> 02:01:27.755
MATTERS SOME BUT WHO KNOWS HOW 
MUCH. I GUESS WE WILL FIND OUT. 

02:01:27.961 --> 02:01:30.202
&gt;&gt; THE CAMERAS WERE NOT ON THE 
JURORS OR THE SENATORS 

02:01:33.642 --> 02:01:35.790
BECAUSE JOURNALISTS DID NOT GET 
TO ROLL THE CAMERAS IN THE 

02:01:35.987 --> 02:01:38.016
SENATE. IT WAS FEED CONTROLLED 
BY THE SENATE SO OUR REPORTERS 

02:01:38.215 --> 02:01:40.554
COULD LOOK IN AND SEE THE 
SENATORS LIKE SENATOR SANDERS 

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:47.245
STARING BLANKLY AS THE 
&gt;&gt;&gt; DON. EVERYTHING WAS 

02:01:47.448 --> 02:01:49.690
HAPPENING BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO 
GET BACK THIS WEEKEND AND HIT 

02:01:49.907 --> 02:01:53.547
THE TRAIL ONE LAST TIME BEFORE 
HEADING TO WASHINGTON. LET'S GO 

02:01:53.756 --> 02:01:55.756
BACK 

02:01:57.208 --> 02:01:59.752
TO WASHINGTON WHERE DAVID BYLER 
IS AND HE CAN TAKE US BACK TO 

02:01:59.952 --> 02:02:01.767
SOME OTHER INFLUENTIAL CAUCUS 
RESULTS AND PUT TONIGHT INTO 

02:02:01.768 --> 02:02:03.768
CONTEXT. JOKE 

02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:07.669
THANKS LIBBY. HERE AT 
HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:10.817
WE BEEN PARSING THROUGH THE 
HISTORICAL DATA. WE'VE BEEN 

02:02:11.019 --> 02:02:13.019
LOOKING AT CONTENDERS IN PAST 
YEARS AND NOW CONGRESS SHOOK 

02:02:13.052 --> 02:02:15.052
OUT. THE FINDINGS 

02:02:17.114 --> 02:02:19.550
HAVE BEEN THAT THE IOWA CAUCUS 
DOES NOT ALWAYS CROWN THE 

02:02:19.756 --> 02:02:24.217
NOMINEE BUT IT OFTEN DOES HELP 
PEOPLE GET TO THE FINALS. IF WE 

02:02:24.419 --> 02:02:26.663
LOOK BACK INTO THE HISTORICAL 
RECORD WE CAN LOOK AT THE 2016 

02:02:26.866 --> 02:02:30.929
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IS. WE HAVE 
HILLARY CLINTON BARELY EDGING 

02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:34.774
BERNIE SANDERS OUT IN THAT YEAR.
IF YOU REMEMBER, HILLARY CLINTON

02:02:34.987 --> 02:02:39.972
WAS LEADING FOR ALL OF 2015 WITH
A REALLY LARGE MARGIN. SANDERS 

02:02:40.179 --> 02:02:44.527
SORT OF ATE AWAY AT THAT MARGIN 
AND GOT CLOSE IN IOWA. THAT SORT

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:49.206
OF HELPED HIM SNOWBALL AND GAIN 
MOMENTUM ENTERING THE CONTEST 

02:02:49.409 --> 02:02:51.409
INTO A SORT OF PROTRACTED FIGHT.

02:02:54.078 --> 02:02:56.712
HILLARY CLINTON CAP THE LEAD BUT
THAT'S HOW HIS CHALLENGE GOT 

02:02:56.941 --> 02:02:58.941
LEGS. THAT SAME YEAR, ON THE 
REPUBLICAN 

02:03:01.194 --> 02:03:03.339
SIDE, WE REALLY HAD A WILD 
ELECTION NIGHT IF YOU REMEMBER 

02:03:03.539 --> 02:03:05.550
THAT FOUR YEARS AGO. WE HAD 
DONALD TRUMP LEADING IN THE 

02:03:05.747 --> 02:03:10.129
PRE-ELECTION POLLS BUT COMING IN
SECOND IN THE FINAL COUNT. YOU 

02:03:10.332 --> 02:03:13.577
HAD TED CRUZ, JUMPING AHEAD OF 
HIM. MARCO RUBIO WENT FROM A 

02:03:13.782 --> 02:03:18.263
DISTANT THIRD INTO A REALLY 
CLOSE THIRD WITH TRUMP. NOW, AS 

02:03:18.461 --> 02:03:22.412
WE ALL KNOW TRUMP ENDED UP 
WINNING THE NOMINATION AFTER 

02:03:22.613 --> 02:03:25.769
GETTING SECOND AND I WHAT. THAT 
SHAPED THE RACE. TED CRUZ WAS 

02:03:25.975 --> 02:03:29.835
ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE HIS BLOCK 
THERE AND THAT GAVE HIM 

02:03:30.048 --> 02:03:34.395
LONGEVITY AND MADE HIM A TOP 
CONTENDER. MARCO RUBIO WAS ABLE 

02:03:34.615 --> 02:03:37.354
TO SURGE AFTER THAT TEMPORARILY 
AND ALSO BECOME ONE OF TOM'S 

02:03:37.754 --> 02:03:41.009
TOUGHER COMPETITORS IN THAT 
CONTEST. IOWA SHAPED THE RACE  

02:03:41.218 --> 02:03:47.108
FOUR YEARS AGO ON THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE. IF WE THINK BACK BEFORE 

02:03:47.307 --> 02:03:52.781
THAT WE CAN REMEMBER WHEN RICK 
SANTORUM SURGED AT THE END AND 

02:03:52.995 --> 02:03:57.461
BARELY BEAT MITT ROMNEY. THIS 
WAS SUCH A WILD CONTEST. 

02:03:57.661 --> 02:04:00.913
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PRIMARY 
MITT ROMNEY WAS BASING OFF 

02:04:01.111 --> 02:04:05.892
AGAINST A REVOLVING SET OF 
SURGEON DECLINE COMPETITORS. 

02:04:06.101 --> 02:04:08.101
RICK SANTORUM HIT HIS STRIDE AT 
THE 

02:04:12.213 --> 02:04:14.735
RIGHT TIME. IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE 
THE CAUCUSES HAPPEN, HE BEAT HIS

02:04:14.933 --> 02:04:16.933
POLLS ELECTION DAY AND BARELY 
EDGED OUT MITT ROMNEY. THAT 

02:04:17.054 --> 02:04:21.428
ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME MITT 
ROMNEY'S CHIEF COME PREDATOR. HE

02:04:21.633 --> 02:04:23.664
LOST TO BARACK OBAMA IN 2012 
ELECTION BUT THAT'S HOW SANTORUM

02:04:23.864 --> 02:04:28.208
MADE IT TO THE FINALS IN THAT 
YEAR. NOW, IF WE THINK BACK TO 

02:04:28.417 --> 02:04:30.417
FOUR YEARS BEFORE THAT WE HAVE 
THAT 2008 DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS 

02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:35.453
WHICH MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT AND WILDEST RESULT OF 

02:04:35.652 --> 02:04:40.115
ALL THE ONES WE'VE GONE THROUGH 
SO FAR. BARACK OBAMA MET A STATE

02:04:40.317 --> 02:04:44.379
THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE
GOOD HELPING HIM JUMP IN THE 

02:04:44.587 --> 02:04:49.163
POLLS TO BECOME THE FRONT 
RUNNER. JOHN EDWARDS SLID INTO 

02:04:49.362 --> 02:04:52.713
SECOND PLACE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO
SURVIVE UNTIL SUPER TUESDAY. 

02:04:52.913 --> 02:04:54.545
HILLARY CLINTON HAD A 
DISAPPOINTING FINISH THAT SHE 

02:04:54.546 --> 02:04:56.989
REBOUNDED FROM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
IT REALLY DID SHAPE THE RACE AND

02:04:57.190 --> 02:05:00.229
GIVE OBAMA THAT MOMENTUM HE 
NEEDED. THAT IS SOME OF THE 

02:05:00.438 --> 02:05:03.687
HISTORY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING 
THROUGH HERE. 

02:05:03.688 --> 02:05:08.143
&gt;&gt; OKAY, DO WE EXPECT ANY 
HISTORIC OUTCOMES TONIGHT? 

02:05:08.144 --> 02:05:13.636
&gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO SAY WHO WOULD 
WIN. IF WE DO HAVE A BUTTIGIEG 

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:15.839
WIN THAT WOULD BE 

02:05:17.901 --> 02:05:20.055
HISTORIC  PETE BUTTIGIEG IS THE 
FIRST OPENLY MAJOR CANDIDATE IN 

02:05:20.256 --> 02:05:23.829
EITHER PARTY'S PRIMARY , THAT I 
CAN THINK OF IN HISTORY. 

02:05:24.029 --> 02:05:27.439
ELIZABETH WARREN IS TRYING TO 
BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE 

02:05:27.651 --> 02:05:31.112
PRESIDENT. SHE WANTS TO START IN
IOWA AND RIDE THE MOMENTUM. IT 

02:05:31.311 --> 02:05:33.311
COULD BE SANDERS 

02:05:35.357 --> 02:05:37.831
OR BIDEN. IT IS ALL CHAOS RIGHT 
NOW IN TERMS OF WHERE THE 

02:05:38.033 --> 02:05:39.470
DIFFERENT CANDIDATES ARE. BACK 
TO YOU, LIBBY. 

02:05:39.471 --> 02:05:43.890
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DAVID. THE HISTORY 
THAT'S ON THE BACK OF THIS 

02:05:44.104 --> 02:05:46.957
CAUCUS IS SO INTERESTING TO 
RELIVE. 

02:05:46.958 --> 02:05:50.916
&gt;&gt; I'VE COVERED EVERY SINGLE 
ONE. I WAS THERE COVERING IT. 

02:05:51.131 --> 02:05:53.131
THAT 2012 RACE, ON 

02:05:55.875 --> 02:05:58.935
ELECTION NIGHT, ROMNEY WAS 
DECLARED NARROWLY THE WINNER AND

02:05:59.138 --> 02:06:01.694
IT TURNED OUT WHEN EXTRA BALLOTS
CAME IN SANTORUM EVENTUALLY WAS 

02:06:05.226 --> 02:06:07.469
THE WINNER. IN THE HISTORY BOOKS
IT SAYS RICK SANTORUM OF THE 

02:06:07.667 --> 02:06:09.667
FRONT PAGE OF THE DES MOINES 
REGISTER SAID ROMNEY NARROWLY 

02:06:09.712 --> 02:06:13.549
WINS. BY THE TIME WE DECLARED 
SANTORUM IT WAS ALREADY THE 

02:06:13.748 --> 02:06:18.237
SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY. I WAS A 
DINER WITH RICK SANTORUM WHEN 

02:06:18.439 --> 02:06:23.503
THE IOWA REPUBLIC HE SAID WE 
SCREWED UP. SANTORUM TECHNICALLY

02:06:23.813 --> 02:06:27.777
WON AND HE WAS LIKE HE SHOULD 
LOSE HIS JOB. SANTORUM WAS 

02:06:27.979 --> 02:06:31.669
INCREDIBLY BITTER AND ANGRY. HE 
FELT LIKE HE HAD BEEN DENIED 

02:06:31.881 --> 02:06:38.135
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS BIG 
SHOT OF MOMENTUM. AS FAR AS RICK

02:06:38.338 --> 02:06:41.781
SANTORUM WAS CONCERNED IT DIDN'T
MATTER. 

02:06:41.782 --> 02:06:44.528
&gt;&gt; MAYBE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS 
BUT NOT IN THE MOMENT. LET'S 

02:06:44.742 --> 02:06:48.090
CHECK IN WITH HANNA JEWELL WHOSE
HERE AT DRAKE UNIVERSITY. WHAT'S

02:06:48.291 --> 02:06:50.937
GOING ON NOW ?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THINGS WERE 

02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:54.149
STRESSFUL HERE IF YOU 

02:06:57.751 --> 02:07:00.289
HAVE ANXIETY. WE WERE TALKING TO
SOME SANDERS SUPPORTERS WHO HAD 

02:07:00.490 --> 02:07:02.736
A PLAN TO GO TO A DIFFERENT 
CANDIDATE. AS SOON AS THEY 

02:07:02.935 --> 02:07:04.743
ANNOUNCED AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE REALIGNMENT PERIOD, THEY 

02:07:04.744 --> 02:07:09.109
SPRINTED PAST ME. IT WAS 
AMAZING. I STARTED RUNNING. I'M 

02:07:09.306 --> 02:07:12.275
GLAD YOU'RE WITH IS NOW. WE ARE 
GOING TO TRY TO STICK THE 

02:07:12.485 --> 02:07:14.697
MICROPHONE INTO SOME 
CONVERSATIONS. IT'S CHAOTIC 

02:07:15.107 --> 02:07:22.210
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW CHAOTIC IT 
IS. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE CORY

02:07:22.410 --> 02:07:26.277
BOOKER VIABLE BECAUSE THEY WORK 
FOR HIM PREVIOUSLY. I DON'T KNOW

02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:28.480
IF WE KNOW WHERE THESE 

02:07:30.946 --> 02:07:35.414
LABS ARE. WE DON'T WANT TO HURT 
ANYBODY. I'M GOING TO SNEAK IN. 

02:07:35.622 --> 02:07:37.846
I'M NOT GOING TO GET COUNTED. 
TELL US WHAT 

02:07:41.711 --> 02:07:43.641
YOU'RE DOING? 
&gt;&gt; JOE BIDEN IT WASN'T VIABLE SO

02:07:43.642 --> 02:07:45.992
WE ARE COMBINING UNDER CORY 
BOOKER TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM 

02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:47.602
BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH 
WARREN. 

02:07:47.603 --> 02:07:51.463
&gt;&gt; Reporter: EVEN THOUGH HE IS 
OUT OF THE RACE AND YOU COULD 

02:07:51.661 --> 02:07:55.533
JUST LEAVE OF YOUR CANDIDATE 
ISN'T VIABLE, WHY DO THIS? WHY 

02:07:55.732 --> 02:08:00.410
CAUCUS FOR NON-VIABLE CANDIDATE?
&gt;&gt; WE THINK IT'S THE BEST THING 

02:08:00.618 --> 02:08:03.134
FOR JOE BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN IN THE 
LONG RUN. 

02:08:03.135 --> 02:08:05.280
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THERE'S A STRATEGY.
WAS THIS THE PLAN BEFOREHAND OR 

02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:10.150
DID YOU JUST COME UP WITH THIS? 
&gt;&gt; NO IT WAS NOT A PLAN UNTIL WE

02:08:10.346 --> 02:08:13.697
FIGURED OUT WE WEREN'T GOING TO 
BE VIABLE AND THEN OUR LEADER 

02:08:13.901 --> 02:08:19.294
FIGURED IT OUT. JOKE SO I WANT 
TO ROAM AROUND. THANK YOU.

02:08:19.295 --> 02:08:21.295
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LET'S TRY TO 

02:08:24.165 --> 02:08:26.165
FIND OKAY, HERE'S A 

02:08:29.789 --> 02:08:31.789
KLOBUCHAR SUPPORTER.

02:08:33.719 --> 02:08:35.719
SHE IS PROUD OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE SYMBOLICALLY CAUCUSING 

02:08:39.203 --> 02:08:44.474
FOR BOOKER.
&gt;&gt; CAN WE SHOUT? HELP, HEIGHT, 

02:08:44.773 --> 02:08:46.939
HUSTLE. HELP TYPE HUSTLE. 

02:08:56.258 --> 02:09:00.527
THANK YOU. THEY ARE COMING TO 
CONTEST AND THEN WE WILL BE ABLE

02:09:00.726 --> 02:09:05.807
TO FILL OUT OUR CURRENT AND THEN
WE CAN GO HOME. THEN WE CAN GO 

02:09:06.015 --> 02:09:08.656
HOME.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: OKAY, WE'VE HEARD A

02:09:08.858 --> 02:09:10.909
PASSIONATE SPEECH FOR CAUCUSING 
FOR NONVIABLE CANDIDATES. LOCAL 

02:09:12.506 --> 02:09:16.171
IT IS. WE HAVE A REPORTER THAT 
DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO US. MORE

02:09:16.410 --> 02:09:20.842
OF A WRITTEN WORD MAN. LET'S 
FIND SOME SANDERS SUPPORTERS. 

02:09:21.052 --> 02:09:28.038
THERE WERE SOME WE HAD A PLAN TO
COME IN OH WAIT THERE IS 

02:09:28.237 --> 02:09:30.237
CONVINCING HAPPENING 

02:09:33.365 --> 02:09:36.088
OVER HERE.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE TRYING TO SHOW THAT WE

02:09:36.304 --> 02:09:39.425
CAN UNIFY AROUND A CANDIDATE. NO
ONE IS 

02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:45.433
EVEN LISTENING. WE ARE TRYING TO
CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN 

02:09:45.632 --> 02:09:50.290
UNIFY BEHIND THE NOMINEE AND 
DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP THE GENERAL 

02:09:50.591 --> 02:09:52.809
ELECTION. I THINK THE SHOW IS 
HERE IS SHOWING WE CAN COME 

02:09:53.342 --> 02:09:54.546
TOGETHER. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: PEOPLE WHO ARE 

02:09:54.547 --> 02:09:56.547
CAUCUSING 

02:09:57.805 --> 02:09:59.459
FOR BOOKER? 
&gt;&gt; WHO ARE TRYING TO PULL 

02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.560
DELEGATES AWAY FROM THE OTHER 
CANDIDATES. 

02:10:01.561 --> 02:10:03.793
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I DON'T WANT TO 
DISTURB YOU BUT I WANT TO 

02:10:04.003 --> 02:10:06.003
LISTEN. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT VIABLE. TO ACTUALLY 

02:10:06.138 --> 02:10:12.438
MAKE THE CHANGE.
&gt;&gt; THE VERY ACTION IS IN THAT 

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:15.688
SURVIVAL? 
&gt;&gt; HE'S VIABLE IN THIS ONE RACE.

02:10:15.896 --> 02:10:18.737
EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE ENTIRE 
WORLD HE'S NOT VIABLE. I HAVE A 

02:10:18.938 --> 02:10:20.938
CORY 

02:10:23.003 --> 02:10:25.535
BOOKER SHIRT. I LIKE HIM. I WANT
TO MAKE CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY 

02:10:25.735 --> 02:10:28.005
AND WE CAN TAKE THE VALUE 
KLOBUCHAR AND YANG HAVE AND PUT 

02:10:28.204 --> 02:10:30.204
THEM TO GOOD USE. WE 

02:10:32.134 --> 02:10:38.035
CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. THE POINT IS
TO COME TOGETHER AS A PIRATE.

02:10:38.036 --> 02:10:40.036
&gt;&gt; COME 

02:10:41.885 --> 02:10:43.885
JOIN US.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN CONVINCE ME TO GO 

02:10:46.765 --> 02:10:48.833
TO KLOBUCHAR. IF YOU CAN 
CONVINCE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR 

02:10:49.036 --> 02:10:51.036
SOMEONE THAT'S RUNNING THAT 
WOULD BE INCREDIBLE. I DON'T SEE

02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:55.376
THAT COREY IS RUNNING RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 

02:10:55.571 --> 02:10:59.368
PUTTING OUR EFFORTS IN DEMOCRATS
TOGETHER FOR THE FUTURE INSTEAD 

02:10:59.566 --> 02:11:00.807
OF FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ALREADY 
OUT. 

02:11:00.808 --> 02:11:04.541
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ARE YOU CONVINCED?
&gt;&gt; NO. 

02:11:04.542 --> 02:11:07.727
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT WILL YOU DO? 
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO STICK WITH THE 

02:11:09.317 --> 02:11:10.933
GROUP. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU ARE WITH THE 

02:11:10.934 --> 02:11:17.233
KLOBUCHAR GROUP? CARRY-ON. 
&gt;&gt; GOOD LUCK. I HOPE IT WORKS 

02:11:18.251 --> 02:11:20.251
WELL.
&gt;&gt; 

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:23.142
Reporter: RUNAROUND, YET WE 
DON'T WANT TO BOTHER PEOPLE 

02:11:23.143 --> 02:11:26.991
WHILE THEY WORK. LOOK AT HIM GO.
LOOK AT THAT SPRIGHTLY YOUTH. 

02:11:27.191 --> 02:11:29.191
HE'S 

02:11:30.232 --> 02:11:35.431
MAKING IT. THIS IS A LARGE BOOK 
A CREW THAT LOOKS TO BE VIABLE. 

02:11:35.635 --> 02:11:37.955
WE HAVE BUTTIGIEG SUPPORTERS 
LOOKING OVER. WE CAN  RETURN TO 

02:11:38.155 --> 02:11:43.025
THEM AND PERHAPS THEY ARE 
UNHAPPY THAT THERE VERY VIABLE 

02:11:43.238 --> 02:11:46.074
CANDIDATE ISN'T WINNING PEOPLE 
OVER. THIS SEEMS TO BE AN EFFORT

02:11:46.278 --> 02:11:51.759
TO WE CAN BE SANDERS AND WARREN 
SUPPORT. I'M GOING TO TAKE A 

02:11:51.973 --> 02:11:55.625
BREATHER. WE WILL COME BACK WITH
MORE. BACK TO YOU FOR NOW, 

02:11:55.927 --> 02:11:58.674
LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, HANNAH GRAB SOME 

02:11:58.883 --> 02:12:03.755
WATER AND TAKE A BREAK. IT WAS 
SO FASCINATING. THERE IS A LOT 

02:12:03.956 --> 02:12:08.749
OF THE ENERGY.  I LOVE HEARING 
THE BUTTIGIEG SUPPORTER MAKING 

02:12:08.948 --> 02:12:12.517
HIS CASE TO THE GUY  WHO WILL 
NOW CAUCUS FOR CORY BOOKER EVEN 

02:12:12.713 --> 02:12:14.152
THOUGH HE'S DROPPED OUT OF THE 
RACE. 

02:12:14.153 --> 02:12:16.552
&gt;&gt; AND THEN SAYING GOODBYE I'M 
BEN. 

02:12:16.553 --> 02:12:21.432
&gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T VERY ACRIMONIOUS.
DECODE THAT MOMENT. 

02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:25.087
&gt;&gt; IN COLLEGE WE KNOW BERNIE 
SANDERS IS POPULAR FOR THOSE 

02:12:25.302 --> 02:12:28.009
UNDER 30 SO IS ELIZABETH WARREN 
SHE HAS THE COLLEGE EDUCATED 

02:12:28.206 --> 02:12:30.206
WHITE LIBERAL WOMEN. IN 

02:12:32.793 --> 02:12:34.793
THIS INSTANCE, THERE WERE A 
BUNCH OF COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO 

02:12:34.839 --> 02:12:38.378
CAME FOR KLOBUCHAR AND FOR 
BIDEN. DRAKE IS NOT ANY 

02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:42.960
PARTICULARLY LIBERAL SCHOOL. 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE VIABLE. WE

02:12:43.162 --> 02:12:48.042
HEARD FROM THE YOUNG WOMAN, SHE 
SAID OUR LEADER TOLD US THAT WE 

02:12:48.244 --> 02:12:50.884
ARE GOING TO CAUCUS FOR CORY 
BOOKER EVEN THOUGH HE DROPPED 

02:12:51.083 --> 02:12:54.339
OUT OF THE RACE WEEKS AGO. IT 
DOESN'T MATTER. YOU ARE 

02:12:54.542 --> 02:12:57.584
ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO PREVENT OR
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT 

02:12:57.785 --> 02:13:01.750
BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH 
WARREN FROM GETTING MORE 

02:13:01.952 --> 02:13:05.507
DELEGATES BECAUSE THOSE 
DELEGATES COULD IN A STATEWIDE 

02:13:05.715 --> 02:13:09.360
CONTEST BUT BERNIE OR ELIZABETH 
OVER JOE BIDEN. THAT IS WHAT 

02:13:09.562 --> 02:13:12.497
THEY ARE MANEUVERING TO DO. 
THAT'S AN INSTANCE WHERE THAT 

02:13:16.061 --> 02:13:18.124
YOUNG WOMAN IS LISTENING TO THE 
BIDEN PRECINCT LEADER WHO SAYS 

02:13:18.324 --> 02:13:20.948
NOW WE WILL BE FOR CORY BOOKER. 
THOSE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO 

02:13:21.151 --> 02:13:23.151
CONVINCE SOMEONE FROM ANDREW 
YANG 

02:13:26.227 --> 02:13:28.469
AND KLOBUCHAR TO JOIN THEM FOR 
CORY BOOKER AND THE GUY WITH 

02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:30.903
PETE BUTTIGIEG SAID  WHY WOULD 
YOU THROW YOUR VOTE AWAY. THEY 

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:34.144
ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOU WASTE 
YOUR VOTE COME BE WITH BUTTIGIEG

02:13:34.344 --> 02:13:39.427
WHO SHARES THESE VALUES . THESE 
ARE 

02:13:42.478 --> 02:13:46.955
THE BIGGER PRECINCTS WITH MORE 
THAN 1600 PRECINCTS WHERE 

02:13:47.155 --> 02:13:49.786
CONVERSATIONS LIKE THAT ARE 
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN IOWA. 

02:13:49.989 --> 02:13:51.989
THAT'S A GREAT WINDOW INTO 
WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE 

02:13:52.028 --> 02:13:54.057
STATE. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO ANOTHER SITE AND 

02:13:55.266 --> 02:13:59.130
COUNSEL PLOT. JOYCE KOH IS 
THERE. WE WILL THROW IT OVER TO 

02:13:59.945 --> 02:14:01.945
YOU.
&gt;&gt; 

02:14:03.599 --> 02:14:05.599
Reporter: LIBBY, THINGS HAVE 
REALLY STARTED TO WIND DOWN HERE

02:14:05.753 --> 02:14:08.077
AS THE VOTE TOTALS JUST 

02:14:12.331 --> 02:14:14.457
GOT ANNOUNCED. THIS IS THE FINAL
VOTE TOTAL FROM THIS PRECINCT 

02:14:14.656 --> 02:14:19.645
LOCATION IN COUNCIL BLUFFS. PETE
BUTTIGIEG 36.  JOE BIDEN 31. WE 

02:14:20.461 --> 02:14:28.185
HAVE AIMING HOME A CHART 30. 
WARREN 29 AND SANDERS 25. THERE 

02:14:28.389 --> 02:14:30.615
WERE 20 DELEGATES UP FOR GRABS 
AT THIS LOCATION. THE WINNER AT 

02:14:32.244 --> 02:14:35.386
THIS LOCATION PETE BUTTIGIEG GOT
FIVE DELEGATES.  I WANT TO BRING

02:14:35.585 --> 02:14:40.191
IN THE CAPTAIN VICKI McAFEE TO 
TALK ABOUT THIS VICTORY. HOW 

02:14:40.391 --> 02:14:43.210
DOES IT FEEL AFTER MONTHS OF 
CAMPAIGNING AND WORKING HARD FOR

02:14:43.434 --> 02:14:49.102
PETE TO FINALLY COME OUT HERE 
TONIGHT AND HAVE THIS WIN? 

02:14:49.103 --> 02:14:51.103
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
JUST 

02:14:54.381 --> 02:14:56.381
TO REMEMBER THAT MOST PEOPLE 
THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CAMPAIGNS 

02:14:56.525 --> 02:14:58.525
ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS. 

02:15:00.682 --> 02:15:03.150
IT JUST TAKES ALL OF US TO COME 
TOGETHER TO GET SOMETHING DONE 

02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:08.508
THAT'S REALLY POSITIVE. I THINK 
THAT THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE NOT

02:15:08.719 --> 02:15:11.857
ONLY TO PETE'S CAMPAIGN BUT ALL 
OF THE CAMPAIGNS. I THINK WE ALL

02:15:12.058 --> 02:15:16.530
HAVE ONE COMMON GOAL. PETE'S 
TEAM DID GREAT. WE ARE 

02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:23.446
SUPER HAPPY. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU GUYS WERE ABLE 

02:15:23.447 --> 02:15:25.709
TO CONVINCE ONE OF THE YANG 
SUPPORT IS IN THE REALIGNMENT TO

02:15:25.908 --> 02:15:28.138
COME OVER AND SUPPORT FEET. WHAT
DO YOU THINK WOULD BE FINAL 

02:15:28.349 --> 02:15:31.141
BARGAINING POINT BE THAT 
CONVINCED HIM TO COME TO YOUR 

02:15:31.354 --> 02:15:33.795
CAMPAIGN? 
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE FIVE PEOPLE IN 

02:15:35.207 --> 02:15:40.695
ANDREW CIRCLE. THERE WERE TWO 
THAT COULD NOT MAKE THAT 

02:15:40.895 --> 02:15:42.895
DECISION. THE PERSON THAT CAME 
OVER TO 

02:15:46.381 --> 02:15:49.230
OUR TEAM, BASICALLY SAID THAT HE
WAS STILL UNDECIDED. HE CAME IN 

02:15:49.435 --> 02:15:54.298
TODAY AND HE WENT BACK TO THE 
BREXIT VOTES AND TWO OTHER 

02:15:56.936 --> 02:16:02.633
VOTES, WORLDWIDE, WHERE THE 
PROGRESSIVES JUST DID NOT WIN. 

02:16:02.847 --> 02:16:04.847
PEOPLE THAT 

02:16:08.049 --> 02:16:12.588
WERE REALLY TOO FAR RIGHT AND 
TOO FAR LEFT. HE FELT SOMEBODY 

02:16:12.785 --> 02:16:17.053
THAT WAS MORE INCLUSIVE WITH BE 
THE CANDIDATE TO GO WITH. HE 

02:16:19.084 --> 02:16:20.692
CHOSE PETE. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS IS A PRETTY 

02:16:20.693 --> 02:16:25.284
RED AREA. THE STATE HAD 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WIN IN 

02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:30.259
2016 DURING THE PRIMARIES. WHAT 
DO YOU THINK ARE PETE'S VALUES 

02:16:30.464 --> 02:16:32.685
THAT RESONATE WITH SO MANY 
TONIGHT? 

02:16:32.686 --> 02:16:39.402
&gt;&gt; PETE HAS RULES OF THE ROAD. 
THEY ARE JUST BASIC, GOOD HUMAN 

02:16:39.604 --> 02:16:41.604
VALUES RESPECT, TRUTH, 

02:16:44.273 --> 02:16:48.741
BELONGING, BOLDNESS. IF YOU LOOK
AT HIS PETE FOR AMERICA WEBSITE,

02:16:48.945 --> 02:16:53.617
IT REALLY SHOWS YOU THE KIND OF 
PERSON THAT HE REALLY IS. THE 

02:16:53.813 --> 02:16:58.284
KIND OF LEADER HE IS AND IN THE 
END, IT'S BRINGING EVERYONE 

02:16:58.495 --> 02:17:00.495
TOGETHER FOR A 

02:17:02.964 --> 02:17:08.553
COMMON GOOD. HE BACKHANDED IT. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANK YOU SO MUCH 

02:17:08.755 --> 02:17:13.732
FOR JOINING US. CONGRATULATIONS.
LIBBY, I WANT TO SEND IT BACK TO

02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:17.898
YOU. IT'S INTERESTING, AS WE SEE
THE RESULTS FROM THE REST OF THE

02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:21.064
STATE COME OUT. IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW COUNCIL 

02:17:21.261 --> 02:17:23.261
BLUFFS 

02:17:24.901 --> 02:17:27.338
IS EITHER A DEPARTURE OR IS IN 
LINE WITH THE OTHER RESULTS FROM

02:17:27.638 --> 02:17:30.210
MORE DEMOCRATIC OR LIBERAL AREAS
OF THE STATE. YOU HEARD ME 

02:17:30.409 --> 02:17:35.054
MENTION PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
WON HERE IN 2016 BERNIE SANDERS 

02:17:37.087 --> 02:17:40.155
WON HERE. WE WERE WONDERING IF 
BERNIE WOULD WIN AGAIN OR IF 

02:17:40.364 --> 02:17:43.177
THERE WOULD BE A MODERATE 
CANDIDATE THAT WON OUT OF 

02:17:45.623 --> 02:17:47.655
COUNCIL BLUFFS. I THINK WE SAW 
OUR ANSWER AT THIS PRECINCT 

02:17:47.963 --> 02:17:50.912
LOCATION FROM ABE LINCOLN HIGH 
SCHOOL IN COUNCIL BLUFFS. 

02:17:50.913 --> 02:17:54.153
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JOYCE KOH.  LET'S 
BRING IT BACK TO PROFESSOR 

02:17:54.759 --> 02:17:56.759
HASSID . WHAT ARE YOU 
INTERPRETING 

02:18:00.042 --> 02:18:02.042
OR NOTING ABOUT THESE RESULTS? 
THEY ARE ISOLATED PRECINCTS NOT 

02:18:03.083 --> 02:18:05.206
AN AGGREGATE OR WE CANNOT SAY 
THEY REPRESENT WHAT ELSE IS 

02:18:05.405 --> 02:18:07.876
HAPPENING. WE DON'T KNOW YET BUT
WHAT YOU GET? BUT THIS IS GOOD 

02:18:09.383 --> 02:18:12.833
NEWS FOR BUTTIGIEG WHOSE PICKED 
UP A LARGE PRECINCT.  THIS IS 

02:18:13.033 --> 02:18:17.104
ALSO MORE URBAN THAN THE REST OF
THE STATE. IT SORT OF A BAJA 

02:18:17.302 --> 02:18:19.302
SUBURB 

02:18:21.167 --> 02:18:23.167
AREA. IF BUTTIGIEG'S PERFORMING 
WELL IN URBAN AREAS THAT'S A 

02:18:23.287 --> 02:18:26.675
GOOD SIGN FOR HIM . HE IS 
OBVIOUSLY APPEALING MORE TO THE 

02:18:26.875 --> 02:18:30.923
MODERATE WING OF THE PARTY. WE 
WOULD EXPECT. WE HEARD BERNIE 

02:18:31.131 --> 02:18:34.375
SANDERS WON LAST TIME. IT'S 
INTERESTING THIS AREA SEEMS TO 

02:18:34.573 --> 02:18:38.022
HAVE MODERATED MY AT LEAST FOR 
THIS CAUCUS. WHICH SUGGESTS WHAT

02:18:38.224 --> 02:18:44.524
WE DON'T KNOW YET FOR THIS 
PRECINCT IT'S A DATA POINT THAT 

02:18:44.724 --> 02:18:46.724
SUGGESTS PERHAPS THE URBAN AREAS
ARE MOVING MORE TOWARDS 

02:18:47.363 --> 02:18:49.363
MODERATES. MAYBE, I GUESS WE 

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:53.342
WILL SEE.
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE AN ASSOCIATE 

02:18:53.343 --> 02:18:55.492
PROFESSOR AT IOWA STATE 
UNIVERSITY. WE SAW THE PRECINCT 

02:18:55.703 --> 02:19:00.775
THAT DRANK THAT HANNA JEWELL IS 
THAT HAD A LOT OF YOUNG COLLEGE 

02:19:00.985 --> 02:19:02.985
STUDENTS. WHOEVER WAS IN THE 
AREA CAN GO 

02:19:07.279 --> 02:19:09.511
TO CAUCUS. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO 
HAVE YOUR STUDENTS INVOLVED IN 

02:19:09.711 --> 02:19:11.558
THIS PROCESS AND HAVE THEM 
PARTICIPATE IN LEARNING CLASS 

02:19:11.559 --> 02:19:15.404
BUT ALSO BE A CAUCUS GOER? 
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF THEM LIKE IT. 

02:19:15.608 --> 02:19:19.865
THERE'S A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF 
DISINTEREST IN WELL MOST PEOPLE 

02:19:20.065 --> 02:19:22.065
AREN'T 

02:19:25.065 --> 02:19:26.980
POLITICS JUNKIES. IN THE 
POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT WE 

02:19:26.981 --> 02:19:29.217
HAVE MORE THAN OUR FAIR SHARE 
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THERE ARE 

02:19:33.487 --> 02:19:35.814
CAMPUS SEEING MISFORTUNE OF 
LIVING IN AN AREA THAT HAS A LOT

02:19:36.017 --> 02:19:38.017
OF 

02:19:40.591 --> 02:19:42.232
UNDECIDED VOTERS. THERE'S A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CANVASSING.

02:19:42.233 --> 02:19:45.063
EVERY WEEKEND WE ARE BOMBARDED 
AT OUR HOUSE AND ON OUR PHONES 

02:19:45.268 --> 02:19:47.573
AND A LOT OF IT IS DONE BY 
COLLEGE STUDENTS. IT'S A 

02:19:47.792 --> 02:19:53.189
TESTAMENT TO THEIR ENERGY. 
&gt;&gt; EUGENE, WHAT IS IT TO YOU AS 

02:19:53.396 --> 02:19:57.141
WE SAW THEM GET A LAY OF THE 
LAND?

02:19:57.142 --> 02:20:02.739
&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE 
AT JOYCE SITE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS 

02:20:02.942 --> 02:20:06.188
THAT THINGS WRAPPED UP. I THINK 
WHEN YOU MAY HAVE SOME 

02:20:10.037 --> 02:20:12.037
MORE OLDER VOTERS NOT 
NECESSARILY THE OLDEST BUT NOT 

02:20:12.887 --> 02:20:16.547
COLLEGE STUDENTS. THEY CAME AND 
HAD THEIR IDEAS. SOME PEOPLE WON

02:20:16.771 --> 02:20:19.585
AND SOME DID NOT. THEY WERE MORE
PERSUADABLE TO 

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:26.921
MAKE DECISIONS. THEY ARE GOING 
HOME AND PROBABLY GOING TO EAT 

02:20:27.133 --> 02:20:29.623
DINNER, CARE FOR THEIR KIDS AND 
GET READY FOR WORK. WHERE AS THE

02:20:30.158 --> 02:20:33.195
COLLEGE STUDENTS, WE SAW HOW 
HARD HE TRIED TO PERSUADE THAT 

02:20:33.407 --> 02:20:35.407
GUY AND HE WAS NOT 

02:20:37.463 --> 02:20:39.994
HAVING IT. THERE IS SOME SUPPORT
TO IT, IT SEEMS. NOT THAT THE 

02:20:40.191 --> 02:20:44.577
CONVICTIONS WERE NOT REAL OR 
DEEP BUT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT 

02:20:44.819 --> 02:20:47.422
MORE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT 
THEIR FIRST CHOICE WAS NOT THE 

02:20:47.625 --> 02:20:51.697
DIRECTION THEY WANTED TO GO. IT 
MAY BE THE STEREOTYPE THAT 

02:20:51.899 --> 02:20:53.899
YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE 

02:20:57.301 --> 02:20:59.301
MORE IDEALISTS AND HAVE 
CONVICTIONS THAT THEY ARE LESS 

02:20:59.446 --> 02:21:01.918
WILLING TO WAIVER ON. IT SEEMED 
TO BE THE CASE IN THAT EXAMPLE. 

02:21:02.124 --> 02:21:04.497
&gt;&gt; JAMES, IF THE GROUP YOU 
CAUCUS WITH REACHES THE 

02:21:04.703 --> 02:21:06.703
THRESHOLD YOU ARE LOCKED IN. IF 
YOU 

02:21:11.195 --> 02:21:13.575
ARE UNDECIDED AND IF YOU ARE 
WAFFLING, YOU CANNOT TAKE THE 

02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:16.202
TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM IN ROUND
ONE AND THEN SAY OH YOU CALLED 

02:21:16.398 --> 02:21:20.136
MY BLUFF. I DID NOT REALIZE 
WARREN WOULD NOT BE VIABLE. I 

02:21:20.345 --> 02:21:24.610
SEE THAT SHE IS IN TROUBLE AND 
I'M SHIFTING. YOU ARE LOCKET IT 

02:21:24.810 --> 02:21:30.698
IN. IF YOU'RE AT 15%. EVEN IF 
YOUR WHEN THE A GROUP THAT'S NOT

02:21:30.902 --> 02:21:35.174
VIABLE CAN YOU MOVE AROUND AND 
CHOOSE ANOTHER PLACE TO GO. 

02:21:35.175 --> 02:21:38.622
&gt;&gt; THAT IS GOING TO LIMIT HOW 
MUCH OF WHAT WE SEE AT DRAKE. 

02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:43.192
LAST TIME, MARTIN O MALLEY WAS 
TECHNICALLY IN THE RACE IN 2016 

02:21:43.396 --> 02:21:47.768
BUT IT WAS A TWO-WAY RACE. YOU 
DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH 

02:21:47.971 --> 02:21:49.971
HORSETRADING BECAUSE THERE 
WEREN'T THAT MANY HORSES TO 

02:21:50.002 --> 02:21:52.002
TRADE. IN 2008 

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:56.472
JOHN EDWARDS, IT WAS VERY 
SURPRISING THAT HE FINISHED 

02:21:56.502 --> 02:22:00.572
SECOND AND HILLARY CLINTON 
FINISHED THIRD. IT WAS PARTLY 

02:22:00.781 --> 02:22:05.227
BECAUSE OF HIS STRENGTH IN THESE
ROOMS, WHERE HIS PEOPLE WERE 

02:22:05.519 --> 02:22:07.519
ORGANIZED. THERE SHOULD BE 

02:22:09.497 --> 02:22:11.739
LESS FLUIDITY. THERE CLEARLY IS 
GOING TO BE SOME. I THINK THERE 

02:22:11.938 --> 02:22:15.396
WAS CONCERN AMONG THE CAUCUS 
PURIST THAT THE RULE YOU JUST 

02:22:15.692 --> 02:22:22.097
EXPLAIN WOULD MEAN PEOPLE WERE 
LOCKED INTO ANDREW YANG AT 15% 

02:22:22.303 --> 02:22:27.164
AND WERE NOT ABLE TO GO DECIDE 
BETWEEN THE TWO MOST CREDIBLE 

02:22:27.391 --> 02:22:29.815
CANDIDATES. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE A STATEMENT VOTE. 

02:22:30.025 --> 02:22:33.271
I'M DECLARING A STATEMENT FOR 
THIS CANDIDATE EVEN THOUGH I'M 

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:37.434
ULTIMATELY GOING TO SUPPORT 
SOMEONE ELSE. THIS YEAR THAT'S 

02:22:37.638 --> 02:22:39.710
DANGEROUS AND IT'S DANGEROUS TO 
SAY YOU AREN'T DECIDED. THAT CAN

02:22:40.983 --> 02:22:44.648
ITSELF BE A 15% BLOCKAGE. 
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEN YOUR VOTE IS 

02:22:45.862 --> 02:22:48.497
ESSENTIALLY WASTED. IF YOU'RE 
GOING IN AND SAYING I'M AND 

02:22:48.708 --> 02:22:53.579
DECIDED IN 20% SAY THEY ARE 
UNDECIDED YOU ARE OUT. THERE ARE

02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:58.450
AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
BECAUSE THERE ARE AREAS WHERE 

02:22:58.661 --> 02:23:00.661
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN ON THE 
VERGE OF BEING AT THAT 

02:23:00.768 --> 02:23:04.756
THRESHOLD. SOMEONE LIKE AMY 
KLOBUCHAR, STATEWIDE MAYBE UNDER

02:23:04.986 --> 02:23:07.311
THE THRESHOLD BUT IN CERTAIN 
AREAS OF THE STATE WILL BE RIGHT

02:23:07.522 --> 02:23:12.878
AT THE THRESHOLD. SO, HOW THAT 
PLAYS OUT WILL BE FASCINATING TO

02:23:13.083 --> 02:23:15.112
WATCH. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE FIRST ROUND NUMBER 

02:23:15.317 --> 02:23:19.480
IN THE SECOND ROW NUMBER. 
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE ARE 

02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:23.847
STILL GATHERING TO DISCUSS THEIR
PICKS AND POTENTIALLY REALIGNED 

02:23:23.848 --> 02:23:27.492
TO CHOOSE THE SECOND CANDIDATE. 
WE EXPECT RESULTS TO COME IN 

02:23:27.705 --> 02:23:30.753
SHORTLY. LET'S GO BACK TO OUR 
ELECTION AND 16 AND THE DIRECTOR

02:23:30.957 --> 02:23:35.430
OF ENGINEERING JEREMY BOWERS. WE
JUST HEARD FROM JAMES BUT TELL 

02:23:37.655 --> 02:23:39.655
US HOW TODAY'S FIELD COMPARES TO

02:23:43.542 --> 02:23:44.970
2016?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN 2016 IT WAS A 

02:23:44.971 --> 02:23:47.212
SIMPLE SET UP AND IT WAS A 
MATHEMATICIAN STREAM. IF THIS IS

02:23:47.419 --> 02:23:51.574
WHAT YOU WANTED WE HAD TWO 
CANDIDATES. ONE REPRESENTED THE 

02:23:51.775 --> 02:23:53.775
REAL ESTABLISHMENT RING OF THE 
PARTY AND ONE THAT REPRESENTED 

02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:58.167
THE SORT OF PROGRESSIVE WING 
MARTIN O MALLEY SORRY ABOUT 

02:23:58.373 --> 02:24:02.142
THAT. WE WEREN'T REALLY TAKING A
LOT OF VOTES AWAY FROM HILLARY 

02:24:02.339 --> 02:24:05.496
CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS IN 
2016. THAT MADE IT REALLY EASY 

02:24:09.552 --> 02:24:11.795
FOR FOLKS WHO WERE LOOKING TO 
SEE HOW THINGS WOULD SHAKE OUT 

02:24:12.098 --> 02:24:14.115
BECAUSE THEY CAN LOOK AT THE TWO
LANES OF CANDIDATES AND 

02:24:14.321 --> 02:24:16.865
UNDERSTAND A LOT. THIS YEAR WE 
HAVE SEVEN CANDIDATES IN THE 

02:24:17.071 --> 02:24:19.909
DEBATES PLUS THIS BILLIONAIRE 
WHO MAYBE ISN'T QUALIFYING IN 

02:24:20.111 --> 02:24:24.692
THE EARLY STATES BUT WHOSE 
POLLING EXCEEDINGLY WELL. WHAT 

02:24:24.891 --> 02:24:28.296
WE REALLY SEE IS THIS CROWDED 
FIELD. THAT FIELD MAKES IT 

02:24:28.493 --> 02:24:31.700
DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TRYING ANY 
KIND OF FORECASTING OR A LITTLE 

02:24:31.906 --> 02:24:33.906
A 

02:24:35.957 --> 02:24:38.494
LOOK AHEAD. THING THAT I WANTED 
TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL AS THAT 

02:24:38.708 --> 02:24:40.708
NUMBER OF UNDECIDED VOTERS. 
THAT'S THE THING THAT MAKES OUR 

02:24:40.825 --> 02:24:43.472
JOB DIFFICULT. A LOT OF ISLANDS 
WERE EXPLAINED TO US EITHER AT 

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:48.354
THE ENTRANCE PULL RESULTS OF THE
REPORTERS IN THE FIELD THAT THEY

02:24:48.555 --> 02:24:51.601
HAD NOT MADE UP THEIR MIND JET. 
DELETE POLLING SHOWED IT UPWARDS

02:24:51.807 --> 02:24:53.807
OF 

02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.620
MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF FOLKS 
HADN'T DECIDED AND THAT'S A 

02:24:57.830 --> 02:25:00.049
CRAZY HIGH NUMBER FOR US THIS 
LATE IN THE PROCESS. WE WOULD 

02:25:00.291 --> 02:25:04.403
EXPECT MANY MORE FOLKS HAVE AN 
IDEA OF WHO THEY LIKE TO VOTE 

02:25:04.599 --> 02:25:08.163
FOR WHEN THEY SHOW TO THE CAUCUS
SITE. ALL OF THAT LENDS TO EXTRA

02:25:08.366 --> 02:25:10.100
UNPREDICTABILITY TO WHAT'S A 
FAIRLY UNPREDICTABLE PROCESS 

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:12.929
WHEN YOU THROW IN THINGS LIKE 
VIABILITY STANDARDS, THAT MAKES 

02:25:13.129 --> 02:25:18.810
ALL OF US HERE AT THE ELECTION 
INSIDE CENTER JUST A LITTLE BIT 

02:25:19.105 --> 02:25:21.556
NERVOUS. I WILL ADD IN THAT WE 
ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE FIRST 

02:25:21.764 --> 02:25:26.538
NUMBERS TO COME IN. UNTIL WE GET
THOSE, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO 

02:25:26.738 --> 02:25:28.778
SOMEONE HERE AT THE TABLE A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HE'S 

02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:31.107
LOOKING AT. LENNY WE HAVEN'T 
SEEN THE FIRST NUMBERS AT BUT 

02:25:31.305 --> 02:25:34.867
ONE DAY WE WILL. WHAT IS IT YOU 
ARE LOOKING AT UNTIL WE GET 

02:25:35.065 --> 02:25:37.065
THEM? 
&gt;&gt; UNTIL WE GET THEM A LOOKING 

02:25:40.136 --> 02:25:42.586
AT WAITING. WE'VE SEEN RUMBLINGS
OF VERY EARLY NUMBERS BUT WE 

02:25:42.793 --> 02:25:46.440
CANNOT CONFIRM THEM. ONCE THOSE 
NUMBERS COME IN I WILL LOOK TO 

02:25:48.066 --> 02:25:50.066
SEE HOW THEY COMPARE TO THE 

02:25:52.735 --> 02:25:55.094
2016 RESULTS. THE IDEA IS TO 
MAKE AN INFERENCE OF WHAT THAT 

02:25:55.294 --> 02:25:57.294
MEANS FOR WHERE 

02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.546
HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE 
SANDERS VOTERS ARE GOING THIS 

02:26:01.547 --> 02:26:03.699
TIME AND USING THAT WE CAN 
EXTRAPOLATE INTO THE FUTURE FOR 

02:26:03.903 --> 02:26:05.318
THE OTHER PRECINCTS THAT ARE NOT
REPORTED. 

02:26:05.319 --> 02:26:07.603
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S WHAT WE WILL
LOOK AT HERE AT THE ELECTION 

02:26:07.807 --> 02:26:09.600
INSIDE CENTER. UNTIL THEN BACK 
TO YOU. 

02:26:09.601 --> 02:26:13.266
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. WE ARE GIGGING OUT
EUGENE BUT TO GREAT RESULTS 

02:26:13.584 --> 02:26:16.707
BECAUSE WE CAN UNDERSTAND MORE. 
WHEN YOU ATTENDED RALLIES AND 

02:26:16.917 --> 02:26:20.388
EVENTS THIS WEEK AS YOU'VE BEEN 
REPORTING, TWO IT'S THE 

02:26:23.409 --> 02:26:25.733
SENT THE PEOPLE WERE SHOPPING OR
WOULD THEY SUPPORT SOME OF THAT 

02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:27.930
THEY ALREADY LIKE? 

02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:31.951
IF THEY WERE AT A WARREN RALLY 
WHERE THEY COMMITTED? 

02:26:31.952 --> 02:26:34.793
&gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO QUITE A FEW VOTERS
WHO WERE COMMITTED. VERY FEW 

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.047
PEOPLE WERE STILL SHOPPING. MOST
PEOPLE I SPOKE TO HAD NARROWED 

02:26:39.449 --> 02:26:42.913
IT DOWN. 
&gt;&gt; TWO OR THREE SEEMS LIKE SO 

02:26:43.124 --> 02:26:44.444
MANY.
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY AND WE ARE TRYING 

02:26:44.445 --> 02:26:46.445
TO 

02:26:48.185 --> 02:26:50.440
FIGURE OUT IF THE CANDIDATE THEY
WERE LISTENING TO AT THAT TIME 

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:53.293
WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING TO 
PUT THEM OVER THE LINE TO BE A 

02:26:53.493 --> 02:26:59.768
SOLID PERSON TO SAY THAT WAS 
GOING TO BE BACKED. IT SEEMS 

02:26:59.969 --> 02:27:03.833
CLICHÉ BUT THAT'S NOT CLICHÉ FOR
IOWA. MOST PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY

02:27:04.045 --> 02:27:06.045
WILL DO BY NOW. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH, 

02:27:08.702 --> 02:27:12.153
DID YOU GET A READ ON IF PEOPLE 
WERE LISTENING FOR A PARTICULAR 

02:27:12.367 --> 02:27:14.702
MESSAGE? WAS THERE SOMETHING 
LIKE HEALTHCARE OR ELECTABILITY?

02:27:14.906 --> 02:27:18.653
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT CAN YOU 
BEAT TRUMP AND HOW WILL YOU BE 

02:27:18.867 --> 02:27:22.541
TRUMP AND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO 
ANSWER TO THIS AND HOW WILL YOU 

02:27:22.921 --> 02:27:28.011
STOP TRUMP. PEOPLE WERE CONSUMED
MAKING SURE TRUMP DOESN'T WIN. 

02:27:28.213 --> 02:27:32.878
NOT THAT THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED 
ABOUT POLICY. THERE WERE A LOT 

02:27:33.084 --> 02:27:34.940
OF POLICY QUESTIONS BUT THEY 
WANT TO DEFEAT HIM. 

02:27:34.941 --> 02:27:36.941
&gt;&gt; 

02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:40.570
EUGENE SCOTT, PROFESSOR HASSID, 
JAMES HOMAN. STAY HERE WE WILL 

02:27:40.742 --> 02:27:43.168

IN. WE WILL START 

02:27:47.302 --> 02:27:49.844
LOOKING AT HOW IOWA IS SHAPING 
UP WITH A CROWDED FIELD AND A 

02:27:50.045 --> 02:27:54.203
LOT ON THE LINE . THE FIRST IN 
THE NATION TO WEIGH IN ON JUST 

02:27:54.417 --> 02:27:56.417

02:30:01.773 --> 02:30:04.226
2020 SEASON. I WOULD LIKE TO 
WELCOME MY GUESS MY COLLEAGUE 

02:30:04.425 --> 02:30:08.472
JAMES HOMAN AND EUGENE SCOTT AND
JONATHAN HIS SEED ASSOCIATE

PROFESSOR AT IOWA STATE. THANK 
YOU FOR BEING HERE. EUGENE,

AS WE DO THIS RESET WE ARE 
WAITING FOR THE RESULTS AND WE 

02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:20.872
WILL GET IT ALL IN ONE BATCH. 
PRECINCT BY PRECINCT BUT THE 

02:30:21.086 --> 02:30:24.734
FIRST-ROUND IN THE SECOND ROUND 
OF HOW CAUCUSGOERS  WEIGHED IN 

02:30:24.945 --> 02:30:29.930
WE WON'T GET IT TRICKLING OUT IN
TERMS OF HOW THEY ALIGNED FIRST 

02:30:30.131 --> 02:30:32.131
AND THEN HOW THEY 

02:30:34.273 --> 02:30:36.519
ALIGN SECOND. WE WILL FIND OUT 
HOW EACH AREA WENT IN THE 

02:30:36.719 --> 02:30:38.719
ULTIMATE TALLIES AND WE WILL 
HAVE OUR TEAM IN WASHINGTON 

02:30:38.758 --> 02:30:40.954
BREAK DOWN THE NUMBERS AND 
EXPLAIN WHAT IT MEANS. WHAT ARE 

02:30:41.154 --> 02:30:42.774
YOU WATCHING IN TERMS OF THE 
OVERALL STORY? 

02:30:42.775 --> 02:30:46.871
&gt;&gt; I REALLY WANT TO SEE HOW 
CANDIDATES DO IN AREAS THAT THEY

02:30:47.076 --> 02:30:51.465
WERE NOT EXPECTING TO WIN. THAT 
WILL GIVE SOME IDEA ABOUT HOW 

02:30:51.671 --> 02:30:55.409
THEY CAN DO MOVING FORWARD WITH 
MAYBE SOME DEMOGRAPHICS THEY 

02:30:55.614 --> 02:30:59.056
AREN'T PERFORMING REALLY WELL 
WITH. OUT OF THE NARRATIVE,  

02:30:59.258 --> 02:31:01.500
BUTTIGIEG AND AMY KLOBUCHAR THIS
WEEK IN PARTICULAR  HAVE BEEN 

02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:05.768
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY STRUGGLE IS 
BLACK VOTERS AND LATINO VOTERS 

02:31:05.970 --> 02:31:10.426
IN OTHER MY DORNEY VOTERS. WE 
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY WILL

02:31:10.727 --> 02:31:12.727
PERFORM EVEN IN THE STATE WITH 
SOME OF THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS, 

02:31:12.791 --> 02:31:16.527
WHICH IS MORE A STATE THAT'S 
MORE DIVERSE THAN PEOPLE 

02:31:16.742 --> 02:31:22.720
REALIZE. TO GET SOME TYPE OF 
SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE VIABLE 

02:31:22.945 --> 02:31:24.945
WITH DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE 
NEEDED TO SECURE 

02:31:27.697 --> 02:31:29.342
THE NOMINATION. 
&gt;&gt; WE HEARD HANNAH JEWELL AT 

02:31:29.343 --> 02:31:31.416
DRAKE UNIVERSITY IN D MOWING 
TALKING TO CAUCUS GOERS. IT WAS 

02:31:31.622 --> 02:31:34.196
SO MUCH GOING ON, SO MUCH 
JOCKEYING AND TRYING TO CONVINCE

02:31:36.229 --> 02:31:38.515
OTHER PEOPLE. IT SHOWS THE GLORY
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND 

02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:42.355
THE MESSINESS PICK 
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. ONE THING THAT 

02:31:43.949 --> 02:31:45.884
WAS INTERESTING. THIS IS MY 
FIRST TIME COVERING THE 

02:31:45.885 --> 02:31:49.474
CAUCUSES.  WE LOOK AT ONE IN 
COUNCIL BLUFFS WHICH YOU SAID WE

02:31:49.833 --> 02:31:54.299
WOULD GET ALL THE INFORMATION AT
THE SAME TIME BUT THAT ONE WAS 

02:31:54.612 --> 02:31:56.686
OVER AND THE ONE ON CAMPUS WAS 
STILL GOING ON. 

02:31:56.687 --> 02:32:00.643
&gt;&gt; WE WILL GET THE PRECINCTS WE 
JUST WON'T GET THE FIRST 

02:32:00.851 --> 02:32:03.246
ALIGNMENT SEPARATELY FROM THE 
SECOND ALIGNMENT THROUGHOUT THE 

02:32:03.457 --> 02:32:06.597
NIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS INTERESTING. I KNOW 

02:32:06.809 --> 02:32:10.357
YOU ALL ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH 
THESE AND I WANTED TO KNOW HOW 

02:32:10.568 --> 02:32:15.834
NORMAL A REPRESENTATIVE WITH 
THAT DRAKE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT 

02:32:16.046 --> 02:32:18.199
HAPPENS. WE KNOW NOT EVERY 
CAUCUS IS AT A UNIVERSITY AND 

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.139
WITH STUDENTS. 
&gt;&gt; BUT LET'S GO BACK TO HANNAH. 

02:32:22.361 --> 02:32:25.786
I THINK SHE'S STANDING BY AT 
DRAKE UNIVERSITY WITH MORE .

02:32:25.787 --> 02:32:30.466
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HELLO. THEY ARE 
ANNOUNCING THE DELEGATES RIGHT 

02:32:30.673 --> 02:32:35.544
NOW. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT 
BOOKER NO LONGER IN THE RACE GOT

02:32:35.756 --> 02:32:40.426
ONE DELEGATE. I THINK THE TREND 
12 CREW GOT TWO AND I'M HERE 

02:32:41.017 --> 02:32:45.717
WITH SOME WARREN SUPPORTERS. HOW
DO YOU FEEL? 

02:32:45.718 --> 02:32:49.045
&gt;&gt; I'M EXCITED IT'S GOOD NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I THINK THE 

02:32:49.250 --> 02:32:51.798
REACTION WAS LOWER THAN BEFORE. 
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE THE MOST 

02:32:52.011 --> 02:32:54.011
DELEGATES, THAT'S NOT GREAT BUT 
WE CAN 

02:32:58.628 --> 02:33:00.757
GET THERE.
&gt;&gt; I FELT WE WERE ALL CHATTING 

02:33:00.961 --> 02:33:03.255
AND WAITING FOR THE RESULTS AND 
THEN THE HEART RATES WERE STILL 

02:33:03.456 --> 02:33:05.456
POUNDING. WE CAN REST NOW. 
THAT'S THE MOST EXERCISE I'VE 

02:33:05.531 --> 02:33:09.773
EVER HAD, RUNNING AROUND. HOW DO
YOU FEEL? 

02:33:09.774 --> 02:33:14.588
&gt;&gt; I'M CONFIDENT IN WARREN. IT 
WAS INTERESTING HAVING A LOT OF 

02:33:14.796 --> 02:33:18.208
VOTERS MAKE THEIR OWN CATEGORY. 
I RESPECT EVERYONE'S RIGHT TO 

02:33:18.407 --> 02:33:20.983
DECIDE WHO THEY WANT TO CAUCUS 
FOR AND AS AMERICANS WE ARE FREE

02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:23.888
TO DO SO BUT I'M HAPPY WITH THE 
RESULTS.

02:33:23.889 --> 02:33:27.969
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SATISFIED. YOU 
SEEMED BUSY DURING THE 

02:33:28.179 --> 02:33:32.003
REALIGNMENT, HOW DID THAT GO? 
&gt;&gt; THE REALIGNMENT WAS 

02:33:32.218 --> 02:33:38.515
INTERESTING. THE WARREN TEAM GOT
TWO UNCOMMITTED ON THE OTHER 

02:33:38.717 --> 02:33:40.717
WENT TO 

02:33:42.369 --> 02:33:44.959
BUTTIGIEG.  I KNOW THESE PEOPLE 
I'M A STUDENT AND THESE ARE MY 

02:33:46.234 --> 02:33:48.075
COLLEAGUES AND IT WAS REALLY 
INTERESTING TO CONVINCE MY 

02:33:48.076 --> 02:33:53.429
FRIENDS OF SOMETHING LIKE I AM 
WITH WARREN. THEY KNOW IT. IT 

02:33:53.637 --> 02:33:56.989
WAS INTERESTING TO MAKE THE LAST
MINUTE PUSH. I'M SUPER HAPPY.

02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:58.990
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE 

02:34:00.643 --> 02:34:02.643
ARE SATISFIED. I HEARD 

02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:07.143
YOU EARLIER. THAT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE FINAL 

02:34:07.355 --> 02:34:13.464
COUNT. PEOPLE SEEM HAPPY. I'M 
CURIOUS HOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT 

02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:18.037
THE BIGGER MOVEMENT. THEY 
DECIDED RATHER THAN COME AND 

02:34:18.234 --> 02:34:20.365
LEND THEIR SUPPORT TO SANDERS 
OVER BUTTIGIEG,  ARE THERE ANY 

02:34:23.194 --> 02:34:27.368
STRONG FEELINGS? 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW PERSONALLY A LOT OF 

02:34:27.573 --> 02:34:29.607
PEOPLE WHO WORKED HARD FOR THE 
CORY BOOKER CAMPAIGN. I RESPECT 

02:34:29.817 --> 02:34:33.162
THEIR PASSION FOR THIS 
CANDIDATE. WE ARE ALL HERE TO 

02:34:33.365 --> 02:34:38.132
SUPPORT WHO WE WANT TO SUPPORT. 
I RESPECT THEM STANDING THERE 

02:34:38.350 --> 02:34:43.110
GROUND AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT 
TO DO THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, 

02:34:43.313 --> 02:34:45.761
I'M SUPER HAPPY THAT WE WERE 
ABLE TO GET THIS LARGE GROUP FOR

02:34:45.968 --> 02:34:48.129
WARREN. I THINK IT WORKED OUT. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TELL ME WHY 

02:34:48.338 --> 02:34:51.019
EVERYONE IS SITTING DOWN? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA. 

02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:54.685
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ARE THEY TIRED 
LEGS?

02:34:54.686 --> 02:34:56.715
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY ARE SELECTING 
DELEGATES. 

02:34:56.716 --> 02:34:58.791
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
BE A DELEGATE? 

02:34:58.792 --> 02:35:03.423
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO CLUE. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT ABOUT PRECINCT

02:35:03.635 --> 02:35:06.872
CAPTAIN? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT 
THE BOOKER THING? 

02:35:06.873 --> 02:35:09.322
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT VERY REALISTIC AS 
HE'S OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN. HE'S 

02:35:09.532 --> 02:35:11.532
OUT OF 

02:35:14.594 --> 02:35:20.381
THE RACE. I THINK THAT'S HOW IT 
WORKS. THEY DIDN'T GO AGAINST 

02:35:21.092 --> 02:35:24.338
THE RULES BUT THEY WENT THEIR 
OWN WAY. 

02:35:24.339 --> 02:35:27.583
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT WILL IT BE 
LIKE IN CLASS TOMORROW? 

02:35:27.584 --> 02:35:32.265
&gt;&gt; I THINK MOST OF OUR SCHOOL 
AIR WARREN SUPPORTERS. I THINK 

02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:39.782
IT WILL BE EXPECTED. I THINK IT 
WILL BE A NORMAL DAY. THERE WILL

02:35:40.083 --> 02:35:42.083
BE 

02:35:44.036 --> 02:35:48.527
LESS COMMOTION. A LOT LESS 
POLITICS. THAT HAS BEEN MY 

02:35:48.735 --> 02:35:52.598
ENTIRE DRAKE EXPERIENCE. I'M A 
FIRST-YEAR STUDENT AND NOW THAT 

02:35:52.798 --> 02:35:54.612
IT'S OVER I DON'T KNOW WHAT I 
WILL DO. 

02:35:54.613 --> 02:35:58.672
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT WILL YOU DO? 
&gt;&gt; MAYBE I WILL TRANSFER. 

02:35:58.673 --> 02:36:01.433
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE WILL COME BACK 
TO YOU LIBBY. THINGS ARE CALM 

02:36:01.637 --> 02:36:07.402
AND EVERYTHING IS FINE. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT. THANK YOU HANNAH 

02:36:07.606 --> 02:36:10.036
JEWELL. EUGENE, HOW INCREDIBLE 
TO HAVE YOUR COLLEGE TIME 

02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:13.906
INVOLVED WITH THIS CAUCUS. WHAT 
ARE YOUR TAKEAWAYS? 

02:36:13.907 --> 02:36:19.188
&gt;&gt; IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
SOME STUDENTS WERE LISTENING AS 

02:36:22.022 --> 02:36:24.444
THEIR OPTIONS. I THINK WHAT I 
WOULD ASSUME WHEN WE ARE TALKING

02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:28.377
OUT ABOUT PEOPLE ONLY HAVING ONE
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AFTER THEIR 

02:36:28.734 --> 02:36:30.734
FIRST CHOICE 

02:36:33.604 --> 02:36:35.604
WASN'T SELECTED. THEY'VE CHOSEN 
SOMEONE WHO IS DEFINITELY IN THE

02:36:35.770 --> 02:36:40.506
SAME WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY. TO SEE SOMEONE GO FROM 

02:36:40.727 --> 02:36:44.985
WHAT BUTTIGIEG TO WARN I THINK 
THEY SAID ? IT WAS MODERATE 

02:36:45.275 --> 02:36:47.275
PROGRESSIVE. I WOULD 

02:36:49.037 --> 02:36:54.548
NOT HAVE. I WONDER HOW IT IS 
WORKING OUT AND OTHER PARTS OF 

02:36:54.750 --> 02:36:58.393
THE STATE OR IF IT'S JUST THE 
CAMPUS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE 

02:36:58.608 --> 02:37:02.454
THE EXTRAPOLATION FROM ONE 
CAMPUS ON ESTATE. 

02:37:02.455 --> 02:37:06.919
&gt;&gt; YOUR BRINGING UP A GREAT 
QUESTION OF THE ENERGY ON THE 

02:37:08.136 --> 02:37:12.202
ENTHUSIASM. PROFESSOR AND JAMES 
WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS CAUCUS

02:37:12.403 --> 02:37:16.879
GOING. DO YOU SEE THE SAME 
ENERGY LIKE A SENIOR CENTER OR 

02:37:17.082 --> 02:37:21.343
SOMEPLACE THAT'S OUTSIDE A 
COLLEGE CAMPUS SETTING? 

02:37:21.344 --> 02:37:23.784
&gt;&gt; I'VE ONLY CAUCUSED ON A 
COLLEGE CAMPUS SETTING. I DON'T 

02:37:23.987 --> 02:37:26.424
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AT THE 
SENIOR CENTER. 

02:37:26.425 --> 02:37:28.425
&gt;&gt; THE BAR HAS BEEN SET. 
&gt;&gt; 

02:37:31.906 --> 02:37:33.906
LAST TIME, O'MALLEY WASN'T 
REALLY IN IT IT WAS BETWEEN 

02:37:33.996 --> 02:37:37.214
SANDERS AND CLINTON. THERE WAS A
LOT LESS CONVINCING BUT THE 

02:37:37.423 --> 02:37:41.658
NUMBERS WERE DONE AND EVERYONE 
MOVED ON. THIS DYNAMIC WITH ALL 

02:37:41.869 --> 02:37:43.476
OF THESE CANDIDATES IS 
DEFINITELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT 

02:37:43.477 --> 02:37:47.142
I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. 
&gt;&gt; GET REALLY IS ABOUT 

02:37:47.346 --> 02:37:50.995
PERSONALITY, THE FORCE OF 
PERSONALITY. THESE ARE NOT PAID 

02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.863
STAFFERS, THESE PRECINCT 
LEADERS, SOMETIMES IT'S A 

02:37:55.664 --> 02:38:01.768
NATIONAL SURROGATE. I MEMBER IN 
2008 ANTONIO VIA RUGOSA WAS THE 

02:38:01.975 --> 02:38:05.433
MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES AND TRIED 
TO MAKE THE CASE OVER CLINTON. 

02:38:05.634 --> 02:38:08.283
EVERYBODY WENT TO OBAMA AND 

02:38:11.317 --> 02:38:13.634
HE DISAPPEARED. HE DIDN'T WANT 
TO BE THERE WHEN IT WAS NOT 

02:38:13.835 --> 02:38:17.616
GOING FOR HIS CANDIDATE. IN A 
LOT OF THESE PLACES IT'S LOCAL 

02:38:17.815 --> 02:38:20.659
CIVIC LEADERS WHO ARE RESPECTED 
AND ITS FORCES OF PERSONALITY. 

02:38:20.868 --> 02:38:26.539
THE ARGUMENTS THEY MAKE AREN'T 
THE TALKING POINTS FROM THE 

02:38:26.753 --> 02:38:28.753
CAMPAIGN. THEY SAY FROM THEIR 
HEART WHY THEY THOUGHT THEIR 

02:38:28.792 --> 02:38:33.654
CANDIDATE WAS BEST. THAT'S KIND 
OF COOL. YOU SAW WITH HANNAH'S 

02:38:33.948 --> 02:38:37.918
VIDEO, THE PERSONALITIES. THESE 
ARE KIDS WHO ARE GOING TO BE 

02:38:40.554 --> 02:38:44.314
FUTURE LEADERS. THEY WILL BE 
STACKING UP AND TAKING UPON 

02:38:44.523 --> 02:38:48.893
THEMSELVES TO CONVINCE SOMEONE 
TO CHANGE WHO THEY ARE 

02:38:49.092 --> 02:38:51.160
SUPPORTING. I THINK IT REALLY IS
DEPENDENT ON WHO THE INDIVIDUAL 

02:38:52.747 --> 02:38:54.702
PERSONALITIES ARE. I'M SURE 
YOU'D SEE SIMILAR THINGS PLAY 

02:38:54.703 --> 02:38:57.447
OUT AT A SENIOR CENTER OR IN A 
RURAL AREA WHERE YOU HAD SOMEONE

02:38:57.646 --> 02:38:59.646
WITH A 

02:39:01.883 --> 02:39:03.322
STRONG WILL. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT POLLING 

02:39:03.323 --> 02:39:05.675
AGAIN ON THE ISSUES THAT SEEM TO
MATTER TO DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN 

02:39:05.888 --> 02:39:08.809
IOWA. DAVID BYLER IS IN D.C.. 
DAVID, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM

02:39:09.010 --> 02:39:12.881
PULLING SO FAR?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANKS, LIBBY WE'VE

02:39:13.086 --> 02:39:15.225
LEARNED A LOT FROM THE ENTRANCE 
POLLS SO FAR. IT'S AN 

02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:18.759
INTERESTING SET OF DATA. WITH US
TO TALK THROUGH IT IS EMILY 

02:39:18.962 --> 02:39:21.403
GUSKIN WHO IS HALF OF THE " 
WASHINGTON POST "  IN-HOUSE 

02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:28.188
POLLING TEAM. BEFORE WE GET INTO
ISSUES I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD 

02:39:28.393 --> 02:39:32.762
TO TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S AN 
INTEREST POLL AND NOT AN EXIT 

02:39:32.976 --> 02:39:35.238
POLL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND 
WHAT DOES THE AUDIENCE NEED TO 

02:39:36.629 --> 02:39:38.391
KNOW? 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE USED TO HEARING ABOUT 

02:39:38.392 --> 02:39:43.129
THE EXIT POLLS IN ELECTION AND 
PRIMARY BUT SINCE IOWA IS A 

02:39:43.332 --> 02:39:46.997
CAUCUS NOT A PRIMARY , PEOPLE GO
IN WITH AN IDEA OF WHOM THEY 

02:39:47.298 --> 02:39:51.259
WILL VOTE FOR. THERE ARE PEOPLE 
FROM EDISON MEDIA RESEARCH WHO 

02:39:51.479 --> 02:39:55.331
RUN THE NETWORK ENTRANCE AND 
EXIT POLLS. THEY STAND WITH 

02:39:58.557 --> 02:40:02.624
THE SURVEY, A PAPER SURVEY AND 
ASK PEOPLE AS THEY COME INTO THE

02:40:02.830 --> 02:40:04.830
CAUCUS WHO THEIR INITIAL 
PREFERENCE THAT THEY INTEND TO 

02:40:04.907 --> 02:40:08.733
CAUCUS FOR. NOW OF COURSE WE 
KNOW THAT CAN CHANGE, BECAUSE OF

02:40:09.044 --> 02:40:13.211
A CANDIDATE DOESN'T MEET THE 
THRESHOLD, THE PERSON WHO IS 

02:40:13.417 --> 02:40:15.455
CAUCUSING WILL HAVE TO SWITCH TO
A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. WE'VE GOT

02:40:15.659 --> 02:40:19.610
AN IDEA OF WHO PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING FOR AS THEIR INITIAL 

02:40:19.812 --> 02:40:22.746
PREFERENCE WHEN THEY COME IN 
BECAUSE IT'S AN INTEREST POLL 

02:40:22.954 --> 02:40:24.954
NOT AN 

02:40:26.992 --> 02:40:28.423
EXIT POLL.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SUCH A WILD 

02:40:28.424 --> 02:40:31.471
COMPLICATED PROCESS WITH ALL THE
REALIGNMENTS AND EVERYTHING.

02:40:31.472 --> 02:40:33.520
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ONE THING THAT 
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW IS 

02:40:33.729 --> 02:40:35.729
HOW THE VOTERS THEMSELVES, THE 
CAUCUSGOERS I THINK ABOUT THIS 

02:40:35.775 --> 02:40:39.198
PROCESS.  DID THEY DECIDE JUST 
LAST WEEK, ARE THEY THINKING AND

02:40:40.607 --> 02:40:42.607
ELECTABLE CANDIDATE OR SOMEONE 
WHO'S WITH ME ON 

02:40:45.688 --> 02:40:47.688
THE ISSUES? IS THERE INFORMATION
ABOUT HOW THESE PEOPLE ARE 

02:40:47.739 --> 02:40:49.337
THINKING THROUGH THIS BANANAS 
PROCESS?

02:40:49.338 --> 02:40:52.189
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW FROM THE ENTRANCE 
POLL THEY ASK QUESTIONS 

02:40:52.402 --> 02:40:54.668
INCLUDING WHEN DID YOU MAKE YOUR
DECISION ON WHO TO CAUCUS FOR. 

02:40:54.866 --> 02:41:00.313
AMONG PEOPLE WHO DECIDED IN THE 
LAST FEW DAYS OR EVEN ON THAT 

02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:03.793
DAY,  CAUCUSGOERS WERE MORE 
LIKELY TO CHOOSE  I'M SORRY, I'M

02:41:03.994 --> 02:41:05.994
LOOKING AT THE 

02:41:09.393 --> 02:41:14.117
WRONG THING. THE PEOPLE WHO 
CHOSE THAT DAY -- I DON'T HAVE 

02:41:14.335 --> 02:41:17.175
IT. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL RIGHT. THERE IS 

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:22.558
OTHER STUFF. 
&gt;&gt; YOUR SECOND QUESTION, THOSE 

02:41:22.770 --> 02:41:27.331
WHO AGREE WITH YOU ON THE MAJOR 
ISSUES VERSUS THE CANDIDATE WHO 

02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:30.987
YOU THINK WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO
BEAT TRUMP. THERE'S A BINARY 

02:41:31.188 --> 02:41:34.454
CHOICE ON WHO YOU ARE VOTING 
FOR. AMONG THE 62% OF CAUCUS 

02:41:34.657 --> 02:41:38.503
GOERS WHO SAID THEY WANTED 
SOMEONE WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO BE

02:41:38.712 --> 02:41:42.663
DONALD TRUMP THE GENERAL 
ELECTION. FACE SPLIT ABOUT A 

02:41:42.863 --> 02:41:46.228
QUARTER EACH WENT TO BIDEN AND 
BUTTIGIEG WHILE SLIGHTLY FEWER  

02:41:48.255 --> 02:41:50.255
MY 15% WENT FOR WARREN AND 

02:41:54.275 --> 02:41:57.594
CLOVER SHARK. THAT'S DIFFERENT 
FROM THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE WHO 

02:41:57.793 --> 02:42:00.052
WANTED A CANDIDATE WHO'S CLOSER 
TO THEM ON THE ISSUES WHICH WAS 

02:42:00.253 --> 02:42:02.880
36% OF IOWA CAUCUSGOERS  AND 
THEY WILL LARGELY OR A 

02:42:03.086 --> 02:42:06.531
PLURALITY, 36% SAID THEY WERE 
GOING TO BE CAUCUSING FOR 

02:42:06.735 --> 02:42:08.977
SANDERS. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS SUPER INTERESTING. 

02:42:09.182 --> 02:42:12.836
ONE SHORT, LAST QUESTION. THE 
LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT THE 

02:42:13.648 --> 02:42:15.648
DEMOGRAPHICS AND WHAT 

02:42:17.099 --> 02:42:19.099
BREAKS OUT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER 
DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES THAT ARE 

02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.766
INTERESTING OR POPPING OUT TO 
YOU? 

02:42:20.767 --> 02:42:24.209
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE FIRST TIME 
CAUCUSGOERS IS INTERESTING  

02:42:24.408 --> 02:42:27.058
VERSUS THOSE WHO'VE ATTENDED 
BEFORE. THE FIRST TIMERS IT'S 

02:42:30.298 --> 02:42:32.298
37% IN PRELIMINARY ENTRANCE 
POLLS THAT SAID THEY WERE FIRST 

02:42:32.506 --> 02:42:35.804
TIME CAUCUSGOERS . THEY SPLIT 
THEIR VOTE PRETTY MUCH BETWEEN 

02:42:36.008 --> 02:42:40.487
SANDERS AND BUTTIGIEG , BUT HALF
OF THAT WENT FOR WARREN AND 

02:42:40.784 --> 02:42:42.784
THOSE WHO ATTEND PREVIOUSLY ARE 
ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH 

02:42:42.888 --> 02:42:44.725
DIFFERENT CHOICES. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GREAT INFORMATION 

02:42:44.726 --> 02:42:48.994
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THAT. VERY 
INTERESTING THINGS TO PROCESS. 

02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:52.160
WE WILL HAVE MORE UPDATES ON 
THIS DATA AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS

02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:56.299
A COMES IN. THANK YOU. BACK TO 
YOU, LIBBY. 

02:42:56.300 --> 02:43:00.378
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. LET'S GO TO JOYCE 
KOH WHO'S BEEN IN COUNCIL 

02:43:01.371 --> 02:43:03.371
BLUFFS. 

02:43:05.638 --> 02:43:06.874
HELLO.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANKS HAVE COME TO

02:43:06.875 --> 02:43:08.909
AN END AT ABE LINCOLN HIGH 
SCHOOL IN COUNCIL BLUFFS. WE 

02:43:09.111 --> 02:43:13.870
HAVE ONE GRACIOUS STRAGGLER WHO 
IS A FORMER REPUBLICAN AND 

02:43:14.068 --> 02:43:16.209
SWITCHED PARTIES AND IS NOW 
CAUCUSING FOR THE FIRST TIME. 

02:43:16.418 --> 02:43:20.490
JASON PRYOR THANK YOU FOR BEING 
HERE. TELL ME WHY YOU DECIDED TO

02:43:20.697 --> 02:43:23.113
SWITCH PARTIES AND PARTICIPATE 
TONIGHT? 

02:43:23.114 --> 02:43:25.114
&gt;&gt; I 

02:43:28.119 --> 02:43:30.260
SWITCHED PARTIES BECAUSE OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND JUST THE WAY 

02:43:30.466 --> 02:43:35.098
OUR ADMINISTRATION IS ACTING. 
THE VOTE LAST FRIDAY WAS KIND OF

02:43:39.966 --> 02:43:42.117
A GOT THAT NOBODY CARES WHAT'S 
GOING ON WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION

02:43:42.326 --> 02:43:45.291
AND THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY 
WANT TO. I DON'T KNOW, THEY BURN

02:43:45.494 --> 02:43:50.423
A LOT OF FOSSIL FUELS. I DON'T 
THINK THEY WANT TO KEEP THIS 

02:43:50.935 --> 02:43:54.801
COUNTRY GOING, STRONG. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, IT'S 

02:43:55.005 --> 02:43:59.065
LOOKING LIKE YOU CAUCUSED FOR 
AMY KLOBUCHAR. SHE DID NOT GET 

02:43:59.273 --> 02:44:05.366
AS MANY VOTES AS YOU WOULD LIKE.
WILL YOU CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 

02:44:05.577 --> 02:44:07.434
HER? 
&gt;&gt; I WILL SUPPORT AMY AS FAR AS 

02:44:07.435 --> 02:44:11.866
WE CAN GO WITH IT. AND THAT'S TO
THE PRESIDENCY IN THE WHITE 

02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:16.938
HOUSE. I WANT TO HELP HER AS 
MUCH AS I CAN. AS MUCH AS I CAN.

02:44:16.939 --> 02:44:20.603
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS IS YOUR FIRST 
TIME CAUCUSING. WHAT MOTIVATED 

02:44:20.815 --> 02:44:23.332
YOU TO COME OUT AND DO THIS 
TONIGHT? 

02:44:23.333 --> 02:44:28.327
&gt;&gt; TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH 
OUR COUNTRY AND TO KNOW THAT I 

02:44:28.527 --> 02:44:33.714
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP 
OUT, TO VOICE MY OPINION, TO 

02:44:33.916 --> 02:44:36.861
MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT CAN'T OR THAT WON'T. I NEED

02:44:37.065 --> 02:44:39.065
TO 

02:44:42.041 --> 02:44:44.675
HELP OUT. I WANT TO SEE 
SOMETHING CHANGE IN 

02:44:48.014 --> 02:44:50.862
THIS ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS NOT
THE WAY IT IS. I THINK WE NEED A

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.365
GOOD DEMOCRAT AND THERE, THAT 
CAN CHANGE THIS COUNTRY AROUND. 

02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:04.882
THE MEANNESS, IT'S NOT US. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: PART OF YOUR STORY 

02:45:05.083 --> 02:45:08.934
JASON, YOU ARE NOT FROM COUNCIL 
BLUFFS YOU ARE FROM PACIFIC JUNK

02:45:09.147 --> 02:45:13.615
10 THAT FLOODED OUT LAST YEAR. 
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR HOUSE WAS 

02:45:13.828 --> 02:45:17.171
GUTTED. HOW MUCH DOES CLIMATE 
CHANGE PLAY A PART IN WHY YOU 

02:45:17.669 --> 02:45:20.940
ARE VOTING? 
&gt;&gt; CLIMATE CHANGE IS A LOT OF 

02:45:21.135 --> 02:45:24.169
THE WAY I'M VOTING. I DON'T 
BELIEVE OUR CURRENT 

02:45:24.383 --> 02:45:30.467
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IN IT. I
THINK IT IS TRUTH. IF ALL THE 

02:45:30.677 --> 02:45:35.970
SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD SAY 
SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN OUR 

02:45:36.273 --> 02:45:42.654
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T BELIEVE 
THE SCIENTISTS, I CANNOT BELIEVE

02:45:42.867 --> 02:45:48.651
THAT. BILL NYE THAT WE ALL GREW 
UP WITH. I DON'T THINK HE WOULD 

02:45:48.851 --> 02:45:52.203
STEER US WRONG.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NO HE WOULD NOT. 

02:45:52.412 --> 02:45:56.477
THANK YOU SO MUCH JASON. I HOPE 
YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU

02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:58.680
FOR 

02:46:00.335 --> 02:46:02.473
STICKING AROUND. ONE THING I 
WANTED TO MENTION IS THE FINAL 

02:46:02.671 --> 02:46:04.599
RESULTS FROM THIS CAUCUS 
LOCATION. WE WERE IN ONE 

02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:07.849
LOCATION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 
NIGHT BUT THEY WERE TWO OTHER 

02:46:08.072 --> 02:46:11.621
PRECINCTS CAUCUSES IN THIS 
BUILDING. I WILL RUN THROUGH THE

02:46:13.335 --> 02:46:15.770
44 DELEGATES THAT WERE UP FOR 
GRABS IN THIS BUILDING ALONE. 

02:46:15.977 --> 02:46:22.068
EACH OF THESE, EACH BUTTIGIEG,  
SANDERS AND WARREN ALL GOT 10 

02:46:22.269 --> 02:46:25.963
DELEGATES, NINE WENT TO BIDEN, 
FOUR TO KLOBUCHAR IN ONE TO 

02:46:27.953 --> 02:46:30.195
ANDREW YANG. OUT OF THE 44 
DELEGATES, IT LOOKS LIKE 

02:46:30.396 --> 02:46:33.241
BUTTIGIEG, SANDERS AND WARREN  
IT HAD A THREE-WAY TIE FROM 

02:46:34.868 --> 02:46:39.133
COUNCIL BLUFFS OUT HERE IN 
SOUTHWEST IOWA. BACK TO YOU. 

02:46:39.341 --> 02:46:43.188
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH JOYCE. 
LET'S REINTRODUCE OUR GUEST. 

02:46:43.397 --> 02:46:47.059
JAMES TELL ME WHAT " THE 
WASHINGTON POST " , PETER HANSEN

02:46:47.867 --> 02:46:53.363
FROM GRINNELL COLLEGE AND THANK 
YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU JUST GOT

02:46:53.566 --> 02:46:56.212
BACK FROM A CAUCUS? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT I HAD A CAUCUS 

02:46:56.415 --> 02:47:00.655
IN WEST DES MOINES AND I HAD A 
CHANCE TO SEE BOTH FIRST 

02:47:00.867 --> 02:47:05.040
REFERENCE IN THE REALIGNMENT.
&gt;&gt; DIFFERENT THIS YEAR BECAUSE 

02:47:05.241 --> 02:47:09.211
IN THE FIRST REALIGNMENT IF 
YOU'RE IN A 15% GROUP YOU CANNOT

02:47:09.414 --> 02:47:12.849
MOVE YOU'VE GOT TO STAY. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

02:47:12.850 --> 02:47:17.858
&gt;&gt; WHAT WERE THE FIRST ROUND 
RESULTS? BUT THE FIRST ROUND HAD

02:47:18.057 --> 02:47:20.162
BUTTIGIEG IN THE LEAD FOLLOWED 
CLOSELY BY BERNIE SANDERS  BOTH 

02:47:20.363 --> 02:47:23.217
WERE WELL INTO THE TERRITORY OF 
VIABILITY. AND THEN SQUEAKING 

02:47:23.417 --> 02:47:25.417
INTO VIABILITY WERE JOE BIDEN 
AND 

02:47:29.295 --> 02:47:31.295
AMY KLOBUCHAR. ELIZABETH WARREN 
WAS 2 VOTES SHORT OF BEING 

02:47:31.445 --> 02:47:33.445
VIABLE IN THAT PRECINCT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 

02:47:33.561 --> 02:47:36.008
REALIGNMENT? 
&gt;&gt; THE WARN PEOPLE ATTEMPTED FOR

02:47:36.209 --> 02:47:38.209
A 

02:47:39.661 --> 02:47:42.388
FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF THEY COULD
WIN ANYONE OVER AND GET THE TWO 

02:47:44.128 --> 02:47:45.562
EXTRA VOTERS. 
&gt;&gt; THEY COULDN'T PULL ANYBODY 

02:47:45.563 --> 02:47:48.393
FROM THOSE WHO HAD REACHED 15% 
BUT IF IT WAS IN ANDREW YANG 

02:47:48.602 --> 02:47:51.995
SUPPORTER THEY COULD.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT 

02:47:55.911 --> 02:47:57.911
IN OUR PRECINCT THE NONVIABLE 
CANDIDATES WERE ANDREW YANG, 

02:47:57.943 --> 02:47:59.943
ELIZABETH WARREN,  MICHAEL 
BENNET AND TOM 

02:48:02.814 --> 02:48:04.962
STEYER.  THE QUESTION WAS ONCE 
WE WENT INTO THE REALIGNMENT 

02:48:05.159 --> 02:48:07.159
BEARD COULD ANY OF THOSE 
NONVIABLE GROUPS FORM A VIABLE 

02:48:07.170 --> 02:48:09.388
GROUP AND THE ANSWER WAS NO THE 
WARREN PEOPLE TRIED FOR LITTLE 

02:48:09.926 --> 02:48:12.415
BIT  AND THEN THEY MELTED AWAY 
TO THE OTHER GROUPS. MANY WINTER

02:48:13.178 --> 02:48:16.635
AMY KLOBUCHAR. MANY WENT TO PETE
TO JUDGE SOME STEW SANDERS BUT 

02:48:16.846 --> 02:48:20.288
ONTO JOE BIDEN. 
&gt;&gt; HOW WERE THE RESULTS SHAPED 

02:48:21.711 --> 02:48:26.177
BY THAT, THOSE WHO LEFT WARREN 
AND LEFT THE OTHER LOW THRESHOLD

02:48:26.376 --> 02:48:29.852
GROUPS AND WENT OVER? 
&gt;&gt; PETE BUTTIGIEG  ENDED UP 

02:48:30.049 --> 02:48:34.466
WINNING THAT PRECINCT. BERNIE 
SANDERS WAS CLOSE BEHIND. AMY 

02:48:34.673 --> 02:48:37.759
KLOBUCHAR BOOSTED HER NUMBERS 
COMING IN THIRD.  THAT WAS 

02:48:37.961 --> 02:48:39.992
THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF THE 
WARREN PEOPLE.  BIDEN'S NUMBERS 

02:48:40.393 --> 02:48:42.393
DIDN'T MOVE. 
&gt;&gt; WE WONDERED HOW REALIGNMENT 

02:48:44.661 --> 02:48:47.296
MIGHT HELP WHAT SECOND CHOICE 
VOTES MEANT FOR SOME OF THESE 

02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:50.573
CANDIDATES? 
&gt;&gt; IT'S A DIFFERENT BETWEEN 

02:48:50.774 --> 02:48:54.412
VIABILITY AND NOT FOR SOME 
PEOPLE. I KNOW THIS IS JUST ONE 

02:48:54.615 --> 02:48:58.477
CASE THAT WE KNOW ABOUT SO FAR 
BUT AMY KLOBUCHAR, IS 

02:48:58.679 --> 02:49:01.125
COMPETITIVE IN THIS BASIN AWAY 
SHE WILL PERHAPS WOULD NOT HAVE 

02:49:01.326 --> 02:49:04.986
BEEN IT APPEARS WITHOUT THESE 
OPTIONS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 

02:49:05.381 --> 02:49:07.381
COME OVER AND BE THE 

02:49:10.463 --> 02:49:12.290
SECOND VOTE. 
&gt;&gt; IF WARREN HAD NOT HIT THAT 

02:49:12.291 --> 02:49:14.930
THRESHOLD IT WOULD HAVE MADE A 
DIFFERENCE FOR KLOBUCHAR. WHAT 

02:49:15.132 --> 02:49:17.256
WERE THE EXPECTATIONS FOR WEST 
DES MOINES AND WHAT ARE THEY 

02:49:17.469 --> 02:49:20.204
CURRENTLY? THIS IS JUST ONE 
CAUCUS. 

02:49:20.205 --> 02:49:22.205
&gt;&gt; THE DES MOINES METRO AREA IS 
WHERE I 

02:49:24.884 --> 02:49:26.884
THINK PEOPLE EXPECT PETE 
BUTTIGIEG TO DO WELL. IS NOT 

02:49:27.013 --> 02:49:29.026
THOUGHT OF AS BERNIE SANDERS 
TERRITORY.  IF YOU THINK ABOUT 

02:49:29.226 --> 02:49:32.187
SANDERS YOU THINK UNIVERSITY 
TOWNS, IOWA CITY IN PLACES LIKE 

02:49:32.399 --> 02:49:34.399
GRINNELL AND MY 

02:49:36.253 --> 02:49:40.747
HOME PRECINCT SANDERS AND WARREN
DOMINATED. THOSE ARE THE PLACES 

02:49:40.951 --> 02:49:43.777
WHERE YOU THINK OF SANDERS AS 
BEING DOMINANT. TO SEE HIM 

02:49:43.973 --> 02:49:47.022
COMING IN SECOND WAS STRIKING. 
&gt;&gt; JAMES, AS YOU HEAR 

02:49:50.270 --> 02:49:54.134
PROFESSOR HANSEN TALK ABOUT WHAT
HE SAW WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU?

02:49:54.135 --> 02:49:57.731
&gt;&gt; THAT THE WARREN FOLKS WENT TO
KLOBUCHAR. IT'S ONE OF THOSE 

02:49:57.942 --> 02:50:01.036
THINGS THAT'S FASCINATING THAT I
FOUND IN INTERVIEWS OVER THE 

02:50:01.250 --> 02:50:05.105
WEEKEND. GOING TO HAVE A DOZEN 
PERSONS EVENTS. WARREN IS 

02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:09.664
COMPETING WITH BERNIE SANDERS 
FOR THE LIBERAL VOTE. SHE'S 

02:50:09.868 --> 02:50:12.284
COMPETING WITH AMY KLOBUCHAR FOR
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO VOTE

02:50:12.481 --> 02:50:14.481
FOR WOMEN, AGAIN. SHE IS ALSO 
COMPETING WITH BUTTIGIEG 

02:50:17.288 --> 02:50:21.353
FOR , IN A SEPARATE CONTEST FOR 
COLLEGE-EDUCATED KIND OF WHITE 

02:50:22.971 --> 02:50:26.222
LIBERALS, ESSENTIALLY. IT'S THE 
CENTERLEFT. PEOPLE THAT THINK 

02:50:26.421 --> 02:50:28.893
BERNIE IS TOO EXTREME WOULD 
IDENTIFY 

02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.041
AS LIBERAL. SHE HAS THREE 
FRIENDS AND IT'S FASCINATING 

02:50:34.042 --> 02:50:36.042
BECAUSE IT'S THE KIND OF 
SUBURBAN AREA WHERE THE PEOPLE 

02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:41.052
WHO WERE FOR WARREN, LESS THAN 
15% ARE SUBURBAN WOMEN. THE 

02:50:41.262 --> 02:50:43.262
PEOPLE THAT EUGENE WAS SPEAKING 
ABOUT WHERE 

02:50:47.146 --> 02:50:49.203
THEY PROBABLY, THEY CAME OUT 
STRONG FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 

02:50:49.403 --> 02:50:54.369
22 MIDTERMS. DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE
TO PICK UP 20 SEATS THANKS IN 

02:50:54.568 --> 02:50:57.938
PART TO THEIR STRENGTH IN PLACES
LIKE THAT. I THINK THAT IS 

02:50:59.130 --> 02:51:02.586
REALLY TELLING AND MAYBE COULD 
AUGUR QUITE WELL FOR KLOBUCHAR. 

02:51:02.791 --> 02:51:08.079
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH -- WAKE GO AHEAD. 
&gt;&gt; I 

02:51:11.315 --> 02:51:13.610
HAVE ASKED ABOUT A REMINDER THAT
PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR THE SAME 

02:51:13.813 --> 02:51:16.825
CANDIDATE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.
IT'S NOT NEW, IT'S COMMON BUT 

02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:21.269
LISTENING TO PEOPLE EXPLAIN WHY 
THEY ARE BACKING A CANDIDATE 

02:51:21.478 --> 02:51:25.034
HELPS DESCRIBE OR EXPLAIN, WHO 
THEY WERE WILLING TO GO TO FOR 

02:51:25.243 --> 02:51:27.575
THE SECOND GO AROUND. ONE 
GENTLEMAN AT THAT WAS 

02:51:27.784 --> 02:51:32.244
INTERVIEWED IN COUNCIL BLUFFS 
SAID, CLIMATE CHANGE WAS HIS 

02:51:32.451 --> 02:51:34.451
ISSUE. AMY KLOBUCHAR WAS HIS 
PREFERRED CANDIDATE. I 

02:51:38.130 --> 02:51:40.442
HAD NOT MET MANY AMY KLOBUCHAR 
SUPPORTERS WHO HAD THAT AS THEIR

02:51:41.380 --> 02:51:43.420
FIRST ISSUE. A LOT OF THE 
CLIMATE CHANGE VOTERS WERE GOING

02:51:43.628 --> 02:51:46.478
FOR BERNIE SANDERS FIRST. IT'S 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW PEOPLE 

02:51:46.679 --> 02:51:50.017
FIGURE OUT FOR THEMSELVES WHO 
THEY THINK IS THE BEST PERSON TO

02:51:50.224 --> 02:51:53.171
WIN THE NOMINATION.
&gt;&gt; HOW DIFFERENT IS THE CAUCUS 

02:51:56.213 --> 02:51:58.213
THIS YEAR?
&gt;&gt; 

02:52:00.679 --> 02:52:02.679
IN 2016, THERE WAS A REAL 
TENSION BETWEEN THE CLINTON 

02:52:02.833 --> 02:52:04.833
PEOPLE IN THE SANDERS PEOPLE. I 
THINK WHAT WE SEE 

02:52:08.597 --> 02:52:10.702
THIS YEAR IS MORE UNCERTAINTY, 
YOU'VE GOT A GREATER NUMBER OF 

02:52:10.905 --> 02:52:12.905
CANDIDATES BUT HONESTLY, THE 
PRECINCT I WAS IN WAS HIGH 

02:52:13.073 --> 02:52:18.146
SPIRITS AND FRIENDLY. THAT'S 
SOME KIND OF TENSION BETWEEN THE

02:52:18.346 --> 02:52:20.346
CANDIDATE CAME OUT AND 

02:52:22.414 --> 02:52:24.709
FRIENDLY CHANTING BUT NOT THE 
KIND OF TENSION THAT I THANK YOU

02:52:24.966 --> 02:52:27.303
SAW IMAGE FOUR YEARS AGO. 
&gt;&gt; SOME CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN 

02:52:27.501 --> 02:52:31.573
WARNING ABOUT TENSION IN 
INTRAPARTY STRIFE. 

02:52:31.574 --> 02:52:34.604
&gt;&gt; THE SANDERS FOLKS HAVE BEEN 
NERVOUS ABOUT THEIR PEOPLE. THE 

02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:40.691
SANDERS STRATEGISTS PRIVATELY 
WORRY ABOUT THE BERNIE BROSE AND

02:52:40.901 --> 02:52:43.468
THAT'S WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
FOUR YEARS AGO WHO GAVE A BAD 

02:52:43.664 --> 02:52:47.803
NAME TO THE MOVEMENT JUST BY 
BEING QUITE RUDE TO EVERYONE 

02:52:48.004 --> 02:52:54.936
ELSE AND NASTY, HARASSING. 
SANDERS I THINK HAS TRIED HARD 

02:52:55.143 --> 02:52:57.994
TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE UNDER 
CONTROL AND CHANNEL THAT 

02:53:01.007 --> 02:53:03.077
ENERGY PRODUCTIVELY. IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO SUCCEED YOU HAVE TO 

02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:07.907
BUILD YOUR COALITION. YOU WON'T 
BUILD YOUR COALITION IF IT'S 

02:53:08.121 --> 02:53:10.559
EXCLUSIONARY. I THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN AN EFFORT ON THAT FRONT. 

02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:14.964
EVERYONE ELSE WANTS TO BE THE 
GOOD WARRIOR. PETE BUTTIGIEG 

02:53:15.165 --> 02:53:17.165
WANTS TO BE THE FRIENDLY, 
ACCEPTABLE 

02:53:19.288 --> 02:53:23.140
GUY . HE HAS POSITIONED HIMSELF 
MORE MODERATELY THAN A YEAR AGO.

02:53:23.353 --> 02:53:25.703
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE HE'S GOING
TO WHERE HE SAW AN OPENING IN 

02:53:25.902 --> 02:53:30.054
THE FIELD. EVERYONE IS TRYING TO
SORT OF BE NICE. JOE BIDEN IS AT

02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:34.370
IN A LOT OF WAYS LIKE EVERYONE 
ELSE WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR HIM

02:53:34.572 --> 02:53:36.572
IN THE END AND 

02:53:39.191 --> 02:53:43.058
GOLLY GEE, HE IS NOT BEEN FIERY 
OR ANGRY. IT DOES FEEL DIFFERENT

02:53:43.261 --> 02:53:48.136
THAN PAST CAUCUSES. 
&gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN SOME STAGES AND WE

02:53:48.343 --> 02:53:51.393
WILL WATCH TO SEE IF CANDIDATES 
COME OUT. WE HAVE TO REPEAT THIS

02:53:51.595 --> 02:53:56.766
CAVEAT THE WARNING TO VIEWERS 
THAT IF YOU HEAR A CANDIDATE OR 

02:53:56.970 --> 02:54:01.137
SEE A CANDIDATE SAYING I WON OR 
SUCCEEDED IN IOWA.  BUYER 

02:54:01.355 --> 02:54:05.911
BEWARE. IT'S COMPLICATED THIS 
YEAR. 

02:54:05.912 --> 02:54:08.550
&gt;&gt; YES AND WE ARE GOING TO CALL 
THE RACE BASED ON THE STATE 

02:54:09.055 --> 02:54:13.723
DELEGATE EQUIVALENTS, THAT'S 
AFTER THE REALIGNMENT. THAT DOES

02:54:13.934 --> 02:54:19.421
MATTER. IT DOES MATTER. IT IS 
THE BEST IMPRESSION OF THE 

02:54:19.630 --> 02:54:23.674
OUTCOME IN THE STATE INSTEAD OF 
HOW MANY PEOPLE INITIALLY TAKE A

02:54:23.887 --> 02:54:28.848
CORNER, WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO 
DECIDE. PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO 

02:54:29.046 --> 02:54:33.442
THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THE FIRST 
NUMBERS WILL BE FASCINATING. WE 

02:54:33.642 --> 02:54:38.106
WILL ANALYZE THEM CLOSELY. WE 
HAVE A TEAM OF SUPER 

02:54:38.422 --> 02:54:41.556
PROFESSIONALS IN A GREAT 
ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT TO 

02:54:42.371 --> 02:54:44.371
UNDERSTAND THEM BUT 

02:54:46.638 --> 02:54:48.555
THE SECOND WILL BE MOST 
REVEALING ABOUT WHERE THE 

02:54:48.556 --> 02:54:50.579
CONTEST WILL GO AND WHO HAS THE 
MOST POWER AFTER THE 

02:54:54.142 --> 02:54:55.971
EARLY STATES. 
&gt;&gt; ONE THING TO POINT OUT IS 

02:54:55.972 --> 02:54:57.972
JUST HOW CLOSELY DIVIDED THIS 
PRECINCT WAS. THE THRESHOLD FOR 

02:54:58.013 --> 02:55:01.673
VIABILITY ON THE FIRST REFERENCE
VOTE WAS 33 VOTERS. WARREN CAME 

02:55:01.871 --> 02:55:08.162
IN AT 31. OVERTURE WAS PROBABLY 
AT 34. JOE BIDEN TOO. THE SHIFT 

02:55:08.372 --> 02:55:12.640
OF JUST THREE VOTES IN THIS 
PRECINCT IN ONE DIRECTION OR 

02:55:12.844 --> 02:55:14.844
ANOTHER, TOTALLY CHANGES 

02:55:16.290 --> 02:55:18.728
THE OUTCOME. THAT'S ONE THING WE
HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND. I KNOW 

02:55:18.966 --> 02:55:21.975
THERE'S A COIN FLIP THAT SHUTS 
ELIZABETH WARREN OUT OF THIS 

02:55:22.194 --> 02:55:25.036
PRECINCT. IF THAT BREAKS OR 
DIRECTION A DIFFERENT PRECINCT 

02:55:25.232 --> 02:55:30.114
SHE WILL GET DELEGATES THAT WAY.
IN A CLOSE RACE LIKE THIS IT 

02:55:30.316 --> 02:55:33.355
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 
DIFFERENT PRECINCTS BREAK DOWN. 

02:55:33.550 --> 02:55:35.743
&gt;&gt; MONTHS OF WORK AND MILLIONS 
OF CAMPAIGN DOLLARS GO INTO THE 

02:55:35.948 --> 02:55:40.463
IOWA CAUCUS.  " THE WASHINGTON 
POST " JEREMY BOWERS  JOINS US 

02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:43.714
TO TELL US WHY THE FOCUS ON THE 
MIDWESTERN STATE IS A QUIRK IN 

02:55:43.917 --> 02:55:46.364
OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANK YOU LIBBY. IF

02:55:46.568 --> 02:55:48.568
WE WERE GOING TO PICK A 

02:55:50.615 --> 02:55:52.615
STATE TO EMBODY THE DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTORATE THE ODDS OF US 

02:55:52.728 --> 02:55:56.517
CHOOSING IOWA WOULD BE LOW .  
IOWA HAS THINGS THAT MAKE IT NOT

02:55:56.713 --> 02:55:59.167
A PARTICULARLY GREAT STATE FOR 
THIS . IT'S A LOT BOLDER. IS A 

02:55:59.371 --> 02:56:01.717
LOT LIGHTER AND IS A LOT MORE 
RURAL THAN THE 

02:56:06.253 --> 02:56:08.290
DEMOCRATIC ELECTORATE.  THESE 
ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE IOWA A 

02:56:08.497 --> 02:56:11.137
DIFFICULT PLACE TO HOLD YOUR 
VERY FIRST NOMINATING CONTEST  

02:56:11.342 --> 02:56:13.342
THERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN IOWA IS 
ENTIRELY WITHOUT PLACES THAT 

02:56:13.468 --> 02:56:16.417
LOOK A LOT LIKE  WHAT THE 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTORATE DOES. WE 

02:56:16.621 --> 02:56:18.621
HAVE CITIES LIKE DES MOINES, 
CEDAR RAPIDS AND 

02:56:21.487 --> 02:56:23.673
IOWA CITY. WE HAVE NO RESULTS 
YET BUT WE CERTAINLY DO 

02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:26.122
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE VOTERS THERE
LOOK LIKE AND HOW THEY WILL ACT.

02:56:26.326 --> 02:56:28.326
THAT'S PRETTY SIMILAR TO VOTERS 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED 

02:56:28.523 --> 02:56:31.250
STATES. HERE IS SOMETHING ELSE 
TO CONSIDER IF WE WERE GOING TO 

02:56:31.452 --> 02:56:36.725
PICK A DIFFERENT STATE. MAYBE WE
WOULD USE SOMETHING ENTIRELY 

02:56:36.930 --> 02:56:39.446
DIFFERENT. LET'S GO TO SOMEONE 
HERE WHO HAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN 

02:56:39.648 --> 02:56:41.648
INSIGHT ON THAT. 

02:56:44.988 --> 02:56:47.903
LENNY BRONNER IF YOU ARE GOING 
TO CHOOSE A STATE WHAT STATE 

02:56:48.108 --> 02:56:50.543
WOULD YOU CHOOSE INSTEAD OF IOWA
TO BE THE VERY FIRST OF THE 

02:56:50.752 --> 02:56:51.767
NOMINATING CONTEST FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS? 

02:56:51.768 --> 02:56:53.995
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION
THE SHORT ANSWER IS ILLINOIS BUT

02:56:54.198 --> 02:56:56.198
IN REALITY IT DEPENDS ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS INTERESTED 

02:56:56.312 --> 02:56:58.354
IN PICKING A STATEMENT LOOKS 
MORE LIKE THE ELECTORATE AS A 

02:56:58.551 --> 02:57:00.551
WHOLE OR LIKE 

02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:05.546
THERE'S DEMOCRATIC. IF THEY WERE
TO CHOOSE ONE THAT REPRESENTS 

02:57:05.682 --> 02:57:07.757
THE COUNTRY THEY MIGHT PICK 
ILLINOIS LIKE I SAID OUR 

02:57:07.965 --> 02:57:09.815
CONNECTICUT, PENNSYLVANIA. IF 
THEY WANT ONE THAT LOOKS MORE 

02:57:09.816 --> 02:57:12.270
DEMOCRATIC THEY WOULD CHOOSE NEW
JERSEY. THERE'S A GREAT PIECE 

02:57:12.482 --> 02:57:15.531
ABOUT THIS WRITTEN BY JEFFREY 
SKELLY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD CHECK 

02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:18.780
OUT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GOOD PIECE I READ 

02:57:18.986 --> 02:57:21.454
IT. IF I WAS GOING TO CHOOSE A 
STATE I WOULD CHOOSE FLORIDA. 

02:57:21.664 --> 02:57:26.193
IT'S REALLY LARGE. IT'S REALLY 
DIVERSE. IT HAS A GREAT MIX OF 

02:57:26.392 --> 02:57:29.957
URBAN AREAS, SUBURBAN AREAS, 
EXURBAN AND RURAL AREAS THAT ARE

02:57:30.156 --> 02:57:32.156
FAR FROM 

02:57:34.016 --> 02:57:36.722
THE COAST. ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT IT HAS GOING FOR IT IS THEY

02:57:36.928 --> 02:57:38.930
RUN A RELATIVELY LARGE ELECTION 
YEAR AFTER YEAR, WHICH MAKES IT 

02:57:39.132 --> 02:57:41.732
A PLACE WITH TYPICALLY A SWING 
STATE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ON 

02:57:41.958 --> 02:57:47.817
IOWA AT THE MOMENT  LET'S KICK 
IT BACK FOR YOU ON THE GROUND IN

02:57:48.112 --> 02:57:49.343
IOWA.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU JEREMY. WE ARE 

02:57:49.344 --> 02:57:51.573
STILL WAITING ON RESULTS. WHAT 
WILL IT LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY DO 

02:57:54.935 --> 02:58:01.638
COME IN? JEREMY, CAN YOU HEAR 
ME? YOU ARE LEAVING ME HANGING. 

02:58:01.841 --> 02:58:06.731
WE ARE ALL DESPERATE FOR RESULTS
BUT WHEN THEY DO COME IN HOW 

02:58:06.932 --> 02:58:10.252
WILL YOU CRUNCH THAT DATA? 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE'VE BEEN TALKING 

02:58:10.457 --> 02:58:15.254
ABOUT THAT HERE IN THE STUDIO. 
OUR THOUGHT IS IF WE HAD GOTTEN 

02:58:15.450 --> 02:58:17.489
RESULTS EARLY WE WOULD GET SMALL
PRECINCTS IN COUNTIES THAT WERE 

02:58:18.092 --> 02:58:21.139
PRETTY RURAL USUALLY IN THE WEST
MAYBE TO THE NORTH. NOW WE ARE 

02:58:21.345 --> 02:58:23.345
THINKING THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT 

02:58:26.625 --> 02:58:29.311
OF COUNTING GOING ON AND SO WHEN
WE GET THE RESULTS THERE WILL BE

02:58:29.509 --> 02:58:32.724
A LARGE SWATH OF THE STATE. IT'S
UNLIKELY WE WILL GET A LOT OF 

02:58:32.928 --> 02:58:37.594
URBAN AREAS THOSE ARE TYPICALLY 
THE LAST AND THE PLACES WE WILL 

02:58:37.802 --> 02:58:40.138
LEAST LIKELY TO SEE EARLY 
RESULTS. IF I HAD TO PUT MONEY 

02:58:40.343 --> 02:58:42.979
ON IT, I WOULD SAY WE WOULD SEE 
STUFF FROM RURAL AREAS IN THE 

02:58:43.177 --> 02:58:45.177
WEST END NORTH OF THE STATE.
&gt;&gt; 

02:58:48.765 --> 02:58:51.300
ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE QUIET NOW 
BUT YOU WILL BE SO BUSY REALLY 

02:58:51.506 --> 02:58:54.851
SOON. THANK YOU. EUGENE THIS 
QUESTION IS WHICH STATE IS 

02:58:55.059 --> 02:58:58.921
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC
VERSUS THE REPUBLICAN POPULACE 

02:58:59.126 --> 02:59:01.767
IS SO INTERESTING. WE HEARD 
EARLIER 

02:59:05.824 --> 02:59:08.257
THAT IRELAND'S ARE VERY PROUD OF
THEIR ROLE AS THE FIRST DAY IN 

02:59:08.465 --> 02:59:10.611
THE NATION AND I LOVE YOUR 
INSIGHT ABOUT HOW THEY WERE 

02:59:10.818 --> 02:59:12.818
THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN 

02:59:15.574 --> 02:59:17.610
PERSONAL ISSUES AS VOTERS ASKED 
ABOUT THE ISSUES OF THE NATION 

02:59:17.821 --> 02:59:20.044
IN THEIR NEIGHBORS AND PEOPLE 
WHO MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE THEM. I 

02:59:20.246 --> 02:59:22.631
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU
ABOUT THIS QUESTION OF IOWA'S 

02:59:22.828 --> 02:59:25.740
FUTURE AND HOW SOME OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE 

02:59:25.937 --> 02:59:29.387
WEIGHING IN IN TERMS OF HOW THEY
FEEL ABOUT IOWA. 

02:59:29.388 --> 02:59:33.745
&gt;&gt; DEMOGRAPHICALLY, WE KNOW IOWA
LOOKS DIFFERENT IN ITS 

02:59:33.946 --> 02:59:35.946
POPULATION THAN A 

02:59:38.115 --> 02:59:40.115
DECADE AGO. THERE ARE MORE 
LATINO IMMIGRANTS IN THE STATE 

02:59:40.196 --> 02:59:42.797
THAN MOST REALIZE. THERE'S A 
SIZABLE BLACK POPULATION IN THE 

02:59:42.999 --> 02:59:47.466
MORE URBAN AREAS AND EVEN 
SUBURBAN AREAS LIKE OMAHA, 

02:59:47.666 --> 02:59:51.731
PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF THAT OF 
HIS IOWA BUT YOU HAVE COUNSELED 

02:59:51.932 --> 02:59:53.932
BLUFFS IS A SUBURB 

02:59:56.401 --> 02:59:58.535
OF OMAHA. THIS IS SHAPING SOME 
OF THE CONVERSATIONS IS PEOPLE 

02:59:58.741 --> 03:00:03.108
ARE TRYING TO PROCESS WHETHER OR
NOT IT'S USUALLY IMMIGRATION, 

03:00:03.314 --> 03:00:07.668
FAITH IN POLICE BRUTALITY AND 
ISSUES RELATED TO STUDENTS AND 

03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:10.217
MILLENNIALS TRYING TO BECOME 
FINANCIALLY STABLE 

03:00:14.072 --> 03:00:15.905
AND SECURE. THEY ARE JUST 
LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES THAT 

03:00:15.906 --> 03:00:19.561
COULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE 
ARE SEEING THE IDEA THAT 

03:00:19.764 --> 03:00:23.422
EVERYONE BEING IN THE STATE IS 
OLDER AND WHITE NOT SUPPORTED BY

03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:27.162
THE NUMBERS ANYMORE. 
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR. 

03:00:27.163 --> 03:00:30.214
&gt;&gt;  GET DEPENDS WHAT PART OF THE
STATE YOU ARE IN. IF YOU ARE IN 

03:00:31.338 --> 03:00:33.338
IOWA CITY YOU SEE 

03:00:36.624 --> 03:00:38.759
MORE DIVERSITY. IT'S MUCH LESS 
SO IN THE RURAL AREAS. SOMETIMES

03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:41.495
HAVE LARGE POPULATIONS OF LATINO
WORKERS WHO HAVE SETTLED INTO 

03:00:43.526 --> 03:00:46.171
THOSE AREAS. THEIR POPULATION 
HAS TRANSFORMED DRAMATICALLY. 

03:00:46.377 --> 03:00:48.377
BUT IT'S SCATTERSHOT ACROSS 

03:00:51.245 --> 03:00:53.681
RURAL IOWA. ONE THING THAT IS 
INTERESTING IS THIS HAS A LOT OF

03:00:53.898 --> 03:00:55.360
ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES. WE'VE 
SEEN CANDIDATES LIKE COREY 

03:00:55.361 --> 03:01:00.589
BOOKER DROP OUT OF THE RACE. 
IT'S CONSEQUENTLY JOE BIDEN 

03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:04.857
BECAUSE LACK VOTERS ARE 
ENTHUSIASTIC FOR JOE BIDEN WHEN 

03:01:05.059 --> 03:01:08.205
WE'VE POLLED ABOUT HIM IN THE 
GRINNELL COLLEGE NATIONAL POLL. 

03:01:08.423 --> 03:01:10.423
WE SEE HIGHER LEVELS OF 
ENTHUSIASM FOR BIDEN AMONG BLACK

03:01:10.447 --> 03:01:15.218
THAN WHITE VOTERS. THERE'S A LOT
OF WAYS I THINK IN WHICH RACE IS

03:01:15.421 --> 03:01:17.421
AFFECTING THE START OF THIS 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE. ONE IS 

03:01:17.858 --> 03:01:21.316
PROBABLY THAT WITH HIS GROUP OF 
CANDIDATES, BIDEN WOULD DO 

03:01:21.516 --> 03:01:26.799
BETTER IN A MORE DIVERSE STATE. 
&gt;&gt; ONE THING THAT IS INTERESTING

03:01:27.003 --> 03:01:30.657
IS BERNIE SANDERS WHOLE THEORY 
WAS EXPANDING THE ELECTORATE. 

03:01:30.863 --> 03:01:33.711
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WERE 
DOING IS THERE ARE LATINOS AND 

03:01:33.909 --> 03:01:37.967
MORE THAN PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF IOWA
WOULD THINK. THERE ARE MEET 

03:01:38.181 --> 03:01:41.025
HACKING TOWNS AND SOME OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE AREAS. THE CITY 

03:01:41.228 --> 03:01:44.063
WHERE STEVE KING HIS FROM AND 
STORM LAKE HAS A 

03:01:46.290 --> 03:01:50.043
SPANISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER. A 
LOT OF THEM ARE CITIZENS. THE 

03:01:50.243 --> 03:01:52.609
BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN HAS MADE
A HUGE EFFORT PARTLY BECAUSE 

03:01:52.824 --> 03:01:54.824
THEY FELT 

03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:59.315
LIKE THEY DIDN'T MAKE AN EFFORT 
IN 2016 TO TRY AND MOBILIZE SOME

03:01:59.515 --> 03:02:03.963
OF THESE LATINAS WHO'VE NEVER 
PARTICIPATED OR VOTED OR 

03:02:04.165 --> 03:02:07.828
CAUCUSED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
WILL BE INTERESTING IS WHETHER 

03:02:08.032 --> 03:02:10.984
SANDERS WAS ABLE TO GET SOME OF 
THEM TO CAUCUSES IN THE 

03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:13.717
WORKING-CLASS AREAS AROUND DES 
MOINES. JENNA JOHNSON WROTE A 

03:02:14.326 --> 03:02:18.804
STORY ABOUT THE FIELD ORGANIZING
WITH THESE LATINO VOTERS WHO'VE 

03:02:19.009 --> 03:02:24.078
NEVER VOTED BEFORE. THAT IS 
HARDER BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CUSTOM

03:02:24.282 --> 03:02:28.756
AND A HABIT. IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THOSE 

03:02:28.955 --> 03:02:31.488
NUMBERS COME THROUGH. 
&gt;&gt; THE CAUCUS EXPERIENCE IS SO 

03:02:31.689 --> 03:02:34.842
DIFFERENT THAN A PRIVATE PRIMARY
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PRIMARY YOU 

03:02:35.042 --> 03:02:37.042
CAN SHOW UP ANYTIME IN MANY 
WOULD SEE 

03:02:40.928 --> 03:02:43.290
IT BEYOND TODAY BUT THE CAUCUS 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE COMMITTED TO 

03:02:43.486 --> 03:02:46.219
SHOW UP AT 7:00 AND OUR COLLIE 
DAVE WEIKEL IS JOINING US FROM 

03:02:47.843 --> 03:02:53.016
DES MOINES. YOU'VE BEEN ALL 
OVER. I THOUGHT YOU MOVED HERE. 

03:02:53.218 --> 03:02:55.962
I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU ARE 
WATCHING AS WE WAIT FOR THE 

03:02:56.161 --> 03:02:58.161
RETURNS. 
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T WAIT FOR SOMETHING TO

03:02:58.203 --> 03:03:00.203
WATCH. WE'VE GOT PRECINCTS 
COMING IN 

03:03:02.461 --> 03:03:04.799
SLOWLY AND WE HAVE AND ENTRANCE 
POLL AND I KEEP GETTING THAT 

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:09.580
WRONG GETTING ADJUSTED WAIVED BY
WAVE. I'VE LEARNED TO NOT PAY 

03:03:09.791 --> 03:03:12.415
ATTENTION TO ANY HORSERACE 
NUMBERS UNTIL MORE ARE IN IN 

03:03:15.067 --> 03:03:18.516
THIS POINT THE ENTRANCE POLL 
FOUR YEARS AGO THEY SO IT TRUMP 

03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:22.989
WOULD EKE IT OUT AND HILLARY HAD
A NARROW LEAD. BOTH WERE OFF IN 

03:03:23.194 --> 03:03:28.268
A FEW POINTS IN THIS RACE IT'S 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIRST AND

03:03:28.479 --> 03:03:33.537
FOURTH. ONCE WE GET THINGS 
ROLLING IN I'M LOOKING AT DES 

03:03:34.354 --> 03:03:36.896
MOINES AND THEY ARE A PRETTY 
BATTLE BETWEEN 

03:03:40.453 --> 03:03:43.107
WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG AND SOME 
STRENGTH FOR KLOBUCHAR  AND NOT 

03:03:43.307 --> 03:03:48.281
A LOT OF STRENGTH FOR SANDERS. 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN 

03:03:48.484 --> 03:03:51.427
PULLING OUT THESE LESS LIKELY 
VOTERS, NONWHITE VOTERS THAT YOU

03:03:51.633 --> 03:03:55.887
ARE TALKING ABOUT. I'M LOOKING 
AT ONCE WE QUIT BUENA VISTA 

03:03:56.095 --> 03:03:59.433
COUNTY AND ONCE WE GET BLACK 
HAWK COUNTY WHERE THE CAMPAIGN 

03:03:59.644 --> 03:04:05.034
WAS VERY FOCUSED. I WANT TO SEE 
THAT. I WANT TO SEE EASTERN IOWA

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:13.568
WHICH IS KIND OF ABSENT. NOT 
LIKE SCOTT OR DUBUQUE BUT WHAT 

03:04:13.773 --> 03:04:16.605
YOU COULD SEE ON THE GROUND IN 
THE LAST MONTH WITH WARREN 

03:04:16.802 --> 03:04:18.802
GETTING LOYAL CROWDS BUT 

03:04:21.487 --> 03:04:23.247
SMALLER. THE BUTTIGIEG 
MAINTAINED CROWDS EVEN THOUGH HE

03:04:23.248 --> 03:04:26.553
WAS LEFT OUT OF THE 
CONVERSATION.  BIDEN NEVER 

03:04:26.767 --> 03:04:29.603
PICKING UP IN PLACES WHERE HE 
SHOULD BE STRONG LIKE TO BE, 

03:04:29.809 --> 03:04:34.071
FRANKLY. HE SHOULD'VE HAD THAT 
PLACE WIRED A LONG TIME AGO. THE

03:04:34.284 --> 03:04:36.721
ONLY THING THAT IS CLEAR FOR THE
LAST HOUR IF ANYTHING IS CLEAR 

03:04:37.324 --> 03:04:42.316
IS THAT BIDEN  IS NOT A STRONG 
CANDIDATE ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE

03:04:42.521 --> 03:04:46.270
REALIGNED. THAT MAKE SENSE. IF 
YOU REALLY LOVE JOE BIDEN YOU 

03:04:46.471 --> 03:04:50.131
HAD FOUR YEARS TO MAKE UP YOUR 
MIND ABOUT HIM. WE SAW STARTING 

03:04:50.335 --> 03:04:54.394
IN MARCH LAST YEAR, ONE THING 
VOTERS IN IOWA WERE CONSISTENT 

03:04:54.997 --> 03:05:01.094
AND I'M QUOTING THE SELTZER FULL
WAS THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE

03:05:01.303 --> 03:05:03.733
WITH OLD CANDIDATES WHO THEY 
FELT WERE PASSED THEIR PRIME IT 

03:05:03.933 --> 03:05:10.644
WAS CLOSE TO 40% OF IOWANS FELT 
SANDERS AND BIDEN WERE PASSED 

03:05:10.849 --> 03:05:15.113
THEIR PRIME SO THERE WAS 
CANDIDATE WHO IS NOT GOING TO BE

03:05:15.316 --> 03:05:18.560
EITHER AND I THINK BUTTIGIEG DID
A LITTLE BIT BETTER . ONE WAY TO

03:05:18.767 --> 03:05:23.645
LOOK AT THIS FRIENDLY IS TO LOOK
AT THE POLL A YEAR AGO. THE ONLY

03:05:23.935 --> 03:05:26.084
CANDIDATES WHO COULD'VE DONE 
WORSE BECAUSE OF THAT ARE BIDEN 

03:05:29.124 --> 03:05:31.124
AND SANDERS. BIDEN MUCH WORSE 
AND SANDERS HOLDING HIS NUMBERS 

03:05:31.178 --> 03:05:33.593
IN THE QUESTION IS  WHETHER 
BUTTIGIEG IMPROVED ENOUGH TO 

03:05:33.803 --> 03:05:38.261
PASS THEM . 
&gt;&gt; DAVE, WHAT VOTER QUESTIONS 

03:05:38.461 --> 03:05:40.461
WERE BEING ASKED 

03:05:42.528 --> 03:05:44.704
AT EVENTS. WE'VE SEEN SO MANY 
PEOPLE THAT WERE UNDECIDED INTO 

03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:47.835
THE FINAL DAYS. WHAT WERE THEY 
STILL ASKING?

03:05:47.836 --> 03:05:52.293
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE ASKING ABOUT 
ELECTABILITY AND IT'S TOUGH IF 

03:05:53.698 --> 03:05:56.057
YOU'RE REPORTER. ONCE YOU GET 
NEWS IN THE NEWS IS BETTER AND 

03:05:56.256 --> 03:06:00.810
THE INFORMATION IS NEW BUT YOU 
STILL HEAR PEOPLE ASK THEMSELVES

03:06:01.019 --> 03:06:05.192
WHO MIGHT WIN AND WHO MIGHT BE 
TRUMP. WHO CAN I 

03:06:08.532 --> 03:06:11.399
VOTE FOR WHERE I WILL NOT REGRET
IT IN 10 MONTHS AND THERE WAS A 

03:06:11.596 --> 03:06:13.596
LOT OF INDECISION. I FOUND AT 
SANDERS AND 

03:06:16.854 --> 03:06:18.587
WARREN RALLIES IT'S DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE SANDERS VOTERS ARE 

03:06:18.588 --> 03:06:23.160
HUNDRED % CONVINCED. PEOPLE AT 
WARREN RALLIES LOVED HER. YOU 

03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:25.360
WERE 

03:06:26.405 --> 03:06:30.056
FINDING PEOPLE COMING TO SEE 
KLOBUCHAR AND BUTTIGIEG DECIDING

03:06:30.471 --> 03:06:32.471
WHICH HAD A BETTER 

03:06:35.138 --> 03:06:37.138
ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT. WE ARE 
WAITING FOR EXIT POLLS TO ADJUST

03:06:37.171 --> 03:06:39.171
BUT I'M STILL FASCINATED BY THAT
QUESTION. BECAUSE SANDERS HAS 

03:06:39.318 --> 03:06:43.671
BEEN RUNNING A BERNIE BEATS 
TRUMP MESSAGING CAMPAIGN. IT'S A

03:06:43.874 --> 03:06:49.354
PUBLIC BUMPER STICKER AND I'M 
NOT SURE HE MADE INROADS ON THE 

03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:54.035
QUESTION. FOR A CAMPAIGN THAT 
WAS REALLY GIDDY AND THEY WERE 

03:06:54.243 --> 03:06:58.581
TRACKING SHOWED HIM WINNING 
PRETTY EASILY. THEY WERE TALKING

03:06:58.781 --> 03:07:00.637
CONFIDENTLY ABOUT WINNING THE 
FIRST THREE STATES AND BLOWING 

03:07:00.638 --> 03:07:02.638
OUT SUPER TUESDAY. I'M NOT SURE 

03:07:05.605 --> 03:07:07.891
WHAT MOVE AFTER THIS BUT THEY 
MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE ABILITY 

03:07:08.201 --> 03:07:10.279
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT BERNIE 
SANDERS WOULD BE THE OLDEST 

03:07:10.486 --> 03:07:14.367
PRESIDENT AS WOULD BIDEN . AS 
ALMOST WOULD ELIZABETH WARREN 

03:07:14.568 --> 03:07:21.660
BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY'VE GOT THE
WAY THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD.

03:07:21.661 --> 03:07:23.661
&gt;&gt; 

03:07:26.124 --> 03:07:28.660
SO DAVE, WE ARE WATCHING TO SEE 
HOW THE CANDIDATES COME ON STAGE

03:07:28.861 --> 03:07:31.286
AND HOW THEY TALK TO THE VOTERS,
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AT LARGE.

03:07:31.491 --> 03:07:35.875
PLEASE TALK US THROUGH WHAT WE 
SHOULD LISTEN FOR. THERE'S A 

03:07:36.077 --> 03:07:40.028
QUESTION OF WHO DECLARES VICTORY
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN IOWA. 

03:07:40.235 --> 03:07:42.857
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WEARY 
OF IF YOU HEAR A CANDIDATE SAY, 

03:07:43.055 --> 03:07:47.247
WE GOT THIS MUCH SUPPORT. IS IT 
REALLY GOING TO BE THE DELICATE 

03:07:47.472 --> 03:07:49.288
COUNTS? WHAT WILL YOU BE 
WATCHING VERSUS WHAT THE 

03:07:49.289 --> 03:07:53.945
CANDIDATES ARE WATCHING?
&gt;&gt; WELL, A RESULT IN WHICH FOUR 

03:07:54.158 --> 03:07:58.424
PEOPLE GET DELEGATES AND 
DEPENDING ON HOW AMY KLOBUCHAR 

03:07:59.026 --> 03:08:05.233
DOES  IN THE FIRST DISTRICT THE 
ONE THAT TOUCHES MINNESOTA WITH 

03:08:05.435 --> 03:08:10.409
THE BIGGEST POPULATION. THE 
POSSIBILITY OF FIVE CANDIDATES 

03:08:10.624 --> 03:08:13.046
GETTING A DELEGATE OUT OF THE 
STATE WHICH NEVER HAPPENED 

03:08:13.248 --> 03:08:16.912
BEFORE. IF THEY WANT TO SPEND 
THE VICTORY OUT OF THIS, I 

03:08:17.116 --> 03:08:22.393
CANNOT BLAME THEM. I'M ONE OF 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO I COVER HE 

03:08:22.605 --> 03:08:27.267
EVERY PART OF THIS PROCESS. I 
UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION WHEN 

03:08:27.468 --> 03:08:31.330
PEOPLE SAY THE STATE IN WHICH 1%
OF THE VOTE SHOULD DECIDE 

03:08:31.534 --> 03:08:34.990
EVERYTHING. I THINK WITH 
KLOBUCHAR HAVING THE HOMETOWN 

03:08:35.285 --> 03:08:38.659
ADVANTAGE AND COMING TO IOWA 
ALMOST MORE THAN ANYBODY , IF 

03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:44.348
SHE WANTS TO SPIN THAT SHE HAD A
STRONGER SHOWING THAN EXPECTED. 

03:08:44.559 --> 03:08:46.869
I THINK SHE CAN. WHAT I HAD NOT 
HEARD 

03:08:50.017 --> 03:08:52.449
YET FROM THE THREE SENATORS WHO 
WERE TIED UP THE LAST COUPLE OF 

03:08:52.657 --> 03:08:55.097
WEEKS IS IF SOMEONE LIKE 
BUTTIGIEG CAN WIN  THEN I'VE NOT

03:08:55.901 --> 03:08:59.567
YET HEARD DENNIS THAT I WOULD 
EXPECT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD 

03:08:59.773 --> 03:09:02.816
HAVE BROKEN OUT AND THEY DIDN'T.
THE ONE THING AGAINST THAT IS 

03:09:06.069 --> 03:09:08.576
BIDEN  GOT ALL THE TIME HE 
WANTED TO CAMPAIGN IN IOWA  

03:09:08.775 --> 03:09:13.579
WEIGHT NO I MEANT THE OPPOSITE. 
TO LOOK AT THE LATE DECIDERS IT 

03:09:13.785 --> 03:09:15.814
DOES SEEM TO BE A SLIGHT 
ADVANTAGE FOR BIDEN AND 

03:09:16.015 --> 03:09:20.896
BUTTIGIEG.  IT'S NOT ANYTHING 
AMAZING IN THE LAST WEEK TO GRAB

03:09:21.298 --> 03:09:25.967
THAT EXCEPT THAT ONE 
CONSISTENTLY VOTERS HAVE THOUGHT

03:09:26.176 --> 03:09:30.231
THEY WERE MORE ELECTABLE IN TWO 
THEY HAD THE TIME TO SPEND HERE.

03:09:30.439 --> 03:09:35.514
I DON'T KNOW. IF FIVE PEOPLE 
DECLARE A VICTORY I THINK THE 

03:09:35.721 --> 03:09:40.395
ONLY PERSON THAT WOULD BE HARD 
TO SPIN FOUR IS BIDEN. HE WOULD 

03:09:40.601 --> 03:09:45.479
COME OUT OF THE STATE WITH THE 
ENDORSEMENT OF TWO IOWA'S LIVING

03:09:45.681 --> 03:09:49.018
GOVERNORS, JOHN KERRY'S 
ENDORSEMENT  AND MEMBERS OF 

03:09:49.224 --> 03:09:52.814
CONGRESS MAKING THE PITCH. I 
THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPIN 

03:09:53.015 --> 03:09:58.271
THE STATE IS NOT A 
REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLE OF THE 

03:09:58.489 --> 03:10:03.347
CANDIDATE. THE PROBLEM IS BIDEN 
WOULD POINT OUT  IS THE TOUGH 

03:10:03.545 --> 03:10:05.789
PARTS OF IOWA ARE THE PARTS 
WHERE  DEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN 

03:10:05.989 --> 03:10:12.083
LOOK EXACTLY LIKE WHAT IT WILL 
BE NEEDED TO WIN THE MIDWEST. 

03:10:12.284 --> 03:10:15.740
LOSING A CONTEST IS NOT AS GOOD 
AS WINNING. BUTTIGIEG  WOULD 

03:10:15.965 --> 03:10:21.747
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY I 
APPROVE I CAN 

03:10:26.637 --> 03:10:30.562
DO THIS. TAKE THAT FOR WHAT YOU 
WANT.

03:10:30.563 --> 03:10:36.460
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DAVE WEIGLE. WE 
WILL CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER. 

03:10:36.660 --> 03:10:40.737
I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO 
PROFESSOR PETER HANSEN. WHO IS 

03:10:40.939 --> 03:10:44.482
THIS A MAKE IT OR BREAK IT 
MOMENT FOR. WHO DO YOU WATCH TO 

03:10:44.681 --> 03:10:48.659
COME OUT WITH THE NARRATIVE OF 
SUCCESS. I KNOW THAT SUCCESS CAN

03:10:48.864 --> 03:10:52.506
MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS FOR 
DIFFERENT CANDIDATES. 

03:10:52.507 --> 03:10:55.275
&gt;&gt;  BIDEN FOR STARTERS IF HE 
DOESN'T DO WELL IN IOWA THEN WE 

03:10:55.482 --> 03:10:59.198
ARE HEADED TO NEW HAMPSHIRE  
WHERE BERNIE SANDERS WILL DO 

03:10:59.411 --> 03:11:02.463
WELL. THERE WILL BE TWO STATES 
IN A ROW WHERE BIDEN  DOES NOT 

03:11:02.666 --> 03:11:05.176
DO WELL IF HE DOESN'T DO WELL 
HERE TONIGHT. IT MAY NOT BE 

03:11:05.377 --> 03:11:07.377
UNTIL 

03:11:09.565 --> 03:11:11.607
SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE HE HAS 
SUCCESS. IF HE GOES FOR THAT 

03:11:11.806 --> 03:11:16.365
LONG WITHOUT A CLEAR SIGN OF 
VICTORY. I THINK THAT WILL BE 

03:11:16.574 --> 03:11:18.812
HARD FOR HIS CAMPAIGN AND MAKE 
IT HARD FOR HIM TO GET 

03:11:19.013 --> 03:11:22.765
VOLUNTEERS AND RAISE MONEY. THIS
IS A MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT FOR 

03:11:22.972 --> 03:11:27.541
AMY KLOBUCHAR. IF THERE'S ONE 
STATE WHERE SHE SHOULD DO WELL 

03:11:27.751 --> 03:11:29.768
IT'S IOWA. SHE'S A NEIGHBOR AND 
WELL-RESPECTED. SHE SPENT A LOT 

03:11:30.282 --> 03:11:33.537
OF TIME. SHE'S BEEN PICKING UP 
MOMENTUM. IF IMPEACHMENT HURT 

03:11:33.744 --> 03:11:35.744
ANYONE IT 

03:11:37.388 --> 03:11:40.257
HURT KLOBUCHAR. JUST AS SHE WAS 
STARTING TO GAIN SOME STEAM SHE 

03:11:40.453 --> 03:11:42.885
HAD TO START SPENDING TIME IN 
WASHINGTON. THERE WASN'T MUCH OF

03:11:43.488 --> 03:11:48.355
AN OBVIOUS EFFECT ON THE NUMBERS
BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE STALLED 

03:11:49.786 --> 03:11:52.432
KLOBUCHAR'S MOMENTUM. THOSE 
CANDIDATES I THINK IT'S CLEARLY 

03:11:52.631 --> 03:11:56.698
A MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT. I'M 
GUESSING BOTH WARREN AND SANDERS

03:11:56.897 --> 03:12:00.453
WILL COME OUT WITH SOME 
DELEGATES AND CLAIM SUCCESS TO 

03:12:00.658 --> 03:12:04.015
LIVE ON ANOTHER DAY. FOR THE 
OTHERS I THINK THEY NEED TO 

03:12:04.215 --> 03:12:07.257
DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY CAN 
SUCCEED IN AN ELECTION. 

03:12:07.258 --> 03:12:10.217
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE TAKE HERE IN 
CANAL SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS 

03:12:10.413 --> 03:12:14.557
IDEA OF THE CANDIDATES BEING 
GONE IN WASHINGTON. PEOPLE 

03:12:14.771 --> 03:12:17.819
UNDERSTOOD AND KNEW WHY THEY 
COULD NOT BE HERE. IT DOESN'T 

03:12:18.037 --> 03:12:23.017
SEEM THERE IS DISAPPOINTMENT BUT
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE AN ABSENCE

03:12:23.220 --> 03:12:26.140
OF RETAIL POLITICS, LIKE TIME 
AND ENERGY GETTING TO KNOW THE 

03:12:26.350 --> 03:12:30.411
CANDIDATES. WHAT IT AMY 
KLOBUCHAR LOSE OUT ON? 

03:12:30.412 --> 03:12:34.058
&gt;&gt;  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND OR 
UNDERESTIMATE 

03:12:39.059 --> 03:12:42.316
THE POLITICS. I JOKE WITH MY 
FAMILY THAT IF THE CANDIDATE 

03:12:42.527 --> 03:12:44.802
HASN'T COME TO THE LIBRARY THE 
ON TRYING HARD. IOWANS CAN MEET 

03:12:45.004 --> 03:12:47.278
AND TALK TO ALL OF THESE 
CANDIDATES DIRECTLY. THE VOTERS 

03:12:51.123 --> 03:12:53.123
EXPECT THAT. THAT KIND OF 
ONE-ON-ONE INTERACTION TO SEE A 

03:12:53.283 --> 03:12:55.233
CANDIDATE IN YOUR HOMETOWN IS 
SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL TO 

03:12:55.234 --> 03:12:59.257
BUILDING THE MOMENTUM TO 
PERSUADING THOSE UNDECIDED 

03:12:59.465 --> 03:13:01.952
VOTERS IN A WAY THEY DON'T GET 
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS 

03:13:02.171 --> 03:13:03.937
CONSEQUENTIAL. 
&gt;&gt; JAMES, WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING 

03:13:03.938 --> 03:13:09.212
FOR TONIGHT IN TERMS OF WHO 
NEEDS TO HAVE SUCCESS? BUT

03:13:09.213 --> 03:13:14.701
&gt;&gt; DAVE IS PESSIMISTIC ON BIDEN 
. BUT IT IS INTERESTING ABOUT 

03:13:14.914 --> 03:13:16.914
WHAT HE 

03:13:18.754 --> 03:13:21.824
SAID IN THE LATE DECIDERS WENT 
TO BIDEN  AND BUTTIGIEG.  THEY 

03:13:22.029 --> 03:13:25.756
WERE CAMPED OUT AND THEY WERE 
PRESENT AND THEY WERE ON 

03:13:25.962 --> 03:13:29.117
TELEVISION ON THE LOCAL NEWS 
EVERY NIGHT.  IF BIDEN  REALLY 

03:13:29.721 --> 03:13:31.721
DOES 

03:13:33.378 --> 03:13:35.378
UNDERPERFORM HERE AND IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO KNOW WE HAVE NOT 

03:13:35.519 --> 03:13:38.856
HEARD FROM EASTERN IOWA.  THOSE 
ARE WHO WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR 

03:13:39.057 --> 03:13:41.911
FROM. HE DID SPEND HIS TIME 
THERE AND HE IS A STRONG PERSON 

03:13:42.115 --> 03:13:44.654
THERE HE'S LEANED ON HIS 
CATHOLIC FAITH. HE DID A SPEECH 

03:13:44.850 --> 03:13:48.422
YESTERDAY TO CATHOLICS. IF BIDEN
DOES UNDERPERFORM IT'S 

03:13:49.426 --> 03:13:52.881
PROBLEMATIC . YOU LOOKED AT THE 
MONEY PART. BIDEN HAS 

03:13:55.924 --> 03:13:57.882
RESERVED  LESS TIME FOR 
COMMERCIALS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 

03:13:57.883 --> 03:14:00.192
THAN ANY OF THE OTHER TOP-TIER 
CANDIDATES. HIS SUPER-PAC IS 

03:14:00.392 --> 03:14:02.637
CONSIDERED NOT PLAYING IN NEW 
HAMPSHIRE AND FRIGHTENING ENOUGH

03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:08.108
TO SANDERS AND WARREN. THEN YOU 
END UP IN NEVADA WHERE IT'S NOT 

03:14:08.315 --> 03:14:10.564
OBVIOUS. ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE 
MONEY DOES DRY UP EVEN FOR 

03:14:10.767 --> 03:14:13.402
SOMEONE LIKE BIDEN . IF YOUR 
WHOLE PITCH IS THAT YOU CAN WIN 

03:14:14.207 --> 03:14:18.486
IN ANYWHERE AND YOU CAN BEAT 
TRUMP IN RED STATES. IF YOU 

03:14:21.108 --> 03:14:23.564
CAN'T WIN IN IOWA IT'S A CAUCUS 
NOT A PRIMARY OR GENERAL  

03:14:25.777 --> 03:14:29.458
ELECTION. IF YOU CANNOT WIN IN 
THESE COUNTIES IT WILL UNDERCUT 

03:14:29.665 --> 03:14:32.134
-- IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE WHEN 
YOU GO TO THESE BIDEN  EVENTS 

03:14:32.333 --> 03:14:40.006
HOW MUCH OF THE RATIONALE IS HE 
CAN WIN. THAT IS IT. THAT IS THE

03:14:40.207 --> 03:14:44.494
MAIN THING THAT BIDEN HIMSELF  
SAYS IN HIS SPEECHES. THE DANGER

03:14:44.873 --> 03:14:47.822
FOR HIM IS THAT HE COULD LOSE 
THAT TONIGHT. 

03:14:47.823 --> 03:14:50.983
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO OUR COLLEAGUE 
SEAN SULLIVAN 

03:14:54.026 --> 03:14:56.026
WHO IS COVERING THE SANDERS 
CAMPAIGN. KEYS AT THE WATCH 

03:14:56.062 --> 03:15:00.747
PARTY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US 
BY PHONE. HOW ARE PEOPLE FEELING

03:15:00.951 --> 03:15:06.006
IN THE ROOM? 
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW IT'S PRETTY UPBEAT 

03:15:06.208 --> 03:15:10.481
ATMOSPHERE PEOPLE ARE TRICKLING 
IN. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GLUED TO

03:15:11.487 --> 03:15:15.757
THEIR PHONES. THERE ARE TWO BIG 
SCREENS AT THE FRONT OF 

03:15:20.425 --> 03:15:22.425
THE ROOM. PEOPLE ARE WATCHING 
THE RESULTS. I THINK THEY'RE 

03:15:22.555 --> 03:15:25.304
WONDERING WHAT THE DELAY IS. 
THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE 

03:15:26.923 --> 03:15:31.096
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. PEOPLE 
WONDER WHY THESE RESULTS HAVEN'T

03:15:31.296 --> 03:15:36.277
BEEN REPORTED YET. A LOT OF 
REFRESHING ON THE SMART PHONES 

03:15:36.479 --> 03:15:40.526
AND PEOPLE HAVE LAPTOPS. SO FAR,
THE MOOD IS FAIRLY UP THE.

03:15:40.527 --> 03:15:42.527
&gt;&gt; 

03:15:45.006 --> 03:15:47.006
OKAY, WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK 
LIKE FOR BERNIE SANDERS? WHAT 

03:15:47.138 --> 03:15:50.704
DOES HE NEED TO DO? 
&gt;&gt; THE EXPECTATIONS HAVE BEEN 

03:15:50.907 --> 03:15:53.771
VERY HIGH OVER THE LAST COUPLE 
OF WEEKS. HE PLACED VERY HIGHLY 

03:15:53.975 --> 03:15:58.708
IN SOME RECENT POLLS. THERE IS 
AN EXPECTATION AMONG A LOT OF 

03:15:59.225 --> 03:16:02.365
DEMOCRATS THAT IF HE CAN GET A 
WIN HERE AND IF HE DOES NOT IT 

03:16:02.565 --> 03:16:04.565
COULD BE A DISAPPOINTMENT. IF 

03:16:07.960 --> 03:16:10.805
HE DOES, THE NEXT STATE UP IS 
NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE HE WILL 

03:16:11.009 --> 03:16:13.009
PERFORM 

03:16:14.662 --> 03:16:19.020
VERY WELL. IN 2016 HE PERFORMED 
WELL. WE'VE SEEN IN PAST YEARS 

03:16:19.223 --> 03:16:21.223
HOW ONE 

03:16:23.183 --> 03:16:25.028
STATE RESULTS CAN DIRECTLY 
IMPACT HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT 

03:16:25.029 --> 03:16:29.180
THE ELECTION IN THE NEXT STATE. 
THERE IS A LOT HERE FOR SANDERS,

03:16:29.897 --> 03:16:33.361
PRELIMINARY RESULTS COULD BE 
GOOD BUT THEY ARE PRELIMINARY 

03:16:33.561 --> 03:16:37.839
AND WE WON'T KNOW MUCH UNTIL WE 
GET A BIGGER CHUNK 

03:16:42.485 --> 03:16:44.436
OF NUMBERS. 
&gt;&gt; SO, I'M SO CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT

03:16:44.437 --> 03:16:47.173
THE CLOSING ARGUMENT WAS FOR 
BERNIE SANDERS AND HOW THINGS 

03:16:47.378 --> 03:16:49.607
HAVE GONE AS HE'S BEEN LOCKED IN
WASHINGTON STUCK IN THIS 

03:16:52.636 --> 03:16:54.773
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. WE'VE HEARD 
THE SENATOR SAY THIS IS MY DUTY 

03:16:57.314 --> 03:16:59.360
BUT SANDERS SEEMED TO TO BE MOST
WILLING TO EXPRESS FRUSTRATION 

03:16:59.565 --> 03:17:01.565
AT BEING STUCK 

03:17:04.952 --> 03:17:06.952
IN WASHINGTON. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS REALLY 

03:17:07.093 --> 03:17:09.093
OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THAT. HE WAS 
PRETTY BLUNT ABOUT HIS BELIEF 

03:17:09.179 --> 03:17:11.179
THAT IT MIGHT BE 

03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:16.340
A DISADVANTAGE AND HE FREQUENTLY
SAID, I'D RATHER BE AN IOWA OR I

03:17:16.543 --> 03:17:20.076
WOULD RATHER BE IN NEW 
HAMPSHIRE.  HE HAS HAD A PRETTY 

03:17:20.296 --> 03:17:22.296
SUBSTANTIAL ARMY OF SURROGATES 
WHO BEEN OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR 

03:17:23.925 --> 03:17:27.671
HIM. CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, MICHAEL MOORE, 

03:17:29.813 --> 03:17:31.813
ILHAN OMAR AND OTHERS WHO HAVE 

03:17:34.482 --> 03:17:36.335
BEEN CAMPAIGNING. THEY BEEN 
GOING TO CANVAS LAUNCHES AND 

03:17:36.336 --> 03:17:38.336
SPEAKING AT RALLIES. IT'S 

03:17:40.380 --> 03:17:42.825
BEEN CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT 
IDEAL. PART OF 

03:17:47.816 --> 03:17:52.673
HIS CLOSING IF YOU WANT TO BEAT 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THE WAY 

03:17:52.877 --> 03:17:54.877
TO 

03:17:57.768 --> 03:17:59.768
DO THAT

03:18:04.758 --> 03:18:07.198
HE'S TRYING TO CALL FOR SWEEPING
CHANGE 

03:18:11.257 --> 03:18:13.257
TO ELECTABILITY. THAT 

03:18:16.669 --> 03:18:18.669
MORE EXPLICITLY

03:18:25.467 --> 03:18:27.467
THE BIGGEST PRIORITY IS FIGURING
OUT WHICH CANDIDATE GIVES THEM 

03:18:28.716 --> 03:18:30.716
THE BEST. HE'S TRYING TO 

03:18:34.542 --> 03:18:36.542
PROVE THAT.

03:18:42.329 --> 03:18:44.763
TELL ME ABOUT HIS LIFE RIGHT 
NOW. 

03:18:44.764 --> 03:18:49.443
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A LOT OF DOWNTIME OR
A LOT OF SLEEP OR A LOT OF TIME 

03:18:50.258 --> 03:18:54.723
TO RELAX. USUALLY, WHEN YOU 
DON'T HAVE AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

03:18:54.924 --> 03:18:59.603
THE CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE IS HECTIC 
AS IT IS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

03:19:01.023 --> 03:19:05.692
SOMETIMES 12, 15, 18 HOUR DAYS 
BUT THEN YOU ADD IMPEACHMENT 

03:19:05.898 --> 03:19:08.953
TRIAL IN THE FACT THAT HE'S HAD 
TO TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH. ALL 

03:19:09.150 --> 03:19:11.997
THE SENATORS HAVE HAD TO DO 
THAT. I CAUGHT UP WITH AMY 

03:19:14.024 --> 03:19:18.090
KLOBUCHAR EARLIER. SHE SAID SHE 
WAS RUNNING 3.5 HOURS OF SLEEP 

03:19:18.289 --> 03:19:23.978
TRYING TO BALANCE REMOTELY WITH 
BEING IN THE SENATE FOR THE 

03:19:25.793 --> 03:19:29.869
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. IT WEARS THE 
CANDIDATES DOWN. IT CAN TAKE A 

03:19:30.072 --> 03:19:33.529
TOLL ON THEM. IT'S WORTH KEEPING
IN MIND THEY 

03:19:38.535 --> 03:19:40.535
BEEN ACTIVE. THEY ARE 

03:19:43.676 --> 03:19:46.748
WORKING OVERTIME. THAT IS THE 
KIND OF THING THAT IS A BIG 

03:19:47.127 --> 03:19:50.789
COMING UP OR IF YOU HAVE A 
TOWNHALL WHEN YOU GET TOUGH 

03:19:50.999 --> 03:19:54.447
QUESTIONS. WE'VE SEEN CANDIDATES
SLIP UP IN THE PAST, ESPECIALLY 

03:19:54.649 --> 03:19:57.109
WHEN THEY ARE TIRED. IT'S 
SOMETHING TO KEEP 

03:20:02.077 --> 03:20:03.644
IN MIND.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT SEAN SULLIVAN, 

03:20:03.645 --> 03:20:06.064
THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH US 
AND WE WILL BE WATCHING TO SEE 

03:20:06.284 --> 03:20:08.284
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD A 
BERNIE SANDERS TONIGHT. WE 

03:20:08.328 --> 03:20:12.827
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. JAMES, 
WHAT ABOUT THIS ELECTABILITY AND

03:20:13.036 --> 03:20:15.036
KNOWLEDGE SANDERS 

03:20:18.143 --> 03:20:21.705
IS TAILORING HIS ELECTABILITY. 
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT AND WHO 

03:20:21.906 --> 03:20:24.709
DOES HE HAVE TO CONVINCE. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S CRITICAL. BERNIE SANDERS

03:20:24.912 --> 03:20:27.558
HAD A HEART ATTACK A COUPLE 
MONTHS AGO. THAT FITS INTO THE 

03:20:32.426 --> 03:20:34.426
ELECTABILITY QUESTION. THE 
CONVENTION IT WAS IN DC WHEN HE 

03:20:34.553 --> 03:20:36.603
HAD HIS HEART ATTACK WHILE 
CAMPAIGNING IN NEVADA AND IT WAS

03:20:36.808 --> 03:20:40.342
THE BEGINNING OF THE END WHERE 
HE HAD LOYAL FOLLOWERS. THIS 

03:20:40.556 --> 03:20:45.627
WILL SO DOUBTS THAT A 
77-YEAR-OLD CAN BE PRESIDENT AND

03:20:45.829 --> 03:20:48.060
WIN THE NOMINATION BE THE 
STANDARD PARTY BEARER BUT 

03:20:48.277 --> 03:20:52.349
INSTEAD IT HELPED HIM. HIS LOW 
POINT WAS WHEN HE HAD A HEART 

03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:56.609
ATTACK. HE'S COME BACK FROM 
THAT. 

03:20:56.610 --> 03:21:00.661
&gt;&gt; BY HELPING HIM WAS BECAUSE IT
FORCED HIM TO RESET? WAS IT TO 

03:21:03.909 --> 03:21:05.909
COLLECT 

03:21:07.562 --> 03:21:08.623
HIMSELF?
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, HE WAS MORE 

03:21:08.624 --> 03:21:11.831
SYMPATHETIC AND I THINK FROM 
WHEN HE CAME BACK AFTER THE 

03:21:12.034 --> 03:21:14.775
COUPLE WEEKS OFTEN FOR MATT HE 
MADE THE ELECTABILITY PITCH 

03:21:14.978 --> 03:21:20.214
WHICH IS THE SIGNS PEOPLE SAY 
BERNIE BEATS TRUMP. HE NOW TALKS

03:21:20.424 --> 03:21:25.150
ABOUT AS I SAID, HE WILL EXPAND 
THE ELECTORATE AND BRING NEW 

03:21:29.094 --> 03:21:31.140
PEOPLE IN. HE CAN BUILD A 

03:21:34.379 --> 03:21:36.411
WORKING CLASS COALITION AND HAS 
MADE INROADS WITH COMMUNITIES OF

03:21:36.622 --> 03:21:38.622
COLORS. 

03:21:40.062 --> 03:21:42.508
BY EMPHASIZING. LIBERALS CARE 
HISTORICALLY 

03:21:47.522 --> 03:21:53.684
GEORGE McGOVERN GOT BLOWN OUT 
AND A LOT OF IT WAS ACTIVISTS 

03:21:53.883 --> 03:21:57.541
THAT HATED THE VIETNAM WAR AND 
PEOPLE TODAY DON'T THINK OF 

03:21:57.747 --> 03:21:59.747
GEORGE McGOVERN BUT THEY DO 
THINK OF 

03:22:03.969 --> 03:22:05.969
DONALD TRUMP

03:22:16.624 --> 03:22:20.293
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE WHO DO I THINK CAN 
BEAT DONALD TRUMP. 

03:22:20.294 --> 03:22:22.541
&gt;&gt; ERNIE HAS THEIR HEARTS AND 
HE'S TRYING TO GET THEIR HEADS. 

03:22:24.557 --> 03:22:27.913
I THINK BECAUSE HE HAD THE 2016 
BASIS HE CAN TAKE THE HEARTS FOR

03:22:28.113 --> 03:22:32.277
GRANTED IN SOMEWAY AND FOCUS ON 
THE HEADS. I THINK THAT IS WHAT 

03:22:32.481 --> 03:22:38.777
GOT HIM TO THIS POINT WHERE HE 
IS AT THE TOP OF THE RACE. IT'S 

03:22:39.074 --> 03:22:43.058
CLOSE BUT HE GOT THERE BECAUSE 
HE WAS ABLE TO PIVOT POST HEART 

03:22:43.259 --> 03:22:45.175
ATTACK TO MAKE THE ELECTABILITY 
PITCH. 

03:22:45.176 --> 03:22:49.236
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO WASHINGTON 
WHERE DAVID BYLER IS STANDING 

03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:52.588
BY. WHAT'S HAPPENING? 
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR 

03:22:52.789 --> 03:22:55.225
VOTES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE BUT
WHILE WE ARE WAITING WE'VE SEEN 

03:22:55.431 --> 03:22:57.431
THAT WE HAVE VOTES COMING IN FOR

03:23:00.911 --> 03:23:02.911
THE REPUBLICAN. IT'S EASY TO 
FORGET WITH ALL OF THE 

03:23:03.047 --> 03:23:04.859
EXCITEMENT ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

03:23:04.860 --> 03:23:07.085
DOES HAVE TO COMPETE IN A 
PRIMARY THIS YEAR. AND YOU CAN 

03:23:07.284 --> 03:23:11.076
SEE HERE, HE'S DOING REALLY 
WELL. ALL OF THESE RED AND DARK 

03:23:11.373 --> 03:23:13.508
RED COUNTIES ARE PLACES HE'S WON
AND WHERE WE HAVE THE 

03:23:16.559 --> 03:23:19.999
DATA IN. THESE LIKE RED COUNTIES
ARE ALSO PLACES WHERE HE'S 

03:23:20.212 --> 03:23:22.955
WINNING BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF
OUR DATA. YOU CAN SEE OVER HERE 

03:23:23.161 --> 03:23:27.936
THAT TRUMP HAS 97% OF THE VOTE, 
TOTAL. THAT'S HUGE. THAT'S 

03:23:28.148 --> 03:23:31.884
PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE 
POLARIZATION THAT WE'VE SEEN IN 

03:23:33.213 --> 03:23:35.446
OUR AGE. WE'VE SEEN THE PARTIES 
LINEUP A CULTURE AND JUST GET 

03:23:36.048 --> 03:23:38.048
MORE 

03:23:39.917 --> 03:23:41.334
HARDENED AND DEMOCRATS ALWAYS 
SUPPORTING DEMOCRATS AND 

03:23:41.335 --> 03:23:44.791
REPUBLICANS ALWAYS SUPPORTING 
REPUBLICANS. REPUBLICANS REALLY 

03:23:44.989 --> 03:23:47.024
GET BEHIND THE PRESIDENT BUT 
PART OF IT IS BECAUSE HIS 

03:23:47.219 --> 03:23:50.685
COMPETITORS AREN'T NECESSARILY 
THE PEOPLE THAT TRUMP'S 

03:23:50.904 --> 03:23:53.539
SKEPTICAL REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE
WANTED. YOU HAVE BILL WELD THE 

03:23:53.747 --> 03:23:57.170
GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE
90s AND IS SORT OF AN OLD-SCHOOL

03:23:57.788 --> 03:24:00.635
LIBERAL REPUBLICAN. AT ONE POINT
IF MEMORY SERVES HE DECLARED TO 

03:24:00.835 --> 03:24:05.303
BE THE MOST PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATE
BUT THAT DOESN'T FLY WELL WITH A

03:24:05.504 --> 03:24:09.573
PARTY WHERE EVANGELICALS AND 
PRO-LIFE VOTERS ARE STRONG. HE 

03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:13.318
IS NOT TAKING MUCH OF THE VOTE 
AND NEITHER IS JOE WALSH. JOE 

03:24:13.521 --> 03:24:17.092
WALSH IS A TALK RADIO HOST WHO 
HAD A CONVERSION AWAY FROM TRUMP

03:24:17.290 --> 03:24:19.519
AND AWAY FROM TRUMPISM AND IS 
TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AGAINST 

03:24:19.724 --> 03:24:24.117
TRUMP BUT HE HAS JUST A FEW 
VOTES FEWER THAN WEALTH. WHAT WE

03:24:24.329 --> 03:24:27.459
SEE HERE IS TRUMP DOING WELL IN 
A STATE THAT WAS A STRUGGLE LAST

03:24:27.660 --> 03:24:30.494
TIME. LAST TIME AROUND, TED CRUZ
WON 

03:24:35.487 --> 03:24:37.616
IN IOWA AND HAS A STRONG 
EVANGELICAL BASE BUT TRUMP 

03:24:37.823 --> 03:24:39.857
DELIVERED FOR A LOT OF PIECES 
OVER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ON 

03:24:40.065 --> 03:24:42.523
POLICY AND REPUBLICANS LIKE HIM.
THEY THINK HE HAS A GOOD SHOT AT

03:24:43.289 --> 03:24:48.168
WINNING. POLLS ARE TRAILING BUT 
NOT OVERWHELMINGLY. HE COULD 

03:24:48.367 --> 03:24:50.367
MAKE 

03:24:53.359 --> 03:24:56.806
IT UP. THIS HERE IS ALSO PART OF
THE REASON THAT DEMOCRATS ARE 

03:24:57.006 --> 03:24:59.036
THINKING THROUGH THEIR CHOICES 
IN THE WAY THAT THEY ARE. THEY 

03:24:59.242 --> 03:25:01.265
DON'T JUST WANT SOMEONE WHO IS A
PERFECT STANDARD. THEY WANT 

03:25:01.470 --> 03:25:04.818
SOMEONE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO BEAT
TRUMP BECAUSE IN OUR POLARIZED 

03:25:05.016 --> 03:25:08.279
ERA THAT'S THE FIRST GOAL FOR 
BOTH PARTIES IT'S TOO WIN THE 

03:25:08.480 --> 03:25:12.138
ELECTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
BACK TO YOU LIBBY. 

03:25:12.139 --> 03:25:17.007
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU GREAT POINTS. LET'S
BRING IT BACK TO PROFESSOR 

03:25:17.298 --> 03:25:20.261
HANSEN. IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT
THIS REPUBLICAN CAUCUS BUT WE 

03:25:20.472 --> 03:25:22.472
CLEARLY SEE HOW THAT 

03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:29.059
IS GOING. HOW MUCH DID YOU HEAR 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S NAME 

03:25:29.256 --> 03:25:31.256
BEING USED AS CANDIDATES MADE 
THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENTS IN LAST 

03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:34.277
COUPLE OF WEEKS?
&gt;&gt; NOT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD 

03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:36.522
THINK. YOU HEAR SOME CANDIDATES 
LIKE BUTTIGIEG SAY ONE DAY WE 

03:25:36.719 --> 03:25:39.253
WILL WAKE UP AND DONALD TRUMP 
WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT . BUT MOST

03:25:39.460 --> 03:25:41.666
OF WHAT THESE CANDIDATES FOCUS 
ON IS THEIR OWN IDEAS. YOU HEAR 

03:25:41.864 --> 03:25:46.860
THEM TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND YOU HEAR THEM TALKING

03:25:47.075 --> 03:25:50.110
ABOUT COLLEGE TUITION AND YOU 
HEAR THEM TALKING ABOUT 

03:25:50.325 --> 03:25:52.563
HEALTHCARE. I THINK ONE OF THE 
REASONS FOR THAT IS IF YOU 

03:25:56.611 --> 03:25:58.769
LOOK AT IOWA IN 2010, VOTERS 
REALLY WANTED TO HEAR THOSE 

03:25:58.968 --> 03:26:00.689
THINGS. THE DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATES WHO PICKED UP  

03:26:00.690 --> 03:26:04.337
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS IN 2018 DID 
NOT TALK TRUMP A WHOLE LOT. THEY

03:26:04.543 --> 03:26:07.793
TALKED ABOUT VOCATIONAL 
EDUCATION AND THEY TALKED ABOUT 

03:26:08.092 --> 03:26:10.226
HEALTHCARE. THOSE CANDIDATES DID
REALLY WELL. I THINK THE DOG 

03:26:10.427 --> 03:26:14.708
CREDIT ELECTRIC CARE ABOUT 
BEATING TRUMP THEY ARE LOOKING 

03:26:14.913 --> 03:26:17.161
FOR CANDIDATES WHO CAN DO THAT 
BUT THEY ARE HUNGRY TO HEAR 

03:26:17.364 --> 03:26:21.592
ABOUT ISSUES AND THEY WANT TO 
YOUR POLICIES. 

03:26:21.593 --> 03:26:23.449
&gt;&gt; HOW POWERFUL ARE THOSE 2018 
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE WINNERS?

03:26:23.450 --> 03:26:27.292
AS THEY'VE BEEN ON THE TRAIL A 
LITTLE BIT BOTH IN TERMS OF SORT

03:26:27.495 --> 03:26:32.778
OF SHARING THEIR INSIGHTS AND 
WISDOM OF WHAT HELP THEM WIN AND

03:26:32.983 --> 03:26:34.615
ALSO IN TERMS OF WHO THEY ARE 
SUPPORTING. 

03:26:34.616 --> 03:26:37.445
&gt;&gt; THOSE ENDORSEMENTS AREN'T 
IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK THEY ARE

03:26:37.655 --> 03:26:39.655
DECISIVE. VOTERS ARE MAKING UP 
THEIR OWN MINDS. 

03:26:42.313 --> 03:26:44.360
I THINK AS OPPOSED TO JUST 
LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THEIR 

03:26:44.559 --> 03:26:48.319
ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE TO SAY. 
BUT I THINK THE EXAMPLE SET BY 

03:26:48.526 --> 03:26:52.507
THOSE VICTORIES IS IMPORTANT. IT
DOES SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT THE 

03:26:52.717 --> 03:26:55.111
KIND OF POLITICS THAT ARE 
RESONATING IN IOWA. IN 2018, 

03:26:55.311 --> 03:26:58.776
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES MADE 
APPEALS TO ANTI-IMMIGRATION 

03:26:59.075 --> 03:27:02.027
SENTIMENT THEY RAN 
ADVERTISEMENTS ABOUT THE WALL ON

03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:07.711
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. THAT JUST 
FELL FLAT. THE ISSUES THAT WERE 

03:27:07.919 --> 03:27:10.464
IN THOSE RACES WERE 
BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUES.

03:27:10.465 --> 03:27:17.466
&gt;&gt; THERE IS THE QUESTION OF WHAT
HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST NOT 

03:27:17.675 --> 03:27:21.606
REALLY TWO YEARS SINCE THEN. YOU
GET THE SENSE THERE IS MORE 

03:27:21.809 --> 03:27:26.811
MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF HOW ARE 
THOSE CANDIDATES, THOSE PEOPLE 

03:27:27.613 --> 03:27:32.293
IN OFFICE DOING AND POLLING NOW 
THAT THEY'VE BEEN AROUND 

03:27:37.307 --> 03:27:39.307
EXCEPT NOW. THEY HAVE 

03:27:42.987 --> 03:27:46.712
REMAINED POPULAR. I'M NOT 
EXPECTING ANY TROUBLE WITH THOSE

03:27:46.911 --> 03:27:51.992
RACES IN 2020. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. PROFESSOR PETER 

03:27:52.197 --> 03:27:56.261
HANSEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH EUGENE
SCOTT AND OUR GUEST AND JAMES 

03:27:56.463 --> 03:27:58.463
HOMAN. STAY WITH US

03:28:37.903 --> 03:28:39.903
&gt;&gt;&gt; CAUCUS NIGHT COMES AROUND 
AND GEORGE H.W. 

03:28:42.891 --> 03:28:44.895
BUSH BEATS REAGAN BY SIX 
PERCENTAGE POINTS AND THERE IS A

03:28:45.093 --> 03:28:49.982
MEDIA FRENZY ABOUT THIS. IT 
TURNS OUT THAT THERE WERE A TON 

03:28:50.169 --> 03:28:52.169
OF COMPUTER PROBLEMS AND A 
NUMBER OF THE PRECINCTS IN IOWA 

03:28:52.288 --> 03:28:55.091
ACTUALLY HAD NOT REGISTERED ANY 
OF THEIR VOTES AND A LOT OF 

03:28:55.274 --> 03:28:59.750
THOSE WERE PRECINCTS THAT WERE 
FAVORED FOR REAGAN AND WE SAW A 

03:28:59.970 --> 03:29:03.550
SIMILAR PROBLEM IN 2012 WHEN ON 
CAUCUS NIGHT ROMNEY WAS DECLARED

03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:11.940
THE WINNER AND DAYS LATER THE 
GOP HAD TO COME OUT AND SAY 

03:29:12.129 --> 03:29:13.841
ACTUALLY THERE HAD BEEN SOME 
COUNTING MISTAKES AND RICK 

03:29:13.842 --> 03:29:15.842
SANTORUM WAS THE ACTUAL VICTOR 

03:29:19.353 --> 03:29:22.517
IN IOWA. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WANT ME

03:29:22.726 --> 03:29:26.382
TO BE THE NOMINEE. 
&gt;&gt; WE NEED A MASS POLITICAL 

03:29:26.593 --> 03:29:28.825
MOVEMENT, NOT JUST TO GO TO 
WASHINGTON BUT TO CHANGE IT 

03:29:29.013 --> 03:29:33.422
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT IS BROKEN IN THIS

03:29:33.611 --> 03:29:35.611
COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW TO 

03:29:37.550 --> 03:29:39.082
FIX IT. 
&gt;&gt; THE STAKES COULD NOT BE 

03:29:39.083 --> 03:29:41.978
HIGHER. 
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO WIN. 

03:29:41.979 --> 03:29:45.112
&gt;&gt; I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE OF 
WINNING IN RED AND PURPLE AND 

03:29:45.305 --> 03:29:47.305
RIGHT 

03:29:50.293 --> 03:29:52.293

OF THE CENTER FOR THE AMERICAN 
POLITICS AT DENVER UNIVERSITY 

03:30:34.227 --> 03:30:36.640
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
YOU READY CAUCUS TONIGHT FOR 

03:30:36.833 --> 03:30:38.940
YOUR FIRST TIME AND WHAT WAS THE
EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR YOU? 

03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:45.910
WHAT SURPRISED

03:30:49.911 --> 03:30:52.227
YOU AND WHAT STOOD OUT? 
&gt;&gt; IT MOVED VERY FAST. YOU HAD A

03:30:52.430 --> 03:30:54.631
LOT OF INTENSE DEMOCRACY GOING 
ON WITHIN 15 MINUTES AND IT WAS 

03:30:54.823 --> 03:30:57.276
GREAT TO SEE. ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT INTERESTED ME AS YOU HAVE A

03:30:57.468 --> 03:31:00.389
COMBINATION OF PEOPLE'S REALLY 
SINCERE PREFERENCES ON THE FIRST

03:31:00.581 --> 03:31:03.325
VOTE, BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN 
THERE IS A LOT OF STRATEGY THAT 

03:31:03.510 --> 03:31:05.909
GOES ON AND PEOPLE THINK WHAT 
MAKES OUR SIDE LOOK BETTER AND 

03:31:06.101 --> 03:31:08.238
CAN WE MOVE PEOPLE TO ANOTHER 
SIDE. I WAS SURPRISED THAT FOR 

03:31:08.428 --> 03:31:12.314
EXAMPLE IN OUR PRECINCT AMY 
KLOBUCHAR WAS VIABLE IN THE 

03:31:12.770 --> 03:31:14.770
FIRST ROUND AND 

03:31:16.716 --> 03:31:18.716
ELIZABETH WARNS TEAM FELL SHORT 
OF THAT. THEY WERE ASKING FOR 

03:31:18.899 --> 03:31:20.985
OTHER PEOPLE TO JOIN THEM AND NO
ONE WOULD DO THAT AND 

03:31:25.514 --> 03:31:29.237
HE WAS SHE WAS DECLARED UNVIABLE
AND THEY SCATTERED TO SOME OF 

03:31:29.428 --> 03:31:31.716
THE OTHER TEAMS AND THERE WAS A 
LOT OF INTENSE THINGS GOING ON 

03:31:31.920 --> 03:31:33.678
AND PEOPLE WINNING SOME 
SUPPORTERS TO THEIR SIDE. 

03:31:33.679 --> 03:31:36.764
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE WATCHING EARLIER 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT THAT 

03:31:36.952 --> 03:31:39.562
SAME SCENARIO AND NOT A TREND IN
YOUR AT THE SAME CAUCUS EVENT SO

03:31:39.748 --> 03:31:41.748
THIS 

03:31:43.875 --> 03:31:46.727
IS HOW ALL OF IOWA IS GOING TO 
MAKE AND READ INTO IT YOU ARE AT

03:31:46.913 --> 03:31:49.294
THE SAME PLACE. AS WE HEARD FROM
THE PROFESSOR, I LOVE THIS IDEA 

03:31:49.478 --> 03:31:51.478
OF INTENSE DEMOCRACY AND THE 
GUTS AND ALL BEING SPELLED OUT 

03:31:51.596 --> 03:31:55.812
IN THE PUBLIC EYE. TALK TO US 
ABOUT WHAT IS SO FASCINATING 

03:31:56.018 --> 03:31:58.018
ABOUT THE CAUCUS AND PEOPLE 
TUNING IN AND UNIQUE FOR 

03:32:01.576 --> 03:32:03.289
THAT TONIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS 

03:32:03.290 --> 03:32:05.169
FASCINATING ABOUT TONIGHT IS 
ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 

03:32:05.170 --> 03:32:07.170
MAKES IT CONTROVERSIAL, THE FACT
THAT 

03:32:10.888 --> 03:32:14.639
IT IS A CAUCUS AND NOT A PRIMARY
THAT PEOPLE DO SOME TYPE OF 

03:32:14.828 --> 03:32:16.828
POLITICKING AND NEGOTIATING TO 
FIGURE OUT WHO IT IS THAT WILL 

03:32:16.908 --> 03:32:21.320
DO THE BEST AT THESE GATHERINGS 
AND A WAY THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN 

03:32:21.508 --> 03:32:23.508
AT A PRIMARY. 

03:32:25.119 --> 03:32:27.119
YOU KNOW, THOSE RESPONSES, THE 
RESULTS CAN BE ALL OVER THE 

03:32:27.226 --> 03:32:29.226
PLACE AND SOME PEOPLE LEAD 
IMMEDIATELY AND 

03:32:33.058 --> 03:32:35.582
SOME PEOPLE PICK SOMEBODY ON 
PAPER WHO SEEMS DIFFERENT THAN 

03:32:35.775 --> 03:32:37.673
THEIR FIRST CHOICE AND SOME 
PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO 

03:32:37.674 --> 03:32:40.171
FIGURE IT OUT AND THAT IS WHAT 
WE SAW ON THE EXAMPLE AT DRAKE 

03:32:40.353 --> 03:32:44.155
UNIVERSITY EARLIER IN THE NIGHT.
SO TALKING ABOUT HOW SOME OF 

03:32:44.342 --> 03:32:47.523
THEM CAN MOVE SO QUICKLY AND 
OTHERS CAN STILL BE INVOLVED IN 

03:32:47.704 --> 03:32:49.704
THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS, IT 

03:32:53.313 --> 03:32:55.121
IS FASCINATING FOR THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER STATES IN 

03:32:55.122 --> 03:32:59.056
AMERICA WHO ALREADY KNOW WHO 
THEY WANT AND ARE NOT BATTLING 

03:32:59.241 --> 03:33:01.241
BETWEEN A FEW PEOPLE. 
&gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

03:33:03.619 --> 03:33:05.827
GOING INTO A BOOTH AND CHOOSING 
A CANDIDATE, IT IS SUCH A 

03:33:06.379 --> 03:33:08.379
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. DO YOU GET
A SENSE THAT IT 

03:33:12.750 --> 03:33:15.180
BRINGS OUT DIFFERENT THOUGHTS 
AND VOTERS OUR FEELINGS? YOU ARE

03:33:15.365 --> 03:33:17.428
BEING PUT ON THE LINE PUBLICLY 
TO SUPPORT A CANDIDATE AND ALSO 

03:33:19.602 --> 03:33:21.602
BEING MOVED SOMETIMES BY YOUR 
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND ALSO A

03:33:21.687 --> 03:33:23.687
PERFORMATIVE ELEMENT. 
&gt;&gt; QUITE 

03:33:27.028 --> 03:33:29.788
A BIT. THERE IS A LOT GOING ON. 
IT IS INTENSE. I GUESS WHETHER 

03:33:29.978 --> 03:33:32.464
YOU THINK THAT IS GOOD OR BAD 
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK IS THE

03:33:32.649 --> 03:33:34.649
PURPOSE OF THIS IN SELECTING 

03:33:37.860 --> 03:33:40.202
A NOMINEE AND 50 OR 100 YEARS 
AGO SELECTING PRESIDENTIAL 

03:33:40.397 --> 03:33:42.397
NOMINEES WAS MOSTLY DONE IN 
CONVENTIONS AND THERE YOU HAVE A

03:33:45.059 --> 03:33:47.129
LOT OF HORSE TRADING AND A LOT 
OF HAGGLING OVER CANDIDATES AND 

03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:49.320
ARGUING WITH PEOPLE OVER WHO IS 
BEST 

03:33:53.155 --> 03:33:56.148
FOR WHAT REASONS AND WHO 
REPRESENTS WHAT PARTY THE BEST 

03:33:56.338 --> 03:33:58.526
AND THE MOVED TO PRIMARIES MADE 
IT A VERY PERSONAL AND PRIVATE 

03:33:58.713 --> 03:34:00.713
DECISION FOR VOTERS SO THERE 
CAN'T BE AS MUCH 

03:34:04.668 --> 03:34:09.220
OF THAT CONVERSATION OF WHO 
WOULD BE BEST BUT SIMPLY WHO IS 

03:34:09.412 --> 03:34:11.128
YOUR BEST PREFERENCE ON THE 
CAUCUS MAYBE SOMEWHERE IN 

03:34:11.129 --> 03:34:13.208
BETWEEN WHERE YOU DO HAVE THE 
PRIVATE SIDE OF THINGS BUT YOU 

03:34:13.397 --> 03:34:15.297
ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE 
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON AS WELL. 

03:34:15.298 --> 03:34:17.389
&gt;&gt; OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS TOWN AT
DRAKE UNIVERSITY SO LET'S GO TO 

03:34:17.579 --> 03:34:19.579
HANNAH LIVE. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE ACROSS THE CAMPUS OF 

03:34:22.888 --> 03:34:26.474
DRAKE AND LOOKED IT OVER FROM 
THE CAUCUS TO THE JOE BIDEN 

03:34:26.659 --> 03:34:29.293
WATCH PARTY AND I AM HERE WITH 
MY COLLEAGUE WHO HAS BEEN IN THE

03:34:29.482 --> 03:34:32.145
ROOM FOR A FEW HOURS AND WHAT IS
THE MOOD IN THIS WHILE WE WAIT 

03:34:32.999 --> 03:34:34.999
FOR RESULTS. YOU HAVE BEEN 
TALKING TO PEOPLE AND WHAT IF 

03:34:35.071 --> 03:34:36.603
YOU HEARD. 
&gt;&gt; THERE IS ALL THIS TREPIDATION

03:34:36.604 --> 03:34:39.897
AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
JOE BIDEN SUPPORTERS FOR DECADES

03:34:40.082 --> 03:34:42.245
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE DEDICATED 
THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF THEIR 

03:34:42.430 --> 03:34:46.269
LIVES TO JOE BOYD, BIDEN AND 
THEY ARE HEALED, HERE AND 

03:34:51.242 --> 03:34:53.242
THEY ARE

03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:59.007
ASKING ME YOU ARE REPORTER AND 
WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT IS 

03:34:59.197 --> 03:35:01.750
TAKING SO LONG AND I WANT TO 
KNOW AND SOME FOLKS HAVE BEEN AT

03:35:01.939 --> 03:35:04.271
PRECINCTS WHERE BIDEN DID NOT DO
AS WELL AS THEY HOPED HE WOULD 

03:35:04.461 --> 03:35:06.520
DO AND THEY ARE WONDERING IF 
ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS ALSO 

03:35:06.708 --> 03:35:08.807
THE CASE AND THEY JUST WANT TO 
KNOW.'S EQUITY THINK THE BIDEN 

03:35:08.993 --> 03:35:10.506
CAMPAIGN DID WRITE IN IOWA OR 
NOT RIGHT? 

03:35:10.507 --> 03:35:15.190
&gt;&gt; I WANT OFFER ANY CRITIQUES 
FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN BUT I 

03:35:16.141 --> 03:35:20.920
WILL SAY HE SEIZED THE MOMENT 
AFTER THE INCIDENT IN IRAN AND 

03:35:21.108 --> 03:35:23.108
REALLY PLAYING 

03:35:26.133 --> 03:35:28.625
UP HIS FOREIGN POLICY 
CREDENTIALS. YEAR PERIOD WERE A 

03:35:28.812 --> 03:35:30.812
LOT OF VOTERS WERE CONCERNED 
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE 

03:35:30.913 --> 03:35:33.540
WORLD. AND BIDEN DIDN'T OFFER 
ANY PARTICULAR POLICY 

03:35:33.726 --> 03:35:35.726
PRESCRIPTIONS OR WHATEVER, 

03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:40.178
BUT HE DID PLAY UP THE FACT THAT
HE HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE OF 

03:35:40.369 --> 03:35:43.400
REALLY ANYBODY ON THE FIELD. 
&gt;&gt; WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT IOWA AND 

03:35:43.584 --> 03:35:45.584
WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR THE BIDEN
CAMPAIGN IF HE CAME 

03:35:49.832 --> 03:35:51.832
FORWARD TONIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON 

03:36:01.221 --> 03:36:03.331
WHO YOU ASK. ON ONE HAND THE 
CAMPAIGN HAS DOWNPLAYED IOWA AND

03:36:03.527 --> 03:36:05.443
THEY SAY HIS TREND IS AMONG 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND THEY

03:36:05.444 --> 03:36:07.444
SAY SOUTH CAROLINA'S A FIREWALL 
AND SOMETIMES HE USES THAT WORD 

03:36:07.540 --> 03:36:10.078
AND ON THE OTHER HAND HE IS A 
VICE PRESIDENT AND LEADING IN A 

03:36:10.266 --> 03:36:12.467
LOT OF STATES THE VERY BEGINNING
SO IF HE GETS SHELLACKED OR 

03:36:12.667 --> 03:36:14.667
EATEN BADLY, IT IS OBVIOUSLY 
GOING TO LOOK BAD IN THE 

03:36:15.009 --> 03:36:17.280
QUESTION IS CAN HE HOLD ON OR 
DOES THAT SEND A RIPPLE EFFECT 

03:36:20.587 --> 03:36:22.784
OR IMPACT ON FUTURE STATES OR ON
SOUTH CAROLINA OR SUPER TUESDAY 

03:36:22.976 --> 03:36:24.960
STATES WHERE HE HAS THAT AND 
DOES THAT DESCENT DECLINE 

03:36:24.961 --> 03:36:26.961
BECAUSE OF HOW HE DOES HERE. 

03:36:30.388 --> 03:36:32.388
&gt;&gt; YOU SPOKE TO BIDEN SUPPORTERS
WERE CAUCUSES WERE PERHAPS WAS 

03:36:32.565 --> 03:36:35.029
IN BIBLE AND YOU GET A SENSE OF 
WHERE THEY WENT IN THE SECOND 

03:36:35.224 --> 03:36:36.745
ROUND? 
&gt;&gt; ALL OVER THE PLACE. THERE WAS

03:36:36.746 --> 03:36:40.577
NO ONE SPECIFIC CANDIDATE AND 
THERE WAS TALK EARLIER THAT HE 

03:36:40.768 --> 03:36:42.768
HAD CONTACTED THE 

03:36:46.057 --> 03:36:49.191
YANG CAMPAIGN LIKE IF MY VOTE 
AND I AM NOT VIABLE WE WILL GO 

03:36:49.378 --> 03:36:51.872
TO YOU BUT I DID NOT GET A SENSE
THERE WAS ANYTHING ORGANIZED AT 

03:36:52.068 --> 03:36:54.141
THE PRECINCTS OF THE HANDFUL OF 
PRECINCTS THAT I SPOKE WITH AND 

03:36:58.435 --> 03:37:01.172
THEY SAID BIDEN DID NOT GET IT 
AND WE ARE GOING HERE. 

03:37:01.173 --> 03:37:03.173
&gt;&gt; SOWS THAT PERHAPS FOR THE 
LACK OF ORGANIZATION AMONG THE 

03:37:03.281 --> 03:37:05.423
PRECINCTS IN THE CAPTAINS HAVE A
STRATEGY OR IS IT UNCLEAR? BACK 

03:37:05.610 --> 03:37:07.610
BIDEN HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT HE 
HAS NOT 

03:37:12.521 --> 03:37:16.043
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF CALL FOR
PEOPLE TO GO TO DIFFERENT 

03:37:16.226 --> 03:37:21.019
CAMPAIGNS OR TO SWAP DELEGATES 
OR WHATEVER. SO IT IS UNCLEAR 

03:37:21.217 --> 03:37:23.987
AND IF HE SAYS THAT AND IT IS 
MUDDLED AT THE TOP IT IS UNCLEAR

03:37:24.175 --> 03:37:26.278
IF IT TRICKLES DOWN TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL -- IF THAT LEVEL OF 

03:37:26.467 --> 03:37:29.160
ORGANIZATION IS THERE. WE DON'T 
HAVE THE FULL DETAILS ON THE 

03:37:29.382 --> 03:37:31.382
AMOUNT OF ORGANIZATION THERE. 
&gt;&gt; WHO IS THE 

03:37:35.355 --> 03:37:37.345
MOST PASSIONATE BIDEN SUPPORTER 
YOU SPOKE TO IN THE ROOM 

03:37:37.346 --> 03:37:39.268
TONIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO A GUY THAT WAS SO 

03:37:39.269 --> 03:37:43.118
PASSIONATE ABOUT JOE BIDEN THAT 
HE PRINTED OUT SPEAKING TIPS. 

03:37:45.666 --> 03:37:49.897
LIKE HE GOT THE GETTYSBURG 
ADDRESS AND HOW TO MAKE YOUR 

03:37:50.086 --> 03:37:52.086
POINT BETTER AND ALL OF 

03:37:54.609 --> 03:37:56.056
THE STUFF. IT IS LIKE THIS 
THICK. 

03:37:56.057 --> 03:37:58.169
&gt;&gt; SPEAKING TIPS FOR BIDEN? 
&gt;&gt; YES. BECAUSE HE HAS A HISTORY

03:37:58.356 --> 03:38:00.876
OF AS A GAP PRONE 

03:38:11.038 --> 03:38:13.166
POLITICIAN WHO STRUGGLES IN THAT
AVENUE AND THE SKY WAS LIKE I 

03:38:13.355 --> 03:38:16.025
REALLY SUPPORT HIM AND I WANT TO
HELP. AND HE POINTED OUT ALL OF 

03:38:16.216 --> 03:38:18.216
THESE INDIVIDUAL THINGS JUST 
LIKE YOU WOULD PRINT OUT TO LIKE

03:38:18.309 --> 03:38:20.416
A HIGH SCHOOL DEBATE STUDENT AND
SENT THEM OUT TO THE CAMPAIGN. 

03:38:20.606 --> 03:38:23.345
IN FACT, HE EMAILED IT TO ME AND
HE SAID HERE IS WHAT I SENT 

03:38:23.541 --> 03:38:25.713
BIDEN. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THIS ROOM ARE EXTREMELY 100% 

03:38:25.900 --> 03:38:29.320
RIDE OR DIE FOR JOE BIDEN AND 
THEIR MOTIONS WILL GO UP AND 

03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:31.722
DOWN BASED ON WHAT GOES UP ON 
THAT SCREEN OVER THERE. 

03:38:31.723 --> 03:38:34.222
&gt;&gt; I AM EXPECTING ANY MOMENT WE 
WILL HEAR A ROAR OF RESULTS AND 

03:38:34.407 --> 03:38:38.808
THEY MAY COME UP BEHIND US. SO I
FEEL LIKE THERE ARE OTHER 

03:38:39.002 --> 03:38:40.365
STORIES OF PEOPLE YOU'RE 
SPEAKING WITH TONIGHT. 

03:38:40.366 --> 03:38:42.366
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS ALSO SURPRISING 

03:38:45.841 --> 03:38:47.841
IS THAT

03:38:56.819 --> 03:38:58.941
IOWA TRACKS A LOT OF POLITICAL 
STORIES AND NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO 

03:38:59.129 --> 03:39:01.231
HAVE COME FROM A CAUCUS AND 
SUPPORT JOE BIDEN. I MET A 

03:39:01.421 --> 03:39:03.965
FAMILY THAT IS FROM ATLANTA AND 
I SAID WHY ARE YOU HERE AND THEY

03:39:04.164 --> 03:39:06.495
SAID WE JUST WANTED TO BE HERE. 
SO THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT 

03:39:06.683 --> 03:39:08.877
WERE PRECINCT CAPTAINS AND CAME 
OVER TO HOPEFULLY BE PART OF A 

03:39:09.083 --> 03:39:11.083
VICTORY PARTY AND OTHERS THAT 
ARE JUST HERE BECAUSE THEY ENJOY

03:39:11.163 --> 03:39:13.455
THE THEATER OF IT ALL AND ARE 
EXCITED TO BE APPROACHED BY A 

03:39:13.643 --> 03:39:15.643
REPORTER AND WAX PHILOSOPHICALLY
BUT EVERYBODY IS ON PINS OR 

03:39:20.045 --> 03:39:23.048
HOOKS. 
&gt;&gt; HOW TOUGH IS BIDEN'S PATH 

03:39:23.236 --> 03:39:25.700
GOING FORWARD FROM HERE? THAT WE
ARE ALL ON A FLIGHT IT TO A 

03:39:25.888 --> 03:39:27.984
CLOCK A.M. TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND 
THE CHARTER FLIGHT IS BOOKED AND

03:39:28.171 --> 03:39:31.853
WE ARE ALL THERE. JOE BIDEN HAS 
DOWNPLAYED NEW HAMPSHIRE. NUMBER

03:39:32.043 --> 03:39:34.043
ONE BECAUSE BERNIE SANDERS 

03:39:37.418 --> 03:39:39.418
AND WORN

03:39:43.582 --> 03:39:45.483
ARE FROM NEIGHBORING STATES AND 
THEY HAVE A BUILT-IN ADVANTAGE 

03:39:45.484 --> 03:39:47.484
BUT 

03:39:55.624 --> 03:39:57.346
BECAUSE BIDEN SAYS HIS STRENGTH 
IS IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

03:39:57.347 --> 03:39:59.627
COMMUNITY IN THE SOUTH AND ALL 
THIS STUFF SO EVEN IF JOE BIDEN 

03:39:59.817 --> 03:40:01.817
DOESN'T DO PARTICULARLY WELL 
HERE, HE HAS SIGNALED HE WILL GO

03:40:01.908 --> 03:40:03.999
ON IT LISA SOUTH CAROLINA. THE 
HARD PART ABOUT THAT IS THESE 

03:40:04.185 --> 03:40:06.395
THINGS COST MONEY. SO IF HE DOES
NOT DO PARTICULARLY WELL HERE, 

03:40:06.583 --> 03:40:08.678
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS FUNDRAISERS?
TO THEY BEGAN TO HAVE DOUBTS OR 

03:40:08.875 --> 03:40:10.955
THINK MAYBE I SHOULD NOT INVEST 
IN THIS CANDIDATE AND GIVE MY 

03:40:11.261 --> 03:40:13.562
MONEY ELSEWHERE. I GUESS THE 
VOTERS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE ON 

03:40:13.758 --> 03:40:15.758
PINS AND HOOKS AND I AM TRYING 
TO SEE WHAT 

03:40:19.324 --> 03:40:21.321
HAPPENED SO WE KNOW ALL OF THIS 
STUFF GOING FORWARD. 

03:40:21.322 --> 03:40:22.458
&gt;&gt; OTHER FUNDRAISERS IN THE 
ROOM? 

03:40:22.459 --> 03:40:24.621
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT MET ANY. IF I DO I
WILL LET 

03:40:28.779 --> 03:40:30.567
YOU KNOW. 
&gt;&gt; LIKE THE CHECKBOOK IN THE PEN

03:40:30.568 --> 03:40:32.568
IF THEY ARE READY. 
&gt;&gt; I EXPECT THE MOST OF THE 

03:40:32.746 --> 03:40:34.658
PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE 
CAMPAIGN AND THE FUNDRAISING 

03:40:34.659 --> 03:40:36.733
WILL COME OUT AS TIME GOES ON 
AND LITERALLY PEOPLE WHO CAME 

03:40:36.923 --> 03:40:41.002
FROM CAUCUSES WHO WANTED TO GET 
A GOOD SEAT AND GET A GOOD SPOT 

03:40:41.187 --> 03:40:44.417
CLOSE TO THE CANDIDATE AND AS 
TIME GOES ON YOU WILL START TO 

03:40:44.610 --> 03:40:46.610
SEE THE DEMOCRATIC CELEBRITIES 
AND PEOPLE FROM THE 

03:40:50.803 --> 03:40:54.199
CAMPAIGN AND WHEN WE HAVE A 
SENSE OF WHEN BIDEN WILL COME 

03:40:54.388 --> 03:40:55.733
OUT. 
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION 

03:40:55.734 --> 03:41:00.630
AND WE WILL GO BACK TO FOR NOW. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF YOU 

03:41:00.829 --> 03:41:03.216
HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS LIKE WE HAVE HAD WE HAD 

03:41:03.404 --> 03:41:05.306
SOME NEWS ON THAT FRONT. THREE 
HOURS AFTER IOWANS BEGAN 

03:41:05.307 --> 03:41:07.307
CAUCUSING THERE 

03:41:09.682 --> 03:41:11.682
ARE NO OFFICIAL RESULTS FROM THE
IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE 

03:41:11.695 --> 03:41:13.881
ISSUED A STATEMENT AND I WILL 
READ IT TO YOU. WE HAVE 

03:41:14.066 --> 03:41:15.962
EXPERIENCED A DELAY IN THE 
RESULTS DUE TO QUALITY CHECKS 

03:41:15.963 --> 03:41:18.072
AND THE FACT THAT THE IDP IS 
REPORTING OUT THREE DATASETS FOR

03:41:18.269 --> 03:41:20.556
THE FIRST TIME. WHAT WE KNOW 
RIGHT NOW IS THAT AROUND 25% OF 

03:41:20.748 --> 03:41:24.357
PRECINCTS HAVE REPORTED AND 
EARLY DATA INDICATE TURNOUT IS 

03:41:24.544 --> 03:41:27.610
ON PACE FOR 2016 AND AGAIN IT 
WAS A STATEMENT FROM IOWA 

03:41:27.797 --> 03:41:32.062
DEMOCRATIC PARTY SPOKESMAN MANDY
McCLURE AND WE ARE WATCHING AND 

03:41:32.261 --> 03:41:34.261
WAITING FOR THESE RESULTS TO 
COME 

03:41:43.606 --> 03:41:45.776
IN. LET'S GO OVER THESE THREE 
DATA POINTS AND THREE DATASETS. 

03:41:45.959 --> 03:41:48.038
THE BIG QUESTION WAS WOULD WE 
FIND OUT FIRST ALIGNMENT OR 

03:41:48.228 --> 03:41:50.228
PEOPLE'S FIRST CHOICE AND THEN 
GO THROUGH AROUND AND FIND OUT 

03:41:50.341 --> 03:41:52.341
THEIR SECOND CHOICE AND THEN 
FIND OUT THE DELEGATE COUNT BUT 

03:41:52.462 --> 03:41:54.462
INSTEAD WE ARE GETTING THAT 
INFORMATION ALL AT ONCE FROM 

03:41:54.467 --> 03:41:56.391
EACH PRECINCT. 
&gt;&gt; 25% AND IS NOT THAT MUCH AND 

03:41:56.392 --> 03:41:58.919
WE ARE HERE REPORTS THAT THERE 
IS AN APP, A NEW APP AND YOU 

03:41:59.110 --> 03:42:01.961
HAVE TO REMEMBER IN RURAL IOWA A
LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE 

03:42:02.151 --> 03:42:06.223
GRANDPARENTS AND WELL-MEANING 
FOLKS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE 

03:42:06.413 --> 03:42:10.795
APPS AND THEIR JOB IS TO TYPE IN
ALL THIS DATA AND THEY HAVE ALSO

03:42:10.996 --> 03:42:12.996
PUT IN PLACE IN A 

03:42:14.819 --> 03:42:16.819
GOOD WAY A LOT OF DOUBLE 
VERIFICATION AND VARIOUS THINGS 

03:42:17.053 --> 03:42:19.053
TO PREVENT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE 
AND HACKING 

03:42:22.916 --> 03:42:24.916
AND PROTECT

03:42:27.546 --> 03:42:29.546
THE INTEGRITY OF THE RESULTS. SO
THAT APP HAS CREATED APPARENTLY 

03:42:29.622 --> 03:42:32.103
SOME PROBLEMS WERE IT IS HARD 
FOR PEOPLE TO USE IN THE DATA IS

03:42:32.293 --> 03:42:34.826
NOT NECESSARILY COMING IN RIGHT 
SO THAT IS PART OF WHY THERE IS 

03:42:35.018 --> 03:42:37.018
THIS QUALITY 

03:42:39.257 --> 03:42:41.997
CONTROL CHECK THAT ARE TAKING A 
LONG TIME AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE 

03:42:42.186 --> 03:42:44.288
THINGS IN THIS COMES AGAINST THE
BACKDROP OF WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

03:42:44.479 --> 03:42:46.452
IOWA'S PLACE IN THE PROCESS AND 
THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 

03:42:46.453 --> 03:42:48.453
ALL AGREE THAT THEY WANT TO 
PROTECT 

03:42:51.435 --> 03:42:53.435
THE SANCTITY OF THE IOWA 
CAUCUSES AND THEY ARE VERY 

03:42:53.451 --> 03:42:55.570
SENSITIVE TO TWO THINGS. ONE IS 
THE DELAY AND THEY KNOW THIS 

03:42:55.760 --> 03:42:58.114
DELAY IS BAD FOR THEM AND THE 
SECOND IS PUTTING OUT BAD DATA 

03:42:58.301 --> 03:43:02.047
AND THEY DON'T WANT PUT OUT BAD 
NUMBERS THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO 

03:43:02.239 --> 03:43:05.259
WALK BACK AND I TALKED ABOUT IN 
THE LAST HOUR THE MINUTE ROMNEY 

03:43:05.457 --> 03:43:07.439
RICK SANTORUM SITUATION IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN IN 

03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:10.850
2012 DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT ARE 
DOING IT TONIGHT AND HE DID LOSE

03:43:11.043 --> 03:43:12.848
THAT CHAIRMANSHIP OVER THAT 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE UPSET THAT 

03:43:12.849 --> 03:43:17.072
HE MISHANDLED IT FEKETE LOOK 
LIKE MITT ROMNEY WAS THERE BUT 

03:43:17.271 --> 03:43:19.271
IT 

03:43:22.049 --> 03:43:23.908
WAS COMPLEX. 
&gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T WAIT UNTIL ALL 

03:43:23.909 --> 03:43:26.190
THE NUMBERS WERE AND SO THEY HAD
A LOT OF SENSITIVITY TO THAT, 

03:43:26.383 --> 03:43:28.383
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT 

03:43:31.311 --> 03:43:33.977
THE DELAY IS THERE AND 25% TO 
SUGGEST THERE IS STILL A LOT OF 

03:43:34.164 --> 03:43:36.164
RETURNS THAT WE ARE WAITING 

03:43:38.010 --> 03:43:40.765
FOR. BUT THE APP DOES MEAN WE 
WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A PRETTY 

03:43:42.817 --> 03:43:44.817
SOPHISTICATED UNDERSTANDING AND 
THE DATA GUYS IN DC WILL BE ABLE

03:43:45.217 --> 03:43:47.618
TO TELL US A LOT RIGHT AWAY ONCE
WE GET THOSE DATASETS. 

03:43:47.619 --> 03:43:49.619
&gt;&gt; EUGENE, 

03:43:51.074 --> 03:43:54.443
WE HEARD EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE 
OF MOMENTUM COMING OUT OF IOWA 

03:43:54.641 --> 03:43:56.946
AND THERE REALLY IS NO MARGIN 
FOR ERROR IN TERMS OF THE DATA 

03:43:57.165 --> 03:44:01.215
CRUNCHING BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS 
SEEMING TO BE VICTORIOUS TONIGHT

03:44:01.411 --> 03:44:04.982
AND IT TURNS OUT THE RESULTS ARE
WRONG FROM THIS CALCULATION A 

03:44:05.182 --> 03:44:07.182
LACK OF QUALITY CONTROL AND IT 
COULD BE DEVASTATING TO A 

03:44:07.362 --> 03:44:09.362
CANDIDATE WHO IS 

03:44:12.243 --> 03:44:14.267
NOT TALLIED CORRECTLY OR SHOWN 
TO DO AS WELL. 

03:44:14.268 --> 03:44:16.469
&gt;&gt; SURE. BECAUSE HEADLINES ARE 
WRITTEN OFF OF THE RESULTS THAT 

03:44:16.680 --> 03:44:20.547
PEOPLE HAVE AND IF THOSE RESULTS
ARE WRONG YOU KNOW AND IT 

03:44:20.763 --> 03:44:24.750
DOESN'T BECOME CLEAR UNTIL DAYS 
LATER THOSE ORIGINAL HEADLINES 

03:44:25.072 --> 03:44:27.072
WILL HAVE CYCLED THROUGH THE 
NEWS AND GOTTEN 

03:44:29.748 --> 03:44:32.140
THE VOTERS AND MAYBE TO VOTERS 
WHO DON'T REGULARLY CHECK IN AND

03:44:32.349 --> 03:44:35.381
MAY NOT BE AROUND TO GET THE 
CORRECT DATA HEADLINE AND THAT 

03:44:35.601 --> 03:44:39.444
CAN AFFECT HOW PEOPLE ARE 
PERCEIVED IN NEVADA AND NEW 

03:44:39.656 --> 03:44:41.656
HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA SO 
IMPORTANT THAT THESE ARE 

03:44:42.636 --> 03:44:44.334
CORRECTED AND AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. SEQUITURS THE 

03:44:44.335 --> 03:44:49.075
IMPORTANCE OF IOWA AND THE 
BUILDING OF MOMENTUM? WE HEARD 

03:44:49.282 --> 03:44:51.282
HIM TALKING ABOUT THE BIDEN 
CAMPAIGN AND WHAT THEIR FEARS 

03:44:51.490 --> 03:44:56.256
AND HOPES ARE BUT HOW IMPORTANT 
IS IT TO DO WELL HERE? FEKETE IS

03:44:56.464 --> 03:45:00.409
IMPORTANT TO DO WELL OR AT LEAST
NOT POORLY. THERE IS SO MUCH OF 

03:45:05.179 --> 03:45:07.758
AN EXPECTATION GAME BUILT INTO 
IT AND CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT 

03:45:08.053 --> 03:45:10.608
EXPECTED TO DO VERY WELL IF THEY
CAN SUDDENLY HAVE A GOOD NIGHT 

03:45:10.818 --> 03:45:14.089
AND WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT IS 
HAPPENED SO FAR BUT THAT HAS 

03:45:14.304 --> 03:45:16.268
HELPED AND CERTAINLY HELPED 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE FIRST 

03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:19.756
RAN IN 2008. HE CERTAINLY WAS A 
TOP 

03:45:24.768 --> 03:45:30.256
CONTENDER BUT I THINK PEOPLE 
EXPECTED HIM TO DO AS WELL AS HE

03:45:30.472 --> 03:45:32.855
DID DURING THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND
THAT REALLY PROPELLED HIM AND A 

03:45:33.078 --> 03:45:36.221
LOT OF PEOPLE ENDORSED HIM WHO 
HAD BEEN WEARY OF DOING SO 

03:45:36.438 --> 03:45:38.673
BEFORE THAT AND IN MANY WAYS 
THAT VICTORY CEMENTED THE REST 

03:45:38.889 --> 03:45:40.889
OF HIS CAMPAIGN. 
&gt;&gt; JAMES, NOT JUST US BUT THE 

03:45:41.033 --> 03:45:43.033
CAMPAIGNS ARE WAITING FOR THIS 
INFORMATION TO 

03:45:46.943 --> 03:45:51.420
COME IN AND I WANT YOU TO BREAK 
DOWN FOR US AND REMIND US FOR 

03:45:51.630 --> 03:45:53.755
PEOPLE TUNING THEM WHAT WE ARE 
WATCHING IN TERMS OF RESULTS 

03:45:53.965 --> 03:45:56.089
BECAUSE THERE ARE THESE THREE 
DATA POINTS THAT WE HEARD THE 

03:45:56.300 --> 03:45:59.247
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS LAYING OUT 
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA TO GO 

03:45:59.464 --> 03:46:01.168
THROUGH AND WHAT ARE THE THREE 
DATA POINTS? 

03:46:01.169 --> 03:46:04.835
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST ONE IS THE TOTALS 
SO PEOPLE SHOULD UP THE CAUCUSES

03:46:05.051 --> 03:46:07.051
IN THE BEGINNING OF THAT INTENSE
DEMOCRACY THAT WE'VE BEEN 

03:46:07.176 --> 03:46:12.115
TALKING ABOUT AND THEY GO IN IN 
ONE QUARTER AND THAT WOULD COUNT

03:46:12.329 --> 03:46:15.489
PEOPLE WHO SAID GO TO CAUCUS FOR
ANDREW YANG OR COREY BOOKER OR 

03:46:15.694 --> 03:46:17.694
EVEN THOUGH HE IS NOT IN THE 

03:46:21.637 --> 03:46:24.054
RACE ANYMORE AND YOU CAN STILL 
CAUCUS FOR HIM AND THEIR NUMBERS

03:46:24.273 --> 03:46:27.081
ALL GET COUNTED AND IT SORT OF 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP

03:46:27.290 --> 03:46:29.701
AND THAT IS THE NUMBER THAT 
BERNIE SANDERS IS EXPECTED TO DO

03:46:29.912 --> 03:46:32.635
BEST WITH BECAUSE HE HAS HIS 
BASE THAT IS DISTINCT AND HE CAN

03:46:32.848 --> 03:46:35.381
GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AND THE 
SECOND NUMBER IS THE RAW 

03:46:35.599 --> 03:46:39.982
DELEGATE A LOT AND AND THAT IS 
BASED ON A FORMULA THAT DEPENDS 

03:46:40.192 --> 03:46:43.982
ON HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TURNED 
OUT TO THE SAME PRECINCT AND 

03:46:44.197 --> 03:46:47.075
PRIOR CAUCUSES AND ESSENTIALLY 
THAT IS WHAT IT'S WORKED OUT 

03:46:47.283 --> 03:46:50.324
AFTER EVERYONE IS DONE THAT SO 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT VIABLE 

03:46:53.081 --> 03:46:55.559
ENOUGH FOOD DON'T HAVE 50% OF 
THEIR SUPPORTERS HAVE TO GO FIND

03:46:57.042 --> 03:46:59.400
SOMEONE ELSE SO THEY CAN LEAVE 
OR WHATEVER BUT THAT IS WHAT 

03:46:59.601 --> 03:47:02.607
HAPPENS AFTER THIS SORT AND THE 
ONLY REALLY THAT ONE TIME AND 

03:47:03.063 --> 03:47:06.144
THEN THE THIRD NUMBER IS TOTAL 
DELEGATES. THAT IS 40 

03:47:11.157 --> 03:47:15.003
ODD DELEGATES AT THE DEMOCRATIC 
CONVENTION AND AS DAVE WEIGLE 

03:47:15.217 --> 03:47:18.348
SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO THIS 
COULD BE THE FIRST TIME EVER 

03:47:18.561 --> 03:47:20.561
THAT FIVE 

03:47:28.943 --> 03:47:30.871
DIFFERENT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES 
COME OUT WITH THE DELEGATE FROM 

03:47:30.872 --> 03:47:32.872
IOWA AND LET'S GO HERE AMY 
KLOBUCHAR NOW ADDRESSING THE 

03:47:33.034 --> 03:47:34.780
CROWD. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, ANDY BECAUSE I 

03:47:34.781 --> 03:47:37.354
HAVE THE SAME ANY STUCK WITH US 
ALL THE TIME AND NUMBER THREE 

03:47:37.566 --> 03:47:40.309
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER 
ARE HERE TONIGHT. AND I WANT TO 

03:47:41.898 --> 03:47:43.898
THINK THEM AND OUR TIRELESS 

03:47:46.028 --> 03:47:47.937
FUEL OR, FIELD ORGANIZERS AND 
THE UNSTOPPABLE VOLUNTEERS WHO 

03:47:47.938 --> 03:47:51.481
HAVE NEVER GIVEN UP AND WE ARE 
FEELING SO GOOD TONIGHT AND 

03:47:55.473 --> 03:47:58.118
I CAN'T WAIT SOMEHOW SOMEWAY I 
WILL GET ON A PLANE TONIGHT TO 

03:47:59.940 --> 03:48:03.421
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WE ARE 
BRINGING THIS TICKET TO NEW 

03:48:05.270 --> 03:48:07.936
HAMPSHIRE. SO EVEN IN A CROWDED 
FIELD OF CANDIDATES AND EVEN 

03:48:08.148 --> 03:48:12.200
DURING THE WELL EARNED 
IMPEACHMENT HEARING OF DONALD J 

03:48:12.492 --> 03:48:14.492
TRUMP WHICH 

03:48:16.791 --> 03:48:19.536
KEPT ME BOLTED TO MY SENATE DESK
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE KEPT 

03:48:20.919 --> 03:48:28.480
FIGHTING AND YOU KEPT FIGHTING 
FOR ME AND WE HAVE STARTED IN A 

03:48:28.732 --> 03:48:32.549
BLIZZARD AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
DIDN'T PREDICT I WOULD FINISH 

03:48:32.776 --> 03:48:36.721
THAT SPEECH AND THEY THOUGHT HOW
COULD SHE DO IT AND IN THE 

03:48:36.933 --> 03:48:39.590
SUMMER THEY SAID WILL SHE MAKE 
IT THROUGH THE SUMMER AND THEN 

03:48:39.804 --> 03:48:46.521
DEBATE AFTER DEBATE AFTER DEBATE
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS WE ARE HERE

03:48:46.725 --> 03:48:53.741
AND WE ARE STRONG. WITH THAT 
SAME GRID THAT GOT US THROUGH 

03:48:56.490 --> 03:49:00.765
THAT BLIZZARD, WE ARE NOW READY 
TO HEAD TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MY 

03:49:00.983 --> 03:49:04.394
FRIENDS HERE IN IOWA YOU KNOW WE
HAVE 

03:49:14.574 --> 03:49:17.360
BEATEN THE ODDS EVERY STEP OF 
THE WAY AND WE HAVE DONE IT ON 

03:49:17.575 --> 03:49:20.370
THE MERIT AND WITH IDEAS AND 
HARD WORK THANK YOU. WE KNOW IN 

03:49:20.586 --> 03:49:23.399
OUR HEARTS IN A DEMOCRACY IT IS 
NOT ABOUT THE LOUDEST VOICE OR 

03:49:23.616 --> 03:49:27.580
THE BIGGEST BANK ACCOUNT. IT IS 
ABOUT THE BEST IDEAS AND ABOUT 

03:49:27.793 --> 03:49:33.829
THE PERSON THAT CAN TURN THOSE 
IDEAS INTO ACTION. WE KNOW THAT 

03:49:34.134 --> 03:49:39.439
OUR PARTY CAN'T WIN BIG BY 
TRYING TO OUT DIVIDE THE DIVIDER

03:49:39.653 --> 03:49:46.677
IN CHIEF WE KNOW THAT WE WIN BY 
BRINGING PEOPLE WITH US INSTEAD 

03:49:46.984 --> 03:49:52.286
OF SHUTTING PEOPLE OUT. DONALD 
TRUMP'S WORST NIGHTMARE IS THAT 

03:49:52.498 --> 03:49:55.963
THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, PEOPLE
WHO HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE 

03:49:56.199 --> 03:50:01.973
NAME-CALLING AND THE MUDSLINGING
HAVE A CANDIDATE TO VOTE FOR IN 

03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:05.592
NOVEMBER. DONALD TRUMP'S WORST 
NIGHTMARE IS THAT THE FIRED UP 

03:50:05.802 --> 03:50:12.972
DEMOCRATS WILL MARCH TO VICTORY 
ALONGSIDE A BIG COALITION OF 

03:50:13.183 --> 03:50:14.713
INDEPENDENCE AND MODERATE 
REPUBLICANS THAT SEE THE 

03:50:14.714 --> 03:50:18.341
SELECTION JUST AS WE DO AND THE 
SELECTION IS AN ECONOMIC CHECK 

03:50:18.556 --> 03:50:25.365
BUT ALSO A PATRIOTIC CHECK. IT 
IS A DECENCY CHECK AND IT IS 

03:50:25.578 --> 03:50:27.578
THIS 

03:50:29.123 --> 03:50:31.123
SIMPLE IDEA THAT THE HEART 

03:50:33.606 --> 03:50:36.205
OF AMERICA, IS SO MUCH BIGGER 
THAN THE HEART OF THIS GUY IN 

03:50:36.413 --> 03:50:44.059
THE WHITE HOUSE. ARE COUNTRY 
CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF

03:50:46.841 --> 03:50:51.260
DONALD TRUMP AND OUR COLLECTIVE 
SENSE OF DECENCY CAN'T TAKE 

03:50:51.474 --> 03:50:54.919
ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. THE RULE OF 
LAW CAN'T WITHSTAND ANOTHER FOUR

03:50:55.135 --> 03:50:57.135
YEARS 

03:50:59.044 --> 03:51:01.044
OF PRESIDENT THAT THINKS HE IS 
ABOVE IT. OUR DEMOCRACY 

03:51:04.714 --> 03:51:06.714
CAN'T TOLERATE ANOTHER FOUR 
YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO WANTS 

03:51:06.850 --> 03:51:09.384
TO BULLDOZE RIGHT THROUGH IT. 
THE AMERICAN DREAM CAN'T TAKE 

03:51:09.593 --> 03:51:14.409
ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF PRESIDENT 
WHO THINKS HE CAN CHOOSE WHO 

03:51:15.191 --> 03:51:17.191
GETS IT. 

03:51:19.150 --> 03:51:21.555
HIS PLAYBOOK IS NOT HARD TO 
UNDERSTAND. IT IS REALLY THREE 

03:51:21.760 --> 03:51:27.392
WORDS. DIVIDE AND DEMORALIZE. I 
HAVE A PLAYBOOK THAT IS THREE 

03:51:27.593 --> 03:51:29.593
WORDS. UNITE 

03:51:32.751 --> 03:51:36.975
AND LEAD. THAT IS HOW I HAVE 
PASSED OVER 100 BILLS AS THE 

03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:40.603
LEAD DEMOCRAT IN THE UNITED 
STATES SENATE IN THE MIDDLE 

03:51:44.075 --> 03:51:46.824
OF THAT GRIDLOCK AND THAT IS AND
HOW I HAVE WON ELECTIONS IN THE 

03:51:47.169 --> 03:51:51.047
REDDEST OF RED CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICTS AND THE BLUEST OF BLUE

03:51:51.257 --> 03:51:54.657
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. THE 
PRESIDENT, HE MAY AS WELL HAVE A

03:51:54.863 --> 03:51:56.863
SIGN ON HIS DESK 

03:52:00.069 --> 03:52:03.076
THAT SAYS THE BUCK STOPS 
ANYWHERE BUT HERE AND LOOK AT 

03:52:03.301 --> 03:52:07.460
WHAT HE HAS DONE. HE BLAMES 
EVERYONE FOR OUR PROBLEMS. HE 

03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:09.680
BLAMES EVERYONE, PEOPLE THAT 
SHOULD NOT BE BLAMED. HE BLAMES 

03:52:11.228 --> 03:52:14.285
IMMIGRANTS AND HE BLAMES BARACK 
OBAMA. HE BLAMES THE FEDERAL 

03:52:14.504 --> 03:52:19.819
CHAIR THAT HE NOMINATED AND THE 
ENERGY SECRETARY THAT HE 

03:52:20.041 --> 03:52:22.309
APPOINTED AND THE GENERALS THAT 
HE COMMANDS AND YES THE KING 

03:52:26.012 --> 03:52:28.273
OF DENMARK. HE EVEN RECENTLY 
BLAMED 

03:52:33.256 --> 03:52:36.822
JUSTIN TRUDEAU FOR CUTTING HIM 
OUT OF THE CANADIAN VERSION OF 

03:52:37.041 --> 03:52:41.200
HOME ALONE TOO. WHO DOES THAT? 
WHO DOES THAT? WELL, LET ME TELL

03:52:41.420 --> 03:52:46.150
YOU WHAT I WILL DO. WHEN I AM 
BEHIND THAT DESK, I WILL TAKE 

03:52:48.871 --> 03:52:50.785
RESPONSIBILITY INSTEAD OF 
PASSING IT ON. I WILL REACH 

03:52:50.786 --> 03:52:53.746
ACROSS THE AISLE AND WORK WITH 
AMERICANS IN GOOD FAITH INSTEAD 

03:52:53.952 --> 03:52:55.952
OF 

03:52:57.975 --> 03:52:59.975
PICKING FIGHTS. I WILL BRING 
THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER INSTEAD OF

03:53:00.172 --> 03:53:02.618
PUSHING IT APART. SOME OF YOU 
MAY KNOW THAT OLD STORY OF ABOUT

03:53:06.913 --> 03:53:09.073
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT. IT 
WAS A STORY ABOUT HOW AFTER HE 

03:53:09.271 --> 03:53:11.271
DIED THEY PUT HIS BODY ON A 
TRAIN 

03:53:13.784 --> 03:53:16.027
AND IT WORKED ITS WAY TO 
WASHINGTON DC. AND THERE IS A 

03:53:16.235 --> 03:53:18.980
STORY OF A REPORTER WHO CAME 
UPON A MAN WHO WAS CRYING BY THE

03:53:19.188 --> 03:53:22.056
SIDE OF THOSE TRACKS AND THE MAN
HAD HIS HAT ON HIS CHEST AND HE 

03:53:23.240 --> 03:53:26.736
WAS SOBBING AND THE REPORTER 
LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID, SIR, DID

03:53:26.943 --> 03:53:32.119
YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT? 
DID YOU KNOW HIM? AND THE MAN 

03:53:32.322 --> 03:53:35.963
SAID NO. I DID NOT KNOW 
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT, BUT HE KNEW

03:53:36.174 --> 03:53:42.389
ME. HE KNEW ME. AND WHAT ARE WE 
MISSING SO MUCH RIGHT NOW IN OUR

03:53:42.586 --> 03:53:48.880
COUNTRY IS THAT SENSE OF 
EMPATHY. WE ARE MISSING THAT 

03:53:49.086 --> 03:53:52.554
CARING. I PROMISE YOU THIS. I 
WILL BRING BACK THAT SACRED 

03:53:56.407 --> 03:53:58.407
TRUST BETWEEN THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

03:54:02.969 --> 03:54:08.403
UNITED STATES. SO IF YOU ARE 
SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING HOW 

03:54:08.615 --> 03:54:13.042
GREAT THE ECONOMY IS WHEN YOU 
DON'T FEEL IT AND WHEN YOUR 

03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:17.384
PAYCHECK IS STRETCHED TO THE 
BREAKING POINT MONTH AFTER 

03:54:17.587 --> 03:54:19.587
MONTH. I KNOW YOU AND I WILL 
FIGHT 

03:54:22.533 --> 03:54:24.692
FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE SICK OF 
CHOOSING BETWEEN PAYING FOR 

03:54:24.896 --> 03:54:28.159
DAYCARE FOR YOUR KIDS AND LONG 
TERM CARE FOR YOUR PARENTS, I 

03:54:29.759 --> 03:54:31.793
KNOW YOU, AND I WILL FIGHT FOR 
YOU. IF YOU ARE 

03:54:35.768 --> 03:54:37.696
SICK OF BEING TORN BETWEEN 
FILLING THE REFRIGERATOR AND 

03:54:37.697 --> 03:54:42.009
FILLING A PRESCRIPTION, I KNOW 
YOU, AND I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. 

03:54:42.210 --> 03:54:44.210

03:55:15.466 --> 03:55:17.466

HAVE BEEN PUNCHING WAY BEYOND 
OUR WAY AND YOU KNOW 

03:56:00.842 --> 03:56:02.697
THAT DESPITE SOME LIMITED 
RESOURCES COMPARED TO SOME OF 

03:56:02.698 --> 03:56:05.931
THOSE BIGGER BANK ACCOUNTS WE 
ARE WAY ON THE BOARD SO LET'S 

03:56:10.133 --> 03:56:12.133

&gt;&gt; 

03:56:36.971 --> 03:56:40.345
AMY KLOBUCHAR CLAIMING ONE OF 
THOSE COVETED TICKETS OUT OF 

03:56:40.552 --> 03:56:43.469
IOWA BUT LET'S GET SOME CONTEXT.
WE HAVE GOTTEN WORD FROM THE 

03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:45.936
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT THERE IS A
DELAY IN THE RESULTS AND THEY 

03:56:46.140 --> 03:56:48.561
SAY IT IS A QUALITY CONTROL AND 
MAKING SURE THEY ARE CORRECT AND

03:56:48.765 --> 03:56:50.811
THEY'RE USING A NEW SYSTEM OF 
USING THREE DATA POINTS THIS 

03:56:51.011 --> 03:56:53.784
YEAR SO NOT ALLOWED OF TALLIES 
IN AND WE ARE WAITING FOR 

03:56:53.982 --> 03:56:56.016
RESULTS AND AS AMY KLOBUCHAR 
SAID IT WILL BE A LONG 

03:56:59.115 --> 03:57:01.546
NIGHT AND A PITCH AND CALL FOR 
PEOPLE TO SUPPORT HER AND LET'S 

03:57:01.745 --> 03:57:03.745
GO TO MY COLLEAGUES 

03:57:05.477 --> 03:57:07.832
HERE AND SHE IS SEIZING THIS 
MOMENT BUT LET'S BE CLEAR, SHE 

03:57:08.034 --> 03:57:11.723
HAS NOT BEEN DECLARED THE WINNER
OF THE IOWA CAUCUS. 

03:57:11.724 --> 03:57:14.497
&gt;&gt; IT IS. THERE FEELING GOOD. 
THE CAMPAIGN IS FEELING -- WE 

03:57:14.702 --> 03:57:18.046
HEARD FROM SOME OF THESE 
CAUCUSES THAT THEY FEEL LIKE 

03:57:18.245 --> 03:57:20.084
THEY'RE GETTING GOOD REPORTS 
FROM THE PRECINCTS WHERE THEY 

03:57:20.085 --> 03:57:23.819
HAVE THEIR PEOPLE AND THEY ARE 
NOT JUST DEPENDING ON THE 

03:57:24.018 --> 03:57:27.390
NUMBERS BEING SUBMITTED TO THE 
APP BUT THEIR PEOPLE ARE ALSO 

03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:29.627
REPORTING THAT PROBABLY ON THEIR
OWN APP BUT THE NUMBERS THAT 

03:57:29.833 --> 03:57:34.030
THEY ARE SEEN DOESN'T MEAN THEY 
ARE REALLY GOOD BUT THE 

03:57:37.778 --> 03:57:39.778
CLOVER CHART CAMPAIGN SAID THEY 
WILL 

03:57:42.261 --> 03:57:44.261
CONTINUE BECAUSE AMY KLOBUCHAR 
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE HAS BEEN 

03:57:44.281 --> 03:57:46.281
TYPECAST AS THE IOWA CANDIDATE. 
AND THE 

03:57:49.299 --> 03:57:51.408
THING ABOUT HER ISSUES THE 
DAUGHTER OF A NEWSPAPER MAN AND 

03:57:51.607 --> 03:57:54.688
SHE TALKS ABOUT HER GRANDFATHER,
I AM SORRY, HER FATHER CALLED 

03:57:54.884 --> 03:57:56.884
THE 1960 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
FOR JOHN 

03:58:01.529 --> 03:58:03.529
F. KENNEDY.

03:58:11.133 --> 03:58:13.566
SHE KIND OF HAS A MINDSET OF 
WANTING TO BE ACCESSIBLE AND 

03:58:13.780 --> 03:58:15.933
PROBABLY THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF 
THE CANDIDATES. THIS WILL GET A 

03:58:16.144 --> 03:58:18.707
PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
NEWSPAPERS THAT HAVE TO GO TO 

03:58:18.918 --> 03:58:21.505
PRINT AND IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT
SHE IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION 

03:58:21.714 --> 03:58:24.201
COMING OUT. IF JOE BIDEN IS 
DOING POORLY, SHE IS THE MOST 

03:58:24.474 --> 03:58:29.012
POISED TO BENEFIT FROM THAT. I 
THINK I SAW HER GIVE THE SAME 

03:58:29.213 --> 03:58:31.427
SPEECH OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 
AND THAT WAS A VERY ABRIDGED 

03:58:31.630 --> 03:58:34.949
VERSION OF IT AND IT WAS FUNNY 
THAT SHE MENTIONED AND TOLD ME 

03:58:35.150 --> 03:58:37.633
THE OTHER DAY SHE WAS READING A 
BOOK BY DORIS GOODWIN WHERE SHE 

03:58:37.836 --> 03:58:43.310
PICKED UP THAT FDR TIDBIT WE 
HEARD WHERE SHE SAID I DIDN'T 

03:58:43.511 --> 03:58:46.588
KNOW HIM BUT HE KNEW ME AND SHE 
SAW THAT WHEN SHE WAS BORED 

03:58:46.788 --> 03:58:51.176
DURING THE IMPEACHMENT AND ASHES
GOING TO THE BOOK AND SAW THE 

03:58:51.388 --> 03:58:53.388
ANECDOTE 

03:58:56.360 --> 03:58:59.905
AND SHE PUT THAT INTO HER 
SPEECH. 

03:58:59.906 --> 03:59:02.329
&gt;&gt; WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR THESE 
RESULTS TO COME IN AND THE 

03:59:02.527 --> 03:59:04.527
PERFECT TIMING TO GRAB THE 
SPOTLIGHT AND TALK TO PEOPLE 

03:59:04.546 --> 03:59:07.086
ABOUT HOW YOU THINK YOU HAVE 
DONE WELL THE NIGHT AND LET'S GO

03:59:07.282 --> 03:59:09.523
BACK TO OUR ELECTION INSIGHT 
TEAM IN DC AND JEREMY HAS BEEN 

03:59:09.728 --> 03:59:11.728
IN CONTACT WITH THE IOWA 
DEMOCRAT TONIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT 

03:59:11.768 --> 03:59:13.768
TONIGHT STATEMENT CAUGHT 

03:59:15.578 --> 03:59:17.492
YOUR ATTENTION? 
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THE THINGS OFF THE 

03:59:17.493 --> 03:59:19.925
TOP THAT WERE PRETTY OBVIOUS 
MADE A LOT OF SENSE. WE HAVE NOT

03:59:20.126 --> 03:59:22.126
SEEN ANY RESULTS 

03:59:24.724 --> 03:59:26.724
AND THE

03:59:30.364 --> 03:59:32.387
IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAID THEY 
ARE BEING CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE 

03:59:32.591 --> 03:59:34.648
THEY ARE GETTING EXACTLY WHAT 
THEY WANT TO SEE IN THOSE 

03:59:34.852 --> 03:59:36.905
RESULTS. I CAN TELL YOU WITH A 
LITTLE BIT OF INSIDER 

03:59:37.106 --> 03:59:38.726
INFORMATION THAT THESE ARE 
USUALLY FAIRLY COMPLEX SYSTEMS 

03:59:38.727 --> 03:59:41.266
AND THEY HAVE TO DO CHECK TO 
MAKE SURE THE VOTE TALLIES THEY 

03:59:41.465 --> 03:59:43.465
ARE GETTING MATCH THE KIND OF 
RESULTS THAT SHOULD BE 

03:59:43.502 --> 03:59:45.346
ACCEPTABLE. SO I TOTALLY 
UNDERSTAND THAT ESPECIALLY AS AN

03:59:45.347 --> 03:59:47.347
ENGINEERING DIRECT HER IN 
SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME

03:59:47.362 --> 03:59:49.805
BUT I DO SAY THERE WAS SOMETHING
BURIED IN THE BOTTOM OF THAT 

03:59:50.006 --> 03:59:52.006
STATEMENT THAT DID NOT MAKE 
SENSE UNTIL I STARTED TALKING 

03:59:52.128 --> 03:59:54.564
ABOUT FOLK SO THE THING THAT WAS
IN THAT STATEMENT WAS THERE WAS 

03:59:54.764 --> 03:59:56.764
EXPECTED TO BE 

03:59:59.093 --> 04:00:03.243
A TURNOUT ROUGHLY AT THE 2016 
LEVEL WHICH IS INTERESTING 

04:00:03.442 --> 04:00:05.673
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CHATTER 
BEFORE THE ELECTION WAS IT WAS 

04:00:05.876 --> 04:00:07.876
SUPPOSED TO BE A BOOM ELECTION 
IN PRETTY 

04:00:10.416 --> 04:00:13.563
BIG AND IT IS TIME FOR US TO 
SEND IT BACK TO ON THE GROUND IN

04:00:13.762 --> 04:00:15.790
IOWA, LIBBY. THANK YOU. SECOND 
WILL GO TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 

04:00:15.995 --> 04:00:18.520

HELLO, EVERYONE.

04:00:46.534 --> 04:00:48.534

I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE IN THE 
COLLEAGUES IN MY SENATE AND THE

04:00:56.787 --> 04:00:58.701

CAMPAIGN HERE. MOST OF ALL I

STRAIGHT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE 

04:01:18.114 --> 04:01:20.538
THEY ARE VERY CAREFUL IN THEIR 
DELIBERATIONS. AND INDICATIONS 

04:01:20.747 --> 04:01:22.768
ARE THAT IT WILL BE CLOSE AND WE
WILL WALK OUT 

04:01:26.380 --> 04:01:28.527
OF HERE WITH OUR SHARE OF 
DELEGATES AND WE DON'T KNOW 

04:01:28.727 --> 04:01:31.405

&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP AND I SEE 
AMERICA FROM DEAR, VERY 

04:02:19.403 --> 04:02:24.678
DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS AND WE HAVE
FOR A LONG TIME. TRUMP GREW UP 

04:02:24.877 --> 04:02:29.285
IN NEW YORK CITY AND A 23 ROOM 
NINE BATHROOM MANSION AND I

GROUT IN OKLAHOMA A TWO-BEDROOM 
HOUSE WITH ONE BATHROOM AND 

04:02:36.021 --> 04:02:38.996
A CONVERTED GARAGE WHERE MY 
THREE BROTHERS SLEPT AND BY THE 

04:02:39.202 --> 04:02:41.331
TIME HE WAS THREE DONALD TRUMP 
WAS GETTING A $200,000 ALLOWANCE

04:02:41.537 --> 04:02:46.121
EVERY YEAR FROM HIS DAD'S REAL 
ESTATE EMPIRE AND IN TOTAL HE 

04:02:46.319 --> 04:02:48.319
GOT NEARLY HALF $1 BILLION FROM 
HIS 

04:02:52.323 --> 04:02:56.411
DAD. ME? I TOOK ON SMALL JOBS TO
MAKE MONEY BABYSITTING AND 

04:02:56.609 --> 04:02:58.609

04:02:58.663 --> 04:03:01.940
CLAIMED BONE SPURS TO AVOID THE 
DRAFT AND ALL THREE OF MY OLDER 

04:03:02.141 --> 04:03:04.141
BROTHERS SIGNED UP FOR MILITARY 
SERVICE AND THE 

04:03:09.012 --> 04:03:11.012
OLDEST SPENT

04:03:12.941 --> 04:03:15.729
5 1/2 YEARS OFF AND ON IN COMBAT
IN VIETNAM AND BEFORE BECAME A 

04:03:15.932 --> 04:03:17.947
REALITY TV HOST DONALD TRUMP 
SAID MOST OF HIS CAREER RUNNING 

04:03:18.146 --> 04:03:20.033
ONE COMPANY AFTER ANOTHER INTO 
BANKRUPTCY STIFFING SMALL 

04:03:20.034 --> 04:03:24.013
BUSINESSES AND DRIPPING OFF 
WORKERS AND SCAMMING STUDENTS. I

04:03:24.219 --> 04:03:26.219
SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER 

04:03:29.642 --> 04:03:32.256
STUDYING MY FAMILY AND WHY 
OTHERS GO BROKE AND MAKING IT 

04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:34.469
EASIER FOR THEM TO GET BACK ON 

04:03:37.682 --> 04:03:39.723
THEIR FEET. BEFORE I WAS ELECTED
OFFICE, I BUILT AN ENTIRE 

04:03:39.927 --> 04:03:41.927
FEDERAL AGENCY 

04:03:43.195 --> 04:03:45.195
TO STOP BIG BANKS AND FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS FROM 

04:03:49.405 --> 04:03:51.405
CHEATING PEOPLE. AND I TELL 

04:03:55.592 --> 04:03:57.592

LOVE IT. I TELL YOU 

04:04:05.711 --> 04:04:08.794
THIS BECAUSE A PERSON'S VALUES 
MATTER. THE PRESIDENTS VALUES 

04:04:08.996 --> 04:04:12.471
MATTER. THE ONLY THING DONALD 
TRUMP VALUES IS DONALD TRUMP. HE

04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:19.172
BELIEVES THAT GOVERNMENT IS JUST
ONE MORE THING TO EXPLOIT, A 

04:04:19.377 --> 04:04:22.852
TOOL TO ENRICH HIMSELF AND HIS 
CORRUPT BUDDIES AT EVERYONE 

04:04:23.410 --> 04:04:27.386
ELSE'S EXPENSE. I BELIEVE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK 

04:04:32.201 --> 04:04:36.293
FOR EVERYONE. AND WE DON'T KNOW 
ALL THE RESULTS TONIGHT, BUT 

04:04:36.492 --> 04:04:40.117
TONIGHT HAS ALREADY SAID THAT 
AMERICA -- 

04:04:40.118 --> 04:04:42.135
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH WORN TO JOE BIDEN 
WHO IS ALSO SPEAKING TO 

04:04:45.414 --> 04:04:46.851
SUPPORTERS. 
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE, BLACK AND BROWN IN 

04:04:46.852 --> 04:04:48.852
THE WHOLE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE 

04:04:51.934 --> 04:04:53.934
OUT THERE. 

04:04:57.105 --> 04:05:01.312
THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE EVER 
FAILED AT WHEN WE TRIED TO DO IT

04:05:01.515 --> 04:05:04.099
TOGETHER AND NOTHING AMERICA HAS
EVER FAILED THAT AND SO LADIES 

04:05:04.305 --> 04:05:07.161
AND GENTLEMEN, ALL OF MY FRIENDS
AND BY THE WAY I WANT TO GIVE A 

04:05:07.363 --> 04:05:11.938

THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE 
HOPE OVER FEAR AND WE CHOOSE 

04:05:37.251 --> 04:05:42.897
SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND UNITY 
OVER DIVISION AND COMPASSION 

04:05:47.284 --> 04:05:50.720
OVER CRUELTY AND MAYBE MOST 
IMPORTANT OF ALL TRUTH

RESCUE OUR ECONOMY FROM THE 
DEPTH OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION OR

04:08:05.491 --> 04:08:07.491

04:08:10.468 --> 04:08:12.701
RIGHT NOW, ACROSS AMERICA, THERE
ARE FOLKS STANDING WITH GROUPS 

04:08:12.906 --> 04:08:17.692

04:13:22.593 --> 04:13:24.593
LET ME BEGIN 

04:13:28.265 --> 04:13:32.562
BY STATING I IMAGINE AND HAVE A 
STRONG FEELING THAT AT SOME 

04:13:32.776 --> 04:13:37.370
POINT THE RESULTS WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED. AND WHEN THOSE 

04:13:37.580 --> 04:13:44.255
RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED, I HAVE A 
GOOD FEELING WE ARE GOING TO BE 

04:13:44.546 --> 04:13:46.546
DOING VERY VERY WELL HERE 

04:13:50.118 --> 04:13:52.160
IN IOWA. AND 

04:13:57.169 --> 04:14:02.425
THE MESSAGE THAT IOWA HAS SENT 
TO THE NATION, A MESSAGE SHARED 

04:14:02.625 --> 04:14:07.968
BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IS THAT 
WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT THAT 

04:14:08.247 --> 04:14:11.609
REPRESENTS ALL OF US, NOT JUST 
WEALTHY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTORS 

04:14:11.812 --> 04:14:13.812
AND 

04:14:16.746 --> 04:14:23.948
THE 1%. TONIGHT IN THIS 

04:14:27.569 --> 04:14:29.569
ENORMOUSLY CONSEQUENTIAL 

04:14:31.175 --> 04:14:35.878
2020 ELECTION, THE FIRST STATE 
IN THE COUNTRY HAS VOTED. TODAY 

04:14:36.082 --> 04:14:38.595
MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE END 
OF 

04:14:43.572 --> 04:14:45.572
DONALD TRUMP.

04:14:49.909 --> 04:14:56.439
THE MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENT IN 
MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. YOU 

04:14:56.641 --> 04:15:03.043
KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT OUR 
POLITICAL VIEWS MAY BE, THE 

04:15:03.259 --> 04:15:07.759
PEOPLE OF AMERICA UNDERSTAND 
THAT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAVE A

04:15:08.130 --> 04:15:17.573
PRESIDENT WHO IS A PATHOLOGICAL 
LIAR AND CORRUPTS. WHO DOES NOT 

04:15:17.853 --> 04:15:24.886
UNDERSTAND OUR CONSTITUTION AND 
IS TRYING TO DIVIDE OUR PEOPLE 

04:15:25.093 --> 04:15:28.902
UP BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR 
SKIN, BASED ON THEIR RELIGION, 

04:15:29.104 --> 04:15:32.132
THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, OR 
WHERE THEY 

04:15:36.659 --> 04:15:40.094
WERE BORN. AND ALL OF THAT 
HATRED AND ALL OF 

04:15:45.108 --> 04:15:47.552
THAT DIVISIVENESS IS GOING TO 
END WHEN TOGETHER WE ARE IN THE 

04:15:52.137 --> 04:15:54.137
WHITE HOUSE.

04:15:58.832 --> 04:16:00.859
WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS 
ELECTION BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF 

04:16:01.065 --> 04:16:05.604
THE UNITED STATES ARE SICK AND 
TIRED OF A MASSIVE LEVEL OF 

04:16:05.827 --> 04:16:07.827
INCOME AND 

04:16:10.884 --> 04:16:12.884
WEALTH INEQUALITY. THEY DO WANT 
TAX BREAKS FOR 

04:16:16.022 --> 04:16:18.022
BILLIONAIRES AND CUTS TO SOCIAL 
SECURITY, MEDICARE, 

04:16:21.338 --> 04:16:25.538
AND MEDICAID. THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU 

04:16:25.772 --> 04:16:30.229
WORK 40 HOURS A WEEK, YOU SHOULD
NOT LIVE IN POVERTY AND WE HAVE 

04:16:30.435 --> 04:16:34.506
TO WAIVE THAT MINIMUM WAGE TO AT
LEAST $15 

04:16:39.230 --> 04:16:41.230
PER HOUR. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

04:16:43.857 --> 04:16:46.323
UNDERSTAND THAT HEALTHCARE IS A 
HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT 

04:16:51.262 --> 04:16:53.884
A PRIVILEGE. AND THAT OUR 
ADMINISTRATION IS 

04:16:57.785 --> 04:17:00.527
GOING TO TAKE ON THE GREED AND 
CORRUPTION OF THE INSURANCE 

04:17:00.731 --> 04:17:02.731
COMPANIES AND THE 

04:17:06.026 --> 04:17:09.198
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND 
WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, WE 

04:17:09.399 --> 04:17:13.186
WILL PASS A MEDICARE FOR ALL 
SINGLE 

04:17:18.092 --> 04:17:21.448
PAY PROGRAMS. AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE 

04:17:26.323 --> 04:17:30.261
YEAR 2020, ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, 
REGARDLESS OF INCOME, ARE 

04:17:30.461 --> 04:17:32.461
ENTITLED TO GET A 

04:17:35.962 --> 04:17:42.536
HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THAT IS 
WHY TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE PUBLIC

04:17:42.749 --> 04:17:45.735
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
TUITION 

04:17:50.545 --> 04:17:55.414
FREE AND WHY WE WILL CANCEL ALL 
STUDENT DEBT IN AMERICA,, AND WE

04:17:55.613 --> 04:17:57.613
WILL 

04:18:00.540 --> 04:18:04.565
DO THAT FOR A MODEST TAX ON WALL
STREET SPECULATIONS. AND 11 

04:18:04.761 --> 04:18:06.761
YEARS AGO WE 

04:18:09.104 --> 04:18:11.644
BAILED OUT THE CROOKS ON WALL 
STREET. NOW IT IS THEIR TIME TO 

04:18:11.851 --> 04:18:13.851
HELP THE 

04:18:15.808 --> 04:18:17.808
MIDDLE CLASS. AND 

04:18:20.798 --> 04:18:23.895
I'M LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, THE AMERICAN 

04:18:26.129 --> 04:18:32.677
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT CLIMATE 
CHANGE IS NOT A HOAX BUT IS AN 

04:18:34.723 --> 04:18:37.190
EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR 
COUNTRY AND THE 

04:18:41.253 --> 04:18:43.253
ENTIRE WORLD. THEY 

04:18:45.027 --> 04:18:48.987
UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIME IS NOW 
FOR US TO TAKE ON THE FOSSIL 

04:18:51.220 --> 04:18:56.758
FUEL INDUSTRY, TO TRANSFORM OUR 
ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY FROM FOSSIL 

04:18:59.645 --> 04:19:01.645
FUEL TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND 

04:19:05.325 --> 04:19:08.951
SUSTAINABLE ENERGIES. AND AS 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

04:19:09.399 --> 04:19:13.248
BECAUSE THIS IS A GLOBAL ISSUE 
AND NOT JUST AN AMERICAN ISSUE, 

04:19:13.450 --> 04:19:15.680
WE WILL SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE IN 
CHINA AND RUSSIA AND COUNTRIES 

04:19:15.883 --> 04:19:17.883
ALL OVER 

04:19:20.449 --> 04:19:23.939
THIS WORLD AND SAY MAYBE, JUST 
MAYBE, INSTEAD OF SPENDING $1.8 

04:19:24.141 --> 04:19:26.242
TRILLION A YEAR ON WEAPONS OF 
DESTRUCTION DESIGNED TO KILL 

04:19:26.442 --> 04:19:31.269
EACH OTHER, MAYBE WE SHOULD POOL
OUR RESOURCES AND FIGHT OUR 

04:19:31.549 --> 04:19:33.549
COMMON ENEMY, WHICH IS 

04:19:36.948 --> 04:19:43.021
CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE PEOPLE 
OF AMERICA KNOW THAT THE TIME IS

04:19:44.840 --> 04:19:46.840
LONG OVERDUE FOR MAJOR REFORMS 
TO A 

04:19:50.170 --> 04:19:52.170
BROKEN AND RACIST CRIMINAL 

04:19:54.639 --> 04:19:57.469
JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE ARE GOING TO 
INVEST IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN 

04:19:57.679 --> 04:20:00.142
JOBS AND EDUCATION, NOT MORE 
JAILS 

04:20:03.755 --> 04:20:08.391
AND INCARCERATION. AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND 

04:20:08.601 --> 04:20:10.601
THAT OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM 

04:20:12.521 --> 04:20:16.817
IS BROKEN. TOGETHER, WE WILL 
PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION 

04:20:17.105 --> 04:20:19.105
REFORM AND A PATH 

04:20:22.318 --> 04:20:24.947
TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE KNOW THAT GUN 

04:20:28.155 --> 04:20:30.912
SAFETY LEGISLATION WILL BE 
WRITTEN BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:33.485
AND NOT THE 

04:20:36.920 --> 04:20:38.920
NRA. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
MOST 

04:20:41.219 --> 04:20:45.441
CERTAINLY NO THAT IT IS WOMEN 
WHO MUST CONTROL THEIR OWN 

04:20:45.641 --> 04:20:47.641
BODIES AND 

04:20:50.696 --> 04:20:56.170
NOT POLITICIANS. BROTHERS AND 
SISTERS, YES, TOGETHER WE WILL 

04:20:56.369 --> 04:20:58.369
DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL 
DO MORE 

04:21:01.160 --> 04:21:05.456
THAN THAT. OUR MESSAGE TO WALL 
STREET AND THE INSURANCE 

04:21:05.661 --> 04:21:07.661
COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES
AND THE FOSSIL 

04:21:11.293 --> 04:21:16.395
FUEL INDUSTRIES AND THE 
MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND 

04:21:16.608 --> 04:21:22.842
THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, 
OUR MESSAGE TO THEM IS 

04:21:27.827 --> 04:21:29.827
CHANGES COMING.

04:21:34.840 --> 04:21:36.840
&gt;&gt; BERNIE. BERNIE.

04:21:38.968 --> 04:21:44.159
BERNIE. 
&gt;&gt; TOGETHER, WITH THE STRONGEST 

04:21:45.160 --> 04:21:48.163
GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THIS COUNTRY
HAS 

04:21:53.073 --> 04:21:55.073
EVER SEEN,

04:21:57.528 --> 04:21:59.747
WERE WE HAVE KNOCKED ON HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOORS HERE IN 

04:21:59.944 --> 04:22:04.294
IOWA AND WE ARE DOING IT IN NEW 
HAMPSHIRE. SO LET ME CONCLUDE 

04:22:08.015 --> 04:22:14.380
BY THANKING OUR GREAT STAFF AND 
OUR VOLUNTEERS HERE IN IOWA. AND

04:22:14.668 --> 04:22:22.624
NOW IT IS ON TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, 
NEVADA. SOUTH 

04:22:27.636 --> 04:22:31.234
CAROLINA, CALIFORNIA, AND ONWARD
TO VICTORY. THANK YOU ALL 

04:22:36.060 --> 04:22:38.060
VERY MUCH.

04:22:49.266 --> 04:22:51.358
&gt;&gt; BERNIE SANDERS ADDRESSING HIS
SUPPORTERS TONIGHT AND WE SAW A 

04:22:51.614 --> 04:22:53.817
LOT OF CANDIDATES GIVE SPEECHES 
TO THEIR SUPPORTERS AND A LOT OF

04:22:54.018 --> 04:22:56.018
THEM ARE HEADING TO NEW 
HAMPSHIRE EVEN TONIGHT SO THEY 

04:22:56.042 --> 04:22:58.675
WANT TO ADDRESS IOWA AND MOVE 
ON. A TOUGH SITUATION IS THAT WE

04:22:58.882 --> 04:23:00.882
DON'T HAVE RESULTS YET FROM THE 

04:23:03.025 --> 04:23:05.025
IOWA DEMOCRATIC

04:23:07.998 --> 04:23:10.320
PARTY AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR 
THINGS AND ISSUED A STATEMENT TO

04:23:10.517 --> 04:23:12.517
EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY 
SAID THAT WE FOUND 

04:23:12.520 --> 04:23:14.520
INCONSISTENCIES AND REPORTING OF
THREE SETS OF RESULTS AND IN 

04:23:14.538 --> 04:23:16.779
ADDITION TO THE TEXAS, TEXAS AND
BEING USED WE ARE USING PHOTOS 

04:23:16.982 --> 04:23:19.248
OF RESULTS AND A PAPER TRAIL TO 
VALIDATE THAT ALL RESULTS MATCH 

04:23:19.444 --> 04:23:23.844
AND ENSURE WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN
ACCURACY OF THE NUMBERS REPORT. 

04:23:24.047 --> 04:23:26.047
THIS IS SIMPLY A REPORTING 

04:23:28.965 --> 04:23:31.441
AND YOU, ISSUE. THE APP DIDN'T 
GO DOWN AND IT IS NOT AN 

04:23:31.643 --> 04:23:33.643
INTRUSION AND THE UNDERLYING 

04:23:35.326 --> 04:23:37.740
DATA AND PAPER TRAIL IS SOUND 
AND IT WILL TAKE TIME TO FURTHER

04:23:37.938 --> 04:23:39.938
REPORT THE RESULTS AND AGAIN 
THAT IS A STATEMENT FROM 

04:23:44.120 --> 04:23:47.574
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF I WENT 
FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR

04:23:47.776 --> 04:23:49.831
MANDY McCLURE AND WE WILL GET 
SOME PERSPECTIVE OF THIS AND 

04:23:50.033 --> 04:23:52.500
WHAT IT MEANS BESIDES THE ACTUAL
WAITING WE ARE DOING AND LET'S 

04:23:52.712 --> 04:23:54.808
GO TO JAMES HOMAN. 
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME. 

04:23:55.007 --> 04:23:57.214
&gt;&gt; WE DO KNOW THE CANDIDATES ARE
OFF. AMY KLOBUCHAR AND BERNIE 

04:23:57.422 --> 04:24:02.019
SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WORN AND 
JOE BIDEN HAVE CHARTERED 

04:24:02.218 --> 04:24:04.830
AIRCRAFT AND WE HAVE REPORTERS 
GOING OUT WITH THEM OVERNIGHT 

04:24:05.035 --> 04:24:10.494
AND THEY ALL HAVE EVENTS PLANNED
AND THE STATE OF THE UNION THEY 

04:24:10.695 --> 04:24:15.261
ARE PLANNING TO SKIP AND I THINK
THEY ARE LIKE WE HAVE BEEN 

04:24:15.468 --> 04:24:20.063
AROUND AND TODAY WAS A MANDATORY
DAY FOR THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

04:24:20.262 --> 04:24:22.511
AND TOMORROW IS NOT MANDATORY 
AND WEDNESDAY IS SO THEY WANT TO

04:24:22.709 --> 04:24:24.946
GET EVENTS AND THEN CAPITALIZE 
ON THIS MOMENTUM AND I THINK ONE

04:24:25.244 --> 04:24:28.880
OF THE THINGS COMING OUT WHAT 
THIS MEANS IS THERE WILL BE MORE

04:24:29.079 --> 04:24:34.846
TICKETS OUT AND THEY CAN CLAIM 
THE TREE ON THEIR OWN AND LIVED 

04:24:35.054 --> 04:24:38.822
TO DIE ANOTHER NEWS CYCLE AND 
ONCE WE GET THE NUMBERS THEY 

04:24:39.037 --> 04:24:43.307
WILL BE BAD FOR A FEW PEOPLE 
BUT, RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN SHOW UP 

04:24:43.511 --> 04:24:49.967
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ANDIN THE PAST 
THIS IS BEEN A NIGHT WHERE 

04:24:50.167 --> 04:24:53.421
PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT OR THEY 
DROP OUT THE NEXT MORNING. 

04:24:53.632 --> 04:24:56.064
NOBODY WILL DROP OUT BASED ON 
THE RESULTS IN IOWA AND IN THAT 

04:24:57.315 --> 04:25:02.390
WAY IT IS NOT NECESSARILY 
PLAYING THE SAME FIELD OR THE 

04:25:02.593 --> 04:25:04.593
SAME ROLE IN THE PAST AND THAT 
IS 

04:25:08.652 --> 04:25:10.652
SIGNIFICANT AND DOES UNDERMINE 
ONE OF THE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS OF

04:25:10.782 --> 04:25:12.782
THE IOWA CAUCUS. 
&gt;&gt; EUGENE, THERE IS 

04:25:16.047 --> 04:25:18.063
A SHORT TERM RESULTS IN THE 
LONGER TERM RESULTS AND THE 

04:25:18.265 --> 04:25:20.366
CRUNCHING AND LOOKING AT THE 
DATA AND FIGURING OUT WHERE YOU 

04:25:20.564 --> 04:25:23.404
PERFORMED WELL IN IOWA AND WHAT 
WAS THE APPEAL BUT IN TERMS OF 

04:25:23.608 --> 04:25:28.406
THE RAW MOMENTUM OF GETTING OUT 
OF IOWA, THIS IS WE WILL SEE 

04:25:28.617 --> 04:25:30.842
WHEN THE RESULTS COME OUT BUT 
THIS IS CHANGING THINGS. 

04:25:30.843 --> 04:25:33.405
&gt;&gt; INDEED. WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT 
NOW IS THAT NOBODY LOST AND THAT

04:25:33.613 --> 04:25:37.034
IS WHAT PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR 
AND THE TEAMS NEEDED TO HEAR. I 

04:25:38.739 --> 04:25:43.333
IMAGINE IT THESE ACTUAL CAUCUSES
WERE WATCHING THAT THERE MAY 

04:25:43.551 --> 04:25:47.720
HAVE BEEN SOME ANXIETY AMONG 
PEOPLE WHO WENT FOR A CANDIDATE 

04:25:47.935 --> 04:25:50.199
ONLY TO DISCOVER THE CANDIDATE 
IS NOT AS POPULAR AS THEIR 

04:25:50.413 --> 04:25:53.587
CAUCUS SAID THEY MAY HAVE BEEN 
IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD OR MAYBE EVEN

04:25:53.799 --> 04:25:55.799
IN SOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE 
DIVIDED. SO HEARING 

04:26:00.418 --> 04:26:03.310
THESE FEATURES AND THESE 
CANDIDATES REMINDING THEIR 

04:26:03.522 --> 04:26:05.652
SUPPORTERS THAT YOU MADE THE 
RIGHT DECISION TO BACK ME AND 

04:26:05.861 --> 04:26:09.811
KEEP SUPPORTING ME AND HOPING 
THEY MAYBE PICKED UP SOME MORE 

04:26:10.019 --> 04:26:12.243
PEOPLE IN THESE MOMENTS BECAUSE 
I DO IMAGINE THERE ARE PEOPLE 

04:26:12.463 --> 04:26:14.463
WATCHING THESE 

04:26:15.686 --> 04:26:17.833
SPEECHES AND MAYBE THEY HAVE NOT
LISTENED TO BEFORE AND MAYBE 

04:26:18.046 --> 04:26:20.606
THEY HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON 
BIDEN AND THEY HAVE NOT HEARD OF

04:26:20.818 --> 04:26:24.381
AMY WHICH ARE OR GIVEN ELIZABETH
WARREN ATTENTION AND IT WAS AN 

04:26:24.594 --> 04:26:27.310
OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR 
CANDIDATES TO SAY LET'S KEEP 

04:26:27.533 --> 04:26:29.533
GOING AND 

04:26:32.387 --> 04:26:34.387
DO BETTER

04:26:40.271 --> 04:26:42.615
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH WON'T BE 
A CAUCUS BY THE WAY AND 

04:26:42.907 --> 04:26:44.596
THEREFORE WILL BE A LITTLE 
EASIER THAN THIS. 

04:26:44.597 --> 04:26:47.396
&gt;&gt; A GREAT POINT THAT THIS MAY 
BE THE FIRST TIME SOME OF OUR 

04:26:47.606 --> 04:26:49.345
VIEWERS ARE HEARING THESE 
FEATURES WHICH ESSENTIALLY ARE 

04:26:49.346 --> 04:26:51.520
STUMP SPEECHES AND YOU HAVE BEEN
TO SOME OF THESE 

04:26:51.521 --> 04:26:53.987
&gt;&gt; I WAS QUOTING. 
&gt;&gt; BUT THEY ARE SAYING IT AND IS

04:26:54.197 --> 04:26:56.753
THE EXPRESSION IS NEW TO YOU 
THIS IS THAT MOMENT TO SEND HIM 

04:26:56.964 --> 04:26:59.115
A MESSAGE TO THE NATIONAL 
AUDIENCE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

04:26:59.329 --> 04:27:01.666
TO YOU? FEKETE REMINDED ME OF 
THE OLD JOE LIEBERMAN LINE MORE 

04:27:01.881 --> 04:27:04.895
OR LESS SAYING WE ARE TIED FOR 
FIRST PLACE AND WE WILL SEE WHAT

04:27:07.938 --> 04:27:10.321
HAPPENS BUT IN MANY WAYS THEY 
WERE ALL JUST GOING BACK TO 

04:27:10.534 --> 04:27:13.117
THEIR STUMP SPEECHES AND I THINK
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THERE IS A 

04:27:13.330 --> 04:27:15.592
BIGGER AUDIENCE THAN USUAL RIGHT
NOW IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA AND 

04:27:15.809 --> 04:27:18.595
THE EYES OF THE COUNTRY ARE ON 
THEM SO SOME NEW AUDIENCES FOR 

04:27:18.807 --> 04:27:20.807
THEM TO GIVE THEIR 

04:27:22.893 --> 04:27:25.094
SPEECHES BUT AMY KLOBUCHAR, WHO 
WAS FIRST STOOD OUT TO ME 

04:27:25.305 --> 04:27:27.619
BECAUSE HERS WAS ALL ABOUT 
TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND 

04:27:27.834 --> 04:27:32.116
HOW SHE COULD BEAT HIM AND SHE 
KNOWS SHE HAD A VOLUNTEER 

04:27:32.333 --> 04:27:34.558
STANDING NEXT TO HER WEARING A 
T-SHIRT THAT SAID AMY KLOBUCHAR 

04:27:34.776 --> 04:27:36.776
BEATS 

04:27:39.401 --> 04:27:41.401
DONALD TRUMP

04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:46.696
AND I AM SURE THAT IS NOT AN 
ACCIDENT. SHE WAS REALLY GOING 

04:27:46.914 --> 04:27:48.914
IN FOR THAT ELECTABILITY 
ARGUMENT WHICH IS ONE OF THE 

04:27:49.031 --> 04:27:51.852
THINGS THAT A LOT OF VOTERS HAVE
HAD A HARD TIME MAKING UP THEIR 

04:27:55.029 --> 04:27:57.670
MIND AND THAT IS BEEN LIKE THE 
CENTRAL CONCERN FOR THEM IS WHO 

04:27:57.878 --> 04:28:00.015
CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. YOU HEARD
CANDIDATES GOING TO THAT IN 

04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:02.229
THEIR STATEMENT TRYING TO MAKE 
THAT THE CENTRAL RATIONALE OF 

04:28:02.368 --> 04:28:04.368
THEIR CANDIDACIES. 
&gt;&gt; I AM SURE THEY WILL BE USING 

04:28:04.504 --> 04:28:06.504
SPLIT SCREEN OPPORTUNITIES 
TOMORROW NIGHT WITH THE STATE OF

04:28:06.552 --> 04:28:08.820
THE UNION HAPPENING AND BERNIE 
SANDERS SAID HE WON'T GO AND 

04:28:09.060 --> 04:28:11.353
OTHER SENATORS HAVE YOU HEARD IF
ELIZABETH WORN IS GOING? 

04:28:11.354 --> 04:28:13.151
&gt;&gt; I KNOW STANDARDS SAID HE 
WON'T GO. 

04:28:13.152 --> 04:28:16.096
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW FOR SURE WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER SO 

04:28:16.316 --> 04:28:18.466
THEY ARE NOT OWING TO THE STATE 
OF THE UNION BUT 

04:28:21.849 --> 04:28:24.015
THERE WERE -- THE WAR LANGUAGE 
WAS NEW. THAT WAS A 

04:28:27.520 --> 04:28:29.951
NEW SPEECH. WHAT THE OTHERS SAY 
BASICALLY IS WHAT WE ALWAYS HEAR

04:28:30.166 --> 04:28:32.534
FROM THEM BUT ALL FOUR OF THEM 
TOOK HARD FRONTAL DIRECT HITS 

04:28:32.746 --> 04:28:35.114
THAT DONALD TRUMP. THAT I THINK 
IS PART OF SETTING UP THAT 

04:28:35.330 --> 04:28:38.859
CONTRAST AHEAD OF THE STATE OF 
THE UNION AND AHEAD OF THE 

04:28:39.072 --> 04:28:42.203
CERTAIN ACQUITTAL ON WEDNESDAY 
AND THEY ARE KIND OF 

04:28:46.945 --> 04:28:49.174
SHARPENING THAT CONTRAST AND 
PART OF THAT IS TO CONVEY TO 

04:28:49.391 --> 04:28:52.014
VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT I 
CAN GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH HIM AND

04:28:52.226 --> 04:28:55.865
I CAN BEAT HIM AND IT GETS BACK 
TO THAT ELECT ABILITY QUESTION 

04:28:56.075 --> 04:28:58.239
THAT IS CENTRAL TO THE MINDS OF 
THE VOTERS IN IOWA. 

04:29:01.545 --> 04:29:03.634
&gt;&gt; AND THOSE FOUR SENATORS ARE 
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT INCLUDING 

04:29:03.864 --> 04:29:06.844
MICHAEL BENNET HAD TO GO BACK TO
DC TODAY TO BE IN THE TRIAL AND 

04:29:07.055 --> 04:29:09.055
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE 

04:29:11.716 --> 04:29:14.649
TOMORROW AND NOT ATTENDING THE 
STATE OF THE UNION IS A DECISION

04:29:14.858 --> 04:29:16.805
TO MAKE. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS A BIG DECISION. SECT 

04:29:16.806 --> 04:29:18.954
NORMALLY YOU GET CRITICIZED FOR 
THAT. TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE HIS 

04:29:19.174 --> 04:29:21.593
VICTORY LAP AND THERE IS SOME 
VALUE OF BEING THERE BECAUSE YOU

04:29:21.816 --> 04:29:23.816
CAN USE IT AS A PLATFORM, BUT 

04:29:26.295 --> 04:29:28.457
THEY ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE WEEK 
UNTIL NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

04:29:28.458 --> 04:29:30.458
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO WASHINGTON 
AND 

04:29:33.687 --> 04:29:38.848
JEREMY. SO WITH THE TEAM THERE, 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TURNOUT 

04:29:39.074 --> 04:29:41.224
TONIGHT, AND CANNOT TELL US 
ANYTHING? BACK THAT IS THE THING

04:29:41.435 --> 04:29:43.577
WE HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN AND 
SOMETHING WE SAW ON THAT 

04:29:43.786 --> 04:29:47.609
STATEMENT THAT CAME FROM THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY EARLIER TONIGHT

04:29:47.819 --> 04:29:52.081
INDICATED THAT THEY WERE 
EXPECTING THE TURNOUT IN THE 25%

04:29:52.299 --> 04:29:54.541
OF PRECINCTS WHERE THEY HAD SEEN
RESULTS WAS THAT ROUGHLY 2016 

04:29:54.751 --> 04:29:56.751
LEVELS. THIS SENT OFF A 

04:29:59.477 --> 04:30:01.837
LITTLE SPIDEY SENSE BECAUSE ONE 
OF THE THINGS IN THE THEME IN 

04:30:02.057 --> 04:30:04.703
THE RUN-UP TO THE RACE WITH A 
DISCUSSION OF HOW MANY MORE 

04:30:04.915 --> 04:30:08.773
PEOPLE WE WERE EXPECTING TO SHOW
UP AND AT A POINT THERE WAS THE 

04:30:08.985 --> 04:30:10.985
POLK COUNTY DEMOCRATIC CHAIR 

04:30:14.259 --> 04:30:18.271
TWEETED ABOUT GETTING A STACK OF
NEW BALLOTS AND NEEDED THAT AS 

04:30:18.485 --> 04:30:21.109
EARLY AS 8:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME 
AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

04:30:21.333 --> 04:30:23.482
REALLY INTRIGUING TO US BECAUSE 
THE TURNOUT NUMBER COULD HAVE A 

04:30:23.694 --> 04:30:25.694
WIDE RANGING EFFECT DEPENDING ON
HOW DIFFERENT CANDIDATES DEAL 

04:30:25.712 --> 04:30:28.952
WITH IT SO FOR LITTLE BIT MORE 
ON THAT WE WILL BRING IN POST 

04:30:29.169 --> 04:30:31.900
OPINION COLUMNISTS AND DATA 
EXPERT AND ALL-AROUND 

04:30:36.796 --> 04:30:38.796
SWELL GUY,

04:30:40.722 --> 04:30:43.113
DAVID. WHAT HAPPENS IN A RACE 
THAT IS NOT THE HIGH TURNOUT 

04:30:43.323 --> 04:30:45.721
MONSTER WE WERE EXPECTING? WHAT 
IF IT IS JUST A LOW TURNOUT 

04:30:45.933 --> 04:30:47.283
2016? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS AN EXCELLENT 

04:30:47.284 --> 04:30:49.484
QUESTION. I THINK WE ARE IN A 
LITTLE BIT OF UNCHARTERED 

04:30:49.691 --> 04:30:51.691
TERRITORY THAT WITH THIS 
ELECTION I THINK WE EXPECTED IT 

04:30:51.845 --> 04:30:55.570
TO BE A HIGHER TURNOUT OR AT 
LEAST MORE IN PACE WITH 2016. 

04:30:55.781 --> 04:30:58.438
BECAUSE THEN THERE WERE TWO 
CONTESTS AT THE SAME 

04:31:03.066 --> 04:31:05.412
TIME AND THIS YEAR THERE ARE A 
LOT OF DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AND 

04:31:05.624 --> 04:31:07.624
MULTIPLE ONES WHO ENERGIZE THE 
ACTIVIST 

04:31:11.004 --> 04:31:14.421
BASE AND DEMOCRATS ARE MOTIVATED
TO BE TRUMP AND THEY ARE 

04:31:14.633 --> 04:31:16.760
ENTHUSIASTIC AND WE SAW THIS IN 
THE 2018 MIDTERM. ALL THESE 

04:31:16.971 --> 04:31:18.971
INDICATORS POINTED TOWARD BETTER
TURNOUT THE 

04:31:21.620 --> 04:31:24.312
2016 BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE 
HAVE SEEN IN THE STATEMENT. IT 

04:31:24.522 --> 04:31:26.522
IS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THESE 
ARE ALL PROVISIONAL, AND WE 

04:31:26.667 --> 04:31:29.492
DON'T HAVE THE VOTES TO MAKE 
STRONG INFERENCES AND MAYBE 

04:31:29.702 --> 04:31:33.019
TURNOUT LOOK DIFFERENT. BUT IT 
IS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION 

04:31:33.237 --> 04:31:34.984
THAN WHAT I THINK WE WERE EXPECT
THEM. 

04:31:34.985 --> 04:31:36.985
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. YOU KNOW, 

04:31:40.388 --> 04:31:44.347
THOSE EXTRA PATIENTS WILL BE THE
THING THAT DRIVES US THROUGH THE

04:31:44.555 --> 04:31:47.150
REST OF THE NIGHT. WE'RE HOPING 
WE WILL START GETTING VOTES HERE

04:31:47.356 --> 04:31:49.732
AT ANY POINT FROM THE IOWA 
DEMOCRATS. WHEN WE DO WE HAVE 

04:31:49.945 --> 04:31:52.841
PLENTY OF STUFF TO SHOW YOU AND 
PLENTY OF INSIGHTS TO GIVE YOU A

04:31:53.052 --> 04:31:55.591
PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND SEE 
WHAT IS GOING ON. UNTIL THEN WE 

04:31:55.809 --> 04:31:58.800
CAN GET BACK TO IOWA AND LIBBY. 
&gt;&gt; WE WILL BE IN FOR A LONG 

04:31:59.018 --> 04:32:01.724
NIGHT. JOINING US NOW

04:32:05.461 --> 04:32:07.401
IS THE ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF 
POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM THE 

04:32:07.402 --> 04:32:09.575
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK 
YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE 

04:32:09.796 --> 04:32:12.157
ARE WAITING TO SEE THE RESULTS 
TONIGHT AND THIS IS A BIT 

04:32:12.365 --> 04:32:14.684
UNUSUAL TO HAVE THE PAUSE BUTTON
ON. WHAT DOES LEAVING IOWA 

04:32:14.895 --> 04:32:16.895
MEETING 

04:32:19.036 --> 04:32:21.484
WITH POTENTIAL, A LOT OF TICKETS
SPREAD OUT AMONG THE FIELD AND 

04:32:21.695 --> 04:32:24.056
WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR NEW 
HAMPSHIRE AND ON DOWN INTO SUPER

04:32:24.283 --> 04:32:26.283
TUESDAY? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK A LOT OF THIS MEANS 

04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:30.595
THE REAL WINNER OF IOWA MAY BE 
DONALD TRUMP IN THE 

04:32:35.042 --> 04:32:39.606
SENSE THAT THE MORE CANDIDATES 
THERE ARE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

04:32:39.821 --> 04:32:42.200
THE RANKING ORDER WILL BE AND 
THAT IS WHATEVER BUT HE FIXATES 

04:32:42.411 --> 04:32:44.411
ON EVEN THOUGH CHANCES ARE MOST 
OF THE CANDIDATES WILL 

04:32:47.395 --> 04:32:50.055
BE PRETTY -- MOST OF THE VIABLE 
CANDIDATES TO BE CLOSE TO EACH 

04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:52.208
OTHER IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGES 
AND DELEGATES, BUT THE 

04:32:52.209 --> 04:32:54.789
PERCEPTION WILL BE DIG DATED BY 
WHAT THE ORDER IS AND WE WON'T 

04:32:55.001 --> 04:32:58.048
KNOW THAT AND MAYBE WE WILL NOTE
TONIGHT AND MAYBE WE WON'T. BUT 

04:32:58.260 --> 04:33:00.260
THAT TENDS TO 

04:33:03.550 --> 04:33:06.436
BE WHAT SHAPES THINGS. IF THAT 
SHAPES UP IN SUCH A WAY THAT A 

04:33:06.650 --> 04:33:09.219
LOT OF CANDIDATES ARE STILL IN 
THE RACE AND A LOT OF CANDIDATES

04:33:09.452 --> 04:33:12.431
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLAIM A 
TICKET TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ON 

04:33:12.654 --> 04:33:14.654
TO THE OTHER EARLY 

04:33:16.955 --> 04:33:19.430
STATES, THAT MAKES IT MORE AND 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PARTY TO 

04:33:19.652 --> 04:33:21.585
COORDINATE ON A PARTICULAR 
CANDIDATE AND THAT IS REALLY 

04:33:21.586 --> 04:33:24.900
WHAT THE PARTY IS TRYING TO DO 
IN THIS PROCESS 

04:33:24.901 --> 04:33:26.901
&gt;&gt; ALSO GREAT NEWS FOR MIKE 
BLOOMBERG. 

04:33:30.355 --> 04:33:32.832
HIS STRATEGIES SKIP THE EARLY 
STATES AND HOPE THERE IS A MODEL

04:33:33.040 --> 04:33:35.040
AND NO ONE COMES OUT THE 

04:33:37.918 --> 04:33:40.304
CLEAR FAVORITE AND BIDEN SEEMS 
WEEK AND THEN COME IN ON SUPER 

04:33:40.517 --> 04:33:42.796
TUESDAY AND SPEND HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I THINK 

04:33:43.009 --> 04:33:45.009
THE CONFUSION AND MESS TONIGHT 
HELPS 

04:33:47.206 --> 04:33:48.714
HIM. 
&gt;&gt; IS IT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 

04:33:48.715 --> 04:33:50.950
CANDIDATES? BACK AT THE GET IS 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO 

04:33:51.167 --> 04:33:53.503
CONTINUE TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT 
THERE AND REVISIT ANY IDEAS THEY

04:33:53.716 --> 04:33:57.926
MAY HAVE HAD THAT THEY 
QUESTIONED AND WEREN'T AS 

04:33:58.136 --> 04:34:00.136
EFFECTIVE OR IMPLEMENT SOME NEW 
STRATEGIES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT

04:34:00.947 --> 04:34:02.947
COULD BE MORE WIN SOME. 

04:34:06.110 --> 04:34:08.271
I THINK ONE INTERESTING THING 
TONIGHT IS WE DON'T KNOW YET. 

04:34:08.481 --> 04:34:10.828
BUT I WONDER IF PART OF THE 
REASON WHY THEY ARE CHECKING 

04:34:11.043 --> 04:34:16.153
ACCURACY IS BECAUSE THEY HAD AN 
INCREASE IN TURNOUT AND MAY BE 

04:34:16.373 --> 04:34:18.373
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS 
IN ORDER AND THAT 

04:34:22.280 --> 04:34:24.994
COULD COMMUNICATE SOMETHING TO 
PEOPLE IN TERMS OF INTEREST AND 

04:34:25.208 --> 04:34:27.570
A LOT OF FOCUS ON WHETHER 
TURNOUT WILL BE AS BIG IN 

04:34:27.778 --> 04:34:30.134
NOVEMBER AS PEOPLE FEEL LIKE IT 
NEEDS TO BE TO DEFEAT DONALD 

04:34:30.347 --> 04:34:32.347
TRUMP. SO I THINK WE DON'T KNOW 
YET WHAT 

04:34:35.356 --> 04:34:39.318
THIS MEANS. IT IS THE PROBLEM OF
THE REALITY OF TALKING ABOUT 

04:34:39.535 --> 04:34:41.675
THESE THINGS IN REAL TIME 
WITHOUT HAVING A LOT OF ANSWERS 

04:34:41.894 --> 04:34:43.894
TO THE PROBLEMS. 
&gt;&gt; YOU BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT 

04:34:44.004 --> 04:34:48.432
ABOUT HOW THIS COULD BE A ROAD 
TEST FOR CANDIDATES MESSAGING 

04:34:48.638 --> 04:34:50.638
AND REALLY DIGGING INTO THE 
NITTY-GRITTY OF THEM AND HOW 

04:34:50.767 --> 04:34:52.910
DOES THE MESSAGE PLAY WITH 
PEOPLE IN THIS PART OF IOWA 

04:34:53.125 --> 04:34:55.437
WHERE THERE IS LIKE A REAL 
AGRICULTURAL 

04:35:00.435 --> 04:35:02.435
THING AND

04:35:06.605 --> 04:35:08.976
THIS GIVES THEM ANOTHER CHANCE 
TO RETUNE AS THEY HIT THE ROAD 

04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:10.993
AND CONTINUE ON. 
&gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY WILL 

04:35:10.994 --> 04:35:12.994
HAVE TO RETUNE ANYWAY. 
&gt;&gt; BUT THEY GET ANOTHER CHANCE. 

04:35:13.150 --> 04:35:15.919
&gt;&gt; THEY DO. WE DO HAVE A STORY 
AND I THOUGHT ONLINE ABOUT HOW 

04:35:16.137 --> 04:35:19.586
IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND 
NEVADA AND SOUTH CAROLINA 

04:35:19.801 --> 04:35:21.801
OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY 

04:35:24.854 --> 04:35:26.854
DIFFERENT, BUT

04:35:29.127 --> 04:35:31.049
TOGETHER THEY ACTUALLY REFLECT 
AMERICA A LITTLE MORE THAN 

04:35:31.050 --> 04:35:33.226
PEOPLE I THINK WOULD REALIZE. IT
WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING TO 

04:35:33.450 --> 04:35:36.098
SEE WHAT THEY DO TO TRY TO BE 
MORE ATTRACTIVE TO VOTERS. 

04:35:36.099 --> 04:35:38.899
&gt;&gt; SO THIS IS A POINT THAT THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS PUT OUT A 

04:35:39.113 --> 04:35:41.713
STATEMENT POKING AND PUSHING AT 
THE DEMOCRATS. 

04:35:41.714 --> 04:35:43.714
&gt;&gt; BRAD, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
MANAGER AND 

04:35:47.701 --> 04:35:49.701
A CARE DRASTICALLY TRUMP 
STATEMENT SAID DEMOCRATS ARE 

04:35:49.745 --> 04:35:51.745
STEWING IN A CAUCUS MESS OF 
THEIR OWN CREATION WITH 

04:35:55.796 --> 04:35:57.796
THE SLOPPIEST

04:36:02.985 --> 04:36:05.601
TRAIN WRECK IN HISTORY. IT WOULD
BE NATURAL FOR PEOPLE TO DOUBT 

04:36:05.811 --> 04:36:08.144
THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCESS AND 
THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT 

04:36:08.357 --> 04:36:10.312
WANT TO RUN OUR ENTIRE 
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM? TONIGHT 

04:36:10.313 --> 04:36:12.313
PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED A RECORD 
PERFORMANCE IN THE WELL-RUN GOP 

04:36:12.453 --> 04:36:14.453
IOWA CAUCUSES WITH RECORD 
TURNOUT FOR AN INCUMBENT AND 

04:36:14.536 --> 04:36:17.299
THAT GETS A STAB THEY ARE TRYING
TO PICK UP WHICH IS THE SPEECH 

04:36:17.511 --> 04:36:19.511
THAT SENATOR SANDERS GAVE HE 
EXPRESSED A HIGH DEGREE OF 

04:36:19.656 --> 04:36:22.428
CONFIDENCE AND HE DID NOT SAY HE
ONE BUT HE DID SAY I THINK 

04:36:22.639 --> 04:36:24.873
THINGS WILL LOOK REALLY GOOD 
ONCE YOU GET THE NUMBERS. IF, 

04:36:25.096 --> 04:36:27.726
INDEED, THE NUMBERS DO COME OUT 
SAY TOMORROW AND HE HAD KIND OF 

04:36:27.941 --> 04:36:32.462
A DECISIVE VICTORY FOR WHATEVER 
REASON, THE SANDERS PEOPLE WOULD

04:36:32.675 --> 04:36:35.134
BE VERY UPSET ABOUT THAT AND 
THEY WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY WERE 

04:36:36.675 --> 04:36:38.675
WRONG AND MAYBE THEY WERE DOING 
QUALITY ASSURANCE IN PART 

04:36:38.804 --> 04:36:41.832
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THE 
NUMBERS. THAT WILL FUEL THAT 

04:36:42.043 --> 04:36:44.043
MISTRUST BETWEEN THE 

04:36:45.777 --> 04:36:47.996
PARTY ESTABLISHMENT IN THE 
BERNIE WING OF THE PARTY AND I 

04:36:48.205 --> 04:36:52.168
THINK THAT IS A DIVISION THAT IS
A SCAB THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 

04:36:52.377 --> 04:36:54.752
AND I KNOW FROM REPORTING IS 
EARLY TO PICK AS MUCH IS 

04:36:59.214 --> 04:37:01.214
POSSIBLE. 
&gt;&gt;

04:37:02.969 --> 04:37:05.347
JOE BIDEN EARLIER TONIGHT GIVE A
SPEECH FROM HIS WATCH PARTY IN 

04:37:05.556 --> 04:37:08.119
DES MOINES AND WE MISSED PART OF
IT BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY 

04:37:08.327 --> 04:37:10.835
HAPPENING AT ONCE AND IT WAS 
MOMENTS AGO AND LET'S LISTEN TO 

04:37:11.051 --> 04:37:16.074
A LITTLE BIT. 
&gt;&gt; HELLO, EVERYONE. WELCOME. 

04:37:16.284 --> 04:37:23.598
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A LONG 
NIGHT. THAT I AM FEELING GOOD. I

04:37:23.815 --> 04:37:25.815
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL, ALL OF 
OUR 

04:37:28.408 --> 04:37:30.329
SUPPORTERS AND ALL OF THOSE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHO HOLD 

04:37:30.330 --> 04:37:32.330
PUBLIC OFFICE IN THE STATE TO 

04:37:35.811 --> 04:37:37.811
ENDORSE AS

04:37:39.576 --> 04:37:41.696
AND ALL THE ENDORSEMENTS FROM 
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND MY 

04:37:41.987 --> 04:37:43.987
COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE AND 
HOUSE FROM THE VICE PRESIDENCY 

04:37:44.111 --> 04:37:46.264
AND ALL OF YOU AND ALL THE 
PEOPLE FROM DELAWARE AND 

04:37:46.473 --> 04:37:49.012
CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE
WHO CAME FROM ALL OVER TO HELP 

04:37:49.234 --> 04:37:53.070
CAMPAIGN HERE. I LIKE THAT. AND 
MOST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE 

04:37:53.285 --> 04:37:57.893
PEOPLE OF IOWA WHO ARE HERE. 
WELL, THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

04:37:58.113 --> 04:38:00.113
IS WORKING TO GET THIS RESOLVED 
AND GET 

04:38:02.775 --> 04:38:05.444
THEM STRAIGHT AND I WANT TO MAKE
SURE THEY ARE CAREFUL IN THEIR 

04:38:05.654 --> 04:38:09.806
DELIBERATIONS. AND INDICATIONS 
ARE THAT IT WILL BE CLOSE AND WE

04:38:10.016 --> 04:38:12.590
WILL WALK OUT OF HERE WITH OUR 
SHARE OF DELEGATES AND WE DON'T 

04:38:12.812 --> 04:38:16.741
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YET, BUT
WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE.

04:38:16.955 --> 04:38:23.469
SO IT IS ON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
AND NEVADA. SOUTH CAROLINA AND 

04:38:23.925 --> 04:38:27.230
WELL BEYOND. WE ARE IN THIS FOR 
THE 

04:38:31.307 --> 04:38:33.452
LONG HAUL. I WANT US TO 
REMEMBER, NOT JUST TONIGHT BUT 

04:38:33.753 --> 04:38:35.753
THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, 

04:38:40.448 --> 04:38:44.883
THANK YOU. THIS IS NOT JUST 
ANOTHER ELECTION. THIS IS WELL 

04:38:45.113 --> 04:38:52.107
BEYOND OUR PARTY. THIS IS ABOUT 
ENDING AN ERA WELL ENDING AN ERA

04:38:53.481 --> 04:38:59.270
GOD WILLING OF THE PRESIDENTS --
LOOK, THIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY OF

04:38:59.483 --> 04:39:04.039
US. IT REALLY IS. WE CAN'T ALLOW
DONALD TRUMP TO BE A REELECT TO 

04:39:04.251 --> 04:39:09.232
THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENCY 
AGAIN. I AM READY TO GIVE THEM A

04:39:10.153 --> 04:39:12.153
NEW NICKNAME, THE FORMER 

04:39:15.686 --> 04:39:17.686
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

04:39:20.290 --> 04:39:22.645
AND, FOLKS, AS I SAID, IT IS 
BIGGER THAN ANY CANDIDATE AND 

04:39:22.855 --> 04:39:24.855
ANY 

04:39:27.366 --> 04:39:32.729
PARTY AND I SAID FROM THE OUTSET
AND JILL AND I SAID WE ARE IN 

04:39:32.954 --> 04:39:35.312
THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE 
NATION AND THAT IS NOT 

04:39:35.536 --> 04:39:38.147
HYPERBOLE. WE REALLY BELIEVE 
THAT AND I THINK IT HAS BEEN 

04:39:38.358 --> 04:39:40.291
DEMONSTRATED EVERY HOUR HE 
REMAINS AS PRESIDENT OF THE 

04:39:40.292 --> 04:39:42.727
UNITED STATES. EACH AND EVERY 
ONE OF US KNOWS THAT DEEPEN OUR 

04:39:42.945 --> 04:39:45.261
BONES THAT EVERYTHING THIS 
NATION STANDS FOR IS AT STAKE 

04:39:45.490 --> 04:39:48.305
AND I REALLY MEAN IT. FOUR MORE 
YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL 

04:39:48.521 --> 04:39:51.919
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE 
CHARACTER OF OUR NATION AND 

04:39:52.133 --> 04:39:54.133
CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT AND 
THAT IS WHAT 

04:39:58.286 --> 04:40:01.380
THIS IS. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES 
AMERICA AMERICA IS AT STAKE AND 

04:40:01.599 --> 04:40:03.599
LITERALLY THE DEMOCRACY IS 

04:40:07.072 --> 04:40:11.785
AT STAKE. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS HEART 

04:40:12.077 --> 04:40:19.462
OF WORK AS I HAVE. FOLKS, I LOVE
HER TO, MAN. I TELL YOU WHAT. 

04:40:19.676 --> 04:40:21.796
THE OTHER REASON WE ARE RUNNING 
AS WE WILL MAKE SURE 

04:40:25.614 --> 04:40:27.898
IT HAPPENS AND WE HAVE TO 
REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS 

04:40:28.109 --> 04:40:30.069
COUNTRY AND THE WORKING-CLASS 
AND MIDDLE-CLASS HAVE BEEN 

04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:32.070
GETTING LAID OUT BADLY BY THIS 
ADMINISTRATION AND THE MIDDLE 

04:40:32.216 --> 04:40:36.318
CLASS HAS BEEN HURT VERY BADLY 
BUT LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE

04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:38.530
TO UNIFY THIS COUNTRY AS WELL 
AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT 

04:40:40.555 --> 04:40:42.555
CEOS AND WALL STREET BANKERS 
DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA AND 

04:40:44.682 --> 04:40:51.567
ORDINARY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS 
LED BY UNIONS MADE AMERICA. AND 

04:40:51.780 --> 04:40:55.171
FOLKS, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS NOT ONLY READY TO FIGHT BUT 

04:40:55.387 --> 04:40:57.387
ALSO READY TO HEAL THIS COUNTRY 
AND WE 

04:41:01.381 --> 04:41:05.777
CAN'T HOLD DREDGES. WE HAVE TO 
BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND UNIFY THE 

04:41:05.989 --> 04:41:08.231
COUNTRY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS
SUPPOSED TO HEAL AS WELL AS 

04:41:08.450 --> 04:41:11.307
FIGHT. THAT IS EXACT THE WHAT I 
PLAN ON DOING AND WE PLAN ON 

04:41:11.519 --> 04:41:14.111
DOING AND ALL OF US IN THIS HALL
PLAN ON DOING. LADIES AND 

04:41:14.335 --> 04:41:16.691
GENTLEMEN, I WILL GO ALL OVER 
THIS COUNTRY, EVERY PART OF THE 

04:41:16.911 --> 04:41:18.911
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND 

04:41:21.324 --> 04:41:24.217
UNITE IT,  MEN AND WOMEN AND AND
STRAIGHT AND EVERYONE, BLACK AND

04:41:24.428 --> 04:41:27.824
BROWN AND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE OF 
PEOPLE OUT THERE  BECAUSE FOLKS 

04:41:29.891 --> 04:41:33.992
THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE EVER 
FEEL THAT WHEN WE TRIED TO DO IT

04:41:37.623 --> 04:41:39.651
TOGETHER. NOTHING AMERICA HAS 
EVER EVER FEEL THAT. SO, LADIES 

04:41:39.868 --> 04:41:42.222
AND GENTLEMEN, ALL OF MY 
FRIENDS, AND BY THE WAY I WANT 

04:41:42.434 --> 04:41:45.949

04:41:46.161 --> 04:41:48.161
FIREFIGHTERS. YOU HAVE BEEN 
INCREDIBLE 

04:41:51.552 --> 04:41:53.552
TO US. 

04:41:55.151 --> 04:41:58.587
BUT, FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO 
DONALD TRUMP IS. WELL, IT IS 

04:41:58.803 --> 04:42:02.023
FORTUNATE THEY DO KNOW NOW 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW LAST 

04:42:02.239 --> 04:42:06.102
TIME I DON'T. WHAT THEY KNOW 
NOW. WE HAVE TO KNOW AND LET 

04:42:06.314 --> 04:42:13.077
THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE 
HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE 

04:42:13.295 --> 04:42:18.818
SCIENCE OVER FICTION. UNITY OVER
DIVISION. AND COMPASSION 

04:42:23.341 --> 04:42:26.266
OVER CRUELTY. AND MAYBE, MOST 
IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, TRUTH

04:42:55.677 --> 04:42:57.677
JOE BIDEN

04:43:02.355 --> 04:43:04.733
SAYING ON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE JUST
LIKE SO MANY OF THE OTHER 

04:43:04.947 --> 04:43:06.969
CANDIDATES ARE TONIGHT IN YOUR 
BEEN COVERING THE FORMER VICE 

04:43:07.184 --> 04:43:09.951
PRESIDENT ON THE TRAIL IN THE 
LAST WEEK OR SO IN IOWA AND WHAT

04:43:10.165 --> 04:43:12.721
DID YOU MAKE A TONIGHT SPEECH? 
BACK I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST 

04:43:12.940 --> 04:43:15.532
ENERGETIC I HAVE SEEN THE VICE 
PRESIDENT IN A FEW DAYS. THAT TO

04:43:15.747 --> 04:43:18.410
BE FOR A FEW REASONS. IT COULD 
BE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY 

04:43:18.623 --> 04:43:21.247
DIFFERENT RALLIES THAT THEY HAVE
AND IT CAN GET TO YOU AT TIMES 

04:43:21.463 --> 04:43:23.631
AND THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER 
CONCERNS ABOUT MAYBE NOT FEEDING

04:43:23.844 --> 04:43:26.503
OFF THE CROWD AND ENERGY OF THE 
FOLKS WHO CAME TOGETHER. WHEN I 

04:43:26.718 --> 04:43:29.070
SAW HIM ONE TIME IN PARTICULAR 
IN A MORE RURAL ENVIRONMENT AND 

04:43:29.285 --> 04:43:34.123
THE CROWD WAS OLDER AND WAS NOT 
AS ENERGETIC AS THIS CROWD AND 

04:43:34.332 --> 04:43:38.611
MAYBE HE WANTS TO ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE AND LET THEM KNOW THAT 

04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:40.995
MAYBE THINGS ARE NOT BETTER 
PERFORMING THEN THE SUM OF HIS 

04:43:41.206 --> 04:43:43.206
AIDES 

04:43:44.637 --> 04:43:46.637
THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE GOING 
IN. THERE WAS SOME SUGGESTION 

04:43:46.793 --> 04:43:49.844
FROM PEOPLE CLOSE TO BIDEN 
MOVING FORWARD THAT TONIGHT 

04:43:50.056 --> 04:43:52.441
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T GOING TO WIN 
BUT HAVE A STRONG SHOWING. THIS 

04:43:55.634 --> 04:43:57.906
IS ABOUT MORALE BUILDING AT THIS
POINT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO STAY

04:43:58.117 --> 04:44:00.117
ON THE 

04:44:02.698 --> 04:44:07.018
TRAIN. 
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE HAS 

04:44:07.234 --> 04:44:09.467
PERFORMED ALTHOUGH WE WILL LEARN
MORE FROM THE ENTRANCE POLES AND

04:44:09.679 --> 04:44:12.454
OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THE DATA 
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE WAITING FOR 

04:44:12.673 --> 04:44:15.041
THE OFFICIAL PARTY RESULTS. WHAT
STOOD OUT FOR YOU IN THE SPEECH 

04:44:15.253 --> 04:44:17.288
TONIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I DO AGREE HE SEEMED MORE 

04:44:17.499 --> 04:44:20.900
ENERGIZED AND IT WAS HIS FIRST 
GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND IT COULD 

04:44:24.509 --> 04:44:26.509
ALSO BE IN THE TRENDLINE FOR 
THEM HAS NOT 

04:44:30.881 --> 04:44:35.449
BEEN GREAT AND THERE HAVE BEEN A
FEW SORT OF MISHAPS AND ONE OF 

04:44:37.572 --> 04:44:39.572
HIS CHIEF SURROGATES, 

04:44:41.361 --> 04:44:43.361
JOHN KERRY WAS OVERHEARD 
SUGGESTING MAYBE 

04:44:47.709 --> 04:44:49.709
HE SHOULD RUN FOR THE 
NOMINATION. THE SENSE WAS THIS 

04:44:49.849 --> 04:44:53.854
IS NOT TO BE A GREAT NIGHT MAYBE
FOR BIDEN AND THEY PROBABLY FEEL

04:44:54.066 --> 04:44:56.999
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THIS DELAY AND
THE 

04:45:01.836 --> 04:45:04.517
IOWA RESULTS BEING MINIMIZED IN 
TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE 

04:45:04.732 --> 04:45:07.224
POTENTIALLY. IF THAT HAPPENS IT 
FEEDS INTO THE BIDEN STRATEGY 

04:45:07.436 --> 04:45:09.573
WHICH I THINK IN GENERAL HAS 
FOCUSED ON A LONG GAME 

04:45:13.371 --> 04:45:17.496
OF GOING INTO THE SUPER TUESDAY 
STATES. AFTER THAT BUILDING UP A

04:45:17.712 --> 04:45:19.662
DELEGATE COUNT AS OPPOSED TO 
WINNING THESE EARLY STATES. 

04:45:19.663 --> 04:45:21.663
&gt;&gt; THE CAMPAIGNS ARE STRUGGLING 
OF WHAT 

04:45:26.125 --> 04:45:31.164
TO MAKE IN THE DELAY OF GETTING 
RETURNS. IF YOU ARE TUNING IN 

04:45:31.379 --> 04:45:33.511
AND FINDING OUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN IOWA, WE ARE ALL 

04:45:33.718 --> 04:45:37.168
WAITING BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY SAID THEY ARE NOT READY TO

04:45:37.393 --> 04:45:39.519
RELEASE THE DATA AND INFORMATION
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO TALLY

04:45:39.732 --> 04:45:42.099
THE RESULTS AND CONCERNS AND 
THEY ARE MAKING SURE THEY ARE 

04:45:42.311 --> 04:45:47.210
ACCURATE BEFORE THEY RELEASE 
THEM PUBLICLY SO HERE IS HOW THE

04:45:47.437 --> 04:45:49.801
BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS RESPONDING TO 
THIS AND LET'S LOOK AT THIS AND 

04:45:50.011 --> 04:45:52.148
THIS IS A LETTER OBTAINED BY THE
WASHINGTON POST FROM THE 

04:45:52.363 --> 04:45:54.363
CAMPAIGNS GENERAL COUNSEL AND 
SHE WROTE TO THE DEMOCRATIC 

04:45:55.827 --> 04:45:58.268
PARTY THIS. I WRITE ON BEHALF OF
THE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN

04:45:58.488 --> 04:46:01.626
REGARDING THE CONSIDERABLE FLAWS
IN TONIGHT'S REPORTING SYSTEM. 

04:46:01.835 --> 04:46:03.974
THE APP THAT WAS INTENDED TO 
RELAY CAUCUS RESULTS TO THE 

04:46:04.188 --> 04:46:06.188
PARTY FAILED AND THE PARTIES 
BACKUP TELEPHONIC REPORTING 

04:46:09.944 --> 04:46:12.429
SYSTEM LIKE ISIS FIELD. WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT CAUCUS CHAIRS 

04:46:12.648 --> 04:46:14.798
ARE ATTEMPTING TO AND IN MANY 
CASES FAILING TO REPORT RESULTS 

04:46:15.011 --> 04:46:18.471
TELEPHONIC TO THE PARTY AND SHE 
GOES ON TO SAY THESE ACUTE 

04:46:18.686 --> 04:46:21.611
FAILURES ARE OCCURRING STATEWIDE
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU PLAN 

04:46:21.827 --> 04:46:23.776
TO BRIEF THE CAMPAIGNS 
MOMENTARILY ON THESE ISSUES AND 

04:46:23.777 --> 04:46:25.777
WE PLAN 

04:46:27.791 --> 04:46:29.504
TO PARTICIPATE. HOWEVER, WE 
BELIEVE THE CAMPAIGNS DESERVE 

04:46:29.505 --> 04:46:31.294
FULL EXPLANATIONS AND RELEVANT 
INFORMATION REGARDING THE METHOD

04:46:31.295 --> 04:46:33.295
OF QUALITY CONTROL 

04:46:35.178 --> 04:46:36.889
YOUR EMPLOYING AND AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND BEFORE 

04:46:36.890 --> 04:46:38.890
ANY OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE 
RELEASED. AGAIN, THAT 

04:46:42.603 --> 04:46:45.807
IS FROM JOE BIDEN'S COUNSEL. 
WHAT YOU INTERPRET FROM THIS. 

04:46:46.031 --> 04:46:48.031
OBVIOUSLY CONCERN ABOUT THE 
PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE

04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:50.170
PEOPLE'S VOICES ARE 

04:46:52.199 --> 04:46:54.033
HEARD, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE OFFICE
AND DEFENSE. 

04:46:54.034 --> 04:46:56.034
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS MANAGING 
EXPECTATIONS AND CASTING DOUBT 

04:46:56.170 --> 04:46:59.288
ON THE PROCESS AND NO DOUBT JOE 
BIDEN WANTS TO MUTE THE RESULTS 

04:47:03.201 --> 04:47:05.201
OF IOWA. 

04:47:08.380 --> 04:47:13.083
AND MAYBE BOTH OF THEM LIVING 
NEXT DOOR. HE HAS SAID IN RECENT

04:47:13.297 --> 04:47:15.740
DAYS THAT IT IS UNUSUAL TO BE 
LOWERING EXPECT PATIENTS IN THE 

04:47:15.954 --> 04:47:20.505
DAYS BEFORE BUT HE HAS BEEN 
SAYING THAT CAMPAIGNING AROUND 

04:47:20.715 --> 04:47:23.283
IOWA THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL 
FOR THE FIRST EARLY STATES AND 

04:47:23.495 --> 04:47:28.268
TALKING ABOUT HIS FIREWALL AND 
TALKING ABOUT THE DIVERSITY AND 

04:47:28.485 --> 04:47:30.409
REPRESENTATION OF SOUTH CAROLINA
AND NEVADA. LOOKS LIKE THIS 

04:47:30.410 --> 04:47:35.048
LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND THAT 
SECOND PARAGRAPH HE SAID I 

04:47:35.268 --> 04:47:37.268
APPRECIATE THAT YOU WILL BRIEF 
US MOMENTARILY AND THAT'S ABOUT 

04:47:37.428 --> 04:47:39.560
CREATING A PAPER TRAIL TO SAY 
THAT WE RAISED THESE CONCERNS 

04:47:39.771 --> 04:47:41.771
AND 

04:47:44.459 --> 04:47:46.459
THEY COULD

04:47:48.573 --> 04:47:50.924
SAY THIS COULD BE USED TO CAST 
OUT TOMORROW ON WHATEVER THE 

04:47:51.138 --> 04:47:53.292
NUMBERS ARE IF THEY ARE BAD FOR 
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. 

04:47:53.293 --> 04:47:55.759
&gt;&gt; A REAL QUESTION MARK ABOUT 
PERFORMANCE AND EVEN IF WE DON'T

04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:57.970
HAVE THE RESULTS TONIGHT, 

04:47:59.943 --> 04:48:03.308
THROUGH THE ENTRANCE POLLING 
DATA AND WE SAID ENTRANCE POLES 

04:48:03.528 --> 04:48:05.749
BECAUSE IOWA DOESN'T DO EXIT 
POLLS BUT IN IOWA HERE PEOPLE 

04:48:05.963 --> 04:48:08.131
ARE CHECKING IN BEFORE PEOPLE GO
INTO CAUCUSES AND HEADING INTO 

04:48:08.343 --> 04:48:10.343
GET A READ OF HOW THEY ARE 
FEELING. 

04:48:13.315 --> 04:48:18.223
&gt;&gt; SO THE ENTRANCE POLES, AND WE
ARE REPORTING THE TOPLINE. WHERE

04:48:18.437 --> 04:48:20.590
IT IS USEFUL IS TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT ISSUES PEOPLE CARED ABOUT 

04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:23.521
HIM WHY AND WHAT MOTIVATED THOSE
PEOPLE AND ABOUT PEOPLE WHO 

04:48:23.737 --> 04:48:28.657
CARED ABOUT BEATING TRUMP 
BECAUSE IT IS AN ENTRANCE PULL 

04:48:28.871 --> 04:48:32.274
IT DISCOUNTS ALL THE PEOPLE NOT 
VIABLE IN THAT BASICALLY FIRST 

04:48:32.485 --> 04:48:34.485
OF THREE NUMBERS THEY 

04:48:37.760 --> 04:48:39.760
ARE TRACKING

04:48:44.782 --> 04:48:47.367
AND THE IRONY IS IF YOU TAKE THE
IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT ITS 

04:48:47.581 --> 04:48:49.804
WORD IS THE REASON THEY ARE 
HAVING TROUBLE IS TRYING TO 

04:48:50.017 --> 04:48:52.188
REPORT ALL THREE NUMBERS AND'S 
OF THE TWO NUMBERS THAT THEY 

04:48:52.405 --> 04:48:54.405
HAVE HISTORICALLY PUT OUT. 
&gt;&gt; REMIND US WHAT THOSE ARE. 

04:48:54.563 --> 04:48:57.630
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST ONE IS THE RAW 
TOTAL OF WHO CAME IN AND FOR HOW

04:48:57.843 --> 04:49:00.087
MANY CANDIDATES AND BODY NUMBERS
AND NUMBER TWO IS THE STATE 

04:49:00.303 --> 04:49:02.303
DELEGATE EQUIVALENT FOR HOW MANY
PEOPLE TURNED OUT IN PRECINCTS 

04:49:02.424 --> 04:49:06.608
IN THE PAST AND THAT WILL HAVE A
FEW HUNDRED OF THOSE AND THE 

04:49:06.825 --> 04:49:09.284
FINAL THIRD NUMBER IS HOW MANY 
DELEGATES THEY WILL GET IN ABOUT

04:49:09.496 --> 04:49:14.607
40 SOME ODD DELEGATES UP FOR 
GRABS AND THAT IS HOW MANY 

04:49:14.820 --> 04:49:16.749
LITERAL REPRESENTATIVES THEY 
WILL HAVE AT THE CONVENTION IN 

04:49:16.750 --> 04:49:18.960
MILWAUKEE IN JULY AND POSSIBLE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT 

04:49:19.174 --> 04:49:21.174
FIVE CANDIDATES ESPECIALLY BASED
ON THE SPEECHES, THEY COULD COME

04:49:21.346 --> 04:49:23.346
OUT WITH AT LEAST 

04:49:25.342 --> 04:49:27.342
ONE DELEGATE FROM TONIGHT. AND 
THAT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S

04:49:27.473 --> 04:49:31.095
ALSO ONE OF THE QUALIFICATION 
REQUIREMENTS NOW AND THE DNC 

04:49:31.302 --> 04:49:33.443
CHANGE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR 
THE DEBATE AND SAID IF YOU GET 

04:49:33.655 --> 04:49:36.938
ONE DELEGATE, THAT CHECKS ONE OF
THE BOXES AND THAT COULD MEAN WE

04:49:37.158 --> 04:49:39.158
HAVE 

04:49:40.975 --> 04:49:43.219
BIGGER DEBATES GOING INTO 
NEVADA. AND AGAIN NOT ONE OF THE

04:49:43.436 --> 04:49:45.142
FIELDS. BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW 
THE NUMBERS. 

04:49:45.143 --> 04:49:49.562
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE SEEN ELIZABETH WARREN
THERE  AND DOING THE 

04:49:54.399 --> 04:49:58.118
SELFIE LINE. BUT THE PERSONAL 
PHOTO OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN A 

04:49:58.330 --> 04:50:00.458
HALLMARK OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND 
YOU CAN SEE HER SUPPORTERS AND 

04:50:03.674 --> 04:50:05.681
PETE BUTTIGIEG IS ADDRESSING 
SUPPORTERS. WE WILL WATCH AS HE 

04:50:05.895 --> 04:50:09.038
WALKS INTO THIS CROWD HERE. THIS
IS BEEN AN IMPORTANT DATE 

04:50:09.262 --> 04:50:13.928
POTENTIALLY FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE 
AND LET'S GO IN TO HEAR HIM LIVE

04:50:14.147 --> 04:50:16.147
AS HE 

04:50:18.988 --> 04:50:21.492
ADDRESSES SUPPORTERS. 
&gt;&gt;

04:50:54.537 --> 04:50:58.741
THANK YOU, IOWA. THANK YOU.

04:51:36.131 --> 04:51:38.131
THANK YOU. WHAT A NIGHT.

04:51:44.044 --> 04:51:46.963
BECAUSE TONIGHT AND IMPROBABLE 
HOPE BECAME AN 

04:51:51.799 --> 04:51:53.799
UNDENIABLE REALITY.

04:52:12.571 --> 04:52:14.571
SO WE DON'T KNOW ALL 

04:52:18.439 --> 04:52:24.037
THE RESULT. BUT WE KNOW BY THE 
TIME IT IS ALL SAID AND DONE, 

04:52:24.262 --> 04:52:26.262
IOWA, YOU HAVE SHOCKED 

04:52:29.597 --> 04:52:31.597
THE NATION.

04:52:39.206 --> 04:52:43.162
BECAUSE, BY ALL INDICATIONS, WE 
ARE GOING ON TO NEW 

04:52:48.177 --> 04:52:50.177
HAMPSHIRE VICTORIOUS.

04:53:12.382 --> 04:53:14.382
ONE 

04:53:17.394 --> 04:53:19.394
YEAR AGO

04:53:25.446 --> 04:53:28.356
, IT WAS IN THE DEEP FREEZE OF 
AN IOWA JANUARY WHERE WE BEGAN 

04:53:28.569 --> 04:53:30.710
THIS UNLIKELY JOURNEY TO WIN THE
AMERICAN PRESIDENCY. WE WERE NOT

04:53:30.923 --> 04:53:33.498
WELL KNOWN, AND WE HAD A NEW 
IDEA, THE IDEA THAT IT THIS 

04:53:33.713 --> 04:53:38.347
MOMENT WHEN WASHINGTON HAS NEVER
FELT FURTHER FROM OUR EVERYDAY 

04:53:38.646 --> 04:53:43.152
LIVES, MIDDLE-CLASS MAYOR FROM 
THE AMERICAN MIDWEST COULD CARRY

04:53:43.367 --> 04:53:45.519
THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ALL THE WAY TO THE 

04:53:45.735 --> 04:53:47.735
AMERICAN CAPITAL AND MAKE SURE 
THEY ARE 

04:53:50.893 --> 04:53:52.893
ACTUALLY HEARD.

04:53:59.133 --> 04:54:01.846
WE HAD THE BELIEF THAT IN THE 
FACE OF EXHAUSTION AND THE 

04:54:02.063 --> 04:54:10.470
CYNICISMAND DIVISION, IN SPITE 
OF EVERY TRAMPLED FORM THAT 

04:54:10.686 --> 04:54:13.779
ARISING MAJORITY OF AMERICANS 
WAS HUNGRY FOR ACTION AND READY 

04:54:13.993 --> 04:54:15.993
FOR 

04:54:18.758 --> 04:54:23.746
NEW ANSWERS. WE COULD SEE AN 
AMERICAN MAJORITY RULES YEARNING

04:54:23.962 --> 04:54:27.710
FOR LEADERSHIP TO RALLY US 
TOGETHER BEHIND BOLD IDEAS TO 

04:54:27.926 --> 04:54:33.429
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. 
WE SAW THAT AMERICANS WERE READY

04:54:33.652 --> 04:54:35.652
TO COME TOGETHER BUT OUR 
POLITICS 

04:54:39.377 --> 04:54:43.585
WERE NOT. TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT 
WE NEEDED A NEW PATH FORWARD, 

04:54:43.804 --> 04:54:46.307
PAST THAT WELCOMED PEOPLE 
INSTEAD OF PUSHING THEM AWAY AND

04:54:46.522 --> 04:54:48.522
BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER INSTEAD OF
DRIVING THEM APART BECAUSE THIS 

04:54:48.701 --> 04:54:51.607
IS OUR BEST AND MAY BE OUR 

04:54:56.378 --> 04:55:02.158
LAST SHOT. WE KNEW THAT WITH 
THIS AMERICAN MAJORITY WE WERE 

04:55:02.367 --> 04:55:04.367
ON THE 

04:55:05.814 --> 04:55:08.022
CUSP OF CHANGING THE GAME FOR 
ORDINARY AMERICANS, BUT WE COULD

04:55:08.238 --> 04:55:10.238
NOT WIN 

04:55:12.347 --> 04:55:15.130
OR GOVERN IF WE WROTE PEOPLE OFF
WHO DIDN'T AGREE WITH US 100% OF

04:55:15.345 --> 04:55:18.344
THE TIME, BUT IF WE COULD COME 
TOGETHER, THE FUTURE THAT WE 

04:55:18.555 --> 04:55:21.668
KNOW IS POSSIBLE WOULD START ON 
JANUARY 

04:55:26.476 --> 04:55:28.476
21, 2021.

04:55:44.667 --> 04:55:49.725
NOW THERE WERE SKEPTIC, AN AWFUL
LOT OF SKEPTICS, WHO SAID NOT 

04:55:49.944 --> 04:55:53.852
NOW AND NOT THIS TIME AND THERE 
WAS TALK OF 

04:55:56.862 --> 04:56:01.330
BELONGING AND BRIDGING DIVIDES 
IS TOO NAÏVE AND TOO RISKY. SO 

04:56:01.552 --> 04:56:06.315
TONIGHT, I SAY WITH A HEART FULL
OF GRATITUDE, IOWA, YOU HAVE 

04:56:06.524 --> 04:56:08.524
PROVED TO THOSE 

04:56:11.657 --> 04:56:13.657
SKEPTICS WRONG.

04:56:33.992 --> 04:56:37.615
BY YOUR EFFORTS AND BY YOUR 
EFFORT

04:56:42.247 --> 04:56:43.737
WE BROUGHT TOGETHER AN 
EXTRAORDINARY COALITION OF 

04:56:43.738 --> 04:56:45.541
AMERICANS, PROGRESSIVES, 
MODERATES, AND A GOOD NUMBER OF 

04:56:45.542 --> 04:56:48.081
WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL FUTURE 

04:56:52.925 --> 04:56:54.925
FORMER REPUBLICANS.

04:56:56.848 --> 04:56:59.717
AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO

FELLOW DEMOCRATIC COMPETITORS IN
THIS DIVERSE AND FORMIDABLE 

04:59:48.276 --> 04:59:50.491
FIELD. FOR MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN 
HAVING AN HONEST AND RESPECTFUL 

04:59:50.690 --> 04:59:52.690
BUT 

04:59:53.717 --> 04:59:55.951
VIGOROUS DEBATE ABOUT THE COURSE

AMERICAN STORY. YOU CHOSE TO 
MOVE ON NOT JUST FROM THE BROKEN

05:00:30.246 --> 05:00:32.451
POLICIES OF THESE LAST TWO YEARS
BUT THE BROKEN POLITICS THAT GOT

05:00:36.703 --> 05:00:38.703
US HERE.

05:00:40.455 --> 05:00:42.657
AND TOMORROW, BECAUSE OF WHAT WE
DID HERE, THE NATION WILL HAVE 

05:00:42.866 --> 05:00:44.866
THAT CHOICE TOO. 

05:00:47.508 --> 05:00:49.759
WE TAKE OUR MESSAGE ONWARD TO 
NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH HAS A WAY 

05:00:49.959 --> 05:00:52.271
OF MAKING UP ITS OWN MIND, TO 
NEVADA TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND 

05:00:52.468 --> 05:00:54.468
BEYOND TO EVERY CORNER 

05:00:57.159 --> 05:01:04.693
OF AMERICA. AND AS WE DO, WE 
WILL BE BUILDING THE MOVEMENT 

05:01:04.891 --> 05:01:09.160
THAT NOT ONLY WILL WIN THE 
ELECTION AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, 

05:01:09.365 --> 05:01:11.365
BUT WHEN THE ERA FOR OUR 

05:01:14.658 --> 05:01:18.515
SHARED VALUES. WE HAVE EXACTLY 
ONE SHOT TO DEFEAT 

05:01:21.711 --> 05:01:23.960
DONALD TRUMP, AND WE WON'T DO IT
BY OVERREACHING OR BY DIVISION 

05:01:24.158 --> 05:01:27.337
OR DO IT BY SAYING IT IS MY WAY 
OR 

05:01:32.055 --> 05:01:35.199
THE HIGHWAY. THIS IS OUR SHOT, 
OUR ONLY SHOT TO GALVANIZE AN 

05:01:35.403 --> 05:01:39.787
AMERICAN MAJORITY TO WIN. AND 
MAKE NO MISTAKE, OURS IS THE 

05:01:39.993 --> 05:01:41.993
CAMPAIGN THAT WILL DEFEAT 

05:01:45.438 --> 05:01:47.438
THIS PRESIDENT.

05:02:03.130 --> 05:02:05.130
A PRESIDENT 

05:02:07.094 --> 05:02:09.094
WHO CUTS TAXES FOR CORPORATIONS 
WHILE CRUSHING THE RIGHTS OF 

05:02:09.104 --> 05:02:11.104
WORKERS TO 

05:02:13.985 --> 05:02:16.889
ORGANIZE OUGHT TO HAVE TO 
COMPETE WITH THE MIDDLE-CLASS 

05:02:17.091 --> 05:02:18.914
MAYOR WHO ENTERED POLITICS 
FIGHTING FOR AUTOWORKERS AND 

05:02:18.915 --> 05:02:21.750
ACTUALLY LIVES AND WORKS IN THE 
INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST. PRESIDENT 

05:02:21.949 --> 05:02:23.949
WHO 

05:02:26.861 --> 05:02:30.329
TRIES TO QUOTE HIMSELF AND HIS 
WRONGDOING AND RELIGION SHOULD 

05:02:30.532 --> 05:02:32.758
HAVE TO DEBATE A CANDIDATE NOT 
AFRAID TO REMIND AMERICA THAT 

05:02:32.958 --> 05:02:34.958
GOD DOES NOT BELONG TO A 

05:02:38.054 --> 05:02:40.054
POLITICAL PARTY.

05:02:46.613 --> 05:02:50.166
AND A PRESIDENT WHO AVOIDED 
SERVING WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN 

05:02:50.376 --> 05:02:53.142
SHOULD HAVE TO STAND NEXT TO THE
VETERAN READY TO SHOW WHAT 

05:02:55.561 --> 05:02:57.561
TROOPS DESERVE FROM A 

05:03:01.083 --> 05:03:03.083
REAL COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF

05:03:10.329 --> 05:03:15.828
THIS PRESIDENT MAY GET A PASS ON
THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE BUT THIS

05:03:16.032 --> 05:03:18.032
NOVEMBER THE VERDICT WILL BE UP 

05:03:21.511 --> 05:03:26.719
TO US AND WHEN I AM YOUR NOMINEE
WE WILL WIN BIG ENOUGH TO AND 

05:03:26.917 --> 05:03:34.248
NOT ONLY HAS PRESIDENCY BUT 
TRUMP IS HIM INTO THE DUSTBIN OF

05:03:34.448 --> 05:03:36.448
HISTORY WHERE 

05:03:38.005 --> 05:03:41.673
IT BELONGS. SOMETHING IS 
STIRRING IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW 

05:03:41.870 --> 05:03:46.924
AND YOU CAN FEEL IT. WE SAW IT 
TONIGHT AND THE BLUEST AND 

05:03:47.133 --> 05:03:51.810
REDDEST COUNTIES AND THE RURAL 
AND INDUSTRIAL CITIES AND IN BIG

05:03:52.007 --> 05:03:55.573
AND SMALL COMMUNITIES IN THE 
SUBURBS IN BETWEEN AND WE SEE 

05:03:55.777 --> 05:03:57.777
DEMOCRATS HUNGRY 

05:04:00.892 --> 05:04:03.410
TO WIN AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS 
WHO HAD BEEN TURNED OFF BY HER 

05:04:03.618 --> 05:04:06.055
POLITICS AND REPUBLICANS TIRED 
OF TRYING TO LOOK THEIR KIDS IN 

05:04:06.267 --> 05:04:10.526
THE EYE AND EXPLAIN THIS 
PRESIDENCY ALL STANDING TOGETHER

05:04:10.727 --> 05:04:14.081
AND ALL STANDING TOGETHER TO 
DECLARE THAT WE ARE DEFINED NOT 

05:04:14.280 --> 05:04:17.614
BY WHO WE VOTED FOR IN THE PAST 
BUT BY WHAT WE ARE VOTING FOR IN

05:04:22.376 --> 05:04:24.376
THE FUTURE.

05:04:32.321 --> 05:04:34.321
THIS IS THE COALITION THAT 

05:04:36.956 --> 05:04:39.184
NO PUNDITS SAW COMING AND IT IS 
THE COALITION THAT THE PRESIDENT

05:04:39.383 --> 05:04:41.383
WON'T SEE 

05:04:43.146 --> 05:04:45.325
COMING EITHER. AND IT IS A 
MAJORITY THAT WE ARE ASSEMBLING 

05:04:45.524 --> 05:04:49.167
TO AGREE NOT JUST ON WHO WE ARE 
AGAINST BUT ON WHAT WE 

05:04:53.813 --> 05:04:55.813
ARE FOR.

05:04:57.933 --> 05:04:59.933
WE ARE UNIFYING A RISING 
AMERICAN MAJORITY READY TO RAISE

05:04:59.977 --> 05:05:04.222
WAGES AND EMPOWER WORKERS IN 
THIS FAST CHANGING ECONOMY. 

05:05:04.427 --> 05:05:06.427
MAJORITY READY AND DETERMINED TO
PUT AN END TO 

05:05:11.015 --> 05:05:15.835
ENDLESS WAR. MAJORITY COMMITTED 
TO BRINGING ABOUT A DAY IN 

05:05:16.039 --> 05:05:18.789
AMERICA WHERE YOUR RACE HAS NO 
BEARING ON YOUR HEALTH OR WEALTH

05:05:18.987 --> 05:05:22.131
OR ACCESS TO EDUCATION OR YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP TO 

05:05:26.989 --> 05:05:28.989
LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:05:37.115 --> 05:05:41.443
AND A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS 
READY TO SUPPORT HER TEACHERS 

05:05:41.646 --> 05:05:43.646
AND A SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WHO
BELIEVES IN 

05:05:47.784 --> 05:05:49.784
PUBLIC EDUCATION

05:05:55.336 --> 05:05:57.336
AND THOSE AMERICANS ARE COUNTING
ON US AND THEY 

05:05:59.971 --> 05:06:02.503
CAN'T WAIT. I MET AMERICANS NOT 
EVEN YET OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE BUT 

05:06:02.711 --> 05:06:04.711
WHO KNOW THAT 

05:06:06.501 --> 05:06:08.756
WE CAN'T WIN AND AN 11-YEAR-OLD 
ASKING HOW HIS FAMILY WILL BE 

05:06:08.978 --> 05:06:10.978
ABLE TO AFFORD THE INSULIN 

05:06:14.766 --> 05:06:18.289
HE NEEDS. HE CAN'T WAIT FOR 
PRESIDENT WHO WILL MAKE SURE 

05:06:18.492 --> 05:06:20.492
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN 
UNINSURED AMERICAN OR 

05:06:24.725 --> 05:06:26.617
NON-AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION. THE
14-YEAR-OLD WHO LET ME KNOW SHE 

05:06:26.618 --> 05:06:31.125
IS ALREADY WRITTEN OUT OF WILL 
BECAUSE SHE IS TERRIFIED THE 

05:06:31.331 --> 05:06:33.582
NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL COULD BE OUR 
LAST AND CAN'T WAIT FOR 

05:06:33.793 --> 05:06:37.912
PRESIDENT WHO WILL SEE TO IT 
THAT SHE CAN WALK INTO HER 

05:06:38.115 --> 05:06:40.115
SCHOOL FREE 

05:06:42.953 --> 05:06:48.311
OF FEAR AND A 10-YEAR-OLD WHO 
LET ME KNOW HE EXPECTS TO BE 

05:06:48.514 --> 05:06:50.723
AROUND AND 2100 AND WILL LOOK 
BACK AT WHETHER WE ACTED FAST 

05:06:50.924 --> 05:06:52.924
ENOUGH TO SECURE HIS FUTURE. HE 
CAN'T WAIT 

05:06:55.666 --> 05:06:57.666
FOR PRESIDENT PREPARED TO ENLIST
EVERY AMERICAN IN THE FIGHT 

05:07:02.210 --> 05:07:08.439
FOR CLAIMANT. WE ARE RUNNING FOR
THEM. THIS CAMPAIGN IS GIVING 

05:07:08.639 --> 05:07:14.349
VOICE TO THEM, AND IT HAS ROOM 
FOR EVERYONE, BECAUSE NO MATTER 

05:07:14.549 --> 05:07:16.549
WHO YOU VOTED FOR IN 

05:07:20.065 --> 05:07:22.065
ELECTIONS PAST, AND FOR THAT 
MATTER, MATTER WHO YOU CAUCUSED 

05:07:22.162 --> 05:07:24.889
FOR TONIGHT, WE WELCOME YOU IN 
OUR CAMPAIGN AND YOU BELONG IN 

05:07:25.087 --> 05:07:27.087
THE FUTURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING 

05:07:30.748 --> 05:07:32.748
FOR AMERICA.

05:07:46.544 --> 05:07:49.842
WHETHER YOU ARE A YOUNG WOMAN 
WITH AUTISM OR A VETERAN 

05:07:50.046 --> 05:07:52.046
BATTLING ADDICTION IN CLAREMONT,

05:07:56.021 --> 05:07:59.429
YOU BELONG. AND WHETHER YOU 
CLEAN HOTEL ROOMS IN LAS VEGAS 

05:07:59.639 --> 05:08:01.654
OR ARE GETTING A NEW BUSINESS UP
AND RUNNING IN CHARLESTON 

05:08:05.449 --> 05:08:07.449
YOU BELONG. I BELIEVE THE 
PRESIDENCY HAS 

05:08:11.116 --> 05:08:13.403
A PURPOSE AND THE PURPOSE OF OUR
AMERICAN PRESIDENCY IS NOT THE 

05:08:13.609 --> 05:08:16.186
GLORIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT 
BUT THE UNIFICATION AND THE 

05:08:16.398 --> 05:08:18.398
EMPOWERMENT TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO 

05:08:22.984 --> 05:08:26.668
SOLVE THIS. AMERICA HAS A PLACE 

05:08:31.581 --> 05:08:33.581
FOR EVERYONE

05:08:35.864 --> 05:08:38.365
. I BELIEVE THIS NOT BECAUSE OF 
MY AGE BUT BECAUSE OF MY 

05:08:38.564 --> 05:08:40.382
EXPERIENCE. I BELIEVE IN 
AMERICAN UNITY BECAUSE OF MY 

05:08:40.383 --> 05:08:44.122
EXPERIENCE SERVING AND OF LACING
UP MY BOOTH IN THE DUST OF A WAR

05:08:44.323 --> 05:08:46.323
ZONE ALONGSIDE AMERICAN SO 
DIFFERENT WE HARDLY HAD ANYTHING

05:08:48.248 --> 05:08:50.573
IN COMMON BESIDES THE FLAG ON 
OUR SHOULDERS BUT LEARN TO TRUST

05:08:50.778 --> 05:08:52.778
EACH OTHER WITH 

05:08:54.951 --> 05:08:56.951
OUR LIVES. 

05:09:00.128 --> 05:09:02.871
I BELIEVE IN AMERICAN BOLDNESS 
BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE 

05:09:03.073 --> 05:09:07.088
GOVERNING AND GUIDING THE CITY 
ONCE CALLED DYING OUT OF THE 

05:09:07.290 --> 05:09:09.290
SHADOWS OF OUR EMPTY FACTORIES 
AND INTO A 

05:09:13.366 --> 05:09:17.556
BRIGHTER FUTURE. AND I BELIEVE 
IN AMERICAN BELONG IN BECAUSE OF

05:09:17.980 --> 05:09:21.157
AN EXPERIENCE YOU ARE PART OF 
RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. LOOKING OUT

TEENAGER WONDERING IF HE WOULD 
EVER BELONG IN THIS WORLD. 

05:09:32.179 --> 05:09:34.179
WONDERING IF SOMETHING DEEP 
INSIDE OF HIM MEANT THAT HE 

05:09:34.225 --> 05:09:38.773
WOULD FOREVER BE AN OUTSIDER 
THAT HE MAY NEVER WEAR THE 

05:09:38.974 --> 05:09:40.974
UNIFORM OR NEVER BE ACCEPTED OR 
NEVER EVEN 

05:09:45.150 --> 05:09:47.150

&gt;&gt; PETE BUTTIGIEG DECLARING 
VICTORY IN IOWA TONIGHT 

05:11:28.604 --> 05:11:30.604
EVEN THOUGH PRECINCTS HAVE NOT 
REPORTED IN FOR MORE EXPLANATION

05:11:30.759 --> 05:11:34.951
OF WHAT IS GOING ON, IT SOUNDS 
LIKE PETE BUTTIGIEG GAVE HIS 

05:11:35.151 --> 05:11:38.898
VICTORY SPEECH AND I THINK THE 
CANDIDATES ARE LIKE LET'S OKAY 

05:11:39.095 --> 05:11:43.514
LET'S DO BETTER NEXT TIME SPEECH
BUT THERE IS NO SPEECH IN THE 

05:11:43.717 --> 05:11:45.110
TOOLKIT FOR WHAT THE HECK JUST 
HAPPENED. 

05:11:45.111 --> 05:11:50.032
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE SPEECH THAT HAD 
BEEN PREWRITTEN AND IT WAS 

05:11:50.241 --> 05:11:52.241
MEDIAN SUBSTITUTE AND HISTORY 
WILL NUMBER THAT. IF HE 

05:11:56.453 --> 05:12:00.881
ENDS UP WINNING FOR SOME REASON 
WHEN ALL THE RESULTS COME IN, IT

05:12:01.079 --> 05:12:03.079
WILL BE VALIDATED. IF RIVER 
REASON HE FALL SHORTER FINISHES 

05:12:03.096 --> 05:12:05.099
SECOND OR THIRD, THAT WILL BE 
WIDELY MOCKED AND THE HOWARD 

05:12:05.297 --> 05:12:08.948
DEAN SPEECH OF OUR TIME, TO 
STAND UP AND GIVE AN ALL-OUT 

05:12:09.148 --> 05:12:12.504
DECLARATION OF VICTORY. BUT HE 
PUT A LOT OF HIS EGGS ON THE 

05:12:13.289 --> 05:12:15.289
IOWA BASKET AND HE NEEDS 
MOMENTUM COMING OUT 

05:12:19.500 --> 05:12:23.352
OF HERE TO RAISE MONEY AND TO 
KEEP THINGS GOING AND CONTINUE 

05:12:23.556 --> 05:12:25.604
TO MAKE INROADS IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA. SO IT IS SORT OF 

05:12:25.809 --> 05:12:27.809
UNDERSTANDABLE WHAT IS CALCULUS 
IS THERE AND BERNIE SANDERS THAT

05:12:27.821 --> 05:12:30.517
I ALSO FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT THE 
NUMBERS SAY AND I THINK WE WILL 

05:12:30.717 --> 05:12:34.656
COME OUT ON TOP, BUT PETE 
BUTTIGIEG DECLARING VICTORY. AND

05:12:34.854 --> 05:12:37.859
MAYBE IT IS BASED ON SOMETHING 
AT THE ENTRANCE POLES THAT ARE 

05:12:38.069 --> 05:12:40.069
PUBLIC THAT SHOW PETE BUTTIGIEG 
DID 

05:12:43.188 --> 05:12:45.310
QUITE WELL AS EVERYONE SECOND 
CHOICE BECAUSE HE WAS SORT OF 

05:12:45.509 --> 05:12:47.573
THE SILVER MEDALIST AS OUR 
COLLEAGUE PUT IT IN A POST 

05:12:47.770 --> 05:12:50.329
REVIEWING THE DATA WHICH 

05:12:55.248 --> 05:12:57.248
WAS, LIBERALS

05:13:00.375 --> 05:13:02.655
SAW HIM AS THE SECOND CHOICE AND
MODERATES SAW HIM AS THEIR 

05:13:02.870 --> 05:13:05.744
SECOND CHOICE AND THAT IS NOT A 
BAD PLACE TO BE RIGHT NOW IN A 

05:13:05.962 --> 05:13:07.990
FIELD OF FIVE OR SIX SERIOUS 
CONTENDERS TO BE AND EVERYONE 

05:13:08.190 --> 05:13:10.001
SECOND CHOICE CANDIDATE. 
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE LIKE THREE TICKETS 

05:13:10.002 --> 05:13:11.678
OUT OF IOWA EVERYBODY HAS A 
TICKET TONIGHT. 

05:13:11.679 --> 05:13:14.120
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT IF THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH

05:13:14.322 --> 05:13:16.400
THE SECOND BALLOT OR THE 
REALIGNMENT, IT REALLY WON'T 

05:13:16.603 --> 05:13:18.603
PLAY 

05:13:21.545 --> 05:13:24.012
THE FIELD. THIS NEW HAMPSHIRE 
THING WILL END UP PLAYING THAT 

05:13:24.213 --> 05:13:29.450
ROLE IN EIGHT DAYS TIME. I THINK
IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY THAT 

05:13:29.653 --> 05:13:31.893
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO COMPETE 
IN IOWA AT THIS TIME BECAUSE 

05:13:32.100 --> 05:13:34.107
PEOPLE HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO 
COMPETE IN IOWA BUT THIS IS 

05:13:34.303 --> 05:13:35.724
DEFINITELY GOING TO UNDERMINE 
THE STATE'S CREDIBILITY. 

05:13:35.725 --> 05:13:38.034
&gt;&gt; BEFORE HE TALKED ABOUT THE 
OVERALL NIGHT, I WANT YOU TO 

05:13:38.241 --> 05:13:40.241
REACT ABOUT THE 

05:13:43.378 --> 05:13:46.551
BUDDHA JUDGE, PETE BUTTIGIEG 
SPEECH. 

05:13:46.552 --> 05:13:48.552
&gt;&gt; IT WAS INSPIRING BUT 
CONFUSING BECAUSE IT WAS NOT 

05:13:48.650 --> 05:13:51.807
CLEAR WHAT HE WAS CITING AS 
BEING THE SOURCE OF HIS VICTORY.

05:13:52.011 --> 05:13:54.011
SO I THINK 

05:13:57.614 --> 05:13:59.526
THE REACTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, 
ESPECIALLY FROM PEOPLE OUTSIDE 

05:13:59.527 --> 05:14:01.527
OF HIS CAMP WERE UPSET AND JUST 

05:14:05.346 --> 05:14:07.346
MOCKING HIM, AND IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHEN 

05:14:07.382 --> 05:14:09.382
EVERYTHING IS SAID 

05:14:12.419 --> 05:14:15.573
AND DONE, WHAT IT WAS THAT HE 
WAS SAYING SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE 

05:14:15.781 --> 05:14:18.004
I TRUST HIS CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING 
AT SOMETHING THAT LED HIM TO 

05:14:18.204 --> 05:14:20.843
RESPOND THE WAY THAT HE DID AND 
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US RIGHT NOW 

05:14:21.055 --> 05:14:23.563
WHAT IT IS. WHEN EVERYTHING IS 
SAID AND DONE, IT COULD BE VERY 

05:14:23.764 --> 05:14:25.981
POSSIBLE THAT HE IS RIGHT, BUT 
IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT HIS 

05:14:26.196 --> 05:14:28.196
SPEECH PERHAPS WAS 

05:14:30.644 --> 05:14:32.672
WRITTEN WITHOUT FOR KNOWLEDGE OF
HOW EVERYTHING PANNED OUT 

05:14:32.871 --> 05:14:34.563
TONIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; I GUESS THE QUESTION IS ONCE 

05:14:34.564 --> 05:14:37.202
WE DO KNOW THE RESULTS BACK AND 
THEY SAY IF THEY COME IN NOT 

05:14:37.401 --> 05:14:39.603
FIRST BUT SOMEWHERE IN THAT TOP 
THREE, THAT IS VICTORY FOR US 

05:14:39.805 --> 05:14:42.017
BECAUSE WE CAME IN AS THE 
UNDERDOG AND A MAYOR FROM SOUTH 

05:14:45.921 --> 05:14:49.072
BEND AND THIS IS THE QUOTE 
UNQUOTE VICTORY. THE METRIC IS 

05:14:49.272 --> 05:14:51.272
DEBATABLE. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS TRUE. 

05:14:55.049 --> 05:14:58.713
WHEN EVERYTHING IS RELEASED AND 
MADE PUBLIC, IF THEY DO SAY PAST

05:14:58.909 --> 05:15:00.909
THAT SUGGESTED THEY WERE 
VICTORIOUS, THEY WILL POINT TO 

05:15:01.729 --> 05:15:02.931
IT. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? 

05:15:02.932 --> 05:15:04.963
&gt;&gt; ELECTIONS WITHOUT RESULTS, 
LIKE WE JUST HAD OUR GREAT. IT 

05:15:07.734 --> 05:15:09.639
IS LIKE CHILDREN'S SPORTS. 
EVERYBODY GETS A TROPHY AND 

05:15:09.640 --> 05:15:12.475
EVERYBODY TONIGHT GOT A TROPHY 
AND EVERYBODY TONIGHT CLAIMED 

05:15:12.674 --> 05:15:16.449
WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO CLAIM, 
AND THEY ARE RIGHT TO DO IT, I 

05:15:16.655 --> 05:15:18.795
THINK, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, 
EVERY MINUTE THAT 

05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:24.350
PASSED TONIGHT THE RESULTS OF 
IOWA BECAME LESS AND LESS 

05:15:24.377 --> 05:15:26.377
IMPORTANT AND PEOPLE OF 

05:15:29.597 --> 05:15:33.083
TUNED OUT NOW AND PEOPLE ARE NOT
PAYING ATTENTION AND TOMORROW 

05:15:33.287 --> 05:15:35.309
YOU OF THE STATE OF THE UNION 
AND IMPEACHMENT COMING AFTER 

05:15:35.527 --> 05:15:37.757
THAT IN THE FIRST CONTEST THIS 
YEAR IS FRANKLY NEW HAMPSHIRE AT

05:15:37.960 --> 05:15:40.267
THIS POINT. WE WILL GET RESULTS 
AND WE WILL TRY AND COMPARE 

05:15:40.469 --> 05:15:42.469
THOSE RESULTS TO THE DIFFERENT 
STORIES THAT 

05:15:45.923 --> 05:15:49.828
EVERYBODY HAD, BUT IN THE END, I
THINK THE RESULTS FROM IOWA ARE 

05:15:50.029 --> 05:15:52.029
NOT GOING TO BE 

05:15:54.145 --> 05:15:56.145
THAT IMPORTANT. AND NOW YOU SEE 
ALL OF THESE CANDIDATES 

05:15:56.206 --> 05:15:58.038
BASICALLY TURNING TOWARD NEW 
HAMPSHIRE AND NEVADA AND SOUTH 

05:15:58.039 --> 05:16:00.039
CAROLINA. AND LET'S REMEMBER, 

05:16:02.939 --> 05:16:04.939
IF IOWA

05:16:09.621 --> 05:16:11.848
DOESN'T MATTER EXCEPT FOR THE 
FACT THAT IT IS FIRST AND EXCEPT

05:16:12.049 --> 05:16:14.348
FOR THE FACT THAT IT CREATES 
THIS MOMENTUM AND ALL FOR THE 

05:16:14.545 --> 05:16:16.789
STATES ARE ONLY PRODUCING LESS 
THAN 4% OF THE DELEGATES IN THIS

05:16:18.206 --> 05:16:20.654
CONTEST. SO IT IS REALLY NOT AT 
ALL THE CASE THAT THESE RESULTS 

05:16:20.857 --> 05:16:23.062
WHEN THEY COME OUT, IF THEY ARE 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY 

05:16:23.266 --> 05:16:26.575
SOMEBODY PRESENTED THEM ON 
ELECTION NIGHT, THEY WILL BE 

05:16:26.773 --> 05:16:28.773
TAKEN PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY. I 
THINK FRANKLY AGAIN WHAT I SAID 

05:16:28.821 --> 05:16:30.821
BEFORE AND I THINK YOU ARE 

05:16:33.165 --> 05:16:35.702
RIGHT TOO, JAMES, THAT BLOOMBERG
I THINK IS A WINNER OUT OF THIS 

05:16:35.903 --> 05:16:38.602
IN THE CLOSER WE GET TO THE 
SUPER TUESDAY STATES WITHOUT A 

05:16:38.803 --> 05:16:41.159
CLEAR WINNER AND WITHOUT THE 
PARTY HAVING A SENSE OF WHO IS 

05:16:41.362 --> 05:16:44.075
THE ALTERNATIVE LET'S SAY TO 
BERNIE SANDERS OR 

05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:49.090
JOE BIDEN, WHICH CANDIDATES ARE 

05:16:52.578 --> 05:16:54.693
DOING WELL AND RESONATING WITH 
VOTERS. THE LONGER WE GO INTO 

05:16:54.903 --> 05:16:56.930
THAT, THE BETTER THAT IS FOR 
SOMEBODY LIKE BLOOMBERG WHO IS 

05:16:57.134 --> 05:16:59.743
SORT OF WAITING THERE HOPING 
THAT JOE BIDEN DOES NOT DO 

05:17:02.733 --> 05:17:05.998
PARTICULARLY WELL, AND THE 
WINNER BEYOND THAT IS DONALD 

05:17:06.200 --> 05:17:09.852
TRUMP AND THIS MAY VERY WELL BE 
THE THING THAT PUSHES US WHAT WE

05:17:10.051 --> 05:17:12.495
MAY HAVE HAD ANYWAY, BUT THIS 
MAY BE MAKE IT MORE LIKELY A 

05:17:12.699 --> 05:17:16.424
VERY LONG AND DRAWN OUT PROCESS 
WERE A LOT 

05:17:21.131 --> 05:17:23.750
OF PEOPLE BUILD UP A LOT OF 
DELEGATES AND STAY IN THE RACE 

05:17:23.952 --> 05:17:26.503
FOR A VERY LONG TIME. 
&gt;&gt; EUGENE, AS WE LOOK AT WINNERS

05:17:26.698 --> 05:17:30.488
AND LOSERS, BUT STILL PART OF 
THE POLITICAL CONVERSATION, REAL

05:17:30.689 --> 05:17:34.960
CONCERNS ABOUT THE IOWA 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TONIGHT, BUT IS

05:17:35.163 --> 05:17:38.202
IOWA A BIT OF A LOSER BECAUSE 
THERE HAS BEEN THIS QUESTION 

05:17:38.411 --> 05:17:41.258
MIKE JULIAN CASTRO RAISED IS HOW
REFLECTIVE IS IOWA OR RELEVANT 

05:17:41.464 --> 05:17:43.464
TO 

05:17:46.395 --> 05:17:48.395
THE NATIONAL

05:17:51.706 --> 05:17:53.344
DEMOCRAT OR PEOPLE WHO LIVE 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

05:17:53.345 --> 05:17:55.976
&gt;&gt; HE TWEETED TONIGHT DURING ALL
OF THIS AND SAID THIS IS A MESS 

05:17:56.174 --> 05:17:58.712
AND IT IS CONFUSING AND NOT 
REALLY CLEAR TO A LOT OF FOLKS. 

05:17:58.915 --> 05:18:00.947
I THINK PEOPLE ARE LEFT ASKING 
THEMSELVES WHY DID THE CAUCUS 

05:18:01.149 --> 05:18:03.359
NEED TO HAPPEN AND WHAT ARE 
THESE NEW RULES AND ARE THEY 

05:18:03.562 --> 05:18:05.579
EFFECT LIVE AND THEY WORK IN THE
BEST INTEREST OF EVERYONE 

05:18:05.781 --> 05:18:09.704
INVOLVED. I THINK IOWA HAS PUT 
ITSELF IN A POSITION WHERE IT 

05:18:09.905 --> 05:18:12.572
HAS TO MAKE A CASE FOR ITSELF 
AGAIN AFTER A NIGHT THAT DID NOT

05:18:12.768 --> 05:18:14.768
FINISH THE WAY THEY HOPED 

05:18:17.693 --> 05:18:21.382
IT WOULD AND THEY MAY NOT BE 
ABLE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THE NEXT

05:18:21.583 --> 05:18:23.007
TIME THAT THIS IS THE BEST 
OPTION. 

05:18:23.008 --> 05:18:25.241
&gt;&gt; THE FINAL THOUGHT FOR ME 
TONIGHT BECAUSE WE WILL WRAP UP 

05:18:25.444 --> 05:18:27.719
DESPITE THE FACT WE HAVE NO 
RESULTS TO REPORT AND WE WILL 

05:18:27.919 --> 05:18:30.041
CALL IT A NIGHT PRETTY SOON. 
WHAT ARE YOUR FINAL THOUGHTS? 

05:18:30.252 --> 05:18:32.889
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING INTO THE NEXT 
DAY WITH A LOT OF THE SAME 

05:18:33.094 --> 05:18:38.459
QUESTIONS. WE HAD STARTING THE 
SHOW UNANSWERED THE SAME THINGS.

05:18:38.680 --> 05:18:40.892
I WILL SAY SOME OF THE PEOPLE 
WERE FEARING THAT THINGS COULD 

05:18:41.095 --> 05:18:43.095
BE CLOSE TO 

05:18:45.506 --> 05:18:47.955
OVER TONIGHT AND CLEARLY THAT IS
NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR THEM AND 

05:18:48.166 --> 05:18:49.877
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEW 
HAMPSHIRE. 

05:18:49.878 --> 05:18:51.878
&gt;&gt; FINAL THOUGHTS? 
&gt;&gt; I 

05:18:54.103 --> 05:18:56.103
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WILL 
CHEAPEN THE IOWA CAUCUS GOING 

05:18:56.153 --> 05:18:58.583
FORWARD. I SUSPECT THAT IS NOT 
THE CASE AND CANDIDATES IF IT IS

05:18:58.902 --> 05:19:02.574
THE FIRST CAUCUS CANDIDATES WILL
SORT OF COME HERE AND MAKE THEIR

05:19:02.789 --> 05:19:06.821
PITCH AND HOPE THEY WILL PULL A 
JIMMY CARTER BY APPEARING OUT OF

05:19:07.025 --> 05:19:10.981
NOWHERE AND ENDING UP WINNING 
THE NOMINATION, BUT I DO THINK 

05:19:11.178 --> 05:19:17.989
THIS IS LIKELY BAD FOR THE HOPES
OF QUICK UNITY IN THE DEMOCRATIC

05:19:18.197 --> 05:19:21.120
PARTY. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING 
VERY MUCH THREATENED 

05:19:26.093 --> 05:19:28.701
RIGHT NOW. AND TONIGHT'S LACK OF
RESULTS CERTAINLY HAVE NOT 

05:19:28.906 --> 05:19:33.057
PUSHED US AND A DIRECTION THAT 
WILL LEAD TO THAT UNITY. 

05:19:33.058 --> 05:19:36.435
&gt;&gt; ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS SHORT 
MEMORIES VERSUS LONG MEMORIES IN

05:19:36.645 --> 05:19:40.933
THE LAST CAUCUS HAD TO REAL 
CONTENDERS AND THREE TECHNICALLY

05:19:41.143 --> 05:19:44.898
BUT THE LAST REPUBLICAN CAUCUS 
WITH THE LAST REPUBLICAN CONTEST

05:19:45.098 --> 05:19:47.098
WAS IT TOOK 

05:19:49.959 --> 05:19:52.806
A WHILE AND IT WASN'T WHO WAS 
GOING TO COME OUT ON TOP BUT IT 

05:19:53.009 --> 05:19:55.009
TOOK MANY STATES AND MANY 
PRIMARIES TO GET TO SOMEWHERE. 

05:19:55.177 --> 05:19:57.177
ARE WE EXPECTING TOO MUCH 

05:20:00.130 --> 05:20:02.025
TOO SOON. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE A 

05:20:02.026 --> 05:20:04.026
LOT OF STATES HAVE FRONTLOADED 
THEIR PRIMARIES TO SUPER TUESDAY

05:20:04.086 --> 05:20:08.058
AND THE POOR STATES ARE THE 
WINNERS OF THE FIELD AND THE 

05:20:08.257 --> 05:20:12.049
REALITY OF WHAT YOU EXPLAIN AND 
2016 WAS DOWN AND THE MAJORITY 

05:20:12.260 --> 05:20:14.295
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DIDN'T 
WANT TRUMP TO BE THE NOMINEE 

05:20:14.579 --> 05:20:16.579
UNTIL HE WAS AND UNTIL AFTER 

05:20:20.576 --> 05:20:23.265
HE WAS, BUT THEY COULDN'T AGREE 
WHETHER IT SHOULD BE JOHN KASICH

05:20:23.467 --> 05:20:25.467
OR RUBIO OR TED CRUZ TO STOP HIM
BECAUSE THE 

05:20:29.488 --> 05:20:31.543
FIRST STATES DIDN'T MOVE IN THE 
FIELD AND TRUMP WAS UNSTOPPABLE 

05:20:31.754 --> 05:20:33.810
AND HE ACCUMULATED DELEGATES AND
YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION HERE 

05:20:34.649 --> 05:20:36.649
OR BLOOMBERG -- 

05:20:39.999 --> 05:20:42.600
I BET TONIGHT WILL PROMPT 
BLOOMBERG TO SPEND $100 MILLION 

05:20:42.798 --> 05:20:45.321
MORE ON TV ADS THAT HE IS 
ALREADY SPENDING. I THINK IF THE

05:20:45.522 --> 05:20:50.186
FIRST FOUR STATES DON'T WINDOW 
IT IT INCREASES THE ODDS AND 

05:20:50.389 --> 05:20:52.436
MAYBE TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL 
HAVE CLEAR RESULTS AND IT WILL 

05:20:52.635 --> 05:20:56.543
HAVE A BIG IMPACT, BUT TONIGHT, 
UNQUESTIONABLY IT RAISES THE 

05:20:56.744 --> 05:20:58.744
ODDS OF WHATEVER THOSE ODDS 

05:21:01.977 --> 05:21:04.040
ARE OF GOING INTO THE MILWAUKEE 
CONVENTION IN JULY NOT KNOWING 

05:21:04.246 --> 05:21:08.226
FOR SURE WHO THE NOMINEE IS. IT 
MEANS SOMEONE GOT REALLY 

05:21:11.773 --> 05:21:13.992
HARMED TONIGHT. AND WE WON'T 
KNOW FOR A WHILE WHO THAT PERSON

05:21:14.194 --> 05:21:18.231
IS AND IF AMY KLOBUCHAR DID 
REALLY WELL AND COULD HAVE HAD A

05:21:18.472 --> 05:21:20.472
REAL MOMENT, SHE WAS 

05:21:24.005 --> 05:21:29.218
DENIED THAT. IF JOE BIDEN DID 
VERY POORLY, HE WAS KIND OF 

05:21:29.423 --> 05:21:31.855
SAVED AND OF PETE BUTTIGIEG -- 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT 

05:21:32.058 --> 05:21:34.268
WE WON'T KNOW AND WE GET THE 
RESULTS, BUT SOMEBODY WAS DENIED

05:21:34.481 --> 05:21:37.872
THERE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY 
CLAIM THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT AND

05:21:38.073 --> 05:21:40.073
IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR THE 

05:21:42.020 --> 05:21:44.020
PROCESS BECAUSE THEY SPEND $40 
MILLION ON TELEVISION ADS IN 

05:21:44.049 --> 05:21:49.167
IOWA AND A YEAR CAMPAIGNING AND 
THEN SOMEBODY ONE BUT TO NOT BE 

05:21:49.373 --> 05:21:51.373
ABLE TO TAKE THAT 

05:21:53.370 --> 05:21:55.370
VICTORY LAP, FOR ANY OF THEM, 
WOULD BE DEEPLY FRUSTRATING. 

05:21:55.425 --> 05:21:58.073
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF 
YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT AND 

05:21:58.278 --> 05:22:02.433
JAMES AND EUGENE AND ALEX THANK 
YOU FOR BEING HERE AS WELL AND 

05:22:02.640 --> 05:22:04.640
THANK YOU FOR JOINING 

05:22:07.114 --> 05:22:09.433
US ON WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A 
FRUSTRATING AND CONFUSING CAUCUS

05:22:09.635 --> 05:22:11.432
NIGHT AND INSTEAD OF RESULTS THE
HEADLINE IS THIS, 

05:22:11.433 --> 05:22:13.433
INCONSISTENCIES AND INSTEAD OF 
COUNTING A WINNER, THE IOWA 

05:22:16.565 --> 05:22:18.565
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ENDS THE NIGHT
