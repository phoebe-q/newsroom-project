00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:33.184
MEETING WITH THE NEW UKRAINIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR ZELENSKY  

00:44:33.185 --> 00:44:34.789
WITH EXCHANGE FOR POLITICAL 
MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS THAT 

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:38.257
TRUMP BELIEVED WOULD HELP HIS 
CAMPAIGN. THE FIRST 

00:44:38.459 --> 00:44:41.284
INVESTIGATION WAS OF A 
DISCREDITED CONSPIRACY THEORY 

00:44:41.487 --> 00:44:43.487
THAT UKRAINE, 

00:44:45.538 --> 00:44:48.391
NOT RUSSIA, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
INTERFERING IN THE 2016 

00:44:48.597 --> 00:44:52.861
ELECTION. SECOND INVESTIGATION 
TRUMP DEMANDED WAS INTO A 

00:44:55.297 --> 00:44:57.123
POLITICAL RIVAL THAT HE 
APPARENTLY FEARED MOST, JOE 

00:44:57.124 --> 00:44:59.124
BIDEN. TRUMP SOUGHT TO 

00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:04.446
WEAKEN BIDEN AND THAT HIS OWN 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN 2016 HAS 

00:45:04.653 --> 00:45:06.653
BEEN HELPED BY RUSSIAN HACKING 
AND 

00:45:09.308 --> 00:45:10.961
DUMPING OPERATION AND THE 
CAMPAIGN DIRECTED BY VLADIMIR 

00:45:10.962 --> 00:45:14.394
PUTIN TO HELP. TRUMP'S SCHEME 

00:45:18.854 --> 00:45:20.615
UNDERMINED MILITARY SUPPORT FOR 
AN ALLY AND ANTICORRUPTION 

00:45:20.616 --> 00:45:22.616
EFFORTS 

00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:26.003
IN UKRAINE. HE PUT HIS PERSONAL 
LITTLE INTEREST ABOVE THOSE OF 

00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:30.755
THE UNITED STATES. AS AMBASSADOR
SONDLAND WOULD TELL DAVID HOLMES

00:45:30.957 --> 00:45:32.957
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SPEAKING TO 
THE PRESIDENT , TRUMP SHOULD NOT

00:45:33.081 --> 00:45:38.570
GIVE AN EXPLETIVE ABOUT UKRAINE.
HE CARES ABOUT BIG STUFF THAT 

00:45:41.397 --> 00:45:43.397
BENEFITS HIM, LIKE THE BIDEN 
INVESTIGATIONS THE RUDY GIULIANI

00:45:43.846 --> 00:45:47.100
WAS PUSHING. INVESTOR SONDLAND  
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND  WAS 

00:45:50.334 --> 00:45:52.302
A SKILLED BUT FOUND HIMSELF 
INCREASINGLY EMBROILED IN AN 

00:45:52.303 --> 00:45:54.420
EFFORT TO IMPRESS THE YOU THE 
NEW UKRAINIAN 

00:45:57.852 --> 00:45:59.904
PRESIDENT THAT DEVIATED SHARPLY 
FROM THE NORM IN TERMS OF POLICY

00:46:00.705 --> 00:46:02.487

AND SPOKE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

00:46:20.706 --> 00:46:22.706
WHO 

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.425
CONGRATULATED HIM AND SAID HE 
WOULD LOOK INTO ATTENDING 

00:46:26.426 --> 00:46:29.571
ZELENSKY'S INAUGURATION  BUT 
PLEDGED TO SEND SOMEONE A VERY,

VERY HIGH LEVEL. BETWEEN THE 
TIME OF THAT CALL ON THE 

00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:37.867
INAUGURAL ON MAY 20th, TRUMP'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS UKRAINE 

00:46:38.081 --> 00:46:41.951
HARDENED. ON MAY 13th THE 
PRESIDENT ORDERED VICE PRESIDENT

00:46:42.174 --> 00:46:44.780

URGE THE PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH 
ZELENSKY  BUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

00:47:09.907 --> 00:47:15.255
REACTION WAS DECIDEDLY HOSTILE.

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:08.579
ADDRESS THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONCERNS. WE CHOSE THE

FOR RUDY GIULIANI TO BE SOMEHOW 

00:49:00.087 --> 00:49:02.543

JUNE 27th, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
CALLED TAYLOR TO SAY THAT 

00:49:10.086 --> 00:49:13.231
ZELENSKY NEEDED TO MAKE CLEAR TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP  THAT HE WAS NOT

00:49:13.443 --> 00:49:15.533
STANDING IN THE WAY OF 
INVESTIGATIONS. ON 

00:49:20.388 --> 00:49:22.388
JULY 10th, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND

THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING SOUGHT 
BY THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WITH 

00:49:33.322 --> 00:49:35.322
TRUMP WOULD HAPPEN ONLY IF 
UKRAINE UNDERTOOK 

00:49:39.282 --> 00:49:40.764
CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS. NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR BOLTON ABRUPTLY

00:49:40.765 --> 00:49:45.168
ENDED THE MEETING UPON HEARING 
THIS. UNDETERRED, HE BROUGHT THE

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.485
DELEGATION DOWNSTAIRS TO ANOTHER
PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND WAS 

00:49:47.804 --> 00:49:49.859
MORE EXPLICIT. ACCORDING TO 
WITNESSES UKRAINE NEEDED TO 

00:49:50.073 --> 00:49:54.324
INVESTIGATE THE BIDEN'S OR 
BURISMA  IF THEY WANTED TO GET A

00:49:54.537 --> 00:49:56.537
MEETING 

00:49:57.762 --> 00:50:00.624

00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:11.273
ON THIS. SONDLAND CONTINUED TO 
PRESS FOR A MEETING THAT HE AND 

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.825
OTHERS WERE WILLING TO SETTLE 
FOR A PHONE CALL . ON JULY 21, 

00:50:15.037 --> 00:50:17.893
BUT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IS 
SENSITIVE ABOUT UKRAINE BEING 

00:50:18.684 --> 00:50:21.951
TAKEN SERIOUSLY NOT MERELY AS AN
INSTRUMENT OF WASHINGTON 

00:50:24.573 --> 00:50:28.067
DOMESTIC REELECTIONS. SONDLAND 
RESPONDED ABSOLUTELY.  BUT WE 

00:50:28.274 --> 00:50:31.894
NEED TO GET THE CONVERSATION 
STARTED AND THE RELATIONSHIP 

00:50:32.105 --> 00:50:35.276
BUILT PERSPECTIVE OF THE 
PRETEXT. SO THAT ZELENSKY AND 

00:50:35.487 --> 00:50:41.431
TRUMP COULD MEET , AND ALL OF 
THIS WILL BE FIXED. ON JULY 

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:44.295
25th, THE DAY OF THE 
TRUMP-ZELINSKI CALL,  SONDLAND 

00:50:44.504 --> 00:50:46.504

GIVE  WITH THE AID TO PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND LATER TEXTED THE 

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:54.435
AID TO SAY HE HAD HEARD FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE. ASSUMING PRESIDENT 

00:50:59.105 --> 00:51:01.744
C WOULD WE WOULD NAIL DOWN A 
DATE FOR A VISIT TO WASHINGTON, 

00:51:06.007 --> 00:51:08.007
GOOD LUCK. AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
SPOKE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP A FEW 

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:10.752
MINUTES BEFORE THE CALL WAS 
PLACED  WAS NOT ON THE CALL. TRY

00:51:10.966 --> 00:51:15.392
THAT NOW INFAMOUS PHONE CALL, 
TRUMP RESPONDED TO THE UKRAINIAN

00:51:15.598 --> 00:51:18.437
APPRECIATION FOR U.S. DEFENSE 
SUPPORT AND AND REQUESTED TO BUY

00:51:18.645 --> 00:51:23.297
MORE MISSILES BY SAYING I WOULD 
LIKE YOU TO DO US A FAVOR. TRUMP

00:51:23.508 --> 00:51:28.360
AS ZELENSKY  TO INVESTIGATE THE 
DISCREDITED 2016 CONSPIRACY 

00:51:28.571 --> 00:51:32.945
THEORY AND EVEN MORE OMINOUSLY 
LOOK INTO THE BIDEN'S. NEITHER 

00:51:33.154 --> 00:51:35.154
HAD BEEN A PART OF THE 

00:51:39.058 --> 00:51:41.404
PREMATURE MATERIAL FOR THE CALL 
BUT THEY WERE IN DONALD TRUMP'S 

00:51:41.611 --> 00:51:43.395
PERSONAL INTEREST AND THE 
INTEREST OF HIS REELECTION 

00:51:43.396 --> 00:51:45.068
CAMPAIGN. AND THE UKRAINIAN 
PRESIDENT KNEW ABOUT BOTH 

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:47.459
ADVANCE IN PART BECAUSE OF 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND  AND 

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:51.781
AMBASSADOR VOLKER'S EFFORTS  TO 
MAKE THEM AWARE OF THAT THE 

00:51:51.994 --> 00:51:54.523
PRESIDENT WAS DEMANDING. AROUND 
THIS TIME, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:56.734
BECAME 

00:51:57.811 --> 00:51:59.913
AWARE  OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THE 

00:52:00.125 --> 00:52:01.873
UKRAINE WHICH HAVE BEEN 
ANNOUNCED ON A SECURE 

00:52:01.874 --> 00:52:05.680
INTRA-AGENCY VIDEO ON JULY 18th 
TELLING US IT WAS EXTREMELY ODD 

00:52:05.888 --> 00:52:09.399
THAT NOBODY INVOLVED IN 
IMPLEMENTING POLICY KNEW WHY THE

00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:14.286
AID HAD BEEN PUT ON HOLD. DURING
AUGUST,  SONDLAND PARTICIPATED 

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:20.965
IN CONFERENCE CALLS  WITH VOLKER
AND GIULIANI  AND SAID THE JUST 

00:52:21.175 --> 00:52:25.433
GIST OF EVERY CALL, WHAT WAS 
GOING TO GO INTO THE PRESS 

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:27.876
STATEMENT. ON AUGUST 9th, A TEXT
MESSAGE WITH VOLKER STATED I 

00:52:28.084 --> 00:52:30.084
THINK  

00:52:31.734 --> 00:52:33.416
POTUS REALLY WANTS THE 
DELIVERABLE. WHICH IS A 

00:52:33.417 --> 00:52:35.106
DELIVERABLE PUBLIC STATEMENT 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO 

00:52:35.107 --> 00:52:38.446
SEE OR HEAR BEFORE A WHITE HOUSE
MEETING WOULD HAPPEN. ON 

00:52:38.838 --> 00:52:40.838
SEPTEMBER 1st, AMBASSADOR 

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.389
SONDLAND  PARTICIPATED IN VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE'S BILATERAL 

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:50.421
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
IN WARSAW. FOLLOWING THAT 

00:52:50.633 --> 00:52:52.521
MEETING, SONDLAND APPROACHED THE
SENIOR UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL  TO 

00:52:52.522 --> 00:52:57.271
TELL HIM THAT HE BELIEVED COULD 
HELP THEM MOVE THE AID WAS IF 

00:52:57.479 --> 00:53:01.282
THE UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR GENERAL
WOULD GO TO THE MICROPHONE AND 

00:53:01.494 --> 00:53:05.463
ANNOUNCED HE WAS OPENING THE 
BURISMA INVESTIGATION.  SONDLAND

00:53:05.673 --> 00:53:08.530
TOLD TAYLOR HE HAD MADE A 
MISTAKE  BY TELLING THE 

00:53:08.736 --> 00:53:10.736
UKRAINIANS THAT AN 

00:53:12.224 --> 00:53:14.448
OVER OFFICE OVAL OFFICE MEETING 
WAS DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC 

00:53:14.656 --> 00:53:17.027
ANNOUNCEMENT OF PUBLIC 
INVESTIGATIONS, IN FACT 

00:53:17.336 --> 00:53:19.336
EVERYTHING WAS DEPENDENT ON SUCH
AN ANNOUNCEMENT INCLUDING 

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.530
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. EVEN THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PROSECUTOR 

00:53:25.568 --> 00:53:29.627
GENERAL WOULD NOT SATISFY THE 
PRESIDENT. ON SEPTEMBER 7th 

00:53:29.837 --> 00:53:33.722
SONDLAND SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT 
AND TOLD  THEM ABOUT THE CALL 

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.705
SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE 
PRESIDENT SAID ALTHOUGH THIS WAS

00:53:37.706 --> 00:53:40.862
NOT A QUID PRO QUO IF PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY DID NOT CLEAR THINGS UP

00:53:41.409 --> 00:53:45.901
IN PUBLIC, WE WOULD BE AT A 
STALEMATE. AN ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD

00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:50.946
NOT BE ENOUGH. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY MUST ANNOUNCE 

00:53:51.174 --> 00:53:53.203
PERSONALLY THAT HE WOULD OPEN 
THE INVESTIGATIONS. SONDLAND 

00:53:53.408 --> 00:53:56.255
TOLD TAYLOR  THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS 

00:54:00.896 --> 00:54:02.896
A BUSINESSMAN. WHEN A 
BUSINESSMAN IS ABOUT TO SIGN A 

00:54:03.096 --> 00:54:05.096
CHECK TO SOMEONE WHO OWES THEM 
SOMETHING THE BUSINESSMAN ASKED 

00:54:05.187 --> 00:54:07.282
THAT PERSON TO PAY UP BEFORE 
SIGNING THE CHECK. THE CHECK, 

00:54:07.488 --> 00:54:11.157
REFERRED TO HERE WAS THE U.S. 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE 

00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:13.498
UKRAINE AND UKRAINE HAD TO PAY 
UP 

00:54:17.695 --> 00:54:20.247
WITH INVESTIGATIONS. ON OCTOBER 
THEY LOOKED TO SOUGHT TO CLOSE 

00:54:23.245 --> 00:54:26.308
THE DEAL. AFTER TAYLOR TEXTED 
SONDLAND ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2019,  

00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:28.765
I THINK IT'S CRAZY TO WITHHOLD 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR HELP 

00:54:28.972 --> 00:54:31.385
WITH A LOCAL CAMPAIGN. 16 

00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:36.618
DAYS LATER, THE TRANSCRIPT OF 
THE JULY 25th CALL WAS MADE 

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:40.920
PUBLIC AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
LEARNED THE TRUTH OF HOW OUR 

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:44.586
PRESIDENT TRIED TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF A NORMAL ALLY. NOW 

00:54:44.896 --> 00:54:46.896
IT IS UP TO CONGRESS AS THE 
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES TO 

00:54:47.034 --> 00:54:49.034
DETERMINE WHAT RESPONSE 

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.680
IS APPROPRIATE. IF THE PRESIDENT
ABUSED HIS POWER AND INVITED 

00:54:53.784 --> 00:54:58.024
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE INTO OUR 
ELECTIONS IF HE SOUGHT TO 

00:54:58.235 --> 00:55:00.235
CONDITION, COURSE OR EXTORT AN 
ALLY TO AID HIS REELECTION 

00:55:00.335 --> 00:55:02.335
CAMPAIGN AND DID SO BY 

00:55:04.488 --> 00:55:07.477
WITHHOLDING OFFICIAL NEEDED 
MILITARY AID, IT WOULD BE UP TO 

00:55:07.683 --> 00:55:11.814
US TO DECIDE WHETHER THOSE ACTS 
ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE OFFICE 

00:55:12.027 --> 00:55:14.027
OF THE 

00:55:16.264 --> 00:55:18.703
PRESIDENCY. FINALLY, I WANT TO 
SAY A WORD ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 

00:55:18.913 --> 00:55:23.570
AND SECRETARY POMPEO'S 
OBSTRUCTION OF THIS 

00:55:23.785 --> 00:55:25.686
INVESTIGATION. WE HAVE NOT 
RECEIVED A SINGLE DOCUMENT FROM 

00:55:25.687 --> 00:55:27.687
THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

00:55:30.073 --> 00:55:32.073
AND, AS AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S 
OPENING STATEMENT THEY WILL MAKE

00:55:33.326 --> 00:55:37.723
CLEAR, THOSE DOCUMENTS BEAR 
DIRECTLY ON THIS INVESTIGATION 

00:55:38.397 --> 00:55:43.710
AND THIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. I 
THINK WE KNOW NOW, BASED ON A 

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.556
SAMPLE OF DOCUMENTS ATTACHED TO 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S STATEMENT 

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:51.018
THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCHEME
WAS FAR 

00:55:54.039 --> 00:55:56.273
AND WIDE. AND INCLUDED AMONG 
OTHERS SECRETARY OF STATE 

00:55:56.484 --> 00:56:00.163
POMPEO, AS WELL AS THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. WE CAN SEE WHY 

00:56:00.369 --> 00:56:06.430
SECRETARY POMPEO AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAVE MADE SUCH A CONCERTED

00:56:06.637 --> 00:56:12.963
AND ACROSS-THE-BOARD EFFORT TO 
OBSTRUCT THIS INVESTIGATION AND 

00:56:13.172 --> 00:56:18.449
THIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. I WILL
JUST SAY THIS THEY DO SO AT 

00:56:18.659 --> 00:56:24.326
THEIR OWN PERIL. I REMIND THE 
PRESIDENT THAT ARTICLE 3 OF THE 

00:56:24.537 --> 00:56:26.403
IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES DRAFTED 
AGAINST PRESIDENT NIXON WAS HIS 

00:56:26.404 --> 00:56:33.453
REFUSAL TO OBEY THE SUBPOENAS OF
CONGRESS. WITH THAT, I RECOGNIZE

00:56:33.659 --> 00:56:38.333
RANKING MEMBER NUNES FOR ANY 
REMARKS HE WOULD WISH TO MAKE.  

00:56:38.539 --> 00:56:42.103
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU GENTLEMEN, AS WE 
LEARNED LAST NIGHT, STORYTIME 

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.230
LAST NIGHT, WE GET STORYTIME 
FIRST THING THIS MORNING. 

00:56:44.231 --> 00:56:48.498
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND WELCOME.  
GLAD YOU ARE HERE. REALLY NOT 

00:56:48.707 --> 00:56:52.070
GLAD YOU ARE HERE BUT WELCOME TO
THE FIFTH DAY OF 

00:56:56.947 --> 00:57:00.909
THE CIRCUS. AS I NOTED BEFORE, 
THE DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE 

00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:03.117
SPENT THREE YEARS ACCUSING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP OF BEING A 

00:57:03.121 --> 00:57:06.368
RUSSIAN AGENT. IN MARCH, 2018 
AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION,

00:57:06.578 --> 00:57:08.578
INTELLIGENCE 

00:57:11.553 --> 00:57:15.171
COMMITTEE PUBLICANS ISSUED A 240
PAGE REPORT DESCRIBING IN DETAIL

00:57:15.383 --> 00:57:17.383
HOW THE RUSSIANS MEDDLED IN THE 
2016 ELECTIONS AND MAKING 

00:57:17.475 --> 00:57:19.475
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
IMPROVE OUR 

00:57:23.215 --> 00:57:25.215
ELECTION SECURITY. DENOUNCING 
THE REPORT AS A WHITEWASH AND 

00:57:25.446 --> 00:57:28.707
ACCUSING REPUBLICANS OF 
DIVERTING THE INVESTIGATION THE 

00:57:28.919 --> 00:57:32.563
DEMOCRATS ISSUED THEIR OWN 
REPORT. FOCUSING ON THERE NOW 

00:57:32.769 --> 00:57:37.246
DEBUNKED CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT 
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:41.750
RUSSIA TO HACK THE ELECTION. 
NOTABLY, THE DEMOCRATS VOWED AT 

00:57:41.962 --> 00:57:48.605
THE TIME TO PRESENT A FURTHER 
"COMPREHENSIVE REPORT" AFTER 

00:57:48.815 --> 00:57:51.045
THEY FINISHED THEIR 
INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMP'S 

00:57:51.256 --> 00:57:54.705
TREASONOUS COLLUSION WITH 
RUSSIA. FOR SOME COMPLETELY 

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.009
EXCLUDABLE REASON INEXPLICABLE 
REASON AFTER THE RUSSIA HOAX THE

00:58:01.218 --> 00:58:03.453
DEMOCRATS FAILED TO ISSUE THAT 
COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. WE ARE 

00:58:08.445 --> 00:58:11.840
STILL WAITING. THIS EPISODE 
SHOWS HOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:13.564
EXPLOITED THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES

00:58:13.565 --> 00:58:15.443
FOR THREE YEARS. CULMINATING IN 
THESE IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS AND 

00:58:15.444 --> 00:58:20.095
THEIR MANIA TO ATTACK THE 
PRESIDENT. NO CONSPIRACY THEORY 

00:58:20.303 --> 00:58:22.303
IS TOO OUTLANDISH FOR 

00:58:25.783 --> 00:58:27.655
THE DEMOCRATS. TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN THEY FLOATED THE 

00:58:27.656 --> 00:58:31.479
POSSIBILITY OF SOME FAR-FETCHED 
MALFEASANCE BY TRUMP TO DECLARE 

00:58:31.689 --> 00:58:34.115
THE DIRE NEED TO INVESTIGATED 
AND THEN SUDDENLY DROP THE ISSUE

00:58:34.325 --> 00:58:41.626
AND MOVED ON TO THE NEXT ASININE
THEORY. A SAMPLING OF THE 

00:58:41.837 --> 00:58:43.837
ACCUSATIONS AND INSINUATIONS 

00:58:47.515 --> 00:58:49.515
INCLUDES THESE. TRUMP IS A 
LONGTIME RUSSIAN AGENT AS 

00:58:49.555 --> 00:58:54.656
DESCRIBED IN THE STEELE DOSSIER.
THE RUSSIANS GAVE TRUMP 

00:58:57.666 --> 00:58:59.666
ADVANTAGE TO EMAILS STOLEN BY 
THE DNC AND HILLARY CAMPAIGN. 

00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:04.986
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PAY SOME OF 
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE STOLEN 

00:59:05.197 --> 00:59:06.665
DOCUMENTS. TRUMP RECEIVED 
VARIOUS MATERIALS FROM THE 

00:59:06.666 --> 00:59:08.666
RUSSIANS THROUGH A TRUMP 

00:59:10.671 --> 00:59:12.671
CAMPAIGN AIDE. TRUMP LAUNDERED 
RUSSIAN MONEY THROUGH REAL 

00:59:13.106 --> 00:59:16.998
ESTATE DEALS. TRUMP WAS 
BLACKMAILED BY RUSSIA THROUGH 

00:59:17.206 --> 00:59:24.204
HIS FINANCIAL EXPORT EXPOSURE. 
TRUMP HAD A DIABOLICAL PLAN TO 

00:59:24.417 --> 00:59:28.953
BUILD A TRUMP TOWER IN MOSCOW. 
TRUMP CHANGED THE NATIONAL 

00:59:29.171 --> 00:59:32.824
COMMITTEE PLATFORM TO HURT 
UKRAINE AND BENEFIT RUSSIA. THE 

00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:36.873
RUSSIANS LAUNDERED MONEY THROUGH
THE NRA THROUGH THE TRUMP 

00:59:37.084 --> 00:59:39.084
CAMPAIGN. 

00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:42.612
TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW LIED ABOUT 
HIS RUSSIAN CONTACTS WHILE 

00:59:42.613 --> 00:59:45.821
OBTAINING HIS SECURITY CURRENTS.
IT IS A LONG LIST OF CHARGES, 

00:59:47.227 --> 00:59:51.336
ALL FALSE. I CAN GO ON AND ON 
AND ON BUT I WILL SPARE YOU FOR 

00:59:54.749 --> 00:59:56.521
THIS MOMENT. CLEARLY THESE 
LUDICROUS ACCUSATIONS DO NOT 

00:59:56.522 --> 01:00:00.837
REFLECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS 
HONESTLY SEARCHING FOR THE 

01:00:01.047 --> 01:00:03.541
TRUTH. THEY ARE THE ACTIONS OF 
PARTISAN EXTREMISTS WHO HIJACKED

01:00:03.747 --> 01:00:07.105
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND 
TRANSFORMED IT INTO THE 

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:10.404
IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE. ABANDONED
ITS CORE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS AND

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:14.285
TURNED IT INTO A BEACHHEAD 
TESTING AN ELECTED PRESIDENT 

01:00:15.871 --> 01:00:18.530
FROM OFFICE. YOU HAVE TO KEEP 
THAT HISTORY IN MIND AS YOU 

01:00:18.743 --> 01:00:23.179
CONSIDER THE DEMOCRATS LATEST 
CATALOG OF SUPPOSEDLY 

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.413
OUTRAGEOUS. GRANTED, A FRIENDLY 
CALL WITH 

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.680
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WOULDN'T 
SEEM TO RISE TO THE SAME LEVEL 

01:00:31.766 --> 01:00:35.781
AS BEING A RUSSIAN AGENT. IF THE
DEMOCRATS WERE RUNNING OUT OF 

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:37.996
TIME. IF THEY WAITED ANY LONGER 
THERE IMPEACHMENT CIRCUS WOULD 

01:00:38.203 --> 01:00:40.462
INTERVENE WITH THEIR OWN 
CANDIDATE'S 

01:00:44.521 --> 01:00:46.719
20/20 CAMPAIGN. SO, YOU HAVE TO 
GIVE THEM POINTS FOR CREATIVITY 

01:00:46.929 --> 01:00:48.929
AND SELLING THIS ABSURDITY AS AN

01:00:52.429 --> 01:00:54.429
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. ALL THIS 
EXPLAINS WHY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

01:00:54.469 --> 01:00:56.469
GATHERED ZERO REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

01:00:58.735 --> 01:01:00.735
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
FOR THE IMPEACHMENT CRUSADE. IN 

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.843
FACT THE VOTE WE HELD WAS A 
BIPARTISAN VOTE AGAINST THIS 

01:01:07.055 --> 01:01:10.933
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. SPEAKER 
PELOSI, CHAIRMAN SCHIFF , THE 

01:01:11.156 --> 01:01:16.204
KEY FIGURES BEHIND THIS 
IMPEACHMENT REGRADE ALL CLAIM 

01:01:16.412 --> 01:01:19.243
THAT IMPEACHMENT IS SO DAMAGING 
TO THE COUNTRY IT CAN ONLY 

01:01:19.557 --> 01:01:21.557
PROCEED WITH 

01:01:23.508 --> 01:01:27.376
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THOSE 
DECLARATIONS ARE NO LONGER TRUE?

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.580
THAT DID IMPEACHMENT BECOME LESS
DIVISIVE? OF 

01:01:32.245 --> 01:01:34.455
COURSE NOT. THEY KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE THEY ARE 

01:01:34.662 --> 01:01:39.350
INFLICTING ON THIS NATION. THEY 
HAVE PASSED THE POINT OF NO 

01:01:39.566 --> 01:01:45.588
RETURN. AFTER THREE YEARS OF 
PREPARATION WORK, MUCH OF IT 

01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:48.330
SPEARHEADED BY THE DEMOCRATS ON 
THIS COMMITTEE, USING ALL THE 

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:52.806
TOOLS OF CONGRESS TO ACCUSE, 
INVESTIGATE, INDICT, AND SMEAR 

01:01:53.988 --> 01:01:56.952
THE PRESIDENT. THEY STOKED A 
FRENZY AMONGST THE MOST 

01:01:57.841 --> 01:01:59.841
FANATICAL SUPPORTERS THAT THEY 
CAN NO 

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.665
LONGER CONTROL. AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND YOU ARE HERE TODAY  TO 

01:02:10.233 --> 01:02:14.321
BE SMEARED. BUT YOU WILL MAKE IT
THROUGH IT. AND, I APPRECIATE 

01:02:14.534 --> 01:02:17.720
YOUR SERVICE TO THIS COUNTRY AND
I'M SORRY YOU'VE HAD TO GO 

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.169
THROUGH THIS. 

01:02:23.837 --> 01:02:25.837
IN CLOSING, DEMOCRATS HAVE 
ZEROED IN ON AN ANONYMOUS 

01:02:26.687 --> 01:02:31.175
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT THAT WAS
COOKED UP IN COOPERATION AT THE 

01:02:31.383 --> 01:02:35.849
DEMOCRATS ON THIS VERY 
COMMITTEE. THEY LIED TO THE 

01:02:36.058 --> 01:02:38.468
AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE 
COOPERATION AND REFUSED TO LET 

01:02:38.681 --> 01:02:41.545
US QUESTION THE WHISTLEBLOWER TO
DISCOVER 

01:02:45.174 --> 01:02:46.853
THE TRUTH. MEANWHILE, THE 
DEMOCRATS LASH OUT AGAINST 

01:02:46.854 --> 01:02:52.696
ANYONE WHO QUESTIONS OR CAST OUT
ON THE SPECTACLE. WHEN THE 

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:55.951
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
DENIES ANYTHING IMPROPER 

01:02:56.164 --> 01:02:59.405
HAPPENED ON THE PHONE CALL, THE 
DEMOCRATS SAY HE IS A LIAR. WHEN

01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:03.888
JOURNALISTS REPORT ON UKRAINE 
ELECTION MEDDLING AND HUNTER 

01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:09.540
BIDEN'S POSITION ON THE BOARD OF
CORRUPT UKRAINIAN COMPANIES THE 

01:03:09.757 --> 01:03:13.003
DEMOCRATS LABEL THEM CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES. WHEN THE DEMOCRATS 

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:17.068
CANNOT GET ANY TRACTION FOR THE 
ALLEGATIONS OF QUID PRO QUO, 

01:03:17.275 --> 01:03:22.742
THEY MOVE THE GOLD POST GOALPOST
AND ACCUSED THE PRESIDENT OF 

01:03:22.956 --> 01:03:27.424
EXTORTION, BRIBERY, AND A LAST 
RESORT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. 

01:03:27.632 --> 01:03:31.634
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SENT US TO 
WASHINGTON TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, 

01:03:31.845 --> 01:03:35.169
NOT TO WAGE SCORCHED-EARTH 
POLITICAL WARFARE AGAINST THE 

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:39.609
OTHER PARTY. THIS IMPEACHMENT IS
NOT HELPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:44.101
IT IS NOT A LEGITIMATE USE OF 
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND IT IS 

01:03:44.312 --> 01:03:47.939
DEFINITELY NOT IMPROVING OUR 
NATIONAL 

01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:55.313
SECURITY. FINALLY, THE DEMOCRATS
FAKE OUTRAGE THAT PRESIDENT 

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.520
TRUMP HAS USED HIS OWN CHANNEL 
TO COMMUNICATE 

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.381
WITH UKRAINE REMIND MY FRIENDS 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:07.864
THAT OUR FIRST PRESIDENT, GEORGE
WASHINGTON DIRECTED HIS OWN 

01:04:08.455 --> 01:04:10.455
DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS TO SECURE A 
TREATY WITH 

01:04:13.738 --> 01:04:17.810
GREAT BRITAIN. IF MY DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES WERE AROUND IN 1794 

01:04:18.017 --> 01:04:23.489
THEY PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO 
IMPEACH HIM TOO. MR. CHAIRMAN,

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
THANK YOU RANKING MEMBER NUNES. 

01:06:53.707 --> 01:06:55.876
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SPEAK AGAIN TO THE MEMBERS OF 

01:06:59.485 --> 01:07:01.797
THIS COMMITTEE. FIRST, LET ME 
OFFER MY THANKS TO THE MEN AND 

01:07:02.005 --> 01:07:05.495
WOMEN OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
STATE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THEIR 

01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:09.257
PROFESSIONAL LIVES TO SUPPORT 
THE FOREIGN POLICY WORK OF THE 

01:07:11.876 --> 01:07:15.452
UNITED STATES. IN PARTICULAR I 
WANT TO THINK MY STAFF AT THE 

01:07:15.659 --> 01:07:17.989
U.S. MISSION TO THE EUROPEAN 
UNION. YOUR INTEGRITY, 

01:07:18.199 --> 01:07:22.465
DEDICATION AND HARD WORK OFTEN 
PERFORMED WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCLAIM

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:28.532
OR RECOGNITION SERVES AS A 
SHINING EXAMPLE OF TRUE PUBLIC 

01:07:28.742 --> 01:07:32.227
SERVICE AND I AM PERSONALLY 
GRATEFUL TO WORK BESIDE YOU EACH

01:07:32.437 --> 01:07:34.437
AND 

01:07:37.402 --> 01:07:40.584
EVERY DAY. IT IS MY HONOR TO 
SERVE AS THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO 

01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:43.101
THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE U.S. 
MISSION TO THE EU IS THE DIRECT 

01:07:45.178 --> 01:07:47.178
LINK BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES 
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND 

01:07:50.469 --> 01:07:53.943
ITS MEMBERS. AMERICA'S 
LONG-STANDING ALLIES AND ONE OF 

01:07:54.152 --> 01:07:57.801
THE LARGEST ECONOMIC BLOCKS IN 
THE WORLD. EVERY DAY, I WORKED 

01:07:58.009 --> 01:08:00.235
TO SUPPORT A STRONG, UNITED, AND

01:08:05.094 --> 01:08:07.094
PEACEFUL EUROPE. STRENGTHENING 
OUR TIES WITH EUROPE SERVES BOTH

01:08:07.106 --> 01:08:10.981
AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN GOALS. AS 
WE, TOGETHER PROMOTE VERTICAL 

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:13.190
STABILITY AND ECONOMIC 
PROSPERITY AROUND 

01:08:15.048 --> 01:08:19.780
THE WORLD. I EXPECT THAT FEW 
AMERICANS HAVE HEARD MY NAME 

01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:21.990
BEFORE THESE EVENTS. BEFORE I 
BEGIN, 

01:08:26.006 --> 01:08:28.278
MY SUBJECTIVE TESTIMONY PLEASE 
LET ME GO AHEAD AND SHARE SOME 

01:08:28.486 --> 01:08:33.346
OF MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND. 
SUBSTANTATIVE I PARENTS FLED 

01:08:33.557 --> 01:08:35.557
EUROPE DURING THE HOLOCAUST, THE
ESCAPING OF THE ATROCITIES OF 

01:08:35.971 --> 01:08:40.068
THAT TIME, MY PARENTS LEFT 
GERMANY FOR URUGUAY, AND THEN 

01:08:44.095 --> 01:08:46.200
IN 1953 IMMIGRATED TO SEATTLE, 
WASHINGTON WHERE I WAS BORN IN 

01:08:46.411 --> 01:08:49.799
RAISED. LIKE SO MANY IMMIGRANTS,
MY FAMILY WAS EAGER FOR FREEDOM 

01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:55.474
AND HUNGRY FOR OPPORTUNITY. THEY
RAISED MY SISTER AND ME TO BE 

01:08:55.682 --> 01:08:59.727
HUMBLE, HARD-WORKING, AND 
PATRIOTIC. AND I AM FOREVER 

01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:04.411
GRATEFUL FOR THE SACRIFICES THEY
MADE ON OUR BEHALF. PUBLIC 

01:09:04.619 --> 01:09:08.063
SERVICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
IMPORTANT TO ME. AS A LIFELONG 

01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.379
REPUBLICAN, I 

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:13.914
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INITIATIVES 
OF BOTH REPUBLICAN AND 

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.198
DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION. IN 
2003, I SERVED AS A MEMBER OF 

01:09:19.408 --> 01:09:21.675
THE TRANSITION TEAM FOR OREGON 
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR 

01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:28.902
TED GRONKOWSKI. HE ALSO 
APPOINTED ME TO SERVE ON VERY 

01:09:30.403 --> 01:09:34.500
STATEWIDE BOARDS. IN 2007, 
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:37.710
APPOINTED ME AS A MEMBER OF THE 
COMMISSION OF WHITE HOUSE 

01:09:37.925 --> 01:09:42.423
FELLOWS. I WORKED WITH PRESIDENT
BUSH ON CHARITABLE EVENTS FOR 

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:45.277
HIS FOUNDATION'S MILITARY 
SERVICE INITIATIVE. AND I ALSO 

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:50.633
WORKED BRIEFLY WITH FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S OFFICE IN 

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.167
CONNECTION WITH THE VICE 
PRESIDENT'S NATIONWIDE 

01:09:55.584 --> 01:09:59.267
ANTICANCER INITIATIVE AT A LOCAL
NORTHWEST HOSPITAL. AND, OF 

01:09:59.476 --> 01:10:01.914
COURSE, THE HIGHEST HONOR IN MY 
PUBLIC LIFE CAME WHEN 

01:10:05.139 --> 01:10:07.139
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED ME TO 
SERVE AS THE UNITED STATES 

01:10:07.257 --> 01:10:09.257
AMBASSADOR TO THE 

01:10:11.643 --> 01:10:13.643
EUROPEAN UNION. THE SENATE 
CONFIRMED ME AS AN AMBASSADOR ON

01:10:13.838 --> 01:10:17.729
A BIPARTISAN VOICE VOTE AND I 
ASSUMED THE ROLE IN MUST 

01:10:17.941 --> 01:10:19.941
BRUSSELS JULY 

01:10:21.382 --> 01:10:23.611
9th, 2018. ALTHOUGH TODAY IS MY 
FIRST PUBLIC TESTIMONY ON THE 

01:10:24.432 --> 01:10:29.737
UKRAINE MATTERS, THIS MAKES FOR 
IS NOT MY FIRST TIME COOPERATING

01:10:29.944 --> 01:10:31.944
WITH 

01:10:33.165 --> 01:10:35.388
THIS COMMITTEE. AS YOU KNOW I'VE
ARTIE PROVIDED 10 HOURS OF 

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.867
DEPOSITION TESTIMONY. AND I DID 
SO DESPITE DIRECTIVES FROM THE 

01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:42.519
WHITE HOUSE, AND THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT, THAT I REFUSED TO 

01:10:42.729 --> 01:10:48.196
APPEAR AS MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE.
I AGREED TO TESTIFY BECAUSE I 

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:52.265
RESPECT THE GRAVITY OF THE 
MOMENT AND I BELIEVE HAVE AN 

01:10:52.476 --> 01:10:55.465
OBLIGATION TO ACCOUNT FULLY FOR 
MY ROLE IN 

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:01.167
THESE EVENTS. BUT I ALSO MUST 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PROCESS 

01:11:01.268 --> 01:11:03.268
HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. IN MANY 
RESPECTS, LESS 

01:11:06.892 --> 01:11:09.515
THAN FAIR. I HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS
TO ALL OF MY PHONE RECORDS, 

01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:12.805
STATE DEPARTMENT EMAILS, AND 
MANY, MANY OTHER STATE 

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:19.694
DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS. I WAS TOLD
I CANNOT WORK WITH MY EU STAFF 

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:23.951
TO PULL TOGETHER THE RELEVANT 
FILES AND INFORMATION. HAVING 

01:11:24.162 --> 01:11:27.604
ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
MATERIALS WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 

01:11:27.915 --> 01:11:31.293
HELPFUL TO ME IN TRYING TO 
RECONSTRUCT WITH WHOM I SPOKE 

01:11:32.072 --> 01:11:34.519
AND MET, AND WHEN AND WHAT WAS 
SAID. 

01:11:38.173 --> 01:11:40.810
AS AMBASSADOR, I'VE HAD HUNDREDS
OF MEETINGS AND CALLS WITH 

01:11:41.039 --> 01:11:43.867
INDIVIDUALS. BUT I AM NOT A 
NOTETAKER OR A MEMO WRITER. 

01:11:44.084 --> 01:11:49.556
NEVER HAVE BEEN. MY JOB REQUIRES
THAT I SPEAK WITH HEADS 

01:11:52.594 --> 01:11:54.594
OF STATE, SENIOR 

01:11:57.065 --> 01:11:58.852
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, MEMBERS OF
THE CABINET, THE PRESIDENT, 

01:11:58.853 --> 01:12:01.749
ALMOST EACH AND EVERY DAY. 
TALKING WITH FOREIGN LEADERS 

01:12:01.957 --> 01:12:06.829
MIGHT BE MEMORABLE TO SOME 
PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS MY JOB. I DO

01:12:07.039 --> 01:12:12.324
IT ALL THE TIME. MY LAWYERS AND 
I HAVE A MULTIPLE REQUEST TO THE

01:12:12.531 --> 01:12:16.969
STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE FOR THESE MATERIALS. YET, 

01:12:17.179 --> 01:12:19.534
THESE MATERIALS WERE NOT 
PROVIDED TO ME AND THEY HAVE 

01:12:21.429 --> 01:12:25.095
ALSO REFUSED TO SHARE THESE 
MATERIALS WITH THIS COMMITTEE. 

01:12:25.302 --> 01:12:27.958
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT 
CLASSIFIED AND, 

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:33.845
IN FAIRNESS, IN FAIRNESS, SHOULD
HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. IN THE

01:12:34.057 --> 01:12:40.323
ABSENCE OF THESE MATERIALS MY 
MEMORY, ADMITTEDLY, HAS NOT BEEN

01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:43.774
PERFECT AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT
A MORE FAIR, OPEN AND ORDERLY 

01:12:43.983 --> 01:12:47.227
PROCESS OF ALLOWING ME TO READ 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER 

01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:49.483
MATERIALS WOULD HAVE MADE THIS 
PROCESS FAR 

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:55.537
MORE TRANSPARENT. I DON'T INTEND
TO REPEAT MY PRIOR OPENING 

01:12:55.749 --> 01:12:57.749
STATEMENT OR ATTEMPT 

01:12:59.215 --> 01:13:02.063
TO SUMMARIZE 10 HOURS OF 
PREVIOUS DEPOSITION TESTIMONY. 

01:13:02.272 --> 01:13:05.123
HOWEVER, A FEW CRITICAL POINTS 
HAVE BEEN OBSCURED BY NOISE OVER

01:13:05.331 --> 01:13:10.038
THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS. I 
AM WORRIED THAT THE BIGGER 

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:17.291
PICTURE IS BEING IGNORED. SO, 
LET ME MAKE A FEW KEY POINTS. 

01:13:17.507 --> 01:13:19.507
FIRST, 

01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:24.465
SECRETARY PERRY, AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER  AND I WORKED WITH MR. 

01:13:24.677 --> 01:13:30.108
RUDY GIULIANI ON UKRAINE MATTERS
AT THE EXPRESSED DIRECTION OF 

01:13:30.314 --> 01:13:33.967
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. WE DID NOT WANT TO WORK 

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:39.839
WITH MR. GIULIANI. SIMPLY PUT, 
WE WERE PLAYING THE HAND WE WERE

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:46.742
DEALT. WE ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT IF
WE REFUSED TO WORK WITH MR. 

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:48.955
GIULIANI, WE WOULD LOSE A VERY 

01:13:51.423 --> 01:13:53.205
IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO CEMENT 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 

01:13:53.206 --> 01:13:57.914
STATES AND UKRAINE. SO WE 
FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT'S 

01:14:01.366 --> 01:14:03.366
ORDERS. SECOND, ALTHOUGH WE 
DISAGREED WITH THE NEED TO 

01:14:03.462 --> 01:14:07.082
INVOLVE MR. GIULIANI, AT THE 
TIME WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HIS 

01:14:07.294 --> 01:14:09.294
ROLE 

01:14:11.736 --> 01:14:14.398
WAS IMPROPER. AS I PREVIOUSLY 
TESTIFIED IF I HAD KNOWN OF ALL 

01:14:14.613 --> 01:14:18.237
OF MR. GIULIANI'S DEALINGS HIS 
ASSOCIATIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS, 

01:14:18.451 --> 01:14:24.053
SOME OF WHOM WHO ARE NOW UNDER 
CRIMINAL INDICTMENT I, 

01:14:24.271 --> 01:14:28.792
PERSONALLY WOULD NOT HAVE 
ACQUIESCED TO HIS PARTICIPATION.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.872
STILL, GIVEN WHAT WE KNEW AT THE
TIME, WHAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO 

01:14:33.085 --> 01:14:41.198
DID NOT APPEAR TO BE WRONG. 
THIRD, LET ME SAY PRECISELY 

01:14:41.413 --> 01:14:46.470
BECAUSE WE DID NOT THINK THAT WE
WERE ENGAGING IN IMPROPER 

01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:52.757
BEHAVIOR, WE MADE EVERY EFFORT 
TO ENSURE THAT THE RELEVANT 

01:14:52.972 --> 01:14:56.421
DECISION-MAKERS AT THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE STATE 

01:14:56.633 --> 01:14:58.633
DEPARTMENT KNEW THE IMPORTANT 
DETAILS OF 

01:15:01.293 --> 01:15:04.743
OUR EFFORTS. THE SUGGESTION THAT
WE WERE ENGAGED IN SOME 

01:15:05.051 --> 01:15:10.866
IRREGULAR OR ROGUE DIPLOMACY IS 
ABSOLUTELY FALSE. I HAVE NOW 

01:15:12.264 --> 01:15:14.962
IDENTIFIED CERTAIN STATE 
DEPARTMENT EMAILS AND MESSAGES 

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:20.203
THAT PROVIDE CONTEMPORANEOUS 
SUPPORT FOR MY VIEW. THESE 

01:15:21.602 --> 01:15:26.210
EMAILS SHOW THAT THE LEADERSHIP 
OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE 

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:29.524
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, AND 
THE WHITE HOUSE WERE ALL 

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:35.627
INFORMED ABOUT THE UKRAINE 
EFFORTS FROM MAY 23rd, 2019 

01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:39.940
UNTIL THE SECURITY AID WAS 
RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 

01:15:43.135 --> 01:15:45.230
11th, 2019. I WILL QUOTE FROM 
SOME OF THESE MESSAGES WITH 

01:15:49.839 --> 01:15:56.140
YOU SHORTLY. AS I TESTIFIED 
PREVIOUSLY, AS A TESTIFIED 

01:15:56.351 --> 01:16:00.611
PREVIOUSLY, MR. GIULIANI'S 
REQUEST WERE A PRETTY QUID PRO 

01:16:00.968 --> 01:16:05.893
QUO FOR ANNOUNCING A OR 
ARRANGING A VISIT FROM PRESIDENT

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:11.373
ZELENSKY. MR. GIULIANI DEMANDED 
THAT UKRAINE MAKE A PUBLIC 

01:16:11.682 --> 01:16:15.246
STATEMENT ANNOUNCING THE 
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 2016 

01:16:15.454 --> 01:16:17.454
ELECTION,  THE DNC SERVER, AND 

01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:22.961
BURISMA.  MR. GIULIANI WAS 
EXPRESSING THE DESIRES OF THE 

01:16:23.172 --> 01:16:25.244
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND WE KNEW THESE INVESTIGATIONS

01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:27.451
WERE IMPORTANT TO 

01:16:30.094 --> 01:16:34.082
THE PRESIDENT. IN JULY AND 
AUGUST OF 2019 WE LEARNED THAT 

01:16:34.293 --> 01:16:36.632
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD ALSO 
SUSPENDED SECURITY AID 

01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:43.720
TO UKRAINE. I WAS ADAMANTLY 
OPPOSED TO ANY SUSPENSION OF 

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:50.035
AID. I WAS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO 
ANY SUSPENSION OF AID AS 

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:55.112
UKRAINIANS NEEDED THOSE FUNDS TO
FIGHT AGAINST RUSSIAN 

01:16:55.429 --> 01:17:00.191
AGGRESSION. I TRIED DILIGENTLY 
TO ASK WHY THE AIDE WAS 

01:17:00.405 --> 01:17:03.262
SUSPENDED I NEVER RECEIVED A 
CLEAR ANSWER, STILL HAVEN'T TO 

01:17:05.682 --> 01:17:07.952
THIS DAY. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY 
CREDIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE 

01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:15.460
SUSPENSION OF AID I LATER CAME 
TO BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITY AID

01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:18.957
REDEMPTION WOULD NOT OCCUR UNTIL
THERE WAS A PUBLIC STATEMENT 

01:17:19.523 --> 01:17:22.165
FROM UKRAINE COMMITTING TO THE 
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 2016 

01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:29.301
ELECTIONS AND BURISMA , AS MR. 
GIULIANI HAD DEMANDED. I SHARED 

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.564
CONCERNS OF THE POTENTIAL QUID 
PRO QUO REGARDING THE SECURITY 

01:17:33.751 --> 01:17:37.836
AID WITH SENATOR RON JOHNSON. 
AND, I ALSO SHARED MY CONCERNS 

01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:40.041
WITH 

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:48.813
THE UKRAINIANS. FINALLY, AT ALL 
TIMES I WAS ACTING IN GOOD 

01:17:49.021 --> 01:17:54.093
FAITH. I WAS ACTING IN GOOD 
FAITH. AS A PRESIDENTIAL 

01:17:54.305 --> 01:17:57.473
APPOINTEE, I FOLLOWED THE 
DIRECTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT. WE 

01:17:57.682 --> 01:18:03.448
WORKED WITH MR. GIULIANI BECAUSE
THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED US TO DO 

01:18:03.663 --> 01:18:08.086
SO. WE HAD NO DESIRE TO SET ANY 
CONDITIONS. WE HAD NOTICED HER 

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:10.800
TO SET ANY CONDITIONS ON THE 
UKRAINIANS. INDEED MY OWN 

01:18:12.409 --> 01:18:15.069
PERSONAL VIEW, WHICH I SHARED 
REPEATEDLY WITH OTHERS, WAS AT 

01:18:15.276 --> 01:18:22.785
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE SHOULD HAVE PROCEEDED

01:18:22.994 --> 01:18:27.473
WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND. WE WERE WORKING TO 

01:18:27.783 --> 01:18:35.382
OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS GIVEN THE 
FACT AS THEY EXISTED. OUR ONLY 

01:18:35.597 --> 01:18:37.666
INTEREST, AND MY ONLY INTEREST 
WAS TO ADVANCE LONG-STANDING 

01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:41.702
U.S. POLICY AND TO SUPPORT 
UKRAINE'S 

01:18:46.711 --> 01:18:49.841
FRAGILE DEMOCRACY. NOW, LET ME 
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL, 

01:18:50.050 --> 01:18:52.050
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT UKRAINE AND 
MY 

01:18:56.687 --> 01:19:00.001
INVOLVEMENT. FIRST, MY VERY 
FIRST DAYS AS AMBASSADOR TO THE 

01:19:00.208 --> 01:19:04.701
EU, WHICH WAS STARTING BACK IN 
JULY OF 2018 UKRAINE HAS 

01:19:06.094 --> 01:19:08.094
FEATURED, PROMINENTLY IN MY 

01:19:09.764 --> 01:19:11.999
BROADER PORTFOLIO. UKRAINE'S 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 

01:19:12.207 --> 01:19:14.674
DEVELOPMENT ARE CRITICAL TO THE 
LONG-STANDING AND LONG-LASTING 

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:23.800
STABILITY OF EUROPE. MOREOVER, 
THE CONFLICT IN EASTER UKRAINE 

01:19:24.014 --> 01:19:26.463
REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT SECURITY CRISIS FOR 

01:19:26.673 --> 01:19:31.432
EUROPE AND THE DATES. UNITED 
STATES. OUR EFFORTS 

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:39.864
TO COUNTER AN AGGRESSIVE RUSSIA 
STAND IN PART ON A STRONG 

01:19:40.074 --> 01:19:44.164
UKRAINE. ON APRIL 21st, 2019, 
VLADIMIR ZELENSKY  WAS ELECTED 

01:19:44.374 --> 01:19:51.667
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE IN HISTORIC
ELECTION. WITH THE EXPRESSED 

01:19:51.878 --> 01:19:56.160
SUPPORT OF SECRETARY POMPEO, I 
ATTENDED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S 

01:19:56.371 --> 01:20:01.226
INAUGURATION ON MAY 20th AS A 
PART OF THE U.S. DELEGATION 

01:20:01.436 --> 01:20:04.495
WHICH WAS LED BY ENERGY 
SECRETARY RICK PERRY. THE U.S. 

01:20:04.702 --> 01:20:08.385
DELEGATION ALSO INCLUDED SENATOR
JOHNSON, UKRAINE SPECIAL ENVOY 

01:20:09.355 --> 01:20:11.355
VOLKER  

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:14.809
AND ALEX VINDMAN OF THE SECURITY

01:20:17.703 --> 01:20:20.140
COUNCIL.  MY ATTENDANCE AT 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S 

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:24.959
INAUGURATION WAS NOT MY FIRST 
INVOLVEMENT WITH UKRAINE. AS I 

01:20:26.037 --> 01:20:30.107
TESTIFIED PREVIOUSLY, JUST FOUR 
DAYS AFTER ASSUMING MY POST AS 

01:20:30.319 --> 01:20:32.319
AMBASSADOR, IN JULY 

01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:36.821
OF 2018 I RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL 
DELEGATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT 

01:20:37.039 --> 01:20:39.039
OF THEN 

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.139
UKRAINE PRESIDENT. THE MEETING 
TOOK PLACE AT THE U.S. MISSION 

01:20:44.347 --> 01:20:47.197
IN BRUSSELS AND WAS PREARRANGED 
BY MY CAREER EU MISSION STAFF 

01:20:47.405 --> 01:20:53.299
AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS 
SINCE THEN IN BRUSSELS. LATER, 

01:20:53.507 --> 01:21:00.012
IN FEBRUARY OF 2019, I WORKED 
WELL WITH THE U.S. AMBASSADOR 

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.691
YOVANOVITCH, AND MAKING MY FIRST
OFFICIAL VISIT  TO UKRAINE OR A 

01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:09.901
U.S. NAVY VISIT TO THE BLACK SEA
PORT OF ODESSA. THE REASON I 

01:21:10.162 --> 01:21:14.035
RAISE THESE PRIOR UKRAINE 
ACTIVITIES, THE MEETINGS IN 

01:21:14.246 --> 01:21:17.108
BRUSSELS, MY VISIT TO ODESSA IS 
TO EMPHASIZE THAT UKRAINE HAS 

01:21:17.315 --> 01:21:21.482
BEEN A PART OF MY PORTFOLIO FROM
MY VERY FIRST DAYS AS THE U.S. 

01:21:22.779 --> 01:21:27.686
AND LASSITER. ANY CLAIM THAT I 
SOMEHOW MUSCLED MY WAY INTO THE 

01:21:28.054 --> 01:21:30.054
UKRAINE RELATIONSHIP IS 

01:21:33.342 --> 01:21:35.342
SIMPLY FALSE. DURING THE 
ZELENSKY INAUGURATION ON MAY 

01:21:35.578 --> 01:21:41.894
20th  THE U.S. DELEGATION 
DEVELOPED A VERY POSITIVE VIEW 

01:21:42.122 --> 01:21:45.856
OF THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT. WE 
WERE IMPRESSED AT PRESIDENT 

01:21:46.066 --> 01:21:49.425
ZELENSKY'S DESIRE TO PROMOTE A 
STRONGER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

01:21:51.433 --> 01:21:54.702
UNITED STATES. WE ADMIRED HIS 
COMMITMENT TO REFORM AND WERE 

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:59.762
EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF
UKRAINE MAKING THE 

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:05.019
CHANGES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT A 
GREATER WESTERN ECONOMIC 

01:22:05.457 --> 01:22:07.457
DEVELOPMENT. AND, WE 

01:22:09.314 --> 01:22:12.165
WERE EXCITED THAT UKRAINE MIGHT,
AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF 

01:22:12.379 --> 01:22:15.444
LIPSERVICE FINALLY GET SERIOUS 
ABOUT ADDRESSING ITS OWN 

01:22:15.653 --> 01:22:21.528
WELL-KNOWN CORRUPTION PROBLEMS. 
WITH THAT ENTHUSIASM, WE 

01:22:21.744 --> 01:22:25.168
RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE ON 
MAY 23rd TWO BRIEF PRESIDENT 

01:22:25.386 --> 01:22:29.234
TRUMP. WE ADVISE THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF 

01:22:29.443 --> 01:22:34.940
UKRAINE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
VALUING OR STRENGTHENING THE 

01:22:35.156 --> 01:22:38.707
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY. WE ASKED THE WHITE 

01:22:38.918 --> 01:22:42.862
HOUSE FOR TWO THINGS. FIRST, A 
WORKING PHONE CALL BETWEEN 

01:22:43.079 --> 01:22:46.728
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND SECOND, A WORKING 

01:22:46.938 --> 01:22:49.584
OVAL OFFICE VISITS. IN OUR VIEW,
BOTH 

01:22:52.609 --> 01:22:54.609
WERE VITAL TO CEMENTING THE 

01:22:56.668 --> 01:22:58.829
U.S.-UKRAINE RELATIONSHIP. 
DEMONSTRATING SUPPORT AND 

01:23:01.956 --> 01:23:03.956
ADVANCING BROADER U.S. 
FOREIGN-POLICY INTEREST. 

01:23:06.633 --> 01:23:11.102
UNFORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS SKEPTICAL. THE UKRAINIAN 

01:23:15.173 --> 01:23:18.637
GOVERNMENT WAS, HE EVEN 
MENTIONED THAT UKRAINE TRIED TO 

01:23:18.845 --> 01:23:20.845
TAKE HIM DOWN IN THE 

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:26.563
LAST ELECTION. IN RESPONSE TO 
OUR EFFORTS TO CHANGE 

01:23:31.564 --> 01:23:34.230
HIS VIEWS HE ENCOURAGED US TO 
TALK WITH RUDY. WE UNDERSTOOD 

01:23:34.463 --> 01:23:36.463
THAT TALK WITH 

01:23:38.155 --> 01:23:40.155
RUDY MEANT TALK WITH MR. RUDY 
GIULIANI, THE PRESIDENT'S 

01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:46.035
PERSONAL LAWYER. LET ME SAY 
AGAIN, WE WEREN'T HAPPY WITH THE

01:23:46.249 --> 01:23:48.249
PRESIDENT'S DIRECTIVE 

01:23:50.146 --> 01:23:52.146
TO TALK WITH REALLY, WE DO NOT 
WANT TO INVOLVE 

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:58.262
MR. GIULIANI. THE MEN AND WOMEN 
OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOT THE

01:23:58.481 --> 01:24:00.481
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER 
SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

01:24:03.349 --> 01:24:05.193
UKRAINE MATTERS. NONETHELESS, 
BASED ON THE PRESIDENT'S 

01:24:05.194 --> 01:24:07.194
DIRECTION, WE WERE FACED WITH 

01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:13.012
A CHOICE.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:21.058
WHICH WAS UNQUESTIONABLY IN OUR 
FOREIGN-POLICY INTEREST OR, WE 

01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:27.650
COULD DO AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 
DIRECTED AND AND TALK WITH RUDY.

01:24:27.909 --> 01:24:32.016
WE CHOSE THE LATTER COURSE, NOT 
BECAUSE WE LIKED IT BUT BECAUSE 

01:24:32.224 --> 01:24:34.224
IT WAS THE ONLY CONSTRUCTIVE 
PATH OPEN 

01:24:37.494 --> 01:24:40.345
TO US. OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, 

01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:46.088
SECRETARY PERRY, AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER AND I WERE IN 

01:24:46.089 --> 01:24:49.234
COMMUNICATION WITH MR. GIULIANI.
SECRETARY PERRY VOLUNTEERED TO 

01:24:49.444 --> 01:24:52.152
MAKE THE INITIAL CALLS WITH MR. 
GIULIANI GIVEN THEIR 

01:24:55.992 --> 01:24:57.992
PRIOR RELATIONSHIP. AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER MADE SEVERAL OF THE EARLY

01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:01.090
CALLS  AND GENERALLY INFORMED US
OF WHAT 

01:25:04.324 --> 01:25:06.008
WAS DISCUSSED. I FIRST 
COMMUNICATED WITH MR. GIULIANI 

01:25:06.009 --> 01:25:09.194
IN EARLY AUGUST, SEVERAL MONTHS 
LATER. MR. 

01:25:12.249 --> 01:25:14.245
GIULIANI EMPHASIZED THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED A PUBLIC 

01:25:14.246 --> 01:25:17.339
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY COMMITTING UKRAINE TO 

01:25:17.551 --> 01:25:19.551
LOOK INTO THE 

01:25:23.425 --> 01:25:26.677
ELECTION ISSUES. I MENTIONED THE
2016 ELECTION, INCLUDING THE DNC

01:25:26.896 --> 01:25:33.387
SERVER AND BURISMA  AS TWO 
TOPICS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE 

01:25:33.608 --> 01:25:37.445
PRESIDENT. WE KEPT THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE 

01:25:37.659 --> 01:25:39.659
DEPARTMENT AND 

01:25:41.713 --> 01:25:43.948
THE NFC INFORMED OF OUR 
ACTIVITIES AND THAT INCLUDED 

01:25:44.176 --> 01:25:46.176
COMMUNICATIONS WITH SECRETARY OF
STATE POMPEO, 

01:25:50.795 --> 01:25:55.148
HIS COUNSELOR, LISA KENNA AND 
ALSO COMMUNICATIONS WITH 

01:25:57.363 --> 01:26:01.660
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, DR. HILL, MR.
MORRISON, AND THEY ARE STAFFED 

01:26:01.871 --> 01:26:03.871
AT 

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:08.580
THE NFC. THEY KNEW WHAT WE WERE 
DOING, AND WHY. ON JULY 

01:26:11.806 --> 01:26:15.272
10th, 2019 SENIOR UKRAINIAN 
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS MET 

01:26:15.482 --> 01:26:17.482
WITH AMBASSADOR BOLTON, 
AMBASSADOR 

01:26:20.144 --> 01:26:24.421
VOLKER , SECRETARY PERRY, 
MYSELF, AND SEVERAL OTHERS IN 

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:30.101
WASHINGTON, D.C. DURING THAT 
MEETING WE ALL DISCUSSED THE 

01:26:30.307 --> 01:26:33.984
IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO ACTION 
ITEMS IDENTIFIED EARLIER. ONE, A

01:26:34.196 --> 01:26:38.984
WORKING PHONE CALL AND TWO, A 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING BETWEEN 

01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:44.747
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ZELENSKY.  
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THE JULY 

01:26:44.955 --> 01:26:47.203
10th MEETING WAS A POSITIVE STEP
TOWARDS ACCOMPLISHING OUR 

01:26:50.817 --> 01:26:53.258
SHARED GOALS. WHILE I AM NOW 
AWARE OF ACCOUNT OF THE MEETING 

01:26:53.476 --> 01:26:56.919
FROM DR. HILL AND LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL VINDMAN,  THE 

01:26:57.128 --> 01:27:00.184
RECOLLECTIONS SIMPLY DO NOT 
SQUARE WITH MY OWN. OR WITH 

01:27:00.391 --> 01:27:02.558
THOSE OF AMBASSADOR VOLKER 
SECRETARY 

01:27:07.419 --> 01:27:09.419
PERRY. 

01:27:13.366 --> 01:27:16.439
I DO NOT RECALL ANY YELLING OR 
SCREAMING OR ABRUPT TERMINATIONS

01:27:16.649 --> 01:27:21.508
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID. INSTEAD, 
AFTER THE MEETING, AMBASSADOR 

01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:26.405
BOLTON WALKED WALKED OUTSIDE 
WITH OUR GROUP AND WE ALL TOOK 

01:27:26.615 --> 01:27:32.882
GREAT PICTURES TOGETHER OUTSIDE 
ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. MORE 

01:27:33.093 --> 01:27:36.176
IMPORTANT, THOSE RECOLLECTIONS 
OF PROTEST DID NOT SQUARE WITH 

01:27:36.388 --> 01:27:38.388
THE 

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:42.388
DOCUMENTARY RECORD OF OUR 
INTERACTIONS WITH THE NFC IN THE

01:27:42.485 --> 01:27:47.527
DAYS AND WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED. WE
KEPT THE NFC APPRISED OF OUR 

01:27:47.736 --> 01:27:51.224
EFFORTS INCLUDING, SPECIFICALLY,
OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE A PUBLIC 

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:54.560
STATEMENT FROM THE UKRAINIANS 
THAT WOULD SATISFY PRESIDENT 

01:27:55.626 --> 01:27:57.626
TRUMP'S CONCERNS. FOR EXAMPLE, 
ON 

01:28:00.313 --> 01:28:02.420
JULY 13th, AND THIS IS THREE 
DAYS AFTER THE JULY 10th 

01:28:02.627 --> 01:28:04.627
MEETING, I EMAILED 

01:28:06.803 --> 01:28:13.946
TIM MORRISON. HE HAD JUST TAKEN 
OVER DR. HILL'S POST AND I MET 

01:28:14.159 --> 01:28:16.717
HIM THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME.
I WROTE TO MR. MORRISON WITH 

01:28:19.806 --> 01:28:25.316
THESE WORDS. "THE  CALL BETWEEN 
ZELENSKY AND POTUS  SHOULD 

01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:32.027
HAPPEN BEFORE 721 7/21, WHICH IS
THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS 

01:28:35.454 --> 01:28:39.533
IN UKRAINE." SOLE PURPOSE IS FOR
ZELENSKY TO GIVE POTUS  

01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:42.995
ASSURANCES OF NEW SHERIFF IN 
TOWN, CORRUPTION ENDING, 

01:28:43.204 --> 01:28:48.054
UNBUNDLING MOVING FORWARD AND, 
AND I EMPHASIZE, ANY HAMPERED 

01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:50.323
INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED 
TO MOVE 

01:28:53.532 --> 01:28:55.622
FORWARD TRANSPARENTLY. THE GOAL 
IS FOR POTUS TO INVITE HIM TO 

01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:02.790
THE OVAL. VOLKER, PERRY, BOLTON 
AND I  STRONGLY RECOMMEND. MR. 

01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:07.785
MORRISON ACKNOWLEDGED AND SAID 
TO YOU I THANK YOU AND NOTED 

01:29:08.003 --> 01:29:14.256
THAT HE WAS TRACKING THESE 
ISSUES. AGAIN, THERE WAS NO 

01:29:14.566 --> 01:29:16.566
SECRET REGARDING MOVING FORWARD 
AND THE DISCUSSION OF 

01:29:18.737 --> 01:29:21.384
INVESTIGATION. MOREOVER I'VE 
REVIEWED OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT 

01:29:21.593 --> 01:29:25.753
DOCUMENTS SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT 
IN THE CURRENT PUBLIC DOMAIN. 

01:29:25.967 --> 01:29:27.967
DETAILING MR. 

01:29:30.113 --> 01:29:33.566
GIULIANI'S EFFORTS. FOR EXAMPLE 
ON JULY 10th, THE VERY SAME DAY 

01:29:33.774 --> 01:29:37.559
THAT AMBASSADOR VOLKER COME 
SECRETARY PERRY , AND I WERE 

01:29:37.773 --> 01:29:39.773
MEETING WITH THE UKRAINE 
OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, 

01:29:40.670 --> 01:29:44.946

UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR. AND WHAT'S

A MEETING, 

01:30:06.066 --> 01:30:08.557
REFERRING TO THE UKRAINIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER. THE UKRAINIANS

01:30:10.133 --> 01:30:15.432
WERE "VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT 
WAS TOLD TO THEM, THAT ACCORDING

01:30:20.294 --> 01:30:22.169
TO RG, MEETING RUDY GIULIANI, 
THE ZELENSKY-POTUS MEETING WILL

GOOD GRIEF  PLEASE TELL THE DEAN

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.672
TO LET THE OFFICIAL U.S. 
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES SPEAK

01:30:29.876 --> 01:30:31.876
FOR 

01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:36.983
THE U.S. HE HAD HIS OWN SELF 
INTEREST. TAYLOR CONFIRMED HE 

01:30:37.764 --> 01:30:43.470
HAD ALREADY COMMUNICATED THAT TO
THE UKRAINIANS AND HE ADDED I 

01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:46.116
BRIEFED HIM THIS AFTERNOON ON 
THIS. REFERRING TO STATE 

01:30:48.939 --> 01:30:51.398
DEPARTMENT COUNSELOR OR QUILT. 
EVERYONE IS IN 

01:30:55.244 --> 01:30:57.271
THE LOOP. THREE THINGS ARE 
CRITICAL ABOUT THIS EXCHANGE. 

01:30:57.482 --> 01:31:00.532
FIRST WHILE THE UKRAINIANS WERE 
IN WASHINGTON, MR. 

01:31:03.567 --> 01:31:06.616
GIULIANI WAS COMMUNICATING WITH 
UKRAINIANS WITHOUT OUR 

01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:08.931
KNOWLEDGE. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND I  

01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:16.374
WERE ALL OF THIS, SECOND, MR. 
GIULIANI WAS COMMUNICATING WITH 

01:31:16.584 --> 01:31:18.584
THE 

01:31:20.429 --> 01:31:21.836
CORRUPT PROSECUTOR AND 
DISCUSSING WHETHER A 

01:31:21.837 --> 01:31:23.837
ZELENSKY-TRUMP MEETING WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN  AGAIN WITHOUT 

01:31:26.932 --> 01:31:28.932
OUR KNOWLEDGE. AND THIRD WITH 
THIS ALARMING NEWS, AMBASSADOR 

01:31:29.983 --> 01:31:33.042
TAYLOR BRIEFED ULRICH BRECHBUHL,
WHO WAS THE COUNSELOR  TO 

01:31:33.251 --> 01:31:37.512
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO. EVEN 
AS LATE AS SEPTEMBER 24th OF 

01:31:38.507 --> 01:31:44.837
THIS YEAR SECRETARY POMPEO WAS 
DIRECTING KURT VOLKER TO SPEAK 

01:31:45.044 --> 01:31:52.531
WITH MR. GIULIANI. IN A WHATSAPP
MESSAGE KURT VOLKER TOLD ME AND 

01:31:52.842 --> 01:31:58.486
PART SPOKE WITH RUDY PER 
GUIDANCE PER S, THAT IS THE 

01:31:58.697 --> 01:32:01.892
STATE DESIGNATOR FOR THE 

01:32:05.727 --> 01:32:07.994
STATE DEPARTMENT. WE TRIED OUR 
BEST TO FIX THE PROBLEM WHILE 

01:32:08.207 --> 01:32:13.481
KEEPING THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND
THE NFC CLOSELY APPRISED OF THE 

01:32:13.693 --> 01:32:19.581
CHALLENGES WE FACED ON JULY 
25th, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

01:32:19.788 --> 01:32:21.788
ZELENSKY HAD THEIR OFFICIAL 

01:32:23.808 --> 01:32:27.076
CALLS.  I WAS NOT ON THE CALL, I
DON'T THINK I WAS INVITED TO BE 

01:32:27.286 --> 01:32:31.330
ON THE CALL. IN FACT, I FIRST 
READ THE TRANSCRIPT ON SEPTEMBER

01:32:31.536 --> 01:32:36.278
25th, THE DAY IT WAS PUBLICLY 
RELEASED. ALL I HAD HEARD, AT 

01:32:37.013 --> 01:32:40.890
THAT TIME, WAS THAT THE CALL HAD
GONE WELL. LOOKING BACK, I FIND 

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:47.170
IT VERY ODD, VERY ODD THAT 
NEITHER I, NOR AMBASSADOR 

01:32:47.383 --> 01:32:51.647
TAYLOR, NOR AMBASSADOR VOLKER 
EVER RECEIVED A DETAILED  

01:32:51.856 --> 01:32:53.898
READOUT OF THE CALL WITH THE 

01:32:57.129 --> 01:32:59.374
BIDEN REFERENCES. NOW THERE ARE 
PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY HAD CONCERNS

01:32:59.581 --> 01:33:02.887
ABOUT THE CALL BUT NO ONE SHARED
ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE CALL WITH

01:33:03.095 --> 01:33:05.491
ME AT THE TIME WHICH, FRANKLY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL 

01:33:09.921 --> 01:33:12.413
TO KNOW. ON JULY 26, AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR, AMBASSADOR VOLKER  AND I

01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:16.852
WERE ALL IN CARE OF TO MEET WITH
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. THE TIMING 

01:33:17.065 --> 01:33:21.031
OF THAT TRIP IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
THE CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:25.179
AND ZELENSKY  WAS ENTIRELY, 
ENTIRELY COINCIDENTAL. THE KEY 

01:33:26.993 --> 01:33:30.264
OF MEETINGS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED 
WELL BEFORE THE DATE THAT THE 

01:33:30.475 --> 01:33:34.751
WHITE HOUSE FINALLY FIXED THE 
CALL. DURING OUR KEY OF MEETING 

01:33:34.959 --> 01:33:39.583
I DO NOT RECALL PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY DISCUSSING THE 

01:33:39.794 --> 01:33:43.234
SUBSTANCE OF HIS JULY 25th CALL 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. NOR DID HE

01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:48.121
DISCUSS ANY REQUEST TO 
INVESTIGATE VICE PRESIDENT 

01:33:48.329 --> 01:33:51.914
BIDEN, WHICH WE ALL LATER 
LEARNED WAS DISCUSSED ON THE 

01:33:52.122 --> 01:33:54.122
JULY 

01:33:55.228 --> 01:33:57.133
25th CALL. AND THIS IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTED 

01:33:57.134 --> 01:34:00.139
COMMENTS FROM AMBASSADORS VOLKER
AND TAYLOR.  AFTER THE ZELENSKY 

01:34:01.115 --> 01:34:04.182
MEETING  I ALSO MET WITH 
ZELENSKY'S SENIOR 

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.176
AIDE.  I DON'T RECALL THE 
SPECIFICS OF OUR CONVERSATION 

01:34:11.359 --> 01:34:13.359
BUT I BELIEVE THE ISSUE OF 
INVESTIGATIONS WAS PROBABLY 

01:34:13.405 --> 01:34:19.626
APART OF THAT AGENDA OR MEETING.
ALSO, ON JULY 26, SHORTLY AFTER 

01:34:19.837 --> 01:34:25.109
OUR KEY HAVE MEETINGS I SPOKE BY
PHONE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE 

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.540
WHITE HOUSE, WHICH IS FINALLY, 
FINALLY SHARED CERTAIN CALL 

01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:33.131
DATES AND TIMES WITH MY 
ATTORNEYS CONFIRMS THIS. THE 

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:37.345
CALL LASTED FIVE MINUTES. I 
REMEMBER I WAS AT A RESTAURANT 

01:34:37.556 --> 01:34:41.983
IN KIEV AND I HAVE NO REASON TO 
DOUBT THAT THIS CONVERSATION 

01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:44.759
INCLUDED THE SUBJECT OF 
INVESTIGATION. AGAIN, GIVEN MR. 

01:34:45.207 --> 01:34:49.303
GIULIANI'S DEMAND THAT PRESIDENT
ZELENSKY MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT

01:34:50.893 --> 01:34:52.893
ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS, I KNEW 
THAT INVESTIGATIONS WERE 

01:34:52.926 --> 01:34:56.733
IMPORTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE
DID NOT DISCUSS ANY 

01:35:00.435 --> 01:35:01.928
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. OTHER 
WITNESSES HAVE RECENTLY SHARED 

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:05.123
THE RECOLLECTION OF OVERHEARING 
THIS CALL. FOR THE MOST PART, I 

01:35:05.335 --> 01:35:08.771
HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT THEIR 
ACCOUNTS. IT IS TRUE THE 

01:35:08.978 --> 01:35:13.940
PRESIDENT SPEAKS LOUDLY AT TIMES
AND IT IS ALSO TRUE, I THINK WE 

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.589
PRIMARILY DISCUSSED A$AP ROCKY. 

01:35:49.337 --> 01:35:51.337
&gt;&gt;

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:57.927
&gt;&gt; GIVEN WHAT WE ARE HEARING FOR
MR. GIULIANI, HOWEVER I HAVE NO 

01:35:58.139 --> 01:36:00.141
RECOLLECTIONS OF DISCUSSING VICE
PRESIDENT BIDEN OR HIS SON ON 

01:36:00.348 --> 01:36:04.632
THE CALLER AFTER THE CALL. I 
KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THIS 

01:36:04.843 --> 01:36:06.843
COMMITTEE FREQUENTLY FRAME THESE

01:36:09.301 --> 01:36:11.507
COMPLICATED ISSUES IN THE FORM 
OF A SIMPLE QUESTION. WAS THERE 

01:36:11.718 --> 01:36:15.222
A QUID PRO QUO? AS I TESTIFIED 
PREVIOUSLY WITH REGARD TO THE 

01:36:15.429 --> 01:36:18.258

THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING, THE 

01:36:18.466 --> 01:36:24.754
ANSWER IS YES. MR. GIULIANI

PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT FROM 

01:36:33.884 --> 01:36:35.566
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY COMMITTING TO
INVESTIGATIONS OF BURISMA AND 

01:36:35.567 --> 01:36:40.487
THE 2016 ELECTION  MR. GIULIANI 
EXPRESSED THOSE REQUESTS 

01:36:40.704 --> 01:36:47.695
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT AND HE
ALSO EXPRESSED THOSE DIRECTLY TO

US. WE ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE
PREREQUISITES FOR THE WHITE 

01:36:51.147 --> 01:36:55.428
HOUSE CALL AND THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING REFLECTED PRESIDENT 

01:36:55.635 --> 01:36:57.635

ZELENSKY TO SAY THAT HE WILL

ANY SPECIFIC PERSONAL ISSUES IF 

01:39:25.802 --> 01:39:32.512

HOPEFULLY MAKE THE BOSS HAPPY 
ENOUGH, THE BOSS BEING THE

PRESIDENT, TO AUTHORIZE AN 
INVEST INVITATION. ZELENSKY

BURISMA.

MRS KENNA REPLIED GORDON I WILL 
PASS TO THE SECRETARY. EVERYONE 

01:41:15.965 --> 01:41:21.140
WAS IN THE LOOP. CURIOUSLY, AND 
THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME,

01:41:21.352 --> 01:41:25.399
ON AUGUST 26, SHORTLY BEFORE HIS
VISIT 

01:41:30.413 --> 01:41:33.552
TO HAVE, KIEV, AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON'S OFFICE REQUESTED THAT 

01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:38.017
MR. GIULIANI'S CONTACT 
INFORMATION FROM ME. I SENT 

01:41:38.226 --> 01:41:40.226
AMBASSADOR BOLTON THE 

01:41:43.593 --> 01:41:45.728
INFORMATION DIRECTLY. THEY 
REQUESTED MR. GIULIANI'S 

01:41:48.748 --> 01:41:50.748
CONTACT INFORMATION ON 

01:41:54.172 --> 01:41:57.687
AUGUST 26 I WAS FIRST INFORMED 
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS 

01:41:57.907 --> 01:41:59.907
WITHHOLDING SECURITY AID TO 

01:42:02.974 --> 01:42:05.409
THE UKRAINE DURING CONVERSATIONS
WITH AMBASSADOR TAYLOR ON JULY 

01:42:09.474 --> 01:42:13.207
18th. 2019. HOWEVER, AS A 
TESTIFIED BEFORE, I WAS NEVER 

01:42:13.423 --> 01:42:15.703
ABLE TO OBTAIN A CLEAR ANSWER 
REGARDING THE SPECIFIC REASON 

01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:20.064
FOR THE HOLD, WHETHER IT WAS A 
BUREAUCRATIC IN NATURE, WHICH 

01:42:21.459 --> 01:42:23.459
OFTEN HAPPENS, OR REFLECTED SOME

01:42:26.131 --> 01:42:28.766
OTHER CONCERN. I NEVER 
PARTICIPATED IN ANY OF THE 

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.976
SUBSEQUENT DOD OR DRS 

01:42:34.593 --> 01:42:37.246
REVIEW MEETINGS. THAT OTHERS 
HAVE DESCRIBED. SO I CAN'T SPEAK

01:42:37.455 --> 01:42:39.582
TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THOSE 
MEETINGS. NONETHELESS BEFORE THE

01:42:39.789 --> 01:42:43.999
SEPTEMBER 1st WARSAW MEETING 
UKRAINIANS HAVE BECOME AWARE 

01:42:44.215 --> 01:42:46.215
THAT SECURITY FUNDS HAD YET TO 

01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:54.157
BE DISPERSED. IN THE ABSENCE OF 
ANY CREDIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE

01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:58.839
HOLD I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION 
THAT THE AID, LIKE THE WHITE 

01:42:59.153 --> 01:43:03.368
HOUSE VISIT WAS JEOPARDIZED. IN 
PREPARATION FOR THE SEPTEMBER 

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:08.205
1st WARSAW MEETING, I ASKED 
SECRETARY POMPEO WHETHER A FACE 

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:11.247
TO FACE CONVERSATION BETWEEN 
TRUMP AND ZELENSKY  WOULD HELP 

01:43:13.662 --> 01:43:17.143
TO BREAK THE LOGJAM AND THIS WAS
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS STILL 

01:43:17.356 --> 01:43:23.817
INTENDING TO TRAVEL TO WARSAW. 
SPECIFICALLY, ON AUGUST 22nd, I 

01:43:24.028 --> 01:43:26.028
EMAILED SECRETARY POMPEO 
DIRECTLY 

01:43:30.852 --> 01:43:34.231
COPYING SECRETARY KENNA. I 
WROTE, THIS IS MY EMAIL TO 

01:43:35.805 --> 01:43:37.910
SECRETARY POMPEO. "SHOULD WE 
BLOCK TIME IN WARSAW FOR A SHORT

01:43:40.072 --> 01:43:44.772
PULL ASIDE FOR POTUS TO MEET 
ZELENSKY.  I WOULD ASK ZELENSKY 

01:43:44.979 --> 01:43:46.979
TO LOOK HIM IN THE EYE  AND 

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:52.469
TELL HIM THAT ONCE UKRAINE'S NEW
JUSTICE FOLKS ARE IN PLACE IN 

01:43:52.676 --> 01:43:54.676
MID-SEPTEMBER THAT 

01:43:56.119 --> 01:44:00.988
ZELENSKY  SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE
FORWARD PUBLICLY AND WITH 

01:44:01.199 --> 01:44:05.870
CONFIDENCE ON THOSE ISSUES OF 
IMPORTANCE TO POTUS AND THE U.S.

01:44:06.076 --> 01:44:09.745
HOPEFULLY, THAT WILL HELP BREAK 
THE LOGJAM. THE SECRETARY 

01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:17.042
REPLIED YES. I FOLLOWED UP THE 
NEXT DAY ASKING TO GET 10-15 

01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:21.158
MINUTES ON THE WARSAW SCHEDULE 
FOR THIS. I SAID, WE WOULD LIKE 

01:44:21.372 --> 01:44:24.889
TO KNOW WHEN IT IS LOCKED SO I 
CAN TELL ZELENSKY AND BRIEFED 

01:44:25.768 --> 01:44:27.768
HIM.  

01:44:29.436 --> 01:44:31.436
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY KENNA 
REPLIED, I WILL TRY FOR SURE.  

01:44:35.118 --> 01:44:37.159
MOREOVER, GIVEN MY CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE SECURITY AID, I HAVE 

01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:39.372
NO REASON TO DISPUTE THAT 
PORTION OF SENATOR JOHNSON'S 

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:43.740
RECENT LEVER LETTER IN WHICH HE 
RECALLS CONVERSATIONS THAT HE 

01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:47.338
AND I HAD ON AUGUST 30th. BY THE
END OF AUGUST MY BELIEF WAS IF 

01:44:47.546 --> 01:44:50.805
UKRAINE DID SOMETHING TO 
DEMONSTRATE A SERIOUS INTENTION 

01:44:51.014 --> 01:44:53.812
TO FIGHT CORRUPTION AND 
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING BURISMA 

01:44:55.241 --> 01:44:57.241
AND 

01:44:58.291 --> 01:45:00.291
THE 2016, THEN THE HOLD ON 
MILITARY AID WILL 

01:45:04.378 --> 01:45:06.378
BE LIFTED. THERE WAS A SEPTEMBER
1st MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 

01:45:06.489 --> 01:45:10.421
ZELENSKY IN WARSAW. 
UNFORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:12.750
ATTENDANCE AT THE WARSAW MEETING
WAS CANCELED DO TO HURRICANE 

01:45:12.958 --> 01:45:14.958
DORIAN. VICE PRESIDENT 

01:45:18.676 --> 01:45:20.980
PENCE ATTEMPTED ATTENDED 
INSTEAD. I MENTIONED VICE 

01:45:21.187 --> 01:45:23.187
PRESIDENT PENCE BEFORE THE 
MEETINGS AND THAT I HAD CONCERNS

01:45:23.327 --> 01:45:27.941
THAT THE DELAY IN AID HAD BECOME
TIED TO THE ISSUE OF 

01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:29.640
INVESTIGATION. I RECALL 
MENTIONING THAT BEFORE THE 

01:45:29.641 --> 01:45:34.258
ZELENSKY MEETING.  DURING THE 
ACTUAL MEETING, PRESIDENT 

01:45:34.466 --> 01:45:36.466
ZELENSKY RAISED THE ISSUE OF 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE RECTALLY 

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:39.931
WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
AND THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID HE 

01:45:40.139 --> 01:45:45.863
WOULD SPEAK TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ABOUT IT. BASED ON MY PREVIOUS 

01:45:46.074 --> 01:45:49.687
COMMUNICATION WITH SECRETARY 
POMPEO, I FELT COMFORTABLE 

01:45:49.914 --> 01:45:54.356
SHARING MY CONCERNS WITH MR. 
YERMAK.  IT WAS A VERY, VERY 

01:45:54.568 --> 01:45:56.568
BRIEF PULL ASIDE CONVERSATION 
THAT HAPPENED WITHIN 

01:45:59.425 --> 01:46:01.744
A FEW SECONDS. I TOLD MR. YERMAK
THEY BELIEVED THE RESUMPTION OF 

01:46:02.057 --> 01:46:06.225
U.S. AID  WOULD LIKELY NOT OCCUR
UNTIL UKRAINE TOOK SOME KIND OF 

01:46:06.436 --> 01:46:09.451
ACTION ON THE PUBLIC STATEMENT, 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR

01:46:12.634 --> 01:46:14.877
MANY WEEKS. AS MY OTHER STATE 
PERMIT COLLEAGUES HAVE TESTIFIED

01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:19.151
THIS SECURITY AID WAS CRITICAL 
TO UKRAINE'S DEFENSE SHOULD NOT 

01:46:19.367 --> 01:46:23.926
HAVE BEEN DELAYED. I EXPRESSED 
THIS VIEW TOO MANY DURING THIS 

01:46:24.138 --> 01:46:26.875
PERIOD BUT MY GOAL AT THE TIME 
WAS TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO 

01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:29.090
GET THE AID RELIEF TO BREAK 

01:46:33.476 --> 01:46:36.455
THE LOGJAM. I BELIEVED THE 
PUBLIC STATEMENT WE HAVE BEEN 

01:46:36.665 --> 01:46:38.640
DISCUSSING FOR WEEKS WAS 
ESSENTIAL TO ADVANCING THAT 

01:46:38.641 --> 01:46:41.513
GOAL. YOU KNOW, I REALLY REGRET 
THAT THE UKRAINIANS WERE PLACED 

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:48.801
IN THAT PREDICAMENT. BUT I DO 
NOT REGRET DOING WHAT I COULD TO

01:46:49.009 --> 01:46:51.009
TRY TO BREAK THE LOGJAM AND 
SOLVE 

01:46:54.682 --> 01:46:56.682
THE PROBLEMS. I MENTIONED AT THE
OUTSET THAT THROUGHOUT THESE 

01:46:56.884 --> 01:46:58.804
EVENTS WE KEPT STATE DEPARTMENT 
LEADERSHIP AND OTHERS APPRISED 

01:46:58.805 --> 01:47:02.841
OF WHAT WE WERE DOING. THE STATE
DEPARTMENT WAS FULLY INVOLVED IN

01:47:03.822 --> 01:47:07.080
OUR EFFORTS AND WAS AWARE THAT A
COMMITMENT TO INVESTIGATIONS WAS

01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:14.225
AMONG THE ISSUES WE WERE 
PURSUING. TO PROVIDE JUST TWO 

01:47:14.433 --> 01:47:19.289
EXAMPLES. ON JUNE 5th, THE DAY 
AFTER THE U.S.-EU MISSION POSTED

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:25.976
OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY, WE DID A 
MONTH EARLY, PHILIP REEKER SENT 

01:47:26.188 --> 01:47:30.637
AN EMAIL TO ME, TO SECRETARY 
PERRY AND OTHERS FORWARDING SOME

01:47:30.851 --> 01:47:32.851
POSITIVE 

01:47:34.491 --> 01:47:37.341
MEDIA COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY'S ATTENDANCE AT OUR 

01:47:37.557 --> 01:47:39.557
EVENT. HE WROTE AND I 

01:47:42.414 --> 01:47:44.116
QUOTE "THIS  HEADLINE 
UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE AND 

01:47:44.117 --> 01:47:46.117
TIMELINESS OF ZELENSKY'S VISIT 
TO BRUSSELS  AND THE CRITICAL, 

01:47:46.216 --> 01:47:50.950
AND THE CRITICAL, PERHAPS 
HISTORIC ROLE OF THE DINNER AND 

01:47:51.158 --> 01:47:53.158
ENGAGEMENT 

01:47:54.602 --> 01:47:56.262
GORDON COORDINATED. THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND 

01:47:56.263 --> 01:48:03.542
DEDICATION OF THIS EFFORT." 
MONTHS LATER ON SEPTEMBER 3rd I 

01:48:03.747 --> 01:48:05.747
SENT SECRETARY POMPEO 

01:48:08.825 --> 01:48:10.825
AN EMAIL TO EXPRESS MY 
APPRECIATION FOR HIS JOINING A 

01:48:11.022 --> 01:48:14.318
SERIES OF MEETINGS IN BRUSSELS 
FOLLOWING THE WARSAW TRIP. I 

01:48:16.143 --> 01:48:18.796
WROTE, MIKE, THANKS FOR 
SCHLEPPING IT TO EUROPE I THINK 

01:48:19.007 --> 01:48:22.463
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE 
CHEMISTRY SEEMS PROMISING REALLY

01:48:27.102 --> 01:48:28.982
APPRECIATE IT. SECRETARY POMPEO 
REPLIED THE NEXT DAY ON 

01:48:28.983 --> 01:48:34.832
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4th "ALL 
GOOD, YOU ARE DOING GREAT WORK 

01:48:35.042 --> 01:48:37.075
KEEP BANGING AWAY. STATE 

01:48:41.929 --> 01:48:43.923
DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP EXPRESSED 
TOTAL SUPPORT FOR OUR EFFORTS TO

01:48:43.924 --> 01:48:45.998
ENGAGE THE NEW UKRAINIAN 
ADMINISTRATION. LOOK AT NEVER 

01:48:46.209 --> 01:48:50.867
DOUBTED THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF 
STRENGTHENING OUR ALLIANCE WITH 

01:48:51.076 --> 01:48:53.076
UKRAINE. AND, AT 

01:48:55.538 --> 01:48:57.940
ALL TIMES, AT ALL TIMES OUR 
EFFORTS WERE IN GOOD FAITH AND 

01:48:58.153 --> 01:49:02.445
FULLY TRANSPARENT TO THOSE TEST 
WITH OVERSEEING THEM. OUR 

01:49:02.655 --> 01:49:04.655
EFFORTS WERE REPORTED 

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:09.553
AND APPROVED BUT NOT ONCE DO I 
RECALL ENCOUNTERING AN 

01:49:09.769 --> 01:49:13.906
OBJECTION. IT REMAINS AN HONOR 
TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE 

01:49:18.833 --> 01:49:20.833
UNITED STATES AS THE UNITED 
STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE 

01:49:21.034 --> 01:49:22.947
EUROPEAN UNION I LOOK FORWARD TO
ANSWERING THE COMMITTEE'S 

01:49:22.948 --> 01:49:24.948
QUESTIONS, 

01:49:26.216 --> 01:49:28.090
THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; WILL NOW PROCEED TO THE FIRST

01:49:28.091 --> 01:49:30.091
ROUND OF QUESTIONS AS DETAILED 
IN 

01:49:34.076 --> 01:49:36.429
THE MEMO, THERE WILL BE 45 
MINUTES OF QUESTIONS CONDUCTED 

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.636
BY THE CHAIRMAN OR MAJORITY 
COUNSEL FOLLOWED BY 45 MINUTES 

01:49:38.741 --> 01:49:40.741
FOR THE RANKING MEMBER OR 
MINORITY COUNSEL. FOLLOWING THAT

01:49:40.769 --> 01:49:42.769
UNLESS I SPECIFY ADDITIONAL TIME
WILL PROCEED UNDERNEATH A FIVE 

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.920
MINUTE RULE AND EVERY MEMBER 
WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO 

01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:49.940
ASK QUESTIONS. I RECOGNIZE 
MYSELF OF MAJORITY COUNSEL FOR 

01:49:49.941 --> 01:49:51.941
THE FIRST ROUND 

01:49:54.038 --> 01:49:56.140
OF QUESTIONS. MR. SONDLAND, 
THERE IS A LOT OF NEW MATERIAL 

01:49:56.347 --> 01:49:58.893
IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT  TO 
GET THROUGH. BUT I WANT TO START

01:49:59.103 --> 01:50:05.624
WITH A FEW TOPLINE QUESTIONS 
BEFORE PASSING IT OVER TO MR. 

01:50:05.836 --> 01:50:07.836
GOLDMAN. IN YOUR DEPOSITION YOU 
TESTIFIED YOU FOUND YOURSELF ON 

01:50:07.932 --> 01:50:11.129
A CONTINUUM THAT BECAME MORE 
INSIDIOUS OVER TIME. CAN YOU 

01:50:11.443 --> 01:50:16.186
DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS 
CONTINUUM OF INSIDIOUS NESTS? 

01:50:16.393 --> 01:50:24.111
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, WHEN WE LEFT 
THE OVAL OFFICE I BELIEVE ON MAY

01:50:24.319 --> 01:50:29.181
23rd, THE REQUEST WAS VERY 
GENERIC FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF 

01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:36.085
CORRUPTION AND A VERY VANILLA 
SENSE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE 

01:50:36.299 --> 01:50:38.734
OLIGARCH PROBLEMS IN THE UKRAINE
WHICH ARE LONG-STANDING 

01:50:38.943 --> 01:50:40.943
PROBLEMS. AS TIME 

01:50:42.587 --> 01:50:45.238
WENT ON, MORE SPECIFIC ITEMS GOT
ADDED TO THE MENU, INCLUDING THE

01:50:45.444 --> 01:50:47.444
BURISMA AND  

01:50:49.707 --> 01:50:55.406
2016 ELECTION MEDDLING, 
SPECIFICALLY THE DNC SERVER AND,

01:50:55.611 --> 01:50:57.611
OVER 

01:50:58.845 --> 01:51:02.515
THIS CONTINUUM A BECAME MORE AND
MORE DIFFICULT TO SECURE THE 

01:51:02.721 --> 01:51:05.479
WHITE HOUSE MEETING BECAUSE MORE
CONDITIONS WERE BEING PLACED ON 

01:51:05.689 --> 01:51:11.034
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE ON JULY 25th, 

01:51:11.241 --> 01:51:13.673
ALTHOUGH YOU WERE NOT PRIVY TO 
THE CALL, ANOTHER CONDITION WAS 

01:51:13.881 --> 01:51:16.723
ADDED.  THAT BEING THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THE BIDENS.  

01:51:16.931 --> 01:51:20.835
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT PRIVY TO THE CALL 
AND I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITION

01:51:21.192 --> 01:51:25.168
OF INVESTIGATING THE BIDENS AS A
CONDITION.  

01:51:25.169 --> 01:51:27.080
&gt;&gt; YOU SAW THAT ON THE CALL 
RECORD? 

01:51:27.081 --> 01:51:29.081
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT IN ANY RECORD 

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:33.223
I RECEIVED. 
&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU DID? 

01:51:33.224 --> 01:51:37.374
&gt;&gt; YES, I SAW THAT IN SEPTEMBER.
&gt;&gt; ON THIS CONTINUUM, THE 

01:51:37.591 --> 01:51:39.591
BEGINNING BEGINS ON MAY 23rd 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT INSTRUCTS YOU

01:51:39.721 --> 01:51:43.743
TO TALK TO RUDY? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

01:51:43.744 --> 01:51:47.182
&gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AS A 
DIRECTION BY THE PRESIDENT THAT 

01:51:47.391 --> 01:51:50.868
YOU NEED TO SATISFY THE CONCERNS
OF RUDY GIULIANI WOULD EXPRESS 

01:51:51.079 --> 01:51:52.769
TO YOU WITH THE PRESIDENT WANTED
TO UKRAINE? 

01:51:52.770 --> 01:51:56.335
&gt;&gt; NOT JUST ME BUT THE ENTIRE 
GROUP. 

01:51:56.336 --> 01:52:02.224
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU
CONFIRMED THERE WAS A QUID PRO 

01:52:02.439 --> 01:52:04.334
QUO BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETINGS AND THE INVESTIGATIONS 

01:52:04.335 --> 01:52:07.705
INTO BURISMA  AND THE ELECTION 
THAT GIULIANI WAS PUBLICLY 

01:52:07.918 --> 01:52:09.918
PROMOTING? 

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:14.222
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THE FACT YOU SAY OTHER SENIOR

01:52:14.434 --> 01:52:16.488
OFFICIALS IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND THE CHIEFS OF 

01:52:17.045 --> 01:52:21.734
STAFF'S OFFICE, INCLUDING MICK 
MULVANEY, SECRETARY POMPEO WERE 

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.249
AWARE OF THIS QUID PRO QUO THAT,
IN ORDER TO GET THE WHITE HOUSE 

01:52:26.456 --> 01:52:28.456
MEETING THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE 
THESE INVESTIGATIONS THE 

01:52:29.234 --> 01:52:31.234
PRESIDENT WANTED? 

01:52:33.291 --> 01:52:34.631
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THOSE, AGAIN, OUR 

01:52:34.632 --> 01:52:42.226
INVESTIGATIONS INTO 2016,  
BURISMA  AND THE BIDENS 

01:52:42.227 --> 01:52:44.227
&gt;&gt;  BURISMA, THE BIDENS DID NOT 
COME 

01:52:48.667 --> 01:52:52.693
UP.  TODAY I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT 
IT MEANS, I DID NOT KNOW AT 

01:52:57.608 --> 01:53:01.794
THE TIME. 
&gt;&gt; THEN ON JULY 26, YOU CONFIRM 

01:53:02.005 --> 01:53:03.703
YOU DID INDEED HAVE THE 
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 

01:53:03.704 --> 01:53:05.806
TRUMP OR FROM A RESTAURANT AND 
HAVE THAT DAVID HOLMES TESTIFIED

01:53:06.018 --> 01:53:09.726
ABOUT LAST WEEK TWO 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT, AND YOU HAVE NO 

01:53:09.935 --> 01:53:11.935
REASON TO DOUBT MR. HOLMES 
RECOUNTING OF YOUR CONVERSATION?

01:53:12.110 --> 01:53:15.623
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY PART OF MR. HOLMES'S
RECOUNTING THAT I TAKE EXCEPTION

01:53:15.949 --> 01:53:19.835
WITH IS I DO NOT RECALL 
MENTIONING THE BIDENS.  I DID 

01:53:20.051 --> 01:53:25.911
NOT ENTER MY MIND IT WAS BURISMA
AND THE 2016 ELECTION. 

01:53:25.912 --> 01:53:29.357
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT MR. HOLMES WOULD MAKE THAT 

01:53:29.567 --> 01:53:31.608
UP? IF YOU RECALL YOU SAYING 
THAT? 

01:53:31.609 --> 01:53:33.609
&gt;&gt; I NEVER RECALLED SAYING 

01:53:37.417 --> 01:53:40.328
THE BIDENS. 
&gt;&gt; FOR THE REST OF MR. HOLMES 

01:53:40.552 --> 01:53:44.004
RECOLLECTION IS CONSISTENT WITH 
YOUR OWN? 

01:53:44.005 --> 01:53:47.848
&gt;&gt; I CAN TESTIFY AS TO WHAT MR. 
HOLMES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HEARD

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:50.491
THROUGH THE PHONE I DON'T KNOW 
HOW HE HEARD THE CONVERSATION. 

01:53:50.702 --> 01:53:52.702
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH 

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:56.849
HIS TESTIMONY? 
&gt;&gt; VAGUELY YES. 

01:53:56.850 --> 01:53:59.370
&gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY EXCEPTION YOU 
TAKE IS TO THE MENTION OF THE 

01:53:59.575 --> 01:54:01.575
NAME BIDEN? 

01:54:03.283 --> 01:54:05.276
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU SAID IN YOUR 

01:54:05.277 --> 01:54:11.465
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING THAT NOT 
ONLY IS IT CORRECT THAT THE 

01:54:11.675 --> 01:54:13.675
PRESIDENT BROUGHT UP WITH YOU 
INVESTIGATIONS ON THE PHONE THE 

01:54:13.879 --> 01:54:17.996
DAY AFTER THE JULY 25th CALL FOR
YOU BEEN SURPRISED HAD HE NOT 

01:54:18.208 --> 01:54:20.591
BROUGHT THAT UP? 
&gt;&gt; WE HAD BEEN HEARING ABOUT IT 

01:54:22.175 --> 01:54:24.408
FROM RUDY AND WE PRESUMED RUDY 
WAS GETTING IT FROM THE 

01:54:24.619 --> 01:54:26.619
PRESIDENT. IT SEEMED LIKE A 

01:54:30.435 --> 01:54:32.435
LOGICAL CONCLUSION.

01:54:35.584 --> 01:54:37.584
&gt;&gt; HOLMES ALSO TESTIFIED YOU 
TOLD HIM THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:54:37.717 --> 01:54:40.794
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT UKRAINE BUT 
ONLY BIG STUFF THAT RELATES TO 

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.088
HIM PERSONALLY. I TAKE IT FROM 
YOUR COMMENT YOU DON'T DISPUTE 

01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:45.709
THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION? 
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE MADE THAT CLEAR IN 

01:54:45.919 --> 01:54:48.238
THE MAY 23rd MEETING THAT HE WAS
NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF UKRAINE

01:54:48.444 --> 01:54:51.192
AND WE HAD A LOT OF HEAVY 
LIFTING TO DO TO GET HIM TO 

01:54:55.081 --> 01:54:56.657
ENGAGE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T DISPUTE THAT PART 

01:54:56.658 --> 01:54:58.658
OF MR. HOLMES RECOLLECTION? 

01:55:02.126 --> 01:55:04.126
&gt;&gt; NO.

01:55:07.275 --> 01:55:09.798
&gt;&gt; IN AUGUST WHEN HE WORKED WITH
A RUDY GIULIANI AND A TOP 

01:55:10.009 --> 01:55:11.938
UKRAINIAN AID TO DRAFT A 
STATEMENT FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY

01:55:11.939 --> 01:55:13.413
TO ISSUE REGARDING 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO BURISMA , 

01:55:13.414 --> 01:55:15.850
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS REQUIRED
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE HE 

01:55:16.057 --> 01:55:18.597
WOULD GRANT THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY? 

01:55:18.806 --> 01:55:21.729
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THE UKRAINIANS UNDERSTOOD 

01:55:21.939 --> 01:55:23.939
THAT AS WELL? 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE 

01:55:26.987 --> 01:55:28.795
THEY DID.! YOU INFORMED 
SECRETARY POMPEO BUT THAT 

01:55:28.796 --> 01:55:30.455
STATEMENT AS WELL? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:32.456
&gt;&gt; LATER IN AUGUST 

01:55:35.922 --> 01:55:37.922
YOU TOLD SECRETARY POMPEO THAT 
ZELENSKY WOULD BE PREPARED TO 

01:55:38.023 --> 01:55:41.224
TELL PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT HIS 
NEW JUSTICE OFFICIALS  WOULD BE 

01:55:41.436 --> 01:55:43.436
ABLE TO ANNOUNCE MATTERS OF 
INTEREST TO THE PRESIDENT WHICH 

01:55:43.574 --> 01:55:47.365
COULD BREAK THE LOGJAM. WHEN YOU
SAY MATTERS OF INTEREST YOU MADE

01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:52.332
THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED, IS THAT 

01:55:52.333 --> 01:55:52.951
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. 

01:55:52.952 --> 01:55:56.436
&gt;&gt; THAT INVOLVED 2016 AND 
BURISMA OR THE BIDENS? 

01:55:56.437 --> 01:55:58.437
&gt;&gt;  2016 AND 

01:56:00.302 --> 01:56:02.079
BURISMA.  
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE TALKING HERE 

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.230
ABOUT BREAKING THE LOGJAM, 
LEAVING THE LOGJAM OVER THE 

01:56:06.794 --> 01:56:08.462
SECURITY SYSTEMS?? I WAS TALKING
LOGJAM GENERICALLY BECAUSE 

01:56:08.463 --> 01:56:12.017
NOTHING WAS MOVING. 
&gt;&gt; THAT INCLUDED SECURITY 

01:56:12.236 --> 01:56:14.236
SYSTEMS, DID IT NOT? 

01:56:16.348 --> 01:56:18.231
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; BASED ON THE CONTEXT OF THE 

01:56:18.232 --> 01:56:20.310
EMAIL THAT WAS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME YOU HAD DISCUSSED THESE 

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.050
INVESTIGATIONS WITH SECRETARY 
POMPEO WAS IT? 

01:56:23.051 --> 01:56:25.051
&gt;&gt; 

01:56:26.903 --> 01:56:28.379
NO. 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS AWARE OF THE 

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.380
CONNECTIONS YOU ARE MAKING 
BETWEEN THE INVESTIGATIONS AND 

01:56:30.417 --> 01:56:32.417
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING AND 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE? 

01:56:36.595 --> 01:56:40.542
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; DID HE EVER TAKE ISSUE WITH 

01:56:40.749 --> 01:56:43.347
YOU AND SAY THAT CONNECTION IS 
NOT THERE OR YOU ARE WRONG? 

01:56:43.348 --> 01:56:47.842
&gt;&gt; NOT THAT I RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE 

01:56:48.051 --> 01:56:50.051
ALSO HAD A 

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.480
CONVERSATION WITH VICE PRESIDENT
PENCE BEFORE HIS MEETING WITH 

01:56:53.491 --> 01:56:55.582
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IN WARSAW  
AND THAT YOU RAISED THE CONCERN 

01:56:55.789 --> 01:56:59.199
YOU HAD AS WELL THAT THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS BEING 

01:56:59.412 --> 01:57:02.172
WITHHELD BECAUSE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S DESIRE TO GET A 

01:57:02.376 --> 01:57:04.491
COMMITMENT FROM ZELENSKY TO  GO 
AFTER THESE 

01:57:08.542 --> 01:57:09.789
CRITICAL INVESTIGATIONS WHAT DID
YOU SAY? 

01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:11.790
&gt;&gt; I WAS IN A BRIEFING WITH 

01:57:15.447 --> 01:57:17.438
SEVERAL PEOPLE. THEN ON 
EVERYTHING IS STALLED UNTIL THE 

01:57:17.439 --> 01:57:20.799
STATEMENT GETS MADE. SOMETHING 
TO THAT EFFECT, AND THAT IS WHAT

01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:25.963
I BELIEVE TO BE THE CASE BASED 
ON, YOU KNOW, THE WORK THAT THE 

01:57:26.175 --> 01:57:29.076
THREE OF US HAD BEEN DOING. 
VOLKER, PERRY, AND MYSELF.  THE 

01:57:29.287 --> 01:57:34.162
VICE PRESIDENT NODDED THAT HE 
HEARD WHAT I SAID AND THAT WAS 

01:57:34.372 --> 01:57:39.428
PRETTY MUCH IT, AS I RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; AND, YOU UNDERSTOOD THE 

01:57:39.633 --> 01:57:43.723
UKRAINIANS WERE GOING TO RAISE 
THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE WITH THE

01:57:43.930 --> 01:57:48.914
VICE PRESIDENT AT THIS MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD

01:57:49.122 --> 01:57:51.122
RAISE BUT THEY IN FACT DID 

01:57:54.994 --> 01:57:57.359
RAISE IT. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS PUBLIC BY THAT POINT 

01:57:57.564 --> 01:57:59.328
THERE WAS A HOLD ON THE SECURITY
SYSTEMS? 

01:57:59.329 --> 01:58:02.474
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE
GOING TO RAISE, I DO NOT GET A 

01:58:02.677 --> 01:58:04.123
PRE-BRIEF. 
&gt;&gt; IN A THEY WERE CONCERNED 

01:58:04.124 --> 01:58:06.124
ABOUT THE HOLD ON SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE? ANYONE TO HELP. THE 

01:58:06.197 --> 01:58:08.412
VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE MEETING 
BY LETTING HIM KNOW WHAT YOU 

01:58:08.621 --> 01:58:10.698
THOUGHT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
HOLD ON THE SECURITY SYSTEMS TWO

01:58:10.906 --> 01:58:13.993
&gt;&gt; THAT IS FAIR. 
&gt;&gt; D RECALL ANYTHING ELSE THE 

01:58:14.199 --> 01:58:16.199
VICE PRESIDENT SAID HE SAID 
NODDING 

01:58:18.623 --> 01:58:20.623
HIS HEAD? 
&gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T HAVE A READOUT OF

01:58:20.839 --> 01:58:22.500
THAT MEETING SO I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE. 

01:58:22.501 --> 01:58:27.574
&gt;&gt; WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS 
MEETING THAT YOU WENT TO SPEAK 

01:58:27.782 --> 01:58:29.782
WITH YERMAK AND YOU TOLD HIM  

01:58:33.779 --> 01:58:36.152
SIMILARLY THAT IN ORDER TO 
RELEASE THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE 

01:58:36.368 --> 01:58:40.472
THEY WOULD HAVE TO PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCE THESE INVESTIGATIONS? 

01:58:40.684 --> 01:58:43.168
&gt;&gt; MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF THAT 
MEETING AND IT WASN'T REALLY A 

01:58:43.377 --> 01:58:45.283
MEETING. EVERYONE GOT UP AFTER 
THE BILATERAL MEETING BETWEEN 

01:58:45.284 --> 01:58:47.284
PRESIDENT 

01:58:48.683 --> 01:58:50.683
ZELENSKY AND VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE AND PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY 

01:58:50.882 --> 01:58:53.396
NORMALLY DO THEY GET UP, MILL 
AROUND, SHAKE HANDS  AND I DON'T

01:58:53.603 --> 01:58:56.944
KNOW IF I CAME OVER TO YERMAK OR
HE CAME OVER TO ME  AND HE SAID 

01:58:57.151 --> 01:58:59.865
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND I SAID 
I DON'T KNOW, IT MIGHT ALL BE 

01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:02.868
TIED TOGETHER I HAD NO IDEA, I 
WAS PRESUMING THAT IT WAS BLUES 

01:59:03.076 --> 01:59:05.076
A VERY SHORT CONVERSATION 
&gt;&gt; IN 

01:59:08.793 --> 01:59:13.476
THE CONVERSATION YOU INFORMED 
MR. GERLACH THAT THEY WOULD NEED

01:59:13.683 --> 01:59:16.112
TO ANNOUNCE THESE INVESTIGATIONS
IN ORDER TO GET THE 

01:59:20.979 --> 01:59:22.541
AID? 
&gt;&gt; ESTHER YERMAK WAS WORKING ON 

01:59:22.542 --> 01:59:24.011
THE INVESTIGATION OR THE 
STATEMENT ABOUT THE 

01:59:24.012 --> 01:59:27.318
INVESTIGATION  AND YOU 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU CONFIRMED FOR HIM HE 

01:59:27.534 --> 01:59:29.534
NEEDS TO GET IT DONE? 
&gt;&gt; 

01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:35.380
LIKELY 

01:59:37.034 --> 01:59:38.290
DID. 
&gt;&gt; LIVE ALSO RELATED THE 

01:59:38.291 --> 01:59:42.320
CONVERSATION YOU HAD WITH THE 
PRESENT FOLLOWING THE WARSAW 

01:59:42.525 --> 01:59:45.982
MEETING IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT 
RELAYED TO YOU THAT THERE WAS NO

01:59:46.193 --> 01:59:49.458
QUID PRO QUO, BUT NEVERTHELESS, 
UNLESS ZELENSKY WENT TO THE 

01:59:50.241 --> 01:59:52.241
MICROPHONE  AND ANNOUNCED 

01:59:54.095 --> 01:59:56.287
THESE INVESTIGATIONS, THEY WOULD
BE A STALEMATE OVER THE AID, IS 

01:59:56.945 --> 01:59:58.189
THAT CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:00.190
&gt;&gt; THAT IS 

02:00:03.579 --> 02:00:05.800
AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR 
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT?

02:00:06.014 --> 02:00:08.315
&gt;&gt; THAT EMAIL WAS NOT ARTFULLY 
WRITTEN, I WAS THE FIRST TO 

02:00:08.526 --> 02:00:10.526
ADMIT. WHEN I WAS TRYING TO 
CONVEY TO AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

02:00:10.616 --> 02:00:14.053
AFTER HIS FRANTIC EMAILS TO ME 
AND TO OTHERS ABOUT THE SECURITY

02:00:17.049 --> 02:00:19.439
ASSISTANCE, WHICH AGREED WITH 
HIM I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY BAD 

02:00:19.656 --> 02:00:24.169
IDEA TO HOLD THAT MONEY. I 
FINALLY CALLED THE PRESIDENT, I 

02:00:24.378 --> 02:00:28.568
BELIEVE IT WAS ON THE NINTH OF 
SEPTEMBER. I CANNOT FIND THE 

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:30.780
RECORDS AND THEY WILL PROVIDE 
THEM 

02:00:34.654 --> 02:00:39.857
TO ME. BUT I BELIEVE I JUST 
ASKED HIM AN OPEN ENDED 

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:42.350
QUESTION, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM 
UKRAINE I KEEP HEARING ALL THE 

02:00:42.559 --> 02:00:44.862
DIFFERENT IDEAS AND THEORIES AND
THIS AND THAT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

02:00:45.073 --> 02:00:47.384
IT WAS A VERY SHORT, ABRUPT 
CONVERSATION. HE WAS NOT IN A 

02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:50.205
GOOD MOOD. AND HE JUST SAID I 
WANT NOTHING, I WANT NOTHING I 

02:00:51.373 --> 02:00:53.655
WANT NO QUID PRO QUO. TELL 
ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING, 

02:00:53.863 --> 02:00:58.084
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.  SO I 
TYPED OUT A TEXT TO AMBASSADOR 

02:00:58.396 --> 02:01:02.772
TAYLOR AND MY REASON FOR TELLING
HIM THIS WAS NOT TO DEFEND WHAT 

02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.980
THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING. NOT 

02:01:07.221 --> 02:01:10.271
TO OPINE ON WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT WAS BEING TRUTHFUL OR 

02:01:10.478 --> 02:01:13.198
UNTRUTHFUL. BUT SIMPLY TO RELAY 
I GOT AS FAR AS I CAN GO. THIS 

02:01:13.408 --> 02:01:15.796
IS THE FINAL WORD I HEARD FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:21.005
UNITED STATES. IF YOU'RE STILL 
CONCERNED, IF YOU AND AMBASSADOR

02:01:21.196 --> 02:01:23.292
TAYLOR IS STILL CONCERNED PLEASE
GET A HOLD OF THE SECRETARY, 

02:01:23.499 --> 02:01:27.774
MAYBE HE CAN HELP. 
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT YOUR 

02:01:27.986 --> 02:01:29.973
TEXT MESSAGE I'M ASKING ABOUT 
YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH MR. 

02:01:29.974 --> 02:01:32.454
MORRISON AND AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
AFTER YOU SPOKE WITH THE 

02:01:32.662 --> 02:01:35.480
PRESIDENT ON THAT CALL FOR A 
DIFFERENT CALL. 

02:01:35.481 --> 02:01:38.104
&gt;&gt; I'M CONFUSED, WHICH 
CONVERSATIONS WITH MR. MORRISON 

02:01:38.315 --> 02:01:42.777
AND MR. TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; ESTHER MORRISON TESTIFIED 

02:01:42.985 --> 02:01:45.240
ABOUT A CONVERSATION YOU HAD 
WITH THE PRESIDENT IN WHICH THE 

02:01:45.453 --> 02:01:47.453
PRESIDENT TOLD YOU KNOW QUID PRO

02:01:51.903 --> 02:01:53.903
QUO. BUT, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
MUST GO TO A MICROPHONE AND 

02:01:54.092 --> 02:01:57.194
ANNOUNCED THESE INVESTIGATIONS 
AND THAT HE SHOULD WANT TO. 

02:01:57.424 --> 02:02:00.852
SIMILARLY YOU TOLD IN BASSETT OR
TAYLOR THAT WHILE THE PRESIDENT 

02:02:01.061 --> 02:02:05.040
SAID NO QUID PRO QUO UNLESS 
ZELENSKY ANNOUNCED THESE 

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:08.363
INVESTIGATIONS,  THEY WOULD BE 
EIGHT A STALEMATE, PRESUMABLY 

02:02:10.191 --> 02:02:12.677
OVER THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE, DO 
YOU HAVE ANY REASON 

02:02:16.289 --> 02:02:20.347
TO QUESTION THOSE CONVERSATIONS 
THAT MR. MORRISON AND AMBASSADOR

02:02:20.559 --> 02:02:23.397
TAYLOR TOOK NOTES ABOUT? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS TIED TO MY 

02:02:23.609 --> 02:02:26.242
TEXT. I THINK I SAID SOMETHING 
TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT 

02:02:26.453 --> 02:02:28.453
ZELENSKY TO DO 

02:02:30.098 --> 02:02:34.765
WHAT  TRANSPARENCY, ETC., ETC. 
WHICH WAS MY CLUMSY WAY OF 

02:02:34.975 --> 02:02:40.467
SAYING HE WANTED THESE 
ANNOUNCEMENTS TO BE MADE. 

02:02:40.468 --> 02:02:42.576
&gt;&gt; AGAIN NOT ASKING ABOUT THE 
TEXT MESSAGE, ASKING ABOUT WHAT 

02:02:43.299 --> 02:02:47.312
YOU RELAYED TO AMBASSADOR TAYLOR
AND MR. MORRISON ABOUT YOUR 

02:02:47.535 --> 02:02:51.265
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT.
YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO QUESTION 

02:02:51.475 --> 02:02:53.270
THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT YOU 
TOLD THEM? 

02:02:53.271 --> 02:02:58.549
&gt;&gt; ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I 
EXPRESSED WHAT I TOLD HER WHAT 

02:02:58.758 --> 02:03:00.758
THE PRESIDENT TOLD ME IN 

02:03:04.969 --> 02:03:07.793
THIS TEXT. IF I RELATE ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN IN THE TEXT I DON'T 

02:03:08.004 --> 02:03:09.059
RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T RECALL? 

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:12.795
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO REASON TO 

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.605
QUESTION AMBASSADOR TAYLOR MR. 
MORRISON AND WHAT THEY WROTE IN 

02:03:15.813 --> 02:03:17.813
THEIR NOTES ABOUT YOUR 
CONVERSATION 

02:03:20.672 --> 02:03:22.449
WITH THEM? 
&gt;&gt; COULD YOU KINDLY REPEAT WHAT 

02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:24.127
THEY WROTE? 
&gt;&gt; ALL HAVE MR. GOLDMAN GO 

02:03:24.128 --> 02:03:26.128
THROUGH. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD 

02:03:28.592 --> 02:03:30.474
BE GREAT. 
&gt;&gt; ALL GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE, 

02:03:30.475 --> 02:03:32.475
YOU 

02:03:34.077 --> 02:03:36.077
TESTIFIED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING THE PRESENT ZELENSKY 

02:03:36.317 --> 02:03:38.317
DESPERATELY WANTED, AND THAT WAS
VERY IMPORTANT  TO PRESENT 

02:03:38.421 --> 02:03:41.220
ZELENSKY  WAS THAT NOT? 
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. 

02:03:41.221 --> 02:03:47.308
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THAT MEETING 
WAS A QUID PRO QUO OR, WHAT THE 

02:03:51.961 --> 02:03:53.420
PRESIDENT WANTED INTO THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS? AND THAT 

02:03:53.421 --> 02:03:55.421
EVERYBODY KNEW IT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

02:03:59.206 --> 02:04:02.159
&gt;&gt; NOW, THAT WHITE HOUSE MEETING
WAS GOING TO BE AN OFFICIAL 

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:03.944
MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO 
PRESIDENTS, CORRECT? 

02:04:03.945 --> 02:04:05.616
&gt;&gt; PRESUMABLY. 
&gt;&gt; WOULD BE AN OVAL OFFICE 

02:04:05.617 --> 02:04:07.208
MEETING? 
&gt;&gt; WORKING MEETING. 

02:04:07.209 --> 02:04:10.153
&gt;&gt; AN OFFICIAL AX? 
&gt;&gt; GAL. 

02:04:10.154 --> 02:04:13.522
&gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO PERFORM THAT 
OFFICIAL ACT DONALD TRUMP WANTED

02:04:13.729 --> 02:04:16.982
THESE TWO INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
WOULD HELP HIS REELECTION 

02:04:18.764 --> 02:04:20.764
CAMPAIGN, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T CHARACTERIZE WHY HE 

02:04:21.814 --> 02:04:24.545
WANTED THEM ALL I CAN TELL YOU 
IS THIS IS WHAT WE HEARD FROM 

02:04:24.752 --> 02:04:28.717
MR. GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD TO GET THOSE TWO 

02:04:28.931 --> 02:04:30.931
INVESTIGATIONS IF THAT OFFICIAL 
ACT WAS GOING TO TAKE 

02:04:34.004 --> 02:04:35.706
PLACE, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; HE HAD TO ANNOUNCE THE 

02:04:35.707 --> 02:04:37.867
INVESTIGATIONS HE DID NOT HAVE 
TO DO THEM, AS I UNDERSTOOD. 

02:04:38.078 --> 02:04:42.052
&gt;&gt; OKAY, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD 
TO ANNOUNCE TWO INVESTIGATIONS 

02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:44.260
THE PRESIDENT WANTED? 

02:04:47.554 --> 02:04:49.554
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND THOSE WERE OF GREAT VALUE

02:04:49.691 --> 02:04:51.569
TO THE PRESIDENT, HE WAS QUITE 
INSISTENT UPON THEM? 

02:04:51.570 --> 02:04:53.972
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO CHARACTERIZE 
WHETHER THEY WERE VALUED OR NOT 

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:58.956
VALUED AGAIN, THROUGH MR. 
GIULIANI WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE 

02:04:59.047 --> 02:05:01.047
THAT THAT IS WHAT 

02:05:03.054 --> 02:05:05.054
HE WANTED. 
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID MR. GIULIANI WAS 

02:05:05.076 --> 02:05:06.512
ACTING AT THE PRESIDENT'S 
DEMAND? 

02:05:06.513 --> 02:05:08.941
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS TALK 
TO MY PERSONAL LAWYER MR. 

02:05:09.152 --> 02:05:13.814
GIULIANI WE TALKED TO HIM. 
&gt;&gt; THAT OFFICIAL ACT OF THAT 

02:05:14.124 --> 02:05:16.124
MEETING WAS BEING CONDITIONED ON
THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE THINGS 

02:05:16.262 --> 02:05:20.576
THE PRESIDENT WANTED AS 
EXPRESSED BOTH DIRECTLY AND 

02:05:20.783 --> 02:05:22.763
THROUGH HIS LAWYER, RUDY 
GIULIANI? 

02:05:22.764 --> 02:05:25.116
&gt;&gt; AS EXPRESSED THROUGH RUDY 
GIULIANI. 

02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:28.664
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE ALSO TESTIFIED THAT 
YOUR UNDERSTANDING, IT BECAME 

02:05:28.872 --> 02:05:31.713
YOUR CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT 
THE MILITARY SYSTEMS WAS ALSO 

02:05:31.919 --> 02:05:36.776
BEING WITHHELD PENDING ZELENSKY 
ANNOUNCING THESE  

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:40.058
INVESTIGATIONS? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY PERSONAL 

02:05:40.059 --> 02:05:44.285
PRESUMPTION BASED ON THE FACT AT
THE TIME. NOTHING WAS MOVING. 

02:05:44.493 --> 02:05:46.493
&gt;&gt; 

02:05:49.498 --> 02:05:51.918
IN FACT, YOU HAD A DISCUSSION IN
COMMUNICATION WITH THE SECRETARY

02:05:52.128 --> 02:05:55.069
OF STATE FOR YOU SAID THE LOGJAM
OVER AID COULD BE LIFTED IF 

02:05:55.275 --> 02:05:56.723
ZELENSKY ANNOUNCED THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS?  

02:05:56.724 --> 02:06:02.714
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL SAYING THE 
LOGJAM OVER AID, I RECALL THE 

02:06:02.928 --> 02:06:05.211
LOGJAM? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT YOU MEANT, RIGHT

02:06:05.421 --> 02:06:07.241
AMBASSADOR? 
&gt;&gt; I MEANT WHATEVER WAS HOLDING 

02:06:07.242 --> 02:06:09.242
UP 

02:06:10.284 --> 02:06:12.433
THE MEETING, WHATEVER WAS 
HOLDING UP OUR DEAL WITH UKRAINE

02:06:12.677 --> 02:06:15.794
I WAS TRYING TO BREAK. AGAIN, I 

02:06:19.017 --> 02:06:21.654
WAS PRESUMING -- 
&gt;&gt; HERE IS WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR

02:06:24.903 --> 02:06:27.316
TESTIMONY. "MICHAEL AT THE TIME 
WAS TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO 

02:06:27.524 --> 02:06:30.430
GET THE AID RELEASED TO BREAK 
THE LOGJAM. THAT IS STILL YOUR 

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:33.235
TESTIMONY RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; YEAH. 

02:06:33.236 --> 02:06:35.236
&gt;&gt; SO THE 

02:06:37.101 --> 02:06:39.954
MILITARY AID IS ALSO AN OFFICIAL
AX, AM I RIGHT? 

02:06:39.955 --> 02:06:41.955
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; THIS 

02:06:45.563 --> 02:06:48.006
IS NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT, THIS IS 

02:06:48.215 --> 02:06:50.098
400 MILLION OF U.S. TAXPAYER 
MONEY? IS IT NOT? 

02:06:50.099 --> 02:06:52.003
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. 
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LOGJAM IN WHICH 

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:55.601
THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT WRITE 
THE U.S. CHECK YOU 

02:06:59.236 --> 02:07:01.074
BELIEVED UNTIL UKRAINE ANNOUNCED
THESE TWO INVESTIGATIONS THE 

02:07:01.075 --> 02:07:04.529
PRESIDENT WANTED? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY BELIEF. 

02:07:04.530 --> 02:07:08.187
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. IN 
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT 

02:07:08.394 --> 02:07:11.647
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND,  YOU 
DETAILED THE BENEFITS THAT YOU 

02:07:12.243 --> 02:07:14.243
HAVE 

02:07:15.697 --> 02:07:17.403
GAINED FROM OBTAINING SOME 
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS OVER THE 

02:07:17.404 --> 02:07:22.542
PAST FEW WEEKS. IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF REFRESHING THE 

02:07:23.201 --> 02:07:25.201
RECOLLECTION. 
&gt;&gt; REVIEWING THESE DOCUMENTS HAS

02:07:29.714 --> 02:07:31.934
HELPED YOU TO REMEMBER THE 
EVENTS THAT WE ARE ASKING ABOUT,

02:07:32.141 --> 02:07:34.141
CORRECT? 

02:07:36.956 --> 02:07:38.956
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ACKNOWLEDGE OF COURSE 

02:07:39.072 --> 02:07:41.688
THAT WOULD YOU PLACE A DOCUMENT 
ANY DATE AND A CONTEXT IT HELPS 

02:07:41.901 --> 02:07:43.901
TO JOG YOUR MEMORY? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.! YOU WOULD 

02:07:43.985 --> 02:07:45.985
AGREE THAT FOR PEOPLE, UNLIKE 
YOURSELF, WHO TAKE NOTES THAT 

02:07:46.095 --> 02:07:50.022
THAT IS VERY HELPFUL TO THEIR 
OWN RECOLLECTION OF EVENTS? 

02:07:53.675 --> 02:07:55.251
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU ASKED HER 

02:07:55.252 --> 02:07:57.958
QUESTION BACKWARDS ARE YOU 
SAYING PEOPLE WHO TAKE NOTES IT 

02:07:58.167 --> 02:08:00.167
IS HELPFUL TO HAVE THOSE 
DOCUMENTS OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T 

02:08:00.253 --> 02:08:04.182
TAKE NOTES? 
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU ARE NOT A NOTETAKER 

02:08:04.395 --> 02:08:05.890
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; NOT A NOTETAKER NEVER HAVE 

02:08:05.891 --> 02:08:07.568
BEEN. 
&gt;&gt; YOU AGREE THAT PEOPLE WHO DO 

02:08:07.569 --> 02:08:10.590
TAKE CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES 
GENERALLY ARE MORE ABLE TO 

02:08:10.803 --> 02:08:13.189
REMEMBER THINGS THE PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T? 

02:08:13.190 --> 02:08:15.190
&gt;&gt; 

02:08:18.176 --> 02:08:21.137
SOME, YES. 
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE ADDITIONAL 

02:08:21.347 --> 02:08:23.447
DOCUMENTS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
UNABLE TO OBTAIN IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:08:23.657 --> 02:08:25.758
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU SAID IN YOUR 

02:08:25.966 --> 02:08:27.966
OPENING STATEMENT THAT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT PREVENTED YOU AND 

02:08:30.254 --> 02:08:32.462
YOUR STAFF FROM TRYING TO GATHER
MORE DOCUMENTS, IS THAT CORRECT?

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:34.930
&gt;&gt; CERTAIN DOCUMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; WHICH DOCUMENTS? 

02:08:34.931 --> 02:08:37.190
&gt;&gt; DOCUMENTS I DO NOT HAVE 
IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO. 

02:08:37.191 --> 02:08:40.409
&gt;&gt; WHO AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
PREVENTED YOU FROM DOING THAT? 

02:08:40.718 --> 02:08:46.093
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO ASK MY COUNSEL. 
&gt;&gt; BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL 

02:08:46.308 --> 02:08:48.966
MEMORY YOU HAVE GAINED OVER THE 
PAST FEW WEEKS FROM READING THE 

02:08:50.978 --> 02:08:52.978
TESTIMONY OF OTHERS BASED ON 
THEIR NOTES AND REVIEWING YOUR 

02:08:53.614 --> 02:08:56.886
OWN DOCUMENTS, YOU HAVE 
REMEMBERED A LOT 

02:09:00.116 --> 02:09:02.530
MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE 
DEPOSED IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:09:02.531 --> 02:09:06.619
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NOW 

02:09:06.827 --> 02:09:08.916
REMEMBER IS THE DISCUSSION YOU 
HAD WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON JULY

02:09:09.125 --> 02:09:12.525
26 AND THAT RESTAURANT IN KIEV. 
&gt;&gt; WERE TRIGGERED MY MEMORY 

02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:18.370
IS SOMEONE'S REFERENCE TO A$AP 
ROCKY WHICH WAS THE PRIMARY 

02:09:18.455 --> 02:09:22.694
PURPOSE OF THE PHONE CALL. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ONE WAY MEMORY WORKS 

02:09:25.305 --> 02:09:27.594
ISN'T IT? YOU WERE SITTING IN A 
RESTAURANT WITH DAVID HOLMES IN 

02:09:28.558 --> 02:09:34.030
CARE OF KIEV HAVING  LUNCH? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK I TOOK THE WHOLE TEAM

02:09:34.246 --> 02:09:37.079
OUT. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING 

02:09:37.290 --> 02:09:41.757
WITH ANDRIY YERMAK? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN,  TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT

02:09:41.966 --> 02:09:43.966
A VERY 

02:09:45.414 --> 02:09:50.323
BUSY DAY BUT IF SOMEONE SAID I 
HAD A MEETING AND I WENT TO THE 

02:09:50.532 --> 02:09:52.548
MEETING, I WILL NOT DISPUTE 
THAT. TWO PARTICULARLY IF THAT 

02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:55.782
PERSON TOOK NOTES? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

02:09:55.783 --> 02:09:57.783
&gt;&gt; OR SIT OUTSIDE 

02:09:59.432 --> 02:10:01.320
THE DOOR WHEN YOU DID NOT LET 
THEM IN? 

02:10:01.321 --> 02:10:03.993
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO CONTROL WHO GOES 
OVER INTO A MEETING IN UKRAINE, 

02:10:04.209 --> 02:10:06.209
THAT WAS THE 

02:10:08.566 --> 02:10:10.055
UKRAINIANS. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO MET WITH PRESIDENT 

02:10:10.056 --> 02:10:11.317
ZELENSKY AMONG OTHERS THAT DAY 
CORRECT? 

02:10:11.318 --> 02:10:13.780
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; Q CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM

02:10:13.986 --> 02:10:15.704
YOUR CELL PHONE FROM THE 
RESTAURANT? 

02:10:15.705 --> 02:10:17.705
&gt;&gt; 

02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:20.594
THAT'S RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS NOT A SECURE LINE? 

02:10:20.595 --> 02:10:24.406
&gt;&gt; NO, IT WAS AN OPEN LINE. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU WORRY THAT A FOREIGN 

02:10:24.619 --> 02:10:26.619
GOVERNMENT TO BE LISTENING TO 
YOUR 

02:10:29.088 --> 02:10:30.344
PHONE CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE UNCLASSIFIED 

02:10:30.345 --> 02:10:33.491
CONVERSATIONS ALL THE TIME FROM 
LANDMINES THAT ARE UNSECURED AND

02:10:34.975 --> 02:10:37.902
CELL PHONES. IF THE OBJECT IS 
NOT CLASSIFIED AND IT IS UP TO 

02:10:38.118 --> 02:10:43.407
THE PRESIDENT TO DECIDE WHAT IS 
CLASSIFIED AND NOT CLASSIFIED, 

02:10:43.617 --> 02:10:46.360
HE WAS AWARE IT WAS AN OPEN LINE
AS WELL. 

02:10:46.361 --> 02:10:51.229
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T RECALL THE 
SPECIFICS OF HOLDING YOUR PHONE 

02:10:51.438 --> 02:10:57.139
FAR AWAY FROM YOUR EAR AS MR. 
HOLMES TESTIFIED BUT, YOU HAVE 

02:10:57.345 --> 02:11:02.199
NO REASON TO QUESTION HIS 
RECOLLECTION OF THAT DO YOU? 

02:11:02.410 --> 02:11:04.942
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE 
THAT I WOULD HOLD MY PHONE HERE 

02:11:05.265 --> 02:11:09.702
I PROBABLY HAD MY PHONE CLOSE TO
MY EAR AND HE CLAIMS TO HAVE 

02:11:09.917 --> 02:11:11.792
OVERHEARD PART OF THE 
CONVERSATION AND I WILL NOT 

02:11:11.793 --> 02:11:13.460
DISPUTE WHAT HE DID OR DID NOT 
HEAR. 

02:11:13.461 --> 02:11:17.229
&gt;&gt; ALSO TESTIFIED THAT YOU 
CONFIRMED IT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:11:17.435 --> 02:11:20.703
THAT YOU WERE IN UKRAINE AT THE 
TIME AND THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY

02:11:24.346 --> 02:11:26.346
"LOVES 

02:11:27.792 --> 02:11:29.396
YOUR ASS." DO YOU RECALL SAYING 
THAT? 

02:11:29.397 --> 02:11:33.496
&gt;&gt; IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I 
WOULD SAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS 

02:11:33.706 --> 02:11:35.806
HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I 
COMMUNICATE A LOT OF FOUR LETTER

02:11:36.014 --> 02:11:38.014
WORDS, IN THIS CASE THREE 
LETTERS. [ LAUGHTER 

02:11:41.594 --> 02:11:43.163
] 
&gt;&gt; HOLMES THEN SAID HE HEARD 

02:11:43.164 --> 02:11:47.516
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED "IS  HE, 
MEANING ZELENSKY,  GOING TO DO 

02:11:47.945 --> 02:11:49.945
THE INVESTIGATION? TO WHICH 

02:11:51.743 --> 02:11:55.523
HE REPLIED? " HE IS GOING TO DO 
IT, AND THAT HE AS IT THAT 

02:11:55.733 --> 02:11:57.441
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WILL DO 
ANYTHING THAT YOU, MEETING 

02:11:57.442 --> 02:12:02.843
PRESIDENT TRUMP, ASK HIM TO." DO
YOU RECALL THAT? 

02:12:02.844 --> 02:12:04.936
&gt;&gt; I PROBABLY SAID SOMETHING TO 
THAT EFFECT BECAUSE I REMEMBER 

02:12:05.143 --> 02:12:07.143
THE MEETING THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY 

02:12:10.783 --> 02:12:15.572
WAS VERY SOLICITOUS AS I GET 
WORD, HE WAS JUST VERY WILLING 

02:12:15.781 --> 02:12:17.898
TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES 
AND, WAS BEING VERY AMICABLE 

02:12:18.776 --> 02:12:22.694
AND, SO, PUTTING IT IN TRUMP'S 
SPEAK BY SAYING HE LOVES 

02:12:25.882 --> 02:12:28.502
YOUR ASS HE WILL DO WHATEVER YOU
WANT MEANS THAT HE WILL REALLY 

02:12:28.713 --> 02:12:30.603
WORK WITH US ON A WHOLE HOST OF 
ISSUES. 

02:12:30.604 --> 02:12:32.701
&gt;&gt; WAS NOT ONLY WILLING, HE WAS 
VERY EAGER RIGHT? 

02:12:32.702 --> 02:12:36.601
&gt;&gt; THAT'S FAIR. 
&gt;&gt; UKRAINE DEPENDS ON THE UNITED

02:12:36.806 --> 02:12:38.895
STATES AS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT 
ALLY, ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 

02:12:38.896 --> 02:12:42.353
&gt;&gt; ONE OF ITS MOST, ABSOLUTELY. 
&gt;&gt; JUST SO 

02:12:45.984 --> 02:12:50.935
WE UNDERSTAND, YOU WERE IN CARE 
OF KIEV THE DAY AFTER PRESIDENT 

02:12:55.327 --> 02:12:57.542
TRUMP  SPOKE TO PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND YOU NOW KNOW FROM 

02:12:57.790 --> 02:13:03.420
READING THE CALL RECORD THAT HE 
REQUESTED A FAVOR FOR PRESIDENT 

02:13:03.630 --> 02:13:08.463
ZELENSKY TO DO INVESTIGATIONS 
RELATED TO THE BIDENS  AND THE 

02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:10.793
2016 ELECTION, RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOW KNOW THAT, YES. 

02:13:10.794 --> 02:13:14.246
&gt;&gt; YOU MET WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND HIS AIDES ON THE 

02:13:14.454 --> 02:13:17.098
DAY AFTER THAT PHONE CALL AND 
THEN YOU HAD A PHONE CALL WITH 

02:13:17.308 --> 02:13:19.308
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM YOUR CELL 
PHONE FROM A RESTAURANT TERRACE 

02:13:19.514 --> 02:13:23.363
AND HE ASKED WHETHER PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY WILL DO THE 

02:13:23.573 --> 02:13:27.834
INVESTIGATIONS? AND HE RESPONDED
THAT HE IS GOING TO DO THEM OR 

02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:31.740
IT. AND THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
WILL DO ANYTHING YOU ASK HIM TO 

02:13:31.952 --> 02:13:35.975
DO. IS THAT AN ACCURATE 
RECITATION OF WHAT 

02:13:39.616 --> 02:13:41.616
HAPPENED THERE? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T EVER MY 

02:13:44.084 --> 02:13:46.084
EXACT RESPONSE. YOU HAVE NO 
REASON TO DISPUTE MR. HOLMES 

02:13:46.193 --> 02:13:48.394
RECOLLECTION? CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I WON'T DISPUTE IT BUT AGAIN,

02:13:48.602 --> 02:13:52.619
I DON'T RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; AFTER YOU HUNG UP WITH THE 

02:13:52.825 --> 02:13:54.710
PRESIDENT MR. HOLMES TESTIFIED 
ABOUT A CONVERSATION THAT YOU 

02:13:54.711 --> 02:14:01.675
AND HE HAD WHERE HE SAYS THAT 
YOU TOLD MR. HOLMES THAT THE 

02:14:01.893 --> 02:14:04.442
PRESIDENT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT 
UKRAINE BUT, THE PRESIDENT 

02:14:07.444 --> 02:14:09.444
USE THE MORE COLORFUL LANGUAGE 
INCLUDING A FOUR LETTER WORD 

02:14:09.531 --> 02:14:12.041
THAT YOU JUST REFERENCE TO DO 
YOU RECALL SAYING THAT TO 

02:14:16.924 --> 02:14:18.924
MR. HOLMES? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL MY EXACT WORDS

02:14:19.071 --> 02:14:21.071
BUT CLEARLY 

02:14:23.090 --> 02:14:26.339
THE PRESIDENT WHERE HE MET WITH 
THE OVAL OFFICE WAS NOT A BIG 

02:14:26.547 --> 02:14:28.547
FAN. 
&gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A BIG FAN OF THE 

02:14:28.626 --> 02:14:32.034
INVESTIGATIONS? 
&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY SO. 

02:14:32.035 --> 02:14:36.227
&gt;&gt; IN FACT MR. HOLMES SAID THAT 
YOU SAID THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:14:36.432 --> 02:14:41.159
ONLY CARES ABOUT THE "BIG STUFF 
THAT FITS HIMSELF, IS THAT 

02:14:41.367 --> 02:14:44.829
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD'VE SAID
AT THE TIME? 

02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:49.520
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE 
SAID THAT. I WOULD'VE HONESTLY 

02:14:49.743 --> 02:14:52.783
SAID THAT HE WAS NOT A BIG FAN 
OF THE UKRAINE AND HE WAS THE 

02:14:52.989 --> 02:14:54.777
INVESTIGATIONS WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME 

02:14:54.778 --> 02:14:57.199
TIME TO MOVE FORWARD IS WHAT I 
WOULD'VE SAID BECAUSE THAT IS 

02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:00.064
THE FACT. 
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES ALSO REMEMBERS 

02:15:00.065 --> 02:15:02.065
THAT YOU 

02:15:03.302 --> 02:15:05.302
TOLD HIM GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF 
THE 

02:15:08.376 --> 02:15:10.376
BIG STUFF, THE BIDEN 
INVESTIGATION THAT RUDY GIULIANI

02:15:11.427 --> 02:15:14.289
WAS PUSHING, DO YOU RECALL THAT?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T I RECALL BURISMA, NOT

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.080
BIDEN.  

02:15:18.948 --> 02:15:20.948
&gt;&gt; DO YOU RECALL THE 

02:15:24.423 --> 02:15:26.322
INVESTIGATION THAT RUDY GIULIANI
WAS PUSHING? IS THAT SOMETHING 

02:15:26.323 --> 02:15:29.707
YOU LIKELY WOULD'VE SAID? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD, YES. 

02:15:29.708 --> 02:15:31.708
&gt;&gt; NOW, EVEN IF YOU DON'T 

02:15:33.978 --> 02:15:35.225
RECALL SPECIFICALLY SPECIFICALLY
MENTIONING THE BIDEN 

02:15:35.226 --> 02:15:37.226
INVESTIGATION TO 

02:15:38.446 --> 02:15:40.650
DAVID HOLMES WE KNOW THAT IT WAS
CERTAINLY ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

02:15:40.857 --> 02:15:44.365
MIND BECAUSE JUST THE DAY BEFORE
AND HIS TRUMP WITH PRESENT 

02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:48.401
ZELENSKY  HE MENTIONS, 
SPECIFICALLY THE BIDEN 

02:15:48.608 --> 02:15:52.872
INVESTIGATION. I WANT TO SHOW 
YOU THAT EXHIBIT OR THAT EGGS 

02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:55.080
ARE FROM THE CALL ON 

02:15:57.872 --> 02:16:00.947
JULY 25th. EXCERPT FROM THE CALL
ON JULY 25th. WHERE THEY 

02:16:05.802 --> 02:16:11.501
SAY THAT THE OTHER THING THERE'S
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BIDEN'S SON 

02:16:11.708 --> 02:16:13.795
AND THAT BIDEN STOP THE 
PROSECUTION A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT

02:16:14.241 --> 02:16:16.545
TO FIND OUT ABOUT THAT SO 
WHATEVER YOU COULD DO WITH THE 

02:16:16.755 --> 02:16:18.755
ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE GREAT.
BIDEN WENT AROUND BRAGGING THAT 

02:16:18.843 --> 02:16:21.488
HE STOPPED THE PROSECUTION SO IF
YOU CAN LOOK INTO IT, IT SOUNDS 

02:16:21.698 --> 02:16:23.599
HORRIBLE TO ME. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY THEN RESPONDS WITH A 

02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.684
REFERENCE TO THE COMPANY THAT HE
IS REFERRING TO AND TWO 

02:16:25.891 --> 02:16:27.612
WITNESSES YESTERDAY SAID THAT 
WHEN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY ACTUALLY

02:16:27.613 --> 02:16:29.641
SAID THE COMPANY HE SAID 
BURISMA.  

02:16:33.689 --> 02:16:35.730
SO, YOU WOULD AGREE THAT 
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU KNEW 

02:16:35.937 --> 02:16:38.178
ABOUT THE CONNECTION TO THE 
BIDEN'S, AT THE VERY LEAST THAT 

02:16:38.387 --> 02:16:42.073
YOU NOW KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED AT 

02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:48.259
THE TIME THROUGH THE BURISMA 
INVESTIGATION? 

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:51.796
&gt;&gt; I NOW KNOW IT ALL, OF COURSE.
&gt;&gt; AT THIS TIME YOU WERE AWARE 

02:16:52.003 --> 02:16:57.594
OF THE PRESIDENT'S DESIRE, ALONG
WITH RUDY GIULIANI, TO DO THESE 

02:16:57.802 --> 02:17:01.539
INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE 
2016 ELECTION INTERFERENCE 

02:17:01.748 --> 02:17:04.781
INVESTIGATION, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

02:17:04.782 --> 02:17:06.782
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 

02:17:10.259 --> 02:17:12.669
DIRECTED YOU, YOU AND A COUPLE 
OTHERS, TO TALK TO RUDY GIULIANI

02:17:12.873 --> 02:17:16.553
AT THE OVAL OFFICE ON MAY 23rd? 
IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:17:16.554 --> 02:17:18.842
&gt;&gt; IF WE WANTED TO GET ANYTHING 
DONE WITH UKRAINE IT WAS 

02:17:19.049 --> 02:17:23.373
APPARENT TO US WE NEEDED TO TALK
TO RUDY. 

02:17:23.374 --> 02:17:25.259
&gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT MR. 
GIULIANI SPOKE FOR THE 

02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:26.310
PRESIDENT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

02:17:26.311 --> 02:17:30.418
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO
MADE THAT CLEAR TO PRESIDENT 

02:17:30.627 --> 02:17:33.012
ZELENSKY IN THAT SAME JULY 25th 
PHONE CALL. 

02:17:38.012 --> 02:17:42.622
HE SAID "MR. GIULIANI IS A 
HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN, HE WAS THE

02:17:42.836 --> 02:17:46.445
MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, A GREAT 
PAIR AND I WOULD LIKE HIM TO 

02:17:46.655 --> 02:17:49.151
CALL YOU. I WILL ASK HIM TO CALL
YOU ALONG WITH THE ATTORNEY 

02:17:49.358 --> 02:17:51.736
GENERAL. RUDY VERY MUCH KNOWS 
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND HE IS A 

02:17:51.946 --> 02:17:56.308
VERY CAPABLE GUY." AFTER THIS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THEN MENTIONS 

02:17:56.518 --> 02:18:03.296
MR. GIULIANI TWICE MORE IN THAT 
CALL. NOW, FOR MR. GIULIANI, AT 

02:18:03.671 --> 02:18:08.553
THIS POINT, YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT 
IN ORDER TO GET THE WHITE HOUSE 

02:18:08.762 --> 02:18:10.647
MEETING THAT YOU WANTED 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO HAVE AND 

02:18:10.648 --> 02:18:12.648
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
DESPERATELY WANTED 

02:18:15.659 --> 02:18:17.659
TO HAVE, THAT UKRAINE WOULD HAVE
TO INITIATE THESE TWO 

02:18:17.844 --> 02:18:19.926
INVESTIGATIONS, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THEY WOULD HAVE TO ANNOUNCE 

02:18:20.137 --> 02:18:22.137
THEY ARE GOING TO DO 

02:18:25.202 --> 02:18:26.349
IT. 
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE GIULIANI AND 

02:18:26.350 --> 02:18:28.455
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT CARE IF 
THEY ACTUALLY DID THEM? 

02:18:28.456 --> 02:18:32.552
&gt;&gt; I NEVER HEARD MR. GOLDMAN 
ANYONE SAY THAT THE 

02:18:32.764 --> 02:18:35.388
INVESTIGATIONS HAD TO START OR 
BE COMPLETED. THE ONLY THING I 

02:18:35.595 --> 02:18:39.246
HEARD FROM MR. GIULIANI OR 
OTHERWISE WAS THAT THEY HAD TO 

02:18:39.452 --> 02:18:43.908
BE ANNOUNCED IN SOME FORM AND 
THAT FORM KEPT CHANGING. 

02:18:43.909 --> 02:18:45.529
&gt;&gt; ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY? 
&gt;&gt; ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY. 

02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:49.812
&gt;&gt; YOU WILL, OF COURSE REALIZE 
THERE WOULD BE BENEFITS FOR A 

02:18:50.022 --> 02:18:52.022
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT AS OPPOSED 
TO A 

02:18:56.008 --> 02:18:58.564
PRIVATE. 
&gt;&gt; THEY HAD A LONG HISTORY OF 

02:18:58.773 --> 02:19:00.674
COMMITTING TO THINGS PRIVATELY 
AND THEN NEVER FOLLOWING THROUGH

02:19:00.675 --> 02:19:02.366
IS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, PRESUMABLY, AGAIN 

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:04.367
COMMUNICATED THROUGH 

02:19:05.625 --> 02:19:07.983
MR. GIULIANI, WANTED UKRAINIANS 
ON RECORD, PUBLICLY, THAT THEY 

02:19:08.195 --> 02:19:10.995
WOULD DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU NEVER HEARD 

02:19:14.392 --> 02:19:16.424
ANYONE SAY THAT THEY REALLY 
WANTED THEM TO DO THE 

02:19:16.634 --> 02:19:18.634
INVESTIGATIONS? 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT HEAR 

02:19:22.648 --> 02:19:25.584
EITHER WAY. 
&gt;&gt; NOW, YOUR JULY 26 CALL WITH 

02:19:25.971 --> 02:19:29.225
THE PRESIDENT WASN'T THE ONLY 
TIME HE SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT 

02:19:29.430 --> 02:19:31.255
SURROUNDING THE UKRAINE TRIP WAS
IT? 

02:19:31.256 --> 02:19:33.899
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE I SPOKE TO HIM 
BEFORE 

02:19:37.336 --> 02:19:40.402
THIS CALL. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE JULY 25th? 

02:19:40.403 --> 02:19:44.056
&gt;&gt; I THINK I WAS FLYING TO 
UKRAINE AND I SPOKE WITH HIM, IF

02:19:44.267 --> 02:19:46.267
I 

02:19:49.257 --> 02:19:52.204
RECALL CORRECTLY, THIS BEFORE I 
GOT ON THE PLANE. 

02:19:52.205 --> 02:19:54.205
&gt;&gt; DOES TWO PRIVATE TELEPHONE 
CALLS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 

02:19:54.316 --> 02:19:56.239
THE SPAN OF TWO DAYS. CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.488
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD DIRECT ACCESS TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

02:19:58.489 --> 02:20:02.774
&gt;&gt; I HAD OCCASIONAL ACCESS WHEN 
HE CHOSE TO TAKE MY CALLS. 

02:20:02.987 --> 02:20:06.390
SOMETIMES HE WOULD, SOMETIMES HE
WOULDN'T. 

02:20:06.391 --> 02:20:08.843
&gt;&gt; HE CERTAINLY TOOK YOUR CALL 
TWICE AS IT RELATED TO UKRAINE 

02:20:09.044 --> 02:20:15.333
ON THIS DAY. ON THE MORNING OF 
JULY 25th, YOU TEXTED AMBASSADOR

02:20:18.574 --> 02:20:21.422
VOLKER,  WE CAN BRING UP THE 
NEXT TEXT EXCHANGE AT 7:54 A.M. 

02:20:21.628 --> 02:20:23.628
AND YOU SAID 

02:20:27.038 --> 02:20:29.038
CALL ASAP.

02:20:30.754 --> 02:20:32.754
AMBASSADOR VOLKER DID NOT 
RESPOND TO YOU FOR ANOTHER HOUR 

02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:35.350
AND A HALF AND HE SAID HI 
GORDON, GOT YOUR MESSAGE HAD A 

02:20:35.556 --> 02:20:37.797
GREAT LUNCH WITH YERMAK AND 
PASTOR MESSAGE  TO HIM. HE WILL 

02:20:37.995 --> 02:20:39.995
SEE YOU TOMORROW, THINK 
EVERYTHING IN PLACE. VOLKER  AN 

02:20:40.143 --> 02:20:42.143
HOUR BEFORE THAT 

02:20:44.984 --> 02:20:47.113
HAD TEXTED ANDRIY YERMAK, A TOP 
AIDE FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND 

02:20:47.311 --> 02:20:49.311
WROTE " GOOD LUNCH, THANKS. 
HEARD FROM 

02:20:54.051 --> 02:20:56.818
WHITE HOUSE ASSUMING PRESIDENT Z
CONVINCES PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT 

02:20:57.019 --> 02:20:59.233
HE WILL INVESTIGATE AND GET TO 
THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 

02:20:59.445 --> 02:21:01.841
2016, WE WILL NAIL DOWN DATE FOR
VISIT TO WASHINGTON. GOOD LUCK, 

02:21:02.041 --> 02:21:04.078
SEE YOU TOMORROW." WAS THIS 
MESSAGE THAT VOLKER PASSED  

02:21:07.319 --> 02:21:10.169
TO ANDRIY YERMAK, THE MESSAGE 
YOU LEFT FOR KURT VOLKER  ON THE

02:21:10.369 --> 02:21:14.638
MESSAGE HE REFERENCED? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T REMEMBER MR. GOLDMAN 

02:21:14.841 --> 02:21:17.809
VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO 

02:21:18.024 --> 02:21:21.777
THINK IT WASN'T? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, HONESTLY, HONESTLY 

02:21:21.984 --> 02:21:23.784
DON'T REMEMBER BUT IT SEEMS 
LOGICAL TO ME. 

02:21:23.785 --> 02:21:25.785
&gt;&gt; AND 

02:21:28.993 --> 02:21:32.745
IF AMBASSADOR VOLCKER DID 
TESTIFY THAT HE GOT THAT FROM 

02:21:32.943 --> 02:21:34.566
YOU? 
&gt;&gt; IF HE TESTIFIED THAT HE GOT 

02:21:34.567 --> 02:21:37.005
THAT FOR ME I WOULD CONCUR. 
&gt;&gt; SAID THIS MESSAGE IS WHAT YOU

02:21:37.214 --> 02:21:39.214
RECEIVED FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP IN
THAT PHONE CALL THAT MORNING? 

02:21:39.250 --> 02:21:43.282
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, IF HE TESTIFIED TO 
THAT, THEN YES, LIKELY I 

02:21:43.482 --> 02:21:46.320
WOULD'VE RECEIVED THAT FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

02:21:46.321 --> 02:21:47.753
&gt;&gt; BUT THE SEQUENCE CERTAINLY 
MAKES SENSE? 

02:21:47.754 --> 02:21:50.489
&gt;&gt; IT DOES.! YOU TALK TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, TOLD 

02:21:53.636 --> 02:21:55.877
KURT VOLKER TO CALL YOU, LEFT A 
MESSAGE, HE SAID THIS TEXT 

02:21:56.085 --> 02:22:00.254
MESSAGE TO ANDRIY YERMAK TO 
PREPARE  PRESENT ZELENSKY AND 

02:22:00.463 --> 02:22:04.202
THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP  HAD A 
PHONE CALL WHERE PRESIDENT 

02:22:04.413 --> 02:22:06.464
ZELENSKY SPOKE SIMILAR TO WHAT 
WAS IN THIS TEXT MESSAGE? AND 

02:22:06.665 --> 02:22:09.967
YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE MESSAGE
IS EXPRESSED HERE IS THAT 

02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:15.330
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY NEEDS TO 
CONVINCE TRUMP THAT HE WILL DO 

02:22:15.399 --> 02:22:17.815
THE INVESTIGATIONS IN ORDER TO 
NAIL DOWN THE DATE FOR A VISIT 

02:22:18.023 --> 02:22:20.023
TO 

02:22:21.051 --> 02:22:22.230
WASHINGTON, D.C. IS THAT 
CORRECT? 

02:22:22.231 --> 02:22:24.231
&gt;&gt; THAT 

02:22:27.267 --> 02:22:30.802
IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL MOVE AHEAD IN TIME TO 

02:22:31.014 --> 02:22:36.103
EARLY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER WHEN 
YOU CAME TO BELIEVE THAT IT 

02:22:36.296 --> 02:22:40.352
WASN'T JUST THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING THAT WAS CONTINGENT ON 

02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:44.143
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE 

02:22:44.352 --> 02:22:47.669
PRESIDENT WANTED FOR SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE AS WELL. YOU 

02:22:47.871 --> 02:22:51.122
TESTIFIED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF
ANY CREDIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE

02:22:51.321 --> 02:22:55.833
COLD ON SECURITY SYSTEMS YOU 
CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT LIKE

02:22:56.046 --> 02:22:58.830
THE WHITE HOUSE VISIT THE AIDE 
WAS CONDITIONED ON THE 

02:22:59.044 --> 02:23:01.044
INVESTIGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

02:23:02.492 --> 02:23:04.620
TRUMP WANTED IS THAT WHAT YOU 
SAID IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT? 

02:23:04.821 --> 02:23:07.785
&gt;&gt; IT IS. 
&gt;&gt; BREAK THIS DOWN WITH YOU BY 

02:23:07.976 --> 02:23:11.845
THIS TIME YOU AND MANY TOP 
OFFICIALS KNEW THAT THE COVETED 

02:23:12.046 --> 02:23:14.046
WHITE 

02:23:15.088 --> 02:23:18.743
HOUSE MEETING WAS CONDITIONED ON
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. 

02:23:18.744 --> 02:23:20.744
&gt;&gt; 

02:23:23.753 --> 02:23:25.753
THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

02:23:33.362 --> 02:23:35.597
YOU TESTIFIED THAT THIS WAS A 
QUID PRO QUO, IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:23:35.799 --> 02:23:38.259
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; AT THIS POINT BY THE END OF 

02:23:38.449 --> 02:23:43.617
AUGUST NEW THE AIDE HAD BEEN 
HELD UP FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS, 

02:23:43.818 --> 02:23:45.818
IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE I FOUND OUT THROUGH

02:23:46.366 --> 02:23:49.005
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT THE AIDE 
HAS BEEN HELD UP AROUND JULY 

02:23:49.215 --> 02:23:51.650
18th IS WHEN I HEARD, 
ORIGINALLY. 

02:23:51.651 --> 02:23:53.651
&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH YOU SEARCHED 

02:23:56.518 --> 02:23:58.518
FOR REASONS, YOU WERE NEVER 
GIVEN A CREDIBLE EXPLANATION IS 

02:23:58.579 --> 02:23:59.977
THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT. 

02:23:59.978 --> 02:24:01.978
&gt;&gt; KNOW WHEN YOU SPOKE TO 
THOUGHT THE AIDE SHOULD 

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:07.583
BE HELD, TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
RIGHT? 

02:24:07.584 --> 02:24:09.584
&gt;&gt; I NEVER HEARD ANYONE ADVOCATE
FOR HOLDING 

02:24:12.168 --> 02:24:14.168
THE AIDE. 
&gt;&gt; NOW, BY THIS POINT AT THE END

02:24:14.218 --> 02:24:16.438
OF AUGUST IT WENT PUBLIC AND THE
UKRAINIANS DO ABOUT IT? 

02:24:16.439 --> 02:24:19.693
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THERE WERE SOME 
PRESS REPORTS. BUT, AT THAT 

02:24:19.892 --> 02:24:22.731
POINT IT BECAME SORT OF COMMON 
KNOWLEDGE THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT 

02:24:22.930 --> 02:24:25.968
BE TIED TOGETHER. 
&gt;&gt; IN FACT PRESENT ZELENSKY  

02:24:26.183 --> 02:24:30.093
BROUGHT IT UP AT THE MEETING 
WITH VICE PRESIDENT PENCE THAT 

02:24:30.284 --> 02:24:33.486
YOU WERE AT? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BROUGHT 

02:24:34.101 --> 02:24:36.604
UP SPECIFICALLY BUT ASKED WHERE 
THE AIDE WAS I THINK WAS MORE, I

02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:41.488
THINK HE SORT OF ASKED, AGAIN 
VERY VAGUE RECOLLECTIONS BECAUSE

02:24:41.689 --> 02:24:46.491
I DON'T HAVE A READOUT OF THE 
BILATERAL MEETING. WHY DON'T I 

02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:52.652
HAVE MY CHECK, ESSENTIALLY. 
&gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTOOD THE UKRAINIANS

02:24:52.867 --> 02:24:55.023
RECEIVED NO CREDIBLE EXPLANATION
IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:24:55.024 --> 02:24:57.256
&gt;&gt; I CERTAINLY CANNOT GIVE THEM 
ONE. 

02:24:57.257 --> 02:25:02.542
&gt;&gt; THIS KIND OF A 2+2 = 4 
CONCLUSION THAT YOU REACHED? 

02:25:02.873 --> 02:25:05.791
&gt;&gt; PRETTY MUCH 
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY LOG LOGICAL 

02:25:05.993 --> 02:25:10.062
CONCLUSION GIVEN ALL THESE 
FACTORS THAT THE AIDE WAS ALSO A

02:25:10.262 --> 02:25:12.262
PART OF THIS QUID 

02:25:15.875 --> 02:25:18.188
PRO QUO. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE 

02:25:18.386 --> 02:25:20.414
CONVERSATION YOU HAD WITH 
PRESIDENT PENN OR VICE PRESIDENT

02:25:20.617 --> 02:25:24.273
PENCE IN THAT MEETING BEFORE IN 
WARSAW. YOU INDICATED THAT YOU 

02:25:24.468 --> 02:25:28.427
SENT TO HIM THAT YOU WERE 
CONCERNED THE DELAY IN THE AIDE 

02:25:28.629 --> 02:25:31.169
WAS TIED TO THE INVESTIGATION IS
THAT 

02:25:34.419 --> 02:25:36.052
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I 

02:25:36.053 --> 02:25:38.053
SAID TO HIM, THIS WAS 

02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.558
A BRIEFING ATTENDED BY MANY 
PEOPLE AND I WAS INVITED AT THE 

02:25:42.756 --> 02:25:45.015
VERY LAST MINUTE, I WAS NOT 
SCHEDULED TO BE THERE. BUT I 

02:25:45.226 --> 02:25:47.638
SPOKE UP AT SOME POINT LATE IN 
THE MEETING AND SAID IT LOOKS 

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:51.076
LIKE EVERYTHING IS BEING HELD UP
UNTIL THESE STATEMENTS GET MADE 

02:25:51.386 --> 02:25:56.176
AND, THAT IS MY PERSONAL BELIEF.
&gt;&gt; VICE PRESIDENT PENCE JUST 

02:25:56.367 --> 02:25:59.219
NODDED HIS HEAD? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL ANY EXCHANGE 

02:25:59.408 --> 02:26:03.059
OR IF HE ASKED ME ANY QUESTIONS.
IT WAS SORT OF A DULY NOTED. 

02:26:03.274 --> 02:26:07.737
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT SAY GORDON, WERE 
YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

02:26:07.738 --> 02:26:11.922
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT. 
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT SAY WHAT 

02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:14.120
INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; HE 

02:26:16.877 --> 02:26:18.877
DID NOT. 
&gt;&gt; AFTER THIS MEETING YOU 

02:26:19.924 --> 02:26:22.360
DISCUSSED THIS RULE ASIDE YOU 
HAD WITH MR. YERMAK  WHERE YOU 

02:26:22.568 --> 02:26:29.675
RELAYED YOUR BELIEF THAT THEY 
NEEDED TO ANNOUNCE THESE 

02:26:29.876 --> 02:26:32.211
INVESTIGATIONS PRIOR TO THE AIDE
BEING RELEASED, IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:26:32.402 --> 02:26:37.591
&gt;&gt; I SAID, I DID NOT KNOW 
EXACTLY WHY BUT THIS COULD BE A 

02:26:37.806 --> 02:26:40.039
REASON. 
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE BEEN 

02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:45.239
SPEAKING WITH MR. YERMAK ABOUT  
A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THESE 

02:26:47.138 --> 02:26:48.984
INVESTIGATIONS RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; WE HAD ALL BEEN WORKING TO 

02:26:48.985 --> 02:26:53.038
THAT END. 
&gt;&gt; INDICATED IN ADDITION TO THE 

02:26:53.247 --> 02:26:55.278
WHITE HOUSE MEETING THE SECURITY
AIDE WAS ALSO INVOLVED? 

02:26:55.279 --> 02:26:57.124
&gt;&gt; AS I SAID, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED. 

02:26:57.125 --> 02:26:59.125
&gt;&gt; 

02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:04.817
I WANT TO SHOW YOU ANOTHER TEXT 
EXCHANGE YOU HAD ON SEPTEMBER 

02:27:05.105 --> 02:27:07.300
1st WHERE AMBASSADOR TAYLOR SAYS
DO YOU ARE WE NOW SAYING THAT 

02:27:07.859 --> 02:27:10.092
SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND WHITE 
HOUSE MEETING ARE CONDITIONED ON

02:27:10.293 --> 02:27:13.342
INVESTIGATION? AND YOU RESPOND 
CALL ME. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

02:27:13.556 --> 02:27:17.609
RECALLS THAT HE DID CALL YOU AND
YOU DID HAVE A CONVERSATION AND,

02:27:17.808 --> 02:27:23.705
IN THAT CONVERSATION YOU TOLD 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT THE 

02:27:23.905 --> 02:27:26.441
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS BY PRESIDENT 

02:27:26.641 --> 02:27:33.055
ZELENSKY NEEDED TO BE PUBLIC AND
THAT THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS 

02:27:35.087 --> 02:27:38.948
CONDITIONED ON, THAT 
ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD ULTIMATELY 

02:27:39.155 --> 02:27:42.591
RELEASE THE AIDE, DO YOU RECALL 
THAT CONVERSATION WITH 

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:47.440
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; MY CONVERSATION WITH 

02:27:47.473 --> 02:27:51.125
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, MY 
CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR 

02:27:51.325 --> 02:27:53.586
JOHNSON WERE ALL MY PERSONAL 
BELIEF BASED ON, AS YOU PUT IT, 

02:27:53.774 --> 02:27:55.774
2+2 

02:27:58.241 --> 02:27:59.726
= 4. 
&gt;&gt; IN HIS TESTIMONY, AMBASSADOR 

02:27:59.727 --> 02:28:02.097
TAYLOR SAID THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAD TOLD YOU THAT HE WANTED 

02:28:04.123 --> 02:28:06.356
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO STATE 
PUBLICLY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 1st. 

02:28:06.570 --> 02:28:08.570
DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO DOUBT 

02:28:11.036 --> 02:28:13.669
AMBASSADOR TAYLORS TESTIMONY 
WHICH HE SAID WAS BASED ON HIS 

02:28:13.885 --> 02:28:16.106
METICULOUS, CONTEMPORANEOUS 
NOTES? 

02:28:16.107 --> 02:28:18.107
&gt;&gt; 

02:28:19.157 --> 02:28:21.157
PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER TOLD ME 
DIRECTLY THAT THE AIDE WAS 

02:28:21.206 --> 02:28:23.624
CONDITIONED ON THE MEETINGS. THE
ONLY THING WE GOT DIRECTLY FROM 

02:28:23.838 --> 02:28:25.838
GIULIANI WAS THAT 

02:28:29.843 --> 02:28:32.837
THE REASON BURISMA AND THE 2016 
ELECTIONS WERE CONDITIONED ON 

02:28:33.027 --> 02:28:37.645
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING.  THE 
AIDE WAS MY OWN PERSONAL GUESS 

02:28:37.857 --> 02:28:39.857
BASED ON YOUR ANALOGY 2+2 = 

02:28:42.715 --> 02:28:44.377
4. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT TALK TO PRESIDENT 

02:28:44.378 --> 02:28:49.021
TRUMP WHEN AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
SAYS THAT IS WHAT YOU TOLD HIM? 

02:28:49.231 --> 02:28:53.173
&gt;&gt; MY TESTIMONY AS I NEVER HEARD
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT AIDE 

02:28:53.388 --> 02:28:56.129
WAS CONDITIONED ON AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTION. 

02:28:56.130 --> 02:28:58.564
&gt;&gt; IS SO YOU NEVER HEARD THE 
SPECIFIC WORDS? 

02:28:58.565 --> 02:29:00.999
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. NEVER HEARD THOSE 
WORDS. 

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.492
&gt;&gt; LET'S MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION IN A 

02:29:06.684 --> 02:29:11.364
LITTLE BIT LATER THAT BOTH 
MORRISON AND AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

02:29:11.575 --> 02:29:15.096
RECOUNT. BUT IN THIS SEPTEMBER 
1st CONVERSATION AMBASSADOR 

02:29:15.298 --> 02:29:18.071
TAYLOR ALSO SAYS TESTIFIED, 

02:29:21.523 --> 02:29:24.559
UNDER OATH THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WANTED ZELENSKY IN A PUBLIC BOX,

02:29:24.982 --> 02:29:26.805
DO YOU RECALL USING THAT 
EXPRESSION? 

02:29:26.806 --> 02:29:29.642
&gt;&gt; A GOES BACK TO MY EARLIER 
COMMENT THAT COMING 

02:29:32.891 --> 02:29:38.779
FROM THE GIULIANI SOURCE THAT 
THEY WANTED WHATEVER COMMITMENTS

02:29:38.993 --> 02:29:43.863
UKRAINE MADE TO BE MADE PUBLICLY
SO THEY WOULD BE ON THE RECORD 

02:29:44.072 --> 02:29:46.712
AND BE HELD MORE ACCOUNTABLE, 
WHATEVER THOSE COMMITMENTS WERE.

02:29:46.912 --> 02:29:50.567
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO TESTIFIED OR 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR TESTIFIED THAT

02:29:50.767 --> 02:29:52.767
YOU TOLD HIM YOU HAD MADE 

02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:58.460
A MISTAKE IN TELLING THE 
UKRAINIANS THAT ONLY THE WHITE 

02:29:58.555 --> 02:30:00.319
HOUSE MEETING WAS CONDITIONED ON
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 

02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:02.344
INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT IN FACT 
EVERYTHING WAS, INCLUDING THE 

02:30:03.764 --> 02:30:06.411
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. DO YOU 
REMEMBER SAYING THAT? 

02:30:06.412 --> 02:30:09.506
&gt;&gt; WHEN I REFERENCE THE MISTAKE 
BUT I RECALL WAS I THOUGHT THAT 

02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:12.503
A STATEMENT MADE BY THE NEW 

02:30:16.154 --> 02:30:18.154
UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR THAT THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE STARTED 

02:30:18.601 --> 02:30:23.071
UP AGAIN OR COMMENCE AND BE 
SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY MR. 

02:30:24.888 --> 02:30:27.743
GIULIANI/PRESIDENT TRUMP. AS I 
RECALL, MY MISTAKE WAS SOMEONE 

02:30:28.142 --> 02:30:34.048
CAME BACK THROUGH VOLKER AND 
SAID  NO, IT WILL NOT DO IF THE 

02:30:34.248 --> 02:30:38.303
PROSECUTOR MAKES THE STATEMENTS.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO HEAR IT 

02:30:38.504 --> 02:30:42.157
FROM ZELENSKY DIRECTLY THAT IS 
THE MISTAKE I THINK I MADE.  

02:30:42.356 --> 02:30:44.216
&gt;&gt; GIVE ANY REASON TO QUESTION 
AMBASSADOR TAYLORS TESTIMONY 

02:30:44.217 --> 02:30:47.842
BASED ON HIS NOTES? 
&gt;&gt; I WILL NOT QUESTION 

02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:54.047
IN QUESTION. I JUST TELL YOU 
WHAT I BELIEVE I WAS REFERRING 

02:30:54.236 --> 02:30:55.831
TO. 
&gt;&gt; LET ME FAST FORWARD A WEEK 

02:30:55.832 --> 02:31:02.263
AND SHOW YOU ANOTHER TEXT 
EXCHANGE. ON SEPTEMBER 8th YOU 

02:31:02.543 --> 02:31:04.711
HAD, YOU SENT A TEXT TO 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR AND VOLKER, 

02:31:04.912 --> 02:31:06.912
CAN YOU READ WHAT YOU WROTE 

02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:10.396
? 
&gt;&gt; MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH 

02:31:10.397 --> 02:31:13.518
POTUS AND ZELENSKY, LET'S TALK. 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AT 11:20 IN 

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:20.367
THE MORNING. IF WE COULD GO TO 
THE NEXT EXCHANGE. AMBASSADOR 

02:31:21.161 --> 02:31:25.288
TAYLOR THEN 15 MINUTES LATER 
SAYS GORDON AND I JUST SPOKE OR 

02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:28.679
20 MINUTES LATER I CAN BRIEF YOU
IF YOU AND GORDON 

02:31:32.333 --> 02:31:34.668
DON'T CONNECT. THEN AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR ANNOUNCED THE NIGHTMARES 

02:31:35.355 --> 02:31:37.355
THEY GIVE 

02:31:39.036 --> 02:31:40.863
THE INTERVIEW AND DON'T GET THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. THE 

02:31:40.864 --> 02:31:43.107
RUSSIANS LOVE IT, AND I QUIT. 
YOU WOULD AGREE, THAT IN THIS 

02:31:43.305 --> 02:31:45.305
TEXT MESSAGE, AFTER YOU 

02:31:46.955 --> 02:31:49.805
HAD SPOKEN AN HOUR EARLIER WITH 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT HE IS 

02:31:50.007 --> 02:31:52.007
LINKING THE 

02:31:53.456 --> 02:31:55.129
SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THIS 
INTERVIEW, THIS PUBLIC 

02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:58.124
ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:31:58.125 --> 02:32:00.357
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. 
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

02:32:00.559 --> 02:32:02.644
TESTIFIED THAT YOU DID HAVE A 
CONVERSATION WITH HIM AT THAT 

02:32:03.438 --> 02:32:05.438
POINT AND THAT YOU 

02:32:07.304 --> 02:32:09.946
TOLD HIM THAT, JUST AS YOUR TEXT
MESSAGE INDICATES, YOU DID HAVE 

02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:12.140
A 

02:32:15.141 --> 02:32:18.757
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP PRIOR TO THE TEXT MESSAGE,

02:32:18.970 --> 02:32:20.970
DOES THAT HELP TO REFRESH YOUR 
RECOLLECTION THAT YOU SPOKE TO 

02:32:21.136 --> 02:32:23.136
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THAT TIME? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN I DON'T RECALL 

02:32:23.138 --> 02:32:25.585
PRESIDENT TRUMP EVER TALKING TO 
ME ABOUT ANY SECURITY 

02:32:26.603 --> 02:32:30.256
ASSISTANCE, EVER. WHAT THIS 
TELLS ME, REFRESHING MY MEMORY 

02:32:30.463 --> 02:32:33.308
IS THAT BY THE EIGHTH OF 
SEPTEMBER IT WAS ABUNDANTLY 

02:32:33.505 --> 02:32:39.592
CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT THERE WAS
A LINK AND THAT WE WERE 

02:32:39.893 --> 02:32:42.643
DISCUSSING THE CHICKEN AND EGG 
ISSUE OF SHOULD 

02:32:45.896 --> 02:32:49.547
THE UKRAINIANS GO OUT ON A LEDGE
AND MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT 

02:32:49.747 --> 02:32:54.429
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED THEM TO 
MAKE AND THEN, THEY STILL DON'T 

02:32:54.637 --> 02:32:57.063
GET THERE WHITE HOUSE VISIT AND 
THEIR AID, THAT WOULD BE REALLY 

02:32:57.264 --> 02:32:59.712
BAD FOR OUR CREDIBILITY. I THINK
THAT IS WHAT HE IS 

02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:04.423
REFERRING TO. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU SPOKE 

02:33:04.424 --> 02:33:06.414
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AS YOU 
INDICATED IN THAT TEXT? THAT 

02:33:06.415 --> 02:33:08.415
SKIFF I SAID I DID 

02:33:11.897 --> 02:33:14.019
I DID. YOU'RE STILL UNDER THE 
IMPRESSION THAT THE AIDE WAS 

02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:16.210
CONTINGENT ON THESE 

02:33:18.999 --> 02:33:21.649
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE DISSUADED THEN? YOU 

02:33:21.862 --> 02:33:24.528
STILL THOUGHT THAT THE AIDE WAS 
CONDITIONED ON THE PUBLIC 

02:33:24.719 --> 02:33:26.719
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
INVESTIGATION AFTER SPEAKING TO 

02:33:29.769 --> 02:33:31.386
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
&gt;&gt; BY SEPTEMBER 8th I WAS 

02:33:31.387 --> 02:33:33.387
ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT 

02:33:36.811 --> 02:33:41.341
IT WAS. 
&gt;&gt; AND PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT 

02:33:41.557 --> 02:33:43.382
DISSUADE YOU OF THAT? IN THE 
CONVERSATION YOU ACKNOWLEDGED 

02:33:43.383 --> 02:33:45.383
YOU HAD WITH HIM? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T EVER RECALL. THAT 

02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:47.410
WOULD'VE CHANGED MY ENTIRE 
CALCULUS. 

02:34:43.134 --> 02:34:47.684
. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; THE TEXT AS YOU SAID IM THE 

02:34:47.914 --> 02:34:54.225
NO QUID PRO QUO WAS MY EFFORT TO
RESPOND TO AMBASSADOR TAYLOR'S 

02:34:54.454 --> 02:34:59.084
CONCERNS TO GO TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, APPARENTLY AMBASSADOR 

02:34:59.314 --> 02:35:04.834
TAYLOR HAD ACCESS TO SECRETARY 
POMPEO HE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

02:35:05.074 --> 02:35:08.214
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, I SAID 
WHAT DO YOU WANT, PRESIDENT 

02:35:08.445 --> 02:35:15.495
DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED WITH WHAT
I PUT IN THE TEXT AND I STRONGLY

02:35:15.724 --> 02:35:18.584
ENCOURAGING AMBASSADOR TAYLOR TO
TAKE IT UP WITH THE SECRETARY 

02:35:18.819 --> 02:35:26.454
AND HE RESPONDED, YOU AGREE. AS 
FAR AS YOUR OTHER PART OF THE 

02:35:26.694 --> 02:35:30.405
QUESTION AS FAR AS WHETHER OR 
NOT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY OR I 

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:36.404
COULD MAKE THE STATEMENT. I DO 
NOT RECALL WHO FOLD ME, 

02:35:36.784 --> 02:35:39.824
AMBASSADOR VOLKER, RUDY GIULIANI
OR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, IT 

02:35:40.064 --> 02:35:44.475
HAS TO BE THE PROSECUTOR, WHO 
EVER I GOT THAT INFORMATION FROM

02:35:44.704 --> 02:35:49.405
I RELAYED THAT TO BOTH 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR AND MR. 

02:35:49.624 --> 02:35:51.624
MORRISON. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU UNDERSTOOD DID YOU 

02:35:51.824 --> 02:35:57.635
NOT THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
EITHER HIMSELF OR THROUGH HIS 

02:35:57.874 --> 02:36:01.474
AGENTS REQUIRED THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY MAKE A PUBLIC 

02:36:01.705 --> 02:36:03.353
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TWO 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

02:36:03.354 --> 02:36:07.174
DONALD TRUMP CARED ABOUT IN 
ORDER TO GET BOTH THE WHITE 

02:36:07.394 --> 02:36:09.913
HOUSE MEETING AND THE SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE. 

02:36:09.914 --> 02:36:16.355
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I NOW RECOGNIZE MR. NUNES, 

02:36:16.584 --> 02:36:18.584
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A 

02:36:20.795 --> 02:36:24.254
FIVE OR 10 MONEY BREAK. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU 

02:48:13.265 --> 02:48:18.414
&gt;&gt;&gt; I THINK TODAY'S TESTIMONY IS
AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 

02:48:18.644 --> 02:48:23.514
EVIDENCE TO DAY AND WHAT WE HAVE
JUST HEARD WAS ABOUT THE 

02:48:23.754 --> 02:48:28.255
KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCHEME, L 
CONDITIONING OF THE SECURITY 

02:48:28.484 --> 02:48:32.045
ASSISTANCE TO GET THE 
DELIVERABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

02:48:32.275 --> 02:48:37.504
WANTED. THE TWO INVESTIGATIONS 
THAT HE BELIEVED WOULD BENEFIT 

02:48:37.735 --> 02:48:42.555
HIS CAMPAIGN WAS A BASIC QUID 
PRO QUO, THE CONDITIONING OF 

02:48:42.784 --> 02:48:44.954
OFFICIAL ACTS FOR THE 
INVESTIGATIONS, IT GOES TO THE 

02:48:45.175 --> 02:48:51.075
HEART OF THE ISSUE OF BRIBERY AS
WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL HIGH 

02:48:51.304 --> 02:48:54.065
CRIMES OR MISDEMEANORS BUT WE 
HAVE ALSO HEARD FOR THE FIRST 

02:48:54.294 --> 02:48:59.315
TIME THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
SCHEME WAS PER PERVASIVE. THE 

02:48:59.545 --> 02:49:04.080
SECRETARY OF STATE WAS AWARE OF 
IT. THE ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF, 

02:49:04.735 --> 02:49:08.395
MICK MULVANEY WAS AWARE OF IT 
AND OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP 

02:49:08.815 --> 02:49:12.192
THROUGH HIS LAWYERS AND OTHERS 
WAS IMPLEMENTING IT. THIS I 

02:49:13.415 --> 02:49:17.424
THINK ONLY GOES TO UNDERSCORE 
JUST HOW SIGNIFICANT THE 

02:49:17.655 --> 02:49:22.175
PRESIDENT'S OBSTRUCTION OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN. WE NOW 

02:49:22.404 --> 02:49:29.610
CAN SEE THE VENEER HAS BEEN TORN
AWAY, JUST WHY SECRETARY 

02:49:30.394 --> 02:49:35.917
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
AND DONALD TRUMP DO NOT WANT THE

02:49:36.144 --> 02:49:38.495
DOCUMENTS SHOWN TO CONGRESS 
BECAUSE AMBASSADOR SONDLAND HAS 

02:49:39.034 --> 02:49:46.275
TESTIFIED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF 
THIS SCHEME TO CONDITION 

02:49:46.515 --> 02:49:49.944
SPECIFIC ACTS WAS CONDITIONED ON
POLITICAL FAVORS THE PRESIDENT 

02:49:50.425 --> 02:49:53.305
WANTED FOR HIS REELECTION. SO I 
THINK A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT IN

02:49:54.675 --> 02:49:56.675
THE HISTORY OF THIS INQUIRY. 
THANK YOU 

02:54:41.225 --> 02:54:43.225
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

02:54:44.885 --> 02:54:52.285
I NOW RECOGNIZE RANGING MEMBER 
NUNES AND MINORITY COUNSEL 445 

02:54:52.525 --> 02:54:54.734
MINUTES OF QUESTIONS. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING AT

02:54:54.964 --> 02:54:58.984
HOME THAT WAS NOT A BATHROOM 
BREAK THAT WAS A CHANCE FOR THE 

02:54:59.225 --> 02:55:02.945
DEMOCRATS TO HOLD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE FOR ALL OF THE 

02:55:03.174 --> 02:55:07.435
SUPPOSED BOMB SHELLS, I WANT TO 
GET BACK TO THE FACTS OF THE 

02:55:07.665 --> 02:55:16.735
MATTER HERE AND SAYING THAT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN 

02:55:18.535 --> 02:55:23.215
UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THAT THEIR 
OPERATIVES GOT CAMPAIGN DIRT 

02:55:23.445 --> 02:55:27.315
FROM THE UKRAINIANS IN THE 2016 
ELECTION, THEY KNOW ITS TRUE, WE

02:55:27.555 --> 02:55:32.495
HAVE FINANCIAL RECORDS THAT SHOW
IT. THE DEMOCRATS WERE HEAVILY 

02:55:32.725 --> 02:55:37.994
INVOLVED WORKING WITH THE EU 
UKRAINIANS TO DIRTY UP THE 

02:55:38.230 --> 02:55:42.165
PRESIDENT IN 2016, I WANT TO GO 
THROUGH SOME OF THE INCIDENTS 

02:55:42.405 --> 02:55:45.395
THAT WE KNOW, AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT 

02:55:45.625 --> 02:55:51.165
KNOW THEM. BUT I WANT TO WALK 
THROUGH THE EXAMPLES ABOUT WHY 

02:55:51.405 --> 02:55:54.825
THE PRESIDENT MAY BE VERY UPSET 
WITH UKRAINE AND THAT THEY ARE A

02:55:55.055 --> 02:55:58.965
COUNTRY THAT IS OUT TO GET HIM. 
YOU HAVE SAID THAT AND 

02:55:59.195 --> 02:56:04.354
AMBASSADOR VOLKER HAVE SAID THAT
FROM THAT MAY 23RD MEETING. THE 

02:56:04.595 --> 02:56:13.175
FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS WERE 
YOU AWARE OF THE ANTI-TRUMP 

02:56:13.414 --> 02:56:14.574
EFFORTS BY DNC OPERATIVE 
CHALUPA. 

02:56:14.575 --> 02:56:23.065
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT AWARE OF IT. 
&gt;&gt; SO IN 2017, 

02:56:25.165 --> 02:56:27.439
THERE IS AN ARTICLE 

02:56:32.225 --> 02:56:35.965
THAT ALSO QUOTES A UKRAINIAN 
PARLIAMENT MEMBER SAYING THAT 

02:56:36.445 --> 02:56:38.445
THEY WERE SUPPORTING HILLARY 
CLINTON'S CANDIDACY 

02:56:41.865 --> 02:56:47.294
AND THEY DID EVERYTHING FROM 
ORGANIZING MEMBERS OF THE 

02:56:47.535 --> 02:56:52.815
CLINTON TEAM. I THINK THAT THEY 
DID NOT MEET WITH THE TRUMP 

02:56:53.415 --> 02:56:57.255
CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT 
HILLARY CLINTON WOULD O WIN. DO 

02:56:57.995 --> 02:57:03.923
YOU KNOW THAT OFFICIAL. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I DO NOT. 

02:57:03.924 --> 02:57:05.924
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU 

02:57:07.786 --> 02:57:11.265
AWARE THAT A MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT WROTE AN ARTICLE 

02:57:11.495 --> 02:57:13.464
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP. 

02:57:13.465 --> 02:57:17.974
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT AWARE. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW THAT NOW. 

02:57:17.975 --> 02:57:24.165
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY THE MOST DISTURBING 

02:57:24.395 --> 02:57:26.615
ONE, THE UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL 
MOCKED AND DISPARAGED PRESIDENT 

02:57:26.845 --> 02:57:31.265
DONALD TRUMP ON FACEBOOK AND 
TWITTER. WERE YOU AWARE THAT A 

02:57:31.525 --> 02:57:35.625
MEMBER OF UKRAINE PARLIAMENT 
ADMITTED THAT PART OF HIS 

02:57:35.995 --> 02:57:39.045
MOTIVATION ABOUT SPREADING THE 
INFORMATION OF 

02:57:42.065 --> 02:57:47.454
A SO CALLED BLACK LEDGER, 
REVEALED TO UNDERMINE THE TRUMP 

02:57:47.685 --> 02:57:49.094
CANDIDACY. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT AWARE. 

02:57:49.095 --> 02:57:54.525
&gt;&gt; THE BLACK LEDGER WAS USED TO 
DIRTY UP A CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE 

02:57:54.755 --> 02:58:01.595
AND LATER MUELLER USED THAT AS 
EVIDENCE IN HIS REPORT ON 

02:58:01.825 --> 02:58:07.955
ELECTION MEDDLING. SO KNOWING 
ALL OF THESE FACTS FROM HIGH 

02:58:08.385 --> 02:58:10.013
RANKING UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS, 
AMBASSADOR, PROBABLY IT MAKES 

02:58:10.014 --> 02:58:13.925
MORE SENSE AS TO WHY THE 
PRESIDENT MAY THINK THAT THERE 

02:58:14.265 --> 02:58:19.475
ARE PROBLEMS WITH UKRAINE AND 
THAT UKRAINE WAS OUT TO GET HIM 

02:58:20.155 --> 02:58:25.425
IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT, YES 

02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:27.644
CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID IN YOUR DEPOSITION, 

02:58:27.645 --> 02:58:33.785
I AM GOING TO MAKE SURE, I AM 
GOING TO READ IT BACK TO YOU ON 

02:58:34.014 --> 02:58:39.375
PAGE 279 FOR YOUR LEGAL TEAM, 
THEY ARE ALL CORRUPT. THIS IS 

02:58:39.605 --> 02:58:42.875
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT YOUR 
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT.

02:58:43.115 --> 02:58:46.444
THIS IS YOUR WORDS ABOUT WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT TOLD YOU. 

02:58:46.445 --> 02:58:51.575
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MAY 23RD MEETING?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. THEY ARE ALL 

02:58:51.815 --> 02:58:55.495
CORRUPT. THEY ARE ALL TERRIBLE 
PEOPLE AND I DO NOT WANT TO 

02:58:56.815 --> 02:59:01.485
SPEND ANY TIME WITH THAT, HE 
ALSO SAID THEY TRIED TO TAKE ME 

02:59:02.385 --> 02:59:03.514
DOWN. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 

02:59:03.515 --> 02:59:10.980
&gt;&gt; THEY TRIED TO TAKE HIM DOWN. 
ANY LOGICAL PERSON THAT WANTS TO

02:59:11.204 --> 02:59:16.365
DO TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS FOUR 
GAMES WOULD SAY THAT WAS IN THE 

02:59:16.595 --> 02:59:19.005
2016 ELECTION. 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HE WAS 

02:59:19.235 --> 02:59:23.145
REFERRING TO, YES. 
&gt;&gt; DURING ALL OF THIS TIME AND 

02:59:23.375 --> 02:59:25.375
REMEMBER 

02:59:26.625 --> 02:59:29.895
IN THE SPRING, THE DEMOCRATS 
RUSSIA HOAX WITCH HUNT IS STILL 

02:59:30.255 --> 02:59:32.565
ONGOING, THEY ARE STILL CLAIMING
THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS A

02:59:33.105 --> 02:59:37.405
RUSSIAN AGENT. THEY ARE OUT TO 
GET PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AT 

02:59:37.655 --> 02:59:40.755
THE TIME. HIS PERSONAL ATTORNEY 
IS THEN INTERESTED THIS TRYING 

02:59:41.595 --> 02:59:45.855
TO FIGURE OUT WHO ARE THESE 
UKRAINIANS TRYING TO GET TO MY 

02:59:46.815 --> 02:59:49.668
CANDIDATE. THOSE OF US, THE 
REPUBLICANS ON THIS COMMITTEE 

02:59:50.595 --> 02:59:58.695
WHO ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF WHO ARE THE SOURCES IN

02:59:59.295 --> 03:00:03.287
THE STELLE  DOSSIER, THE HOUSE 
REPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, 

03:00:04.035 --> 03:00:13.685
THAT'S WHY WE INTERVIEW 
SUBPOENAED THE DNC OPERATIVES 

03:00:13.915 --> 03:00:21.195
THAT THE DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO 
SUBPOENA. WE WANT TO KNOW WHO 

03:00:21.615 --> 03:00:23.895
WERE THESE DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES
DIRTYING UP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, 

03:00:24.435 --> 03:00:27.935
THEY CANNOT GET OBVIOUS THAT THE
PRESIDENT WOULD SEND HIS 

03:00:28.165 --> 03:00:31.325
PERSONAL ATTORNEY OVER THERE TO 
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. YOU 

03:00:31.554 --> 03:00:35.684
HAD VERY FEW DEALINGS WITH RUDY 
GIULIANI. 

03:00:35.685 --> 03:00:40.034
&gt;&gt; A FEW TEXT MESSAGES AND A FEW
PHONE CALLS. 

03:00:40.035 --> 03:00:44.115
&gt;&gt; SO THE WHISTLE BLOWER, THEY 
HAVE A TIME LINE PROBLEM, THE 

03:00:44.345 --> 03:00:47.055
WHISTLE BLOWER THAT ONLY THEY 
KNOW WHO 

03:00:50.235 --> 03:00:54.185
THEY WILL NOT SUBPOENA WHO 
CLEARLY ALEXANDER VINDMAN KNOWES

03:00:54.425 --> 03:00:57.435
WHO THEY BLOCKED TESTIMONY FROM 
YESTERDAY AND WOULD NOT ALLOW 

03:00:57.795 --> 03:01:03.385
HIM TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS, 
THAT WHISTLE BLOWER SAYS ON JULY

03:01:03.625 --> 03:01:08.835
25TH THAT THERE WERE AWLZ OF 
THESE PROMISES BEING MADE YET 

03:01:09.065 --> 03:01:15.285
THE, I FORGET WHAT THEY CALLED 
IT, THE DRUG DEAL THAT THE 3 

03:01:15.514 --> 03:01:21.145
AMIGOS WERE COOKING UP WAS THE 
LATEST. YOU ARE PART OF THE 3 

03:01:21.565 --> 03:01:26.845
AMIGOS, WERE YOU AWARE OF ANY 
DRUG DEAL ON JULY 25TH WHEN THE 

03:01:27.075 --> 03:01:30.205
PHONE CALL ACTUALLY OCCURRED. 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT A DRUG 

03:01:30.425 --> 03:01:33.495
DEAL. 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE PART

03:01:33.725 --> 03:01:38.235
OF THE 3 AMIGOS. 
&gt;&gt; I AM A PROUD PART OF THE 3 

03:01:38.465 --> 03:01:40.935
AMIGOS. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT 

03:01:41.165 --> 03:01:45.465
AMBASSADOR VOLKER SAID. BY THE 
TIME THAT THE PHONE CALL THAT 

03:01:46.685 --> 03:01:51.115
THE WHISTLE BLOWER CLAIMS WAS 
THE ORIGINAL QUID PRO QUO WE ARE

03:01:51.345 --> 03:01:57.655
A MONTH LATER WHERE YOU ARE 
INVOLVED AND THEIR QUID PRO QUO 

03:01:57.895 --> 03:02:00.985
HAS GOTTEN DOWN TO THE LOW LEVEL
OF THEY WANT A STATEMENT. YOU 

03:02:01.255 --> 03:02:06.945
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING TO 
DO WITH, ON JULY 25TH YOU KNEW 

03:02:07.915 --> 03:02:11.334
NOTHING ABOUT MILITARY AD BEING 
WITHHELD. 

03:02:11.335 --> 03:02:16.975
&gt;&gt; I KNEW THAT MILITARY AID WAS 
WITHHELD ON JULY 18TH WHEN 

03:02:17.215 --> 03:02:20.734
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR TOLD BOTH OF 
US THAT WAS THE CASE. 

03:02:20.735 --> 03:02:24.103
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE NOT ON THE JULY 25TH
CALL. 

03:02:24.104 --> 03:02:27.295
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT. 
&gt;&gt; WHERE THE AID DOES NOT COME 

03:02:27.525 --> 03:02:31.075
UP AT ALL. 
&gt;&gt; I JUST READ THE READ OUT. 

03:02:31.305 --> 03:02:36.105
&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY TESTIFIED IT WAS ON
THE JULY 25TH CALL, THERE WAS NO

03:02:36.345 --> 03:02:42.945
AID DISCUSSED ON THE JULY 25TH 
CALL. YOU HAVE NO IDEA THIS IS 

03:02:43.185 --> 03:02:47.344
TIED TO BURISMA UNTIL THE END OF
AUGUST. 

03:02:47.345 --> 03:02:56.205
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT REALIZE THAT AID 
WAS TIED. THE BURISMA AND 2016 

03:02:56.565 --> 03:02:59.434
PIECE WAS MUCH EARLIER RANKING 
MEMBER. 

03:02:59.435 --> 03:03:03.675
&gt;&gt; I AM GLAD YOU BRING UP 
BURISMA, THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE 

03:03:03.895 --> 03:03:08.445
THAT THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT 
TO GO INTO, THEY REFUSED TO CALL

03:03:08.687 --> 03:03:11.905
IN HUNTER BIDEN, HE COULD COME 
IN AND TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

03:03:12.135 --> 03:03:17.725
IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO 
RECEIVE OVER $50,000 A MONTH 

03:03:17.965 --> 03:03:23.805
WHILE HIS DAD WAS VEUZ PRESIDENT
AND WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WERE ABLE

03:03:24.035 --> 03:03:30.215
TO STOP AND GET AN INVESTIGATOR 
FIRED, THEY CAN CALL IN HUNTER 

03:03:30.465 --> 03:03:35.515
BIDEN BUT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO
IT. LETS TALK ABOUT BURISMA, I 

03:03:35.775 --> 03:03:39.465
KNOW YOU ARE THE AMBASSADOR TO 
THE EU, I THINK SOME OF THE 

03:03:39.695 --> 03:03:42.285
MEMBERS WILL GET INTO WHETHER OR
NOT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU 

03:03:42.645 --> 03:03:48.165
TO BE IN UKRAINE, I BELIEVE IT 
WAS, BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE THE 

03:03:48.705 --> 03:03:51.325
FIRST AMBASSADOR TO ACTUALLY BE 
INTERESTED IN BURISMA. DID YOU 

03:03:52.785 --> 03:03:57.585
KNOW THAT IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015 
THEN AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE 

03:03:59.635 --> 03:04:01.635
PUBLICLY CALLED FOR 

03:04:03.595 --> 03:04:08.295
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
PRESIDENT OF BURISMA? THIS WAS 

03:04:08.635 --> 03:04:10.544
THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR, 
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 

03:04:10.545 --> 03:04:12.545
UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT, NO. 

03:04:12.650 --> 03:04:16.725
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF THAT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST 

03:04:16.955 --> 03:04:23.995
ONE TO BE MENTIONING THAT 
INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD BE DONE ON

03:04:24.355 --> 03:04:27.115
BURISMA BECAUSE IT HAPPENED 
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

03:04:27.355 --> 03:04:32.295
DID YOU KNOW THAT FINANCIAL 
RECORDS SHOWED THAT BURISMA 

03:04:32.515 --> 03:04:35.140
ROUTED $3 MILLION TO THE 
ACCOUNTS TIED TO HUNTER BIDEN. 

03:04:35.365 --> 03:04:40.605
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW THAT. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW THAT BURISMA'S 

03:04:40.835 --> 03:04:46.185
AMERICAN LAWYERS TRIED TO SECURE
A FEETING WITH THE PROSECUTOR 

03:04:46.424 --> 03:04:50.555
THE SAME DAY AS THE PROSECUTOR 
THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS 

03:04:50.785 --> 03:04:52.406
ANNOUNCED. 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW THAT. 

03:04:52.407 --> 03:04:56.475
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO 
THE ANSWERS OF MANY OF THESE 

03:04:56.705 --> 03:04:59.955
QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE WITNESSES 
THAT NEED TO COME IN AND CLARIFY

03:05:00.185 --> 03:05:05.715
WHAT THE DEMS WERE DOING IN 2016
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

03:05:06.075 --> 03:05:09.655
VISIT WITH THOSE WITNESSES SO 
ITS AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH THAT 

03:05:09.894 --> 03:05:15.455
THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT TO 
ADMIT, THEIR OPERATIVES THAT 

03:05:15.685 --> 03:05:19.515
WERE DIRTYING UP THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN USING UKRAINE SOURCES 

03:05:19.745 --> 03:05:24.195
IN 2016 AND THEY DO NOT WANT US 
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. THEY

03:05:24.875 --> 03:05:29.065
DO NOT WANT YOU AMBASSADOR TO 
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, THEY DO

03:05:30.895 --> 03:05:33.955
NOT WANT THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERSONAL ATTORNEY TO CONDUCT A 

03:05:34.185 --> 03:05:37.885
INVESTIGATION THAT THEY FED INTO
THE FBI THAT WE DEALT WITH FOR 

03:05:38.125 --> 03:05:44.335
THREE YEARS, THEY DO NOT WANT TO
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. I 

03:05:44.575 --> 03:05:47.904
THINK MR. CASTOR HAS SOME 
QUESTIONS. 

03:05:47.905 --> 03:05:50.124
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND, HOW ARE YOU. 

03:05:50.125 --> 03:05:53.224
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING MR. CASTOR. 
&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK. 

03:05:53.225 --> 03:05:56.015
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
COOPERATION WITH THE 

03:05:56.245 --> 03:06:01.335
INVESTIGATION, DID THE PRESIDENT
TELL YOU PERMANENTLY ABOUT ANY 

03:06:01.605 --> 03:06:03.104
PRE- CONDITIONING FOR ANYTHING? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

03:06:03.105 --> 03:06:06.315
&gt;&gt; OKAY SO THE PRESIDENT NEVER 
TOLD YOU ABOUT PRE- CONDITIONS 

03:06:06.565 --> 03:06:09.339
FOR THE AID TO BE RELEASED. 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

03:06:09.340 --> 03:06:12.975
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT NEVER TOLD YOU 
ABOUT PRE- CONDITIONS FOR A 

03:06:13.205 --> 03:06:16.244
WHITE HOUSE MEETING STVMENT FERM
PERSONALLY NO. 

03:06:16.245 --> 03:06:20.475
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR
RECORDS FROM THE STATE 

03:06:20.705 --> 03:06:24.105
DEPARTMENT BUT IF YOU DID THERE 
WOULD NOT BE A DOCUMENT THAT 

03:06:24.335 --> 03:06:27.544
TIES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO 
ANY OF THIS. 

03:06:27.545 --> 03:06:31.915
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE. 
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE YOUR DO YOU MEANS. 

03:06:32.145 --> 03:06:35.794
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT RECALL ANYTHING LIKE
THAT. 

03:06:35.795 --> 03:06:39.745
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THAT AT MR. 
RUDY GIULIANI'S REQUEST FOR A 

03:06:39.985 --> 03:06:47.335
QUUD PRO QUOA FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE MEETING, YOU INDICATED 

03:06:47.565 --> 03:06:53.555
THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS, HE 
WAS ADVANCING PRESIDENT DONALD 

03:06:53.785 --> 03:06:57.875
TRUMP'S TRSES, CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; MY CONTACT WITH RUDY GIULIANI

03:06:58.105 --> 03:07:02.136
BEGAN LATE IN THE PROCESS AFTER 
AUGUST 1 WHERE I WAS INTRODUCED 

03:07:02.365 --> 03:07:08.665
TO HIM BY A TEXT FROM AMBASSADOR
VOLKER, WE HAD ALREADY BEGUN THE

03:07:08.895 --> 03:07:13.905
DISCUSSIONS I BELIEVE PRIOR TO 
AUGUST 1, EVERYTHING WAS BEING 

03:07:14.135 --> 03:07:15.574
FUNNELED THROUGH OTHERS 
INCLUDING A.M. VOA. 

03:07:15.575 --> 03:07:19.355
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THAT RUDY 
GIULIANI WAS EXPRESSING THE 

03:07:19.585 --> 03:07:22.294
DESIRES OF THE PRESIDENT 
CORRECT. 

03:07:22.295 --> 03:07:26.654
&gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING. 
&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT. 

03:07:26.655 --> 03:07:30.935
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS TALK 
TO MY PERSONAL ATTORNEY AND WHEN

03:07:31.165 --> 03:07:34.565
RUDY GIULIANI AS HIS PERSONAL 
ATTORNEY MAKES CERTAIN REQUESTS 

03:07:34.795 --> 03:07:38.535
OR DEMANDS WE ASSUME IT IS 
COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT, I AM 

03:07:38.765 --> 03:07:41.905
NOT TESTIFYING THAT I HEARD THE 
PRESIDENT TELL RUDY GIULIANI TO 

03:07:42.135 --> 03:07:44.786
TELL US. 
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR DEPOSITION YOU SAID 

03:07:45.025 --> 03:07:49.995
THAT THE QUESTION WAS AT THE MAY
23RD MEETING WHEN ET PRESIDENT 

03:07:50.225 --> 03:07:55.305
SAID GO TALK TO RUDY GIULIANI, 
HE DID NOT EVEN SAY GO TALK, HE 

03:07:55.535 --> 03:07:57.535
SAID 

03:07:58.965 --> 03:08:01.295
TALK TO RUDY GIULIANI. YOU 
SUBSEQUENTLY SAID IT WAS LIKE I 

03:08:01.535 --> 03:08:05.175
DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 
IT WAS NOT AN ORDER OR DIRECTION

03:08:05.425 --> 03:08:07.875
TO TALK WITH RUDY GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; OUR CONCLUSION AND THE 

03:08:08.115 --> 03:08:11.685
CONCLUSION OF THE THREE OF US 
WAS THAT IF WE DID NOT TALK TO 

03:08:11.918 --> 03:08:15.164
RUDY GIULIANI NOTHING WOULD MOVE
FORWARD ON UKRAINE. 

03:08:15.165 --> 03:08:18.935
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS MAY 23RD, YOU NEVER 
HAD ANY PERSONAL COMMUNICATE 

03:08:19.165 --> 03:08:21.744
CAUTIONS WITH RUDY GIULIANI 
UNTIL AUGUST. 

03:08:21.745 --> 03:08:27.765
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND AMBASSADOR VOLKER WAS 

03:08:27.995 --> 03:08:32.025
HANDLING. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR VOLKER, PERRY AND 

03:08:32.265 --> 03:08:33.454
OTHERS. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR VOLKER TESTIFIED 

03:08:33.455 --> 03:08:36.444
HE IS A PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMAT, 
CORRECT. 

03:08:36.445 --> 03:08:38.515
&gt;&gt; HE IS. 
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU HAD A GREAT 

03:08:38.745 --> 03:08:40.314
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 
&gt;&gt; I DO. 

03:08:40.315 --> 03:08:43.646
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID HE WAS A SMART GUY. 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

03:08:43.647 --> 03:08:47.265
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH SAID 
HE IS A BRILLIANT DIPLOMAT, DO 

03:08:47.495 --> 03:08:50.654
YOU AGREE WITH THAT. 
&gt;&gt; HE IS PRETTY SMART. 

03:08:50.655 --> 03:08:55.515
&gt;&gt; YOU STATED HE IS ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE I WOULD HAND MY WALLET 

03:08:55.745 --> 03:08:56.684
TO. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD. 

03:08:56.685 --> 03:09:00.654
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR HIS TESTIMONY 
YESTERDAY. 

03:09:00.655 --> 03:09:03.425
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS BUSY GETTING READY FOR 

03:09:03.645 --> 03:09:06.285
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE 

03:09:06.515 --> 03:09:14.225
OF ANY OF THESE PRE- CONDITIONS 
AND HE WAS THE ONE MOST ENGAGED 

03:09:14.455 --> 03:09:15.624
WITH THE UKRAINIANS? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

03:09:15.625 --> 03:09:18.785
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THIS WAS HIS 
FULL TIME JOB ALTHOUGH HE WAS 

03:09:19.015 --> 03:09:21.725
DOING IT FOR FREE. 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS THE SPECIAL ENVOY. 

03:09:21.955 --> 03:09:27.364
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED YOU CAME IN AND
OUT OF THE EVENTS. 

03:09:27.365 --> 03:09:29.365
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. IN THE DEPOSITION WE 

03:09:29.585 --> 03:09:32.095
ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR COMMUNICATE
CAUTIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 

03:09:32.325 --> 03:09:35.745
WE CANNED ASKED YOU WHETHER 
THERE WERE SO MANY THAT IT WOULD

03:09:36.155 --> 03:09:41.465
BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CHRONICLE AND 
YOU SAID NO IT WAS NOT THAT 

03:09:41.695 --> 03:09:46.115
MANY. YOU WENT DOWN THE PATH OF 
BUILDING A LIST OF 

03:09:46.335 --> 03:09:48.995
COMMUNICATIONS THAT YOU REMEMBER
WITH THE 

03:09:52.355 --> 03:09:54.026
PRESIDENT, RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

03:09:54.027 --> 03:09:58.585
&gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT MAY 23RD IN 
THE OVAL OFFICE AND YOU 

03:09:58.815 --> 03:10:01.415
MENTIONED ON JULY 25TH BEFORE 
YOU WENT TO UKRAINE YOU CALLED 

03:10:01.645 --> 03:10:05.915
THE PRESIDENT BUT THERE WAS NO 
INFORMATION ON THE 25TH CALL 

03:10:06.155 --> 03:10:08.548
CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; NOT THAT I RECALL. 

03:10:08.549 --> 03:10:14.605
&gt;&gt; LAST FRIDAY MR. HOMES CAME IN
AND HIS TESTIMONY REFRESHED YOUR

03:10:14.845 --> 03:10:17.005
RECOLLECTION. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT REFRESHED MY 

03:10:17.235 --> 03:10:19.825
RECOLLECTION WAS WHEN HE 
MENTIONED ASAP ROCKY, ALL OF A 

03:10:20.063 --> 03:10:26.245
SUDDEN IT CAME BACK TO ME. 
&gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT 

03:10:26.472 --> 03:10:29.365
ZELENSKY LOVING IT. 
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE THING CAME BACK TO 

03:10:29.595 --> 03:10:31.705
ME. 
&gt;&gt; THEN THE NEXT TIME WE TRIED 

03:10:31.935 --> 03:10:37.035
TO UNPACK THIS, THE NEXT TIME 
YOU TALKED WITH THE PRESIDENT ON

03:10:37.275 --> 03:10:39.555
THE TELEPHONE WAS SEPTEMBER 
NINTH ACCORDING TO YOUR 

03:10:39.795 --> 03:10:42.505
DEPOSITION, RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I MAY HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM ON 

03:10:42.735 --> 03:10:45.535
SEPTEMBER SIXTH BUT AGAIN I DO 
NOT HAVE ALL OF THE RECORDS, I 

03:10:45.775 --> 03:10:50.465
WISH I COULD GET THEM THEN I 
COULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS 

03:10:50.698 --> 03:10:52.594
EASILY. 
&gt;&gt; ON SEPTEMBER NINTH AT YOUR 

03:10:52.595 --> 03:10:58.275
DEP YOU WERE CLEAR, YOU CALLED 
THE PRESIDENT AND SAID HE WAS 

03:10:58.535 --> 03:11:01.925
FEELING CRANKY THAT DAY. 
&gt;&gt; HE SEEMED VERY CRANKY TO ME. 

03:11:02.185 --> 03:11:06.094
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ON THE HEELS OF THE 
BILL TAYLOR TEXT. 

03:11:06.095 --> 03:11:08.395
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY TO

03:11:08.625 --> 03:11:11.514
YOU ON SEPTEMBER NINTH THAT YOU 
REMEMBER? 

03:11:11.515 --> 03:11:15.745
&gt;&gt; WORDS TO THE EFFECT, I 
DECIDED TO ASK THE PRESIDENT THE

03:11:15.985 --> 03:11:20.265
QUESTION IN AN OPEN ENDED 
FASHION BECAUSE THERE WERE SO 

03:11:20.495 --> 03:11:22.495
MANY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS 
FLOATING AROUND AS TO WHAT WAS 

03:11:22.715 --> 03:11:27.175
GOING ON WITH UKRAINE, RATHER 
THAN ASK THE PRESIDENT NINE 

03:11:27.415 --> 03:11:31.435
DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, IS THIS 
THIS OR THAT, I SAID WHAT DO YOU

03:11:31.665 --> 03:11:35.945
WANT FROM UKRAINE, I MAY HAVE 
USED A FOUR LETTER WORD. HE SAID

03:11:36.190 --> 03:11:40.275
I WANT NOTHING, NO QUID PRO QUO 
I JUST WANT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:46.805
TO DO THE RIGHT THING OR DO WHAT
HE RAN ON OR WORDS TO THAT 

03:11:50.535 --> 03:11:55.385
EFFECT. THAT GAVE ME THE PIPETUS
TO RESPOND TO AMBASSADOR TAYLOR,

03:11:55.615 --> 03:12:03.725
IT WAS NOT AN ARTFULLY WRITTEN 
TEXT BUT YOU WANTED AMBASSADOR 

03:12:03.978 --> 03:12:07.325
TAYLOR TO PICKUP THE BALL AND 
TAKE IT FROM THERE, I HAD GONE 

03:12:07.555 --> 03:12:10.475
AS FAR AS I COULD GO. 
&gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT, 

03:12:10.705 --> 03:12:14.175
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM NOT GOING

03:12:14.535 --> 03:12:18.015
TO CHARACTERIZE WHETHER I 
BELIEVED OR DID NOT BELIEVE I 

03:12:18.245 --> 03:12:23.934
WAS JUST TRYING TO CONVEY WHAT 
WAS SAID ON THE PHONE. 

03:12:23.935 --> 03:12:28.275
&gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME THE AID WAS 
PAUSED FOR 55 DAYS, 

03:12:31.815 --> 03:12:34.635
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN 
PILITIOC, AT THAT TIME THE 

03:12:35.005 --> 03:12:37.385
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GETTING CALLS
FROM SENATORS AND GETTING 

03:12:38.475 --> 03:12:40.434
PRESSURE TO LIFT THE AID, 
CORRECT? 

03:12:40.435 --> 03:12:45.174
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND, 
YES. 

03:12:45.175 --> 03:12:50.345
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO TURN BACK TO YOUR 
OPENER ON PAGE FIVE WHEN YOU 

03:12:50.585 --> 03:12:52.585
TALK ABOUT IN 

03:12:54.965 --> 03:12:58.195
THE ABSENCE OF ANY CREDIBLE 
EXPLANATION FOR THE SUSPENSION 

03:12:58.425 --> 03:13:02.325
OF AID I LATER CAME TO BELIEVE 
THAT THE SECURITY AID WOULD NOT 

03:13:03.315 --> 03:13:08.665
OCCUR UNTIL THERE WAS A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT FROM UKRAINE KRITTING 

03:13:09.905 --> 03:13:11.653
TO THE INVESTIGATION, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

03:13:11.654 --> 03:13:14.874
&gt;&gt; YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS 
SPECULATION. 

03:13:14.875 --> 03:13:18.315
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A PRESUMPTION. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A GUESS, YOU SAID THIS

03:13:18.545 --> 03:13:22.985
MORNING. 
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WANT TO SAY THAT IT 

03:13:23.215 --> 03:13:26.715
GOES BACK TO MR. GOLDMAN'S 
POINT, TWO PLUS TWO EQUALED FOUR

03:13:26.945 --> 03:13:30.065
IN MY MIND AT THAT POINT. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU DID NOT HAVE ANY 

03:13:30.295 --> 03:13:32.825
EVIDENCE OF THAT. 
&gt;&gt; OTHER THAN THE AID WAS NOT 

03:13:33.055 --> 03:13:37.745
BEING RELEASED AND WE WERE NOT 
GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THE 

03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:39.980
UKRAINIANS. 
&gt;&gt; DID AMBASSADOR VOLKER CLUE 

03:13:40.005 --> 03:13:44.635
YOU IN THAT WAS THE ISSUE. THIS 
IS A PRETTY SERIOUS CONCLUSION 

03:13:45.415 --> 03:13:48.944
THAT YOU HAVE REACHED WITHOUT 
PRECISE EVIDENCE. 

03:13:48.945 --> 03:13:51.935
&gt;&gt; I SENT THAT E-MAIL TO 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

03:13:52.165 --> 03:13:56.750
TO SET UP A POTENTIAL MEETING 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

03:13:57.115 --> 03:14:01.195
AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IN WARSAW
WHEN YOU REFERRED TO THE LOG JAM

03:14:01.425 --> 03:14:06.775
I REFERRED TO THE LOG JAM IN A 
VERY INCLUSIVE WAY, EVERYTHING 

03:14:07.010 --> 03:14:10.375
WAG JAMMED UP AT THAT POINT AND 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

03:14:10.605 --> 03:14:18.480
GAVE ME THE GREEN LIGHT TO BRIEF
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY ABOUT MAKING 

03:14:18.715 --> 03:14:22.155
THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WE 

03:14:25.975 --> 03:14:29.684
CAN TURN TO THAT. THAT WAS YOUR 
E-MAIL DATED WHAT DATE? 

03:14:29.685 --> 03:14:34.795
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE A PAGE. 
&gt;&gt; YOUR E-MAIL 

03:14:38.515 --> 03:14:40.515
TO SECRETARY POMPEO, WAS THAT 
AUGUST 11TH? 

03:14:44.775 --> 03:14:46.775
&gt;&gt; AUGUST 22 

03:14:52.925 --> 03:14:57.045
&gt;&gt; SO YOU ARE ASKED SECRETARY OF
STATE MIKE POMPEO IF YOU SHOULD 

03:14:57.275 --> 03:15:00.035
BLOCK IT. IS THERE ANY 
DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC 

03:15:00.265 --> 03:15:03.535
INVESTIGATION OR BIDEN AND 
BURISMA OR ANYTHING LINKING TO 

03:15:03.775 --> 03:15:07.655
AID IN THIS E-MAIL THAT YOU SENT
TO SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 

03:15:07.885 --> 03:15:09.885
POMPEO. 
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A PROPOSED BRIEFING 

03:15:09.985 --> 03:15:13.891
THAT I WAS GOING TO GIVE 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND I WAS 

03:15:14.125 --> 03:15:19.445
GOING TO CALL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
AND ASK HIM TO SAY WHAT IS IN 

03:15:19.685 --> 03:15:21.685
THIS E-MAIL 

03:15:23.175 --> 03:15:29.455
AND I WAS ASKING ESSENTIALLY 
PRESIDENT POMPEO'S PERMISSION TO

03:15:30.035 --> 03:15:35.225
DO THAT, WHICH HE SAID YES. 
&gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME WE ARE TALKING 

03:15:35.455 --> 03:15:38.185
ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE 
2016 ELECTION, WE ARE NOT 

03:15:38.415 --> 03:15:42.025
TALKING ABOUT JOE BIDEN. 
&gt;&gt; JOE BIDEN DID NOT COME UP. 

03:15:42.255 --> 03:15:50.305
&gt;&gt; STEPPING BACK APAGE TO YOUR 
E-MAIL TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

03:15:50.585 --> 03:15:53.955
ON AUGUST 11TH, YOU E-MAILED 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

03:15:54.195 --> 03:15:58.505
AND YOU SAID KURT AND I GOARGTED
A STATEMENT TO BE DELIVERED 

03:15:58.745 --> 03:16:02.475
WITHIN A DAY OR TWO. THE 
QUESTION I HAVE HERE, THAT 

03:16:02.705 --> 03:16:05.705
STATEMENT NEVER WAS ISSUED AND 
IN FACT AMBASSADOR VOLKER HAS 

03:16:05.935 --> 03:16:09.545
TESTIFIED THAT HE DID NOT THINK 
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND 

03:16:09.775 --> 03:16:13.445
ULTIMATELY THE UKRAINIANS DID 
NOT THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO 

03:16:13.675 --> 03:16:19.204
THE STATEMENT NEVER REACHED A 
FINALIZED STATE. 

03:16:19.205 --> 03:16:24.915
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; BUT EVEN IF IT HAD, IT DOES 

03:16:25.145 --> 03:16:29.554
NOT TALK ABOUT BIDENS OR BURISMA
OR ANYTHING INSIDIOUS. 

03:16:29.555 --> 03:16:36.375
&gt;&gt; THE STATEMENT AS I RECALLED 
WOULD HAVE MENTIONED THE 2016 

03:16:36.605 --> 03:16:39.704
ELECTION/DNC SERVER AND BURISMA 
AND NOT THE BIDENS. 

03:16:39.705 --> 03:16:44.645
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU HEARD AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER ABOUT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT

03:16:44.885 --> 03:16:47.034
AN INVESTIGATION INTO BURISMA. 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

03:16:47.035 --> 03:16:52.495
&gt;&gt; HE HAS SAID THAT IF THERE 
WERE UKRAINIANS ENGAGED IN 

03:16:52.725 --> 03:16:54.965
VIOLATIONS OF UKRAINIAN LAW THE 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL WITH 

03:16:58.525 --> 03:17:02.555
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION OUGHT TO 
INVESTIGATE THAT. DID AMBASSADOR

03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:10.925
VOLKER EVER RELATE THAT TO YOU. 
&gt;&gt; WE JUST TALKED IN GENERIC 

03:17:11.155 --> 03:17:12.284
TERMS ABOUT INVESTIGATING 
BURISMA. 

03:17:12.285 --> 03:17:16.164
&gt;&gt; IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. 

03:17:16.165 --> 03:17:23.885
&gt;&gt; I NEVER HEARD VICE PRESIDENT 
BIDEN COMING UP UNTIL LATE IN 

03:17:24.105 --> 03:17:26.315
THE GAME. MAYBE AFTER THE 
TRANSCRIPT OF THE JULY 25TH 

03:17:26.546 --> 03:17:30.325
CALL. I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I MADE 
THE CONNECTION, APPARENTLY A LOT

03:17:30.555 --> 03:17:32.384
OF PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE THE 
CONNECTION. 

03:17:32.385 --> 03:17:38.645
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO TURN TO THE LETTER 
FROM JUROR JOHNSON. WHEN HE 

03:17:38.875 --> 03:17:43.745
HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES
AND HOLDING THE AID HE CALLED 

03:17:44.115 --> 03:17:48.905
THE PRESIDENT ON AUGUST 31, IT'S
PAGE SIX OF HIS LETTER, SENATOR 

03:17:49.265 --> 03:17:54.005
JOHNSON WRITES I ASKED HIM, THE 
PRESIDENT, WHETHER THERE IS SOME

03:17:54.365 --> 03:17:57.515
KIND OF AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE 
UKRAINE WOULD TAKE SOME ACTION 

03:17:57.905 --> 03:18:03.245
AND THE HOLD WOULD BE LIFTED. 
WITHOUT HESITATION PRESIDENT 

03:18:03.485 --> 03:18:10.860
DONALD TRUMP IMMEDIATELY DENIED 
SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTED. 

03:18:11.085 --> 03:18:13.806
SENATOR JOHNSON QUOTES THE 
PRESIDENT WITH SAYING NO WAY, I 

03:18:14.045 --> 03:18:16.045
WOULD NEVER 

03:18:17.755 --> 03:18:23.865
THAT, WHO TOLD YOU THAT? SENATOR
JOHNSON SAID I HAVE ACCURATELY 

03:18:24.535 --> 03:18:26.935
CHARACTERIZED THE PRESIDENT'S 
REACTION AS ADAMANT, VEHEMENT 

03:18:27.165 --> 03:18:31.315
AND ANGRY, THE PHONE CALL WITH 
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT A PUBLIC 

03:18:32.095 --> 03:18:35.265
EVENT, IT WAS CAPTURING A AGAIN 
WIN MOMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT 

03:18:35.505 --> 03:18:41.425
AND HE HAD AT THIS POINT IN TIME
ON AUGUST 31 HE WAS ADAMANT, 

03:18:41.655 --> 03:18:47.775
VEHEMENT AND ANGRY THAT THERE 
WAS THOUGH CONNECTION TO AID. NO

03:18:48.025 --> 03:18:50.805
PRE- CONDITIONS. 
&gt;&gt; I HAD MY MEETING WITH SENATOR

03:18:51.045 --> 03:18:55.955
JOHNSON WHERE AGAIN I MADE THE 
PRESUMPTION THAT I MADE TO BOTH 

03:18:56.195 --> 03:19:00.925
MR. YURMAK AND THE E-MAIL I 
SEPTEMBER TO SECRETARY POMPEO 

03:19:01.159 --> 03:19:04.455
AND WE WERE RUMINATING ABOUT 
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SENATOR 

03:19:04.685 --> 03:19:07.290
JOHNSON I BELIEVE SAID I AM 
GOING TO CALL PRESIDENT DONALD 

03:19:07.515 --> 03:19:11.135
TRUMP AND FIND OUT AND THEN HE 
OBVIOUSLY HAD THAT PHONE CALL. I

03:19:11.370 --> 03:19:13.624
WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THAT PHONE 
CALL. 

03:19:13.625 --> 03:19:20.125
&gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE NO REASON TO 
DISBELIEVE THAT WAS THE WAY IT 

03:19:20.485 --> 03:19:22.515
WENT DOWN. 
&gt;&gt; NO REASON TO DISBELIEVE 

03:19:22.755 --> 03:19:27.615
SENATOR JOHNSON. 
&gt;&gt; NOW THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME 

03:19:27.855 --> 03:19:30.255
TIME AND YOU SUBMITTED 

03:19:34.755 --> 03:19:40.535
AN ADDENDUM RELATED TO THE 
WARSAW MEETING. ARE WE MISSING 

03:19:40.902 --> 03:19:42.054
YOUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. 

03:19:42.055 --> 03:19:44.995
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT HAD THAT MANY 
COMMUNICATE CAUTIONS WITH THE 

03:19:45.225 --> 03:19:51.775
PRESIDENT AND THE CALL RECORDS 
THAT I HAD HAD ACCESS TO, THE 

03:19:52.012 --> 03:19:56.225
CALL RECORDS INDICATE THAT I 
NEVER GOT THROUGH, I CANNOT GIVE

03:19:56.455 --> 03:20:00.185
YOU AN ACCURATE COUNT OF HOW 
MANY CONVERSATIONS PLUS I HAVE 

03:20:00.415 --> 03:20:04.995
HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT ABOUT COMPLETELY 

03:20:05.245 --> 03:20:07.774
UNRELATED MATTERS THAT HAVE 
NOTHING TO DO WITH UKRAINE. 

03:20:07.775 --> 03:20:11.495
&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT THINK THAT WE ARE 
MISSING ANY MATERIAL 

03:20:11.735 --> 03:20:15.275
CONVERSATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT RECALL ANY MATERIAL 

03:20:15.505 --> 03:20:17.629
CONVERSATIONS TODAY AS I AM 
SITTING HERE. 

03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:21.525
&gt;&gt; OR WITH RUDY GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; MY MEMORY ABOUT THE 

03:20:21.755 --> 03:20:24.865
CONVERSATIONS WITH RUDY GIULIANI
WHETHER THEY WERE DIRECT OR 

03:20:25.095 --> 03:20:31.335
CONFERENCE CALLS WITH AMBASSADOR
VOLKER OR SECRETARY PERRY IS 

03:20:31.565 --> 03:20:34.364
REALLY VAGUE WITHOUT SEEING THE 
CALL LOGS. 

03:20:34.365 --> 03:20:39.425
&gt;&gt; ARE THERE ANY OTHER KEY FACT 
WITNESSES THAT WOULD HELP US GET

03:20:39.685 --> 03:20:47.234
TO THE BOTTOM OF WHETHER THERE 
WAS A LINK TO THE AID. 

03:20:47.235 --> 03:20:50.195
&gt;&gt; MAYBE BRIAN MCCORMACK, THE 
CHIEF OF STEF FOR SECRETARY 

03:20:50.445 --> 03:20:55.124
PERRY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THAT 
AS WELL. 

03:20:55.125 --> 03:20:59.795
&gt;&gt; NOW THE AID WAS ULTIMATELY 
LIFTED ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, 

03:21:00.035 --> 03:21:04.685
CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT. 

03:21:04.915 --> 03:21:09.595
&gt;&gt; STHOR SENATOR JOHNSON IN HIS 
LETTER ON PAGE SIX QUOTES THE 

03:21:09.815 --> 03:21:13.575
PRESIDENT ON AUGUST 31, RON, I 
UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION, WE ARE

03:21:13.795 --> 03:21:20.145
REVIEWING IT NOW AND YOU WILL 
PROBABLY LIKE MY FINAL DECISION,

03:21:20.375 --> 03:21:25.175
EVEN ON AUGUST 31 EVEN BEFORE 
ANY CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION 

03:21:25.535 --> 03:21:27.424
STARTED, THE PRESIDENT WAS 
SIGNALING TO SENATOR JOHNSON 

03:21:27.425 --> 03:21:31.774
THAT HE WAS GOING TO LIFT THE 
AID. 

03:21:31.775 --> 03:21:34.645
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LIKE IT YES. 
&gt;&gt; MOST OF THE OTHER WITNESSES 

03:21:34.885 --> 03:21:36.885
WE TALKED TO, WHETHER FROM 

03:21:39.695 --> 03:21:44.475
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR 
OMB, HAVE TOLD US THAT ALL ALONG

03:21:44.715 --> 03:21:49.675
DURING THE 55 DAY PERIOD THEY 
BELIEVED THAT THE HOLD WOULD BE 

03:21:49.905 --> 03:21:51.774
LIFTED. WAS THAT YOUR FEELING AT
THE TIME. 

03:21:51.775 --> 03:21:56.735
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW, EVERY TIME I 
WAS ASKED ABOUT THE HOLD I WAS 

03:21:56.965 --> 03:22:02.535
NOT GIVEN A STRAIGHT ANSWER AS 
TO WHY IT'S BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO

03:22:02.769 --> 03:22:09.155
BEGIN WITH. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 

03:22:09.385 --> 03:22:14.256
UKRAINE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE AID.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S VAGUE, I DO NOT KNOW 

03:22:14.485 --> 03:22:17.644
IF IT WAS THE PILITICO AID OR 
FROM RUDY GIULIANI. 

03:22:17.645 --> 03:22:22.415
&gt;&gt; DURING YOUR DEPOSITION YOU 
TESTIFIED THAT YOU DID 

03:22:25.715 --> 03:22:29.735
NOT BELIEVE THAT THE UKRAINIANS 
BELIEVED OR WERE AWARE OF THE 

03:22:29.965 --> 03:22:33.855
HOLD UNTIL THE PILITICO ARTICLE.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT I TESTIFIED THAT

03:22:34.095 --> 03:22:39.255
I WAS NOT CLEAR ON THE EXACT 
DATES AND WHEN THE LIGHT WENT 

03:22:39.485 --> 03:22:44.345
ON. THERE WERE A LOT OF 
CONVERSATIONS GOING ON WITH THE 

03:22:44.585 --> 03:22:50.335
UKRAINIANS BY A LOT OF PEOPLE I 
DO NOT KNOW WHO COMMUNICATED 

03:22:50.565 --> 03:22:53.765
WHAT TO THEM. 
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO

03:22:53.995 --> 03:22:57.545
SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS CONCERNED
ABOUT FOREIGN AID GENERALLY, HE 

03:22:57.775 --> 03:23:02.235
WAS TRYING TO BE A GOOD STEWARD 
OF UNITED STATES TAXPAYER 

03:23:02.475 --> 03:23:04.515
DOLLARS. 
&gt;&gt; I AM AWARE THAT HAS BEEN HIS 

03:23:04.745 --> 03:23:07.024
POSITION ON AID AND OTHER 
MATTERS. 

03:23:07.025 --> 03:23:12.555
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE THAT HE WAS 
ALSO INTERESTED IN BETTER 

03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:14.564
UNDERSTANDING THE CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES. 

03:23:14.565 --> 03:23:17.704
&gt;&gt; THAT I AM DEFINITELY AWARE 
OF. 

03:23:17.705 --> 03:23:21.561
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS SOME BACK AND 
FOURTH BETWEEN THE STATE 

03:23:21.795 --> 03:23:23.904
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TRYING TO 
BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT. 

03:23:23.905 --> 03:23:26.235
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WAS NOT 

03:23:26.468 --> 03:23:31.684
THE REASON FOR THE HOW OLD. 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT. 

03:23:31.685 --> 03:23:37.645
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU SPECULATE THAT THERE 
WAS A LINK TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

03:23:37.879 --> 03:23:39.879
&gt;&gt; I 

03:23:42.855 --> 03:23:47.645
PRESUMED IT YES. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. I WANT TO TURN QUICKLY 

03:23:49.125 --> 03:23:56.785
TO THE JULY 10TH MEETING. THE 
JULY 10TH MEETING IN AMBASSADOR 

03:23:59.425 --> 03:24:01.425
BOLTON'S OFFICE INVOLVING 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER, MR. DANILUK 

03:24:02.125 --> 03:24:05.675
HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SOME 
CONTROVERSY, AMBASSADOR VOLKER 

03:24:05.925 --> 03:24:10.095
YESTERDAY TESTIFIED THAT IT WAS 
NOT UNTIL THE END 

03:24:13.335 --> 03:24:15.955
OF THE MEETING, HE SAID MR. 
DANILUK WAS GOING THROUGH 

03:24:16.185 --> 03:24:18.795
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
PLANS HE HAD. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 

03:24:19.275 --> 03:24:23.215
THE END OF THE MEETING THAT 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER REMEMBERS THAT

03:24:23.945 --> 03:24:25.944
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING GENERAL 
ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS, WHAT DO 

03:24:25.945 --> 03:24:31.795
YOU REMEMBER FROM THAT MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT GOING TO DISPUTE 

03:24:32.045 --> 03:24:36.676
AMBASSADOR VOLKER'S RECOLLECTION
PARTICULARLY IF HE HAS NOTES. I 

03:24:36.905 --> 03:24:43.005
KNOW THAT THE DESIRE TO HAVE THE
2016 ELECTION DNC SERVER AND 

03:24:43.235 --> 03:24:45.685
BURISMA WERE ALREADY BEING 
DISCUSSED BY THEM. AGAIN YOU 

03:24:45.925 --> 03:24:52.175
HAVE NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH RUDY
GIULIANI ON JULY 10TH. BUT 

03:24:52.415 --> 03:24:55.055
THROUGH AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND I 
HAVE PROBABLY MENTIONED THAT 

03:24:55.275 --> 03:25:00.345
THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN NORDZ TO 
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD. THAT 

03:25:02.885 --> 03:25:08.975
SEEMED TO BE THE CONVENTIONAL 
WISDOM AT THE TIME. I DO NOT 

03:25:09.215 --> 03:25:13.295
RECALL ANY ABRUPT ENDING OF THE 
MEETING OR PEOPLE STORMING OUT. 

03:25:13.545 --> 03:25:19.375
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
MEMORABLE IF SOMEONE STORMED OUT

03:25:19.615 --> 03:25:21.945
OF A MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; NOBODY ACCUSED YOU OF BEING 

03:25:22.175 --> 03:25:26.375
INVOLVED IN A DRUG DEAL. 
&gt;&gt; DID DOCTOR HILL EVER RELATE 

03:25:26.615 --> 03:25:30.224
HER CONCERNS ABOUT YOU BEING 
INVOLVED IN A DRUG DEAL. 

03:25:30.225 --> 03:25:34.505
&gt;&gt; NEVER. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE SURPRISED WHEN 

03:25:34.755 --> 03:25:37.555
TESTIMONY EMERGED THAT SHE 
THOUGHT THERE WAS A DRUG DEAL 

03:25:37.785 --> 03:25:39.294
GOING ON. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS SHOCKED. 

03:25:39.295 --> 03:25:42.614
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A MEETING WHERE YOU 
TOOK A PICTURE. 

03:25:42.615 --> 03:25:45.505
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR BOLTON OR HIS 
ASSISTANT INDICATED THAT HE WAS 

03:25:45.728 --> 03:25:49.865
OUT OF TIME. HE HAD ANOTHER 
MEETING TO ATTEND AND WE ALL 

03:25:50.095 --> 03:25:52.735
WALKED OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 
EVERYONE WAS SMILING AND HAPPY 

03:25:52.965 --> 03:25:57.804
AND WE TOOK A PICTURE ON THE 
LAWN ON A NICE SUNNY DAY. 

03:25:57.805 --> 03:26:01.254
&gt;&gt; DID YOU RETIRE TO THE WARD 
ROOM? 

03:26:01.255 --> 03:26:06.605
&gt;&gt; I THINK SECRETARY PERRY ASKED
TO USE THE WARD ROOM TO CONTINUE

03:26:06.845 --> 03:26:10.935
THE CONVERSATION AND THE REAL 
SUBJECT THAT WAS UNDER DEBATE 

03:26:11.165 --> 03:26:15.795
AND IT WAS NOT AN ANGRY DEBATE, 
SHOULD THE CALL FROM PRESIDENT 

03:26:16.025 --> 03:26:21.075
DONALD TRUMP TO PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY BE MADE PRIOR TO THE 

03:26:21.305 --> 03:26:25.365
PARLIAMENT ELECTION IN UKRAINE 
OR AFTER THE PARLIAMENTARY 

03:26:25.595 --> 03:26:31.395
ELECTIONS. THERE WAS GOOD REASON
FOR BOTH, WE FELT, AMBASSADOR 

03:26:32.715 --> 03:26:37.395
PERRY AND I AND AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP 

03:26:37.695 --> 03:26:46.592
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO SPEAK TO 
HIM BEFORE THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE

03:26:48.855 --> 03:26:51.955
IT WOULD GIVE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
MORE COVER. OTHERS SAID IT 

03:26:52.445 --> 03:26:57.245
SHOULD BE DONE AFTER AND 
ULTIMATELY IT WAS DONE AFTER. 

03:26:57.485 --> 03:27:01.225
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO MENTION OF VICE 
PRESIDENT BIDEN IN THE WARD 

03:27:01.445 --> 03:27:05.054
ROOM. 
&gt;&gt; NOT THAT I REMEMBER, NO. 

03:27:05.055 --> 03:27:08.704
&gt;&gt; OR ANY SPECIFIC 
INVESTIGATION? 

03:27:08.705 --> 03:27:10.705
&gt;&gt; JUST THE GENERIC 
INVESTIGATION 

03:27:26.355 --> 03:27:32.045
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ALWAYS BURISMA TO ME, 
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 

03:27:32.275 --> 03:27:34.304
CONNECTION BETWEEN BURISMA AND 
BIDEN. 

03:27:34.305 --> 03:27:40.025
&gt;&gt; TO YOU BET BEST OF YOUR 
KNOWLEDGE YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND

03:27:40.255 --> 03:27:42.255
THAT ANYONE WAS 

03:27:44.605 --> 03:27:46.674
ASKING UKRAINIANS TO INVESTIGATE
US PERSONS? 

03:27:46.675 --> 03:27:49.974
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; 

03:27:49.975 --> 03:27:56.455
&gt;&gt; JUST TO BE CLEAR HERE, 
ULTIMATELY, THE AD WAS LIFTED 

03:27:56.695 --> 03:27:59.875
SEPTEMBER 11TH. THERE WAS NEVER 
ANY ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE 

03:28:00.105 --> 03:28:02.395
UKRAINIANS ABOUT ANY 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY 

03:28:06.235 --> 03:28:08.619
WERE GOING TO DO, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

03:28:08.620 --> 03:28:13.964
&gt;&gt; THE UKRAINIANS NEVER STARTED 
THE INVESTIGATION, CORRECT? 

03:28:13.965 --> 03:28:19.855
&gt;&gt; NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. 
&gt;&gt; CONSEQUENTLY, THESE 

03:28:20.085 --> 03:28:25.195
ALLEGATIONS THAT THERE WAS A 
QUID PRO QUO THAT HAD TO BE 

03:28:25.426 --> 03:28:30.765
ENFORCED BEFORE THE AID IS 
RELEASED NEVER CAME TO FRUITION.

03:28:30.995 --> 03:28:36.455
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT BELIEVE SO. 
&gt;&gt; 

03:28:44.275 --> 03:28:53.625
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO STEP BACK A LITTLE 
BIT AND ASK ABOUT THE 

03:28:55.495 --> 03:28:58.435
CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEEP ROOTED 
CONCERNS ABOUT UKRAINE AND YOU 

03:28:58.695 --> 03:29:00.845
BELIEVED HIM. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN WE HAD THE CONVERSATION 

03:29:01.105 --> 03:29:05.145
I DID. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED 

03:29:05.415 --> 03:29:07.415
DISCUSSING THE 

03:29:08.925 --> 03:29:13.365
CONCERNS THE PRESIDENT HAD WITH 
CORRUPTION, BURISMA WAS NOT THE 

03:29:13.895 --> 03:29:17.435
ONLY COMPANY THAT WAS MENTIONED.
&gt;&gt; IT 

03:29:20.525 --> 03:29:26.455
WAS A GENERIC CORRUPTION 
OLIGARCHS JUST BAD STUFF GOING 

03:29:26.685 --> 03:29:28.855
ON IN UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; OTHER COMPANIES CAME, DIDN'T 

03:29:29.085 --> 03:29:32.275
THEY. 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY WERE 

03:29:32.515 --> 03:29:37.250
MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY, IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN NAFTA GAS, THAT MIGHT 

03:29:37.495 --> 03:29:44.035
HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM. 
&gt;&gt; AT ONE POINT IN YOUR 

03:29:44.275 --> 03:29:47.770
DEPOSITION YOU SAID NAFTA GAS 
COMES UP IN EVERY CONVERSATION, 

03:29:48.135 --> 03:29:50.135
IS THAT FAIR? 
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY. 

03:29:52.555 --> 03:29:58.315
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD, I GUESS DOCTOR HILL 
AT ONE POINT ADISTRICTED TO YOU 

03:29:58.665 --> 03:30:02.335
THE TERMINOLOGY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN YOU A LARGE 

03:30:02.565 --> 03:30:05.944
REMIX, ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HER
ASSERTION OF THAT. 

03:30:05.945 --> 03:30:09.034
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE
WAS TALKING ABOUT. 

03:30:09.035 --> 03:30:14.265
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE AND WE GOT INTO 
THIS A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR 

03:30:14.495 --> 03:30:19.245
DEPOSITION, YOU SAID THAT THE 
PRESIDENT GAVE YOU A SPECIAL 

03:30:19.615 --> 03:30:21.024
ASSIGNMENT WITH REGARDS TO 
UKRAINE, CORRECT? 

03:30:21.025 --> 03:30:28.725
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRESIDENT APPOINTED 
ME TO BE THE US A.M. BOOS DOOR 

03:30:28.965 --> 03:30:30.965
TO 

03:30:32.145 --> 03:30:37.115
THE EUROPEAN UNION, EASY UKRAINE
WAS PART OF MY PORTFOLIO, 

03:30:37.425 --> 03:30:40.785
NUGGETS WERE THE UNIQUE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS NO

03:30:41.255 --> 03:30:44.265
CURRENT SITTING SITTING 
AMBASSADOR IN UKRAINE AND THERE 

03:30:44.505 --> 03:30:50.145
WAS A NEW PRESIDENT IN UKRAINE 
AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD,

03:30:50.375 --> 03:30:56.075
THE 3 AMIGOS, PERRY, AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER AND I WAS THAT UKRAINE 

03:30:56.305 --> 03:30:58.305
NEEDED EXTRAORDINARY HIGH LEVEL 
SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES 

03:30:58.375 --> 03:31:04.955
DURING THIS PERIOD WHICH WE 
CLEARED WITH BOTH AMBASSADOR 

03:31:05.200 --> 03:31:11.015
BOLTON AND CHIEF OF STAFF MICK 
MULVANEY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON 

03:31:11.245 --> 03:31:14.075
IT. BY EXTENSION, IF THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND 

03:31:14.795 --> 03:31:17.905
THE CHIEF OF STAFF APPROVE YOUR 
REMIX IT IS COMING FROM THE 

03:31:18.135 --> 03:31:20.315
PRESIDENT. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN WE HAD THE DEPOSITION 

03:31:20.545 --> 03:31:23.054
YOU SAID I WAS SPINNING A LITTLE
BIT. 

03:31:23.055 --> 03:31:26.775
&gt;&gt; I WAS SPUNKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING ELSE IN THE INTERVIEW 

03:31:27.005 --> 03:31:29.895
IN KIEV. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU FURTHER TESTIFIED 

03:31:30.135 --> 03:31:34.315
WHEN I SAID THE PRESIDENT GAVE 
ME AN ASSIGNMENT IT WAS NOT THE 

03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:38.975
PRESIDENT IT WAS THE SECRETARY 
THROUGH THE PRESIDENT. THAT'S 

03:31:39.205 --> 03:31:41.205
WHERE 

03:31:42.235 --> 03:31:43.704
I RECEIVED MY DIRECTION, 
CORRECT. 

03:31:43.705 --> 03:31:45.705
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

03:31:47.215 --> 03:31:50.925
&gt;&gt; DID A.M.AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
EVER BRING ANY CONCERNS TO YOUR 

03:31:51.155 --> 03:31:53.934
ATTENTION ABOUT THE CHANNEL THAT
HE DUBBED IRREGULAR. 

03:31:53.935 --> 03:32:00.255
&gt;&gt; IN FACT THE OPPOSITE. WHEN HE
CAME TO POST, I THINK, I THOUGH 

03:32:00.495 --> 03:32:06.565
I CALLED HIM OR HE CALLED ME, I 
THINK THAT THE SPOKE WITH 

03:32:06.795 --> 03:32:09.565
SECRETARY PERRY AND AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER SEPARATELY AND IN THE 

03:32:09.796 --> 03:32:15.435
COURSE OF THE FIRST FEW WEEKS HE
WAS HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE THAT A 

03:32:15.665 --> 03:32:19.575
NEW AMBASSADOR COMING TO POST 
LIKE HIMSELF WAS GETTING THE 

03:32:19.805 --> 03:32:25.325
KIND OF SUPPORT HE WAS GETTING 
FROM ALL THREE OF US, HAVING A 

03:32:25.555 --> 03:32:29.935
CABINET MEMBER A SPECIAL ENVOY 
AND A FELLOW AMBASSADOR HELPING 

03:32:30.165 --> 03:32:34.735
TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF UKRAINE,
HE WAS APPRECIATIVE AND 

03:32:34.965 --> 03:32:36.874
COMPLIMENTARY. 
&gt;&gt; YOU MAINTAINED AN OPEN LINE 

03:32:36.875 --> 03:32:39.695
WITH HIM. 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT, THERE ARE A NUMBER 

03:32:39.929 --> 03:32:43.365
OF TEXTS, SOME OF WHICH I HAVE 
SOME OF WHICH I DO NOT WHERE HE 

03:32:43.605 --> 03:32:48.754
IS REACHING OUT TO ME AND THE 
OTHERS FOR ADVICE AND HELP. 

03:32:48.755 --> 03:32:52.075
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE 215 TEXT 

03:32:55.435 --> 03:32:58.435
MESSAGES BETWEEN YOU, AMBASSADOR
VOLKER ANDAMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

03:32:59.095 --> 03:33:02.385
DURING THE EARLY AUGUST TIME 
FRAME, DOES HAD A MAKE SENSE TO 

03:33:02.625 --> 03:33:07.845
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT AMBASSADOR 

03:33:08.095 --> 03:33:13.454
TAYLOR STARTED IN LATE JUNE OR 
EARLY JULY. 

03:33:13.455 --> 03:33:16.905
&gt;&gt; HE NEVER COMMUNICATED ANY 
CONCERNS THAT HE HAD ISSUES WITH

03:33:17.135 --> 03:33:21.665
WHAT WAS GOING ON. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT WAS 

03:33:21.905 --> 03:33:23.905
GOING ON? 
&gt;&gt; THIS REQUEST FOR SOME SORT OF

03:33:24.075 --> 03:33:26.075
INVESTIGATION 

03:33:53.723 --> 03:33:55.723
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU 

03:34:07.729 --> 03:34:14.287
TAYLOR, . 
&gt;&gt;&gt; HE SAID LET'S GET ON THE 

03:34:14.617 --> 03:34:16.396
PHONE. RIGHT? AND INDIVIDUAL 
THAT DOESN'T LIKE TO WALK 

03:34:16.397 --> 03:34:18.397
THROUGH THESE ISSUES IN TEXT 
WHEN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT 

03:34:23.006 --> 03:34:27.385
IT ON THE TELEPHONE. 
&gt;&gt; I SAY THAT WHEN IT BECOMES 

03:34:27.585 --> 03:34:29.754
MORE SUBSTANTIVE THAN A FEW 
LINES OF TEXT. 

03:34:29.755 --> 03:34:33.463
&gt;&gt; DID YOU TALK WITH AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR? 

03:34:33.464 --> 03:34:37.193
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL WHETHER WE 
SPOKE OR WHETHER HE CALLED THE 

03:34:37.343 --> 03:34:40.023
SECRETARY. MR. CASTER WANTED TO 
GET THE NOTION ACROSS THAT I 

03:34:40.283 --> 03:34:43.736
HAVE GONE AS FAR AS I CAN GO 
WITH THIS. YOU ARE THE 

03:34:43.886 --> 03:34:50.156
AMBASSADOR, YOU NEED TO PICK UP 
THE BALL AND RUN WITH IT. 

03:34:50.157 --> 03:34:52.997
&gt;&gt; OKAY. JUST GETTING BACK TO 
THE IRREGULAR CHANNEL. ANYBODY 

03:34:53.137 --> 03:34:55.246
EXPRESS CONCERNS TO YOU ABOUT 
THIS? 

03:34:55.247 --> 03:34:58.443
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE HOW SOMEONE 
COULD CHARACTERIZE SOMEONE AS AN

03:34:58.593 --> 03:35:01.754
IRREGULAR CHANNEL WHEN YOU ARE 
TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

03:35:01.914 --> 03:35:04.624
UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE, THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

03:35:04.814 --> 03:35:08.774
ADVISER, THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SECRETARY 

03:35:09.014 --> 03:35:13.454
OF ENERGY. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
IS IRREGULAR IF A BUNCH OF FOLKS

03:35:14.613 --> 03:35:18.623
THAT ARE NOT IN THAT CHANNEL ARE
AGGRIEVED FOR SOME REASON FOR 

03:35:19.323 --> 03:35:22.683
NOT BEING INCLUDED, I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY CAN CONSIDER US TO BE 

03:35:22.833 --> 03:35:25.323
THE IRREGULAR CHANNEL AND THEY 
TO BE THE REGULAR CHANNEL WHEN 

03:35:25.623 --> 03:35:27.623
IT'S THE 

03:35:30.812 --> 03:35:32.812
LEADERSHIP THAT MAKES THE 
DECISIONS. 

03:35:35.742 --> 03:35:39.371
&gt;&gt; SO, THE CONCERNS, RAISED WERE
NEVER BROUGHT TO A HEAD? 

03:35:39.372 --> 03:35:43.491
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY WERE NEVER RAISED.
THEY 

03:35:46.711 --> 03:35:50.221
WERE NEVER RAISED. NO ONE SAID 
BACK OFF OF UKRAINE, THIS IS 

03:35:51.011 --> 03:35:55.431
DANGEROUS, YOU ARE DOING 
SOMETHING UNTOWARD. WE HAVE 

03:35:55.571 --> 03:35:59.150
CONCERNING. THERE WAS A BAD 
PHONE CALL JULY 25. THERE WAS 

03:35:59.740 --> 03:36:04.760
TALK OF A DRUG COCKTAIL. NO ONE 
SAID TO TO ME. BY PHONE, BY 

03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:09.660
TEXT, BY EMAIL. I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYBODY SOUNDING ANY ALARM BELL.

03:36:09.820 --> 03:36:12.649
HAD ANYONE MENTION IT, I WOULD 
HAVE 

03:36:16.369 --> 03:36:18.849
SAT UP AND TAKEN NOTICE.  
EVERYONE'S HAIR WAS ON FIRE BUT 

03:36:19.049 --> 03:36:26.258
NO ONE DECIDED TO TALK TO US. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TALK IN YOUR 

03:36:27.058 --> 03:36:31.068
STATEMENT ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF 
ANY CREDIBLE SUSPENSION OF 

03:36:35.368 --> 03:36:40.567
AID, IT WAS YOUR GUESS THAT IT 
WOULD NOT OCCUR UNTIL A PUBLIC 

03:36:40.857 --> 03:36:44.477
STATEMENT FROM UKRAINE. I 
BELIEVE YOU SAID AT THIS POINT, 

03:36:46.487 --> 03:36:50.736
YOU BELIEVED EVERYONE, EVERYONE 
KNEW THIS. IS THAT CORRECT? 

03:36:50.737 --> 03:36:56.666
&gt;&gt; I THINK ONCE THAT POLITICAL 
ARTICLE BROKE, IT STARTED MAKING

03:36:56.966 --> 03:36:59.256
THE ROUNDS THAT IF YOU CAN'T 
MAKE A WHITE HOUSE MEETING 

03:36:59.666 --> 03:37:03.876
WITHOUT THE STATEMENT, WHAT 
MAKES YOU THINK YOU WILL GET A 

03:37:04.086 --> 03:37:06.615
$400 MILLION CHECK? THAT WAS MY 
PRESUMPTION. 

03:37:06.616 --> 03:37:08.616
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAD NO EVIDENCE 

03:37:13.365 --> 03:37:17.214
TO PROVE THAT. CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 

03:37:17.215 --> 03:37:23.014
&gt;&gt; YOU STATED YOU HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR RECORDS? IS 

03:37:23.154 --> 03:37:26.414
THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; NOT ALL OF THEM. THERE ARE 

03:37:26.664 --> 03:37:31.624
LOTS OF NOTES, RECORDS, READOUTS
OF CALLS. CAN'T GET TO THEM. 

03:37:31.774 --> 03:37:36.962
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO STATED YOU DON'T 
TAKE NOTES RIGHT? 

03:37:36.963 --> 03:37:39.733
&gt;&gt; I DON'T. BUT THERE ARE 

03:37:43.723 --> 03:37:45.723
LOTS OF 

03:37:48.793 --> 03:37:52.132
OTHERS OUT THERE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO PAGES LONG

03:37:52.282 --> 03:37:54.841
OF I DON'T RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; IS THAT ALL? 

03:37:54.842 --> 03:38:01.162
&gt;&gt; ON A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS, 
THERE'S NUANCE. THERE'S 

03:38:01.522 --> 03:38:03.522
AMBIGUITY. WE 

03:38:06.521 --> 03:38:09.190
DON'T HAVE NOTES OR 
RECOLLECTIONS. 

03:38:09.191 --> 03:38:12.641
&gt;&gt; IT'S SITUATIONAL THINGS THAT 
TRIGGER MEMORY. I'M DEALING WITH

03:38:12.931 --> 03:38:15.921
THE 28 MEMBER COUNTRIES, THE 
EUROPEAN UNIONS. OTHER COUNTRIES

03:38:16.341 --> 03:38:20.000
NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT 
ARE PART OF MY MANDATE. I'M 

03:38:21.690 --> 03:38:23.690
DEALING 

03:38:25.730 --> 03:38:27.730
WITH 

03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:31.960
THE WHITE HOUSE LEADERSHIP. 
&gt;&gt; A PHONE CALL WITH THE 

03:38:32.250 --> 03:38:34.250
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

03:38:38.459 --> 03:38:42.939
FILL IN THE BLANK COUNTRY, THEY 
RIGHT REMEMBER 

03:38:46.979 --> 03:38:48.979
EVERY 

03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:56.322
SINGLE THING ABOUT IT. ALL OF 
THESE MEETINGS WITH VERY 

03:38:56.472 --> 03:39:00.924
IMPORTANT PEOPLE START TO BLEND 
TOGETHER UNTIL I HAVE SOMEONE 

03:39:01.724 --> 03:39:04.887
WHO CAN SHOW ME WHAT WE 
DISCUSSED. THEN IT COMES BACK. 

03:39:05.077 --> 03:39:09.075
&gt;&gt; WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE 
FACTS HERE. BILL TAYLOR KEPT 

03:39:09.225 --> 03:39:11.427
NOTES. HE BROUGHT A 

03:39:15.449 --> 03:39:22.912
LITTLE NOTEBOOK IN HIS POCKET. 
WHEN I'M AT ANY DESK, I USE 

03:39:24.172 --> 03:39:26.472
THIS. GEORGE KENT WROTE 
INNUMERABLE MEMOS. KATHERINE 

03:39:27.312 --> 03:39:29.792
CROFT TESTIFIED SHE DIDN'T 
BELIEVE THE 

03:39:34.711 --> 03:39:36.711
GEORGE NOTES WOULD BE 

03:39:40.721 --> 03:39:42.721
ACCURATE.

03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:52.089
THIS IS LIKE THE TRIFECTA OF 
UNRELIABILITY. 

03:39:52.090 --> 03:39:55.076
&gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO USE THE LIMITED
INFORMATION I HAVE TO BE AS 

03:39:55.316 --> 03:39:59.326
FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE WITH YOU
AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE 

03:39:59.606 --> 03:40:03.836
AND AS THESE RECOLLECTIONS HAVE 

03:40:07.866 --> 03:40:11.360
BEEN REFRESHED BY SUBSEQUENT 
TESTIMONY, I THINK I FILLED IN A

03:40:11.550 --> 03:40:13.730
LOT OF BLANKS. 
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF IT IS SPECULATION. A

03:40:13.880 --> 03:40:16.690
LOT OF IT IS YOUR GUESS. AND WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT OF

03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:19.330
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. SO THE EVIDENCE HERE 

03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:25.902
OUGHT TO BE PRETTY DARN GOOD. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AS TO 

03:40:26.062 --> 03:40:32.521
WHEN I WAS PRESUMING AND I WAS 
PRESUMING ON THE AID. I DID HAVE

03:40:33.141 --> 03:40:37.021
SOME TEXT I READ FROM. I RELY ON
THOSE TEXTS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

03:40:37.231 --> 03:40:40.543
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THOSE 
TEXTS WERE FALSELY SENT OR THAT 

03:40:40.943 --> 03:40:44.443
THERE WAS SOME SUBTERFUGE THERE.
THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE, THEY SAY

03:40:44.793 --> 03:40:51.042
WHAT THEY SAY. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THANK YOU SIR. 

03:40:51.043 --> 03:40:56.523
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE WILL NOW MOVE TO A SECOND
STAFF ROUND LED OF 30 MINUTES. 

03:40:56.673 --> 03:40:59.293
MR. VOLKER, I HAVE A FEW 
QUESTIONS BEFORE I TURN IT BACK 

03:41:00.993 --> 03:41:05.313
TO  MR. GOLDMAN. YOU TESTIFIED 
IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE INS 

03:41:05.903 --> 03:41:09.323
THE MINORITY. SOMETHING ALONG 
THE LINES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE DID

03:41:09.463 --> 03:41:14.423
NOT MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN 
BARISMA AND BIDEN. A LOT OF 

03:41:16.623 --> 03:41:18.623
PEOPLE 

03:41:20.652 --> 03:41:22.652
HAVE REAL DIFFICULTY 
UNDERSTANDING THAT. MORRISON 

03:41:22.712 --> 03:41:27.802
SAID IT TOOK HIM DOING A GOOGLE 
SEARCH SAYING THIS IS 

03:41:28.202 --> 03:41:30.101
SIGNIFICANT. IT INVOLVES THE 
BIDENS. ARE YOU SAYING DURING 

03:41:30.102 --> 03:41:34.612
ALL THIS TIME UP UNTIL THE CALL,
YOU NEVER MADE THE CONNECTION 

03:41:35.822 --> 03:41:39.212
BETWEEN BARISMA AND THE BIDENS? 
YOU JUST THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT 

03:41:39.502 --> 03:41:42.692
AND RUDY GIULIANI WERE 
INTERESTED IN THIS ONE UKRAINIAN

03:41:42.852 --> 03:41:44.501
COMPANY? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, MY ROLE,  MR. 

03:41:44.502 --> 03:41:46.702
CHAIRMAN, WAS 

03:41:50.742 --> 03:41:55.672
JUST TO GET THE MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU SAYING

03:41:56.432 --> 03:42:00.204
MONTHS AND MONTHS AND EVERYTHING
RUDY GIULIANI SAID ON TV, THAT 

03:42:00.354 --> 03:42:02.929
YOU NEVER PUT BARISM AGENT TO 
WITH THE BIDENS? 

03:42:02.930 --> 03:42:06.026
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T. AND I WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION TO WHAT  MR. GIULIANI 

03:42:06.438 --> 03:42:08.984
WAS SAYING ON TV. WE WERE 
TALKING TO HIM DIRECTLY. 

03:42:08.985 --> 03:42:16.591
&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU THIS. MR. 
VOLKER TESTIFIED YESTERDAY TO A 

03:42:16.863 --> 03:42:22.149
SIMILAR EPIPHANY FOR LACK OF A 
BETTER WORD. IN HINDSIGHT, I 

03:42:22.559 --> 03:42:27.761
UNDERSTAND THE OTHERS SAW THE 
IDEA OF OTHERS INVESTIGATING 

03:42:28.771 --> 03:42:31.516
CORRUPTION AS EQUIVALENT TO 
INVESTIGATING FORMER VICE 

03:42:31.939 --> 03:42:34.199
PRESIDENT BIDEN. I 

03:42:38.109 --> 03:42:40.109
SAW 

03:42:43.109 --> 03:42:47.449
THEM AS VERY DIFFERENT.
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE 

03:42:48.059 --> 03:42:50.839
CONNECTIONS DIFFERENTLY. AND IF 
I HAD, 

03:42:54.889 --> 03:42:56.889
I 

03:42:59.909 --> 03:43:01.909
WOULD HAVE SAID SO.

03:43:07.148 --> 03:43:13.938
&gt;&gt; I THINK, REFERRING TO A DRUG 
DEAL, A COMMENT, BETWEEN YOU AN 

03:43:14.438 --> 03:43:20.348
MR. MULVANEY. MR. BOLTON SAID HE
DIDN'T WANT TO BE PART OF A DRUG

03:43:20.548 --> 03:43:23.128
DEAL THAT SONDLAND AND MULVANEY 
WERE COOKING UP. NO ONE THINKS 

03:43:24.038 --> 03:43:28.438
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A LITERAL
DRUG DEAL HERE. THE IMPORT I 

03:43:28.948 --> 03:43:30.948
THINK 

03:43:32.368 --> 03:43:37.408
OF THE AMBASSADOR'S COMMENTS IS 
QUITE CLEAR. HE BELIEVED THIS 

03:43:37.548 --> 03:43:40.838
KID QUO PRO AS YOU DESCRIBED IT 
OVER A MEETING, THE 

03:43:41.358 --> 03:43:43.358
INVESTIGATIONS TO GET THE 
MEETING WAS NOT SOMETHING HE 

03:43:45.008 --> 03:43:51.448
WANTED TO BE A PART OF. HE MAKES
REFERENCE IN THE DRUG DEAL 

03:43:51.738 --> 03:43:56.217
COOKED UP BY YOU AND MULVANEY. 
IT'S THE REFERENCE TO MULVANEY I

03:43:56.547 --> 03:43:58.547
WANT 

03:44:01.557 --> 03:44:05.837
TO ASK YOU ABOUT. YOU TESTIFIED 
THAT MULVANEY WAS AWARE OF THIS 

03:44:05.987 --> 03:44:11.057
CONDITION THAT THE UKRAINIANS 
HAD TO MEET, ANNOUNCING THE 

03:44:11.227 --> 03:44:12.176
PUBLIC INVESTIGATION. IS THAT 
RIGHT? 

03:44:12.177 --> 03:44:19.796
&gt;&gt; YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 
AWARE OF IT. 

03:44:19.797 --> 03:44:21.336
&gt;&gt; INCLUDING  MR. MULVANEY? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

03:44:21.337 --> 03:44:23.577
&gt;&gt; AND INCLUDING THE 

03:44:28.357 --> 03:44:29.786
SECRETARY OF STATE. 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

03:44:29.787 --> 03:44:32.547
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN THE ACTING 
CHIEF OF STAFF'S PRESS 

03:44:33.557 --> 03:44:35.767
CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE MILITARY AID 

03:44:35.907 --> 03:44:41.467
WAS WITHHELD IN PART BECAUSE OF 
A DESIRE TO GET THAT 

03:44:44.866 --> 03:44:45.825
2016 INVESTIGATION YOU TALKED 
ABOUT? 

03:44:45.826 --> 03:44:48.585
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK I SAW IT LIVE, 
BUT LATER. 

03:44:48.586 --> 03:44:51.946
&gt;&gt; YOU SAW HIM ACKNOWLEDGE 
PUBLICLY WHAT  MR. MULVANEY 

03:44:53.136 --> 03:44:56.635
UNDERSTAND THAT TWO PLUS TWO 
EQUALS FOUR. IS THAT RIGHT? 

03:44:56.636 --> 03:45:01.376
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE AID 

03:45:05.416 --> 03:45:08.846
WAS CONCLUSIVELY TIED. I WAS 
PRESUMING. HE WAS IN A POSITION 

03:45:09.156 --> 03:45:13.326
TO SAY YES IT WAS AND NO IT 
WASN'T AND HE SAID YES IT WAS. 

03:45:13.476 --> 03:45:17.346
&gt;&gt;  MR. GOLDMAN. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU  MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

03:45:17.756 --> 03:45:20.436
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND. WE 
APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS TO 

03:45:20.636 --> 03:45:24.656
REFRESH THE DOCUMENTS. WE SHARE 
YOUR FRUSTRATION IN NOT HAVING 

03:45:24.846 --> 03:45:29.346
THE DOCUMENTS TO GUIDE THIS 
INVESTIGATION. SO WE DO 

03:45:29.546 --> 03:45:32.546
APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS. ONE OF
THE DOCUMENTS YOU PROVIDED TO US

03:45:32.806 --> 03:45:38.856
GOES BACK TO A CONVERSATION YOU 
AND THE CHAIRMAN WERE HAVING 

03:45:38.996 --> 03:45:42.796
ABOUT  MR. MULVANEY AND YOU HAD 
BEEN TRYING FOR SOME TIME BEFORE

03:45:42.946 --> 03:45:47.105
THE JULY 25 CALL TO SET UP THAT 
CALL. IS THAT RIGHT? 

03:45:47.106 --> 03:45:51.196
&gt;&gt; TO SET UP THE CALL BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 

03:45:51.446 --> 03:45:56.546
ZELENSKY. YES. YES. 
&gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN 

03:45:56.846 --> 03:46:01.156
EMAIL THAT YOU REFERENCE IN YOUR
OPENING STATEMENT. THAT 

03:46:05.866 --> 03:46:07.866
IS A JULY 19th 

03:46:10.946 --> 03:46:14.946
EMAIL. AND WHO IS THIS FROM? 
&gt;&gt; IS IT FOR ME? I DON'T KNOW. 

03:46:15.086 --> 03:46:19.896
&gt;&gt; IT'S FROM YOU I BELIEVE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S FROM ME TO THE GROUP. 

03:46:20.046 --> 03:46:24.506
&gt;&gt; NOW, WHO WAS THE GROUP? 
&gt;&gt; 

03:46:28.556 --> 03:46:30.715
PEOPLE MENTION AN EMAIL. BLAIR, 
MCKENNA, BLAIR, POMPEO. 

03:46:30.716 --> 03:46:33.806
&gt;&gt; AND WHO IS ROBERT BLAIR? 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE IS A DEPUTY 

03:46:34.046 --> 03:46:37.495
CHIEF OF STAFF OR AN ADVISE TORE
THE CHIEF OF STAFF. 

03:46:37.496 --> 03:46:44.746
&gt;&gt; AND YOU ALREADY TOLD US THAT 
LISA KENNA IS THE SECRETARY FOR 

03:46:47.466 --> 03:46:48.435
SECRETARY POMPEO. WHO IS BRIAN 
MCCORMICK? 

03:46:48.436 --> 03:46:52.125
&gt;&gt; HE WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR
SECRETARY PERRY. 

03:46:52.126 --> 03:47:00.660
&gt;&gt; AND WE SEE  MR. MULVANEY AND 
SECRETARY POMPEO. CAN YOU READ 

03:47:01.160 --> 03:47:04.271
WHAT YOU WROTE ON JULY 19 TO 
THIS GROUP, PLEASE? 

03:47:04.272 --> 03:47:10.899
&gt;&gt; HE IS PREPARED TO RECEIVE 
POTUS CALL. WILL ASSURE HIM HE 

03:47:11.413 --> 03:47:13.413
INTENDS TO 

03:47:16.289 --> 03:47:19.319
RUN A FULLY TRANSPARENT 
INVESTIGATION. HE WOULD PUT OUT 

03:47:19.521 --> 03:47:22.685
MEDIA ABOUT A FRIENDLY 
PRODUCTIVE CALL. NO DETAILS. 

03:47:22.832 --> 03:47:24.364
PRIOR TO UKRAINE ELECTION ON 
SUNDAY. 

03:47:24.365 --> 03:47:29.308
&gt;&gt; SUNDAY WAS THE 21st. THE DAY 
OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS 

03:47:29.468 --> 03:47:32.687
IN UKRAINE. IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

03:47:32.688 --> 03:47:37.355
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAY WILL ASSURE HIM 
HE PLANS TO RUN A 

03:47:40.745 --> 03:47:46.328
FULLY TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION 
AND WILL "TURN OVER EVERY 

03:47:46.648 --> 03:47:49.115
STONE." 
&gt;&gt; I'M REFERRING TO THE NC 

03:47:49.898 --> 03:47:53.371
SERVER INVESTIGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; LATER THAT EVENING. SECRETARY

03:47:53.531 --> 03:47:59.081
PERRY RESPONDS JUST TO YOU AND 
BRIAN MCCORMIYK SAYING MICK 

03:47:59.374 --> 03:48:03.680
CONFIRMED THE CALL BEING SET UP 
TOMORROW BY NSC. AND THEN A 

03:48:03.820 --> 03:48:11.027
LITTLE LATER,  MR. MULVANEY 
REPLIES TO ALL SAYING I ASKED 

03:48:11.177 --> 03:48:14.594
NSC TO SET IT UP FOR TOMORROW. 
WERE THESE THE ONLY RESPONSES 

03:48:15.221 --> 03:48:21.226
YOU RECEIVED TO THIS EMAIL? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE THEM, 

03:48:22.330 --> 03:48:26.443
I WOULD SHOW THEM. I DON'T KNOW.
&gt;&gt; NO ONE WROTE BACK TO YOU AND 

03:48:27.259 --> 03:48:30.649
SAID WHAT ABOUT THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS AND TURNING OVER 

03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:35.269
EVERY STONE? 
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A CHAIN WHERE I 

03:48:35.419 --> 03:48:41.579
BELIEVE AMBASSADOR BOLTON PUSHED
BACK AND SAID HE DID NOT WANT A 

03:48:43.639 --> 03:48:47.729
CALL TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY MADE 
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE UNTIL 

03:48:47.979 --> 03:48:51.490
AFTER THE INVESTIGATION. 
&gt;&gt; SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS MOVED TO

03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:52.849
THE 25th. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

03:48:52.850 --> 03:48:54.929
&gt;&gt; BUT AMBASSADOR BOLTON IS NOT 
ON THIS EMAIL IS HE? 

03:48:54.930 --> 03:48:58.970
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK HE IS. NO. 
&gt;&gt; NOW YOU WERE ASKED BY  MR. 

03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:03.590
CASTOR IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER 
KEY WITNESSES TO HELP WITH OUR 

03:49:05.490 --> 03:49:07.692
INVESTIGATION. AND YOU MENTIONED
BRIAN MCCORMICK. THE CHIEF OF 

03:49:08.972 --> 03:49:12.872
STAFF FOR SECRETARY PERRY. YOU 
WERE AWARE THE COMMITTEE 

03:49:13.182 --> 03:49:15.406
SUBPOENAED HIM AND HE REFUSED TO
COME TESTIFY? 

03:49:15.407 --> 03:49:19.087
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT. 
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE  MR. MULVANEY 

03:49:19.287 --> 03:49:20.776
WAS SUBPOENAED AND REFUSED TO 
COME TESTIFY? 

03:49:20.777 --> 03:49:23.146
&gt;&gt; I DID READ THAT IN THE 
NEWSPAPER. 

03:49:23.147 --> 03:49:28.264
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU ALSO AWARE THAT 
ROBERT BLAIR WAS SUBPOENAED AND 

03:49:28.614 --> 03:49:30.993
REFUSED TO TESTIFY? 
&gt;&gt; I'M AWARE OF THAT. 

03:49:30.994 --> 03:49:34.964
&gt;&gt; AND SECRETARY PERRY WAS ASKED
TO COME TESTIFY AND REFUSED? 

03:49:35.114 --> 03:49:39.414
&gt;&gt; I AM AWARE OF THAT AS WELL. 
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU INCLUDE THEM AND 

03:49:40.154 --> 03:49:43.614
SECRETARY POMPEO AS KEY 
WITNESSES THAT WOULD PROVIDE 

03:49:43.904 --> 03:49:48.922
SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON 
THIS INQUIRY? 

03:49:48.923 --> 03:49:53.123
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY WOULD. 
&gt;&gt; NOW, THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST 

03:49:53.913 --> 03:49:58.563
TIME AS YOU INDICATED THAT  MR. 
MULVANEY HEARD ABOUT THESE 

03:50:00.823 --> 03:50:03.233
INVESTIGATIONS INTO BARISMA AND 
THE 2016 ELECTION. IS THAT 

03:50:03.523 --> 03:50:05.332
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT  MR. 

03:50:05.333 --> 03:50:14.133
MULVANEY HEARD OR DIDN'T HEAR. I
THINK THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT

03:50:14.513 --> 03:50:18.533
OF EXAGGERATION OVER MY CONTACT 
WITH  MR. MULVANEY. IT'S BEEN 

03:50:18.673 --> 03:50:19.722
LIMITED. 
&gt;&gt; HE INDICATED A FAMILIARITY 

03:50:19.723 --> 03:50:22.792
WITH WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
IN THIS JULY 19 EMAIL. 

03:50:22.793 --> 03:50:29.513
&gt;&gt; I THINK  MR. MULVANEY WAS IN 
THE MAY 23rd BRIEFING WITH 

03:50:29.673 --> 03:50:31.622
PRESIDENT TRUMP. I DON'T 
REMEMBER BECAUSE THERE WERE 

03:50:31.623 --> 03:50:33.743
PEOPLE SITTING BEHIND US COMING 
AND GOING WHEN WE WERE SITTING 

03:50:34.013 --> 03:50:35.562
IN FRONT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
DESK. 

03:50:35.563 --> 03:50:41.723
&gt;&gt; NOW, YOU SAID THAT YOU DON'T 
HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF 

03:50:42.143 --> 03:50:45.740
REFERENCING MULVANEY IN THE JULY
10 MEETING IN AMBASSADOR 

03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:52.925
BOLTON'S OFFICE. IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL. 

03:50:52.926 --> 03:51:00.826
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN BOTH FIONA HILL AND 
COLONEL VINDMAN RESPONDED IN 

03:51:02.965 --> 03:51:08.176
A QUESTION ABOUT SCHEDULING A 
WHITE HOUSE VISIT THAT YOU SAID 

03:51:08.326 --> 03:51:12.729
WELL, I SPOKE WITH  MR. MULVANEY
AND IT WILL BE SCHEDULED AFTER 

03:51:12.929 --> 03:51:15.935
THEY ANNOUNCE THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS, DO YOU HAVE ANY 

03:51:16.702 --> 03:51:17.748
REASON TO DISPUTE THAT 
CHARACTERIZATION? 

03:51:17.749 --> 03:51:20.729
&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO 
AGREE OR DISPUTE. I JUST DON'T 

03:51:21.029 --> 03:51:23.029
REMEMBER. 
&gt;&gt; IF THEY REMEMBERED AND SPOKE 

03:51:23.141 --> 03:51:26.253
TO THE NSC LEGAL ADVISER ABOUT 
IT, YOU WOULD TRUST THAT 

03:51:26.563 --> 03:51:31.592
WHATEVER THEY RELAYED TO THE NSC
LEGAL ADVISER WOULD LIKELY BE AN

03:51:31.902 --> 03:51:34.208
ACCURATE REFLECTION? 
&gt;&gt; I TRUST THEY RELAYED IT TO 

03:51:34.400 --> 03:51:44.018
THE LEGAL ADVISER. I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER I SAID IT OR 

03:51:44.571 --> 03:51:49.461
WHICH CONVERSATION. I HAVE HAD 
VERY LIMITED CONVERSATIONS WITH 

03:51:50.418 --> 03:51:52.319
MR. MULVANEY. 
&gt;&gt; THIS EMAIL SAID YOU SPOKE 

03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:55.498
WITH ZELENSKY AND RELAYED WHAT 
HE SAID TO VARIOUS SENIOR 

03:51:56.052 --> 03:51:57.331
OFFICIALS. 
&gt;&gt; WHICH EMAIL? 

03:51:57.332 --> 03:52:01.361
&gt;&gt; THE JULY 19 EMAIL. WHERE YOU 
SAY, THE SUBJECT IS I TALKED TO 

03:52:03.868 --> 03:52:07.914
ZELENSKY JUST NOW. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH. I GOT IT. 

03:52:07.915 --> 03:52:11.899
&gt;&gt; WAS THERE SOME SORT OF 
ASSURANCE THAT PRESIDENT 

03:52:12.083 --> 03:52:14.854
ZELENSKY NEEDED TO PROVIDE ABOUT
WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO PRESIDENT 

03:52:15.014 --> 03:52:17.680
TRUMP IN ORDER JUST 

03:52:21.698 --> 03:52:26.824
TO GET THE PHONE CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT PART WAS VERBAL 

03:52:28.176 --> 03:52:30.682
AND THEN THERE WERE 

03:52:34.077 --> 03:52:36.893
A LOT OF COMMUNICATIONS GOING 
AROUND BACK AND FORTH WITH THE 

03:52:37.053 --> 03:52:39.427
UKRAINIANS AND SOMEONE CAME UP 
WITH THE IDEA OF A DRAFT 

03:52:39.847 --> 03:52:42.853
STATEMENT. SO THERE WOULD BE NO 
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT IN 

03:52:43.146 --> 03:52:49.123
FACT THE UKRAINIANS WOULD SAY 
AND BE WILLING TO SAY THAT WE 

03:52:49.736 --> 03:52:51.736
COULD RELY ON AND NEGOTIATE 
SOMETHING ON A PIECE OF PAPER. 

03:52:51.766 --> 03:52:54.936
&gt;&gt; JUST TO PLACE YOU IN TIME, WE
WILL GET TO THAT DRAFT STATEMENT

03:52:55.346 --> 03:53:00.589
WHICH WAS IN AUGUST. THIS WAS 
JULY 19, BEFORE THE JULY 25 

03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:04.423
CALL. DO YOU REMEMBER WHETHER 
THERE WAS A NEED FROM ANY OF THE

03:53:04.566 --> 03:53:06.566
WHITE 

03:53:08.512 --> 03:53:11.066
HOUSE OFFICIALS OR OTHER 
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS FOR 

03:53:11.356 --> 03:53:13.356
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO PROVIDE 
SOME ASSURANCE OF WHAT HE WOULD 

03:53:13.376 --> 03:53:17.612
SAY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE A 
PHONE CALL? NOT THE MEETING BUT 

03:53:18.539 --> 03:53:22.595
A PHONE CALL WAS SCHEDULED? 
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS INITIALLY, 

03:53:22.852 --> 03:53:26.884
APPARENTLY A CONDITION, BUT THAT
CONDITION WAS OBVIOUSLY DROPPED 

03:53:27.198 --> 03:53:30.046
BECAUSE THE PHONE CALL TOOK 
PLACE AND THERE WAS NO SUCH 

03:53:30.420 --> 03:53:32.689
STATEMENT MADE. THE PHONE CALL 
TOOK PLACE AS YOU SAID ON THE 

03:53:32.832 --> 03:53:34.965
25th OF JULY. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAY THERE WAS NO 

03:53:35.447 --> 03:53:39.240
SUCH STATEMENT THAT TOOK PLACE, 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

03:53:39.241 --> 03:53:41.241
&gt;&gt; THE UKRAINIANS NEVER MADE 
THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENT PRIOR TO 

03:53:41.612 --> 03:53:43.281
THE PHONE CALL IN THE 25th OF 
JULY. 

03:53:43.282 --> 03:53:48.352
&gt;&gt; BUT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT 
A PUBLIC STATEMENT. WHAT I WAS 

03:53:49.155 --> 03:53:52.999
ASKING IS WHETHER PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY NEEDED TO RELAY TO YOU 

03:53:53.581 --> 03:53:57.001
OR THE OTHER AMERICAN OFFICIALS 
THAT HE WOULD ASSURE PRESIDENT 

03:53:57.311 --> 03:54:04.264
TRUMP THAT HE WOULD DO THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS IN A PHONE CALL. 

03:54:04.424 --> 03:54:12.267
&gt;&gt; IN MY EMAIL, I OBVIOUSLY HAD 
JUST SPOKEN WITH HIM. HE BEING 

03:54:12.416 --> 03:54:14.453
ZELENSKY. AND HE SAID THAT HE 
WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THE CALL

03:54:14.597 --> 03:54:21.581
AND HE WOULD MAKE THE ASSURANCES
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THAT CALL.

03:54:21.732 --> 03:54:24.053
AND THEN, PRESUMABLY, THAT WOULD
THEN LEAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

03:54:24.216 --> 03:54:26.853
MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAD BEEN DISCUSSING 

03:54:28.414 --> 03:54:30.414
THIS PHONE CALL FOR 

03:54:34.263 --> 03:54:38.101
SEVERAL WEEKS NOW? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK WITH VOLKER, WITH 

03:54:38.437 --> 03:54:42.151
PERRY, WITH GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; AND RIGHT AFTER YOU SENT THIS

03:54:42.381 --> 03:54:45.872
EMAIL ASSURING THE OTHERS THAT 
HE WILL DISCUSS THE 

03:54:46.581 --> 03:54:52.294
INVESTIGATIONS, AND WILL TURN 
OVER EVERY STONE, THE ELECTION 

03:54:52.450 --> 03:54:54.654
INVESTIGATIONS IN 2016,  MR. 
MULVANEY RESPONDED THAT HE ASKED

03:54:54.803 --> 03:54:57.910
TO SET UP THE CALL FOR THE NEXT 
DAY. IS THAT RIGHT? 

03:54:57.911 --> 03:55:01.228
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. 
&gt;&gt; NOW LET'S GO TO THAT PRESS 

03:55:01.490 --> 03:55:10.225
STATEMENT YOU WERE DISCUSSING IN
AUGUST. AND, YOU TESTIFIED I 

03:55:11.145 --> 03:55:14.791
BELIEVE THAT, YOU UNDERSTAND 
THAT RUDY GIULIANI WAS 

03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:18.376
REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT'S 
INTEREST WITH REGARD TO UKRAINE.

03:55:18.520 --> 03:55:20.168
IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD. 

03:55:20.169 --> 03:55:25.315
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE ALL? 
&gt;&gt; PERRY, VOLKER, MYSELF. 

03:55:25.316 --> 03:55:31.734
&gt;&gt; IN AUGUST, YOU AND AMBASSADOR
VOLKER WERE COORDINATING WITH 

03:55:31.987 --> 03:55:35.517
ANDRE YERMACH, THE ZELENSKY 
AIDE, ABOUT A PRESS STATEMENT. I

03:55:35.656 --> 03:55:40.392
WANT TO PULL UP SOME OF THE TEXT
EXCHANGES YOU ARE REFERRING TO

WHICH AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE HELPS 
YOU REFRESH YOUR RECOLLECTION. 

03:55:44.306 --> 03:55:47.311
IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK TAYLOR WAS INVOLVED 

03:55:47.606 --> 03:55:48.920
IN THOSE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS AS 
WELL. 

03:55:48.921 --> 03:55:52.776
&gt;&gt; HE IS NOT ON ANY OF THESE 
TEXT MESSAGES. PERHAPS HE WAS 

03:55:53.032 --> 03:55:56.485

LET'S GO

03:56:40.075 --> 03:56:44.038
THINK POTUS WANT IT IS 
DELIVERABLE. WHAT DID YOU MEAN? 

03:56:44.193 --> 03:56:47.467

INVESTIGATION.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL. I MAY HAVE 

03:56:51.450 --> 03:56:54.256

03:57:37.891 --> 03:57:40.363

&gt;&gt; CAN YOU READ WHAT YOU WROTE

03:58:17.537 --> 03:58:21.211
&gt;&gt; MIKE, AND I'M REFERRING TO

03:58:22.190 --> 03:58:25.479
INITIATED A STATEMENT FROM 
ZELENSKY. WE DELIVERED FOR OUR 

03:58:25.698 --> 03:58:35.531
REVIEW IN A DAY OR TWO. CONTENTS

03:58:35.927 --> 03:58:40.828
BOSS HAPPY ENOUGH. THEY ARE 
PLANNING A BIG PRESSER ON 

03:58:41.038 --> 03:58:44.940
SPECIFICS NEXT WEEK. 
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT DID THE SPECIFICS 

03:58:45.158 --> 03:58:47.277
REPRESENT? 
&gt;&gt; THE 2016 AND THE BARISMA. 

03:58:47.423 --> 03:58:49.423
&gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU SAY THE BOSS, 
WHO 

03:58:51.885 --> 03:58:53.383
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? 
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

03:58:53.384 --> 03:58:58.320
&gt;&gt; AND THE INVITATION IS WHAT? 
&gt;&gt; TO THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING. 

03:58:58.487 --> 03:59:04.487
&gt;&gt; AND LISA KENNA SAYSLY PASS TO
S. AND S IS SECRETARY POMPEO? 

03:59:04.633 --> 03:59:08.101
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. NOW, TWO DAYS 

03:59:08.474 --> 03:59:10.474
LATER, YOU HAVE 

03:59:12.581 --> 03:59:17.098
A TEXT EXCHANGE WITH AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER AGAIN. AND, THIS IS AT 

03:59:17.726 --> 03:59:23.730
THE END OF IT. BUT, THE EARLIER 
TEXT WHICH WE DON'T HAVE HERE, 

03:59:25.625 --> 03:59:29.958
YOU MAY RECALL INCLUDES THE 
REVISED PRESS STATEMENT 

03:59:30.106 --> 03:59:31.710
INVOLVING BARISMA AND THE 2016 
ELECTION? 

03:59:31.711 --> 03:59:37.621
&gt;&gt; YES. IF I COULD SEE IT, THAT 
WOULD BE HELPFUL. BUT YES. 

03:59:37.622 --> 03:59:40.706
&gt;&gt; SO, YOU ULTIMATELY REMEMBERED
AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION WITH  

03:59:40.851 --> 03:59:46.301
MR. GIULIANI, YOU PASSED ALONG A
STATEMENT TO THE UKRAINIANS THAT

03:59:46.447 --> 03:59:50.550
INCLUDED BARISMA IN THE 2016 
ELECTION. RIGHT? 

03:59:50.551 --> 03:59:53.915
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE STATEMENTS WERE 
BEING PASSED BACK AND FORTH 

03:59:54.103 --> 03:59:57.118
BETWEEN VOLKER AND UKRAINIANS 
AND THE OTHERS TO NEGOTIATE 

03:59:57.262 --> 03:59:58.268
ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE. 
&gt;&gt; AND ULTIMATELY, THAT 

03:59:58.269 --> 04:00:02.013
STATEMENT WAS NOT ISSUED WAS IT?
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

04:00:02.014 --> 04:00:04.014
&gt;&gt; AND THE WHITE 

04:00:07.019 --> 04:00:09.625
HOUSE MEETING STILL HASN'T 
OCCURRED. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND AT 

04:00:09.833 --> 04:00:15.080
THAT TIME THAT IT WAS THE 
PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION AND 

04:00:15.230 --> 04:00:19.718
INSTRUCTION THAT A WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

04:00:19.974 --> 04:00:24.768
WOULD NOT OCCUR UNTIL PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY THE 

04:00:25.887 --> 04:00:27.833
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED. IS THAT RIGHT?

04:00:27.834 --> 04:00:30.598
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW THE 

04:00:30.778 --> 04:00:32.689
INVESTIGATIONS THE PRESIDENT 
WANTED WHEREAS AN INVESTIGATION 

04:00:32.690 --> 04:00:34.891
INTO THE BIDENS AND AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 2016 

04:00:37.214 --> 04:00:39.214
ELECTION. 
&gt;&gt; 

04:00:42.184 --> 04:00:47.945
I KNOW THAT NOW. YES.
&gt;&gt; I WILL MOVE AHEAD TO AUGUST 

04:00:49.374 --> 04:00:55.487
22. AND YOU WROTE AN EMAIL TO 
SECRETARY POMPEO, DIRECTLY TO 

04:00:56.811 --> 04:00:59.578
SECRETARY POMPEO. SEEING LISA 
KENNA. THE SUBJECT OF ZELENSKY. 

04:00:59.745 --> 04:01:05.087
COULD YOU PLEASE READ WHAT YOU 
WROTE TO SECRETARY POMPEO? 

04:01:05.088 --> 04:01:10.184
&gt;&gt; MIKE, SHOULD WE BLOCK TIME IN
WARSAW FOR A PULL ASIDE FOR 

04:01:11.000 --> 04:01:13.393
POTUS TO MEET ZELENSKY? I WOULD 
ASK ZELENSKY TO LOOK HIM IN THE 

04:01:13.553 --> 04:01:19.713
EYE AND TELL HIM THAT ONCE 
UKRAINE'S NEW JUSTICE FOLKS ARE 

04:01:19.917 --> 04:01:22.879
IN PLACE, MID SEPTEMBER, 
ZELENSKY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE 

04:01:23.115 --> 04:01:25.679
FORWARD PUBLICLY AND WITH 
CONFIDENCE ON THESE ISSUES OF 

04:01:25.827 --> 04:01:29.885
IMPORTANCE TO POTUS AND TO THE 
U.S. HOPEFULLY, THAT WILL BREAK 

04:01:30.779 --> 04:01:32.779
THE LOG JAM. 
&gt;&gt; AND SECRETARY POMPEO RESPONDS

04:01:35.535 --> 04:01:40.240
TO YOU, THREE MINUTES LATER, 
YES. I WANT TO UNPACK THIS A 

04:01:40.490 --> 04:01:42.657
LITTLE BIT. YOU 

04:01:45.889 --> 04:01:49.065
SAID THAT IN THE MIDDLE, ONCE 
UKRAINE'S JUSTICE FOLKS WERE IN 

04:01:49.215 --> 04:01:51.799
PLACE, WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY 
THAT? 

04:01:51.800 --> 04:01:54.471
&gt;&gt; THE PROSECUTOR WORKING FOR 
ZELENSKY, THE OLD PROSECUTOR, I 

04:01:54.615 --> 04:02:00.577
BELIEVE HIS TERM WAS UP OR HE 
WAS BEING LET GO. ZELENSKY 

04:02:00.722 --> 04:02:04.249
WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL HIS PERSON 
WAS IN PLACE. 

04:02:04.250 --> 04:02:08.326
&gt;&gt; SO ONCE THAT NEW PROSECUTOR 
WAS IN PLACE, THEN, Z, PRESIDENT

04:02:08.477 --> 04:02:12.625
ZELENSKY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE 
FORWARD PUBLICLY AND WITH 

04:02:13.108 --> 04:02:17.690
CONFIDENCE ON THOSE ISSUES OF 
IMPORTANCE TO POTUS. WHAT DID 

04:02:17.956 --> 04:02:20.912
YOU MEAN BY THOSE ISSUES OF 
IMPORTANCE TO POTUS? 

04:02:20.913 --> 04:02:25.950
&gt;&gt; THE 2016 ELECTION AND THE 
BARISMA INVESTIGATION. 

04:02:25.951 --> 04:02:29.971
&gt;&gt; WERE YOU AWAR THAT SECRETARY 
POMPEO HAD LISTENED IN TO THE 

04:02:30.116 --> 04:02:32.774
JULY 25 PHONE CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT. 

04:02:32.775 --> 04:02:37.331
&gt;&gt; IF HE HAD. DO YOU BELIEVE HE 
FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUES

04:02:37.480 --> 04:02:40.662
OF IMPORTANCE TO POTUS WOULD BE?
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T CHARACTERIZE HIS 

04:02:41.060 --> 04:02:43.931
STATE OF MIND. HE LISTENED IN ON
THE PHONE CALL AND CONCLUDED 

04:02:44.304 --> 04:02:47.212
WHAT HE CONCLUDED. 
&gt;&gt; NOW THAT YOU HAVE READ THE 

04:02:47.352 --> 04:02:50.648
PHONE CALL, IT IS CLEAR WHAT THE
ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE ARE TO 

04:02:50.959 --> 04:02:52.497
POTUS. 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

04:02:52.498 --> 04:02:55.490
&gt;&gt; BIDEN INVESTIGATION IN THE 
2016 ELECTION INVESTIGATION. 

04:02:55.634 --> 04:03:01.184
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; IT SAYS HOPEFULLY, THAT WILL 

04:03:01.988 --> 04:03:04.887
BREAK THE LOG JAM. BY THIS 
POINT, YOU WERE AWARE SECURITY 

04:03:05.098 --> 04:03:07.880
ASSISTANCE HAD BEEN ON HOLD FIVE
WEEKS. IS THAT RIGHT? 

04:03:07.881 --> 04:03:10.423
&gt;&gt; I BECAME AWARE 

04:03:13.793 --> 04:03:16.792
ON THE 18th OF JULY. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS 

04:03:17.811 --> 04:03:21.604
A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND ELSEWHERE TO GET 

04:03:22.208 --> 04:03:23.358
THAT HOLD LIFTED. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

04:03:23.359 --> 04:03:28.264
&gt;&gt; DOES ANYBODY IN TINNER 
AGENCY, THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

04:03:30.862 --> 04:03:34.936
APPARATUS WANTED THE AID TO YO 
TO UKRAINE? 

04:03:34.937 --> 04:03:37.861
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU MEAN 

04:03:41.322 --> 04:03:43.322
BY LOG JAM? 
&gt;&gt; I MEANT ANYTHING HOLDING UP 

04:03:43.596 --> 04:03:47.353
GOING FORWARD ON THE MEETING AND
UKRAINE, THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP. 

04:03:47.502 --> 04:03:53.828
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT WAS HOLDING THAT UP?
&gt;&gt; AT THAT POINT, IT WAS THE 

04:03:56.146 --> 04:03:57.784
STATEMENTS ABOUT BARISMA AND THE
2016 ELECTION. 

04:03:57.785 --> 04:04:01.549
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS BEING HELD UP? 
&gt;&gt; WELL THE AID WAS BEING HELD 

04:04:01.771 --> 04:04:03.771
UP OBVIOUSLY. 
&gt;&gt; FOUR DAYS LATER YOU SAID IN 

04:04:03.787 --> 04:04:08.118
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THAT YOU 
SENT RUDY GIULIANI'S CONTACT 

04:04:08.542 --> 04:04:10.576
INFORMATION TO JOHN BOLTON. IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

04:04:10.577 --> 04:04:12.653
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHY HE ASKED FOR 

04:04:12.875 --> 04:04:13.461
THAT? 
&gt;&gt; NO IDEA. 

04:04:13.462 --> 04:04:16.127
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW HE WAS GOING TO 
UKRAINE THE NEXT DAY? 

04:04:16.128 --> 04:04:20.237
&gt;&gt; I KNEW HE WAS ABOUT TO GO TO 
UKRAINE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN HIS 

04:04:20.385 --> 04:04:22.908
TRIP WAS. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 
KIND OF AN ODD REQUEST GIVEN 

04:04:23.108 --> 04:04:26.314
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE CAN PRETTY 
MUCH GET ANYONE'S PHONE NUMBER 

04:04:26.520 --> 04:04:29.044
THEY WANT. 
&gt;&gt; NOW, IN THIS EMAIL TO 

04:04:29.549 --> 04:04:32.252
SECRETARY POMPEO, YOU REFERENCE 
A TRIP TO WARSAW. ULTIMATELY, 

04:04:32.716 --> 04:04:37.502
THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT ON THAT 
TRIP. 

04:04:37.503 --> 04:04:39.162
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS THE CONVERSATION

04:04:39.163 --> 04:04:41.163
YOU TALKED ABOUT 

04:04:42.658 --> 04:04:47.146
WHERE YOU TESTIFIED EARLIER TO, 
WE NEED TO GET THESE 

04:04:47.557 --> 04:04:53.433
INVESTIGATIONS FROM UKRAINE IN 
ORDER TO RELEASE THE AID IN A 

04:04:53.595 --> 04:04:54.359
PREMEETING? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

04:04:54.360 --> 04:04:56.785
&gt;&gt; AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE JUST
NODDED? 

04:04:56.786 --> 04:05:00.438
&gt;&gt; HE HEARD WHAT I SAID. 
&gt;&gt; AND DIDN'T RESPOND IN ANY 

04:05:00.893 --> 04:05:02.908
WAY? 
&gt;&gt; I DONE RECALL ANY SUBSTANTIVE

04:05:03.270 --> 04:05:05.270
RESPONSE. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU NEVER SPECIFICALLY 

04:05:06.034 --> 04:05:08.757
REFERENCED THE BIDENS OR BARISMA
IN THAT MEETING DID YOU? 

04:05:08.758 --> 04:05:10.758
&gt;&gt; I DON'T 

04:05:13.766 --> 04:05:18.298
REMEMBER EVER MENTIONING THE 
BIDENS. I MAY HAVE MENTIONED 

04:05:19.111 --> 04:05:21.738
BURISMA. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU WERE NOT ALONE WITH 

04:05:21.995 --> 04:05:23.583
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

04:05:23.584 --> 04:05:27.582
&gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW IN THAT MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, THAT 

04:05:27.775 --> 04:05:30.972
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE DID NOT 
MENTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS AT 

04:05:31.338 --> 04:05:33.338
ALL. RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T 

04:05:35.062 --> 04:05:36.654
RECALL HIM MENTIONING THE 
INVESTIGATIONS. 

04:05:36.655 --> 04:05:39.520
&gt;&gt; SO, YOUR TESTIMONY IS JUST 
SIMPLY IN A PREMEETING WITH A 

04:05:39.829 --> 04:05:45.122
GROUP OF AMERICANS BEFORE THE 
BILATERAL MEETING. YOU 

04:05:45.532 --> 04:05:47.532
REFERENCED THE FACT UKRAINE 
NEEDED TO DO THESE 

04:05:47.555 --> 04:05:50.170
INVESTIGATIONS IN ORDER TO LIFT 
THE AID. 

04:05:50.171 --> 04:05:55.948
&gt;&gt; I THINK I REFERENCED. I 
DIDN'T SAY UKRAINE HAD TO DO THE

04:05:56.126 --> 04:05:59.557
INVESTIGATIONS. WE HEARD FROM  
MR. GIULIANI THAT WAS THE CASE. 

04:05:59.695 --> 04:06:05.447
&gt;&gt; SO THAT HELPS INFORM YOUR 
PRESUMPTION. CORRECT? 

04:06:05.448 --> 04:06:07.742
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; SO IT WASN'T REALLY A 

04:06:07.886 --> 04:06:09.208
PRESUMPTION. YOU HEARD FROM  MR.
GIULIANI. 

04:06:09.209 --> 04:06:13.012
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T HEAR FROM  MR. 
GIULIANI ABOUT THE AID, I HEARD 

04:06:13.153 --> 04:06:17.793
FROM BURISMA IN 2016. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT THE 

04:06:18.137 --> 04:06:21.063
AID WAS THERE AS WELL. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE PROBLEM,  MR. 

04:06:21.240 --> 04:06:29.851
GOLDMAN. NO ONE TOLD ME THE AID 
WAS TIED DIRECTLY TO ANYTHING. I

04:06:30.001 --> 04:06:37.583
WAS PRESUMING IT WAS. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO AHEAD. I WANT TO

04:06:37.766 --> 04:06:43.659
GO BACK ON SEPTEMBER 1. I WILL 
JUMP AHEAD TO SEPTEMBER 7. OKAY?

04:06:43.805 --> 04:06:46.135
WHEN WE DISCUSSED THE TEXT 
MESSAGES WHERE YOU SAID THERE 

04:06:46.839 --> 04:06:51.198
WERE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND POTUS. 

04:06:51.342 --> 04:06:54.678
YOU RECALL THAT? 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE THE EMAIL BY ANY 

04:06:55.308 --> 04:07:01.279
CHANCE? 
&gt;&gt; WE CAN TRY TO PULL IT NONE A 

04:07:02.049 --> 04:07:05.436
SECOND. BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER I
SHOWED IT TO YOU? 

04:07:05.437 --> 04:07:07.403
&gt;&gt; YES. GO AHEAD WITH YOUR 
QUESTION. 

04:07:07.404 --> 04:07:09.701
&gt;&gt; AND YOU CONFIRMED THAT LIKELY
MEANT THAT YOU SPOKE WITH 

04:07:09.873 --> 04:07:13.719
PRESIDENT TRUMP. IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, IF MY EMAIL SAID I 

04:07:13.924 --> 04:07:16.839
SPOKE WITH HIM, I DID. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE RELYING ON THE TEXT 

04:07:17.027 --> 04:07:19.027
AND EMAILS YOU WERE 

04:07:22.177 --> 04:07:23.529
ABLE TO REVIEW. RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

04:07:23.530 --> 04:07:27.029
&gt;&gt; IF SOMEONE ELSE HAD ANY 
NOTES, YOU WOULD PRESUME WHAT 

04:07:27.235 --> 04:07:28.990
THEY WERE SAYING WAS ACCURATE 
RIGHT? 

04:07:28.991 --> 04:07:33.174
&gt;&gt; IF THEY HAD TEXTS OR EMAILS I
WOULD. IF THEY HAD NOTES, I 

04:07:33.316 --> 04:07:36.637
DON'T KNOW. SOME PEOPLE'S NOTES 
ARE GREAT, SOME PEOPLE'S AREN'T.

04:07:36.786 --> 04:07:40.309
&gt;&gt; BUT CERTAINLY, IT WOULD BE A 
HELPFUL REFRESHER TO ANYONE'S 

04:07:40.454 --> 04:07:41.292
MEMORY. 
&gt;&gt; INCLUDING MY OWN. 

04:07:41.293 --> 04:07:47.820
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD A CONVERSATION ON 
SEPTEMBER 7 ACCORDING TO BOTH 

04:07:48.318 --> 04:07:51.652
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR AND TIM 
MORRISON 

04:07:54.838 --> 04:07:57.828
WITH TIM MORRISON WHERE  MR. 
TRUMP TOLD YOU HE WAS NOT ASKING

04:07:58.338 --> 04:08:01.440
FOR A QUID PRO QUO. BUT HE 
INSISTED THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY

04:08:01.646 --> 04:08:07.364
GO TO A MICROPHONE AND SAY THAT 
HE IS OPENING INVESTIGATIONS OF 

04:08:07.571 --> 04:08:09.857
BIDEN AND 2016 ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE AND THAT PRESIDENT 

04:08:10.000 --> 04:08:13.036
ZELENSKY SHOULD WANT TO DO THIS 
HIMSELF. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY 

04:08:13.664 --> 04:08:20.701
REASON TO DISPUTE BOTH 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR'S AND  MR. 

04:08:20.846 --> 04:08:25.666
MORRISON'S TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT 
CONVERSATION DO YOU? 

04:08:25.667 --> 04:08:27.970
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; ON SEPTEMBER 8, YOU HAD A 

04:08:28.362 --> 04:08:31.837
CONVERSATION DIRECTLY WITH 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR ABOUT THIS 

04:08:34.402 --> 04:08:36.402
SAME PHONE 

04:08:40.197 --> 04:08:43.911
CALL WHERE AMBASSADOR TAILOR 
CONFIRMED, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

04:08:44.055 --> 04:08:48.724
ADAMANT THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
HIMSELF, MEANING NOT THE 

04:08:48.921 --> 04:08:50.921
PROSECUTOR GENERAL, HAD TO 
"CLEAR THINGS UP 

04:08:53.121 --> 04:08:56.628
AND DO IT IN PUBLIC." YOU DON'T 
HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE HIS 

04:08:57.130 --> 04:08:59.130
TESTIMONY BASED ON HIS NOTES. 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT THAT 

04:08:59.213 --> 04:09:03.252
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP OR IF I GOT
IT FROM GIULIANI. THAT'S THE 

04:09:03.837 --> 04:09:07.745
PART I'M NOT CLEAR ON. 
&gt;&gt; WELL AMBASSADOR TAYLOR IS 

04:09:07.891 --> 04:09:10.027
QUITE CLEAR YOU SAID PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. MORRISON IS ALSO CLEAR 

04:09:11.254 --> 04:09:17.146
YOU SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU 
DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO DISPUTE

04:09:17.289 --> 04:09:21.779
THEIR RECOLLECTIONS DO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; NO, I JUST PERSONALLY CAN'T 

04:09:22.253 --> 04:09:28.961
REMEMBER WHERE I GOT IT FROM. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU TOLD AMBASSADOR 

04:09:29.574 --> 04:09:34.069
TAYLOR IN THAT SAME 
CONVERSATION. YOU TOLD PRESIDENT

04:09:34.209 --> 04:09:37.543
ZELENSKY AND ANDRE YERMACH, 
THOUGH THIS WAS NOT 

04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:47.497
A QUID PRO QUO AS THE PRESIDENT 
CLEARLY TOLD YOU, IT WAS HOWEVER

04:09:47.795 --> 04:09:52.160
REQUIRED FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
TO CLEAR THINGS UP IN PUBLIC OR 

04:09:52.308 --> 04:10:00.622
THERE COULD BE A  STALEMATE. YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO DISPUTE

04:10:03.737 --> 04:10:06.114
THAT DO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

04:10:06.115 --> 04:10:10.080
&gt;&gt; AND YOU UNDERSTOOD THE 
STALEMATE REFERENCED THE AID. 

04:10:10.221 --> 04:10:10.655
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

04:10:10.656 --> 04:10:15.860
&gt;&gt; AND YOU WERE TRYING TO 
EXPLAIN WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

04:10:16.248 --> 04:10:18.260
VIEW OF THIS WAS. YOU SAID 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A 

04:10:18.463 --> 04:10:22.317
BUSINESSMAN. WHEN A BUSINESSMAN 
IS ABOUT TO SIGN A CHECK TO 

04:10:22.465 --> 04:10:25.213
SOMEONE WHO OWES HIM SOMETHING. 
THE BUSINESSMAN ASKS THE PERSON 

04:10:25.567 --> 04:10:32.469
TO PAY UP BEFORE SIGNING THE 
CHECK. YOU RECALL SAYING THAT TO

04:10:32.671 --> 04:10:34.349
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL IT 

04:10:34.350 --> 04:10:36.641
SPECIFICALLY. BUT I MAY HAVE. 
&gt;&gt; AND AMBASSADOR VOLKER ALSO 

04:10:37.496 --> 04:10:40.795
SAID YOU DID. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

04:10:40.796 --> 04:10:42.796
&gt;&gt; JUST TO SUMMARIZE HERE, BY 
THE END OF THE FIRST WEEK OF 

04:10:42.906 --> 04:10:47.304
SEPTEMBER BEFORE THE AID HAD 
BEEN RELEASED, YOU HAD EXPRESSED

04:10:49.206 --> 04:10:52.898
TWICE TO THE UKRAINIANS THAT YOU
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE 

04:10:53.400 --> 04:10:56.006
INVESTIGATIONS NEEDED TO BE 
PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED ON CNN IN 

04:10:56.208 --> 04:10:59.343
ORDER FOR THE AID TO 

04:11:02.692 --> 04:11:07.958
BE RELEASED. DO YOU RECALL THAT?
&gt;&gt; THE UKRAINIANS SAID TO ME OR 

04:11:08.103 --> 04:11:10.954
AMBASSADOR VOLKER THAT THEY HAD 
PLANNED TO DO AN INTERVIEW 

04:11:11.467 --> 04:11:17.070
ANYWAY ON CNN AND THEY WOULD USE
THAT OCCASION FOR THESE ITEMS. 

04:11:17.213 --> 04:11:21.584
&gt;&gt; AND THOUGH YOU HAD CALCULATED
TWO PLUS TWO TO EQUAL FOUR, AND 

04:11:21.972 --> 04:11:24.371
YOU BELIEVE THE AID WAS 
CONDITION ON THE INVESTIGATIONS,

04:11:26.066 --> 04:11:29.072
YOU HAD A PHONE CALL WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT YOU RELAYED

04:11:29.381 --> 04:11:32.331
TO BOTH TIM MORRISON AND 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WHOSE ACCOUNTS

04:11:32.890 --> 04:11:39.413
OF THAT CONVERSATION YOU DO NOT 
DISPUTE. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:11:39.801 --> 04:11:43.013
CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY NEEDED TO PUBLICLY 

04:11:45.004 --> 04:11:47.004
ANNOUNCE THE INVESTIGATIONS OR 
OTHERWISE THE OBVIOUS 

04:11:47.111 --> 04:11:52.719
IMPLICATION OF THE THE STALEMATE
WAS THAT THE AID WOULD NOT BE 

04:11:53.114 --> 04:11:54.313
RELEASED. 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE IMPLICATION. I 

04:11:54.314 --> 04:11:57.227
DIDN'T HEAR FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
THAT THE AID WOULD BE HELD UP 

04:11:57.627 --> 04:12:00.728
UNTIL THE STATEMENT WAS MADE. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU AGREE WITH WHAT 

04:12:00.931 --> 04:12:04.053
MORRISON AND TAYLOR TESTIFIED TO
ABOUT THE CONVERSATION YOU HAD 

04:12:04.763 --> 04:12:06.096
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. IS THAT 
RIGHT? 

04:12:06.097 --> 04:12:07.907
&gt;&gt; REMIND ME AGAIN. I DON'T WANT
TO MISSPEAK. 

04:12:07.908 --> 04:12:11.459
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST SAID YOU HAVE NO 
REASON TO DISPUTE THEIR ACCOUNTS

04:12:12.057 --> 04:12:16.174
BASED ON THEIR DETAILED NOTES. 
&gt;&gt; WERE THEY SAYING THAT I TOLD 

04:12:16.472 --> 04:12:20.776
THEM THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 
THAT THE AID WOULD NOT BE 

04:12:20.921 --> 04:12:26.081
RELEASED UNTIL THE STATEMENTS 
WERE MADE BECAUSE I SAID 

04:12:26.232 --> 04:12:29.337
REPEATEDLY, I DON'T RECALL 
PRESIDENT TRUMP EVER SAYING 

04:12:33.187 --> 04:12:35.655
THAT TO ME. 
&gt;&gt; 

04:12:38.884 --> 04:12:40.039
OKAY. 
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ADAMANT 

04:12:40.040 --> 04:12:42.040
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD TO 
CLEAR THINGS UP 

04:12:46.400 --> 04:12:48.400
AND DO IT IN 

04:12:51.194 --> 04:12:53.780
PUBLIC. HE MADE IT CLEAR TO YOU 
IN THE CALL, THAT PRESIDENT 

04:12:54.185 --> 04:12:56.185
ZELENSKY HAD TO CLEAR THINGS UP 

04:12:59.896 --> 04:13:03.418
AND DO IT IN PUBLIC. 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO 

04:13:03.560 --> 04:13:07.014
DISPUTE. WHAT I'M TRYING TO BE 
CLEAR ABOUT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:13:07.824 --> 04:13:11.168
NEVER TOLD ME DIRECTLY THAT THE 
AID WAS TIED TO THAT STATEMENT. 

04:13:11.310 --> 04:13:17.743
&gt;&gt; IN THAT SAME CONVERSATION YOU
HAD WITH HIM ABOUT THE AID, HE 

04:13:17.951 --> 04:13:20.524
TOLD YOU PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD 
TO CLEAR THINGS UP AND DO IT IN 

04:13:20.786 --> 04:13:23.922
PUBLIC. 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION

04:13:27.951 --> 04:13:31.823
WITH HIM ABOUT THE AID. I HAD A 
CONVERSATION ABOUT QUID PRO QUO.

04:13:31.966 --> 04:13:35.099
&gt;&gt; IT WAS OVER THE AID, CORRECT?
&gt;&gt; NO. PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHEN I 

04:13:37.111 --> 04:13:41.112
ASKED HIM THE OPEN ENDED 
QUESTION, AS I TESTIFIED 

04:13:41.265 --> 04:13:45.110
PREVIOUSLY, I ASKED WHAT DO YOU 
WANT FROM UKRAINE? HIS ANSWER 

04:13:45.616 --> 04:13:48.174
WAS I WANT NOTHING. TELL 
ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 

04:13:48.315 --> 04:13:50.626
THAT'S ALL I GOT. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU ALSO GET FROM 

04:13:50.827 --> 04:13:53.622
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS REFLECTED BY 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, THAT 

04:13:57.627 --> 04:14:01.638
HE SAID HE WAS ADAMANT THAT 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD TO CLEAR 

04:14:01.845 --> 04:14:06.848
IT UP AND DO IT IN PUBLIC? 
&gt;&gt; THAT PART I CAN AGREE WITH. 

04:14:06.989 --> 04:14:10.543
&gt;&gt; TIME IS NOW WITH THE MINORITY
FOR 33 MINUTES. 

04:14:10.544 --> 04:14:12.544
&gt;&gt; 33 

04:14:16.410 --> 04:14:18.410
MINUTES. THANK 

04:14:21.418 --> 04:14:23.418
YOU  MR. CHAIR.

04:14:29.265 --> 04:14:36.793
&gt;&gt; SO IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF SOMETHING, WHO DO YOU 

04:14:36.945 --> 04:14:39.385
GO TO? THE MANAGER. RIGHT? IF 
YOU WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

04:14:39.585 --> 04:14:46.403
FOREIGN AID, GO TO THE PEOPLE IN
CHARGE OF FOREIGN AID IN THIS 

04:14:46.555 --> 04:14:48.621
TOWN. WOULDN'T YOU? YOU ARE NOT 
IN CHARGE OF FOREIGN AID. 

04:14:48.622 --> 04:14:51.053
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAD TO TESTIFY THAT 

04:14:51.207 --> 04:14:53.820
YOU PRESUMED FOREIGN AID WAS 
THIS OR THAT AND YOU ARE 

04:14:54.516 --> 04:14:56.779
GUESSING THAT THIS WAS TIED TO 
FOREIGN AID. BUT THERE ARE 

04:14:56.920 --> 04:15:04.190
PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN WHO ARE IN 
CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN AID. AND 

04:15:04.332 --> 04:15:07.966
IN FACT I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR
TO YOU OR US OR THE AMERICAN 

04:15:10.049 --> 04:15:12.049
PEOPLE, THAT 

04:15:14.089 --> 04:15:16.089
WE 

04:15:18.166 --> 04:15:23.766
HAD THAT PERSON HERE. THAT 
TESTIMONY MIGHT BE PRETTY 

04:15:24.161 --> 04:15:27.639
IMPORTANT TO YOU IF YOU COULD 
HAVE READ THAT. YOUR LAWYERS 

04:15:28.166 --> 04:15:33.189
PROBABLY WENT THROUGH THAT. IT 
COULD HAVE CLARIFIED SOME MORE 

04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:39.701
THINGS FOR YOU ABOUT YOUR 
RECOLLECTION ABOUT THE FOREIGN 

04:15:39.843 --> 04:15:42.609
AID. SO, EARLIER, WE HEARD, WE 
HAD THE CHAIR LOOKING AT THE 

04:15:43.201 --> 04:15:47.572
CAMERAS, TELLING AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. LOOKING AT WATER GATE. 

04:15:47.717 --> 04:15:49.836
THEIR WATER GATE FANTASIES. I 
GUESS THEY FANTASIZE ABOUT THIS 

04:15:49.976 --> 04:15:53.726
AT NIGHT AND COME IN HERE 
TALKING ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF 

04:15:53.872 --> 04:15:55.921
JUSTICE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT 
GIVING YOU DOCUMENTS YOU THINK 

04:15:56.235 --> 04:16:03.923
YOU SHOULD HAVE. NOW, THEY LAID 
OUT THEIR CLEAR WATER GATE 

04:16:04.327 --> 04:16:07.775
ARGUMENT OR ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. I HAVE TO ARE MIND 

04:16:07.922 --> 04:16:10.538
THE GENTLEMAN. I KNOW WE ARE NOT
IN A COURT OF LAW 

04:16:14.138 --> 04:16:17.947
BECAUSE YOU WROTE THE RULES. BUT
I WOULD SAY IT IS NOT 

04:16:18.100 --> 04:16:21.148
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE TO GIVE 
THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR THE 

04:16:21.553 --> 04:16:26.313
RIGHT TO LOOK AT THE TRANSCRIPT 
OF THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE 

04:16:26.946 --> 04:16:31.736
FOREIGN AID IN THIS TOWN. NOW, I
CAN GET INTO WHAT HE SAID. BUT, 

04:16:31.882 --> 04:16:37.966
THE CHAIR COULD RELEASE WHAT HE 
SAID. AND WE ARE NOT IAN ALLOWED

04:16:40.147 --> 04:16:42.147
TO 

04:16:43.277 --> 04:16:45.468
CALL THAT WITNESS 

04:16:49.086 --> 04:16:54.386
HERE. TODAY. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
THINGS DO KNOW ARE FACTS. 

04:16:54.532 --> 04:16:57.234
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE 
FOREIGN AID TO START WITH. IS 

04:16:57.382 --> 04:17:00.361
THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE HEARD THAT. YES. 

04:17:00.362 --> 04:17:04.832
&gt;&gt; AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT 
WATCHING OVER THE EU, YOU HAVE 

04:17:05.021 --> 04:17:08.732
28 COUNTRIES. NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES YOU WORK WITH. ONE OF 

04:17:08.875 --> 04:17:12.837
HIS BIGGEST COMPLAINTS IS THE 
LACK OF PARTICIPATION THAT THOSE

04:17:13.046 --> 04:17:17.593
COUNTRIES PARTICIPATE IN 
PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD. ISN'T

04:17:18.059 --> 04:17:20.948
THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

04:17:20.949 --> 04:17:21.897
&gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY NATO. 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

04:17:21.898 --> 04:17:27.325
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GO DOWN THE LIST OF 
THE THE JOBS, WHEN YOU GET 

04:17:27.563 --> 04:17:29.745
DIRECTIONS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,
WHEN YOU FIRST BECAME 

04:17:29.988 --> 04:17:32.139
AMBASSADOR, PROBABLY ONE OF THE 
NUMBER ONE THINGS. I DON'T WANT 

04:17:32.286 --> 04:17:36.327
TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH. BUT 
ON THE TOP OF THE LIST WAS 

04:17:36.495 --> 04:17:38.909
MAKING SURE COUNTRIES PAY THEIR 

04:17:42.625 --> 04:17:43.569
FAIR SHARE, ESPECIALLY WITH 
NATO. 

04:17:43.570 --> 04:17:45.616
&gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE HER
LANE. 

04:17:45.617 --> 04:17:47.617
&gt;&gt; IT IS ONE OF THE 

04:17:50.435 --> 04:17:52.617
ISSUES YOU BRING UP IN YOUR 
MEETINGS, CORRECT? 

04:17:52.618 --> 04:17:54.658
&gt;&gt; IT IS. 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU WEREN'T ON THE 

04:17:54.806 --> 04:17:59.312
JULY 25 DONE CALL, BUT ONE OF 
THE FIRST THINGS THE PRESIDENT 

04:17:59.463 --> 04:18:05.184
OF THE UNITED STATES BRINGS UP 
IS GERMANY'S LACK OF 

04:18:05.333 --> 04:18:07.333
PARTICIPATION. HE NAMES THE 
PRESIDENT OF GERMANY DIRECTLY. 

04:18:07.370 --> 04:18:10.536
THAT THEY ARE NOT PARTICIPATING 
IN HELPING OUT UKRAINE WHO IS 

04:18:10.816 --> 04:18:12.816
ONE OF THEIR 

04:18:14.832 --> 04:18:18.688
NEIGHBORS. IS THAT WHAT YOU 
READ? 

04:18:18.689 --> 04:18:21.868
&gt;&gt; I HEARD THAT. YES. 
&gt;&gt; SO, THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THE 

04:18:22.573 --> 04:18:24.765
PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE FOREIGN 
AID. HE DOESN'T THINK COUNTRIES 

04:18:25.474 --> 04:18:28.020
PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. THAT'S 
LOOKING OUT FOR THE TAXPAYER. 

04:18:28.162 --> 04:18:31.391
BUT THERE'S MORE. AND WE TALKED 
ABOUT THIS IN YOUR DEPOSITION. 

04:18:31.537 --> 04:18:35.936
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE HAVE 
REQUIREMENTS. THAT CONGRESS 

04:18:37.290 --> 04:18:40.439
WRITES REQUIREMENTS INTO THE LAW
THAT REQUIRE YOU AND ALL THE 

04:18:40.801 --> 04:18:44.603
DEALERSHIP LOW MATS TO CARRY OUT
THE FOREIGN POLICY FOR THE 

04:18:44.815 --> 04:18:47.435
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT CAN CERTIFY

04:18:47.634 --> 04:18:50.947
FOREIGN AID AND SEND FOREIGN 
AID, THERE HAS TO BE 

04:18:52.992 --> 04:18:55.743
CERTIFICATION THAT THERE'S NO 
CORRUPTION. YOU ARE AWARE OF 

04:18:56.153 --> 04:19:00.015
THAT NOW. 
&gt;&gt; I AM NOW, YES. 

04:19:00.016 --> 04:19:04.780
&gt;&gt; SO, BEING THAT YOU LEARNED 
ABOUT THAT IN YOUR DEPOSITION. 

04:19:04.928 --> 04:19:11.493
NOW LOOKING BACK AT CLEARLY THE 
CHALLENGES AND CONCERNS THE 

04:19:11.775 --> 04:19:15.901
PRESIDENT HAD WITH THE 
INVOLVEMENT OF HIGH LEVEL 

04:19:16.084 --> 04:19:18.998
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
INCLUDING THE AMBASSADOR HERE IN

04:19:19.608 --> 04:19:24.399
THE UNITED STATES THAT ATTACKED 
HIM DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL 

04:19:24.547 --> 04:19:30.287
CAMPAIGN. THE CONCERNS OF LEAKS 
THAT WERE LEAKS OR JUST MADE UP 

04:19:30.433 --> 04:19:33.332
STORIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
SPUN INTO STEELE DOSSIER THAT 

04:19:33.729 --> 04:19:37.449
THE DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE 
OWN. THEY PAID FOR IT. OTHER DNC

04:19:37.643 --> 04:19:41.560
OPERATIVES THAT WERE WORKING 
WITH THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR 

04:19:41.855 --> 04:19:45.375
HERE IN WASHINGTON DC TO DIRTY 
UP YOUR BOSS. THE PRESIDENT OF 

04:19:45.584 --> 04:19:49.481
THE UNITED STATES. WE WILL NOT 
HEAR FROM THOSE WITNESSES. JUST 

04:19:49.623 --> 04:19:54.225
LIKE WE ARE NOT GOING TO HEAR 
FROM THE PERSON WE DEPOSED ON 

04:19:54.526 --> 04:19:58.341
SATURDAY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO 
HEAR ABOUT WHAT THE REAL REASON 

04:19:58.634 --> 04:20:03.073
THE PERSON WHO IS IN CHARGE OF 
MAKING SURE THAT FOREIGN AID IS 

04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:06.191
DELIVERED. WE WILL NOT HEAR 
ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 

04:20:06.800 --> 04:20:09.595
WITH THE FOREIGN AID. WOULDN'T 
THAT HAVE MADE IT A LOT EASIER 

04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:16.241
FOR YOU TO TESTIFY THAN INSTEAD 
OF GUESSING? DOING LITTLE FUNNY 

04:20:16.632 --> 04:20:19.922
MATH PROBLEMS UP HERE? TWO PLUS 
TWO EQUALS FOUR? WOULDN'T IT BE 

04:20:21.246 --> 04:20:26.077
EASIER IF YOU JUST KNEW EXACTLY 
WHY THE FOREIGN AID WASN'T 

04:20:26.580 --> 04:20:28.386
GIVEN? 
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO 

04:20:28.387 --> 04:20:32.092
TESTIFY IF I HAD A TOTALITY OF 
THE RECORD. 

04:20:32.093 --> 04:20:34.907
&gt;&gt; AND WOULD YOU TRUST THE 
PERSON IN CHARGE OF CUTTING THE 

04:20:35.202 --> 04:20:38.632
CHECKS FOR FOREIGN AID, THE TOP 
CAREER DIPLOMAT OR THE TOP 

04:20:38.823 --> 04:20:43.683
CAREER OFFICIAL? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE NO REASON NOT 

04:20:43.833 --> 04:20:45.833
TO. 

04:20:48.170 --> 04:20:51.984
&gt;&gt; WELL AMBASSADOR, I DON'T KNOW
IF WE WILL GET TO SPEAK AGAIN. 

04:20:52.134 --> 04:20:54.794
BUT I'M DONE WITH QUESTIONS WITH
YOU. I KNOW THE REST OF THE 

04:20:55.210 --> 04:20:59.869
MEMBERS HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. AND
LET ME TURN TO, I KNOW  MR. 

04:21:00.029 --> 04:21:03.298
CASTOR HAS SOME MORE QUESTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; HELLO AGAIN AMBASSADOR. 

04:21:03.299 --> 04:21:05.055
&gt;&gt; HI. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL TRY NOT TO USE ALL OF 

04:21:05.056 --> 04:21:13.973
THIS TIME AS A COURTESY TO YOU. 
I WANT TO GO THROUGH SOME 

04:21:14.208 --> 04:21:17.147
DISTINCTIONING BETWEEN YOUR 
OPENER AND YOUR DEPOSITION. AND 

04:21:17.601 --> 04:21:20.410
SOME OTHER WITNESSES. IN YOUR 
OPENING STATEMENT TODAY, 

04:21:20.618 --> 04:21:24.209
PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED US TO 
TALK WITH RUDY. CORRECT? 

04:21:24.210 --> 04:21:27.636
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; YOU AND I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF

04:21:30.448 --> 04:21:33.784
A BACK AND FORTH ABOUT TALKING 
TO RUDY. YOU TOOK THAT TO MEAN 

04:21:33.987 --> 04:21:36.697
IF WE WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD 
WITH THESE TYPES OF THINGS, RUDY

04:21:37.411 --> 04:21:41.792
WAS THE PLACE TO GO? 
&gt;&gt; RUDY WAS THE GUY. 

04:21:41.793 --> 04:21:44.939
&gt;&gt; OKAY. BUT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DIDN'T DIRECT YOU TO TALK TO 

04:21:47.536 --> 04:21:49.037
RUDY. CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T AN ORDER. IT WAS IF

04:21:49.038 --> 04:21:54.493
YOU WANT TO WORK ON THIS, THIS 
IS THE GUY YOU GOT TO TALK TO. 

04:21:54.640 --> 04:21:56.813
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR VOLKER IN HIS 
DEPOSITION SAID I DIDN'T TAKE IT

04:21:56.966 --> 04:21:58.966
AS 

04:22:01.129 --> 04:22:03.129
AN INSTRUCTION, 

04:22:07.535 --> 04:22:11.043
BUT JUST AS A COMMENT. 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER HAS NOT 

04:22:11.230 --> 04:22:15.435
TESTIFIED THERE WAS ANY SORT OF 
ORDER OR DIRECTION TO TALK TO 

04:22:15.576 --> 04:22:19.124
RUDY. 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE 

04:22:19.381 --> 04:22:24.163
TESTIFIED. IT BECAME VERY CLEAR 
TO ALL THREE OF US THAT IF WE 

04:22:26.108 --> 04:22:28.108
WANTED TO MOVE THE RELATIONSHIP 
FORWARD, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

04:22:31.454 --> 04:22:34.345
NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN 
ENGAGING. HE WANTED RUDY TO 

04:22:34.554 --> 04:22:38.125
HANDLE IT. SECRETARY PERRY TOOK 
THE LEAD AND MADE THE INITIAL 

04:22:38.271 --> 04:22:44.531
CONTACT WITH RUDY AND THAT'S 
WHEN WE BEGAN WORKING WITH HIM. 

04:22:44.681 --> 04:22:48.321
&gt;&gt; AS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
MR. GIULIANI WAS EXPRESSING THE 

04:22:48.466 --> 04:22:51.141
DESIRE SPECIFICALLY OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

04:22:51.540 --> 04:22:57.459
YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW. YOU 
DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS WAS COMING 

04:22:58.061 --> 04:23:00.961
OF RUDY GIULIANI IRRESPECTIVE OF
THE PRESIDENT. 

04:23:00.962 --> 04:23:02.962
&gt;&gt; LY 

04:23:04.355 --> 04:23:07.276
NOT DISPUTE WHAT I SAID IN MY 
DEPOSITION. 

04:23:07.277 --> 04:23:09.854
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND HIS 
DEPOSITION ON THE SAME QUESTION 

04:23:09.997 --> 04:23:15.877
SAID I DID NOT HAVE THAT 
IMPRESSION. I BELIEVE  MR. 

04:23:16.032 --> 04:23:19.086
GIULIANI WAS DOING HIS OWN 
COMMUNICATIONS. AND HE HAD 

04:23:20.299 --> 04:23:21.389
BUSINESS INTEREST IN UKRAINE. 
CORRECT? 

04:23:21.390 --> 04:23:26.773
&gt;&gt; NOW I UNDERSTAND HE DID. I 
DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT THE TIME. 

04:23:26.924 --> 04:23:31.884
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF NEW NAMES I LEARNED.
&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAD NEVER MET 

04:23:36.775 --> 04:23:38.625
WITH THOSE FOLKS? 
&gt;&gt; NO.

04:23:38.626 --> 04:23:41.608
&gt;&gt; AND THEN, IN YOUR SEPTEMBER 9
COMMUNICATION WITH THE 

04:23:41.798 --> 04:23:45.121
PRESIDENT, DURING YOUR 
DEPOSITION. THAT WAS A STRIKING 

04:23:46.349 --> 04:23:49.415
MOMENT WHEN YOU WALKED US 
THROUGH YOUR FULL PHONE CALL 

04:23:51.441 --> 04:23:52.383
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 
SEPTEMBER 9. 

04:23:52.384 --> 04:23:57.278
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I CAN NOT FIND A 
RECORD OF THAT CALL BECAUSE THEY

04:23:57.491 --> 04:24:01.596
CANNOT LOCATE IT BUT I'M PRETTY 
SURE I HAD THE CALL ON THAT DAY.

04:24:01.742 --> 04:24:05.744
&gt;&gt; WHETHER IT WAS THE NINTH OR 
THE EIGHTH, YOU HAD THIS CALL. 

04:24:05.889 --> 04:24:06.887
IT WAS EXTREMELY MEMORABLE 
RIGHT? 

04:24:06.888 --> 04:24:08.553
&gt;&gt; IT WAS. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HONEST

04:24:08.554 --> 04:24:11.367
AND WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GIVE 
YOU A HARD TIME ON ALL THE TIMES

04:24:11.514 --> 04:24:15.680
YOU DON'T RECALL. WE ARE JUST 
TRYING TO SAY THAT A LOT OF 

04:24:15.886 --> 04:24:18.190
IMPORTANT EVENTS HAVE HAPPENED, 
THAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED YOU 

04:24:18.378 --> 04:24:23.022
ABOUT AND YOU HONESTLY SAID I 
DON'T RECALL. BUT THE CALL WITH 

04:24:23.173 --> 04:24:27.056
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON SEPTEMBER 9 
OR 8, YOU RECALL IT VIVIDLY. 

04:24:27.200 --> 04:24:30.365
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I RECALL IT VIVIDLY BECAUSE 

04:24:30.568 --> 04:24:36.339
IT WAS KEYED BY THE FRANTIC 
EMAILS FROM AMBASSADOR TAYLOR. I

04:24:36.681 --> 04:24:40.311
HAD AGAIN, PRIOR TO THAT CALL, 
HAD ALL KINDS OF THEORIES AS TO 

04:24:40.700 --> 04:24:44.821
WHY THINGS WEREN'T MOVING. WHY 
THERE WAS NO WHITE HOUSE 

04:24:46.513 --> 04:24:49.521
MEETING. WHY THERE WAS NO AID 
AND I WAS GETTING TIRED OF GOING

04:24:49.932 --> 04:24:52.217
AROUND IN CIRCLES FRANKLY. SO I 
MADE THE CALL AND I ASKED AS I 

04:24:52.642 --> 04:24:55.830
SAID THE OPEN ENDED QUESTION. 
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM UKRAINE. 

04:24:55.981 --> 04:25:00.800
THAT'S WHEN I GOT THE ANSWER. 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS UNEQUIVOCAL. 

04:25:00.801 --> 04:25:03.013
&gt;&gt; NOTHING. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT I SAID IN THE TEXT IS 

04:25:04.407 --> 04:25:08.601
WHAT I HEARD. 
&gt;&gt; AND WAS THAT VIGNETTE IN YOUR

04:25:08.895 --> 04:25:11.350
OPENER TODAY? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO. 

04:25:11.351 --> 04:25:13.351
&gt;&gt; 

04:25:14.921 --> 04:25:16.455
HOW COME? IT'S SO MEMORABLE. SO 
STRIKING. 

04:25:16.456 --> 04:25:20.217
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS IN MY 
PREVIOUS TESTIMONY AND I ASSUMED

04:25:20.515 --> 04:25:22.968
IF PEOPLE HAD QUESTIONS THEY 
WOULD BRING IT UP. 

04:25:22.969 --> 04:25:26.528
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF WITNESSES DURING THE
COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION 

04:25:26.677 --> 04:25:30.546
HAVE DEALT WITH AMBIGUITIES IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS AND SOME HAVE 

04:25:30.758 --> 04:25:35.069
RESOLVED THEM IN LIGHT LEAST 
FAVORABLE TO THE PRESIDENT OVER 

04:25:35.363 --> 04:25:42.396
AND OVER AGAIN. THIS IS A FACT 
SHEDDING SOME LIGHT ON THE 

04:25:44.094 --> 04:25:45.617
PRESIDENT'S STATE OF MIND. ABOUT
THE SITUATION. 

04:25:45.618 --> 04:25:49.015
&gt;&gt; AND I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS. 
&gt;&gt; SO I'M WONDERING WHY YOU 

04:25:49.616 --> 04:25:50.952
DIDN'T MENTION IT IN YOUR 
OPENER. 

04:25:50.953 --> 04:25:54.125
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS I 
WANTED TO INCLUDE IN MY OPENER 

04:25:56.541 --> 04:25:59.444
AND MY OPENING WAS ALREADY 45 
MINUTES OR SOMETHING. IT WOULD 

04:25:59.591 --> 04:26:01.947
HAVE BEEN AN HOUR-AND-A-HALF. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF 

04:26:02.106 --> 04:26:06.859
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. WE ARE TRYING TO 

04:26:07.462 --> 04:26:11.627
EVALUATE. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT PURPOSEFUL. TRUST 

04:26:12.287 --> 04:26:13.333
ME. 
&gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT STRIKING 

04:26:13.334 --> 04:26:19.493
CONVERSATIONS. MR. HOLMES WHEN 
HE CAME HERE LAST FRIDAY IN THE 

04:26:19.900 --> 04:26:22.819
BASEMENT, HE, I'LL TELL YOU, HE 
THOUGHT YOUR CONVERSATION THAT 

04:26:23.008 --> 04:26:27.083
YOU HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT WAS 
LIKE THE MOST MEMORABLE THING HE

04:26:27.228 --> 04:26:32.246
HAS EVER EXPERIENCED. 
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS HAS HE

04:26:32.424 --> 04:26:40.040
HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT? 
&gt;&gt; HE PROBABLY HASN'T HAD ANY. 

04:26:40.190 --> 04:26:41.692
BUT HE WAS ENERGIZED. 
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TELLING US 

04:26:41.693 --> 04:26:44.942
THE CONVERSATION. 
&gt;&gt; NOT ONLY DID I BUY HIM LUNCH,

04:26:47.421 --> 04:26:48.912
BUT I ALSO PROVIDED 
ENTERTAINMENT? 

04:26:48.913 --> 04:26:54.569
&gt;&gt; HE CONFERRED WITH US THAT HE 
REGALED ANYONE THAT HE 

04:26:58.607 --> 04:27:04.716
CAME ACROSS WITH THIS STORY. 
BUT, OTHER THAN THE COLORFUL 

04:27:04.862 --> 04:27:06.862
LANGUAGE. HE WAS 

04:27:09.442 --> 04:27:12.733
DEFINITELY MOVED BY THE COLOR. 
BUT HE WAS UNEQUIVOCAL THAT YOU 

04:27:13.041 --> 04:27:15.041
BROUGHT UP THE BIDENS 

04:27:17.752 --> 04:27:20.159
IN THE POST CALL DISCUSSION. AND
HE SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT 

04:27:20.561 --> 04:27:24.045
THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY INTERESTED
IN BIG THINGS. MR. HOLMES SAID 

04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:28.628
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BIG THINGS
GOING ON IN THE UKRAINE. AND 

04:27:28.978 --> 04:27:32.987
THERE ARE. THERE'S A WAR. 
UKRAINE IS UNDER ATTACK BY 

04:27:34.799 --> 04:27:40.397
RUSSIA. AND HE PUTS WORDS IN 
YOUR MOUTH TO THE EFFECT OF NO. 

04:27:40.544 --> 04:27:42.544
THE PRESIDENT ONLY CARES 

04:27:46.620 --> 04:27:53.623
ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THE 
BIDENS. THIS IS THE DAY AFTER 

04:27:54.325 --> 04:27:57.428
THE 7/25 CALL. WHAT WAS REPORTED
BY YOU AND  MR. HOLMES ISN'T 

04:27:58.830 --> 04:28:00.830
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN HAPPENED

04:28:04.072 --> 04:28:07.397
ON THE 7/25 CALL. AGREED? 
&gt;&gt; WITH 20/20 HINDSIGHT, THE 

04:28:07.546 --> 04:28:13.417
BIDENS WERE CLEARLY MENTIONED ON
THE CALL. I WASN'T MAKEING THE 

04:28:13.563 --> 04:28:17.221
CONNECTION WITH THE BIDENS. 
&gt;&gt; WITH REGARD TO THE PRESIDENT,

04:28:17.404 --> 04:28:18.153
IT WAS MENTIONING 
INVESTIGATIONS. 

04:28:18.154 --> 04:28:19.800
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL HE SAID ON THE 
PHONE. 

04:28:19.801 --> 04:28:24.622
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU TOLD US TIME AND 
AGAIN, THAT YOU NEVER REALIZED 

04:28:24.809 --> 04:28:32.227
THE BIDENS WERE PART OF ANY OF 
THIS. BURISMA. YOU TALKED ABOUT 

04:28:32.381 --> 04:28:35.893
A CONTINUUM AND NEVER CAME TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL MAYBE AS 

04:28:36.033 --> 04:28:38.593
LATE AS SEPTEMBER 25. 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DATE. 

04:28:38.738 --> 04:28:42.371
BUT IT WAS PRETTY LATE. 
&gt;&gt; AND AMBASSADOR VOLKER SAID 

04:28:42.568 --> 04:28:46.572
THE BIDENS NEVER CAME UP AFTER 
HIS ONE BREAKFAST MEETING WITH 

04:28:46.969 --> 04:28:49.782
MAYOR GIULIANI WHERE HE 
TESTIFIED HE TRIED TO DISABUSE 

04:28:50.197 --> 04:28:55.295
THE MAYOR OF ANYTHING RELATING 
TO THE BIDENS. AND I THINK 

04:28:55.606 --> 04:29:00.742
SECRETARY PERRY PUBLICLY STATED 
HE NEVER HEARD BIDEN EITHER 

04:29:00.925 --> 04:29:04.068
UNTIL THE END. SO, WHEN YOU 
TESTIFY HERE TODAY THAT YOU HAVE

04:29:05.922 --> 04:29:08.774
NO RECOLLECTION OF MENTIONING 
THE BIDENS TO  MR. HOLMES, 

04:29:08.930 --> 04:29:11.229
THAT'S NOT JUST A RECOLLECTION, 
THAT'S BASED ON YOUR STATE OF 

04:29:11.372 --> 04:29:17.353
MIND AT THAT POINT IN TIME. AND 
YOUR STATE OF MIND UP TO 

04:29:17.529 --> 04:29:19.683
SEPTEMBER 25. 
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T INTO INVESTIGATING 

04:29:19.855 --> 04:29:21.984
THE BIDENS. 
&gt;&gt; SO IT WAS SURPRISING TO YOU 

04:29:22.396 --> 04:29:28.400
THAT HE WOULD MENTION THAT. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY SURPRISING TO ME.

04:29:28.542 --> 04:29:34.505
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO BACK TO A COUPLE
OF THING INS YOUR STATEMENT. 

04:29:34.649 --> 04:29:40.409
THIS JULY 26 MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. EARLIER IN 

04:29:41.125 --> 04:29:44.784
THE DAY FROM THIS LUNCH. THIS 
EVENT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 

04:29:44.939 --> 04:29:47.489
ABOUT. DURING THE COURSE OF THE 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY,

04:29:48.340 --> 04:29:52.127
DID ANY OF THE PARTIES DISCUSS 
WHAT CAME UP ON THE TELEPHONE 

04:29:53.380 --> 04:29:54.696
CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE SO. 

04:29:54.697 --> 04:29:57.557
&gt;&gt; THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
DIDN'T EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS 

04:29:57.745 --> 04:30:00.417
ABOUT CONTENT OF A CALL. RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; ALL I HEARD ABOUT THAT CALL 

04:30:00.562 --> 04:30:04.675
WAS THAT IT WAS A GOOD CALL. IT 
WAS FRIENDLY, EVERYONE WAS 

04:30:04.824 --> 04:30:07.569
HAPPY. YOU KNOW. I WAS DELIGHTED
TO HEAR THAT SO WE COULD NOW 

04:30:07.715 --> 04:30:12.825
MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE WHICH WAS
A MEETING. 

04:30:12.826 --> 04:30:15.247
&gt;&gt; SO, YOU CAN TELL US WITH 
CERTAINTY THAT NOBODY TALKED 

04:30:15.908 --> 04:30:18.616
ABOUT DEMANDS IN THAT MEETING. 
FULFILLING THE PRESIDENT'S 

04:30:19.519 --> 04:30:21.613
DEMANDS? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY. 

04:30:21.761 --> 04:30:24.671
AGAIN, THIS IS THE GREAT EXAMPLE
WHERE I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE

04:30:24.821 --> 04:30:27.631
SEEN THE NOTES FROM THE MEETING.
I DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTES BUT I 

04:30:28.131 --> 04:30:34.865
KNOW THERE WERE NOTES TAKEN. BUT
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY HEATED 

04:30:35.057 --> 04:30:37.554
CONVERSATION IN THE MEETING. I 
REMEMBER IT BEING A REALLY, 

04:30:37.759 --> 04:30:40.171
REALLY FRIENDLY GOOD MEETING AND
THAT'S WHY I SAID WHAT I DID FOR

04:30:40.666 --> 04:30:43.849
THE PRESIDENT THE NEXT DAY. 
WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, ZELENSKY 

04:30:44.174 --> 04:30:46.174
WILL DO WHATEVER 

04:30:49.786 --> 04:30:53.815
YOU WANT. HE IS VERY HAPPY. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANY 

04:30:53.995 --> 04:30:57.572
DISCUSSION BY PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
OF LAMENTING HOW HE HAD TO 

04:30:58.193 --> 04:30:59.337
NAVIGATE THIS DIFFICULT 
SITUATION, RIGHT? 

04:30:59.338 --> 04:31:03.470
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. I KNOW THAT WAS
IN THE WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINT.

04:31:03.624 --> 04:31:04.375
SOMETHING ABOUT NAVIGATING 
SOMETHING. 

04:31:04.376 --> 04:31:06.826
&gt;&gt; IT WAS. 
&gt;&gt; I 

04:31:10.858 --> 04:31:12.858
DIDN'T 

04:31:14.354 --> 04:31:16.354
REMEMBER 

04:31:17.846 --> 04:31:20.274
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
&gt;&gt; WOULD BE ANOTHER HELPFUL 

04:31:20.458 --> 04:31:23.577
THING AMBASSADOR, WOULD BE IF WE
HEARD FROM THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND

04:31:24.571 --> 04:31:26.076
HAD TESTIMONY OF THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER. THEN YOU WOULDN'T

04:31:26.077 --> 04:31:29.367
HAVE TO BE UP HERE SPECULATING 
AND GUESSING AS MUCH BECAUSE YOU

04:31:29.564 --> 04:31:33.374
WOULD HAVE A SOURCE THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED. WE HAVE 

04:31:33.526 --> 04:31:35.685
HIS COMPLAINT. WE COULD HAVE 
MATCHED IT UP WITH YOUR 

04:31:35.889 --> 04:31:39.789
TESTIMONY ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE 
FROM OMB THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT

04:31:40.098 --> 04:31:45.295
VERY EASY FOR YOU TO TESTIFY SO 
YOU WOULDN'T JUST HAVE TO TRY TO

04:31:46.115 --> 04:31:48.344
REMEMBER ALL THIS STUFF AND 
CHASE CONSPIRACY THEORIES AROUND

04:31:48.606 --> 04:31:52.880
THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
CONTINUED TO LAY OUT THE LAST 

04:31:55.010 --> 04:31:59.523
SIX WEEKS MOVING FROM QUID PRO 
QUO TO EXTORTION, BRIBERY, NOW 

04:32:00.034 --> 04:32:03.182
BACK TO QUID PRO QUO. WE 
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DO ALL THAT

04:32:03.331 --> 04:32:08.744
IF THE WHISTLE BLOWER WOULD HAVE

04:32:13.678 --> 04:32:15.678
TESTIFIED. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO 
SPECULATE. BACK TO  MR. CASTER. 

04:32:15.728 --> 04:32:23.763
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU  MR. NUNEZ. I WANT 
TO TURN TO A COUPLE OF TIMES IN 

04:32:23.962 --> 04:32:32.082
YOUR OPENER. YOU SAID EVERYONE 
WAS 

04:32:34.184 --> 04:32:36.184
IN THE LOOP. THESE TELEVISED 
PROCEEDINGS, 

04:32:39.875 --> 04:32:44.428
WE LOSE TRACK OF THINGS. EVERY 
WAS NOT IN THE LOOP WITH YOUR 

04:32:44.572 --> 04:32:47.990
SPECULATION OR GUESS THAT IN THE
ABSENCE OF ANY CREDIBLE 

04:32:48.191 --> 04:32:52.992
SPECULATION IN THE SUSPENSION OF
AID, I CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THE 

04:32:53.296 --> 04:32:57.308
RESUMPTION OF SECURITY AID WOULD
NOT OCCUR WITHOUT PUBLIC 

04:32:57.450 --> 04:33:00.013
STATEMENT FROM THE UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; THE SECRETARY WAS IN THE 

04:33:00.232 --> 04:33:01.610
LOOP. THAT'S WHY I SENT MY 
EMAIL. 

04:33:01.611 --> 04:33:07.032
&gt;&gt; LET'S LOOK AT YOUR EMAILS. 
THERE'S TWO YOU 

04:33:10.047 --> 04:33:12.047
SENT 

04:33:15.060 --> 04:33:17.060
TO THE SECRETARY. RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; 

04:33:21.068 --> 04:33:21.657
UH-HUH. 
&gt;&gt; AUGUST 22. 

04:33:21.658 --> 04:33:23.658
&gt;&gt; AND

04:33:31.374 --> 04:33:36.283
AUGUST 11. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; SO, THE AUGUST 11 EMAIL, YOU

04:33:36.580 --> 04:33:39.281
SAID TO THE SECRETARY, WE 
NEGOTIATED A STATEMENT TO BE 

04:33:39.427 --> 04:33:44.619
DELIVERED FOR OUR REVIEW IN A 
DAY OR TWO. THE CONTENTS WILL 

04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:47.240
HOPEFULLY MAKE THE BOSS HAPPY 
ENOUGH TO AUTHORIZE AN 

04:33:47.486 --> 04:33:50.499
INVITATION. Z PLANS TO HAVE A 
BIG PRESSER ON THE OPENNESS 

04:33:50.793 --> 04:33:53.832
SUBJECT NEXT WEEK. A COUPLE OF 
THINGS HERE. THIS WAS ON 

04:33:54.002 --> 04:33:59.199
RELATEING TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
METING. CORRECT? 

04:33:59.200 --> 04:34:01.200
&gt;&gt; YES. I BELIEVE 

04:34:04.247 --> 04:34:06.247
SO. 
&gt;&gt; AND THIS IS ONLY, JUST 

04:34:06.337 --> 04:34:09.466
INVESTIGATIONS MAKING A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT OF OPENNESS GENERALLY.

04:34:09.613 --> 04:34:10.866
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK BY AUGUST 11,  MR. 

04:34:10.867 --> 04:34:12.867
CASTOR, 

05:44:19.343 --> 05:44:21.991
OF THESE THINGS AND GIVING THEM 
THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE 

05:44:22.194 --> 05:44:24.194
RUNNING OUT AND DOING PRESS 
CONFERENCES. AND THEY ARE SAYING

05:44:24.290 --> 05:44:26.431
AT THE PRESENT UNITED STATES 
SHOULD BE IN PEACH BECAUSE HE 

05:44:26.632 --> 05:44:28.895
TIED AID TO THE INVESTIGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; NEVER SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT

05:44:29.103 --> 05:44:31.657
NOT STATE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. 
&gt;&gt; YOU LEFT PEOPLE WITH A 

05:44:32.088 --> 05:44:34.088
CONFUSING IMPRESSION

05:44:38.184 --> 05:44:40.374
. I YIELD BACK.  

05:44:43.857 --> 05:44:45.857
&gt;&gt;

05:44:51.436 --> 05:44:53.083
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND. I WANT TO 
BETTER UNDERSTAND RUDY 

05:44:53.084 --> 05:44:55.084
GIULIANI'S ROLE IN CARRYING OUT 
THE PRESIDENT'S DEMAND FOR AN 

05:44:55.635 --> 05:44:57.635
INVESTIGATION. 

05:45:00.384 --> 05:45:02.384
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TOLD YOU

05:45:10.133 --> 05:45:14.821
THAT YOU NEEDED TO LISTEN TO 
RUDY GIULIANI. 

05:45:14.822 --> 05:45:20.081
&gt;&gt; YES HER. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND RUDY 

05:45:20.291 --> 05:45:21.527
GIULIANI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 

05:45:21.528 --> 05:45:23.528
&gt;&gt; HE WAS THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERSONAL LAWYER.

05:45:30.647 --> 05:45:32.900
WHAT DID YOU BELIEVE THAT RUDY 
GIULIANI WAS DOING IN UKRAINE 

05:45:33.107 --> 05:45:35.339
FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP?  BUT
I DO NOT KNOW. 

05:45:35.340 --> 05:45:41.209
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR SONDLAND  IN 
AUGUST OF THIS YEAR YOU SPOKE 

05:45:41.415 --> 05:45:43.428
WITH RUDY GIULIANI ABOUT A 
STATEMENT TO BE ISSUED ABOUT 

05:45:43.662 --> 05:45:47.304
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. IT
WAS RUDY GIULIANI THAT INSISTED 

05:45:47.509 --> 05:45:51.926
THAT THE STATEMENT INCLUDES 
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT BURISMA?

05:45:53.125 --> 05:45:56.480
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; HE INSISTED THAT THE 

05:45:57.198 --> 05:46:03.955
STATEMENT INCLUDE THE 2016 
ELECTIONS. AMBASSADOR VOLKER 

05:46:04.357 --> 05:46:06.550
RELAYED THIS TO A TOP UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIAL ? 

05:46:06.551 --> 05:46:12.890
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. THIS STATEMENT WAS 
PART OF THE DELIVERY THAT 

05:46:13.304 --> 05:46:15.304
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WANTED. 
TO YOUR

05:46:20.408 --> 05:46:22.408
KNOWLEDGE WAS PUSHING BURISMA 
AND THAT BIDEN WAS PART OF 

05:46:22.996 --> 05:46:25.817
OFFICIAL STATE POLICY? BUT I 
NEVER TESTIFIED THAT WE ARE 

05:46:26.018 --> 05:46:31.784
PUSHING 12 INVESTIGATE THE 
BIDENS. I SAID BURISMA. 

05:46:31.785 --> 05:46:34.886
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE INVOLVED IN UKRAINIAN
POLICY? BUT I TOLD YOU WHAT MIKE

05:46:35.311 --> 05:46:38.689
ROLE WAS, WHICH WAS LIMITED AND 
FOCUSED. 

05:46:38.690 --> 05:46:41.936
&gt;&gt; WAS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
THAT UKRAINE POLICY SHOULD 

05:46:42.351 --> 05:46:44.583
INVOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
AMERICANS OR DEBUNK CONSPIRACY 

05:46:44.794 --> 05:46:54.750
THEORIES ABOUT THE ELECTION ? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT I TESTIFIED IN ORDER TO 

05:46:54.960 --> 05:46:56.960
GET PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY
A WHITE HOUSE VISIT PRESIDENT 

05:46:57.326 --> 05:47:00.417
DONALD TRUMP WANTED THESE 
ANNOUNCEMENTS TO HAPPEN ABOUT 

05:47:01.167 --> 05:47:05.304
THE INVESTIGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; IS PART OF THE PRESENT 

05:47:05.613 --> 05:47:09.496
POLITICAL AGENDA TO BENEFIT THE 
PRESIDENT PERSONALLY AND 

05:47:09.703 --> 05:47:12.952
POLITICALLY. ARE YOU FOLLOWING 
THE PRESIDENT'S ORDERS?

05:47:18.508 --> 05:47:21.096
&gt;&gt; I WAS FOLLOWING HIS DIRECTION
TO SPEAK WITH RUDY GIULIANI.

05:47:29.875 --> 05:47:31.875
&gt;&gt; MY COLLEAGUES SEEM TO BE 
UNDER

05:47:35.773 --> 05:47:37.621
THE IMPRESSION THAT UNLESS THEY 
SPOKE THE WORDS AMBASSADOR 

05:47:37.622 --> 05:47:41.067
SONDLAND I AM BRIBING  THE 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT THAT THERE 

05:47:41.266 --> 05:47:44.462
IS NO EVIDENCE OF BRIBERY. IF HE
DIDN'T SAY

05:47:48.156 --> 05:47:50.156
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND I'M NOT 
GIVING THE AIDE UNLESS THEY DO 

05:47:50.331 --> 05:47:54.597
THIS  THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE 
OF A QUID PRO QUO.

05:47:57.838 --> 05:47:59.838
OF EVIDENCE

05:48:01.151 --> 05:48:03.184
, THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING IN 

05:48:17.400 --> 05:48:22.280
, THAT A NEW JUSTICE PERSON WAS 
PUT IN PLACE THAT THE 

05:48:28.581 --> 05:48:33.691
YOU SHOWED US DOCUMENTS ABOUT 
THIS. YOU SAID THAT THE LOGJAM 

05:48:33.897 --> 05:48:39.036
YOU ARE REFERRING TO IS THE 
LOGJAM ON SECURITY SYSTEMS. IS 

05:48:39.246 --> 05:48:40.704
THAT CORRECT? BUT THAT IS MY 
PRESUMPTION. 

05:48:40.705 --> 05:48:45.392
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THAT

05:48:50.929 --> 05:48:52.811
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE MILITARY 

05:48:52.812 --> 05:48:54.812
AID WAS WITHHELD

05:48:58.269 --> 05:49:00.269
OVER THE 2016 INVESTIGATION?

05:49:03.349 --> 05:49:07.144
THEY ALSO SEEM TO SAY THAT THEY 
GOT THE MONEY

05:49:10.808 --> 05:49:13.053
. YES THEY GOT CAUGHT.

05:49:19.998 --> 05:49:22.184
THEY MAY KNOW STATEMENT AND THEY
GOT NO MEETING.

05:49:30.359 --> 05:49:33.159
THEY MAY KNOW STATEMENT AND GOT 
NO MEANING. BUT THEY GOT CAUGHT.

05:49:36.657 --> 05:49:40.039
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE AIDE LIFTED 
CONGRESS ANNOUNCED

05:49:44.574 --> 05:49:46.882
THAT THEY WERE INVESTIGATING THE
SKIN. ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS? BUT

05:49:47.104 --> 05:49:49.104
I AM NOW.

05:49:54.333 --> 05:49:56.966
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A 
CLAIM THAT YOU MADE THIS MORNING

05:49:57.177 --> 05:49:59.152
CHAIRMAN. CLAIMING THE 
REPUBLICANS DENIED THE ATTEMPT 

05:49:59.153 --> 05:50:07.141
TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS. IN THIS 
MINI TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE ALL 

05:50:07.893 --> 05:50:12.045
AGREE THAT RUSSIA HAS TRIED TO 
INFLUENCE AMERICAN ELECTIONS AS 

05:50:12.243 --> 05:50:16.833
FAR BACK AS THE SOVIET UNION. I 
WISH YOU WOULD QUIT MAKING THAT 

05:50:17.042 --> 05:50:19.555
COMMENT. YESTERDAY WE 
ESTABLISHED WITH MR. VOLKER. 

05:50:19.767 --> 05:50:24.745
THAT MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY CAN 
INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS. WE DID 

05:50:24.945 --> 05:50:30.618
NOT AGREE WITH YOUR RUSSIAN 
COLLUSION NARRATIVE, THAT

05:50:34.549 --> 05:50:38.007
OCCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
FOREIGN SOURCES. SOMETHING THAT 

05:50:38.211 --> 05:50:41.280
YOU HAVE CONVENIENTLY IGNORED AS
CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE 

05:50:41.480 --> 05:50:43.480
COMMITTEE AS YOU BECAME THE

05:50:47.547 --> 05:50:49.399
CHAIRMAN OF THE IMPEACHMENT 
COMMITTEE. IN THIS PROCESS TODAY

05:50:49.400 --> 05:50:51.400
I'M INTERESTED IN FACT. I'M NOT 
A PROSECUTOR OR DEFENSE 

05:50:51.465 --> 05:50:56.631
ATTORNEY. I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY 
LIKE MR. TURNER.

05:51:03.189 --> 05:51:05.139
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND YOU'VE USE 
THE WORD PRESUME, PRESUMPTION , 

05:51:05.140 --> 05:51:07.608
SOME FORM OF THE VERB REPEATEDLY
TODAY . TODAY YOU SAID THAT THAT

05:51:07.820 --> 05:51:13.006
WAS THE PROBLEM. NO ONE EVER 
TOLD ME THE AIDE WAS TIED TO 

05:51:13.319 --> 05:51:17.766
ANYTHING. I WAS PRESUMING IT 
WAS. A MATHEMATIC FACT.

05:51:23.774 --> 05:51:31.467
2+2=4 BUT TWO PRESUMPTIONS PLUS 
TWO PRESUMPTIONS DOES NOT EQUAL 

05:51:31.696 --> 05:51:33.696
ONE FACT. THE PRESIDENT

05:51:36.698 --> 05:51:39.680
DID TELL YOU AMBASSADOR SONDLAND
NO QUID PRO QUO. THAT IS A FACT.

05:51:41.120 --> 05:51:44.782
ANOTHER FACT. NO QUID PRO QUO 
OCCURRED. 

05:51:44.783 --> 05:51:50.765
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO 
CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD

05:51:50.964 --> 05:51:54.592
THE WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE THAT
THE WHISTLEBLOWER HAS A 

05:51:54.805 --> 05:51:57.684
STATUTORY RIGHT TO AN ENTITY.

05:52:01.275 --> 05:52:05.487
RECEIVING THREE PINOCCHIO'S. THE
INTERPRETATION OF THAT WOULD BE

05:52:09.608 --> 05:52:11.608
THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT 
THE WHISTLEBLOWER. AN EQUALLY 

05:52:11.712 --> 05:52:16.528
VALID AND CREDIBLE 
INTERPRETATION IS THAT THERE IS 

05:52:16.730 --> 05:52:20.093
SOMETHING TO HIDE. THAT THIS IS 
AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THERE 

05:52:20.301 --> 05:52:22.979
IS A STATUTORY RIGHT TO 
ANONYMITY AND IT MAY CHANGE THAT

05:52:24.842 --> 05:52:29.722
PLAINFIELD AND THE ADVANTAGES 
THAT IT GIVES IN. MR. CHAIRMAN 

05:52:29.935 --> 05:52:32.114
ANNOUNCES THAT HE WILL NOT 
TOLERATE ANY WITNESS 

05:52:32.716 --> 05:52:40.690
INTIMIDATION, THREATS OR ISSUES 
OF TRYING TO BULLY A WITNESS. 

05:52:41.091 --> 05:52:43.091
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND HAVE YOU, 
YOUR FAMILY , OR YOU BUSINESSES 

05:52:43.168 --> 05:52:46.339
RECEIVED ANY THREATS , OR 
ATTEMPTS TO HARM YOU IN ANY WAY?

05:52:46.987 --> 05:52:49.172
&gt;&gt; MANY. 
&gt;&gt; COULD YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE?

05:52:49.592 --> 05:52:56.692
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE COUNTLESS EMAILS TO 
MY WIFE. OUR

05:53:00.798 --> 05:53:02.056
PROPERTIES ARE BEING PICKETED 
AND BOYCOTTED. 

05:53:02.057 --> 05:53:04.057
&gt;&gt; LET'S EXPLORE THAT ONE.

05:53:07.900 --> 05:53:10.008
&gt;&gt; OUR OWN CALLING CONGRESSMAN 
FROM OREGON HAS CALLED FOR A 

05:53:10.213 --> 05:53:15.887
BOYCOTT OF YOUR HOTEL CHAINS IN 
OREGON. I AM ASSUMING THAT HE 

05:53:16.182 --> 05:53:19.296
BELIEVES THAT WILL HARM YOU TO 
THE POINT THAT YOU WILL BE 

05:53:19.497 --> 05:53:21.497
BULLIED INTO DOING WHATEVER HE 
WANTS DONE.

05:53:25.777 --> 05:53:30.270
HE INTENDED TO HARM YOU AND YOUR
BUSINESS. IS THAT WHAT YOU 

05:53:30.475 --> 05:53:31.881
SURMISE? BUT THAT IS MY 
UNDERSTANDING. 

05:53:31.882 --> 05:53:37.379
&gt;&gt;'S CALL FOR BOYCOTT GAVE RISE 
TO DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF 

05:53:38.121 --> 05:53:42.971
YOUR HOTEL. 
&gt;&gt; AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY ARE 

05:53:43.180 --> 05:53:50.157
GOING ON AS WE SPEAK. BUT THE 
WORDS ARE BETTER PUT. THAT YOUR 

05:53:50.364 --> 05:53:52.364
ATTEMPT TO HURT A BUSINESSES

05:53:55.639 --> 05:53:57.819
SUPPORTS HUNDREDS OF JOBS IS 
SHAMEFUL AND IS AN OUTRAGE TO 

05:53:58.019 --> 05:54:00.019
ALL OREGON RESIDENTS.

05:54:08.025 --> 05:54:10.025
ANOTHER WOMAN SAID WE ARE 
SADDENED TO HAVE OUR CONGRESSMEN

05:54:10.363 --> 05:54:12.425
CALL FOR A BOYCOTT THAT WOULD 
PUT THE LIVELIHOOD OF THOUSANDS 

05:54:12.633 --> 05:54:14.633
OF CONSTITUENTS IN PERIL. THE 
ATTACK ON OUR EMPLOYEES IS 

05:54:14.741 --> 05:54:16.980
UNWARRANTED. I COULDN'T AGREE 
MORE. THE CONGRESSMAN SHOULD NOT

05:54:17.184 --> 05:54:22.675
BE USING THE VAST INFLUENCE THAT
WE HAVE IN CONGRESS TO BULLY YOU

05:54:22.891 --> 05:54:25.040
AND YOUR BUSINESS INTO HARMING 
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF 

05:54:25.249 --> 05:54:29.899
EMPLOYEES BY TRYING TO TAKE 
BUSINESS AWAY FROM YOU. TO FORCE

05:54:30.110 --> 05:54:32.962
YOU INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT 
THEY WANT YOU TO DO. THAT IS A 

05:54:33.168 --> 05:54:38.158
SHAME. I AM HOPEFUL THAT MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

05:54:38.361 --> 05:54:40.361
THE AISLE WILL JOIN ME

05:54:46.014 --> 05:54:48.014
IN SAYING THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE 
USING HIS CONGRESSIONAL 

05:54:48.075 --> 05:54:49.817
INFLUENCE TO BULLY, THREATEN A 
WITNESS BEFORE THESE 

05:54:49.818 --> 05:54:51.908
PROCEEDINGS. IT IS A WRONG. I 
LOOK FORWARD TO MY COLLEAGUES 

05:54:52.110 --> 05:54:57.742
RESPONSE. I YIELD BACK. BUT I 
WAS SOMEWHAT HUMORED BY YOUR 

05:54:57.947 --> 05:54:59.947
REQUEST.

05:55:08.562 --> 05:55:15.821
I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY ONE 
POINT. THE LAW READS

05:55:21.964 --> 05:55:23.717
. EXPRESSLY RESTRICTS THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE FROM 

05:55:23.718 --> 05:55:25.718
DISCLOSING THE WHISTLEBLOWERS 
IDENTITY.

05:55:30.498 --> 05:55:32.498
WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE 
EMPLOYEE

05:55:35.577 --> 05:55:37.239
UNLESS THEY INSPECTOR GENERAL 
DETERMINES THAT THE DISCLOSURE 

05:55:37.240 --> 05:55:39.240
IS UNAVOIDABLE DURING THE

05:55:45.325 --> 05:55:47.512
COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION OR 
IT'S MADE TO AN OFFICIAL FROM 

05:55:47.721 --> 05:55:49.166
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING 

05:55:49.167 --> 05:55:51.282
WHETHER A PROSECUTION SHOULD BE 
UNDERTAKEN. THAT APPEARS TO BE 

05:55:51.485 --> 05:55:55.084
THE LOAN STATUTORY RESTRICTION 
ON DISCLOSING THE WHISTLEBLOWERS

05:55:55.695 --> 05:55:59.993
IDENTITY. WE FOUND NORTH COURT 
RULING ON WHETHER THEY HAVE A 

05:56:00.197 --> 05:56:02.197
RIGHT TO ANONYMITY

05:56:05.835 --> 05:56:08.434
. THEY SAID IT IS A BEST 
PRACTICE TO AVOID DISCLOSURE

05:56:12.349 --> 05:56:14.349
GIVEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT 
RETALIATION.

05:56:17.417 --> 05:56:20.065
THEY SAID WE HAVE A STEPPED INTO
BIZARRE LAND WHEN SENIOR 

05:56:20.275 --> 05:56:25.922
POLICYMAKERS ARE TRYING TO YANK 
A CIA EMPLOYEE INTO THE PUBLIC 

05:56:26.146 --> 05:56:32.045
SPOTLIGHT FOR MAKING A 
WHISTLEBLOWING COMPLAINT. 

05:56:32.447 --> 05:56:34.620
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE 
CREDIBLE THREATS.

05:56:39.560 --> 05:56:45.187
I DO NOT KNOW WHY OUR COLLEAGUES
&gt;&gt; I HAVE THREE MINUTES. 

05:56:45.188 --> 05:56:52.374
&gt;&gt; THE END OF THE ARTICLE DOES 
GO THROUGH THAT. SO THE PRESENT 

05:56:52.580 --> 05:56:56.870
UNITED STATES HAS A FIVE 
PINOCCHIO'S ON A DAILY BASIS. 

05:56:57.079 --> 05:57:00.729
LET'S NOT GO THERE. 
&gt;&gt; [ APPLAUSE ]

05:57:05.897 --> 05:57:09.777
&gt;&gt; SONDLAND  YOU

05:57:15.712 --> 05:57:17.712
SO THAT I WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED
THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

05:57:17.782 --> 05:57:19.782
PREVENTED ME FROM TESTIFYING 
EARLIER

05:57:25.262 --> 05:57:27.921
ON OCTOBER 8 , 2019. YOUR ISSUE 
OF A SUBPOENA HAS SUPPORTED MY 

05:57:28.126 --> 05:57:30.194
APPEARANCE HERE TODAY AND I AM 
PLEASED TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING

05:57:30.401 --> 05:57:34.020
TESTIMONY. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND STATE DEPARTMENT

05:57:34.227 --> 05:57:36.386
DID NOT WANT YOU TO TESTIFY AT 
THAT DEPOSITION. IS THAT 

05:57:36.593 --> 05:57:40.312
CORRECT? BUT THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; SENSING ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS

05:57:40.516 --> 05:57:42.516
DURING YOUR OPENING STATEMENT 
HAVE INDICATED

05:57:45.984 --> 05:57:48.607
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
ACCESS DOCUMENTS IN THE STATE 

05:57:48.816 --> 05:57:51.684
DEPARTMENT? IS THAT CORRECT 
&gt;&gt; YOU BEEN HAMPERED IN YOUR 

05:57:51.889 --> 05:57:55.273
ABILITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN HAMPERED TO 

05:57:55.532 --> 05:57:58.825
PROVIDE COMPLETELY ACCURATE 
TESTIMONY WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF

05:57:59.540 --> 05:58:02.477
THOSE DOCUMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF YOUR CONVERSATION

05:58:02.683 --> 05:58:05.210
WITH THE PRESENT UNITED STATES. 
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR 

05:58:05.421 --> 05:58:10.782
CONVERSATION WERE ABOUT UKRAINE 
COMPARED TO YOUR OTHER DUTIES ? 

05:58:10.987 --> 05:58:16.870
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ONLY HAD SIX OR SEVEN 

05:58:17.081 --> 05:58:19.081
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT.

05:58:23.152 --> 05:58:25.103
&gt;&gt; ABOUT UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD MANY OTHER 

05:58:25.104 --> 05:58:26.167
CONVERSATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; ABOUT COMPLETELY UNRELATED 

05:58:26.168 --> 05:58:29.651
MATTERS. 
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH 

05:58:29.861 --> 05:58:32.376
THE PRESENT UNITED STATES HAVE 
YOU HAD? BUT AGAIN I DO NOT WANT

05:58:32.580 --> 05:58:35.088
TO GIVE YOU A NUMBER. 
&gt;&gt; IS A LESS THAN 20 ? 

05:58:35.089 --> 05:58:37.089
&gt;&gt; IT'S PROBABLY NOT RANGE.

05:58:42.849 --> 05:58:45.766
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SAY THE DELAY IN 
THE MILITARY AID AND A LACK OF A

05:58:45.971 --> 05:58:48.261
MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WORKS
TO THE BENEFIT OF RUSSIA? BUT 

05:58:48.466 --> 05:58:53.763
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION 
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SAY THE DELAY IN 

05:58:54.364 --> 05:58:58.154
MILITARY AID TO THE UKRAINE AND 
A RELUCTANCE TO HAVE A WHITE 

05:58:58.853 --> 05:59:02.558
HOUSE MEETING HAS A BENEFIT TO 
RUSSIA? 

05:59:02.559 --> 05:59:06.456
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT COULD BE LOOKED AT
THAT WAY. BUT I'M GOING TO SPEAK

05:59:06.660 --> 05:59:11.117
VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT CODE. WHEN 
MICHAEL COHEN WAS BEFORE THE 

05:59:11.851 --> 05:59:14.529
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE YOU SUGGEST 
THAT THE PRESIDENT

05:59:19.631 --> 05:59:21.115
COMMUNICATES HIS WISHES 
INDIRECTLY. YOU SAY THAT 

05:59:21.116 --> 05:59:23.175
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT 
DIRECTLY TELL ME TO LIE TO 

05:59:23.385 --> 05:59:25.385
CONGRESS. THAT IS NOT HOW HE 
OPERATES.

05:59:34.650 --> 05:59:36.650
HE DOESN'T GIVE YOU QUESTIONS OR

05:59:43.996 --> 05:59:46.139
ORDERS. HE SPEAKS AND CODE. I 
UNDERSTAND THE CODE BECAUSE I'VE

05:59:46.341 --> 05:59:48.607
BEEN AROUND HIM FOR A DECADE. DO
YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS 

05:59:48.811 --> 05:59:50.858
SPEAKING IN CODE WHEN HE TALKED 
ABOUT WANTING INVESTIGATIONS?

05:59:56.593 --> 05:59:58.593
&gt;&gt; I CANNOT CHARACTERIZE HOW THE
PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING. EVERY 

05:59:58.684 --> 06:00:00.684
CONVERSATION THAT I HAVE HAD 
WITH THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

06:00:00.734 --> 06:00:03.291
DIRECT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK. 

06:00:03.292 --> 06:00:06.341
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
REQUEST. 

06:00:06.342 --> 06:00:09.195
&gt;&gt; YOU MAY STATE YOUR REQUEST. 
&gt;&gt; IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR 

06:00:09.791 --> 06:00:11.791
SONDLAND'S  COMMENTS

06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:20.868
MISREPRESENTED

06:00:22.585 --> 06:00:26.248
BOTH SECRETARY PERRY'S 
INTERACTION WITH RUDY GIULIANI 

06:00:26.650 --> 06:00:28.600
AND THE DIRECTION THAT HE 
RECEIVED FROM PRESIDENT DONALD 

06:00:28.601 --> 06:00:31.930
TRUMP. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED 
SECRETARY PERRY'S SPOKE TO RUDY 

06:00:32.138 --> 06:00:36.397
GIULIANI ONLY ONCE AT THE 
PRESENCE REQUEST. AT NO POINT 

06:00:36.811 --> 06:00:42.843
BEFORE, DURING , OR AFTER DID 
THE WORDS BIDEN OR BURISMA COME 

06:00:43.047 --> 06:00:50.621
UP. I ASKED IF THAT BE ENTERED 
INTO THE RECORD. 

06:00:50.622 --> 06:00:53.127
&gt;&gt; I WOULD NOTE THAT THEY HAVE 
ALSO REFUSED TO COME AND TESTIFY

06:00:53.334 --> 06:00:56.465
UNDER OATH. BUT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE EXPECT A LOT OF THINGS.

06:01:00.169 --> 06:01:02.462
I THINK SOMETIMES EVENTUALLY 
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME 

06:01:02.675 --> 06:01:04.675
COMPROMISE. I THINK SOMETHING 
THEY EXPECT ABOVE EVERYTHING 

06:01:04.770 --> 06:01:12.987
ELSE, FUNDAMENTALLY THEY EXPECT 
A SENSE OF FAIRNESS. I WANT TO 

06:01:13.216 --> 06:01:15.216
READ PART OF A

06:01:20.270 --> 06:01:22.270
TEXT OF SOMEONE I HAVE 
TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR. A FEW 

06:01:22.330 --> 06:01:24.482
HOURS AGO SHE SAID CRAFTING A 
STORY TO HURT ANOTHER HUMAN 

06:01:24.683 --> 06:01:27.042
BEING CAN NEVER BE RIGHT. THE 
MEANS OF DESTROYING AND HURTING 

06:01:27.244 --> 06:01:29.116
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT 
JUSTIFY THE END. POLITICS DOES 

06:01:29.117 --> 06:01:31.117
NOT GIVE ANYONE A

06:01:33.683 --> 06:01:37.558
BRIEF PASS TO DESTROY OTHER 
PEOPLE. YOU CAN SAY A LOT ABOUT 

06:01:37.762 --> 06:01:39.935
THE TREATMENT OF PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP OVER THE LAST

06:01:52.976 --> 06:01:55.457
TWO YEARS. YOU CANNOT ARGUE THAT
IT HAS NOT BEEN FAIR. THERE WERE

06:01:55.669 --> 06:01:57.344
PEOPLE CALLING FOR HIS 
IMPEACHMENT BEFORE HE WAS 

06:01:57.345 --> 06:01:59.424
INAUGURATED. FOR 2.5 YEARS WE 
WERE TOLD EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT 

06:01:59.631 --> 06:02:02.020
HE HAS BETRAYED OUR COUNTRY. HE 
IS A RUSSIAN ASSET. HE IS 

06:02:02.230 --> 06:02:04.230
COMMITTED TREASON. ACCUSATIONS 
THAT ARE NOT TRUE. WE NEVER HAD 

06:02:04.433 --> 06:02:06.997
ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT. HE
WAS ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTION, AND 

06:02:07.211 --> 06:02:10.859
NOW HERE WE ARE IMPEACHING THE 
PRESIDENT OVER QUIT PRO QUOTE 

06:02:11.065 --> 06:02:14.845
UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THAT THAT DID
NOT HOLD, AND THEN THE BRIBERY

06:02:20.192 --> 06:02:22.668
.  UNTIL EVERY WITNESS BEFORE 
SAID THEY HAD NO EVIDENCE OF A 

06:02:22.875 --> 06:02:24.824
BRIBERY. AND NOW IT IS 
EXTORTION. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

06:02:24.825 --> 06:02:27.258
EXPECT SOME SENSE OF FAIRNESS. 
SO WHEN

06:02:31.770 --> 06:02:33.770
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI 
ANNOUNCES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

06:02:33.780 --> 06:02:36.453
BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN 
HIS OATH OF OFFICE AND NATIONAL 

06:02:36.658 --> 06:02:40.111
SECURITY. WITHOUT SEEING ANY 
EVIDENCE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

06:02:40.317 --> 06:02:42.317
SAY WHAT IS FAIR ABOUT THAT?

06:02:45.593 --> 06:02:47.593
THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS 
EXTORTION

06:02:56.974 --> 06:02:58.974
. THAT'S THE LATEST VERSION OF 
THE CHARGES AGAINST THE 

06:02:59.123 --> 06:03:01.191
PRESIDENT. I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY.
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY SCARY AND 

06:03:01.426 --> 06:03:03.698
SERIOUS. I HAD TO LOOK UP WHAT 
IT MEANS. IT MEANS OBTAINING 

06:03:03.901 --> 06:03:06.138
MONEY OR PROPERTY BY THREAT TO A
VICTIM'S PROPERTY OR LOVED ONES.

06:03:06.345 --> 06:03:09.018
I'M GOING TO READ TO YOU A 
COUPLE OF QUOTES. I'M GOING TO 

06:03:09.233 --> 06:03:13.239
REACH YOU A COUPLE OF QUOTES 
FROM UKRAINE. PRESIDENT DONALD 

06:03:13.480 --> 06:03:15.813
TRUMP IS CONVINCED THAT THE NEW 
UKRAINE GOVERNMENT WILL QUICKLY 

06:03:16.016 --> 06:03:19.317
IMPROVE THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT.

06:03:30.086 --> 06:03:33.678
&gt;&gt; AS I TESTIFIED I AM NOT A 
LAWYER AND I DO NOT WANT TO 

06:03:33.897 --> 06:03:38.215
CHARACTERIZE ANY LEGAL TERMS. 
BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD READ THAT 

06:03:38.977 --> 06:03:45.550
AND SAY I'M NOT UNDER SEVERE 
PRESSURE. HE TOLD REPORTERS THAT

06:03:45.757 --> 06:03:52.863
HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY THE U.S.
PRESIDENT. ANOTHER TIME HE SAID 

06:03:53.065 --> 06:03:55.065
THERE WAS NO BLACKMAIL.

06:03:57.732 --> 06:04:00.725
DO YOU THINK HE FELT LIKE HE WAS
BEING EXTORTED BASED ON THESE 

06:04:00.933 --> 06:04:02.933
COMMENTS? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS FOR THE 

06:04:02.982 --> 06:04:04.982
COMMITTEE IN CONGRESS

06:04:08.080 --> 06:04:09.733
TO DECIDE. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY FOR THE AMERICAN 

06:04:09.734 --> 06:04:10.560
PEOPLE. 
&gt;&gt; I AGREE. 

06:04:10.561 --> 06:04:12.725
&gt;&gt; AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE 
NOT STUPID. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

06:04:12.938 --> 06:04:14.938
CAN HEAR THAT AND SAY

06:04:23.314 --> 06:04:25.868
I DO NOT THINK HE WAS UNDER 
DURESS. I DON'T THINK HE WAS 

06:04:26.085 --> 06:04:28.395
BEING EXTORTED. I DO NOT THINK 
THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF A 

06:04:28.604 --> 06:04:30.973
BRIBE. I WOULD CONCLUDE WITH HIS
LAST OBSERVATION. IT IS COMMON 

06:04:31.196 --> 06:04:34.854
FOR NATIONAL POLICY TO WITHHOLD 
AID FOR A REASON. IT IS FREQUENT

06:04:37.742 --> 06:04:39.399
. WE WILL WITHHOLD AID FOR 
VARIOUS REASONS. 

06:04:39.400 --> 06:04:41.558
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS THE POLICY.

06:04:47.698 --> 06:04:49.698
PRESIDENT BUSH DID. HE SUSPENDED
MILITARY AID TO 35 COUNTRIES 

06:04:49.875 --> 06:04:51.749
OVER THERE LACK OF SUPPORT FOR 
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL 

06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:55.021
COURT. I BET THAT HELPED HIS 
POLITICAL STANDING BACK HOME. 

06:04:55.273 --> 06:04:57.273
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY 
SUGGESTING THAT WE IMPEACH HIM 

06:04:57.655 --> 06:05:02.326
OVER IT. TRUMPS HE DID IT LAST 
YEAR WITH AFGHANISTAN AND 

06:05:02.529 --> 06:05:05.565
PAKISTAN. NO ONE SUGGESTED THAT 
WE IMPEACH THEM. THIS IS A 

06:05:05.980 --> 06:05:11.284
COMMON OCCURRENCE IN 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. IT IS 

06:05:12.037 --> 06:05:14.037
HARDLY IMPEACHABLE.

06:05:19.195 --> 06:05:22.041
&gt;&gt; TIME FOR THE GENTLEMAN IS 
EXPIRED. 

06:05:22.042 --> 06:05:27.131
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE 
TODAY. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE 

06:05:27.335 --> 06:05:33.009
CAN AGREE AND DISAGREE ON. I CAN
AGREE THAT WE SHOULD TURN OVER 

06:05:33.227 --> 06:05:39.859
ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS. I THINK 
YOU AGREE THAT IT HAS HELPED YOU

06:05:40.183 --> 06:05:42.183
UNDERSTAND

06:05:44.389 --> 06:05:46.971
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT 
TURNED OVER A SINGLE DOCUMENT.

06:05:52.505 --> 06:05:56.822
ON THAT WE CAN AGREE. OTHERS WE 
CAN DISAGREE AS IT RELATES TO 

06:05:57.531 --> 06:05:59.531
THE WHISTLEBLOWER.

06:06:01.237 --> 06:06:06.759
IT DISTRESSES ME. I BEGAN TO 
WONDER ABOUT THE MOTIVATION. IN 

06:06:06.971 --> 06:06:11.401
THE FINAL ANALYSIS. THE WAY I 
LOOK AT THIS. IF WE ARE 

06:06:12.351 --> 06:06:19.520
INVESTIGATING ARSON. YOU WOULD 
INDICT THE PERSON WHO PULLED THE

06:06:20.265 --> 06:06:22.265
FIRE ALARM.

06:06:24.195 --> 06:06:29.301
THAT PERSON'S A JOB IS DONE. WE 
HAVE SEEN THE SMOKE AND FIRE. 

06:06:29.506 --> 06:06:31.928
WHATEVER THE WHISTLEBLOWER DID 
DOES NOT CHANGE THE PRESIDENT'S 

06:06:32.329 --> 06:06:34.397
ACTIONS. OR THE PRESENCE OWN 
WORDS

06:06:38.828 --> 06:06:41.655
IN OUR BODY OF EVIDENCE. IT 
DOESN'T CHANGE MR. MULVANEY'S 

06:06:41.858 --> 06:06:43.858
WORDS

06:06:45.370 --> 06:06:51.282
. ALL IT DOES IS PUT THIS PERSON
AT RISK. BACK TO THE DOCUMENTS 

06:06:51.487 --> 06:06:58.786
AND WHAT YOU KNOW. YOU SEEM TO 
HAVE YOUR MEMORY JOG BY 

06:06:58.994 --> 06:07:01.782
DOCUMENTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT MAY 
23 AND SEE IF THIS HELPS YOU.

06:07:05.273 --> 06:07:14.619
SENATOR JOHNSON REFERENCING THAT
MAY 23 MEETING SAYS I HAVE NO 

06:07:15.021 --> 06:07:17.200
RECOLLECTION OF THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING THAT DURING THAT MEETING.

06:07:18.269 --> 06:07:20.269
I DO NOT WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT.

06:07:25.380 --> 06:07:30.705
HE ALSO SAID I REMEMBER SONDLAND
STAYING BEHIND TO TALK TO THE 

06:07:30.911 --> 06:07:33.935
PRESIDENT AS THE REST OF THE  
DELEGATION LEFT THE OVAL OFFICE.

06:07:34.160 --> 06:07:41.826
DEER RIVER THIS CONVERSATION AND
WHAT YOU DISCUSSED? BACK AGAIN 

06:07:42.242 --> 06:07:44.824
RECAPPING. IT WAS A FREE-FOR-ALL
CONVERSATION AND I WANTED TO TIE

06:07:45.028 --> 06:07:48.100
DOWN EXACTLY WHAT WE AGREED TO 
DO AND WHAT WE DID NOT. 

06:07:48.101 --> 06:07:50.101
&gt;&gt; SUBSEQUENTLY HE

06:07:55.843 --> 06:07:57.843
REINFORCED TALKING TO RUDY 
GIULIANI. HE DIDN'T GO INTO MORE

06:07:58.031 --> 06:08:00.986
DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT? HE
JUST SAID TALK TO RUDY? IT WAS A

06:08:01.206 --> 06:08:08.340
VERY SHORT CONVERSATION. TO 
RECONFIRM THAT WE WOULD BE 

06:08:08.544 --> 06:08:10.544
WORKING ON THE UKRAINE FILE.

06:08:14.939 --> 06:08:19.657
&gt;&gt; BACK TO RUDY GIULIANI IN THIS
CONTRADICTORY PASSAGE. YOU NOW 

06:08:19.865 --> 06:08:24.028
RECALL THE PREREQUISITE 
MENTIONED IN THE JULY 10 

06:08:24.238 --> 06:08:26.238
MEETING.

06:08:28.754 --> 06:08:30.754
WHEN YOU ARE HAVING THIS 
DISCUSSION THE FIRST MEETING IN 

06:08:30.935 --> 06:08:33.585
JOHN BOLTON'S OFFICE. YOU 
REFERENCE THE CONDITION ? 

06:08:33.586 --> 06:08:38.411
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SOMEONE ELSE 
TESTIFIED THAT I RAISED THAT. I 

06:08:38.614 --> 06:08:45.224
DID NOT DISPUTE THAT. IT'S MY 
UNDERSTANDING IN ORDER TO GET 

06:08:45.428 --> 06:08:47.808
THIS VISIT DONE THAT THERE NEEDS
TO BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

06:08:51.859 --> 06:08:56.495
. 
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR OPENING YOU SAID AT 

06:08:56.697 --> 06:08:59.980
THE VERY SAME TIME THAT 
APPARENTLY THERE WAS A MEETING 

06:09:00.181 --> 06:09:09.578
WITH RUDY GIULIANI. AND IT WAS 
UNDERSCORED. 

06:09:10.528 --> 06:09:17.250
THE THE POTUS MEETING WILL NOT 
HAPPEN. IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO 

06:09:17.452 --> 06:09:19.487
HAPPEN. YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
THE DIFFERENCE.

06:09:22.991 --> 06:09:25.576
BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THE 
MEETING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

06:09:25.825 --> 06:09:29.094
WAS APPARENTLY A MEETING THAT 
RUDY GIULIANI WAS HAVING AT THE 

06:09:29.300 --> 06:09:36.543
SAME TIME IN UKRAINE UNBEKNOWNST
TO US. 

06:09:36.544 --> 06:09:38.544
&gt;&gt;

06:09:40.455 --> 06:09:42.755
THEY SAID IT'S NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN. THERE'S NO NOTICE OF IT 

06:09:43.303 --> 06:09:47.902
BEING CONDITIONAL. THIS WAS AN 
EXCHANGE WITH AMBASSADOR

06:09:53.052 --> 06:09:55.466
VOLKER. HE SAID DO NOT LET OTHER
PEOPLE SPEAK FOR THE U.S. 

06:09:55.675 --> 06:09:57.463
GOVERNMENT. 
&gt;&gt; IF RUDY GIULIANI IS FOLLOWING

06:09:57.464 --> 06:09:59.464
THE DIRECTIONS

06:10:01.786 --> 06:10:03.962
AND SAYING IT IS CONDITIONAL. 
WHO IS GIVE YOU THE INSTRUCTIONS

06:10:04.182 --> 06:10:06.441
TO SAY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? BUT 
THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT IT WAS 

06:10:06.645 --> 06:10:12.951
PROBLEMATIC TO WORK WITH RUDY 
GIULIANI. 

06:10:12.952 --> 06:10:16.828
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS 
WITH THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO SAY 

06:10:17.029 --> 06:10:19.029
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

06:10:21.494 --> 06:10:23.725
. ARE YOU TALKING IN THE JULY 10
MEETING? 

06:10:23.726 --> 06:10:30.372
&gt;&gt; AT THAT POINT AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER WAS IN TOUCH WITH RUDY 

06:10:30.577 --> 06:10:34.490
GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD NO DIRECT 

06:10:34.699 --> 06:10:37.327
CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE THIS 
STATEMENT 

06:10:37.328 --> 06:10:41.803
&gt;&gt; ONLY THE TEXT AND EMAILS THAT
I HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED. 

06:10:41.804 --> 06:10:43.804
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. MY TIME IS UP.

06:10:51.754 --> 06:10:56.836
&gt;&gt; I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR RECOGNITION AND YOUR 

06:10:57.237 --> 06:11:00.726
HARD-WORKING STAFF. YOU 
TESTIFIED THAT YOU NEVER 

06:11:00.928 --> 06:11:05.988
RECEIVED ANY DIRECT CONFIRMATION
OR SPECIFIC INFORMATION AS TO 

06:11:06.191 --> 06:11:12.173
WHY THERE WAS A HOLD ON AID? BUT
THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:11:12.174 --> 06:11:14.174
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THAT PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP NEVER TOLD ME 

06:11:14.322 --> 06:11:16.322
DIRECTLY THAT THE AIDE WAS 
CONDITIONAL ON THE INVESTIGATION

06:11:18.977 --> 06:11:21.565
. YOU SAID YOU NEVER HEARD THOSE
WORDS FROM THE PRESIDENT

06:11:25.476 --> 06:11:27.855
INSTEAD YOU TESTIFIED IN YOUR 
SEPTEMBER 9 CALL THAT THE 

06:11:28.060 --> 06:11:31.921
PRESIDENT SAID NO QUID PRO QUO. 
I WANT NOTHING. I WANT

06:11:35.836 --> 06:11:37.968
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY TO 
DO THE RIGHT THING. TO DO WHAT 

06:11:38.172 --> 06:11:40.023
HE RAN ON. IS THAT CORRECT? THAT
IS CORRECT. 

06:11:40.024 --> 06:11:45.933
&gt;&gt; THE AIDE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT 
ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW 

06:11:46.241 --> 06:11:50.339
INVESTIGATION? AND PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP DID MEET WITH 

06:11:50.540 --> 06:11:52.540
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY IN

06:11:56.148 --> 06:11:57.690
SEPTEMBER AT THE UNITED NATIONS.
&gt;&gt; HEATED. 

06:11:57.691 --> 06:11:59.691
&gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT
OF INVESTIGATIONS BEFORE THIS 

06:11:59.745 --> 06:12:02.231
MEETING ? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

06:12:02.232 --> 06:12:04.232
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WHAT

06:12:15.643 --> 06:12:17.643
CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF HAS ASKED 
YOU ABOUT. YOU HAVE CORRECTED 

06:12:17.710 --> 06:12:19.413
THAT TO SAY SPECIFICALLY YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF INVESTIGATIONS 

06:12:19.414 --> 06:12:21.507
ARE INTO THE 2016 ELECTIONS AND 
INTO BRISBANE. IS THAT CORRECT? 

06:12:21.713 --> 06:12:23.713
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE DURING THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT THE 

06:12:23.780 --> 06:12:25.780
U.S. PARTNERED WITH

06:12:28.040 --> 06:12:30.212
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND UKRAINE 
ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO 

06:12:30.416 --> 06:12:33.546
BRISBANE ? 
&gt;&gt; I BECAME AWARE OF IT TODAY 

06:12:33.748 --> 06:12:35.748
DURING THE HEARING.

06:12:38.802 --> 06:12:40.802
&gt;&gt; IN FACT. THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION STATE DEPARTMENT 

06:12:40.987 --> 06:12:44.494
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL APPEARANCE OF A 

06:12:45.250 --> 06:12:47.282
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH HUNTER
BIDEN

06:12:51.186 --> 06:12:55.726
ON THE BOARD OF CHARISMA. ARE 
YOU AWARE THAT? BUT I'M NOT 

06:12:55.936 --> 06:12:57.936
AWARE OF THAT.

06:13:00.938 --> 06:13:03.186
&gt;&gt; I HAVE ASKED MOST OF THE 
WITNESSES THIS. EVERY WITNESS 

06:13:03.733 --> 06:13:09.189
HAS SAID YES. I WANT TO ASK YOU 
THIS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HUNTER

06:13:09.398 --> 06:13:11.398
BIDEN HAD A

06:13:14.550 --> 06:13:16.550
POSITION ON BRISBANE HAS THE 
APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF 

06:13:16.652 --> 06:13:18.652
INTEREST? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT WANT TO CHARACTERIZE

06:13:20.035 --> 06:13:22.515
HUNTER BIDEN SERVICE ON THE 
BOARD ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I DO

06:13:22.721 --> 06:13:24.721
NOT KNOW ENOUGH

06:13:34.864 --> 06:13:36.864
&gt;&gt; A POTENTIAL APPEARANCE. 
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T HEAR APPEARANCE. IT 

06:13:36.973 --> 06:13:40.367
IS AN APPEARANCE OF AN 
APPEARANCE. AGAIN THIS IS 

06:13:40.572 --> 06:13:42.572
SOMETHING THAT EVERY WITNESS HAS
ANSWERED

06:13:45.828 --> 06:13:48.108
YES TO THAT IT COULD HAVE A 
POTENTIAL APPEARANCE. BUT YET WE

06:13:48.315 --> 06:13:51.539
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CALL HUNTER 
BIDEN TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN 

06:13:51.743 --> 06:13:53.743
FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK 
YOU FOR YOUR TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY 

06:13:53.809 --> 06:13:55.809
I YELLED BACK.

06:14:00.454 --> 06:14:02.732
&gt;&gt; AND VASSAR SONDLAND YOU WERE 
TOLD BY THE PRESIDENT TO NOT 

06:14:02.936 --> 06:14:05.687
SHOW UP . YOU SHOWED UP. I THINK
THAT SAYS A LOT

06:14:10.815 --> 06:14:13.097
ABOUT YOU. AND I THINK HISTORY 
WILL LOOK KINDLY ON YOU DOING 

06:14:13.334 --> 06:14:15.693
THAT. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO 
THAT. JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS 

06:14:15.905 --> 06:14:17.905
AGO. AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
ASKED ABOUT YOU.

06:14:24.423 --> 06:14:27.412
HE SAID I DO NOT KNOW HIM WELL 
I'M NOT SPOKEN TO HIM MUCH. IS 

06:14:28.034 --> 06:14:30.034
THAT TRUE?

06:14:42.900 --> 06:14:46.586
&gt;&gt; HE HAS SPOKEN TO YOU OFTEN? 
BUT 20 TIMES ? 

06:14:46.587 --> 06:14:53.171
&gt;&gt; OF THAT IS OFTEN. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DONATED $1 MILLION TO HIS

06:14:53.821 --> 06:14:56.459
INAUGURAL COMMITTEE? 
&gt;&gt;

06:14:59.972 --> 06:15:03.782
I BOUGHT A TICKET TO THE 
INAUGURATION. SO THAT'S A LOT OF

06:15:03.988 --> 06:15:09.326
MONEY IS IN IT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. 

06:15:09.327 --> 06:15:11.506
&gt;&gt; AND HE BECAME AMBASSADOR TO 
THE EUROPEAN UNION

06:15:16.418 --> 06:15:18.772
. THE AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE WAS 
REMOVED AND YOU BECAME A CENTRAL

06:15:18.976 --> 06:15:21.901
FIGURE AS IT RELATES. THAT'S A 
PRETTY BIG RESPONSIBILITY. 

06:15:21.902 --> 06:15:27.807
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THAT I SAID I 
WAS A CENTRAL FIGURE. I WAS A 

06:15:28.007 --> 06:15:33.283
TASK TO WORK ON THE UKRAINE 
FILE. 

06:15:33.284 --> 06:15:35.601
&gt;&gt; AND DID YOU TAKE ANY ACTIONS 
WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY PRESIDENT

06:15:35.802 --> 06:15:37.802
DONALD TRUMP? 
&gt;&gt;

06:15:40.395 --> 06:15:42.773
BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP OR THE
LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE 

06:15:42.978 --> 06:15:45.068
DEPARTMENT. 
&gt;&gt; WE EVER HAULED IN FOR ANY 

06:15:45.823 --> 06:15:50.930
ACTIONS THAT YOU HAD TAKEN ON 
YOUR WORK WITH UKRAINE? 

06:15:51.133 --> 06:15:53.608
BUCKNELL. 
&gt;&gt; AS TO RUDY GIULIANI. THE 

06:15:53.808 --> 06:15:57.002
PRESIDENT TOLD YOU TALK TO RUDY.
YOU TALK TO HIM A COUPLE OF 

06:15:57.211 --> 06:15:59.211
TIMES

06:16:01.925 --> 06:16:04.274
. AND YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT 
A COUPLE TIMES. DID THE 

06:16:04.479 --> 06:16:06.525
PRESIDENT EVER SAY TO YOU STOP 
TALKING TO RUDY ? 

06:16:06.526 --> 06:16:08.758
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; DID HE SAY DO NOT TALK TO 

06:16:08.964 --> 06:16:13.688
RUDY. YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE 
PLAYING THE HAND YOU WERE DEALT.

06:16:15.942 --> 06:16:17.942
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS THE 
DEALER WASN'T HE?

06:16:25.692 --> 06:16:27.972
IN YOUR METAPHOR YOU ARE PLAYING
THE HAND YOU'RE DEALT. IN THE 

06:16:28.682 --> 06:16:32.486
DEALER WAS TRUMP SEA. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL RECHARACTERIZE THE 

06:16:32.686 --> 06:16:34.686
QUESTION BY SAYING THAT WE 
FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF THE 

06:16:34.735 --> 06:16:36.993
PRESIDENT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE 
ONLY PATHWAY TO WORK WITH 

06:16:37.209 --> 06:16:39.209
UKRAINE.

06:16:47.010 --> 06:16:49.707
&gt;&gt; ON PAGE 4 OF YOUR TESTIMONY 
YOU SAID GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AND 

06:16:49.920 --> 06:16:52.842
WHAT WE KNEW AT THE TIME WHAT WE
ARE ASKED TO DO DID NOT APPEAR 

06:16:53.043 --> 06:16:55.536
TO BE WRONG. YOU WOULD AGREE NOW
KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW. THERE ARE

06:16:55.744 --> 06:16:58.335
SOME THINGS THAT WERE WRONG ? 
&gt;&gt; I AGREE. 

06:16:58.336 --> 06:17:02.606
&gt;&gt; LET'S TAKE OUT ANY LEVERAGING
OF

06:17:13.626 --> 06:17:15.732
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. WOULD YOU 
AGREE THAT IT IS WRONG FOR THE 

06:17:15.938 --> 06:17:18.018
PRESENT UNITED STATES TO ASK THE
LEADER OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 

06:17:18.222 --> 06:17:20.068
TO INVESTIGATE THE PRESENT 
UNITED STATES POLITICAL 

06:17:20.069 --> 06:17:22.069
OPPONENT? 
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU AGREE IN ADDITION 

06:17:22.186 --> 06:17:24.842
TO MAKING THAT INVESTIGATION 
THAT LEVERAGING A VISIT THAT A 

06:17:25.048 --> 06:17:27.588
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT LEADER 
DESPERATELY NEEDS IS ALSO WRONG?

06:17:28.861 --> 06:17:32.141
&gt;&gt; IN WHAT RESPECT? 
&gt;&gt; A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

06:17:32.347 --> 06:17:37.233
IF THEY NEED TO SHOW THEIR 
LEGITIMACY THAT LEVERAGING THAT 

06:17:37.439 --> 06:17:41.065
AND ASKING FOR AN INVESTIGATION 
WOULD BE WRONG ? 

06:17:41.066 --> 06:17:44.836
&gt;&gt; EVERY MEETING AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS CONDITIONS. I'VE NEVER

06:17:45.046 --> 06:17:47.879
WORKED ON A MEETING THAT DOESN'T
HAVE A HOST OF CONDITIONS. 

06:17:47.880 --> 06:17:55.667
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT MEAN WHEN IT'S 
INVEST GETTING A POLITICAL 

06:17:56.089 --> 06:17:57.655
OPPONENT. 
&gt;&gt; MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS OR 

06:17:57.656 --> 06:18:02.794
INVESTIGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ASK A FOREIGN LEADER 

06:18:02.999 --> 06:18:05.167
TO INVESTIGATE YOUR OPPONENT. 
AND LEVERAGE SECURITY ASSISTANCE

06:18:06.433 --> 06:18:09.840
. YOU HYPOTHETICALLY WOULD AGREE
THAT THAT IS WRONG. 

06:18:09.841 --> 06:18:17.211
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WORKED ON A LOT OF DEALS 

06:18:17.426 --> 06:18:23.465
INVOLVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
YOU WORKED FOR A GUY WHO WROTE

06:18:27.376 --> 06:18:29.376
"ART OF THE DEAL". AND STATE 
DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES THAT THEY 

06:18:29.441 --> 06:18:31.636
DON'T WANT TO MAKE LEGAL 
DEFINITIONS AROUND WHAT OCCURRED

06:18:36.924 --> 06:18:38.790
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE BEING 
LEVERAGED AGAINST THE 

06:18:38.791 --> 06:18:40.232
INVESTIGATION. YOU CALL IT QUID 
PRO QUO. 

06:18:40.233 --> 06:18:42.233
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; FINALLY. ONE FINAL 

06:18:42.360 --> 06:18:48.294
HYPOTHETICAL. IF SOMEBODY WALKS 
THROUGH THOSE TWO DOORS WEARING 

06:18:48.506 --> 06:18:50.506
RAIN BOOTS , RAIN BOOTS

06:18:54.862 --> 06:18:56.978
, UMBRELLA WITH THE RAINDROPS. 
YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT IT'S 

06:18:57.179 --> 06:19:00.274
RAINING TO CONCLUDE THAT IT 
MIGHT BE RAINING OUTSIDE? 

06:19:00.275 --> 06:19:02.506
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND YOUR 
HYPOTHETICAL. 

06:19:02.507 --> 06:19:04.507
&gt;&gt; I GO BACK.

06:19:11.655 --> 06:19:15.720
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AND 
VASSAR SONDLAND. MY COLLEAGUES 

06:19:16.481 --> 06:19:20.802
IN  CALIFORNIA IMPLIED THAT YOU 
HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF 

06:19:21.007 --> 06:19:23.007
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
CAMPAIGN.

06:19:28.723 --> 06:19:34.826
IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I DONATED TO THE INAUGURAL 

06:19:35.028 --> 06:19:37.028
COMMITTEE TO SECURE TICKETS.

06:19:45.785 --> 06:19:47.785
&gt;&gt; DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN OR 
OVERHEAR ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

06:19:47.832 --> 06:19:52.889
THE POTENTIAL INFORMATION 
COLLECTED BY UKRAINE ON THE 

06:19:53.102 --> 06:19:54.723
BIDENS TO BE USED FOR POLITICAL 
GAIN? 

06:19:54.724 --> 06:19:58.177
&gt;&gt; THAT I PERSONALLY HEAR THAT? 
NO. 

06:19:58.178 --> 06:20:04.669
&gt;&gt; DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN THIS 
CONVERSATION? 

06:20:04.670 --> 06:20:08.046
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR STATEMENT ON PAGE 5. 
YOU SAID THAT RUDY GIULIANI'S 

06:20:08.677 --> 06:20:13.756
REQUEST FOR QUIT PRO QUOTE TO 
ARRANGE A WHITE HOUSE VISIT WITH

06:20:13.962 --> 06:20:15.962
A

06:20:18.429 --> 06:20:20.429
UKRAINE

06:20:24.982 --> 06:20:26.982
PRESENT. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE 
THESE TWO STATEMENTS? BUT 

06:20:27.131 --> 06:20:30.823
THEY'RE HARD TO RECONCILE. WE 
WERE WORKING ALONG

06:20:34.531 --> 06:20:36.764
RUDY GIULIANI'S DIRECTION. WE 
STILL DID NOT HAVE A WHITE HOUSE

06:20:36.965 --> 06:20:42.504
MEETING. THE AIDE WAS HELD UP. 
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF REASONS 

06:20:43.210 --> 06:20:46.874
BEING GIVEN AS TO WHY THOSE WERE
NOT MOVING FORWARD. I FINALLY 

06:20:47.475 --> 06:20:49.475
GOT EXASPERATED

06:20:56.463 --> 06:20:58.508
BY RECEIVING AND VASSAR TAILORS 
LATEST TEXT. I PICKED UP THE 

06:20:58.708 --> 06:21:00.969
PHONE AND GOT THROUGH TO THE 
PRESENCE OF WHAT YOU WANT? 

06:21:00.970 --> 06:21:03.739
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC
CONVERSATIONS THAT RUDY GIULIANI

06:21:03.944 --> 06:21:11.706
HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT BETWEEN 
MAY 23 AND SEPTEMBER 11? 

06:21:11.707 --> 06:21:14.902
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT RECALL IF

06:21:24.502 --> 06:21:26.628
RUDY GIULIANI QUOTED FROM THE 
PRESIDENT OR SAID I JUST TALKED 

06:21:26.861 --> 06:21:28.682
TO THE PRESENT. MOST OF THE 
COMMUNICATION WENT THROUGH 

06:21:28.683 --> 06:21:30.683
AMBASSADOR VOLKER INITIALLY.

06:21:36.488 --> 06:21:39.271
&gt;&gt; ON PAGE 11 YOU SAID THAT RUDY
GIULIANI HAD BEEN COMMUNICATING

06:21:42.773 --> 06:21:44.773
WITH THE UKRAINIANS WITHOUT OUR 
KNOWLEDGE.

06:21:51.919 --> 06:21:54.553
WHICH UKRAINIANS WAS RUDY 
GIULIANI SPECIFICALLY 

06:21:54.967 --> 06:21:59.368
COMMUNICATING WITH ? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS SPEAKING TO THE TEXT 

06:21:59.572 --> 06:22:06.546
THAT I WAS REFERRING TO WITH 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER. 

06:22:06.547 --> 06:22:08.547
&gt;&gt; WHO SPECIFICALLY?

06:22:26.856 --> 06:22:29.457
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT RUDY GIULIANI

06:22:33.970 --> 06:22:36.016
HAS MET WITH THE FRINGE OF 
MEANINGS. DO YOU KNOW ANY 

06:22:36.224 --> 06:22:39.662
UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL THAT RUDY 
GIULIANI MET WITH ? 

06:22:39.663 --> 06:22:43.920
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT KNOW WHO HE WAS 
MEETING WITH. 

06:22:43.921 --> 06:22:46.556
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE ANY 
CONVERSATIONS WITH UKRAINIAN 

06:22:46.761 --> 06:22:48.761
OFFICIALS THAT CAME TO YOU

06:22:59.155 --> 06:23:01.696
AND SAID I JUST GOT OFF THE 
PHONE AND WHAT IS HE TALKING 

06:23:01.906 --> 06:23:04.414
ABOUT? BUT I DO NOT RECALL. 
&gt;&gt; WITH ABBY NORMAL? IN ALL OF 

06:23:04.625 --> 06:23:06.625
YOUR INTERACTION. IF THERE IS 
SOME ELEMENT OF THE U.S. 

06:23:06.671 --> 06:23:10.774
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE SPOKEN
TO. ISN'T IT USUALLY TRUE THAT 

06:23:10.978 --> 06:23:13.559
THEY COME IN TO THE AMBASSADOR 
AND TRY TO CLARIFY THE 

06:23:13.779 --> 06:23:15.779
STATEMENT.

06:23:19.909 --> 06:23:24.117
&gt;&gt; THINGS WORK ALL DIFFERENT 
KINDS OF WAYS THESE DAYS.

06:23:29.869 --> 06:23:35.494
EXPECTED THE INVESTIGATIONS OR 
JOE BIDEN COME UP.

06:23:41.041 --> 06:23:45.505
&gt;&gt; AS TESTIFIED EVERYONE SAID IT
WAS A GOOD CALL. 

06:23:45.506 --> 06:23:47.149
&gt;&gt; YOUR INTERACTION WITH 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY AS 

06:23:47.150 --> 06:23:49.150
HE IS STRAIGHT

06:23:52.823 --> 06:23:54.823
SHOOTER OR A LIAR? 
&gt;&gt; HE IMPRESSED ME GREATLY. AND 

06:23:54.892 --> 06:23:57.353
THAT IS WHY I WANTED TO GET HIM 
AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

06:23:57.562 --> 06:24:00.550
TOGETHER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO
WHEN HE MAKES STATEMENTS YOU 

06:24:00.757 --> 06:24:02.883
BELIEVE HIM? I GUESS WITH MY 
LIMITED INTERACTION HE SEEMS 

06:24:03.535 --> 06:24:05.535
HONORABLE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU INVESTOR HOPE YOU 

06:24:05.643 --> 06:24:07.643
MAKE IT PLAIN.

06:24:13.752 --> 06:24:15.671
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON AND VASSAR 
SONDLAND. OTHERS CLOSE TO 

06:24:15.672 --> 06:24:20.251
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAVE MADE
IT CLEAR  THAT INVESTIGATIONS 

06:24:20.458 --> 06:24:22.833
WERE PART OF A CONDITION FOR 
U.S. ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE. 

06:24:23.046 --> 06:24:25.046
INCLUDING

06:24:27.154 --> 06:24:29.546
RUDY GIULIANI AND ACTING CHIEF 
OF STAFF MULVANEY. SO SONDLAND 

06:24:34.867 --> 06:24:36.867
ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF 
STAFF DISCUSSED HIS BELIEF THAT 

06:24:36.961 --> 06:24:38.939
IT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO 
POLITICIZE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. 

06:24:38.940 --> 06:24:44.980
HOW OFTEN DID YOU SPEAK OR MEET 
WITH MR. MULVANEY?

06:24:48.881 --> 06:24:50.881
&gt;&gt; I AM GOING BY A BAD MEMORY.

06:24:57.211 --> 06:24:59.819
&gt;&gt; I THINK I ONLY HAD ONE FORMAL
MEETING WITH MR. MULVANEY. IT 

06:25:00.034 --> 06:25:01.293
WAS ON A COMPLETELY UNRELATED 
MATTER. 

06:25:01.294 --> 06:25:04.061
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK
WITH MR. MULVANEY ABOUT YOUR 

06:25:04.266 --> 06:25:06.266
EFFORTS?

06:25:08.182 --> 06:25:10.410
BUT MOST OF THE COMMUNICATION 
WAS THROUGH A STREAM OF EMAILS 

06:25:10.619 --> 06:25:15.717
THAT OTHERS WERE ON GENERALLY. I
MAY HAVE SEEN HIM AT THE WHITE 

06:25:15.924 --> 06:25:18.190
HOUSE CASUALLY AND SAID HELLO 
AND KEPT IN TOUCH. WE DID NOT 

06:25:18.395 --> 06:25:23.259
HAVE A BACK-AND-FORTH. 
&gt;&gt; WAS A YOUR SENSE THAT MR. 

06:25:23.759 --> 06:25:26.027
MULVANEY HAD A DIRECT LINE TO 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AS ACTING

06:25:26.265 --> 06:25:32.158
CHIEF OF STAFF? BUT LET'S LOOK 
AT WHAT MR. MULVANEY SAID DURING

06:25:32.362 --> 06:25:34.362
A PRESS CONFERENCE ON OCTOBER 
17.

06:25:41.095 --> 06:25:47.382
&gt;&gt; THOSE WERE THE DRIVING 
FACTORS. DID HE MENTION THE 

06:25:47.796 --> 06:25:50.200
CORRUPTION RELATED TO THE DNC 
SERVER. ABSOLUTELY. NO QUESTION.

06:25:50.407 --> 06:25:52.407
THAT IS WHY WE HELD UP THE 
MONEY.

06:26:05.262 --> 06:26:07.262
&gt;&gt; HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE 
CORRUPTION WITH THAT NATION. 

06:26:07.351 --> 06:26:09.863
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE.

06:26:25.980 --> 06:26:28.284
&gt;&gt; HE IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND 
HAS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

06:26:28.496 --> 06:26:33.543
PRESENT EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHAT 
DO YOU EXPECT THAT? 

06:26:33.544 --> 06:26:36.173
&gt;&gt; I WOULD EXPECT HE HAS A 
DIRECT LINE TO THE PRESENT. WHEN

06:26:36.382 --> 06:26:39.446
DID YOU FIRST LEARN THAT THE 
INVESTIGATIONS WERE HOLDING UP 

06:26:39.652 --> 06:26:41.652
THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE?

06:26:49.753 --> 06:26:51.753
&gt;&gt;

06:26:55.739 --> 06:26:58.020
AND VASSAR SONDLAND I KNOW THAT 
YOU ARE NOT A CAREER FOREIGN 

06:26:58.222 --> 06:27:00.565
SERVICE OFFICER. IS IT YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT  THE SECURITY

06:27:00.768 --> 06:27:03.074
SYSTEM INVESTIGATES POLITICAL 
RIVALS. 

06:27:03.075 --> 06:27:08.243
&gt;&gt; I HAVE ALREADY TESTIFIED THAT
I DID NOT THINK THAT THAT WOULD 

06:27:08.698 --> 06:27:12.088
BE PROPER. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S SEE WHAT MR. MULVANEY 

06:27:12.314 --> 06:27:14.584
HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT AT THE 
SAME PRESS CONFERENCE.

06:27:27.837 --> 06:27:29.837
BUT THOSE ARE THE DRIVING 
FACTORS.

06:27:36.370 --> 06:27:38.669
DID HE MENTION IN PASSING THE 
CORRUPTION RELATED TO THE DNC 

06:27:38.872 --> 06:27:40.924
SERVER. ABSOLUTELY. NO QUESTION 
ABOUT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE HELD 

06:27:41.122 --> 06:27:43.178
UP THE MONEY. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL GO AHEAD AND READ IT 

06:27:43.818 --> 06:27:45.818
FOR YOU.

06:27:55.254 --> 06:27:57.868
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEWS FOR EVERYBODY. 
GET OVER IT. THERE'S GOING TO BE

06:27:58.078 --> 06:27:59.143
POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND FOREIGN 
POLICY. 

06:27:59.144 --> 06:28:02.926
&gt;&gt; KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW NOW, DO
YOU AGREE WITH MR. MULVANEY

06:28:08.052 --> 06:28:13.581
, THAT WE SHOULD ALL GET OVER IT
AND ALLOW A PRESIDENT NOW OR 

06:28:13.796 --> 06:28:15.796
LATER TO INVESTIGATE A POLITICAL
RIVAL?

06:28:19.870 --> 06:28:21.734
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S A BIG 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLITICAL 

06:28:21.735 --> 06:28:23.735
INFLUENCE AND INVESTIGATING 
ARRIVAL. POLITICS ENTERS INTO 

06:28:23.888 --> 06:28:25.888
EVERYTHING.

06:28:32.052 --> 06:28:34.629
&gt;&gt; YOU AGREE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ASK FOR

06:28:34.852 --> 06:28:37.386
THE INVESTIGATION OF A POLITICAL
RIVAL ? 

06:28:37.387 --> 06:28:40.213
&gt;&gt; IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS 
GOING ON IN UKRAINE I BELIEVE 

06:28:40.424 --> 06:28:44.203
THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT 
INVESTIGATE A POLITICAL RIVAL

06:28:54.669 --> 06:28:59.493
FOR QUIT PRO QUOTE. 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT DID NOT TELL 

06:28:59.697 --> 06:29:06.075
YOU, HE SAID DIRECTLY TO 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY 

06:29:06.476 --> 06:29:08.476
THAT HE WANTED THE BIDENS 
INVESTIGATED.

06:29:16.023 --> 06:29:18.528
BUT BASED ON WHAT I KNEW I 
THOUGHT WE WERE OPERATING IN THE

06:29:19.228 --> 06:29:21.228
CENTER LANE

06:29:24.966 --> 06:29:29.645
. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK. 

06:29:29.646 --> 06:29:31.646
&gt;&gt; I LIKE TO ENTER INTO RECORD

06:29:35.901 --> 06:29:42.988
. AND VASSAR SONDLAND I WILL BE 
BRIEF.  IN ANTICIPATION OF

06:29:49.766 --> 06:29:51.829
MR. HOLMES'S TESTIMONY TOMORROW.
ABOUT THIS JULY PHONE CALL  THAT

06:29:52.532 --> 06:29:58.036
HE OVERHEARD AT A CAFÉ IN KYIV.

06:30:03.377 --> 06:30:06.100
THE CALL WAS NOT ON SPEAKER ? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT BELIEVE SO. 

06:30:06.101 --> 06:30:11.307
&gt;&gt; AN OPEN AIR CAFÉ? 
&gt;&gt; OUTDOORS. BUT ONE OF THE 

06:30:11.515 --> 06:30:13.658
POINTS THAT MY DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES CONTINUE TO MAKE IS 

06:30:13.963 --> 06:30:15.963
THAT

06:30:17.789 --> 06:30:19.789
DAVID HOLMES'S PRIOR TESTIMONY 
THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID

06:30:19.904 --> 06:30:26.053
THAT HE DOESN'T GIVE A BLANK 
ABOUT UKRAINE. YOU HEARD THAT 

06:30:26.265 --> 06:30:29.928
EARLIER. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT ON THE PHONE 

06:30:30.139 --> 06:30:33.522
CALL. I DON'T THINK THAT HE 
TESTIFIED THAT THAT WAS ON THE 

06:30:34.193 --> 06:30:37.852
PHONE CALL. HE TESTIFIED THAT I 
SUMMARIZED THE PHONE CALL AND I

06:30:42.169 --> 06:30:44.261
DID NOT SAY THAT. YOU HAVE NO 
RECOLLECTION OF THAT? 

06:30:44.262 --> 06:30:47.892
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT. 
&gt;&gt; EVEN IF THAT IS TRUE THERE IS

06:30:48.105 --> 06:30:49.542
NO PROBLEM HAVING AN OPINION 
ABOUT UKRAINE. 

06:30:49.543 --> 06:30:51.543
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL THE NARRATIVE THAT

06:30:54.961 --> 06:30:57.156
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS A BAD 
GUY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE 

06:30:57.368 --> 06:30:59.441
ABOUT THE UKRAINIANS. IT SEEMS 
TO ME THAT AND VASSAR SONDLAND 

06:30:59.643 --> 06:31:02.081
NOTHING SAYS YOU CAN  CARE MORE 
THAN SENDING MISSILES. DO YOU 

06:31:02.290 --> 06:31:04.290
AGREE WITH ME? 
&gt;&gt; I

06:31:07.560 --> 06:31:09.242
AGREE SENDING MISSILES IS 
SOMETHING THAT UKRAINE WANTED 

06:31:09.243 --> 06:31:13.655
AND NEEDED. 
&gt;&gt; THOSE WORK A LOT BETTER AT 

06:31:14.059 --> 06:31:17.560
STOPPING RUSSIAN TANKS. 
&gt;&gt; YOUR POINT IS TAKEN.

06:31:24.429 --> 06:31:26.429
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAMINA

06:31:29.508 --> 06:31:32.690
FAIRLY EASY QUESTIONS. WOULD YOU
AGREE THAT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

06:31:32.896 --> 06:31:37.095
IN OUR ELECTIONS CAN BE A THREAT
TO OUR DEMOCRACY? 

06:31:37.096 --> 06:31:39.096
&gt;&gt; UNDER CERTAIN

06:31:46.430 --> 06:31:47.667
CONDITIONS. 
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITIONS 

06:31:47.668 --> 06:31:50.107
WHERE IT'S NOT A THREAT? WHAT 
DID YOU SAY FOREIGN 

06:31:50.325 --> 06:31:50.961
INTERFERENCE. 
&gt;&gt; ALWAYS. 

06:31:50.962 --> 06:31:52.962
&gt;&gt; DO YOU AGREE THAT IDENTIFYING
AND PREVENTING THAT INFERENCE 

06:31:53.059 --> 06:31:54.895
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY TO THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ? 

06:31:54.896 --> 06:31:56.707
&gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE 
PRIORITIES. 

06:31:56.708 --> 06:31:58.708
&gt;&gt;

06:32:00.241 --> 06:32:02.356
WHEN YOU ARE ASSISTING PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP DID YOU REALIZE OF 

06:32:02.562 --> 06:32:05.519
THOSE INVESTIGATIONS COULD 
IMPACT THE 2020 ELECTION? 

06:32:05.520 --> 06:32:08.981
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS 

06:32:09.382 --> 06:32:15.277
EVER APPROPRIATE TO INVITE, 
PRESS, BRIBE, OR COERCE 

06:32:15.678 --> 06:32:18.080
INTERFERENCE INTO THE ELECTION ?
&gt;&gt; NO.

06:32:24.410 --> 06:32:27.418
BUT I WANT TO REFER TO SOMETHING
THAT YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING 

06:32:27.722 --> 06:32:29.722
STATEMENT.

06:32:31.934 --> 06:32:34.542
IF I HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN OF 
RUDY GIULIANI'S DEALINGS. I 

06:32:34.746 --> 06:32:39.128
WOULD NOT HAVE ACQUIESCED TO THE
PRECIPITATION PARTICIPATION. 

06:32:39.341 --> 06:32:41.341
IT'S HARD TO READ THAT WITHOUT

06:32:46.041 --> 06:32:48.524
SAYING THAT YOU THOUGHT IT 
WASN'T WRONG OR NOT REPUTABLE?

06:32:52.550 --> 06:32:53.987
&gt;&gt; WITH 2020 HINDSIGHT THAT IS 
FAIR. 

06:32:53.988 --> 06:32:58.246
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU CAME 
TO BELIEVE THAT THE REQUEST FOR 

06:32:58.648 --> 06:33:00.813
INVESTIGATION INTO BURISMA WAS A
REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE THE 

06:33:01.018 --> 06:33:03.018
BIDENS.

06:33:05.961 --> 06:33:09.612
INDEED THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE 
CALL MAKES SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO

06:33:09.826 --> 06:33:14.531
THAT. INCLUDING HUNTER BIDEN. 
AND RANKING MEMBERS SAID WE 

06:33:14.737 --> 06:33:16.737
COULD CLEAR THIS ALL UP

06:33:19.774 --> 06:33:22.098
IF HUNTER BIDEN COULD TESTIFY. I
HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION. WHAT 

06:33:22.309 --> 06:33:24.454
UKRAINIAN LAW DID HUNTER BIDEN 
VIOLATE ? 

06:33:24.455 --> 06:33:26.455
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT AWARE.

06:33:30.127 --> 06:33:32.518
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NONE. FINALLY.

06:33:36.830 --> 06:33:38.830
ALSO FROM YOUR OPENING 
STATEMENT. YOU SAID

06:33:47.194 --> 06:33:49.723
AS YOU KNOW I HAVE PROVIDED 10 
HOURS OF DEPOSITION TESTIMONY. I

06:33:49.928 --> 06:33:52.005
DID SO DESPITE DIRECTORS FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE STATE 

06:33:52.206 --> 06:33:54.308
DEPARTMENT THAT I REFUSED TO 
APPEAR AS MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE.

06:33:54.517 --> 06:33:56.564
I AGREED TO TESTIFY BECAUSE I 
RESPECT THE GRAVITY OF THE 

06:33:56.792 --> 06:33:58.967
MOMENT. I BELIEVE I HAVE AN 
OBLIGATION TO ACCOUNT FULLY FOR 

06:33:59.179 --> 06:34:04.474
MY ROLE IN THESE EVENTS. BY 
OBLIGATION DID YOU MEAN YOUR 

06:34:04.676 --> 06:34:08.923
LEGAL OBLIGATION OR DID YOU MEAN
SOMETHING BIGGER? 

06:34:08.924 --> 06:34:11.573
&gt;&gt; MY LEGAL AND MORAL 
OBLIGATION.

06:34:53.347 --> 06:34:55.347
&gt;&gt;

06:34:57.457 --> 06:34:59.490
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS 
HERE THAT THEY COULD HAVE 

06:34:59.690 --> 06:35:01.690
FREEDOM THAT THEY HAD NOT 
ENJOYED, SECURITY THAT THEY HAD 

06:35:02.260 --> 06:35:07.409
NOT ENJOYED, AND OPPORTUNITY 
THAT THEY HAD NOT ENJOYED. NO 

06:35:07.609 --> 06:35:12.211
DOUBT ON SOME LEVEL, A

06:35:16.749 --> 06:35:18.884
SENSE OF PATRIOTISM IN YOU, IS 
THAT FAIR TO SAY? 

06:35:18.885 --> 06:35:20.885
&gt;&gt; VERY FAIR.

06:35:23.855 --> 06:35:26.314
&gt;&gt; WHY THEN WITH YOUR COURAGE TO
COME BEFORE SCOTT DOES THAT SAME

06:35:26.503 --> 06:35:31.081
STANDARD NOT APPLY TO MICK 
MULVANEY, MR. DUFFY, MR. POMPEO,

06:35:32.527 --> 06:35:34.527
MR. GIULIANI,

06:35:39.707 --> 06:35:41.941
WHY SHOULD THOSE SAME SENTIMENTS
NOT BE WITHIN THEIR HEARTS TO DO

06:35:42.141 --> 06:35:44.376
THEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY AND DO WHAT
YOU HAVE DONE SIR, INDEED WHY 

06:35:44.580 --> 06:35:47.166
DOES THAT SAME STANDARD APPLIED 
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

06:35:47.327 --> 06:35:50.219
STATES?
&gt;&gt; I WISH I COULD ANSWER.

06:35:50.220 --> 06:35:55.947
&gt;&gt; I SUSPECT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE 
THERE IS NO GOOD ANSWER, BUT I 

06:35:56.162 --> 06:35:58.596
DO APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS 
TO COME HERE TODAY. WITH THAT I 

06:35:59.357 --> 06:36:02.346
YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; MR. JORDAN? 

06:36:02.347 --> 06:36:07.538
&gt;&gt; UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ENTER 
INTO THE RECORD A STATEMENT FROM

06:36:08.294 --> 06:36:10.294
MICK MULVANEY.

06:36:13.419 --> 06:36:15.456
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE NOT SEEN THESE 
STATEMENTS, I PRESUME THEY ARE 

06:36:15.654 --> 06:36:17.484
ACCURATE AND NO OBJECTION. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

06:36:17.485 --> 06:36:22.312
NOT A BIG FAN OF FOREIGN AID IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

06:36:22.313 --> 06:36:25.151
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A FAIR
CHARACTERIZATION, I THINK HE IS 

06:36:25.312 --> 06:36:29.056
CAREFUL.
&gt;&gt; FAIR ENOUGH, HE KNEW UKRAINE 

06:36:29.271 --> 06:36:32.001
WAS CORRUPT, IS THAT RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; YES. 

06:36:32.002 --> 06:36:39.225
&gt;&gt; AND THE PRESIDENT HAD A 
BELIEF THAT THE UKRAINIAN 

06:36:39.423 --> 06:36:42.619
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE SENIOR
OFFICIALS SUPPORTED

06:36:46.940 --> 06:36:48.940
THE OPPONENT, A MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT SAID THE MAJORITY OF 

06:36:49.524 --> 06:36:51.524
UKRAINIAN POLITICIANS

06:36:53.430 --> 06:36:55.678
WANT HILLARY CLINTON TO WIN, HE 
HAD THAT BELIEF AS WELL, HE 

06:36:55.879 --> 06:36:59.133
UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING, A
BRAND-NEW GUY IN UKRAINE, IF 

06:36:59.332 --> 06:37:08.269
THIS ZELINSKI GUY WINS. AND WITH
THESE OTHER GUYS, HE WANTS TO 

06:37:08.471 --> 06:37:12.325
SEE IF THE NEW GUY IS THE REAL 
DEAL AND DEAL WITH THE 

06:37:13.088 --> 06:37:18.224
CORRUPTION PROBLEM. THE AID GETS
HELD UP FOR 55 DAYS, UNDULATE --

06:37:18.424 --> 06:37:25.530
HELD UP ON JULY 18, RELEASED ON 
SEPTEMBER 11, 55 DAYS, BUT MORE 

06:37:25.730 --> 06:37:31.424
IMPORTANT IT SEEMS TO ME IS THE 
14 DAYS, WHEN UKRAINE REALIZED 

06:37:31.626 --> 06:37:34.743
AID WAS HELD UP ON THE 29th, 
WE'VE HAD YOU TESTIFY TO THAT, 

06:37:34.903 --> 06:37:39.743
AND A POLITICAL ARTICLE. AID 
GETS HELD UP ON -- UKRAINE 

06:37:40.494 --> 06:37:45.642
LEARNS THAT IT IS SET UP ON 
AUGUST 29, AND THEN OF COURSE 

06:37:45.841 --> 06:37:51.328
RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 11. IN 
THOSE 14 DAYS THERE ARE THREE 

06:37:51.530 --> 06:37:52.946
IMPORTANT MEETINGS WITH SENIOR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND 

06:37:52.947 --> 06:37:57.341
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.  BETWEEN 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, AND

06:38:04.531 --> 06:38:06.363
ZELENSKY, AND VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE, AND SEPTEMBER 5, WHERE 

06:38:06.364 --> 06:38:10.619
U.S. SENATORS MURPHY AND JOHNSON
MEET WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.  

06:38:11.034 --> 06:38:13.034
NONE OF THOSE MEETINGS, DID ANY 
LINKAGE TO

06:38:17.123 --> 06:38:19.123
SECURITY ASSISTANCE DOLLARS AND 
AN ANNOUNCEMENT OR START OF ANY 

06:38:19.154 --> 06:38:21.154
INVESTIGATION EVER,. NONE OF 
THEM.

06:38:26.271 --> 06:38:28.504
BUT THE ONE THAT IS MOST 
IMPORTANT IS PROBABLY THE ONE WE

06:38:28.705 --> 06:38:30.939
HAVE TALKED LEAST ABOUT, THAT IS
THE SEPTEMBER 5 MEETING. THAT IS

06:38:31.140 --> 06:38:34.390
A MEETING WHERE THERE IS NO ONE 
-- WELL, IT IS MUCH MORE 

06:38:34.791 --> 06:38:38.244
CONGRESSIONAL FOCUSED THAN WHITE
HOUSE FOCUSED. SENATORS MURPHY, 

06:38:39.217 --> 06:38:42.221
AND JOHNSON, BIPARTISAN, MEET 
WITH

06:38:45.965 --> 06:38:48.613
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. WHAT IS 
INTERESTING IS THAT  WHAT THEY 

06:38:48.814 --> 06:38:52.211
HAVE GIVEN US CUT OUR LETTERS 
REGARDING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 

06:38:52.381 --> 06:38:57.751
MEETING. SENATOR MURPHY SAID I 
BROACHED THE TOPIC, AND THE 

06:38:57.952 --> 06:39:00.601
OTHER EMISSARIES TO LAUNCH 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THEIR 

06:39:01.201 --> 06:39:06.287
POLITICAL RIVALS, MURPHY BROUGHT
IT UP. YOU HAVE 2 SENATORS WERE 

06:39:06.485 --> 06:39:08.485
BOTH STRONG SUPPORTERS OF

06:39:11.355 --> 06:39:13.463
MONEY, UKRAINE, ALL AFFORD, 
SENATOR MURPHY, A DEMOCRAT, 

06:39:13.627 --> 06:39:16.840
RINGS OF THE ISSUE EVERYONE HAS 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IT SEEMS TO 

06:39:17.041 --> 06:39:23.142
ME IF EVER THERE WAS GOING TO BE
A TIME WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF 

06:39:23.343 --> 06:39:25.373
UKRAINE SAYS GUYS, YOU DON'T 
KNOW WHAT I'M DEALING WITH, I 

06:39:26.126 --> 06:39:28.624
DIDN'T PRESSURE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, HE 

06:39:28.825 --> 06:39:34.525
WANTS ME TO DO THIS, IT SEEMS IF
THERE EVER THERE WAS A TIME, THE

06:39:34.725 --> 06:39:40.810
NEW GUY, WHO KNOWS THE HAS BEEN 
ON HOLD, IF EVER THERE WAS A 

06:39:41.009 --> 06:39:43.169
TIME TO BRING IT UP, THAT WAS 
THE TIME.

06:39:47.740 --> 06:39:50.203
BUT GUESS WHAT, AT NO TIME, 
SENATOR JOHNSON TELLS US, DURING

06:39:50.532 --> 06:39:53.022
THIS MEETING OR ANY OTHER 
MEETING ON THIS TRIP, WAS THERE 

06:39:53.224 --> 06:39:57.278
ANY MENTION BY ZELENSKY OR ANY 
OTHER UKRAINIANS THAT THEY WERE 

06:39:57.490 --> 06:40:00.874
FEELING PRESSURE  TO DO ANYTHING
IN RETURN FOR MILITARY AID, NOT 

06:40:01.040 --> 06:40:03.040
EVEN

06:40:06.424 --> 06:40:08.424
NOT EVEN AFTER MURPHY WARNED 
THEM ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED IN 

06:40:08.995 --> 06:40:18.157
THE ELECTION. SO A BIG DEAL ON 
GIULIANI AND NOTHING. I DON'T

06:40:20.433 --> 06:40:22.433
DISPUTE ANY FACTUAL

06:40:26.934 --> 06:40:28.966
-- REGARDING THE MEETING. 
SEPTEMBER 5 WAS THE DAY, NO ONE 

06:40:29.167 --> 06:40:31.202
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WAS THERE, 
NOT AMBASSADOR BOLTON, NO ONE 

06:40:31.965 --> 06:40:36.883
THERE, BUT WE'VE GOT ALL KINDS 
OF OTHER MEETINGS WHAT HAPPENED,

06:40:37.099 --> 06:40:39.444
AND AS YOU TESTIFIED EARLIER, 
THERE WAS NEVER AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

06:40:40.551 --> 06:40:44.807
THERE WERE 3 QUID PRO QUOS, BUT 
THERE WEREN'T, THERE WAS NEVER 

06:40:45.556 --> 06:40:48.712
AN ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS AS 
CLEAR AS IT GETS, THESE GUYS 

06:40:48.879 --> 06:40:53.456
KEEP WANT TO STIRRED UP -- KEEP 
STIRRING IT UP,

06:40:59.432 --> 06:41:01.464
BASED ON NO DIRECT EVIDENCE, AND
THE BEST DIRECT EVIDENCE WE 

06:41:01.666 --> 06:41:03.701
HAVE, THE PRESIDENT TOLD YOU, I 
WANT NOTHING, THERE IS NO? 

06:41:03.903 --> 06:41:07.354
QUOTE, I WANT ZELENSKY TO DO 
EXACTLY WHAT HE CAMPAIGNED ON,  

06:41:07.767 --> 06:41:10.565
AND WHEN THAT BECAME CLEAR TO 
US, GUESS WHAT, THEY GOT THE 

06:41:10.727 --> 06:41:14.470
MONEY. GOD BLESS AMERICA, IT ALL
WORKED OUT, RIGHT? THIS IS CRAZY

06:41:14.670 --> 06:41:20.088
WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH. THE 
FACTS ARE SO DARN CLEAR, I YIELD

06:41:20.257 --> 06:41:22.257
BACK.
&gt;&gt; MR. WELCH

06:41:26.044 --> 06:41:27.057
? 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR, I AM IMPRESSED 

06:41:27.058 --> 06:41:29.058
WITH YOUR CAREER, VERY IMPRESSED

06:41:34.781 --> 06:41:36.611
WITH YOUR SUCCESS, AND YOUR 
PUBLIC SERVICE, AND IMPRESSED 

06:41:36.612 --> 06:41:40.267
WITH YOUR FORTHRIGHT STATEMENT, 
THANK YOU FOR THAT. YOU SAID IT 

06:41:40.466 --> 06:41:42.702
WAS THE HIGHEST HONOR FOR YOU TO
HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE 

06:41:43.464 --> 06:41:46.273
THIS APPOINTMENT, TO SERVE AS 
AMBASSADOR TO THE EU

06:41:56.105 --> 06:41:56.817
, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

06:41:56.818 --> 06:41:58.756
&gt;&gt; YOU QUICKLY BECAME INVOLVED 
IN UKRAINE POLICY, THAT HAS BEEN

06:41:58.757 --> 06:42:00.757
DESCRIBED BY YOU AND OTHERS, 
REALLY VERY CLEAR, TO HELP 

06:42:00.776 --> 06:42:02.776
UKRAINE FIGHT INTERNAL 
CORRUPTION AND RESIST

06:42:06.677 --> 06:42:07.577
EXTERNAL AGGRESSION, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

06:42:07.578 --> 06:42:09.672
&gt;&gt; AND THIS CONGRESS, WITH THE 
SUPPORT OF EVERYONE APPEAR, 

06:42:09.831 --> 06:42:12.760
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, WITH 
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF 

06:42:13.511 --> 06:42:16.223
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, 
AUTHORIZED THE RELEASE OF 

06:42:16.983 --> 06:42:24.345
MILITARY AID. AND YOU AND OTHERS
WHO WERE WORKING THERE, BUT 

06:42:24.545 --> 06:42:27.996
BELIEVED IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT 
TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT, PRESIDENT

06:42:28.197 --> 06:42:30.197
ZELENSKY, TO HAVE THE WHITE 
HOUSE MEETING TO SHOW OUR 

06:42:30.790 --> 06:42:34.460
SUPPORT,  AND SEND A SIGNAL TO 
RUSSIA, CORRECT? 

06:42:34.461 --> 06:42:36.943
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; FROM HEARING YOU AND THE 

06:42:37.704 --> 06:42:45.625
OTHER WITNESSES, AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH, AND VOLKER

06:42:51.569 --> 06:42:53.598
AND MORE, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO 
RELEASE THE AID? BECAUSE THERE 

06:42:53.799 --> 06:42:56.635
WAS A CONCERTED EFFORT ON MY 
PART TO GET THE MEETING, THAT 

06:42:56.849 --> 06:42:58.849
WAS MY SINGULAR NARROW

06:43:02.334 --> 06:43:04.353
FOCUS, TO GET THE MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS SHARED BY ALL THE 

06:43:04.566 --> 06:43:05.529
COLLEAGUES I JUST MENTIONED, 
CORRECT? 

06:43:05.530 --> 06:43:07.530
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; INCREDIBLY URGENT,

06:43:10.051 --> 06:43:12.051
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR DESCRIBED 
GOING TO THE FRONT, WHERE 

06:43:12.083 --> 06:43:16.459
UKRAINIANS WERE DYING AT THE DON
BASS, IT WAS A

06:43:21.223 --> 06:43:23.456
EXISTENTIAL ISSUE FOR THEM THAT 
THEY GET THE AID, YOU WERE WELL 

06:43:23.656 --> 06:43:25.894
AWARE OF THAT, AND I'M SURE 
SHARED HIS CONCERNS. IS THAT 

06:43:26.092 --> 06:43:28.684
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

06:43:28.685 --> 06:43:30.685
&gt;&gt; AND IN YOUR FORTHRIGHT 
TESTIMONY,

06:43:35.841 --> 06:43:37.841
YOU HAVE TESTIFIED, REALLY WITH 
THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, THAT 

06:43:37.877 --> 06:43:39.877
YOU CAN PIECE IT ALL TOGETHER,

06:43:43.162 --> 06:43:45.593
GIULIANI KNEW IN REAL TIME WHAT 
YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS 

06:43:45.815 --> 06:43:48.029
YOU WENT ALONG, IS THAT A FAIR 
STATEMENT? BECAUSE I THINK SO. 

06:43:48.191 --> 06:43:52.718
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU ACTED 
ON THE ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT, 

06:43:52.909 --> 06:43:55.057
THAT WAS YOU ACTING ON HIS 
ORDERS CORRECT? 

06:43:55.058 --> 06:43:56.421
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU SAID QUITE EXPLICITLY

06:43:56.422 --> 06:44:00.833
THERE WAS A QUID PRO QUO? 
&gt;&gt; RELATING TO THE MEETING AND 

06:44:01.590 --> 06:44:04.580
THE PRISMA -- BURISMA

06:44:11.186 --> 06:44:12.613
. 
&gt;&gt; NO MEETING UNLESS THERE IS A 

06:44:12.614 --> 06:44:15.611
INVESTIGATION RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD BY 

06:44:15.778 --> 06:44:17.185
GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; AND -- 

06:44:17.186 --> 06:44:19.186
&gt;&gt;

06:44:22.566 --> 06:44:24.712
UNLESS THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT
OF AN INVESTIGATION. 

06:44:24.713 --> 06:44:26.713
&gt;&gt; DID

06:44:28.856 --> 06:44:31.303
IT IMPEDE THE EFFORTS THAT YOU 
AND OTHERS WERE MAKING TO TRY TO

06:44:31.503 --> 06:44:33.503
ADVANCE THAT UKRAINE POLICY?

06:44:35.772 --> 06:44:37.772
&gt;&gt; NOT INITIALLY. 
&gt;&gt; ULTIMATELY?

06:44:41.658 --> 06:44:43.488
&gt;&gt; ULTIMATELY NOTHING HAPPENED. 
&gt;&gt; AND GIULIANI WAS INSISTENT ON

06:44:43.489 --> 06:44:47.343
THE MEETING CORRECT? MEEKER THE 
INVESTIGATION. --

06:44:47.344 --> 06:44:53.441
&gt;&gt; THE INVESTIGATION. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. I ASKED THIS OF 

06:44:54.202 --> 06:44:59.686
AMBASSADOR VOLKER, IF THE MAYOR 
OF PORTLAND SAYS TO THE POLICE 

06:44:59.847 --> 06:45:03.993
CHIEF, I'M NOT GOING TO 
AUTHORIZE YOUR BUDGET UNLESS YOU

06:45:04.207 --> 06:45:06.025
AGREED TO DO AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO MY POLITICAL OPPONENT, 

06:45:06.026 --> 06:45:09.398
WOULD THAT BE WRONG?
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE. 

06:45:09.399 --> 06:45:11.399
&gt;&gt;

06:45:13.542 --> 06:45:15.577
AND LIKEWISE, IF WERE THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF OREGON 

06:45:15.778 --> 06:45:17.474
DOING THE SAME THING CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

06:45:17.475 --> 06:45:22.236
&gt;&gt; WITH THE SAME ROLE APPLIED TO
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

06:45:22.399 --> 06:45:24.399
STATES?

06:45:26.143 --> 06:45:27.523
&gt;&gt; TO INVESTIGATE A POLITICAL 
OPPONENT? YES. 

06:45:27.524 --> 06:45:32.313
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE QUESTION HERE. 
THE QUESTION IN -- IS, THE 

06:45:33.189 --> 06:45:35.189
PRESIDENT

06:45:37.925 --> 06:45:39.959
ASKED THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, 
WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED AID AND A

06:45:40.160 --> 06:45:44.170
MEETING, TO DO AN INVESTIGATION,
FOCUSED ON JOE BIDEN, HUNTER 

06:45:44.333 --> 06:45:51.535
BIDEN, BURISMA, AND CROWDSTRIKE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT, 

06:45:51.733 --> 06:45:53.970
THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS SPEAK FOR 
THEMSELVES. YOU FEEL, AS A 

06:45:54.171 --> 06:45:56.301
PERSON WHO WENT INTO SERVICE TO 
SERVE,

06:46:01.285 --> 06:46:04.084
WHO HAD A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT 
SHARED YOUR DESIRE TO HELP 

06:46:04.249 --> 06:46:09.002
UKRAINE, DO YOU FEEL IN ANY WAY 
BETRAYED BY THE DOUBLEDEALING OF

06:46:09.204 --> 06:46:13.672
THE PRESIDENT? THIS IS A REAL 
QUESTION.

06:46:13.673 --> 06:46:15.051
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO CHARACTERIZE 
-- 

06:46:15.052 --> 06:46:16.107
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
CHARACTERIZE HIM.

06:46:16.108 --> 06:46:21.802
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO, WE LIKE TO
DO SOMETHING USEFUL, NO BETTER 

06:46:21.995 --> 06:46:25.458
JOY THAN WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT 
FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND WITH OTHER 

06:46:25.659 --> 06:46:28.697
PEOPLE. 
&gt;&gt; LET ME ANSWER THIS WAY, I 

06:46:28.911 --> 06:46:30.730
WOULD HAVE PREFERRED, AND I'M 
SURE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE 

06:46:30.731 --> 06:46:32.731
PREFERRED, THAT THE PRESIDENT 
SIMPLY MET WITH

06:46:36.218 --> 06:46:38.218
MR. ZELENSKY RIGHT AWAY, OUR 
ASSESSMENT WAS THAT THEY WOULD 

06:46:38.247 --> 06:46:40.388
GET ON FAMOUSLY,  HE WAS SMART, 
FUNNY, CHARMING,

06:46:44.751 --> 06:46:46.783
THE KIND OF PERSON THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE, AND ONCE 

06:46:46.985 --> 06:46:51.194
THE TWO OF THEM GOT TOGETHER, 
WITHOUT THE CHEMISTRY WOULD TAKE

06:46:51.358 --> 06:46:53.358
OVER AND GOOD THINGS WOULD 
HAPPEN BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE 

06:46:53.484 --> 06:46:55.484
UKRAINE RELATIONSHIP, THAT IS 
WHY WE WERE PUSHING FOR A?, 

06:46:56.079 --> 06:46:58.079
UNCONDITIONAL MEETING. 
&gt;&gt;

06:46:59.984 --> 06:47:02.218
SO IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT HE 
WAS NOT WILLING TO MEET WITHOUT 

06:47:02.418 --> 06:47:04.358
THE COMMITMENT ON THE 
INVESTIGATION. THANK YOU 

06:47:04.359 --> 06:47:06.283
AMBASSADOR.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

06:47:06.284 --> 06:47:10.046
&gt;&gt;&gt; MR. MALONEY? 
&gt;&gt; THIS PICK UP THERE,

06:47:15.626 --> 06:47:17.659
YOU WOULD PREFERRED THAT THEY 
WOULD JUST HAVE THE MEETING WITH

06:47:17.858 --> 06:47:19.690
UKRAINE WITHOUT THESE 
CONDITIONS, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE

06:47:19.691 --> 06:47:20.181
SAYING? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

06:47:20.182 --> 06:47:21.829
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE WERE CONDITIONS, 
INVOLVING A INVESTIGATION? 

06:47:21.830 --> 06:47:26.191
&gt;&gt; THE INITIAL INVITATION THAT 
THE PRESIDENT SENT TO PRESIDENT 

06:47:26.411 --> 06:47:30.045
ZELENSKY HAD NO CONDITIONS. 
&gt;&gt;  BUT THAT DIDN'T LAST VERY 

06:47:30.247 --> 06:47:35.943
LONG, DID IT? THEN THERE WERE 
CONDITIONS, THIS IS NOT 

06:47:36.145 --> 06:47:38.084
CONTROVERSIAL I BELIEVE, THAT 
THE PRESIDENT WANTED 

06:47:38.085 --> 06:47:41.425
INVESTIGATIONS. AND YOU THOUGHT 
THEY WERE OF BURISMA IN THE 2015

06:47:41.626 --> 06:47:45.603
ELECTION.  AND WE NOW KNOW THAT 
BURISMA MEANS THE BIDENS? 

06:47:45.604 --> 06:47:47.604
&gt;&gt; 

06:47:53.409 --> 06:47:55.026
WE DO NOW. 
&gt;&gt; AND SET ASIDE ANY CONFUSION 

06:47:55.027 --> 06:47:57.058
THAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS ASKING FOR
AN INVESTIGATION OF BURISMA OVER

06:47:57.266 --> 06:47:59.266
THE SEVEN WHAT THEY REALLY MEANT
WAS  THE BIDENS. 

06:47:59.267 --> 06:48:01.682
&gt;&gt; WITH 2020 HINDSIGHT, YES. 
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. THE DAY AFTER THE 

06:48:01.841 --> 06:48:04.680
PRESIDENT'S FAMOUS CALL,

06:48:09.862 --> 06:48:12.097
YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH WITH DAVID 
HOLMES, I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HAVE

06:48:12.298 --> 06:48:14.531
NO REASON TO DISPUTE WOULD MR. 
HOLMES SAID, AND I THINK YOU 

06:48:14.732 --> 06:48:16.732
SAID YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY 
REASON TO

06:48:22.857 --> 06:48:24.487
SAY YOU DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT 
INVESTIGATIONS WITH THE 

06:48:24.488 --> 06:48:26.106
PRESIDENT, HE RAISED 
INVESTIGATIONS WITH YOU ON THE 

06:48:26.107 --> 06:48:26.597
26? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

06:48:26.598 --> 06:48:31.499
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS ABOUT THE BIDENS AND
PRISMA -- BURISMA,  AND 2016? 

06:48:31.500 --> 06:48:38.000
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES SAYS YOU SAID 
BIDENS AFTER THAT, BUT

06:48:42.156 --> 06:48:43.736
YOU DON'T RECALL IT, DO YOU 
DISPUTE IT? 

06:48:43.737 --> 06:48:47.239
&gt;&gt; I DO. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T RECALL IT, AND 

06:48:47.441 --> 06:48:48.861
HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT 
INVESTIGATIONS WITH YOU?

06:48:48.862 --> 06:48:53.844
&gt;&gt; WITH THE COMPLETE PICTURE, 
WHAT HE SAID BEFORE. 

06:48:53.845 --> 06:48:59.010
&gt;&gt; OKAY. AND IT IS WRONG TO 
INVESTIGATE LOCAL OPPONENTS, WE 

06:48:59.223 --> 06:49:00.507
AGREE ON THAT? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

06:49:00.508 --> 06:49:04.494
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT IS WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ASKING FOR. SO LET

06:49:04.705 --> 06:49:08.717
ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, WHO WOULD 
HAVE BENEFITED FROM AN 

06:49:08.882 --> 06:49:11.567
INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S
POLITICAL OPPONENTS? 

06:49:11.568 --> 06:49:15.822
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO CHARACTERIZE 
WHO WOULD HAVE HER WOULD NOT 

06:49:16.051 --> 06:49:19.072
HAVE. 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO 

06:49:19.233 --> 06:49:22.981
CHARACTERIZE, BUT PLEASE ANSWER 
THE QUESTION. 

06:49:22.982 --> 06:49:26.030
&gt;&gt; PLEASE REPEAT. 
&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM 

06:49:26.249 --> 06:49:27.766
INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S
POLITICAL OPPONENTS? 

06:49:27.767 --> 06:49:30.292
&gt;&gt; PRESUMABLY THE PERSON WHO 
ASKED FOR THE INVESTIGATION.

06:49:30.293 --> 06:49:35.376
&gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT? 
&gt;&gt; IF THE PRESIDENT ASKED FOR 

06:49:35.577 --> 06:49:36.752
THE INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD BE 
HE. 

06:49:36.753 --> 06:49:39.978
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL. THE
PRESIDENT ASKED YOU ABOUT 

06:49:40.140 --> 06:49:43.709
INVESTIGATIONS, HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT THE BIDENS. WHEN HE ASKED 

06:49:43.909 --> 06:49:45.909
YOU ABOUT THE BIDENS, THE 
INVESTIGATION,

06:49:49.997 --> 06:49:52.431
WHO WAS HE SEEKING TO BENEFIT? 
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT ASKED ME ABOUT THE

06:49:53.183 --> 06:49:55.641
BIDEN INVESTIGATION.
&gt;&gt; SIR, WE JUST WENT THROUGH 

06:49:55.803 --> 06:49:57.803
THIS.

06:49:59.952 --> 06:50:01.369
WHEN YESTERDAY ABOUT 
INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH WE AGREE 

06:50:01.370 --> 06:50:06.050
MEANS THE BIDENS, WE DID THIS 30
SECONDS AGO. CORRECT? IT IS A 

06:50:06.252 --> 06:50:08.252
SIMPLE QUESTION, I'M HAVING 
TROUBLE

06:50:12.548 --> 06:50:14.548
WHY YOU CAN'T JUST SAY -- 
&gt;&gt; WHEN HE ASKED ABOUT 

06:50:14.583 --> 06:50:15.960
INVESTIGATIONS, I ASSUMED IT 
MEANT THE COMPANY. 

06:50:15.961 --> 06:50:21.287
&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THE BIDENS? 

06:50:21.452 --> 06:50:22.515
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT 
QUESTIONS. 

06:50:22.516 --> 06:50:27.171
&gt;&gt; I'M ASKING YOU ONE. 
&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM 

06:50:27.372 --> 06:50:31.397
INVESTIGATION OF THE BIDENS? 
&gt;&gt; I ASSUME THE PRESIDENT. 

06:50:31.398 --> 06:50:36.725
&gt;&gt; THERE WE GO, YOU SEE, IT 
DIDN'T HURT A BIT. LET ME ASK 

06:50:36.926 --> 06:50:38.926
YOU SOMETHING. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTHRIGHT,

06:50:42.208 --> 06:50:43.788
AND I RESENT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING 
TO SAY. 

06:50:43.789 --> 06:50:46.473
&gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR THIRD TRY TO DO 
SO. IT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL THE 

06:50:46.674 --> 06:50:49.309
FIRST TIME, DID IT? WE HAD A 
LITTLE DECLARATION, AND AFTER, 

06:50:49.513 --> 06:50:51.513
WE ARE HERE A THIRD TIME,

06:50:56.011 --> 06:50:58.257
AND WE GOT A DOOZY OF A 
STATEMENT, THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH

06:50:58.457 --> 06:51:00.476
OF STUFF YOU DON'T RECALL, ALL 
DUE RESPECT, WE APPRECIATE YOUR 

06:51:00.693 --> 06:51:04.008
CANDOR THAT'S YOUR CANDOR BUT 
LET'S BE CLEAR ON WHAT IT TOOK 

06:51:04.171 --> 06:51:06.375
TO GET IT OUT OF YOU. MY 
QUESTION IS, WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

06:51:06.576 --> 06:51:10.183
IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
UKRAINIANS, WITHHOLDING A 

06:51:10.343 --> 06:51:13.279
MEETING, TO GET THIS 
INVESTIGATION THAT YOU AND I 

06:51:13.481 --> 06:51:15.481
AGREE WOULD BENEFIT HIM 
POLITICALLY.

06:51:19.984 --> 06:51:22.186
WHAT KIND OF POSITION DOES THAT 
PUT THE UKRAINIANS IN SIR? 

06:51:22.187 --> 06:51:23.676
&gt;&gt; A TERRIBLE POSITION. 
&gt;&gt; WHY?

06:51:23.677 --> 06:51:25.677
&gt;&gt; WHY DOES IT PUT HIM

06:51:28.721 --> 06:51:30.708
-- THEM IN A TERRIBLE POSITION? 
&gt;&gt; WHY. 

06:51:30.709 --> 06:51:34.034
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING 
ULTIMATELY WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS

06:51:34.216 --> 06:51:42.942
COMING TO THEM, IT PUTS THEM IN 
A POSITION THAT JEOPARDIZES 

06:51:43.700 --> 06:51:45.700
THEIR SECURITY

06:51:48.826 --> 06:51:50.255
. 
&gt;&gt; IN A POSITION TO HELP THIS 

06:51:50.256 --> 06:51:53.712
SECURITY, BUT IT WOULD TO FIT 
THE PRESIDENT POLITICALLY, THEY 

06:51:53.909 --> 06:51:58.175
ARE BEING ASKED TO GIVE THEM A 
PERSONAL BENEFIT IN EXCHANGE FOR

06:51:58.377 --> 06:52:02.227
AN OFFICIAL ACT, IS THAT A FAIR 
SUMMARY?

06:52:02.228 --> 06:52:04.228
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR HYPOTHETICAL TEST 
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL. 

06:52:04.262 --> 06:52:06.262
THIS IS REAL LIFE,

06:52:15.232 --> 06:52:17.464
WERE THEY ASKED TO GIVE HIM A 
PERSONAL BENEFIT IN EXCHANGE FOR

06:52:17.678 --> 06:52:19.497
AN OFFICIAL ACT? 
&gt;&gt; SIR, I'M NOT GOING TO GO 

06:52:19.498 --> 06:52:21.532
AROUND IN CIRCLES, PLEASE BE 
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING 

06:52:21.733 --> 06:52:23.150
ME. 
&gt;&gt; MY TIME IS EXPIRED, THANK YOU

06:52:23.151 --> 06:52:25.151
FOR YOUR APPEARANCE.
&gt;&gt;

06:52:28.159 --> 06:52:34.736
MS. DEMINGS.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF 

06:52:34.936 --> 06:52:38.804
A POSSIBLE MEETING ON OR AROUND 
MAY 7 INVOLVING THEN PRESIDENT 

06:52:39.203 --> 06:52:42.655
ELECTS ZELENSKY AND SEVERAL OF 
HIS AIDES  TO DISCUSS HOW TO 

06:52:43.271 --> 06:52:48.744
HANDLE PRESSURE FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND MR. GIULIANI ABOUT 

06:52:48.956 --> 06:52:53.357
INVESTIGATING THE BIDENS?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL SUCH A 

06:52:53.539 --> 06:52:58.708
MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T RECALL HEARING 

06:52:59.108 --> 06:53:01.247
ABOUT SUCH A MEETING? YOU DON'T 
HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE? 

06:53:01.248 --> 06:53:03.248
&gt;&gt;

06:53:05.408 --> 06:53:07.408
I DON'T HAVE RECORDS OR 
SCHEDULES. RIGHT NOW I DON'T 

06:53:07.442 --> 06:53:11.495
RECALL ANYTHING ABOUT SUCH 
MEETING. -- SUCH A MEETING. WAS 

06:53:12.167 --> 06:53:14.706
THIS AMONG THE UKRAINIANS? 
&gt;&gt; A MEETING AMONG THE 

06:53:14.868 --> 06:53:18.356
UKRAINIANS, WITH PRESIDENT 
ELECTS ZELENSKY, 

06:53:23.276 --> 06:53:25.510
EARLY ON IN HIS PRESIDENCY WAS 
SEVERAL AIDS TO DISCUSS HOW TO 

06:53:26.260 --> 06:53:29.580
HANDLE PRESSURE FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND MR. GIULIANI ABOUT 

06:53:29.781 --> 06:53:32.731
INVESTIGATING THE BIDENS. 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL THAT. 

06:53:32.732 --> 06:53:36.478
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT WAS THE MAY 23 
MEETING, YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW 

06:53:37.229 --> 06:53:42.121
THE PRESIDENT CATEGORIZED 
UKRAINE, WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT 

06:53:42.282 --> 06:53:48.260
UKRAINE, THAT MEETING WAS ON MAY
23, DID YOU EVER HEAR PRESIDENT 

06:53:49.025 --> 06:53:51.025
ZELENSKY 

06:53:52.532 --> 06:53:58.214
RELATE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT YOU, 
ABOUT HOW HE FELT, ABOUT HOW THE

06:53:58.415 --> 06:54:00.247
UNITED STATES VIEWED HIM, 
WHETHER HE WAS BEING TAKEN 

06:54:00.248 --> 06:54:03.043
SERIOUSLY OR ANY CONCERNS ABOUT 
BEING USED AS A TOOL FOR LEGAL 

06:54:03.202 --> 06:54:07.565
REASONS? 
&gt;&gt; I SAW THAT IN AN EMAIL FROM 

06:54:08.315 --> 06:54:10.315
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR. WE OBVIOUSLY 
TRIED TO

06:54:15.485 --> 06:54:17.317
RELATE TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY THE
GLASS HALF-FULL VERSION ABOUT 

06:54:17.318 --> 06:54:19.318
HOW THE 

06:54:25.029 --> 06:54:26.657
UNITED STATES FELT ABOUT 
UKRAINE, NOT THE GLASS 

06:54:26.658 --> 06:54:28.894
HALF-EMPTY VERSION, WE ARE HERE 
FOR YOU, TO SUPPORT YOU, AND WE 

06:54:29.092 --> 06:54:31.648
ARE TRYING HARD TO GET YOU THE 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

06:54:31.649 --> 06:54:33.649
&gt;&gt;

06:54:36.812 --> 06:54:38.812
SO AFTER HEARING IT FROM 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU TRIED TO 

06:54:38.845 --> 06:54:40.839
REASSURE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY THAT
AMERICA WAS TRULY ON THEIR SIDE?

06:54:40.840 --> 06:54:43.514
&gt;&gt; WE WERE TRYING TO ASSURE HIM 
THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE  TERM AS A

06:54:43.715 --> 06:54:44.932
PRESIDENT. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR, I KNOW YOU SAID 

06:54:44.933 --> 06:54:47.916
YOU DON'T QUITE REMEMBER EXACTLY
WHEN YOU CAME TO THE REALIZATION

06:54:48.074 --> 06:54:54.485
THAT BURISMA ASHLEY MEANT 
BIDENS, BUT BACK ON MAY 6  WHEN 

06:54:54.685 --> 06:54:57.277
ASKED ABOUT A NEWS REPORT ABOUT 
THE ROLE OF FORMER VICE 

06:54:57.494 --> 06:54:59.494
PRESIDENT

06:55:02.819 --> 06:55:05.052
, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD FOXNEWS 
THAT IT WAS, I QUOTE, A MAJOR 

06:55:05.253 --> 06:55:10.122
SCANDAL, A MAJOR PROBLEM. THE 
NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT 

06:55:10.536 --> 06:55:12.536
RUDY GIULIANI PLANNED TO TRAVEL 
TO UKRAINE,",

06:55:20.901 --> 06:55:22.926
SHORTLY TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY TO URGE HIM TO PURSUE 

06:55:23.126 --> 06:55:25.126
THE 2016 ELECTION AND THE 
INVOLVEMENT OF HUNTER BIDEN IN 

06:55:25.158 --> 06:55:27.393
BURISMA.  ARE YOU SAYING THAT 
YOU DID NOT REALIZE AT THAT 

06:55:27.593 --> 06:55:29.593
TIME, ON MAY 9 OF THIS YEAR,

06:55:34.501 --> 06:55:36.533
THAT MR. GIULIANI WANTED TO URGE
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO PURSUE THE

06:55:36.733 --> 06:55:39.180
2016 ELECTION AND THE 
INVOLVEMENT  OF HUNTER BIDEN IN 

06:55:39.919 --> 06:55:42.833
BURISMA? 
&gt;&gt;  I DID NOT KNOW THAT, BUT I 

06:55:43.594 --> 06:55:45.594
DO NOW. 
&gt;&gt;

06:55:47.905 --> 06:55:49.939
AND YOU DID NOT PAY ANY 
ATTENTION OR MUCH ATTENTION AT 

06:55:50.140 --> 06:55:52.574
ALL TO ANY OF THE NUMEROUS NEWS 
REPORTS OF THE PERSON YOU WERE 

06:55:52.775 --> 06:55:54.775
DIRECTED BY THE PRESIDENT TO 
WORK WITH

06:55:58.473 --> 06:56:00.495
, WHEN HE WAS ON TELEVISION, 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN TALKING 

06:56:00.706 --> 06:56:02.706
ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN AND CHARISMA 
--

06:56:10.043 --> 06:56:11.017
BURISMA? 
&gt;&gt; NO, I DID NOT. 

06:56:11.018 --> 06:56:13.018
&gt;&gt; IN A TEXT FROM AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR, YOU SAID SOMETHING TO 

06:56:13.093 --> 06:56:16.758
THE EFFECT THAT  ARE WE NOW 
SAYING THAT IT IS TIED TO 

06:56:16.958 --> 06:56:18.958
INVESTIGATIONS, AND YOU TEXTED 
BACK, CALL ME. YOU HAD A 

06:56:18.977 --> 06:56:22.241
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 

06:56:22.441 --> 06:56:26.709
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT 
THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO. DO YOU

06:56:26.909 --> 06:56:30.560
KNOW WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO SAY 
THAT? YOU ASKED HIM WHAT YOU 

06:56:30.760 --> 06:56:35.847
WANT, AND HE GOES DIRECTLY TO, 
THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO, AS 

06:56:36.046 --> 06:56:40.116
OPPOSED TO A LIST OF THINGS HE 
WANTED, WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO USE

06:56:40.315 --> 06:56:41.891
THAT TERM? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO CLUE. 

06:56:41.892 --> 06:56:43.892
&gt;&gt; DID YOU DISCUSS YOUR

06:56:47.015 --> 06:56:49.015
TEXT FROM AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE HE MADE 

06:56:49.250 --> 06:56:51.430
THAT STATEMENT? 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT, OPENED A VERY OPEN

06:56:51.598 --> 06:56:53.598
STATEMENT

06:56:56.352 --> 06:56:58.117
-- QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; THERE OTHER CONVERSATIONS YOU

06:56:58.118 --> 06:57:02.252
CAN RECALL BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
HAVE YOUR NOTES OR YOUR 

06:57:02.451 --> 06:57:05.902
DOCUMENTS OR YOUR EMAILS, OR 
OTHER INFORMATION, BUT YOU 

06:57:06.104 --> 06:57:08.104
REMEMBER THAT CALL SPECIFICALLY,
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 

06:57:08.495 --> 06:57:12.001
TO YOU IN RESPONSE TO YOUR 
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT, 

06:57:12.201 --> 06:57:14.996
WHY IS THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I REMEMBER THE FIRST GIRL I 

06:57:15.158 --> 06:57:18.996
KISSED. 
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WON'T SAY THAT. 

06:57:18.997 --> 06:57:23.268
&gt;&gt; I REMEMBERED THAT 
CONVERSATION BECAUSE AS I SAID,

06:57:30.481 --> 06:57:31.892
IT WAS A PRETTY INTENSE, SHORT 
CONVERSATION. 

06:57:31.893 --> 06:57:33.732
&gt;&gt; TELL ME ABOUT THE 
CONVERSATION YOU HAD AT THE 

06:57:33.733 --> 06:57:35.765
RESTAURANT THAT WAS OVERHEARD BY
MR. HOLMES, BECAUSE THAT WAS A 

06:57:35.968 --> 06:57:39.419
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT.
TELL ME ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION 

06:57:39.618 --> 06:57:41.825
WITH THE PRESIDENT, WHAT WAS 
SAID ON THE PHONE? 

06:57:41.826 --> 06:57:43.826
&gt;&gt;

06:57:48.152 --> 06:57:50.184
I DON'T REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS, 
I'M BEING GUIDED BY WHAT MR. 

06:57:50.385 --> 06:57:52.419
HOLMES TESTIFIED TO, I SAID I 
DID NOT DISPUTE THE BASIC 

06:57:52.618 --> 06:57:54.618
SUBJECT OF THE CONVERSATION, WE 
WERE TALKING PRIMARILY ABOUT A 

06:57:54.652 --> 06:57:57.828
SEPARATE ROCKY -- ASAP ROCKY

06:58:06.227 --> 06:58:08.875
,  AND HE MIGHT'VE BROUGHT UP, 
HOW DID IT GO WITH ZELENSKY, IS 

06:58:09.077 --> 06:58:10.908
HE GOING TO DO THE 
INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH WE HAD 

06:58:10.909 --> 06:58:12.948
BEEN TALKING ABOUT,  ALTHOUGH I 
DISPUTE MR. HOLMES AND HIS 

06:58:13.141 --> 06:58:14.721
CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT I SAID 
AFTERWARD. 

06:58:14.722 --> 06:58:20.661
&gt;&gt; THINK AMBASSADOR, I YIELD 
BACK. -- THANK YOU AMBASSADOR, I

06:58:21.424 --> 06:58:25.560
YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; MR. KRISNAMURTHI

06:58:30.805 --> 06:58:32.034
. 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT SAID I WANT 

06:58:32.035 --> 06:58:36.708
NOTHING, I DON'T WANT A QUID PRO
QUO. I PRESUME ON THE SEPTEMBER 

06:58:36.907 --> 06:58:38.942
9 CONVERSATION THE PRESIDENT DID
NOT MENTION THAT WAS THE SAME 

06:58:39.141 --> 06:58:42.189
DAY THAT WE LAUNCHED A 
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO

06:58:42.390 --> 06:58:44.390
WHETHER THERE WAS A QUID PRO 
QUO,

06:58:48.278 --> 06:58:50.511
DID HE SAY THAT TO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT TODAY, BUT WE 

06:58:50.711 --> 06:58:52.101
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT 
THAT. 

06:58:52.102 --> 06:58:54.102
&gt;&gt; AND I PRESUME HE ALSO DIDN'T 
MENTION THE

06:59:00.882 --> 06:59:02.882
WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT THAT 
ALLEGED THERE WAS A QUID PRO QUO

06:59:02.904 --> 06:59:03.917
THAT DAY? 
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT. 

06:59:03.918 --> 06:59:05.918
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T RULE OUT THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE REASON HE 

06:59:05.952 --> 06:59:07.952
STARTED TALKING THAT WAY ON THAT
DAYS BECAUSE OF THE 

06:59:07.984 --> 06:59:09.720
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T RULE THAT OUT. 

06:59:09.721 --> 06:59:14.240
&gt;&gt; THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT
ZELENSKY WAS ON MAY 20? 

06:59:14.241 --> 06:59:17.533
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  YOU ATTENDED WITH SENATOR 

06:59:17.733 --> 06:59:23.017
JOHNSON, SECRETARY PERRY AND 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN AND 

06:59:23.216 --> 06:59:23.894
OTHERS RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

06:59:23.895 --> 06:59:25.895
&gt;&gt; VICE PRESIDENT PENCE

06:59:28.298 --> 06:59:29.479
WAS GOING TO ORIGINALLY ATTEND 
THAT? 

06:59:29.480 --> 06:59:31.551
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SO. 
&gt;&gt; WE LEARN FROM JENNIFER 

06:59:31.752 --> 06:59:34.184
WILLIAMS, THE PRESIDENT'S 
DIRECTION, MAY 13, THAT THE VICE

06:59:34.385 --> 06:59:38.651
PRESIDENT NOT ATTEND, SHE SAID 
THAT ACCORDING TO THE VICE 

06:59:38.853 --> 06:59:42.516
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF, THE 
PRESIDENT DETERMINED THAT THE 

06:59:42.717 --> 06:59:44.717
VICE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT GO.

06:59:48.606 --> 06:59:50.639
DO YOU KNOW WHY THE VICE 
PRESIDENT DID NOT ATTEND THE 

06:59:50.840 --> 06:59:51.621
INAUGURATION? 
&gt;&gt; NO CLUE. 

06:59:51.622 --> 06:59:54.091
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO POINT TO A NEW YORK
TIMES ARTICLE LAST WEEK THAT 

06:59:54.839 --> 07:00:00.688
SAID THAT LEV PARNAS'S ATTORNEY,
YOU'VE READ ABOUT HIM? 

07:00:00.689 --> 07:00:04.619
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'VE READ RECENTLY. 
&gt;&gt; RECENTLY INDICTED.

07:00:09.529 --> 07:00:11.711
THE INCOMING GOVERNMENT, 
ZELENSKY, IT HAD TO ANNOUNCE AN 

07:00:15.828 --> 07:00:17.457
INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMPS 
POLITICAL RIVAL, JOE BIDEN AND 

07:00:17.458 --> 07:00:21.311
HIS SON, ORIOLES VICE PRESIDENT 
MIKE PENCE WOULD NOT ATTEND THE 

07:00:21.511 --> 07:00:23.545
SWEARING IN OF THE NEW PRESIDENT
AND THE UNITED STATES WOULD 

07:00:24.295 --> 07:00:30.452
FREEZE AID. DID THE VICE 
PRESIDENT NOT ATTEND POSSIBLY 

07:00:30.654 --> 07:00:32.249
BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION HAD 
NOT BEEN INITIATED YET? 

07:00:32.250 --> 07:00:35.693
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA. 
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T RULE IT OUT? 

07:00:35.694 --> 07:00:39.750
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO BASIS FOR RULING 
IT OUT HOWEVER, CORRECT? 

07:00:39.751 --> 07:00:41.751
&gt;&gt; ALL I KNOW

07:00:45.690 --> 07:00:47.690
IS THAT THE LEADER OF THE 
DELEGATION WAS SECRETARY PERRY, 

07:00:47.723 --> 07:00:49.723
WHO INVITED ME ALONG. 
&gt;&gt; INTERESTINGLY, AMBASSADOR 

07:00:49.857 --> 07:00:51.857
SONDLAND,

07:00:53.408 --> 07:00:55.228
SINCE YOU CAME FORWARD, OTHERS 
HAVE TRIED TO DISTANCE 

07:00:55.229 --> 07:00:58.490
THEMSELVES FROM YOU. ON OCTOBER 
14, RUDY GIULIANI TOLD THE 

07:00:58.691 --> 07:01:05.596
WASHINGTON POST THAT SONDLAND 
QUOTE, SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE,",

07:01:05.796 --> 07:01:11.229
OF THE EFFORT TO GET UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS TO PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE 

07:01:11.390 --> 07:01:13.390
INVESTIGATIONS.

07:01:16.155 --> 07:01:17.333
OF COURSE THAT IS FALSE, 
CORRECT? 

07:01:17.334 --> 07:01:19.334
&gt;&gt; IF I'D BEEN IN CHARGE, I 
WOULD'VE ASKED PRESIDENT TRUMP 

07:01:19.406 --> 07:01:21.406
TO HAVE THE MEETING WITHOUT

07:01:25.707 --> 07:01:27.690
PRECONDITIONS AND IT WOULD HAVE 
OCCURRED A LONG TIME AGO. 

07:01:27.691 --> 07:01:29.691
&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, THE 
PRESIDENT IS THE ONE WHO WANTED 

07:01:29.758 --> 07:01:31.758
THESE INVESTIGATIONS, THAT WE'VE
LEARNED LATER ON IN READING THE 

07:01:31.792 --> 07:01:33.792
JULY 25 CALLED

07:01:38.711 --> 07:01:40.334
TRANSCRIPT, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT, AS CONVEYED 

07:01:40.335 --> 07:01:41.521
THROUGH MR. GIULIANI, WANTED THE
INVESTIGATIONS. 

07:01:41.522 --> 07:01:44.396
&gt;&gt; TIM MORRISON SAID YESTERDAY, 
AND IN THE DEPOSITION, 

07:01:45.156 --> 07:01:49.573
DISPARAGED YOU, TOO. HE CALLED 
YOU THE GORDON PROBLEM. 

07:01:49.574 --> 07:01:52.971
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MY WIFE CALLS ME.
&gt;&gt; [ LAUGHTER ]

07:01:52.972 --> 07:01:54.841
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THEY ARE TALKING. [ 
LAUGHTER ]

07:01:54.842 --> 07:01:56.842
&gt;&gt;

07:01:58.815 --> 07:02:01.050
SHOULD I BE WORRIED? 
&gt;&gt; MAY BE. [ LAUGHTER ] ON 

07:02:01.809 --> 07:02:03.809
OCTOBER 8, OF THIS YEAR,

07:02:08.569 --> 07:02:10.802
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THAT YOU 
ARE A REALLY GOOD MAN AND A 

07:02:11.559 --> 07:02:14.589
GREAT AMERICAN. AND OF COURSE ON
NOVEMBER 8, ONE MONTH LATER, HE 

07:02:14.749 --> 07:02:16.388
SAID, I HARDLY KNOW THE 
GENTLEMAN. 

07:02:16.389 --> 07:02:20.662
&gt;&gt; EASY COME, EASY GO. [ 
LAUGHTER ] 

07:02:20.663 --> 07:02:27.656
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU
ARE PART OF THE THREE AMIGOS, 

07:02:28.058 --> 07:02:31.725
BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT, 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, IS THAT THE

07:02:31.923 --> 07:02:34.104
PRESIDENT AND THE GOOD FOLKS 
OVER HERE, MY REPUBLICAN 

07:02:34.268 --> 07:02:36.268
COLLEAGUES, ARE NOW

07:02:42.689 --> 07:02:45.124
TESTING YOU AS THE ONE AMIGO, 
THE ONE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO 

07:02:45.328 --> 07:02:47.328
THROW UNDER THE BUS. THE TRUTH 
IS

07:02:52.027 --> 07:02:54.059
, AS YOU SAID IN THE OPENING 
STATEMENT, THE SUGGESTION THAT 

07:02:54.258 --> 07:02:56.707
YOU WERE ENGAGED IN SOME ROGUE 
DIPLOMACY OR IRREGULAR CHANNEL 

07:02:57.465 --> 07:02:59.465
OF DIPLOMACY

07:03:01.778 --> 07:03:03.367
IS QUOTE UNQUOTE, ABSOLUTELY 
FALSE, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 

07:03:03.368 --> 07:03:06.244
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESUMPTION THAT MILITARY

07:03:06.458 --> 07:03:09.091
AID WAS CONDITIONED ON 
INVESTIGATIONS WAS BASED ON MICK

07:03:09.853 --> 07:03:14.188
MULVANEY'S STATEMENT THAT WAS ON
THE VIDEO, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 

07:03:14.345 --> 07:03:16.345
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT

07:03:21.488 --> 07:03:23.725
AT THAT TIME OF HIS STATEMENT. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU WOULD STAND BY THE 

07:03:23.929 --> 07:03:25.957
PRESUMPTION THAT YOU HAD BASED 
ON WHAT YOU KNOW NOW CORRECT? 

07:03:26.115 --> 07:03:28.115
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU TOLD ANDRE 

07:03:28.586 --> 07:03:30.586
YERMACH

07:03:33.259 --> 07:03:35.198
, BEING CONDITIONED ON 
INVESTIGATIONS, YOU TOLD 

07:03:35.199 --> 07:03:39.518
MORRISON WHAT YOU TOLD HIM, AND 
MORRISON DID NOT TRY TO DISPUTE 

07:03:39.692 --> 07:03:41.692
YOUR

07:03:44.842 --> 07:03:46.259
PRESUMPTION, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL HIM DISPUTING 

07:03:46.260 --> 07:03:49.055
IT, I THINK I WENT RIGHT OVER TO
HIM AND REPEATED THE 

07:03:49.218 --> 07:03:50.941
CONVERSATION. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TOLD VICE PRESIDENT 

07:03:50.942 --> 07:03:52.720
PENCE YOUR CONCERNS, HE DID NOT 
DISPUTED AS WELL? 

07:03:52.721 --> 07:03:54.721
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T RESPOND, HE JUST 
LISTENED.

07:03:57.442 --> 07:04:01.913
&gt;&gt; AND SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL.

07:04:01.914 --> 07:04:08.783
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THAT CONCLUDES THE
MEMBER QUESTIONING, MR. NUNES

07:04:16.334 --> 07:04:18.967
, DO YOU HAVE CLOSING REMARKS? 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU NEED TO GET ON THE

07:04:19.168 --> 07:04:21.001
PLANE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
INDULGENCE. ONCE AGAIN THE 

07:04:21.002 --> 07:04:23.002
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN 
ANOTHER FAILURE OF THEIR 

07:04:23.142 --> 07:04:27.500
PREPOSTEROUS CONSPIRACY THEORY, 
THAT IS IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE 

07:04:27.703 --> 07:04:30.137
BETWEEN NOW AND OUR NEXT 
HEARING, WHICH IS IN A FEW 

07:04:30.339 --> 07:04:33.481
HOURS, OR IN ANOTHER HOUR OR SO,
AND IT KEEPS CHANGING EVERY DAY,

07:04:34.203 --> 07:04:40.445
THE CLAIM, AMBASSADOR, THAT YOU 
HAD A IRREGULAR CHANNEL, A DRUG 

07:04:40.608 --> 07:04:48.625
DEAL, NOW SUPPOSEDLY YOU ARE ONE
AMIGO, ON THE SIDE OF THE AISLE.

07:04:48.785 --> 07:04:54.261
&gt;&gt; LOST MY AMIGOS. 
&gt;&gt; NOT FROM US. NO BRIBES GIVEN 

07:04:54.418 --> 07:04:56.418
TO

07:05:00.410 --> 07:05:02.410
THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, THAT YOU 
GAVE, OR TO THE UKRAINIAN 

07:05:02.440 --> 07:05:06.024
PRESIDENT, YOUR CODE CONSPIRATOR
--

07:05:10.974 --> 07:05:12.793
CO-CONSPIRATOR, KURT VOLKER, I 
FIND IT TROUBLING HOW THE 

07:05:12.794 --> 07:05:16.244
DEMOCRATS AND THEIR 
COLLABORATORS IN THE PRESS HAVE 

07:05:16.457 --> 07:05:19.494
BEEN ABLE TO VILIFY AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK

07:05:19.709 --> 07:05:25.729
ON THESE MATTERS IN UKRAINE, AND
LIKE YOU, A

07:05:30.264 --> 07:05:32.299
IRREGULAR CHANNEL, AND NO AMOUNT
OF STORYTELLING BY THE LEFT AND 

07:05:32.499 --> 07:05:36.967
THE MEMBERS ON THE DAIS WILL 
CHANGE THAT. IT WAS THE 

07:05:37.730 --> 07:05:39.730
IRREGULAR CHANNEL.

07:05:41.434 --> 07:05:43.434
FAR FROM COMPELLING, CONCLUSIVE,
ZERO EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THE 

07:05:43.468 --> 07:05:45.794
CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN ALLEGED. 
AND IN FACT, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND

07:05:46.855 --> 07:05:51.187
PRESUMED THAT THE TEMPORARY 
POSITIVE MILITARY AID WAS 

07:05:51.387 --> 07:05:53.387
CONDITIONED ON UKRAINE'S

07:05:56.673 --> 07:05:58.508
CARRYING OUT OF INVESTIGATIONS 
THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE DESPERATE

07:05:58.509 --> 07:06:00.509
TO PORTRAY AS NEFARIOUS.

07:06:03.177 --> 07:06:05.208
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE, AS IS THEIR 
CUSTOM, SEIZED ON A PRESUMPTION 

07:06:05.408 --> 07:06:08.245
IMPROVE THEY CAN USE IT AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENT. HOWEVER, 

07:06:08.446 --> 07:06:11.294
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND TESTIFIED IN
HIS DEPOSITION THAT WHEN HE 

07:06:11.494 --> 07:06:15.558
ASKED PRESIDENT TRUMP WHAT DO 
YOU WANT FROM UKRAINE, PRESIDENT

07:06:16.308 --> 07:06:19.920
TRUMP REPLIED, I WANT NOTHING, 
THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO.

07:06:24.908 --> 07:06:27.143
LET ME REPEAT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID I WANT NOTHING, THERE IS NO

07:06:27.346 --> 07:06:31.608
QUID PRO QUO. THIS COMES ON THE 
HEELS OF THE TESTIMONY BY 

07:06:32.368 --> 07:06:38.725
AMBASSADOR VOLKER THAT HE SAW NO
EVIDENCE OF BRIBERY, EXTORTION, 

07:06:39.126 --> 07:06:41.159
QUID PRO QUO OR TREASONOUS 
ACTIONS, WE DIDN'T GET TO ASK 

07:06:41.919 --> 07:06:45.827
HIM ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS 

07:06:46.028 --> 07:06:49.277
ON THE TABLE. THE PRESIDENT'S 
CALL, THEY WANT THE AMERICAN 

07:06:49.479 --> 07:06:52.527
PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IS ONE 
DEMOCRAT ON THE COMMITTEE PUT 

07:06:52.728 --> 07:06:54.728
IT, THAT HEARSAY

07:06:57.409 --> 07:07:00.659
IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR DIRECT 
EVIDENCE, AND MR. RATCLIFF LAID 

07:07:00.860 --> 07:07:02.891
OUT THE DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT WE 
HAVE FROM YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. 

07:07:03.092 --> 07:07:07.760
NOTHING WE HAVE HEARD 
ESTABLISHES A CLAIM THAT THE 

07:07:07.975 --> 07:07:11.626
PRESIDENT ACTED IMPROPERLY IN 
HIS DEALINGS WITH UKRAINE, AND 

07:07:11.826 --> 07:07:13.826
CERTAINLY NOTHING HAS BEEN 
PRESENTED TO SUPPORT ANYTHING 

07:07:14.009 --> 07:07:19.543
NEAR IMPEACHMENT. IN THE 
MEANTIME MR. CHAIR, WE CONTINUE 

07:07:19.743 --> 07:07:25.230
TO HAVE NO ANSWERS TO THE 
QUESTIONS THAT ONLY YOU KNOW. 

07:07:25.647 --> 07:07:27.647
STARTING WITH WHO IS THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER WHO GAVE BIRTH TO 

07:07:28.212 --> 07:07:31.943
THIS HOAX, WHAT WAS THE NATURE 
OF HIS COORDINATION WITH THE 

07:07:32.143 --> 07:07:37.627
DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE. 
SECOND, WHAT IS THE FULL EXTENT 

07:07:37.829 --> 07:07:39.659
OF UKRAINE'S ELECTION MEDDLING 
AGAINST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 

07:07:39.660 --> 07:07:43.312
2016, AND FINALLY WHY DID 
BURISMA  HIGHER HUNTER BIDEN, 

07:07:43.514 --> 07:07:47.983
WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM, THAT 
HIS POSITION IMPACT ANY U.S. 

07:07:48.396 --> 07:07:50.834
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS UNDER THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION? ANOTHER 

07:07:51.033 --> 07:07:57.533
HEARING IN THE BOOKS, AND NO 
ANSWERS TO THREE BASIC MATERIAL 

07:07:57.735 --> 07:08:00.805
ACTUAL QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED 
ANSWERS TO. I YIELD BACK I THINK

07:08:00.985 --> 07:08:02.403
YOU AMBASSADOR.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

07:08:02.404 --> 07:08:07.418
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE -- THANK THE

07:08:11.134 --> 07:08:15.603
MEMBER FOR'S REMARKS. THIS IS A 
SEMINAL MOMENT IN THE 

07:08:15.817 --> 07:08:18.864
INVESTIGATION, THE EVIDENCE YOU 
HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD AS DEEPLY 

07:08:19.064 --> 07:08:21.462
SIGNIFICANT AND TROUBLING. IT 
HAS BEEN A LONG HEARING,

07:08:27.590 --> 07:08:29.590
AND I KNOW AMERICANS WATCHING 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY MAY NOT 

07:08:29.625 --> 07:08:32.059
HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
WATCH ALL OF IT, SO I'M GOING TO

07:08:32.261 --> 07:08:34.494
GO THROUGH A FEW HIGHLIGHTS, I 
WILL TRY TO PARAPHRASE WHAT YOU 

07:08:34.708 --> 07:08:39.173
SAID, I'M GOING TO REFER TO YOUR
OPENING STATEMENT.

07:08:39.174 --> 07:08:41.408
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE UNDERSTOOD IF WE REFUSED 
TO WORK WITH MR. GIULIANI WE 

07:08:41.609 --> 07:08:45.875
WOULD MISS A CHANCE TO WORK WITH
UKRAINE, SO WE FOLLOWED THE 

07:08:46.633 --> 07:08:53.800
PRESIDENT'S ORDERS. MR. 
GIULIANI'S REQUESTS WORRY QUID 

07:08:53.999 --> 07:08:55.999
PRO QUO FOR ARRANGING A WHITE 
HOUSE VISIT FOR PRESIDENT 

07:08:56.593 --> 07:08:58.593
ZELENSKY. 

07:09:02.535 --> 07:09:04.353
MR. GIULIANI DEMANDED THAT 
UKRAINE MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT 

07:09:04.354 --> 07:09:06.354
ANNOUNCING INVESTIGATIONS OF THE
2016 ELECTION, DNC SERVER AND 

07:09:06.747 --> 07:09:10.456
BURISMA.  MR. GIULIANI WAS 
EXPRESSING THE DESIRES OF THE 

07:09:10.656 --> 07:09:16.742
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
AND WE KNEW THAT THESE 

07:09:16.957 --> 07:09:18.957
INVESTIGATIONS WERE IMPORTANT TO
THE PRESIDENT.

07:09:25.275 --> 07:09:27.522
&gt;&gt;&gt; LATER YOU TESTIFIED, I TRIED
DILIGENTLY TO ASK WHY THE AIDE 

07:09:27.723 --> 07:09:31.375
WAS SUSPENDED BUT I NEVER 
RECEIVED A CLEAR ANSWER. IN THE 

07:09:31.776 --> 07:09:33.776
ABSENCE OF ANY CREDIBLE

07:09:40.925 --> 07:09:42.959
EXPLANATION FOR THE SUSPENSION 
OF AID, I LATER CAME TO BELIEVE 

07:09:43.159 --> 07:09:45.192
THAT THE RESUMPTION OF SECURITY 
AID WOULD NOT OCCUR UNTIL THERE 

07:09:45.400 --> 07:09:47.241
WAS A PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM 
UKRAINE COMMITTING TO THE 

07:09:47.242 --> 07:09:49.242
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 2016 
ELECTION AND BURISMA,  AS MR. 

07:09:49.243 --> 07:09:54.739
GIULIANI HAD DEMANDED. I SHARED 
CONCERNS OF THE POTENTIAL QUID 

07:09:54.940 --> 07:10:00.225
PRO QUO REGARDING THE SECURITY 
AID WITH RON JOHNSON, AND ALSO 

07:10:00.427 --> 07:10:05.611
WITH THE UKRAINIANS. SO MUCH FOR
THE UKRAINIANS DIDN'T KNOW

07:10:14.641 --> 07:10:17.078
. YOU CAN HAVE A QUID PRO QUO 
UNLESS THE UKRAINIANS KNOW, AND 

07:10:17.277 --> 07:10:18.906
YOU HAVE TESTIFIED TODAY 
AMBASSADOR, THAT THE UKRAINIANS 

07:10:18.907 --> 07:10:20.907
KNEW. YOU FURTHER TESTIFIED

07:10:23.322 --> 07:10:25.322
,

07:10:28.452 --> 07:10:30.284
MR. GIULIANI EMPHASIZED THAT THE
PRESIDENT WANTED A PUBLIC 

07:10:30.285 --> 07:10:32.285
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT

07:10:38.204 --> 07:10:40.032
ZELENSKY COMMITTING UKRAINE TO 
LOOK INTO CORRUPTION ISSUES, MR.

07:10:40.033 --> 07:10:42.033
GIULIANI SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED 
THE 2016 ELECTION, INCLUDING THE

07:10:43.081 --> 07:10:45.669
DNC SERVER AND BURISMA AS TOPICS
OF IMPORTANCE TO THE PRESIDENT. 

07:10:47.134 --> 07:10:49.483
&gt;&gt;&gt; IN REFERENCE TO THE JULY 10 
MEETING THAT YOU

07:10:53.851 --> 07:10:55.666
ATTENDED, AND THE UKRAINIAN 
DELEGATION, YOU SAID I RECALL 

07:10:55.667 --> 07:10:57.499
MENTIONING THE PREREQUISITE OF 
INVESTIGATIONS BEFORE ANY WHITE 

07:10:57.500 --> 07:10:59.500
HOUSE CALL OR MEETING.

07:11:07.656 --> 07:11:09.656
YOU FURTHER TESTIFIED AGAIN, MR.
GIULIANI'S DEMAND THAT

07:11:14.760 --> 07:11:16.389
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY MAKE A PUBLIC
STATEMENT ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS, 

07:11:16.390 --> 07:11:18.390
AND KNEW THAT THE TOPIC OF 
INVESTIGATIONS WAS IMPORTANT TO 

07:11:18.424 --> 07:11:23.292
PRESIDENT TRUMP . YOU TESTIFIED 
LATER, I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF 

07:11:23.492 --> 07:11:25.492
THIS COMMITTEE HAVE FREQUENTLY 
FRAMED THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES 

07:11:25.527 --> 07:11:27.527
IN THE FORM OF A SIMPLE 
QUESTION,

07:11:32.438 --> 07:11:34.673
WAS THERE A QUID PRO QUO, AND AS
I TESTIFIED PREVIOUSLY WITH 

07:11:34.878 --> 07:11:36.878
REGARD TO THE REQUESTED WHITE 
HOUSE CALL, AND WHITE HOUSE 

07:11:36.909 --> 07:11:38.909
MEETING, THE ANSWER IS YES.

07:11:42.598 --> 07:11:46.049
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE ALL UNDERSTOOD THESE 
PREREQUISITES FOR THE WHITE 

07:11:46.251 --> 07:11:52.290
HOUSE CALL AND MEETING REFLECTED
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DESIRES, AND 

07:11:52.454 --> 07:11:54.454
REQUIREMENTS.

07:12:00.470 --> 07:12:04.322
LATER ON THE SUBJECT OF SECURITY
AID, IN THE ABSENCE OF SECURITY 

07:12:04.533 --> 07:12:11.234
AID FOR THE HOLD, I FOUND THAT 
IT WAS JEOPARDIZED IN 

07:12:11.636 --> 07:12:13.636
PREPARATION FOR THE SEPTEMBER 1 
MEETING

07:12:19.156 --> 07:12:20.988
IN WARSAW, I ASKED SECRETARY 
MIKE POMPEO WHETHER A 

07:12:20.989 --> 07:12:22.578
FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN TRUMP AND ZELENSKY COULD

07:12:22.579 --> 07:12:24.579
HELP  BREAK THE LOGJAM.

07:12:27.276 --> 07:12:30.059
AND THIS IS FROM AN EMAIL THAT 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT REFUSES TO 

07:12:30.218 --> 07:12:34.391
PROVIDE TO US BUT YOU HAVE 
PROVIDED, IT READS, SHOULD WE 

07:12:34.591 --> 07:12:38.568
BLOCK TIME IN WARSAW FOR A SHORT
PULL ASIDE FOR POTUS TO MEET

07:12:45.561 --> 07:12:47.793
ZELENSKY, I WOULD ASK ZELENSKY 
TO LOOK THEM IN THE EYE, THE 

07:12:47.996 --> 07:12:49.996
PRESIDENT, AND TOLD HIM THAT 
ONCE UKRAINE'S NEW JUSTICE FOLKS

07:12:50.025 --> 07:12:52.476
ARE IN PLACE,  THAT HE SHOULD BE
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD PUBLICLY 

07:12:52.676 --> 07:12:54.812
WITH CONFIDENCE ON THOSE ISSUES 
OF IMPORTANCE TO POTUS

07:12:58.357 --> 07:13:01.008
, AND TO THE UNITED STATES, AND 
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BREAK THE 

07:13:01.208 --> 07:13:07.852
LOGJAM. AND SECRETARY MIKE 
POMPEO'S REPLY, YES. NOT WHAT 

07:13:08.009 --> 07:13:12.485
ISSUES? NOT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND?

07:13:17.449 --> 07:13:19.478
BECAUSE SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO 
WAS ON THE JULY 25 PHONE CALL, 

07:13:19.692 --> 07:13:21.926
HE KNEW WHAT ISSUES WERE IN 
HORTON TO POTUS, THERE WERE TWO 

07:13:22.685 --> 07:13:24.685
OF THEM,

07:13:26.395 --> 07:13:28.212
INVESTIGATION INTO 2016 AND THE 
DNC SERVER, AND INVESTIGATIONS 

07:13:28.213 --> 07:13:30.213
INTO THE BIDEN'S.

07:13:33.701 --> 07:13:35.934
BY THE END OF AUGUST, YOU 
TESTIFIED BY POLICE -- BELIEF 

07:13:36.134 --> 07:13:43.609
WAS THAT IF THEY HAD CORRUPTION 
-- INVESTIGATION INTO CORRUPTION

07:13:43.827 --> 07:13:47.718
SPECIFICALLY WITH BURISMA AND 
THE SERVER, THE HOLD WOULD BE 

07:13:47.918 --> 07:13:49.918
LIFTED ON THE AID .

07:13:55.634 --> 07:13:57.634
I MENTIONED TO VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE BEFORE THE MEETINGS WITH 

07:13:57.668 --> 07:13:59.902
UKRAINIANS THAT I HAD CONCERNS 
THAT THE DELAY IN AID HAD BECOME

07:14:00.102 --> 07:14:01.932
TIED TO THE ISSUE OF 
INVESTIGATIONS. AND AS YOU 

07:14:01.933 --> 07:14:05.385
TESTIFIED, HE GAVE YOU NO 
RESPONSE, NOT WHAT ARE YOU 

07:14:05.621 --> 07:14:07.633
TALKING ABOUT, AMBASSADOR, HOW 
COULD THAT BE, HOW DO WE CLEAR 

07:14:07.831 --> 07:14:10.266
THIS UP, HE MERELY NODDED HIS 
HEAD OR TOOK IT IN. AND OF 

07:14:10.466 --> 07:14:14.333
COURSE THE RECORD OF THAT 25th 
CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

07:14:14.934 --> 07:14:19.725
ZELENSKY  WAS IN THE VICE 
PRESIDENTS READING BOOK EARLIER.

07:14:27.123 --> 07:14:29.771
&gt;&gt;&gt; THEN YOU TESTIFIED, MY GOAL 
AT THE TIME WAS TO DO WHAT WAS 

07:14:29.973 --> 07:14:31.993
NECESSARY TO GET THE AID 
RELEASED, TO BREAK THE LOGJAM. I

07:14:32.207 --> 07:14:34.027
BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC 
STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN 

07:14:34.028 --> 07:14:36.028
THAT'S WE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING 
FOR WEEKS WAS ESSENTIAL TO 

07:14:36.063 --> 07:14:38.063
MEETING THAT GOAL.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

07:14:41.143 --> 07:14:46.633
MY COLLEAGUES SEEM TO BELIEVE, 
AND LET ME ADD TO THIS CALL, 

07:14:46.831 --> 07:14:48.831
THAT YOU HAVE CONFIRMED TODAY, 
IN ADDITION TO CLAIMING THERE 

07:14:48.853 --> 07:14:53.731
WAS NO QUID PRO QUO, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ADAMANT THAT 

07:14:54.134 --> 07:14:56.380
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD TO QUOTE,
CLEAR THINGS UP AND DO IT IN 

07:14:57.142 --> 07:15:00.633
PUBLIC . THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE 
CONFIRMED, THAT IS WHAT YOU ALSO

07:15:00.848 --> 07:15:07.134
TOLD AMBASSADOR TAYLOR. SO HE 
WOULD DENY THERE WAS A QUID PRO 

07:15:07.348 --> 07:15:13.032
QUO, BUT ADAMANT THAT ZELENSKY 
HAD TO CLEAR IT UP AND DO IT IN 

07:15:13.789 --> 07:15:19.536
PUBLIC. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I HAVE SAID A LOT OF THINGS 

07:15:19.735 --> 07:15:23.390
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER THE 
YEARS, I HAVE STRONG FEELINGS 

07:15:23.590 --> 07:15:28.059
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP WHICH ARE 
NEITHER HERE NOR THERE, I WILL 

07:15:28.259 --> 07:15:31.723
SEE THIS ON THE PRESIDENT'S 
BEHALF, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT 

07:15:31.924 --> 07:15:34.613
THE PRESIDENT WOULD ALLOW 
HIMSELF TO BE LED BY THE NOSE, 

07:15:34.796 --> 07:15:36.796
RUDY GIULIANI, AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND OR ANYBODY ELSE.

07:15:40.860 --> 07:15:42.891
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS THE 
ONE WHO DECIDED WHETHER A 

07:15:43.093 --> 07:15:45.093
MEETING WOULD HAPPEN, WHETHER 
AID WOULD BE LIFTED, NOT ANYONE 

07:15:45.127 --> 07:15:50.811
WHO WORKED FOR HIM. AND SO THE 
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, WHO WAS 

07:15:51.011 --> 07:15:53.446
REFUSING THE MEETING WITH 
ZELENSKY,  THAT YOU BELIEVE 

07:15:53.660 --> 07:15:58.531
SHOULD TAKE PLACE, AMBASSADOR 
VOLCKER DID, EVERYBODY DID, THE 

07:15:58.733 --> 07:16:03.017
ONLY QUESTION WAS WHEN, WHO WAS 
THE ONE STANDING IN THE WAY? THE

07:16:03.202 --> 07:16:06.184
ONE REFUSING TO TAKE THE 
MEETING? ONLY ONE ANSWER THAT 

07:16:06.346 --> 07:16:10.321
QUESTION, AND IT IS DONALD J 
TRUMP, 45th PRESIDENT OF THE 

07:16:11.081 --> 07:16:13.081
UNITED STATES.

07:16:17.623 --> 07:16:19.855
WHO WAS HOLDING UP THE MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE? WAS IT YOU? NO IT 

07:16:20.057 --> 07:16:21.687
WASN'T, WAS IT AMBASSADOR 
VOLCKER? NO. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 

07:16:21.688 --> 07:16:25.857
NO. WAS IT KENT? NO. SECRETARY 
OF STATE

07:16:30.010 --> 07:16:32.244
MIKE POMPEO? NO. WHO HAD THE 
DECISION TO RELEASE THE AID, ONE

07:16:32.459 --> 07:16:35.388
PERSON, DONALD J TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

07:16:36.924 --> 07:16:41.135
&gt;&gt;&gt; MY COLLEAGUES SEEM TO THINK 
THAT UNLESS THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

07:16:41.293 --> 07:16:43.293
THE

07:16:45.649 --> 07:16:47.681
MAGIC WORDS, I HEREBY BRIBE THE 
UKRAINIANS, THAT THERE IS NO 

07:16:47.896 --> 07:16:49.712
EVIDENCE OF BRIBERY OR HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. BUT 

07:16:49.713 --> 07:16:51.713
LET'S LOOK AT

07:16:57.635 --> 07:16:59.868
THE BEST EVIDENCE OF WHAT IS IN 
THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD, WHAT IS 

07:17:00.082 --> 07:17:02.876
HIS INTENT, THE REASON BEHIND 
THE HOLD ON THE MEETING IN THE 

07:17:03.039 --> 07:17:05.371
AID? LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY, WHAT IS 

07:17:05.565 --> 07:17:07.565
UNDISPUTED ABOUT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY, AND YOU 

07:17:07.600 --> 07:17:11.182
KNOW HOW WE KNOW? NOT BECAUSE OF
WHAT YOU HAVE REPRESENTED OR 

07:17:11.418 --> 07:17:14.860
OTHERS, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
RECORD OF HIS CONVERSATION, WITH

07:17:15.019 --> 07:17:19.582
WHO? THE ONE WHO REALLY MATTERS.
WITH THE OTHER PRESIDENT, 

07:17:20.344 --> 07:17:26.081
ZELENSKY.  THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS.
HE SAYS RUDY VERY MUCH KNOWS 

07:17:26.842 --> 07:17:31.968
WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND HE IS A 
VERY CAPABLE GUY. THIS IS AFTER 

07:17:32.170 --> 07:17:34.170
HE SAID HE WANTS A FAVOR,

07:17:38.868 --> 07:17:41.103
AND HE GOES INTO CROWDSTRIKE, HE
SAYS RUDY VERY MUCH KNOWS WHAT'S

07:17:41.316 --> 07:17:43.550
HAPPENING, A CAPABLE GUY, IF YOU
COULD SPEAK TO HIM, THAT WOULD 

07:17:43.951 --> 07:17:45.951
BE GREAT. THE FORMER AMBASSADOR

07:17:50.655 --> 07:17:53.087
FOR THE UNITED STATES, THE WOMAN
WAS BAD NEWS, THE PEOPLE SHE WAS

07:17:53.303 --> 07:17:55.738
DOING WITH IN UKRAINE WERE BAD 
NEWS, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW 

07:17:55.940 --> 07:17:58.888
THAT THE OTHER THING, THERE IS A
LOT OF TALK ABOUT BIDEN'S SON,

07:18:03.857 --> 07:18:06.292
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO FIND
OUT ABOUT THAT, WHATEVER YOU 

07:18:06.507 --> 07:18:10.360
COULD DO WITH THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. 

07:18:10.761 --> 07:18:12.761
BIDEN WENT AROUND BRAGGING THAT 
HE STOPPED THE PROSECUTION, IF 

07:18:12.795 --> 07:18:14.626
YOU CAN LOOK INTO IT, IT SOUNDS 
HORRIBLE TO ME.

07:18:14.627 --> 07:18:17.622
&gt;&gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS IN THE PRESIDENTS
MIND WHEN HE HAS PLACED THIS 

07:18:17.788 --> 07:18:22.146
OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE HOLD ON 
THE AID WHEN HE REFUSES TO TAKE 

07:18:22.346 --> 07:18:26.814
THE MEETING? WHAT IS ON HIS 
MIND? BIDEN. HE MAKES IT 

07:18:27.571 --> 07:18:29.571
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

07:18:32.906 --> 07:18:36.765
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION 
BETWEEN BURISMA AND BIDEN,  I 

07:18:36.967 --> 07:18:38.967
WOULD LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
JUDGE THE CREDIBILITY OF THAT 

07:18:39.001 --> 07:18:44.030
ANSWER, BUT THERE IS NO MISTAKE 
ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT, DONALD 

07:18:44.190 --> 07:18:50.989
TRUMP, AND THE CALL WITH YOU ON 
AN UNSECURED PHONE, ON AN 

07:18:51.189 --> 07:18:53.369
OUTDOOR TERRACE, IN UKRAINE, 
WHEN HE SAID INVESTIGATION, HE 

07:18:53.529 --> 07:18:58.706
MEANT BIDEN, HE MADE THAT 
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO THE 

07:18:58.907 --> 07:19:00.907
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE THE DAY 
BEFORE.

07:19:05.608 --> 07:19:07.640
THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT MEANT, OR WHETHER HE 

07:19:07.841 --> 07:19:10.477
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HOLDING UP 
THE AID, HE WAS, THE QUESTION 

07:19:10.691 --> 07:19:12.728
ISN'T WHETHER EVERYBODY KNEW IT,
THEY DID, THE QUESTION IS, WHAT 

07:19:12.925 --> 07:19:16.537
ARE WE PREPARED TO DO ABOUT IT? 
IS THERE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY, OR

07:19:20.029 --> 07:19:22.475
ARE WE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT 
THIS IS JUST NOW THE WORLD THAT 

07:19:22.678 --> 07:19:26.526
WE LIVE IN, WHEN A PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES CAN WITHHOLD 

07:19:26.749 --> 07:19:30.794
VITAL MILITARY AID FROM AN ALLY 
AT WAR WITH THE RUSSIANS, 

07:19:30.994 --> 07:19:32.994
FIGHTING OUR FIGHT, TOO,

07:19:36.693 --> 07:19:38.508
TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY AGAINST 
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION, ARE WE 

07:19:38.509 --> 07:19:40.957
PREPARED TO SAY, IN THE WORDS OF
MICK MULVANEY, GET OVER IT? OR 

07:19:41.157 --> 07:19:48.259
GET USED TO IT? WE ARE NOT 
PREPARED TO SAY THAT. WE ARE NOT

07:19:48.474 --> 07:19:52.525
PREPARED TO SAY THAT, AND I 
APPRECIATE AMBASSADOR VOLCKER, 

07:19:52.941 --> 07:19:54.941
AND AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, I 
APPRECIATE

07:20:00.658 --> 07:20:02.691
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE NOT 
OPINED ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 

07:20:02.893 --> 07:20:05.127
SHOULD BE IMPEACHED OR NOT, OR 
WHETHER THE CRIME OF BRIBERY OR 

07:20:05.327 --> 07:20:07.358
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS HAS
BEEN COMMITTED, THAT IS FOR US 

07:20:08.118 --> 07:20:12.226
TO DECIDE, IN CONSULTATION WITH 
OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OUR 

07:20:12.442 --> 07:20:14.472
CONSCIENCE. IT IS FOR US TO 
DECIDE. AND MUCH IS MY 

07:20:14.674 --> 07:20:18.738
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID OTHERWISE, 
THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION FOR

07:20:18.940 --> 07:20:24.426
ANY OF US. AND MUCH IS MY 
COLLEAGUES MIGHT SAY OTHERWISE, 

07:20:24.626 --> 07:20:30.109
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE RELISH.
FOR OVER A YEAR, I RESISTED THIS

07:20:30.308 --> 07:20:33.976
WHOLE IDEA OF GOING DOWN THE 
ROAD TO IMPEACHMENT. BUT IT WAS 

07:20:34.176 --> 07:20:37.627
MADE NECESSARY, AND NOT BY THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER, BUT BY THE 

07:20:37.827 --> 07:20:39.827
ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT.

07:20:42.699 --> 07:20:44.699
I AM CONTINUALLY STRUCK HOW MY 
COLLEAGUES WOULD SUGGEST THAT 

07:20:44.731 --> 07:20:48.142
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT GOT 
CAUGHT, WE SHOULD IGNORE THE 

07:20:48.301 --> 07:20:53.803
FACT THAT HE WAS CONDITIONING 
OFFICIAL ACTS IN ORDER TO GET 

07:20:54.430 --> 07:20:56.430
POLITICAL FAVORS

07:20:57.935 --> 07:21:00.585
, IN ORDER TO GET AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO HIS RIVAL. 

07:21:00.986 --> 07:21:05.814
GETTING CAUGHT IS NO DEFENSE. 
NOT TO A VIOLATION OF THE 

07:21:05.972 --> 07:21:10.534
CONSTITUTION, OR A VIOLATION OF 
HIS OATH OF OFFICE, AND IT 

07:21:10.735 --> 07:21:13.527
CERTAINLY DOESN'T GIVE US A 
REASON TO IGNORE OUR OWN OATH OF

07:21:13.688 --> 07:21:17.532
OFFICE. WE ARE ADJOURNED. 
&gt;&gt; [ APPLAUSE ]

07:21:21.705 --> 07:21:23.705
[ APPLAUSE ]

07:22:35.852 --> 07:22:38.095
&gt;&gt;&gt; A COUPLE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM 
TODAY, THE FIRST ONE IS THE 

07:22:38.280 --> 07:22:40.915
STATEMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT 
GAVE TO AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, 

07:22:41.332 --> 07:22:44.175
WHEN HE ASKED HIM WHAT DOES HE 
WANT FROM UKRAINE, THE PRESIDENT

07:22:44.382 --> 07:22:47.980
WAS AS CLEAR AS HE CAN BE, I 
WANT NOTHING, DO SOMETHING THAT 

07:22:48.142 --> 07:22:54.131
HE CAMPAIGNED ON AND WHAT HE RAN
ON. AS CLEAR AS CAN BE, DIRECT 

07:22:54.333 --> 07:22:56.333
EVIDENCE FROM THE CENTRAL 
FIGURE,

07:22:59.402 --> 07:23:01.434
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES STATING IT AS CLEARLY AND

07:23:01.635 --> 07:23:03.832
PLAINLY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SECOND, IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

07:23:04.000 --> 07:23:07.331
UNDERSTAND, THERE WERE ONLY 14 
DAYS THAT THE UKRAINIANS KNEW 

07:23:07.534 --> 07:23:09.534
THE AID WAS HELD UP,

07:23:13.824 --> 07:23:15.824
ON AUGUST 29 KIA POLITICAL 
ARTICLE, IN THE 14 DAY 

07:23:15.855 --> 07:23:17.685
TIMEFRAME, TO 11 SEPTEMBER, 
THREE KEY INTERACTIONS WITH 

07:23:17.686 --> 07:23:19.686
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE

07:23:24.390 --> 07:23:26.390
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, THE LAST 
ONE WAS BIPARTISAN MEETING FOR 

07:23:26.425 --> 07:23:28.425
PEOPLE FROM THE LEGISLATION

07:23:32.309 --> 07:23:34.356
, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH, IF EVER 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HE 

07:23:34.542 --> 07:23:36.582
WOULD'VE BROUGHT UP THE IDEA 
THAT AID WAS SOMEHOW LINKED TO 

07:23:36.775 --> 07:23:42.060
HIM ANNOUNCING AN INVESTIGATION,
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TIME, 

07:23:42.259 --> 07:23:44.320
SENATOR MURPHY BROUGHT UP 
HIMSELF, AND STILL PRESIDENT 

07:23:44.539 --> 07:23:48.560
ZELENSKY NEVER SAID IN ANY WAY 
THAT THERE WAS AID , THAT AN 

07:23:48.760 --> 07:23:51.207
INVESTIGATION WAS LINKED 
TOGETHER. THOSE ARE THE KEY 

07:23:51.409 --> 07:23:53.409
TAKEAWAYS, EVERYTHING ELSE

07:23:56.079 --> 07:23:57.908
IS AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SURMISING
WHAT SOMEBODY IS THINKING AND 

07:23:57.909 --> 07:24:01.878
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO, ANYTHING THE
DEMOCRATS REGISTER UP, THE FACTS

07:24:06.239 --> 07:24:08.272
HAVE BEEN ON THE PRESIDENT SIDE,
THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED, THE 

07:24:08.474 --> 07:24:13.143
TRANSCRIPT, NO LINKAGE, WE GET 
THE TWO GUYS ON THE CALL, NO 

07:24:13.901 --> 07:24:15.901
PRESSURE, NO

07:24:19.027 --> 07:24:21.058
PUSHING OR LINKAGE, AND THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING, AS WAS POINTED 

07:24:21.272 --> 07:24:27.667
OUT TODAY, INCLUDING 
REPRESENTATIVE STEFANIK

07:24:32.032 --> 07:24:34.066
, NO ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET THE 
MEETING, OR THE AID RELEASED, 

07:24:34.269 --> 07:24:38.336
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.
&gt;&gt; AS EVERY DAY GOES BY, ADAM 

07:24:38.535 --> 07:24:40.714
SCHIFF AND THE DEMOCRATS WISHFUL
THINKING FOR IMPEACHMENT 

07:24:40.870 --> 07:24:46.457
CRUMBLES, THEY HAVE YET TO POINT
TO A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE OF

07:24:46.653 --> 07:24:51.538
HIGH CRIMES OF -- AND 
MISDEMEANORS, BRIBERY, 

07:24:52.305 --> 07:24:57.024
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND TESTIFIED 
THAT THERE WAS NO PRINT -- HE 

07:24:57.223 --> 07:25:01.432
SAID THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO, 
I WANT HIM TO DO WHAT HE RAN ON,

07:25:01.599 --> 07:25:03.836
ANTICORRUPTION. THE FACTS REMAIN
THE SAME,

07:25:07.779 --> 07:25:09.779
UKRAINE RECEIVES THE AID, NO 
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE 

07:25:09.811 --> 07:25:12.363
MEETING, BEFORE THE AID RELEASE,
AND BEFORE

07:25:17.742 --> 07:25:19.761
OR AFTER THE CALL, THE FACTS 
REMAIN THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE 

07:25:19.973 --> 07:25:23.762
PROCESS, DESPITE ADAM SCHIFF 
CONTINUING POLITICAL WISHFUL 

07:25:23.927 --> 07:25:25.927
THINKING. 
&gt;&gt;

07:25:28.496 --> 07:25:30.531
MR. JORDAN, IS IT A COINCIDENCE 
THAT AID WAS RELEASED AFTER 

07:25:31.282 --> 07:25:34.998
CONGRESS BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION,
AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE LEARNED 

07:25:35.198 --> 07:25:37.198
ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER 
COMPLAINT, JUST A COINCIDENCE

07:25:40.082 --> 07:25:41.853
? 
&gt;&gt; THEY GOT RELEASED BECAUSE SO 

07:25:41.854 --> 07:25:45.366
MANY SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
MET WITH ZELENSKY AND SAID THIS 

07:25:45.567 --> 07:25:51.054
NEW GUY , THIS NEW KID IN TOWN 
IS LEGITIMATE, A REAL REFORMER. 

07:25:51.455 --> 07:25:54.504
AND REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED ON 
SEPTEMBER 5, THE SAME DAY THE 

07:25:54.706 --> 07:25:56.885
CENTERS ARE MEETING WITH THEM, 
WHAT HAPPENS IN THEIR 

07:25:57.046 --> 07:26:02.223
PARLIAMENT, THEY START THE 
ANTICORRUPTION COURT, THEY GOT 

07:26:02.424 --> 07:26:04.458
RID OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY FOR 
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, ALL OF 

07:26:04.657 --> 07:26:09.482
THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AND 
REMEMBER, SENATOR JOHNSON CAME 

07:26:09.645 --> 07:26:13.036
BACK, AND THEY TALKED TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND SAID WE REALLY 

07:26:13.195 --> 07:26:16.560
WANT THE AID RELEASED. AND THE 
PRESIDENT DOESN'T,

07:26:20.495 --> 07:26:24.561
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE ALL 
BELIEVED THAT PRESIDENT -- 

07:26:24.762 --> 07:26:26.762
ZELENSKY WAS LEGITIMATE. 
&gt;&gt;

07:26:42.240 --> 07:26:44.240
I AM CONCERNED THAT IT WAS

07:26:48.729 --> 07:26:51.124
359 TIMES IN THE AMBASSADOR'S 
DEPOSITION, I DON'T RECALL, I 

07:26:51.286 --> 07:26:56.458
CONCERNED THAT I'M CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE MOST EXCULPATORY PIECE

07:26:57.209 --> 07:26:59.209
OF EVIDENCE,

07:27:02.346 --> 07:27:04.346
THE STATEMENT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT, HE LIFTED OUT OF HIS 

07:27:04.376 --> 07:27:06.111
OPENING STATEMENT, I'M MORE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

07:27:06.112 --> 07:27:08.112
&gt;&gt;

07:27:09.860 --> 07:27:11.922
DO YOU HAVE NO CONCERN ABOUT THE
VICE PRESIDENT AND OTHER 

07:27:12.095 --> 07:27:15.901
OFFICIALS COMING IN, AND DATA 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE'S 

07:27:16.062 --> 07:27:24.279
CALL. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN SO 
UNFAIR, WHAT ADAM SCHIFF HAS 

07:27:24.482 --> 07:27:29.163
DONE, THE FACT THAT IT WAS LAST 
NIGHT, IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT MR.

07:27:29.361 --> 07:27:33.426
SANDI'S DEPOSITION AND BRING THE
MATERIAL FORWARD, AT 10 PM, OUR 

07:27:33.644 --> 07:27:35.644
LAWYER GOT NOTIFIED,

07:27:38.496 --> 07:27:40.496
WE WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE MR. 
SANDI'S DEPOSITION AVAILABLE TO 

07:27:40.528 --> 07:27:44.793
USE IN THE PROCEEDING, ONE OF 
THE MANY UNFAIR THINGS, YOU KNOW

07:27:45.007 --> 07:27:47.791
IT HAS BEEN UNFAIR, YOU KNOW 
THAT.

07:27:47.792 --> 07:27:49.792
&gt;&gt;

07:27:55.104 --> 07:27:59.228
YOUR WITNESSES? 
&gt;&gt; EYEWITNESSES WERE AMBASSADOR 

07:27:59.427 --> 07:28:05.113
VOLCKER, AND MORRISON, THAT WAS 
A GOOD DAY, MR. VOELKER, THE 

07:28:05.873 --> 07:28:11.001
DEFINITIVE NARRATIVE, YOU SAW 
HOW GOOD HE DID. REMEMBER THEY 

07:28:11.202 --> 07:28:15.068
ARE ALL ADAM SCHIFF'S WITNESSES,
WE WOULD LIKE THREE TO COME IN 

07:28:15.269 --> 07:28:18.622
ON OUR LIST, MORRISON, HALE AND 
VOELKER. 

07:28:18.623 --> 07:28:24.203
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT WITNESS THEY WON'T 
CALL HIS HUNTER BIDEN, EVERY 

07:28:24.407 --> 07:28:28.267
SINGLE WITNESS, IS THERE 
POTENTIAL APPEARANCE OF A 

07:28:28.468 --> 07:28:32.121
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, EVERY 
SINGLE WITNESS HAS SAID YES, 

07:28:32.535 --> 07:28:36.542
INCLUDING AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, 
HUNTER BIDEN AND THE 

07:28:36.704 --> 07:28:41.067
WHISTLEBLOWER FOR CLOSED-DOOR 
DEPOSITION. AND ADAM SCHIFF 

07:28:41.268 --> 07:28:46.552
WON'T CALL THOSE WITNESSES.
&gt;&gt; EVERY WITNESS HAS RAISED 

07:28:46.753 --> 07:28:48.785
CONCERN ABOUT RUDY GIULIANI, 
DON'T YOU HAVE CONCERNS THAT 

07:28:49.546 --> 07:28:51.546
RUDY GIULIANI

07:28:53.652 --> 07:28:55.444
IS PUSHING SOMETHING COUNTER TO 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST? 

07:28:55.445 --> 07:29:00.108
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS AN OFFICIAL CHANNEL,
THE PRESIDENT CAN CHOOSE WHO HE 

07:29:00.271 --> 07:29:06.654
WANTS, FROM THE WITNESSES WHO 
ARE HERE, THEY HAVE YET TO POINT

07:29:06.868 --> 07:29:08.868
TO A SHRED OF EVIDENCE.
&gt;&gt;

07:29:11.735 --> 07:29:13.735
THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. 
&gt;&gt;

07:29:17.420 --> 07:29:19.420
AS AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
TESTIFIED,

07:29:22.503 --> 07:29:24.334
INTO THE ELECTIONS, AND 
SPECIFICALLY SAYING HE DID NOT 

07:29:24.335 --> 07:29:26.335
UNDERSTAND IT WAS

07:29:31.038 --> 07:29:33.421
BIDEN, AND THE ONE INVESTIGATION
WAS DONE UNDER THE OBAMA 

07:29:33.585 --> 07:29:36.309
ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAD 
CONCERNS WITH HUNTER BIDEN 

07:29:36.525 --> 07:29:41.793
SITTING ON THE BOARD. AS WE KNOW
FROM AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH. FOR

07:29:42.007 --> 07:29:45.405
THE SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING,
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 

07:29:45.566 --> 07:29:47.995
INVESTIGATIONS, THE ONE 
INVESTIGATION WAS DONE

07:29:51.546 --> 07:29:56.628
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
&gt;&gt; WHAT EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE, 

07:29:56.828 --> 07:30:01.870
THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE. 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT'S OWN WORDS. 

07:30:01.871 --> 07:30:07.305
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE STRONGEST? 
&gt;&gt; AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT 

07:30:07.481 --> 07:30:12.677
ZELENSKY NEVER ANNOUNCED ANY  
INVESTIGATION. HE SAID TO GET A 

07:30:12.877 --> 07:30:14.877
MEETING, A CALL, THE SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE,

07:30:18.564 --> 07:30:20.564
THE MEETING, THE CALL, SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE WITHOUT AN 

07:30:20.686 --> 07:30:23.187
ANNOUNCEMENT. THAT'S IT RIGHT 
THERE.

07:30:23.188 --> 07:30:30.252
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HELP TO
HAVE THEM TESTIFY TO THE PUBLIC?

07:30:30.253 --> 07:30:35.835
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THEIR CALL. THANK YOU
SO MUCH. 

09:18:46.946 --> 09:18:51.279
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cooper along with others 
learned about the agency 

09:18:51.479 --> 09:18:55.766
meetings in the last two weeks 
of July. At the first meeting on

09:18:56.346 --> 09:19:00.013
July 18, a representative 
relayed that the White House 

09:19:00.211 --> 09:19:04.023
Chief of Staff has conveyed that
the president has concerns about

09:19:04.219 --> 09:19:09.146
Ukraine and the Ukraine security
assistance and that hold had 

09:19:09.347 --> 09:19:12.753
been ordered by the president. 
No explanation was provided.

09:19:17.423 --> 09:19:27.025
&gt;&gt; All of the agencies ADVOCATED
FOR THE LIFTING OF THE HOLDER. 

09:19:27.482 --> 09:19:32.645
AND STILL, NO GOOD EXPLANATION 
OF THE HOLD WAS PROVIDED. WHILE 

09:19:32.865 --> 09:19:37.540
THE SUSPENSION HAD NOT BEEN MADE
PUBLIC, WORD WAS GETTING OUT. 

09:19:37.790 --> 09:19:42.871
THE SPECIAL ADVISOR FOR THE 
UKRAINE ASSOCIATION TESTIFIED 

09:19:43.072 --> 09:19:45.254
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AT A 
DEPOSITION RECEIVED TWO SEPARATE

09:19:45.451 --> 09:19:49.851
CALLS IN JULY OR AUGUST FROM 
OFFICIALS AT THE UKRAINIAN 

09:19:50.534 --> 09:19:53.836
EMBASSY WHO APPROACHED ME 
QUIETLY AND IN CONFIDENCE TO ASK

09:19:54.450 --> 09:20:02.166
ME ABOUT AND OMB HOLD FOR 
UKRAINIAN ASSISTANCE. CROFT WAS 

09:20:02.366 --> 09:20:05.417
SURPRISED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF MY UKRAINIAN COUNTERPART TO 

09:20:05.617 --> 09:20:12.684
DIPLOMATIC CRATE TRASH -- TRADE 
CRAFT. UKRAINIANS WANTED ANSWERS

09:20:12.884 --> 09:20:18.015
, BUT CROFT DID NOT HAVE A GOOD 
RESPONSE. THEN IN LATE AUGUST, 

09:20:18.216 --> 09:20:24.511
COOPER MET WITH WHOM SHE HAD MET
WITH MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. 

09:20:24.913 --> 09:20:30.343
DURING THAT MEETING, THEY WERE 
DISCUSSING THE HOLD ON SECURITY.

09:20:32.226 --> 09:20:38.525
HE SAID HE WOULD COMMIT TO THE 
PROSECUTION AND COOPER 

09:20:38.725 --> 09:20:43.808
UNDERSTOOD THAT IF HIS EFFORT 
WAS SUCCESSFUL, THE HOLD MIGHT 

09:20:44.568 --> 09:20:49.647
BE LIFTED. UNBEKNOWNST TO 
COOPER, NOTHING WAS FORTHCOMING.

09:20:56.350 --> 09:21:00.666
WITH THAT, I NOW RECOGNIZE THE 
RANKING MEMBER. 

09:21:00.667 --> 09:21:05.135
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; AS WE REPUBLICANS HAVE ARGUED

09:21:05.334 --> 09:21:07.334
AT THESE HEARINGS,

09:21:10.217 --> 09:21:12.217
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GETTING 
A SKEWED IMPRESSION OF THESE 

09:21:12.237 --> 09:21:14.068
EVENTS. THAT IS BECAUSE THE 
DEMOCRATS ASSUME FULL AUTHORITY 

09:21:14.069 --> 09:21:16.980
TO CALL WITNESSES AND PROMPTLY 
REJECTED ANY NEW WITNESSES 

09:21:17.679 --> 09:21:20.982
REPUBLICANS REQUESTED. I WOULD 
LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DISCUSS

09:21:21.182 --> 09:21:24.433
A FEW OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE 
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN DEEMED 

09:21:24.634 --> 09:21:26.802
UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO HEAR. THE 

09:21:27.088 --> 09:21:30.730
WHISTLEBLOWER, THE WHISTLEBLOWER
IS THE KEY FIGURE WHO STARTED 

09:21:30.931 --> 09:21:32.931
THIS ENTIRE IMPEACHMENT

09:21:36.414 --> 09:21:38.414
CHARADE BY SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT
THAT RELIED ON SECONDHAND AND 

09:21:38.516 --> 09:21:43.314
THIRDHAND INFORMATION AND MEDIA 
REPORTS. THIS BEGAN A BIZARRE 

09:21:43.528 --> 09:21:49.614
SERIES OF EVENTS ALTHOUGH THE 
COMPLAINT HAD NO INTELLIGENCE 

09:21:50.028 --> 09:21:51.458
COMPONENT WHATSOEVER, THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL ACCEPTED IT 

09:21:51.459 --> 09:21:54.295
AND EVEN CHANGE THE GUIDANCE ON 
THE COMPLAINT FORMS TO ELIMINATE

09:21:54.896 --> 09:21:58.764
THE REQUIREMENT FOR FIRST-HAND 
INFORMATION. IN HIS OFFICE 

09:21:58.963 --> 09:22:04.043
BACKDATED THE FORMS, TO MAKE 
THEM APPEAR AS IF THEY WERE 

09:22:04.244 --> 09:22:07.495
PUBLISHED THE MONTH BEFORE. 
DEMOCRATS THEN TOOK THE 

09:22:07.696 --> 09:22:11.234
EXTREMELY RARE STEPS OF PUSHING 
A WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT INTO 

09:22:11.707 --> 09:22:17.386
THE PUBLIC USING IT AS THE 
CENTERPIECE OF THEIR IMPEACHMENT

09:22:17.577 --> 09:22:23.544
CRUSADE. WE LATER LEARNED THAT 
THE DEMOCRATIC STAFF HAD PRIOR 

09:22:23.744 --> 09:22:25.744
COORDINATION WITH THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER SO THE DEMOCRATS 

09:22:26.127 --> 09:22:28.550
THEMSELVES HAD DENIED IT ON 
NATIONAL

09:22:32.276 --> 09:22:34.276
TELEVISION. FOLLOWING THAT 
REVELATION, DEMOCRATS DID A 

09:22:34.848 --> 09:22:41.157
DRAMATIC ABOUT-FACE AND REJECTED
OUR REQUEST TO HEAR FROM THEM. 

09:22:41.354 --> 09:22:47.654
&gt;&gt; THEN IN A HEARING YESTERDAY, 
THE DEMOCRATS ACCUSED US

09:22:54.613 --> 09:22:59.092
AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE 
IS. ALEXANDER ACTUALLY BROUGHT 

09:22:59.494 --> 09:23:01.494
IS A FORMER OPERATIVE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE 

09:23:01.877 --> 09:23:05.738
WHO WORKED IN WASHINGTON DC IN 
ORDER TO SMEAR HER THE TRUMP 

09:23:05.936 --> 09:23:11.609
CAMPAIGN -- TO SMEAR THE 
CAMPAIGN. SHE MET DIRECTLY WITH 

09:23:12.080 --> 09:23:14.080
THE VIN UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR

09:23:18.993 --> 09:23:20.993
WHO HIMSELF WROTE AN ARTICLE 
CRITICIZING TRUMP DURING THE 

09:23:21.378 --> 09:23:26.311
2016 CAMPAIGN. TO LUPUS 
ACTIVITIES WERE ONE OF SEVERAL 

09:23:26.712 --> 09:23:33.375
ALL OF WHICH WERE AIMED AT THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ONCE YOU 

09:23:33.568 --> 09:23:35.568
UNDERSTAND

09:23:39.510 --> 09:23:44.788
THEY WERE TRYING TO UNDERMINE 
HIS CANDIDACY, YOU CAN 

09:23:44.994 --> 09:23:46.994
UNDERSTAND WHY THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD WANT TO LEARN THE FULL 

09:23:47.020 --> 09:23:50.204
TRUTH ABOUT THESE OPERATIONS AND
WHY HE WOULD BE SKEPTICAL OF 

09:23:50.494 --> 09:23:54.073
UKRAINE. HUNTER BIDEN IS ANOTHER
WITNESS WHO THE

09:23:58.802 --> 09:24:00.802
DEMOCRATS ARE SPARING FROM CROSS
EXAMINATION. THE SECURING OF AN 

09:24:00.929 --> 09:24:05.101
EXTREMELY WELL PLAYING JOB THE 
RECENT, HIGHLIGHTS THE PRECISE 

09:24:05.300 --> 09:24:09.111
CORRUPTION PROBLEM IN UKRAINE 
THAT CONCERNS NOT ONLY PRESIDENT

09:24:09.309 --> 09:24:15.468
TRUMP ABOUT ALL OF THE WITNESSES
WE HAVE INTERVIEWED SO FAR. THE 

09:24:15.668 --> 09:24:18.918
DEMOCRATS HAVE DISMISSED 
QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S ROLE AS 

09:24:19.719 --> 09:24:23.784
CONSPIRACY THEORIES, YET THEY 
ARE TRYING TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT 

09:24:23.998 --> 09:24:27.849
TRUMP FOR HAVING EXPRESSED 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMPANY. IF 

09:24:28.048 --> 09:24:31.715
WE COULD HEAR FROM BIDEN, WE CAN
ASK HIM HOW HE GOT HIS POSITION 

09:24:32.118 --> 09:24:36.182
AND WHAT DID HE DO TO EARN HIS 
LAVISH SALARY AND WHAT LIGHT HE 

09:24:36.383 --> 09:24:42.069
COULD SHED ON CORRUPTION AT THIS
NOTORIOUS COMPANY. BIDEN WOULD 

09:24:42.269 --> 09:24:46.147
MAKE AN INCONVENIENT WITNESS FOR
THE DEMOCRATS, SO THEY HAVE 

09:24:46.349 --> 09:24:51.829
BLOCKED HIS TESTIMONY. AT THESE 
HEARINGS, WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF

09:24:52.024 --> 09:24:56.848
SECONDHAND AND THIRDHAND 
INFORMATION BUT IN THE END, THE 

09:24:57.041 --> 09:25:02.525
ONLY DIRECT ORDER WE HAVE HEARD 
FROM THE PRESIDENT IS IS ORDER

09:25:09.489 --> 09:25:11.489
THAT HE WANTED NOTHING FROM THE 
UKRAINE.

09:25:22.903 --> 09:25:24.746
ASIDE FROM REJECTING OUR 
WITNESSES, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

09:25:24.747 --> 09:25:28.987
TRIED OTHER PETTY TRICKS TO 
SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION. JUST THIS 

09:25:29.200 --> 09:25:34.628
MORNING, THEY CAUGHT A BREAK IN 
THE HEARING THEN FOR THIS 

09:25:34.825 --> 09:25:37.871
HEARING, THEY CANCELED MULTIPLE 
ROUNDS OF INITIAL QUESTIONING 

09:25:38.471 --> 09:25:42.802
THEY HAD WITH AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND AS THEY HAVE HAD WITH 

09:25:43.004 --> 09:25:45.004
ALL OF THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES. 

09:25:54.184 --> 09:25:56.887
WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH THE SMOKE 
AND MIRRORS, YOU SEE THE FACTS 

09:25:57.102 --> 09:26:01.701
OF THIS CASE ARE CLEAR PRESIDENT
TRUMP WAS SKEPTICAL OF FOREIGN 

09:26:01.901 --> 09:26:04.360
AID AND ESPECIALLY A CORRUPT 
COUNTRIES LIKE UKRAINE.

09:26:12.211 --> 09:26:16.115
EVERY HOLD ON UKRAINIAN AID WAS 
LIFTED WITHOUT UKRAINE TAKING 

09:26:16.876 --> 09:26:21.128
ANY STEPS THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY 
BEING BRIBED TO DO.

09:26:28.462 --> 09:26:30.462
&gt;&gt;

09:26:34.200 --> 09:26:36.200
SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE 
DEMOCRATS IMPEACHING THE 

09:26:36.379 --> 09:26:40.223
PRESIDENT FOR? NONE OF US HERE 
REALLY KNOW. THE ACCUSATIONS 

09:26:40.487 --> 09:26:44.291
CHANGE BY THE HOUR. ONCE AGAIN,

09:26:48.618 --> 09:26:54.918

CLOSE AND MOVE ON AND MOVE ON TO

09:26:55.117 --> 09:26:59.327

MR. CHAIRMAN, RANKING MEMBER, 
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE, I

APPEARED TODAY TO PROVIDE FACTS 
AND ANSWER QUESTIONS BASED ON MY

09:29:45.341 --> 09:29:47.341
EXPERIENCE AS THE DEPUTY

09:29:47.720 --> 09:29:49.720
FOR RUSSIA,

09:29:54.888 --> 09:29:56.888
UKRAINE, AND EURASIA. I WOULD 
FIRST LIKE TO DESCRIBE MY 

09:29:56.964 --> 09:29:59.142
BACKGROUND AS WELL AS MY ROLE IN
VANTAGE POINT RELEVANT TO YOUR 

09:29:59.345 --> 09:30:01.375
INQUIRY. I BRING TO MY DAILY 
WORK INTO THIS PROCEEDING MY 

09:30:01.589 --> 09:30:04.023
SENSE OF DUTY TO U.S. NATIONAL 
SECURITY, NOT TO ANY POLITICAL 

09:30:04.226 --> 09:30:08.238
PARTY. I HAVE PROBABLY SERVED TO
DEMOCRATIC INTO REPUBLICAN 

09:30:08.436 --> 09:30:11.942
PRESIDENTS. I ENTERED GOVERNMENT
SERVICE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL 

09:30:12.344 --> 09:30:15.193
MANAGEMENT INTERNSHIP 
COMPETITION 20 THE STATE 

09:30:15.394 --> 09:30:18.844
DEPARTMENT IN 1999 TO WORK ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM AND THE FORMER 

09:30:19.593 --> 09:30:23.471
SOVIET UNION. INSPIRED BY 
WORKING WITH THE U.S. MILITARY 

09:30:23.726 --> 09:30:25.726
ON A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
ROTATIONAL

09:30:29.008 --> 09:30:31.046
ASSIGNMENT, I DECIDED TO ACCEPT 
A CIVIL SERVICE POSITION IN THE 

09:30:31.799 --> 09:30:34.302
POLICY ORGANIZATION OF THE 
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF 

09:30:34.501 --> 09:30:38.080
DEFENSE IN JANUARY 2001 WHERE I 
HAVE REMAINED FOR THE PAST 18 

09:30:38.278 --> 09:30:45.257
YEARS. MY STRONG SENSE OF PRIDE 
IN SERVING MY COUNTRY AND 

09:30:45.458 --> 09:30:47.806
DEDICATION TO MY PENTAGON 
COLLEAGUES WERE CEMENTED IN THE 

09:30:48.008 --> 09:30:51.553
MOMENTS AFTER I FELT THE 
PENTAGON SHAKE BENEATH ME ON 

09:30:51.756 --> 09:30:53.756
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

09:30:57.653 --> 09:30:59.953
THE OFFICE WAS SCHEDULED TO MOVE
INTO THE SECTION OF THE PENTAGON

09:31:00.155 --> 09:31:02.155
THAT WAS DESTROYED IN THE 
ATTACK, BUT A CONSTRUCTION DELAY

09:31:02.174 --> 09:31:04.349
MEANT THAT WE WERE STILL AT OUR 
OLD DESKS IN THE ADJACENT 

09:31:04.549 --> 09:31:06.716
SECTION ON THAT DEVASTATING DAY.
AFTER WE HAD WIPED

09:31:10.850 --> 09:31:13.484
THE BLACK DUST FROM OUR DESKS 
AND TRY TO GET BACK TO WORK, I 

09:31:13.697 --> 09:31:15.697
FOUND MEANING BY VOLUNTEERING TO
WORK ON AFGHANISTAN POLICY AND 

09:31:15.734 --> 09:31:21.313
WOULD GIVE MY NEXT FOUR YEARS TO
THIS MISSION. I LATER HAD THE 

09:31:21.513 --> 09:31:23.294
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE INTO THE 
LEADERSHIP RANKS OF MY 

09:31:23.295 --> 09:31:25.074
ORGANIZATION AND HAVE HAD THE 
PRIVILEGE TO MANAGE ISSUES 

09:31:25.075 --> 09:31:29.740
RANGING FROM DEFENSE STRATEGIC 
PLANNING FOR HOMELAND DEFENSE 

09:31:29.942 --> 09:31:34.410
AND MISSION ASSURANCE. I 
ACCEPTED THE POSITION OF 

09:31:34.610 --> 09:31:38.676
PRINCIPAL DIRECTOR FOR RUSSIA, 
UKRAINE, AND EURASIA IN 2016 AND

09:31:38.877 --> 09:31:41.528
WAS HONORED TO BE APPOINTED 
FORMALLY TO THE POSITION OF 

09:31:41.724 --> 09:31:45.991
DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE IN 2018. IN MY CURRENT 

09:31:46.192 --> 09:31:49.885
ROLE, I WORKED TO ADVANCE U.S. 
NATIONAL SECURITY WITH A FOCUS 

09:31:50.079 --> 09:31:52.432
ON DETERRING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION 
AND BUILDING STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

09:31:54.724 --> 09:31:57.156
WITH THE FRONT-LINE STATES OF 
UKRAINE AND GEORGIA AS WELL AS 

09:31:57.370 --> 09:32:00.621
10 OTHER ALLIES AND PARTNERS 
FROM THE BALKANS TO THE 

09:32:01.382 --> 09:32:05.486
CAUCUSES. STRENGTHENING 
UKRAINE'S CAPACITY TO DEFEND 

09:32:05.687 --> 09:32:08.047
ITSELF AGAINST RUSSIAN 
AGGRESSION IS CENTRAL TO MY 

09:32:08.335 --> 09:32:10.970
TEAM'S MISSION. THE UNITED 
STATES AND OUR ALLIES PROVIDE 

09:32:11.735 --> 09:32:17.028
UKRAINE WITH SECURITY ASSISTANCE
BECAUSE IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL 

09:32:17.224 --> 09:32:19.445
SECURITY INTERESTS TO DETER 
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION

09:32:24.383 --> 09:32:26.214
AROUND THE WORLD. WE ALSO 
PROVIDE SECURITY ASSISTANCE SO 

09:32:26.215 --> 09:32:28.448
THAT UKRAINE CAN NEGOTIATE A 
PEACE WITH RUSSIA FROM A 

09:32:28.648 --> 09:32:32.513
POSITION OF STRENGTH. THE HUMAN 
TOLL CONTINUES TO CLIMB IN THIS 

09:32:33.275 --> 09:32:36.767
ONGOING WAR WITH 14,000 
UKRAINIAN LIVES LOST SINCE 

09:32:36.981 --> 09:32:41.647
RUSSIA'S 2014 INVASION. THESE 
SACRIFICES ARE CONTINUALLY IN MY

09:32:42.410 --> 09:32:46.927
MIND AS I LEAVE EFFORTS TO 
PROVIDE TRAINING INCLUDING 

09:32:47.882 --> 09:32:52.010
DEFENSIVE ASSISTANT TO THE 
UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES. I HAVE 

09:32:52.773 --> 09:32:56.676
ALSO SUPPORTED THE MINISTRY OF 
DEFENSE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE 

09:32:57.437 --> 09:33:01.105
LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF U.S.
INVESTMENTS IN THE 

09:33:01.303 --> 09:33:05.007
TRANSFORMATION OF THE UKRAINIAN 
MILITARY FROM A SOVIET MODEL TO 

09:33:05.295 --> 09:33:07.998
A NATO FORCE. THE NATIONAL 
DEFENSE

09:33:11.510 --> 09:33:13.327
AUTHORIZATION ACT REQUIRES THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO CERTIFY

09:33:13.328 --> 09:33:16.202
DEFENSE REFORM PROGRESS TO 
RELIEVE HALF OF THE SECURITY 

09:33:16.937 --> 09:33:22.905
INITIATIVE OR U.S. AI FUNDS, A 
PROVISION WE FIND VERY HELPFUL. 

09:33:23.101 --> 09:33:28.167
BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ME
AND OTHER KEY THE OF THE 

09:33:28.372 --> 09:33:30.713
ADVISORS, THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE IN CORONATION WITH THE 

09:33:30.918 --> 09:33:32.918
DEPARTMENT OF STATE CERTIFIED

09:33:40.141 --> 09:33:42.939
FOR THE PURPOSES OF DECREASING 
CORRUPTION, INCREASING 

09:33:43.135 --> 09:33:46.790
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND SUSTAINING 
IMPROVEMENT OF COMBAT CAPABILITY

09:33:47.815 --> 09:33:53.502
MERITING OBLIGATION OF THE 
ENTIRE 250 MILLION IN U.S. AI 

09:33:53.696 --> 09:33:57.344
FUNDS. THIS BRINGS ME TO THE 
TOPIC OF TODAY'S PROCEEDING.

09:34:04.925 --> 09:34:06.925
I TESTIFIED ABOUT ALL OF THIS

09:34:11.024 --> 09:34:13.462
AT LENGTH. IN JULY, I BECAME 
AWARE OF A WHOLE BEING PLACED ON

09:34:13.661 --> 09:34:15.639
OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT'S FOREIGN MILITARY 

09:34:15.640 --> 09:34:17.640
FINANCING

09:34:19.760 --> 09:34:26.129
IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS, I HEARD
THAT THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED THE 

09:34:26.327 --> 09:34:31.540
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF 
HIS CONCERNS ABOUT CORRECTIONS 

09:34:32.303 --> 09:34:36.157
IN UKRAINE. LET ME SAY AT THE 
OUTSET, I HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED 

09:34:36.889 --> 09:34:44.740
THIS AND NEVER HEARD DIRECTLY 
ABOUT THIS MATTER. AT A SENIOR 

09:34:44.945 --> 09:34:50.783
LEVEL MEETING I ATTENDED ON JULY
26, AS ALL OTHER MEETINGS ON 

09:34:50.988 --> 09:34:55.307
THIS TOPIC OF WHICH I WAS AWARE,
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY 

09:34:55.599 --> 09:35:00.378
EXPRESSED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR 
RESUMING THE FUNDING AS IN THE 

09:35:00.589 --> 09:35:04.325
U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST.
AT THE JULY 26 MEETING, THERE 

09:35:04.519 --> 09:35:09.875
WAS ALSO A DISCUSSION WERE 
MAKING PROGRESS.

09:35:14.957 --> 09:35:16.957
SUFFICIENT PROGRESS

09:35:24.912 --> 09:35:29.586
WAS MADE. I FELT THAT THE MATTER
WAS PARTICULARLY URGENT

09:35:33.291 --> 09:35:36.488
IN MY UNDER STANDING UP THE 
MONEY WAS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BE

09:35:44.258 --> 09:35:46.415
OBLIGATED BY THE END OF THE 
FISCAL YEAR. IN THE ENSUING 

09:35:46.615 --> 09:35:48.778
WEEKS INTO THE HOLD WAS RELEASED
ON SEPTEMBER 11, I PURSUED THREE

09:35:48.990 --> 09:35:51.721
TRACKS. FIRST, STARTING ON JULY 
31 ON A MEETING, I MADE CLEAR

09:35:55.637 --> 09:35:57.656
IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 
ONCE DOD REACHES THE POINT, IT 

09:35:57.870 --> 09:35:59.870
DOES NOT HAVE

09:36:10.390 --> 09:36:14.854
KNOWN AND NEEDED TO BE A DOD 
REDIRECTED PROGRAMMING ACTION.

09:36:24.675 --> 09:36:26.856
SECOND, I WAS IN COMMUNICATION 
WITH DOD IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY

09:36:33.770 --> 09:36:37.017
. [ CAPTIONERS TRANSITIONING ] 

09:37:38.809 --> 09:37:40.809
&gt;&gt; GIVEN HOW

09:37:45.566 --> 09:37:47.198
CRITICAL THESE FUNDS ARE FOR 
BOLSTERING UKRAINE'S SECURITY 

09:37:47.199 --> 09:37:49.174
AND DETERRING RUSSIA, I 
APPRECIATE THIS CONGRESSIONAL 

09:37:49.175 --> 09:37:51.175
ACTION.

09:37:53.071 --> 09:37:55.071
THAT CONCLUDES MY OPENING 
STATEMENT BUT BEFORE ENTERING 

09:37:55.262 --> 09:37:58.512
YOUR QUESTIONS, THERE IS ONE 
OTHER MATTER I WOULD LIKE TO 

09:37:58.671 --> 09:38:00.671
ADDRESS.

09:38:03.022 --> 09:38:05.022
I TESTIFIED IN A DEPOSITION 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER 

09:38:05.054 --> 09:38:10.752
COMMITTEES ON OCTOBER 23 2019. 
AT THAT TIME, I WAS ASKED 

09:38:10.952 --> 09:38:13.132
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT I KNEW 
ABOUT WHEN THE UKRAINIAN 

09:38:13.357 --> 09:38:17.251
GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE LEARNED 
ABOUT ANY HOLD ON SECURITY 

09:38:18.009 --> 09:38:20.700
ASSISTANCE FUNDS. I ANSWERED 
THOSE QUESTIONS BASED ON MY 

09:38:21.101 --> 09:38:26.187
KNOWLEDGE AT THAT TIME. SINCE MY
DEPOSITION. I HAVE REVIEWED MY 

09:38:26.944 --> 09:38:31.054
CALENDAR AND THE ONLY MEETING 
WHERE I RECALLED A UKRAINIAN 

09:38:31.267 --> 09:38:35.936
OFFICIAL RAISE THE ISSUE WITH ME
IS ON SEPTEMBER FIVE AT THE 

09:38:36.137 --> 09:38:40.202
UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY 
CELEBRATION. I HAVE, HOWEVER, 

09:38:40.403 --> 09:38:44.269
SINCE LEARNED ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUBJECT 

09:38:44.670 --> 09:38:46.670
FROM MY STAFF. PRIOR TO MY 
DEPOSITION TESTIMONY, I VOTED 

09:38:46.702 --> 09:38:49.539
DISCUSSING TESTIMONY WITH 
MEMBERS OF MY STAFF AND ANYONE 

09:38:49.751 --> 09:38:55.648
OTHER THAN MY ATTORNEY TO MAKE 
SURE MY DEPOSITION TESTIMONY WAS

09:38:55.836 --> 09:38:58.226
BASED ON MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. 
MY DEPOSITION TESTIMONY WAS 

09:38:58.388 --> 09:39:00.388
PUBLICLY

09:39:03.159 --> 09:39:05.183
RELEASED ON NOVEMBER 11, 2019. 
MEMBERS OF MY STAFF READ THE 

09:39:05.384 --> 09:39:09.852
TESTIMONY AND HAVE PROVIDED 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ON THE 

09:39:10.053 --> 09:39:14.532
ISSUE OF UKRAINE'S KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE HOLD, WHERE UKRAINE IS 

09:39:14.732 --> 09:39:16.551
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE 
ISSUES WITH THE FLOW OF 

09:39:16.552 --> 09:39:19.000
ASSISTANCE, MY STAFF SHOWED ME 
TWO UNCLASSIFIED EMAILS THAT 

09:39:19.201 --> 09:39:22.651
THEY RECEIVED FROM THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. ONE WAS RECEIVED ON 

09:39:23.412 --> 09:39:29.310

DOES THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY. I 
DID NOT RECEIVE EITHER OF THESE 

09:39:52.650 --> 09:39:55.532
EMAILS. MY STAFF DO NOT RECALL 
INFORMING ME ABOUT THEM AND I DO

09:39:55.696 --> 09:39:57.696

ABOUT A HOLD OR ANY POSSIBLE 
ISSUES WITH THE FLOW OF 

09:40:09.184 --> 09:40:11.184
ASSISTANCE OR WHAT THE STATE 
APARTMENT OFFICIALS MAY HAVE 

09:40:11.418 --> 09:40:14.524
TOLD HIM. MY STAFF ADVISED ME IN
THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE 

09:40:14.694 --> 09:40:17.136
FOLLOWING FACTS THAT MAY BE 
RELEVANT TO THIS INQUIRY. MY 

09:40:17.302 --> 09:40:21.934
STAFF DOESN'T RECALL INFORMING 
ABOUT THEM AND I DO NOT RECALL 

09:40:22.100 --> 09:40:24.100

EMAIL FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
STATING THEY HAD HURT THE SEA 

09:40:32.342 --> 09:40:34.989
AND IS CURRENTLY BEING BLOCKED

09:40:35.147 --> 09:40:37.147
TO THE CONGRESSIONAL 
NOTIFICATION

09:40:42.494 --> 09:40:44.528
FOR UKRAINE SMS. I HAVE NO 
FURTHER INFORMATION. ON JULY 25,

09:40:44.728 --> 09:40:47.575
MEMBER OF MY STAFF GOT A 
QUESTION FOR ME UKRAINE EMBASSY 

09:40:47.776 --> 09:40:52.865
CONTACT ASKING WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH UKRAINE SECURITY 

09:40:53.028 --> 09:40:55.907
ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE, AT THAT 
TIME, WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE 

09:40:56.108 --> 09:40:59.960
GUIDANCE WAS ON USA I, THE OMB 
NOTICE OF APPORTIONMENT ARRIVED 

09:41:00.715 --> 09:41:05.244
THAT DAY BUT THE STAFF MEMBER 
DID NOT FIND OUT ABOUT IT UNTIL 

09:41:05.445 --> 09:41:08.916
LATER. I WAS INFORMED THE STAFF 
MEMBER TOLD THE UKRAINIAN 

09:41:09.110 --> 09:41:11.110
OFFICIALS WE WERE MOVING

09:41:15.396 --> 09:41:17.607
FORWARD ON USA I BUT RECOMMENDED
THAT THEY UKRAINE EMBASSY CHECK 

09:41:17.765 --> 09:41:19.765
IN WITH STATE REGARDING SMS. 
SOMETIME DURING THE WEEK OF 

09:41:19.875 --> 09:41:25.148
AUGUST 6 -10 A UKRAINE EMBASSY 
OFFICER PULLED A MEMBER OF MY 

09:41:25.898 --> 09:41:29.009
STAFF THAT A UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL 
MAY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT 

09:41:29.624 --> 09:41:32.259
SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN AN 
UPCOMING MEETING. MY 

09:41:32.459 --> 09:41:37.543
UNDERSTANDING IS THE ISSUE WAS 
NOT RAISED UP AGAIN, I HAVE NO 

09:41:37.744 --> 09:41:39.374
FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECURITY 

09:41:39.375 --> 09:41:42.625
ASSISTANCE MAY HAVE HAD AT THAT 
TIME. MY STAFF RECALLED THINKING

09:41:42.826 --> 09:41:47.724
THAT YOUR CLEANING WERE AWARE OF
THE HOLD ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE 

09:41:48.464 --> 09:41:50.943
DURING AUGUST BUT THEY CANNOT 
PINPOINT ANY SPECIFIC 

09:41:51.157 --> 09:41:54.407
CONVERSATIONS WHERE CAME UP. MY 
STAFF TOLD ME THEY ARE AWARE OF 

09:41:55.167 --> 09:41:57.167
ADDITIONAL MEETINGS

09:41:59.677 --> 09:42:01.677
WHERE THEY SAW OFFICIALS FROM 
THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY IN AUGUST 

09:42:01.711 --> 09:42:07.407
AND THEY BELIEVE THE QUESTION OF
THE HOLD CAME UP AT SOME POINT. 

09:42:07.809 --> 09:42:10.048
BUT, THEY TOLD ME TO DO NOT FIND
ANY CORRESPONDING EMAILS OR 

09:42:10.243 --> 09:42:12.243
OTHER RECORDS OF THOSE MEETING. 
CONSEQUENTLY, NEITHER THEY NOR I

09:42:12.275 --> 09:42:14.105
KNEW PRECISELY WHEN OR WHAT 
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS MAY HAVE 

09:42:14.106 --> 09:42:17.558
OCCURRED WITH THE UKRAINIAN IN 
THE MONTH OF AUGUST. IF I HAD 

09:42:17.759 --> 09:42:19.804
MORE DETAILS ON THESE MATTERS, I
WOULD OFFER THEM TO THE 

09:42:20.554 --> 09:42:24.258
COMMITTEE NOT THIS IS THE EXTENT
OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I HAVE

09:42:24.459 --> 09:42:28.526
RECEIVED SINCE MY DEPOSITION. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I WELCOME YOUR 

09:42:28.726 --> 09:42:31.522
QUESTIONS. I WILL ANSWER THEM TO
THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. THANK 

09:42:31.677 --> 09:42:34.931
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

09:42:38.476 --> 09:42:40.710
FOR THIS HEARING, WE WILL FORGO 
THE FIRST ROUND OF QUESTIONS BY 

09:42:40.924 --> 09:42:43.708
COUNSEL AND PROCEED TO MEMBER 
QUESTIONS UNDER THE FIVE MINUTE 

09:42:43.868 --> 09:42:47.208
RULE. I DO WANT TO RESPOND TO 
THE COMMENTS OF MY RANKING 

09:42:47.958 --> 09:42:49.958
MEMBER, HOWEVER,

09:42:52.694 --> 09:42:54.694
THAT SUGGESTED THIS IS A 
SURPRISE TO THE MENORAH. WE 

09:42:55.286 --> 09:42:59.810
INFORMED THE MINORITY LAST NIGHT
AFTER OUR HEARING THAT WE WOULD,

09:43:00.011 --> 09:43:02.011
BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE 
TESTIMONY TODAY, WE DO NOT 

09:43:02.044 --> 09:43:04.825
BELIEVE THAT HE STAFF MEMBER WAS
NECESSARY. AND, THE MESSAGE WE 

09:43:04.986 --> 09:43:10.375
GOT BACK FROM THE MINORITY WAS 
OK, GOT IT . THANKS FOR THE 

09:43:10.575 --> 09:43:14.427
HEADS UP. THE MINORITY WAS ON 
NOTICE, IT RAISED NO OBJECTION 

09:43:14.641 --> 09:43:18.194
ABOUT GOING DIRECTLY TO MEMBER 
ROUNDS. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

09:43:21.142 --> 09:43:24.994
THE MERIT HE HAS REPRESENTED WE 
HAVE CALLED - HAVE NOT CALLED 

09:43:25.195 --> 09:43:28.767
MINORITY WITNESSES. THAT IS NOT 
ACCURATE THAT MR. HALE APPEARS 

09:43:28.927 --> 09:43:31.908
TONIGHT IS A MINORITY WITNESS. 
THAT IS NOT HOW YOU CHARACTERIZE

09:43:32.108 --> 09:43:36.976
YOURSELF, MR. HALE. BUT YOUR 
TESTIMONY WAS REQUESTED BY THE 

09:43:37.190 --> 09:43:39.006
MINORITY. LIKEWISE, TWO OF THE 
WITNESSES, AMBASSADOR BROKER AS 

09:43:39.007 --> 09:43:43.837
WELL AS MR. MORRISON WERE BOTH 
MINORITY REQUESTED WITNESSES. 

09:43:43.993 --> 09:43:49.979
NOW, MR. VOLKER, HE TESTIFIED 
THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ANY OF 

09:43:50.178 --> 09:43:52.178
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JOE 
BIDEN. AND, IN RETROSPECT, HE 

09:43:52.214 --> 09:43:56.076
SHOULD'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO IS NOT WAS AN

09:43:56.835 --> 09:43:59.927
INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN WHICH 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED WOULD BE 

09:44:00.692 --> 09:44:03.269
INAPPROPRIATE. AND MR. MORRISON 
GAVE TESTIMONY AS TO 

09:44:03.424 --> 09:44:09.478
CONVERSATIONS THAT HE HAD WITH 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND ABOUT THE 

09:44:09.893 --> 09:44:13.490
CONVERSATIONS THAT HE HAD 
RELAYED TO THE UKRAINIANS ABOUT 

09:44:13.653 --> 09:44:18.363
THE HOLD AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE
BEING A RESULT OF THE FAILURE TO

09:44:18.530 --> 09:44:21.674
SECURE THE INVESTIGATION. I CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY THE MINORITY DOES

09:44:21.874 --> 09:44:24.924
NOT WANT TO CHARACTERIZE THEM AS
MINORITY REQUESTS WERE WITNESSES

09:44:25.125 --> 09:44:29.590
BUT NONETHELESS, THEY WERE 
MINORITY REQUESTED WITNESSES. I 

09:44:29.794 --> 09:44:33.646
RECOGNIZE MYSELF FOR FIVE 
MINUTES. AND, I WANT TO BEGIN BY

09:44:34.414 --> 09:44:36.414
ASKING YOU

09:44:39.942 --> 09:44:42.502
, MISS COOPER, ABOUT WHAT YOU 
JUST INFORMED US OF. I WANT TO 

09:44:42.672 --> 09:44:44.672
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE 
IMPORT OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. 

09:44:44.824 --> 09:44:48.075
AS EARLY AS JULY 25, THE SAME 
DAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE 

09:44:48.833 --> 09:44:53.558
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY ON THE 
PHONE AND ASKED FOR THIS FAVOR, 

09:44:53.758 --> 09:44:56.608
THE SAME DAY THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY THANKED THE UNITED 

09:44:57.364 --> 09:45:00.875
STATES FOR ITS MILITARY SUPPORT 
AND SINGLE DAY WAS READY TO 

09:45:01.087 --> 09:45:05.243
PURCHASE MORE JAVELINS,. ON THAT
DATE, YOU GOT INQUIRIES

09:45:09.193 --> 09:45:11.238
, YOUR STAFF GOT INQUIRIES FROM 
SOMEONE AT THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY

09:45:11.427 --> 09:45:13.258
HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
STATUS OF THE MILITARY 

09:45:13.259 --> 09:45:18.743
ASSISTANCE. IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; SIR, THAT IS CORRECT. I WOULD

09:45:18.944 --> 09:45:20.574
SAY THAT SPECIFICALLY THE 
UKRAINIAN EMBASSY STAFF ASKED 

09:45:20.575 --> 09:45:25.597
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH UKRAINE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE? 

09:45:25.598 --> 09:45:30.125
&gt;&gt; AND, DID THAT CONNOTE YOU 
THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT 

09:45:30.328 --> 09:45:33.372
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON WITH IT? 
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 

09:45:33.373 --> 09:45:37.643
&gt;&gt; AND, YOU RECEIVED YOUR STAFF 
RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE INQUIRY ON

09:45:37.843 --> 09:45:42.510
THAT DATE WHAT WAS THE OTHER, 
WAS THE NATURE THE OTHER AND 

09:45:42.722 --> 09:45:44.722
KAREN JULY 25? 
&gt;&gt; SIR, THAT WAS THE ONE INQUIRY

09:45:44.744 --> 09:45:50.574
TO MY STAFF. BUT, THE OTHER 
POINTS I HAD RAISED WERE EMAILS 

09:45:50.748 --> 09:45:54.187
REFLECTING OUTREACH TO THE STATE
DEPARTMENT. 

09:45:54.188 --> 09:45:56.188
&gt;&gt;

09:45:58.357 --> 09:46:00.190
SO, THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY WAS 
CONTACTING THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

09:46:00.191 --> 09:46:03.840
TO FIND OUT ABOUT ITS PORTION OF
MILITARY ASSISTANCE? 

09:46:03.841 --> 09:46:08.312
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 
&gt;&gt; AND, WAS AT SIMILARLY A 

09:46:08.509 --> 09:46:11.072
CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON 
WITH HER TERRY EIGHT? 

09:46:11.073 --> 09:46:17.243
&gt;&gt; IT WAS SIMILARLY A QUESTION 
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH 

09:46:17.444 --> 09:46:20.291
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; AND, YOUR STAFF OR ONE OF THE

09:46:20.492 --> 09:46:24.757
OTHER DEPARTMENT STAFF ALSO 
HEARD IN AUGUST, IT ADDITIONAL 

09:46:24.958 --> 09:46:28.824
INQUIRIES FROM THE UKRAINIAN 
EMBASSY ABOUT A POTENTIAL HOLD 

09:46:29.025 --> 09:46:33.694
UP IN THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE? 
&gt;&gt; SIR, I WANT TO BE CAREFUL 

09:46:33.908 --> 09:46:35.908
ABOUT HOW I PHRASE THIS. MY 
STAFF RECALLED HAVING HAD 

09:46:36.477 --> 09:46:38.477
MEETINGS WITH

09:46:44.874 --> 09:46:46.092
UKRAINIAN EMBASSY 
REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE MONTH

09:46:46.093 --> 09:46:48.325
OF AUGUST. AND, THEY BELIEVE THE
TOPIC CAME UP AT SOME POINT 

09:46:48.526 --> 09:46:50.560
DURING THOSE MEETINGS. BUT, THEY
DON'T RECALL THE PRECISE DATE OR

09:46:50.762 --> 09:46:52.793
SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE NATURE OF 
THE DISCUSSION WAS. 

09:46:52.794 --> 09:46:56.406
&gt;&gt; BUT, YOUR STAFF AT LEAST 
GLEANED FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS

09:46:56.567 --> 09:47:00.709
THAT TRAINING EMBASSY WAS AWARE 
THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF A 

09:47:00.923 --> 09:47:06.809
HOLD ON THE ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; THE WAY I WOULD PHRASE IT IS 

09:47:07.010 --> 09:47:09.137
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF AN ISSUE.
YES. 

09:47:09.138 --> 09:47:11.138
&gt;&gt;

09:47:13.510 --> 09:47:15.510
YOU ARE NOW, MS. COOPER, THE 
THIRD WITNESS BEFORE COMMITTEE 

09:47:15.543 --> 09:47:18.340
WHO WAS TESTIFIED THAT THE 
UKRAINIANS AND OUT ABOUT THE 

09:47:18.504 --> 09:47:21.162
PROBLEM OR HOLD ON THE SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE PRIOR TO BECOMING 

09:47:21.321 --> 09:47:25.693
PUBLIC. THE FIRST INDICATE THAT 
MAY GO BACK AS EARLY AS THE DATE

09:47:25.907 --> 09:47:29.959
THE PRESIDENT CALLED PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY. LET ME MOVE TO A 

09:47:30.710 --> 09:47:35.443
RELATED ISSUE. IN AUGUST, YOU 
TESTIFIED AT YOUR DEPOSITION, 

09:47:35.657 --> 09:47:37.991
THAT YOU MET WITH KURT VOLKER IN
AUGUST

09:47:41.141 --> 09:47:45.407
, I BELIEVE IT IS AUGUST 20. THE
HOLD ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS 

09:47:45.608 --> 09:47:47.642
STILL IN PLACE. YOU TESTIFIED 
THAT INVESTOR VOLKER TOLD YOU IF

09:47:47.898 --> 09:47:50.485
YOU GET GET ZELENSKY TO MAKE A 
PUBLIC STATEMENT, THAT WOULD 

09:47:50.678 --> 09:47:54.543
QUOTE SOMEHOW DISAVOW ANY 
INTERFERENCE IN U.S. ELECTIONS 

09:47:54.743 --> 09:47:58.807
THAT COMMIT TO THE PROSECUTION 
OF ANY INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN 

09:47:59.008 --> 09:48:00.839
ELECTION INTERFERENCE THOUGHT IT
MIGHT LIFT OLD ON SECURITY 

09:48:00.840 --> 09:48:05.106
ASSISTANCE. IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; SIR, I BELIEVE THAT I 

09:48:05.307 --> 09:48:08.918
TESTIFIED THAT IT WAS MINE 
INFERENCE THAT WIDE THAT THE 

09:48:09.087 --> 09:48:11.087
HOLD

09:48:14.856 --> 09:48:16.474
UKRAINE SECURITY ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS YOUR INFERENCE 

09:48:16.475 --> 09:48:18.544
BECAUSE, AT THE TIME YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE HOLD ON 

09:48:18.708 --> 09:48:20.708
SECURITY ASSISTANCE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. THE FIRST 

09:48:20.942 --> 09:48:23.336
PART OF OUR CONVERSATION WAS 
ABOUT THE HOLD ON SECURITY 

09:48:23.492 --> 09:48:27.173
ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS DURING A PORTION OF 

09:48:27.329 --> 09:48:29.707
THE CONVERSATION THAT HE BROUGHT
UP THE EFFORT TO GET THIS PUBLIC

09:48:30.470 --> 09:48:32.470
STATEMENT? 
&gt;&gt;

09:48:38.008 --> 09:48:40.475
IT WAS DURING THAT CONVERSATION,
NOT SURE I WOULD SAY IT IS 

09:48:40.641 --> 09:48:41.671
DURING THAT PART OF THE 
CONVERSATION. 

09:48:41.672 --> 09:48:43.491
&gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE DID YOU DISCUSS IN 
THE CONVERSATION? 

09:48:43.492 --> 09:48:45.927
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY TWO TOPICS I RECALL 
IS THE URGENCY OF LISTING THE 

09:48:46.143 --> 09:48:48.710
HOLD ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND 
THEN HIM RELAYING THIS EFFORT, 

09:48:48.870 --> 09:48:50.870
THIS

09:48:53.245 --> 09:48:54.873
DIPLOMATIC EFFORT I PREVIOUSLY 
HAD BEEN UNAWARE OF. 

09:48:54.874 --> 09:48:57.461
&gt;&gt; SO, HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
DISCUSSION ABOUT A WHITE HOUSE 

09:48:57.620 --> 09:49:00.760
MEETING? 
&gt;&gt; SIR, I DON'T RECALL 

09:49:00.959 --> 09:49:05.227
SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING BUT I'VE HAD

09:49:05.426 --> 09:49:08.076
MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE 
DESIRE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 

09:49:08.834 --> 09:49:10.834
MEETING SO

09:49:12.540 --> 09:49:14.372
IT IS LIKELY THAT WAS PART OF 
THE CONVERSATION. 

09:49:14.373 --> 09:49:18.639
&gt;&gt; BUT THE TWO THINGS YOU DO 
RECALL ARE THE, YOU TALKED ABOUT

09:49:18.841 --> 09:49:20.872
THE HOLD ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
AND THAT HE BROUGHT UP THIS 

09:49:21.073 --> 09:49:24.085
OUTLOOK STATEMENT THAT THEY 
WANTED ZELENSKY, THAT HE THOUGHT

09:49:26.958 --> 09:49:31.379
MIGHT BE USEFUL? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT, SIR. 

09:49:31.380 --> 09:49:33.777
&gt;&gt; MR. NUNEZ. 
&gt;&gt;

09:49:37.325 --> 09:49:40.780
THANK YOU GENERALLY FOR YIELDING
. AMBASSADOR HALE AND MS. 

09:49:40.941 --> 09:49:46.672
COOPER, THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING 
HERE. IN HIS OPENING, RANKING 

09:49:47.074 --> 09:49:49.507
MEMBER NUNEZ REFERENCE PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S GENERAL SKEPTICISM OF 

09:49:50.256 --> 09:49:52.256
PROVIDING AID IN THE AMOUNT OF

09:49:56.007 --> 09:49:58.396
FOREIGN AID BEING PROVIDED TO 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DO YOU AGREE 

09:49:58.560 --> 09:50:00.164
THAT CHARACTERIZATION, AND BEST 
RACHEL? 

09:50:00.165 --> 09:50:05.969
&gt;&gt; WE'VE OFTEN HEARD AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT THAT THE 

09:50:06.172 --> 09:50:08.201
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOREIGN 

09:50:08.401 --> 09:50:13.270
ASSISTANCE IS REVIEWED TO MAKE 
SURE IT IS IN U.S. NATIONAL 

09:50:13.484 --> 09:50:15.484
INTEREST AND WE EVALUATED 
CONTINUOUSLY SO THAT THEY MEET 

09:50:15.516 --> 09:50:18.351
CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT THE 
PRESENT HAS ESTABLISHED. 

09:50:18.352 --> 09:50:22.619
&gt;&gt; IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LOOKED TO 

09:50:22.820 --> 09:50:24.035
OVERHAUL HOW FOREIGN AID IS 
DISTRIBUTED? 

09:50:24.036 --> 09:50:26.036
&gt;&gt; YES, THE NSC

09:50:29.118 --> 09:50:31.118
LOST A FOREIGN ASSISTANCE REVIEW
PROCESS LATE AUGUST OR EARLY 

09:50:31.708 --> 09:50:34.814
SEPTEMBER, 2010. BACK THROUGH 
OUT HIS CAMPAIGN AND 

09:50:35.015 --> 09:50:39.683
ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS REFRAME AMERICAN FOREIGN 

09:50:39.881 --> 09:50:43.746
POLICY IN ECONOMIC TERMS AS HE 
DESCRIBED AMERICA FIRST.  AND 

09:50:44.147 --> 09:50:45.977
CONSISTENT WITH THAT WELL BEFORE
THERE WAS A WHISTLEBLOWER 

09:50:45.978 --> 09:50:50.657
TALKING ABOUT A PAUSE ON AID TO 
THE UKRAINE, THE PRESIDENT HAD 

09:50:50.857 --> 09:50:52.272
EXPRESSED GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT 
PROVIDING U.S. FOREIGN 

09:50:52.273 --> 09:50:55.323
ASSISTANCE TO THAT POINT. IS IT 
FAIR TO SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

09:50:55.523 --> 09:50:57.523
WANTED TO ENSURE THE AMERICAN 
TEXT PAIR

09:51:00.609 --> 09:51:02.639
, THE MONEY WOULD BE EFFECTIVELY
SPENT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES?

09:51:03.394 --> 09:51:05.394
&gt;&gt; YES.

09:51:11.773 --> 09:51:13.805
THAT IS THE BROAD INTENT OF THE 
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE REVIEW AMONG 

09:51:14.005 --> 09:51:15.436
OTHER GOALS. 
&gt;&gt; HAS THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED 

09:51:15.437 --> 09:51:17.670
HE EXPECT OUR ALLIES TO GIVE 
THEIR FAIR SHARE OF FOREIGN AID 

09:51:17.871 --> 09:51:19.904
AS EVIDENCE BY APPOINTEE RAISED 
DURING THE JULY 25 PHONE CALL 

09:51:20.105 --> 09:51:21.324
WITH RESIDENTS ZELENSKY TO THAT 
EFFECT? 

09:51:21.325 --> 09:51:25.187
&gt;&gt; THE PRINCIPLE OF GREATER 
BURDEN SHARING ABOUT ALLIES IS 

09:51:25.388 --> 09:51:27.004
AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE 
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE REVIEW. 

09:51:27.005 --> 09:51:29.654
&gt;&gt; IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, 
USA IS WITHHELD FROM FOREIGN 

09:51:29.855 --> 09:51:32.691
COUNTRIES FOR NUMBER OF FACTORS?
&gt;&gt; REC.

09:51:32.692 --> 09:51:37.172
&gt;&gt; AND YOU TESTIFIED IN YOUR 
PRIOR TESTIMONY THAT IT IS 

09:51:37.373 --> 09:51:43.458
NORMAL TO HAVE DELAYS ON A. 
&gt;&gt; I MAY HAVE SAID IT THAT WAY 

09:51:44.209 --> 09:51:48.942
BUT CERTAINLY IT IS AN 
OCCURRENCE, IT DOES OCCUR. 

09:51:48.943 --> 09:51:51.390
&gt;&gt; IN THE PAST YEAR, UKRAINE WAS
NOT THE ONLY HUNDRED HAVE EIGHT 

09:51:51.591 --> 09:51:52.806
WITHHELD FROM IT. IS THAT 
CORRECT? 

09:51:52.807 --> 09:51:56.258
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; IN THE PAST YEAR, WAS EIGHT 

09:51:56.458 --> 09:51:58.458
WITHHELD FROM PAKISTAN?

09:52:03.573 --> 09:52:05.404
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 
&gt;&gt; WHY WAS EIGHT WITHHELD FROM 

09:52:05.405 --> 09:52:06.622
PAKISTAN? 
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS OVER 

09:52:06.623 --> 09:52:08.623
THE POLICIES AND BEHAVIOR OF THE
TINY GOVERNMENT

09:52:13.123 --> 09:52:14.953
TOWARDS CERTAIN PROXY GROUPS 
THAT WERE INVOLVED IN CONFLICT 

09:52:14.954 --> 09:52:16.975
WITH THE UNITED STATES. 
&gt;&gt; IN THE PAST YEAR, WAS EIGHT 

09:52:17.189 --> 09:52:19.007
WITHHELD FROM HONDURAS? 
&gt;&gt; EIGHT WAS WITHHELD FROM THE 

09:52:19.008 --> 09:52:20.942
THREE STATES IN NORTHERN, 
CENTRAL AMERICA. YES. 

09:52:20.943 --> 09:52:24.905
&gt;&gt; LAST YEAR WAS EIGHT WITHHELD 
FROM LEBANON? 

09:52:24.906 --> 09:52:26.906
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 
&gt;&gt; ONE

09:52:30.390 --> 09:52:32.423
AID WAS FIRST WITHHELD FROM 
LEBANON, WERE YOU GIVEN A REASON

09:52:32.623 --> 09:52:33.851
WHY IT WAS WITHHELD? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

09:52:33.852 --> 09:52:37.851
&gt;&gt; SO, HAVING NO EXPLANATION WHY
AID IS BEING WITHHELD IS NOT IN 

09:52:38.007 --> 09:52:42.172
COMMON? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY IT IS NOT THE 

09:52:42.372 --> 09:52:47.038
NORMAL WAY THAT WE FUNCTION. 
&gt;&gt; BUT, IT DOES HAPPEN? 

09:52:47.039 --> 09:52:49.273
&gt;&gt; IT DOES HAPPEN. 
&gt;&gt; IS IT TRUE WHEN IT WAS BEING 

09:52:50.037 --> 09:52:53.340
WITHHELD FROM LEBANON, THAT WAS 
AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT IS 

09:52:53.540 --> 09:52:54.956
BEING WITHHELD FROM UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 

09:52:54.957 --> 09:52:57.964
&gt;&gt; AND, YOU TESTIFIED THAT THE 
AID TO LEBANON STILL HASN'T BEEN

09:52:58.134 --> 09:53:00.134
RELEASED

09:53:01.874 --> 09:53:03.491
. IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

09:53:03.492 --> 09:53:06.491
&gt;&gt; BUT THE EIGHT TO THE UK AND 
WAS RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 11. 

09:53:06.648 --> 09:53:07.758
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

09:53:07.759 --> 09:53:10.193
&gt;&gt; IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT AID 
HAD BEEN WITHHELD FROM SEVERAL 

09:53:10.407 --> 09:53:15.476
COUNTRIES ACROSS THE GLOBE FOR 
VARIOUS REASONS AND IN SOME 

09:53:15.676 --> 09:53:17.923
CASES FOR REASONS THAT ARE STILL
UNKNOWN JUST IN THE PAST YEAR. 

09:53:18.525 --> 09:53:21.130
&gt;&gt; CORRECT, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; SO, THE ASSERTION HAS BEEN 

09:53:21.711 --> 09:53:24.210
MADE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
UKRAINE POLICY CHANGED WHEN 

09:53:24.409 --> 09:53:32.141
THERE WAS A PAUSE IN THE AID, 
WHERE THE AID WAS WITHHELD. IS 

09:53:32.341 --> 09:53:37.424
THAT AN ACCURATE STATEMENT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT THE WAY I 

09:53:37.624 --> 09:53:39.624
UNDERSTOOD THINGS HAPPENING AT 
THE TIME

09:53:42.290 --> 09:53:43.707
. WE ARE NOT GIVEN AN 
EXPLANATION. 

09:53:43.708 --> 09:53:46.603
&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF OUR POLICY, IN 
TERMS OF A TO THE UKRAINE, YOU 

09:53:46.761 --> 09:53:48.598
DESCRIBE IS VERY ROBUST. 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

09:53:48.599 --> 09:53:52.575
&gt;&gt; AS EVIDENCE BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP POLICY DECISION TO PROVIDE

09:53:54.476 --> 09:53:57.726
LETHAL DEFENSIVE WEAPONS. 
JAVELIN MISSILES. 

09:53:57.727 --> 09:54:03.623
&gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY ROBUST. YES SIR. 
AND THAT WAS THE DECISION THAT 

09:54:03.825 --> 09:54:07.274
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THAT, THE 
PRIOR ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT 

09:54:07.474 --> 09:54:12.757
OBAMA HAD NOT DONE. LETHAL 
WEAPONS AND NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO

09:54:12.956 --> 09:54:14.389
THE UKRAINE IN THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, CORRECT? 

09:54:14.390 --> 09:54:16.390
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN 
UKRAINIAN AFFAIRS

09:54:23.527 --> 09:54:25.527
DURING THE OBAMA AND THE 
DECISION SO I DON'T FEEL 

09:54:25.561 --> 09:54:27.594
COMPETENT TO ADDRESS THAT. 
&gt;&gt; WIN A TO THE HURRICANE WAS 

09:54:27.794 --> 09:54:29.826
PUT ON PAUSE, I BELIEVE YOU 
TESTIFIED THAT THERE MAY BEEN 

09:54:30.026 --> 09:54:32.026
CONCERNED BY SECRETARY KENT AND 
BY AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT WAS 

09:54:32.059 --> 09:54:33.676
CONTRIBUTING TO A POTENTIALLY 
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON U.S.-UKRAINE 

09:54:33.677 --> 09:54:36.030
RELATIONS. YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
&gt;&gt;

09:54:41.192 --> 09:54:43.192
WELL, THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
POSITION WAS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE

09:54:43.226 --> 09:54:45.874
CONTINUATION OF THAT ASSISTANCE 
AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT, THE KEY

09:54:46.075 --> 09:54:50.944
ELEMENT OF OUR STRATEGY TO 
SUPPORT UKRAINE AGAINST RUSSIA. 

09:54:51.358 --> 09:54:53.750
&gt;&gt; MY TIME HAS EXPIRED THAT I 
YIELD BACK. 

09:54:53.751 --> 09:55:01.306
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. I'M 
DELIGHTED TO FOLLOW MR. 

09:55:01.507 --> 09:55:05.774
RADCLIFFE BUT HE JUST PERFECTLY 
SUMMARIZED THE DEFENSE THAT MY 

09:55:05.975 --> 09:55:09.227
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ARE 
MOUNTING OF THIS BEHAVIOR. THE 

09:55:09.428 --> 09:55:13.293
DEFENSE GOES LIKE THIS. THE 
PRESIDENT IS ACTING ON DEEP, 

09:55:14.052 --> 09:55:17.304
HISTORICAL CONCERNED, APPARENTLY
INVISIBLE CONCERNS ABOUT 

09:55:17.467 --> 09:55:22.841
CORRUPTION AND, BECAUSE HE IS SO
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION IN 

09:55:23.604 --> 09:55:26.653
THE UKRAINE, HE IS HOLDING UP 
AID AND BEING PRUDENT AND 

09:55:26.867 --> 09:55:29.902
JUDICIOUS. THE FIRST PART OF 
THAT IS PRETTY EASY TO DISPOSE 

09:55:30.069 --> 09:55:32.791
OF THE CAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT CORRUPTION 

09:55:32.992 --> 09:55:37.673
IN THE UKRAINE. IN FACT, IN THE 
TWO CONVERSATIONS HE HAD WITH 

09:55:37.874 --> 09:55:43.356
THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE ON 
APRIL 21 AND JULY 25, NOT ONCE 

09:55:43.757 --> 09:55:46.554
DOES THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES USE THE WORD OR MENTION 

09:55:46.716 --> 09:55:48.843
CORRUPTION. THE SECOND PART OF 
THAT IS A LITTLE MORE 

09:55:49.042 --> 09:55:51.891
INTERESTING. HE'S JUST BEING 
PRUDENT IN HOLDING UP A. THAT IS

09:55:52.092 --> 09:55:54.092
NOT JUST WRONG. IT IS ILLEGAL.

09:55:57.573 --> 09:56:00.336
BECAUSE, MS. COOPER, I WANT YOU 
TO HELP US WALK THROUGH THIS.

09:56:04.074 --> 09:56:06.074
SINCE THE IMPOUNDMENT CONTROL 
ACT OF 1974, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

09:56:06.107 --> 09:56:08.107
NOT HAD THE AUTHORITY TO

09:56:13.209 --> 09:56:15.858
ON A WHIM, OR OUT OF PRUDENCE OR
AS MY REPUBLICANS SAY, A GENERAL

09:56:16.059 --> 09:56:18.059
SKEPTICISM OF FOREIGN AID TO 
STOP FOREIGN AID. MS. COOPER, 

09:56:18.652 --> 09:56:21.542
UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION, IT IS 
THE CONGRESS AND NOT THE PRESENT

09:56:21.749 --> 09:56:23.171
CONTROLS THE POWER OF THE PURSE.
CORRECT? 

09:56:23.172 --> 09:56:25.172
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. THE SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE, THE ASSISTANCE THAT 

09:56:25.192 --> 09:56:27.439
WAS AUTHORIZED TO UKRAINE WAS 
AUTHORIZED PARIS BY THE 

09:56:28.202 --> 09:56:30.202
CONGRESS, CORRECT?

09:56:33.525 --> 09:56:35.155
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 
&gt;&gt; CONGRESS IS CONCERNED ABOUT 

09:56:35.156 --> 09:56:36.975
CORRUPTION. HE WANTS TO ENSURE 
THAT AMERICAN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE

09:56:36.976 --> 09:56:41.443
IS SPENT WISELY AND DOES NOT 
WORSEN CORRUPTION. AND SO WHEN 

09:56:41.644 --> 09:56:43.644
CONGRESS AUTHORIZED THIS MONEY, 
IT BUILT IN CONDITIONS JUST AS 

09:56:43.677 --> 09:56:48.759
ESTHER RED CLIFF SUGGESTED. BY 
LAW, THE UKRAINE AND GET ALL THE

09:56:48.959 --> 09:56:50.959
MONEY UNTIL IT DEMONSTRATED THAT
IT UNDERTAKING

09:56:55.672 --> 09:56:57.089
SUBSTANTIAL ANTICORRUPTION 
REFORMS. MS. COOPER, UNDER THE 

09:56:57.090 --> 09:56:59.090
LAW, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
WORKS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

09:56:59.123 --> 09:57:01.123
AND OTHER AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH 
ANTI-CORRUPTION BENCHMARKS AND 

09:57:01.304 --> 09:57:05.822
DETERMINE WHETHER UKRAINE HAS 
MEANT THOSE BENCHMARKS. CORRECT?

09:57:06.035 --> 09:57:10.090
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. THAT 
PROVISION ATTAINS TO THE 

09:57:10.291 --> 09:57:13.286
SECURITY ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A LEGALLY SPECIFIED 

09:57:13.443 --> 09:57:17.665
PROCESS. THAT IS NOT THE 
PRESIDENT IN THE OVER OFFICE 

09:57:18.005 --> 09:57:20.005
MANUFACTURING A GENERAL 
SKEPTICISM OF FOREIGN AID. 

09:57:20.200 --> 09:57:22.200
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt;

09:57:23.902 --> 09:57:26.034
IT IS A CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED
PROCESS. YES SIR. 

09:57:26.035 --> 09:57:28.769
&gt;&gt; DID THE PROCESS TAKE PLACE 
FOR THE DOD FUNDING THAT WAS 

09:57:28.983 --> 09:57:30.983
CALLED UP IN JULY? 
&gt;&gt;

09:57:34.050 --> 09:57:36.050
THERE IS A PROCESS THAT TOOK 
PLACE FOR THE CERTIFICATION, 

09:57:36.083 --> 09:57:38.083
TOOK PLACE PRIOR TO

09:57:41.566 --> 09:57:42.997
THE MAY CERTIFICATION TO THE 
U.S. CONGRESS. 

09:57:42.998 --> 09:57:45.232
&gt;&gt; SO, RIGHT. NOTE ONLY DID IT 
TAKE PLACE BEFORE, AS REQUIRED 

09:57:45.990 --> 09:57:50.302
BY LAW, BUT MONTHS BEFORE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROZE THE MONEY,

09:57:50.517 --> 09:57:56.399
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN 
CONSULTATION WITH STATE SENT A 

09:57:56.600 --> 09:57:58.626
LETTER TO CONGRESS CERTIFYING 
AND YOU SAID THIS IN YOUR 

09:57:59.000 --> 09:58:00.465
OPENING STATEMENT. THE 
GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE HAS TAKEN 

09:58:00.466 --> 09:58:02.466
SUBSTANTIAL ACTIONS TO MAKE 
DEFENSE

09:58:08.785 --> 09:58:10.214
INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS FOR THE 
PURPOSES OF DECREASING 

09:58:10.215 --> 09:58:11.431
CORRUPTION AND INCREASING 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUSTAINING 

09:58:11.432 --> 09:58:13.368
IMPROVEMENTS OF COMBAT 
CAPABILITY ENABLED BY USE 

09:58:13.369 --> 09:58:16.516
ASSISTANCE. SO, BY THE TIME 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROZE THE AID, 

09:58:16.716 --> 09:58:20.982
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAD 
SPENT WEEKS, IF NOT MONTHS, 

09:58:21.383 --> 09:58:24.137
DETERMINING THAT THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT MET EVERY REQUIREMENT

09:58:24.451 --> 09:58:29.049
IN THE LAW AND MADE SIGNIFICANT 
STRIDES IN COMBATING CORRUPTION.

09:58:29.715 --> 09:58:35.599
IS THAT CORRECT? THAT IS 
CORRECT. ME MADE THAT 

09:58:36.015 --> 09:58:37.632
DETERMINATION AND MADE. 
&gt;&gt;  THIS WASN'T ABOUT 

09:58:37.633 --> 09:58:43.116
CORRUPTION.  THE TIMELINE PROVES
IT. WHEN IN FACT, IF THERE IS 

09:58:43.317 --> 09:58:45.349
ANY DOUBT ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING 
ON HERE. THE CHAIRMAN REFERRED 

09:58:45.564 --> 09:58:49.551
TO YOUR INFERENCE FROM THE 
CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR 

09:58:49.761 --> 09:58:51.945
FULCHER THAT IF THE UKRAINE MADE
A STATEMENT

09:58:58.350 --> 09:59:00.180
TO MEETING TO THE 
INVESTIGATIONS, THE AID WOULD BE

09:59:00.181 --> 09:59:02.417
LIFTED. YOU COVER THAT WITH THE 
CHAIRMAN. THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE

09:59:02.619 --> 09:59:05.668
THE PRESS CONFERENCE OF OCTOBER 
17, WHEN MICK MULVANEY LET THE 

09:59:05.870 --> 09:59:08.301
CAT FULLY OUT OF THE BAG. HE 
REVEALED PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK TO

09:59:08.518 --> 09:59:10.518
HIM ABOUT AND I QUOTE

09:59:13.785 --> 09:59:15.616
MICK MULVANEY HERE, THE 
CORRECTION RELATED TO THE DNC 

09:59:15.617 --> 09:59:18.264
SERVER AND ADMITTED THAT QUOTE, 
THAT IS WHY WE HELD UP THE 

09:59:18.465 --> 09:59:22.118
MONEY. ANY OTHER EXPLANATION FOR
THE HOLD IS A FARCE. NOW, IN MY 

09:59:22.319 --> 09:59:24.965
REMAINING 30 SECONDS. JUST SO 
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT I 

09:59:25.724 --> 09:59:31.869
REFER TO. RICHARD NIXON DECIDED,
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD A GENERAL

09:59:32.629 --> 09:59:34.829
SKEPTICISM OF FOREIGN AID, 
RICHARD NIXON DECIDED TO HOLD UP

09:59:35.466 --> 09:59:39.741
CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED AID AND
AS A RESULT, CONGRESS WENT TO 

09:59:39.903 --> 09:59:44.118
WORK AND PASS THE IMPOUNDMENT 
CONTROL ACT OF 1974 WHICH 

09:59:44.280 --> 09:59:46.280
PROHIBITED THE PRESIDENT FROM 
WITHHOLDING

09:59:49.536 --> 09:59:50.966
CONGRESSIONALLY APPROPRIATED 
FUNDS WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF 

09:59:50.967 --> 09:59:57.050
CONGRESS FOR ANY REASON. IS THAT
CORRECT, MS. COOPER? 

09:59:57.051 --> 09:59:59.223
&gt;&gt; SIR, I'M NOT A LAWYER BUT 
THAT APPROXIMATE

10:00:04.780 --> 10:00:06.399
MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
PROVISION OF THE IMPOUNDING. 

10:00:06.400 --> 10:00:08.833
&gt;&gt; I WILL GO WITH THAT. THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH. I YIELD MY 

10:00:09.052 --> 10:00:10.050
BALANCE OF THE TIME. 
&gt;&gt; 

10:00:10.051 --> 10:00:12.296
&gt;&gt; AS FAR HARVEY SAID, HERE'S 
THE REST OF THE STORY. MY 

10:00:12.497 --> 10:00:18.132
COLLEAGUE FAILED TO PUT RESPECT 
TO THE CERTAIN ISSUES THAT DOD 

10:00:18.290 --> 10:00:21.130
CERTIFICATION, IT WAS NARROWLY 
FOCUSED ON

10:00:24.883 --> 10:00:26.883
DEFENSE INSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND
COMBAT CAPABILITY. IS THAT 

10:00:26.913 --> 10:00:31.180
CORRECT? THAT'S CORRECT, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THAT. MY 

10:00:31.379 --> 10:00:35.045
COLLEAGUES SEEM TO ME THAT OUT. 
HE READ IT WHEN YOU READ YOUR 

10:00:35.245 --> 10:00:38.201
STATEMENT BUT HE LEFT OFF THE 
CORRECTED EMPHASIS.

10:00:43.774 --> 10:00:45.605
CERTIFICATION IN MAY DIDN'T 
REALLY SPEAK TO THE BROADER 

10:00:45.606 --> 10:00:47.606
CONCEPT OF CORRUPTION THROUGHOUT
THE REST OF UKRAINE THAT THE 

10:00:47.899 --> 10:00:49.455
PRESIDENT WE'VE BE FAMILIAR 
WITH. 

10:00:49.456 --> 10:00:52.664
&gt;&gt; SIR, THE MAY CERTIFICATION 
WAS SPECIFIC TO THE DEFENSE 

10:00:53.067 --> 10:00:59.017
VECTOR, THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY AND
IT DID REFERENCE THE IMPORTANCE 

10:00:59.217 --> 10:01:01.396
OF CIVILIAN CONTROL OF THE 
MILITARY WHICH RELATES MORE 

10:01:01.561 --> 10:01:05.458
BROADLY TO - 
&gt;&gt; NONE OF US WILL ARGUE THAT 

10:01:05.616 --> 10:01:10.859
THAT DEMONSTRATES CORRUPTION. 
MS. COOPER, MAYBE YOU CAN SHED 

10:01:11.014 --> 10:01:14.198
LIGHT ON DETAILS. WE TALKED 
ABOUT THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE 

10:01:14.357 --> 10:01:18.713
PROGRAM, 250 MILLION, SOME WOULD
ARGUE THAT BECAUSE THE PAUSE, 

10:01:19.476 --> 10:01:25.416
PEOPLE DIED IN AUGUST BECAUSE OF
THE PAUSE. CAN YOU HELP US 

10:01:25.616 --> 10:01:27.976
UNDERSTAND WHAT OBLIGATED AND 
WAS THERE THINGS THAT WERE ABOUT

10:01:32.320 --> 10:01:34.350
TO BE DELIVERED TO THE UKRAINE? 
WAS UKRAINE OUT OF AMMUNITION? 

10:01:34.553 --> 10:01:36.797
WAS IT OUT OF JAVELINS? BECAUSE 
OF THIS PAUSE, THEY DIDN'T GET 

10:01:36.997 --> 10:01:39.833
CERTAIN LEGAL EQUIPMENT THEY 
NEEDED IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR

10:01:40.048 --> 10:01:41.824
FOLKS DURING THE MONTH OF 
AUGUST? 

10:01:41.825 --> 10:01:45.934
&gt;&gt; SIR, WE WILL DELIVER ALL OF 
THE - 

10:01:45.935 --> 10:01:48.367
&gt;&gt; I WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I'M 
TRYING TO GET A TIMELINE. 

10:01:48.368 --> 10:01:51.617
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO SHORTFALL IN 
EQUIPMENT DELIVERY THAT WERE 

10:01:51.818 --> 10:01:54.466
EXPECTED WITHIN THAT TIMEFRAME. 
OBLIGATE MEANS YOU'RE PUTTING 

10:01:54.666 --> 10:01:56.666
THE FUNDING ON CONTRACT

10:02:01.781 --> 10:02:02.582
.  
&gt;&gt; OK. 

10:02:02.583 --> 10:02:04.617
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE STARTING THE PROCESS.
&gt;&gt; THOSE CONTRACTS WILL BE 

10:02:04.818 --> 10:02:06.649
FULFILLED 4th QUARTER PERHAPS  
OR WHATEVER IT WAS? 

10:02:06.650 --> 10:02:09.899
&gt;&gt; SIR, I HAVE TO SAY I'M A 
POLICY OFFICIAL. I'M NOT A 

10:02:10.099 --> 10:02:12.948
CONTRACTING EXPERT. I, MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE WILL BE

10:02:13.711 --> 10:02:18.176
ABLE TO ACHE UP FOR LOST TIME IN
THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. 

10:02:18.177 --> 10:02:22.304
&gt;&gt; FANTASTIC. YOU GO THROUGH 
THREE OR FOUR STEPS BECAUSE YOU 

10:02:22.497 --> 10:02:25.132
DISAGREE WITH THE WHOLE BEING 
PLACED ON THE ASSISTANCE. AND, 

10:02:25.332 --> 10:02:29.800
CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH THAT. DID
YOU GET ANY KIND OF CRITICISM 

10:02:30.014 --> 10:02:32.605
FROM THE FOLKS YOU DEAL WITH 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING AGAINST THE

10:02:35.083 --> 10:02:37.519
DIRECTION TO PUT A HOLD ON THAT?
DID YOU GET CRITICIZED AT ALL 

10:02:37.732 --> 10:02:40.166
FOR THAT? 
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY NOT. THE ENTIRE 

10:02:40.567 --> 10:02:44.833
CHAIN OF COMMAND WAS SUPPORTIVE 
OF ADVOCATING OR REMOVING THE 

10:02:45.048 --> 10:02:47.067
HOLES ON THE FUNDS. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE RESTRICTED ON THE

10:02:47.282 --> 10:02:49.423
FULL THROATED ADVOCATING BEHALF 
OF GETTING THIS HOLD LIFTED

10:02:52.766 --> 10:02:54.583
,  WERE YOU? 
&gt;&gt; NO SIR. NO RESTRICTIONS. 

10:02:54.584 --> 10:02:59.865
&gt;&gt; OK.  WELL, THANK YOU FOR 
THAT. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE 

10:03:00.278 --> 10:03:02.460
MORE IN TOUCH WITH ACTUAL 
SPECIFICS OF THE ACCOUNTING 

10:03:02.620 --> 10:03:05.560
PROCESS. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR 
BEING HERE TONIGHT. I YIELD 

10:03:06.319 --> 10:03:10.426
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

10:03:11.176 --> 10:03:13.176
AMBASSADOR HALE,

10:03:16.774 --> 10:03:18.959
WHERE DID YOU ACTUALLY FIND OUT 
ABOUT THE HOLD ON THE UKRAINE 

10:03:19.160 --> 10:03:23.382
ASSISTANCE? WAS IT JULY 21? 
&gt;&gt; YES. IN THE DEPOSITION THAT I

10:03:23.545 --> 10:03:28.865
DID, I MISSPOKE. I WAS CONFUSED 
AND I CONFUSED JUNE 20 FORCED 

10:03:29.020 --> 10:03:36.640
WHICH STATE SENT THE CN TO THE 
COMMERCIAL NOTIFICATION FOR OMB 

10:03:36.840 --> 10:03:40.691
CLEARANCE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY 
AFTER JULY 18 AND THE 21st IS 

10:03:40.904 --> 10:03:43.475
WHERE I HEARD A POTENTIAL HOLE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE 

10:03:43.631 --> 10:03:46.095
CLARIFICATION. DID YOU ATTEND 
THE JULY 26 DEPUTIES MEETING

10:03:51.874 --> 10:03:53.366
? THE DEPUTIES COMMITTEE MEETING
THAT OCCURRED? 

10:03:53.367 --> 10:03:55.131
&gt;&gt; YES I DID. 
&gt;&gt; WAS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING 

10:03:55.132 --> 10:03:56.339
THAT THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED THE 
HOLD? 

10:03:56.340 --> 10:03:59.390
&gt;&gt; WE WERE TOLD IN THAT MEETING 
I THE OMB PRESENT IS THAT THEY 

10:03:59.591 --> 10:04:02.025
WERE OBJECTING TO PROCEEDING 
WITH THE ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THE 

10:04:02.241 --> 10:04:04.241
PRESIDENT HAD SO DIRECTED

10:04:09.146 --> 10:04:11.171
THROUGH THE CHIEF OF STAFF, THE 
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF. 

10:04:11.172 --> 10:04:12.789
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT'S POSITION REGARDING 

10:04:12.790 --> 10:04:14.008
THE HOLD? 
&gt;&gt; THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

10:04:14.009 --> 10:04:16.041
ADVOCATED AS I DID IN THE 
MEETING, WE ARE PROCEEDING WITH 

10:04:16.443 --> 10:04:18.443
ALL ASSISTANCE CONSISTENT WITH 
OUR POLICIES AND INTERESTS IN 

10:04:18.832 --> 10:04:22.341
UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVED WHAT YOU SAID, 

10:04:22.575 --> 10:04:24.172
YOU BELIEVED IN THE RELEASE OF 
THE HOLD? 

10:04:24.173 --> 10:04:30.459
&gt;&gt; YES I DID. DID ANYONE IN THE 
END OF JULY SUPPORT THE HOLD? 

10:04:30.872 --> 10:04:32.872
DID ANYBODY WANT THE HOLE 

10:04:58.600 --> 10:05:00.600
How is the security assistance

10:05:03.871 --> 10:05:05.701
in the national security 
interest of the United States, 

10:05:05.702 --> 10:05:07.702
what is our interest?

10:05:10.588 --> 10:05:12.607
I have constituents in Alabama 
who are wondering why we should 

10:05:12.821 --> 10:05:14.821
care about the security

10:05:27.845 --> 10:05:29.275
of the hold on the security 
assistance. 

10:05:29.276 --> 10:05:31.098
&gt;&gt; Yes ma'am, this specific 
assistance helps build the 

10:05:31.099 --> 10:05:32.928
capacity of Ukrainian Armed 
Forces. It is important to 

10:05:32.929 --> 10:05:34.929
understand that these are forces
that are fighting to defend 

10:05:34.961 --> 10:05:36.794
themselves against Russian 
aggression every day. It is an 

10:05:36.795 --> 10:05:38.795
ongoing war. They do need this 
equipment to support their 

10:05:38.828 --> 10:05:41.063
ability to defend themselves and
I would say there is a larger 

10:05:41.263 --> 10:05:43.263
issue here having to do with

10:05:50.401 --> 10:05:52.436
U.S. policy on Russia. We 
believe it is very important to 

10:05:52.636 --> 10:05:54.468
strengthen the capacity of 
Ukraine in order to deter 

10:05:54.469 --> 10:05:56.241
Russian aggression elsewhere in 
the world. 

10:05:56.242 --> 10:05:58.242
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

10:06:00.154 --> 10:06:02.387
Ever able to get a reason why 
that hold with uncommitted you 

10:06:02.589 --> 10:06:07.474
ever get a reason? 
&gt;&gt; No ma'am, the only thing I 

10:06:07.669 --> 10:06:10.122
heard about it but this is again
second, third hand was that the 

10:06:10.321 --> 10:06:12.321
President was concerned about 
corruption. That was all I ever 

10:06:12.891 --> 10:06:16.333
heard. 
&gt;&gt; Were you ever able to provide

10:06:19.860 --> 10:06:21.715
any additional information about
the reason for the hold? 

10:06:21.716 --> 10:06:26.160
&gt;&gt; No ma'am. 
&gt;&gt; I think you and I feel that 

10:06:26.372 --> 10:06:27.992
the balance of my time to the 
chairman. 

10:06:27.993 --> 10:06:32.806
&gt;&gt; I think you to the gentleman.
My college Artie asked

10:06:41.194 --> 10:06:43.630
is it common to have hold on 
military eight and I think you 

10:06:43.843 --> 10:06:46.279
said they are not unusual. Would
you agree that it would be very 

10:06:46.481 --> 10:06:48.512
unusual to place a hold on 
military eight in order to 

10:06:48.714 --> 10:06:50.714
leverage a foreign country to 
get them to investigate a 

10:06:50.749 --> 10:06:52.749
political opponent? 
&gt;&gt; Yes.

10:06:56.232 --> 10:06:58.232
&gt;&gt; I take it you would agree 
that is completely 

10:06:58.266 --> 10:06:59.481
inappropriate? 
&gt;&gt; That would be inconsistent 

10:06:59.482 --> 10:07:01.388
with the conduct of our foreign 
policy in general. 

10:07:01.389 --> 10:07:02.933
&gt;&gt; It would also be wrong, 
wouldn't it? 

10:07:02.934 --> 10:07:11.067
&gt;&gt; It is not what I would do. 
&gt;&gt; It would be interesting if 

10:07:11.468 --> 10:07:13.705
any witness has testified that 
is the case. I kneeled my time 

10:07:13.904 --> 10:07:16.553
to Mr. Jordan. 
&gt;&gt; Think the gentleman Ft. 

10:07:16.757 --> 10:07:18.787
Snelling. First of all, I just 
wanted to know where the 

10:07:18.990 --> 10:07:22.397
chairman started, he said that 
Lassiter

10:07:34.626 --> 10:07:36.873
Hale is one of our witnesses. 
They are all your witnesses. You

10:07:37.074 --> 10:07:39.074
called 17 witnesses. You 
subpoenaed 15 of them. They are 

10:07:39.109 --> 10:07:41.109
all your witnesses. We didn't 
get to subpoena anyone, we 

10:07:41.138 --> 10:07:43.583
didn't get to call anyone. You 
give us an opportunity to get a 

10:07:43.775 --> 10:07:46.219
list of a couple weeks ago where
we made suggestions on who might

10:07:46.420 --> 10:07:49.258
allow its to have but so we did 
put three people of the 17 on 

10:07:49.471 --> 10:07:51.502
that list so they could provide 
some sibilance of context and 

10:07:51.702 --> 10:07:53.702
framework for this entire thing.
Once again, misleading the folks

10:07:53.741 --> 10:07:55.741
watching this hearing is not

10:07:59.825 --> 10:08:01.857
helpful. Thank you both for 
being your aunt for your service

10:08:02.059 --> 10:08:06.879
to our country. Ambassador to 
Pakistan, Lebanon,

10:08:13.242 --> 10:08:15.060
envoy to the Middle East, 
ambassador to Jordan, Bahrain, 

10:08:15.061 --> 10:08:17.095
Saudi Arabia, Europe into every 
hotspot on the planet. Thank you

10:08:17.295 --> 10:08:19.128
for there's hardship 
assignments. We appreciate your 

10:08:19.129 --> 10:08:23.597
surface. Let me go first to 
earlier today ambassador 

10:08:24.358 --> 10:08:30.712
Sondland said that he was denied
access to some of his records. 

10:08:30.912 --> 10:08:34.577
The State Department put out a 
statement, like every current 

10:08:34.980 --> 10:08:37.151
State Department employee held 
before Congress in this manner

10:08:45.947 --> 10:08:47.947
retained at all times and 
continues to retain full access 

10:08:47.981 --> 10:08:49.610
to State Department document 
Terry records and State 

10:08:49.611 --> 10:08:51.632
Department email account which 
he has been fully free to access

10:08:51.846 --> 10:08:53.880
and review at will. That is an 
accurate statement from the 

10:08:54.081 --> 10:08:56.251
State Department, isn't it 
ambassador help us too 

10:08:56.252 --> 10:09:01.003
&gt;&gt; I had not seen it shortly 
before entering this hearing 

10:09:01.192 --> 10:09:03.014
room and it sounds accurate. 
&gt;&gt; Appreciate that. Ambassador, 

10:09:03.015 --> 10:09:08.499
you are aware of no connection 
in exchange for any kind of 

10:09:08.699 --> 10:09:12.972
investigation, is that correct? 
You are not aware of any 

10:09:13.171 --> 10:09:16.091
connection between the parts in 
aid in exchange for some kind of

10:09:16.294 --> 10:09:18.466
investigation being announced or
done by the Ukrainian is that 

10:09:18.657 --> 10:09:20.657
right? If you are not

10:09:23.937 --> 10:09:25.937
aware of Secretary Pompeo having
any direct knowledge of the 

10:09:25.973 --> 10:09:28.407
connection between 
investigations and security aid,

10:09:28.620 --> 10:09:30.989
is that correct? 
&gt;&gt; I am not aware of that.

10:09:37.146 --> 10:09:39.378
&gt;&gt; You are not aware of any 
nefarious motive to withhold a 

10:09:39.657 --> 10:09:41.958
to do Ukraine, is that correct? 
&gt;&gt; Correct answer. 

10:09:41.959 --> 10:09:44.469
&gt;&gt; Executive Director that what 
you knew was that President 

10:09:44.662 --> 10:09:46.662
Trump was skeptical of foreign 
assistance generally.

10:09:50.157 --> 10:09:51.983
Mr. Radcliffe highlighted that 
and two, skeptical of the 

10:09:51.984 --> 10:09:53.984
corruption environment and 
Ukraine. Is that accurate?

10:10:00.929 --> 10:10:03.160
&gt;&gt; We had heard that, that was a
general impression that the 

10:10:03.361 --> 10:10:04.979
State Department corrected 
&gt;&gt; The aid was eventually 

10:10:04.980 --> 10:10:06.611
released Ukraine them is that 
correct as well? 

10:10:06.612 --> 10:10:11.482
&gt;&gt; I read that, guess. 
&gt;&gt; It was just a 55 day or less 

10:10:11.897 --> 10:10:14.684
two-month pause in the actual 
hold on the aid, is that right? 

10:10:14.872 --> 10:10:16.566
Ambassador? 
&gt;&gt; I think so, desk correct. 

10:10:16.567 --> 10:10:18.567
&gt;&gt; Your knowledge at a top 
principal

10:10:25.301 --> 10:10:26.933
at the State Department, and 
investigation into Biden, 

10:10:26.934 --> 10:10:28.934
Burisma, the 2016 election never
happened by the Ukrainian's, is 

10:10:28.954 --> 10:10:30.954
that correct? 
&gt;&gt; I don't know that I have the 

10:10:30.989 --> 10:10:33.021
ability to answer that question 
having taken this job in August 

10:10:33.783 --> 10:10:35.783
of 2018.

10:10:42.570 --> 10:10:44.598
&gt;&gt; Since you have taken the job,
how about that? 

10:10:44.599 --> 10:10:46.031
&gt;&gt; To my knowledge, that is 
correct. 

10:10:46.032 --> 10:10:48.032
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I kneeled back. 
&gt;&gt;

10:10:52.319 --> 10:10:54.555
Thank you chairman. Mr. Cooper, 
too clean is the first line of 

10:10:54.768 --> 10:10:56.768
defense against Russia's

10:10:59.836 --> 10:11:01.290
aggression and expansion into 
Europe. Numerous witnesses 

10:11:01.291 --> 10:11:03.315
testified that Ukraine is in 
fact vulnerable to

10:11:07.967 --> 10:11:09.588
Russian influence and control. 
Your dispositions are, you 

10:11:09.589 --> 10:11:11.220
testified that providing 
security assistance is vital to 

10:11:11.221 --> 10:11:13.221
helping the Ukrainians be able 
to defend themselves. What do 

10:11:13.255 --> 10:11:17.467
you mean by that sir? 
&gt;&gt;

10:11:21.171 --> 10:11:23.612
We have a long-standing policy 
of helping Ukraine become a

10:11:28.894 --> 10:11:31.335
resilient estate in order to be 
able to defend itself. We want a

10:11:31.544 --> 10:11:33.544
reliable and brilliant and 
self-reliant security and 

10:11:33.732 --> 10:11:35.619
partner in Ukraine that can 
stand up to Russian intimidation

10:11:35.620 --> 10:11:38.444
and aggression. 
&gt;&gt; You testified at the time of 

10:11:38.646 --> 10:11:42.709
Russia's 2014 attack that the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces were 

10:11:42.910 --> 10:11:46.304
significantly less capable than 
it is today, would you say

10:11:49.828 --> 10:11:51.446
that Ukrainian forces were 
outmatched by Russia's military 

10:11:51.447 --> 10:11:58.962
in important ways? 
&gt;&gt; I did not so testified. I 

10:11:59.163 --> 10:12:01.163
think Ambassador Hill

10:12:08.914 --> 10:12:10.545
. 
&gt;&gt; Mr. Cooper, would you like to

10:12:10.546 --> 10:12:12.546
come and question 
&gt;&gt; I do believe that was my 

10:12:12.579 --> 10:12:14.196
deposition but could you repeat 
the question briefly? 

10:12:14.197 --> 10:12:16.229
&gt;&gt; During the time of Russia's 
2014 attack, the Ukrainian Armed

10:12:16.430 --> 10:12:18.430
Forces were significantly less 
capable than it was today. Would

10:12:18.462 --> 10:12:23.746
you say the Ukrainian forces 
were outmatched by Russia's 

10:12:23.961 --> 10:12:25.177
military in critical ways? 
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. 

10:12:25.178 --> 10:12:27.817
&gt;&gt; Are the Ukrainian is now 
completely self-sufficient in 

10:12:28.014 --> 10:12:30.014
your mind, essentially

10:12:36.351 --> 10:12:37.800
in their ability to deter 
Russian aggression? 

10:12:37.801 --> 10:12:39.797
&gt;&gt; No sir, they have a long way 
to go. 

10:12:39.798 --> 10:12:42.409
&gt;&gt; Would you say that Ukrainian 
Armed Forces are now completely 

10:12:42.591 --> 10:12:44.591
self-sufficient

10:12:47.518 --> 10:12:50.368
, how much of an impact does the
U.S. need to have in terms of 

10:12:50.568 --> 10:12:52.401
that determined how critical is 
the relationship between both 

10:12:52.402 --> 10:12:54.402
Ukraine and the U.S. 
&gt;&gt; The Ukrainians are on the 

10:12:54.434 --> 10:12:56.867
right path to be able to provide
for their own security but they 

10:12:57.628 --> 10:13:00.458
will need U.S. and allied 
support

10:13:04.386 --> 10:13:06.820
for quite some time and they 
need that support in the form of

10:13:07.021 --> 10:13:10.640
tangible assistance as well as 
political and diplomatic 

10:13:10.826 --> 10:13:14.341
support. 
&gt;&gt; This question is to the both 

10:13:14.542 --> 10:13:18.407
of you, why was Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea so 

10:13:18.673 --> 10:13:20.673
significant in your mind?

10:13:27.145 --> 10:13:28.360
Madame Cooper? 
&gt;&gt; Russia violated the 

10:13:28.361 --> 10:13:32.213
sovereignty of Ukraine's 
territory. Russia illegally 

10:13:32.429 --> 10:13:35.467
annexed territory that belonged 
to Ukraine. They also denied 

10:13:35.881 --> 10:13:41.366
Ukraine access to it naval fleet
at the time and to this day, 

10:13:41.570 --> 10:13:49.016
Russia is building a capability 
on my designed to expand Russian

10:13:49.205 --> 10:13:54.969
military power project far 
beyond the immediate region. 

10:13:55.384 --> 10:14:00.870
&gt;&gt; In 2014 were there concerns 
in Washington and European 

10:14:01.625 --> 10:14:06.556
capitals that Russia might not 
stop in Ukraine? 

10:14:06.557 --> 10:14:12.644
&gt;&gt; I was not in my current 
position in 2014 but it is my 

10:14:12.862 --> 10:14:15.693
understanding that there was 
significant fear about where 

10:14:16.109 --> 10:14:19.759
Russian aggression would stop. 
&gt;&gt; What about today, if at the 

10:14:19.959 --> 10:14:21.959
U.S. were to withdraw

10:14:25.042 --> 10:14:27.399
its military support of Ukraine,
which would effectively happen? 

10:14:27.681 --> 10:14:34.192
&gt;&gt; It is my belief that if we 
were to withdraw our support, it

10:14:34.392 --> 10:14:38.862
would embolden Russia, it would 
also validate Russia's violation

10:14:39.086 --> 10:14:42.572
of international law. 
&gt;&gt; Which country stands to 

10:14:42.758 --> 10:14:46.923
benefit the most, were to stand 
to benefit the most? 

10:14:46.924 --> 10:14:51.663
&gt;&gt; Russia. 
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Taylor testified 

10:14:51.863 --> 10:14:56.080
about the importance of the U.S.
upholding international system 

10:14:56.264 --> 10:14:58.264
and

10:15:00.195 --> 10:15:02.227
it has underwritten peace in 
Europe since the end of World 

10:15:02.430 --> 10:15:04.430
War II. It

10:15:07.097 --> 10:15:09.097
critical aspect of defending the
system is that Russia cannot 

10:15:09.131 --> 10:15:11.367
change its borders by military 
force. That is why there is a 

10:15:11.567 --> 10:15:13.735
strong bipartisan support for 
providing Ukraine with security 

10:15:13.928 --> 10:15:16.177
assistance. That is why it is

10:15:20.303 --> 10:15:22.137
incredibly destructive of the 
president of the United States 

10:15:22.138 --> 10:15:25.184
to withhold its assistance as 
part of a scheme to pressure 

10:15:25.384 --> 10:15:29.451
Ukraine into investigating 
Edgemont conspiracy theory and 

10:15:29.855 --> 10:15:33.505
attack former Vice President 
Biden. Mr. Chairman, I yield 

10:15:34.259 --> 10:15:38.115
back. 
&gt;&gt; Documents up.

10:15:41.839 --> 10:15:44.328
&gt;&gt; Thank you chairman, as an 
Army reserve surgeon I can say I

10:15:44.521 --> 10:15:47.938
served before two Republican and
two Democrat presidents myself. 

10:15:48.343 --> 10:15:50.343
I want to go to

10:15:57.477 --> 10:16:00.127
Ms. Cooper if I can, page 3, I 
heard the president 20 of the 

10:16:00.327 --> 10:16:02.367
office of management and budget 
to pull funds because of his 

10:16:02.560 --> 10:16:05.207
concerns about corruption in 
Ukraine. You come from the DOD 

10:16:05.409 --> 10:16:08.090
side, I served a year in Iraq 
and it was important

10:16:13.529 --> 10:16:16.178
, I think it is something the 
Army always does as I have seen 

10:16:16.380 --> 10:16:18.820
that we don't want to deliver 
aid or assistance if it is going

10:16:19.014 --> 10:16:21.014
to some corrupt or being 
delivered in some corrupt way. 

10:16:21.049 --> 10:16:23.486
In other words if we are going 
to build a medical treatment 

10:16:23.698 --> 10:16:26.733
facility for the Iraqis, we want
to make sure not getting charged

10:16:26.947 --> 10:16:32.029
10 times as much. We are 
concerned about corruption in 

10:16:32.229 --> 10:16:34.798
general when we are delivering 
funds. Is that correct?

10:16:40.967 --> 10:16:42.998
&gt;&gt; Yes sir. 
&gt;&gt; I think that that is a normal

10:16:43.198 --> 10:16:46.035
thing to want to be concerned 
about and we would do that in 

10:16:46.248 --> 10:16:48.248
Iraq and especially if we are 
providing

10:16:54.570 --> 10:16:56.805
payment for something. I just 
want to go through a few things 

10:16:57.005 --> 10:16:58.636
with you because multiple 
witnesses have testified that 

10:16:58.637 --> 10:17:00.670
the action to provide a javelins
to Ukraine by the administration

10:17:01.420 --> 10:17:03.520
demonstrates strong support to 
Ukraine. Ambassador the amount 

10:17:04.283 --> 10:17:06.491
of its in her deposition said 
the president

10:17:11.238 --> 10:17:13.238
's decision to provide legal 
weapons to Ukraine that the 

10:17:13.259 --> 10:17:15.908
policy actually got stronger 
over the last three years. She 

10:17:16.111 --> 10:17:18.340
also said in terms of lethal 
assistance, we all felt it was 

10:17:18.541 --> 10:17:21.793
very significant what you that 
this administration made the 

10:17:22.214 --> 10:17:24.027
decision to provide legal 
weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador 

10:17:24.028 --> 10:17:27.276
Taylor said it was a substantial
improvement in that this 

10:17:27.693 --> 10:17:29.693
administration provided Javelin

10:17:33.378 --> 10:17:35.378
antitank weapons. Very strong 
political message it said of the

10:17:35.438 --> 10:17:37.989
Americans are willing to provide
more than blank. Investor vocal

10:17:42.114 --> 10:17:43.945
said that providing arms to 
Ukraine has been extremely 

10:17:43.946 --> 10:17:45.946
couple. Mr. Volcker also stated

10:17:52.064 --> 10:17:54.301
parties and blankets and all 
that is fine but if you are 

10:17:54.500 --> 10:17:56.500
being attacked by mortar and 
artillery antitank, you need to 

10:17:56.533 --> 10:17:58.568
be able to fight back. Secretary
George Kent stated that Javelin 

10:17:58.767 --> 10:18:01.412
are incredibly effective weapons
at stopping armed advanced and 

10:18:01.815 --> 10:18:03.815
the Russians are scared of them.
Special advisor

10:18:09.548 --> 10:18:11.165
Catherine Croft stated javelins 
help Ukraine defend themselves. 

10:18:11.166 --> 10:18:13.750
The decision to provide javelins
we believe is counter to Russian

10:18:13.936 --> 10:18:16.852
interests. Do you dispute what 
these witnesses have testified 

10:18:17.613 --> 10:18:19.613
to, including

10:18:24.170 --> 10:18:25.584
Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, 
Taylor, Volcker and others? 

10:18:25.585 --> 10:18:29.253
&gt;&gt; I absolutely agree that  
Javelin system is an important 

10:18:29.452 --> 10:18:32.003
capability and this was a very 
important decision to support 

10:18:32.201 --> 10:18:35.292
Ukraine with this capability. 
You are ready to 

10:18:35.293 --> 10:18:38.933
&gt;&gt; You are divided you are proud
of the decision

10:18:46.722 --> 10:18:48.339
with javelins, correct? 
&gt;&gt; That is correct sir. 

10:18:48.340 --> 10:18:50.788
&gt;&gt; One of the things on page 3 
tonight, you were talking about 

10:18:50.990 --> 10:18:56.059
the weekend July 20 sixth and 
said I was aware of the national

10:18:56.273 --> 10:18:58.245
security community expressed 
unanimous support for resuming 

10:18:58.246 --> 10:19:02.975
the funding and that the U.S. 
national security interests, 

10:19:03.175 --> 10:19:05.960
that is correct, you said that? 
&gt;&gt; That is correct sir. 

10:19:05.961 --> 10:19:09.878
&gt;&gt; I guess I take a little 
question with resuming because 

10:19:10.083 --> 10:19:13.135
we don't want to resume as is, 
would that be correct? Because 

10:19:13.331 --> 10:19:15.331
as is would not included 
Javelin.

10:19:21.665 --> 10:19:23.496
&gt;&gt; Sir, I am not sure I am 
following. 

10:19:23.497 --> 10:19:25.321
&gt;&gt; The previous administration, 
javelins were not provided. Even

10:19:25.322 --> 10:19:28.918
though they could have been. 
President Obama stopped the 

10:19:29.107 --> 10:19:31.107
javelins

10:19:38.120 --> 10:19:40.152
. He could have delivered 
javelins, let's put it that way.

10:19:40.352 --> 10:19:42.591
&gt;&gt; I think I should clarify what
I meant by that statement. 

10:19:42.787 --> 10:19:45.837
Resuming was just referring to 
the fact that the OMB placed a 

10:19:46.036 --> 10:19:48.272
hold on the assistant so we 
weren't spending and I wanted to

10:19:48.533 --> 10:19:50.533
resume the spending

10:19:53.768 --> 10:19:55.768
so that we can maintain this 
policy, maintain the strength. 

10:19:55.800 --> 10:19:58.235
&gt;&gt; Meeting the policy but I 
guess what I am asking, there is

10:19:58.435 --> 10:20:00.435
a difference and I think 
Undersecretary Hale, I thought I

10:20:00.470 --> 10:20:03.105
saw you nodding, the difference 
being that as it is presumed in 

10:20:03.870 --> 10:20:07.731
this case, now it included 
javelins, which Obama 

10:20:07.923 --> 10:20:12.859
administration denied is that 
correct? 

10:20:12.860 --> 10:20:16.312
&gt;&gt; It is true that the Trump 
administration approved the 

10:20:17.058 --> 10:20:21.800
release of defensive lethal 
assistance to include Javelin 

10:20:22.545 --> 10:20:26.675
where as the previous 
administration did not support 

10:20:27.437 --> 10:20:30.482
that policy. 
&gt;&gt; Mr. Hill committee comment on

10:20:30.744 --> 10:20:37.846
that? I think we can conclude 
more than blanket and helping 

10:20:38.084 --> 10:20:41.711
Ukrainians into the lethal 
defensive weapons are something 

10:20:41.915 --> 10:20:45.163
the Trump administration has 
proved is a benefit to all of 

10:20:45.363 --> 10:20:50.046
us, thank you. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank

10:20:50.246 --> 10:20:52.833
you both for being here this 
evening. There is this mystery 

10:20:53.030 --> 10:21:02.833
surrounding the hold on the July
it appears. Back in May 

10:21:03.247 --> 10:21:07.650
Ms. Cooper, I believe you said 
that it was conditioned

10:21:10.765 --> 10:21:12.998
, which was certified in May 
that the conditions had been met

10:21:13.197 --> 10:21:15.197
and they include

10:21:17.666 --> 10:21:19.498
progress on command and control 
reform, commitment to pursue 

10:21:19.499 --> 10:21:22.570
defense industry reform them and
pass laws to enable government 

10:21:22.758 --> 10:21:24.758
to government procurement

10:21:30.470 --> 10:21:31.942
correct? 
&gt;&gt; Yes man, that is correct. 

10:21:31.943 --> 10:21:33.943
&gt;&gt; When you find out in July 
they are concerned about 

10:21:34.122 --> 10:21:35.552
corruption, you are scratching 
your head, right? 

10:21:35.553 --> 10:21:37.528
&gt;&gt; Yes ma'am, we did not 
understand. 

10:21:37.529 --> 10:21:41.920
&gt;&gt; And do you know of any effort
that was undertaken then to 

10:21:42.108 --> 10:21:47.673
assess the corruption in Ukraine
in June, July, August?

10:21:51.792 --> 10:21:54.775
&gt;&gt; Man, as I believe I said in 
my deposition, the only specific

10:21:59.725 --> 10:22:01.758
discussions that I am aware of 
related to that series of 

10:22:02.360 --> 10:22:07.042
interagency meetings, the PCC, 
policy coronation committee and 

10:22:07.805 --> 10:22:13.878
the deputy swallow and in those 
meetings, participant did 

10:22:14.066 --> 10:22:20.242
discuss the degree to which 
corruption was a concern and the

10:22:20.465 --> 10:22:25.121
degree to which there was 
progress. My recollection of 

10:22:25.318 --> 10:22:29.382
what the participants said in 
these meetings was that there 

10:22:29.581 --> 10:22:34.265
was a very positive sense that 
progress was being made. 

10:22:34.266 --> 10:22:36.498
&gt;&gt; You have these meetings, 
progress is being made nothing 

10:22:36.698 --> 10:22:38.864
really changes from May until 
September

10:22:43.201 --> 10:22:47.467
that would then trigger the 
release of money except 

10:22:47.868 --> 10:22:52.750
whistleblower coming forward. 
&gt;&gt; I do not know what triggered 

10:22:52.952 --> 10:22:54.952
the release of the funding.

10:22:59.253 --> 10:23:02.052
&gt;&gt; The fact that there was 
reference made to do money being

10:23:02.249 --> 10:23:04.322
withheld door other countries 
was made by some of our 

10:23:05.074 --> 10:23:07.523
colleagues but in those 
situations in countries like 

10:23:07.710 --> 10:23:11.372
Pakistan, Lebanon, they are 
multiyear funding streams, 

10:23:11.559 --> 10:23:13.559
correct?

10:23:21.590 --> 10:23:23.623
&gt;&gt; Ma'am, those accounts fall 
outside of my purview so I 

10:23:23.827 --> 10:23:26.058
cannot answer that question. 
&gt;&gt; I have been told that that is

10:23:26.272 --> 10:23:28.507
indeed the case so there is not 
the immediate angst or hit 

10:23:28.718 --> 10:23:30.718
financially that would 
potentially accrue.

10:23:35.611 --> 10:23:37.842
The difference as I see it in 
Ukraine as compared to these 

10:23:38.057 --> 10:23:40.057
other countries is that 
Ukrainians are engaged in a hot 

10:23:40.077 --> 10:23:44.348
war with Russia right now. It 
seems that what is holding that 

10:23:45.095 --> 10:23:50.778
money was responsible 
considering that they had made

10:23:59.385 --> 10:24:01.619
, taken steps to meet all the 
conditions that we had requested

10:24:01.820 --> 10:24:03.820
of them and Congress had 
appropriated the funds, is that 

10:24:03.854 --> 10:24:09.137
not the case? 
&gt;&gt; Ma'am, I and my DOD 

10:24:09.338 --> 10:24:11.168
colleagues advocated strenuously
for the release of these funds 

10:24:11.169 --> 10:24:12.389
because of the national security
importance. 

10:24:12.390 --> 10:24:14.390
&gt;&gt; Ethically, the entire

10:24:18.072 --> 10:24:20.072
interest of the Department of 
Defense and State Department 

10:24:20.463 --> 10:24:22.463
were consistently

10:24:25.591 --> 10:24:27.428
supportive of releasing the 
funds. Everyone was mystified as

10:24:27.429 --> 10:24:29.455
to why the funds had been 
withheld and everyone is earning

10:24:29.655 --> 10:24:32.450
amount trying to get an answer 
and you are getting kind of 

10:24:32.642 --> 10:24:35.493
obtuse responses signing it with
the president because of 

10:24:35.681 --> 10:24:42.858
corruption. What we see is 
Zelinski gets elected in April, 

10:24:43.059 --> 10:24:45.059
the expectation is

10:24:48.142 --> 10:24:50.142
Vice President Pence is going to
attend the inauguration in 

10:24:50.736 --> 10:24:54.844
September and the president 
pulls the carpet out from under 

10:24:55.044 --> 10:24:57.894
him in terms of him going and 
then he proceeds in June or July

10:24:58.095 --> 10:25:03.981
to withhold the funds. There is 
a concerted effort by the 

10:25:04.194 --> 10:25:09.611
president of the United States 
to act in a manner that

10:25:13.958 --> 10:25:15.958
is not consistent with our 
interests in wanting to protect 

10:25:15.969 --> 10:25:20.390
Ukraine and help them deal with 
the Russian aggression at its 

10:25:20.576 --> 10:25:24.649
border. Would you agree with 
that? 

10:25:24.650 --> 10:25:29.987
&gt;&gt; Ma'am, I have advocated for 
the security assistance and I 

10:25:30.187 --> 10:25:32.965
have advocated for high-level 
engagement

10:25:36.688 --> 10:25:38.935
with the government of Ukraine 
because I think both are in the 

10:25:39.136 --> 10:25:41.984
national security interests. 
&gt;&gt; With that I kneeled back. 

10:25:42.188 --> 10:25:46.851
&gt;&gt; Mr. Stewart 
&gt;&gt; Esther Chairman, 

10:25:47.123 --> 10:25:49.020
Undersecretary, assistant 
secretary, thank you both for 

10:25:49.021 --> 10:25:51.523
being here. You are both 
recognized as experts dedicated 

10:25:52.139 --> 10:25:59.454
public servants. I have to tell 
you this is perhaps the most 

10:25:59.658 --> 10:26:05.140
complicated endeavor of the 
entire world, nobody could do it

10:26:05.339 --> 10:26:07.385
without people like you to 
provide the backbone you do. I 

10:26:07.573 --> 10:26:09.807
don't need to repeat the same 
questions add not him but I 

10:26:10.009 --> 10:26:13.472
think we have reached a point at
not see him sometime yesterday 

10:26:13.873 --> 10:26:15.873
or sometime ago. It is

10:26:21.189 --> 10:26:23.421
repetitive. You will forgive me 
for doing that. Mr. Cooper, I do

10:26:23.622 --> 10:26:26.173
have some questions based on 
some things you said previously 

10:26:26.364 --> 10:26:28.289
and I would just want for 
clarification, there is a 

10:26:28.290 --> 10:26:30.290
question about these emails

10:26:34.386 --> 10:26:35.816
that I think they climbed 
withholding, described 

10:26:35.817 --> 10:26:37.817
withholding V-8 and they had 
come from Capitol Hill or 

10:26:37.838 --> 10:26:39.667
someone on the foreign affairs 
committee, is that true? 

10:26:39.668 --> 10:26:44.350
&gt;&gt; Sir, are you referring to my 
statement today or something? 

10:26:44.614 --> 10:26:47.106
&gt;&gt; I believe this was a question
we had previous argue

10:26:53.486 --> 10:26:54.954
aware of such an email question 
mark 

10:26:54.955 --> 10:26:57.550
&gt;&gt; I am so weak I don't think I 
have enough information to make 

10:26:57.749 --> 10:26:59.749
an assessment. Is it from a 
particular page in my 

10:26:59.787 --> 10:27:01.420
deposition? 
&gt;&gt; It is is reporting we have 

10:27:01.421 --> 10:27:03.234
heard there may have been 
communications with someone on 

10:27:03.235 --> 10:27:07.705
the foreign affairs to MIDI on 
the hill, is that not true quest

10:27:07.905 --> 10:27:09.136
mark 
&gt;&gt; There may have been 

10:27:09.137 --> 10:27:10.758
communications with me? 
&gt;&gt; Yes, email with you. 

10:27:10.759 --> 10:27:12.791
&gt;&gt; Sir, I am not aware. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you and for 

10:27:12.990 --> 10:27:15.346
clarification as well, someone 
may have asked your

10:27:24.572 --> 10:27:26.799
thumb the Ukrainian Embassy but 
the withholding of aid, is that 

10:27:26.986 --> 10:27:28.694
true quest mark 
&gt;&gt; Sir I testified earlier that 

10:27:28.695 --> 10:27:30.460
the communication from the 
Ukrainian Embassy was to my 

10:27:30.461 --> 10:27:34.725
staff and my staff mentioned 
this to me after my deposition. 

10:27:35.127 --> 10:27:37.577
The only specific communication 
that I recollect with the 

10:27:37.778 --> 10:27:42.568
Ukrainians about this specific 
issue was on September 5th

10:27:50.376 --> 10:27:51.593
at a reception at Ukrainian 
Embassy. 

10:27:51.594 --> 10:27:54.028
&gt;&gt; Just to bore down on that 
little bit, was that a query 

10:27:54.229 --> 10:27:56.229
generally about the forthcoming 
aid or was it specific regarding

10:27:56.261 --> 10:27:58.621
them being aware that we had was
being withheld? 

10:27:58.622 --> 10:28:03.365
&gt;&gt; Sir, just to be clear, the 
September 5th conversation that 

10:28:03.579 --> 10:28:05.579
I had was specific to the cold. 
There

10:28:09.466 --> 10:28:11.760
was an awareness of that and 
there was a question of concern.

10:28:11.949 --> 10:28:16.983
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you. You know, 
Ms. Cooper, to both of you 

10:28:17.184 --> 10:28:19.985
Undersecretary Hill as well, at 
the end of the day, it really 

10:28:20.171 --> 10:28:24.304
does, and I've done this before,
it really does come down to 

10:28:24.504 --> 10:28:26.525
this. The transcript I am 
holding up is the transcript of 

10:28:26.739 --> 10:28:30.589
the phone call between President
Volodymyr Zelensky and President

10:28:30.804 --> 10:28:32.804
Trump that I would hope every 
American would take the 

10:28:32.857 --> 10:28:38.518
opportunity to read. It is only 
a few pages long.  Much more 

10:28:38.722 --> 10:28:40.753
information beyond that is maybe
helpful to inform but it really 

10:28:40.954 --> 10:28:42.370
comes down to those 
conversations, those few 

10:28:42.371 --> 10:28:44.371
sentences. Mr. Hill, we are 
going to

10:28:48.271 --> 10:28:50.705
a series of questions and I have
your answers here so it won't 

10:28:50.912 --> 10:28:52.912
take long. You have answered 
them generally anyway, you agree

10:28:53.002 --> 10:28:56.805
to United States should evaluate
whether countries deserve our 

10:28:57.006 --> 10:28:59.006
aid, is that correct?

10:29:08.584 --> 10:29:10.614
You say as well President Trump 
has been skeptical of foreign 

10:29:10.814 --> 10:29:13.464
aid and some of the money we 
have given is that there is will

10:29:13.902 --> 10:29:15.011
put Mark 
&gt;&gt; I think so. 

10:29:15.012 --> 10:29:17.115
&gt;&gt; I think that has been fairly 
consistent. He has done that 

10:29:17.316 --> 10:29:19.316
since before he was elected. 
Others in the process of 

10:29:19.357 --> 10:29:21.357
testified Ukraine has a long 
history of corruption, that is 

10:29:21.380 --> 10:29:23.816
not going to surprise anyone of 
us. Do you think it was right 

10:29:24.029 --> 10:29:26.466
that President Trump would test,
I think is the word he was to 

10:29:26.666 --> 10:29:28.487
previously, that he would test 
President Volodymyr Zelensky  

10:29:28.488 --> 10:29:30.253
player to providing the security
assistance? 

10:29:30.254 --> 10:29:32.254
&gt;&gt;

10:29:35.200 --> 10:29:37.236
President Volodymyr Zelensky was
new. I had met him in February, 

10:29:37.435 --> 10:29:39.672
I was impressed by him but I 
think it was understandable for 

10:29:39.870 --> 10:29:41.870
the administration  to

10:29:48.002 --> 10:29:50.023
them as the new president was 
coming to office, to understand 

10:29:50.235 --> 10:29:52.052
better what that president's 
policies would be an attitude 

10:29:52.053 --> 10:29:53.883
toward the native states. 
&gt;&gt; Undersecretary, I think that 

10:29:53.884 --> 10:29:56.119
is key. We have added referred 
to as the department of defense 

10:29:56.318 --> 10:29:58.351
completed their report, this was
a person elected and we knew 

10:29:58.568 --> 10:30:00.586
nothing about him. He didn't 
have a history of government and

10:30:00.800 --> 10:30:04.053
the Ukraine, he was like 
president Trump, he did not come

10:30:04.252 --> 10:30:08.319
from a public background that we
would have much information on 

10:30:08.518 --> 10:30:10.952
him. It was presented to testing
and to see if he was furious 

10:30:11.715 --> 10:30:15.624
about Ukraine. At some point, I 
am going to conclude. I believe 

10:30:15.823 --> 10:30:18.273
it was about Labor Day, the 
secretary was able to imitate 

10:30:18.475 --> 10:30:20.309
the president on security 
assistance about the same time 

10:30:20.310 --> 10:30:23.958
you had some others secretary or
vice president pants and ran to 

10:30:24.908 --> 10:30:32.893
and Bolton as well as well as 
the eight is released, is that 

10:30:33.654 --> 10:30:35.654
your understanding?

10:30:40.809 --> 10:30:43.044
&gt;&gt; I was never informed as to 
why the assistance was released.

10:30:43.257 --> 10:30:45.292
I did read about it. 
&gt;&gt; Those events did happen and 

10:30:45.490 --> 10:30:47.729
it seems like they were the 
reason the gate was released. I 

10:30:48.483 --> 10:30:52.249
yelled back. 
&gt;&gt; Mr. Quigley. 

10:30:52.250 --> 10:30:54.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you both for being 
here, thank you for your 

10:30:54.424 --> 10:30:56.424
favorites. You have both been 
asked about the importance of 

10:30:57.020 --> 10:30:59.863
the military assistance as it 
affects Ukrainian sovereignty 

10:31:00.060 --> 10:31:02.060
and

10:31:03.976 --> 10:31:05.976
its importance because of 
potential greater ambitions by 

10:31:06.156 --> 10:31:11.490
the Russians. Let me try to put 
it in context and please get 

10:31:11.690 --> 10:31:13.992
your reaction from both of you 
from someone who had been there 

10:31:14.182 --> 10:31:18.314
before, a renowned international
policy expert on such things

10:31:23.474 --> 10:31:25.706
, his quote seems to strike home
today. He wrote "Russia can 

10:31:25.922 --> 10:31:30.789
either be an empire or a 
democracy. It cannot be both. 

10:31:31.740 --> 10:31:37.227
Without Ukraine, Russia ceases 
to be an empire but with Ukraine

10:31:41.157 --> 10:31:43.157
and in subordinated, Russia 
automatically becomes an empire.

10:31:46.027 --> 10:31:48.817
" Your thoughts on how this puts
this into context today please. 

10:31:49.008 --> 10:31:55.163
&gt;&gt; Sir, I think that is a very 
powerful and accurate quote. 

10:31:55.579 --> 10:31:58.772
&gt;&gt; I would agree. 
&gt;&gt;

10:32:03.296 --> 10:32:05.886
Ms. Cooper, you talked about 
emails that were drawn to your 

10:32:06.074 --> 10:32:08.074
attention

10:32:11.428 --> 10:32:13.243
that was sent to your staff, is 
that correct? 

10:32:13.244 --> 10:32:15.480
&gt;&gt; The emails I discussed this 
evening emails sent to my staff,

10:32:15.683 --> 10:32:17.683
that is correct.

10:32:22.395 --> 10:32:25.037
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think first of all it
is important to point this out 

10:32:25.234 --> 10:32:27.666
that it is not something you 
were aware of that points to a 

10:32:27.880 --> 10:32:29.880
larger issue the Defense 
Department and the State 

10:32:30.057 --> 10:32:32.057
Department have

10:32:37.224 --> 10:32:39.257
refused to comply with a duly 
issued subpoena to provide this 

10:32:39.457 --> 10:32:41.275
committee with documents that 
would further shed light on 

10:32:41.276 --> 10:32:43.276
precisely what the Ukrainians 
knew about the hold. This isn't 

10:32:43.310 --> 10:32:45.343
something you are aware of but 
there is untold information out 

10:32:45.543 --> 10:32:48.752
there being blocked that would 
draw greater light and help us 

10:32:48.941 --> 10:32:52.661
understand. Is there anything 
else out there that you are 

10:32:53.428 --> 10:32:55.428
aware of

10:32:59.976 --> 10:33:02.011
for the possibilities that are 
out there with the Department of

10:33:02.213 --> 10:33:04.243
Defense or the State Department 
which could help us shed light 

10:33:04.445 --> 10:33:06.477
on what the Ukrainians knew and 
when they know it? 

10:33:06.478 --> 10:33:08.711
&gt;&gt; Sir, I have shared with the 
committee all that I recollect 

10:33:08.915 --> 10:33:13.793
the I have not done an 
exhaustive investigation. I 

10:33:13.995 --> 10:33:17.645
really can't speculate on what 
else might be available by 

10:33:17.844 --> 10:33:19.709
combing through all of the 
Defense Department records, 

10:33:19.710 --> 10:33:23.749
which are substantial. 
&gt;&gt; Did the State Department or 

10:33:23.941 --> 10:33:26.389
Department of Defense ask you 
for your information or did they

10:33:26.591 --> 10:33:28.741
coordinate with you to get 
information you had? 

10:33:28.742 --> 10:33:30.742
&gt;&gt;

10:33:32.274 --> 10:33:38.773
Sir, I was told not to destroy 
anything and our I.T. personnel 

10:33:39.176 --> 10:33:43.855
have been collecting documents 
is my understanding, so that 

10:33:44.059 --> 10:33:46.059
occurs without the individual

10:33:53.395 --> 10:33:55.229
having to -- 
&gt;&gt; They were collecting it and 

10:33:55.230 --> 10:33:57.675
passing it on to the state or 
DOD, is that correct? You said 

10:33:57.874 --> 10:33:59.903
the department was collecting 
it, they went passing that on to

10:34:00.105 --> 10:34:02.681
you, they were passing it on to 
the State Department? 

10:34:02.682 --> 10:34:04.682
&gt;&gt;

10:34:07.423 --> 10:34:09.688
This is what they reported to 
me. I have not seen the 

10:34:09.871 --> 10:34:12.220
documents that have been 
collected. I only know those 

10:34:12.503 --> 10:34:14.736
documents that I have produced 
or my staff has brought to my 

10:34:14.938 --> 10:34:19.203
attention that I have received. 
I do not know what has happened 

10:34:19.403 --> 10:34:21.403
with the documents that have 
been

10:34:28.956 --> 10:34:30.373
collected. 
&gt;&gt; The same general question, do

10:34:30.374 --> 10:34:32.002
you Sir? 
&gt;&gt; I requested and was granted 

10:34:32.003 --> 10:34:34.039
access to documents that either 
originated or had been sent to 

10:34:34.236 --> 10:34:36.236
me that were relevant to the 
pertinent matters of this 

10:34:36.269 --> 10:34:39.727
investigation during a finite 
time., I don't have information 

10:34:39.921 --> 10:34:43.374
about what else is going on in 
terms of other documents that I 

10:34:43.572 --> 10:34:48.858
did not produce or I did not 
perceive. There was a move to 

10:34:49.059 --> 10:34:53.141
gather them and I understood 
generally that they had been 

10:34:53.330 --> 10:34:57.386
gathered, that is the extent of 
my knowledge. 

10:34:57.387 --> 10:35:00.361
&gt;&gt; Did they pass them on to you 
or pass them on to

10:35:08.370 --> 10:35:10.075
the demonstration somehow? 
&gt;&gt; The only documents I 

10:35:10.076 --> 10:35:12.052
received, sir, where does within
the parameters I described. What

10:35:12.053 --> 10:35:16.698
requested and given what were 
the documents either I produced 

10:35:16.899 --> 10:35:19.132
were were sent to me relevant to
the matters we are discussing 

10:35:19.334 --> 10:35:20.951
today. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I yield back to 

10:35:20.952 --> 10:35:23.400
the chairman. 
&gt;&gt; Ms. Stefanik. 

10:35:23.401 --> 10:35:25.401
&gt;&gt; Thank you to both our 
witnesses for your services 

10:35:25.435 --> 10:35:28.315
today. Miss Cooper Kupp I want 
to start with you. You spoke 

10:35:28.503 --> 10:35:30.503
eloquently of the threat of 
Russia

10:35:33.556 --> 10:35:35.590
when it illegally annexed 
Crimea, how that is a threat not

10:35:35.787 --> 10:35:37.960
only to Ukraine but it is also a
threat

10:35:46.155 --> 10:35:48.186
to Europe and the United States,
it is a national security 

10:35:48.387 --> 10:35:50.387
challenge. I sit on the House 
armed services committee, we 

10:35:50.420 --> 10:35:52.439
know that the most important 
support for Ukraine in terms of 

10:35:52.656 --> 10:35:54.688
legal defense of a defense the 
forms of javelins, would you 

10:35:54.887 --> 10:35:56.919
agree with that? 
&gt;&gt; Yes ma'am. 

10:35:56.920 --> 10:35:58.741
&gt;&gt; Went administration where 
those javelins made available to

10:35:58.742 --> 10:35:59.754
Ukraine postmark 
&gt;&gt; This administration. 

10:35:59.755 --> 10:36:01.587
&gt;&gt; Not of the Obama 
administration. Both of you, 

10:36:01.588 --> 10:36:05.455
have you ever spoken with the 
president about Ukraine? 

10:36:05.456 --> 10:36:07.456
&gt;&gt; Know, I have not. 
&gt;&gt;

10:36:13.568 --> 10:36:14.785
No man. 
&gt;&gt; Undersecretary Hill, you 

10:36:14.786 --> 10:36:16.786
testified that you have no 
direct knowledge of any 

10:36:16.819 --> 10:36:18.246
nefarious motivations to 
withhold aid to Ukraine, 

10:36:18.247 --> 10:36:20.247
correct? 
&gt;&gt; Correct.

10:36:31.451 --> 10:36:33.451
&gt;&gt; To your knowledge you 
testified that there were no 

10:36:33.484 --> 10:36:35.518
strings attached to the aid, 
correct? That is page 184 of 

10:36:35.717 --> 10:36:36.934
your deposition. 
&gt;&gt; No such knowledge. 

10:36:36.935 --> 10:36:38.767
&gt;&gt; More specifically, you 
testified you had no knowledge 

10:36:38.768 --> 10:36:40.768
of Ukraine aid being held up 
before investigation, is that 

10:36:40.800 --> 10:36:41.658
correct? A 
&gt;&gt; Correct. 

10:36:41.659 --> 10:36:43.636
&gt;&gt; During the temporary hold of 
security assistance, this is 

10:36:43.637 --> 10:36:45.867
untold basso detailers in the 
cable, you had never heard the 

10:36:46.083 --> 10:36:48.083
words Burisma or Biden, correct?
&gt;&gt;

10:37:01.309 --> 10:37:03.140
In the context of what we are 
discussing, correct. 

10:37:03.141 --> 10:37:05.375
&gt;&gt; You testified that on page 
96. Ultimately as we know, the 

10:37:05.575 --> 10:37:07.208
aide was released to Ukraine 
democrats question mark 

10:37:07.209 --> 10:37:09.229
&gt;&gt; Yes, I read that. 
&gt;&gt; Let's talk broadly about the 

10:37:09.443 --> 10:37:11.521
contacts. You justify it is not 
just Ukraine but there were 

10:37:11.705 --> 10:37:16.746
other countries whose security 
assistance was on hold. The aid 

10:37:16.962 --> 10:37:18.982
package to Lebanon was also 
being held in the same fashion, 

10:37:19.195 --> 10:37:19.799
correct? 
&gt;&gt; Correct. 

10:37:19.800 --> 10:37:21.800
&gt;&gt; Foreign aid was withheld from
northern tribal countries of 

10:37:21.886 --> 10:37:23.886
South America come to

10:37:30.966 --> 10:37:32.999
correct? You also testified that
when you served as ambassador to

10:37:33.215 --> 10:37:34.834
Pakistan, security assistance 
was also withheld for their 

10:37:34.835 --> 10:37:36.835
failure to conform to our 
concerns regarding terrorists 

10:37:36.866 --> 10:37:39.030
and other issues on the Afghan 
Pakistan border. 

10:37:39.031 --> 10:37:41.031
&gt;&gt;

10:37:43.568 --> 10:37:44.784
Correct. 
&gt;&gt; Basically, let's broadly talk

10:37:44.785 --> 10:37:49.451
about the context of all of 
these holds on it. When we talk 

10:37:49.667 --> 10:37:53.581
about it, I always think about 
these are hard earned to 

10:37:53.770 --> 10:37:55.149
taxpayer dollars, would you 
agree with that? 

10:37:55.150 --> 10:37:57.150
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. 
&gt;&gt;

10:38:06.732 --> 10:38:08.361
Isn't it correct that this 
administration, the Trump 

10:38:08.362 --> 10:38:09.768
administration has been 
collecting a foreign assistance 

10:38:09.769 --> 10:38:11.802
review to reestablish forms that
kind of the assistant as we 

10:38:12.002 --> 10:38:13.431
provide aid overseas. 
&gt;&gt; That is correct. 

10:38:13.432 --> 10:38:15.467
&gt;&gt; You testified that this 
preview had been going on for 

10:38:15.668 --> 10:38:17.500
quite a while if the 
administration didn't want to 

10:38:17.501 --> 10:38:19.501
take a business

10:38:22.569 --> 10:38:24.601
as usual approach. A feeling 
once a country has received a 

10:38:24.802 --> 10:38:26.433
certain assistance package, it 
is something that continues 

10:38:26.434 --> 10:38:29.002
forever and you continued "the 
program had to be evaluated that

10:38:32.531 --> 10:38:34.347
they were actually were the 
beneficiaries of our assistance,

10:38:34.348 --> 10:38:36.348
that our program it made sense, 
that we avoid nationbuilding 

10:38:36.384 --> 10:38:40.449
strategies and that they provide
assistance to countries that in 

10:38:40.653 --> 10:38:42.682
terms of our policy to our 
adversaries" and you testified 

10:38:42.883 --> 10:38:46.748
you only welcome the assistance 
review. 

10:38:46.749 --> 10:38:48.749
&gt;&gt; Correct. 
&gt;&gt; Again, just

10:38:55.685 --> 10:38:57.749
to get this on record and for 
the millions of Americans 

10:38:57.932 --> 10:38:59.932
viewing, security assistance was
in fact released to Ukraine, I 

10:38:59.950 --> 10:39:02.382
know I have asked of this but 
this is an important point. 

10:39:02.383 --> 10:39:04.018
&gt;&gt; Correct. 
&gt;&gt; Think you, I yield back. 

10:39:04.019 --> 10:39:06.498
&gt;&gt; Mr. small well. 
&gt;&gt; Ms. Cooper, your testimony 

10:39:06.681 --> 10:39:08.841
today destroys two of the 
pillars of the president's 

10:39:09.028 --> 10:39:12.273
defense and one justification 
for his conduct.

10:39:17.618 --> 10:39:19.652
The first pillar, no harm no 
foul. That Ukraine's didn't know

10:39:19.853 --> 10:39:23.321
the hold was in place so didn't 
really hurt him. Second pillar, 

10:39:23.520 --> 10:39:29.605
this President was a real 
champion of anticorruption. He 

10:39:29.808 --> 10:39:33.068
cared about corruption in 
Ukraine. I am going to go 

10:39:33.269 --> 10:39:37.539
through your new testimony today
. It is your testimony now that 

10:39:37.745 --> 10:39:40.784
after an employee came forward 
to, you believe you had some 

10:39:40.986 --> 10:39:45.810
evidence that Ukrainians first 
inquired about security 

10:39:46.004 --> 10:39:48.004
assistance

10:39:49.721 --> 10:39:52.723
with someone in your office on 
July 25 of this year, is that 

10:39:52.913 --> 10:39:55.403
right? 
&gt;&gt; That is correct. 

10:39:55.404 --> 10:39:57.454
&gt;&gt; July 25 is also the day that 
President Trump officially 

10:39:57.642 --> 10:39:59.642
talked to President Volodymyr 
Zelensky 

10:40:09.433 --> 10:40:11.433
where investigation with the 
Bidens was brought up, is that 

10:40:11.474 --> 10:40:13.081
right? 
&gt;&gt; I only know what has been 

10:40:13.082 --> 10:40:15.082
reported publicly on this. 
&gt;&gt; That was reported, is that 

10:40:15.118 --> 10:40:16.132
right? 
&gt;&gt; That is correct. 

10:40:16.133 --> 10:40:18.366
&gt;&gt; Second, this President, as a 
champion of anticorruption, your

10:40:18.567 --> 10:40:24.251
testimony today is that on May 
23rd certified as far as is 

10:40:24.464 --> 10:40:27.011
related to your duties, Ukraine 
had met the corruption concerns 

10:40:27.299 --> 10:40:29.756
for the aide to be released is 
that right? 

10:40:29.757 --> 10:40:31.757
&gt;&gt;

10:40:36.444 --> 10:40:37.259
The Defense Department 
certified. 

10:40:37.260 --> 10:40:38.877
&gt;&gt; After that date, 
inexplicably, the president of 

10:40:38.878 --> 10:40:40.878
the United States put a hold on 
security

10:40:44.977 --> 10:40:47.212
assistance, is that right? 
&gt;&gt; That is what I heard in July,

10:40:47.415 --> 10:40:48.227
yes. 
&gt;&gt; This anticorruption 

10:40:48.228 --> 10:40:51.880
president, who cares so much 
about working out corruption in 

10:40:52.080 --> 10:40:54.528
Ukraine, did he ever called you 
after he put the whole to two 

10:40:54.729 --> 10:40:59.395
sites Ms. Cooper, what is going 
on in Ukraine? 

10:40:59.396 --> 10:41:01.396
&gt;&gt; Know as Sir. 
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Hill, did he ever 

10:41:01.434 --> 10:41:03.463
called you to ask for an update 
on Ukraine corruption question 

10:41:03.663 --> 10:41:04.478
marks 
&gt;&gt; No sir. 

10:41:04.479 --> 10:41:06.512
&gt;&gt; Did you ever call your boss 
secretary Pompeo postmark 

10:41:06.513 --> 10:41:11.049
&gt;&gt; I don't know. 
&gt;&gt; Ms. Cooper, did he ever call 

10:41:11.243 --> 10:41:13.243
the many boxes that you had that
the Department of Defense 

10:41:13.413 --> 10:41:14.228
secretary directing secretaries 
postmark 

10:41:14.229 --> 10:41:17.880
&gt;&gt; I don't know sir 
&gt;&gt; Now for the justification. 

10:41:18.094 --> 10:41:21.480
The justification is that that 
the Obama administration had

10:41:25.598 --> 10:41:27.429
provided blankets so Ukrainians 
should be grateful, even after 

10:41:27.430 --> 10:41:29.430
being shaken down that

10:41:36.376 --> 10:41:37.996
the Trump administration 
provided more. The truth, Ms. 

10:41:37.997 --> 10:41:39.997
Cooper, is that under the Obama 
administration and of the 

10:41:40.032 --> 10:41:41.852
European joint initiative, $175 
million were provided from a 

10:41:41.853 --> 10:41:44.095
U.S. taxpayer dollars to the 
Ukrainians, is that right? 

10:41:44.096 --> 10:41:48.764
&gt;&gt; Sir, I don't have that 
figure. The figure we typically 

10:41:48.964 --> 10:41:51.813
use is to say we provided $1.6 
billion to date. But I don't 

10:41:52.014 --> 10:41:54.014
have to break down in front of 
me.

10:42:06.837 --> 10:42:08.668
&gt;&gt; The Obama administration also
trained five military battalions

10:42:08.669 --> 10:42:09.883
of the Ukrainians, is that 
correct? 

10:42:09.884 --> 10:42:12.532
&gt;&gt; I don't have the figures in 
front of me but just for the 

10:42:12.733 --> 10:42:14.733
training program began in the 
Obama administration and we have

10:42:14.767 --> 10:42:15.983
been training. 
&gt;&gt; Under the Obama 

10:42:15.984 --> 10:42:17.057
administration, founded 
Ukrainian security assistance 

10:42:17.058 --> 10:42:18.977
initiative provided the 
Ukrainians were armored Humvees,

10:42:18.978 --> 10:42:22.073
technical drones, night vision 
devices, armored fests and 

10:42:22.286 --> 10:42:23.834
medical equipment, is that 
correct? 

10:42:23.835 --> 10:42:27.765
&gt;&gt; Those were pieces of 
equipment that were provided in 

10:42:28.529 --> 10:42:32.444
the Obama administration to my 
recollection. 

10:42:32.445 --> 10:42:35.413
&gt;&gt; You would agree that is a lot
more than blankets, right? 

10:42:35.414 --> 10:42:37.414
&gt;&gt;

10:42:40.363 --> 10:42:41.982
Yes sir. A 
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Hill, the aide 

10:42:41.983 --> 10:42:43.983
that was withheld to Lebanon and
Pakistan, those were for 

10:42:44.015 --> 10:42:46.015
legitimate foreign policy 
objectives, is that right?

10:42:57.429 --> 10:42:59.862
&gt;&gt; I would say that is true. The
assistance to Pakistan, I had 

10:43:00.063 --> 10:43:02.097
not heard an explanation for our
current holes on the Lebanese 

10:43:02.297 --> 10:43:03.728
program. 
&gt;&gt; And you would agree that 

10:43:03.729 --> 10:43:05.729
withholding aid to investigate a
political opponent is not a 

10:43:05.751 --> 10:43:07.178
legitimate foreign policy 
objective, is that correct? 

10:43:07.179 --> 10:43:09.001
&gt;&gt; Correct. 
&gt;&gt; I guess we can agree that 

10:43:09.002 --> 10:43:10.831
even Bernie made off made 
charitable contributions but it 

10:43:10.832 --> 10:43:13.803
doesn't make him a good guy. Ms.
Cooper

10:43:17.534 --> 10:43:21.343
, your testimony today 
demonstrates the power of coming

10:43:21.530 --> 10:43:26.881
forward in defining lawless 
orders from the president. 

10:43:27.282 --> 10:43:29.282
Because you came forward and 
testified

10:43:37.450 --> 10:43:39.310
, we learned this new 
information, which Detroit the 

10:43:39.311 --> 10:43:40.899
central defense of the 
Republicans put forth. Because 

10:43:40.900 --> 10:43:42.900
Ambassador Taylor came forward, 
one of his employees learned the

10:43:42.932 --> 10:43:44.932
defense from the Republicans 
that all we had was hearsay 

10:43:44.965 --> 10:43:46.965
evidence and Mr. Holmes said 
actually

10:43:50.034 --> 10:43:52.067
, I heard the president of the 
United States tell Ambassador 

10:43:52.266 --> 10:43:54.266
Sondland where are we with the 
investigations. Door correct has

10:43:54.299 --> 10:43:58.777
aided this investigation despite
the president continued 

10:43:58.978 --> 10:44:02.833
obstruction. I yield back. 
&gt;&gt; Mr. hurt. 

10:44:02.834 --> 10:44:06.027
&gt;&gt; Thank you chairman. 
Ambassador hail

10:44:13.809 --> 10:44:16.243
, you are in essence of the 
number three guy at the State 

10:44:16.443 --> 10:44:17.877
Department, is that correct? 
&gt;&gt; The correct. 

10:44:17.878 --> 10:44:19.631
&gt;&gt; Represent in roughly 70,000 
folks? 

10:44:19.632 --> 10:44:22.072
&gt;&gt; I represented them on one of 
them, yes. 

10:44:22.073 --> 10:44:24.073
&gt;&gt;

10:44:29.864 --> 10:44:31.880
You were part of a pretty 
fantastic workforce that I have 

10:44:32.095 --> 10:44:34.129
been proud to be able to serve 
alongside. We share time 

10:44:34.328 --> 10:44:36.328
together and Pakistan. So, 
thanks him. I know they 

10:44:36.364 --> 10:44:41.432
oftentimes don't get the pats on
the back or the accolades of for

10:44:41.633 --> 10:44:45.497
what they do for our national 
security but there are some of 

10:44:45.699 --> 10:44:47.699
us that do recognize that and 
appreciate that.

10:44:51.596 --> 10:44:53.781
Did anybody raise issues to you,
ambassador hail, about 

10:44:53.981 --> 10:44:55.862
investigations of the Bidens or 
Burisma? 

10:44:55.863 --> 10:44:57.863
&gt;&gt; No sir.

10:45:01.133 --> 10:45:03.582
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Ms. Cooper, you 
have a great to start. I don't 

10:45:03.793 --> 10:45:08.048
think my staff would've read my 
hundred 15 page deposition and 

10:45:08.271 --> 10:45:10.818
gave me feedback so I give them,
give them gold stars.

10:45:18.001 --> 10:45:20.001
You confirmed with my colleague 
in California that you certified

10:45:20.034 --> 10:45:25.520
on 23 May that the Ukraine and, 
their defense industry and the 

10:45:25.726 --> 10:45:27.726
department of defense

10:45:33.235 --> 10:45:35.235
, you know, had passed the 
corruption test, is that 

10:45:35.270 --> 10:45:36.884
correct? 
&gt;&gt; Sir, I think the wording was 

10:45:36.885 --> 10:45:38.920
more along the lines of progress
has been made or sufficient 

10:45:39.132 --> 10:45:41.132
progress has been made. It 
didn't

10:45:48.683 --> 10:45:49.894
reference any anticorruption 
test per se. 

10:45:49.895 --> 10:45:51.933
&gt;&gt; Did this change or was a 
reevaluation with the new 

10:45:52.134 --> 10:45:54.134
president coming on to

10:45:57.412 --> 10:45:59.261
President Volodymyr Zelensky was
inoculated in office two days 

10:45:59.262 --> 10:46:01.881
before that date, did not have 
an impact on how he was going to

10:46:02.081 --> 10:46:04.317
continue some of those  pieces, 
was that taken into account in 

10:46:04.514 --> 10:46:07.108
this review? 
&gt;&gt; Not prior to May 23rd, no 

10:46:07.298 --> 10:46:09.298
sir.

10:46:11.628 --> 10:46:13.663
&gt;&gt; So the review was basically 
done on the previous, the 

10:46:13.864 --> 10:46:15.864
efforts done by the previous 
administration.

10:46:20.767 --> 10:46:22.798
&gt;&gt; Yes sir, although it is 
important to note that the 

10:46:23.012 --> 10:46:24.829
review related most specifically
to the Ministry of Defense. 

10:46:24.830 --> 10:46:26.830
&gt;&gt; There were ultimately changes
under the

10:46:40.068 --> 10:46:41.283
Volodymyr Zelensky regime, is 
that correct? 

10:46:41.284 --> 10:46:43.317
&gt;&gt; Yes sir, there is a new 
minister of defense. 

10:46:43.318 --> 10:46:45.318
&gt;&gt; Can you explain, I know 
foreign military financing if 

10:46:45.351 --> 10:46:48.399
the state court, can you point 
difference between  that funding

10:46:48.604 --> 10:46:49.817
and how Ukrainians get legal 
aid? 

10:46:49.818 --> 10:46:52.805
&gt;&gt; I am sorry, could you repeat 
the last part of that? 

10:46:52.806 --> 10:46:56.934
&gt;&gt; Actually get lethally, easily
flayed covered under one of 

10:46:57.133 --> 10:47:02.002
these two buckets? 
&gt;&gt; There are three separate 

10:47:02.218 --> 10:47:04.248
pieces to our overall ability to
provide equipment to the 

10:47:04.450 --> 10:47:09.119
Ukrainian Armed Forces. The 
first is the foreign military 

10:47:09.342 --> 10:47:12.984
finance system, which is a State
Department authority and 

10:47:13.384 --> 10:47:15.384
countries around the world

10:47:18.869 --> 10:47:20.904
have this authority. That 
authority it was the for some of

10:47:21.673 --> 10:47:23.673
the training

10:47:25.974 --> 10:47:27.804
, there is also the Ukrainian 
security assistance initiative, 

10:47:27.805 --> 10:47:31.668
that is DOD authority unlike the
state authority, the DOD 

10:47:31.870 --> 10:47:33.870
authority is only one year 
authority. Third, there is 

10:47:34.260 --> 10:47:36.260
opportunity for defense sales.

10:47:42.237 --> 10:47:44.256
That is something that we are 
working with the Ukrainians on 

10:47:44.473 --> 10:47:46.473
now so that they can actually 
purchase U.S. equipment. The 

10:47:46.492 --> 10:47:48.492
javelin specifically was 
provided under

10:47:59.089 --> 10:48:01.089
FMF initially and now Ukrainians
are interested in the purchase 

10:48:01.122 --> 10:48:02.953
of Devlin's. 
&gt;&gt; There wasn't a hold put on 

10:48:02.954 --> 10:48:05.388
parts and of equipment, correct?
&gt;&gt; That is my cannot do my 

10:48:05.590 --> 10:48:07.590
understanding. 
&gt;&gt; Can I ask you a non-inquiry 

10:48:07.621 --> 10:48:09.621
question? A non-impeachment 
inquiry question.

10:48:13.923 --> 10:48:16.558
&gt;&gt; Sir, my time is yours. 
&gt;&gt; What can we be doing to help 

10:48:16.774 --> 10:48:20.825
Ukrainians to defend against 
Russian electronic warfare. What

10:48:21.035 --> 10:48:23.035
more can we be doing to help

10:48:29.152 --> 10:48:30.618
Ukrainians defend against 
electronic warfare by the 

10:48:30.619 --> 10:48:32.401
Russians. 
&gt;&gt; What I can say in an open 

10:48:32.402 --> 10:48:34.233
hearing is that there actually 
gets some electronic warfare 

10:48:34.234 --> 10:48:36.234
detection equipment that is 
included in the USA I packages 

10:48:36.265 --> 10:48:38.919
so there is a capability that we
are already working to provide 

10:48:39.682 --> 10:48:43.504
to them. I think this specific 
topic is more suitable for a 

10:48:43.783 --> 10:48:49.882
closed door session. 
&gt;&gt; Think you to your service to 

10:48:50.082 --> 10:48:52.043
your country and chairman, I 
yield back. 

10:48:52.044 --> 10:48:54.044
&gt;&gt;

10:49:01.048 --> 10:49:02.679
Mr. Castro. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you terminate thank you

10:49:02.680 --> 10:49:04.912
all for your to somebody today. 
I want to make an important 

10:49:05.112 --> 10:49:07.112
distinction here because a few 
of my colleagues have rattled 

10:49:07.145 --> 10:49:09.380
off countries where we have 
actually held up it. There is a 

10:49:09.578 --> 10:49:11.578
big decision between holding up 
aid for a legitimate policy 

10:49:11.656 --> 10:49:13.656
reason, foreign policy reason of
holding up aid because it is 

10:49:13.848 --> 10:49:15.848
part of a shakedown

10:49:19.332 --> 10:49:21.802
because it is in the service of 
a president who asks for a 

10:49:21.991 --> 10:49:23.991
political favor of a country to 
go investigate a political 

10:49:24.012 --> 10:49:27.210
rival. I think that is important
for us to note. I wanted to ask 

10:49:27.400 --> 10:49:29.400
you

10:49:32.944 --> 10:49:35.578
, Ms. Cooper, you said that the 
money was cleared to go by the 

10:49:35.779 --> 10:49:38.026
DOD on May 23rd, is that right? 
&gt;&gt; That is correct. 

10:49:38.027 --> 10:49:39.844
&gt;&gt; And it didn't get released 
until September 11th? 

10:49:39.845 --> 10:49:44.518
&gt;&gt; I should just clarify, the 
second half of the Ukraine 

10:49:44.728 --> 10:49:46.728
security assistance initiative 
was notified

10:49:52.847 --> 10:49:55.088
to Congress on May 23rd and 
there was a waiting period for 

10:49:55.290 --> 10:49:57.875
congressional approval and then 
after that point so in May to 

10:49:58.065 --> 10:50:00.065
June

10:50:11.543 --> 10:50:13.779
, roughly, it was available. 
&gt;&gt; Perhaps 90 days or so, 95 

10:50:13.978 --> 10:50:16.013
days, something like that. 
&gt;&gt; Yes, I don't have a calendar 

10:50:16.211 --> 10:50:18.446
in front of me, that is 
&gt;&gt; You both testified that the 

10:50:18.647 --> 10:50:20.480
hold on security assistance 
present in the national security

10:50:20.481 --> 10:50:23.531
interest of the date and that 
the hold might embolden Russia. 

10:50:23.934 --> 10:50:25.934
We have heard the same from 
numerous other witnesses that 

10:50:25.965 --> 10:50:28.600
have come before us. This was 
not the only issue I went to the

10:50:28.812 --> 10:50:30.812
hold, right? We understand 
people within United States 

10:50:30.978 --> 10:50:32.978
government

10:50:36.317 --> 10:50:38.386
had significant concerns about 
the legality of the hold as it 

10:50:38.574 --> 10:50:40.574
relates to the impoundment 
control act. This is because the

10:50:40.585 --> 10:50:42.615
money had been authorized by 
Congress and signed into law by 

10:50:42.817 --> 10:50:44.817
President. Ms. Cooper, at the 
July meetings, were there any 

10:50:44.848 --> 10:50:46.919
discussions about whether the 
hold could be implement it in a 

10:50:47.105 --> 10:50:49.105
legal fashion? 
&gt;&gt; So in the July 26 meeting, my

10:50:49.114 --> 10:50:53.179
leadership raised the question 
of how the presidents guidance 

10:50:53.382 --> 10:50:59.022
would be implemented and offered
that perhaps a reprogramming 

10:50:59.205 --> 10:51:03.608
action would be the way to do 
this but more research would 

10:51:03.794 --> 10:51:10.860
need to be done. After that 
discussion we had a lower level 

10:51:11.061 --> 10:51:13.061
discussion at my level

10:51:17.147 --> 10:51:19.394
on the 31st of July. 
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you about that 

10:51:19.596 --> 10:51:21.596
July 31st meeting. They say your
colleagues

10:51:30.360 --> 10:51:32.394
at the VOD at the July 31st 
interagency meeting, did you 

10:51:32.595 --> 10:51:34.213
share your understanding of 
legal mechanisms were available 

10:51:34.214 --> 10:51:35.641
at that time? 
&gt;&gt; Yes sir. Is 

10:51:35.642 --> 10:51:37.642
&gt;&gt; What were they? 
&gt;&gt; I expressed it was my 

10:51:37.677 --> 10:51:39.694
understanding there were two 
ways that we would be able to 

10:51:39.909 --> 10:51:41.525
limit presidential guidance to 
stop obligating the Ukraine 

10:51:41.526 --> 10:51:43.357
security assistance initiative 
and the first option would be 

10:51:43.358 --> 10:51:49.040
for the president to do a 
rescission. The second is a 

10:51:49.807 --> 10:51:51.807
reprogramming action

10:52:01.641 --> 10:52:03.056
that the Department of Defense 
would do. 

10:52:03.057 --> 10:52:04.888
&gt;&gt; Both of those would require 
congressional notice. There 

10:52:04.889 --> 10:52:07.125
would be an extra step the 
president would have to take to 

10:52:07.324 --> 10:52:09.560
notify Congress. As far as you 
know, was there ever any notice 

10:52:09.781 --> 10:52:12.208
that was sent out to Congress? 
&gt;&gt; I did express that I believed

10:52:12.408 --> 10:52:14.440
it would require notice to 
Congress and that there was no 

10:52:14.641 --> 10:52:16.874
such notice to my knowledge or 
preparation of such a notice to 

10:52:17.547 --> 10:52:19.521
my knowledge. 
&gt;&gt; As far as you know, there was

10:52:19.522 --> 10:52:21.338
no official rescission or 
reprogramming of that money? 

10:52:21.339 --> 10:52:23.516
&gt;&gt; No sir, not to my knowledge. 
&gt;&gt; Instead,

10:52:33.539 --> 10:52:35.155
they devised an alternative 
solution including footnotes to 

10:52:35.156 --> 10:52:37.393
implement the hold and there 
became a time in August when the

10:52:37.591 --> 10:52:39.591
Department of Defense no longer 
supported the use of footnotes 

10:52:39.624 --> 10:52:42.474
because of concerns they might 
not be sufficient time for DOD 

10:52:42.675 --> 10:52:44.909
to obligate funds before the end
of the fiscal year in violation 

10:52:45.110 --> 10:52:50.596
of the impoundment control act. 
Despite DOD concerns in mid 

10:52:50.795 --> 10:52:52.625
August about the impoundment 
control act and OMB footnotes, 

10:52:52.626 --> 10:52:54.626
the hold nevertheless continued

10:52:59.329 --> 10:53:01.360
through September 11th even 
after, now as an aside, this is 

10:53:01.562 --> 10:53:04.015
even after the whistleblower had
come forward. Is that right?

10:53:09.899 --> 10:53:12.128
&gt;&gt; It is correct of the hold was
released on September 11th, 

10:53:12.329 --> 10:53:14.411
guess. Is 
&gt;&gt; I know I and many of us here 

10:53:14.597 --> 10:53:16.999
share DOD is concerned about the
legality of the Lord. I want to 

10:53:17.211 --> 10:53:19.247
thank you Ms. Cooper for voicing
DOD's concerns to the White 

10:53:19.443 --> 10:53:21.443
House in pursuing the national 
security interests of the United

10:53:21.477 --> 10:53:24.114
States. Yield back. 
&gt;&gt; Chairman. Ms. Cooper, based 

10:53:24.874 --> 10:53:29.598
on the new email you mentioned 
in your opening and subsequent 

10:53:30.000 --> 10:53:32.000
declarations by some of my 
Democratic colleagues

10:53:36.913 --> 10:53:38.913
, those emails were evidence 
Ukrainians were aware as a 

10:53:38.951 --> 10:53:43.415
military hold on July 25th. 
There is now reporting out there

10:53:43.614 --> 10:53:46.260
saying that Pentagon official 
reveals Ukrainians ask about 

10:53:46.462 --> 10:53:48.462
stone security and.

10:53:52.351 --> 10:53:58.789
It is being widely reported that
Ukraine asked about the hold on 

10:53:58.983 --> 10:54:00.983
military

10:54:02.716 --> 10:54:05.908
aid on July 25th. That is not 
what I heard from you. Is that 

10:54:06.093 --> 10:54:08.232
correct? 
&gt;&gt; Sir, my exact words were that

10:54:08.428 --> 10:54:11.181
one email said that the 
Ukrainian Embassy

10:54:14.900 --> 10:54:16.729
and the House foreign affairs 
committee are asking about 

10:54:16.730 --> 10:54:20.298
security assistance. Assistance.
And then the second email was

10:54:32.373 --> 10:54:34.408
the knows about the FMF 
situation to an extent and so 

10:54:34.607 --> 10:54:36.425
does the Ukrainian Embassy, 
those are the exact words. 

10:54:36.426 --> 10:54:38.426
&gt;&gt; What to security assistance 
and FMF situation in these 

10:54:38.459 --> 10:54:40.459
emails mean?  
&gt;&gt; I don't want to speculate on 

10:54:40.520 --> 10:54:42.520
what it means. 
&gt;&gt; They don't necessarily mean 

10:54:42.660 --> 10:54:44.660
holes, correct?

10:54:50.860 --> 10:54:52.860
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily. 
&gt;&gt; Is it true that around the 

10:54:52.891 --> 10:54:55.125
same time, OMB put a hold on 15 
State Department and USAID 

10:54:55.324 --> 10:54:59.140
accounts including FMF? 
&gt;&gt; I don't know that specific 

10:54:59.327 --> 10:55:01.327
detail.

10:55:03.042 --> 10:55:05.280
&gt;&gt; You can't say one way or 
another whether the increase in 

10:55:05.476 --> 10:55:08.368
these emails were about the hold
, is that fair? 

10:55:08.369 --> 10:55:11.776
&gt;&gt; I cannot say for certain. 
&gt;&gt; You can't say one way or 

10:55:11.977 --> 10:55:14.129
another whether the Ukrainians 
knew about the world before

10:55:17.877 --> 10:55:20.255
August the 28th, 2010 when it 
was reported in politico, 

10:55:20.443 --> 10:55:23.274
correct? 
&gt;&gt; Sir, I can just tell you that

10:55:31.479 --> 10:55:33.712
the recollection of my staff 
that they likely knew but no, I 

10:55:33.916 --> 10:55:35.947
do not have a certain data point
to offer you. 

10:55:35.948 --> 10:55:38.393
&gt;&gt; It is not unusual, is it Ms. 
Cooper for foreign countries to 

10:55:38.594 --> 10:55:40.594
inquire about foreign aid they 
are expecting from the United 

10:55:40.629 --> 10:55:42.963
States, is it? 
&gt;&gt; Sir, in my experience with 

10:55:43.148 --> 10:55:45.148
the Ukrainians, they typically

10:55:49.963 --> 10:55:51.830
would call about the specific 
things, not just generally 

10:55:51.831 --> 10:55:53.828
checking in on their assistance 
package. 

10:55:53.829 --> 10:55:56.198
&gt;&gt; Are you aware that president 
Volodymyr Zelensky on  October

10:56:00.932 --> 10:56:02.932
10th in response to questions 
from more than 300 reporters 

10:56:02.962 --> 10:56:04.962
over the course of the afternoon
stated that

10:56:08.660 --> 10:56:11.095
he was not aware and had no 
knowledge of a hold on security 

10:56:11.296 --> 10:56:16.401
assistance during the time of 
the July 25th phone call with 

10:56:16.594 --> 10:56:18.399
President Trump? 
&gt;&gt; I believe I saw that media 

10:56:18.400 --> 10:56:20.350
reporting, guess. 
&gt;&gt; Yield back. 

10:56:20.351 --> 10:56:25.314
&gt;&gt; Mr. Hatch. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you both for being here

10:56:25.514 --> 10:56:27.514
this evening. Ambassador Hill

10:56:29.983 --> 10:56:32.520
. Last week at the country 
watched as President Trump 

10:56:32.702 --> 10:56:34.702
attacked and intimidated

10:56:40.552 --> 10:56:42.164
your colleague. He attempted to 
intimidate your colleague, 

10:56:42.165 --> 10:56:44.556
Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch who
is a witness to this proceeding.

10:56:45.837 --> 10:56:47.837
Subsequently, Secretary Pompeo 
declined to condemn that attack.

10:56:50.097 --> 10:56:54.698
Bluntly put, I think Secretary 
Pompeo's silence

10:57:02.282 --> 10:57:04.751
is nothing less than a betrayal 
of the men and women whom he 

10:57:04.943 --> 10:57:07.166
swore an oath to lead. It is a 
betrayal that has long-term 

10:57:07.926 --> 10:57:09.926
consequences to

10:57:14.265 --> 10:57:15.895
attracting and retaining 
workforce, to their morale, to 

10:57:15.896 --> 10:57:18.080
their effectiveness and to their
overall strength. So, Ambassador

10:57:18.265 --> 10:57:20.265
Hill,

10:57:21.391 --> 10:57:25.647
, I want to give you an 
opportunity to now do what 

10:57:25.848 --> 10:57:30.113
Secretary Pompeo did not do. 
Either in March of 2019 when the

10:57:30.315 --> 10:57:34.694
vicious smear campaign got 
kicked into high gear and you 

10:57:35.345 --> 10:57:40.267
sir rightfully pressed for a 
strong statement in support of 

10:57:40.468 --> 10:57:44.334
her or last week, when the 
president and his son attacked 

10:57:45.097 --> 10:57:47.097
her again.

10:57:50.833 --> 10:57:52.833
I am offering you the 
opportunity to reaffirm to this 

10:57:52.864 --> 10:57:54.683
committee and the millions of 
Americans hopefully who are 

10:57:54.684 --> 10:57:58.496
watching that Marie Yovanovitch 
is a dedicated and courageous 

10:57:58.682 --> 10:58:00.682
patriot.

10:58:08.503 --> 10:58:10.933
And that she served with grace 
and dignity, even in the face of

10:58:11.147 --> 10:58:12.365
that orchestrated and 
unsubstantiated smear attack 

10:58:12.366 --> 10:58:16.432
against her. Ambassador Hale, I 
am giving you the opportunity to

10:58:16.835 --> 10:58:21.915
demonstrate leadership. I am 
giving you the opportunity to 

10:58:22.114 --> 10:58:24.347
send a clear and resounding 
message to the men and women who

10:58:24.548 --> 10:58:29.420
serve in dangerous foreign posts
throughout the globe that what 

10:58:30.169 --> 10:58:39.587
happened to Marie Yovanovitch  
was wrong. Ambassador Hale? The 

10:58:39.785 --> 10:58:41.785
floor is yours. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you Congressman. I 

10:58:41.949 --> 10:58:45.681
endorse entirely your 
description of Ambassador Marie 

10:58:46.440 --> 10:58:50.368
Yovanovitch.  I only met her 
when I took this job but I 

10:58:50.555 --> 10:58:54.212
understood we had an exceptional
officer doing exceptional work 

10:58:54.413 --> 10:59:01.110
at a very critical Embassy and 
the doing my visits to Jeff, I 

10:59:01.313 --> 10:59:03.761
was very impressed with what she
was doing there to the extent I 

10:59:03.960 --> 10:59:05.960
would ask her if she would say.

10:59:11.680 --> 10:59:13.911
I support and believe in the 
institution and to the people of

10:59:14.138 --> 10:59:16.583
the State Department, I am one 
of them and have been for 35 

10:59:16.819 --> 10:59:20.611
years. All of us are committed 
to America's national security 

10:59:20.824 --> 10:59:23.055
and we are the best group of 
diplomats anywhere in the world.

10:59:23.256 --> 10:59:25.256
That support extends to all 
state officers who testified 

10:59:25.651 --> 10:59:30.568
before this. I would like to 
read a letter that the 

10:59:30.773 --> 10:59:32.613
undersecretary for management 
wrote on November 18 to the 

10:59:32.614 --> 10:59:34.433
ranking member of the Senate 
foreign relations committee in 

10:59:34.434 --> 10:59:36.434
response to a communication from
him.

10:59:44.986 --> 10:59:46.986
A number of department employees
have testified before the House 

10:59:47.019 --> 10:59:48.647
of Representatives that during 
his inquiry regarding Ukraine. 

10:59:48.648 --> 10:59:50.648
No employee has faced any 
adverse action by the department

10:59:50.682 --> 10:59:52.682
for testimony before Congress on
this matter. The department will

10:59:52.716 --> 10:59:54.334
not discipline any department 
employee for appearing before 

10:59:54.335 --> 10:59:56.172
Congress in response to a 
subpoena. Is also proactively 

10:59:56.173 --> 10:59:58.173
established a program to provide
financial assistance

11:00:03.473 --> 11:00:05.162
and perspectives private counsel
legal fees incurred by 

11:00:05.163 --> 11:00:07.154
department employees. There was 
additional information but that 

11:00:07.155 --> 11:00:09.155
is the essence of the message. 
&gt;&gt; Therefore, are you saying 

11:00:09.222 --> 11:00:11.222
Marie Yovanovitch 

11:00:13.837 --> 11:00:15.052
is a dedicated and courageous 
patriot? 

11:00:15.053 --> 11:00:16.470
&gt;&gt; I endorse what you say 
exactly. 

11:00:16.471 --> 11:00:18.471
&gt;&gt; And she served with grace and
dignity

11:00:24.804 --> 11:00:27.238
in the face of a smear campaign?
&gt;&gt; Yes she did pick 

11:00:27.239 --> 11:00:28.871
&gt;&gt; And that what happened to her
was 

11:00:28.872 --> 11:00:31.304
&gt;&gt; I believe she should have 
been able to stay at post and 

11:00:31.504 --> 11:00:33.548
continue to do the outstanding 
post, work she was doing. 

11:00:33.549 --> 11:00:35.824
&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you for 
clarifying the record. I wasn't 

11:00:36.007 --> 11:00:38.755
sure where it was that she could
go to set the record

11:00:46.544 --> 11:00:48.973
straight if it wasn't you was 
served, or where she could go to

11:00:49.173 --> 11:00:51.423
get her good name and reputation
back if it wasn't you sir. 

11:00:51.624 --> 11:00:53.642
Indeed, I want to encourage you 
in the strongest terms possible.

11:00:53.856 --> 11:00:55.472
Stand your ground. America's 
security into strength and 

11:00:55.473 --> 11:00:59.538
prosperity is predicated in no 
small part on the 

11:00:59.744 --> 11:01:01.744
professionalism of our foreign 
services core and they need to 

11:01:01.772 --> 11:01:03.772
to know that you, as the 
highest-ranking professional 

11:01:03.806 --> 11:01:05.806
diplomat in the entire State 
Department, have their back sir.

11:01:06.406 --> 11:01:08.406
Thank you for having

11:01:12.341 --> 11:01:14.159
Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's 
back this evening. With that, I 

11:01:14.160 --> 11:01:17.127
yield back . 
&gt;&gt; Mr. Jordan. 

11:01:17.128 --> 11:01:22.014
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ms. 
Cooper, the, who

11:01:26.355 --> 11:01:28.589
, why did the office of 
management and budget put a hold

11:01:28.790 --> 11:01:33.058
on the funds? 
&gt;&gt; Sir, the only information 

11:01:33.258 --> 11:01:35.258
that I received

11:01:37.727 --> 11:01:39.727
was from the office of 
management and budget that they 

11:01:39.757 --> 11:01:41.915
were operating at the direction 
of the president and

11:01:45.657 --> 11:01:47.474
they reported that he had 
concerns about corruption. That 

11:01:47.475 --> 11:01:49.709
is all that I knew. 
&gt;&gt; You put in your testimony the

11:01:49.923 --> 11:01:52.106
president had director the 
office of management and budget

11:01:58.041 --> 11:02:00.275
to hold the funds because of his
concerns over corruption in the 

11:02:00.476 --> 11:02:01.906
Ukraine, very legitimate reason,
do you agree? 

11:02:01.907 --> 11:02:04.291
&gt;&gt; That is the statement that 
the President reportedly made

11:02:08.608 --> 11:02:10.839
as reported to me by the office 
of management and budget. 

11:02:10.840 --> 11:02:12.840
&gt;&gt; You said in your testimony 
that based on recommendations 

11:02:12.872 --> 11:02:14.872
from community advisors that the
Department of Defense, in 

11:02:15.240 --> 11:02:17.240
coordination with

11:02:20.591 --> 11:02:22.624
vitamin estate, certified in May
in 2019 that Ukraine had taken 

11:02:22.825 --> 11:02:24.825
steps necessary and you 
certified as a release of the 

11:02:24.856 --> 11:02:26.675
dollars, is that accurate? 
&gt;&gt; That is correct sir. 

11:02:26.676 --> 11:02:29.125
&gt;&gt; But there was, there was a 
small change in Ukraine in the 

11:02:29.329 --> 11:02:32.314
spring of 2019, wasn't there? 
&gt;&gt; Yes sir. 

11:02:32.315 --> 11:02:35.207
&gt;&gt; Can you elaborate on what 
that change was? 

11:02:35.208 --> 11:02:37.208
&gt;&gt; The government

11:02:42.126 --> 11:02:43.944
,  president of Volodymyr 
Zelensky was elected to 

11:02:43.945 --> 11:02:45.938
government. 
&gt;&gt; You got a brand-new Geico 

11:02:45.939 --> 11:02:49.841
again.  He had just been sworn 
in the date you approved of the 

11:02:50.041 --> 11:02:52.041
dollars. May 23rd

11:02:57.157 --> 11:02:59.792
? I think he was sworn in a 
couple days before but there is 

11:02:59.994 --> 11:03:02.027
a sort of a change in 
circumstances that seem to me 

11:03:02.228 --> 11:03:06.031
would warrant a second look. 
That is exactly what played out.

11:03:10.560 --> 11:03:14.823
For a short time. Less than two 
months, 55 days, our government 

11:03:15.023 --> 11:03:19.704
evaluated the new situation, 
pretty radical change, you got a

11:03:20.468 --> 11:03:25.183
new government. In fact, the 
previous one, we have heard all 

11:03:25.382 --> 11:03:27.578
kinds of things from the 
Democrats about the prosecutor 

11:03:27.767 --> 11:03:35.133
general and how that he was. It 
took a while for that to happen,

11:03:35.347 --> 11:03:40.829
new president is is one in a few
months later the new Congress 

11:03:41.097 --> 11:03:43.097
comes in, takes them and while

11:03:45.697 --> 11:03:47.929
, not until September. September
5th that they get rid of this 

11:03:48.143 --> 11:03:50.727
prosecutor and just a few days 
later, the aide actually gets 

11:03:50.912 --> 11:03:55.660
released. But the Democrats got 
all kinds of other things they 

11:03:55.860 --> 11:04:00.328
want to talk about but the way 
this played out seems to me it 

11:04:00.529 --> 11:04:05.611
is as logical as you can do it 
and particularly when you put it

11:04:05.811 --> 11:04:07.811
in the broader framework of 
where this President is on 

11:04:07.845 --> 11:04:12.110
concern about foreign aid, his 
deep-rooted concern in the 

11:04:12.311 --> 11:04:17.197
corruption issue in Ukraine, the
experience he had with 

11:04:17.395 --> 11:04:20.179
high-ranking Ukrainian officials
criticizing him and supporting 

11:04:20.370 --> 11:04:23.010
secretary Clinton in the 2016 
election.

11:04:28.158 --> 11:04:30.393
Through that together, sort of 
shows why it played out the way 

11:04:30.594 --> 11:04:32.594
it did. With that I yield back.
