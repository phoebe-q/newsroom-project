00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.720
More than half of Americans have been ordered to stay at home. 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.000
Businesses have been shut down. 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.940
And President Trump is getting restless. 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.750
There are other areas that just aren't affected or they're affected very little. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.810
And why would we close down 100% of the country? 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.790
We can't have the cure be worse than the problem. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.760
Everyone wants to return to normal quickly. 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.010
But how realistic is it? 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.910
Let's compare the outbreak in the US with other countries.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
It started in China, of course, then the epicenter shifted to Italy, 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.940
which now has over 100,000 cases. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.610
Let's bring in other countries, too. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.850
Here we compare every country on the same timeline 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.020
with day one being the first day it reported 100 cases. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.830
We can see that the spike in cases in Spain, for example, was even sharper than in Italy. 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.430
The one bucking the trend has been South Korea. 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.810
It avoided a spike by doing one thing better than others. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.210
Experts praise South Korea. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.230
South Korea is now doing more than 10,000 tests per day. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
By March 1, South Korea had tested 100,000 people. 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.970
While the US started on a very similar trend, 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.540
it's seen its cases rise dramatically in recent days. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.440
It is now the country with the most cases in the world, 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.950
topping 160,000 as of Monday.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.410
However, the increase in cases reflects the fact that the US has, 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.480
after a very slow start, 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.080
finally ramped up the number of tests being carried out.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960
Now, to get a better insight into the severity of the outbreak in each country, 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.490
we need to look at how many corona virus infections have proved fatal.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.860
These are the number of deaths for Italy, China and South Korea, 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.190
again on a timeline that allows us to compare them 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.050
with day one as the first day that country had more than 25 deaths. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.380
The death toll in Italy past 5,000 after 23 days. It is now double that. 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.130
But let's look at Spain. Its curve is even steeper. 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.730
It reached the 5,000-mark in 19 days. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.650
After almost three weeks, the US has over 2,500 deaths, 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.800
which puts it on a similar trajectory to France. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.400
But to understand the effectiveness of a country's response, 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.340
we need to compare not just the number of deaths, 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.670
but if the rates are rising or slowing down. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
The Chinese death rate is slowing down. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.900
We were hopeful that the Italian death rate was beginning to slow. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.640
The death rate continues to slow. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.610
So let's look at the same numbers in a different way. 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
This time adapted to show the rate of change over the first three weeks. 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.670
This way we can see if a country succeeds in slowing the death rate. 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.360
Let's start with South Korea, where a trace-test-treat strategy has been widely praised.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.200
The number of deaths there doubled every seven days. 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.050
In comparison, China saw its number of reported deaths double every three days, 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.250
but it succeeded in slowing that trajectory in its third week. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.440
So far, European countries have not been able to slow their pace down 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.980
and are seeing their numbers double every three days. 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.490
The trend in the US has been similar until now, 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.790
but the rate has increased in recent days. 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.830
It's certainly nowhere near the slowing down seen in China, South Korea, 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.810
or even Italy lately.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.820
We don't yet know what impact the unprecedented shutdown across much of the US 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.170
will have on the outbreak. 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.410
But experts say the worst is still to come. 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.360
Well things won't get back to normal until we've flattened this curve for the corona virus. 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.750
No one is going to want to tone down things when you see 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.300
what's going on in a place like New York City. 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.210
Now we're looking at about 21 days for a possible apex. 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.670
Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won.
