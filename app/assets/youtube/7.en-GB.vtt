00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.920
The Republican Party has
some decisions to make.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.440
In early January the Capitol
was stormed by Trump supporters.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.840
Five people died,
including a police officer.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.940
A month on, Donald Trump faces
an impeachment trial again.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.360
This time accused of
inciting this violence.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.720
And whether guilty or not, this
is a man who repeatedly undermined

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.360
America's election, who received
more than 70 million votes,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520
and whose son sees it like this.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.980
This isn't

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.380
their Republican

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.760
Party any more.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.140
This is Donald Trump's Republican

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.500
Party.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.680
The world is watching what the
Republicans do about Trump.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.640
This impeachment trial is the
Democrats seeking to sanction him

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.540
despite him having left office.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.120
And on impeachment, the Republicans
are nothing, if not consistent.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.520
This was from the
first trial in 2019.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.500
I'm not an impartial juror.
This is a political process,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.720
there is not anything
judicial about it. Impeachment

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.280
is a political decision.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.240
And once again, many Republicans
appear to have made up their minds.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.880
I'll be brief. I oppose this article
of impeachment and I yield back.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.580
For a guilty verdict,
17 of them will need to vote

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.780
with the Democrats and that looks
unlikely because this is a story

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.720
of the backlash that didn't last.
In the aftermath of the Capitol,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960
Republicans took turns to
condemn the president.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.000
The president bears responsibility

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.360
for Wednesday's attack on
Congress by mob rioters.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.900
I think the president's rhetoric
was irresponsible. I think it was

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.400
reckless and I don't think
it was remotely helpful.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.200
All I can say

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.380
is count me out. Enough is enough.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.600
And remember Mitch McConnell saying
he wouldn't be an impartial juror.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.220
Well, in the aftermath of the
Capitol, The New York Times reported

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.760
that he was open to impeachment.
And Liz Cheney, the number three

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.500
Republican in the House of
Representatives, voted to impeach.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.960
'Republicans begin turning
on Trump,' Politico told us.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
But most didn't do so for long. By
late January, Senior Republican

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.480
Kevin McCarthy was visiting Donald Trump
to talk about the mid-term elections.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.960
Despite Trump's attacks
on American democracy,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.720
he remains part of Republicans'
thinking. And not for the first time,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.560
people are asking:
'Where is the limit for Republicans?'

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.880
It's a question they're
asked because of Trump.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.680
And because of newly elected
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.840
She supported the
QAnon conspiracy theory

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.800
about Satan-worshipping paedophiles.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.540
She's promoted conspiracy
theories about 9/11,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.440
about school shootings being staged,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.460
about body doubles being used on
the Supreme Court, about the 2018

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.640
California wildfires being
ignited by Jewish space lasers.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.780
And that's not even a comprehensive
list. This was the message

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.000
from the party's leadership
after a meeting on her future.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.300
This Republican Party is a very
big tent. Everyone's invited in.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360
To that, Republican
Senator Mitt Romney says:

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.740
'A big tent is not large enough
to both accommodate Conservatives

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.780
and kooks.' But arguably that's
exactly what's already happened.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.200
Donald Trump has spent years
pushing unsubstantiated conspiracy

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.960
theories - from Barack Obama
not being born in America,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.100
to wind turbines causing cancer,
to this election being stolen.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.660
Once you've chosen him as president,
where do you go?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.240
Well, Liz Cheney gave her answer when
she voted to impeach Donald Trump.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.300
But after that there was a push
to oust her from the party,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.040
including from Donald Trump Jr.
Well, she survived that.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.980
It was a very resounding
acknowledgement that we

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.120
need to go forward together and we
need to go forward in a way that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.720
helps us beat back the
really dangerous and
negative Democrat policies.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.960
This, though, isn't really about
policy. What we are seeing is a

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.880
battle about boundaries, about what
is and isn't politically acceptable.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.640
But to what degree is that
battle really about Trump?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.240
This Time article argues:
'Trumpism will live on,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.500
not because of his hold on the party,
but because of what the party

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.680
had become long before he
came to town.' But for years,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.100
there has been the idea that Trump
isn't really who Republicans are.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.840
Have a listen to Mitch McConnell.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.980
The mob was fed lies,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.820
they were provoked by the president
and other powerful people.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.940
But if that's the case, why is the
party still dealing with him now?

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.120
It may be a straight political
calculation that keeping Trump on

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.320
side helps, but it could also be
about something more fundamental.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.080
This is the Congressman
Adam Kinzinger.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.500
The Republican Party
has lost its way.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.240
If we are to lead again,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.660
we need to muster the courage
to remember who we are.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.440
We need to remember what we
believe and why we believe it.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.560
But perhaps it's not that
the party has forgotten,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.760
more that some of its leaders haven't
reconciled with what it has become.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.920
This is the Congressman Matt Gaetz.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.040
Right now there's an identity
crisis in the Republican Party.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.040
There are some in Washington who
believe that we've got to purge

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.380
Trumpism and then we've got to do
whatever is necessary to get back in

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.600
the good graces of the corporate PACs
that have sworn off some Republicans.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.320
I take a different view.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.380
Trump's impeachment matters.
Arguably, what follows matters more.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.360
We're about to find out what
the Republican Party stands for.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.040
The nature of American democracy
is directly tied to that outcome.
