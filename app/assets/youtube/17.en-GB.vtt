00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.360
how worried are you about Chinese espionage
in the United States?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.020
well I think from a

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.309
perspective of threat against the United
States national security in our interest

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.629
a China is number one by far and I think
espionage is a part of that but from a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.750
perspective of countering the
intelligence threat of foreign nations

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.080
China is our biggest concern across a
wide range of issues espionage is one of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.040
our larger ones.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.689
from where you sit you
see China is a greater threat than

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.180
Russia?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.809
yes! I think Russia has its own
skill sets with respect to threat to our

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.320
national security but it pales in
comparison the national security threat

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940
posed by China and I would say not only
here in the US from an economic security

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.050
perspective from a military elation
perspective as well as globally when you

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.920
look at China and what their strategic
plan is and Xi Jinping plan is to be the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.539
global superpower geopolitically
militarily and from an economic

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.390
perspective and they will achieve that
with any means necessary that becomes a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.280
global issue not just the u.s. issue.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.990
and what is China trying to do then what's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.760
it doing when it comes to stealing
secrets in America?

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.860
a lot of success has

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.540
been predicated upon the theft globally
and a lot of it here in the US of A

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.680
provide carry data and trade secrets if
you just looked back this year from June

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.530
or July till now Department of Justice
has indicted or charged 20 Chinese

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.439
individuals or businesses for economic
espionage just since July that is a lot

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.259
and those are just the ones we know
about those are just the ones that have

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.829
been charged through the criminal court
system now but I can tell you there's

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.700
more coming and there's more out there
so if you just look at that just a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.810
moment in time the amount of data and
then when we like to do is say okay

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.060
that's great we've arrested Chinese
students scientists businessmen stealing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.290
on behalf of the Communist Party of
China wonderful but what we like to look

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.049
at is what's the damage that's done what
is the long-term cost to the American

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.950
taxpayer to the research and development
organizations to universities to the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.360
businesses and how many jobs are lost
with the theft of this proprietary data

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.320
and trade secrets that's the long-term
impact of another country stealing my

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.800
proprietary data and trade secrets.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.890
they've been a number of cases

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.300
recently particularly on aerospace and
aviation do you think that shows a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900
particular interest from China in that
field?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.140
I think it does and I think it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.560
lays out again perfectly to their
strategic plan elements of what they're

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.250
interested in and I would say for any
foreign intelligence service is the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.299
ability to identify an engineer
scientist or someone of value in the

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.160
u.s. offer them free travel to China to
do a presentation in university or when

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.819
they get they get there
cultivate them and identify some of the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.920
product and get them to be coerced to
provide that technology that provides

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.000
your data or a trade secret to them and
I think that's tried-and-true and they

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.620
will continue to do that and because
people are vulnerable to that and don't

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.900
understand into ferrous activities when
they're asked to do so.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.780
there been

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.680
reports that the Chinese use social
media platforms like LinkedIn to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.080
approach people and to try and get them
to spy effectively.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.420
that's correct and I

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.920
think their use of the social media
sites like LinkedIn is prolific and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.160
their ability to do so my target of
perspective and be able to scan and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.660
search around the globe on these sites
for individuals that have a particular

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.709
technology is used every day and then
they could target those also if you look

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.620
at it from a perspective of the
intelligence service there it's a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.040
low-risk high-yield ability to send out
30,000 emails 40,000 emails and get 20

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.329
30 40 50 will respond and say I had that
technology I can come over and give that

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.320
presentation.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.380
How far are universities a
target and how far are they the kind of

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.740
battleground over secrets when it comes
to to espionage into China?

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.109
that's a great question universities are a big
part of this whole mosaic and we look at

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.380
you know where a lot of the research and
development is done throughout the world

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.090
it's in the universities and colleges
and research centers that are globalized

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.290
right and and our adversaries around the
world know that the Chinese know that so

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.349
they will put people on those positions
to identify not only emerging

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.699
technologies but now technologies I
think colleges universities and research

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:16.449
centers are constantly victimized by the
Chinese about this just in the u.s. we

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.419
grant probably 350,000 students from
China alone access here the majority of

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.210
those are really hard working students
to learning

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.009
better educated around in their own
families and their mindsets but provides

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.280
an amazing opportunity for the Chinese
intelligence services to utilize those

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.360
individuals to steal that research and
development when you look at the funding

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.840
that comes with those 350,000 I
think their current estimate is forty

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.430
five billion dollars a year that US
universities and colleges are getting

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.720
from China to have their students come
here that's wonderful it's great for the

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.520
economy but also the university is now
starting to understand not only the US

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.250
but around the globe
the activities and then Affairs

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.660
activities of intelligence services
oftentimes happen on college university

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.720
campuses.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.669
you're seeing in the UK you
think.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:04.340
that's correct.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.520
Chinese economic power in terms of is
clearly growing companies want access to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.630
the Chinese market does that create any
concerns over the leverages that that

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.680
might give China?

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.280
it certainly does and I
spend a lot of my time the private

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.560
sector talking just about this because
if you are a Western market a Western

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.099
business of Western entity who has
developed something in order to be that

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.520
successful down the road you need to
engage in the Chinese market right which

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.479
is a huge part of the global economy but
when you do so you need to go there

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.479
fully understanding that there are risks
to that there are laws that provide

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:50.320
China the ability to take your data your
trade secrets proprietary data, your

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.460
information everything that your code
for your sources code that comes with

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.270
anything you're gonna put there China
then owns that and that is not

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.349
reciprocal here in the US Great Britain
or Australia so when you look at that

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.449
capability when you go to China and the
global market to invest to be part of

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.659
that economy you have to go in there
with your eyes wide open that is a

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.220
significant challenge.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.710
do you think
companies are aware of that challenge

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.039
because some technology companies have
gone into China some are debating going

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.520
into China is the Google issue whether
they're gonna you know put a search

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.960
engine into China I mean do you think
companies are aware of the risks now of

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.160
what might be involved when it comes to
free expression for instance?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.960
I would say

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.080
most of them are not I think there are
companies that have a specific

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:39.110
organizational ties have a particular
product understand that and they go

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.580
their eyes
open but I think it's a risk based

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.630
assessment you have to have going to
China and I think we had to do a better

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.460
job in the Western civilization to say
hey when you go to China in this market

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.150
you were going to give this up
just as much as you were aware of that

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.759
and I think that's all we can really ask
for when you've talked about Google

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:02.160
Google CEO alphabet CEO pretty much said
hey listen you have to sell part of your

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
soul when you go to China you have to
make that part of your equation when you

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.500
decide to do so.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.930
and you think people who
are aware of those risks but not still enough?

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.680
and I think we're getting there I don't
think they're there fully and I think

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.770
when you talk about the business end of
things that are not national

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.380
security-related it's the the dream of
it's the American dream it's the the

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.280
dream of Great Britain to be able to
produce X and sell it globally and I

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.229
think that is the sign of a very healthy
capitalist society our goal is to throw

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.009
a layer on that of national security
what does that mean in US and Great

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.539
Britain and Australia in Canada how is
that impacting our national security my

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:43.590
perspective is our economic security is
our national security so they are

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.880
intertwined all we want companies and
businesses to know is there is a risk

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.880
factor when you go into China to operate.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.960
and your messages think twice?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.580
think

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.960
twice because your data is going to be
available to the Chinese government and

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.740
to intelligence services for whatever
they deem possible.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.740
does it worry you

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.870
though that companies do seem to be
willing to censor what they do to get

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.560
access to the Chinese market because
we're seeing more more cases where

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.259
people perhaps are not talking about
Tibet or Taiwan or some of these issues

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.639
because they want to sell their goods in
China they want to open hotels in China

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.337
they want to make films in China will
sell them to China?

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.440
it's definitely a

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.919
slippery slope and I think it's
problematic from me and I look at it

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:34.560
this says is this something we want to
have going forward as a global society

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.589
where we have a major retailer here in
the US have to apologize to the

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:44.430
government of China because they left
Taiwan off a map of China on the shirt

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.860
when we have a major airline have to
apologize to the Chinese government

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.610
because there's so many markets for the
airline because of

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.980
tweet and and if you look at a major
hotel brand us have to apologize to

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.740
China because of mundane activity I
don't think that is where we want to go

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.170
as a global society when we have to
apologize to countries again if you look

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:16.460
at Hollywood you know - China just ban
Winnie the pooh well now if you look at

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.680
that if we have screenwriters now in the
US and across the world in any capacity

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.950
whether it's Hollywood or in the new
streaming video world have to write

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.110
their screenplays with the long term
vision of selling this in China that's

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.839
the that's the perfect metric for
success by the government of China that

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:41.760
we have self-censorship going on with
the ability for people with the long

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.930
term idea that we're going to sell this
in the global market to include China we

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.730
cannot have anything anti China and our
documentary or a movie or a screenplay

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.380
is very problematic.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.000
you think that's a security risk?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.470
I think the influence part

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.100
of that is a security risk I don't think
that's a national security but again

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.269
it's part of the slippery slope where
you will have self-censorship in a free

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:08.459
society to be able to work and play in
the global economy or in China it's very

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.829
problematic to the morals the values
that we build and are built and we live

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:15.800
by our democratic societies in the West.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.940
so it's a sense in which Chinese

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.700
influence is extending into
self-censorship or into limiting free

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.472
speech you think?

00:10:23.472 --> 00:10:26.240
yes and I think they
already have an influence campaign where

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.880
they censor everything on their own but
when they have a democratic country like

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.000
the US or Great Britain self censoring
early on in a business process that is a

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.180
that is a model of success for China.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.020
because they've exported it without even

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.374
having to pressure a company that will
tell them what to do?

00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:43.080
absolutely we look

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.350
at the last ten years the amount of
movies that are no longer being able to

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.850
be marketed in China because they either
have an issue with China or the

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.860
predication of the show is maybe
negative and it's China based that's

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.510
problematic so when you have
screenwriters now writing in a script

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.459
thinking about well I better not say
this or that or do it this way because I

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.380
don't believe it I sell my video in
China

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.280
that's an amazing success for censorship.
