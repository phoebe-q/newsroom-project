00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.509
he's been talking about it

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.960
since the campaign trail

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.849
do not worry we
are going to build the wall okay

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.380
don't even think of it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.770
well we have been
thinking about it and we have some

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.780
questions

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.240
five to be exact

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.619
first what would Trump's wall actually

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.400
look like?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.490
on the campaign trail in 2015
Trump was clear that his wall was of the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.228
cement block variety

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:36.260
I'll tell you what
it's gonna be made of it's gonna be made of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.998
hardened concrete impenetrable physical
tall, powerful.

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:42.980
but his view started to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.840
shift in the last year the problem is
you have to have see-through you have to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.740
know what's on the other side of the
wall

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.750
more recently Trump has said that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.820
his wall will look more like
artistically designed steel slats you

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.520
can see through.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.140
if I build a steel wall
rather than a concrete wall it will

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.680
actually be stronger than a concrete 
steel is stronger than concrete

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.560
question number two how much of a wall already
exists?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.700
one-third of the us-mexico border

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.100
already has some sort of barrier that is
about 600 miles are already covered with

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.490
a fence the border is 1,900 miles long
the trump's proposed wall would be 1,000

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
miles natural obstacles will take care
of the rest

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420
number three how much will it cost?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.579
in
2017 Trump said it would cost ten

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.170
billion dollars or less
that same year elite homeland security

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
document reported it would cost twenty
one point six billion other estimates

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.020
are much much higher today Trump is
asking Congress for the 5.6 billion is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.720
such a small number which brings us to
question number four

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.440
who is going to pay for this?

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.360
and Mexico will pay for the wall

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.500
we are

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.850
not paying that is stupid wall build it if you want with the US taxpayers money

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.319
he's now said he can get the money from
other government agencies the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.200
president's asked every one of his
cabinet secretaries to look for funding

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.849
that can be used Democrats have pushed
back saying this won't happen without

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.620
congressional approval
speaking of Democrats what do they want

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.802
on the border?

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:29.180
well they say they'd spend some money on

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.459
border security but according to Nancy
Pelosi they're not doing a wall that

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.210
does a body have any doubt that we're
not doing a wall
