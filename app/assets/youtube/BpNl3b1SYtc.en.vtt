00:37:14.578 --> 00:37:19.873
, THE STATES ALLY UKRAINE. 
REVERSE THE NATION'S EMBRACE OF 

00:37:20.616 --> 00:37:27.898
THE WEST AND TO FULFILL PUTIN'S 
DESIRE TO HAVE A RUSSIAN EMPIRE.

00:37:31.225 --> 00:37:33.225
IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS, 14,000 
UKRAINIANS DIED AS THEY BATTLED 

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:38.748
SUPERIOR RUSSIAN FORCES. EARLIER
THIS YEAR, VOLOLDYMYR ZELENSKY 

00:37:38.948 --> 00:37:44.236
WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT TO UKRAINE
TO END CONFLICT AND CORRUPTION. 

00:37:44.437 --> 00:37:47.070
HE WAS A NEWCOMER TO POLITICS 
AND IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT TO 

00:37:47.282 --> 00:37:50.121
ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH 
UKRAINE'S MOST POWERFUL PATRON, 

00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:55.351
THE UNITED STATES. THE QUESTIONS
PRESENTED BY THIS IMPEACHMENT 

00:37:55.526 --> 00:37:59.365
INQUIRY WHETHER THEY SOUGHT TO 
EXPLOIT THE ALLIES VULNERABILITY

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.730
AND INVITE UKRAINE'S 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS 

00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:07.395
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP START TO
CONDITION THE ACT SUCH AS THE 

00:38:07.596 --> 00:38:12.080
WHITE HOUSE MEETING OR MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE AND THE WILLINGNESS 

00:38:12.274 --> 00:38:15.305
TO ASSIST WITH TWO POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WOULD HELP 

00:38:15.516 --> 00:38:20.799
THE REELECTION CAMPAIGN. IF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID EITHER, 

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.434
WHETHER SUCH AN ABUSE OF HIS 
POWER IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE 

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:28.718
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. THE 
MATTER IS AS SIMPLE AND AS 

00:38:28.918 --> 00:38:34.148
TERRIBLE AS THAT. OUR ANSWER TO 
THESE QUESTIONS WILL AFFECT

00:38:38.258 --> 00:38:40.294
NOT ONLY THIS PRESIDENCY BUT THE
FUTURE OF THE PRESIDENCY ITSELF 

00:38:40.495 --> 00:38:43.949
AND WHAT KIND OF CONDUCT OR 
MISCONDUCT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

00:38:44.148 --> 00:38:46.182
MAY COME TO EXPECT FROM THEIR 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF. THERE ARE 

00:38:46.948 --> 00:38:51.266
FEW ACTIONS AS COST CONTROL IS 
ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT. THE 

00:38:51.469 --> 00:38:56.137
FOUNDERS DID NOT INTEND THE 
IMPEACHMENT BE FORD MERE 

00:38:56.339 --> 00:38:58.574
DIFFERENCES IN POLICY BUT THEY 
ALSO MADE A ACCOUNT TO SHOW 

00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:03.656
PROCESS THAT CONGRESS MUST 
UTILIZE AS NECESSARY. THE FACTS 

00:39:03.858 --> 00:39:09.132
IN THE PRESENT INQUIRY ARE NOT 
SERIOUSLY CONTESTED AND 

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.347
BEGINNING IN JANUARY OF THIS 
YEAR, THE PERSONAL ATTORNEY, 

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:15.990
RUDY GIULIANI INVESTIGATED 
CHARISMA, THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST 

00:39:16.162 --> 00:39:22.550
NATURAL GAS PRODUCER IN THE 
BIDENS SINCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE 

00:39:22.752 --> 00:39:28.640
BIDEN WAS SEEN AS A STRONG 
POTENTIAL COMPETITOR TO TRUMP. 

00:39:29.044 --> 00:39:31.383
THEY BUMPED CONSPIRACY THAT IT 
WAS UKRAINE AND NOT RUSSIA

00:39:36.765 --> 00:39:38.803
THAT HACKED THE ELECTIONS AND IT
WAS STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT IT

00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:41.544
WAS RUSSIA AND NOT UKRAINE THAT 
INTERFERED IN OUR ELECTION. 

00:39:41.836 --> 00:39:44.887
GIULIANI BELIEVED THIS 
CONSPIRACY THEORY REFERRED TO AS

00:39:45.636 --> 00:39:52.804
CROWD STRIKE AND THAT WOULD AID 
HIS CLIENTS REELECTION. HE ALSO 

00:39:53.018 --> 00:39:55.810
CONDUCTED A SMEAR CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST THE U. S. AMBASSADOR TO 

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.337
UKRAINE AND ON APRIL 29, AN 
OFFICIAL TOLD HER THAT ALTHOUGH 

00:40:01.548 --> 00:40:05.001
SHE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD LOST 

00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:10.905
CONFIDENCE IN HER. WITH THE 
SIDELINING OF HER, THE SIMON WAS

00:40:11.088 --> 00:40:12.921
SET FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
REGULAR CHANNEL IN WHICH 

00:40:12.922 --> 00:40:17.788
GIULIANI AND OTHERS AND 
INFLUENTIAL DONORS NOW SERVING 

00:40:18.204 --> 00:40:22.057
TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT 
INVENTS THE PRESIDENTS PERSONAL 

00:40:22.474 --> 00:40:29.977
AND POLITICAL INTERESTS. HER 
REPLACEMENT IS A WEST POINT 

00:40:30.392 --> 00:40:32.392
GRADUATE AND VIETNAM VETERAN.

00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:42.980
AND THEY PUSHED BACK WITH 
SECRETARY KENT AND OTHERS FOR 

00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:46.590
THE U. S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AND
FUNDING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF 

00:40:46.764 --> 00:40:48.764
POLITICAL

00:40:51.303 --> 00:40:52.978
FAVORS BY THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT. FAVOR IS INTENDED 

00:40:52.979 --> 00:40:55.319
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WOULD 
UNDERMINE OUR SECURITY AND OUR 

00:40:55.502 --> 00:40:59.836
ELECTIONS. SEVERAL KEY EVENTS IN
THIS GAME TOOK PLACE IN THE 

00:41:00.051 --> 00:41:04.304
MONTH OF JULY AND ON JULY 10, 
THE AMBASSADOR FORMED A GROUP OF

00:41:04.507 --> 00:41:07.155
OFFICIALS MEETING AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE THAT ACCORDING TO THE 

00:41:07.357 --> 00:41:11.624
CHIEF OF STAFF, THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING DESPERATELY SOUGHT BY 

00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:14.876
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WITH 
TRUMP WOULD HAPPEN ONLY IF 

00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:17.648
UKRAINE UNDERTOOK AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE ENERGY 

00:41:17.824 --> 00:41:21.781
SECTOR WHICH WAS UNDERSTOOD TO 
MEAN CHARISMA AND SPECIFICALLY 

00:41:22.538 --> 00:41:26.852
THE BIDENS. NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR ENDED THE MEETING AND 

00:41:27.054 --> 00:41:31.067
SAID AFTERWARDS THAT HE WOULD 
NOT BE "PART OF WHATEVER DRUG 

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.240
DEAL

00:41:34.986 --> 00:41:43.108
YOU ARE COOKING UP ON THIS." A 
WEEK LATER, ON JULY 18, THE 

00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:45.149
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OFFICE 
MANAGEMENT AND THE AGENCY THAT 

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.593
OVERSEES FEDERAL STANDINGS 
ANNOUNCED THAT MULVANEY AT THE 

00:41:48.794 --> 00:41:52.246
DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT WAS 
FREEZING NEARLY $400 MILLION IN 

00:41:53.007 --> 00:41:55.007
SECURITY SYSTEM WITH

00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:01.799
WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE BY CONGRESS
AND THE ENTIRETY OF THE U. S. 

00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:04.235
NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT 
SUPPORTED. ONE WEEK AFTER THAT, 

00:42:04.436 --> 00:42:07.836
DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE THE 
INFAMOUS JULY 25 PHONE CALL WITH

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.961
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. 
TRUMP COMPLAINED THAT THE 

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:17.026
RELATIONSHIP  WITH UKRAINE HAD 
NOT BEEN RECIPROCAL AND LATER 

00:42:17.227 --> 00:42:20.478
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY THANKS  THE 
PRESIDENT AND SAYS THEY ARE 

00:42:21.095 --> 00:42:27.999
READY TO PURCHASE MORE JAVELINS,
AN ANTITANK THAT WAS TO FURTHER 

00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:31.759
RUSSIAN MILITARY ACTION. TRUMPS 
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS

00:42:35.518 --> 00:42:38.073
, "I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A 
FAVOR, THOUGH."

00:42:42.008 --> 00:42:45.922
THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE THE 
CONSPIRACY THEORY AND EVEN MORE 

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:51.149
OMINOUSLY, LOOK INTO THE BIDENS.
NEITHER OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS 

00:42:51.565 --> 00:42:56.837
WAS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 
INTEREST. NEITHER WAS PART OF 

00:42:57.038 --> 00:42:59.227
THE OFFICIAL PREPARATORY 
MATERIAL FOR THE CALL. BOTH 

00:42:59.407 --> 00:43:03.541
HOWEVER WERE IN DONALD TRUMP'S 
PERSONAL INTEREST IN ANY 

00:43:03.744 --> 00:43:07.810
INTEREST OF HIS 2020 REELECTION 
CAMPAIGN IN THE UKRAINIAN 

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:13.498
PRESIDENT KNEW ABOUT BOTH IN 
ADVANCE. OTHERS HAVE BEEN 

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:16.296
PRESSING UKRAINE FOR WEEKS ABOUT
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE 2016 

00:43:16.555 --> 00:43:22.373
ELECTION AMBER'S MOTHER AND THE 
BIDENS. AFTER THE CALL, MULTIPLE

00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:25.283
INDIVIDUALS WERE CONCERNED 
ENOUGH TO REPORTED TO THE 

00:43:25.684 --> 00:43:30.555
NATIONAL SECURITY'S TOP LAWYER. 
THE WHITE HOUSE WITHIN TAKE THE 

00:43:31.306 --> 00:43:34.626
EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF MOVING THE
CALL RECORD TO A HIGHLY 

00:43:34.824 --> 00:43:38.277
CLASSIFIED SERVER EXCLUSIVELY 
RESERVED FOR THE MOST SENSITIVE 

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.562
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS. IN THE 
WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED, AMBASSADOR 

00:43:43.763 --> 00:43:48.232
TAYLOR LEARNED NEW FACTS THAT 
WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BECOMING 

00:43:48.992 --> 00:43:55.751
MORE INSIDIOUS. TAYLOR TESTED 
AND SAYING ARE WE NOW SAYING 

00:43:55.951 --> 00:43:58.138
THAT SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN 
WHITE HOUSE MEETINGS ARE 

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:00.319
CONDITIONS ON INVESTIGATIONS?

00:44:02.658 --> 00:44:08.386
IT KEPT GETTING MORE INSIDIOUS 
AND MR. TAYLOR WHO TOOK NOTES OF

00:44:08.567 --> 00:44:12.358
THE CONVERSATION SAID THE 
INVESTOR TOLD HIM THAT 

00:44:12.532 --> 00:44:17.080
EVERYTHING WAS DEPENDENT ON THE 
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT 

00:44:18.042 --> 00:44:21.338
INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDING 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. PRESIDENT 

00:44:22.102 --> 00:44:27.837
TRUMP WANTED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
IN A PUBLIC  BOX. PRESIDENT 

00:44:28.038 --> 00:44:30.038
TRUMP IS A BUSINESSMAN

00:44:33.325 --> 00:44:35.760
AND WHEN A BUSINESSMAN IS ABOUT 
TO SIGN A CHECK TO SOMEONE WHO 

00:44:35.962 --> 00:44:39.458
OWES HIM SOMETHING, THE 
BUSINESSMAN ASKS THAT PERSON TO 

00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:42.178
PAY UP BEFORE SIGNING THE CHECK.

00:44:46.122 --> 00:44:49.572
IN THIS ONE DECLARATION AFTER 
TAYLOR'S TESTIMONY, SOLOMON 

00:44:49.986 --> 00:44:55.674
WOULD ADMIT TO A MEETING IN 
WARSAW, "A RESUMPTION OF USAID 

00:44:55.874 --> 00:45:00.345
WOULD LIKELY NOT OCCUR UNTIL 
UKRAINE PROVIDED THE PUBLIC 

00:45:01.106 --> 00:45:05.166
ANTICORRUPTION STATEMENT THAT WE
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR MANY 

00:45:05.366 --> 00:45:09.483
WEEKS." THE PRESIDENT CHIEF OF 
STAFF CONFIRMED THAT THEY 

00:45:10.242 --> 00:45:14.767
WITHHELD AID AND WHEN THEY WERE 
ASKED PUBLICLY ABOUT IT, HIS 

00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:21.016
ANSWER WAS BREATHTAKING. "WE DO 
THAT ALL THE TIME WITH FORM 

00:45:21.252 --> 00:45:23.252
POLICY,

00:45:25.928 --> 00:45:28.579
" HE SAID. "I HAVE NEWS FOR 
EVERYBODY, GET OVER IT. THEY 

00:45:28.778 --> 00:45:31.574
WILL BE INFLUENCING FOREIGN 
POLICY. THAT IS GOING TO 

00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:34.579
HAPPEN." THE VIDEO THAT 
CONFESSION IS

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.353
PLAYING FOR ALL TO SEE. SOME 
ARGUED THAT THE AIDE WAS 

00:45:40.552 --> 00:45:42.552
ULTIMATELY RELEASED AND THAT IS 
TRUE.

00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:48.073
BUT, ONLY AFTER CONGRESS BEGAN 
AN INVESTIGATION AND ONLY AFTER 

00:45:48.274 --> 00:45:51.327
THE LAWYERS LEARNED OF A 
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT AND ONLY

00:45:51.527 --> 00:45:54.121
AFTER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEGAN 
ASKING UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS 

00:45:54.291 --> 00:46:00.669
ABOUT QUID PRO QUOS. THE SCHEME 
TO CONDITION OFFICIAL ACTS OR 

00:46:00.868 --> 00:46:04.321
TAXPAYER FUNDING TO OBTAIN A 
PERSONAL BENEFIT HAS NOT BECOME 

00:46:05.084 --> 00:46:08.335
LESS ODIOUS BECAUSE IT IS 
DISCOVERED BEFORE IT IS FULLY 

00:46:08.505 --> 00:46:12.646
CONSUMMATED BUT IN FACT, THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE HAD BEEN 

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.968
DELAYED SO LONG THAT IT WOULD 
TAKE ANOTHER ACT OF CONGRESS TO 

00:46:16.146 --> 00:46:21.185
ENSURE THAT IT COULD STILL GO 
OUT. THAT OVAL OFFICE MEETING 

00:46:22.136 --> 00:46:26.213
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SOUGHT  
STILL HAS NOT HAPPENED. WE HAVE 

00:46:26.387 --> 00:46:28.387
LEARNED

00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:32.360
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THESE EVENTS 
IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS BUT 

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.046
THERE ARE STILL MISSING PIECES. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS INSTRUCTED THE

00:46:35.218 --> 00:46:37.382
STATE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER 
AGENCIES TO IGNORE SUBPOENAS FOR

00:46:37.557 --> 00:46:41.410
DOCUMENTS. HE HAS INSTRUCTED 
WITNESSES TO HAVE SUBPOENAS AND 

00:46:42.255 --> 00:46:49.417
REFUSED TO APPEAR AND HE HAS 
SUGGESTED THAT THOSE EXPOSED 

00:46:49.616 --> 00:46:52.268
WRONGDOING SHOULD BE TREATED 
LIKE TRAITORS AND SPIES. THESE 

00:46:52.468 --> 00:46:54.547
ACTIONS WILL FORCE CONGRESS TO 
CONSIDER AS IT DID WITH RESIDENT

00:46:55.262 --> 00:46:57.134
NEXT AND WHETHER TRUMPS 
OBSTRUCTION OF THE 

00:46:57.135 --> 00:46:59.370
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES 
CONSTITUTED ADDITIONAL GROUNDS 

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.990
FOR IMPEACHMENT. IF THE 
PRESIDENT CAN SIMPLY REFUSE ALL 

00:47:04.169 --> 00:47:06.624
OVERSIGHT AND PARTICULARLY IN 
THE CONTEXT OF AN IMPEACHMENT 

00:47:06.797 --> 00:47:10.493
PROCEEDING, THE BALANCE OF POWER
BETWEEN OUR TWO BRANCHES OF 

00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:13.325
GOVERNMENT WILL BE IRREVOCABLY 
ALTERED.

00:47:17.246 --> 00:47:21.516
THAT IS NOT WHAT THE FOUNDERS 
INTENDED AND THE PROSPECTS FOR 

00:47:21.716 --> 00:47:24.007
FURTHER CORRUPTION AND ABUSE OF 
POWER WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION 

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:29.640
OR ANY OTHER WILL BE 
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED. THIS IS

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.679
WHAT WE BELIEVE THE TESTIMONY 
WILL SHOW BOTH AS TO THE 

00:47:33.427 --> 00:47:37.200
PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT AND AS TO 
HIS OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. THE

00:47:37.375 --> 00:47:42.028
ISSUE THAT WE CONFRONT IS THE 
ONE POSED BY THE PRESIDENT 

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:46.635
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF WHEN HE 
CHALLENGED AMERICANS TO GET OVER

00:47:46.807 --> 00:47:51.783
IT. IF WE FIND THAT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:54.422
ABUSED HIS POWER AND INVITED 
INTERFERENCE INTO OUR ELECTIONS 

00:47:54.622 --> 00:48:00.108
OR SOUGHT TO CONDITION OR COERCE
OR EXTORT OR BRIBE AN ALLY INTO 

00:48:00.355 --> 00:48:03.561
LOOKING INTO INVESTIGATIONS FOR 
HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN AND DID 

00:48:04.321 --> 00:48:10.616
SO WHY WITHHOLDING ACTS, WITH 
NEEDED MILITARY AID, MUST WE 

00:48:10.863 --> 00:48:15.951
SIMPLY GET OVER IT? IS THIS WHAT
AMERICA SHOULD NOW EXPECT FROM 

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:24.072
THEIR PRESIDENT? IF THIS IS NOT 
IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT, WHAT IS? AS

00:48:24.273 --> 00:48:26.273
THE OATH OF OFFICE ITSELF

00:48:29.358 --> 00:48:31.216
REQUIRING THAT OUR LAWS BE 
FAITHFULLY EXECUTED THAT OUR 

00:48:31.217 --> 00:48:32.607
PRESIDENT DEFENDED THE 
CONSTITUTION THAT BALANCES THE 

00:48:32.608 --> 00:48:37.078
POWERS OF ITS BRANCHES PUTTING 
AMBITION AGAINST AMBITION, WE 

00:48:37.682 --> 00:48:39.682
HAVE NO MONARCHY

00:48:42.762 --> 00:48:44.798
BUT STILL HAVE MEETINGS. THESE 
ARE THE QUESTIONS WE MUST ASK 

00:48:44.998 --> 00:48:48.560
AND ANSWER WITHOUT RANK IF WE 
CAN AND WITHOUT DELAY REGARDLESS

00:48:50.068 --> 00:48:55.557
AND WITHOUT PARTY FAVOR AND 
WITHOUT PREJUDICE IF WE ARE TRUE

00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:59.011
TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. 
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WAS ASKED WHAT

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:03.891
KIND OF A COUNTRY AMERICA WAS TO
BECOME. A REPUBLIC HE ANSWERED 

00:49:04.092 --> 00:49:07.344
IF YOU CAN KEEP IT. FUNDAMENTAL 
ISSUE RAISED BY IMPEACHMENT 

00:49:08.101 --> 00:49:13.791
INQUIRY INTO THE HOLIDAY TRUMP 
IS AND WE KEEP IT AND I 

00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:20.692
RECOGNIZE ANY REMARKS YOU MAY 
WISH TO MAKE. 

00:49:20.693 --> 00:49:27.803
&gt;&gt;  THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. AND 
HOPE AND OPEN HEARING, THE 

00:49:27.974 --> 00:49:33.143
DEMOCRATS ENGAGED IN THE LAST 
DITCH EFFORT TO CONVINCE THE 

00:49:33.826 --> 00:49:39.433
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS A RUSSIAN AGENT. THIS 

00:49:39.633 --> 00:49:42.430
WAS A THREE YEAR LONG OPERATION 
BY THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CURRENT 

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:47.358
MEDIA IN PERSON BUREAUCRATS TO 
OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF A 2016 

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:54.877
ELECTION. AFTER THE SPECTACULAR 
IMPLOSION OF RUSSIAN HOPES ON 

00:49:55.078 --> 00:49:57.713
JULY 24 IN WHICH THEY SPENT 
YEARS ANNOUNCING ANY HOW CAN 

00:49:57.914 --> 00:50:03.601
THAT SHOOK HANDS WITH THE 
RUSSIAN AND ON JULY 25, THEY 

00:50:03.815 --> 00:50:07.604
TURNED ON A DIME AND NOW CLAIM 
THAT THE REAL MALFEASANCE IS 

00:50:07.772 --> 00:50:13.154
REPUBLICAN FEELINGS WITH UKRAINE
AND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, WE 

00:50:13.354 --> 00:50:17.825
ARE ASKED TO SIMPLY FORGET ABOUT
DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND 

00:50:18.027 --> 00:50:20.027
CLAIMING THEY HAD MORE THAN 
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF 

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:24.930
COLLUSION BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND RUSSIANS. WE SHOULD 

00:50:25.131 --> 00:50:28.943
FORGET ABOUT THEM READING 
FABRICATIONS OF RUSHING 

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:35.701
COLLUSION FROM THE DOSSIER INTO 
THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. WE 

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.551
SHOULD ALSO FORGET ABOUT THEM 
TRYING TO OBTAIN NUDE PICTURES 

00:50:39.316 --> 00:50:41.316
OF TRUMP

00:50:43.007 --> 00:50:45.038
WHO PRETENDED TO BE UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS. WE SHOULD FORGET 

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:50.928
ABOUT THEM. MAKING A FALSE STORY
TO CNN WHILE HE WAS STILL 

00:50:51.143 --> 00:50:54.500
TESTIFYING TO THE CLAIMING THAT 
DONALD TRUMP JR. WAS COLLUDING 

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:58.851
WITH WIKILEAKS AND FORGET ABOUT 
COUNTLESS OTHER DECEPTIONS LARGE

00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:03.679
AND SMALL THAT MAKE THEM THE 
LAST PEOPLE ON EARTH WITH THE 

00:51:03.856 --> 00:51:05.856
CREDIBILITY

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.439
FOR THE PREPOSTEROUS ACCUSATIONS
OF THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENT. 

00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:16.929
YET, NOW, HERE WE ARE. WE ARE 
SUPPOSED TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE AT

00:51:17.694 --> 00:51:20.393
FACE VALUE WHEN THEY TROT OUT A 
NEW BATCH OF ALLEGATIONS AND 

00:51:21.152 --> 00:51:24.648
ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THE WAR 
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD 

00:51:24.863 --> 00:51:29.532
NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE ALL THE 
TYPICAL SIGNS THAT THIS IS A 

00:51:29.733 --> 00:51:33.702
CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED MEDIA 
SMEAR CAMPAIGN. FOR EXAMPLE

00:51:37.454 --> 00:51:39.454
, AFTER BROWN PUBLICLY THAT 
IMPEACHMENT REQUIRES BIPARTISAN 

00:51:39.674 --> 00:51:42.324
SUPPORT, DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING 
IMPEACHMENT FORWARD WITHOUT THE 

00:51:42.526 --> 00:51:45.977
BACKING OF THE SENIOR 
REPUBLICAN. THE WITNESS IS 

00:51:46.727 --> 00:51:53.697
DEEMED SUITABLE WERE PUT THROUGH
A CLOSED DOOR PROCESS IN A 

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.763
CULTLIKE ATMOSPHERE IN THE 
BASEMENT OF THE CAPITOL WHERE 

00:51:58.164 --> 00:52:02.032
DEMOCRATS CONDUCTED SECRET 
DEPOSITIONS AND RELEASED A FLOOD

00:52:02.231 --> 00:52:05.484
OF MISLEADING AND ONE-SIDED 
LEAKS AND LATER SELECTIVELY 

00:52:06.242 --> 00:52:10.078
RELEASE TRANSCRIPTS IN A HIGHLY 
PHASED MANNER.

00:52:13.607 --> 00:52:15.225
VIOLATING THEIR OWN GUIDELINES, 
DEMOCRATS REDACTED FROM THE 

00:52:15.226 --> 00:52:19.297
TRANSCRIPT THE NAME OF THE 
CONTRACTOR FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 

00:52:20.042 --> 00:52:24.779
NATIONAL COMMITTEE WHO WORKED 
WITH UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS TO 

00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:33.102
COLLECT DIRT ON THE CAMPAIGN. 
THE DEMOCRATS REJECTED MOST OF 

00:52:33.306 --> 00:52:37.773
THE WITNESSES REQUEST RESULTING 
IN A ONE-SIDED PROCESS FOR THE 

00:52:38.526 --> 00:52:42.458
CRUCIAL WITNESSES ON THE 
PLATFORM IF THE TESTIMONY DOES 

00:52:43.218 --> 00:52:47.530
NOT SUPPORT THE ABSURD 
ACCUSATION. NOTABLY, THEY ARE 

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:52.603
TRYING TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT 
FOR INQUIRING ABOUT HUNTER 

00:52:53.351 --> 00:52:57.028
BIDEN'S ACTIVITIES. IF THEY 
REFUSE OUR REQUEST TO HEAR FROM 

00:52:57.198 --> 00:53:02.769
BIDEN HIMSELF. THE WHISTLEBLOWER
WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE A BIAS 

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:06.364
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
ATTORNEY HAD TO AGAINST THE 

00:53:06.635 --> 00:53:11.289
PRESIDENT AND CALLED FOR HIS 
IMPEACHMENT. JUST WEEKS AFTER 

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.759
THE ELECTION. AT A PRIOR HEARING
, DEMOCRATS ON THE COMMITTEE 

00:53:16.508 --> 00:53:19.425
RIGHT OUT A PURELY FICTITIOUS 
RENDITION OF THE PRESENCE PHONE 

00:53:20.187 --> 00:53:24.293
CALL WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND
THEY CLEARLY FOUND THE REAL 

00:53:24.493 --> 00:53:28.763
CONVERSATION  TO BE INSUFFICIENT
FOR THE IMPEACHMENT NARRATIVE. 

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:34.449
THEY JUST MADE UP A NEW ONE. 
MOST EGREGIOUSLY, STAFF OF THE 

00:53:34.648 --> 00:53:36.845
DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE HAD 
DIRECT DISCUSSION WITH THE 

00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:40.756
WHISTLEBLOWER FOR HIS OR HER 
COMPLAINT THAT WAS ADMITTED TO 

00:53:40.953 --> 00:53:45.623
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. 
REPUBLICANS CAN'T GET A FULL 

00:53:45.826 --> 00:53:51.517
ACCOUNT OF THE CONTACTS BECAUSE 
DEMOCRATS BROKE THEIR PROMISE 

00:53:51.918 --> 00:53:54.151
AND MEMBERS HID THESE CONTACTS 
FROM REPUBLICANS AND THEN LIED 

00:53:54.914 --> 00:53:59.636
ABOUT THEM TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. I

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.918
HAVE NOTED BEFORE THAT DEMOCRATS
HAVE A LONG HABIT OF ACCUSING 

00:54:05.116 --> 00:54:08.929
REPUBLICANS OF OFFENSES THEY 
THEMSELVES ARE COMMITTING. LET'S

00:54:09.107 --> 00:54:11.107
RECALL

00:54:14.052 --> 00:54:16.052
FOR YEARS, THEY ACCUSED THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN OF COLLUDING WITH

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.086
RUSSIA WHEN THEY THEMSELVES WERE
COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA BY FUNDING

00:54:18.119 --> 00:54:22.387
AND SPREADING THE DOSSIER THAT 
RELIED ON RUSSIAN SOURCES AND 

00:54:22.588 --> 00:54:24.824
NOW THEY ACCUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP
OF MALFEASANCE IN UKRAINE WHEN 

00:54:25.585 --> 00:54:30.109
THEY THEMSELVES ARE CULPABLE. 
THE DEMOCRATS COOPERATED IN THE 

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:34.778
ELECTION MEDDLING AND DEFEND 
HUNTER BIDEN SECURING OF A 

00:54:34.978 --> 00:54:38.848
LAVISHLY PAID POSITION WITH A 
CORRUPT UKRAINIAN COMPANY. ALL 

00:54:39.047 --> 00:54:41.791
WHILE HIS FATHER SERVED AS VICE 
PRESIDENT.

00:54:46.767 --> 00:54:48.767
DESPITE THIS HYPOCRISY, 
DEMOCRATS ARE ADVANCING THE 

00:54:49.336 --> 00:54:53.077
IMPEACHMENT SHAM BUT WE SHOULD 
NOT HOLD ANY HEARINGS AT ALL 

00:54:53.247 --> 00:54:56.843
UNTIL WE GET ANSWERS TO THREE 
CRUCIAL QUESTIONS

00:55:03.212 --> 00:55:05.212
THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE AVOIDED 
ASKING. FIRST, WHAT IS THE FULL 

00:55:05.243 --> 00:55:07.243
EXTENT OF THE PRIOR COORDINATION
OF THE DEMOCRATS WITH THE 

00:55:07.278 --> 00:55:10.526
WHISTLEBLOWER AND WHO ELSE DID 
THE WHISTLEBLOWER CHORDATE THIS 

00:55:10.729 --> 00:55:15.612
EFFORT WITH? SECOND, WHAT IS THE
FULL EXTENT OF THE ELECTION 

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:20.841
MEDDLING AGAINST THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN? THIRD, WHY DID THEY 

00:55:21.016 --> 00:55:27.188
HIRE HUNTER BIDEN AND WHAT DID 
HE DO FOR THEM AND DID HIS 

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.390
POSITION AFFECT ANY U. S. 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS UNDER THE 

00:55:29.758 --> 00:55:31.758
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

00:55:34.092 --> 00:55:35.719
THESE QUESTIONS WILL REMAIN 
OUTSTANDING BECAUSE ORGANS WERE 

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.904
DENIED THE RIGHT TO CALL 
WITNESSES THAT KNOW THESE 

00:55:38.078 --> 00:55:41.958
ANSWERS. WHAT WE WITNESS TODAY 
IS A TELEVISED THEATRICAL 

00:55:42.133 --> 00:55:47.086
PERFORMANCE STAGED BY THE 
DEMOCRATS. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR AND

00:55:47.849 --> 00:55:51.354
MR. KENT, I WOULD LIKE TO 
WELCOME YOU HERE AND 

00:55:52.116 --> 00:55:54.116
CONGRATULATE YOU

00:55:55.825 --> 00:55:59.209
FOR HAVING THE STAR ADDITIONS 
HELD IN THE BASEMENT OF THE 

00:55:59.384 --> 00:56:01.384
CAPITOL. IT SEEMS YOU AGREED

00:56:04.562 --> 00:56:06.585
WHAT HE OR UNWITTINGLY TO 
PARTICIPATE IN A DRAMA BUT THE 

00:56:07.335 --> 00:56:12.429
MAIN PERFORMANCE, THE RUSSIAN 
HOAX HAS ENDED AND YOU HAVE BEEN

00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:17.795
CAST IN THE UKRAINIAN SEQUEL. I 
WILL CONCLUDE BY NOTING THE 

00:56:18.507 --> 00:56:23.194
IMMENSE DAMAGE THE BUREAUCRACY 
HAS DONE TO AMERICAN SPACE AND 

00:56:23.364 --> 00:56:25.364
GOVERNMENT

00:56:26.907 --> 00:56:28.325
THOUGH EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
EMPLOYEES ARE CHARGED WITH 

00:56:28.326 --> 00:56:31.162
IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY SET BY 
OUR PRESIDENT WHO WAS ELECTED 

00:56:31.577 --> 00:56:34.414
AND RESPONSIBLE TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. ELEMENTS OF CIVIL 

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:39.445
SERVICE HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY, 
NOT THE PRESIDENT ARE REALLY IN 

00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:43.270
CHARGE. AS WE WILL LEARN IN 
THESE HEARINGS

00:56:47.822 --> 00:56:49.654
AFTER EXPRESSING SKEPTICISM OF 
FOREIGN AID AND CONCERN ABOUT 

00:56:49.655 --> 00:56:51.620
FOREIGN CORRUPTION ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

00:56:51.621 --> 00:56:54.067
OUTRAGED THE BUREAUCRACY BY 
ACTING SKEPTICALLY ABOUT FOREIGN

00:56:54.242 --> 00:56:59.805
AID IN EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT
FOREIGN CORRUPTION. OFFICIALS 

00:57:00.006 --> 00:57:03.256
ALARMED THAT IT IS THE 
PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS BASED ON 

00:57:03.672 --> 00:57:07.257
SECONDHAND OR THIRDHAND OR EVEN 
FOURTH HAND RUMORS AND 

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:12.609
INNUENDOS. THEY BELIEVED IT WAS 
AN OUTRAGE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO 

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:15.977
FIRE AN AMBASSADOR EVEN THOUGH 
THE PRESIDENT HAS FULL AUTHORITY

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.276
TO RETAIN OR REMOVE DIPLOMATS 
FOR ANY REASON AT ANY TIME.

00:57:26.017 --> 00:57:28.017
OFFICIALS SO THE SURPRISING LACK
OF INTEREST IN THE INDICATIONS 

00:57:28.037 --> 00:57:30.037
OF UKRAINIAN ELECTION MEDDLING 
THAT DEEPLY CONCERN THE 

00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:35.756
PRESIDENT AT HIS PLEASURE THEY 
SERVE. DESPITE ALL THEIR 

00:57:35.971 --> 00:57:42.262
DISHONEST SATISFACTION WITH THE 
POLICIES, THEY APPROVED THE 

00:57:42.462 --> 00:57:45.917
WEAPONS TO UKRAINE UNLIKE THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATOR WHICH 

00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:52.824
PROVIDED BLANKETS AS DEFENSE 
AGAINST INVADING RUSSIA. BY 

00:57:53.025 --> 00:57:58.510
UNDERMINING THE PRESIDENT WHOM 
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING,

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:00.742
THE ELEMENTS OF THE FBI AND 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND NOW 

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.553
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE LOST 
THE CONFIDENCE OF MILLIONS OF 

00:58:04.722 --> 00:58:07.779
AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR
VOTE SHOULD COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

00:58:09.684 --> 00:58:13.383
IT WILL TAKE YEARS IF NOT 
DECADES TO RESTORE FAITH IN 

00:58:14.085 --> 00:58:18.218
THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS 
SPECTACLE IS DOING GREAT DAMAGE 

00:58:18.419 --> 00:58:24.517
TO OUR COUNTRY. NOTHING MORE 
THAN AN IMPEACHMENT PROCESS AND 

00:58:24.719 --> 00:58:31.620
A SEARCH OF A CRIME. I YIELD 
BACK. 

00:58:31.621 --> 00:58:36.909
&gt;&gt; TODAY WE ARE JOINED BY

YOU WERE PRESENT FOR SOME OF 
THEM. 

01:02:13.634 --> 01:02:18.516
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  THE ONLY TIME I PREVENTED 

01:02:18.715 --> 01:02:20.546
WITNESSES FROM ANSWERING 
QUESTIONS ALONG WITH THE COUNCIL

01:02:20.547 --> 01:02:25.828
WAS WHEN IT WAS APPARENT THAT 
MEMBERS WERE SEEKING TO OUT THE 

01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:27.683
WHISTLEBLOWER. WE WILL DO 
EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO PROTECT 

01:02:27.684 --> 01:02:30.297
THE WHISTLEBLOWERS IDENTITY AND 
I AM DISTURBED TO HEAR MEMBERS 

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:35.117
OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE IN THE
PAST VOICED STRONG SUPPORT FOR 

01:02:35.327 --> 01:02:38.357
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS TO 
UNDERMINE THOSE PROTECTIONS BY 

01:02:38.535 --> 01:02:43.706
OUTING THE WHISTLEBLOWER. 
&gt;&gt; ONLY ONE MEMBER  AND THE 

01:02:43.911 --> 01:02:45.911
STAFF ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS 
DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE IDENTITY

01:02:45.939 --> 01:02:48.005
OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER. 
&gt;&gt;  THERE IS A PARLIAMENTARY 

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:52.224
INQUIRY AND I'M RESPONDING FOR 
POINT OF ORDER. WE WILL NOT 

01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:54.257
PERMIT THE OUTING OF THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER AND QUESTIONS 

01:02:54.258 --> 01:02:56.258
ALONG THOSE LINES

01:02:58.938 --> 01:03:00.972
WILL INFORM CLIENTS NOT TO 
RESPOND TO IT IF NECESSARY I 

01:03:01.174 --> 01:03:06.466
WILL INTERVENE. OTHERWISE, I 
WANT MEMBERS TO FILL FREE TO ASK

01:03:06.656 --> 01:03:09.450
ANY QUESTIONS THEY WOULD LIKE. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE A MOTION.  

01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:15.590
&gt;&gt;  THE GENTLEMAN IS NOT 
RECOGNIZED. 

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:18.440
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN? 
&gt;&gt; I AM  RESPONDING TO POINT OF 

01:03:18.639 --> 01:03:22.226
ORDER OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER ANY 

01:03:22.397 --> 01:03:26.359
QUESTIONS. IS? 
&gt;&gt; TO MAKE A MOTION THAT WE 

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:31.228
SUBPOENA  THE WHISTLEBLOWER FOR 
A CLOSED-DOOR SECRET DEPOSITION 

01:03:31.429 --> 01:03:33.663
SO THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT 
SHOULD BE ASKED BY OUR SIGN IN 

01:03:33.878 --> 01:03:37.457
YOUR SIDE MAY BE ASKED AND I 
WOULD PREFER THAT RATHER THAN

01:03:42.003 --> 01:03:44.020
BE YOUR SINGLE DECISION THAT THE
COMMITTEE SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE 

01:03:44.235 --> 01:03:48.703
RATHER THAN JUST THE CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; IT WON'T BE MY SINGLE 

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.186
DECISION.  WE WILL ENTERTAIN A 
MOTION TO SUBPOENA ANY WITNESS 

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:58.241
BUT AFTER THE WITNESSES HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. 

01:03:58.242 --> 01:04:02.341
&gt;&gt; THAT MOTION WILL BE IN ORDER.
&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE  EXTENDED. 

01:04:02.342 --> 01:04:05.206
&gt;&gt; DO YOU ANTICIPATE WHEN WE 
WOULD VOTE ON THAT ? 

01:04:05.207 --> 01:04:07.797
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A CLARIFYING 
QUESTION.  DO YOU ANTICIPATE 

01:04:07.996 --> 01:04:11.249
WILL MIGHT VOTE ON THE ABILITY 
TO HAVE THE WHISTLEBLOWER IN 

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:15.718
FRONT OF US AND SOMETHING YOU, 
THE 435 MEMBERS, YOU ARE THE 

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:20.186
ONLY MEMBERS THAT KNOW WHO THAT 
INDIVIDUAL IS AND YOUR STAFF IS 

01:04:20.387 --> 01:04:23.312
THE ONLY STAFF THAT HAS A CHANCE
TO TALK TO THE INDIVIDUAL. WE 

01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:26.413
WOULD LIKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. 
WHEN MIGHT THAT HAPPENED?

01:04:31.962 --> 01:04:34.600
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT AND
I DO NOT KNOW THE IDENTITY OF 

01:04:34.814 --> 01:04:36.633
THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND I'M 
DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE THE 

01:04:36.634 --> 01:04:41.922
IDENTITY IS PROTECTED . AS I 
SAID TO MR. CONAWAY, YOU WILL 

01:04:42.123 --> 01:04:44.123
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AFTER THE 
WITNESSES TESTIFY TO MAKE A 

01:04:44.157 --> 01:04:47.944
MOTION TO SUBPOENA ANY WITNESS 
AND COMPEL A VOTE. WE NOW 

01:04:48.126 --> 01:04:55.076
RECOGNIZE THE WITNESSES AND 
BEFORE I DO, I WANT TO JUST 

01:04:55.252 --> 01:04:59.587
EMPHASIZE THE MICROPHONES ARE 
SENSITIVE SO PLEASE SPEAK 

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.653
DIRECTLY INTO THEM. YOUR WIT 
WRITTEN STATEMENTS WILL BE A 

01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:08.526
PART OF THE RECORD AND WITH IT, 
SECRETARY KENT, YOU ARE 

01:05:08.728 --> 01:05:12.795

STATEMENT AND INVESTOR TAYLOR, 

01:05:13.553 --> 01:05:19.209
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED REALLY AFTER.
&gt;&gt;  GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS

GEORGE KENT AND I'M THE CENTURY

THE CAUCUSES. I HAVE SERVED 
PROBABLY AS A NONPARTISAN 

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:34.682
OFFICER FOR MORE THAN 27 YEARS. 
THREE REPUBLICANS AND TWO 

01:05:34.857 --> 01:05:37.775
DEMOCRATS. AS I MENTIONED IN MY 
OPENING COMMENTS LAST MONTH IN 

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.976
THE CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITION

01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:45.094
, I WILL PRESENT THE THIRD 
GENERATION OF MY FAMILY WHO HAVE

01:05:45.294 --> 01:05:47.328
CHOSEN A CAREER IN PUBLIC 
SERVICE AND SWORN THE OATH OF 

01:05:47.529 --> 01:05:52.199
OFFICE THAT ALL U. S. PUBLIC 
SERVANTS DO IN DEFENSE OF OUR 

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.685
CONSTITUTION. INDEED, THERE HAS 
BEEN A GEORGE KENT  SWORN TO 

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.087
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION FOR 
NEARLY 60 YEARS AND EVER SINCE 

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.606
MY FATHER WARDED AND AFTER 
GRADUATING FIRST IN HIS NAVAL 

01:06:05.808 --> 01:06:10.892
ACADEMY CLASS IN 1965, THE YEAR 
BEST KNOWN FOR HIS-WEDDING, MY 

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:16.578
FATHER SERVED A FULL HONORABLE 
30 YEARS INCLUDING AS A CAPTAIN 

01:06:16.981 --> 01:06:22.466
OF A BALLISTIC SUBMARINE DURING 
THE HEIGHT OF THE WAR. FIVE 

01:06:22.668 --> 01:06:24.902
GREAT UNCLE SERVED HONORABLY IN 
THE NAVY AND ARMY IN WORLD WAR 

01:06:25.102 --> 01:06:29.987

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:36.276
THE TIME OF PEARL HARBOR. HE

01:06:36.476 --> 01:06:39.328
JAPANESE PRISONER OF WAR CAMP

01:06:39.527 --> 01:06:44.397
AS AND THEREFORE JUDGE ADVOCATE 
UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW UNTIL 

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:48.063
HIS DEATH IN 1965. TODAY, I 
APPEAR BEFORE YOU ONCE AGAIN 

01:06:48.263 --> 01:06:52.332
UNDER SUBPOENA AS A FACT WITNESS
READY TO ANSWER ALL OF YOUR 

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:55.091
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EVENTS IN

01:06:58.217 --> 01:07:00.217
DEVELOPMENT EXAMINED IN THIS 
INQUIRY. TO THE BEST OF MY 

01:07:00.255 --> 01:07:03.651
ABILITY AND RECOLLECTION, 
SUBJECT TO THE EVENTS PLACED ON 

01:07:03.939 --> 01:07:08.777
ME AND THE LAW. I WILL BEGIN 
WITH OPENING COMMENTS ON THE KEY

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:11.541
PRINCIPLES AT THE HEART OF WHAT 
BRINGS ME BEFORE YOU TODAY.

01:07:15.474 --> 01:07:17.474
WITH THE PRINCIPAL PUBLIC 
SERVICE IN PURSUIT OF OUR 

01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:19.957
NATIONAL INTEREST IN THE PLACE 
OF UKRAINE AND THE NATIONAL 

01:07:20.722 --> 01:07:25.848
SECURITY INTEREST. THE PAST FIVE
YEARS WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR UNITED

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:28.887
EFFORTS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO 
SUPPORT UKRAINE IN THE FIGHT AND

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.354
CAUSE OF FREEDOM IN THE REBIRTH 
OF FREE OF RUSSIAN DOMINION IN 

01:07:33.554 --> 01:07:37.974
THE WORK LEGACY OF SOVIET 
INSTITUTIONS AND POST-SOVIET 

01:07:38.144 --> 01:07:43.924
BEHAVIOR. AS I STATED IN MY 
CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITION, WE DON'T

01:07:44.123 --> 01:07:46.123
STEP INTO THE PUBLIC ARENA OF 
INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY AND 

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:52.245
ACTIVE PURSUIT OF PRINCIPLE U. 
S. INTEREST WITHOUT EXPECTING 

01:07:52.446 --> 01:07:54.479
VIGOROUS PUSHBACK INCLUDING 
PERSONAL ATTACKS. SUCH ATTACKS 

01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:00.367
CAME FROM THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR
PROXIES AND CORRUPT UKRAINIANS. 

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.770
THAT TELLS ME OUR EFFORTS WERE 
HITTING THEIR MARK. IT WAS 

01:08:03.939 --> 01:08:07.685
UNEXPECTED AND MOST UNFORTUNATE 
HOWEVER TO WHAT SOME AMERICANS 

01:08:08.446 --> 01:08:11.899
INCLUDING THOSE WHO ALIGN 
THEMSELVES WITH CORRUPT 

01:08:12.068 --> 01:08:16.820
UKRAINIANS IN PURSUIT TO PRIVATE
AGENDAS AND LAUNCH ATTACKS ON 

01:08:17.033 --> 01:08:19.413
DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS 
ADVANCING U. S. SERVICE IN 

01:08:19.578 --> 01:08:24.608
UKRAINE. IN MY OPINION, THOSE 
ATTACKS UNDERMINE U. S. AND 

01:08:24.784 --> 01:08:28.352
UKRAINIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS AND
DAMAGE THE CRITICAL BILATERAL 

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.479
RELATIONSHIP. THE UNITED STATES 
HAS A CLEAR NATIONAL INTEREST AT

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:39.365
STAKE IN UKRAINE SUCCESS IS VERY
MUCH IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST IN

01:08:39.579 --> 01:08:43.032
THE WAY WE HAVE DEFINED OUR 
INTEREST PROBABLY IN EUROPE FOR 

01:08:43.231 --> 01:08:47.043
THE PAST 75 YEARS. AFTER WORLD 
WAR II, U. S. LEADERSHIP 

01:08:47.222 --> 01:08:51.765
FURTHERED THE CITED POLICY LIKE 
THE MARSHALL PLAN IN THE 

01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:54.202
CREATION OF A RULES-BASED 
INTERNATIONAL ORDER. PROTECTED 

01:08:54.401 --> 01:08:58.467
BY THE COLLECTIVE SECURITY 
PROVIDED BY NATO AND WESTERN 

01:08:58.668 --> 01:09:03.681
EUROPE RECOVERED AND THRIVED AND
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHADOW OF 

01:09:03.857 --> 01:09:09.025
THE IRON CURTAIN. THE SECURITY 
AND PROSPERITY CONTRIBUTED TO 

01:09:09.226 --> 01:09:11.226
OUR SECURITY AND PROSPERITY

01:09:14.107 --> 01:09:16.141
IN THE SUPPORT OF SUCCESS ALSO 
FIT SQUARELY INTO OUR STRATEGY 

01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:21.210
FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE 
SINCE THE FALL OF THE WALL 30 

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:26.492
YEARS AGO THIS PAST WEEK. A 
EUROPE TRULY AT PEACE. OUR 

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:30.359
STRATEGIC AIM FOR THE ENTIRETY 
OF MY CAREER IS NOT POSSIBLE 

01:09:30.559 --> 01:09:36.448
WITHOUT A UKRAINE FREE AND AT 
PEACE INCLUDING TERRITORIES 

01:09:36.862 --> 01:09:40.662
CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY RUSSIA 
REPRESENTED BY THE RED IN THE 

01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:44.985
MAP. LOOKING FORWARD, THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION'S NATIONAL 

01:09:45.742 --> 01:09:48.324
SECURITY STRATEGY MAKES CLEAR 
THAT GLOBAL STRATEGIC CHALLENGE 

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.302
IS NOW BEFORE US. GREAT POWER 
COMPETITION WITH RIVALS SUCH AS 

01:09:53.516 --> 01:09:57.166
RUSSIA AND CHINA AND THE NEED TO
COMPETE FOR POSITIVE INFLUENCE 

01:09:57.368 --> 01:09:59.368
WITHOUT TAKING COUNTRIES FOR 
GRANTED.

01:10:02.455 --> 01:10:04.892
IN THAT SENSE, UKRAINE HAS BEEN 
ON THE FRONT LINES AND NOT JUST 

01:10:05.296 --> 01:10:07.296
OF RUSSIA'S CONVENTIONAL WAR IN 
EASTERN EUROPE SINCE 2014 AND 

01:10:07.346 --> 01:10:10.577
THE BROADER CAMPAIGN OF 
INFLUENCE BUT AS A GREATER 

01:10:11.336 --> 01:10:15.657
POLITICAL CHALLENGE NOW FACING 
THE UNITED STATES. UKRAINE'S 

01:10:15.858 --> 01:10:20.663
POPULAR REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY IN
2014 FORCED A CORRUPT RUSSIAN 

01:10:20.834 --> 01:10:27.569
LEADERSHIP TO FULLY TO MOSCOW. 
AFTER THAT, RUSSIAN INVADED 

01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:31.736
UKRAINE DOCUMENTING 7% OF THE 
TERRITORY ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO 

01:10:31.912 --> 01:10:36.568
THE SIZE OF TEXAS IN THE UNITED 
STATES. AT THAT TIME, 

01:10:36.784 --> 01:10:41.854
INSTITUTIONS WERE ON THE VERGE 
OF COLLAPSE. UKRAINIAN CIVIL 

01:10:42.054 --> 01:10:45.241
SOCIETY ENTERED THE CHALLENGE 
AND FORMED VOLUNTEER BATTALIONS 

01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:49.374
INCLUDING PROFESSIONALS AND 
MEDICS WITH THE CROWD SOURCED 

01:10:49.575 --> 01:10:55.060
FUNDING OF THEIR OWN WEAPONS AND
BODY ARMOR AND SUPPLIES. THEY 

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.260
WERE THE 21ST-CENTURY UKRAINIAN 
EQUIVALENT OF HER OWN MINUTEMEN 

01:10:57.651 --> 01:11:04.608
OF 1776. BUYING TIME FOR A 
REGULAR ARMY TO CONSTITUTE AND 

01:11:04.809 --> 01:11:06.809
SINCE THEN, MORE THAN 13,000 
UKRAINIANS HAVE DIED ON 

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:11.917
UKRAINIAN SOIL DEFENDING THEIR 
INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY FROM 

01:11:12.116 --> 01:11:14.914
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. AMERICA 
SUPPORT IN UKRAINE'S WAR OF 

01:11:15.085 --> 01:11:20.894
INDEPENDENCE HAS BEEN CRITICAL 
IN THIS REGARD. BY ANALOGY, THE 

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.289
AMERICAN COLONIES MAY NOT HAVE 
PREVAILED AGAINST THE BRITISH 

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.961
WITHOUT THE HELP OF 
TRANSATLANTIC FRIENDS AND AN 

01:11:28.175 --> 01:11:32.228
ECHO OF THE ORGANIZED ASSISTANCE
TO GEORGE WASHINGTON'S ARMY AND 

01:11:32.979 --> 01:11:34.979
OTHER RURAL

01:11:36.899 --> 01:11:38.732
JOHN PAUL JONES IS NAVY, THEY 
HAVE GENEROUSLY APPROPRIATED 

01:11:38.733 --> 01:11:40.968
OVER $1.5 MILLION OVER THE PAST 
FIVE YEARS IN THIS REALLY NEEDED

01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:47.867
TRAINED AND EQUIPPED ASSISTANCE 
TO UKRAINE. THESE FUNDS INCREASE

01:11:48.068 --> 01:11:50.102
THE STRENGTH AND ABILITY TO 
FIGHT RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AND 

01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:53.713
ULTIMATELY, UKRAINE IS ON A PATH
TO BECOME A FULL SECURITY 

01:11:53.887 --> 01:12:00.264
PARTNER OF THE UNITED STATES 
WITH THE NATO. SIMILAR AT VALLEY

01:12:00.467 --> 01:12:05.136
FORGE, U. S. AND NATO ALLIED 
TRAINERS DEVELOP SKILLS YEAR THE

01:12:05.338 --> 01:12:09.806
POLISH BORDER AND ELSEWHERE. 
THEY HELPED REWRITE MILITARY 

01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:14.076
EDUCATION FOR THE NEXT 
GENERATION AS THEY DID FOR 

01:12:14.277 --> 01:12:18.144
AMERICA'S FIRST AND SUPPORTING 
THE BRAVE RESISTANCE TO RUSSIAN 

01:12:18.343 --> 01:12:21.998
AGGRESSION, WE HAVE A FRONT ROW 
C TO THE RUSSIAN WAY OF WAR IN 

01:12:22.199 --> 01:12:26.468
THE 21st CENTURY GIVING 
PRICELESS INSIGHTS THAT 

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:29.664
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR OWN 
SECURITIES. THIS YEAR, UKRAINIAN

01:12:29.832 --> 01:12:35.615
CITIZENS PASSED THE POLITICAL 
TORCH TO A NEW GENERATION. ONE 

01:12:35.929 --> 01:12:38.240
THAT CAME OF AGE NOT IN THE 
FINAL YEARS OF THE SOVIET UNION 

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:42.509
BUT IN THE INDEPENDENT UKRAINE 
AND PRESIDENTIAL AND 

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.947
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS SWEPT 
OUT MUCH OF UKRAINE'S PREVIOUS 

01:12:45.158 --> 01:12:47.158
GOVERNING ELITE AND SEATED

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:52.213
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, A CABINET 
WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF  39 

01:12:52.397 --> 01:12:54.397
INAPPROPRIATE

01:12:55.919 --> 01:12:58.153
WITH THE AVERAGE AGE OF 41. AT 
THE HEART OF THAT CHANGED 

01:12:58.354 --> 01:13:00.587
MANDATE, FIVE YEARS AFTER THE 
REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY, THERE IS 

01:13:00.801 --> 01:13:04.251
A THIRST FOR JUSTICE BECAUSE 
THERE CANNOT BE DIGNITY WITHOUT 

01:13:04.454 --> 01:13:08.304
JUSTICE. WITHOUT A REFORMED 
JUDICIAL SECTOR THAT HAS JUSTICE

01:13:09.056 --> 01:13:16.436
FOR ALL, UKRAINIAN SOCIETY WILL 
REMAIN ON SEVERED. INVESTORS 

01:13:16.634 --> 01:13:19.482
WILL NOT BRING THE GREAT 
INVESTMENT NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT

01:13:19.683 --> 01:13:21.683
UKRAINE'S LONG-TERM PROSPERITY 
IS SECURED.

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.817
THIS IS WHY THE PRINCIPAL 
PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND

01:13:28.016 --> 01:13:32.886
INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY IS SO 
NECESSARY TO OUR STRATEGY FOR A 

01:13:33.086 --> 01:13:35.477
SUCCESSFUL UKRAINIAN IT IS ALSO 
TRUE FOR OTHER NATIONS STILL 

01:13:35.659 --> 01:13:41.009
RECOVERING. THIS IS WHY ACTING 
INCONSISTENTLY WITH THE CORE 

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.583
PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW 
COMES AT GREAT PERIL.

01:13:47.712 --> 01:13:49.948
I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL THE MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS AND STAFF INCLUDING 

01:13:50.147 --> 01:13:52.181
MANY OF YOU SITTING HERE TODAY 
WHO HAVE TRAVELED TO UKRAINE 

01:13:52.382 --> 01:13:54.214
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND 
APPROPRIATELY BILLIONS OF 

01:13:54.215 --> 01:13:58.887
DOLLARS OF ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORT
OF THE PRIMARY POLICY GOALS. 

01:13:59.288 --> 01:14:01.288
THOSE FUNDS INCREASE THE ABILITY
TO FIGHT RUSSIAN AGGRESSION IN 

01:14:01.879 --> 01:14:03.879
THE DEFENSE ENERGY CYBER

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:08.637
AND ALSO EMPOWER STATE 
INSTITUTIONS WITH THE CIVIL 

01:14:08.638 --> 01:14:14.328
SOCIETY TO UNDERTAKE SYSTEMIC 
REFORMS AND TACKLE CORRUPTION. I

01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:16.964
BELIEVE ALL OF US CAN BE PROUD 
OF OUR EFFORTS OVER THE PAST 

01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:19.816
FIVE YEARS EVEN THOUGH MUCH 
REMAINS TO BE DONE. BY ALL OF 

01:14:20.016 --> 01:14:22.254
US, I MEAN THOSE OF US IN THE 
LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE 

01:14:22.454 --> 01:14:25.973
BRANCHES IN BOTH PARTIES AND THE
INTERAGENCY COMMUNITY WORKING 

01:14:26.147 --> 01:14:30.176
OUT OF THE EMBASSY WITH 
UKRAINIANS IN GOVERNMENT AND 

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:34.376
MILITARY AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN 
THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIES AND 

01:14:34.548 --> 01:14:39.310
PARTNERS. WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR 
RESOLVE TO WAVER SINCE TOO MUCH 

01:14:39.511 --> 01:14:44.384
IS AT STAKE. NOT JUST FOR 
UKRAINE BUT THE NATIONAL 

01:14:44.597 --> 01:14:48.451
INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES 
BROADLY DEFINED. MY PRIOR 

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.904
DEPOSITION COVERED A LOT OF 
GROUND OVER 10 HOURS AND HERE 

01:14:52.104 --> 01:14:55.153
ARE THE MAIN 10 THINGS FROM MY 
TESTIMONY. I ALLIED MIKE'S 

01:14:55.354 --> 01:14:57.523
PARENTS WITH ON SENDING U. S. 
INTEREST IN SUPPORTING 

01:14:57.695 --> 01:15:01.658
ANTICORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. THIS 
GAVE ME A FRONT ROW SEAT TO 

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:08.561
PROBLEMATIC ACTIVITIES BY 
SUCCESSORS IN UKRAINE. MY 

01:15:08.764 --> 01:15:12.819
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING IS 
SOMETIMES FIRST-HAND AND 

01:15:13.033 --> 01:15:16.886
SOMETIMES COMES FROM OTHERS 
INVOLVED IN SPECIFIC 

01:15:17.087 --> 01:15:19.087
CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS. THIS
IS NO DIFFERENT THAN HOW ANYONE 

01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:24.207
LEARNS AND CARRIES OUT HIS OR 
HER JOB RESPONSIBILITIES. I HAVE

01:15:24.407 --> 01:15:28.459
BEEN AND REMAIN WILLING TO SHARE
MY FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS WITH THE

01:15:28.674 --> 01:15:31.257
COMMITTEE AND WILL MAKE CLEAR 
WHEN THOSE ARE BASED ON PERSONAL

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.460
KNOWLEDGE OR INFORMATION LEADING
FROM OTHERS.

01:15:36.794 --> 01:15:38.794
U. S. EFFORTS TO COUNTER 
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE FOCUS ON 

01:15:38.829 --> 01:15:43.086
BUILDING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY 
THAT AS THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

01:15:43.299 --> 01:15:45.118
HAS THE ABILITY TO AFTER 
CORRUPTION AND INVESTIGATE AND 

01:15:45.119 --> 01:15:48.368
PROSECUTE AND JUDGE ALLEGED 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES USING 

01:15:48.581 --> 01:15:52.836
APPROPRIATE INSTITUTIONAL 
MECHANISMS. THAT IS TO CREATE 

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.613
AND FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW. THAT
MEANS IF THERE ARE

01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:01.929
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, U. S. LAW 
ENFORCEMENT SHOULD PURSUE THE 

01:16:02.106 --> 01:16:05.631
CASE AND IF WE THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN A CRIMINAL ACT OVERSEAS 

01:16:05.846 --> 01:16:09.900
THAT VIOLATES U. S. LAW, WE HAVE
THE MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS THAT. 

01:16:10.113 --> 01:16:14.164
IT COULD BE THROUGH THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT AND FBI AGENTS 

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.400
OVERSEAS OR THROUGH TREATY 
MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE NEUTRAL 

01:16:16.401 --> 01:16:20.600
LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY AND AS A
GENERAL PRINCIPLE, I DO NOT 

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:23.867
BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES SHOULD
ASK OTHER COUNTRIES TO ENGAGE IN

01:16:24.048 --> 01:16:26.350
SELECTIVE POLITICALLY ASSOCIATED
INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS 

01:16:26.764 --> 01:16:31.036
AGAINST OPPONENTS OF THOSE IN 
POWER BECAUSE SUCH SELECTIVE 

01:16:31.231 --> 01:16:36.711
ACTIONS UNDERMINE THE RULE OF 
LAW REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTRY. 

01:16:37.128 --> 01:16:38.945
LONG-STANDING PROBLEMS AND 
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE CREATED 

01:16:38.946 --> 01:16:42.195
EXPOSURE TO A SITUATION CAUSING 
THE ENERGY COMPANY AND THE 

01:16:42.945 --> 01:16:52.358
PRIMARY CONCERN WAS THE OWNER 
WHO HAS FROZEN ASSETS THAT WAS 

01:16:52.559 --> 01:16:54.793
ATTEMPTED TO RECOVER ON 
UKRAINE'S HALF. I RAISE 

01:16:54.992 --> 01:16:57.976
QUESTIONS WITH THE DEBBIE 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL ABOUT WHY THE

01:16:58.156 --> 01:17:02.507
INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY HAVE BEEN TERMINATED  

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:07.790
BASED ON OUR BELIEF THAT 
PROSECUTORS ACCEPTED BRIBES ON 

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:10.786
THE CASE. LATER, I BECAME AWARE 
THAT HUNTER BIDEN WAS ON THE 

01:17:10.955 --> 01:17:13.678
BOARD AND SOON AFTER THAT IN A 
BRIEFING CALL WITH THE NATIONAL 

01:17:14.431 --> 01:17:17.544
SECURITY STAFF IN THE OFFICE OF 
THE VICE PRESIDENT INFANTRY 

01:17:17.774 --> 01:17:21.357
2015, I RAISE MY CONCERN TO 
HUNTER BIDEN'S STATUS AS A BOARD

01:17:21.538 --> 01:17:23.538
MEMBER

01:17:25.466 --> 01:17:27.950
TO LOOK AT CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
LET ME BE CLEAR, I DID NOT 

01:17:28.139 --> 01:17:30.334
WITNESS ANY EFFORT TO SHIELD 
PRISMA FROM SCRUTINY AND I AND 

01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:34.561
OTHER OFFICIALS CONSISTENTLY 
ADVOCATED REINSTITUTING A SUBTLE

01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:36.729
INVESTIGATION

01:17:38.469 --> 01:17:40.469
OF THE FOUNDER AS WELL AS 
HOLDING THE PROSECUTORS THAT 

01:17:40.504 --> 01:17:46.392
CLOSED THE CASE TO ACCOUNT. OVER
THE COURSE OF 2018 AND 2019, I 

01:17:46.593 --> 01:17:48.593
BECAME INCREASINGLY AWARE OF AN 
EFFORT BY RUDY GIULIANI AND 

01:17:48.624 --> 01:17:55.061
OTHERS INCLUDING HIS ASSOCIATES 
TO RUN A CAMPAIGN TO SMEAR THE 

01:17:55.230 --> 01:18:00.811
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH AND 
OTHERS.  ON THE UKRAINIAN SIDE 

01:18:01.012 --> 01:18:03.449
OF THIS EFFORT, IT WAS SOME OF 
THE SAME CORRUPT PROSECUTORS I 

01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:09.550
HAD ENCOUNTERED AND PARTICULARLY
VICTOR SHOOK IT AND BRING GO. 

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:12.243
THEY HAVE FALSE INFORMATION IN 
ORDER TO EXTRACT REVENGE AGAINST

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:16.455
THOSE THAT WOULD EXPOSE THEIR 
MISCONDUCT INCLUDING U. S. 

01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:18.409
DIPLOMATS AND UKRAINIAN 
ANTICORRUPTION OFFICIALS AND 

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:26.397
CIVIL CITED GROUPS. DURING 2019,
I BECAME ALARMED. THIS LED TO 

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:31.682
THE OUSTER OF AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH  AND EFFORTS TO 

01:18:32.084 --> 01:18:35.952
ESTABLISH RAPPORT WITH THE NEW 
ADMINISTRATION IN UKRAINE. IN 

01:18:36.151 --> 01:18:40.771
MID AUGUST, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT
THE INVESTIGATIONS WERE NOW 

01:18:40.952 --> 01:18:44.024
INFECTING INVESTIGATIONS 
LEVERAGING

01:18:48.752 --> 01:18:50.752
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S DESIRE FOR 
A WHITE HOUSE MEETING. THERE ARE

01:18:50.772 --> 01:18:53.621
AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN 
CONDITIONALITY'S  PLACED ON 

01:18:53.823 --> 01:18:57.074
UKRAINE INCLUDING ANTICORRUPTION
REFORM AS WELL IS BEING LARGER 

01:18:57.688 --> 01:18:59.688
STABILITY GOALS AND SAFETY NETS.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.993
THE MONETARY FUND DOES THE SAME 
THING. CONGRESS IN THE EXECUTIVE

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:10.278
BRANCH WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE 
SOME SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN THE 

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:14.132
UKRAINE SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
INITIATIVE. REGARDING MY 

01:19:14.346 --> 01:19:16.784
TESTIMONY TODAY, I WILL DO MY 
BEST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS 

01:19:16.982 --> 01:19:19.218
THAT WILL INVOLVE ISSUES AND 
CONVERSATIONS AND DOCK MEANT IN 

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.421
A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:19:24.713 --> 01:19:26.713
IT MAY BE LIMITED BY THREE 
CONSIDERATIONS. FIRST, THE STATE

01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:29.793
DEPARTMENT HAS COLLECTED ALL 
MATERIALS IN RESPONSE TO THE 

01:19:29.994 --> 01:19:32.849
SUBPOENA THAT MAY CONTAIN FACTS 
RELEVANT TO MY TESTIMONY. I HAVE

01:19:33.051 --> 01:19:37.926
NO SUCH DOCUMENTS OR MATERIALS 
WITH ME TODAY. I WILL THUS DO MY

01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:40.176
BEST TO ANSWER AS ACCURATELY AND
COMPLETELY AND TRUTHFULLY AS I 

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.376
CAN AT THE BEST OF MY 
RECOLLECTION.

01:19:46.272 --> 01:19:48.102
SECOND, AS HIS COMMITTEE KNOWS, 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, THERE 

01:19:48.103 --> 01:19:50.103
HAVE BEEN CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS 
MAY BE ASKED ABOUT CLASSIFIED 

01:19:50.143 --> 01:19:52.143
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ASKED 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR 

01:19:52.177 --> 01:19:54.969
GUIDANCE ABOUT CLASSIFICATION 
CONCERNS RELEASED TO MY 

01:19:55.569 --> 01:20:01.527
DEPOSITION AND THEY HAVE 
DECLINED TO PROVIDE ANY. IF I AM

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.127
ASKED A QUESTION TODAY THAT I 
BELIEVE MAY IMPLICATE CLASSIFIED

01:20:04.298 --> 01:20:06.530
INFORMATION, I WILL RESPECTFULLY
DECLINE TO ANSWER.

01:20:10.878 --> 01:20:12.878
THIRD, THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS 
FOCUSING ON THE IDENTITY OF 

01:20:12.911 --> 01:20:14.547
PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AND THESE QUESTIONS 

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:18.203
WERE REDACTED FROM MY 
TRANSCRIPT. SUCH A QUESTION IF 

01:20:18.403 --> 01:20:21.001
IT ARISES TODAY, I WILL FOLLOW 
MY ADVICE AND DECLINED TO 

01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:23.244
ANSWER.

01:20:24.914 --> 01:20:27.310
I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE MY 
OPENING REMARKS WITH AN 

01:20:27.516 --> 01:20:30.606
OBSERVATION ABOUT SOME OF MY 
FELLOW PUBLIC SERVANTS THAT HAVE

01:20:30.821 --> 01:20:32.798
COME UNDER PERSONAL ATTACKS. 
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH,  

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:38.134
LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND DR. HILL 
AT LEAST ONE OF WHOM WILL APPEAR

01:20:38.348 --> 01:20:40.348
BEFORE THE BODY IN THE COMING 
DAYS.

01:20:44.848 --> 01:20:46.848
MARCIA, ALEX IF UNIT WERE BORN 
ABROAD WERE THEY THEMSELVES 

01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:49.058
PERSONALLY CHOSE TO IMMIGRATE TO
THE UNITED STATES. THEY ALL MADE

01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:52.579
THE PROFESSIONAL CHOICE TO SERVE
THE UNITED STATES AS PUBLIC 

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.413
OFFICIALS HELPING SHAPE OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY TOWARDS

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.414
RUSSIA IN PARTICULAR

01:21:00.914 --> 01:21:03.366
AND WE ARE BETTER FOR IT. IN 
THIS SENSE, THEY ARE THE 21st 

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:06.212
CENTURY ERRORS OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY POLICY WHO WERE ALSO 

01:21:06.407 --> 01:21:11.239
BORN ABROAD. MY FORMER PROFESSOR
AND HIS FELLOW IMMIGRANT, HENRY 

01:21:11.428 --> 01:21:13.428
KISSINGER.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.040
THEY FLED AND COMMUNIST 
OPPRESSION  AND CONTRIBUTE TO A 

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.275
STRONGER AND MORE SECURE 
AMERICA. THAT HONORABLE 

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:26.348
TRADITION OF TRANSATLANTIC TIES 
GOES BACK TO THE VERY FOUNDING 

01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:29.189
OF OUR REPUBLIC. OUR 
18TH-CENTURY INDEPENDENCE WOULD 

01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:33.301
NOT HAVE BEEN SECURED WITHOUT 
THE CHOICE OF EUROPEAN OFFICERS 

01:21:33.483 --> 01:21:35.849
IN THE FRENCH BORN LAFAYETTE AND
GERMAN BORN

01:21:39.357 --> 01:21:43.028
IN PULASKI TO COME TO THE NEW 
WORLD AND FIGHT FOR OUR CAUSE OF

01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:48.922
FREEDOM IN THE BIRTH OF A NEW 
COUNTRY FREE FROM DOMINION. IT 

01:21:49.123 --> 01:21:51.359
IS MY PRIVILEGE TO SIT NEXT TO 
MY FORMER BOSS AMBASSADOR DATE 

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:56.168
TAYLOR TODAY AND IT IS MY HONOR 
TO SERVE WITH ALL THESE 

01:21:56.452 --> 01:22:01.030
PATRIOTIC AMERICANS. THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU,  INVESTOR TAYLOR. 

01:22:01.686 --> 01:22:06.548
&gt;&gt;  MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM APPEARING
TODAY AT THE COMMITTEE'S REQUEST

01:22:07.425 --> 01:22:10.894
TO PROVIDE MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE
EVENTS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF 

01:22:11.096 --> 01:22:14.952
THE COMMITTEE'S INQUIRY. I WANT 
TO EMPHASIZE AT THE OUTSET THAT 

01:22:15.165 --> 01:22:17.547
WHILE I AM AWARE THAT THE 
COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED MY 

01:22:17.717 --> 01:22:23.097
TESTIMONY AS PART OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS, I AM 

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.354
NOT HERE TO TAKE ONE SIDE OR THE
OTHER OR TO ADVOCATE FOR ANY 

01:22:26.553 --> 01:22:30.815
PARTICULAR OUTCOME OF THESE 
PROCEEDINGS. MY SOLE PURPOSE IS 

01:22:31.028 --> 01:22:35.088
TO PROVIDE FACTS AS I KNOW THEM 
ABOUT THE INCIDENTS IN QUESTION 

01:22:35.504 --> 01:22:39.361
AS WELL IS MY VIEWS ABOUT THE 
STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF UKRAINE 

01:22:39.565 --> 01:22:44.040
TO THE UNITED STATES. MY WAY OF 
BACKGROUND, IT HAS BEEN A 

01:22:44.241 --> 01:22:46.275
PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO SERVE OUR 
COUNTRY AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:51.186
FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS AS A 
CADET AT WEST POINT AS YOU 

01:22:51.368 --> 01:22:53.368
MENTIONED, MR. CHAIRMAN, AS IN A
FORGERY OFFICER INCLUDED WITH 

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:57.878
THE 101st AIRBORNE DIVISION IN 
VIETNAM AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 

01:22:58.079 --> 01:23:00.719
ENERGY AND THEN AS A MEMBER OF A
SENATE STAFF AND THEN AT NATO 

01:23:00.919 --> 01:23:02.919
AND THAT WITH THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT HERE AND ABROAD IN 

01:23:02.968 --> 01:23:08.451
AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND 
UKRAINE. I RETIRED FROM THE 

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:12.925
STATE DEPARTMENT IN 2009 TO JOIN
THE INSTITUTE AND I'M EITHER A 

01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:15.693
CAREER MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN 
SERVICE NOR OF THE CIVIL SERVICE

01:23:15.876 --> 01:23:19.448
. I AM NONPARTISAN AND HAVE BEEN
APPOINTED BY EVERY PRESIDENT 

01:23:19.636 --> 01:23:24.313
FROM PRESIDENT REAGAN TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. LET ME 

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:29.405
SUMMARIZE MY MAIN POINTS. FIRST,
UKRAINE IS A STRATEGIC PARTNER 

01:23:29.606 --> 01:23:32.258
OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
IMPORTANT FOR THE SECURITY OF 

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:37.537
OUR COUNTRY AS WELL AS EUROPE. 
UKRAINE IS ON THE FRONT LINE IN 

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:40.707
THE CONFLICT WITH THE NEWLY 
AGGRESSIVE RUSSIA.

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:47.703
SECOND, EVEN AS WE SIT HERE 
TODAY, THE RUSSIANS ARE 

01:23:47.905 --> 01:23:52.379
ATTACKING UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS IN 
THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND HAVE BEEN 

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:56.653
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. I SAW 
THIS ON THE FRONTLINE LAST WEEK 

01:23:56.853 --> 01:24:00.526
IN THE DAY I WAS THERE, A 
UKRAINIAN SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND

01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:06.020
HORRIBLY WOUNDED. THIRD, THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE WE PROVIDE 

01:24:06.421 --> 01:24:11.499
IS CRUCIAL TO THE DEFENSE AND 
PROTECTION OF THE SOLDIERS I MET

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:15.931
ON THE FRONTLINE LAST WEEK. IT 
DEMONSTRATES TO UKRAINIANS AND 

01:24:16.109 --> 01:24:20.099
RUSSIANS THAT WE ARE THE 
RELIABLE STRATEGIC PARTNER AND 

01:24:20.274 --> 01:24:26.546
IT IS CLEARLY IN OUR NATURAL 
INTEREST TO ENSURE AGGRESSION 

01:24:27.308 --> 01:24:29.308
AND FINALLY

01:24:31.837 --> 01:24:33.837
, I WROTE THAT WITHHOLDING 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN EXCHANGE 

01:24:34.218 --> 01:24:36.509
FOR HELP TO THE DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN THE UNITED

01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:42.368
STATES WOULD BE CRAZY. I BELIEVE
THAT THEN AND NOW. LET ME TELL 

01:24:42.561 --> 01:24:44.561
YOU WHY.

01:24:46.673 --> 01:24:49.509
ON MAY 28 OF THIS YEAR, I MET 
WITH MIKE POMPEO WHO ASKED ME TO

01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:53.780
REJOIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND 
RETURN TO LEAD OUR EMBASSY IN 

01:24:53.982 --> 01:24:57.167
UKRAINE. IT WAS AND IS A 
CRITICAL TIME FOR U. S. TROOP 

01:24:57.345 --> 01:25:02.522
CARRYING RELATIONS. I HAVE 
SERVED FROM 2006 TO 2009 AS AN 

01:25:02.724 --> 01:25:06.006
INVESTOR AND HAVING BEEN 
NOMINATED BY GEORGE W. BUSH IN 

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:11.468
THE INTERVENING 10 YEARS HAD 
STAYED ENGAGED WITH UKRAINE. 

01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:13.489
ACROSS THE RESPONSIBILITIES I 
HAVE HAD IN PUBLIC SERVICE, 

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:17.410
UKRAINE IS A HIGHLIGHT AND SO 
SECRETARY POMPEO'S OFFER TO 

01:25:18.117 --> 01:25:24.265
RETURN AS CHIEF WAS COMPELLING. 
AS A LEFT UKRAINE IN 2009, THE 

01:25:24.466 --> 01:25:30.156
COUNTRY HAD CONTINUED TO TURN 
TOWARDS THE WEST BUT IN 2013, M 

01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:37.075
PUTIN WAS SO OUTRAGED THAT HE 
TRIED TO BRIBE THE UKRAINIAN 

01:25:37.477 --> 01:25:41.027
PRESIDENT WHICH TRIGGERED MASS 
PROTEST IN THE WINTER 2013 THAT 

01:25:41.196 --> 01:25:48.655
DROVE THE PRESIDENT TO FLEE TO 
RUSSIA IN FEBRUARY 2014 BUT NOT 

01:25:48.855 --> 01:25:50.855
BEFORE HIS FORCES KILLED 100 
UKRAINIAN PROTESTERS.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.212
DAYS LATER, MR. PUTIN INVADED 
HOLDING A SHAMROCK RANDOM AT THE

01:25:58.447 --> 01:26:04.505
POINT OF RUSSIAN ARMY RIFLES IN 
THE OF SURLY CLAIM THAT 97% 

01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:07.493
VOTED TO JOIN RUSSIA AND IN 
EARLY APRIL,

01:26:11.626 --> 01:26:13.626
HE SENT HIS FORCES INTO EASTERN 
UKRAINE TO GENERATE ILLEGAL 

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:18.738
ARMED FORMATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS
AND WHAT WE KNOW AS NUMBERS. YOU

01:26:18.938 --> 01:26:22.794
CAN SEE THIS ON THE MAP AT THE 
RIGHT HAND PORTION IN THE 

01:26:23.007 --> 01:26:25.644
EASTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY. 
14,000 UKRAINE TO HAVE DIED IN 

01:26:26.404 --> 01:26:28.419
THE WAR AND MORE DIE EACH WEEK.

01:26:32.549 --> 01:26:37.379
IN JULY 2014, THESE RUSSIAN LED 
FORCES SHUT DOWN A CIVILIAN AIR 

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:41.171
LINGER IN ROUTE FROM AMSTERDAM 
TO MALAYSIA KILLING ALL 298 

01:26:41.344 --> 01:26:43.344
PEOPLE ON BOARD.

01:26:47.387 --> 01:26:49.387
WE, THE EUROPEANS AND MOST OF 
THE WEST IMPOSED ECONOMIC 

01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:52.803
SANCTIONS AND KICK THE RUSSIANS 
OUT OF THE G-8 BEGINNING IN 2014

01:26:53.085 --> 01:26:57.512
, WE AND NATO BEGAN TO PROVIDE 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE'S

01:26:58.117 --> 01:27:02.030
ARMED FORCES IN THE FORM OF 
TRAINING ADVICE AND MILITARY 

01:27:02.235 --> 01:27:07.303
EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS. IT IS THE
SECURITY ASSISTANCE THAT IS AT 

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.393
THE HEART OF THE CONTROVERSY 
THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY. 

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:17.066
THE PRO-RUSSIAN PRESIDENT THAT 
WAS RUN OUT OF KEYS IN 2014 LEFT

01:27:17.264 --> 01:27:20.431
THE RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES TO 
DETERIORATE TO THE POINT OF RUIN

01:27:21.331 --> 01:27:26.004
AND THE RESPONSE OF THE RUSSIAN 
INVASION, THE NEW UKRAINIAN 

01:27:26.205 --> 01:27:28.079
AUTHORITIES WITH AN AMAZING 
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR 

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.492
REGULAR UKRAINIAN PEOPLE REBUILT
THE ARMY NEARLY FROM SCRATCH 

01:27:31.907 --> 01:27:38.615
WITH MORE THAN 5% OF THE GDP ON 
DEFENSE SINCE THE WAR STARTED. 

01:27:39.016 --> 01:27:41.016
THE WHOLE UKRAINIAN NATION 
FIERCELY RESPONDED TO THE 

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.923
RUSSIAN ATTACK IN THE NATION 
UNITED LIKE NEVER BEFORE. THE 

01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:50.394
ARMY DEVELOPED INTO A STRONG 
FIGHTING FORCE IN THE UNITED 

01:27:50.595 --> 01:27:55.224
STATES PLAYED A VITAL ROLE. IN 
2014, CONGRESS PROVIDED OVER 1.6

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:59.752
DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
TO UKRAINE IN THE SECURITY 

01:28:00.514 --> 01:28:04.826
ASSISTANCE DIVIDED SMALL UNIT 
TRAINING AT AN ARMY BASE IN THE 

01:28:05.027 --> 01:28:07.877
WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AND 
PROVIDED ENTRANCES AND 

01:28:08.481 --> 01:28:11.075
MEDICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND 
COUNTER BATTERY RADAR AND NAVY 

01:28:11.276 --> 01:28:16.809
SHIPS AND FINALLY A WEAPON. THEY
DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO 

01:28:17.561 --> 01:28:24.951
RESISTED AGGRESSION. DURING THE 
2014 TO 2016 PERIOD, I WAS 

01:28:25.151 --> 01:28:27.787
SERVING OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT 
AND JOINT TWO OTHER FORMER 

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:31.086
INVESTORS AND URGED THE OBAMA 
OFFICIALS AT THE STATE 

01:28:31.267 --> 01:28:34.908
DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES TO
PROVIDE LETHAL OFFENSE IN ORDER 

01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:39.939
TO DETER FURTHER RUSSIAN 
AGGRESSION. I ALSO SUPPORTED 

01:28:40.113 --> 01:28:44.654
MUCH STRONGER SANCTIONS ON 
RUSSIA. I WAS PLEASED WITH THE 

01:28:44.868 --> 01:28:48.122
TRUMPET MENSTRUATION PROVIDED AN
ATTACK MISSILES AND AN ACTION 

01:28:48.883 --> 01:28:54.816
STRONGER SANCTIONS. ALL TO SAY I
CARED ABOUT UKRAINE'S FUTURE AND

01:28:55.031 --> 01:28:59.300
THE IMPORTANT INTEREST THERE. 
WHEN SECRETARY POMPEO ASKED ME 

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:04.479
TO GO BACK, I WANTED TO SAY YES 
BUT IT WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION.

01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:13.120
THE FORMER AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN 
TREATED POORLY AND IN A WEB AND 

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.505
I FEARED THAT THOSE PROBLEMS 
WERE STILL PRESENT

01:29:20.427 --> 01:29:22.863
IN AN INSULT TO BOTH MY WIFE AND
THE SENIOR PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL 

01:29:23.103 --> 01:29:26.665
WHO HAS BEEN A MENTOR. I WILL 
TELL YOU THAT MY WIFE ON NO 

01:29:26.841 --> 01:29:34.453
UNCERTAIN TERMS STRONGLY AGREE 
WITH THE IDEA AND IF YOUR 

01:29:34.653 --> 01:29:36.889
COUNTRY ASKED YOU TO DO 
SOMETHING, YOU DO IT IF YOU CAN 

01:29:37.092 --> 01:29:39.530
BE EFFECTIVE. I CAN BE EFFECTIVE
ONLY IF THE U. S. POLICY WITH 

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:43.182
STRONG SUPPORT AND STRONG 
DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT ALONG WITH 

01:29:43.383 --> 01:29:45.981
ROBUST SECURITY AND ECONOMIC AND
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WERE TO 

01:29:46.151 --> 01:29:50.706
CONTINUE AND IF I HAVE THE 
BACKING OF THE SECRETARY OF 

01:29:50.907 --> 01:29:53.702
STATE TO IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY, 
AS I WORRIED ABOUT WHAT I HAD 

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.005
HEARD CONCERNING THE ROLE OF 
RUDY GIULIANI THAT MADE SEVERAL 

01:29:57.206 --> 01:29:59.574
CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT 
UKRAINE AND U. S. POLICY FOR THE

01:29:59.774 --> 01:30:01.774
COUNTRY.

01:30:09.394 --> 01:30:13.046
DURING MY MEETING WITH SECRETARY
POMPEO, I MADE CLEAR TO HIM AND 

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:20.168
THE OTHERS PRESENT THAT IF U. S.
POLICY TOWARDS UKRAINE CHANGED, 

01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:23.419
THEY WOULD NOT WANT ME POSTED 
THERE AND I COULD NOT STAY. HE 

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.419
ASSURED ME THAT THE POLICY HAD 
STROKES OF COURT AND IT WOULD 

01:30:26.592 --> 01:30:30.255
CONTINUE AND THAT HE WOULD 
SUPPORT ME IN DEFENDING THAT 

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:34.792
POLICY. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING, I
AGREED TO GO BACK BECAUSE I WAS 

01:30:34.994 --> 01:30:38.243
APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY BUT 
NOT RECONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. 

01:30:38.857 --> 01:30:44.882
MY OFFICIAL POSITION WAS THE 
ACTING AMBASSADOR. I RETURNED ON

01:30:46.115 --> 01:30:49.977
JUNE 17 DURING THE ORIGINAL COPY
OF A LETTER THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:30:50.162 --> 01:30:53.983
SIGNED AND IN THAT LETTER, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CONGRATULATED 

01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:58.763
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY ON HIS  
ELECTION VICTORY AND INVITED HIM

01:30:58.964 --> 01:31:04.452
TO A MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
ONCE I ARRIVED, I DISCOVERED A 

01:31:04.652 --> 01:31:08.058
WEIRD COMBINATION OF ENCOURAGING
, CONFUSING AND ULTIMATELY 

01:31:08.224 --> 01:31:13.394
ALARMING CIRCUMSTANCES. FIRST, 
ENCOURAGING, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:15.594
IS REFORMING UKRAINE IN A HURRY 
.

01:31:18.884 --> 01:31:22.136
HE SUPPORTED LONG STALLED 
ANTICORRUPTION LEGISLATION AND 

01:31:22.336 --> 01:31:24.773
TOOK QUICK EXECUTIVE ACTION 
INCLUDING OPENING UKRAINE'S HIGH

01:31:25.536 --> 01:31:29.641
ANTICORRUPTION COURT WITH A NEW 
PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY STEMMING 

01:31:29.856 --> 01:31:33.863
FROM SNAP ELECTIONS, PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY CHANGE  THE 

01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:36.110
CONSTITUTION TO REMOVE ABSOLUTE 
IMMUNITY

01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:44.686
FROM THE SOURCE OF ALL 
CORRUPTION FOR TWO DECADES. 

01:31:45.087 --> 01:31:47.123
EXCITEMENT WAS PALPABLE AND THIS
TIME IT COULD BE DIFFERENT. AND 

01:31:47.329 --> 01:31:52.408
YOU KNEW UKRAINE FINALLY 
BREAKING FROM ITS CORRUPT PAST. 

01:31:52.809 --> 01:31:55.980
YET, I FOUND IT CONFUSING AND 
UNUSUAL FOR MAKING U. S. POLICY

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.950
. THERE APPEAR TO BE TWO 
CHANNELS OF U. S. POLICYMAKING 

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:05.815
AND IMPLEMENTATION. ONE REGULAR 
AND ONE HIGHLY IRREGULAR. AS THE

01:32:06.016 --> 01:32:08.375
ACTING AMBASSADOR, I HAD 
AUTHORITY OVER THE REGULAR

01:32:12.107 --> 01:32:14.141
INCLUDING THE BULK OF THE U. S. 
EFFORTS TO SUPPORT UKRAINE 

01:32:14.342 --> 01:32:18.606
AGAINST RUSSIAN INVASION TO HELP
DEFEAT CORRUPTION. MY COLLEAGUE,

01:32:19.372 --> 01:32:24.843
GEORGE KENT AND OUR COLLEAGUES 
AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:29.111
WERE MY MAIN POINTS OF CONTACT 
IN WASHINGTON IN THE REGULAR 

01:32:29.285 --> 01:32:31.613
CHANNEL. THIS CHANNEL IS 
FORMALLY RESPONSIBLE TO 

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:37.717
FORMULATE AND OVERSEE 
DEPORTATION OF U. S. POLICY IN 

01:32:37.918 --> 01:32:41.110
THE POLICY THAT IS CONSISTENTLY 
ENJOYED WITH STRONG BIPARTISAN 

01:32:41.285 --> 01:32:43.285
SUPPORT

01:32:45.232 --> 01:32:49.648
SINCE UKRAINE'S INDEPENDENCE 
FROM RUSSIA IN 1991. AT THE SAME

01:32:49.821 --> 01:32:54.690
TIME, I ENCOUNTERED AN IRREGULAR
INFORMAL CHANNEL OF POLICYMAKING

01:32:57.009 --> 01:33:02.291
UNACCOUNTABLE TO CONGRESS IN A 
CHANNEL THAT INCLUDED SPECIAL 

01:33:02.707 --> 01:33:07.982
ENVOY AND U. S. AMBASSADOR TO 
THE UNION AND RICK PERRY AND 

01:33:08.181 --> 01:33:13.619
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF AND 
AS I SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED, MR. 

01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:19.813
GIULIANI. I WAS CLEARLY IN THE 
REGULAR CHANNEL BUT I WAS ALSO 

01:33:19.984 --> 01:33:22.118
IN THE IRREGULAR ONE TO THE 
EXTENT THAT INVESTORS

01:33:27.292 --> 01:33:28.909
INCLUDED ME IN CERTAIN 
CONVERSATIONS. THIS HEARING WILL

01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:31.077
CHANNEL WAS WELL CONNECTED IN 
WASHINGTON BUT OPERATED MOSTLY 

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:35.695
OUTSIDE OF OFFICIAL STATE 
DEPARTMENT. IT REALLY CHANNEL 

01:33:36.363 --> 01:33:41.101
BEGAN WHEN THE AMBASSADOR IN 
SECTOR PERRY AND SENATOR RON 

01:33:41.864 --> 01:33:46.331
JOHNSON BREACHED PRESIDENT TRUMP
ON MAY 23 UPON THEIR RETURN FROM

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.853
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S 
INAUGURATION.  THE DELEGATION 

01:33:51.053 --> 01:33:56.741
WAS AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS I WOULD 
SOON BECOME ABOUT THE NEW 

01:33:56.942 --> 01:33:58.942
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT AND URGE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MEET WITH HIM

01:33:59.535 --> 01:34:05.678
EARLY ON. TO CEMENT THE U. S. 
UKRAINE RELATIONSHIP. FROM WHAT 

01:34:05.893 --> 01:34:07.310
I UNDERSTOOD FROM THE 
PARTICIPANTS, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:34:07.311 --> 01:34:11.581
DID NOT SHARE THEIR ENTHUSIASM 
FOR MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 

01:34:11.781 --> 01:34:16.051
ZELENSKY. WHEN I ARRIVED , THE 
ACTIONS OF BOTH THE REGULAR AND 

01:34:16.252 --> 01:34:19.507
IRREGULAR CHANNELS OF 
FOREIGN-POLICY APPEARED TO SERVE

01:34:19.706 --> 01:34:25.792
THE SAME GOAL. A STRONG U. S. 
UKRAINE PARTNERSHIP THAT BECAME 

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:30.221
CLEAR TO ME BY AUGUST THAT THE 
CHANNELS HAD DIVERGED IN THEIR 

01:34:30.396 --> 01:34:34.530
OBJECTIVES AND I BECAME 
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED. IN LATE 

01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:38.396
JUNE, BOTH CHANNELS WERE TRYING 
TO FACILITATE A VISIT BY 

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:41.031
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE  FOR MEETING WITH 

01:34:41.446 --> 01:34:45.498
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHICH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAD PROMISED IN HIS 

01:34:46.449 --> 01:34:49.565
CONGRATULATORY LETTER AND THE 
UKRAINIANS WERE CLEARLY EAGER 

01:34:49.765 --> 01:34:53.373
FOR THE MEETING TO HAPPEN. 
DURING MY SUBSEQUENT 

01:34:53.552 --> 01:34:57.283
COMMUNICATIONS WITH AMBASSADORS,
THEY RELAYED TO ME THAT THE 

01:34:57.483 --> 01:35:00.333
PRESIDENT WANTED TO HEAR FROM 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY BEFORE 

01:35:00.545 --> 01:35:05.002
SCHEDULING THE MEETING  IN THE 
OVAL OFFICE. IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO

01:35:05.202 --> 01:35:11.500
ME WHAT THIS MEANT. IN JUNE 27, 
THE INVESTOR TOLD ME THAT 

01:35:11.914 --> 01:35:14.483
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY NEEDED TO 
MAKE CLEAR  TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:35:14.725 --> 01:35:20.651
THAT HE,  PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WAS
NOT STANDING IN THE WAY OF 

01:35:21.408 --> 01:35:23.408
INVESTIGATIONS . I SENSED 
SOMETHING ODD

01:35:27.552 --> 01:35:31.419
THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO INCLUDE 
MOST OF THE REGULAR INNER AGENT 

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:33.820
PARTICIPANTS LATER THAT DAY.

01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:41.305
WE WERE ON THIS CALL DIALING IN 
FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. 

01:35:41.519 --> 01:35:46.042
HOWEVER, THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE 
WANTED TO MAKE SURE NO ONE WAS 

01:35:46.243 --> 01:35:49.898
TRANSCRIBING OR MONITORING AS 
THEY ADDED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO

01:35:50.096 --> 01:35:55.182
THE CALL. ALSO,  BEFORE HE 
JOINED THE CALL, THE INVESTOR 

01:35:55.384 --> 01:35:57.974
SITE REALLY TOLD THE U. S. 
PARTICIPANTS THAT HE PLANNED TO 

01:35:58.303 --> 01:36:02.287
BE EXPLICIT WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY IN A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:11.549
IN TORONTO  ON JULY 2 AND THAT 
MEETING, THEY PLANNED TO TELL

01:36:13.258 --> 01:36:15.735
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WHAT HE 
NEEDED TO DO TO GET THE  

01:36:15.914 --> 01:36:17.914
MEETING.

01:36:23.013 --> 01:36:25.046
AMBASSADOR VOLKER SAID HE WANTED
TO SEE RULE OF LAW AND 

01:36:25.248 --> 01:36:26.675
TRANSPARENCY BUT SPECIFICALLY 
COOPERATION ON INVESTIGATIONS  

01:36:26.676 --> 01:36:30.937
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS. 
ONCE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY JOINED 

01:36:31.138 --> 01:36:33.935
THE CALL, THE CONVERSATION WAS 
FOCUS ON ENERGY POLICY  IN THE 

01:36:34.103 --> 01:36:37.441
WAR. PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SAID HE 
LOOKED FORWARD TO THE WHITE 

01:36:37.641 --> 01:36:41.210
HOUSE VISIT  THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS OFFERED IN HIS LETTER.

01:36:43.527 --> 01:36:45.762
BY MID JULY, IT WAS BECOMING 
CLEAR TO ME THAT THE MEETING 

01:36:45.962 --> 01:36:48.545
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WANTED WAS 
CONDITIONED  ON THE 

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:56.933
INVESTIGATIONS ON INTERFERENCE 
IN THE 2016 ELECTIONS. IT WAS 

01:36:57.144 --> 01:37:00.394
ALSO CLEAR THAT THIS CONDITION 
WAS DRIVEN BY THE LEGACY POLICY 

01:37:00.596 --> 01:37:04.238
CHANNEL I HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT 
WAS GUIDED BY MR. GIULIANI.

01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:12.785
THE SECURE VIDEO CONFERENCE CALL
ON JULY 18, I HEARD A STAFF 

01:37:12.988 --> 01:37:14.988
PERSON FROM THE OFFICE OF 
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET SAY THERE 

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.808
IS A HOLD ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE
TO UKRAINE BUT COULD NOT SAY 

01:37:18.015 --> 01:37:20.015
WHY.

01:37:22.538 --> 01:37:24.976
THE END OF AN OTHERWISE NORMAL 
MEETING, A VOICE ON A CALL, THE 

01:37:25.177 --> 01:37:28.628
PERSON WAS OFFSCREEN SAID THAT 
SHE WAS FROM OMB AND HER BOSS 

01:37:28.829 --> 01:37:30.662
INSTRUCTED HER NOT TO APPROVE 
ANY ADDITIONAL PENDING ON 

01:37:30.663 --> 01:37:33.297
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE 
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. I AND 

01:37:34.049 --> 01:37:38.124
OTHERS SAT IN ASTONISHMENT. 
UKRAINIANS WERE FIGHTING 

01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:43.053
RUSSIANS AND COUNTED ON NOT ONLY
THE TRAINING AND WEAPONS BUT 

01:37:43.252 --> 01:37:48.740
ASSURANCE OF U. S. SUPPORT. ALL 
THE STAFF PERSON SAID WAS THAT 

01:37:48.941 --> 01:37:52.133
THE DIRECTIVE HAD COME FROM THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF

01:37:56.047 --> 01:37:58.282
AND OMB. IN AN INSTANCE, I 
REALIZE THAT ONE OF THE KEY 

01:37:58.498 --> 01:38:00.520
BUILDERS OF OUR STRONG SUPPORT 
FOR UKRAINE WAS THREATENED IN 

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.188
THE REGULAR SEA POLICY JENNA WAS
RUNNING CONTRARY TO THE GOALS OF

01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:10.073
LONG-STANDING U. S. POLICY. IT 
FOLLOWED A SERIES OF MEETINGS 

01:38:10.273 --> 01:38:14.541
STARTING AT THE STAFF LEVEL AND 
QUICKLY REACHING THE LEVEL OF 

01:38:15.304 --> 01:38:18.012
CABINET SECRETARIES. AT EVERY 
MEETING, THE UNANIMOUS 

01:38:18.194 --> 01:38:20.194
CONCLUSION WAS THAT THEY SHOULD 
BE RESUMED

01:38:24.294 --> 01:38:26.326
IN THE HOLE LIFTED. AT ONE 
POINT, THEY WERE ASKED TO 

01:38:26.526 --> 01:38:29.778
PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE 
EFFECTIVENESS AND WITHIN A DAY, 

01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:32.014
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CAME BACK
WITH A DETERMINATION THAT IT WAS

01:38:32.216 --> 01:38:34.216
EFFECTIVE AND SHOULD BE RESUMED.

01:38:37.701 --> 01:38:39.701
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND STATE 

01:38:39.724 --> 01:38:41.355
AND THE CIA DIRECTOR AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS 

01:38:41.356 --> 01:38:43.389
SOUGHT A JOINT MEETING TO 
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT TO 

01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:47.043
RELEASE THE HOLD BUT SUCH A 
MEETING WAS HARD TO SCHEDULE IN 

01:38:47.658 --> 01:38:54.146
THE HOLD LASTED WELL INTO 
SEPTEMBER. ON JULY 9 AND A PHONE

01:38:54.359 --> 01:38:56.359
CALL WITHIN SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR 
EUROPEAN AND RUSSIAN AFFAIRS, 

01:38:56.595 --> 01:39:02.068
FIONA HILL AND DIRECTOR OF 
EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AT THE NFC 

01:39:02.481 --> 01:39:08.367
TRYING TO ASSURE ME THAT THEY 
WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY OFFICIAL 

01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.604
CHANGE IN U. S. POLICY TOWARDS 
UKRAINE AND ON THESE 

01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:15.074
ANNOUNCEMENT NOTWITHSTANDING. 
THEY DID CONFIRM THAT THE HOLD 

01:39:15.275 --> 01:39:18.939
ON SECURITY SYSTEMS FOR UKRAINE 
CAME FROM CHIEF OF STAFF WHO 

01:39:19.139 --> 01:39:24.828
MAINTAIN A SKEPTICAL VIEW OF 
UKRAINE. ON THE SAME JULY 19 

01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:27.984
PHONE CALL, THEY GAVE ME AN 
ACCOUNT OF A JULY 10 MEETING 

01:39:28.161 --> 01:39:30.161
WITH UKRAINIAN AND AMERICAN 
OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND

01:39:30.652 --> 01:39:37.017
TOLD ME THAT PART WITHIN THE 
MEANING, THE AMBASSADOR HAD 

01:39:37.418 --> 01:39:42.447
INVESTIGATIONS WITH AN OVAL 
OFFICE MEETING AND THEN JOHN 

01:39:42.617 --> 01:39:48.392
BOLTON ABRUPTLY ENDED THE 
MEETING SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD 

01:39:48.591 --> 01:39:53.262
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH DOMESTIC
POLITICS. HE ALSO DIRECTED DR. 

01:39:53.462 --> 01:39:57.888
HILL TO BRACE THE LAWYERS. DR. 
HILL SAID THAT AMBASSADOR VOLKER

01:39:59.766 --> 01:40:04.168
REFERRED TO THE DEAL AS A DRUG 
DEAL AFTER THE MEETING. INVESTOR

01:40:04.347 --> 01:40:09.104
BOLTON OPPOSED THE CALL BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND PRESIDENT

01:40:09.318 --> 01:40:12.768
TRUMP OUT OF CONCERN THAT IT 
WOULD BE A DISASTER . NEEDLESS 

01:40:12.969 --> 01:40:15.735
TO SAY, THE UKRAINE'S IN THE 
MEETING WERE CONFUSED.

01:40:20.888 --> 01:40:22.517
THE DECISION-MAKING CHANNEL 
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SECURITY 

01:40:22.518 --> 01:40:24.518
AND ENERGY AND REFORM.

01:40:27.389 --> 01:40:29.422
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ORIGINAL, 
THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE 

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:31.623
CONNECTION BETWEEN A WHITE HOUSE
MEETING AND UKRAINIAN 

01:40:31.764 --> 01:40:36.128
INVESTIGATIONS. DURING THE JULY 
19 CALL, DR. HILL INFORMED ME 

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:40.138
THAT AMBASSADOR VOLKER HAD MET 
WITH  MR. GIULIANI TO DISCUSS 

01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:43.852
UKRAINE WHICH CAUGHT ME BY 
SURPRISE AND NEXT I ASKED ABOUT 

01:40:44.617 --> 01:40:48.721
THAT MEETING BUT RECEIVED NO 
RESPONSE. I BEGAN TO SENSE THAT 

01:40:48.925 --> 01:40:52.787
THESE TWO SEPARATE 
DECISION-MAKING CHANNELS, THE 

01:40:52.987 --> 01:40:58.675
REGULAR AND IRREGULAR WERE 
SEPARATE. LATER THAT DAY, I 

01:40:58.875 --> 01:41:03.545
RECEIVED TEXT MESSAGES ON A 
THREE-WAY CONVERSATION WITH 

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:10.863
AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND SOLOMON . 
INVESTOR SOLOMON SAID THAT A 

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:12.895
CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WOULD TAKE 

01:41:12.896 --> 01:41:16.753
PLACE SOON  AND AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER SAID THAT WHAT WAS MOST 

01:41:16.956 --> 01:41:18.956
IMPORTANT WAS FOR 

01:41:21.838 --> 01:41:23.838
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO SAY THAT 
HE WOULD HELP INVESTIGATION AND 

01:41:23.858 --> 01:41:26.506
ADDRESS ANY PERSONAL ISSUES IF 
THERE ARE ANY.  ON THE NEXT DAY,

01:41:26.707 --> 01:41:30.974
I HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH 
INVESTOR SOLOMON WHILE HE WAS ON

01:41:31.176 --> 01:41:34.024
A TRAIN FROM PARIS TO LONDON. 
AMBASSADOR SOLOMON TOLD ME HE 

01:41:34.783 --> 01:41:37.420
HAD RECOMMENDED PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY THAT HE USE THE PHRASE 

01:41:38.088 --> 01:41:42.556
I WILL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED 
WITH REGARD TO INVESTIGATIONS 

01:41:43.519 --> 01:41:47.975
WHEN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SPOKE 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

01:41:55.150 --> 01:42:00.423
ALSO, ON JULY 20, I HAD A PHONE 
CONVERSATION WITH THE NATIONAL 

01:42:01.174 --> 01:42:05.106
SECURITY ADVISOR WHO EMPHASIZED 
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  DID NOT

01:42:05.307 --> 01:42:12.813
WANT TO BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT
IN A U. S. REELECTION CAMPAIGN. 

01:42:13.228 --> 01:42:19.318
THE NEXT DAY, I TALKED ABOUT 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S CONCERN  

01:42:19.719 --> 01:42:23.787
AND ON JULY 25, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  HAD THE 

01:42:23.988 --> 01:42:28.057
LONG-AWAITED PHONE CONVERSATION 
EVEN THOUGH I WAS ACTING 

01:42:28.257 --> 01:42:31.454
INVESTOR AND WAS SCHEDULED TO 
MEET WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND

01:42:35.163 --> 01:42:37.238
AMBASSADOR VOLKER, I RECEIVED NO
PHONE CALL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 

01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:39.995
AND THEY ISSUED A SHORT  CRYPTIC
SUMMARY. DURING A PREVIOUSLY 

01:42:40.166 --> 01:42:44.502
PLANNED JULY 26 MEETING, 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TOLD  

01:42:44.917 --> 01:42:47.637
AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND ME THAT HE
WAS HAPPY WITH THE CALL  BUT DID

01:42:48.315 --> 01:42:52.838
NOT ELABORATE. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY THEN ASKED ABOUT THE 

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.273
FACE-TO-FACE MEETING IN THE OVAL
OFFICE  AS PROMISED IN THE MAY 

01:42:55.473 --> 01:43:00.761
29 LETTER FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
WE COULD GIVE HIM NO FIRM 

01:43:00.962 --> 01:43:04.012
ANSWER. AFTER OUR MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, AMBASSADOR 

01:43:04.213 --> 01:43:07.183
VOLKER AND I TRAVELED TO THE  
FRONT LINE TO RECEIVE A BRIEFING

01:43:11.122 --> 01:43:13.153
FROM THE FORCES OF THE LINE OF 
CONTACT. ARRIVING FOR THE 

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:15.332
BRIEFING IN THE MILITARY 
HEADQUARTERS, THE COMMANDER 

01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:19.861
THANKED US BUT I WAS AWARE THAT 
THIS ASSISTANCE WAS ON HOLD 

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:23.711
WHICH MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE. 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND I COULD 

01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:28.338
SEE  THE RUSSIAN LED FORCES ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DAMAGED 

01:43:28.507 --> 01:43:32.245
BRIDGE ACROSS THE LINE OF 
CONTACT AND RUSSIAN LED FORCES 

01:43:32.446 --> 01:43:37.928
CONTINUED TO UKRAINIANS IN THE 
WAR ONE OR TWO A WEEK. 

01:43:38.129 --> 01:43:40.577
UKRAINIANS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY DIE
WITHOUT U. S. ASSISTANCE. 

01:43:40.978 --> 01:43:44.633
ALTHOUGH I SPENT THE MORNING OF 
JULY 26 WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:43:44.833 --> 01:43:48.643
AND OTHER OFFICIALS, THE FIRST 
SUMMARY  OF THE CALL THAT I 

01:43:48.816 --> 01:43:52.352
HEARD FROM ANYBODY INSIDE THE U.
S. GOVERNMENT WAS DURING A PHONE

01:43:52.553 --> 01:43:57.637
CALL I HAD WITH TIM MORRISON IN 
THE RECENT REPLACEMENT OF THE 

01:43:57.838 --> 01:44:02.920
NFC ON JULY 28. MR. MORRISON 
TOLD ME THAT THE CALL COULD'VE 

01:44:03.121 --> 01:44:05.556
BEEN BETTER AND THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAD SUGGESTED THAT 

01:44:05.756 --> 01:44:12.299
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  OR STAFF 
MEET WITH MR. GIULIANI AND THE 

01:44:13.022 --> 01:44:16.927
ATTORNEY GENERAL, WILLIAM BARR. 
I DID NOT SEE ANY OFFICIAL 

01:44:17.142 --> 01:44:20.393
READOUT OF THE CALL UNTIL IT WAS
PUBLICLY RELEASED ON THE TIMBER 

01:44:20.594 --> 01:44:24.656
25th AND BY AUGUST I WAS 
BECOMING MORE CONCERNED AND BY 

01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:27.418
AUGUST 15, I EXCHANGED TEXT 
MESSAGES IN WHICH I LEARNED THAT

01:44:28.514 --> 01:44:33.183
ANDRE, A SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD ASKED 

01:44:33.383 --> 01:44:35.778
THAT THE UNITED STATES SUBMIT  
AN OFFICIAL REQUEST OR 

01:44:35.948 --> 01:44:41.506
INVESTIGATION INTO THE ALLEGED 
VIOLATIONS OF UKRAINIAN LAW. 

01:44:41.921 --> 01:44:45.119
THAT IS WHAT THE UNITED STATES 
DESIRED IN THE FORMAL U. S. 

01:44:45.293 --> 01:44:50.042
REQUEST TO UKRAINIANS CONDUCTED 
AN INVESTIGATION BASED ON 

01:44:50.444 --> 01:44:53.428
VIOLATIONS OF THEIR OWN LAW AND 
IT STRUCK ME AS IMPROPER AND I 

01:44:53.607 --> 01:44:58.784
RECOMMENDED THAT THEY CLEAR TO 
FIND OUT THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF 

01:44:58.984 --> 01:45:03.856
THE QUESTION I GAVE HIM THE NAME
OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHOM I 

01:45:04.056 --> 01:45:06.089
THOUGHT WOULD BE THE PROPER 
POINT OF CONTACT FOR SEEKING THE

01:45:06.850 --> 01:45:12.390
U. S. REQUEST FOR A FOREIGN 
INVESTIGATION AND BY MID AUGUST 

01:45:12.589 --> 01:45:14.733
BECAUSE THIS HAD BEEN HELD FOR 
OVER A MONTH

01:45:19.093 --> 01:45:21.328
FOR NO REASON THAT I COULD 
DISCERN, I WAS BEGINNING TO FEAR

01:45:21.528 --> 01:45:23.528
THAT THE LONG-STANDING U. S. 
POLICY OF SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 

01:45:23.594 --> 01:45:28.035
WAS SHIFTING. I CALLED THE STATE
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL TO DISCUSS 

01:45:28.254 --> 01:45:32.501
THIS ON AUGUST 21 AND HE SAID HE
WAS NOT AWARE OF THE CHANGING 

01:45:32.702 --> 01:45:34.846
POLICY BUT WOULD CHECK ON THE 
ASSISTANCE.

01:45:38.388 --> 01:45:40.824
MY CONCERN DEEP IN THE NEXT DAY 
ON AUGUST 22 DURING A PHONE 

01:45:41.585 --> 01:45:43.874
CONVERSATION WITH MR. MORRISON. 
I ASKED HIM IF THERE HAD BEEN A 

01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:46.668
CHANGE IN POLICY OF STRONG 
SUPPORT UKRAINE FOR WHICH HE 

01:45:46.839 --> 01:45:51.594
RESPONDED, "IT REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN." HE ALSO TOLD ME DURING 

01:45:52.356 --> 01:45:54.846
THE CALL THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DOESN'T WANT TO PROVIDE ANY 

01:45:55.047 --> 01:46:00.737
ASSISTANCE AT ALL. THAT WAS 
EXTREMELY TROUBLING TO ME AS I 

01:46:01.499 --> 01:46:06.212
HAD TOLD SECRETARY POMPEO IN MAY
THAT IF IT WERE TO CHANGE, I 

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:09.462
WOULD HAVE TO RESIGN AND BASED 
ON MY CALL, I WAS PREPARING TO 

01:46:10.212 --> 01:46:17.800
DO SO. JUST DAYS LATER ON AUGUST
27, INVESTOR BOLTON ARRIVED IN 

01:46:17.999 --> 01:46:22.667
DURING THE MEETING, SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE WAS NOT DISCUSSED AND

01:46:22.869 --> 01:46:28.365
AS FAR AS I KNEW, THE UKRAINIANS
WERE NOT AWARE UNTIL AUGUST 29 

01:46:28.569 --> 01:46:31.405
OF THE HOLD AND I ON THE OTHER 
HAND WAS ALL TOO AWARE OF AND 

01:46:31.606 --> 01:46:36.636
TROUBLED BY IT. NEAR THE END OF 
THE VISIT, I ASKED TO MEET HIM 

01:46:36.816 --> 01:46:41.961
PRIVATELY WHICH I EXPRESSED TO 
HIM MY SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:46:42.175 --> 01:46:45.214
WITHHOLDING OF MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE WHILE THE 

01:46:45.415 --> 01:46:47.415
UKRAINIANS WERE DEFENDING THEIR 
COUNTRY FROM RUSSIAN AGGRESSION.

01:46:49.617 --> 01:46:54.711
BOLTON RECOMMENDED THAT I TALKED
TO SECRETARY POMPEO RELAYING MY 

01:46:54.885 --> 01:46:58.821
CONCERNS. I WROTE AND 
TRANSMITTED SUCH A CABLE ON 

01:46:59.573 --> 01:47:02.287
AUGUST 29 DESCRIBING THE FOLLY I
SAW HIM WITHHOLDING MILITARY AID

01:47:02.487 --> 01:47:04.487
TO UKRAINE WHEN

01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:11.223
THINGS WERE STILL ACTIVE IN THE 
EAST AND RUSSIA WAS WATCHING 

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:13.424
CLOSELY TO GAUGE THE LEVEL OF 
AMERICAN SUPPORT WITH THE 

01:47:13.458 --> 01:47:15.275
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT. THE 
RUSSIANS AS I SAID IN MY 

01:47:15.276 --> 01:47:18.327
DEPOSITION WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE
HUMILIATION OF PRESIDENT 

01:47:18.527 --> 01:47:21.687
ZELENSKY AT THE HANDS OF THE 
AMERICANS.  I TOLD THE SECRETARY

01:47:22.595 --> 01:47:28.699
THAT I COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT 
DEFEND SUCH A POLICY ALTHOUGH I 

01:47:28.898 --> 01:47:31.411
RECEIVED NO SPECIFIC RESPONSE, I
HEARD THAT SOON THEREAFTER, THE 

01:47:31.596 --> 01:47:34.327
SECRETARY CARRIED THE CABLE WITH
HIM TO A MEETING AT THE WHITE 

01:47:34.504 --> 01:47:37.629
HOUSE FOCUSED ON SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE IN THE 

01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:42.100
SAME DAY THAT I SENT MY CABLE TO
THE SECRETARY, MR. MARK 

01:47:42.504 --> 01:47:45.338
CONTACTED ME VERY CONCERN ASKING
ME ABOUT THE WITHHELD SECURITY 

01:47:45.552 --> 01:47:47.775
ASSISTANCE IN THE HOLD THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE HAD PLACED HAD JUST 

01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:52.400
BEEN MADE PUBLIC THAT DAY IN A 
POLITICAL STORY AND AT THAT 

01:47:52.575 --> 01:47:56.310
POINT I WAS EMBARRASSED THAT I 
COULD GIVE HIM NO EXPLANATION 

01:47:56.725 --> 01:48:00.212
FOR WHY. IT HAD STILL NOT 
OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE HOLD ON 

01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:05.050
SECURITY ASSISTANCE COULD BE 
RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATIONS. 

01:48:05.451 --> 01:48:09.105
THAT HOWEVER WOULD CHANGE. ON 
SEPTEMBER 1, JUST THREE DAYS 

01:48:09.319 --> 01:48:12.355
AFTER MY CABLE TO SECRETARY 
POMPEO, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY MET  

01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:18.860
VICE PRESIDENT PENTZ AT A 
MEETING IN WARSAW AND PRESIDENT 

01:48:19.061 --> 01:48:21.321
TRUMP HAD PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO 
WARSAW BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE 

01:48:21.508 --> 01:48:26.378
CANCELED BECAUSE OF HURRICANE 
DORIAN. HOURS BEFORE THE PENTZ 

01:48:26.778 --> 01:48:29.167
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY MEETING, I 
CONTACTED TO LET THEM KNOW THAT 

01:48:29.829 --> 01:48:32.554
THE DELAY OF U. S. ASSISTANCE 
WAS ALL OR NOTHING PROPOSITION 

01:48:32.729 --> 01:48:35.116
IN THE SENSE THAT IF THE WHITE 
HOUSE DID NOT LIST THE HOLD 

01:48:35.317 --> 01:48:39.986
PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FISCAL 
YEAR, THE FUNDS WOULD EXPIRE IN 

01:48:40.187 --> 01:48:44.202
UKRAINE WOULD RECEIVE NOTHING. I
WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE BILATERAL 

01:48:44.373 --> 01:48:47.702
MEETING OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER, 
THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD LIFT THE 

01:48:47.903 --> 01:48:52.784
HOLD BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE. ON 
THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 1, I 

01:48:52.986 --> 01:48:55.782
RECEIVED A READOUT OF THE 
MEETING OVER THE PHONE WITH MR. 

01:48:55.956 --> 01:48:59.692
MORRISON DURING WHICH HE TOLD ME
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD 

01:48:59.893 --> 01:49:02.341
OPENED THE MEETING BY MERELY 
ASKING  THE VICE PRESIDENT ABOUT

01:49:03.091 --> 01:49:06.395
THE SECURITY AND VICE PRESIDENT 
DID NOT RESPOND BUT SAID HE 

01:49:07.152 --> 01:49:09.760
WOULD TALK TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THAT NIGHT.

01:49:14.112 --> 01:49:16.144
THE VICE PRESIDENT DID SAY THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ONE OF THE 

01:49:16.347 --> 01:49:18.378
EUROPEANS TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT 
UKRAINE AND THAT HE WANTED 

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:22.848
UKRAINE TO DO MORE TO FIGHT 
CORRUPTION. DURING THE SAME 

01:49:23.049 --> 01:49:30.355
PHONE CALL, HE DESCRIBED A PHONE
CALL THAT WAS HAD IN WARSAW AND 

01:49:30.771 --> 01:49:34.022
INVESTOR SOLOMON SAID THAT THE 
MONEY WOULD NOT COME UNTIL 

01:49:34.222 --> 01:49:42.344
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  COMMITTED TO
PURSUE THE INVESTIGATION. I WAS 

01:49:42.546 --> 01:49:45.013
ALARMED BY WHAT MR. MORRISON 
TOLD ME ABOUT THE CONVERSATION 

01:49:45.194 --> 01:49:48.256
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MR. 
MORRISON TESTIFIED IN HIS 

01:49:48.987 --> 01:49:52.665
DEPOSITION THAT INVESTOR SO MY 
PROPOSAL MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT FOR

01:49:52.847 --> 01:49:57.785
THE GENERAL TO PURSUE THE 
INVESTIGATIONS AS OPPOSED TO 

01:49:58.187 --> 01:50:01.157
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY BUT THIS WAS 
THE FIRST TIME  THAT I HAD HEARD

01:50:02.856 --> 01:50:04.892
THAT THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND
NOT JUST THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING

01:50:05.656 --> 01:50:07.656
WAS CONDITIONED ON THE 
INVESTIGATIONS.

01:50:10.993 --> 01:50:13.989
VERY CONCERNED ON THAT SAME DAY,
SEPTEMBER 1, I SENT INVESTOR 

01:50:14.161 --> 01:50:19.112
SOLOMON A TEXT MESSAGE ASKING IF
NOW WE ARE SAYING THAT THE 

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:24.197
SECURITY IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING ON CONDITIONED ON THE 

01:50:24.398 --> 01:50:26.016
INVESTIGATION AND INVESTOR 
SOLOMON RESPONDED ASKING ME TO 

01:50:26.017 --> 01:50:28.666
CALL HIM WHICH I DID AND DURING 
THAT PHONE CALL, INVESTOR 

01:50:28.867 --> 01:50:32.120
SOLOMON TOLD ME THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WANTS

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.970
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  TO STATE 
PUBLICLY THAT UKRAINE WILL 

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:40.594
INVESTIGATE CHARISMA AND 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 

01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:46.337
ELECTION. INVESTOR SOLOMON ALSO 
TOLD ME THAT HE NOW RECOGNIZED 

01:50:46.739 --> 01:50:51.608
THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE BY 
EARLY TELLER UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS

01:50:51.822 --> 01:50:55.878
THAT ONLY A WHITE HOUSE MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WAS 

01:50:56.078 --> 01:50:57.509
DEPENDENT ON A PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE 

01:50:57.510 --> 01:51:02.582
INVESTIGATION  AND IN FACT, 
INVESTOR SOLOMON SAID EVERYTHING

01:51:02.782 --> 01:51:04.782
WAS DEPENDENT ON SUCH AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT INCLUDING SECURITY 

01:51:04.819 --> 01:51:06.819
ASSISTANCE. HE SAID PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WANTED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:11.720
IN A PUBLIC BOX BY MAKING A 
PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT ORDERING 

01:51:12.482 --> 01:51:14.482
SUCH INVESTIGATIONS

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:19.997
AND I TOLD INVESTOR SOLOMON THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD HAVE MORE

01:51:20.178 --> 01:51:23.825
RESPECT FOR ANOTHER HEAD OF 
STATE AND THAT WHAT HE DESCRIBED

01:51:24.173 --> 01:51:27.156
WAS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF 
EITHER PRESIDENT TRUMP OR 

01:51:27.357 --> 01:51:31.223
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.  AT THAT 
POINT I ASKED TO PUSH BACK ON 

01:51:31.983 --> 01:51:37.516
THE DEMAND AND INVESTOR SOLOMON 
PLEDGED TO TRY. I ADJUSTED THE 

01:51:38.131 --> 01:51:43.618
POSSIBILITY THAT UKRAINIAN 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL WOULD MAKE A 

01:51:43.819 --> 01:51:45.819
STATEMENT ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATIONS POTENTIALLY IN 

01:51:46.187 --> 01:51:51.080
COORDINATION WITH ATTORNEY 
GENERAL BARS PROBE INTO THE 

01:51:51.249 --> 01:51:53.249
ELECTIONS. THE NEXT DAY

01:51:55.806 --> 01:51:59.915
, MR. MORRISON CALLED TO INFORM 
ME THAT HE WAS ASKED TO COME TO 

01:52:00.217 --> 01:52:06.562
HIS HOTEL AND HE EXPRESSED 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S CONCERN 

01:52:06.777 --> 01:52:10.428
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF U. S.
SUPPORT  FOR UKRAINE. IN 

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:14.284
PARTICULAR, MR. MORRISON RELAYED
TO ME THAT THE INABILITY OF ANY 

01:52:14.485 --> 01:52:18.553
U. S. OFFICIALS TO RESPOND TO 
UKRAINE'S EXPLICIT QUESTIONS 

01:52:18.754 --> 01:52:21.602
ABOUT SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS 
TROUBLING THEM AND I WAS 

01:52:21.806 --> 01:52:25.189
EXPECTING THE SAME TENSION IN MY
DEALINGS INCLUDING A MEETING I 

01:52:25.367 --> 01:52:31.177
HAD WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER 
THAT DAY. ON SEPTEMBER 5, I 

01:52:31.892 --> 01:52:36.026
ACCOMPANIED SATURDAY JOHNSON AND
MURPHY DURING THEIR VISIT AND 

01:52:36.427 --> 01:52:42.930
WHEN WE MET, IT WAS ABOUT THE 
WITHHELD SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN 

01:52:43.131 --> 01:52:46.382
MY RECOLLECTION OF THE MEETING 
IS THAT BOTH SENATORS STRESSED 

01:52:46.582 --> 01:52:51.251
THAT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR 
UKRAINE IN WASHINGTON WAS 

01:52:51.453 --> 01:52:54.916
UKRAINE'S MOST IMPORTANT 
STRATEGIC ASSET AND THAT 

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.368
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SHOULD NOT 
JEOPARDIZE  THAT SUPPORT BY 

01:52:58.569 --> 01:53:01.737
GETTING DRAWN IN TO U. S. 
DOMESTIC POLICY.

01:53:05.882 --> 01:53:08.516
I HAVE BEEN MAKING AND CONTINUED
TO MAKE THIS POINT TO ALL OF MY 

01:53:08.729 --> 01:53:11.515
OFFICIAL CONTACTS BUT THE ODD 
PUSH TO MAKE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:53:12.995 --> 01:53:16.645
PUBLICLY SUBMIT TO 
INVESTIGATIONS OF CHARISMA AND 

01:53:16.848 --> 01:53:20.514
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016
ELECTION SHOWED HOW THE OFFICIAL

01:53:20.711 --> 01:53:23.961
FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED 
STATES WAS UNDERCUT BY THE 

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:30.661
REGULAR EFFORTS LED BY MR. 
GIULIANI. A FEW DAYS LATER, 

01:53:30.864 --> 01:53:34.313
SEPTEMBER 7, I HAD A 
CONVERSATION WITH MR. MORRISON 

01:53:34.515 --> 01:53:36.911
IN WHICH HE DESCRIBED A PHONE 
CALL BETWEEN INVESTOR SOLOMON 

01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:40.611
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE SAID HE 
HAD A SINKING HEALING AFTER 

01:53:40.812 --> 01:53:42.812
LEARNING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION

01:53:45.895 --> 01:53:47.527
FROM INVESTOR SOLOMON AND 
ACCORDING TO MR. MORRISON, 

01:53:47.528 --> 01:53:49.548
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD INVESTOR 
SOLOMON HE WAS NOT ASKING FOR A 

01:53:49.762 --> 01:53:56.049
QUID PRO QUO. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DID INSIST THAT PRESIDENT 

01:53:56.250 --> 01:54:00.045
ZELENSKY GO TO A MICROPHONE  AND
SAY HE IS OPENING INVESTIGATIONS

01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:06.620
OF BIDEN IN 2016 ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE. THAT PRESIDENT 

01:54:06.821 --> 01:54:10.018
ZELENSKY SHOULD WANT TO DO THIS 
HIMSELF.  MR. MORRISON SAID HE 

01:54:10.197 --> 01:54:12.197
TOLD

01:54:13.728 --> 01:54:15.548
AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND THE 
LAWYERS OF THIS PHONE CALL 

01:54:15.549 --> 01:54:17.549
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND  
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  AND THE 

01:54:17.997 --> 01:54:19.997
FOLLOWING DAY ON SEPTEMBER 8,

01:54:22.866 --> 01:54:25.098
INVESTOR SOLOMON AND I SPOKE ON 
THE PHONE AND HE CONFIRMED HE 

01:54:25.299 --> 01:54:27.299
TALKED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AS I 
SUGGESTED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:54:27.883 --> 01:54:30.783
WAS ADAMANT THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY HIMSELF  HAD TO CLEAR 

01:54:31.534 --> 01:54:36.684
THINGS UP AND DO IT IN PUBLIC. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT WAS NOT 

01:54:36.884 --> 01:54:42.166
A QUID PRO QUO. I BELIEVE THIS 
WAS THE SAME CONVERSATION 

01:54:42.368 --> 01:54:43.985
BETWEEN INVESTOR SOLOMON AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT MR. 

01:54:43.986 --> 01:54:46.179
MORRISON HAD DESCRIBED TO ME.

01:54:49.874 --> 01:54:51.874
INVESTOR SOLOMON ALSO SAID HE 
TALKED TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND

01:54:52.122 --> 01:54:56.589
MR. YOUR MARK AND HAD TOLD THEM 
THAT ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT A 

01:54:56.790 --> 01:55:01.612
QUID PRO QUO THAT IF PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY DID NOT  CLEAR THINGS 

01:55:01.794 --> 01:55:07.356
UP, WE WOULD BE AT A STALEMATE. 
I UNDERSTOOD ESTIMATE TO ME THAT

01:55:07.556 --> 01:55:13.391
IT WOULD NOT MEAN MUCH NEEDED 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE IN THIS 

01:55:13.561 --> 01:55:18.516
CONCLUDED WITH THE GREEN TO MAKE
A PUBLIC STATEMENT IN AN 

01:55:18.739 --> 01:55:24.364
INTERVIEW ON CNN. SHORTLY AFTER 
THAT CALL, I EXPRESSED MY STRONG

01:55:24.537 --> 01:55:28.188
RESERVATIONS TO INVESTOR SOLOMON
STATING THAT MY NIGHTMARE

01:55:31.721 --> 01:55:33.956
IS THE DAY THE UKRAINIANS GIVE 
THE INTERVIEW AND DON'T GET THE 

01:55:34.722 --> 01:55:40.455
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. RUSSIANS 
LOVE IT AND I QUIT AND I WAS 

01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:42.902
SERIOUS. THE NEXT DAY I SAID TO 
INVESTOR SOLOMON THAT THE 

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.783
MESSAGE TO THE UKRAINIANS AND 
THE RUSSIANS THAT WE SEND WITH 

01:55:47.957 --> 01:55:51.625
SECURITY ASSISTANCE IS KEY. WITH
THE HOLD WE HAVE ALREADY SHAKEN 

01:55:51.839 --> 01:55:56.707
THEIR FAITH IN US AND ALSO SAID 
I THINK IT IS CRAZY TO WITHHOLD 

01:55:57.469 --> 01:55:59.889
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR HELP 
WITH THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.

01:56:04.831 --> 01:56:06.831
INVESTOR SOLOMON RESPONDED ABOUT
FIVE HOURS LATER THAT I WAS 

01:56:06.866 --> 01:56:09.579
INCORRECT ABOUT THE INTENTIONS 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

01:56:09.916 --> 01:56:11.916
CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT NO

01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:17.422
QUID PRO QUOS OF ANY TIME. 
DURING THE MEETING ON THE CALL 

01:56:17.636 --> 01:56:22.706
ON SEPTEMBER 8, INVESTOR SOLOMON
TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO ME THAT THE 

01:56:22.906 --> 01:56:25.692
BUSINESSMAN WAS ABOUT TO SIGN A 
CHECK TO SOMEONE WHO OWES THEM 

01:56:25.948 --> 01:56:28.805
SOMETHING AND HE ASKED THAT 
PERSON TO PAY UP BEFORE SIGNING 

01:56:29.565 --> 01:56:34.091
THE CHECK. HE USES SAME LANGUAGE
SEVERAL DAYS LATER WHILE WE WERE

01:56:34.291 --> 01:56:39.775
TOGETHER AT THE STRATEGY 
CONFERENCE AND I ARGUED THAT THE

01:56:39.975 --> 01:56:43.226
EXPLANATION MAY NO SENSE. 
UKRAINIANS DO NOT OWE PRESIDENT 

01:56:43.988 --> 01:56:46.276
TRUMP ANYTHING IN HOLDING 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR 

01:56:47.036 --> 01:56:51.150
POLITICAL GAIN WAS CRAZY AS I 
HAD SAID IN MY TEXT MESSAGE ON 

01:56:51.907 --> 01:56:56.723
SEPTEMBER 9. FINALLY, ON 
SEPTEMBER 11, I LEARNED THAT THE

01:56:56.893 --> 01:57:00.904
HOLD HAD BEEN LIFTED AND 
ASSISTANCE WOULD BE PROVIDED. I 

01:57:01.105 --> 01:57:05.158
WAS NOT TOLD THE RECENT WHY THE 
HOLD HAD BEEN LIFTED AND THE 

01:57:05.372 --> 01:57:07.372
NEXT DAY I PERSONALLY CONVEYED 
THE NEWS TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:11.057
IN THE  UKRAINIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND I REMINDED OF THE 

01:57:11.459 --> 01:57:15.927
HIGH STRATEGIC VALUE OF 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 

01:57:16.328 --> 01:57:18.777
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT 
GETTING INVOLVED IN OTHER 

01:57:18.977 --> 01:57:23.247
COUNTRIES ELECTIONS AND I FEARED
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD 

01:57:23.447 --> 01:57:28.118
ALREADY AGREED  TO AN INTERVIEW 
AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WOULD 

01:57:28.319 --> 01:57:31.169
MAKE A STATEMENT REGARDING  
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WOULD PLAY 

01:57:31.931 --> 01:57:36.038
INTO POLITICS. THIS WAS 
CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT 

01:57:36.237 --> 01:57:38.407
ZELENSKY WAS NOT PLANNING TO 
GIVE SUCH AN INTERVIEW 

01:57:42.543 --> 01:57:44.543
WHILE THEY CONFIRMED ON 
SEPTEMBER 12, I NOTICED DURING A

01:57:44.577 --> 01:57:47.013
MEETING ON THE MORNING OF 
SEPTEMBER 13 AT PRESIDENT 

01:57:47.215 --> 01:57:53.099
ZELENSKY'S OFFICE THAT  THERE IS
AN CONVERTIBILITY TO THE 

01:57:53.304 --> 01:57:55.532
QUESTION AND THEN I ASKED TO 
CONFIRM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO 

01:57:55.748 --> 01:58:02.441
CNN INTERVIEW WHICH HE DID. ON 
THE 25th AT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:05.895
SESSION IN YORK CITY, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP MET PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:58:06.096 --> 01:58:08.947
FACE TO FACE AND ALSO RELEASED 
THE TRANSCRIPT  OF THE JULY 25 

01:58:09.185 --> 01:58:15.248
CALL IN THE 19th GAVE UKRAINIANS
VIRTUALLY NO NOTICE. THIS WAS 

01:58:15.650 --> 01:58:18.082
THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THE 
DETAILS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

01:58:18.283 --> 01:58:21.736
JULY 25 CALL WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  IN WHICH HE MENTIONED 

01:58:22.150 --> 01:58:25.604
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, I HAVE 
COME TO UNDERSTAND WELL BEFORE 

01:58:26.363 --> 01:58:31.642
THEN THAT INVESTIGATIONS WITH 
THE TERM AMBASSADOR VOLKER  USED

01:58:33.317 --> 01:58:38.532
WITH THE 2016 ELECTIONS AND TO 
THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 

01:58:38.704 --> 01:58:40.704
BIDENS.

01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:50.791
LAST FRIDAY, A MEMBER OF MY 
STAFF TOLD ME OF EVENTS OF THE 

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:57.089

AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND I VISITED 

01:58:57.290 --> 01:59:01.759

ACCOMPANIED INVESTOR SOLOMON. 

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:06.024
FOLLOWING THAT MEETING IN THE 
PRESENCE OF MY STAFF AT A

01:59:10.491 --> 01:59:12.491

01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:18.815
A MEMBER OF MY STAFF COULD HEAR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE PHONE 

01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:21.030
ASKING INVESTOR SOLOMON ABOUT 
THE INVESTIGATIONS AND INVESTOR 

01:59:21.184 --> 01:59:25.521
SOLOMON SAID THAT THE UKRAINIANS
WERE READY TO MOVE FORWARD. 

01:59:25.937 --> 01:59:28.319
FOLLOWING THE CALL WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, A MEMBER OF MY 

01:59:28.498 --> 01:59:30.889
STAFF ASKED INVESTOR SOLOMON 
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP THOUGHT 

01:59:31.088 --> 01:59:35.074
ABOUT UKRAINE AND HE RESPONDED 
THAT HE CARES MORE ABOUT THE 

01:59:35.276 --> 01:59:39.331
INVESTIGATIONS OF BIDEN WHICH 
GIULIANI WAS PRESSING FOR AND AT

01:59:39.546 --> 01:59:42.096
THE TIME I GET MY DEPOSITION ON 
OCTOBER 22

01:59:45.634 --> 01:59:48.423
, I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS 
INFORMATION. I AM INCLUDING IT 

01:59:48.598 --> 01:59:51.164
HERE AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS, I 
REPORTED THIS INFORMATION 

01:59:51.878 --> 01:59:55.588
THROUGH COUNSEL WITH THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT LEGAL ADVISOR AS WELL

01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:58.427
AS TO COUNSEL FOR BOTH MAJORITY 
AND MINORITY OF THIS COMMITTEE. 

01:59:58.628 --> 02:00:01.077
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 
COMMITTEE IS FOLLOWING UP ON 

02:00:01.835 --> 02:00:07.361
THIS MATTER. MR. CHAIRMAN, I 
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A RATHER 

02:00:08.112 --> 02:00:11.646
LENGTHY RECITATION OF THE EVENTS
OF THE PAST FEW MONTHS FROM MY 

02:00:12.248 --> 02:00:18.534
VANTAGE POINT AND MR. KENT'S BUT
I ALSO LOOK AT THE MATTERS YOUR 

02:00:18.748 --> 02:00:22.199
COMMITTEE IS INVEST GETTING AND 
I HOPE THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME 

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:26.800
FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. AS
I MENTIONED IN MY OCTOBER 22 

02:00:26.969 --> 02:00:30.483
DEPOSITION, INFORMATION" IN MY 
TESTIMONY ARE BASED ON MY BEST 

02:00:30.659 --> 02:00:37.019
RECOLLECTION AS WELL AS A REVIEW
OF MY PERSONAL NOTE. LET ME 

02:00:37.234 --> 02:00:41.289
RETURN TO THE POINTS THAT I MADE
ON THE OFFSET. UKRAINE IS 

02:00:41.489 --> 02:00:45.959
IMPORTANT TO THE SECURITY OF THE
UNITED STATES AND THE LARGEST 

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.160
COUNTRY IN EUROPE BY LANDMASS, 
UKRAINE IS A YOUNG DEMOCRACY 

02:00:48.193 --> 02:00:52.448
STRUGGLING TO JOIN EUROPE AND 
ALIGN ITSELF WITH UNITED STATES.

02:00:53.278 --> 02:00:58.716
IT HAS BEEN WIDELY ATTACKED BY 
RUSSIA WHICH INCLUDES TO THIS 

02:00:58.883 --> 02:01:03.437
DAY AND WE BELIEVE IN THE 
PRINCIPLE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF 

02:01:03.636 --> 02:01:07.249
NATIONS ON WHICH OUR SECURITY 
AND THE SECURITY OF OUR FRIENDS 

02:01:07.846 --> 02:01:12.116
AND ALLIES IF WE BELIEVE NATIONS
GET TO DECIDE ON THEIR OWN 

02:01:12.286 --> 02:01:15.208
ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SECURITY 
ALLIANCES, WE MUST SUPPORT 

02:01:15.422 --> 02:01:19.023
UKRAINE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
THIS BULLYING NEIGHBOR. RUSSIAN 

02:01:19.833 --> 02:01:21.833
AGGRESSION NOT STANDING.

02:01:24.959 --> 02:01:26.589
DEMOCRATIC DEMONSTRATIONS OVER 
THREE DECADES HAVE BEEN GENEROUS

02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:28.623
WITH ASSISTANCE FUNDING BOTH 
CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AND 

02:01:29.388 --> 02:01:32.210
POLITICAL SUPPORT WITH 
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN 

02:01:32.375 --> 02:01:37.553
MAJORITIES, CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED
HARSH SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA FOR 

02:01:37.765 --> 02:01:39.765
INVADING AND OCCUPYING

02:01:43.047 --> 02:01:48.732
UKRAINE. THERE ARE TWO UKRAINE 
STORIES TODAY AND THE FIRST IS 

02:01:48.932 --> 02:01:50.966
THE ONE WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS 
MORNING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

02:01:51.167 --> 02:01:53.401
HEARING ABOUT FOR THE PAST TWO 
WEEKS. IT IS A STORY ABOUT 

02:01:53.804 --> 02:01:57.667
WHISTLEBLOWERS AND MR. JULIANO 
AND SIDE CHANNELS IN CORRUPTION 

02:01:57.868 --> 02:02:02.270
AND INTERFERENCE IN ELECTION. IN
THIS STORY, UKRAINE IS MERELY AN

02:02:02.442 --> 02:02:10.670
OBJECT. BUT, THERE IS ANOTHER 
STORY. A POSITIVE BY PERSON 

02:02:10.871 --> 02:02:13.308
WANTED TO THE SECOND STORY, 
UKRAINE IS THE SUBJECT. THIS ONE

02:02:13.508 --> 02:02:17.978
IS ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE IN A YOUNG
NATION STRUGGLING TO BREAK FREE 

02:02:18.178 --> 02:02:22.846
OF ITS PAST AND HOPEFUL THAT THE
NEW GOVERNMENT WILL FINALLY 

02:02:23.061 --> 02:02:27.732
USHER IN A NEW UKRAINE PROUD OF 
ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM RUSSIA 

02:02:28.134 --> 02:02:31.787
EAGER TO JOIN WESTERN 
INSTITUTIONS AND ENJOY A MORE 

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.268
SECURE AND PROSPEROUS LIFE. THIS
STORY DESCRIBES A NATION 

02:02:37.485 --> 02:02:38.699
DEVELOPING AN INCLUSIVE 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONALISM NOT 

02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:44.989
UNLIKE WHAT WE IN AMERICA IN OUR
BEST MOMENTS FEEL ABOUT OUR 

02:02:45.190 --> 02:02:47.023
DIVERSE COUNTRY WITH LESS 
CONCERN ABOUT WHAT LANGUAGE WE 

02:02:47.024 --> 02:02:50.074
SPEAK AND WHAT RELIGION IF ANY 
WE PRACTICE AND WHERE OUR 

02:02:50.314 --> 02:02:52.922
PARENTS AND GRAND PARENTS CAME 
FROM AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 

02:02:53.123 --> 02:02:55.123
BUILDING A NEW COUNTRY.

02:02:59.009 --> 02:03:00.649
I AM NOW LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR
QUESTIONS. 

02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:02.875
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR 
TESTIMONY AND I NOW RECOGNIZE  

02:03:03.075 --> 02:03:05.455
MYSELF IN MAJORITY COUNSEL FOR 
45 MINUTES OF QUESTIONS. 

02:03:05.456 --> 02:03:09.579
&gt;&gt;  I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY 
FOLLOWING UP WITH SOMETHING YOU 

02:03:09.779 --> 02:03:11.608
HAVE DISCLOSED TODAY AND 
DISCLOSED EARLIER TO BOTH 

02:03:11.609 --> 02:03:15.599
MAJORITY AND MINORITY BUT IT IS 
NEW INFORMATION FOR THE 

02:03:15.769 --> 02:03:22.368
COMMITTEE. YOU SAID IN YOUR 
TESTIMONY THAT ONE OF YOUR STAFF

02:03:23.117 --> 02:03:27.575
WAS PRESENT WITH INVESTOR 
SOLOMON AFTER THE JULY 25

02:03:31.918 --> 02:03:33.748
PHONE CALL. IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

02:03:33.749 --> 02:03:38.003
&gt;&gt; AS YOUR STAFF  RELAYED THE 
EVENT TO YOU, YOUR STAFF MEMBER 

02:03:38.218 --> 02:03:40.218
WOULD OVERHEAR MR. SOLOMON ON 
THE PHONE

02:03:43.501 --> 02:03:45.722
AND OVERHEAR THE PRESENT ON THE 
PHONE WITH MR. SOLOMON. IS THAT 

02:03:45.937 --> 02:03:49.174
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

02:03:49.175 --> 02:03:51.175
&gt;&gt; THE PRESENT MUST'VE BEEN 
SPEAKING LOUD ENOUGH ON THE 

02:03:51.212 --> 02:03:53.244
PHONE AND THIS WAS A CELL PHONE 
I TAKE IT? 

02:03:53.245 --> 02:03:55.881
&gt;&gt;  IT WAS A CELL PHONE. 
&gt;&gt;  THEY MUST BE SPEAKING LOUD 

02:03:56.083 --> 02:03:59.948
ENOUGH TO OVERHEAR THIS? 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS.  

02:03:59.949 --> 02:04:03.961
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOUR STAFF MEMBER COULD 
OVERHEAR  WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:04:04.193 --> 02:04:06.193
ASKING

02:04:12.751 --> 02:04:13.965
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS. IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

02:04:13.966 --> 02:04:15.784
&gt;&gt; IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU TESTIFIED ALSO 

02:04:15.785 --> 02:04:18.031
THAT YOU HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT THE TERM INVESTIGATIONS WAS

02:04:18.233 --> 02:04:20.267
A TERM THAT INVESTOR SOLOMON AS 
WELL AS AMBASSADOR VOLKER USED 

02:04:20.467 --> 02:04:27.570
TO MEAN  WITH THE ELECTIONS IN 
THE INVESTIGATIONS OF CHARISMA 

02:04:27.771 --> 02:04:31.024
AND BIDEN. IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; IS CORRECT .  

02:04:31.025 --> 02:04:33.025
&gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT ASKING
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS  

02:04:33.413 --> 02:04:37.124
MEANING CHARISMA AND THAT BIDENS
AND INVESTOR SOLOMON TOLD 

02:04:37.324 --> 02:04:40.975
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THE 
UKRAINIANS WERE READY TO MOVE 

02:04:41.178 --> 02:04:44.227
FORWARD? 
&gt;&gt;  HE DID. 

02:04:44.228 --> 02:04:46.875
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU SAID THAT AFTER 
THE CALL  WHEN YOUR STAFF ASKED 

02:04:47.478 --> 02:04:52.961
INVESTOR SOLOMON WHAT HE THOUGHT
OF UKRAINE, HIS RESPONSE WAS 

02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:57.027
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CARES MORE 
ABOUT BIDEN, IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:04:57.028 --> 02:05:03.327
&gt;&gt; AND  BARIZMA, YES SIR.  
&gt;&gt;  I TAKE IT THAT HE CARES MORE

02:05:03.527 --> 02:05:06.912
ABOUT THAT THAN HE DOES ABOUT 
UKRAINE. 

02:05:06.913 --> 02:05:08.913
&gt;&gt;  YES, SIR.

02:05:15.103 --> 02:05:17.103
&gt;&gt; DURING YOUR TESTIMONY 

02:05:19.975 --> 02:05:21.975
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU ALSO SAID
THAT MORE UKRAINIANS WOULD 

02:05:22.368 --> 02:05:25.815
UNDOUBTEDLY DIE WITHOUT U. S. 
ASSISTANCE. WHY IS THAT? 

02:05:25.816 --> 02:05:28.310
&gt;&gt;  MR. CHAIRMAN, THE SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TAKES

02:05:29.067 --> 02:05:35.410
MANY FORMS. ONE OF THE 
COMPONENTS OF THAT ASSISTANCE IS

02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.795
COUNTER BATTERY RADAR. ANOTHER 
COMPONENT IS STIPEND WEAPONS.

02:05:44.772 --> 02:05:50.785
THESE WEAPONS IN THIS ASSISTANCE
ALLOWS THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY TO

02:05:50.969 --> 02:05:58.116
DETER FURTHER INCURSIONS BY THE 
RUSSIANS AGAINST UKRAINIAN 

02:05:58.376 --> 02:06:04.258
TERRITORY. IF THAT FURTHER 
ENCOURAGES AGGRESSION AND THAT 

02:06:04.458 --> 02:06:10.560
WERE TO TAKE LACE, MORE 
UKRAINIANS WOULD DIE. IT IS A 

02:06:10.772 --> 02:06:14.412
DETERRENT EFFECT THAT THESE 
WEAPONS PROVIDE AND ALSO GIVES 

02:06:14.615 --> 02:06:20.303
THE UKRAINIANS THE ABILITY TO 
NEGOTIATE FROM A POSITION OF A 

02:06:20.516 --> 02:06:27.007
LITTLE MORE STRENGTH WHEN THEY 
NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE WAR 

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:31.071
NEGOTIATING WITH THE RUSSIANS 
AND THIS ALSO IS A WAY THAT 

02:06:31.271 --> 02:06:36.490
WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF 
UKRAINIANS THAT WOULD DIE. 

02:06:36.491 --> 02:06:44.195
&gt;&gt;  THIS WOULD SAVE UKRAINIAN 
LIVES AND IT MAY COST LIVES.

02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:54.970
&gt;&gt;  IT IS HARD TO DRAW ANY 
DIRECT LINES WITH ANY PARTICULAR

02:06:56.864 --> 02:06:59.865
DEATH ON THE BATTLEFIELD BUT IT 
IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE 

02:07:00.123 --> 02:07:06.755
ASSISTANCE HAD ENABLED FORCES TO
BE EFFECTIVE AND TO BE ABLE TO 

02:07:06.928 --> 02:07:10.628
TAKE COUNTERMEASURES THROUGH THE
ATTACKS.  

02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:15.759
&gt;&gt;  I THINK YOU SAID THAT THE 
SOLDIERS LOST THEIR LIFE WHILE 

02:07:15.959 --> 02:07:19.208
YOU ARE VISITING. 
&gt;&gt;  WE KEEP TRACK OF THE 

02:07:19.625 --> 02:07:25.109
CASUALTIES I NOTICED ON THE NEXT
DAY THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE

02:07:25.874 --> 02:07:32.370
GOT THAT FOR NUMBER KILLED. 
&gt;&gt;  INDEED, UKRAINIANS LOSE 

02:07:32.539 --> 02:07:35.623
THEIR LIVES EVERY WEEK. 
&gt;&gt; EVERY WEEK. 

02:07:39.931 --> 02:07:41.965
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU ALSO TESTIFIED 
THAT RUSSIA WAS WATCHING CLOSELY

02:07:42.166 --> 02:07:44.763
TO GET  THE LEVEL OF AMERICAN 
SUPPORT FOR THE UKRAINIAN 

02:07:44.936 --> 02:07:47.453
GOVERNMENT. WHY IS THAT 
SIGNIFICANT? 

02:07:47.454 --> 02:07:50.838
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SIGNIFICANT , MR. 
CHAIRMAN, BECAUSE UKRAINIANS IN 

02:07:51.026 --> 02:07:55.570
PARTICULAR UNDER THIS NEW 
ADMINISTRATION ARE EAGER TO END 

02:07:56.321 --> 02:08:01.670
THE WAR AND EAGER TO END IT IN A
WAY THAT THE RUSSIANS LEAVE 

02:08:02.429 --> 02:08:06.137
THEIR TERRITORY. THESE 
NEGOTIATIONS LIKE ALL 

02:08:06.338 --> 02:08:11.011
NEGOTIATIONS ARE DIFFICULT. 
UKRAINIANS WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE

02:08:11.412 --> 02:08:13.412
TO NEGOTIATE FROM

02:08:15.879 --> 02:08:17.914
A POSITION OF STRENGTH OR AT 
LEAST MORE STRENGTH THAN THEY 

02:08:18.679 --> 02:08:22.180
NOW HAVE. PART OF THAT STRENGTH 
AND ABILITY OF UKRAINIANS TO 

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:24.414
NEGOTIATE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS 
WITH THE RUSSIANS FOR AN END TO 

02:08:24.828 --> 02:08:26.828
THE WAR ON

02:08:29.498 --> 02:08:31.679
TRAVERTINE DEPENDS ON THE UNITED
STATES AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL 

02:08:31.916 --> 02:08:37.219
SUPPORT. IF WE WITHDRAW OR 
SUSPEND OR THREATEN TO WITHDRAW 

02:08:37.622 --> 02:08:44.322
OUR SECURITY ASSISTANCE, THAT IS
A MESSAGE TO THE UKRAINIANS BUT 

02:08:44.736 --> 02:08:47.117
AS YOUR QUESTION INDICATES, IT 
IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO THE 

02:08:47.287 --> 02:08:52.659
RUSSIANS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR 
ANY SIGN OF WEAKNESS OR ANY SIGN

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:54.478
THAT WE ARE WITHDRAWING OUR 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. 

02:08:54.479 --> 02:08:56.511
&gt;&gt; WHEN UKRAINIANS LEARNED  OF 
THE SUSPENSION OF THE MILITARY 

02:08:56.711 --> 02:09:00.376
AID OTHER PRIVATELY OR WHEN 
OTHERS LEARN PUBLICLY, THE 

02:09:00.576 --> 02:09:04.787
RUSSIANS WOULD BE LEARNING ALSO 
AND THEY WOULD TAKE THAT AS A 

02:09:05.021 --> 02:09:12.360
LACK OF ROBUST U. S. SUPPORT FOR
UKRAINE? IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:09:12.361 --> 02:09:14.796
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD WEAKEN  UKRAINE IN

02:09:14.996 --> 02:09:19.061
NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE WAR IN
DOMBAS. 

02:09:19.062 --> 02:09:23.678
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD.  
&gt;&gt;  PEOPLE WATCHING I'M SURE ARE

02:09:23.848 --> 02:09:28.004
INTERESTED IN HOW MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE AND A BLACK SUPPORT 

02:09:28.204 --> 02:09:33.276
FOR UKRAINE AFFECTS UKRAINE BUT 
EVEN MORE SO INTERESTED IN HOW 

02:09:33.479 --> 02:09:37.742
DOES THIS AFFECT OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY? I THINK YOU SAID THAT 

02:09:37.945 --> 02:09:42.212
IF WE BELIEVE IN A PRINCIPAL 
SOVEREIGNTY OF NATIONS WHERE 

02:09:42.412 --> 02:09:47.095
COUNTRIES GET TO DETERMINE THEIR
OWN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 

02:09:47.499 --> 02:09:50.040
SECURITY ALLIANCES, WE HAVE TO 
SUPPORT UKRAINE IN ITS FIGHT 

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:56.030
THAT THAT KIND OF AGGRESSION WE 
SEE CAN'T STAND. HOW IS IT 

02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:58.674
IMPORTANT TO AMERICAN NATIONAL 
SECURITY THAT WE PROVIDE FOR A 

02:09:59.437 --> 02:10:02.270
ROBUST DEFENSE OF UKRAINE 
SOVEREIGNTY? 

02:10:02.271 --> 02:10:09.643
&gt;&gt;  MR. CHAIRMAN, AS MIKE 
COLLEAGUES,  GEORGE KENT  

02:10:10.044 --> 02:10:12.211
DESCRIBED, WE HAVE A NATIONAL 
SECURITY POLICY AND DEFENSE 

02:10:12.385 --> 02:10:21.370
POLICY THAT IDENTIFIES RUSSIA 
AND CHINA AS ADVERSARIES. THE 

02:10:21.564 --> 02:10:27.911
RUSSIANS ARE VIOLATING ALL OF 
THE RULES AND TREATIES AND 

02:10:28.126 --> 02:10:30.126
UNDERSTANDINGS THAT THEY 
COMMITTED TO THAT ACTUALLY KEPT 

02:10:30.509 --> 02:10:38.484
THE PEACE IN EUROPE FOR NEARLY 
70 YEARS. UNTIL THEY INVADED 

02:10:38.885 --> 02:10:40.885
UKRAINE, THEY HAD ABIDED BY 
SOVEREIGNTY

02:10:44.986 --> 02:10:50.257
OF NATIONS AND IN VIABILITY OF 
BORDERS. THAT RULE OF LAW OR 

02:10:50.472 --> 02:10:54.682
ORDER THAT KEPT THE PEACE IN 
EUROPE AND ALLOWED FOR 

02:10:54.915 --> 02:10:59.404
PROSPERITY AS WELL AS PEACE IN 
EUROPE WAS VIOLATED AND IF WE 

02:10:59.604 --> 02:11:06.468
DON'T PUSH BACK ON THAT AND ON 
THOSE VIOLATIONS, THAT WILL 

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:09.463
CONTINUE. THAT, MR. CHAIRMAN

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:17.079
, AFFECTS US AND THE WORLD THAT 
WE LIVE IN THAT OUR CHILDREN 

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.280
WILL GROW UP IN AND OUR 
GRANDCHILDREN. THIS AFFECTS THE 

02:11:19.312 --> 02:11:23.781
KIND OF WORLD THAT WE WANT AND 
AFFECTS OUR NATIONAL INTEREST 

02:11:24.183 --> 02:11:27.834
DIRECTLY. UKRAINE IS ON THE 
FRONT LINE OF THAT CONFLICT. 

02:11:28.587 --> 02:11:32.718
&gt;&gt;  THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR 
DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE 

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:37.190
COUNTRY AND I KNOW RECOGNIZE MR.
GOLDMAN FOR QUESTIONING. 

02:11:37.191 --> 02:11:40.843
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.  
INVESTOR TAYLOR, ON THE HEELS OF

02:11:41.039 --> 02:11:43.689
DISCUSSING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE, 

02:11:44.093 --> 02:11:48.359
I WANT TO GO TO THE END OF THAT 
TIMELINE WHERE YOU LEARNED THAT 

02:11:48.559 --> 02:11:50.559
THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS 
CONDITIONED

02:11:54.446 --> 02:11:56.446
ON UKRAINE ANNOUNCING THE 
INVESTIGATION THAT THE PRESIDENT

02:11:56.587 --> 02:12:00.695
WANTED. IN PARTICULAR ON 
SEPTEMBER 9 OF THIS YEAR, YOU 

02:12:00.868 --> 02:12:02.868
TEXTED

02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.992
INVESTOR SOLOMON AND AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER. 

02:12:11.104 --> 02:12:13.753
THEY SHOULD BE ON THE SCREEN IN 
FRONT OF YOU. IF YOU COULD READ 

02:12:13.954 --> 02:12:15.986
WHAT YOU WROTE. 
&gt;&gt; AS I SAT ON THE PHONE, I 

02:12:16.187 --> 02:12:18.906
THINK IT IS CRAZY  TO WITHHOLD 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR HELP 

02:12:19.091 --> 02:12:23.492
WITH THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU MEAN THAT YOU 

02:12:23.706 --> 02:12:32.633
THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY ? 
&gt;&gt;  I MEANT THAT BECAUSE OF THE 

02:12:32.846 --> 02:12:37.514
IMPORTANCE OF SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE THAT WE HAD JUST 

02:12:37.715 --> 02:12:39.750
DESCRIBED AND HAD A CONVERSATION
WITH THE CHAIRMAN, BECAUSE THAT 

02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:45.636
WAS SO IMPORTANT AND IT WAS SO 
IMPORTANT FOR UKRAINE AS WELL IS

02:12:45.836 --> 02:12:50.506
OUR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST, TO 
WITHHOLD THAT ASSISTANCE FOR NO 

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:56.152
GOOD REASON OTHER THAN HELP WITH
A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MADE NO 

02:12:56.325 --> 02:13:01.283
SENSE. IT WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 
TO ALL OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN 

02:13:01.487 --> 02:13:06.558
TRYING TO DO. IT WAS ILLOGICAL 
AND COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED. IT 

02:13:06.759 --> 02:13:09.351
WAS CRAZY. 
&gt;&gt;  WHEN YOU SAY OF ALL OF WHAT 

02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:14.697
WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO, WHAT 
DO YOU MEAN BY "WE?" I WAS 

02:13:14.893 --> 02:13:18.256
TRYING TO SUPPORT  UKRAINE 
AGAINST RUSSIAN ATTACK AND AGAIN

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:28.297
, THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE RULE 
WAS BEEN THREATENED SO OUR 

02:13:28.498 --> 02:13:31.548
ASSISTANCE WAS DESIGNED TO 
SUPPORT UKRAINE. IT WAS NOT JUST

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:36.824
THE UNITED STATES BUT ALL OF OUR
ALLIES. 

02:13:36.825 --> 02:13:39.258
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU REFERENCE HELP WITH 
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN  IN THIS 

02:13:39.472 --> 02:13:44.699
TEXT MESSAGE, WHAT DID YOU MEAN?
&gt;&gt; I MEANT  THAT THE 

02:13:44.875 --> 02:13:46.875
INVESTIGATION OF

02:13:52.878 --> 02:13:54.695
BARIZMA AND THE BIDENS WAS 
CLEARLY IDENTIFIED BY MR. 

02:13:54.696 --> 02:13:59.914
GIULIANI IN PUBLIC FOR MONTHS  
AS A WAY TO GET INFORMATION ON 

02:14:00.083 --> 02:14:04.648
THE TWO BIDENS. 
&gt;&gt; THAT INVESTIGATION AT THE 

02:14:04.863 --> 02:14:09.118
VERY LEAST  WAS MENTIONED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE JULY 25 

02:14:09.332 --> 02:14:14.001
PHONE CALL WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY, IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:14:14.002 --> 02:14:19.688
&gt;&gt; AS WE NOW KNOW, YES.  ON 
SEPTEMBER 25, THAT TRANSCRIPT 

02:14:19.887 --> 02:14:21.887
WAS RELEASED. 
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR DECADES OF MILITARY 

02:14:21.922 --> 02:14:25.776
SERVICE  ORBITING THE UNITED 
STATES AROUND THE WORLD, HAVE 

02:14:25.976 --> 02:14:30.858
YOU EVER SEEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
FOREIGN AID CONDITIONED ON THE 

02:14:31.058 --> 02:14:34.869
PERSONAL OR POLITICAL INTEREST 
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

02:14:35.043 --> 02:14:38.320
STATES? 
&gt;&gt; NO, I HAVE NOT.  

02:14:38.321 --> 02:14:43.245
&gt;&gt;  MR. KENT, THAT VITAL 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE THAT WAS NOT

02:14:43.446 --> 02:14:49.133
THE ONLY THING THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS WITHHOLDING FROM 

02:14:49.351 --> 02:14:52.997
UKRAINE, WHAT ELSE WAS 
CONTINGENT ON UKRAINE INITIATING

02:14:53.759 --> 02:14:57.263
THESE INVESTIGATIONS? 
&gt;&gt; AS WE TALKED EARLIER TODAY , 

02:14:57.463 --> 02:15:00.058
THE POSSIBILITY OF A WHITE HOUSE
MEETING WAS BEING HELD 

02:15:00.235 --> 02:15:05.384
CONTINGENT TO AN ANNOUNCEMENT. 
&gt;&gt; HOW IMPORTANT TO  PRESIDENT 

02:15:05.596 --> 02:15:07.371
ZELENSKY WAS A WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING?  

02:15:07.372 --> 02:15:13.259
&gt;&gt;  NEW LEADERS AND PARTICULARLY
COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO 

02:15:13.442 --> 02:15:17.330
HAVE GOOD FOOTING IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ARENA SEE A 

02:15:17.497 --> 02:15:20.824
MEETING WITH THE U. S. PRESIDENT
IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT THE WHITE 

02:15:21.034 --> 02:15:26.314
HOUSE AS THE ULTIMATE SIGN OF 
ENDORSEMENT AND SUPPORT FROM THE

02:15:26.516 --> 02:15:30.581
UNITED STATES. 
&gt;&gt;  PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WAS A 

02:15:30.781 --> 02:15:31.997
RELATIVELY NEW PRESIDENT, IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

02:15:31.998 --> 02:15:34.836
&gt;&gt; IS CORRECT . HE WAS ELECTED 
ON APRIL 21 AND HIS GOVERNMENT 

02:15:35.049 --> 02:15:39.100
WAS FORMED AFTER PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS IN JULY. 

02:15:39.101 --> 02:15:43.570
&gt;&gt; WOULD WHITE HOUSE  MEETING 
FOR TRENT TO BOOST HIS 

02:15:43.989 --> 02:15:46.222
LEGITIMACY IN UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD PRIMARILY  BOOST HIS

02:15:46.423 --> 02:15:49.871
LEVERAGED TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN ABOUT THE 

02:15:50.072 --> 02:15:52.461
OCCUPATION OF 7% TERRITORY. 
&gt;&gt; 

02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:58.004
MR. KENT, IS PRESSURING UKRAINE 
TO CONDUCT WHAT I BELIEVE YOU 

02:15:58.768 --> 02:16:03.894
CALLED INVESTIGATIONS A PART OF 
THE POLICY TO PROMOTE THE RULE 

02:16:04.296 --> 02:16:06.642
OF LAW?  
&gt;&gt;  IT IS NOT.

02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:14.851
&gt;&gt; IS IT WITHIN THE NATIONAL 
INTEREST IN THE UNITED STATES? 

02:16:15.065 --> 02:16:20.541
&gt;&gt; IN MY OPINION, IT IS NOT.  
&gt;&gt; ARE POLICIES  IN THE ROLE OF 

02:16:20.755 --> 02:16:25.008
LAW ARE DESIGNED TO HELP 
COUNTRIES WITH CENTRAL EUROPE 

02:16:25.424 --> 02:16:30.492
THAT IS OVERCOMING THE LEGACY OF
COMMUNISM AND IN PARTICULARLY 

02:16:30.908 --> 02:16:35.778
THE OFFICE WAS USED TO SUPPRESS 
CITIZENS AND NOT PROMOTE THE 

02:16:35.978 --> 02:16:40.862
RULE OF LAW. IN HELPING THESE 
COUNTRIES REACH THEIR OWN 

02:16:41.063 --> 02:16:43.063
ASPIRATIONS TO JOIN THE WESTERN 
COMMITTEE OF NATIONS AND LIVE 

02:16:43.098 --> 02:16:47.105
LIVES OF DIGNITY, HELPING THEM 
HAVE THE RULE OF LAW WITH STRONG

02:16:47.275 --> 02:16:49.275
INSTITUTIONS

02:16:51.618 --> 02:16:54.064
IS THE PURPOSE OF OUR POLICY. 
&gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS THE 

02:16:54.265 --> 02:16:56.711
PURPOSE OF OUR  FOREIGN POLICY 
TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN NATIONS

02:17:01.372 --> 02:17:02.789
TO REFRAIN FROM CONDUCTING 
POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS? IS 

02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:05.438
THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.  AS A MATTER OF 

02:17:05.639 --> 02:17:08.690
POLICY AND NOT PROGRAMMING, WE 
OFTEN TIMES RAYS ARE CONSUMED 

02:17:08.891 --> 02:17:11.074
USUALLY IN PRIVATE WITH 
COUNTRIES THAT WE FEEL ARE 

02:17:11.248 --> 02:17:14.094
ENGAGED IN SELECTIVE POLITICAL 
PROSECUTION AND PERSECUTION

02:17:19.852 --> 02:17:21.483
OF THEIR OPPONENTS. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, NOW THAT 

02:17:21.484 --> 02:17:23.304
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT YOU DID
ULTIMATELY UNDERSTAND THAT 

02:17:23.305 --> 02:17:26.758
PRESIDENT TRUMP  WAS WITHHOLDING
SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND A WHITE 

02:17:26.974 --> 02:17:31.226
HOUSE MEETING FROM UKRAINE UNTIL
THEY ANNOUNCED THE 

02:17:31.441 --> 02:17:33.671
INVESTIGATIONS TO BENEFIT THE 
REELECTION CAMPAIGN, LET'S GO 

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:37.734
BACK A LITTLE BIT IN TIME TO 
WHEN YOU FIRST LEARNED ABOUT 

02:17:38.496 --> 02:17:45.455
THIS CONDITIONALITY. ON 
SEPTEMBER 1, A LITTLE MORE THAN 

02:17:45.654 --> 02:17:52.156
A WEEK ON THE TEXT YOU JUST 
READ, THERE WAS ANOTHER TEXT 

02:17:52.558 --> 02:17:55.208
THAT WOULD ALSO BE ON THE SCREEN
IN FRONT OF YOU. IF YOU COULD 

02:17:55.407 --> 02:17:59.464
READ WHAT YOU WROTE TO THEM. 
&gt;&gt; ARE WE NOW SAYING THAT 

02:17:59.665 --> 02:18:02.915
SECURITY ASSISTANCE  IN WHITE 
HOUSE MEETINGS ARE CONDITIONED 

02:18:03.664 --> 02:18:05.664
ON INVESTIGATIONS?  
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR 

02:18:09.216 --> 02:18:15.105
RESPONDED WITH, "CALL ME." WHAT 
HAVE YOU LEARNED THAT PROMPTED 

02:18:15.306 --> 02:18:17.306
YOU TO WRITE THIS TEXT MESSAGE.

02:18:20.594 --> 02:18:24.234
&gt;&gt; I HAD LEARNED  THAT IN WARSAW

02:18:31.354 --> 02:18:36.444
WITH THE MEETING THAT HAD 
HAPPENED WITH PRESIDENT 

02:18:36.642 --> 02:18:41.046
ZELENSKY, AMBASSADOR SOLOMON HAD
HAD MEETINGS THERE  AND HAD 

02:18:41.232 --> 02:18:45.323
DESCRIBED WITH THE ASSISTANT 
THAT

02:18:52.013 --> 02:18:55.283
THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS ALSO
HELD PENDING ANNOUNCEMENTS BY 

02:18:55.537 --> 02:19:01.223
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IN PUBLIC  OF
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. FOR THAT, 

02:19:01.423 --> 02:19:06.505
I HAD ONLY UNDERSTOOD FROM 
AMBASSADOR SOLOMON THAT THE 

02:19:06.707 --> 02:19:10.924
WHITE HOUSE MEETING WAS 
CONDITIONED AND AT THIS TIME 

02:19:11.104 --> 02:19:13.715
AFTER I HEARD OF THIS 
CONVERSATION

02:19:18.228 --> 02:19:20.228
,

02:19:22.336 --> 02:19:24.167
IT STRUCK ME THAT THIS WAS ALSO 
BEING HELD. 

02:19:24.168 --> 02:19:27.620
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY  THAT YOU
WERE ALARMED TO HEAR THIS. WHY 

02:19:27.821 --> 02:19:35.138
WERE YOU ALARMED? 
&gt;&gt;  IT IS ONE THING TO LEVERAGE 

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:45.094
A MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT
IT'S ANOTHER THING I THOUGHT TO 

02:19:45.295 --> 02:19:47.295
LEVERAGE SECURITY ASSISTANCE

02:19:49.763 --> 02:19:55.470
AT WAR DEPENDENT ON BOTH OF THE 
ASSISTANCE IN THE DEMONSTRATION 

02:19:56.212 --> 02:20:00.459
OF SUPPORT. IT WAS MUCH MORE 
ALARMING

02:20:04.999 --> 02:20:07.032
IN THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING WAS 
ONE THING IN SECURITY ASSISTANCE

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:12.305
WAS MUCH MORE ALARMING. 
&gt;&gt;  AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU 

02:20:12.505 --> 02:20:16.990
OUTLINED A DETAILED TIMELINE AND
WE HAVE A WRITTEN COPY HERE AND 

02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:19.753
YOU INCLUDED SOME PHRASES AND 
WORDS IN QUOTATION.

02:20:23.889 --> 02:20:26.316
DID YOU TAKE NOTES OF THIS 
CONVERSATION ON SEPTEMBER 1

02:20:31.409 --> 02:20:32.624
WITH AMBASSADOR SOLOMON? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

02:20:32.625 --> 02:20:35.061
&gt;&gt; DID YOU TAKE NOTES RELATED TO
THE CONVERSATION IF NOT ALL OF 

02:20:35.261 --> 02:20:37.093
THEM  THAT YOU RECITED IN THE 
OPENING STATEMENT? 

02:20:37.094 --> 02:20:40.546
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THEM. 
&gt;&gt;  WHAT ARE THOSE QUOTATIONS 

02:20:40.746 --> 02:20:42.577
THAT YOU INCLUDED IN YOUR 
OPENING STATEMENT REFLECT?  

02:20:42.578 --> 02:20:48.614
&gt;&gt; THEY REFLECT MY NOTES  ON THE
EXACT WORDS THAT I HEARD ON THAT

02:20:48.807 --> 02:20:53.051
CALL. IF I PUT THOSE IN QUOTES,

02:20:56.784 --> 02:20:59.018
THAT MEANT THOSE ARE THE WORDS 
THAT WERE USED ON THAT PHONE 

02:20:59.233 --> 02:21:02.885
CALL OR IN THE CONVERSATION. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU REVIEW THOSE NOTES 

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:06.338
BEFORE YOU DRAFTED YOUR OPENING 
STATEMENT AND CAME TO TESTIFY ? 

02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:09.124
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; IS THAT HOW YOU REMEMBER THAT

02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:15.477
AMBASSADOR SOLOMON WAS ON A 
TRAIN IN JULY? 

02:21:15.478 --> 02:21:20.550
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  YOU ARE AWARE, I PRESUME 

02:21:20.763 --> 02:21:25.020
THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS 
NOT PROVIDED THOSE NOTES TO THE 

02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:26.851
COMMITTEE, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I AM AWARE. 

02:21:26.852 --> 02:21:30.001
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT  OF
REVIEWING THEM? 

02:21:30.002 --> 02:21:32.952
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. I UNDERSTAND THEY 
MAY BE COMING  SOONER OR LATER. 

02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:37.408
&gt;&gt; WE WOULD WELCOME THAT.  YOU 
ALSO TESTIFIED EARLIER 

02:21:37.822 --> 02:21:43.243
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAD DELEGATED SOME MATTERS

02:21:43.415 --> 02:21:49.101
OVERSEEING UKRAINIAN POLICY TO 
AMBASSADOR SOLOMON WHO WAS A BIG

02:21:50.007 --> 02:21:54.583
SUPPORTER EVEN THOUGH UKRAINE IS
NOT IN HIS DOMAIN

02:22:01.793 --> 02:22:04.988
,  IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt;  SEVERAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE 

02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:09.711
MEETING AND IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH THE 

02:22:09.911 --> 02:22:13.764
DELEGATION TO THE INAUGURATION 
OF PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TOLD ME OF

02:22:13.978 --> 02:22:15.978
THAT CONVERSATION 

02:22:18.244 --> 02:22:20.478
AND IT WAS AT THAT MEETING IF I 
UNDERSTAND IT FROM SEVERAL 

02:22:20.679 --> 02:22:22.679
PARTICIPANTS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP

02:22:26.164 --> 02:22:28.534
ASKED THE PARTICIPANTS TO WORK 
WITH MR. GIULIANI ON UKRAINE 

02:22:28.718 --> 02:22:30.628
POLICY. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU COME TO UNDERSTAND 

02:22:30.629 --> 02:22:36.158
THAT  AMBASSADOR SOLOMON HAD 
COMMUNICATION INTO PRESIDENT 

02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:38.347
TRUMP? 
&gt;&gt; I DID.  

02:22:38.348 --> 02:22:44.647
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED  OR RATHER IN 
THAT TEXT MESSAGE AMBASSADOR 

02:22:44.848 --> 02:22:50.136
SOLOMON SAYS TO CALL HIM AFTER 
YOU WROTE THAT. DID YOU IN FACT 

02:22:50.333 --> 02:22:51.752
CALL HIM? 
&gt;&gt; I DID.  

02:22:51.753 --> 02:22:57.036
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?  
&gt;&gt;  HE SAID I WAS WRONG ABOUT 

02:22:57.237 --> 02:23:05.153
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INTENT THAT 
THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO. 

02:23:05.154 --> 02:23:09.423
&gt;&gt; DID HE SAY ANYTHING AFTER 
THAT ? DID HE DESCRIBE TO YOU 

02:23:10.175 --> 02:23:14.711
AND I WILL REFRESH YOUR MEMORY. 
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING IN THE 

02:23:15.470 --> 02:23:18.986
OPENING STATEMENT THAT HE SAID 
THAT EVERYTHING AND I BELIEVE 

02:23:19.177 --> 02:23:23.443
YOU HAVE THAT" WAS ACTUALLY 
CONTINGENT ON THE INITIATION OF 

02:23:24.206 --> 02:23:27.256
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WHAT DID 
HE MEAN BY EVERYTHING? 

02:23:27.257 --> 02:23:35.624
&gt;&gt;  WHAT HE MEANT BY EVERYTHING 
WAS THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN 

02:23:35.826 --> 02:23:39.697
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING. 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE YOU ALSO TESTIFIED 

02:23:39.896 --> 02:23:45.526
THAT HE SAID  HE MADE A MISTAKE 
IN RELAYING A MESSAGE TO THE 

02:23:45.697 --> 02:23:47.400
UKRAINIANS. WHAT WAS THAT 
MISTAKE? 

02:23:47.401 --> 02:23:54.102
&gt;&gt; THE MISTAKE  THAT HE TOLD ME 
WAS EARLIER HE HAD TOLD 

02:23:54.518 --> 02:24:03.043
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  AND MR. 
MERMOCK THAT WHAT WAS 

02:24:03.256 --> 02:24:07.869
NECESSARILY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING WAS THE PURSUIT OF THESE

02:24:08.037 --> 02:24:11.499
INVESTIGATIONS. HE SAID HE 
RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE

02:24:13.814 --> 02:24:15.846
AND NOT JUST THE WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING THAT WAS DEPENDENT ON 

02:24:16.046 --> 02:24:18.046
THE INVESTIGATIONS BUT NOW 
EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE 

02:24:18.199 --> 02:24:22.134
SECURITY ASSISTANT. 
&gt;&gt; NOT JUST A WHITE HOUSE 

02:24:22.348 --> 02:24:23.565
MEETING BUT ALSO  SECURITY 
ASSISTANT? 

02:24:23.566 --> 02:24:26.816
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR .  
&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SAYING  

02:24:27.374 --> 02:24:31.586
REPEATEDLY THAT THERE WAS NO 
QUID PRO QUO, AMBASSADOR SOLOMON

02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:37.369
RELAYED TO YOU THAT THE FACTS OF
THE MATTER WERE THAT THE WHITE 

02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:39.692
HOUSE MEETING AND SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE WERE CONDITIONED ON 

02:24:39.864 --> 02:24:44.485
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS.  THAT IS YOUR 

02:24:44.686 --> 02:24:46.102
UNDERSTANDING? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING.  

02:24:46.103 --> 02:24:48.103
&gt;&gt; YOU REFERENCED  A TELEVISION 
INTERVIEW

02:24:52.204 --> 02:24:55.175
AND A DESIRE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
TO PUT

02:25:02.365 --> 02:25:04.440
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IN A PUBLIC 
BOX WHICH YOU ALSO HAVE". WAS 

02:25:04.621 --> 02:25:06.628
THAT YOUR NOTES? 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS IN MY NOTES.  

02:25:06.629 --> 02:25:08.871
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
TO MEAN TO PUT  PRESIDENT 

02:25:09.065 --> 02:25:11.299
ZELENSKY IN A PUBLIC  BOX? 
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTOOD THAT TO MEAN 

02:25:11.497 --> 02:25:15.902
THAT  PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGH 
AMBASSADOR SOLOMON WAS ASKING 

02:25:16.082 --> 02:25:21.649
FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  TO VERY 
PUBLICLY COMMIT TO THESE 

02:25:22.622 --> 02:25:24.689
INVESTIGATIONS THAT IT WAS NOT 
SUFFICIENT

02:25:34.445 --> 02:25:36.075
.  
&gt;&gt; DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD 

02:25:36.076 --> 02:25:39.115
NEED TO BE PUBLIC AS OPPOSED TO 
A PRIVATE CONFIRMATION?  

02:25:39.116 --> 02:25:40.748
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION
ON THAT. 

02:25:40.749 --> 02:25:43.588
&gt;&gt; DURING THIS  TIMEFRAME IN 
EARLY DECEMBER, DID YOU COME TO 

02:25:44.338 --> 02:25:46.381
UNDERSTAND THAT FROM YOUR 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:49.411
UKRAINIANS THAT UKRAINE

02:25:53.746 --> 02:25:58.016
FELT PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THE 
CONDITIONALITY WITH THE WHITE 

02:25:58.216 --> 02:26:00.216
HOUSE MEETING AND SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE.

02:26:04.104 --> 02:26:08.987
&gt;&gt; HERE IS WHAT I KNOW. I GOT 
SEVERAL QUESTIONS  AND OTHER 

02:26:09.188 --> 02:26:11.225
OFFICIALS GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS 
AS WELL FROM UKRAINIANS ASKING 

02:26:11.421 --> 02:26:17.106
ABOUT THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
AND WHAT I KNOW IS THE SECURITY 

02:26:17.308 --> 02:26:19.955
ASSISTANCE WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO
TO THE UKRAINIANS. THEY HAD 

02:26:20.157 --> 02:26:25.430
BEGUN TO HEAR FROM AMBASSADOR 
SOLOMON THAT THE SECURITY 

02:26:25.645 --> 02:26:28.640
ASSISTANCE WAS NOT GOING TO COME
UNTIL THE INVESTIGATIONS WERE 

02:26:28.814 --> 02:26:36.405
PURSUED. WHAT I HEARD FROM THE 
DEFENSE MINISTER AND WHAT 

02:26:36.805 --> 02:26:38.438
SENATOR JOHNSON AND SENATOR 
MURPHY HEARD IN THEIR 

02:26:38.439 --> 02:26:43.111
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  WAS THE CLEAR CONCERN 

02:26:43.313 --> 02:26:48.116
IN URGING CONCERN THAT 
UKRAINIANS HAD ABOUT SECURITY 

02:26:48.289 --> 02:26:51.031
ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO DESCRIBE THE 

02:26:51.234 --> 02:26:53.385
CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAD WITH  
AMBASSADOR SOLOMON

02:26:59.552 --> 02:27:05.374
AND IN THAT CONVERSATION, YOU 
DESCRIBED HOW HE USED THE TERM

02:27:09.106 --> 02:27:12.285
STALEMATE. WHAT DID YOU CONSIDER
THAT TO BE?

02:27:20.208 --> 02:27:22.208
&gt;&gt; 

02:27:29.018 --> 02:27:31.853
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID THAT IF
WE DID NOT CLEAR THIS  UP IN 

02:27:32.054 --> 02:27:35.505
PUBLIC, WE WOULD BE AT A 
STALEMATE. HE BEGAN THAT BY 

02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:41.466
REPEATING THIS IS NOT A QUID PRO
QUO BUT IF HE DID NOT CLEAR 

02:27:41.646 --> 02:27:44.804
THINGS UP IN PUBLIC, WE WOULD BE
OUT OF STALEMATE AND WHAT I 

02:27:44.987 --> 02:27:49.479
UNDERSTOOD IN THAT MEETING WAS

02:27:54.001 --> 02:27:55.016
SECURITY ASSISTANCE WOULD NOT 
COME. 

02:27:55.017 --> 02:28:00.288
&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH HE SAID THERE 
WERE  NO QUID PRO QUO, HE THEN 

02:28:00.489 --> 02:28:02.738
WENT ON TO SAY BUT THE SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE WILL NOT COME UNLESS 

02:28:02.938 --> 02:28:05.171
THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE.  
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? 

02:28:05.927 --> 02:28:07.927
&gt;&gt; 

02:28:09.842 --> 02:28:11.878
IN MY UNDERSTANDING, THAT WAS 
WHAT WAS MET BY STALEMATE. 

02:28:11.879 --> 02:28:14.146
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSION YOU
HAD ABOUT  PRESIDENT TRUMP BEING

02:28:14.871 --> 02:28:18.714
A BUSINESSMAN WHO WANTED TO HAVE
PEOPLE PAY UP BEFORE SIGNING THE

02:28:18.885 --> 02:28:22.952
CHECK. WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND 
THAT TO MEAN?

02:28:27.513 --> 02:28:34.614
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS AN EXPLANATION  THAT
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND GAVE ME 

02:28:34.817 --> 02:28:38.425
ABOUT HIS UNDERSTANDING  OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S THOUGHT 

02:28:38.604 --> 02:28:40.604
PROCESS.

02:28:45.587 --> 02:28:47.225
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND IS A 
BUSINESSMAN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:28:47.226 --> 02:28:51.272
IS A BUSINESSMAN AND HE WAS  
EXPLAINING TO ME THE 

02:28:51.474 --> 02:28:56.046
RELATIONSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING 
THAT A BUSINESSMAN WOULD HAVE 

02:28:56.221 --> 02:29:01.223
WHEN HE IS ABOUT TO SIGN A CHECK
AND BY THAT, HE CLEARLY MEANT 

02:29:01.438 --> 02:29:03.872
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
THINKING ABOUT OR HAD IN FRONT 

02:29:04.636 --> 02:29:08.676
OF HIM THE POSSIBILITY OF 
PROVIDING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO

02:29:08.855 --> 02:29:13.828
UKRAINE. IT WAS SIMILAR TO 
WRITING A CHECK TO SOMEONE YOU 

02:29:14.588 --> 02:29:16.588
ARE ABOUT TO SEND.

04:10:30.274 --> 04:10:35.670
&gt;&gt; IT WAS HELD UP -- NOT JUST 
THE MEETING, ALSO THE SECURITY 

04:10:35.917 --> 04:10:37.917
ASSISTANCE. THAT IS EVERYTHING.

04:10:42.458 --> 04:10:44.701
THOSE TWO DISCUSSIONS -- 
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND. AGAIN, JUST TO 

04:10:44.946 --> 04:10:47.010
RECAP, YOU HAD THREE MEETINGS 
WITH PRESENT ZELENSKY, NO 

04:10:47.264 --> 04:10:49.264
LINKAGE CAME UP. 

04:10:52.067 --> 04:10:54.396
AMBASSADOR ZELENSKY DID ANNOUNCE
HE WAS GOING TO DO THE 

04:10:54.638 --> 04:10:56.638
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BIDENS OR
-- 

04:11:09.455 --> 04:11:13.223
&gt;&gt; TO POINT NUMBER 2. THE SECOND
SENTENCE.

04:11:18.081 --> 04:11:20.081
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR RECALLS THAT 
MR. MORRISON TOLD AMBASSADOR 

04:11:20.219 --> 04:11:23.198
TAYLOR THAT I TOLD MR. MORRISON 
THAT I COULD MAKE THE MESSAGE ON

04:11:23.439 --> 04:11:25.439
SEPTEMBER 21, 2019 AND 
ACCORDANCE WITH VICE PRESIDENT

04:11:28.864 --> 04:11:31.974
MIKE PENCE MEETING TO WARSAW. 
LET ME READ IT ONE MORE TIME. 

04:11:32.220 --> 04:11:34.829
BASSITT OR TAYLOR RECALLS THAT 
MR. MORRISON TOLD -- THAT I 

04:11:35.067 --> 04:11:37.368
CONVEYED THE MESSAGE ON 
SEPTEMBER 1 IN CONNECTION WITH 

04:11:37.627 --> 04:11:39.627
VICE PRESIDENT

04:11:45.742 --> 04:11:47.960
MIKE PENCE VISIT TO WARSAW AND 
THE MEETING WITH PRESENT 

04:11:48.223 --> 04:11:50.424
ZELENSKY. WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE 
HAVING FOUR CONVERSATIONS IN ONE

04:11:50.664 --> 04:11:53.368
SENTENCE AND YOU TOLD ME THIS IS
WHERE YOU GOT THE CLEAR 

04:11:53.621 --> 04:11:55.621
UNDERSTANDING.  EVEN THOUGH YOU 
HAVE THREE OPPORTUNITIES WITH 

04:11:55.971 --> 04:11:58.702
PRESENT ZELENSKY TO HELP  HIM 
TELL YOU, WE WILL DO THE 

04:11:58.968 --> 04:12:03.384
INVESTIGATIONS TO GET THE EIGHT,
YOU NEVER MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 

04:12:03.632 --> 04:12:06.377
OR NEVER TWEETS ABOUT IT. NEVER 
DOES THE CNN REVIEW. AMBASSADOR 

04:12:06.624 --> 04:12:09.654
YOU WANT ON THE CALL, WERE YOU? 
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE CALL? 

04:12:09.908 --> 04:12:12.477
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU NEVER SPOKE WITH CHIEF OF

04:12:12.732 --> 04:12:14.808
STAFF MICK MULVANEY? 
&gt;&gt; YOU NEVER MET THE PRESIDENT? 

04:12:15.069 --> 04:12:20.269
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT. 
&gt;&gt; PRESENT ZELENSKY NEVER MADE 

04:12:20.535 --> 04:12:26.266
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS WHAT I
CAN'T BELIEVE. AND YOU ARE THE 

04:12:26.645 --> 04:12:29.454
STAR WITNESS. YOU ARE THE FIRST 
WITNESS. YOU ARE THE GUY, BASED 

04:12:29.759 --> 04:12:31.759
ON THIS. BASED -- I HAVE SEEN

04:12:37.301 --> 04:12:39.485
CHURCH PRAYER CHAINS THAT ARE 
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IN THIS. 

04:12:39.732 --> 04:12:41.953
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR RECALLS MR. 
MORRISON TOLD -- I HEREBY SWEAR 

04:12:42.204 --> 04:12:44.552
AND AFFIRM -- MR. MORRISON TOLD 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT I 

04:12:44.806 --> 04:12:48.107
CONVEYED THE MESSAGE ON 
SEPTEMBER 21 -- THIS HAPPENED BY

04:12:48.611 --> 04:12:52.489
THE WAY. THIS ALL HAPPENS BY THE
WAY IN WARSAW. VICE PRESIDENT 

04:12:52.766 --> 04:12:54.766
PENCE MEETS WITH

04:12:59.330 --> 04:13:01.594
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. AND GUESS 
WHAT, THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY

04:13:01.834 --> 04:13:03.842
LINKAGE EITHER. 
&gt;&gt; THE TIME OF THE GENTLEMAN HAS

04:13:04.103 --> 04:13:06.103
EXPIRED.  
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY RESPONSE

04:13:09.879 --> 04:13:13.033
, I HAVE TWO RESPONSES. THANK 
YOU MR. JORDAN. I'M GLAD TO TAKE

04:13:13.304 --> 04:13:16.047
THIS QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST SAY,
THAT I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A 

04:13:16.300 --> 04:13:18.793
STAR WITNESS FOR ANYTHING. I 
DON'T. I AM RESPONDING TO YOUR 

04:13:19.034 --> 04:13:24.265
QUESTIONS. I THINK I WAS CLEAR, 
I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE ONE SIDE OR

04:13:24.515 --> 04:13:27.552
THE OTHER OR TO IMPLICATE ANY 
OUTCOME. LET ME RESTATE THAT. 

04:13:27.803 --> 04:13:30.780
THE SECOND THING IS, MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ONLY 

04:13:31.554 --> 04:13:38.751
COMING FROM PEOPLE I TALKED TO. 
WE GOT THAT. AND I THINK THIS 

04:13:39.000 --> 04:13:45.330
CLARIFICATION FROM AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND  WAS BECAUSE HE SAID HE

04:13:45.575 --> 04:13:50.289
DIDN'T REMEMBER THIS. IN HIS 
FIRST DEPOSITION. HE WANTED TO 

04:13:50.542 --> 04:13:55.271
KIND OF CLARIFY. BUT I THINK MR.
JORDAN, THE WAY I READ THIS, HE 

04:13:55.518 --> 04:13:59.577
REMEMBERS IT THE SAME WAY I DO. 
&gt;&gt; AND IT IS REAL CLEAR? 

04:13:59.578 --> 04:14:02.999
&gt;&gt; IT IS VERY CLEAR. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU AMBASSADOR TAYLOR.

04:14:07.769 --> 04:14:10.349
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
TESTIMONY TODAY. ONE OF THE 

04:14:10.595 --> 04:14:13.021
THINGS I FIND STARTLING ABOUT 
THESE PROCEEDINGS IS THAT FACED 

04:14:13.282 --> 04:14:16.469
WITH VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS, 
RESIDENTIAL MISCONDUCT, MY 

04:14:16.720 --> 04:14:19.873
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE AISLE DON'T ENGAGE OR DEFEND

04:14:20.120 --> 04:14:25.395
THAT CONDUCT, RATHER THEY SPEND 
THEORIES ABOUT LACK LEDGERS AND 

04:14:25.644 --> 04:14:27.420
STEELE DOSSIER'S AND STARTLING 
REVELATIONS THAT UKRAINIANS 

04:14:27.421 --> 04:14:29.421
MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET A 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SUGGESTED

04:14:29.508 --> 04:14:35.692
THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD LET THE 
RUSSIANS KEEP CRIMEA. WE GET THE

04:14:35.951 --> 04:14:41.490
ATTACKS. IT EPITOMIZED BY MR. 
NUNEZ AND HIS OPENING STATEMENT 

04:14:41.745 --> 04:14:45.596
WHEN HE ATTACKED DEMOCRATS, 
ATTACKED THE MEDIA AND MOST 

04:14:45.857 --> 04:14:47.857
DISGUSTINGLY ATTACKED

04:14:52.300 --> 04:14:54.778
THE EXTRAORDINARY MEN OF THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT AND FBI. WHEN A

04:14:55.024 --> 04:14:57.880
DEFENSE DOESN'T MERGE IT LOOKS A
LITTLE LIKE THIS. UKRAINE IS A 

04:14:58.139 --> 04:15:00.210
CORRUPT COUNTRY AND THE 
PRESIDENT WAS JUST ACTING

04:15:07.067 --> 04:15:09.528
IN A LONG LINE, LONG TRADITION 
OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS 

04:15:09.763 --> 04:15:11.919
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. MR. KENT,
YOU WORKED ON ANTICORRUPTION AND

04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:15.085
RULE OF LAW FOR MUCH OF YOUR 27 
YEAR CAREER. IS THAT CORRECT? 

04:15:15.344 --> 04:15:17.505
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SPECIALIZED IN 
ANTICORRUPTION RULE OF LAW 

04:15:17.752 --> 04:15:19.969
ISSUES SINCE 2012. 
&gt;&gt; LIKE MOST OF US APPEAR, I 

04:15:20.214 --> 04:15:22.916
DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT 
A REAL ANTICORRUPTION EFFORT -- 

04:15:23.163 --> 04:15:28.428
WE MUST ENGAGE ALL OVER THE 
WORLD, ALL THE TIME, WHAT IT 

04:15:28.690 --> 04:15:31.447
LOOKS LIKE. LET ME ASK YOU TO 
TAKE A MINUTE AND CHARACTERIZE 

04:15:31.739 --> 04:15:35.281
FOR US WHAT A REAL INITIATIVE, 
WHAT A REAL PROGRAM OF 

04:15:35.519 --> 04:15:39.405
ANTICORRUPTION MIGHT LOOK LIKE. 
&gt;&gt; IF WE ARE DOING A SYSTEMIC 

04:15:39.646 --> 04:15:41.646
PROGRAM, YOU NEED TO INSTITUTE 
WITH

04:15:45.534 --> 04:15:49.050
INTEGRITY AND IT STARTS WITH 
INVESTIGATORS, GOES TO 

04:15:49.299 --> 04:15:51.299
PROSECUTORS AND GOES TO COURTS. 
EVENTUALLY GOES TO THE 

04:15:51.479 --> 04:15:53.270
CORRECTION SYSTEM. 
&gt;&gt; LIKE UKRAINE, WE GENERALLY 

04:15:53.271 --> 04:15:56.217
START WITH LAW-ENFORCEMENT. THAT
IS WHAT WE DID IN 2014, 15 WITH 

04:15:56.470 --> 04:15:58.470
NEW PATROL POLICE.

04:16:00.518 --> 04:16:02.543
THERE IS ALSO OFTEN TIMES NEEDED
A SPECIALIZED ANTICORRUPTION 

04:16:02.787 --> 04:16:04.787
AGENCY. IN UKRAINE THAT WAS 
CALLED THE NATIONAL 

04:16:05.301 --> 04:16:08.326
ANTICORRUPTION BUREAU. THERE WAS
A DIFFERENT BODY THAT REVIEWED 

04:16:08.585 --> 04:16:10.585
ASSET DECLARATIONS FOR UNUSUAL 
WEALTH CALLED NATIONAL 

04:16:10.708 --> 04:16:12.708
ANTICORRUPTION PREVENTION. AND A

04:16:21.376 --> 04:16:23.376
EVENTUALLY WE GOT TO HELPING 
THEM ESTABLISH A SPECIAL 

04:16:23.596 --> 04:16:25.574
ANTICORRUPTION PROSECUTOR. AND 
EVENTUALLY A HIGH COURT ON 

04:16:25.575 --> 04:16:27.575
ANTICORRUPTION. THAT WAS TO TRY 
TO CREATE INVESTIGATORS, 

04:16:27.578 --> 04:16:29.653
PROSECUTORS AND COURTS WITH 
INTEGRITY THAT COULDN'T BE 

04:16:29.891 --> 04:16:32.004
BOUGHT AND WOULD BE FOCUSED ON 
HIGH-LEVEL CORRUPTION. 

04:16:32.005 --> 04:16:34.732
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'M HEARING MR. KENT IS 
A VERY COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT. LET

04:16:34.985 --> 04:16:36.985
ME READ YOU

04:16:47.159 --> 04:16:49.419
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OWN WORDS TO 
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT IN THE 

04:16:49.677 --> 04:16:52.558
JULY 25 PHONE CALL. I QUOTE, 
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 

04:16:52.810 --> 04:16:55.703
BIDEN'S SON. THAT BIDEN STOP THE
PROSECUTION AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 

04:16:55.949 --> 04:16:58.869
WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THAT. 
WHATEVER YOU CAN DO WITH THE 

04:16:59.138 --> 04:17:01.469
ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE GREAT.
AND WENT AROUND BREAKING HE 

04:17:01.726 --> 04:17:04.462
STOPPED THE PROSECUTION. IF YOU 
CAN LOOK INTO IT, IT SOUNDS 

04:17:04.707 --> 04:17:07.579
HORRIBLE TO ME. WHEN YOU HEAR 
THOSE WORDS, DO YOU HEAR THE 

04:17:07.829 --> 04:17:09.625
PRESIDENT PARTICIPATING IN 
REQUESTING OF THOUGHTFUL AND 

04:17:09.626 --> 04:17:10.641
WELL CALIBRATED ANTICORRUPTION 
PROGRAMS? 

04:17:10.642 --> 04:17:13.166
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT. 
&gt;&gt; AND MR. KENT, AND MR. TAYLOR,

04:17:13.414 --> 04:17:15.920
THE DEFENDERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S
BEHAVIOR HAVE MADE A BIG DEAL 

04:17:16.171 --> 04:17:18.622
OUT OF THE FACT THAT VICE 
PRESIDENT BIDEN ENCOURAGED THE 

04:17:18.866 --> 04:17:21.067
UKRAINIANS TO REMOVE A CORRUPT 
FORM UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR IN 

04:17:21.315 --> 04:17:23.315
2016.

04:17:25.361 --> 04:17:28.483
AND IN FACT, SENATOR RAND PAUL 
ON SUNDAY SAID AND I QUOTE HIM, 

04:17:28.722 --> 04:17:30.722
THEY ARE IMPEACHING THE 
PRESIDENT FOR EXACTLY THE SAME 

04:17:30.938 --> 04:17:34.456
THING THAT JOE BIDEN DID. IS 
THAT CORRECT? IS WHAT THE 

04:17:35.031 --> 04:17:40.269
PRESIDENT DID IN HIS PHONE CALL,
AND WHAT JOE BIDEN DID IN TERMS 

04:17:40.516 --> 04:17:46.112
-- ARE THOSE THESE SAME THINGS 
AND IF NOT, HOW ARE THEY 

04:17:46.356 --> 04:17:48.356
DIFFERENT? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE THE 

04:17:48.695 --> 04:17:52.457
SAME THINGS. WHAT FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT BIDEN REQUESTED OF THE

04:17:55.126 --> 04:17:57.391
FORMER PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE WAS 
THE REMOVAL OF A CORRUPT 

04:17:57.636 --> 04:17:59.636
PROSECUTOR GENERAL, VICTOR 
SHOKAN WHO HAD UNDERMINED

04:18:03.564 --> 04:18:06.449
A PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE THAT WE 
HAVE SPENT U.S. TAXPAYER DOLLARS

04:18:07.317 --> 04:18:09.458
TO BUILD AN INDEPENDENT 
INVESTIGATOR UNIT TO GO AFTER 

04:18:09.708 --> 04:18:13.422
CORRUPT EXECUTORS. THERE WAS A 
CASE CALLED THE DIAMOND 

04:18:13.675 --> 04:18:15.675
PROSECUTOR CASE IN WHICH THEY 
DESTROYED THE ENTIRE

04:18:29.580 --> 04:18:32.258
ECOSYSTEM WE WERE TRYING TO 
CREATE. THE INVESTIGATORS, THE 

04:18:32.531 --> 04:18:34.835
JUDGES WHO ISSUED THE WARRANTS. 
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAD 

04:18:35.086 --> 04:18:37.333
WANTS TO DO THE WIRETAPPING, 
EVERYBODY TO PROTECT HIS FORMER 

04:18:37.598 --> 04:18:40.263
DRIVER WHO HE HAD MADE A 
PROSECUTOR. THAT IS WHAT JOE 

04:18:40.545 --> 04:18:42.597
BIDEN WAS ASKING TO REMOVE THE 
CORRUPT PROSECUTOR. 

04:18:42.598 --> 04:18:45.084
&gt;&gt; JOE BIDEN WAS PARTICIPATING 
IN OPEN EFFORT TO ESTABLISH AND 

04:18:45.364 --> 04:18:50.567
ADDRESS CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. BUT MR. KENT

04:18:50.834 --> 04:18:53.415
AS YOU LOOK AT THIS MESS, RUDY 
GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP, IN 

04:18:53.669 --> 04:18:55.669
YOUR OPINION WAS THIS A 
COMPREHENSIVE AND WHOLE 

04:18:55.768 --> 04:18:57.576
GOVERNMENT EFFORT TO END 
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE? 

04:18:57.577 --> 04:18:59.458
&gt;&gt; REFERRING TO THE REQUEST IN 
JULY? 

04:18:59.459 --> 04:19:04.501
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD NOT SAY SO. 

04:19:04.502 --> 04:19:07.296
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP
WAS TRYING TO END CORRUPTION, HE

04:19:07.541 --> 04:19:10.145
WAS TRYING TO AIM CORRUPTION IN 
UKRAINE AT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.

04:19:10.573 --> 04:19:13.463
AND AT THE 2020 ELECTION. I 
YIELD THAT THE BALANCE OF MY 

04:19:13.726 --> 04:19:15.726
TIME. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CONAWAY IS RECOGNIZED FOR

04:19:16.103 --> 04:19:19.388
FIVE MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD MY TIME TO THE 

04:19:19.642 --> 04:19:21.642
GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS. 
&gt;&gt;

04:19:24.424 --> 04:19:27.170
I THINK THE GENTLEMAN AND I 
THINK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. 

04:19:27.416 --> 04:19:29.992
IT IS OBVIOUS FROM YOUR 
TESTIMONY THAT YOU CARE A GREAT 

04:19:30.234 --> 04:19:32.971
DEAL ABOUT U.S.-UKRAINE 
RELATIONS. IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU 

04:19:33.234 --> 04:19:35.234
ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU

04:19:35.334 --> 04:19:41.077
RELATED  ONE OF HIS FIRST ACTS 
WAS TO REMOVE IMMUNITY FROM 

04:19:41.339 --> 04:19:44.496
DEPUTIES THAT HAD LONG BEEN A 
SOURCE OF CORRUPTION. YOU HAD A 

04:19:44.739 --> 04:19:47.474
NUMBER OF PERSONAL DEALINGS WITH
HIM. HAS HE GIVEN YOU REASON TO 

04:19:47.724 --> 04:19:49.017
QUESTION HIS HONESTY OR 
INTEGRITY? 

04:19:49.018 --> 04:19:51.018
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; YOUR PRIOR DEPOSITION, I 

04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:55.186
ASKED YOU, AND I WILL READ IT 
THAT DIRECTLY. IF NO ONE IN THE 

04:19:55.440 --> 04:19:58.474
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF
THE HOLD

04:20:01.925 --> 04:20:06.027
, AS A MATTER OF LAW AND MATTER 
OF FACT THERE CAN BE NO QUID PRO

04:20:06.285 --> 04:20:08.285
QUO

04:20:17.873 --> 04:20:20.421
FOR MILITARY AID. AND TO YOUR 
KNOWLEDGE NO ONE IN THE 

04:20:20.665 --> 04:20:22.911
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT WAS AWARE 
OF THE WHOLE. YOUR ANSWER WAS, 

04:20:23.175 --> 04:20:25.184
THAT IS CORRECT. IS THAT STILL 
YOUR TESTIMONY? 

04:20:25.185 --> 04:20:29.907
&gt;&gt; MR. RADCLIFFE, AT SOME POINT,
IN SEPTEMBER -- 

04:20:29.908 --> 04:20:32.896
&gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT ON JULY 25.
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, YES THAT IS 

04:20:33.136 --> 04:20:36.268
CORRECT. THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT.
&gt;&gt; AS IT TURNS OUT PRESIDENT 

04:20:36.531 --> 04:20:38.665
ZELENSKY AGREED WITH YOU. ON 
OCTOBER 10, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

04:20:38.915 --> 04:20:41.490
HOLDER  PRESS MARATHON WITH OVER
300 REPORTERS. WHERE HE SAID 

04:20:41.742 --> 04:20:43.777
REPEATEDLY, AND CONSISTENTLY, 
OVER HOURS AND HOURS THAT HE 

04:20:44.039 --> 04:20:46.039
WOULD NOT AWARE OF A MILITARY 
HOLD

04:20:50.206 --> 04:20:52.725
DURING THE JULY 25 CALL. IN 
FACT, IN HIS OFFICIAL PRESS 

04:20:52.982 --> 04:20:54.982
RELEASE, FROM THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT, AVAILABLE ON HIS 

04:20:55.068 --> 04:20:57.364
WEBSITE THAT I WILL BE 
INTRODUCING INTO THE RECORD HE 

04:20:57.618 --> 04:21:01.691
SAID, OUR PHONE CONVERSATION 
BEARS NO RELATIONS TO ARMS. THEY

04:21:01.964 --> 04:21:04.108
BLOCK THE PROVISION OF MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE PRIOR TO OUR 

04:21:04.363 --> 04:21:06.363
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BUT THE 
ISSUE HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED 

04:21:06.605 --> 04:21:09.894
DURING OUR CONVERSATION. I MEAN,
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. SO NOW, IN 

04:21:10.146 --> 04:21:14.581
ADDITION TO CONFIRMING THAT 
BECAUSE HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE, 

04:21:15.046 --> 04:21:17.351
THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO 
INVOLVING MILITARY AID DURING 

04:21:17.922 --> 04:21:21.319
THAT CALL, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
WENT ON TO CONFIRM A NUMBER OF 

04:21:21.578 --> 04:21:23.578
THINGS. THAT THERE WAS NO 
PRESSURE 

04:21:26.768 --> 04:21:28.983
. THERE WERE NO CONDITIONS. 
THERE WERE NO THREATS. ON 

04:21:29.225 --> 04:21:31.501
MILITARY AID. THERE WERE NO 
CONDITIONS OR PRESSURE TO 

04:21:31.761 --> 04:21:35.369
INVESTIGATE BURISMA. OR THE 2016
ELECTION. THERE WAS NO 

04:21:35.618 --> 04:21:37.969
BLACKMAIL. THERE WAS NO 
CORRUPTION OF ANY  TIME. DURING 

04:21:38.503 --> 04:21:41.306
THE JULY 25 CALL. AGAIN FROM HIS
A PITCH OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE.

04:21:53.487 --> 04:21:56.038
THERE WAS NO BLACKMAIL BECAUSE 
IT WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF 

04:21:56.304 --> 04:21:58.608
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE WERE

04:21:58.852 --> 04:22:01.122
NO CONDITIONS ON THE 
INVESTIGATION. EITHER BECAUSE OF

04:22:01.380 --> 04:22:04.339
ARMS OR BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION
AROUND BURISMA COMPANY.  HE TOLD

04:22:04.598 --> 04:22:07.190
REUTERS, THERE WAS NO BLACKMAIL.
HE TOLD THE "LA TIMES", THERE 

04:22:07.446 --> 04:22:10.051
WAS NO PRESSURE OR BLACKMAIL 
FROM THE UNITED STATES. HE TOLD 

04:22:10.330 --> 04:22:12.975
JAPAN, I WAS NEVER PRESSURED AND
THERE WAS NO CONDITIONS IMPOSED.

04:22:13.233 --> 04:22:17.337
HE TOLD ABC NEWS, THE BBC, I'M 
AGAINST CORRUPTION. THIS IS NOT 

04:22:17.585 --> 04:22:19.590
CORRUPTION. IT WAS JUST A CALL. 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT

04:22:29.113 --> 04:22:31.467
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD PRESS AND 
REPEATEDLY, CONSISTENTLY, OVER 

04:22:31.723 --> 04:22:34.055
AND OVER AGAIN, INTERVIEW AFTER 
INTERVIEW THAT HE HAD NO 

04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:36.309
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MILITARY AID 
BEING WITHHELD, "CALL,

04:22:40.124 --> 04:22:42.210
NO PRESSURE, NO DEMANDS, NO 
THREATS, NO BLACKMAIL, NOTHING 

04:22:42.457 --> 04:22:44.983
CORRUPT. UNLIKE THE FIRST 45 
MINUTES THAT WE HEARD FROM THE 

04:22:45.226 --> 04:22:47.200
DEMOCRATS TODAY, THAT IS NOT 
SECONDHAND INFORMATION, NOT 

04:22:47.201 --> 04:22:49.201
HEARSAY, NOT WHAT SOMEONE 
OVERHEARD AMBASSADOR 2029 SAY. 

04:22:49.249 --> 04:22:51.923
THAT WAS DIRECT TESTIMONY. DO 
YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE 

04:22:52.182 --> 04:22:54.966
WAS LYING TO THE WORLD PRESS 
WHEN HE SAID THOSE THINGS? 

04:22:54.967 --> 04:22:56.967
&gt;&gt;

04:23:00.049 --> 04:23:01.647
MR. RADCLIFFE, IF I COULD 
RESPOND. 

04:23:01.648 --> 04:23:05.279
&gt;&gt; MY TIME IS SHORT, YES OR NO. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT 

04:23:05.531 --> 04:23:07.346
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS 
-- 

04:23:07.347 --> 04:23:12.469
&gt;&gt; VERY GOOD. IN THIS PEACH 
MID-HEARING TODAY WHEN WE 

04:23:12.939 --> 04:23:16.935
IMPEACH PRESIDENTS FOR TREASON, 
BRIBERY OR OTHER HIGH CRIMES, 

04:23:17.188 --> 04:23:22.032
WHERE IS THE IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE
IN THAT CALL? ARE EITHER OF YOU 

04:23:22.282 --> 04:23:24.326
HERE TO ASSERT THERE WAS 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE IN THAT 

04:23:24.584 --> 04:23:29.752
CALL? SHOUT IT OUT. ANYONE? 
&gt;&gt; MR. RADCLIFFE, CAN I RESPOND 

04:23:30.018 --> 04:23:32.793
AND REITERATE THAT -- 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT. 

04:23:32.794 --> 04:23:35.951
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT --

04:23:40.828 --> 04:23:43.690
I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE ONE SIDE OR
THE OTHER. 

04:23:43.691 --> 04:23:45.850
&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU --

04:23:49.503 --> 04:23:51.600
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE 
QUESTION? 

04:23:51.601 --> 04:23:57.486
&gt;&gt; I WITHDREW THE QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; WE WILL SUSPEND THE CLOCK. 

04:23:57.728 --> 04:24:00.108
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

04:24:00.359 --> 04:24:04.335
&gt;&gt; MR. RADCLIFFE, I WOULD LIKE 
TO SAY THAT I'M NOT HERE TO DO 

04:24:04.585 --> 04:24:08.557
ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH 
DECIDING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. THAT

04:24:08.844 --> 04:24:12.298
IS NOT WHAT EITHER OF US ARE 
HERE TO DO. THAT IS YOUR JOB. 

04:24:12.556 --> 04:24:15.972
&gt;&gt; RESTORE THE TIME OF THE CLOCK
TO ONE MINUTE. 

04:24:15.973 --> 04:24:17.811
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH 22 
SECONDS. 

04:24:17.812 --> 04:24:19.812
&gt;&gt; FINE. MR. AMBASSADOR

04:24:22.545 --> 04:24:25.132
, I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE UP 

04:24:25.378 --> 04:24:27.378
THEIR MIND TO IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT.

04:24:32.861 --> 04:24:35.762
THE QUESTION WE JUST LEARNED IS 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE PREPARED

04:24:36.000 --> 04:24:38.254
TO IMPEACH TWO. TO BE CLEAR, IF 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS IMPEACH 

04:24:38.508 --> 04:24:41.085
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR QUID PRO QUO
INVOLVING MILITARY AID THEY HAVE

04:24:41.336 --> 04:24:44.425
TO CALL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY A 
LIAR. THEY IMPEACH HIM FOR 

04:24:44.669 --> 04:24:46.708
ABUSING POWER, DEPRESSION OR 
MAKING THREATS OR DEMAND THEY 

04:24:46.971 --> 04:24:51.460
HAVE TO CALL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
A LIAR TO DO IT. IF THEY IMPEACH

04:24:51.705 --> 04:24:54.138
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR BLACKMAIL OR
EXTORTION OR MAKING THREATS OR 

04:24:54.393 --> 04:24:56.879
DEMANDS, THEY HAVE TO CALL 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  -- TRUMP A 

04:24:57.118 --> 04:25:02.700
LIAR TO DO IT. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE CHAIR ORGANIZES --. 

04:25:02.701 --> 04:25:04.701
&gt;&gt;

04:25:09.657 --> 04:25:11.662
I YIELD MY MINUTES TO MY STEAMED
CHAIRMAN. 

04:25:11.663 --> 04:25:14.379
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HAD THE 

04:25:14.635 --> 04:25:16.935
CHANCE TO READ THE TRANSCRIPTS 
RELEASED, ARE YOU WHERE OTHER 

04:25:17.205 --> 04:25:19.503
WITNESSES HAVE TESTIFIED THAT 
UKRAINE IN FACT FOUND OUT THE 

04:25:19.889 --> 04:25:21.889
AID WAS BEING WITHHELD

04:25:25.204 --> 04:25:26.499
BEFORE IT BECAME PUBLIC 
KNOWLEDGE? 

04:25:26.500 --> 04:25:29.403
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE READ 
THAT. I THINK THERE ARE SOME 

04:25:29.649 --> 04:25:31.641
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN THEY MAY 
HAVE HURT. 

04:25:31.642 --> 04:25:34.272
&gt;&gt; ULTIMATELY THEY DID FIND OUT 
WHEN THE POLITICAL STORY CAME 

04:25:34.529 --> 04:25:38.566
OUT. OTHERS HAVE SAID, EVEN 
SOONER THAT THEY DID FIND OUT.

04:25:43.407 --> 04:25:44.746
RIGHT, AMBASSADOR? 
&gt;&gt; THEY DID. 

04:25:44.747 --> 04:25:47.631
&gt;&gt; AT THE TIME THEY FOUND OUT, 
THEY KNEW WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:25:47.904 --> 04:25:49.904
WANTED FROM THEM. THAT THEY 
WANTED THE INVESTIGATIONS. 

04:25:49.923 --> 04:25:51.923
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR SONDLAND,  

04:25:52.127 --> 04:25:55.640
INFORMED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S 
STAFF THAT 

04:26:00.514 --> 04:26:04.329
WHAT WAS REQUIRED. YES. 
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THE 

04:26:04.594 --> 04:26:09.447
HOLD. YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GIVE 
THEM A REASON FOR THE WHOLE. NO 

04:26:09.695 --> 04:26:13.305
ONE IS ABLE TO GIVE THEM A 
REASON FOR THE WHOLE. THEY KNOW 

04:26:13.562 --> 04:26:15.757
THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS. THEN THEY ARE 

04:26:15.995 --> 04:26:17.995
TOLD BY WARSAW BY INVESTOR

04:26:25.126 --> 04:26:27.566
SONDLAND, ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE 
NOT GETTING THE AID UNLESS YOU 

04:26:27.822 --> 04:26:29.314
DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS. IS THAT
CORRECT? 

04:26:29.315 --> 04:26:32.388
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED, HOW CAN 

04:26:32.638 --> 04:26:35.018
THERE BE CONDITIONING AT THE 
UKRAINIAN DIDN'T KNOW  BUT 

04:26:35.270 --> 04:26:36.946
UKRAINIANS WENT TOLD BY 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND. 

04:26:36.947 --> 04:26:40.779
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW  
IS NEAR AS I CAN TELL, THE 

04:26:41.587 --> 04:26:44.454
UKRAINIANS DID NOT KNOW ABOUT 
THE HOLD ON THE PHONE CALL. ON 

04:26:44.708 --> 04:26:47.740
JULY 25, THAT'S TRUE. BUT THEY 
WERE TOLD, AS HE SAID MR. 

04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:50.669
CHAIRMAN ON 1 SEPTEMBER. 
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, THEY MAY NOT HAVE 

04:26:50.927 --> 04:26:53.684
KNOWN DURING THE TIME OF THE 
CALL, THEY WOULD FIND OUT. AND 

04:26:53.938 --> 04:26:57.085
WHEN THEY DID FIND OUT, THEY 
WOULD KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

04:26:57.341 --> 04:26:58.344
WANTED. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 

04:26:58.345 --> 04:27:01.868
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT, I WOULD LIKE TO 
REFER YOU TO THE DISCUSSION OF 

04:27:02.203 --> 04:27:09.934
MAY 23 IN THE OVAL OFFICE. WHEN 
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH THOSE WHO

04:27:10.197 --> 04:27:12.763
HAD GONE TO THE UKRAINE FOR THE 
INAUGURATION. YOU BRIEFLY 

04:27:13.012 --> 04:27:17.238
TESTIFIED THAT YOU HELPED 
PROPOSED NAMES FOR INDIVIDUALS 

04:27:17.491 --> 04:27:19.919
TO GO TO THE INAUGURATION. WAS 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, AMBASSADOR 

04:27:20.498 --> 04:27:26.297
TO  EUROPEAN UNION, ONE OF THE 
NAMES THAT YOU SUBMITTED? 

04:27:26.298 --> 04:27:28.952
&gt;&gt; NO, IT WAS NOT. 
&gt;&gt; BUT HE ULTIMATELY ATTENDED

04:27:36.142 --> 04:27:38.580
THE INAUGURATION. IS THAT RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

04:27:38.581 --> 04:27:41.662
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HOW HE ENDED UP 
AS PART OF THAT OFFICIAL 

04:27:41.914 --> 04:27:44.252
DELEGATION? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE BUT MY

04:27:44.505 --> 04:27:47.056
UNDERSTANDING IS ONCE THE LIST 
LEFT NFC STAFF AND WENT TO 

04:27:47.445 --> 04:27:49.704
REVIEW THROUGH THE PART OF THE 
WHITE HOUSE THAT DETERMINES 

04:27:49.946 --> 04:27:51.443
PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; JUSTIFIED ON RETURNING 

04:27:51.444 --> 04:27:53.444
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND USES QUOTE 
CONNECTIONS WITH MULVANEY  TO 

04:27:53.686 --> 04:27:57.899
ORDER THE SECURED MEETING IN THE
WHITE HOUSE OFFICE. 

04:27:57.900 --> 04:28:03.261
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS THE OVAL OFFICE 
MEETING WAS A PIVOTAL TURNING 

04:28:03.536 --> 04:28:06.935
POINT IN THE UKRAINE POLICY. 
COMING OUT OF THAT MEETING, WHO 

04:28:07.187 --> 04:28:09.492
WAS GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY TO YOUR
RECOLLECTION? WHO WAS GIVEN

04:28:14.110 --> 04:28:15.360
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE UKRAINIAN
POLICY? 

04:28:15.361 --> 04:28:18.011
&gt;&gt; I NEVER SIGNED DOCUMENTS THAT
CHANGE THE NATURE OF POLICY 

04:28:18.262 --> 04:28:20.438
DETERMINATION IN THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT UNDER THE TRUMP 

04:28:20.686 --> 04:28:25.846
ADMINISTRATION -- 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU ALSO SAY -- YOU DID 

04:28:26.100 --> 04:28:30.753
SAY IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU 
FELT THAT YOU TESTIFIED THAT THE

04:28:31.514 --> 04:28:33.514
SECRETARY PERRY,

04:28:35.672 --> 04:28:37.672
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER FELT THEY HAD 

04:28:37.682 --> 04:28:39.682
THE MANDATE TO TAKE THE LEAD 

04:28:45.749 --> 04:28:48.224
ON UKRAINE POLICY. DID YOU NOT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS AN ACCURATE 

04:28:48.470 --> 04:28:50.470
STATEMENT. THEY'RE FEELING 
DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE GOT 

04:28:50.638 --> 04:28:52.638
DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY. 
&gt;&gt; [ CAPTIONERS TRANSITIONING ] 

04:29:31.127 --> 04:29:33.127
. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; WAS IT NORMAL TO HAVE A 

04:29:33.157 --> 04:29:38.097
PERSON WHO WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN
TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN FOREIGN 

04:29:38.317 --> 04:29:40.317
DIPLOMACY. 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT FIND HIS PARTICULAR

04:29:41.207 --> 04:29:43.207
ENGAGEMENT NORMAL, NO. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU 

04:29:43.327 --> 04:29:46.797
TESTIFIED THAT THERE ARE TWO 
CHANNELS, A REGULAR AND 

04:29:47.028 --> 04:29:53.308
IRREGULAR. WHAT DID YOU SEE AS 
RUDY GIULIANI'S ROLE IN THE 

04:29:54.407 --> 04:29:57.047
UKRAINE POLICY? 
&gt;&gt; COUNCILWOMAN, I CAME TO SEE 

04:29:57.277 --> 04:30:01.191
THAT MR. GIULIANI HAD A LARGE 
INFLUENCE ON THE IRREGULAR 

04:30:01.449 --> 04:30:03.449
CHANNEL. 
&gt;&gt; AND WAS THAT NORMAL? IS THAT 

04:30:03.559 --> 04:30:07.687
NORMAL TO HAVE A PRIVATE CITIZEN
OF THE UNITED STATES TAKE AN 

04:30:08.287 --> 04:30:11.367
ACTIVE ROLE IN DIPLOMACY? 
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT NORMAL. IT IS NOT 

04:30:11.597 --> 04:30:14.887
UNUSUAL TO ASK FOR PEOPLE 
OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE 

04:30:15.132 --> 04:30:18.697
OPINIONS TO HELP FORM THE 
POLICIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

04:30:18.937 --> 04:30:20.937
IT 

04:30:22.257 --> 04:30:27.457
IS UNUSUAL TO HAVE IS A PERSON 
PUT INPUT IN THE CHANNEL THAT 

04:30:27.697 --> 04:30:32.907
GOES CONTRARY TO U.S. POLICY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I CREED BACK. 

04:30:33.127 --> 04:30:37.066
&gt;&gt; MR. TURNER, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED
FOR FIVE MINUTES. 

04:30:37.067 --> 04:30:40.557
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. MR. KEPT, MR. 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, THANK YOU FOR

04:30:40.777 --> 04:30:43.097
YOUR SERVICE. I HAVE A GREAT 
DEAL OF APPRECIATION FOR YOUR 

04:30:43.657 --> 04:30:47.126
PROFESSION. YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE
DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE DECISION

04:30:47.357 --> 04:30:50.817
MAKERS. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT A LOT OF

04:30:51.047 --> 04:30:56.650
AUTHORITY ON -- TO EFFECT U.S. 
POLICY BILATERAL ENGAGEMENTS OR 

04:30:57.117 --> 04:30:59.167
MULTI-LOOT RULE MAKEMENTS. 
YOU'RE TRYING TO SHEPHERD 

04:30:59.397 --> 04:31:02.647
THROUGH ISSUES WITH OUR ALLIES. 
ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT, AMBASSADOR 

04:31:02.866 --> 04:31:05.027
TAYLOR SYOU TESTIFIED IN YOUR 
PRIOR TESTIMONY THAT YOU HAVE 

04:31:05.247 --> 04:31:07.627
NOT HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

04:31:07.847 --> 04:31:10.186
IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT, SIR. 

04:31:10.187 --> 04:31:12.727
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT, HAVE YOU HAD ANY 
CONTACT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 

04:31:13.027 --> 04:31:14.686
THE UNITED STATES? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT. 

04:31:14.687 --> 04:31:17.386
&gt;&gt; SO NOT ONLY NO CONVERSATION 
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:31:17.626 --> 04:31:19.957
STATES ABOUT UKRAINE, YOU'VE NOT
HAD ANY CAN'T WITH THE PRESIDENT

04:31:20.197 --> 04:31:22.320
OF THE UNITED STATES, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

04:31:22.321 --> 04:31:24.886
&gt;&gt; SO YOU BOTH KNOW THAT THIS 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS ABOUT THE

04:31:25.117 --> 04:31:27.907
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
DON'T YOU? I MEAN THE MAN THAT 

04:31:28.136 --> 04:31:32.117
NEITHER ONE OF YOU HAVE HAD ANY 
CONTACT WITH, YOU'RE THE FIRST 

04:31:32.616 --> 04:31:35.916
UP WITNESSES. I JUST FIND THAT A
LITTLE AMAZING THAT THE FIST UP 

04:31:36.286 --> 04:31:39.136
WOULD BE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
NEVER HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE 

04:31:40.467 --> 04:31:44.630
PRESIDENT HIMSELF. NOW, KURT 
VOLKER DID HAVE CONTACT WITH THE

04:31:45.447 --> 04:31:48.986
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT WITH
U CRAB. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU 

04:31:49.227 --> 04:31:52.286
SAID HE IS A MA OF HIGHEST 
INTEGGITY. AND I KNOW KURT 

04:31:52.507 --> 04:31:55.006
VOLKER AND HE SERVED AS THE 
MATTO AMBASSADOR, AND THE 

04:31:55.240 --> 04:31:59.261
DIRECTOR OF THE MCCAIN INSTYTE. 
HE IS OH OF THE HIGHEST 

04:31:59.786 --> 04:32:03.136
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. ONE OF THE 
MOSTENINGABLE PEOPLE OF EUROPE. 

04:32:03.387 --> 04:32:07.306
HE IS A TRUTHFUL PLAN, WOULD YOU
AGREE THAT HE IS OF THE HIGHEST 

04:32:07.747 --> 04:32:09.776
INTEGRITY? 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE KURT VOLKER HAS 

04:32:10.006 --> 04:32:13.485
SERVED THE U.S. AS A PUBLIC 
SERVANT VERY WE. 

04:32:13.486 --> 04:32:16.636
&gt;&gt; DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY 
EVIDENCE THAT MR. VOLKER LIED IN

04:32:16.867 --> 04:32:19.846
HIS TESTIMONY TO THIS COMMITTEE?
DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY 

04:32:20.076 --> 04:32:22.756
EVIDENCE THAT KURT VOLKER 
PERJURED HIMSELF OR LIED 

04:32:26.769 --> 04:32:30.529
TO THIS COMMITTEE IN HIS 
TESTIMONY. ANY EVIDENCE? 

04:32:30.530 --> 04:32:34.560
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO EVIDENCE. 
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT, I BELIEVE THAT 

04:32:35.260 --> 04:32:37.606
AMBASSADOR VOLKER'S DEPOSITION 
WAS OVER 400 PAGES AND I DON'T 

04:32:37.956 --> 04:32:40.649
HAVE IT? FRONT OF ME. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT

04:32:40.866 --> 04:32:44.760
HE LIED OR PERJURED HIS? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO BASIS TO MAKE THAT 

04:32:45.276 --> 04:32:47.276
JUNKMENT, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IN THE COURT, 

04:32:47.456 --> 04:32:50.856
GENTLEMEN, AND IF WE WERE, THE 
SIXTH AMENDMENT WOULD APPLY AND 

04:32:51.096 --> 04:32:53.610
MOST OF YOUR TWO TESTIMONIES 
WOULD NOT BE ADMISSIBLE 

04:32:53.856 --> 04:32:56.306
WHATSOEVER, BUT I UNDERSTAND IN 
YOUR PROFESSION, YOU DEAL IN 

04:32:56.546 --> 04:32:59.366
WORDS OF UNDERSTANDING, WORDS OF
BELIEFS AND FEELINGS BECAUSE IN 

04:32:59.596 --> 04:33:02.349
YOUR PROFESSION THAT'S WHAT YOU 
WORK WITH TO TRY TO PULL 

04:33:02.588 --> 04:33:06.920
TOGETHER POLICY AND TO GO IN AND
OUT OF MEETINGS TO TRY TO FOR 

04:33:07.406 --> 04:33:10.746
LATE OPINIONS THAT EFFECT OTHER 
PEOPLE'S DECISION MAKING. AND 

04:33:10.990 --> 04:33:13.629
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, HAVE YOU EVER
PREPARED FOR A MEETING THAT THE 

04:33:13.866 --> 04:33:16.760
PRESIDENT OR THE PRIME MINISTER 
OF A COUNTRY OR WERE YOU TOLD 

04:33:16.986 --> 04:33:19.816
ONE THING BEFORE YOU WENT INTO 
THE MEETING ABOUT WHAT IT WAS TO

04:33:20.056 --> 04:33:22.846
BE ABOUT AND THE MEETING BE 
ABOUT ANOTHER THING OR YOU GET 

04:33:23.076 --> 04:33:25.666
IN THERE AND THE BELIEFS OR 
OPINIONS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE

04:33:25.906 --> 04:33:29.985
-- OR THE' 'PM WERE OTHER THAN 
YOU BELIEVED? 

04:33:29.986 --> 04:33:34.078
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ASKING IF I EVER 
LEARNED SOMETHING NEW? 

04:33:34.079 --> 04:33:36.946
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER WALKED IN WITH 
A BELIEF THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT 

04:33:37.226 --> 04:33:39.979
THE COUNTRY YOU WERE SERVING IN 
AND FOUND OUT THEY WERE WRONG? 

04:33:40.209 --> 04:33:43.356
&gt;&gt; I LEARN SOMETHING IN EVERY 
MEETING, MR. TURNER, BUT I -- 

04:33:43.636 --> 04:33:45.770
YOU KNOW -- 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, THE REASON

04:33:46.059 --> 04:33:50.657
WHY THE SIXTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT
ALLOW HEARSAY IS IT IS UNRELY B 

04:33:50.889 --> 04:33:53.567
BECAUSE FREQUENTLY IT IS 
UNTRUTHFUL. IT IS NOT FACTUAL. 

04:33:53.817 --> 04:33:55.817
IT MIGHT BE BELIEFS OR 
UNDERSTANDINGS. AMBASSADOR, YOU 

04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:59.080
TESTIFIED ABOUT A NUMBER OF 
THINGS THAT YOU HEARD. ISN'T IT 

04:33:59.310 --> 04:34:02.416
TRUE -- POSSIBLE THAT THE THINGS
THAT YOU HEARD WERE NOT TRUE? 

04:34:02.636 --> 04:34:05.916
THAT SOME OF THE BELIEFS AND 
UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU HAD ARE NOT

04:34:06.157 --> 04:34:08.157
ACCURATE, IN FACT, YOU'RE 
MISTAKEN ABOUT SOME OF THE 

04:34:09.509 --> 04:34:13.269
THINGS YOU TESTIFIED TODAY ON A 
FACTUAL BASIS, VERSUS A 

04:34:14.509 --> 04:34:16.509
PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT? 
&gt;&gt; MR. TURNER, I AM HERE TO TELL

04:34:16.726 --> 04:34:19.756
YOU WHAT I KNOW. I AM NOT GOING 
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING I DON'T 

04:34:19.996 --> 04:34:22.780
KNOW. I AM GOING TO TELL YOU 
EVERYTHING I DO KNOW. 

04:34:22.781 --> 04:34:24.907
&gt;&gt; BUT SINCE YOU LEARNED IT FROM
OTHERS -- 

04:34:24.908 --> 04:34:26.755
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I AM 
HERE. 

04:34:26.756 --> 04:34:29.326
&gt;&gt; BUT SINCE YOU LEARNED IT FROM
OTHERS, YOU COULD BE WRONG, 

04:34:29.577 --> 04:34:31.577
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I AM TELLING YOU WHAT I HEARD

04:34:31.686 --> 04:34:34.036
THEM TELL ME. 
&gt;&gt; AND THEY COULD BE WRONG OR 

04:34:34.266 --> 04:34:36.661
THEY COULD BE MISTAKEN OR THEY 
COULD HAVE HEARD IT INCORRECT 

04:34:36.896 --> 04:34:40.280
LIVE, RIGHT, AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. 

04:34:40.281 --> 04:34:44.066
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, SO YOU COULD BE WRONG.
SO I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME. 

04:34:44.296 --> 04:34:46.689
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR CREEDING. 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, THE GENTLEMAN

04:34:46.928 --> 04:34:50.494
ASKED IF YOU COULD BE WRONG. 
WERE YOU WRONG WHEN YOU SAID YOU

04:34:50.726 --> 04:34:52.726
HAD 

04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:56.456
A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT 
PRESIDENT ZELLWEGER HAD TO 

04:34:56.700 --> 04:34:59.055
COMMIT TO AN INVESTIGATION OF 
THE BIDENS BEFORE THE AID GOT 

04:34:59.286 --> 04:35:02.089
RELEASED AND THE AID GOT 
RELEASED AND HE DIDN'T COMMIT TO

04:35:02.606 --> 04:35:04.988
AN INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT WRONG ABOUT WHAT I 

04:35:05.226 --> 04:35:08.640
TOLD YOU WHICH IS WHAT I HEARD. 
THAT IS ALL I SAID. I TOLD YOU 

04:35:08.894 --> 04:35:11.026
WHAT I HEARD. 
&gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THE POINT. WHAT 

04:35:11.266 --> 04:35:15.306
YOU HEARD KID NOT HAPPEN. IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. YOU HAD THREE 

04:35:15.546 --> 04:35:18.175
MEETING WHERE IS THE GUY. HE 
COULD HAVE TOLD YOU. HE DIDN'T 

04:35:18.407 --> 04:35:21.912
ANNOUNCE HE WAS GOING TO DO AN 
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE AID 

04:35:22.166 --> 04:35:25.166
HAPPENED. IT IS NOT JUST COULD 
IT HAVE BEEN WRONG. THE FACT IT 

04:35:25.516 --> 04:35:27.876
WAS WRONG BECAUSE IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN. THE WHOLE POINT WAS YOU 

04:35:28.116 --> 04:35:31.135
HAD A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT 
AID WILL NOT GET RELEASED UNLESS

04:35:31.356 --> 04:35:33.356
THERE 

04:35:36.166 --> 04:35:40.386
IS A COMMITMENTS NOT MAYBE. YOU 
USED CLEAR LANGUAGE, CLEAR 

04:35:40.649 --> 04:35:43.196
UNDERSTANDING AND COMMITMENT AND
THOSE TWO THINGS DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

04:35:43.436 --> 04:35:47.205
SO YOU HAD TO BE WRONG. 
&gt;&gt; MR. JORDAN, THE OTHER THING 

04:35:47.456 --> 04:35:54.331
THAT WENT ON WHEN THAT ASSISTANT
WAS ON HOLD IS WE SHOOK THE 

04:35:54.760 --> 04:35:59.848
CONFIDENCE OF A CLOSE PARTNER IN
OUR RELIABILITY, AND THAT -- 

04:36:00.078 --> 04:36:03.155
&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS 
PROCEEDING IS ABOUT. 

04:36:03.156 --> 04:36:06.065
&gt;&gt; THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS WHOLE 

04:36:06.303 --> 04:36:09.385
THINNING HAS STARTED NOON. 
&gt;&gt; TIME EXPIRED. 

04:36:09.386 --> 04:36:11.765
&gt;&gt; MR. AMBASSADOR, DID YOU WANT 
TO FINISH YOUR ANSWER. 

04:36:11.766 --> 04:36:15.259
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT IS GOOD, MR. CLAIM. 
&gt;&gt; AND I RECOGNIZE MR. CARSON 

04:36:15.488 --> 04:36:18.186
FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I YIELD TO THE 

04:36:18.578 --> 04:36:20.394
CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR 

04:36:20.395 --> 04:36:22.307
YIELDING. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON 

04:36:22.308 --> 04:36:25.225
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRESIDENT 
ZELLWEGER'S STATEMENTS AFTER 

04:36:25.495 --> 04:36:28.906
THIS SCANDAL CAME TO LIGHT WHEN 
HE WAS ASKED WERE YOU PRESSURED,

04:36:29.165 --> 04:36:33.775
HOW THE PHONE CALL GO, ET 
CETERA. UKRAINIANS, MR. KENT, 

04:36:34.475 --> 04:36:38.065
ARE PRETTY SOPHISTICATED ABOUT 
U.S. POLITICS, ARE THEY NOT? 

04:36:38.316 --> 04:36:41.486
&gt;&gt; PERHAPS. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD AGREE THAT IF 

04:36:41.776 --> 04:36:44.005
PRESIDENT ZELLWEGER CONTRADICTED
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SAID OF 

04:36:44.246 --> 04:36:47.986
COURSE I FELT PRESSURED, THEY 
WERE HOLDING UP $400 IN MILLION 

04:36:48.315 --> 04:36:52.923
TEAR ASSISTANCE, WE HAVE PEOPLE 
DYING EVERY DAY, IF HE WERE TO 

04:36:53.175 --> 04:36:56.465
CONTRADICT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DIRECTLY, THEY WOULD BE 

04:36:56.705 --> 04:37:00.088
SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO KNOW 
THEY MAY PAY AUTO VERY HEAVY 

04:37:00.325 --> 04:37:02.705
PRICE WITH THIS PRESIDENT, IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

04:37:02.706 --> 04:37:05.385
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT. 
&gt;&gt; AND MR. ZELLWEGER NOT ONLY 

04:37:05.626 --> 04:37:08.678
HAD TO BOARY ABOUT RETRIBUTION 
FROM DONALD TRUMP SHOULD HE 

04:37:08.906 --> 04:37:11.148
CONTRADICT DONALD TRUMP 
PUBLICLY, HE ALSO HAS TO WORRY 

04:37:11.375 --> 04:37:14.838
ABOUT HOW HE IS PERCEIVED 
DOMESTICALLY, DOESN'T HE, 

04:37:15.509 --> 04:37:17.264
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT ZELLWEGER IS VERY 

04:37:17.265 --> 04:37:22.335
SENSITIVE TO THE VIEWS OF 
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE WHO, INDEED, 

04:37:26.338 --> 04:37:30.095
ARE VERY ATTENTIVE TO 
UKRAINIAN-U.S. POLITICS, YES. 

04:37:30.330 --> 04:37:35.399
&gt;&gt; SO IF PRESIDENT ZELLWEGER 
WERE TO SAY I HAD TO CAPITULATE 

04:37:35.725 --> 04:37:39.835
TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS, AND I 
WAS READY TO GO ON CNN UNTIL THE

04:37:40.125 --> 04:37:43.625
AID GOT RESTORED, THAT WOULD 
OBVIOUSLY BE HURTFUL TO HIM BACK

04:37:43.865 --> 04:37:49.815
HOME, WOULD IT NOT? 
&gt;&gt; HE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE SEEN 

04:37:50.525 --> 04:37:56.526
TO BE DEFERRING TO ANY FOREIGN 
LEADER. HE IS VERY CONFIDENT IN 

04:37:57.685 --> 04:38:02.395
HIS OWN ABILITIES AND HE KNOWS 
THAT THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE EXPECT

04:38:03.118 --> 04:38:08.025
HIM TO BE CLEAR AND DEFEND 
UKRAINIAN INTERESTS. 

04:38:08.026 --> 04:38:10.275
&gt;&gt; MR. CARSON? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 

04:38:10.276 --> 04:38:14.425
&gt;&gt; MY COLLEAGUE TOUCHED BRIEFLY 
ON THE CAMPAIGN TO REMOVE CAREER

04:38:15.460 --> 04:38:18.335
DIPLOMAT AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH.
MR. KENT, YOU STATED IN PREVIOUS

04:38:18.565 --> 04:38:22.805
TESTIMONY THAT YOU WERE AWARE OF
THE CAMPAIGN OF, QUOTE, SLANDER 

04:38:23.046 --> 04:38:26.215
AGAINST THE AMBASSADOR IN REAL 
TIME WHICH BASICALLY UNFOLDED IN

04:38:27.375 --> 04:38:30.149
THE MEDIA. WHERE DO YOU 
UNDERSTAND THIS MISINFORMATION 

04:38:30.375 --> 04:38:33.684
CAMPAIGN WAS COMING FROM AND WHO
WAS PERPETUATING IT. 

04:38:33.685 --> 04:38:38.619
&gt;&gt; TO MY UNDERSTANDING, THE THEN
PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF UKRAINE, 

04:38:39.239 --> 04:38:44.265
NOW EX, MET RUDY GIULIANI IN NEW
YORK ON A PRIVATE VISIT IN 

04:38:44.505 --> 04:38:48.265
JANUARY. THEY HAD A SECOND 
MEETING IN FEBRUARY. AND THROUGH

04:38:48.495 --> 04:38:52.448
THE GOOD OFFICING OF THE FORMER 
MAYOR OF NEW YORK, HE GAVE AN 

04:38:52.778 --> 04:38:58.835
INTERVIEW TO JOHN SOLOMON, THEN 
OF THE HILL, IN EARLY MARCH AND 

04:38:59.115 --> 04:39:01.115
THE CAMPAIGN WAS LAUNCHED 

04:39:04.605 --> 04:39:07.916
ON MARCH 20th. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; A CORRUPT UKRAINIAN 

04:39:08.148 --> 04:39:10.565
PROSECUTOR GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO 
A REPORTER IN THE UNITED STATES 

04:39:10.805 --> 04:39:12.805
AND MADE CLAIMS THAT THE 
AMBASSADOR PROVIDED OFFICIALS 

04:39:12.937 --> 04:39:16.808
WITH A, QUOTE, DO NOT PROSECUTOR
LIST. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON 

04:39:17.045 --> 04:39:20.265
TO BELIEVE THIS IS TRUE? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE EVERY REASON TO 

04:39:20.495 --> 04:39:23.026
BELIEVE IT IS NOT TRUE. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE REPUTATION OF 

04:39:23.245 --> 04:39:25.888
THE MAN WHO MADE THESE 
ALLEGATIONS, SIR? 

04:39:25.889 --> 04:39:30.275
&gt;&gt; HE WAS A POLITICIAN OF LONG 
STANDING. HE HAD BEEN MIN TEAR 

04:39:30.965 --> 04:39:33.415
OF INTERIOR AFTER THE 
REVOLUTION. THE EMBASSY HAD GOOD

04:39:33.755 --> 04:39:37.266
RELATIONS WITH HIM FOR YEARS. HE
WAS IMPRISONED BY THE PRESIDENT,

04:39:37.570 --> 04:39:41.768
CAME OUT, WAS ELECTED MAJORITY 
LEADER, OF THE THEN PRESIDENT'S 

04:39:42.242 --> 04:39:45.626
PARTY AND THEN BECAME PROSECUTOR
GENERAL IN THE SPRING OF 2016. 

04:39:45.855 --> 04:39:49.605
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH? WAS SHE 

04:39:50.148 --> 04:39:53.214
WORKING HARD TO COMBAT 
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE, SIR? 

04:39:53.215 --> 04:39:56.147
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS DEDICATED, AS IS 
EVERY U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL 

04:39:56.505 --> 04:39:59.395
IN UKRAINE TO HELP THE 
UKRAINIANS OVERCOME THE LEGACY 

04:39:59.675 --> 04:40:02.402
OF CORRUPTION, WHICH THEY 
ACTUALLY HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF 

04:40:02.968 --> 04:40:05.773
IMPORTANT STEPS SINCE 2014. 
&gt;&gt; SO, IN FACT, BEFORE ALL OF 

04:40:06.019 --> 04:40:08.157
THIS HAPPENED, YOU AND YOUR 
SUPERIORS AT THE STATE 

04:40:08.385 --> 04:40:11.636
DEPARTMENT ASKED THE AMBASSADOR 
TO EXTEND HER TIME IN THE 

04:40:12.105 --> 04:40:14.244
UKRAINE, CORRECT, SIR? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

04:40:14.245 --> 04:40:15.794
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SUPPORT HER 
EXTENSION? 

04:40:15.795 --> 04:40:18.988
&gt;&gt; I ASKED HER TO EXTEND UNTIL 
THE END OF THIS YEAR TO GET 

04:40:19.217 --> 04:40:25.516
THROUGH THE ELECTION PSYCH UNTIL
UKRAINE AND THEN  UNDER THE 

04:40:25.987 --> 04:40:29.274
SECRETARY ASKED HER TO STAY 
UNTIL 2020. 

04:40:29.275 --> 04:40:31.635
&gt;&gt; AND SOME PROBABLY DIDN'T LIKE
HER EFFORTS TO ROOT OUT 

04:40:31.878 --> 04:40:34.225
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; IN MY TESTIMONY, YOU CAN'T 

04:40:35.365 --> 04:40:37.144
PROMOTE PRINCIPLED 
ANTI-CORRUPTION OUT WITHOUT 

04:40:37.145 --> 04:40:40.004
PITTING OFF CORRUPT PEOPLE. 
&gt;&gt; FAIR ENOUGH. 

04:40:40.005 --> 04:40:44.638
&gt;&gt; NOW, SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE 
HELPED GIULIANI SMEAR HER, DID 

04:40:45.295 --> 04:40:47.684
THEY NOT? 
&gt;&gt; THEY DID. 

04:40:47.685 --> 04:40:49.965
&gt;&gt; SO ULTIMATELY THAT SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN PUSHED PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:40:50.214 --> 04:40:53.478
TO REMOVE HER, CORRECT, SIR? 
&gt;&gt; I CANNOT JUDGE THAT. WHAT I 

04:40:53.705 --> 04:40:58.867
CAN SAY IS RUDY GIULIANI'S SMEAR
CAMPAIGN WAS U BIGTOUS IN THE 

04:40:59.525 --> 04:41:05.094
FOX NEWS AND ON THE INTERNET AND
TWITTER SPHERE. 

04:41:05.095 --> 04:41:10.168
&gt;&gt; AND HAVE YOU EVER BEFORE SEEN
AN INSTANCE WHERE AN AMBASSADOR 

04:41:10.530 --> 04:41:14.565
WAS FORCED OUT BY THE PRESIDENT 
FOLLOWING A SMEAR CAMPAIGN OF 

04:41:14.795 --> 04:41:17.486
MISINFORMATION ORCHESTRATED BY 
THE PRESIDENT'S ALLY ? 

04:41:17.487 --> 04:41:19.884
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT. 
&gt;&gt; NOR I. 

04:41:19.885 --> 04:41:21.885
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, 

04:41:23.907 --> 04:41:28.747
I FIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. MR.

04:41:28.974 --> 04:41:31.808
TAYLOR, THIS SHOULD BE EASY 
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO USE A LOT 

04:41:32.084 --> 04:41:34.949
OF YOUR WORDS FROM THE PREVIOUS 
DEPOSITION AS WE GO FORWARD. IN 

04:41:35.174 --> 04:41:38.555
YOUR DEPOSITION YOU SPOKE OF 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE AND ITS 

04:41:38.925 --> 04:41:42.414
RELATIONSHIP TO THE UNITED 
STATES AND HOW MUCH YOU SUPPORT 

04:41:42.694 --> 04:41:48.924
THAT. IN 2014, YOU AND I A 
QUOTING THIS, URGED THE OH BANNA

04:41:49.155 --> 04:41:52.934
ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE LETHAL
WEAPONS IN ORDER TO DETER 

04:41:53.195 --> 04:41:55.795
FURTHER RUSSIA AGGRESSION. DID 
THE OH BANNA ADMINISTRATION 

04:41:56.025 --> 04:41:58.348
PROVIDE LETHAL WEAPON ? 
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 

04:41:58.349 --> 04:42:01.325
&gt;&gt; THEY PROVIDED BLANKETS. IN 
YOUR DEPOSITION, THEY SAID 

04:42:01.805 --> 04:42:04.824
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S OBJECTION WAS 
IT MIGHT PROVOKE THE RUSSIANS, 

04:42:05.055 --> 04:42:08.214
AND, IN FACT, YOU TESTIFY IN 
YOUR DEPOSITION THAT THE OBAMA 

04:42:08.445 --> 04:42:12.024
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T HAVE A 
GOOD ARGUMENT SINCE RUSSIA HAD 

04:42:12.320 --> 04:42:17.544
ALREADY PROVOKED AND THEY HAVE 
INVADED UKRAINE, IS THAT 

04:42:17.787 --> 04:42:19.233
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT, SIR. 

04:42:19.234 --> 04:42:22.508
&gt;&gt; IT IS A SHAME YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THE ADVICE OF COMBAT VETERAN 

04:42:22.744 --> 04:42:24.954
LIKE YOU, SIR. SOMEONE WHO 
UNDERSTANDS WHAT DETERRENTS 

04:42:25.194 --> 04:42:27.934
PROVIDE BECAUSE A LOT OF 
UKRAINIAN LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN 

04:42:28.167 --> 04:42:32.895
SAVED IF HE HAD TAKEN YOUR 
ADVICE. IN YOUR DEPOSITION, YOU 

04:42:33.124 --> 04:42:36.747
SAID, AND I QUOTE, HAPPY, YOU 
WERE HAPPY WITH THE TRUMP 

04:42:37.405 --> 04:42:40.105
ADMINISTRATION'S ASSISTANCE. AND
IT PROVIDED BOTH LETHAL AND 

04:42:40.325 --> 04:42:43.696
FINANCIAL AID, DID IT NOT? 
&gt;&gt; IT DID, SIR. 

04:42:43.697 --> 04:42:46.065
&gt;&gt; AND YOU ALSO STATED THAT IT 
WAS A 

04:42:50.094 --> 04:42:52.148
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT, IS THAT
CORRECT? 

04:42:52.149 --> 04:42:54.994
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; NOW WE PROVIDE M. R. E.S AND 

04:42:55.237 --> 04:42:58.264
BLANKETS, THEY DO NOT DO THAT. 
TODAY YOU SAID I WAS BEGINNING 

04:42:58.505 --> 04:43:01.494
TO FEAR THAT THE LONG-STANDING 
U.S. POLICY OF STRONG SUPPORT 

04:43:01.734 --> 04:43:05.254
FOR UKRAINE WAS SHIFTING. I HAVE
A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH LONG 

04:43:05.488 --> 04:43:08.145
STANDING BASED ON WHAT WE JUST 
TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE IT WASN'T 

04:43:08.834 --> 04:43:12.887
REALLY LONG STANDING, STRONG 
SUPPORT. IT SEEMS TO ME, THE 

04:43:13.255 --> 04:43:16.094
STRONG SUPPORT CAME WITH THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. WOULD YOU AGREE 

04:43:17.494 --> 04:43:21.696
WITH THAT, SIR? UNLESS YOU CAN 
CONSIDER M. R. E.S AND BLANKETS 

04:43:22.674 --> 04:43:25.133
STRONG SUPPORT. I WOULDN'T CALL 
IT LONG STANDING. 

04:43:25.134 --> 04:43:29.657
&gt;&gt; THE LONG STANDING I'M 
REFERRING TO THERE IS THE 

04:43:29.954 --> 04:43:33.964
LONG-STANDING POLITICAL SUPPORT,
ECONOMIC SUPPORT AND INCREASING 

04:43:34.264 --> 04:43:36.264
MILITARY SUPPORT. 
&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY THAT STRONG SUPPORT

04:43:36.364 --> 04:43:38.067
CAME FROM CONGRESS. 
&gt;&gt; IT DID. 

04:43:38.068 --> 04:43:40.247
&gt;&gt; BUT IT DIDN'T COME FROM THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AS 

04:43:40.478 --> 04:43:42.834
COMPARED TO WHAT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED TO 

04:43:43.466 --> 04:43:46.534
DO. THE STRONG SUPPORT CAME WITH
THIS ADMINISTRATION. NOT THE 

04:43:47.194 --> 04:43:49.704
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND MAYBE 
NOW WE UNDERSTAND WHAT PRESIDENT

04:43:49.938 --> 04:43:55.504
OBAMA MEANT WHEN HE TOLD RUSSIAN
PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV THAT HE'D 

04:43:55.747 --> 04:43:58.924
HAVE MORE FLEXN 'T AFTER HIS 
ELECTION. MAYBE -- 

04:43:59.164 --> 04:44:01.744
ELECTIONABILITY WAS AFTER HIS 
ELECTION. MAYBE THAT WAS TO 

04:44:02.085 --> 04:44:05.329
PROVIDE LETHAL AID TO THE 
UKRAINE ALLOWING THE RUSSIANS TO

04:44:05.564 --> 04:44:09.714
MARCH RIGHT IN AND KILL THE 
UKRAINIANS. IN YOUR DEPOSITION, 

04:44:10.294 --> 04:44:15.064
YOU URNINGED THEM TO PROVIDE 
LETHAL WEAPONS TO UKRAINE IN 

04:44:16.258 --> 04:44:20.324
ORDER TO FURTHER DETER RUSSIAN 
AGGRESSION, AND NOW THEY HAVE 

04:44:20.609 --> 04:44:23.028
THAT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, 
DON'T THEY? 

04:44:23.029 --> 04:44:24.749
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE THE JAVELINS, YES, 
SIR. 

04:44:24.750 --> 04:44:28.338
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO YIELD 
THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME TO MR. 

04:44:29.664 --> 04:44:31.675
AT CLIFF. 
&gt;&gt; THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR 

04:44:32.007 --> 04:44:34.348
YIELDING. 
&gt;&gt; NO PRESSURE, NO DEMANDSNO 

04:44:34.638 --> 04:44:37.478
COMMISSIONS, NOTHING CORRUPT, 
NOTHING ON THE L CAY THAT'S WHAT

04:44:38.024 --> 04:44:42.697
WE HEARD PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY 
SAY, AND BECAUSE HOUSE 

04:44:43.297 --> 04:44:45.709
DEMOCRATS' CHARGES AGAINST 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE BEEN 

04:44:46.764 --> 04:44:49.254
PUBLICLY, REPEATEDLY 
CONSISTENTLY BEEN DENIED BY 

04:44:49.484 --> 04:44:52.614
PRESIDENT ZELL LEN SKI, YOU 
HEARD THE -- ZELENSKYY, YOU 

04:44:52.887 --> 04:44:58.417
HEARD THE DEFENSE FROM CHAIRMAN 
SCHIFF. HE IS LYING BECAUSE HE 

04:44:58.654 --> 04:45:03.267
HAS TO. HE HAS TO LIE BECAUSE 
THE THREATS, THE DEMANDS, THE 

04:45:03.994 --> 04:45:07.644
BLACKMAIL, THE EXTORTION THAT 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE ALLEGING, IF

04:45:07.984 --> 04:45:12.614
HE DIDN'T DO THAT, HE COULDN'T 
POSSIBLY RISK MILITARY AID. HE 

04:45:12.854 --> 04:45:16.888
WOULD HAVE TO DO ANYTHING HE HAD
TO SECURE IT. THE PROBLEM WITH 

04:45:17.114 --> 04:45:20.034
THAT, THE WHOLE IN THAT ARGUE --
HOLE IN THAT ARGUMENT IS YOU 

04:45:20.264 --> 04:45:26.123
HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT DID 
MR. ZELENSKYY ACTUALLY HAVE TO 

04:45:26.354 --> 04:45:28.904
DO TO GET THE AID? THE ANSWER IS

04:45:32.347 --> 04:45:35.574
NOTHING. HE DID NOTHING. HE 
DIDN'T OPEN ANY INVESTIGATIONS. 

04:45:35.828 --> 04:45:39.585
HE DIDN'T CALL ATTORNEY GENERAL 
BILL BARR. HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF 

04:45:39.824 --> 04:45:43.117
THE THINGS THAT HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
SAY THAT HE WAS BEING FORCED AND

04:45:43.374 --> 04:45:47.194
COERCED AND THREATENED TO DO. HE
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE HE 

04:45:48.622 --> 04:45:50.622
DIDN'T HAVE 

04:45:53.294 --> 04:45:56.264
TO. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ROADWAYED FOR FIVE 

04:45:56.728 --> 04:45:58.728
MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

04:45:58.944 --> 04:46:02.604
THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TRUE 
HEROIC EFFORTS, BOTH TODAY AND 

04:46:02.824 --> 04:46:08.294
ALSO THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREERS. 
I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU, MR. 

04:46:08.786 --> 04:46:15.525
KENT. IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID
THAT YOU HAD IN MID AUGUST, IT 

04:46:15.804 --> 04:46:20.984
BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT 
GIULIANI'S EVIDENTS TO BEGIN UP 

04:46:21.204 --> 04:46:23.204
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED 
INVESTIGATIONS WERE NOW 

04:46:23.487 --> 04:46:27.348
INFECTING U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH 
UKRAINE LEAVE RABBLING PRESIDENT

04:46:27.595 --> 04:46:31.514
ZELENSKYY'S DESIRE FOR A WHITE 
HOUSE MEETING. MR. KENT, DID YOU

04:46:31.734 --> 04:46:35.296
ACTUALLY WRITE A MEMO 
DOCUMENTING YOUR CONCERNS THAT 

04:46:35.524 --> 04:46:39.219
THERE WAS AN EFFORT UNDERWAY TO 
PRESSURE UKRAINE TO OPEN AN 

04:46:39.772 --> 04:46:41.925
INVESTIGATION TO BENEFIT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

04:46:41.926 --> 04:46:44.784
&gt;&gt; YES, MOM. I WROTE A 
METROPLEXO TO THE FILE ON AUGUST

04:46:45.064 --> 04:46:48.334
16th. 
&gt;&gt; -- MEMO TO THE FILE ON AUGUST

04:46:48.807 --> 04:46:50.553
16th. 
&gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS 

04:46:50.554 --> 04:46:52.514
THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I SUBMITTED IT TO THE STATE 

04:46:52.515 --> 04:46:53.668
DEPARTMENT SUBJECT TO THE 
SUBPOENA. 

04:46:53.669 --> 04:46:56.393
&gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE 
PIECE OF PAPER FROM THE STATE 

04:46:56.614 --> 04:47:00.714
DEPARTMENT RELATIVE TO THIS 
INVESTIGATION. BOTH OF YOU HAVE 

04:47:01.418 --> 04:47:05.289
MADE COMPELLING CASES OF THE 
IMPORTANCE OF UKRAINE TO EUROPE,

04:47:05.514 --> 04:47:09.351
TO THE 70 YEARS OF PEACE, THE 
BENEFIT THAT IT HAS TO THE 

04:47:10.087 --> 04:47:13.536
UNITED STATES' NATIONAL 
SECURITY, AND OUR GOAL TO 

04:47:13.774 --> 04:47:21.304
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SOVEREIGNTY 
OF NATIONS. MEANWHILE, RUSSIA IS

04:47:21.635 --> 04:47:23.635
VIOLENTLY ATTACKING 

04:47:25.868 --> 04:47:29.755
PEOPLE IN UKRAINE. SO 
WITHHOLDING MILITARY AID, DOES 

04:47:33.511 --> 04:47:37.827
THAT WEAKEN UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK IT SENDS THE 

04:47:38.138 --> 04:47:42.478
WRONG SIGNAL, AND IT DID FOR A 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE 

04:47:43.131 --> 04:47:46.905
ASSISTANCE FROM THE F.Y. '19 WAS
RELEASED AND IS IN THE PROCESS 

04:47:47.129 --> 04:47:50.399
OF HEADING TOWARDS UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; DOES IT EMBOLDEN RUSSIA WHEN 

04:47:50.699 --> 04:47:54.930
THERE WAS NO AID BEING SENT TO 
THE UKRAINE? 

04:47:54.931 --> 04:47:58.094
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE SIGNAL THAT THERE
IS CONTROVERSY AND QUESTION 

04:47:58.331 --> 04:48:01.947
ABOUT THE U.S. DEPORT OF UKRAINE
SENDS THE SIGNAL TO VLADIMIR 

04:48:02.175 --> 04:48:05.145
PUTIN THAT HE CAN LEVERAGE THAT 
AS HE SEEKS TO NEGOTIATE WITH 

04:48:05.391 --> 04:48:07.674
NOT ONLY UKRAINE BUT OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 

04:48:07.675 --> 04:48:09.675
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, I THINK 

04:48:10.246 --> 04:48:15.529
YOU MENTIONED THAT A WHITE HOUSE
MEETING FOR ZELENSKYY WOULD 

04:48:15.897 --> 04:48:20.385
BOOST HIS ABILITY TO YOSH GAIT 
FOR A -- NEGOTIATE FOR A 

04:48:21.259 --> 04:48:23.494
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND RUSSIA IN 

04:48:23.735 --> 04:48:28.004
GENERAL STHAT TRUE? 
&gt;&gt; IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT 

04:48:28.577 --> 04:48:33.395
U.S. SUPPORT FOR MR. ZHU LEN 
SKI, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IN HIS 

04:48:33.628 --> 04:48:35.914
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS 
VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL ENABLE 

04:48:36.145 --> 04:48:39.874
HIM TO GET A BETTER AGREEMENT 
WITH THAT SUPPORT FROM THE 

04:48:40.149 --> 04:48:43.220
UNITED STATES, BOTH FROM THE 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO 

04:48:43.475 --> 04:48:45.605
JUST FROM THE POLITICAL 
ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. 

04:48:45.827 --> 04:48:49.895
&gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS NOT YET HAD THAT 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING, HAS HE? 

04:48:50.134 --> 04:48:55.746
&gt;&gt; HE HAS NOT. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS IRONIC THAT THE

04:48:55.975 --> 04:48:59.195
SOVIET-BORN LEV PARNAS WHO HAS 
NOW BEEN INDICTED HAD A MEETING 

04:48:59.454 --> 04:49:02.345
WITH THE INSPECT THE WHITE HOUSE
AFTER PARTICIPATING IN A NUMBER 

04:49:02.615 --> 04:49:05.365
OF CAMPAIGN EVENTS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT AND CONTRIBUTING $3 

04:49:05.644 --> 04:49:11.648
25,000 TO THE PRESIDENT'S PACK. 
SO MAYBE IT IS ACTUALLY THE 

04:49:11.889 --> 04:49:16.015
REQUIREMENT THAT YOU GIVE MONEY 
TO THE PRESIDENT'S PACK IN ORDER

04:49:16.234 --> 04:49:22.098
TO GET THAT MEETING AT THE WHITE
HOUSE. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, IS IT 

04:49:23.028 --> 04:49:26.985
TRUE THAT THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL
NOW HAS OPENED AN 

04:49:31.274 --> 04:49:35.105
INVESTIGATION IN UKRAINE? THE 
NEW PROSECUTOR GENERAL THAT 

04:49:35.392 --> 04:49:40.195
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS 
APPOINTED IS, INDEED, 

04:49:40.758 --> 04:49:44.413
INVESTIGATING CRIMES IN GENERAL.
IS THAT YOUR QUESTION? 

04:49:44.414 --> 04:49:46.113
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; BUT -- 

04:49:46.114 --> 04:49:51.577
&gt;&gt; HE IS IN OFFICE AND IS 
INVESTIGATING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

04:49:51.805 --> 04:49:55.294
&gt;&gt; HAS HE SPECIFIED WHAT 
INVESTIGATIONS HE HAS 

04:49:55.955 --> 04:49:56.643
UNDERTAKEN? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

04:49:56.644 --> 04:50:01.434
&gt;&gt; HE HAS NOT. ALL RIGHT. I 
YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME TO 

04:50:02.234 --> 04:50:05.419
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF. 
&gt;&gt; JUST A QUICK QUESTION. MY 

04:50:05.645 --> 04:50:08.687
COLLEAGUES, A COUPLE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES REFERENCED THE 

04:50:09.099 --> 04:50:12.898
CONVERSATION, THE CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND 

04:50:13.555 --> 04:50:16.284
PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV. YET, THAT 
WAS IN 2012 THERE IS A 

04:50:16.804 --> 04:50:19.574
SUGGESTION THAT HE WAS SAYING HE
WAS GOING GO EASY ON RUSSIA OVER

04:50:19.807 --> 04:50:25.449
THE INVASION OF UKRAINE. BUT 
THAT TOOK PLACE -- THAT INVASION

04:50:25.694 --> 04:50:28.484
TOOK PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THAT 
CONVERSATION. DO YOU BELIEVE 

04:50:28.724 --> 04:50:32.704
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GOING 
EASY ON AN INVASION THAT HADN'T 

04:50:32.954 --> 04:50:35.813
HAPPENED YET, DO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE. 

04:50:35.814 --> 04:50:40.017
&gt;&gt; IT WAS MORE OR LESS A 
RHETORICAL QUESTION. I WILL 

04:50:43.097 --> 04:50:48.474
YIELD NOW TO MR. STEWART -- I'M 
SORRY. MR. STEWART. YES. 

04:50:48.714 --> 04:50:52.224
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. TO THE WITNESSES, 
THANK YOU. TIME IS PRECIOUS, SO 

04:50:52.444 --> 04:50:55.817
I AM GOING TO GO VERY, VERY 
QUICKLY. WELCOME, I THINK, TO 

04:50:56.034 --> 04:50:59.144
YEAR FOUR OF THE ONGOING 
IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

04:50:59.370 --> 04:51:02.163
I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
DRAG INTOED THIS. I THINK THE 

04:51:02.404 --> 04:51:07.327
SIGN BEHIND ME SAYS IT VERY 
WELL. BY THE MYS L BLOWER'S -- 

04:51:07.624 --> 04:51:09.887
WHISTLE BLOWER'S ATTORNEY. AFTER
LISTENING FOR WHAT HAS BEEN 

04:51:10.109 --> 04:51:14.138
GOING ON NOW FOR FOUR HOURS AND 
21 MINUTES, AFTER ALL OF THE 

04:51:14.437 --> 04:51:16.804
SECRET HEARINGS, AFTER ALL OF 
THE LEAKS, AFTER HEARING 

04:51:17.034 --> 04:51:19.167
WITNESSES SUCH AS YOURSELVES 
GIVE YOUR OPINIONS, IT REALLY 

04:51:19.404 --> 04:51:23.717
COMES DOWN DO THIS ONE THING. 
ONE THING THAT COMES DOWN TO. 

04:51:23.947 --> 04:51:26.264
THIS IS A THE TRANSCRIPT THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED OF 

04:51:26.614 --> 04:51:31.354
THIS PHONE CALL. THERE IS ONE 
SENTENCE, ONE PHONE CALL. THAT 

04:51:31.584 --> 04:51:35.424
IS WHAT THIS ENTIRE IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDING IS BASED UPON. AND I 

04:51:35.874 --> 04:51:38.544
HAVE TO TELL YOU IF YOUR 
IMPEACHMENT CASE IS SO WEAK THAT

04:51:38.774 --> 04:51:42.304
YOU HAVE TO LIE AND EXAGGERATE 
ABOUT IT TO CONVINCE THE 

04:51:42.524 --> 04:51:44.857
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED 
TO REMOVE THIS PRESIDENT, THEN 

04:51:45.094 --> 04:51:48.196
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM. AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIED 

04:51:48.424 --> 04:51:51.714
TO AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THIS. WE 
FIRST HEARD A LOT ABOUT QUID PRO

04:51:51.949 --> 04:51:54.274
QUO. AND THEN MANY PEOPLE 
REALIZED THAT WAS MEANINGLESS, 

04:51:54.997 --> 04:51:58.344
SO THEY SAID LET'S GO FOR THE 
FENCES. LET'S TALK ABOUT 

04:51:58.924 --> 04:52:01.454
EXTORTION, BRIBERY, COVER-UP AND
OBSTRUCTION, FOR WHICH THERE IS 

04:52:01.694 --> 04:52:05.344
ZERO EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THAT. WE
HEARD A DARK STATION OF THE 

04:52:06.224 --> 04:52:08.474
PRESIDENT'S -- CHARACTERIZATION 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S PHONE CALL 

04:52:08.807 --> 04:52:13.451
THAT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUSLY 
INACCURATE THAT IT HAD TO BE 

04:52:13.674 --> 04:52:17.034
DESCRIBED AS A PARODY. NONE OF 
IT MATTERS. IT COMES DOWN TO 

04:52:17.274 --> 04:52:19.274
THIS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR 
INSIGHT. WE AAPPRECIATE YOUR 

04:52:19.364 --> 04:52:22.604
OPINION BUT ALL YOU CAN DO IS 
GIVE YOUR OPINION OF THIS, THIS 

04:52:22.834 --> 04:52:26.224
ONE PHONE CALL. LET ME ASK YOU, 
GENTLEMAN. BOTH OF YOU WHO HAVE 

04:52:26.479 --> 04:52:29.814
SAT HERE TODAY, YOU TESTIFIED 
CORRUPTION IN THE UKRAINE IS 

04:52:30.089 --> 04:52:36.114
ENDEMIC. WOULD WE AGREE ON THAT?
SIMPLE QUESTION. THE PROBLEM IS 

04:52:36.339 --> 04:52:38.339
-- 
&gt;&gt; IT IS A PROBLEM AND THEY ARE 

04:52:38.538 --> 04:52:42.134
TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS IT. 
&gt;&gt; EARLIER IN THE HEARING BOTH 

04:52:42.569 --> 04:52:47.214
SAID YOU USED THE WORD ENDEMIC 
OR AGREED TO IT. IT IS IN THE 

04:52:47.464 --> 04:52:49.947
COURTS, OLLIE GARTS, 
PROSECUTORS, IT IS EVERYWHERE. I

04:52:50.199 --> 04:52:53.778
THINK WE CAN ALSO AGREE THAT IS 
NOT THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD 

04:52:54.017 --> 04:52:56.254
WHERE WE EXPERIENCE AND SEE 
CORRUPTION. THERE ARE DOZENS AND

04:52:56.669 --> 04:52:59.654
DOZENS OF NATIONS THAT ARE 
STEEPED IN CORRUPTION. WOULD YOU

04:52:59.884 --> 04:53:02.214
AGREE WITH THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS 

04:53:02.449 --> 04:53:04.513
CORRUPTION IN EVERY COUNTRY, 
INCLUDING OURS. 

04:53:04.514 --> 04:53:07.147
&gt;&gt; OKAY. THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; AND SOME WE'RE CLEARLY MORE 

04:53:07.697 --> 04:53:10.366
CONCERNED ABOUT THAN OTHERS. IN 
THESE CORRUPT NATIONS IN WHICH 

04:53:10.604 --> 04:53:13.744
THERE ARE PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF 
CORRUPT INDIVIDUALS, HUNDREDS OF

04:53:14.424 --> 04:53:17.874
CORRUPT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS , 
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF 

04:53:18.276 --> 04:53:20.954
ANY TIME WHERE THE VICE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

04:53:21.188 --> 04:53:25.694
SHOWS UP AND DEMANDS THAT A 
SPECIFIC PROSECUTOR BE FIRED AND

04:53:25.934 --> 04:53:30.044
GIVES THEM AUTO SIX-HOUR TIME 
LIMIT -- A SIX-HOUR TIME LIMIT 

04:53:30.294 --> 04:53:33.994
TO DO THAT? ARE YOU AWARE OF 
THAT EVER HAPPENING ANY OTHER 

04:53:34.234 --> 04:53:36.234
PLACE? 
&gt;&gt; I GUESS THE ANSWER IS NO. AND

04:53:36.554 --> 04:53:39.064
I JUST THINK IT IS INTERESTING 
THAT OUT OF HUNDREDS OF CORRUPT 

04:53:39.764 --> 04:53:44.724
INDIVIDUALS, DOZENS OF CORRUPT 
NATIONS, THAT HAPPENED ONE TIME,

04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:47.395
AND IT HAPPENED WITH THE 
INDIVIDUAL WHOSE SON WAS BEING 

04:53:47.627 --> 04:53:51.516
PAID BY THE ORGANIZATION THAT 
WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION. ONE OF 

04:53:51.734 --> 04:53:54.911
THE THING -- OTHER THING VERY 
QUICKLY. IF SOMEONE WAS A 

04:53:55.162 --> 04:53:57.504
CANDIDATE FOR POLITICAL OFFICE, 
EVEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:53:57.737 --> 04:53:59.844
STATES, SHOULD THEY BE 

04:54:04.857 --> 04:54:08.084
IMMUNE FROM INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, SIR.

04:54:08.334 --> 04:54:11.626
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I WOULD AGREE WITH
THAT. I THINK WE ALL IT WOULD 

04:54:13.257 --> 04:54:16.927
AGREE WITH THAT. THEY ARE IMMUNE
FROM ANY QUESTIONS OR 

04:54:17.154 --> 04:54:21.824
INVESTIGATIONS. I THINK IT IS 
ABSURD. THOSE OF US IN PUBLIC 

04:54:22.204 --> 04:54:25.045
OFFICE, THOSE OF US WHO FIND 
OURSELVES UP FOR RE-ELECTION ALL

04:54:25.264 --> 04:54:28.986
THE TIME AS A CANDIDATE, I THINK
WE HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD, NO, 

04:54:29.235 --> 04:54:31.734
MA'AM IMMUNITY FROM ASKING THESE
TYPE OF QUESTIONS AND THE LAST 

04:54:33.627 --> 04:54:37.373
THING BEFORE I YIELD MY TIME. 
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. THE 

04:54:37.987 --> 04:54:40.505
LANGUAGE IS SPECIFIC. 
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS UNDER 

04:54:40.735 --> 04:54:44.904
ASSISTANCE TO THE UKRAINE, IT 
HAS TO BE CERTIFIED. AND WHAT 

04:54:45.207 --> 04:54:49.796
HAS TO BE CERTIFIED? QUOTE, FOR 
THE PURPOSES OF DECREASING 

04:54:52.844 --> 04:54:54.844
CORRUPTION. ARE YOU SURPRISED 
THAT THERE WOULD BE QUESTIONS 

04:54:55.026 --> 04:54:59.306
ABOUT CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE AND 
THAT IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH 

04:54:59.518 --> 04:55:02.434
WITHHOLDING THAT IS ACTUALLY 
REQUIRED BY LAW THAT IT BE 

04:55:02.714 --> 04:55:05.444
WITHHELD IF THEY CAN'T CERTIFY 
THAT CORRUPTION HAS BEEN 

04:55:07.847 --> 04:55:10.364
ELIMINATED OR ADDRESSED? 
&gt;&gt; THE CERTIFICATION IN THAT 

04:55:10.584 --> 04:55:14.524
CASE IS DONE BY THE SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE UPON ADVICE OF HIS STAFF

04:55:14.814 --> 04:55:18.714
IN CONSULTATION WITH THE INNER 
AGENCY COMMUNITY. WE WERE FULLY 

04:55:18.944 --> 04:55:21.626
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT CONDITION AND
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAD 

04:55:22.304 --> 04:55:24.474
ALREADY CERTIFIED THAT THAT 
CONDITION ALITY HAD BEEN MET. 

04:55:24.726 --> 04:55:28.304
&gt;&gt; SO WE AGREE WE SHOULD WITHHOD
FUNDS IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OF 

04:55:28.634 --> 04:55:30.432
CORRUPTION THAT HAVE NOT BEEN 
ADDRESSED. 

04:55:30.433 --> 04:55:33.353
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO YIELD THE REST 
OF MY TIME TO MR. JORDAN. 

04:55:33.354 --> 04:55:35.553
&gt;&gt; 1 SECONDS. ARE YOU GOING TO 
LET THAT GO. 

04:55:35.554 --> 04:55:38.586
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; IN THAT CASE I WILL YIELD 

04:55:39.571 --> 04:55:40.882
BACK. THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; MR. QUICKLY. 

04:55:40.883 --> 04:55:43.734
&gt;&gt; SO THAT CERTIFICATION, THAT 
TOOK PLACE IN MAY, IS THAT 

04:55:43.944 --> 04:55:46.484
CORRECT, MR. KENT? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS 

04:55:46.694 --> 04:55:51.144
CERTIFIED BY MAY. I WOULD DEAF 
TO MY COLLEAGUE LORI COOPER WHO 

04:55:51.614 --> 04:55:53.984
HAS TESTIFIED. 
&gt;&gt; IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE BY MAY 

04:55:54.215 --> 04:55:56.763
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS VISITING IN 
MAY, I WAS ASKED BY LAURA TO 

04:55:56.986 --> 04:56:00.116
RAISE A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT 
WOULD MEET THE CONDITION ALITY. 

04:56:00.344 --> 04:56:03.032
&gt;&gt; BUT THE D.O.D. DID SAY THEY 
MET THE CERTIFICATION? 

04:56:03.033 --> 04:56:06.793
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. I THINK IT MAY HAVE
BEEN IN THE JULY TIME FRAME. 

04:56:07.024 --> 04:56:08.490
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

04:56:08.491 --> 04:56:11.743
&gt;&gt; IT IS INTERESTING AND CURIOUS
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEARSAY

04:56:11.986 --> 04:56:14.644
EVIDENCE. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO
ME THAT HE HAS -- THE COMMITTEE 

04:56:15.343 --> 04:56:18.523
HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET AS MUCH 
INFORMATION HE HAD GIVEN THE 

04:56:18.750 --> 04:56:20.750
INSTRUCTION. YOU GENTLEMEN WERE 
BOTH ASKED BY THE STATE 

04:56:20.867 --> 04:56:25.443
DEPARTMENT NOT TO APPEAR FOR 
YOUR DEPOSITIONS, IS THAT 

04:56:25.674 --> 04:56:27.876
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; WE BOTH RECEIVED -- I 

04:56:28.424 --> 04:56:33.273
RECEIVED INITIALLY A LETTER 
DIRECTING ME NOT TO APPEAR, AND 

04:56:33.654 --> 04:56:38.004
ONCE THE COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED A 
SUBPOENA, I WAS UNDER LEGAL 

04:56:38.214 --> 04:56:41.363
OBLIGATION TO HERE AND I AM HERE
TODAY UNDER SUBPOENA. 

04:56:41.364 --> 04:56:47.203
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR, WERE YOU ALSO 
ASKED NOT TO BE PART OF THE 

04:56:47.427 --> 04:56:49.706
DEPOSITION? 
&gt;&gt; MR. QUICKLY, I WAS TOLD -- 

04:56:49.933 --> 04:56:53.504
QUIGLEY, I WAS TOLD BY THE STATE
DEPARTMENT DON'T APPEAR UNDER 

04:56:54.193 --> 04:56:56.823
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT WAS IN
THE LETTER TO ME. AND WHEN I GOT

04:56:57.343 --> 04:57:02.578
THE SUBPOENA EXACTLY AS MR. KENT
SAID, THAT WAS DIFFERENT 

04:57:03.503 --> 04:57:06.423
CIRCUMSTANCES AND OBEYING A 
LEGAL SUBPOENA, SO I AM HERE FOR

04:57:07.093 --> 04:57:09.093
THAT REASON. 
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY ST BUT WE'RE NOT 

04:57:09.273 --> 04:57:14.153
ABLE TO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM 
CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY, MORE 

04:57:14.379 --> 04:57:16.813
THAN A DOZEN WITNESSES, WHO I 
SUSPECT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 

04:57:17.104 --> 04:57:20.857
WITH HEARSAY, YOU'D HAVE A LOT 
MORE DIRECT TESTIMONY AND DIRECT

04:57:21.073 --> 04:57:24.757
EVIDENCE IF YOU WEREN'T BLOCKING
THAT ABILITY. YOU'D HAVE A LOT 

04:57:25.023 --> 04:57:27.886
MORE DOCUMENTS, DOCUMENTS THAT 
YOU REFERRED TO WITH MY 

04:57:28.576 --> 04:57:31.684
COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION THAT HAD 
NOT YET BEEN TUBBED OVER BY A 

04:57:31.983 --> 04:57:37.484
STATE OR ANY OTHER AGENCY, IS 
THAT CORRECT, TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE,

04:57:37.704 --> 04:57:39.704
GENTLEMEN? 
&gt;&gt; WE'RE BOTH HERE UNDER 

04:57:39.753 --> 04:57:42.024
SUBPOENA. I DON'T THINK EITHER 
OF SUS GOING TO COMMENT WHY 

04:57:42.564 --> 04:57:45.749
OTHERS HAVE NOT SHOWN UP. 
&gt;&gt; HAVE ANY OF THE DOCUMENTS YOU

04:57:46.049 --> 04:57:49.323
TURNED OTHER, TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
VBEEN TURNED OVER TO THE 

04:57:50.083 --> 04:57:50.756
COMMITTEE? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

04:57:50.757 --> 04:57:54.023
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT, FOLLOWING THE JULY 
25th CALL AND THROUGH THE FIRST 

04:57:54.260 --> 04:57:58.113
TWO WEEKS OF AUGUST, WERE YOU 
INVOLVED IN ANY EFFORTS TO 

04:57:58.693 --> 04:58:01.046
ARRANGE FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY 
TO MAKE A STATEMENT ANNOUNCING 

04:58:02.073 --> 04:58:04.493
THE TWO INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TALKED ABOUT

04:58:05.123 --> 04:58:08.183
IN THE JULY 25th CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT, AND I WOULD NEVER 

04:58:08.392 --> 04:58:10.392
HAVE PARTICIPATED IN AN 
ARRANGEMENT TO HAVE THEM 

04:58:10.483 --> 04:58:12.417
ANNOUNCING INVESTIGATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, WERE YOU 

04:58:12.418 --> 04:58:15.102
INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH EVIDENT ? 
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 

04:58:15.103 --> 04:58:18.268
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOW YOU A TEXT OF 
THE EXCHANGE. THIS ONE IS 

04:58:18.984 --> 04:58:24.073
BETWEEN THE AMBASSADOR VOLKER, 
AND THE AIM AIDE THAT ZELENSKYY 

04:58:24.793 --> 04:58:28.623
AND VOLKER TEXTED BEFORE THE 
JULY 25th CALL. YOU WERE 

04:58:28.833 --> 04:58:32.634
INVOLVED IN IT SO I'LL READ IT. 
THE FIRST TEXT IS FROM AUGUST 

04:58:33.263 --> 04:58:37.446
10th, VOLKER, I AGREE WITH YOUR 
APPROACH. PRESS CAN GO FORWARD 

04:58:37.963 --> 04:58:40.898
CAN IT. AND THEN AT 5:42, THE 
RESPOND, ONCE WE HAVE A DATE, 

04:58:41.113 --> 04:58:45.488
WE'LL CALL FOR A PRESS BRIEFING 
ANNOUNCING UPCOMING VISIT, AN 

04:58:46.233 --> 04:58:50.087
VISION FOR U.S.-UKRAINE 
RELATIONSHIP, INCLUDING, AMONG 

04:58:51.053 --> 04:58:53.713
OTHER THICKS, BURISMA AND 
ELECTION MEDDLING 

04:58:53.943 --> 04:58:55.968
INVESTIGATIONS. ONCE WE HAVE A 
DATE, THEY WILL ANNOUNCE THE 

04:58:56.183 --> 04:58:59.023
INVESTIGATIONS IN BURISMA AND 
ELECTION MEDDLING. MR. KENT, ARE

04:58:59.243 --> 04:59:01.356
THESE THE SAME TWO 
INVESTIGATIONS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:59:01.983 --> 04:59:06.026
ASKED THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT TO
INITIATE IN THE JULY 25th 

04:59:06.489 --> 04:59:09.413
MEETING, 25th CALL? 
&gt;&gt; THOSE APPEAR TO BE THE SAME 

04:59:09.644 --> 04:59:13.073
ISSUES MENTIONED IN THE CALL AS 
WELL AS THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN IN 

04:59:13.315 --> 04:59:17.476
MARCH LED BY RUDY GIULIANI. 
&gt;&gt; AS THE DAY-TO-DAY STATE 

04:59:17.814 --> 04:59:21.413
DEPARTMENT PERSON ON UKRAINE 
POLICY, WERE YOU AWARE OF THIS 

04:59:21.883 --> 04:59:25.147
PRESIDENT TO PERSUADE MR. 
ZELENSKYY TO ISSUE A STATEMENT 

04:59:25.377 --> 04:59:27.132
IN ORDER TO GET A WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING? 

04:59:27.133 --> 04:59:30.825
&gt;&gt; WHEN THIS EXCHANGE HAPPENED 
ON AUGUST 10th, I WAS NOT. 

04:59:30.826 --> 04:59:32.343
&gt;&gt; WHEN DID YOU LEARN ABOUT 
THEM? 

04:59:32.344 --> 04:59:35.697
&gt;&gt; AS AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
REFERENCED THEM EARLIER IN THE 

04:59:36.253 --> 04:59:40.169
TESTIMONY, ANSWERING HE HEARD ON
AUGUST 16th. HE THEN CALLED ME 

04:59:40.386 --> 04:59:43.603
AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION. AT 
THAT POINT I MEMORIALIZED MY 

04:59:43.904 --> 04:59:47.903
CONCERNS IN A NOTE TO THE FILE. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, AS THE 

04:59:48.113 --> 04:59:50.613
POINT PERSON ON THE GROUND IN 
UKRAINE, WERE YOU AWARE OF THIS 

04:59:50.838 --> 04:59:53.563
EFFORT TO GET UKRAINE TO ISSUE 
THIS WRITTEN STATEMENT IN EARLY 

04:59:53.784 --> 04:59:55.142
AUGUST? 
&gt;&gt; NOT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT, 

04:59:55.143 --> 04:59:56.952
NO, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; SO THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION 

04:59:56.953 --> 05:00:00.123
ABOUT A PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT 
THE TWO INVESTIGATIONS PRESIDENT

05:00:00.656 --> 05:00:04.863
TRUMP WANTED WAS DONE IN WHAT 
YOU HAVE DESCRIBED AS ARN 

05:00:05.936 --> 05:00:08.483
IRREGULAR CHANNEL INVOLVING 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND VOLKER 

05:00:08.707 --> 05:00:12.163
AND THE TASK TO TAKE ON UKRAINE 
POLICY BY THE PRESIDENT, ISN'T 

05:00:12.485 --> 05:00:15.318
THAT CORRECT, MR. KENT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE MY 

05:00:16.106 --> 05:00:18.384
UNDERSTANDING. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR? 

05:00:18.385 --> 05:00:20.385
&gt;&gt; 

05:00:21.853 --> 05:00:24.133
THE SAME. 
&gt;&gt; AND HEARSAY, I THINK THE 

05:00:24.363 --> 05:00:27.568
AMERICAN PEOPLE NEEDS A REMINDER
THAT COUNTLESS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

05:00:27.803 --> 05:00:33.293
CONVICTED ON HEARSAY BECAUSE THE
COURTS HAVE ROUTINELY ALLOWED 

05:00:33.863 --> 05:00:39.103
AND CREATED METED EXCEPTIONS TO 
HEARSAY. HEARSAY CAN BE MUCH 

05:00:39.313 --> 05:00:42.868
BETTER EVIDENCE THAN DIRECT AS 
WE HAVE LEARNED IN PAINFUL 

05:00:43.073 --> 05:00:45.242
INSTANCES, AND CERTAINLY VALID 
IN THIS INSTANCE. 

05:00:45.243 --> 05:00:47.573
&gt;&gt; AND ANYONE OF THOSE 
EXCEPTIONS WOULD APPLY TO THIS 

05:00:47.878 --> 05:00:49.878
TESTIMONY. 
&gt;&gt; AND THE TIME -- THIS IS NOT 

05:00:50.006 --> 05:00:52.006
THE 

05:00:54.803 --> 05:01:00.389
TIME FOR COLLOQUY. 
&gt;&gt; THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT FACTS 

05:01:00.755 --> 05:01:04.837
ARE THE FOLLOWING. NUMBER ONE, 
UKRAINE RECEIVED THE AID. NUMBER

05:01:05.185 --> 05:01:08.603
TWO, THERE WAS, IN FACT, NO 
INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN. AND 

05:01:08.813 --> 05:01:13.063
MR. KENT AND AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, 
YOU BOTH SPOKE ELOQUENTLY AND 

05:01:13.303 --> 05:01:16.043
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE NEED TO 
SUPPORT UKRAINE TO COUNTER 

05:01:16.326 --> 05:01:19.183
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION, PARTICULARLY
DURING THIS VERY CRITICAL TIME. 

05:01:19.403 --> 05:01:22.643
I AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT 
ASSESSMENT. AND ISN'T 

05:01:22.873 --> 05:01:24.973
CONSTITUENT CASE THAT THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION HAS, INDEED, 

05:01:25.196 --> 05:01:28.753
PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AID TO 
UKRAINE IN THE FORM OF DEFENSIVE

05:01:28.983 --> 05:01:31.033
LETHAL AID, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:01:31.034 --> 05:01:34.993
&gt;&gt; AND THAT IS MORE SO THAN THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, CORRECT? 

05:01:35.226 --> 05:01:38.232
&gt;&gt; THE -- 
&gt;&gt; DEFENSIVE LETHAL AID. 

05:01:38.233 --> 05:01:40.393
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; AND IN THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE 

05:01:40.613 --> 05:01:47.133
PRESIDENT'S JULY 25th CALL WITH 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT 

05:01:47.463 --> 05:01:52.323
ZELENSKYY TELLS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THEY ARE READY TO BUY MORE 

05:01:52.543 --> 05:01:53.632
JAVELINS. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:01:53.633 --> 05:01:57.256
&gt;&gt; AND THOSE JAVELINS WERE NOT 
MADE AVAILABLE TO UKRAINE UNDER 

05:01:58.086 --> 05:02:01.413
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION? THE 
JAVELINS WERE NOT MADE 

05:02:01.663 --> 05:02:03.765
AVAILABLE? 
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOT. 

05:02:03.766 --> 05:02:05.766
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND SHIFTING GEARS TO 

05:02:05.843 --> 05:02:09.783
CORRUPTION, ONE OF THE THEMES 
HERE TODAY IS THAT OF ROOTING 

05:02:10.023 --> 05:02:12.413
OUT CORRUPTION, WHICH IS AN 
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE PRESIDENT

05:02:12.693 --> 05:02:17.376
AS WE PROVIDE STACKS PAYER 
FUNDED AID TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

05:02:17.613 --> 05:02:23.493
MR. KENT, YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE
UKRAINE AS HAVING LONG STANDING 

05:02:23.743 --> 05:02:25.524
CORRUPTION ISSUES, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

05:02:25.525 --> 05:02:28.183
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED, QUOTE, I WOULD
SAY THAT CORRUPTION IS PART OF 

05:02:28.463 --> 05:02:31.322
THE REASON WHY UKRAINIANS CAME 
OUT TO THE STREETS IN BOTH 2004 

05:02:31.583 --> 05:02:34.293
WHEN SOMEBODY TRIED TO STEAL THE
ELECTION AND AGAIN IN 2014 

05:02:35.525 --> 05:02:39.108
BECAUSE OF A CORRUPTION 
PRORUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH 

05:02:40.523 --> 05:02:42.843
EVENTUALLY COLLAPSED. UKRAINIANS
DECIDED ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH. IS 

05:02:43.121 --> 05:02:45.089
THAT YOUR TESTIMONY? 
&gt;&gt; IT REMAINS SO. 

05:02:45.090 --> 05:02:48.002
&gt;&gt; AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU 
FIRST CAME TO LEARN ABOUT 

05:02:48.253 --> 05:02:51.612
BURISMA IN 2015 WHEN YOU WERE 
THE SENIOR ANTI-CORRUPTION 

05:02:52.623 --> 05:02:55.448
COORDINATOR, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. DETAILS OF THE 

05:02:55.682 --> 05:02:57.682
EMBASSY IN KEVE 

05:03:01.323 --> 05:03:04.444
AS THE ACTING INTEREST. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU SAID IT WAS IN THE 

05:03:04.972 --> 05:03:07.543
U.S. INTEREST, QUOTE, AND THIS 
IS FROM YOUR DEPOSITION, WE HAD 

05:03:07.764 --> 05:03:11.012
MADE A COMMIT TOM THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT IN 2014 TO TRY TO 

05:03:11.473 --> 05:03:14.842
RECOVER AN ESTIMATED TENS OF 
BILLIONS OF STOLEN ASSETS OUT OF

05:03:15.653 --> 05:03:18.976
THE COUNTRY. IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A -- STOLEN ASSETS 

05:03:19.203 --> 05:03:23.223
THAT WERE IN THE NAME OF THE 
OWNER BURISMA. AND HE WAS THE 

05:03:23.483 --> 05:03:25.585
ONE WHO WE BELIEVE WHO HAD 
STOLEN THE MONEY. 

05:03:25.586 --> 05:03:29.595
&gt;&gt; SO THE FIRST CASE, THIS WAS 
THE FIRST CASE THAT THE U.S. THE

05:03:29.825 --> 05:03:32.942
U.K. AND THE UKRAINE 
INVESTIGATORS WORKED ON WAS 

05:03:33.182 --> 05:03:36.125
AGAINST THE OWNER OF BURISMA? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:03:36.126 --> 05:03:38.051
&gt;&gt; AND THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION? 

05:03:38.052 --> 05:03:40.302
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; SO FOR THE MILLIONS OF 

05:03:40.594 --> 05:03:44.033
AMERICANS VIEWING, THE FIRST 
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE OWNER 

05:03:44.272 --> 05:03:46.724
OF BURISMA WAS UNDER PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION? 

05:03:46.725 --> 05:03:50.403
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED ALSO, QUOTE, WE

05:03:50.636 --> 05:03:53.263
SPENT ROUGHLY HALF A MILLION 
DOLLARS OF STATE DEPARTMENT 

05:03:53.634 --> 05:03:56.113
MONEY IN SUPPORT OF THE FBI AND 
THIS INVESTIGATION TO BUILD 

05:03:56.362 --> 05:03:59.482
CAPACITY AND TRACK DOWN STOLEN 
ASSETS, END QUOTE. IS THAT 

05:03:59.713 --> 05:04:01.485
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. IT WAS 

05:04:01.486 --> 05:04:04.603
LAUNCHED IN MAY 2014 BY THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE U.S. AND

05:04:04.872 --> 05:04:07.412
THE U.K. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
WORLD BANK. 

05:04:07.413 --> 05:04:10.802
&gt;&gt; AND, IN FACT, BY 2016 YOU 
WERE SO CONCERNED ABOUT 

05:04:11.104 --> 05:04:14.352
CORRUPTION QUESTIONS RELATED TO 
BURISMA THAT WHEN THERE WAS AN 

05:04:14.842 --> 05:04:19.393
EFFORT BY BURISMA TO SPONSOR 
ABESSAY CONTEST WITH USA, YOU 

05:04:19.635 --> 05:04:21.994
ASKED THEM TO STOP IT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:04:21.995 --> 05:04:25.833
&gt;&gt; AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT IT WAS
BECAUSE, QUOTE, BURISMA HAD A 

05:04:26.052 --> 05:04:29.073
POOR REPUTATION IN THE BUSINESS,
AND THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

05:04:29.302 --> 05:04:31.393
APPROPRIATE FOR THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT TO BE CO-SPONSORING 

05:04:31.622 --> 05:04:36.367
SOMETHING WITH A COMPANY THAT 
HAD A BAD REPUTATION. CORRECT? 

05:04:36.612 --> 05:04:38.612
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE ALSO AWARE, AND YOU 

05:04:38.673 --> 05:04:41.485
TESTIFIED TODAY THAT HUNTER 
BIDEN SERVED ON THE BOARD OF 

05:04:42.182 --> 05:04:42.891
BURISMA. 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

05:04:42.892 --> 05:04:45.752
&gt;&gt; AND YOU ALSO TESTIFIED THAT 
YOU WERE, INDEED, CONCERNED 

05:04:45.995 --> 05:04:47.863
ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT
OF INTEREST. 

05:04:47.864 --> 05:04:51.342
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND BROADLY, THIS IS VERY 

05:04:51.637 --> 05:04:55.025
IMPORTANT, YOU TESTIFY IN YOUR 
DEPOSITION THAT WHEN THE STATE 

05:04:55.572 --> 05:04:57.742
DEPARTMENT EVALUATES FOREIGN 
ASSISTANCE, IT IS APPROPRIATE 

05:04:57.983 --> 05:05:01.241
FOR THEM TO LOOK AT LEVELS OF 
CORRUPTION IN COUNTRIES. 

05:05:01.242 --> 05:05:03.572
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND LASTLY, YOU ALSO 

05:05:03.802 --> 05:05:07.272
TESTIFIED THAT, AND THIS IS YOUR
QUOTE, ISSUES OF CORRUPTION HAVE

05:05:07.512 --> 05:05:10.843
BEEN PART OF HIGH-LEVEL DIALOGUE
BETWEEN U.S. LEADERS AND 

05:05:11.123 --> 05:05:13.963
UKRAINIAN LEADERS REGARDLESS OF 
WHO IS THE U.S. LEADER AND WHO 

05:05:14.203 --> 05:05:18.309
IS THE UKRAINIAN LEADER, AND 
THAT IS A NORMAL ISSUE OF 

05:05:18.573 --> 05:05:20.943
DIPLOMATIC DISCUSSION AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL, END QUOTE, IS 

05:05:21.582 --> 05:05:23.041
THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:05:23.042 --> 05:05:26.612
&gt;&gt; I WILL YIELD 30 SECONDS. I 
WILL CREED BACK AFTER THAT. 

05:05:26.875 --> 05:05:31.201
THANK YOU. -- YIELD BACK AFTER 
THAT. THANK YOU. 

05:05:31.202 --> 05:05:34.323
&gt;&gt; BOTH O. YOU HAVE TESTIFIED 
THAT YOU ARE -- BOTH OF YOU HAVE

05:05:34.548 --> 05:05:36.972
TESTIFIED THAT YOU ARE NOT 
DIRECT WITNESS WHOSE HAVE SPOKEN

05:05:37.202 --> 05:05:39.665
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOWEVER, 
YOU ARE WITNESSES TO A SHAKE 

05:05:39.895 --> 05:05:43.572
DOWN SCHEME THAT OVERS 
PARTICIPATED IN WHO SPOKE WITH 

05:05:44.572 --> 05:05:47.976
PRESIDENT TRUMP. HOWEVER, 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON AND MICK 

05:05:48.255 --> 05:05:50.922
MULVANEY BOTH SPOKE DIRECTLY TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND UNLIKE YOU, 

05:05:51.202 --> 05:05:55.642
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO HONOR OUR 
REQUEST TO BE A PART OF THESE 

05:05:55.943 --> 05:05:59.704
PROCEEDINGS. NONETHELESS, WE DO 
KNOW HOW ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF 

05:05:59.945 --> 05:06:03.182
MICK MULVANEY FEELS ABOUT AID 
BECAUSE ON OCTOBER 1 AT A PRESS 

05:06:03.412 --> 05:06:06.215
CONFERENCE HE DISCUSSED THE HOD 
ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR 

05:06:06.772 --> 05:06:09.373
UKRAINE. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, I'D 
LIKE YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE 

05:06:09.613 --> 05:06:11.613
SAID. 

05:06:18.902 --> 05:06:22.833
I WILL READ IT FOR YOU. IT IS IN
RESPONSE TO A QUESTION. TO BE 

05:06:23.052 --> 05:06:27.225
CLEAR, WHAT YOU HAVE JUST 
DESCRIBED AS A QUID PRO QUO. 

05:06:27.455 --> 05:06:30.704
MONEY WILL NOT FLOW INTO THE 
DEMOCRATIC SERBER, AND IN 

05:06:30.992 --> 05:06:34.852
RESPONSE THAT THAT QUESTION, MR.
MULL VAUGHNY SAID LTAYLOR, WE DO

05:06:35.077 --> 05:06:39.996
THAT ALL THE TIME WITH FOREIGN 
POLICY. MY QUESTION, AMBASSADOR 

05:06:40.353 --> 05:06:42.353
TAYLOR, THE PRESIDENT 
CONDITIONING SECURITY ASIS TABS 

05:06:42.592 --> 05:06:46.352
ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS 
POLITICAL OPPONENT PRIOR TO THIS

05:06:46.582 --> 05:06:49.196
ADMINISTRATION, IS THAT 
SOMETHING WE WOULD DO ALL THE 

05:06:49.438 --> 05:06:51.252
TIME? 
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 

05:06:51.253 --> 05:06:54.853
&gt;&gt; WHY NOT? 
&gt;&gt; WE CONDITION ASSISTANCE 

05:06:56.575 --> 05:07:01.573
OBJECT ISSUES THAT WILL IMPROVE 
OUR FOREIGN POLICY, SERVE OUR 

05:07:02.122 --> 05:07:06.522
FOREIGN POLICY, USE -- INSURE 
THAT TAXPAYERS' MONEY IS WELL 

05:07:06.802 --> 05:07:10.216
SPENT. THOSE ARE -- AND THOSE 
CONDITIONS ARE EITHER COMING 

05:07:10.692 --> 05:07:16.622
FROM THE CONGRESS OR FROM POLICY
DECISIONS COMING FROM AUTHORITY 

05:07:16.852 --> 05:07:19.732
CONGRESS HAS GIVEN US TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY 

05:07:19.982 --> 05:07:24.855
IS WELL SPENT OR THAT THE 
RECEIVING COUNTRY TAKES THE 

05:07:25.092 --> 05:07:27.431
ACTIONS IN OUR NATIONAL 
INTEREST. 

05:07:27.432 --> 05:07:30.292
&gt;&gt; YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR TEXT 
MESSAGE EXCHANGES THAT ENGAGING 

05:07:30.512 --> 05:07:36.902
IN A SCHEME LIKE THIS IS, QUOTE,
CRAZY. CAN WE ALSO AGREE THAT IT

05:07:40.112 --> 05:07:42.031
IS JUST WRONG? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

05:07:42.032 --> 05:07:49.245
&gt;&gt; WHY IS IT WRONG? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, OUR OWNING -- HODDING 

05:07:49.802 --> 05:07:53.362
UP OF SECURITY ASSISTANCE THAT 
WOULD GO TO A COUNTRY THAT IS 

05:07:53.605 --> 05:08:00.242
FIGHTING AGGRESSION FROM RUSSIA 
FOR NO GOOD POLICY REASON, NO 

05:08:00.757 --> 05:08:04.792
GOOD SUBSTANTIVE REASON, NO GOOD
NATIONAL SECURITY REASON, IS 

05:08:05.082 --> 05:08:07.082
WRONG. 
&gt;&gt; MR. MULVANEY, IN THE SAME 

05:08:07.162 --> 05:08:09.922
NEWS CONFERENCE SAID, QUOTE, IF 
YOU READ THE NEWS REPORTS AND 

05:08:10.157 --> 05:08:14.517
YOU BELIEVE THEM, WHAT MCKINLEY 
SAID YESTERDAY, WELL, MCKINLEY 

05:08:14.765 --> 05:08:17.252
SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE WAS 
REALLY UPSET WITH THE POLITICAL 

05:08:17.532 --> 05:08:20.382
INFLUENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY 
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS HE 

05:08:20.646 --> 05:08:23.677
WAS SO UPSET ABOUT THIS. AND I 
HAVE NEWS FOR EVERYBODY, GET 

05:08:24.392 --> 05:08:29.662
OVER IT! THERE'S GOING TO BE 
POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN FOREIGN 

05:08:29.947 --> 05:08:35.592
POLICY. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, 
SHOULD WE GET OVER IT? 

05:08:35.825 --> 05:08:42.275
&gt;&gt; IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
POLITICAL INFLUENCE MEANING 

05:08:42.567 --> 05:08:50.412
ATTEMPTS TO GET INFORMATION THAT
IS SOLELY USEFUL FOR POLITICAL 

05:08:50.660 --> 05:08:53.442
CAMPAIGNS, THAT IS WHAT HE IS 
TALKING ABOUT, WE SHOULD NOT GET

05:08:53.682 --> 05:08:56.042
USED TO THAT. 
&gt;&gt; FINALLY MANY MULVANEY SAID I 

05:08:56.292 --> 05:08:59.542
WAS INVOLVED WITH THE PROCESS BY
WHICH 2 MONEY WAS HELD UP 

05:09:00.262 --> 05:09:02.522
TEMPORARILY, OKAY. THREE ISSUES 
FOR THAT. THE CORRUPTION OF THE 

05:09:02.753 --> 05:09:06.865
COUNTRY, WHETHER OR NOT THE 
COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN THE 

05:09:07.264 --> 05:09:09.902
SUPPORT OF UKRAINE AND WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY WERE COOPERATING IN 

05:09:10.202 --> 05:09:12.572
AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION WITH 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT 

05:09:12.822 --> 05:09:15.745
IS COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE. MR. 
KENT, WERE YOU AWARE OF ANY 

05:09:15.975 --> 05:09:18.735
FORMAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
REQUESTS MADE TO THE UKRAINIANS?

05:09:18.972 --> 05:09:22.662
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT ACARE THAT THERE WAS
ANY FORMAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

05:09:22.892 --> 05:09:25.661
REQUEST IN THAT MATTER,. 
&gt;&gt; 

05:09:25.662 --> 05:09:27.441
&gt;&gt; WAS MR. MULVANEY'S STATEMENT 
FALSE? 

05:09:27.442 --> 05:09:31.352
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU'D REFER THAT YES 
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

05:09:31.712 --> 05:09:33.872
SINCE I DON'T HAVE FULL 
KNOWLEDGE OF WHATEVER THEY MAY 

05:09:34.112 --> 05:09:36.532
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. 
&gt;&gt; JUST ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE

05:09:36.752 --> 05:09:39.152
TWO OF YOU SAT DOWN TO TESTIFY 
TODAY, THE PRESIDENT TWEETED 

05:09:39.397 --> 05:09:42.842
MULTIPLE TIMES ABOUT THIS 
HEARING AND HE PUT IN ALL CAPS 

05:09:43.535 --> 05:09:46.641
NEVER FRUMPERS. MR. KENT, ARE 
YOU A NEVER TRUMPER? 

05:09:46.642 --> 05:09:50.242
&gt;&gt; I AM A CAREER NONPROFESSIONAL
WHO SERVES WHATEVER PRESIDENT IS

05:09:50.472 --> 05:09:53.303
DULY ELECTED AND CARRIES OUT THE
FOREIGN POLICIES OF THAT 

05:09:53.542 --> 05:09:56.127
PRESIDENT AND THE UNITED STATES 
AND I HAVE DONE THAT FOR 27 

05:09:56.362 --> 05:09:58.692
YEARS FOR THREE REPUBLICAN 
PRESIDENTS AND TWO DEMOCRAT 

05:09:58.992 --> 05:10:00.992
PRESIDENTS. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, ARE YOU A 

05:10:01.052 --> 05:10:02.321
NEVER TRUMPER? 
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 

05:10:02.322 --> 05:10:04.682
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, FINALLY 
YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT ON 

05:10:05.012 --> 05:10:08.262
PAGE 19, MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE
TWO UKRAINIAN STORIES TODAY, THE

05:10:08.512 --> 05:10:10.985
FIRST IS THE ONE WE ARE 
DISCUSSING THIS MORNING AND THAT

05:10:11.202 --> 05:10:15.432
YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING FOR THE 
PAST TWO WEEKS. IT IS A 

05:10:16.332 --> 05:10:18.858
RANKERROUS STORY ABOUT 
WHISTLEBLOWERS LGIULIANI, SIDE 

05:10:19.094 --> 05:10:22.222
CHANNELS, QUID PRO QUOS, 
CORRUPTION AND INTERFERENCE IN 

05:10:22.852 --> 05:10:26.992
ELECTIONS. IN THIS STORY UKRAINE
IS MERELY AN OBJECT. IS IT ALSO 

05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:29.562
TRUE THAT IN THIS STORY IT IS 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF 

05:10:33.463 --> 05:10:42.832
THE UNITED STATES? 
&gt;&gt; I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT I 

05:10:43.112 --> 05:10:47.486
KNOW. AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU 
WHAT I HEARD. AND WHAT I SAID. 

05:10:47.722 --> 05:10:50.281
AND IN THAT REGARD, I CAN'T 
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. 

05:10:50.282 --> 05:10:52.582
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU HAVE TESTIFIED 
TODAY ALSO INVOLVES THE 

05:10:52.802 --> 05:10:55.111
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
IS THAT CORRECT? 

05:10:55.112 --> 05:10:57.813
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES WAS ON THE TELEPHONE CALL

05:10:58.042 --> 05:11:03.051
ON THE 25th OF JULY, YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK. 

05:11:03.052 --> 05:11:05.552
&gt;&gt; SIR? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 

05:11:05.784 --> 05:11:10.583
GENTLEMEN, I APPRECIATE YOUR 
DECADE OF SERVICE AS FABLED 

05:11:10.833 --> 05:11:15.152
FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER AND 
AMBASSADOR SAYS BECAUSE WE HAVE 

05:11:15.392 --> 05:11:19.772
WING TIPS ON THE GROUND MEANING 
DIPLOMATS THAT PREVENTS US FROM 

05:11:20.016 --> 05:11:22.782
HAVING BOOTS ON THE GROUND, 
MILITARY, YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT 

05:11:23.072 --> 05:11:27.392
ROLE IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 
AND THANK YOU AND YOUR 

05:11:27.682 --> 05:11:30.502
COLLEAGUES. MR. TAYLOR, MY FIRST
QUESTIONS ARE TO YOU AND THESE 

05:11:30.752 --> 05:11:33.491
ARE QUESTIONS THAT ON YEARS 
PRIOR TO YOUR TIME IN THE 

05:11:33.722 --> 05:11:37.271
UKRAINE, BUT I AM PRETTY SURE 
YOU CAN ANSWER THEM. DID THE 

05:11:37.514 --> 05:11:43.100
UKRAINIANS GET MILITARY -- GET 
AID IN F.Y.-17? 

05:11:43.101 --> 05:11:48.661
&gt;&gt; DID THEY GET ANY AID IN 
F.Y.-17. 

05:11:48.662 --> 05:11:50.662
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; AND THEY GOT SECURITY 

05:11:50.811 --> 05:11:52.521
ASSISTANCE AS WELL. 
&gt;&gt; THEY DID. 

05:11:52.522 --> 05:11:56.971
&gt;&gt; IF I SAID THAT NUMBER WAS IN 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE AROUND $270 

05:11:57.222 --> 05:11:59.461
MILLION, WOULD THAT PROBABLY BE 
ACCURATE? 

05:11:59.462 --> 05:12:01.496
&gt;&gt; CLOSE. 
&gt;&gt; IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT? 

05:12:01.497 --> 05:12:03.497
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; DID THEY 

05:12:06.086 --> 05:12:08.443
GET AID IN F.Y.-1? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:12:08.444 --> 05:12:10.152
&gt;&gt; AND INCLUDING SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE? 

05:12:10.153 --> 05:12:11.221
&gt;&gt; INCLUDING SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE. 

05:12:11.222 --> 05:12:13.484
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT 
THE JAVELINS, THE ANTI-TANK 

05:12:13.711 --> 05:12:16.955
MISSILES THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE
TO PURCHASE IN PREVIOUS 

05:12:17.256 --> 05:12:21.041
ADMINISTRATIONS. HAVE THEY 
GOTTEN SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN 

05:12:21.272 --> 05:12:22.203
F.Y.-19? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:12:22.204 --> 05:12:26.211
&gt;&gt; PRIOR TO THE $400 MILLION OR 
SO THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING 

05:12:26.441 --> 05:12:30.761
A LOT HERE TODAY? 
&gt;&gt; THEY GOT SOME PREVIOUS -- 

05:12:31.602 --> 05:12:33.602
SOME 

05:12:36.621 --> 05:12:39.971
PROBABLY F.Y.-118 ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; IT TAKES A WHILE. THERE WERE 

05:12:40.211 --> 05:12:43.665
TWO SHIPS THAT JUST ARRIVED IN 
THE PORT OF ODESSA, AND THAT WAS

05:12:44.382 --> 05:12:47.450
WITH THE MONEY. SO THERE IS A 
LAG OF A YEAR. 

05:12:47.451 --> 05:12:50.391
&gt;&gt; MIR POINT IS THAT WE HAVE 
BEEN SUPPORTING THE UKRAINIANS 

05:12:51.122 --> 05:12:54.112
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION TO -- 
IN ORDER TO HELP THEM KICK OUT 

05:12:54.401 --> 05:12:57.460
THE RUSSIANS WHO INVADED THEIR 
COUNTRY? 

05:12:57.461 --> 05:12:59.611
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; 100%. 

05:12:59.612 --> 05:13:01.931
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU 
EARLIER TESTIFIED THAT U 

05:13:02.174 --> 05:13:05.384
KLEINIAN OFFICIALS DID NOT 
BECOME AWARE OF POTENTIAL U.S. 

05:13:06.455 --> 05:13:10.511
ASSISTANCE BEING WITHHELD UNTIL 
AUGUST 29th, IS THAT ACCURATE? 

05:13:10.754 --> 05:13:13.153
&gt;&gt; THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. 
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU FIND IT SURPRISING 

05:13:13.685 --> 05:13:17.421
IF A UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL KNEW 
ABOUT THIS SOONER AND DID 

05:13:22.412 --> 05:13:26.751
NOT CONTACT YOU? 
&gt;&gt; I CAN ANSWER THAT IT WAS ONLY

05:13:26.992 --> 05:13:30.812
AFTER AUGUST 29th WHEN THE 
POLITICAL ARGUE THAT I GOT CAYS 

05:13:31.044 --> 05:13:35.000
FROM SEVERAL OF THE UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS. 

05:13:35.001 --> 05:13:38.704
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT, HAD YOU HAD ANY 
UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL CONTACTING 

05:13:39.047 --> 05:13:43.204
YOU CONCERNED ABOUT -- WHEN WAS 
THE FIRST TIME A UKRAINIAN 

05:13:43.454 --> 05:13:46.491
OFFICIAL CONTACTED YOU CONCERNED
ABOUT POTENTIAL WITHHODDING OF 

05:13:46.985 --> 05:13:50.444
U.S. AID? 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS AFTER THE ARTICLE IN 

05:13:50.683 --> 05:13:53.294
POLITICAL POLITICO CAME OUT IN 
THAT FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER. 

05:13:53.532 --> 05:13:55.532
&gt;&gt; SO AFTER THAT 

05:13:59.281 --> 05:14:02.291
AUGUST 29th CONVERSATION. THERE 
IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT RUDY 

05:14:02.521 --> 05:14:06.051
GIULIANI AND WHO HE WAS AND 
WASN'T MEETING. DO WE KNOW OR 

05:14:06.282 --> 05:14:10.473
HAVE AN IDEA OF THE UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS HE WAS MEETING WITH 

05:14:10.721 --> 05:14:13.791
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T, SIR. 

05:14:13.792 --> 05:14:18.904
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU HAD ANY UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS CALL YOU AFTER A 

05:14:19.141 --> 05:14:23.625
MEETING WITH RUDY GIULIANI 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE NATURE OF OR

05:14:23.841 --> 05:14:25.841
THE CONTEXT 

05:14:28.891 --> 05:14:33.654
OF THAT CONVERSATION? YES, THERE
WAS CONCERN EXPRESSED ABOUT HIS 

05:14:33.881 --> 05:14:35.083
INTERACTIONS WITH PROSECUTE GUY 
GHOUL. 

05:14:35.084 --> 05:14:37.725
&gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE THAT MEETING 
WAS SOMEWHERE IN LATE AUGUST, IS

05:14:37.962 --> 05:14:40.101
IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE MEETING AND THERE 

05:14:40.324 --> 05:14:42.324
WERE I THINK ALSO PHONE CALLS. 

05:14:46.702 --> 05:14:50.241
&gt;&gt; AND YOU ALL HAVE TALKED MANY 
TIMES THAT YOU ALL ARE STILL 

05:14:50.505 --> 05:14:52.516
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION IN 
THE UKRAINE, IS THAT CORRECT? 

05:14:52.741 --> 05:14:55.151
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; HAVE WE SEEN WHATEVER THIS 

05:14:55.621 --> 05:14:57.621
ANTI-CORRUPTION STATEMENT WE 
WANTED THE 

05:15:02.081 --> 05:15:05.331
UKRAINIANS TO MAKE? 
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE 

05:15:05.567 --> 05:15:08.581
STATEMENT THAT WAS BEING 
NEGOTIATED BETWEEN KURT L 

05:15:09.073 --> 05:15:12.750
VOLKER, GORDON SONDLAND AND 
ANDREIER MACK? 

05:15:12.751 --> 05:15:14.354
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT AN 

05:15:14.355 --> 05:15:16.200
ANTI-CORRUPTION STATEMENT. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE STATEMENT? 

05:15:16.201 --> 05:15:19.674
&gt;&gt; I THINK IF YOU GO BACK TO THE
BACK AND FORTH THAT WERE SHARED 

05:15:19.891 --> 05:15:22.901
BY KURT VOLKER, THEY SHARED A 
DRAFT WITH RUDY GIULIANI AND 

05:15:23.131 --> 05:15:27.751
RUDY GUY GHOUL SAID IT WOULD NOT
BE ACCEPTABLE IF IT DIDN'T 

05:15:29.221 --> 05:15:31.411
MENTION BIDEN, BURISMA, 2016. 
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT STATEMENT WAS NEVER 

05:15:31.696 --> 05:15:34.881
AGREED TO, NEVER ISSUED BY THE 
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS, IS THAT 

05:15:35.131 --> 05:15:37.020
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; NO STATEMENT OF THAT SORT WAS

05:15:37.021 --> 05:15:39.164
ISSUED, CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; AND HAVE YOU -- U.S. 

05:15:39.504 --> 05:15:42.271
BUSINESSES EVER CONTACTED YOU 
ALL CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION 

05:15:43.011 --> 05:15:45.220
WITHIN UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:15:45.221 --> 05:15:48.113
&gt;&gt; AS OF THIS YEAR EVEN? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:15:48.114 --> 05:15:51.821
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE CONCERN IS NOT 
JUST HOW UKRAINIAN BUSINESSES 

05:15:52.206 --> 05:15:54.206
RUN 

05:15:55.521 --> 05:16:00.164
BY THEN ARE BEING OPERATED IT IS
ALSO HOW THE UKRAINIAN 

05:16:00.391 --> 05:16:02.521
GOVERNMENT IS DEALING WITH 
AMERICAN BUSINESSES TRYING TO 

05:16:02.756 --> 05:16:05.036
OPERATE IN UKRAINE, IS THAT 
ACCURATE? 

05:16:05.037 --> 05:16:07.411
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR, 

05:16:07.911 --> 05:16:09.941
YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; I FEEDBACK TO THE TIME I DO 

05:16:10.204 --> 05:16:13.332
NOT HAVE, MR. CHAIR. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. MR. CASTRO. 

05:16:13.333 --> 05:16:15.781
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN, OH FOR 
YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND FOR 

05:16:16.021 --> 05:16:18.651
YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. 
LISTENING TO ALL OF THE 

05:16:18.921 --> 05:16:21.351
EVIDENCE, EVERYTHING I HAVE 
HEARD AND READ IN THIS 

05:16:21.701 --> 05:16:25.131
INVESTIGATION, IT SEEP TOES ME 
THAT THE -- SEEPS TO ME THE 

05:16:25.450 --> 05:16:28.270
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
EITHER COMMITTED EXTORTION OR 

05:16:28.511 --> 05:16:32.102
BRIBERY OF A FOREIGN OFFICIAL OR
ATTEMPTED EXTORTION AND BRIBERY 

05:16:32.344 --> 05:16:35.031
OF A FOREIGN OFFICIAL. WHEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT MR. 

05:16:35.255 --> 05:16:38.393
ZELENSKYY OBJECT THE PHONE ON 
JULY 25th, HE WAS TALKING TO A 

05:16:38.620 --> 05:16:43.661
DESPERATE MAN, WASN'T HE? 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WAS 

05:16:43.891 --> 05:16:46.260
DESPERATE TO PROTECT HIS COUNTRY
AND MAKE SURE HE HAD FOREIGN 

05:16:46.514 --> 05:16:50.881
ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITED 
STATES, IS THAT RIGHT? 

05:16:51.114 --> 05:16:54.336
&gt;&gt; MR. ZELENSKYY IS VERY 
INTERESTED IN U.S. SUPPORT, BOTH

05:16:54.684 --> 05:16:56.560
ASSISTANCE AND POLITICAL 
SUPPORT, YES, SIR. 

05:16:56.561 --> 05:17:00.333
&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF 
THE AID HAD GOATEN CUT OFF, 

05:17:00.561 --> 05:17:02.910
AMBASSADOR? WHAT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED TO MR. ZELENSKYY'S 

05:17:03.141 --> 05:17:06.570
CAREER AND WHAT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED TO UKRAINE? 

05:17:06.571 --> 05:17:12.170
&gt;&gt; THE ASSISTANCE HAD BEEN CUT 
OFF, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH 

05:17:12.740 --> 05:17:17.131
WEAKER IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
THE RUSSIANS. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

05:17:17.384 --> 05:17:20.303
MUCH WEAKER ON THE BATTLEFIELD. 
&gt;&gt; THE RUSSIANS MAY HAVE TAKEN 

05:17:20.543 --> 05:17:24.010
IT AS AN INVITATION TO ACTUALLY 
TAKE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST 

05:17:24.243 --> 05:17:27.660
UKRAINE, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THE RUSSIANS ALWAYS LOOK FOR 

05:17:27.966 --> 05:17:32.290
VULNERABILITIES, AND THEY KNOW 
THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS 

05:17:32.571 --> 05:17:36.300
SUPPORTED UKRAINE, AND IF THEY 
-- IF THE RUSSIANS DETERMINED OR

05:17:36.541 --> 05:17:41.100
SUSPECT THAT THAT SUPPORT IS 
LESSENED OR NOT THERE, THEY WILL

05:17:41.333 --> 05:17:43.519
LIKELY TAKE ADVANTAGE. 
&gt;&gt; THEY COULD HAVE POUNCED. 

05:17:43.520 --> 05:17:45.999
&gt;&gt; THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE. 

05:17:46.000 --> 05:17:49.241
&gt;&gt; SO HE HAD A DESPERATE MAN ON 
THE PHONE AND HE ASKED A 

05:17:49.461 --> 05:17:55.381
DESPERATE MAN FOR A FAVOR. BASED
ON YOUR TESTIMONY IT SOUNDS LIKE

05:17:56.210 --> 05:17:58.240
BEGRUDGINGLY, PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKYY ACTUALLY AGREED TO DO 

05:17:58.461 --> 05:18:01.440
THAT FAVOR AND INVESTIGATE THE 
BIDENS AND BURISMA, IS THAT 

05:18:02.093 --> 05:18:03.802
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY DOES SAY 

05:18:03.803 --> 05:18:07.480
IN THE TRANSCRIPT THAT HE WILL 
PURSUE THE INVESTIGATION. 

05:18:07.481 --> 05:18:11.880
&gt;&gt; SO WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ASKED FOR A FAVOR TO HELP 

05:18:12.173 --> 05:18:14.960
HIS POLITICAL CAREER AND IT 
APPEARS AS THOUGH THE PRESIDENT 

05:18:15.191 --> 05:18:19.600
OF THE UKRAINE AGREED TO THAT 
FAVOR. DO WE KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T 

05:18:20.262 --> 05:18:22.810
ACTUALLY HAPPEN? DO WE KNOW WHY 
THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT IN 

05:18:23.640 --> 05:18:25.691
FRONT OF CNN OR TO CNN 

05:18:28.781 --> 05:18:30.781
ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION? 

05:18:34.283 --> 05:18:37.710
&gt;&gt; AS WE HAVE DETERMINED, AS WE 
HAVE DISCUSSED HERE, ON 

05:18:38.070 --> 05:18:45.471
SEPTEMBER 11, JUST BEFORE ANY 
CNN DISCUSSION OR INTERVIEW, THE

05:18:45.710 --> 05:18:49.921
HOLD WAS RELEASED. THE HOLD ON 
THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS 

05:18:50.173 --> 05:18:52.420
RELEASED. 
&gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T -- SO THE HOLD 

05:18:53.074 --> 05:18:55.431
IS RELEASED. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED THAT 

05:18:55.776 --> 05:19:00.123
HOLD BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT A 
WHISTLE BLOWER HAD BASICALLY 

05:19:00.451 --> 05:19:03.119
TURNED THIS IN? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, SIR. 

05:19:03.120 --> 05:19:05.759
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
POSSIBLE? 

05:19:05.760 --> 05:19:08.000
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO 
JUDGE. 

05:19:08.001 --> 05:19:11.955
&gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 
THE OTHER SIDE HAS CLAIMED OR 

05:19:12.195 --> 05:19:14.900
HAS DEFENDED THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING THAT THE AID WENT 

05:19:15.140 --> 05:19:18.840
THROUGH, THAT THERE WAS NEVER 
ANY INVESTIGATION. BUT THE 

05:19:19.120 --> 05:19:22.700
PRESIDENT ATTEMPTED TO GET THOSE
THINGS DONE AND IT LOOKS LIKE 

05:19:22.990 --> 05:19:26.310
THERE WAS AN INITIAL AGREEMENT 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO 

05:19:26.530 --> 05:19:28.530
ACTUALLY DO 

05:19:32.060 --> 05:19:36.200
THOSE THINGS. SO, AMBASSADORS, 
IS ATTEMPTED MURDER A CRIME? 

05:19:36.430 --> 05:19:40.530
&gt;&gt; IS ATTEMPTED MURDER A CRIME? 
&gt;&gt; ATTEMPTED MURDER IS A CRIME. 

05:19:40.780 --> 05:19:44.920
&gt;&gt; IS ATTEMPTED ROBBERY A CRIME?
&gt;&gt; NEITHER OF US IS A LAWYER, 

05:19:45.145 --> 05:19:47.230
BUT I -- 
&gt;&gt; I THINK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM 

05:19:47.463 --> 05:19:50.720
COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT. YES, IT IS. 

05:19:51.271 --> 05:19:54.400
&gt;&gt; IS ATTEMPTED EXTORTION AND 
BRIBERY A CRIME? 

05:19:54.630 --> 05:19:56.630
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, SIR. 

05:20:01.170 --> 05:20:04.371
IN THE MINUTE THAT I HAVE LEFT, 
I WANT YOU TO SPEAK TO THE 

05:20:04.600 --> 05:20:09.213
NATION ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE, 
AMBASSADOR KENT. YOU SAID IN 

05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:12.440
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU 
WARNED ABOUT SELECTIVE 

05:20:12.721 --> 05:20:17.000
PROSECUTIONS AND A PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES GOING AFTER 

05:20:18.231 --> 05:20:23.930
SPECIFIC AMERICANS ABROAD. 
IF THIS CONGRESS CLEARS 

05:20:24.170 --> 05:20:27.310
PRESIDENT TRUMP, DOES IT MEAN 
THAT HE CAN GO ASK ANOTHER 

05:20:27.640 --> 05:20:31.030
FOREIGN COUNTRY TO INVESTIGATE 
ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, 

05:20:31.320 --> 05:20:35.840
A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, A 
GOVERNOR, A SENATOR, OR ANY 

05:20:36.065 --> 05:20:39.950
PRIVATE AMERICAN CITIZEN DOING 
BUSINESS OVERSEAS? IF THERE IS 

05:20:40.200 --> 05:20:43.510
NO CONSEQUENCE FOR A PRESIDENT 
WHO DOES THAT, THEN IT MEANS 

05:20:43.740 --> 05:20:48.370
THERE IS A GREEN LIGHT, DOESN'T 
IT, FOR ANY PRESIDENT TO ASK ANY

05:20:48.660 --> 05:20:51.750
COUNTRY TO GO PROSECUTOR OR 
INVESTIGATE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 

05:20:51.991 --> 05:20:57.380
FOR A POLITICAL AND PERSONAL 
GAIN OF THAT PRESIDENT, DOESN'T 

05:20:57.851 --> 05:20:59.751
IT? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. 

05:20:59.752 --> 05:21:01.909
AND FIRST OF ALL, I AM NOT AN 
AMBASSADOR. 

05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:05.870
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY. DEPUTY SECRETARY. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL REPEAT, ON PRINCIPAL, 

05:21:06.105 --> 05:21:08.680
REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTRY, 
WHETHER IT THE IS THE UKRAINE 

05:21:08.922 --> 05:21:12.580
DU.S. OR ANY COUNTRY, THE FACTS 
OF LAW, CRIMINAL NEXT US SHOULD 

05:21:12.820 --> 05:21:15.490
DRIVE INVESTIGATIONS BY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND IS NOT

05:21:15.788 --> 05:21:20.500
THE ROLE OF POLITICIANS TO BE 
INVOLVED IN DIRECTING THE 

05:21:20.770 --> 05:21:25.158
JUDICIAL SYSTEMS OF THEIR OWN 
COUNTRY OR OTHER COUNTRIES. 

05:21:25.159 --> 05:21:27.159
&gt;&gt; 

05:21:28.693 --> 05:21:30.693
I 

05:21:33.710 --> 05:21:35.710
YIELD BACK

05:21:41.340 --> 05:21:43.940
. 
&gt;&gt; YOUR RESPONSER WAS, QUOTE, 

05:21:44.180 --> 05:21:46.503
ALL AMBASSADORS SERVE AT THE 
PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT, AND 

05:21:46.851 --> 05:21:50.450
THAT IS WITHOUT QUESTION. 
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT, END 

05:21:50.688 --> 05:21:52.688
QUOTE. DO YOU 

05:21:55.133 --> 05:21:58.190
REMEMBER SAYING THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I DO AND IT IS TRY. 

05:21:58.191 --> 05:22:00.139
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT VERY CLEARLY 
HAS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL 

05:22:00.140 --> 05:22:01.879
AUTHORITY, DOES HE NOT? 
&gt;&gt; HE DOES. 

05:22:01.880 --> 05:22:05.640
&gt;&gt; MOST EVERYBODY APPARENTLY 
UNDERSTANDS THAT, BUT IT DOESN'T

05:22:05.999 --> 05:22:09.450
INCLUDE THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS. IN 
THE CONTEXT OF THIS IMPEACHMENT 

05:22:10.683 --> 05:22:13.552
INQUIRY, SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH, WHO I 

05:22:13.850 --> 05:22:19.240
KNOW IS A FRIEND OF YOURS, IN 
OOLOGISTING ABUSE OF POWER IN A 

05:22:19.580 --> 05:22:22.034
NATIONALLY TELEVISED INTERVIEW, 
A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE SAID,

05:22:22.283 --> 05:22:24.670
QUOTE, IT IS AN ABUSE OF POW 
TORE REMOVE AN AMBASSADOR 

05:22:24.930 --> 05:22:26.930
BECAUSE OF POLITICAL REASONS 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT 

05:22:27.080 --> 05:22:30.339
THEY'RE DOING, PERIOD, END QUOTE
THAT IS NOT TRUE, IS IT? 

05:22:30.340 --> 05:22:33.451
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, I GO BACK TO WHOA I 
SAID. THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 

05:22:34.154 --> 05:22:37.579
RIGHT TO HAVE AMBASSADORS SERVE 
AT HIS PLEASURE. 

05:22:37.580 --> 05:22:41.620
&gt;&gt; SO YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT WE 
SHOULDN'T IMPEACH A PRESIDENT 

05:22:41.939 --> 05:22:43.969
FOR EXERCISING HIS 
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. 

05:22:43.970 --> 05:22:48.193
&gt;&gt; I AM HERE AS A FACT WITNESS 
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. YOUR 

05:22:48.420 --> 05:22:50.929
JOB IS TO CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE 
BEFORE YOU. 

05:22:50.930 --> 05:22:54.239
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN DID AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH GET RECALLED FROM 

05:22:54.469 --> 05:22:56.800
UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE A MESSAGE WAS SENT 

05:22:57.020 --> 05:23:00.769
ON OR ABOUT APRIL 24th. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. AND CERTAINLY WELL 

05:23:01.810 --> 05:23:04.409
BEFORE THE JULY 25th CALL THAT 
IS IN QUESTION HERE, CORRECT? 

05:23:04.640 --> 05:23:07.422
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT A DOUBT. 
&gt;&gt; AND SHE HAD NO REMAINING 

05:23:07.650 --> 05:23:11.290
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO
UKRAINE POLICY FOR THAT THREE OR

05:23:11.514 --> 05:23:13.613
FOUR MONTHS IN BETWEEN, I TAKE 
IT? 

05:23:13.614 --> 05:23:17.008
&gt;&gt; SHE IS NOW -- SHE WAS 
TRANSFERRED TO A TEACHING SLOT 

05:23:17.240 --> 05:23:20.369
AT GEORGETOWN WHERE HER 
RESPONSIBILITIES, AMONG OTHERS, 

05:23:20.602 --> 05:23:22.773
WERE TO TEACH A CLASS ON 
UKRAINE. 

05:23:22.774 --> 05:23:24.889
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 
&gt;&gt; SO IF PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD THE

05:23:25.116 --> 05:23:28.313
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO 
REMOVE HER AS HE DID MONTHS 

05:23:28.560 --> 05:23:32.653
BEFORE THE CALL, AND SHE WASN'T 
IN THE UKRAINE OR HAVE ANY 

05:23:33.729 --> 05:23:36.100
RESPONSIBILITIES ON JULY 25th, 
DO YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR 

05:23:36.349 --> 05:23:41.328
WHY DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING HER AS
A WITNESS ON FRIDAY? 

05:23:41.329 --> 05:23:44.779
&gt;&gt; I AM HERE AS A FACT WITNESS 
UNDER SUBPOENA AND THAT IS A 

05:23:45.019 --> 05:23:49.390
QUESTION YOU COULD PERHAPS 
DIRECT TOWARDS YOUR DEMOCRATIC 

05:23:54.052 --> 05:23:55.628
COLLEAGUES. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, WE HAVE 

05:23:55.629 --> 05:23:59.963
ESTABLISHED THAT ON JULY 25th 
BOTH PARTICIPANTS IN THE CALL, 

05:24:00.462 --> 05:24:03.879
BOTH PRESIDENTS EXPRESSLY HAVE 
STATED THERE IS NO PRESSURE, NO 

05:24:04.163 --> 05:24:08.049
DEMAND, NO CONDITIONS, NO 
BLACKMAIL, NO CORRUPTION, AND I 

05:24:08.423 --> 05:24:13.387
ASK YOU AGAIN SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
THE QUID PRO QUO BEING POSSIBLE,

05:24:13.620 --> 05:24:19.282
AND I THINK WE HAVE AGREED THAT 
IT WASN'T POSSIBLE, A QUID PRO 

05:24:20.112 --> 05:24:24.269
QUO INVOLVING MILITARY AID ON 
JULY TAKEth GIVEN PRESIDENT 

05:24:24.512 --> 05:24:27.820
ZELENSKYY'S LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. 
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY DID NOT 

05:24:28.053 --> 05:24:30.648
HAVE ANY IDEAS THAT THE SECURITY
ASSISTANCE WAS ON HOLD. 

05:24:30.649 --> 05:24:36.262
&gt;&gt; SO DO YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION
WITHIN DAYS OF THAT PHONE CALL 

05:24:36.632 --> 05:24:39.303
WHEN NO QUID PRO QUO WAS EVEN 
POSSIBLE A PERSON WHO LATER 

05:24:39.779 --> 05:24:44.680
BECAME A WHISTLEBLOWER WALKED 
INTO CHAIRMAN SCHIFF'S OFFICE TO

05:24:44.909 --> 05:24:47.979
DISCUSS WHAT CHAIRMAN SCHIFF'S 
SPOKESPERSON PATRICK BOLEN SAID 

05:24:48.210 --> 05:24:53.360
WERE THE, QUOTE, OUTLINES OF THE
WHISTLEBLOWER'S ACCUSATIONS? 

05:24:53.599 --> 05:24:55.681
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY QHA. IS THE 
QUESTION, SIR? 

05:24:55.682 --> 05:24:59.011
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS DO YOU KNOW 
OR HAVE AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY

05:24:59.243 --> 05:25:01.582
THAT PERSON WOULD WALK IN A FEW 
DAYS LATER INTO CHAIRMAN 

05:25:01.812 --> 05:25:04.899
SCHIFF'S OFFICE? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT. I DO NOT. 

05:25:04.900 --> 05:25:08.819
&gt;&gt; EARLIER CHAIRMAN SCHIFF MADE 
REFERENCE TO A COLLOQUY AND THAT

05:25:09.063 --> 05:25:12.209
IS THE WAY FOR LEGISLATORS TO 
CLARIFY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO 

05:25:13.401 --> 05:25:16.343
THE PUBLIC. AND SO WITHOUT IT 
JEOPARDIZING THE WHISTLEBLOWER 

05:25:16.710 --> 05:25:21.849
IN ANY WAY, IN AN EFFORT TO FIND
OUT, CHAIRMAN, WHAT YOU KNEW AND

05:25:22.089 --> 05:25:25.479
WHEN YOU KNEW IT ABOUT THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER, I'D LIKE YOU TO 

05:25:25.714 --> 05:25:29.857
ENGAGE IN A COLLOQUY WITH ME. 
&gt;&gt; MY COLLEAGUE WILL ADDRESS HIS

05:25:30.129 --> 05:25:33.589
QUESTIONS TO THE WITNESSES. 
&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO YOU'RE

05:25:33.824 --> 05:25:38.829
NOT INTERESTED IN A COLLOQUY? 
&gt;&gt; IF YOU COULD - - YOU CAN TAKE

05:25:39.069 --> 05:25:41.220
IT ANY WAY YOU'D LIKE IT, BUT 
APPROPRIATELY YOUR QUESTIONS 

05:25:41.459 --> 05:25:43.128
SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE 
WITHINS WITNESSES. 

05:25:43.129 --> 05:25:47.892
&gt;&gt; WELL, I GUESS MY QUESTION TO 
THE WITNESS THEN, IS, WHEN ARE 

05:25:48.129 --> 05:25:50.729
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS GOING TO 
FIND OUT WHAT THE HOUSE 

05:25:51.183 --> 05:25:54.029
DEMOCRATS ALREADY KNOW? WHEN ARE
WE GOING TO FIND OUT THE DETAILS

05:25:54.269 --> 05:26:00.399
OF THE CAN'T BETWEEN CHAIRMAN 
SCHIFF AND THE WHISTLEBLOWER? 

05:26:00.636 --> 05:26:03.791
WHAT THEY -- WHEN THEY MET, THE 
NUMBER OF TIMES THEY MET? THE 

05:26:04.019 --> 05:26:07.739
DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE HAD? 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, POINT OF ORDER.

05:26:07.980 --> 05:26:11.179
&gt;&gt; POINT OF ORDER. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, THE GENTLEMAN 

05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:15.449
IS QUESTIONING THE CHAIR WHICH 
IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE 

05:26:15.690 --> 05:26:19.759
RESOLUTION UNDER THE RULES OF 
HEARING AND THE RULES IS MORE 

05:26:19.989 --> 05:26:22.499
OVER CONTRARY TO THE LAW AND 
PRACTICE OF THIS COMMITTEE, AND 

05:26:22.749 --> 05:26:25.028
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO QUOTE MR. 
CHAIRMAN -- 

05:26:25.029 --> 05:26:28.749
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT TRYING TO FIND OUT 
THE IDENTITY. I WANT TO FIND OUT

05:26:28.999 --> 05:26:34.399
THE DATE THAT THIS HAPPENED. 
&gt;&gt; AND IF BOTH COULD SUSPEND. 

05:26:34.939 --> 05:26:37.069
YOU RESUME QUESTIONING OF THE 
WITNESS SO I WOULD RECOMMEND 

05:26:37.322 --> 05:26:39.539
THAT WE MOVE ON. 
&gt;&gt; A PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION. ARE

05:26:39.819 --> 05:26:42.098
WE EVER GOING TO FIND OUT THE 
DETAILS -- 

05:26:42.099 --> 05:26:44.058
&gt;&gt; I GUESS -- 
&gt;&gt; I GUESS -- 

05:26:44.059 --> 05:26:46.689
&gt;&gt; MY POINT OF ORDER. 
&gt;&gt; I GUESS HE HAS NOT RESIEWSMED

05:26:46.953 --> 05:26:49.431
HIS QUESTIONING OF THE ORDER. 
YOUR TIME IS DWINDLING. I 

05:26:49.672 --> 05:26:51.672
SUGGEST YOU USE IT. 
&gt;&gt; 

05:26:54.623 --> 05:27:00.448
I'LL YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

05:27:00.449 --> 05:27:05.406
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE 
SUGGESTED THAT THE REAL REASON 

05:27:05.947 --> 05:27:10.599
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PRESSURE 
CAMPAIGN ON THE UKRAINE WAS TO 

05:27:10.839 --> 05:27:17.939
ROOT OUT CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. 
I HAVE GONE BACK AND READ THE 

05:27:18.304 --> 05:27:21.382
MEMORANDUM OF CALLS TWO OR THREE
TIMES ACTUALLY, AND I DON'T 

05:27:21.639 --> 05:27:25.592
RECALL A SINGLE INNINGS STANCE 
WHERE THE PRESIDENT EVER USED 

05:27:25.969 --> 05:27:30.349
THE WORD CORRUPTION, NOR THE 
WORD CORRUPT. I KNOW IN ANSWER 

05:27:30.879 --> 05:27:33.679
TO THE CHAIRMAN'S OPENING 
QUESTIONS YOU'D INDICATED YOU 

05:27:33.932 --> 05:27:37.320
HAD GONE BACK AND READ IT ABOUT 
A MONTH AGO. DO YOU RECALL THE 

05:27:37.559 --> 05:27:40.201
PRESIDENT IN THAT JULY 25th 
PHONE CALL WITH PRESIDENT 

05:27:41.422 --> 05:27:43.948
ZELENSKYY EVER UTTERING THE WORD
CORRUPTION OR CORRUPTION? 

05:27:43.949 --> 05:27:47.140
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL, BUT IT WOULD 
BE A MATTER OF RECORD THAT IT 

05:27:47.359 --> 05:27:49.479
HAS BEEN RELEASED. 
&gt;&gt; BUT HE DID MANAGE TO FIND 

05:27:49.719 --> 05:27:53.612
TIME TO MENTION HIS POTENTIAL 
POLITICAL LIVE RAHAL IN 2020. 

05:27:53.848 --> 05:27:57.749
YOU ALSO ANSWERED IN RESPONSE TO
THE QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

05:27:57.999 --> 05:28:00.113
WORKING ON THE ISSUE OF 
CORRUPTION LITERALLY FOR 

05:28:00.339 --> 05:28:04.512
DECADES. I THANK YOU FOR THAT ON
BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

05:28:04.739 --> 05:28:09.549
AND INDEED, ON OCTOBER 15th, YOU
TESTIFIED ABOUT LONG-STANDING 

05:28:09.809 --> 05:28:14.579
U.S. POLICY MEANT TO COMBAT 
CORRUPTION IN THE UKRAINE. 

05:28:14.809 --> 05:28:20.809
CHAMPIONED BY PEOPLE SUCH AS THE
FORKER AMBASSADOR MARIA 

05:28:21.039 --> 05:28:23.949
YOVANOVITCH. BUT, MR. KENT, IS 
IT NOT TRUE THAT RATHER THAN 

05:28:24.327 --> 05:28:27.449
FIGHTING CORRUPTION IN GENERAL 
IN UKRAINE THAT WHAT PRESIDENT 

05:28:28.062 --> 05:28:31.959
TRUMP ACTUALLY DID WAS 
UNCEREMONIOUSLY RECALL AND 

05:28:32.669 --> 05:28:36.379
REMOVE AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH 
FROM HER POST IN UKRAINE? 

05:28:36.380 --> 05:28:39.668
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY, FIRST OF AWE, AS
I REPEATED BEFORE, THE PRESIDENT

05:28:39.919 --> 05:28:43.869
HAS THE RIGHT TO RECALL 
AMBASSADORS. IT REMAIN AS MATTER

05:28:44.469 --> 05:28:48.099
OF POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES 
TOWARDS U CREPE TO HELP THEM 

05:28:48.808 --> 05:28:52.421
OVERCOME A LEGACY OF CORRUPTION 
IN CREATING NEW INSTITUTIONING 

05:28:52.659 --> 05:28:56.736
AND MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN 
DISCUSSING TODAY WHICH INVOLVED 

05:28:56.960 --> 05:28:59.462
AN IRREGULAR CHANNEL WAS REQUEST
THAT WENT AGAINST U.S. POLICY 

05:28:59.702 --> 05:29:03.569
THAT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED THE 
RULE OF LAW AND OUR LONG 

05:29:03.799 --> 05:29:06.829
STANDING POLICY GOALS IN UKRAINE
AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE 

05:29:07.309 --> 05:29:10.312
POSTSOVIET SPACE. 
&gt;&gt; THOSE POLICIES WERE, INDEED, 

05:29:11.249 --> 05:29:13.249
CHAMPIONED BY AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH. 

05:30:07.600 --> 05:30:11.402
PROSECUTORS LIKE THE KGB WERE 
INSTRUMENTS OF OPPRESSION. 

05:30:11.403 --> 05:30:16.694
&gt;&gt; I SAID THAT AND I BELIEVE 
IT'S TRUE. 

05:30:16.695 --> 05:30:24.103
&gt;&gt; SO FINALLY, MR. KENT, FOR AS 
LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, U.S. 

05:30:24.388 --> 05:30:29.031
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN 
PREDICATED ON A DECORATED 

05:30:29.321 --> 05:30:32.218
PRINCIPAL INTEREST. FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH, PRESS, ASSEMBLY OF 

05:30:32.506 --> 05:30:38.849
RELIGION, FREE AND OPEN 
ELECTIONS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. 

05:30:39.128 --> 05:30:46.537
MR. KENT, WHEN AMERICAN LEADERS 
ASK FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO 

05:30:46.827 --> 05:30:48.956
INVESTIGATE THEIR 
POTENTIALRIVALS, DOESN'T THAT 

05:30:49.243 --> 05:30:53.654
MAKE IT HARDER FOR US TO 
ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE 

05:30:53.937 --> 05:30:56.779
DEMOCRATIC VALUES? 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT MAKES IT MORE 

05:30:57.059 --> 05:30:59.225
DIFFICULT FOR OUR DIPLOMATIC 
REPRESENTATIVES OVERSEAS TO 

05:30:59.505 --> 05:31:02.490
CARRY OUT THOSE POLICY GOALS, 
YES. 

05:31:02.491 --> 05:31:04.491
&gt;&gt; HOW IS THAT, SIR? 
&gt;&gt; THERE 

05:31:07.612 --> 05:31:14.722
IS AN ISSUE  OF CREDIBILITIES. 
THEY HEAR SOMEONE SAYING 

05:31:15.008 --> 05:31:19.273
SOMETHING ELSE. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WOULD YOU 

05:31:19.548 --> 05:31:25.080
AGREE WITH THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD. OUR CREDIBILITY IS 

05:31:25.380 --> 05:31:29.074
BASED ON A RESPECT FOR THE 
UNITED STATES. AND IF WE DAMAGE 

05:31:29.365 --> 05:31:32.330
THAT RESPECT, THEN IT HURTS OUR 
CREDIBILITY AND MAKES IT MORE 

05:31:32.613 --> 05:31:36.604
DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO OUR JOBS.
&gt;&gt; ANYONE LOOKING AT THE FACTS 

05:31:36.912 --> 05:31:41.181
CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED WAS AN 
ABUSE OF POWER. ANYONE LOOKING 

05:31:41.465 --> 05:31:49.900
AT THE FACTS CAN SEE THAT WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS UNETHICAL. ANYONE 

05:31:50.203 --> 05:31:55.322
LOOKING AT THE FACTS CAN SEE, 
ANYONE LOOKING AT THE FACTS CAN 

05:31:56.403 --> 05:32:06.321
SEE THAT WHAT WENT ON WAS JUST 
PLAIN WRONG. I YIELD 

05:32:06.602 --> 05:32:10.884
BACK, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; MR. JORDAN. 

05:32:10.885 --> 05:32:14.599
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 55 
DAYS THAT THERE WAS A DELAY ON 

05:32:14.888 --> 05:32:17.847
SENDING HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 

05:32:18.567 --> 05:32:20.787
UKRAINE. NOT TALKING ANY 
COUNTRY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 

05:32:21.064 --> 05:32:23.927
UKRAINE. ONE OF THE THREE MOST 
CORRUPT COUNTRIES ON THE PLANET 

05:32:24.211 --> 05:32:27.367
ARE WITNESSED ON FRIDAY. SHE 
TESTIFIED IN HER DEPOSITION. 

05:32:27.665 --> 05:32:33.390
CORRUPTION IS NOT JUST PREVALENT
IN UKRAINE, IT'S THE SYSTEM. SO 

05:32:34.636 --> 05:32:37.892
OUR PRESIDENT SAID TIMEOUT. 
TIMEOUT. LET'S CHECK OUT THIS 

05:32:38.456 --> 05:32:42.181
NEW GUY. LET'S SEE IF ZELENSKY 
IS THE NEW DEAL. THIS NEW GUY 

05:32:43.009 --> 05:32:46.373
THAT GOT ELECTED IN APRIL, WHOSE
PARTY TOOK OVER IN JULY. LET'S 

05:32:46.660 --> 05:32:51.019
SEE IF HE IS LEGITIMATE. KEEP IN
MIND THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN 

05:32:51.293 --> 05:32:54.578
DISCUSSED. AND IN 2018 PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS ALREADY DONE MORE FOR 

05:32:54.862 --> 05:32:58.362
UKRAINE THAN OBAMA DID. THAT IS 
RIGHT. PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO 

05:32:58.668 --> 05:33:04.367
DOESN'T LIKE FOREIGN AID, WANTED
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO DO MORE, 

05:33:04.706 --> 05:33:08.796
KNEW HOW CORRUPT UKRAINE MORE 
DID MORE BECAUSE HE GAVE 

05:33:09.079 --> 05:33:13.884
AFTERLANCE. OUR WITNESSES HAVE 
SAID THIS. OTHERS HAVE SAID 

05:33:14.293 --> 05:33:17.726
THIS. OBAMA GAVE THEM BLANKETS, 
TRUMP GAVE THEM MISSILES. BUT 

05:33:18.014 --> 05:33:21.407
WHEN IT CAME TIME TO CHECK OUT 
THIS NEW GUY, MR. TRUMP SAID 

05:33:21.696 --> 05:33:27.405
LET'S SEE IF HE LEGIT. SO FOR 55
DAYS WE CHECKED HIM OUT. 

05:33:27.705 --> 05:33:29.700
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD FIVE 
INTERACTIONS WITH SENIOR 

05:33:29.701 --> 05:33:32.890
OFFICIALS IN THAT TIME FRAME. 
ONE WAS THE PHONE CALL. THE JULY

05:33:33.631 --> 05:33:37.187
25th PHONE CALL BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 

05:33:37.480 --> 05:33:41.099
ZELENSKY. AND THERE WAS FOUR 
OTHER FACE TO FACE MEETINGS WITH

05:33:41.420 --> 05:33:45.565
U.S. OFFICIALS. NOT ONE OF THOSE
INTERACTIONS, NOT ONE, WAS 

05:33:46.869 --> 05:33:48.869
SECURITY ASSISTANCE DOLLARS 
LINKED TO INVESTIGATING BAH 

05:33:49.063 --> 05:33:51.063
RAISE MA OR BIDEN. BUT GUESS 
WHAT 

05:33:54.257 --> 05:33:59.675
HAPPENED IN THOSE 55 DAYS? U.S. 
SENATORS, MASTER BOLTON, VICE 

05:33:59.963 --> 05:34:03.254
PRESIDENT PENCE ALL BECAME 
CONVINCED THAT ZELENSKY WAS IN 

05:34:03.546 --> 05:34:07.597
FACT WORTH THE RISK. THAT HE WAS
THE REAL DEAL AND A REAL CHANGE.

05:34:07.919 --> 05:34:10.895
AND THEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT, HE 
IS A REFORMER, RELEASE THE 

05:34:11.177 --> 05:34:14.166
MONEY. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID. NOW OVER 

05:34:14.456 --> 05:34:17.960
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE MORE WITNESSES LIKE WE 

05:34:18.241 --> 05:34:21.212
HAD TODAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS 
WILL PARADE IN HERE AND THEY 

05:34:21.643 --> 05:34:26.057
WILL SAY THIS. SO AND SO SAID 
SUCH AND SUCH TO SO AND SO AND 

05:34:26.345 --> 05:34:29.009
THEREFORE WE'VE GOT TO IMPEACH 
THE PRESIDENT. ACTUALLY, WE CAN 

05:34:29.292 --> 05:34:32.838
GET MORE SPECIFIC. WE COVERED 
THIS A LITTLE BIT AGO. THEY SAID

05:34:33.380 --> 05:34:37.650
SOMETHING LIKE A PASTOR SONDLAND
SAID AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID IN

05:34:38.490 --> 05:34:43.947
HIS DEPOSITION. THAT I TOLD MR. 
MORRISON THAT I CONVEYED THIS 

05:34:44.245 --> 05:34:48.110
MESSAGE TO MR. YARMAC, AND A 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.

05:34:48.397 --> 05:34:52.270
AND IF YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT, THAT
IS THE DEMOCRATS PLAN AND WHY 

05:34:52.566 --> 05:34:56.254
THEY WANT TO IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL 

05:34:56.562 --> 05:35:01.121
HEAR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
WEEKS. BUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY 

05:35:01.414 --> 05:35:06.005
DO, FOUR FACTS WILL NOT CHANGE. 
THE CALL SAYS NO LINKAGE BETWEEN

05:35:06.296 --> 05:35:08.296
DOLLARS AND THE INVESTIGATION 
INTO BAH RAISE 

05:35:13.081 --> 05:35:16.328
MA AND THE 
BIDENS. UKRAINE CARIBBEANS 

05:35:16.618 --> 05:35:21.341
DIDN'T KNOW THE AID WAS WITHHELD
AT THE TIME OF THE 

05:35:26.341 --> 05:35:34.278
PHONE CALL AND MOST IMPORTANTLY 
-- NOW THERE IS ONE WITNESS. ONE

05:35:34.562 --> 05:35:37.478
WITNESS THEY WON'T BRING IN 
FRONT OF US. WON'T BRING IN 

05:35:37.760 --> 05:35:43.218
FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND THAT IS THE GUY THAT STARTED

05:35:43.514 --> 05:35:45.514
IT 

05:35:47.792 --> 05:35:52.728
ALL. THE  -- THE WHISTLEBLOWER. 
ONLY CHAIRMAN SCHIFF KNOWS WHO 

05:35:53.039 --> 05:35:56.191
THE WHISTLEBLOWER IS. WE DON'T. 
WE WILL NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO 

05:35:56.472 --> 05:35:59.386
SEE THE WHISTLEBLOWER RAISE HIS 
RIGHT HAND, SWEAR TO TELL THE 

05:35:59.673 --> 05:36:03.004
TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
WE WILL NEVER GET THAT CHANCE. 

05:36:03.301 --> 05:36:06.527
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WON'T GET THAT CHANCE. 

05:36:06.842 --> 05:36:10.367
THIS ANONYMOUS SO-CALLED 
WHISTLEBLOWER WITH NO FIRSTHAND 

05:36:10.651 --> 05:36:13.287
KNOWLEDGE WHO ADVISED THE 
PRESIDENT AND WORKED WITH JOE 

05:36:13.571 --> 05:36:17.548
BIDEN WILL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO
QUESTION THAT INDIVIDUAL. 

05:36:17.888 --> 05:36:25.614
DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO IMPEACH 
THE PRESIDENT BASED ON ALL THAT?

05:36:25.938 --> 05:36:29.413
ALL THAT? 11.5 MONTHS BEFORE AN 
ELECTION. WILL NOT GET TO CHECK 

05:36:31.431 --> 05:36:35.562
OUT HIS CREDIBILITY, HIS 
MOTIVATIONS, HIS BIAS. THIS IS A

05:36:35.852 --> 05:36:39.332
SAD DAY. THIS IS A SAD DAY FOR 
THIS COUNTRY. YOU THINK ABOUT 

05:36:39.613 --> 05:36:42.911
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT OUR 
NATION THROUGH FOR THE LAST 

05:36:43.192 --> 05:36:46.307
THREE YEARS. STARTED JULY OF 
2016 WHEN THEY SPIED ON TWO 

05:36:46.594 --> 05:36:48.594
AMERICAN CITIZENS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 

05:36:48.599 --> 05:36:51.175
AND ALL THAT UNFOLDED WITH THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AFTER THAT

05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:56.532
AND WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK, HERE 
WE ARE. BASED ON THIS. BASED ON 

05:36:56.821 --> 05:37:00.595
THIS. THIS IS A -- THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE SEE THROUGH ALL OF THIS. 

05:37:00.880 --> 05:37:02.950
THEY UNDERSTAND THE TACTS 
SPOTLIGHT THE PRESIDENT. THEY 

05:37:03.245 --> 05:37:05.245
UNDERSTAND 

05:37:07.384 --> 05:37:11.217
THIS PROCESS IS UNFIRE. -- 
UNFAIR. AND WITH THAT I YIELD 

05:37:11.498 --> 05:37:12.944
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. WELCH. 

05:37:12.945 --> 05:37:16.485
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I SAID TO MY 
COLLEAGUE, I WOULD BE GLAD TO 

05:37:16.780 --> 05:37:19.831
HAVE THE PERSON WHO STARTED IT 
ALL COME IN AND TESTIFY. 

05:37:20.141 --> 05:37:23.496
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WELCOME TO 
TAKE A SEAT RIGHT THERE. 

05:37:29.275 --> 05:37:34.141
YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION HERE IS 
NOT A DISPUTE ABOUT THE ENORMOUS

05:37:34.444 --> 05:37:37.968
POWER THAT A PRESIDENT HAS. THE 
QUESTION IS WHETHER IN THIS 

05:37:38.248 --> 05:37:45.377
CASE, THERE WAS AN ABUSE OF THAT
POWER. THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE AN

05:37:45.660 --> 05:37:48.075
AMBASSADOR FOR ANY REASON 
WHATSOEVER. THE PRESIDENT CAN 

05:37:48.361 --> 05:37:51.684
CHANGE HIS POLICY. AS HE DID 
WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR FOR 

05:37:51.973 --> 05:37:56.782
TURKEY TO GO IN AND INVADE 
KURDISTAN. DESPITE OPPOSITION 

05:37:58.294 --> 05:38:01.876
FROM MANY OF HIS SENIOR 
ADVISORS. THE PRESIDENT CAN 

05:38:02.164 --> 05:38:06.571
CHANGE HIS POSITION AND OUR 
POSITION ON UKRAINE. BUT IS 

05:38:06.858 --> 05:38:11.265
THERE A LIMIT? THERE IS. 
BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUTION SAYS NO

05:38:11.550 --> 05:38:21.488
ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. AND THAT 
LIMIT IS THAT ONE CANNOT, EVEN 

05:38:21.939 --> 05:38:28.608
AS PRESIDENT, USE THE PUBLIC 
TRUST OF HIGH OFFICE FOR 

05:38:28.892 --> 05:38:32.173
PERSONAL GAIN. THE LAW PROHIBITS
ANY ONE 

05:38:36.265 --> 05:38:39.682
OF US HERE ON THE DIAS IS 
SEEKING FOREIGN ASSISTANCE. THE 

05:38:39.969 --> 05:38:45.036
QUESTION FOR US IS WHETHER THE 
USE OF POWER BY THE PRESIDENT 

05:38:46.675 --> 05:38:51.381
WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ADVANCING
HIS POLITICAL INTEREST IN THE 

05:38:51.681 --> 05:38:55.167
2020 CAMPAIGN. AND BY THE WAY, 
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO ATTACK

05:38:55.475 --> 05:39:00.858
JOE BIDEN AND HIS SON, HE IS 
FREE TO DO IT. HE IS JUST NOT 

05:39:01.168 --> 05:39:05.079
FREE TO CHANGE OUR FOREIGN 
POLICY UNLESS HEGETS HIS WAY TO 

05:39:05.402 --> 05:39:11.406
A SYSTEM IN THAT CAMPAIGN. THAT 
IS A LINE HE CAN'T CROSS. NOW, 

05:39:11.705 --> 05:39:18.350
YOU ALL HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR 
ABOUT WHAT OUR CONTINUOUS 

05:39:18.737 --> 05:39:24.633
FOREIGN POLICY WAS. AND 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR JUST VERY 

05:39:25.113 --> 05:39:29.887
QUICKLY DESCRIBE WHY US 
WITHHOLDING AID INTERFERED WITH 

05:39:30.184 --> 05:39:31.617
ACHIEVING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 
GOALS? 

05:39:31.618 --> 05:39:41.608
&gt;&gt; ONE OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 
GOALS IS TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN

05:39:41.897 --> 05:39:45.537
EUROPE. THERE IS ONE MAJOR 
CONFLICT IN EUROPE, IT'S A 

05:39:46.101 --> 05:39:49.360
FIGHTING WAR. OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY GOALS IN SUPPORT OF 

05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:55.787
UKRAINE, IN SUPPORT OF A BROADER
STRATEGIC APPROACH TO EUROPE IS 

05:39:56.206 --> 05:40:00.592
TO FACILITATE THAT NEGOTIATION. 
IS TO TRY TO SUPPORT UKRAINE 

05:40:00.887 --> 05:40:02.724
WHEN IT NEGOTIATES WITH THE 
RUSSIANS. 

05:40:02.725 --> 05:40:10.861
&gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO GO BACK. IN THE
HISTORICAL CONTENT, MR. KENT, 

05:40:11.151 --> 05:40:14.245
YOU AND AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
PROVIDED, WE HAD 70 YEARS OF 

05:40:14.529 --> 05:40:20.944
PEACE AFTER THE WAR IN WHICH WE 
LOST OVER 400,000 AMERICAN 

05:40:21.224 --> 05:40:24.390
LIVES. AND THAT TOOK CARE. AND 
THAT WAS IN JEOPARDY, AS YOU 

05:40:24.670 --> 05:40:27.227
DESCRIBED IT AMBASSADOR TAYLOR. 
AND THAT THREATENED EACH AND 

05:40:27.514 --> 05:40:31.038
EVERY ONE OF US UP HERE AND THE 
CONSTITUENTS WE REPRESENT. IS 

05:40:31.344 --> 05:40:33.910
THAT A FAIR STATEMENT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A FAIR STATEMENT. 

05:40:34.185 --> 05:40:38.456
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO DO THREE DATES TOO.
I ONLY HAVE A LITTLE TIME. JULY 

05:40:39.306 --> 05:40:48.506
24, JULY 25, AND JULY 26. JULY 
24th, DIRECTOR MUELLER TESTIFIED

05:40:50.251 --> 05:40:53.747
ABOUT HIS INVESTIGATION AND HE 
ESTABLISHED THE ON DOUBT THAT IT

05:40:54.024 --> 05:40:57.209
WAS THE RUSSIANS THAT INTERFERED
IN OUR ELECTION. AND HE 

05:40:57.490 --> 05:41:03.160
EXPRESSED THE FEAR THAT WOULD BE
THE NEW NORMAL. ON JULY 25th 

05:41:03.451 --> 05:41:05.451
ACCORDING TO THE READ OUT OF THE

05:41:08.588 --> 05:41:10.588
PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN, HE 

05:41:13.008 --> 05:41:14.624
ASKED THE UKRAINIANS TO 
INVESTIGATEUKRAINIAN'S 

05:41:14.625 --> 05:41:18.145
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION 
THAT HAD BEEN REPUDIATED. AND ON

05:41:18.453 --> 05:41:23.518
JULY 26th, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, 
THIS PERSON WHO REPORTED TO YOU 

05:41:24.943 --> 05:41:29.212
HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE 
WANTED INVESTIGATIONS AGAIN IN 

05:41:29.531 --> 05:41:34.785
UKRAINE. SO THIS IS THE 
QUESTION, THE NEW NORMAL THAT 

05:41:35.086 --> 05:41:41.010
DIRECTOR MUELLER FEARED, IS 
THERE A NEW NORMAL THAT YOU FEAR

05:41:41.414 --> 05:41:46.438
THAT A PRESIDENT, ANY PRESIDENT,
CAN USE CONGRESSIONALLY APPROVED

05:41:46.727 --> 05:41:49.841
FOREIGN AID AS A LEVER TO GET 
PERSONAL ADVANTAGE IN SOMETHING 

05:41:50.140 --> 05:41:53.679
THAT IS IN HIS INTEREST BUT NOT 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST? 

05:41:53.680 --> 05:41:58.075
&gt;&gt; THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE, 
MR. WELCH. 

05:41:58.076 --> 05:42:00.904
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I ASK ANONYMOUS

05:42:01.242 --> 05:42:05.893
CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD
THE JULY 25th CALL BETWEEN 

05:42:06.181 --> 05:42:08.977
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ZELENSKY. 
YOU HAVE MISS CHARACTERIZED THE 

05:42:09.259 --> 05:42:13.277
CALL. IN THE FIRST OPEN HEARING 
YOU HAD A PARODY. 

05:42:13.278 --> 05:42:17.149
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN WILL SUSPEND. 
BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT WILL BE 

05:42:17.440 --> 05:42:21.411
HAPPY TO ENTER THE CALL RECORD 
INTO THE RECORD. MR. MUELLER 

05:42:21.988 --> 05:42:24.331
RECOGNIZE FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. THANK 

05:42:24.639 --> 05:42:29.041
YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, WHAT YEAR DID

05:42:29.317 --> 05:42:32.924
YOU GRADUATE FROM WEST POINT. 
&gt;&gt; 1969. 

05:42:32.925 --> 05:42:35.312
&gt;&gt; AT HEIGHTH R OF THE VIETNAM 
WAR. 

05:42:35.313 --> 05:42:37.321
&gt;&gt; THE HEIGHT WAS ABOUT THAT 
TIME. 

05:42:37.322 --> 05:42:40.139
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS YOUR CLASS RANK AT 
WEST POINT? 

05:42:40.140 --> 05:42:45.423
&gt;&gt; I WAS NUMBER FIVE. 
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN YOUR 

05:42:45.702 --> 05:42:46.590
CLASS? 
&gt;&gt; 800. 

05:42:46.591 --> 05:42:48.731
&gt;&gt; 800 CADETS, YOU WERE NUMBER 
FIVE. 

05:42:48.732 --> 05:42:51.577
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU WERE TOP 1% OF 

05:42:51.878 --> 05:42:55.056
YOUR CLASS AT WEST POINT, YOU 
PROBABLY GET YOUR PICK OF 

05:42:55.344 --> 05:42:57.558
ASSIGNMENTS, BUT YOU PICKED THE 
INFANTRY. 

05:42:57.559 --> 05:43:01.508
&gt;&gt; I DID. YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE A RIFLE COMPANY 

05:43:01.809 --> 05:43:02.645
COMMANDER. 
&gt;&gt; SIR? 

05:43:02.646 --> 05:43:04.906
&gt;&gt; WHERE DID YOU SERVE? 
&gt;&gt; IN VIETNAM. 

05:43:04.907 --> 05:43:07.887
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SEE COMBAT IN 
VIETNAM? 

05:43:07.888 --> 05:43:10.053
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU EARN ANY 

05:43:10.336 --> 05:43:14.861
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THAT SERVICE?
&gt;&gt; I WAS AWARDED THE COMBAT 

05:43:15.139 --> 05:43:19.878
INFANTRY BADGE WHICH IS MY 
HIGHEST I'M PROUDEST OF. THERE 

05:43:20.161 --> 05:43:27.263
WAS A BRONZE STAR, AN AIR MEDAL 
V. 

05:43:27.264 --> 05:43:30.793
&gt;&gt; THAT IS FOR VALOR; ISN'T IT, 
SIR? 

05:43:30.794 --> 05:43:32.808
&gt;&gt; IT IS. 
&gt;&gt; JUSTICE TALK ABOUT 

05:43:33.091 --> 05:43:37.814
JULY 26th, LET'S TALK ABOUT JULY
16th, A LOT OF YEARS LATER. YOU 

05:43:38.093 --> 05:43:42.068
ARE ON THE BRIDGE AND YOU ARE 
LOOKING OVER ON THE FRONT LINE 

05:43:42.358 --> 05:43:44.977
OF THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS. IS THAT
WHAT YOU RECALLED? 

05:43:44.978 --> 05:43:48.271
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; AND YOU SAID THE COMMANDER 

05:43:48.547 --> 05:43:51.690
THERE, THE UKRAINIAN COMMANDER 
THANKED YOU FOR THE AMERICAN 

05:43:51.995 --> 05:43:55.166
MILITARY ASSISTANCE THAT YOU 
KNEW WAS BEING WITHHELD AT THAT 

05:43:55.490 --> 05:43:57.351
MOMENT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:43:57.352 --> 05:44:00.744
&gt;&gt; HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL, 
SIR? 

05:44:00.745 --> 05:44:02.308
&gt;&gt; BADLY. 
&gt;&gt; WHY? 

05:44:02.309 --> 05:44:07.107
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT, 
THAT COMMANDER COUNTED ON US. IT

05:44:07.395 --> 05:44:11.836
WAS CLEAR THAT, THAT COMMANDER 
HAD CONFIDENCE IN US. IT WAS 

05:44:12.116 --> 05:44:14.500
CLEAR THAT COMMANDER WAS 
APPRECIATIVE OF THE CAPABILITIES

05:44:15.082 --> 05:44:18.877
THAT HE WAS GIVEN BY THAT 
ASSISTANCE, BUT ALSO THE 

05:44:19.167 --> 05:44:21.225
REASSURANCE THAT WE WERE 
SUPPORTING HIM. 

05:44:21.226 --> 05:44:24.947
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS A 
QUITTER, AMBASSADOR. BUT YOU 

05:44:25.231 --> 05:44:27.647
THREATENED TO RESIGN, OR 
MENTIONED IT IN YOUR STATEMENT. 

05:44:27.979 --> 05:44:31.944
BEFORE I ASK YOU ABOUT THAT, 
LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE DAYS 

05:44:32.389 --> 05:44:37.482
LATER ON JULY -- EXCUSE ME, ONE 
MONTH LATER ON AUGUST 28th. YOU 

05:44:37.898 --> 05:44:41.458
FIND YOURSELF IN UKRAINE WITH 
MR. BOLTON. AND YOU CONVEY TO 

05:44:41.737 --> 05:44:44.583
HIM YOUR CONCERNS. YOU TESTIFIED
TO THIS PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE 

05:44:44.871 --> 05:44:47.669
WITHHOLDING OF MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE. WHAT DOES HE SAY TO 

05:44:48.705 --> 05:44:52.133
YOU? 
&gt;&gt; HE SAYS HE SHARES MY CONCERN,

05:44:52.421 --> 05:44:56.413
AND HE ADVISES ME TO EXPRESS 
THAT IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY TO 

05:44:56.691 --> 05:44:59.308
THE SECRETARY OF STATE. 
&gt;&gt; NOW HE IS THE NATIONAL 

05:44:59.591 --> 05:45:02.245
SECURITY ADVISOR, WORKS DIRECTLY
WITH THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE TELLS

05:45:02.528 --> 05:45:05.873
YOU, YOU SHOULD BRING IT UP WITH
THE SECRETARY OF STATE. 

05:45:05.874 --> 05:45:08.499
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER SENT A TABLE 

05:45:08.778 --> 05:45:12.092
CABLE LIKE THAT? HOW MANY TIMES 
IN YOUR CAREER 40-50 YEARS HAVE 

05:45:12.382 --> 05:45:15.724
YOU SENT A CABLE DIRECTLY TO THE
SECRETARY OF STATE. 

05:45:15.725 --> 05:45:17.865
&gt;&gt; ONCE. 
&gt;&gt; THIS TIME? 

05:45:17.866 --> 05:45:20.160
&gt;&gt;  YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; IN 50 YEARS. 

05:45:20.161 --> 05:45:22.650
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; SO THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

05:45:22.937 --> 05:45:26.278
ADVISOR THAT CAN TELL IT TO THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND HE SHARES 

05:45:26.622 --> 05:45:30.410
YOUR CONCERN SAYS YOU, THE 
AMBASSADOR, SERVING UKRAINE 

05:45:30.685 --> 05:45:35.253
SHOULD CABLE THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE DIRECTLY AND YOU DO SO. 

05:45:35.561 --> 05:45:38.121
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID THE CABLE SAY, SIR? 

05:45:38.402 --> 05:45:43.614
&gt;&gt; IT'S A CLASSIFIED CABLE. 
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT GOING INTO CLASSIFIED

05:45:43.902 --> 05:45:46.175
INFORMATION. 
&gt;&gt; IT SAYS SECURITY ASSISTANCE, 

05:45:46.453 --> 05:45:51.577
IT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
TODAY. SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO 

05:45:51.974 --> 05:45:55.458
UKRAINE IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
UKRAINE, I ALSO MAKE THE POINT 

05:45:55.739 --> 05:45:59.542
WE TALKED ABOUT IT HERE TODAY, 
UKRAINE IS IMPORTANT TO OUR 

05:45:59.822 --> 05:46:02.861
NATIONAL SECURITY AND BUT SHOULD
SUPPORT IT. NOT TO 

05:46:06.102 --> 05:46:09.952
PROVIDE THAT WOULD BE FOLLY. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU GET AN ANSWER TO YOUR

05:46:10.239 --> 05:46:11.950
CABLE? 
&gt;&gt; NOT DIRECTLY. NECESSARY. 

05:46:11.951 --> 05:46:14.207
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO 
IT? 

05:46:14.208 --> 05:46:16.961
&gt;&gt; SECRETARY KENT. 
&gt;&gt; SECRETARY KENT, DO YOU KNOW 

05:46:17.257 --> 05:46:20.101
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS ON VACATION WHEN HIS 

05:46:20.386 --> 05:46:24.833
CABLE CAME IN, BUT MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS, IT MADE IT TO 

05:46:25.150 --> 05:46:28.011
ITS RECIPIENT. 
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW SECRETARY POMPEO WAS 

05:46:28.532 --> 05:46:34.240
ON THE CALL A MONTH EARLIER ON 
JULY 25th. WHAT DID HE DO WITH 

05:46:34.694 --> 05:46:37.490
IT? 
&gt;&gt; I HONESTLY CAN'T SAY FOR SURE

05:46:37.932 --> 05:46:40.922
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CABLE 
ONCE THE MESSAGE WAS BROUGHT IN 

05:46:41.209 --> 05:46:44.677
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. 
&gt;&gt; ONE OTHER QUESTION, 

05:46:44.962 --> 05:46:48.048
GENTLEMEN. ON SEPTEMBER 1st, YOU
RECALL A MEETING BETWEEN THE 

05:46:50.450 --> 05:46:53.075
VICE PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE MR. ZELENSKY, RIGHT OFF 

05:46:53.372 --> 05:46:56.423
THE BAT THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE
RAISES SECURITY ASSISTANCE. AND 

05:46:56.745 --> 05:46:59.839
THE VICE PRESIDENT SAYS I WILL 
TALK TO THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT 

05:47:00.119 --> 05:47:03.348
ABOUT THAT. I'LL MAKE A CALL. 
YOU KNOW IF THE VICE PRESIDENT 

05:47:03.624 --> 05:47:06.072
MADE THAT CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, SIR. 

05:47:06.073 --> 05:47:09.777
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT IF ANYTHING THE
VICE PRESIDENT HAD TO DO WITH 

05:47:10.059 --> 05:47:13.249
ANY OF THIS? WHAT MORE CAN YOU 
TELL US ABOUT THE VICE 

05:47:13.535 --> 05:47:16.788
PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN THIS? DO YOU
KNOW IF HE EVER RAISED THIS 

05:47:17.079 --> 05:47:19.101
ISSUE WITH ANYONE IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION? WHETHER HE 

05:47:19.544 --> 05:47:22.823
PUSHED FOR THE RELEASE OF THAT 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE? 

05:47:22.824 --> 05:47:26.160
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE TO THE BEST OF MY 

05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:28.769
UNDERSTANDING, VICE PRESIDENT 
WAS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE RELEASE 

05:47:29.053 --> 05:47:32.707
OF THE ASSISTANCE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK MR. 

05:47:32.991 --> 05:47:35.815
CHAIR. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE AN 

05:47:36.089 --> 05:47:39.049
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST. 
&gt;&gt; STATE YOUR REQUEST. 

05:47:39.050 --> 05:47:44.052
&gt;&gt; I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO 
SUBMIT FOR THE RECORD THE 

05:47:44.340 --> 05:47:50.797
POLITICAL ARTICLE ON UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE

05:47:51.094 --> 05:47:53.820
RECORD. REPRESENTATIVE DELLINGS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. CAME. 

05:47:54.103 --> 05:47:56.103
THANK YOU BOTH 

05:47:58.024 --> 05:48:01.384
FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. MR. 
KENT, YOU SAID A PRESIDENT HAS 

05:48:01.675 --> 05:48:05.689
THE RIGHT TO REMOVE AN 
AMBASSADOR BECAUSE THE 

05:48:05.977 --> 05:48:08.011
AMBASSADOR SERVES THE PRESIDENT.
IS THAT CORRECT? 

05:48:08.012 --> 05:48:10.976
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; DOES THAT MOVE USUALLY COME 

05:48:11.285 --> 05:48:13.561
WITH A SMEAR CAMPAIGN OF 
THATAMBASSADOR BY THE PRESIDENT?

05:48:13.846 --> 05:48:17.935
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE RIGHT OF THE 
PRESIDENT TO MAKE A DECISION 

05:48:18.214 --> 05:48:20.214
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL 
REPRESENTATIVE IS CONFIRMED BY 

05:48:20.471 --> 05:48:23.738
THE SENATE IS SEPARATE FROM 
WHATEVER HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE 

05:48:24.017 --> 05:48:25.715
CONFINES OF U.S. GOVERNMENT 
PROCESSES. 

05:48:25.716 --> 05:48:32.327
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT 
WAS IMPORTANT TO DISCREDIT 

05:48:32.624 --> 05:48:35.546
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH WHAT SHE 
WAS NOT WILLING TO 

05:48:39.999 --> 05:48:46.086
DO OR TO DO? THE COMMITTEES 
INVESTIGATION HAS UNCOVERED A 

05:48:46.798 --> 05:48:52.195
WEB OF SHADOW DIPLOMACY. ENGAGED
AND EXECUTED BY SEVERAL STATE 

05:48:52.471 --> 05:48:55.442
DEPARTMENT, OFFICIALS, AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY 

05:48:55.719 --> 05:48:59.360
RUDY GULIANI, AND ULTIMATELY 
DIRECTED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE 

05:48:59.644 --> 05:49:05.002
HAVE HEARD SEVERAL WAYS OF 
DESCRIBING THIS SHADY, SHADOW 

05:49:05.287 --> 05:49:07.974
OPERATION. ROGUE BACK CHANNEL. 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU HAVE 

05:49:08.254 --> 05:49:11.210
DESCRIBED WHAT YOU ENCOUNTERED 
AS THE TOP DIPLOMAT ON THE 

05:49:11.489 --> 05:49:16.177
GROUND AND UKRAINE AND I QUOTE, 
HIGHLY IRREGULAR INNORMAL 

05:49:16.462 --> 05:49:19.211
CHANNEL OF U.S. POLICYMAKING. 
YOU TESTIFIED 

05:49:24.220 --> 05:49:28.300
THAT THE CHANNEL INCLUDED 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER, SECRETARY 

05:49:28.602 --> 05:49:31.875
PERRY, AND RUDY GULIANI. IS THAT
CORRECT? 

05:49:31.876 --> 05:49:36.115
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. 
&gt;&gt; BOTH OF YOU EXPLAIN YOU GREW 

05:49:36.794 --> 05:49:40.295
SERIOUSLY CONCERNED WHEN THE 
INTEREST OF THIS IRREGULAR 

05:49:40.589 --> 05:49:44.367
CHANNEL DIVERGED FROM OFFICIAL 
U.S. POLICY AND INTEREST. WAS 

05:49:44.650 --> 05:49:47.792
MR. GULIANI PROMOTING 
U.S.-NATIONAL INTEREST OR POLICY

05:49:48.068 --> 05:49:50.775
IN UKRAINE, AMBASSADOR? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO, MA'AM. 

05:49:50.776 --> 05:49:53.296
&gt;&gt; MR. KENT? 
&gt;&gt; NO, HE WAS NOT. 

05:49:53.297 --> 05:49:58.288
&gt;&gt; WHAT INTERESTS DO YOU BELIEVE
HE WAS PROMOTING, MR. KENT? 

05:49:58.289 --> 05:50:02.035
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE WAS LOOKING TO 
DIG UP POLITICAL DIRT AGAINST A 

05:50:02.317 --> 05:50:06.651
POTENTIAL RIVAL IN THE NEXT 
ELECTION CYCLE. 

05:50:06.652 --> 05:50:09.418
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? WHAT 
INTEREST DO YOU BELIEVE HE WAS 

05:50:09.727 --> 05:50:11.753
PROMOTING? 
&gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH MR. KENT. 

05:50:11.754 --> 05:50:15.644
&gt;&gt; THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE 
IS TO PROMOTE U.S. POLICIES 

05:50:15.932 --> 05:50:17.932
OVERSEAS, NOT 

05:50:19.786 --> 05:50:22.904
TO HELP THE CURRENT PRESIDENT 
WIN REELECTION. IS THAT CORRECT?

05:50:23.192 --> 05:50:26.434
&gt;&gt; ALL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ARE 
SUBJECT TO THE HATCH ACT. THEY 

05:50:26.720 --> 05:50:30.935
WILL BE PROMOTING POLICY AND NOT
INVOLVED IN PARTISAN POLITICS. 

05:50:31.218 --> 05:50:33.421
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; I AGREE. 

05:50:33.422 --> 05:50:40.551
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE RISK OF A RUNNING
A SEPARATE CHANNEL OF DIPLOMACY.

05:50:40.999 --> 05:50:43.701
THAT IS OUTSIDE OF FURTHER 
CHANNELS. 

05:50:43.982 --> 05:50:48.953
&gt;&gt; IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO ONE, BUT 
NOT THE OTHER. THAT IS, IF IT'S 

05:50:49.252 --> 05:50:53.020
COMPLETELY AGAINST U.S. POLICY 
GOALS, THEN THAT IS A MISTAKE. 

05:50:53.306 --> 05:50:58.605
THEN IT'S NOT HELPFUL. YOU CAN 
GET ADVICE AND EVEN HAVE 

05:50:58.890 --> 05:51:01.949
CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE 
NORMAL CHANNELS. BUT THEN THEY 

05:51:02.236 --> 05:51:09.726
NEED TO BE PART OF U.S. FOREIGN 
POLICY. AND APPROACHING THOSE 

05:51:11.414 --> 05:51:13.000
GOALS. 
&gt;&gt; MILLION KENT? 

05:51:13.001 --> 05:51:15.524
&gt;&gt; AGREE. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, YOU HAVE 

05:51:15.853 --> 05:51:19.506
DESCRIBED ONE INCIDENT SHORTLY 
AFTER YOU ARRIVED IN UKRAINE IN 

05:51:19.791 --> 05:51:22.382
WHICH SONDLAND ASKED STATE 
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS NOT TO 

05:51:22.669 --> 05:51:25.924
LISTEN TO A JULY 28th CALL HE 
HAD PLANNED TO HOLD WITH 

05:51:26.209 --> 05:51:28.496
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. DID YOU FIND
THAT UNUSUAL? 

05:51:28.497 --> 05:51:33.083
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF 

05:51:33.575 --> 05:51:36.209
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND MAKING THAT 
REQUEST? WHEN YOU FOUND IT 

05:51:36.494 --> 05:51:39.168
UNUSUAL. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THE
IMPACT WAS? 

05:51:39.169 --> 05:51:43.437
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE THERE WAS AN 
IMMEDIATE IMPACT. 

05:51:43.438 --> 05:51:46.003
&gt;&gt; WAS THERE A RECORDING OR TRAN
SCRIPTION? 

05:51:46.004 --> 05:51:48.412
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOT. THAT WAS THE 
IMPACT. 

05:51:48.413 --> 05:51:52.349
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY THE 
REQUEST WAS MADE SO THERE WOULD 

05:51:52.633 --> 05:51:56.077
NOT BE NORMAL STATE DEPARTMENT 
EMPLOYEES FROM THE OPERATIONS 

05:51:56.356 --> 05:51:59.212
CENTER WOULD 

05:52:04.024 --> 05:52:06.866
HAVE BEEN THER TRANSCRIBING AND 
TAKING NOTES? 

05:52:06.867 --> 05:52:11.829
&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO NOT 
HAVE IT RECORDED. 

05:52:11.830 --> 05:52:18.258
&gt;&gt; SO YOU BELIEVE THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT IS HOLDING YOUR NOTES

05:52:18.533 --> 05:52:20.788
DESPITE A DUALLY OTHERWISEDDED 
SUBPOENA. AND YOU KNOW YOUR 

05:52:21.067 --> 05:52:24.394
NOTES MAY BE THE ONLY 
DOCUMENTARY RECORD OF WHAT 

05:52:24.690 --> 05:52:28.622
HAPPENED. YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT.
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. 

05:52:28.623 --> 05:52:32.023
&gt;&gt; AND MR. KENT, YOU ARE AWARE 
YOUR NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN TURNED 

05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:34.909
OVER TO CONGRESS. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TURNED ALL RECORDS I 

05:52:35.194 --> 05:52:37.622
HAD IN MY POSSESSION TO THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE 

05:52:37.914 --> 05:52:40.765
WHATEVER WE DO IS CONSIDERED A 
FEDERAL RECORD, NOT A PERSONAL 

05:52:41.060 --> 05:52:43.060
RECORD. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH MR. 

05:52:43.918 --> 05:52:47.145
CHAIRMAN, I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN. 

05:52:47.146 --> 05:52:51.507
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED
STATING WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA 

05:52:51.801 --> 05:52:58.463
SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE IN 
INVESTING IN UKRAINE BY A TRIO 

05:52:58.742 --> 05:53:02.485
OF AMBASSADORS INCLUDING WILLIAM
TAYLOR. 

05:53:02.763 --> 05:53:05.879
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN. I 
WOULD LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH A

05:53:06.157 --> 05:53:08.881
COUPLE POINTS RAISED BY MY 
COLLEAGUE ON THE OTHER SIDE. 

05:53:09.160 --> 05:53:13.151
THEY CLAIM THE JULY 25th CALL 
SUMMARY SHOWS NO EVIDENCE OF 

05:53:13.421 --> 05:53:16.016
PRESSURE ON THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, THEY ARGUE 

05:53:16.299 --> 05:53:20.805
THE UKRAINIANS DID NOT FEEL ANY 
PRESSURE AT ANY TIME TO COMPLY 

05:53:21.136 --> 05:53:25.646
WITH ANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATIONS. IN 

05:53:26.188 --> 05:53:28.913
FACT, AMBASSADOR TAYLOR IT'S 
YOUR DEPOSITION IN OCTOBER YOU 

05:53:29.235 --> 05:53:35.176
STATED DUE TO THE HOLE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PLACED ON AID TO

05:53:35.455 --> 05:53:43.293
THE UKRAINE, THE UKRAINIANS 
BECAME QUOTE, UNQUOTE DESPERATE.

05:53:43.647 --> 05:53:47.910
ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; IN AUGUST, THEY DID NOT KNOW,

05:53:48.196 --> 05:53:53.151
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE. BUT AT THE 
END OF AUGUST, THE ARTICLE CAME 

05:53:53.439 --> 05:53:57.639
OUT IN SEPTEMBER THAT THE 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE, FOR 

05:53:57.913 --> 05:54:02.050
EXAMPLE, CAME TO ME. I WOULD USE
THE WORD DESPERATE. TO FIGURE 

05:54:02.610 --> 05:54:07.131
OUT WHY THE ASSISTANCE WAS BEING
WITHHELD. HE THOUGHT THAT 

05:54:07.420 --> 05:54:10.461
PERHAPS, IF HE WENT TO 
WASHINGTON TO TALK TO YOU, TO 

05:54:10.744 --> 05:54:14.177
TALK TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, TO
TALK TO THE PRESIDENT, HE WOULD 

05:54:14.476 --> 05:54:17.312
BE ABLE TO FIND OUT AND 
REASSURE, PROVIDE WHATEVER 

05:54:17.630 --> 05:54:22.438
ANSWER WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE 
THAT ASSISTANCE RELEASED. 

05:54:22.439 --> 05:54:27.379
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, MY COLLEAGUES 
SUGGEST THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

05:54:27.654 --> 05:54:32.279
PERSONALLY DID NOT FEEL ANY 
PRESSURE AT ANY TIME. AND YET 

05:54:33.378 --> 05:54:38.346
LATER ON IN SEPTEMBER, HE 
FINALLY RELENTED IN A 

05:54:38.629 --> 05:54:42.493
CONVERSATION WITH GORDON 
SONDLAND IN WHICH HE AGREED TO 

05:54:42.776 --> 05:54:45.047
MAKE A STATEMENT ON CNN; ISN'T 
THAT RIGHT? 

05:54:45.048 --> 05:54:47.626
&gt;&gt; HE PLANNED TO MAKE A 
STATEMENT ON CNN. 

05:54:47.627 --> 05:54:50.565
&gt;&gt; MY COLLEAGUES ALSO SAY THAT 
THE HOLD ON U.S. SECURITY 

05:54:50.855 --> 05:54:53.701
ASSISTANCE WAS LIFTED ON 
SEPTEMBER 11th WITHOUT ANY 

05:54:53.992 --> 05:54:57.447
INVESTIGATIONS HAPPENING ON THE 
PART OF THE UKRAINIANS AND 

05:54:57.717 --> 05:55:02.157
THEREFORE EVERYTHING ENDED UP 
FINE IN THE END. HOWEVER, MR. 

05:55:03.364 --> 05:55:08.063
KENT, AS YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE 
INTELLIGENCE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND

05:55:08.347 --> 05:55:11.884
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES BEGAN THIS 
CURRENT INVESTIGATION LEADING TO

05:55:12.163 --> 05:55:16.881
THE PROCEEDINGS TODAY ON 
SEPTEMBER 9th. IN FACT, IT WAS 

05:55:17.172 --> 05:55:21.293
ONLY TWO DAYS AFTER THIS 
PARTICULAR SET OF COMMITTEES 

05:55:21.572 --> 05:55:24.893
BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

05:55:25.702 --> 05:55:28.401
EVENTUALLY RELEASED THE MILITARY
AID. CORRECT? 

05:55:28.402 --> 05:55:32.917
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A TIMELINE, YES. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, BETWEEN 

05:55:33.190 --> 05:55:35.811
THE TIME OF YOUR OCTOBER 
DEPOSITION AND NOW, DID ANYONE 

05:55:36.100 --> 05:55:39.193
FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
CONTACT YOU ABOUT YOUR 

05:55:39.475 --> 05:55:41.030
APPEARANCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE 
TODAY? 

05:55:41.031 --> 05:55:45.364
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT YOU MR. KENT? 

05:55:45.365 --> 05:55:47.465
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, I WOULD 

05:55:47.773 --> 05:55:53.413
LIKE TO RETURN TO A WORD THAT 
YOU USED 13 TIMES IN YOUR 

05:55:53.745 --> 05:55:57.307
OPENING STATEMENT. THAT WORD IS 
CONCERN. YOU WERE CONCERNED AID 

05:55:57.618 --> 05:55:59.618
WAS BEING CONDITIONED ON 
POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS. ISN'T 

05:55:59.785 --> 05:56:01.220
THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:56:01.221 --> 05:56:03.948
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE CONCERNED THAT 
IRREGULAR CHANNELS OF DIPLOMACY 

05:56:04.228 --> 05:56:09.226
WERE BEING USED IN OUR FOREIGN 
POLICY IN THE UKRAINE; RIGHT? 

05:56:09.497 --> 05:56:12.329
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, CAN YOU 

05:56:12.605 --> 05:56:17.700
RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT 
THESE IRREGULAR CHANNELS OF 

05:56:17.969 --> 05:56:21.913
DIPLOMACIES ARE BEING USED IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES. WHERE 

05:56:25.692 --> 05:56:31.398
WE CONDUCT FOREIGN POLICY? 
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T -- I'VE NOT HEARD OF 

05:56:31.756 --> 05:56:36.767
ANY OTHER OF SEPARATE CHANNELS 
THAT HAS THIS KIND OF INFLUENCE.

05:56:37.045 --> 05:56:39.513
THAT IS THE GULIANI KIND OF 
GUIDANCE. 

05:56:39.514 --> 05:56:41.927
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN'T RULE IT OUT; 
RIGHT? 

05:56:41.928 --> 05:56:44.836
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT YOU MR. KENT? YOU 

05:56:45.122 --> 05:56:48.767
CAN'T RULE IT OUT EITHER. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO BASIS TO MAKE A 

05:56:49.052 --> 05:56:51.203
DETERMINATION. 
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE 

05:56:51.480 --> 05:56:53.480
JULY 25th 

05:56:57.188 --> 05:57:00.551
CALL WAS PERFECT. DO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK SOME OF THE LANGUAGE 

05:57:00.832 --> 05:57:03.428
IN THE CALL GAVE CAUSE FOR 
CONCERN. 

05:57:03.429 --> 05:57:05.114
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR? 
&gt;&gt; I AGREE. 

05:57:05.115 --> 05:57:09.526
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE CAUSE FOR 
CONCERN FOR YOU? 

05:57:09.527 --> 05:57:14.047
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS PART -- THE 
DISCUSSION OF THE PREVIOUS 

05:57:14.330 --> 05:57:18.287
AMBASSADOR WAS A CAUSE FOR 
CONCERN. 

05:57:18.288 --> 05:57:22.580
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, I WANT TO 
DRAW ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A 

05:57:22.856 --> 05:57:27.133
WEST POINT CADET AND INFANTRY 
COMMANDER IN VIETNAM. IN A 

05:57:27.417 --> 05:57:29.858
BATTLEFIELD SITUATION, IS A 
COMMANDING OFFICER ABLE TO HOLD 

05:57:30.144 --> 05:57:33.124
UP ACTION, PLACING HIS TROOPS AT
RISK UNTIL SOMEONE PROVIDES HIM 

05:57:33.404 --> 05:57:35.513
A PERSONAL BENEFIT? 
&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. 

05:57:35.514 --> 05:57:40.350
&gt;&gt; IS THAT BECAUSE IF COMMANDING
OFFICERS DID THAT, THEY WOULD BE

05:57:40.631 --> 05:57:43.185
BETRAYING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY 
TO THE NATION AND MEN AND WOMEN 

05:57:43.473 --> 05:57:45.159
UNDER THEIR COMMAND? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:57:45.160 --> 05:57:50.728
&gt;&gt; AND IF THAT WERE HAPPENED AND
FOUND OUT, COULD THAT PERSON BE 

05:57:51.019 --> 05:57:53.725
SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE. WOULD 
&gt;&gt; WOULD THAT KIND OF TARGET 

05:57:54.021 --> 05:57:55.837
TRIGGER A COURT-MARTIAL? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

05:57:55.838 --> 05:57:59.014
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, I 

05:58:02.532 --> 05:58:04.660
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN. I HAVE AN 

05:58:04.943 --> 05:58:07.946
UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ENTER INTO 
THE RECORD WHERE MR. MULVANEY 

05:58:08.232 --> 05:58:17.767
SAID THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO. 
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT OBJECTION. 

05:58:17.768 --> 05:58:22.751
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE MR. NUNES FOR HIS

05:58:23.035 --> 05:58:25.035
COMMENTS. WE 

05:58:26.583 --> 05:58:29.518
WILL GET YOUR MOTION. AFTER MR. 
NUNES BRIEF CLOSING MARKS. WE'LL

05:58:29.789 --> 05:58:33.262
HAVE A VERY BRIEF RECESS. 
MEMBERS SHOULD NOT GO FAR. WE 

05:58:34.984 --> 05:58:39.018
WILL RESUME AND TAKE IN MR. 
CONWAY'S MOTION. 

05:58:39.019 --> 05:58:43.350
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. I
WANT TO REITERATE WHAT I SAID 

05:58:43.655 --> 05:58:47.937
EARLIER. THAT IS WE SHOULD STOP 
HOLDING THESE HEARINGS UNTIL WE 

05:58:48.258 --> 05:58:51.177
GET THE ANSWER TO THREE 
IMPORTANT TOPICS. THE FIRST 

05:58:51.466 --> 05:58:56.574
BEING THE FULL EXTENT OF THE 
DEMOCRATS PRIOR COORDINATION OF 

05:58:56.880 --> 05:59:00.009
THE WHISTLE BROADWAYER. AND WHO 
DID THE WHISTLEBLOWER COORDINATE

05:59:00.284 --> 05:59:07.832
WITH. AND SECOND THE FULL EXTENT
OF THE UKRAINE'S ELECTION 

05:59:08.578 --> 05:59:10.578
MEDDLING. AND THIRD, 

05:59:13.610 --> 05:59:20.205
WHY DID BARRIS MA HIRE -- YOU 
ARE NOT ALLOWING THOSE WITNESSES

05:59:21.633 --> 05:59:26.459
TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 
WHICH I THINK IS A PROBLEM. SO 

05:59:26.742 --> 05:59:30.725
WE WILL EXPECT, HOPEFULLY, YOU 
WILL ALLOWS TO BRING IN THE 

05:59:31.041 --> 05:59:37.164
WHISTLEBLOWER. THE FOLKS THAT HE
SPOKE TO AND ALSO NUMEROUS 

05:59:37.463 --> 05:59:40.357
DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES WHO WORKED
WITH UKRAINE TO MEDDLE IN THE 

05:59:40.706 --> 05:59:42.784
ELECTION. FROM THAT I WILL YIELD
BACK. 

05:59:42.785 --> 05:59:47.904
&gt;&gt; I THANK THE GENTLEMAN. I WANT
TO THANK THE WITNESSES FOR THEIR

05:59:48.180 --> 05:59:54.076
TESTIMONY TODAY. FOR YOUR 
DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE 

05:59:54.379 --> 05:59:59.896
COUNTRY. I THINK YOU EXEMPLIFY 
SO MANY COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN

06:00:00.712 --> 06:00:03.940
WHO SERVED ON THE DIPLOMATIC 
CORE, IN THE MILITARY. WHO 

06:00:04.487 --> 06:00:07.813
SERVED THE UNITED STATES SO WELL
AROUND THE WORLD. I APPRECIATE 

06:00:08.139 --> 06:00:12.070
HOW YOU ENDEAVOR TO STAY OUT OF 
THE FRAY, TO RELAY WHAT YOU 

06:00:12.820 --> 06:00:15.993
HEARD, WHAT YOU SAW WITHOUT 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY. THAT IS 

06:00:16.313 --> 06:00:20.447
AS IT SHOULD BE. YOU ARE BOTH 
COMPELLED TO APPEAR AND WE ARE 

06:00:21.355 --> 06:00:26.460
GRATEFUL THAT YOU ANSWERED THE 
LAWFUL SUBPOENAS THAT YOU 

06:00:26.741 --> 06:00:29.920
RECEIVED. THE STORY THAT YOU 
HAVE SHARED WITH US TODAY AND 

06:00:30.206 --> 06:00:36.267
YOUR EXPERIENCES I THINK IS A 
VERY DEEPLY TROUBLING ONE. IT IS

06:00:36.564 --> 06:00:44.410
THE STORY OF A DEDICATED 
AMBASSADOR, SOMEONE WHO SERVED 

06:00:44.696 --> 06:00:46.823
WITH GREAT DISTINCTION. 
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH WHO IS 

06:00:47.118 --> 06:00:49.950
THE SUBJECT OF A VICIOUS SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN ADD THE THE BEGINNING 

06:00:50.270 --> 06:00:56.768
OF THE YEAR. IT IS THE STORY OF 
ONCE THIS AMBASSADOR WAS PUSHED 

06:00:57.050 --> 06:01:02.185
OUT OF THE WAY, THE CREATION OF 
AN IRREGULAR CHANNEL WHICH 

06:01:02.474 --> 06:01:06.979
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR YOU DESCRIBED 
WENT ALL THE WAY FROM THE 

06:01:07.255 --> 06:01:15.671
PRESIDENT THROUGH MICK MULVANEY 
TO AMBASSADOR SONDLAND THROUGH 

06:01:15.953 --> 06:01:18.233
AMBASSADOR VOLKER TO RUDY 
GULIANI. THAT OVER TIME BECAME 

06:01:18.541 --> 06:01:21.931
APPARENT WAS NOT SERVING THE 
U.S. INTEREST, BUT RUNNING 

06:01:22.216 --> 06:01:26.622
DEEPLY CONTRARY TO THE U.S. 
INTEREST. WAS IN FACT 

06:01:26.904 --> 06:01:30.043
CONDITIONING A WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING THAT THE PRESIDENT TO 

06:01:30.321 --> 06:01:32.865
UKRAINE DESPERATELY SOUGHT TO 
ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS THE NEW 

06:01:33.135 --> 06:01:36.100
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE AND TO 
PRESIDENT FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE 

06:01:36.382 --> 06:01:43.132
THAT HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH 
HIS MOST POWERFUL PATRON, THE 

06:01:43.409 --> 06:01:47.635
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND 
CONDITIONED $400 MILLION OF 

06:01:47.947 --> 06:01:51.405
BIPARTISAN TAXPAYER FUNDED 
MILITARY SUPPORT FOR A NATION AT

06:01:51.747 --> 06:01:56.962
WAR. ON THE FRONT LINES OF 
RUSSIAN EXPANSIONISM. A 

06:01:57.291 --> 06:02:00.673
SUSPENSION OF WHICH WAS NOT IN 
THE U.S. INTEREST, NOT IN 

06:02:00.992 --> 06:02:03.911
UKRAINE'S INTEREST, NOT IN OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST, AND 

06:02:04.227 --> 06:02:09.766
NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. YOU'VE 
DESCRIBED A SITUATION IN WHICH 

06:02:10.047 --> 06:02:13.329
THOSE IN THE SERVICE OF THE 
PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR TO 

06:02:13.649 --> 06:02:16.532
UKRAINIANS THEY NEED TO PUBLICLY
ANNOUNCE THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR

06:02:16.833 --> 06:02:20.828
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO GET THAT 
MEETING AND THEY SURE WEREN'T 

06:02:21.105 --> 06:02:24.962
GOING TO GET THAT MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE. NOW I WOULD POINT 

06:02:25.244 --> 06:02:29.767
OUT AND THIS MAY NOT HAVE COME 
TO YOUR ATTENTION, BUT IT CAME 

06:02:31.019 --> 06:02:34.448
TO OUR ATTENTION. ON SEPTEMBER 
9th, INSPECTOR GENERAL INFORMED 

06:02:34.733 --> 06:02:39.713
OUR COMMITTEE THAT THE DIRECTOR 
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE WAS 

06:02:40.000 --> 06:02:44.540
WITHHOLDING A WHISTLEBLOWER 
COMPLAINT IN VIOLATION OF THE 

06:02:44.826 --> 06:02:50.450
STATUE. BY THAT POINT ON 
SEPTEMBER 9th, THE COMPLAINT HAD

06:02:50.730 --> 06:02:55.229
MADE ITS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
ON SEPTEMBER 9th WHEN THE 

06:02:55.534 --> 06:02:57.540
INSPECTOR GENERAL INFORMED 
CONGRESS THAT THE COMPLAINT HAD 

06:02:58.132 --> 06:03:01.280
BEEN HELD, THE WHITE HOUSE 
LEARNED THAT CONGRESS WOULD 

06:03:01.583 --> 06:03:06.109
LEARN ABOUT THE COMPLAINT. IT 
WAS LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER 

06:03:06.428 --> 06:03:08.428
THAT THE 

06:03:10.995 --> 06:03:14.544
MILITARY AID WOULD BE RELEASED. 
OVER THE WEEKS TO COME OR OVER 

06:03:14.834 --> 06:03:22.226
THE DAYS TO COME, RATHER, WE 
WOULD HEAR THERE OTHER DEDICATED

06:03:22.690 --> 06:03:26.660
PUBLIC SERVANTS. OTHER ASPECTS 
OF THIS TO CONDITION A WHITE 

06:03:26.963 --> 06:03:30.094
HOUSE MEETING AND MILITARY AID 
FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF POLITICAL

06:03:30.901 --> 06:03:33.744
FAVORS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 
REELECTION CAMPAIGN. WE WILL 

06:03:34.052 --> 06:03:37.286
HEAR FROM OTHER WITNESSES. I 
APPRECIATE MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES

06:03:37.573 --> 06:03:42.552
OF THE AISLE WHO I THINK 
PARTICIPATED TODAY IN A SERIOUS 

06:03:42.830 --> 06:03:47.429
WAY AND IN A CIVIL WAY. THIS IS 
AS IT SHOULD BE. THERE IS NO 

06:03:47.718 --> 06:03:50.525
SHORTAGE OF STRONG FEELINGS 
ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE 

06:03:50.802 --> 06:03:54.472
COUNTRY. AT THE END OF THE DAY 
WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE BASED ON 

06:03:54.759 --> 06:03:58.032
THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU AND OTHERS
PROVIDE WHETHER WE ARE PREPARED 

06:03:58.316 --> 06:04:02.615
TO ACCEPT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
UNITED STATES A SITUATION WHERE 

06:04:02.897 --> 06:04:08.177
THE PRESIDENT FOR THEIR OWN 
PERSONAL OR POLITICAL BENEFIT, 

06:04:08.462 --> 06:04:11.147
CAN CONDITION MILITARY AID, 
DIPLOMATIC MEETINGS, OR ANY 

06:04:11.429 --> 06:04:14.927
OTHER PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICIAL
ACT IN ORDER TO GET HELP IN 

06:04:15.212 --> 06:04:17.826
THEIR REELECTION. WHETHER WE 
WILL NEED TO ACCEPT THIS 

06:04:18.126 --> 06:04:22.486
PRESIDENT OR ANY FUTURE 
PRESIDENT THAT THE IDEA OF THE 

06:04:22.806 --> 06:04:25.992
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
CAN INVITE A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO 

06:04:26.295 --> 06:04:29.552
INTERVENE IN OUR AFFAIRS. THIS 
IS A DECISION WE WILL HAVE TO 

06:04:29.836 --> 06:04:32.383
MAKE WHEN WE DECIDE WHETHER THIS
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. 

06:04:32.679 --> 06:04:36.392
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN. 
JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING BECAUSE 

06:04:36.692 --> 06:04:42.354
I CAN'T LET IT GO UNANSWERED, MY
COLLEAGUES MADE THIS STATEMENT 

06:04:42.634 --> 06:04:45.958
REPEATED THAT I MET WITH THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER THAT I KNOW THE 

06:04:46.246 --> 06:04:50.509
WHISTLEBLOWER. IT WAS FALSE THE 
FIRST TIME THEY SAID IT. IT WAS 

06:04:50.800 --> 06:04:53.983
FALSE THE SECOND TO 
40th TIME THEY SAID IT. IT WILL 

06:04:54.267 --> 06:04:59.947
BE FALSE THE LAST TIME THEY SAID
IT. I ASK EVERYONE TO REMAIN IN 

06:05:00.246 --> 06:05:03.050
THEIR SEATS. THE WITNESSES ARE 
EXCUSED. PLEASE ALLOW THEM TO 

06:05:03.614 --> 06:05:07.586
LEAVE THE COMMITTEE ROOM. ONCE 
THEY LEAVE THE COMMITTEE ROOM, 

06:05:07.904 --> 06:05:16.012
WE WILL TAKE A BRIEF RECESS AND 
THEN WE WILL RESUME TO TAKE UP 

06:05:16.412 --> 06:05:19.392
MR. CONAWAY'S MOTION. ONCE 
AGAIN, I THANK YOU YOU 

06:05:19.393 --> 06:05:26.412
GENTLEMEN. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; AND THE WITNESSES HAVE 

06:05:26.941 --> 06:05:29.879
EXITED THE HEARING ROOM. THE 
SITE OF THIS FIRST IMPEACHMENT 

06:05:30.160 --> 06:05:33.197
HEARING. THE FIRST PUBLIC 
HEARING THAT IS. MANY HAVE 

06:05:33.793 --> 06:05:36.368
HAPPENED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. 
THIS WAS THE PUBLIC'S FIRST TIME

06:05:36.678 --> 06:05:40.655
TO GET A LOOK AT THE PROCESS. 
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING IT LIVE ON 

06:05:40.982 --> 06:05:45.291
THE WASHINGTON POST STREAM. I'M 
JOINED HERE IN OUR STUDIO BY 

06:05:45.582 --> 06:05:48.303
JOHN HUDSON. NATIONAL SECURITY 
REPORTER. AND AMBER PHILLIPS 

06:05:48.742 --> 06:05:51.738
REPORTER FOR THE FIX. REMINDER 
TO EVERYONE WATCHING WE'LL BE 

06:05:52.028 --> 06:05:55.967
RIGHT BACK HERE ON FRIDAY AS 
MARIE YOVANOVITCH THE FORMER 

06:05:56.240 --> 06:05:59.315
AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE TESTIFIES 
BEFORE THIS SAME COMMITTEE. I 

06:05:59.594 --> 06:06:05.055
WANT TO TALK TO YOU JOHN AND 
AMBER ABOUT THE BIGGEST 

06:06:05.333 --> 06:06:08.242
TAKEAWAYS. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR AND
MR. KENT KEPT REPEATING WE ARE 

06:06:08.538 --> 06:06:12.558
NOT HERE TO PUSH AN AGENDA OR BE
ON ANYONE'S SIDE. BUT JOHN, DID 

06:06:12.850 --> 06:06:15.687
THEY ULTIMATELY HELP OR HURT AN 
ARGUMENT HERE THAT REPUBLICANS 

06:06:15.987 --> 06:06:20.143
OR DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE?
&gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER OF

06:06:20.433 --> 06:06:23.196
TIMES THE DEMOCRATS DID COME 
AWAY PRETTY SATISFIED WITH JUST 

06:06:23.475 --> 06:06:26.518
SETTING UP QUESTIONS THAT WERE 
VERY TAILORED TOWARD THEY'RE 

06:06:26.803 --> 06:06:31.237
TESTIMONIES THAT THEY HAD MADE 
PREVIOUSLY. CAN WE GO LINE BY 

06:06:31.530 --> 06:06:34.103
LINE? WHEN DID YOU LEARN ABOUT 
THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE BEING 

06:06:34.508 --> 06:06:37.609
HELD UP? WHAT WERE YOUR 
CONCERNS? AND THEY REALLY STAYED

06:06:39.632 --> 06:06:42.460
TRUE TO THEIR TESTIMONY. THEY 
HELPED VERIFY AND CORROBORATE 

06:06:42.742 --> 06:06:47.462
THE CONCEPT OF A QUID PRO QUO. 
WHAT THEY SAW. THEY SAW CLEARLY 

06:06:47.752 --> 06:06:50.894
IN THEIR VIEWS THE UNITED STATES
LEVERAGING THIS MILITARY 

06:06:51.177 --> 06:06:54.763
ASSISTANCE IN EXCHANGE FOR GOING
AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL 

06:06:55.048 --> 06:06:58.064
RIVALS. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE 
FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THERE WAS 

06:06:58.334 --> 06:07:04.675
SOME FRUSTRATION THAT SOME OF 
THE INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS GEORGE 

06:07:05.546 --> 06:07:07.580
KENT WERE WILLING TO 
SUBSTANCEUATE SOME OF THEIR 

06:07:07.877 --> 06:07:13.362
VIEWS. ONE THING THEY WERE 
TRYING TO PROP UP IS THIS 

06:07:13.652 --> 06:07:17.107
CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT UKRAINE 
WAS INTERFERING IN THE 2016 

06:07:17.773 --> 06:07:23.009
ELECTION AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD
EVERY RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL. 

06:07:23.298 --> 06:07:27.692
GEORGE KENT, THE DEPUTY 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATESAID

06:07:28.819 --> 06:07:32.523
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WAS TRUE.
AND THERE WAS SOME FRUSTRATION 

06:07:32.795 --> 06:07:36.679
BY SOME OF THE QUESTIONNAIRES IN
PARTICULARLY, INCLUDING THE TOP 

06:07:36.961 --> 06:07:40.148
REPUBLICAN LAWYER WHO SAID I'M 
JUST GOING TO SKIP YOU ON THIS 

06:07:40.442 --> 06:07:44.629
QUESTION AND MOVE ON TO 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR. AND SO, THERE

06:07:44.908 --> 06:07:47.258
WAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY. THE
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T LOSE 

06:07:47.534 --> 06:07:52.309
EVERYTHING. THEY WENT TO KENT 
AND ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS CONCERNS

06:07:52.582 --> 06:07:58.966
ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN TAKING A 
BOARD SEAT. AND HE STATED VERY 

06:07:59.259 --> 06:08:04.673
CLEARLY, IT WAS HIS VIEW THAT 
THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF 

06:08:05.120 --> 06:08:08.316
INTEREST WAS A PROBLEM. AND TO 
HAVE JOE BIDEN'S SON ON THIS 

06:08:08.600 --> 06:08:12.793
BOARD WHILE JOE BIDEN WAS 
RUNNING UKRAINE POLICY WAS A 

06:08:13.069 --> 06:08:16.120
PROBLEM. AND HE CALLED UPON IT. 
AND THE VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE 

06:08:16.416 --> 06:08:19.771
THE THE TIME DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
BACK. SO IN THAT WAY THE 

06:08:20.060 --> 06:08:23.401
REPUBLICANS GOT SOMETHING FROM 
THIS. BUT IN GENERAL YOU SAW THE

06:08:23.691 --> 06:08:26.817
DEMOCRATS GETTING FURTHER 
CONFIRMATION FOR THIS MAIN THEME

06:08:27.099 --> 06:08:29.907
AND NARRATIVE THEY'VE BEEN 
TRYING TO BUILD UP. AND 

06:08:30.192 --> 06:08:32.435
REPUBLICANS LARGELY BEING 
FRUSTRATED, TRYING TO CHIP AWAY 

06:08:32.724 --> 06:08:36.647
AT THEIR CREDIBILITY IN GENERAL.
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO POINT OUT, YOU CAN 

06:08:36.930 --> 06:08:39.752
SEE THERE INSIDE OUR LARGER BOX 
THE WHITE HOUSE. WHERE WE'RE 

06:08:40.127 --> 06:08:42.127
AWAITING PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE MAY
COME 

06:08:45.511 --> 06:08:53.179
OUT SHORTLY AND MAKE COMMENTS 
WITH PRESIDENT OF TURKEY. WE 

06:08:53.460 --> 06:08:57.250
EXPECT THEM TO COME OUT SHORTLY.
IF IT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT LITTLE

06:08:59.102 --> 06:09:03.072
WHILE, WE WILL BRING THAT TO YOU
LIVE. AMBER, WHILE WE KEEP OUR 

06:09:03.411 --> 06:09:07.949
EYE ON THE WHITE HOUSE, I WANT 
TO HEAR YOUR TOP TAKEAWAYS. 

06:09:07.950 --> 06:09:12.410
&gt;&gt; YES. I WROTE THEM DOWN. I 
THINK THE TWO DIPLOMATS 

06:09:12.733 --> 06:09:15.732
TESTIFIED THERE WAS A CONCERTED 
EFFORT BY PEOPLE IN TRUMP'S 

06:09:16.053 --> 06:09:18.960
ORBIT TO FORCE UKRAINE TO 
INVESTIGATE DEMOCRATS. AND THEY 

06:09:19.287 --> 06:09:22.680
SAW THAT UNDER MINE U.S. 
INTEREST AND NATIONAL SECURITY. 

06:09:23.009 --> 06:09:25.318
TAYLOR AND KENT FRAMED 
THEMSELVES AS A WHISTLEBLOWER IN

06:09:25.610 --> 06:09:28.964
A WAY. AS I SAID EARLIER, TAYLOR
WAS REPORTING OUT ALL OF THESE 

06:09:29.238 --> 06:09:32.810
ASPECTS. AND WHEN IT QUIT FOR 
HIM IT'S LIKE OH MY GOODNESS, 

06:09:33.094 --> 06:09:36.579
THIS IS BAD NEWS. AND HE IS 
ALREADY MAN WILLING TO GO IN 

06:09:37.084 --> 06:09:42.926
FRONT OF CONGRESS AND SHARE 
EVERY SINGLE DETAIL DAY BY DAY 

06:09:43.197 --> 06:09:47.912
IN WHAT HE FELT WAS A CLEAR 
EFFORT TO GIVE UKRAINE A QUID 

06:09:48.194 --> 06:09:50.793
PRO QUO. 
&gt;&gt; TAYLOR TESTIFIED ABOUT A 

06:09:51.077 --> 06:09:54.395
REGULAR CHANNEL AND IRREGULAR 
CHANNEL OF POLICYMAKING. THE 

06:09:55.302 --> 06:09:58.878
REPUBLICANS LAWYERS TRIED TO 
DOWN PLAY THAT DESCRIPTION OF 

06:09:59.166 --> 06:10:04.538
IRREGULAR CHANNEL. LET'S WATCH. 
&gt;&gt; AND THE SECOND MEMBER OF THE 

06:10:04.814 --> 06:10:11.000
IRREGULAR CHANNEL IS AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND. WHO IS SENATE 

06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:17.049
CONFIRMED. AMBASSADOR TO THE EU.
HIS INVOLVEMENT IS CERTAINLY NOT

06:10:17.322 --> 06:10:24.164
OUT LANDISH FOR HIM TO BE 
INTERESTED AND ENGAGED PURSUANT 

06:10:24.811 --> 06:10:27.878
TO THE PRESIDENT OR POMPEO'S 
DIRECTION. 

06:10:27.879 --> 06:10:32.572
&gt;&gt; IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THE U.S. 
AMBASSADOR TO THE EU TO PLAY A 

06:10:32.855 --> 06:10:36.975
ROLE IN UKRAINE POLICY. 
&gt;&gt; AND IT MIGHT BE IRREGULAR, 

06:10:37.258 --> 06:10:42.492
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT OUT 
LANDISH. AND THEN SECRETARY 

06:10:42.777 --> 06:10:49.193
PERRY IS THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE
IRREGULAR CHANNEL. 

06:10:49.474 --> 06:10:52.202
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR TAYLOR'S RESPONSE 
THERE AND THINGS WRITTEN ON HIS 

06:10:52.562 --> 06:10:56.242
FACE SAID A LOT. AMBER, YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY 

06:10:56.546 --> 06:10:59.602
ABOUT THIS. 
&gt;&gt; I FEEL YOU ARE PLAYING THIS 

06:10:59.876 --> 06:11:03.843
CONVERSATION FOR A REASON 
BECAUSE IT IS THE HEADLINE OF 

06:11:04.157 --> 06:11:07.794
REPUBLICANS REBUTTAL TO ALL OF 
THIS. WHAT HE SAID WAS, WELL, 

06:11:08.676 --> 06:11:13.104
IT'S NOT THAT OUT LANDISH. I 
FEEL LIKE TO SOME DEGREE THAT 

06:11:13.395 --> 06:11:16.973
EPITOMIZES WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE
IN TRYING TO DRAW THE LINE ON 

06:11:17.257 --> 06:11:21.366
WHAT IS IMPEACHABLE. IT'S NOT 
THAT OUT LANDISH. 

06:11:21.367 --> 06:11:25.604
&gt;&gt; I FELT IT WAS STRANGE MAYBE A
MISREAD OF WHERE TAYLOR IS ON 

06:11:25.920 --> 06:11:29.040
THIS SITUATION. I THINK WHERE 
CASTOR WAS COMING, THERE IS A 

06:11:29.325 --> 06:11:32.380
HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS IN 
U.S. PRESIDENTS TAPPING 

06:11:32.663 --> 06:11:37.305
OUTSIDERS. TO HELP THEM ON 
FOREIGN POLICY. TO GETTING 

06:11:37.753 --> 06:11:41.275
COUNSELED FROM OUTSIDERS. BUT IN
THIS SITUATION, YOU HAVE THE 

06:11:41.556 --> 06:11:45.790
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY 
WHO DOESN'T REALLY HAVEAN 

06:11:46.096 --> 06:11:48.332
EXPERTISE. 
&gt;&gt; RUDY GULIANI. 

06:11:48.333 --> 06:11:51.632
&gt;&gt; RUDY GULIANI. AND YOU ALSO 
HAVE TENSE TESTIMONY WHICH IS 

06:11:52.636 --> 06:11:55.737
BASICALLY A LAUNDRY LIST OF 
FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE WAY THAT 

06:11:57.166 --> 06:12:02.650
GULIANI WAS CONDUCTING THAT 
SHADOW CAMPAIGN. AND SO, TO FIND

06:12:04.730 --> 06:12:10.690
KENT AS SOME SORT OF SYMPATHETIC
VOICE TOWARD THIS CHANNEL IS AN 

06:12:10.995 --> 06:12:14.341
INTERESTING LINE. HE STUCK HIS 
NECK OUT A LITTLE BIT TO GET AN 

06:12:14.638 --> 06:12:17.362
ANSWER THERE. AND TAYLOR 
OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT GOING TO HELP 

06:12:19.071 --> 06:12:22.519
HIM IN THAT SITUATION. AND IT 
WAS PRETTY CLEAR WAS NOT WILLING

06:12:22.802 --> 06:12:26.252
TO DOWN PLAY WHAT HE VIEWED AS 
AN IRREGULAR CHANNEL THAT WAS 

06:12:26.529 --> 06:12:29.718
WORKING AGAINST THE INTEREST 
THAT HE WAS PLAYING FOR. LET'S 

06:12:30.226 --> 06:12:34.089
REMEMBER IT WAS HIS VIEW THAT HE
WAS GOING TO COME OUT OF 

06:12:34.366 --> 06:12:37.084
RETIREMENT AND TAKE THIS 
POSITION IN UKRAINE. AND TRY TO 

06:12:39.282 --> 06:12:44.278
HELP WHAT HE VIEWED AS A 
FLEDGLING GOVERNMENT THAT WAS 

06:12:45.152 --> 06:12:47.710
FIGHTING OFF RUSSIAN BACKED 
SEPARATIST. FOR HIM IT WAS 

06:12:48.016 --> 06:12:50.301
IMPORTANT FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
TO GET A PRESIDENTIAL MEETING 

06:12:50.619 --> 06:12:53.941
FOR THE MILITARY AID TO FLOW. 
AND THOSE THINGS WERE BEING 

06:12:54.241 --> 06:12:58.469
STOPPED IN HIS VIEW AS WE ALL 
SAW ON THE TEXT MESSAGE, IT WAS 

06:12:58.752 --> 06:13:02.728
CRAZY THAT WASN'T HAPPENING. 
THAT WAS TAYLOR FIGHTING THIS 

06:13:03.014 --> 06:13:06.430
IRREGULAR CHANNEL THE WHOLE WAY 
THROUGH. SO IT MIGHT NOT BE 

06:13:06.708 --> 06:13:09.584
OUTLANDISH. BUT IT WASN'T GOING 
TO BE SOMETHING HE WOULD DEFEND,

06:13:09.988 --> 06:13:14.891
AND IT BLEW UP IN HIS FACE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU TRY TO GET A SENSE OF 

06:13:15.204 --> 06:13:18.210
WHAT STEVE CASTER, THE COUNSEL 
TO REPUBLICANS WAS GETTING AT. I

06:13:18.495 --> 06:13:22.162
HAD A HARD TIME GRABBING IT BY 
THE TAIL A COUPLE OF TIMES. DID 

06:13:22.439 --> 06:13:27.070
YOU FEEL HE WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW 
THROUGH? HE HAD THIS 

06:13:27.635 --> 06:13:29.053
UNINTERRUPTED, LARGELY 
UNINTERRUPTED ALTHOUGH CHAIRMAN 

06:13:29.054 --> 06:13:34.077
SCHIFF DID POP IN AT ONE POINT. 
LARGELY UNINTERRUPTED FLOOR. AN 

06:13:34.358 --> 06:13:37.653
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A CASE LIKE
YOU WOULD IN A TRIAL, AND LAND 

06:13:37.930 --> 06:13:41.796
HOME HIS ARGUMENT. DID YOU GET A
SENSE IF HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT.

06:13:42.067 --> 06:13:44.749
OR HE TOOK A COUPLE DIFFERENT 
APPROACHES AND IT DIDN'T 

06:13:45.032 --> 06:13:49.699
NECESSARILY AMOUNT TO PERHAPS AS
MUCH AS SOME REPUBLICANS HOPED 

06:13:49.979 --> 06:13:52.278
IT WOULD. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I 42 IT WAS CHALLENGING

06:13:52.564 --> 06:13:57.760
FOR THEM TO DO THAT. THESE WERE 
TWO DIPLOMATS THAT WERE HIP SET.

06:13:58.038 --> 06:14:03.648
AND SO THE ONLY REAL WAY TO 
REALLY MAKE THEM LESS EFFECTIVE 

06:14:04.228 --> 06:14:08.015
IN THIS SORT OF PUBLIC SPECT 
CALL THAT IS AN OPEN IMPEACHMENT

06:14:08.296 --> 06:14:11.184
HEARING IS TO ATTACK THEIR 
CREDIBILITY. AND THAT IS ALSO A 

06:14:11.468 --> 06:14:14.582
DIFFICULT THING TO DO, OF 
COURSE. HE DIDN'T GO DOWN THAT 

06:14:14.856 --> 06:14:17.437
ROUTE. AND YOU DID SEE SOME 
OTHER REPUBLICANS TRY 

06:14:21.696 --> 06:14:25.092
TO TAKE AWAY THEIR CREDIBILITY. 
TO THE EXTENT WITH HE WAS 

06:14:25.546 --> 06:14:28.197
CHALLENGING THEIR ACCOUNT, HIS 
STRATEGY WAS THEY DIDN'T HAVE 

06:14:28.484 --> 06:14:31.105
FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WITH HIM. 
AND SOME OF HIS OTHER REPUBLICAN

06:14:31.394 --> 06:14:36.479
COLLEAGUES UNDER SCORE THAT EVEN
MORE THAN HE DID. BUT THAT WAS 

06:14:36.781 --> 06:14:40.861
HIS TACTIC. AND YOU DID SEE HIM 
STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT. NONE 

06:14:41.154 --> 06:14:44.952
MORE THAN IN THE CLIP YOU JUST 
FEATURED. THAT REALLY BLEW UP IN

06:14:45.227 --> 06:14:47.346
FACE. 
&gt;&gt; OUR COLLEAGUE RON HAS BEEN ON

06:14:47.621 --> 06:14:50.951
CAPITOL HILL AND INSIDE THAT 
HEARING ROOM IN LONGWORTH 

06:14:51.222 --> 06:14:56.828
MONITORING THINGS THROUGHOUT THE
DAY. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR 

06:14:57.271 --> 06:14:59.271
TOP TAKEAWAYS. 
&gt;&gt; WELL, IN GENERAL, LIBBY, OVER

06:14:59.486 --> 06:15:02.820
ALL, YOU CAN TELL THERE IS A LOT
OF INTEREST IN THESE TESTIMONIES

06:15:03.108 --> 06:15:05.988
TODAY. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE
HEARING. AT FIRST I NOTICED 

06:15:06.260 --> 06:15:09.826
THERE WAS A LINE OF CONGRESSMEN 
AND WOMEN THAT ARE NOT ON THIS 

06:15:10.105 --> 06:15:12.994
COMMITTEE THAT WERE SEATED IN 
THE AUDIENCE. AND THAT IS VERY 

06:15:13.275 --> 06:15:16.281
RARE. MOSTLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS 
ATTEND THEIR OWN COMMITTEES 37. 

06:15:16.579 --> 06:15:19.014
BUT THERE WERE MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS WATCHING WHAT WAS 

06:15:19.293 --> 06:15:21.899
HAPPENING TODAY FROM THE 
AUDIENCE. AND I CAN HEAR THEM 

06:15:22.185 --> 06:15:25.387
MAKE SOUNDS AND SPEAK TO 
THEMSELVES ABOUT WHAT THEY HEARD

06:15:25.661 --> 06:15:28.907
AND REACTING IN REALTIME. MANY 
SAID THEY WANTED TO HEAR WHAT 

06:15:29.190 --> 06:15:33.226
WAS GOING ON. SOME OF THEM 
BELONGED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT 

06:15:33.760 --> 06:15:37.443
IS PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION. 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND 

06:15:37.728 --> 06:15:40.473
ALSO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS 
WELL AS OVERSIGHT. THEY WANTED 

06:15:40.749 --> 06:15:44.143
TO BE A PART OF THIS TODAY AND 
HEAR AND HAVE THEIR OWN 

06:15:44.430 --> 06:15:46.745
TAKEAWAYS. SO THAT WAS 
INTERESTING TO SEE MEMBERS THERE

06:15:47.031 --> 06:15:49.453
AND LISTENING AND BEING ENGAGED 
IN TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS. ANOTHER 

06:15:49.736 --> 06:15:55.530
THING THAT I NOTICED TOO, AND I 
THINK SOMEONE TALKED ABOUT THE 

06:15:55.821 --> 06:15:57.821
REPUBLICANS TACTIC TODAY. THE 
REPUBLICANS UTILIZED THEIR HARD 

06:15:58.027 --> 06:16:05.827
LINE MEMBERS A LOT TODAY. 
REPRESENTATIVEBRANT CLIFF OF 

06:16:06.101 --> 06:16:08.910
TEXAS. JIM JORDON OF OHIO. JIM 
JORDON WAS ADDED TO THIS 

06:16:09.200 --> 06:16:12.494
COMMITTEE LATE LAST WEEK. HE WAS
NOT A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE 

06:16:12.771 --> 06:16:15.383
UNTIL KEVIN PUT HIM ON LAST 
WEEK. BECAUSE THEY WANTED 

06:16:15.656 --> 06:16:18.855
SOMEONE THAT WOULD BE VERY VOCAL
AND CHALLENGE THESE WITNESSES. 

06:16:19.155 --> 06:16:22.441
SO THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO 
SEE. MANY MEMBERS GAVE UP THEIR 

06:16:22.734 --> 06:16:26.827
TIME AND YIELDED A FEW MINUTES 
AND SECONDS TO THOSE MEMBERS. SO

06:16:27.167 --> 06:16:34.212
I THINK THIS MAY HAVE SET THE 
STAGE FOR WHAT WE MIGHT SEE ON 

06:16:34.498 --> 06:16:37.904
FRIDAY WITH FORMER AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH WHEN SHE COMES. THE 

06:16:38.193 --> 06:16:42.102
TWO WITNESSES DISCUSS HOW THEY 
LOOK UP TO HER AND HOW SHE WAS 

06:16:42.393 --> 06:16:45.325
TREATED UNFAIRLY. AGAIN, WE WILL
BE HERE ON FRIDAY AND REPORT 

06:16:45.612 --> 06:16:49.574
BACK ON WHAT HAPPENS THEN. 
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, GREAT, THANKS SO 

06:16:49.853 --> 06:16:52.671
MUCH. LIVE ON CAPITOL HILL. THE 
REPUBLICANS TOOK A COUPLE 

06:16:53.036 --> 06:16:56.266
DIFFERENT TACTICS TO TRY TO 
MINIMIZE OR DISMISS THE CONCERNS

06:16:56.564 --> 06:17:00.545
THAT DEMOCRATS ARE RAISING. ONE 
OF THEM WHAT IS INTERESTING 

06:17:00.835 --> 06:17:05.065
BECAUSE IT WAS ELYSE AND WILL 
HERD. WILL HERD IS A MODERATE 

06:17:05.356 --> 06:17:10.901
REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS. SOMEONE 
WHO HAS BEEN ABLE TO CRITICIZE 

06:17:11.194 --> 06:17:14.537
PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT THEY DID 
NOT LEAVE ANY CRACK OPEN IN A 

06:17:15.172 --> 06:17:18.854
DOOR FRAME EVEN A GUESS OF MIGHT
THEY SUPPORT IMPEACHMENT. THEY 

06:17:19.141 --> 06:17:22.143
MADE THE CASE OF HEY, UKRAINE 
GOT MILITARY ASSISTANCE. IN 

06:17:22.469 --> 06:17:27.962
FACT, THEY GOT SOME THINGS THEY 
DIDN'T GET UNDER THE OBAMA 

06:17:28.359 --> 06:17:30.753
ADMINISTRATION. AND CORRUPTION 
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A CONCERN

06:17:31.044 --> 06:17:35.199
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE ACCORDING TO
CONGRESSMAN STEPHONIC. AND SHE 

06:17:35.473 --> 06:17:39.901
HAD THE WITNESSES TESTIFY TO THE
FACT THAT CORRUPTION HAS BEEN A 

06:17:40.253 --> 06:17:43.235
CONCERN ABOUT UKRAINE GENERALLY.
SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? IF 

06:17:43.733 --> 06:17:47.185
THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO BE 
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 

06:17:47.506 --> 06:17:50.145
THIS MOMENT? 
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DON'T SEE ANY 

06:17:50.436 --> 06:17:53.332
EVIDENCE OF REPUBLICAN 
DEFECTIONS IN THE HOUSE AT THIS 

06:17:53.636 --> 06:17:57.633
POINT. I SEE ALMOST EVERYONE TO 
A TEE. INCLUDING RETIRING 

06:17:57.961 --> 06:18:01.909
MEMBERS LIKE WILL HERD THAT 
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT TO LOSE 

06:18:02.389 --> 06:18:05.335
POLITICALLY. DEFENDING PRESIDENT
TRUMP. AND THAT IS GOOD FOR 

06:18:05.611 --> 06:18:09.050
PRESIDENT TRUMP. IN THE EXTENT 
WHEN THE HOUSE VOTE IN A MONTH 

06:18:09.338 --> 06:18:13.660
OR TWO ABOUT WHAT AN IMPEACH 
TRUMP, ALL DEMOCRATS YES. ALL 

06:18:13.951 --> 06:18:16.699
REPUBLICANS NO. THE PRESIDENT 
CAN SAY LOOK, THIS WAS THE 

06:18:17.027 --> 06:18:19.045
PARTISAN EXERCISE AND THAT I 
THINK BOLSTERS SENATE 

06:18:19.346 --> 06:18:22.665
REPUBLICANS TO HELP BACK HIM UP 
AS WELL. 

06:18:22.666 --> 06:18:26.096
&gt;&gt; ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT JIM 
JORDAN MADE AND RHONDA POINTED 

06:18:26.386 --> 06:18:29.835
OUT HE WAS BROUGHT IN TO BE THAT
ATTACK CHARACTER. HE AT ONE 

06:18:30.133 --> 06:18:35.121
POINT TRIED TO MAKE IT FEEL 
CONFUSING, JOHN. HE WAS READING 

06:18:35.408 --> 06:18:38.446
SOMETHING TO AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
ABOUT WHAT SONDLAND HAD SAID. 

06:18:38.743 --> 06:18:42.537
AND IT WAS A LOT OF NAMES, IT 
WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION. BUT 

06:18:42.817 --> 06:18:45.979
ULTIMATELY AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WAS
LIKE IT MAKES SENSE TO ME. EVEN 

06:18:46.261 --> 06:18:51.587
THOUGH JORDAN IS DISMISSING IT 
AND TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

06:18:51.874 --> 06:18:55.566
A WORD SALAD. 
&gt;&gt; JORDAN IS AWARE THAT THE 

06:18:56.059 --> 06:18:59.978
AVERAGE AMERICAN VIEWER TUNING 
IN IS NOT GOING TO BE INTENSELY 

06:19:00.281 --> 06:19:09.373
AWARE OF WHO THE X UKRAINIAN 
PERHAPS CUE TOUR WAS. 

06:19:09.653 --> 06:19:14.480
AND SO, THESE PEOPLE ARE 
BECOMING HOUSEHOLD NAMES, WE'RE 

06:19:14.767 --> 06:19:18.899
DOING MORE REPORTING ON IT TO 
MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE 

06:19:19.170 --> 06:19:24.032
VARIOUS CAST OF CHARACTERS ON 
ALL SIDES. BUT THE REPUBLICANS 

06:19:24.429 --> 06:19:31.863
DO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE THAT AN 
INVESTIGATION ON THE MURKY UNDER

06:19:34.387 --> 06:19:38.567
WORLD OF UKRAINIAN POLITICS IS 
AN EXERCISE. SO IT IS TRUE THAT 

06:19:40.108 --> 06:19:43.370
NOT EVERYONE THESE NAMES DON'T 
RESINATE IN A REALLY BIG WAY. SO

06:19:43.655 --> 06:19:47.639
THAT IS THE CHALLENGE THAT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE OF ESTABLISHING A

06:19:48.086 --> 06:19:50.127
CLEAR NARRATIVE AND SOMETHING 
THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE. AND 

06:19:50.400 --> 06:19:52.693
SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY 
DIFFICULT A NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS 

06:19:52.991 --> 06:19:56.711
WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE IN THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE THERE WAS

06:19:57.010 --> 06:20:00.707
A LOT OF SHADOWY CHARACTERS AND 
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO WRAP YOUR 

06:20:00.989 --> 06:20:05.128
HEAD AROUND. WHAT DEMOCRATS SAY,
THEY HAVE A CLEAR NARRATIVE THIS

06:20:05.420 --> 06:20:09.325
TIME. WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE
EASY FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. 

06:20:09.635 --> 06:20:14.511
THIS COUNTRY NEEDED MILITARY AID
VERY MUCH. THE PRESIDENT WANTED 

06:20:15.085 --> 06:20:20.225
THEM TO INVESTIGATE HIS 
POLITICAL RIVAL. QUID PRO QUO. 

06:20:20.501 --> 06:20:23.343
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS CAN POINT OUT HOW 

06:20:23.629 --> 06:20:27.612
DIFFICULT THIS NARRATIVE IS TO 
UNDERSTAND, THEY ARE DEFINITELY 

06:20:27.896 --> 06:20:29.896
DOING THAT. 

06:20:31.280 --> 06:20:38.371
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE THE TWO PEOPLE WE 
ARE TALKING TO ARE THE MOST 

06:20:38.666 --> 06:20:43.775
EXPERIENCED. AND SO MR. TAYLOR, 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR SAYS WHAT I'M 

06:20:44.054 --> 06:20:49.337
READING, WHAT I'M HEARING YOU 
SAY FROM AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, HE

06:20:49.613 --> 06:20:53.185
REMEMBERS IT THE SAME WAY I DO. 
AND WHEN JORDAN KEPT GOING WITH 

06:20:53.461 --> 06:20:56.888
IT ABOUT HOW IT DIDN'T REALLY 
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE, TAYLOR SAID

06:20:57.174 --> 06:21:02.638
IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME. SO HE'S 
TRYING TO BUTTON THAT UP. 

06:21:02.937 --> 06:21:06.963
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A BUNCH OF 
CONFUSING NAMES, THIS IS THEIR 

06:21:07.241 --> 06:21:10.982
EXPERTISE. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE TALK ABOUT GEORGE KENT

06:21:11.263 --> 06:21:17.772
WHO IS THE FOREMOST UKRAINE 
EXPERT IN THE DEPARTMENT. THIS 

06:21:18.059 --> 06:21:25.174
IS WHOSE WIFE IS OF DECENT. HE 
WEARS A BOW TIE. HE LIVES AND 

06:21:25.616 --> 06:21:29.436
BREATHES THIS STUFF. AND SO WHEN
-- AND TAYLOR IS NO SLOUCH 

06:21:29.724 --> 06:21:33.328
EITHER. HE'S BEEN WORKING IN 
EASTERN EUROPE AND INTERNATIONAL

06:21:34.713 --> 06:21:37.558
AFFAIRS INSIDE, OUTSIDE OF 
GOVERNMENT FOR DECADES UPON 

06:21:37.861 --> 06:21:41.680
DECADES. SO, YEAH, THESE GUYS 
WERE NOT AT ALL. 

06:21:41.681 --> 06:21:45.403
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET 
CONFUSED BY A LOT OF UKRAINIAN 

06:21:45.685 --> 06:21:47.685
NAMES. 
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. I MIGHT START 

06:21:47.864 --> 06:21:51.898
WEARING A BOW TIE IF IT HELPS ME
UNDERSTAND. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

06:21:52.220 --> 06:21:55.199
THE DEMOCRATS TACTICS AND WHAT 
THEY WERE TRYING TO POINT OUT 

06:21:55.476 --> 06:21:59.045
AND BRING TO THE FLOOR. IT WAS 
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF WHO WAS DOING A 

06:21:59.328 --> 06:22:02.222
LOT OF THE ARGUING. BUT 
DEMOCRATS DOWN THE ROSTER HAD A 

06:22:02.510 --> 06:22:04.510
FEW 

06:22:05.889 --> 06:22:09.224
MOMENTS. HERE'S WHAT CONGRESSMAN
JOAQUIN CASTRO ON 

06:22:09.225 --> 06:22:12.522
&gt;&gt; -- WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE 
ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL 

06:22:16.088 --> 06:22:19.262
IN COMMITTING THE CRIME. LET'S 
WATCH. 

06:22:19.263 --> 06:22:24.199
&gt;&gt; SO AMBASSADORS, IS ATTEMPTED 
MURDER A CRIME? IS ATTEMPTED 

06:22:24.478 --> 06:22:27.618
MURDER A CRIME? 
&gt;&gt; ATTEMPTED MURDER IS A CRIME. 

06:22:27.902 --> 06:22:31.905
&gt;&gt; IS ATTEMPTED ROBBERY A CRIME?
&gt;&gt; NEITHER OF US IS A LAWYER. 

06:22:32.180 --> 06:22:35.268
&gt;&gt; I THINK ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM 
CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. 

06:22:35.269 --> 06:22:41.088
&gt;&gt; I WILL GO OUT ON A LIMB AND 
SAY YES IT IS. 

06:22:41.089 --> 06:22:43.703
&gt;&gt; IS ATTEMPTED EXTORTION AND 
BRIBERY A CRIME? 

06:22:43.704 --> 06:22:45.704
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; WHY 

06:22:48.780 --> 06:22:52.186
IS THIS IMPORTANT, AMBER? 
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT HE'S TRYING TO 

06:22:52.569 --> 06:23:00.630
DO IS COUNTER THE REPUBLICAN 
ARGUMENT. WHICH IS THEY GOT 

06:23:01.339 --> 06:23:05.739
THEIR MILITARY AID. SO THERE IS 
NO QUID PRO QUO. WHAT CASTRO IS 

06:23:06.012 --> 06:23:09.085
TRYING TO SAY. THE FACT THAT 
TRUMP TRIED TO HOLD IT BACK, 

06:23:09.380 --> 06:23:13.966
EVEN THOUGH CONGRESS WANTED TO 
GO TO UKRAINE TO GET WHAT 

06:23:14.684 --> 06:23:18.154
BENEFITS HIM IS WRONG ENOUGH AND
IMPEACHABLE ENOUGH. AND I HAVE 

06:23:18.444 --> 06:23:22.155
SEEN DOWN THE STRETCH, THAT I 
THINK IS WHERE TRUMP IS GOING TO

06:23:22.639 --> 06:23:26.653
RISE OR FALL. MAYBE IT WAS 
WRONG. LIKE IF THEY ARE STARTING

06:23:26.947 --> 06:23:29.765
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BASED ON THE
EVIDENCE AND WITNESS TESTIMONY. 

06:23:30.036 --> 06:23:34.869
BUT IT WAS AN IMPEACHABLE AND I 
THINK YOU FOLD IN PART OF THE 

06:23:35.142 --> 06:23:38.147
ARGUMENT THAT REPUBLICANS MADE 
TODAY. IT WAS AN IMPEACHABLE 

06:23:38.420 --> 06:23:41.656
BECAUSE UKRAINE GOT THEIR AID. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. AND 

06:23:41.934 --> 06:23:45.957
YOU KNOW, AND YOU ARE ALSO RIGHT
THAT IT RISES AND FALLS ON THIS.

06:23:46.271 --> 06:23:49.499
BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER 
OR NOT IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THAT 

06:23:49.784 --> 06:23:54.219
OH, BUT HE GOT CAUGHT. AND IS 
THAT THE REASON WHY? THERE IS SO

06:23:54.494 --> 06:23:57.936
MUCH CONCERN ABOUT IT. AND YOU 
KNOW, THAT IS WHY THE DEMOCRATS 

06:23:58.233 --> 06:24:02.853
WERE RESPONDING. WELL, THIS 
BECAME A CONGRESSIONAL ISSUE. 

06:24:03.297 --> 06:24:07.870
THEY WERE UNDER A LOT OF 
PRESSURE BECAUSE THE AID HAD 

06:24:08.153 --> 06:24:09.946
STOPPED. 
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WERE 

06:24:09.947 --> 06:24:12.857
PUSHING TO GET THE AID MOVING 
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY

06:24:13.144 --> 06:24:17.456
VOTED ON IT AND IT WAS A LOCK. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH. AND MAYBE IT DIDN'T GET

06:24:17.747 --> 06:24:22.244
AS MUCH ISSUE AS OF COURSE THE 
IMPEACHMENT PHASE. BUT THERE WAS

06:24:22.651 --> 06:24:25.621
A SMALL CHAPTER IN WASHINGTON 
WHERE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 

06:24:25.904 --> 06:24:30.174
WERE AWARE THIS AID HAD BEEN PUT
ON HOLD. AND THEY PRESSURED 

06:24:30.460 --> 06:24:32.609
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERSHIP THE PRESIDENT TO TURN

06:24:33.617 --> 06:24:37.170
THE FAUCET BACK ON. AND IT DID 
HAPPEN. AND THAT IS WHERE THIS 

06:24:37.454 --> 06:24:43.722
DEBATE IS RIGHT NOW. AND THEY'RE
TRYING TO LITIGATE THIS OUT. 

06:24:44.006 --> 06:24:47.729
WELL, IT ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE 
THEY GOT CAUGHT. IS THAT A BAD 

06:24:48.096 --> 06:24:55.382
THING? AS CASTRO WAS TRYING TO 
TEASE THIS OUT, THAT, YOU KNOW, 

06:24:55.659 --> 06:25:02.602
ATTEMPTED MURDER IS A PROBLEM. 
AND EVEN THAT TAYLOR WAS WILLING

06:25:02.878 --> 06:25:07.176
TO GO OUT AND SAY YEAH, THAT IS 
TRUE. YOU WOULD BE VIOLATING THE

06:25:07.485 --> 06:25:09.486
LAW. 
&gt;&gt; DID TAYLOR TESTIFY? HE WAS 

06:25:09.789 --> 06:25:13.150
REALLY WORRIED THIS WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, THEY HAD HIM 

06:25:13.437 --> 06:25:17.945
READ OUT LOUD HIS TEXT WHERE HE 
SAID AND I QUIT. THIS IS MY 

06:25:18.545 --> 06:25:23.114
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO IF HE IS ON 
CNN AND I'M INVESTIGATING 

06:25:23.395 --> 06:25:27.935
DEMOCRATS. 
IT UNDER LIES THE SUPPORT IN 

06:25:28.242 --> 06:25:31.586
AMERICA AND THEY NEED THAT TO 
COUNTER RUSSIA. IT WAS ALL 

06:25:31.864 --> 06:25:34.770
CONNECTED TO HIM. HE WAS REALLY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. AND HE 

06:25:35.060 --> 06:25:38.723
TESTIFIED BY HE TALKED 
TOOFFICIALS IN PAT ZELENSKY'S 

06:25:39.008 --> 06:25:42.561
OFFICE AND SAID YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO GO ON CNN. PLEASE DON'T

06:25:43.279 --> 06:25:48.250
DO THIS. PLEASE TELL THE 
PRESIDENT NOT TO GO ON CNN. AND 

06:25:48.528 --> 06:25:52.844
SO I THINK THAT BOLSTERS 
DEMOCRATS ARGUMENT THAT THE 

06:25:53.137 --> 06:25:56.051
PRESIDENT WAS INCHING FORWARD TO
COMMITTING A CRIME OR 

06:25:56.328 --> 06:25:58.792
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS TO 

06:25:59.084 --> 06:26:02.602
COME. OKAY. SO WE WILL BE BACK 
HERE FRIDAY FOR MARIE 

06:26:02.882 --> 06:26:07.278
YOVANOVITCH TO TESTIFY. JOHN, 
WHY WILL YOU BE WATCHING THAT SO

06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:09.602
CLOSELY? 
&gt;&gt; MARIE YOVANOVITCH HAS OFFERED

06:26:09.875 --> 06:26:14.304
ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING 
PERSONAL STORIES IN A SORT OF 

06:26:14.575 --> 06:26:20.314
TICK-TOCK IN HER CLOSED DOOR 
DEPOSITIONS. THE EXPERIENCE OF 

06:26:20.605 --> 06:26:23.876
HAVING THIS SMEAR CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST HER AND HOW MUCH THIS 

06:26:24.408 --> 06:26:29.055
HURT HER AND HOW DISAPPOINTED 
AND INCREDULOUS THAT SHE DIDN'T 

06:26:30.229 --> 06:26:33.053
GET TOP LEVEL SUPPORT. THAT 
IMPLICATES SECRETARY OF STATE 

06:26:33.330 --> 06:26:39.305
MIKE POMPEO WHO DID NOT STEP UP 
AND SUPPORT HER. AND SO, YOU 

06:26:40.192 --> 06:26:42.958
KNOW, SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN. SHE IS 

06:26:43.233 --> 06:26:47.709
EXPECTED THAT SHE WILL TALK 
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING 

06:26:47.987 --> 06:26:52.574
TOLD BY HER SUPERIORS AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT, GET ON THE 

06:26:52.979 --> 06:26:56.509
NEXT PLANE BACK TO WASHINGTON 
AND BEING UNCEREMONIOUSLY 

06:26:56.834 --> 06:27:00.268
DISMISSED. AND SO I THINK A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WILL BE WATCHING THAT 

06:27:00.773 --> 06:27:04.516
AND YOU KNOW THAT BRINGS A LOT 
MORE SORT OF HUMAN DRAMA TO THIS

06:27:04.852 --> 06:27:08.760
RATHER THAN WHAT WE SAW TODAY 
WHICH WAS A VERY SORT OF 

06:27:09.759 --> 06:27:13.019
DETAILED, PRECISE RECOUNTING OF 
PHONE CALLS, TEXT MESSAGES, AND 

06:27:14.345 --> 06:27:17.640
E-MAILS. THERE IS A LOT MORE 
HUMAN PSYCHE IN THIS NEXT ONE IF

06:27:17.921 --> 06:27:20.405
YOU ARE GOING TO DESCRIBE IT IN 
CINEMATIC TERMS. 

06:27:20.406 --> 06:27:23.967
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO LOOK AT THE 
HEADLINE RIGHT NOW FROM 

06:27:24.251 --> 06:27:26.010
WASHINGTONPOST.COM. NEW 
TESTIMONY TIES TRUMP MORE 

06:27:26.011 --> 06:27:29.218
DIRECTLY TO UKRAINE PRESSURE. SO
THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS

06:27:29.497 --> 06:27:32.178
THAT HAPPENED RIGHT OFF THE BAT 
THIS MORNING, AMBER. 

06:27:32.179 --> 06:27:35.275
&gt;&gt; RIGHT OFF THE BAT. TAYLOR 
FINISHED HIS OPENING STATEMENT 

06:27:35.547 --> 06:27:40.464
AND HE SAID I WANT TO ADD ONE 
MORE THING. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 

06:27:40.774 --> 06:27:44.476
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. 
ESSENTIALLY AN AID TO TAYLOR 

06:27:44.748 --> 06:27:47.791
HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER THE 
PHONE. HE WASN'T TALKING TO 

06:27:48.067 --> 06:27:50.943
PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT HE HEARD HIM
OVER THE PHONE SAY INVESTIGATION

06:27:51.232 --> 06:27:55.067
WHILE THEY WERE IN UKRAINE. SO 
IT JUST CONNECTS THINGS A LITTLE

06:27:55.344 --> 06:27:58.938
BIT CLOSER TO TRUMP BECAUSE THAT
IS ONE UNANSWERED QUESTION WE 

06:27:59.224 --> 06:28:03.693
STILL HAVE. WAS TRUMP, WE KNOW 
HE WANTED THE INVESTIGATIONS. WE

06:28:03.971 --> 06:28:08.058
KNOW THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION 
HELD UP MILITARY  AID. WAS TRUMP

06:28:08.619 --> 06:28:13.580
THE ONE THAT CONNECTED TWO OR 
SOMEONE ELSE? 

06:28:13.581 --> 06:28:16.354
&gt;&gt; AMBER, TOTALLY, CRITICAL 
MOMENT. THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW 

06:28:16.636 --> 06:28:19.502
MUCH EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR? AND HOW 

06:28:19.778 --> 06:28:22.563
MUCH IS SECONDHAND? SO WHAT 
TAYLOR DID IS INTRODUCE A BRAND 

06:28:22.861 --> 06:28:25.692
NEW CHARACTER INTO THE STORY. 
SOMEONE WHO SAYS THEY HAVE 

06:28:25.983 --> 06:28:31.929
FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT OF HEARING THE
PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT 

06:28:32.201 --> 06:28:33.577
INVESTIGATIONS. AND INQUIRING 
ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS. 

06:28:33.578 --> 06:28:37.005
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE 
OR AT LEAST THESE OFFICIALS 

06:28:37.288 --> 06:28:40.881
BELIEVE HAVE TO DO WITH THE 
BIDENS AND WITH UKRAINIAN 

06:28:41.151 --> 06:28:43.151
INTERFERENCE IN 2016. 

06:29:19.485 --> 06:29:25.983
AND SEVEN THE EMBASSY WILL 
TESTIFY ON FRIDAY ALSO ENDING 

06:29:26.742 --> 06:29:32.887
MARK SANDY FOR THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY PROGRAM WITH OMB 

06:29:33.288 --> 06:29:38.169
TESTIFYING WE BELIEVE ON 
SATURDAY. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO 

06:29:38.370 --> 06:29:40.759
TESTIFY ON NOVEMBER 8 BUT DID 
NOT SHOW UP. 

06:29:40.760 --> 06:29:46.514
&gt;&gt;  HE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO 
BRING IN AND IN THE PAST, THEY 

06:29:46.689 --> 06:29:48.689
HAVE BEEN TELLING THE SAME LINE

06:29:52.188 --> 06:29:54.421
AS THE PRESIDENT'S CLOSEST 
ADVISORS AND NOT COMING IN AND 

06:29:54.622 --> 06:30:00.312
TESTIFYING SO WE WILL SEE HOW 
THAT TRANSPIRES AND WE OBVIOUSLY

06:30:00.509 --> 06:30:02.509
KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT

06:30:02.543 --> 06:30:05.391
TO BRING IN AS MANY PEOPLE AS 
THEY CAN AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY 

06:30:05.592 --> 06:30:09.044
CAN COUNTER THE REPUBLICAN 
NARRATIVE THAT WE TALKED TO 

06:30:09.246 --> 06:30:12.642
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
ACCESS TO HIGH-LEVEL SENIOR 

06:30:12.890 --> 06:30:20.567
DECISION MAKING. 
&gt;&gt;  IN PART, THEY SOUNDED MORE 

06:30:20.734 --> 06:30:26.646
LIKE PRO TRUMP WHEN I TALK TO 
CONGRESS AND SAID I WOULD NOT 

06:30:26.833 --> 06:30:29.478
TESTIFY AND TAYLOR AND KENT 
TESTIFIED

06:30:33.217 --> 06:30:36.208
THAT IT WAS BEING HELD UP ON THE
CONFERENCE CALL AND A STAFFER 

06:30:36.403 --> 06:30:43.730
SAID WE ARE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT
NOW. AGAIN, THEY CAN'T POINTED 

06:30:43.971 --> 06:30:45.971
TO

06:30:47.639 --> 06:30:51.606
TRUMP EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID IN AN
INSTANT, HE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 

06:30:51.903 --> 06:30:57.201
THAT HE THINKS THERE IS A QUID 
PRO QUO SO DEMOCRATS FEEL LIKE 

06:30:57.400 --> 06:31:00.396
THERE IS A MISSING LINK TO TRUMP
HIMSELF.

06:31:05.733 --> 06:31:07.968
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY AND THAT IS WHERE 
THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD BECAUSE

06:31:08.168 --> 06:31:15.070
THEY HOLD THE FIRST STRINGS  AND
THAT HAS BEEN A MISSING TASK AND

06:31:15.272 --> 06:31:20.563
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO CLARIFY 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WITHDRAW THIS A

06:31:20.763 --> 06:31:23.741
THAT SO MANY DIPLOMATS WERE 
TRYING TO SECURE AND MAKE HAPPEN

06:31:24.619 --> 06:31:30.518
, IT HAS TO COME WITH AN 
EXPLANATION AND THOSE ARE THE 

06:31:30.719 --> 06:31:33.225
PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE MOST 
FAMILIAR WITH THE RATIONALE THAT

06:31:33.398 --> 06:31:35.699
WAS OR WAS NOT PROVIDED AT THE 
TIME. ABSOLUTELY

06:31:44.733 --> 06:31:46.969
,  THAT WILL BE A VERY 
INTERESTING THING TO WATCH OUT 

06:31:47.170 --> 06:31:48.786
FOR HER. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE WATCHING THE WHITE 

06:31:48.787 --> 06:31:51.232
HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN SEE 
THE YELLOW CURTAINS AND WE WILL 

06:31:51.435 --> 06:31:53.669
SOON BACK OVER  TO WHERE WE 
EXPECT PRESIDENT TRUMP TO COME 

06:31:53.869 --> 06:31:56.305
OUT IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND 
THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY. I WANT 

06:31:56.505 --> 06:31:58.505
TO TAKE THIS MOMENT

06:32:01.794 --> 06:32:04.228
TO THANK EVERYONE. YOU WILL STAY
WITH US UNTIL WE SEE THE LEADERS

06:32:04.428 --> 06:32:07.076
COME OUT BUT WE WILL BE BACK 
HERE ON FRIDAY AND YOU CAN FIND 

06:32:07.248 --> 06:32:09.248
US  WASHINGTONPOST.COMAT

06:32:12.760 --> 06:32:14.794
AND ALSO ON YOUTUBE. WE WILL BE 
BRINGING THESE HEARINGS THIS 

06:32:14.995 --> 06:32:18.045
WEEK AND NEXT WEEK AS WELL AND 
WE WILL BE MARCHING ON AS WE SEE

06:32:18.244 --> 06:32:21.695
MORE TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HOUSE 
COMMITTEE AND A QUICK TIMELINE 

06:32:21.895 --> 06:32:24.463
HERE, MORE HEARINGS IN THE HOUSE
NEXT WEEK AND

06:32:28.813 --> 06:32:31.810
JOHN, IS ANYTHING STANDING OUT 
TO YOU OF WHAT TO WATCH FOR NEXT

06:32:31.979 --> 06:32:34.085
WEEK? 
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT IS ALL ABOUT WHO 

06:32:34.302 --> 06:32:38.976
SHOWS UP AND WHO DOESN'T . THEY 
ARE STARTING TO LAY OUT THE 

06:32:39.734 --> 06:32:46.615
FACTS AND IN A COGENT WAY. I 
WILL ALSO BE INTERESTED IN 

06:32:46.791 --> 06:32:48.791
SEEING

06:32:50.333 --> 06:32:52.333
HOW SATISFIED TRUMP IS WITH THE 
PERFORMANCE THAT THE REPUBLICANS

06:32:52.367 --> 06:32:56.233
PUT ON TODAY AND IF HE VIEWS 
THEM AS DEFENDING HIM ENOUGH. IT

06:32:56.996 --> 06:32:58.996
WAS INTERESTING

06:33:04.154 --> 06:33:06.187
WHEN THE CHAIRMAN ENDED THIS 
ALL. HE DID PRAISE BOTH SIDES 

06:33:06.389 --> 06:33:11.469
FOR BEING RELATIVELY NONPARTISAN
AND NOT REALLY NONPARTISAN BUT 

06:33:11.670 --> 06:33:16.339
THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT IS 
POLITE. 

06:33:16.340 --> 06:33:18.574
&gt;&gt; HE WAS PROBABLY JUST HAPPY 
THAT NO ONE OUT OF THE 

06:33:18.775 --> 06:33:20.606
WHISTLEBLOWER. 
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY AN

06:33:20.607 --> 06:33:23.805
ISSUE THAT THEY WERE BRAWLING 
ABOUT IN CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITIONS

06:33:23.978 --> 06:33:32.595
SO I THINK WHAT WE WILL SEE IS 
THIS TENURE OF RELATIVE MANNERS 

06:33:33.362 --> 06:33:39.093
AND POLITENESS IF THE 
ENVIRONMENT CAN CONTINUE. THERE 

06:33:39.295 --> 06:33:41.930
WAS BACK AND FORTH BUT AS THE 
CHAIRMAN POINTED OUT, WE ARE 

06:33:42.131 --> 06:33:46.804
TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT IN A 
REALLY EXTRAORDINARY PROCESS IN 

06:33:47.555 --> 06:33:51.983
OUR SYSTEM AND THE FACT THAT 
THEY COULD STILL DO IT WITHOUT 

06:33:52.287 --> 06:33:54.287
BREAKING OUT INTO A FIST FIGHT

06:33:57.781 --> 06:34:00.418
,  MAYBE THAT IS SOME DEGREE OF 
A SILVER LINING. I DON'T KNOW, 

06:34:00.620 --> 06:34:02.620
WE WILL SEE. 
&gt;&gt;  TESTIFY NEXT WEEK WILL BE 

06:34:03.217 --> 06:34:05.217
GORDON SUMMERLAND.

06:34:07.523 --> 06:34:10.173
WE WILL BE BRINGING THAT TO YOU 
ALL LIVE NEXT WEEK AND AFTER THE

06:34:10.372 --> 06:34:12.372
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WRAPS UP 
ITS WORK, THEY CREATE A REPORT 

06:34:12.406 --> 06:34:14.641
THAT CAN BE DONE THE WEEK OF 
THANKSGIVING AND THAT WILL GO 

06:34:14.841 --> 06:34:18.343
OVER TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
AND THAT IS WHERE THE ACTION 

06:34:18.521 --> 06:34:20.930
WILL PICK UP AND WE WILL SEE THE
PROCESS THERE WITH WHAT PEOPLE 

06:34:21.131 --> 06:34:23.980
HAVE CLASSICALLY THOUGHT OF IN 
TERMS OF IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE OF 

06:34:24.181 --> 06:34:27.231
THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE PAST AT 
THAT POINT WE EXPECT THE HOUSE 

06:34:27.435 --> 06:34:29.435
TO TAKE A VOTE OF ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT

06:34:33.723 --> 06:34:36.373
AND THEN IT GOES OVER TO THE 
SENATE AND THEN WE SEE A TRIAL 

06:34:36.574 --> 06:34:41.647
IN THE SENATE AND THAT COULD BE 
IN JANUARY AT THIS POINT 

06:34:41.861 --> 06:34:44.297
ALTHOUGH THE TIMELINE IS HARD TO
PIN DOWN BECAUSE IT IS A MOVING 

06:34:44.498 --> 06:34:45.916
TARGET. 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A REMARKABLE THING 

06:34:45.917 --> 06:34:48.552
BUT IT IS LOOKING LIKE CONGRESS 
WILL BE DEBATING  IMPEACHING THE

06:34:48.767 --> 06:34:52.821
PRESIDENT IN THE YEAR THAT HE IS
UP FOR ELECTION. THAT IS CRAZY 

06:34:53.034 --> 06:34:55.010
AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN MODERN 
HISTORY. 

06:34:55.011 --> 06:34:57.011
&gt;&gt; 

06:35:00.752 --> 06:35:02.752
THE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS, 
THIS IS ALL VERY HISTORIC AND WE

06:35:02.771 --> 06:35:04.803
WILL CONTINUE TO BRING IT ALL 
LIVE. WATCHING THE WHITE HOUSE, 

06:35:05.016 --> 06:35:07.166
YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST LADY COME 
IN AND

06:35:14.757 --> 06:35:17.193
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO AMBER AND 
JOHN AND ALL OF OUR CONTRIBUTORS

06:35:17.406 --> 06:35:21.459
THAT ARE WITH US TODAY. WE WILL 
BE WATCHING TO SEE WHEN THE 

06:35:21.675 --> 06:35:23.696
LEADERS COME IN AND A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT 

06:35:23.896 --> 06:35:26.058
TRUMP WILL SAY ABOUT THE 
PROCEEDINGS. THE WHITE HOUSE

06:35:29.792 --> 06:35:31.209
DOWNPLAYED IT INCLUDING 
STEPHANIE GRISHAM CALLING THE 

06:35:31.210 --> 06:35:34.007
WHOLE THING BORING WHICH IS A 
STRATEGIC LINE. ONE OF THE SONS 

06:35:34.189 --> 06:35:39.344
TWEETING ABOUT HOW IT WAS A 
SNOOZE FEST SO THAT IS THE 

06:35:39.543 --> 06:35:41.543
TACTIC THAT REPUBLICANS ARE 
TAKING TO TRY TO DOWNPLAY PUBLIC

06:35:41.575 --> 06:35:43.575
INTEREST IN THIS. THE WHITE 
HOUSE SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT 

06:35:44.163 --> 06:35:48.281
WAS NOT WATCHING EARLIER BUT HE 
WAS TWEETING ABOUT IT. 

06:35:48.282 --> 06:35:50.836
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEIR ARGUMENT IS  
THIS IS BUREAUCRACY MUMBO-JUMBO

06:36:02.093 --> 06:36:04.093
AND DON'T PAY ATTENTION. 
&gt;&gt; WE WILL SEE WHAT THE 

06:36:04.125 --> 06:36:06.359
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS. HE WILL 

06:36:06.560 --> 06:36:08.794
BE JOINED BY THE LEADER OF 
TURKEY. LET'S GO LIVE TO THE 

06:36:08.996 --> 06:36:10.996
WHITE HOUSE NOW. 

06:36:14.278 --> 06:36:16.278
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 

06:36:20.979 --> 06:36:25.609
PLEASE, I WANT TO BEGIN BY 
WELCOMING THE FIRST LADY WITH US

06:36:25.779 --> 06:36:27.779
TODAY

06:36:30.119 --> 06:36:32.357
IN THE FIRST LADY OF TURKEY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 

06:36:32.553 --> 06:36:38.048
HERE. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO 
HAVE YOU HERE AND WE HAD A 

06:36:38.249 --> 06:36:40.070
WONDERFUL AND VERY PRODUCTIVE 
MEETING. BEFORE WE START, I 

06:36:40.071 --> 06:36:46.297
WOULD LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT OR
ONE FOR RELEASING THE DETAINEE

06:36:51.041 --> 06:36:54.492
WHO WAS IN DETENTION IN 
DIFFERENT FORMS OF DETENTION AND

06:36:54.693 --> 06:37:00.190
I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. 
THAT WAS A VERY NICE TRIBUTE AND

06:37:00.391 --> 06:37:02.959
HE WILL BE COMING BACK AT SOME 
POINT IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT 

06:37:03.137 --> 06:37:08.511
FUTURE SO THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS
FOR THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO 

06:37:08.713 --> 06:37:14.542
GOOD NEWS FOR TURKEY. TURKEY AS 
EVERYONE KNOWS IS A GREAT NATO 

06:37:14.717 --> 06:37:19.227
ALLY AND A STRATEGIC PARTNER OF 
THE UNITED STATES AROUND THE 

06:37:19.400 --> 06:37:23.143
WORLD. OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP
HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL AND 

06:37:23.350 --> 06:37:25.350
CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND GROW

06:37:30.449 --> 06:37:32.280
DIRECT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE 
PROMISEE BETWEEN OUR NATION THAT

06:37:32.281 --> 06:37:35.117
IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING A 
FUTURE OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY 

06:37:35.534 --> 06:37:39.386
AND PROMISE FOR OUR CITIZENS. 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY, THE 

06:37:39.584 --> 06:37:45.030
PRESIDENT AND I HAD A FRANK 
CONVERSATION ON IMPORTANT TOPICS

06:37:46.848 --> 06:37:50.513
IN THE SITUATION IN SYRIA.

06:37:57.671 --> 06:38:03.102
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
O'BRIEN TO MEET WITH

06:38:07.827 --> 06:38:09.827
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT ERDOGAN AND 
THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE VERY 

06:38:10.005 --> 06:38:13.913
SUCCESSFUL  IN THE UNITED STATES
AND TURKEY ACHIEVED A TREMENDOUS

06:38:14.127 --> 06:38:18.210
AMOUNT ON THAT DAY AND I THINK 
WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS GETTING 

06:38:18.394 --> 06:38:23.668
BETTER AND BETTER. IT IS A 
COMPLICATED SITUATION THAT HAS 

06:38:23.869 --> 06:38:26.461
BEEN GOING ON FOR HUNDREDS OF 
YEARS AND TODAY THE CEASE-FIRE 

06:38:26.651 --> 06:38:28.651
CONTINUES

06:38:33.622 --> 06:38:35.622
AND I WANT TO THANK THE 
PRESIDENT FOR HIS PARTNERSHIP 

06:38:35.660 --> 06:38:37.893
AND COOPERATION AS WE WORK TO 
BUILD A MORE FEASIBLE AND STABLE

06:38:38.095 --> 06:38:40.095
AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE EAST. WE 
HAVE ASSURED EACH OTHER THAT 

06:38:40.116 --> 06:38:42.490
TURKEY WILL CONTINUE TO UPHOLD

06:38:46.217 --> 06:38:50.473
WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD. 
I'M A BIG FAN OF THE PRESIDENT. 

06:38:50.890 --> 06:38:55.557
I KNOW THAT THE CEASE-FIRE WHILE
COMPLICATED IS MOVING FORWARD 

06:38:55.959 --> 06:38:58.946
AND MOVING FORWARD AT A RAPID

06:39:13.842 --> 06:39:16.275
PACE. MANY WANT TO SEE THIS WORK
AFTER SO MANY DECADES AND MANY 

06:39:16.478 --> 06:39:18.478
CENTURIES YOU MIGHT SAY. THE 
UNITED STATES AND TURKEY ARE 

06:39:18.510 --> 06:39:20.341
WORKING EXTENSIVELY IN MANY 
OTHER SECURITY ISSUES AND TURKEY

06:39:20.342 --> 06:39:22.377
HAS THE SECOND LARGEST ARMED 
FORCES IN NATO AFTER THE UNITED 

06:39:22.577 --> 06:39:25.014
STATES AND THEY ARE A STRONG 
SECOND I MIGHT ADD. I AM PLEASED

06:39:25.267 --> 06:39:27.044
THAT TURKEY HAS BEEN STEADILY 
INCREASING ITS DEFENSE SPENDING 

06:39:27.045 --> 06:39:29.045
AND IS CLOSE TO THE 2%

06:39:32.735 --> 06:39:34.767
OF RANGE UNLIKE MANY OF THE 
OTHER COUNTRIES. AT THIS MOMENT,

06:39:34.967 --> 06:39:37.201
THEY ARE EIGHT OUT OF THE 28 
COUNTRIES THAT ARE CURRENT IN 

06:39:37.402 --> 06:39:40.855
TERMS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS 
FINANCIALLY. TURKEY HAS MADE A 

06:39:41.614 --> 06:39:45.459
VITAL CONTRIBUTION TO NATO'S 
RESOLUTE SUPPORT MISSION IN 

06:39:45.640 --> 06:39:50.551
AFGHANISTAN AND ITS PARTNERSHIP 
WAS IMPORTANT TO OUR DESTRUCTION

06:39:50.725 --> 06:39:59.744
OF ISIS WHEN WE TOOK OUT ALBERT 
DADDY AND TAKE HIM OUT WE DID. 

06:40:00.505 --> 06:40:07.866
TURKEY NEW THAT THERE WERE 
CERTAIN AREAS AND WE REALLY 

06:40:08.630 --> 06:40:10.630
APPRECIATE IT.

06:40:14.171 --> 06:40:18.383
THEY HAVE THAT COOPERATION AND 
IN THE CONSTANT STRUGGLE AGAINST

06:40:18.556 --> 06:40:23.913
TERRORISM, HE FIGHTS IT LIKE WE 
DO. THEY HAVE THE SECURITY 

06:40:24.127 --> 06:40:26.480
COLLABORATION AS THE DEFENSE 
WITH THE EQUIPMENT PROGRAM

06:40:30.821 --> 06:40:32.853
IN AMERICAN FARM MILITARY SELLS 
TO TURKEY TOTAL MANY BILLIONS OF

06:40:33.055 --> 06:40:35.055
DOLLARS IN TURKEY

06:40:41.594 --> 06:40:43.412
COMPRISE COMPONENT PARTS TO MANY
AMERICAN DEFENSE PROGRAMS AND 

06:40:43.413 --> 06:40:46.211
MAKES PARTS OF THE FRAME FOR THE
F 35. TURKEY'S ACQUISITION OF 

06:40:46.401 --> 06:40:51.253
EQUIPMENT CREATES A VERY SERIOUS
CHALLENGE FOR US

06:40:56.420 --> 06:41:00.274
AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY 
AND IN THE FUTURE AND WE WILL 

06:41:00.475 --> 06:41:06.781
RESOLVE THE SITUATION. WE ARE 
ADMINISTERING FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

06:41:07.181 --> 06:41:11.250
AND SECURITY ADVISORS TO 
IMMEDIATELY WORK ON RESOLVING 

06:41:11.650 --> 06:41:16.319
THE AS/400 ISSUE. WE ALSO AGREED
TO WORK TOWARDS A $100 BILLION 

06:41:17.071 --> 06:41:19.071
TRADE AGREEMENT

06:41:20.789 --> 06:41:23.436
AND SECRETARY ROST IS HERE. I 
THINK WE MADE TREMENDOUS 

06:41:23.679 --> 06:41:28.510
PROGRESS IN THAT. WE HAVE A LOT 
OF TRADE WITH TURKEY BUT IT 

06:41:28.710 --> 06:41:30.710
COULD BE MANY TIMES LARGER

06:41:34.610 --> 06:41:37.042
AND TURKEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THAT AND IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 

06:41:37.244 --> 06:41:40.029
THE UNITED STATES SO WE INTEND 
TO BRING IT TO $100 BILLION

06:41:44.960 --> 06:41:47.397
AND THAT WOULD BE FOUR TIMES 
WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW. OUR GOAL 

06:41:47.610 --> 06:41:49.630
IS TO EXPAND COMMERCE BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY TO 

06:41:49.844 --> 06:41:52.226
REDUCE THE TRADE DEFICIT AND 
ENSURE A FAIR AND RECIPROCAL 

06:41:52.410 --> 06:41:54.713
RELATIONSHIP. AND FOR THOSE THAT
HAVE ANY INTEREST, WE DISCUSSED 

06:41:55.473 --> 06:42:01.573
IT TODAY IN THE PAID AGREEMENT 
IS MOVING ALONG VERY RAPIDLY.

06:42:09.535 --> 06:42:13.001
ONE OF MY CHIEF PRIORITIES HAS 
BEEN REMOVING BARRIERS TO TRADE 

06:42:13.202 --> 06:42:16.854
AND INVESTMENT IN ENDING THE 
PRACTICES THAT HARM THE WORKERS.

06:42:17.615 --> 06:42:21.860
THEY FURTHER OPEN THAT MARKET 
AND THEY ARE DOING THAT.

06:42:26.609 --> 06:42:33.715
FOR AMERICAN GOODS AND SERVICES,
THEY ARE OPENING UP RAPIDLY. MR.

06:42:33.914 --> 06:42:37.114
PRESIDENT, AS WE HAVE SEEN IN 
RECENT WEEKS, THE ALLIANCE CAN 

06:42:37.285 --> 06:42:45.217
BE A POWERFUL FORCE AND THAT I 
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

06:42:48.944 --> 06:42:51.593
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
BEING HERE AND I HAVE GOT TO 

06:42:51.794 --> 06:42:54.134
BECOME VERY FAMILIAR AND I 
APPRECIATE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB

06:42:55.380 --> 06:43:00.027
. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING A
COMMON GROUND

06:43:07.437 --> 06:43:09.437
AND THE ABIDING FRIENDSHIP 
BETWEEN OUR NATIONS. WE HAVE A 

06:43:09.459 --> 06:43:13.932
GREAT RELATIONSHIP BOTH 
PERSONALLY AND WITH THE GREAT 

06:43:14.131 --> 06:43:18.401
COUNTRY OF TURKEY AND WE LOOK 
FORWARD TO MOVING IT FORWARD AND

06:43:18.602 --> 06:43:25.210
MAKING IT BIGGER AND BETTER. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

06:43:32.012 --> 06:43:37.094
&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT,  MY DEAR 
FRIEND. DISTINGUISH MINISTERS 

06:43:37.858 --> 06:43:43.119
AND SECRETARIES AND DISTINGUISH 
MEMBERS, I WOULD LIKE TO SALUTE 

06:43:43.349 --> 06:43:50.500
YOU ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY 
NATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST, I 

06:43:50.700 --> 06:43:54.354
WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY DEAR 
FRIEND PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE 

06:43:54.554 --> 06:43:57.145
FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES 
FOR BEING SUCH GRACIOUS HOST 

06:43:57.317 --> 06:43:59.554
TODAY. WE HAVE MANAGED

06:44:05.325 --> 06:44:07.558
TO DISCUSS ALL THE ISSUES IN OUR
AGENDA WITH MR. PRESIDENT ALL 

06:44:07.760 --> 06:44:09.896
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE 
DISCUSSIONS WERE VERY SINCERE.

06:44:13.447 --> 06:44:16.207
WE ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED TO 
FURTHER HAVE COOPERATION IN THAT

06:44:17.914 --> 06:44:22.394
RELATIONSHIP BE DIRECTED UPON A 
STRONG AND HEALTHY FOUNDATION. I

06:44:22.593 --> 06:44:24.826
THINK WE SHOULD REMAIN RESOLVE 
IN ORDER TO OPEN A NEW CHAPTER 

06:44:25.026 --> 06:44:28.280
IN RELATIONS WHICH ARE IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH OUR DEEPLY 

06:44:29.039 --> 06:44:32.672
ROOTED ALLIANCE. WE HAVE

06:44:37.015 --> 06:44:38.831
STATED TO FIGHT TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS IMPOSING A CLEAR 

06:44:38.832 --> 06:44:44.934
AND PRESENT DANGER UPON OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY. WE HAVE 

06:44:45.139 --> 06:44:48.385
UNDERLINED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
FIGHTING AGAINST THIS IN A 

06:44:49.144 --> 06:44:51.144
SUSTAINED FASHION.

06:44:52.854 --> 06:44:56.011
WE HAVE DETAINED SEVERAL 
PRISONERS

06:45:00.770 --> 06:45:03.017
TRYING TO FLEE THE PRISONS AND 
COME TO TURKEY AND WE CURRENTLY 

06:45:03.217 --> 06:45:09.865
HAVE MORE THAN 200 THAT HAVE 
BEEN INCARCERATED AND WITH THE 

06:45:10.048 --> 06:45:17.640
OPERATION, THIS WAS INITIATED 
OCTOBER 9 WITH OTHERS IN STEPS 

06:45:17.839 --> 06:45:21.402
FORWARD IN A RESOLUTE FASHION. 
OUR COUNTRY WITH THIS OPERATION

06:45:25.963 --> 06:45:28.554
BLEW A VERY SINITIC IMPACT UPON 
THE SEPARATE AGENDA OF TERRORIST

06:45:28.726 --> 06:45:30.726
ORGANIZATIONS.

06:45:33.885 --> 06:45:37.335
IN ORDER TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN 
OUR COOPERATION, WE BELIEVE WE 

06:45:37.551 --> 06:45:40.953
HAVE GAINED A CERTIFICATE 
MOMENTUM WITH OUR OCTOBER 17 

06:45:41.124 --> 06:45:48.305
AGREEMENT AND MEMORANDUM. IN 
ORDER TO HARNESS RANDOM, THEY 

06:45:48.504 --> 06:45:51.666
ARE ATTACKING OUR SOLDIERS AND 
CIVILIANS IN A PROACTIVE FASHION

06:45:54.408 --> 06:46:00.093
AND IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, MORE 
THAN 19 ATTACKS ARE HARASSING 

06:46:00.494 --> 06:46:05.316
AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS 
MONTH, THERE'S AN EXPLOSIVE 

06:46:05.499 --> 06:46:07.499
DEVICE

06:46:09.232 --> 06:46:14.063
WE HAVE THE 13 MILLION CIVILIAN 
LIVES AND DESPITE ALL THESE 

06:46:14.240 --> 06:46:16.240
ELEMENTS

06:46:18.574 --> 06:46:24.875
, WE ARE REITERATING OUR 
COMMITMENT TO OUR AGREEMENT IN 

06:46:25.630 --> 06:46:32.392
SOME CIRCLES ARE EMPATHETIC ARE 
DEEPLY UPSET AND DISTURBED AND 

06:46:32.592 --> 06:46:39.294
USING THIS INFORMATION TO CLOUD 
THE PUBLIC OPINION WITH THE 

06:46:40.055 --> 06:46:42.055
EVENTUAL GAIN

06:46:44.325 --> 06:46:46.325
.

06:46:49.039 --> 06:46:54.259
AND WE HAVE BEEN USING VISTA 
DYNAMITE OUR RELATIONS. 

06:46:54.443 --> 06:46:59.311
ESPECIALLY WITH THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES THAT WERE PASSED

06:47:01.630 --> 06:47:05.898
AND SERVED THIS VERY PURPOSE 
WITH THE TURKISH NATION AND THEY

06:47:06.098 --> 06:47:09.709
HAVE A POTENTIAL OF CASTING EACH
SHADOW OVER OUR FINANCIAL 

06:47:09.890 --> 06:47:13.820
RELATIONS AND I HAVE SHARED THIS
INFORMATION WITH MR. PRESIDENT. 

06:47:14.570 --> 06:47:20.723
THE DECISION-MAKERS HAVE PLACED 
ABOUT 104 YEARS AGO SHOULD NOT 

06:47:20.938 --> 06:47:26.974
BE HISTORIANS. WE HAVE NOTHING 
TO HIDE. I NEED TO STATE VERY 

06:47:27.155 --> 06:47:32.109
CLEARLY THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE 
OF DIALOGUE AND OPEN DISCUSSION 

06:47:32.869 --> 06:47:42.803
AND DEBATE. WE HAVE VOICED OUR 
PROPOSAL TO OPEN AND 

06:47:42.997 --> 06:47:45.220
ESTABLISH THE HISTORY.

06:48:16.190 --> 06:48:21.990
IS THE MOST RELIABLE PARTNER AND
WE ARE THE ONLY ALLY

06:48:26.748 --> 06:48:28.748
WHO HAS A VERY RESOLVE FRONT.

06:48:32.834 --> 06:48:40.757
WE HAVE SENT THEM BACK TO THEIR 
COUNTRY AND HAVE ENTRY TO 7000 

06:48:41.172 --> 06:48:47.056
THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE 

06:48:47.331 --> 06:48:52.678
A TOTAL OF 1020 THAT ARE 
INCARCERATED.

06:48:57.975 --> 06:49:03.845
WE HAVE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT 
HAVE FLED THE PRISONS.

06:49:15.702 --> 06:49:18.659
OUR COUNTRY IS BEING SHOWCASED 
AS A TARGET IN THE ORGANIZATION

06:49:24.229 --> 06:49:27.871
AND WE WILL KEEP ON. IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT

06:49:32.756 --> 06:49:39.060
TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE ORIGIN. WE
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE 

06:49:39.261 --> 06:49:41.261
COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN TO DO THIS.

06:49:46.165 --> 06:49:50.995
WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT, WE WERE 
THE ONES THAT WERE IMPACTED 

06:49:51.166 --> 06:49:53.166
HEAVILY.

06:49:55.710 --> 06:49:59.362
WE HAVE 650,000 REFUGEES AND A 
TOTAL OF MORE THAN FOUR.

06:50:02.827 --> 06:50:06.280
WE HAVE ABOUT $40 BILLION EVEN 
BEYOND THAT FOR THE REFUGEES IN 

06:50:07.044 --> 06:50:09.044
OUR COUNTRY.

06:50:13.790 --> 06:50:15.790
DESPITE A HIGHER PLEDGE.

06:50:22.330 --> 06:50:28.743
WE ARE PROVIDING THIS TO 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

06:50:37.764 --> 06:50:39.764
BECAUSE OF THE DELAY

06:50:42.233 --> 06:50:44.233
, HUNDREDS OF CIVILIAN LIVES 
WERE LOST.

06:50:47.506 --> 06:50:51.690
PREVIOUSLY WITH OUR OPERATIONS, 
WE HAVE MANAGED

06:50:57.010 --> 06:50:59.010
. 

06:51:03.959 --> 06:51:07.146
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE 
THIS.

06:51:12.093 --> 06:51:17.099
THEY WERE OPERATIONS AND THROUGH
THESE OPERATIONS, WE HAVE 

06:51:17.274 --> 06:51:19.274
MANAGED

06:51:26.241 --> 06:51:33.324
THESE OPERATIONS TO SECURE IT IN
THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE.

06:51:36.668 --> 06:51:42.354
WE ARE SHARING OUR PROJECTS WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR PLAN AND

06:51:42.554 --> 06:51:49.618
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE 
COMMUNITY TO HAVE MANY MORE 

06:51:49.784 --> 06:51:51.784
REFUGEES.

06:51:54.546 --> 06:51:56.546
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 44 
KILOMETERS IN LENGTH.

06:52:01.650 --> 06:52:06.475
1 MILLION MORE INDIVIDUALS CAN 
BE HELD.

06:52:13.844 --> 06:52:16.840
THEY WERE ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY 
TURKEY

06:52:22.770 --> 06:52:28.189
AND THIS IS BEHIND IT. THEY HAVE
251 INDIVIDUALS

06:52:32.056 --> 06:52:36.309
. THEY HAVE FORMED THE 
PARLIAMENT.

06:53:17.209 --> 06:53:21.020
THIS WILL MAKE IT MUCH MORE 
CHALLENGING TO REACH THIS.

06:53:30.411 --> 06:53:37.647
WITHIN THE PROGRAM, WE CAN ONLY 
SURMOUNT THIS. THANK YOU FRIENDS

06:53:39.510 --> 06:53:41.510
.

06:53:46.873 --> 06:53:50.929
WE HAVE THE ACQUISITION OF THE 
MISSILE AND WE HAVE CLEARLY 

06:53:51.134 --> 06:53:56.016
STATED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT 
UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WE COULD 

06:53:56.778 --> 06:54:04.945
ACQUIRE PATRIOTISM. WE ARE READY
AND COMMITTED TO HAVE DIALOGUE 

06:54:05.359 --> 06:54:11.178
WITH THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 
AND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS 

06:54:11.353 --> 06:54:13.353
WELL.

06:54:18.350 --> 06:54:22.017
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO THANK EVERYONE 

06:54:22.219 --> 06:54:29.459
FOR BEING SO GRACIOUS THROUGHOUT
THE DAY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK 

06:54:29.626 --> 06:54:31.626
YOU.

06:54:33.393 --> 06:54:35.393
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

06:54:40.094 --> 06:54:42.525
MR. PRESIDENT. I CALLED UP THE 
SENATE AND ASKED A COUPLE OF THE

06:54:42.727 --> 06:54:45.492
SENATORS AND WE ENDED UP WITH 
FIVE AND OTHERS WANTED TO COME

06:54:49.429 --> 06:54:51.876
AND WE WILL KEEP THEM APPRISED. 
SOME OF THEM JOINED US AND THEY 

06:54:52.076 --> 06:54:54.103
HAPPEN TO BE HERE. THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH

06:54:57.767 --> 06:54:59.788
AND TED CRUZ, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH AND LINDSEY GRAHAM, THANK 

06:55:00.000 --> 06:55:02.753
YOU AND RICK SCOTT. THANK YOU, 
RICK VERY MUCH. JONI IS HERE.

06:55:07.709 --> 06:55:10.147
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO 
SEE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND

06:55:10.359 --> 06:55:12.359
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO COME 

06:55:12.392 --> 06:55:14.625
OVER AND MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT
AND WE HAD VERY FRANK DISCUSSION

06:55:14.827 --> 06:55:16.960
AND WE ARE DOING WITH THE BIG 
SUBJECT AND

06:55:21.126 --> 06:55:23.126
WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF 
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN THE 

06:55:23.696 --> 06:55:25.696
MIDDLE EAST.

06:55:27.637 --> 06:55:29.637
OKAY, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, GO 
AHEAD.

06:55:32.924 --> 06:55:34.946
&gt;&gt; FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO START 
OFF GETTING YOUR GENERAL 

06:55:35.710 --> 06:55:37.710
REACTION 

06:55:40.026 --> 06:55:42.388
. DO YOU FEEL THAT THE DEMOCRATS
MADE THEIR CASE

06:55:47.548 --> 06:55:49.169
?  
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

06:55:49.170 --> 06:55:51.604
WITCHHUNT? IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT? I HEAR IT IS A 

06:55:52.363 --> 06:55:55.874
JOKE.  I HAVEN'T WATCHED FOR ONE
MINUTE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WITH 

06:55:56.073 --> 06:55:58.106
THE PRESIDENT WHICH IS MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT AS FAR AS I'M 

06:55:58.310 --> 06:56:00.310
CONCERNED. THIS SHOULD NOT BE 
ALLOWED

06:56:14.151 --> 06:56:16.386
IN THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. I WANT TO 

06:56:16.586 --> 06:56:18.217
FIND OUT WHO IS THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER BECAUSE THE 

06:56:18.218 --> 06:56:19.838
WHISTLEBLOWER GAVE A LOT OF 
INCORRECT INFORMATION INCLUDING 

06:56:19.839 --> 06:56:22.073
MY CALL WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE WHICH WAS A PERFECT CALL

06:56:22.274 --> 06:56:24.274
AND HIGHLY APPROPRIATE AND HE 
WROTE SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH 

06:56:24.313 --> 06:56:30.197
DIFFERENT THAN THE FACTS. I WANT
TO FIND OUT WHY HE WOULD PRESENT

06:56:30.398 --> 06:56:33.249
THAT WHEN ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS
CHECK THE CALL ITSELF. I WILL BE

06:56:33.449 --> 06:56:36.247
RELEASING ON THURSDAY A SECOND 
CALL WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE 

06:56:36.434 --> 06:56:40.352
TWO AND YOU WILL MAKE A 
DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT YOU 

06:56:40.555 --> 06:56:42.555
THINK BUT I HAVE HEARD JUST A 
REPORT

06:56:46.045 --> 06:56:48.078
, THEY SAID IT IS ALL THIRDHAND 
INFORMATION AND NOTHING DIRECT 

06:56:48.842 --> 06:56:54.167
AT ALL. IT CAN'T BE DIRECT 
BECAUSE I NEVER SET IT IN ALL I 

06:56:54.368 --> 06:56:57.217
HAVE TO DO IS LOOK SIMPLY AT THE
TRANSCRIPT. THIS WAS ANALYZED BY

06:56:57.973 --> 06:57:05.475
GREAT LAWYERS AND BY GREG JARED 
AND MARK LEVAN AND ANALYZED BY 

06:57:05.674 --> 06:57:12.446
EVERYBODY. THEY SAID THE 
STATEMENT THAT I MADE WITH THE 

06:57:12.646 --> 06:57:14.646
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE WAS A 
PERFECT ONE.

06:57:23.621 --> 06:57:25.652
THIS COUNTRY GETS THROUGH THAT, 
THAT WE HAVE TO WASTE THIS 

06:57:25.853 --> 06:57:27.687
GENTLEMAN'S TIME BY EVEN 
THINKING ABOUT IT OR TALKING 

06:57:27.688 --> 06:57:30.460
ABOUT IT, I WOULD MUCH RATHER 
FOCUS ON PEACE IN THE MIDDLE 

06:57:30.627 --> 06:57:36.626
EAST AND I HEAR THAT IT IS A 
HOAX AND BEING PLAYED AS A HOAX.

06:57:36.826 --> 06:57:39.664
THAT IS WHAT I HEAR BUT YOU WILL
HAVE TO TELL ME. GO AHEAD. 

06:57:39.665 --> 06:57:44.180
&gt;&gt;  IF I MAY, ON SYRIA, THEY 
WOULD BE SYRIAN REFUGEES AND YOU

06:57:44.359 --> 06:57:47.490
HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE 
LEADERS?

06:57:58.759 --> 06:58:01.194
&gt;&gt; I THINK FRANKLY EUROPE SHOULD
BE PAYING FOR THIS TO A LARGE 

06:58:01.395 --> 06:58:03.428
EXTENT. AS OF THIS MOMENT, 
TURKEY HAS BEEN PAYING FOR MOST 

06:58:03.642 --> 06:58:06.079
OF IT AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT 
WAS SAYING TODAY THAT THEY HAVE 

06:58:06.277 --> 06:58:08.748
SPENT OVER $40 BILLION  ON THE 
COST OF THAT. 40 BILLION. HOW 

06:58:09.472 --> 06:58:11.472
MUCH? 40?

06:58:14.800 --> 06:58:18.866
WHATEVER, HE SPENT A LOT, OKAY, 
I HEARD IT WAS 40 BILLION

06:58:23.340 --> 06:58:26.176
AND I'VE HEARD THAT NUMBER FROM 
OTHERS AND THAT IS A LOT. EUROPE

06:58:26.392 --> 06:58:32.068
HAS CONTRIBUTED ABOUT THREE AND 
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD GO 

06:58:32.281 --> 06:58:36.134
ALL THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND IT 
WOULD BE A DEVASTATING SITUATION

06:58:36.334 --> 06:58:40.199
FOR EUROPE BECAUSE THERE ARE 4 
MILLION PEOPLE AND HE HAS A LOT 

06:58:40.957 --> 06:58:42.957
OF COURAGE. THEY ARE HELPING

06:58:48.324 --> 06:58:50.961
AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO EUROPE AND 
I THINK THEY SHOULD HELP US WITH

06:58:51.162 --> 06:58:53.959
ISIS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM LET 
FRANCE AND GERMANY AND LEFT THE 

06:58:54.126 --> 06:58:57.617
UK. THESE COUNTRY SHOULD HELP US
BECAUSE IF THEY EVER DID GET 

06:58:57.784 --> 06:58:59.784
RELIEF

06:59:01.529 --> 06:59:04.164
, THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. 
THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO FRANCE 

06:59:04.364 --> 06:59:08.433
AND GERMANY AND THEY ARE NOT 
HELPING US. I GAVE THE OPTION TO

06:59:08.634 --> 06:59:13.516
HAVE A BACK AND THEY SAID NO 
THANK YOU AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT 

06:59:14.279 --> 06:59:16.279
AND FAIR

06:59:20.825 --> 06:59:26.509
THEY HAD SOME ESCAPE WITH THE 
HEAVY SHOOTING AND I THINK I 

06:59:26.710 --> 06:59:31.004
KNOW HOW THEY HAPPENED TO ESCAPE
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE 

06:59:31.186 --> 06:59:33.186
TURKEY CAPTURED EVERYBODY THAT 
ESCAPED

06:59:36.059 --> 06:59:38.293
PLUS AN ADDITIONAL GROUP. WHEN 
WE TOOK OVER AND WHEN I BECAME 

06:59:38.494 --> 06:59:41.543
PRESIDENT, ISIS WAS RAMPANT ALL 
OVER THE MIDDLE EAST AND AS OF 

06:59:41.744 --> 06:59:50.070
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, LINDSAY COULD
SAY THAT WE NOW HAVE 100% AND 

06:59:50.270 --> 06:59:57.175
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO 
THAT AND WHAT WE DID LAST WEEK 

06:59:57.593 --> 06:59:59.737
WITH OWL WHO IS THE ABSOLUTE 
FOUNDER AND LEADER

07:00:07.133 --> 07:00:09.782
, SET THEM BACK AND WE ALSO HAVE
THE NUMBER TWO AND SITES ON 

07:00:09.982 --> 07:00:12.417
NUMBER THREE. THEY WILL NOT BE 
GROWING TOO FAST BUT I WILL SAY 

07:00:12.617 --> 07:00:14.584
TURKEY HAS BEEN HELPING US A 
LOT. 

07:00:14.585 --> 07:00:16.804
&gt;&gt;  [ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

07:00:50.200 --> 07:00:56.202
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. ON THE CONTRARY , 
FOR CHRISTIAN MINORITIES

07:00:59.335 --> 07:01:04.005
, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ESPECIALLY
SENSITIVE ABOUT AND WE HAVE 

07:01:04.769 --> 07:01:10.664
DIFFERENT PLANS. WHETHER BE THE 
ONES REMAINING UNDECIDED FOR THE

07:01:10.879 --> 07:01:12.879
SANCTUARIES

07:01:15.535 --> 07:01:17.535
,

07:01:20.255 --> 07:01:23.920
THEY WILL BE THERE IN THE 
CHURCHES WILL BE REBUILT SO THAT

07:01:24.122 --> 07:01:30.613
THEY CAN PRAY AGAIN WHAT THE 
PLANS THAT WE ARE MAKING. THE 

07:01:30.828 --> 07:01:38.549
CHRISTIAN MINORITY ARABIC AND 
THE ONES WHO ARE ON OUR SIDE OF 

07:01:39.314 --> 07:01:41.314
THE BORDER.

07:01:43.418 --> 07:01:48.223
THE ONES THAT ARE REMAINING ON 
THE SYRIAN SIDE WILL SEE THEIR 

07:01:48.400 --> 07:01:53.113
FAIR WORSHIPING PRACTICES.

07:01:57.642 --> 07:02:00.877
THEY ARE RECEIVING HUMANITARIAN 
AID. THANK YOU. 

07:02:00.878 --> 07:02:04.664
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WOULD 
YOU LIKE TO PICK SOMEBODY?

07:02:10.233 --> 07:02:12.382
A FRIENDLY PERSON FROM TURKEY, 
PLEASE. ONLY FRIENDLY REPORTERS.

07:02:13.890 --> 07:02:15.890
THERE AREN'T MANY OF THEM 
AROUND. THANK YOU.

07:02:26.269 --> 07:02:28.269
&gt;&gt; [ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ] 

07:03:07.111 --> 07:03:09.111
&gt;&gt; WE HAD A VERY GOOD TALK  
RECENTLY

07:03:15.434 --> 07:03:17.434
AND WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY 
TOGETHER AND ALSO WORKING 

07:03:17.499 --> 07:03:21.123
CLOSELY WITH YOUR GREAT 
PRESIDENT AND A LOT OF THINGS 

07:03:21.321 --> 07:03:23.760
ARE HAPPENING. A LOT OF POSITIVE
DEVELOPMENTS ARE HAPPENING AND A

07:03:23.957 --> 07:03:27.647
LOT OF THAT HIS DEFINITION. WHAT
IS YOUR DEFINITION OF THE 

07:03:28.386 --> 07:03:32.696
VARIOUS GROUPS AND THEN YOU HAVE
VARIOUS GROUPS AND SOME LIKE IT 

07:03:32.895 --> 07:03:36.157
AND SOME DON'T. I THINK WE HAVE 
MADE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 

07:03:36.358 --> 07:03:41.230
MOMENTUM AND STRENGTH AND 
KNOWLEDGE OVER THE LAST YEAR SO 

07:03:41.429 --> 07:03:45.860
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT I 
WILL SAY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP 

07:03:46.037 --> 07:03:55.251
WITH MARIE YOVANOVITCH IN TURKEY
HAS BEEN AMAZING. THEY ARE ONE 

07:03:55.451 --> 07:04:00.119
OF OUR VERY BIG PURCHASES AND 
THEY HAVE THE FINEST EQUIPMENT 

07:04:00.320 --> 07:04:02.320
IN THE WORLD WHICH THE UNITED 
STATES

07:04:05.809 --> 07:04:10.880
AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT A LONG 
TIME AGO IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 

07:04:11.096 --> 07:04:16.780
OF PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. YOU 
CAN AS THE PRESIDENT THE 

07:04:17.546 --> 07:04:22.268
QUESTION NOW. ARE YOU SURE YOU 
ARE A REPORTER? YOU DON'T WORK 

07:04:22.467 --> 07:04:24.467
FOR TURKEY WITH THAT QUESTION?

07:04:30.929 --> 07:04:36.710
&gt;&gt;  MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE NOT 
GETTING THE BEST OF NEWS AND OF 

07:04:36.884 --> 07:04:41.066
THE UNITED STATES IN THE OFFICE 
TARGETING TURKEY

07:04:44.804 --> 07:04:47.857
IS EXTENSIVELY INVESTED IN THE 
DAILY WORKS BUT I CAN SEE 

07:04:48.257 --> 07:04:49.890
CERTAIN PRICES THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS READY TO 

07:04:49.891 --> 07:04:53.945
UNDERSTAND MORE SO MY QUESTION 
IS HOW MUCH DO YOU PERCEIVE THE 

07:04:54.709 --> 07:05:00.178
SITUATION DEVELOPING WITH THE 
ORGANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN 

07:05:00.354 --> 07:05:02.418
APPROACH IN THAT REGARD?

07:05:06.950 --> 07:05:08.950
DURING THIS CURRENT VISIT

07:05:11.220 --> 07:05:18.325
, WE WILL SUBMIT AS WE ALREADY 
HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF DOCUMENTS 

07:05:18.726 --> 07:05:21.999
AND THIS IS A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION WITH THE RINGLEADER

07:05:23.756 --> 07:05:25.756
.

07:05:27.666 --> 07:05:29.666
THEY TRIED TO UNDERTAKE TO

07:05:33.555 --> 07:05:39.572
IN MORE THAN 2000 PEOPLE HAVE 
THAT IN THE RINGLEADER IS UNDER

07:05:43.309 --> 07:05:45.309
400 RUNNING HIS NETWORK ALL 
AROUND THE GLOBE.

07:06:01.391 --> 07:06:03.391
IN LIGHT OF THESE DOCUMENTS

07:06:06.259 --> 07:06:08.582
, I THINK THEY WILL APPRECIATE 
THE SITUATION. WE SENT THEM BACK

07:06:08.760 --> 07:06:12.882
IF WE ASK FOR THEM AND I'M SURE 
THEY WILL DO THE SAME FOR US.

07:06:21.696 --> 07:06:30.833
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS ONE  MOMENT IN THE 
AID, THERE WAS A PHONE CALL ON 

07:06:31.048 --> 07:06:37.549
JULY 26 WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
AND HE OVERHEARD  YOU SAY HOW 

07:06:37.748 --> 07:06:39.748
ARE THINGS GOING WITH THE 
PROCEEDINGS WITH THE 

07:06:39.911 --> 07:06:44.192
INVESTIGATION AND SOMEONE 
REPEATED BACK TO YOU THAT 

07:06:44.358 --> 07:06:48.504
UKRAINE WAS PREPARED TO DO 
EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANTED. IS 

07:06:49.256 --> 07:06:51.256
THAT CORRECT

07:06:52.573 --> 07:06:54.203
?  
&gt;&gt; I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT. 

07:06:54.204 --> 07:06:57.772
FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD IT.  ONE
THING I HAVE SEEN IS THAT HE DID

07:06:58.673 --> 07:07:01.229
SPEAK TO ME FOR A BRIEF MOMENT 
AND I SAID NO

07:07:09.427 --> 07:07:11.427
QUID PRO QUO UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT IS TRUE 

07:07:11.461 --> 07:07:13.897
BUT THE OTHER, I HAVE NEVER 
HEARD THIS AND IN ANY EVENT, IT 

07:07:14.109 --> 07:07:15.928
IS SECONDHAND INFORMATION. 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU RECALL ANY SITUATIONS?

07:07:15.929 --> 07:07:20.399
&gt;&gt; NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  I 
GUESS HE STAYED WITH THEIR 

07:07:20.600 --> 07:07:25.839
TESTIMONY THAT THERE WAS NO QUID
PRO QUO PEER AND SIMPLE. 

07:07:25.840 --> 07:07:27.840
&gt;&gt; 

07:07:30.767 --> 07:07:33.535
THEY SAID YOU LEFT AND THEY URGE
YOU NOT TO LAUNCH MILITARY 

07:07:33.703 --> 07:07:35.703
ACTION.

07:07:39.907 --> 07:07:42.543
HE SAID DON'T BE A TOUGH GUY OR 
A FOOL. YOU ADORED THAT LETTER 

07:07:42.750 --> 07:07:44.750
AND WHAT AHEAD AND LAUNCH 
MILITARY ACTION. CAN YOU EXPLAIN

07:07:44.776 --> 07:07:46.776
WHY YOU IGNORED THAT WARNING?

07:07:57.167 --> 07:07:59.167
&gt;&gt; THIS LETTER WAS REPRESENTED 

07:08:04.683 --> 07:08:06.683
AND I HAVE ALSO UNDERLINED

07:08:10.318 --> 07:08:12.318
THAT OUTLINES

07:08:14.835 --> 07:08:16.835
BY OUR COUNTRY SUCH AS THE 
UNITED STATES.

07:08:20.520 --> 07:08:30.074
THIS HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL AND 
HE IS 

07:08:31.035 --> 07:08:38.195
A PERSON FOR THE LEADER THAT IS 
CURRENTLY INCARCERATED SO A 

07:08:38.395 --> 07:08:41.779
PERSON LIKE THIS WOULD NOT BE 
WELCOMED IN OUR COUNTRY.

07:08:46.320 --> 07:08:50.945
SIMILARLY, THIS PERSON WAS 
WELCOMED BY A COUNTRY SUCH AS 

07:08:51.120 --> 07:08:55.869
RUSSIA. IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME 
TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE ARE TRYING

07:08:56.070 --> 07:09:04.401
TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND IF WE ARE
GOING TO SUSTAIN OUR FIGHT IN A 

07:09:04.603 --> 07:09:08.670
HEALTHY FASHION, WE NEED TO BE 
MUCH MORE SENSITIVE AND IT COULD

07:09:08.870 --> 07:09:14.508
HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE TOMORROW.
WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED 

07:09:14.680 --> 07:09:16.680
INFORMATION

07:09:21.817 --> 07:09:30.405
INCLUDING FOR MR. PRESIDENT AND 
WE HAVE POINTED OUT THE FACT 

07:09:30.809 --> 07:09:33.803
THAT WE DO NOT WANT TERRORISM.

07:09:43.600 --> 07:09:45.600
WE GAVE BACK THE LETTER THAT WE 
RECEIVED.

07:09:59.249 --> 07:10:05.082
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOU HAVE 

07:10:05.253 --> 07:10:07.253
DONE

07:10:11.234 --> 07:10:13.669
IN FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I 

07:10:13.868 --> 07:10:18.295
APPRECIATE THAT. 
&gt;&gt;  MY QUESTION IS

07:10:22.802 --> 07:10:25.854
FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH THE 
MIDDLE EAST AND ALL MINORITIES. 

07:10:26.256 --> 07:10:33.881
WHAT IS YOUR POLICY AND A 
QUESTION FOR

07:10:36.825 --> 07:10:39.208
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN, WHY ARE YOU 
NOT ABLE FOR NEGOTIATIONS  IN 

07:10:39.372 --> 07:10:49.214
SYRIA? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I 

07:10:49.416 --> 07:10:51.607
WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE HAD A 
GREAT RELATIONSHIP 

07:10:55.100 --> 07:10:57.100
WITH THE KURDS AND WE FOUGHT 
WITH THEM VERY SUCCESSFULLY 

07:10:57.133 --> 07:10:59.729
AGAINST ISIS. WE FOUGHT TOGETHER
AND WE HAD GREAT GENERALS AND 

07:10:59.899 --> 07:11:03.383
EQUIPMENT AND IT CERTAINLY 
HELPED A LOT. WE WERE VERY 

07:11:03.563 --> 07:11:05.860
SUCCESSFUL AND WE CAPTURED

07:11:13.183 --> 07:11:15.819
100%. WHEN WE WERE AT 97%, I WAS
GOING TO SAY THAT SOUNDS PRETTY 

07:11:16.061 --> 07:11:20.298
HIGH TO ME AND I WAS THINKING 
ABOUT STOPPING AND A LOT OF 

07:11:20.497 --> 07:11:25.369
PEOPLE SAID PLEASE GO TO 100 AND
VERY QUICKLY AND RAPIDLY THE 

07:11:25.568 --> 07:11:28.219
MILITARY GOT TO 100. I WANTED TO
HAVE THAT BUT WE HAVE A GREAT 

07:11:28.419 --> 07:11:32.177
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KURDS AND 
WE GET ALONG WITH THEM

07:11:35.737 --> 07:11:37.969
AND BY THE WAY, I THINK THE 
PRESIDENT MAY HAVE SOME FACTIONS

07:11:38.169 --> 07:11:40.169
WITHIN THE KURDS

07:11:44.253 --> 07:11:46.289
BUT I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS A 
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

07:11:46.531 --> 07:11:48.531
KURDS. MANY LIVE CURRENTLY IN 
TURKEY AND THEY ARE HAPPY AND 

07:11:48.731 --> 07:11:50.966
ARE TAKING CARE OF INCLUDING 
HEALTHCARE. WE WERE TALKING 

07:11:51.168 --> 07:11:55.233
ABOUT IT BEFORE WITH HEALTHCARE 
AND EDUCATION AND OTHER THINGS. 

07:11:55.435 --> 07:11:57.798
OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN A VERY
GOOD ONE. THANK YOU.

07:12:01.321 --> 07:12:07.619
&gt;&gt; FIRST, WE HAVE TO MAKE  A 
DECISION. WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS 

07:12:07.820 --> 07:12:14.728
WITH THE KURDS. WE HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 

07:12:14.929 --> 07:12:16.929
FROM TERRORIST COMING OUT

07:12:21.032 --> 07:12:28.537
WHICH ARE OFFSHOOT ORGANIZATIONS
JUST AS WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH

07:12:28.751 --> 07:12:32.537
OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE 
NORTHERN PARTS AND WE HAVE NO 

07:12:32.704 --> 07:12:34.704
PROBLEMS

07:12:36.671 --> 07:12:40.725
WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF SYRIA. THIS

07:12:40.927 --> 07:12:45.608
WAS NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE 
NORTHERN PART AND I TOLD HIM 

07:12:46.010 --> 07:12:49.463
THAT HE WOULD GIVE THESE 
INDIVIDUALS PASSPORTS AND HE WAS

07:12:49.663 --> 07:12:51.663
MAKING A MISTAKE.

07:12:54.132 --> 07:12:56.132
SECONDLY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW 
THIS.

07:13:00.235 --> 07:13:06.321
THIS IS IN THE TURKISH 
PARLIAMENT. WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND

07:13:07.072 --> 07:13:09.072
OF COURSE

07:13:10.990 --> 07:13:13.440
YOU WILL NOT GIVE UP TO THE 
TERRACE, WILL YOU? NO MATTER WHO

07:13:13.642 --> 07:13:15.642
THEY MIGHT BE.

07:13:20.550 --> 07:13:30.089
THEY DON'T HAVE THE NATIONALITY.
IF YOU DON'T FIGHT BACK THEN YOU

07:13:30.291 --> 07:13:33.942
WILL HAVE TO PAY A VERY HEFTY 
PRICE. THANK YOU. 

07:13:33.943 --> 07:13:35.943
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK 
YOU.
