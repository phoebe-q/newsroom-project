00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.240
it's almost election day

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.000
but not all
Americans will be heading to the polls

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.560
historically only about 4 and 10 voters
turnout for midterm elections here are

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.170
three reasons why first you might just
not care either you feel your vote won't

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.980
matter or you're not a fan of politics
in general and as a result you stay home

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.880
I do not plan on voting. I don't really get into politics

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600
this is
Anna Heaton she's a college student in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.340
West Virginia a state that consistently
has one of the lowest voter turnout rates

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.120
I feel like my one vote isn't
actually going to make a difference

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.180
and voting or not voting is something that
tends to be passed on from generation to generation

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.960
this leads us to reason
number two you don't care about politics

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.280
and the politicians in turn don't care
about you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.320
we know that when institutions

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.799
elect or electoral organizations when
they try to mobilize people turnout as

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.210
higher and different kinds of people
vote so if you don't live in a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
competitive district or you don't belong
to a group they care about you might

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.549
just be in a group they've given up on
which means they might not even try to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.560
reach out and win you over and this
brings us to our third and final reason

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.330
maybe you do care and maybe politicians
care about you back but your state's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
election laws make it really hard to
cast a ballot in the name of preventing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.840
voter fraud many states have made it
difficult to register limited pulling

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.250
times and taking names off the list of
registered voters without telling people

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
they've been removed there will be some
who don't vote because they don't like

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.340
the choice on offer but don't blame low
voter turnout purely on those who can't

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.209
be bothered
