00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.640
- Right now,
pretty much everything

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.980
is going Republicans' way.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.840
You had big, wipe-out elections
in Virginia and New Jersey.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.250
- Oh, what a night it was.
- Didn't win in New Jersey,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.170
but it was a huge shift
in the vote total.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.030
Very low approval ratings
for President Biden right now.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.960
He's dipped into the 30s
in a number of national polls.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.120
You have real kitchen-table
issues that are hitting voters

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.020
that are being blamed now
on Democrats.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.930
- A lot of Republicans would say
it's Trump's party.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.650
- When's the last time
you spoke to Donald Trump?

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.900
- Uh, this morning.
- The base, a lot of members,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.450
if you listen to, do see him
as the leader of their party.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.960
- Wow, thank you
very much, everybody.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.090
- He remains the biggest voice
in the party.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.190
He is continuing to set
the agenda in the party.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.640
Everyone in the party is sort
of operating under his shadow

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.020
or reacting to him.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.510
He continues to pick fights
with other Republicans.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.990
- It's a very tenuous situation,
with Trump, you know,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.610
no longer in office but still
very powerful and influential.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.020
McConnell is in office,
able to raise money,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.710
able to exert his will
in the Senate

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.450
because of the filibuster,
for example.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.370
After the election,
on December 15,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.980
McConnell announced
on the Senate floor that.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.570
- The electoral college
has spoken.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.440
So today, I want to congratulate
President-elect Joe Biden.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.130
- And then McConnell had
a very contentious phone

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.920
call with Trump

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.330
in which he basically told the
President he lost the election.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.950
- Mitch McConnell should have
challenged that election,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.320
because even back then,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.390
we had plenty of material
to challenge that election.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.190
He should have challenged
the election.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.370
- Both of them told me
in interviews

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.190
that they haven't
talked since then.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.720
And Trump has called
for McConnell to be ousted

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.330
as the Senate Republican leader.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.680
- He has demonstrated
that he can increase

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.330
turnout
for Republican candidates.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.190
He can bring people into
the political process

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.220
that Republicans didn't
have access to before.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.090
If you look at the Virginia
election results.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.450
- We won this day!

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.760
- Terry McAuliffe got more votes
than any Democrat

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.230
in the history of that state
and lost pretty handily.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.980
And a lot of that is because
there was massive turnout

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.550
in rural areas of the state.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.700
Youngkin had a real challenge.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.270
He was going into a state,
Virginia,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.470
that has really been voting blue
in recent years.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.080
The way he did it was he didn't
talk about President Trump.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
He didn't engage in the sort
of culture-war stuff

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.030
that former President Trump
was engaged in.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.490
And the key part of all that
was he did it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.690
with Trump's permission.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.810
There were conversations he was
having during the campaign

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.890
with former President Trump
explaining his strategy,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.680
explaining why
he wasn't inviting

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.450
President Trump to Virginia

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.360
to campaign with him,
and Trump was okay with it.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.410
Trump felt like they had
a connection.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.530
Businesspeople.
He respected Youngkin.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.630
He felt like Youngkin was
running on his policy platform.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.490
He felt like he was being
respected by Youngkin,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.900
and so he never made waves.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.070
He wanted the win.
- I did ask him about 2024,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.360
and he said that essentially
he can't declare now,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.150
because there's various
campaign rules.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.160
It would become too complicated.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.030
Certainly at rallies
and conversations,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.220
he's made it seem
like he's running.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.430
You know, you can't absolutely
be certain with Trump,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.000
but he's certainly made all
of the signals as if he will.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.660
And as soon as he says,
"I'm not,"

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.720
his power would immediately
diminish.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.380
So it's also in his interest
in the short-term

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.890
to leave the impression
that he will run.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.520
- There's enormous optimism
when it comes to the House.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.090
It's a five-seat margin
right now.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.650
Redistricting is going to
give Republicans an advantage,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.310
and you have all these
historical crosswinds

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.650
that are going
to help Republicans.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.350
There's very few Democrats
I talk to now

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.010
who think there's much chance
of holding onto the House.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.440
- Here we are, 10 months
or so after the insurrection,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.140
10 months after the inauguration
of Joe Biden,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.300
and Trump is still
the star of his party.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.960
- His currency, in my eye,
I think is very good.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.610
I think he feels like he's in
a very strong position

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.100
to return to power if that's,
you know, what he chooses to do.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.370
- And we will make
America great again!

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.600
- To continue
to maintain his position

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.910
in the Republican party,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.750
we reported that in late August,
he was talking to aides about

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.050
maybe just announcing
for president right then.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.160
I think his mind is also that
if he can come out

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.100
of the midterms
with a Republican win,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.830
he can then take credit for it
in a way that would help him

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.740
going forward into the 2024
presidential election.
