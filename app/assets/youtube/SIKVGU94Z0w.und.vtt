00:30:07.585 --> 00:30:12.413
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GIVE 
THEM THE KIND OF PRIDE AND 

00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:14.646
BOLDNESS THEY NEED TO 

00:30:18.092 --> 00:30:20.548
TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT 

00:30:20.775 --> 00:30:22.872
OF THE UNITED STATES IS 
IMPEACHED FOR HIGH CRIMES AND 

00:30:23.101 --> 00:30:26.205
MISDEMEANORS, ARTICLE 1. 
INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION. 

00:30:26.206 --> 00:30:28.206
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MOST REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO

00:30:32.082 --> 00:30:34.965
VIEW THIS AS INCITEMENT UNDER 
THE LAW. 

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:37.719
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SEND THERE IS WILL DECIDE ON 
THE ONE TRUE QUESTION AT STAKE 

00:30:37.947 --> 00:30:42.897
IN THIS TRIAL, IS DONALD TRUMP 
GUILTY OF INCITING A VIOLENT MOB

00:30:43.129 --> 00:30:45.129
AGAINST THE 

00:30:48.143 --> 00:30:50.143
UNITED STATES?

00:30:54.108 --> 00:30:56.625
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DAY TWO OF THE IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL OF DONALD TRUMP AS HOUSE 

00:30:56.852 --> 00:30:58.852
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARGUE THEIR
CASE THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT 

00:30:58.925 --> 00:31:01.523
INCITED A MOB TO ATTACK THE US 
CAPITAL. BREAKING NEWS THIS 

00:31:01.773 --> 00:31:03.773
MORNING THAT THEY PLAN 

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.920
TO SHOW NEW EVIDENCE TODAY 
PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN FOOTAGE FROM 

00:31:08.144 --> 00:31:10.144
INSIDE THE CAPITAL ON JANUARY 6 
DURING 

00:31:13.944 --> 00:31:16.994
THE INSURRECTION. I AM LINDA AND
YOU ARE WATCHING A WASHINGTON 

00:31:17.226 --> 00:31:19.529
POST TO SPECIAL REPORT. THE POST
HAS LEARNED THE FOOTAGE FROM 

00:31:19.759 --> 00:31:21.827
SECURITY CAMERAS WILL SHOW HOW 
PRECARIOUSLY CLOSE THE MOB CAME 

00:31:22.054 --> 00:31:24.565
TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR
STAFF. LET'S GET INTO IT WITH 

00:31:28.362 --> 00:31:31.684
MY GUEST, RHONDA, CAPITOL HILL 
REPORTER, JOYCE POLITICAL VIDEO 

00:31:31.916 --> 00:31:33.916
REPORTER IN JEANS, WASHINGTON 
POST COLUMNIST. WELCOME TO 

00:31:37.774 --> 00:31:40.207
YOU ALL. RHONDA, WHAT IS THE 
EXPECTED PUNCH OF THE NEW 

00:31:40.436 --> 00:31:42.484
FOOTAGE WE WILL SEE TODAY AND 
WHAT TO HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

00:31:42.711 --> 00:31:44.944
MANAGERS HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN 
THEIR ARGUMENTS? 

00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:46.945
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS EXPECTED TODAY WITH 
THIS NEVER BEFORE 

00:31:51.518 --> 00:31:55.668
SEEN FOOTAGE, IT IS GOING TO BE 
COMING FROM SECURITY CAMERAS AND

00:31:55.895 --> 00:31:58.438
THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MOST 
OF THE FOOTAGE WE HAVE ALL SEEN 

00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:00.748
PUBLICLY HAS BEEN SELF ON 
FOOTAGE FROM THE WRITERS WHO 

00:32:00.979 --> 00:32:03.413
POSTED IT ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA 
AND STAFFERS AND REPORTERS WHO 

00:32:03.642 --> 00:32:06.415
WERE ABLE TO GET SCENES IN THE 
HALLWAYS AND SOME OF THE OFFICES

00:32:06.651 --> 00:32:08.651
THAT WERE RANSACKED BUT THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE GOING 

00:32:08.737 --> 00:32:12.367
TO USE THE SECURITY FOOTAGE TO 
SHOW THAT ANGLE TO SHOW THAT 

00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:14.685
THESE WRITERS, THOSE WHO ARE 
PART OF THE INSURRECTION CAME 

00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:17.521
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, THEIR STAFF AND THE 

00:32:17.753 --> 00:32:20.342
VICE PRESIDENT WHO WAS HERE WITH
HIS FAMILY THAT THEY ON JANUARY 

00:32:20.575 --> 00:32:23.279
6. THE HOUSE MANAGERS WANT TO 
PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF 

00:32:23.515 --> 00:32:25.964
YESTERDAY. YOU SAW THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER SHOWED A 

00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:28.192
VERY VIVID 

00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:32.977
MONTAGE CLIP OF SOME OF THE 
FOOTAGE FROM THAT DAY FROM 

00:32:33.207 --> 00:32:35.962
OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL AS WELL AS 
INSIDE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE 

00:32:36.193 --> 00:32:38.050
ARE SAYING THAT THAT 
PRESENTATION BY THE HOUSE 

00:32:38.051 --> 00:32:40.051
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WAS REALLY 

00:32:41.763 --> 00:32:44.256
REALLY CRITICAL. IT WAS VIVID 
AND IT BROUGHT BACK THE REASON 

00:32:44.488 --> 00:32:47.054
WHY EVERYONE IS HERE THIS WEEK 
WHICH IS THE WORDS THAT TRUMP 

00:32:47.289 --> 00:32:52.092
USED LED TO THAT INSURRECTION. I
SUSPECT THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.320
REALLY WANT TO KEEP 

00:32:57.398 --> 00:32:59.519
THAT GOING. THEY TALKED ABOUT 
THAT BEING PART OF THEIR 

00:32:59.747 --> 00:33:02.358
STRATEGY, THEY WANT TO BRING THE
EMOTION BACK INTO THIS AND I 

00:33:02.603 --> 00:33:05.300
MAKE IT SO MUCH ABOUT POLITICS 
BUT TO APPEAL TO THE SENATORS 

00:33:05.531 --> 00:33:07.603
THAT THEY ALL WERE UNDER SIEGE 
AND IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. 

00:33:07.845 --> 00:33:09.845
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHOICE IS LIVE AT THE WHITE 

00:33:12.829 --> 00:33:15.262
HOUSE TODAY. WHAT ARE WE HEARING
FROM A FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP 

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.493
AND HIS TEAM IN REACTION TO 
YESTERDAY'S TRIAL 

00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:22.328
ARGUMENTS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:24.329
ATTORNEYS ESPECIALLY BRUCE 
CASTOR LEFT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

00:33:24.538 --> 00:33:26.538
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS. CASTOR 
GAVE A PRETTY 

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.155
RAMBLING ARGUMENT WHERE HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE 

00:33:31.385 --> 00:33:33.235
NOT NECESSARILY PERTAINING TO 
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY WHICH IS 

00:33:33.236 --> 00:33:36.127
WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
ARGUING AGAINST. HE REALLY WENT 

00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:41.392
INTO A TANGENT AND OFF-TRACK AND
NOT REALLY ARGUING IN DEFENSE OF

00:33:41.877 --> 00:33:45.166
TRUMP UNTIL THE VERY END OF HIS 
45 MINUTE SPEECH ON THE 

00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:51.028
SENATE FLOOR. WE HEARD FROM 
CASTOR HIMSELF AS WELL AS TRUMP 

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.917
ADVISORS THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH
TRUMP'S LEGAL STRATEGY THAT 

00:33:54.146 --> 00:33:56.146
AFTER HEARING THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS PRESENT 

00:33:56.232 --> 00:33:59.685
THEIR CASE AS WELL AS THAT 
SEVERAL MINUTES LONG VIDEO 

00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:01.912
SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED DURING 

00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:05.812
THE INSURRECTION THAT THEY 
CHANGED THEIR STRATEGY, THEY 

00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:09.423
STARTED OFF THIS WAY AS SOME 
SORT OF STRATEGY TO WHAT THEY 

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:12.018
SAID IS QUOTE LOWER THE 
TEMPERATURE BEFORE PRESENTING 

00:34:12.257 --> 00:34:16.845
THEIR NEXT LAWYER DAVID WHO 
PRESENTED A VERY DIFFERENT TONE.

00:34:17.073 --> 00:34:19.073
WE KNOW THIS DID NOT GO OVER 

00:34:22.095 --> 00:34:24.268
WELL WITH MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 
BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 

00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:27.609
AS WELL AS TRUMP HIMSELF. THERE 
WERE REPORTS THAT HE WAS FURIOUS

00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:32.172
AT THE ARGUMENTS THAT CASTOR WAS
MAKING ON THE FLOOR, THAT HE WAS

00:34:32.397 --> 00:34:38.045
CONFUSED AS TO WHY HE WAS SAYING
THINGS THAT WERE FAVORABLE TO 

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.682
HIS OPPONENTS. WE ALSO HEARD 
THAT TRUMP'S ADVISORS WERE 

00:34:42.917 --> 00:34:47.413
UNDERWHELMED BY THE PERFORMANCE.
SOME OF THOSE LAWMAKERS WE HEARD

00:34:47.643 --> 00:34:49.643
FROM YESTERDAY IN REACTION TO 

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.411
CASTOR'S ARGUMENTS, TED CRUZ, 
SAYING IT WAS QUOTE NOT 

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.859
EFFECTIVE. SENATOR LISA SAYING 
IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR 

00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:03.387
BRUCE CASTOR AND I THINK MOST 
NOTABLY SENATOR BILL CASSIDY, A 

00:35:03.624 --> 00:35:05.701
REPUBLICAN FROM LOUISIANA WHO 
SAID HE HAD CHANGED HIS VOTE 

00:35:05.926 --> 00:35:09.446
AFTER HEARING THIS SHODDY 
DEFENSE FROM TRUMP'S LAWYERS. HE

00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:11.672
ENDED UP VOTING WITH HIS FIVE 

00:35:15.452 --> 00:35:17.452
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES

00:35:19.376 --> 00:35:21.822
, SIDING WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON 
THE FACT THAT THIS WAS 

00:35:22.046 --> 00:35:24.137
CONSTITUTIONAL, THE CASE COULD 
CONTINUE WHICH WE SAW WAS THE 

00:35:24.366 --> 00:35:26.654
RESULT OF YESTERDAY'S FINAL VOTE
ON THE SENATE FLOOR. WE PROBABLY

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.740
WON'T HEAR FROM TRUMP'S 
ATTORNEYS AGAIN UNTIL FRIDAY. 

00:35:28.741 --> 00:35:30.741
EACH SIDE 

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:35.452
HAS ABOUT 16 HOURS TO SPEAK. WE 
KNOW THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

00:35:35.678 --> 00:35:37.977
MANAGERS PROBABLY WON'T BE 
TAKING UP ALL THAT TIME BUT OVER

00:35:38.207 --> 00:35:40.987
THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS, IT WILL 
BE GIVEN 16 HOURS TO PRESENT 

00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:48.463
THEIR ARGUMENTS AND JUST TIMING 
WISE FRIDAY IS PROBABLY THE NEXT

00:35:48.696 --> 00:35:51.004
TIME WE WILL BE HEARING FROM 
TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS ON THE FLOOR 

00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:54.501
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE
WILL ALL BE WATCHING FOR IS TO 

00:35:54.731 --> 00:35:57.494
SEE IF BRUCE CASTOR AGAIN GIVES 
A RAMBLING DEFENSE OF TRUMP OR 

00:35:57.726 --> 00:36:00.496
IF THAT WAS ACTUALLY A STRATEGY 
THAT THEY WERE USING AND IF YOU 

00:36:00.727 --> 00:36:03.070
GIVE SOME SUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS 
THE NEXT TIME WE HEAR HIM SPEAK.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.374
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
APPRECIATED THAT. JOYCE WAS JUST

00:36:08.742 --> 00:36:10.742
TALKING ABOUT THE DEFENSE 
YESTERDAY. WE WILL BE HEARING 

00:36:10.963 --> 00:36:14.759
MORE FROM THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS TODAY. THAT WILL BE THE

00:36:14.985 --> 00:36:17.320
FOCUS BUT LET'S DIG INTO MORE OF
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY BEFORE 

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.088
WE MOVE FORWARD. THE LEADING 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER GAVE THIS 

00:36:22.328 --> 00:36:24.396
VERY EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT AND 
BRUCE CASTOR HAD TO STAND UP 

00:36:26.411 --> 00:36:28.411
RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND GIVE THE 
COUNTERPOINT. HE SAID EVEN 

00:36:28.493 --> 00:36:30.965
THOUGH THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6 
WERE HORRIFIC AND PEOPLE SHOULD 

00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:37.485
FACE CONSEQUENCES

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.796
, THE PERSON TO FACE 
CONSEQUENCES IS NOT DONALD 

00:36:40.913 --> 00:36:42.913
TRUMP. LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANYBODY 

00:36:43.126 --> 00:36:45.126
REPRESENTING FORMER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAY ANYTHING AT ALL OTHER 

00:36:45.218 --> 00:36:50.059
THAN WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6 
AND THE STORMING, BREACHING OF 

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.713
THE CAPITAL SHOULD BE DENOUNCED 
IN THE MOST 

00:37:00.327 --> 00:37:04.073
VIGOROUS TERMS. NOR THAT THOSE 
PERSONS RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE 

00:37:04.315 --> 00:37:09.590
PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
THAT OUR LAWS ALLOW AND I HAVE 

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:14.121
FOLLOWED THOSE CASES AND IT 
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE ARE DOING A 

00:37:14.351 --> 00:37:18.936
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IDENTIFYING 
AND PROSECUTING THOSE PERSONS 

00:37:19.173 --> 00:37:21.173
WHO COMMITTED 

00:37:22.479 --> 00:37:24.343
THOSE OFFENSES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS FROM YESTERDAY. LET'S

00:37:24.344 --> 00:37:27.959
GO TO JAMES. SO JAMES, JOYCE 
ENDED UP REALLY 

00:37:31.812 --> 00:37:34.119
WELL, REPUBLICANS DID NOT HAVE 
MUCH TO HANG ANY SORT OF 

00:37:35.277 --> 00:37:37.296
ARGUMENT ON BASED ON WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS SAID 

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.530
YESTERDAY. SO LET'S 

00:37:42.923 --> 00:37:47.908
TALK ABOUT THE JOB THAT THEY DID
AND WHAT POSITION THAT NOW PUTS 

00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:50.024
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. YESTERDAY WAS 

00:37:50.025 --> 00:37:51.644
VISCERAL. WE SAW THAT 
PRESENTATION FROM CONGRESSMAN 

00:37:51.645 --> 00:37:54.250
RASKIN WHO JUST THE DAY AFTER 
BURYING HIS SON FEARED THAT HE 

00:37:54.484 --> 00:37:57.165
WOULD LOSE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER
IN THE CAPITAL TALKING AT THE 

00:37:57.405 --> 00:37:59.405
SCENE OF 

00:38:01.273 --> 00:38:03.602
THE CRIME ABOUT MEMBERS PUTTING 
OFF THEIR PAINS SO THEY WOULDN'T

00:38:03.836 --> 00:38:06.877
GET ATTACKED BY THE MOB, THAT 
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL VIDEO IN 

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:09.109
WHICH TRUMP ESSENTIALLY SERVED 
AS 

00:38:12.585 --> 00:38:15.120
THE NARRATOR AND THE POWERFUL 
MISS OF THAT, THE VISCERAL MISS 

00:38:15.347 --> 00:38:17.802
OF THAT REALLY WAS JUST SUCH A 
STARK CONTRAST WITH WHAT 

00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:20.421
FOLLOWED. CASTOR'S SPEECH WAS 
RAMBLING, SHOWING GAVE A 

00:38:24.223 --> 00:38:26.908
TRUMP REMARK. HE SPOKE FOR ABOUT
20 MINUTES LONGER THAN THE FIRST

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.252
TRUMP DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND HE 
OFFERED A SERIES OF LEGITIMATE 

00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:32.958
PROCEDURAL ARGUMENTS, 
CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS SAYING 

00:38:33.193 --> 00:38:38.506
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TRY A FORMER 
PRESIDENT. ULTIMATELY AND A 

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT VOTE, 

00:38:42.909 --> 00:38:44.909
SIX REPUBLICANS VOTED TO MOVE 
AHEAD WITH 

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.679
THE TRIAL. IF THAT PACE 
CONTINUES, THIS WILL BE THE MOST

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.557
BIPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY. OUR COLLEAGUES

00:38:53.787 --> 00:38:56.924
MENTIONED BILL CASSIDY FROM 
LOUISIANA, THE WHOLE IDEA OF 

00:38:57.182 --> 00:38:59.182
YESTERDAY, THE WHOLE REASON 

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.843
THAT REPUBLICANS LEADERS, MITCH 
McCONNELL AND TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS 

00:39:05.083 --> 00:39:07.083
NEGOTIATED TO HAVE THIS FIRST 
DAY TO 

00:39:10.127 --> 00:39:12.334
FOCUS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE 
TRIAL WAS EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL 

00:39:12.561 --> 00:39:15.764
WAS ABOUT GIVING PROCEDURAL 
EXCUSES AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOR 

00:39:15.995 --> 00:39:18.785
REPUBLICANS TO VOTE AGAINST 
IMPEACHMENT. THE FACT THAT THE 

00:39:19.016 --> 00:39:21.971
TRUMP LAWYERS DID SO POORLY IN 
THE TRUMP TEAM 

00:39:25.773 --> 00:39:27.859
FREELY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THEY 
DID A TERRIBLE JOB. SEAN HANNITY

00:39:28.085 --> 00:39:30.164
WERE PENNING THEIR PERFORMANCE 
LAST NIGHT. THAT MAKES IT HARDER

00:39:30.394 --> 00:39:33.195
FOR SOME OF THESE SENATE 
REPUBLICANS TO USE THOSE 

00:39:33.425 --> 00:39:35.951
PROCEDURAL EXCUSES TO JUSTIFY 
NOT CONDONING OR CONDEMNING 

00:39:40.937 --> 00:39:43.430
TRUMPS BEHAVIOR THAT LED 
DIRECTLY TO THE RIGHT. SO THAT 

00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:47.190
IS WHY YESTERDAY WAS SO 
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT UNDERCUTS

00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:49.511
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS HAD BEEN HOPING TO 

00:39:49.742 --> 00:39:53.713
HANG THEIR HAT ON THAT IS NOT 
THERE FOR THEM NOW AND IT IS 

00:39:53.942 --> 00:39:56.477
GOING TO PUT THEM IN A TRICKIER 
POSITION ESPECIALLY AS WE GET 

00:39:56.708 --> 00:39:59.086
INTO THE MEAT OF THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CASE LATER 

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.320
TODAY. 

00:40:02.741 --> 00:40:05.480
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, IT IS MORE BENIGN TO 
ARGUE ABOUT CONSTITUTIONALITY 

00:40:05.713 --> 00:40:10.725
THAN IT IS TO ARGUE ABOUT THE 
HORRIFIC EVENTS OF JANUARY 6 AND

00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:13.513
THE PRESIDENTS DIRECT OR 
INDIRECT ROLE IN THAT. SO 

00:40:13.742 --> 00:40:15.742
YESTERDAY WAS REALLY 

00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:20.932
THE OPPORTUNITY AS YOU STATE FOR
THE REPUBLICANS TO SAY LOOK I'M 

00:40:21.172 --> 00:40:23.949
NOT EVEN GOING TO SUPPORT THIS 
MOVING FORWARD, BUT EVEN THOUGH 

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.834
WE SAW SIX OF THEM CROSS OVER TO
GO WITH THE DEMOCRATS, SO MANY 

00:40:30.067 --> 00:40:32.857
OF THEM, ALL THE REST OF THEM 
STILL SAID THEY BELIEVE THIS IS 

00:40:33.091 --> 00:40:35.312
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WHAT DOES THAT
TELL US ABOUT THEIR FRAME OF 

00:40:35.549 --> 00:40:38.169
MIND AND HOW OPEN OR FRANKLY NOT
OPEN THEY ARE TO REALLY 

00:40:38.406 --> 00:40:40.561
LISTENING TO THE ARGUMENTS 
BEFORE THEM? 

00:40:40.562 --> 00:40:47.630
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES ANY REAL TRIAL, THE 
JURORS ARE REQUIRED TO BE 

00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:49.863
IMPARTIAL. IMPEACHMENTS BY 
DEFINITION ARE 

00:40:53.316 --> 00:40:55.763
POLITICAL TRIALS. THE TRUMP TEAM
KNOWS THAT TO WIN, THEY JUST 

00:40:55.995 --> 00:41:00.420
NEED TO CONVINCE 34 REPUBLICANS 
TO NOT AFFECT FROM THE 

00:41:00.653 --> 00:41:05.050
PRESIDENT. YOU SAW THE LOUISIANA
REPUBLICAN PARTY PUT OUT A VERY 

00:41:05.282 --> 00:41:07.044
STRONGLY WORDED STATEMENT 
ATTACKING BILL CASSIDY, THEIR 

00:41:07.045 --> 00:41:11.950
STATE SENIOR SENATOR AFTER HE 
VOTED TO ALLOW THE TRIAL TO GO 

00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:17.103
FORWARD AND I THINK THAT ELEMENT
IS REALLY IMPORTANT, THE FEAR 

00:41:17.331 --> 00:41:19.331
THAT A LOT OF 

00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:24.456
THESE REPUBLICANS FEEL. THEY 
WERE THERE, EVERY ONE OF THEM 

00:41:24.979 --> 00:41:28.197
WAS THERE ON JANUARY 6. ALL OF 
THEM HAD TO EVACUATE. THEY ALL 

00:41:28.437 --> 00:41:33.014
HAVE THEIR OWN STORIES AND THEY 
DON'T WANT TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT 

00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:36.981
HAPPENS. THEY DON'T WANT TO RISK
THEIR POLITICAL CAREERS IN MANY 

00:41:37.343 --> 00:41:40.579
CASES TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO IS 
NO LONGER IN OFFICE AND TO THE 

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.810
BASE OF THE PARTY 

00:41:45.514 --> 00:41:48.224
STILL LOVES. THERE WERE THREE 
NEW POLLS THAT CAME OUT IN THE 

00:41:48.466 --> 00:41:51.632
LAST 24 HOURS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT,
AND ALL OF THEM SHOW THAT NO 

00:41:51.863 --> 00:41:54.106
MORE THAN 60% OF AMERICANS 
SUPPORT REMOVING TRUMP OR 

00:41:54.337 --> 00:41:58.188
CONVICTING TRUMP TO PREVENT HIM 
FROM RUNNING AGAIN. IT IS REALLY

00:41:58.418 --> 00:42:00.750
PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE 
NUMBERS WERE IN THE POLLS AT 

00:42:00.977 --> 00:42:04.184
THIS STAGE OF THE TRIAL LAST 
YEAR. SO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS 

00:42:04.428 --> 00:42:08.257
STILL STICKING WITH TRUMP EVEN 
IF THEY DISAPPROVE OF THE WAY HE

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.561
HANDLED THIS WHOLE AFFAIR, EVEN 
IF THEY BELIEVE HE IS 

00:42:10.788 --> 00:42:14.765
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, AND YOU SAW 
THAT 13 MINUTE VIDEO THAT WAS SO

00:42:14.995 --> 00:42:17.237
POWERFUL THAT THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS PLAYED 

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:21.618
DURING THEIR OPENING CASE 
YESTERDAY. OUR REPORTER WHO WAS 

00:42:21.854 --> 00:42:24.415
IN THE SENATE CHAMBER SAID A LOT
OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 

00:42:24.645 --> 00:42:28.182
PHYSICALLY LOOKING AWAY SO THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH 

00:42:32.979 --> 00:42:35.778
THE VIDEO. THEY WERE LOOKING AT 
BLANK PIECES OF PAPER. THEY WERE

00:42:36.014 --> 00:42:38.347
DRAWING DOODLES AND LOOKING AT 
EACH OTHER BUT THEY WERE TRYING 

00:42:38.709 --> 00:42:41.809
NOT TO ENGAGE WITH WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED. THAT IS THEIR STRATEGY

00:42:42.042 --> 00:42:46.519
AND ULTIMATELY, I THINK THEY 
HOPE THAT PEOPLE JUST SORT OF 

00:42:46.747 --> 00:42:52.146
WILL MOVE ON AND IT WAS SORT OF 
IRONIC BECAUSE WE HEARD TRUMPS 

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.085
LAWYER ARGUED THAT IT WAS UNFAIR
TO PLAY THAT VIDEO. WE JUST 

00:42:55.316 --> 00:42:57.914
HEARD IN THAT CLIP THAT YOU JUST
PLAYED HIM SAYING WE STIPULATE 

00:42:58.144 --> 00:43:00.144
THAT THE RIGHT 

00:43:02.097 --> 00:43:05.028
WAS TERRIBLE. IT SORT OF FELT 
IRONIC TO HAVE A LAWYER FOR THE 

00:43:05.255 --> 00:43:08.210
REALITY TELEVISION PRESIDENT WHO
IS ALL ABOUT MADE FOR TV DRAMA 

00:43:08.441 --> 00:43:14.887
CRITICIZING THE OTHER SIDE FOR 
PUTTING TOGETHER A REALLY 

00:43:15.257 --> 00:43:17.257
COMPELLING VISUAL CASE AGAINST 
HIM. 

00:43:19.365 --> 00:43:21.682
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. JAMES, ALSO THE ATTORNEY
ADMITTING THAT TRUMP DIDN'T WIN 

00:43:21.911 --> 00:43:23.911
THE ELECTION WHICH IS FACTUAL 
BUT 

00:43:27.626 --> 00:43:33.407
WAS STILL SHOCKING TO HEAR OUT 
OF THE MOUTHS OF A LAWYER 

00:43:33.635 --> 00:43:35.718
WORKING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
LET'S TALK TO RUNNER TO TALK 

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:38.371
ABOUT SENATOR BILL CASSIDY AND 
HIS DECISION TO VOTE THAT THIS 

00:43:38.605 --> 00:43:40.605
PROCESS IS CONSTITUTIONAL. WHAT 
JUSTIFICATION DID HE GIVE TO 

00:43:40.697 --> 00:43:42.550
THAT AND WHAT INSIGHT DOES THAT 
GIVE YOU? 

00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:46.616
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE INDICATION HE DID GIVE 
ABOUT HIS VOTE IS HE SAID THAT 

00:43:46.846 --> 00:43:50.031
BRUCE CASTOR'S ARGUMENT ABOUT 
THIS BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL WAS 

00:43:50.264 --> 00:43:52.110
DISORGANIZED. IT WAS PRETTY 
CRITICAL ABOUT TRUMP'S LAWYERS 

00:43:52.111 --> 00:43:54.111
AND THEIR 

00:43:57.077 --> 00:43:59.710
ARGUMENT YESTERDAY FOR THIS NOT 
BEING CONSTITUTIONAL. SO WHAT 

00:43:59.942 --> 00:44:02.705
THIS DOES SHOW IS THERE IS A 
LITTLE BIT OF ROOM FOR DEFECTION

00:44:02.939 --> 00:44:05.020
AND WE ARE SEEING SOME 
REPUBLICANS, CASSIDY FOR 

00:44:05.248 --> 00:44:07.248
INSTANCE AND THE OTHER FIVE 
REPUBLICANS WHO JOINED DEMOCRATS

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:12.108
TO SAY IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL, 
THEY ARE GOING INTO THIS BEING 

00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:15.547
THE IMPARTIAL JURORS THAT THEY 
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. THEY SIGN AN

00:44:15.776 --> 00:44:17.881
OATH ACTUALLY RIGHT AFTER THE 
ARTICLE IS BROUGHT INTO THE 

00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:21.380
SENATE CHAMBER, THEY SIGN IN AN 
OATH BUT THAT THEY WILL BE 

00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:26.243
JURORS AND IMPARTIAL. I THINK HE
IS SHOWCASING THAT AUNTIE IS 

00:44:26.474 --> 00:44:28.781
DOING IT AT SOME POLITICAL RISK 
TO HIMSELF. AS JAMES MENTIONED, 

00:44:29.008 --> 00:44:31.991
HIS CONSTITUENTS THERE HAVEN'T 
BEEN HAPPY WITH HIS DECISION 

00:44:33.096 --> 00:44:36.745
LAST NIGHT AND I THINK A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS ARE ALSO THINKING 

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.259
THAT AS THEIR FOREMOST PRIORITY 
IN THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. WILL 

00:44:40.488 --> 00:44:42.488
THIS HURT THEM AND THEIR 

00:44:46.239 --> 00:44:50.826
REELECTION CHANCES? FEW OF THEM 
ARE UP FOR REELECTION IN 2022 SO

00:44:51.057 --> 00:44:53.738
THAT IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
SO THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT 

00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:55.971
AND THERE IS PERSONAL DANGER 
ALSO. SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS 

00:44:56.062 --> 00:44:58.062
RECEIVED ALL SORTS OF CALLS AND 

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.246
DEATH THREATS. IT WAS A VIDEO OF
LINDSEY GRAHAM WHEN HE WENT TO 

00:45:05.475 --> 00:45:08.256
CATCH HIS FLIGHT IF YOU DAYS 
AFTER THE SIXTH TO GO BACK HOME 

00:45:08.484 --> 00:45:11.478
TO SOUTH CAROLINA. HE WAS MET BY
A SMALL MOB AT THE DC AIRPORT 

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:14.924
WHO TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS A 
TRAITOR. THAT IS ALSO A PART OF 

00:45:15.155 --> 00:45:17.486
THIS IS THERE IS A PERSONAL 
DANGER UNFORTUNATELY AS A PART 

00:45:17.752 --> 00:45:20.093
OF MAKING THESE TYPES OF 
DECISIONS AS A REPUBLICAN IF YOU

00:45:20.325 --> 00:45:21.962
ARE GOING TO SUPPORT TRUMP OR 
NOT. 

00:45:21.963 --> 00:45:25.361
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO NOW TO PAUL, SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT. IT 

00:45:25.604 --> 00:45:27.604
IS SO GOOD TO 

00:45:29.765 --> 00:45:32.792
SEE YOU. I JUST WANT TO START 
WITH THE BASICS OF WHAT WE SAW 

00:45:33.158 --> 00:45:35.717
FROM BOTH SIDES. WE HAD THIS 
CONTRAST OF EMOTION ON ONE PART 

00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:38.346
AS WELL AS TAKING THROUGH THE 
ARGUMENTS 

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.307
OF CONSTITUTIONALITY BY THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THE 

00:45:45.312 --> 00:45:48.093
DEMOCRATS AND THEN WE SAW ON THE
BEHALF OF THE DEFENSE TEAM A 

00:45:48.327 --> 00:45:51.264
DISTRACTION IN THE FORM OF BRUCE
CASTOR AND THEN JUST DENIAL AND 

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:55.986
ALSO ANGER ON THE PART OF THE 
OTHER ATTORNEY, DAVID. SO ARE 

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:02.503
THE STRATEGIES WORKING? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES AND NO. ON THE ONE HAND, 

00:46:02.734 --> 00:46:06.530
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WALKED 
OUT YESTERDAY WITH AN 

00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:09.892
UNBELIEVABLY CLEAR AND 
CONVINCING WHEN. EVERYBODY SAID 

00:46:10.123 --> 00:46:17.097
THEIR CASE WAS SHARP BOTH 
LEGALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. THEY 

00:46:17.469 --> 00:46:20.454
CONNECTED EVERYTHING FROM RIGHT 
AFTER THE ELECTION ALL THE WAY 

00:46:20.687 --> 00:46:22.687
UP TO JANUARY 

00:46:25.214 --> 00:46:27.880
6 AND IN TRUMP'S OWN SPEECH THAT
DAY AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER 

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.420
TRUMPS SPEECH, THEY HIT ON EVERY
POSSIBLE LEVEL. THE DEFENSE, 

00:46:33.649 --> 00:46:38.352
THEY DID NOT. THE BEST WAY TO 
TRY AND 

00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:45.047
POSSIBLY DESCRIBE THEIR EFFORTS 
WAS THAT BRUCE CASTOR WAS TRYING

00:46:45.275 --> 00:46:48.169
TO PLAY THE GOOD COP AND HE WAS 
TRYING TO BE COMPLEMENTARY TO 

00:46:48.403 --> 00:46:50.700
SENATORS AND SUCK UP TO THEM. 
INSTEAD IT WAS KIND OF 

00:46:50.927 --> 00:46:54.148
MEANDERING AND AS RHONDA WAS 
JUST POINTING OUT, EVEN BILL 

00:46:54.379 --> 00:46:57.191
CASSIDY PRETTY MUCH CAME OUT AND
SAID IT WAS CLEAR CUT ONE SIDE 

00:46:57.426 --> 00:47:02.244
HAD THE BETTER CASE. NOW ALL 
THAT BEING SAID LIBBY, THE 

00:47:02.475 --> 00:47:05.546
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS COULD NOT 
HAVE HAD A BETTER DAY AND ALL 

00:47:05.783 --> 00:47:09.930
THEY SWITCHED WAS ONE SINGLE 
VOTE, BILL CASSIDY'S. SO THAT 

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:16.446
GETS YOU 256. THAT IS 11 SHORT 
OF 67. YOU NOW HAD TWO 

00:47:16.677 --> 00:47:21.352
PROCEDURAL VOTES ON THIS MATTER 
AND 44 REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW 

00:47:21.583 --> 00:47:28.073
VOTED TWICE THAT THIS IS AN 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL CASE. IT IS 

00:47:28.301 --> 00:47:33.063
REALLY HARD TO SEE ONCE HE VOTED
TWICE THAT THIS THING IS 

00:47:33.298 --> 00:47:35.857
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, IT IS REALLY 
HARD TO SEE HOW YOU ARE GOING TO

00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:40.508
TURN AROUND AND VOTE A VOTE 
DIFFERENTLY. IT IS A REALLY 

00:47:40.883 --> 00:47:43.648
REALLY STEEP CLIMB FOR HOUSE 
MANAGERS, AND THEY HAD A GOOD 

00:47:43.877 --> 00:47:45.877
DAY 

00:47:48.837 --> 00:47:53.612
AS THEY COULD'VE POSSIBLY HAD 
AND YET THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE 

00:47:53.865 --> 00:47:55.992
MIND, ONE VOTE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

00:47:56.219 --> 00:47:58.753
WHAT THE REACTION IS TO BILL 
CASSIDY. WE HEARD FROM JAMES HE 

00:47:58.982 --> 00:48:01.203
IS GETTING CRITICIZED BACK HOME 
IN LOUISIANA. IT WILL BE 

00:48:01.436 --> 00:48:04.136
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF 
TRIAL BALLOON THAT IS FOR THE 

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:07.442
REST OF THE SENATORS TO SEE AT 
THIS POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS IF

00:48:07.671 --> 00:48:10.203
YOU DO TAKE A VOTE EVEN ON A 
PROCEDURAL MOVE ESSENTIALLY OVER

00:48:10.434 --> 00:48:12.434
THE NEXT DAYS, DOES 

00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:19.011
THAT IMPACT YOUR STANDING BACK 
HOME? IS THERE A CHANCE OF MORE 

00:48:19.244 --> 00:48:23.291
REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS GIVEN WHAT
YOU JUST LAID OUT FOR US? 

00:48:23.292 --> 00:48:27.526
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS HARD TO SEE AND THERE 
IS A GROUP OF THEM, PEOPLE THAT 

00:48:27.756 --> 00:48:29.756
YOU WOULD NORMALLY 

00:48:31.558 --> 00:48:36.272
THINK OF AS SORT OF CENTRIST, 
SORT OF AT LEAST INSTITUTIONAL 

00:48:36.504 --> 00:48:39.205
TYPE OF REPUBLICANS WHO MIGHT BE
WILLING TO CONSIDER A VOTE ON 

00:48:39.436 --> 00:48:42.933
THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE ATTACK
ON CONGRESS AS 

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.641
AN INSTITUTION BUT THOSE ARE 
FOLKS THAT ARE UP FOR REELECTION

00:48:48.868 --> 00:48:53.897
IN 2022, PEOPLE LIKE ROY BLUNT, 
JERRY OF KANSAS AND IT IS REALLY

00:48:54.152 --> 00:48:56.152
HARD TO ENVISION TAKING A VOTE 

00:48:59.392 --> 00:49:01.835
LIKE THIS IF YOU ARE IN A 
CONSERVATIVE LEANING STATE AND 

00:49:02.065 --> 00:49:06.496
YOUR BIGGEST FEAR IS A PRIMARY 
CHALLENGE FROM THE SORT OF TRUMP

00:49:06.734 --> 00:49:13.029
RIGHT-WING OF FAR RIGHT WING OF 
YOUR VOTER BASE, THIS IS A VOTE 

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.260
THAT PEOPLE 

00:49:17.262 --> 00:49:19.911
WILL REMEMBER. BILL CASSIDY HAS 
THE FREEDOM BECAUSE HE JUST WON 

00:49:20.146 --> 00:49:22.146
REELECTION. HE 

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.561
EASILY WON, HIS NEAREST 
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT WAS 40 

00:49:25.578 --> 00:49:27.578
POINTS 

00:49:30.203 --> 00:49:34.387
BEHIND HIM AND HE HAS SIX FULL 
YEARS BEFORE HE HAS TO FACE THE 

00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:36.700
VOTERS IN LOUISIANA AGAIN. HE 
HAS MORE FREEDOM THAN THESE 

00:49:36.927 --> 00:49:39.476
OTHER FOLKS. SO IT IS JUST 
REALLY HARD BOTH ON POLITICS AND

00:49:39.704 --> 00:49:42.227
THE PROCESS NOW THAT YOU HAVE 
HAD THESE TWO VOTES THAT ARE 

00:49:42.459 --> 00:49:45.852
REALLY STARTING TO BACON WHERE 
THE WHOLE FIELD ESSENTIALLY, THE

00:49:49.962 --> 00:49:52.045
JURY BUYS -- LIES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO PLAY YOU 

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:58.330
A CLIP BY ONE OF THE IMPEACHMENT
MANAGERS AND HE RECOUNTED HIS 

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:02.199
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE GETTING 
CONCERNED TEXTS FROM HIS FAMILY 

00:50:02.431 --> 00:50:04.047
ON JANUARY 6. SO LET'S WATCH 
THAT. 

00:50:04.048 --> 00:50:06.837
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HONESTLY, IT IS HARD TO 
IMAGINE A CLEARER EXAMPLE OF HOW

00:50:08.044 --> 00:50:10.044
A PRESIDENT COULD ABUSE 

00:50:12.511 --> 00:50:15.961
HIS OFFICE, INCITING VIOLENCE 
AGAINST A COEQUAL BRANCH OF 

00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:20.845
GOVERNMENT WHILE SEEKING TO 
REMAIN IN POWER AFTER LOSING AN 

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:25.013
ELECTION. SITTING BACK AND 
WATCHING IT UNFOLD. WE ALL KNOW 

00:50:28.763 --> 00:50:33.471
THE CONSEQUENCES. LIKE EVERY ONE
OF YOU, I WAS IN THE CAPITAL ON 

00:50:34.861 --> 00:50:36.861
JANUARY 6. I WAS ON 

00:50:39.729 --> 00:50:45.096
THE FLOOR. LIKE EVERY ONE OF 
YOU, I WAS EVACUATED AS THIS 

00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:48.844
VIOLENT MOB STORMED THE 

00:50:52.447 --> 00:50:57.481
CAPITALS GATES. WHAT YOU 
EXPERIENCED THAT DAY, WHAT WE 

00:50:57.708 --> 00:51:00.584
EXPERIENCED THAT DAY, WHAT OUR 
COUNTRY EXPERIENCED 

00:51:05.332 --> 00:51:07.332
THAT DAY IS THE FRAMERS WORST 
NIGHTMARE COME 

00:51:10.614 --> 00:51:13.131
TO LIFE. PRESIDENTS CANNOT 
INFLAME INSURRECTION IN THEIR 

00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:20.797
FINAL WEEKS AND THEN WALK AWAY 
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. 

00:51:20.798 --> 00:51:25.310
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE REPORTED ON JONAH'S 
RISE IN POPULARITY 

00:51:28.484 --> 00:51:30.742
AND PROMINENCE, HOW DID THE 
CAUCUS REACTS TO HIS OPENING-DAY

00:51:30.972 --> 00:51:32.972
REMARKS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

00:51:34.783 --> 00:51:36.783
SO JONAH IS PART OF THAT 
HISTORIC DEMOCRATIC CLASS 

00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:42.762
OF 2018 THAT'S WHAT NANCY PELOSI
BACK INTO THE SPEAKER'S CHAIR 

00:51:42.996 --> 00:51:45.318
AND GIVE THE DEMOCRATS THE 
MAJORITY. HE IS NOT, HE DOESN'T 

00:51:45.543 --> 00:51:51.437
HAVE THE PROFILE OF ALEXANDRIA 
OR SOME OF THE MODERATES WHO WON

00:51:51.676 --> 00:51:58.657
THESE RED DISTRICTS, BUT HE IS 
WITHOUT QUESTION THE REAL RISING

00:51:58.888 --> 00:52:02.342
STAR OF THAT CLASS OF 2018. HE 
HAS ONE A LEADERSHIP POSITION 

00:52:03.217 --> 00:52:08.764
AFTER JUST TWO YEARS ON 
BASICALLY UNCHALLENGED. NANCY 

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.992
PELOSI APPOINTED HIM 

00:52:12.566 --> 00:52:15.252
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER AT THE RIPE 
OLD AGE OF 36. HE IS THE 

00:52:15.482 --> 00:52:18.065
YOUNGEST IMPEACHMENT MANAGER 
EVER TO APPEAR BEFORE THE SENATE

00:52:18.293 --> 00:52:22.854
IN AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. HIS 
PRESENTATION ODDLY ENOUGH AS THE

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.859
YOUNGEST ONE AND THE ONE WHO WAS
IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR 

00:52:27.084 --> 00:52:29.084
THE WAY 

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.933
JAMIE IS, HE WAS THE ONE WHO 
REALLY WENT THROUGH AND JUST 

00:52:34.169 --> 00:52:36.016
HAMMERED AWAY AT THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT AND A 

00:52:36.017 --> 00:52:38.017
REALLY THOROUGH 

00:52:39.368 --> 00:52:43.868
WAY AND HE IS JUST A REALLY 
REALLY IMPRESSIVE FIGURE. HE HAS

00:52:44.095 --> 00:52:47.574
A LOT OF UPSIDE IN A 

00:52:52.508 --> 00:52:56.680
SPORTS METAPHOR IN TERMS OF A 
MEMBER WHO COULD GO REALLY FAR 

00:52:56.909 --> 00:52:58.909
IN LEADERSHIP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO BRING RHONDA BACK 

00:52:58.989 --> 00:53:00.989
INTO THE CONVERSATION. LET'S 
TALK ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS OF 

00:53:03.134 --> 00:53:05.134
CONSTITUTIONALITY BECAUSE AS 
PAUL POINTS OUT, THAT WAS REALLY

00:53:05.364 --> 00:53:09.921
A STRONG FOCUS OF CONGRESSMAN --
ARGUMENTS YESTERDAY. WE DIDN'T 

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:14.184
REALLY HEAR A STRONG DISMANTLING
FROM THE DEFENSE TEAM AND WE 

00:53:14.412 --> 00:53:17.380
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE RAMBLING 
ISSUES AND THE LACK OF FOCUS BUT

00:53:17.606 --> 00:53:21.703
THEY DID NOT HAVE THIS SORT OF 
POINT BY POINT DISMANTLING OF 

00:53:21.929 --> 00:53:25.129
THE POINTS WE JUST HEARD FROM 
CONGRESSMAN NEGUS. 

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:30.872
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY REALLY DIDN'T AND IT WAS
A HARD THING FOR THEM TO REBUT 

00:53:31.105 --> 00:53:33.105
COMING AFTER THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
WHO HAD A VERY 

00:53:37.399 --> 00:53:39.399
LINEAR PRESENTATION. THEY 
STARTED WITH THE FRAMERS 

00:53:39.424 --> 00:53:41.424
THINKING IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE PRECEDENT 

00:53:41.497 --> 00:53:43.497
OF A FORMER 

00:53:46.343 --> 00:53:48.782
WAR SECRETARY WHO WENT THROUGH 
AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AFTER HE 

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.010
HAD ALREADY RESIGNED SO THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS LAID 

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.619
IT ALL OUT IN TERMS THAT WERE 
VERY UNDERSTANDABLE AND I THINK 

00:53:53.864 --> 00:53:55.944
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS 
ABOUT YESTERDAY IS WITH BRUCE 

00:53:56.173 --> 00:53:58.173
CASTOR BEING CRITICIZED 

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.290
FOR RAMBLING AND SUCH, HE DID 
POINT OUT HIMSELF THAT THEY 

00:54:03.524 --> 00:54:05.670
CHANGED UP THEIR STRATEGY AFTER 
THEY HEARD THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT

00:54:05.902 --> 00:54:07.902
MANAGERS GO THROUGH THEIR 
PRESENTATION AND IN FACT CASTOR 

00:54:07.962 --> 00:54:10.520
SAID THEY GAVE A GOOD 
PRESENTATION. I THINK IT WAS 

00:54:10.756 --> 00:54:13.568
HARD FOR THEM TO COME AFTER THAT
AND REALLY IT IS INCREDIBLY 

00:54:18.434 --> 00:54:20.522
IMPORTANT BECAUSE HOUSE AND 
SENATE REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS 

00:54:20.749 --> 00:54:23.042
TRUMPS LEGAL TEAM HAVE ALL BEEN 
SAYING THAT THE 

00:54:23.271 --> 00:54:27.809
CONSTITUTIONALITY WOULD BE THERE
CORE ARGUMENT IN THIS ENTIRE 

00:54:28.033 --> 00:54:30.605
IMPEACHMENT, THAT IS WHAT THEY 
WERE GOING TO GO AFTER AND NOW 

00:54:30.831 --> 00:54:33.826
THAT THE SENATE HAS HAD A VOTE 
SAYING THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL, 

00:54:34.055 --> 00:54:36.613
HAD THE JURISDICTION TO GO AHEAD
AND MOVE FORWARD, THAT DOES MAKE

00:54:36.842 --> 00:54:39.136
THE ARGUMENTS FOR TRUMPS SIDE 
HARDER. ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO 

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:42.033
BRING UP IS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
YESTERDAY'S VOTE IN TERMS OF 

00:54:42.264 --> 00:54:44.264
JUST THING ABOUT 

00:54:46.929 --> 00:54:49.013
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. WE HAVE 
HAD THE ONE EXTRA DEFECTION OF 

00:54:49.243 --> 00:54:51.322
BILL CASSIDY JOINING DEMOCRATS 
TO SAY IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL BUT

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:53.550
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY 

00:54:55.661 --> 00:54:58.221
MEAN THAT ALL SENATE REPUBLICANS
WILL VOTE IN THE SAME WAY WHEN 

00:54:58.452 --> 00:55:02.773
IT COMES TO THE CONVICTION OR 
ACQUITTAL VOTE. THOSE ARE TWO 

00:55:02.998 --> 00:55:05.295
SEPARATE VOTES THAT PEOPLE AT 
HOME TO KNOW THAT YESTERDAY MAY 

00:55:05.527 --> 00:55:08.595
HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A 
TEST. IT MAY GIVE US SOME SORT 

00:55:08.831 --> 00:55:10.831
OF EARLY INDICATION OF 
REPUBLICAN THINKING BUT IT IS 

00:55:10.897 --> 00:55:12.897
ALSO SEPARATE FROM THE EVENTUAL 

00:55:15.505 --> 00:55:17.549
VOTE TO QUIT OR ACQUITTAL DONALD
TRUMP. 

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:22.891
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO BRING THAT BACK TO 
PK. PEOPLE INCLUDING THE TOP 

00:55:23.128 --> 00:55:25.236
REPUBLICAN, MITCH McCONNELL, 
HAVE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN NOT JUST

00:55:25.472 --> 00:55:31.212
TO OTHER MEMBERS BUT HE HAS NOT 
CLOSED THE DOOR ON VOTING TO 

00:55:31.446 --> 00:55:34.530
IMPEACH. AS RHONDA POINTS OUT 
THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE VOTES. I 

00:55:34.759 --> 00:55:37.076
WANT TO PUSH YOU ONE MORE TIME 
ON THE POTENTIAL, THE 

00:55:37.302 --> 00:55:39.125
POSSIBILITY FOR REPUBLICANS 
COMING OVER. 

00:55:39.126 --> 00:55:42.108
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT WHAT THE 
MANAGERS WILL 

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.528
NEW, SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
EITHER WITH SOME OF THE 

00:55:52.753 --> 00:55:55.105
PRESENTATION WE ARE GOING TO SEE
TODAY. THEY ARE GOING TO 

00:55:58.428 --> 00:56:00.867
BE USING SOME OF THE ADVISORS 
HAVE BEEN SAYING THEY'RE GOING 

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.386
TO USE SECURITY FOOTAGE THAT WE 
HAVE NOT EVER SEEN BEFORE. MAYBE

00:56:04.617 --> 00:56:07.954
THAT WILL SWAY SOME MINDS. 
OTHERWISE, I THINK WHAT THEY 

00:56:08.182 --> 00:56:13.726
REALLY NEED ARE WITNESSES WHO 
WERE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND THAT 

00:56:13.982 --> 00:56:15.982
WILL BE ABLE TO 

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:21.269
SAY DEFINITIVELY OH HE KNEW THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. HE SAID HE 

00:56:21.504 --> 00:56:25.741
HOPED THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN, 
SOMETHING NEW THAT PUTS YOU IN 

00:56:30.668 --> 00:56:33.812
TRUMPS MINDSET THAT WOULD PUSH 
REPUBLICANS. I THINK THAT IS 

00:56:34.039 --> 00:56:36.893
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO
REALLY SWITCH THE VOTES OF 

00:56:37.134 --> 00:56:39.134
PEOPLE LIKE MITCH McCONNELL AND 

00:56:42.308 --> 00:56:44.512
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND I JUST
DON'T KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS 

00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:46.739
ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE TIME TO 

00:56:50.572 --> 00:56:53.479
DO THAT, TO GET THAT SORT OF 
TESTIMONY, YOU ESSENTIALLY HAVE 

00:56:53.712 --> 00:56:56.240
TO PAUSE THE TRIAL, ISSUE A 
BUNCH OF SUBPOENAS, TRY TO GET 

00:56:56.469 --> 00:57:01.856
BACK SOME TESTIMONY AND COME 
BACK IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OR SO,

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:04.845
AND THAT WOULD REALLY EXTEND THE
TRIAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC 

00:57:05.091 --> 00:57:07.181
LEADERSHIP HAS NOT SIGNALED A 
REAL INTEREST IN DOING SOMETHING

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:11.665
LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO 
GET ON WITH THE NEW 

00:57:15.825 --> 00:57:18.353
ADMINISTRATION'S AGENDA. SO THEY
ARE GOING TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS 

00:57:18.596 --> 00:57:21.375
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT, WRAPPING
UP THE TRIAL BY THE END OF THE 

00:57:21.607 --> 00:57:23.929
WEEKEND, YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING 
AT PRETTY MUCH A SIMILAR REPLAY 

00:57:24.164 --> 00:57:29.499
VOTE MAY BE ONE OR TWO SHIFT BUT
TO GET ALL THE WAY TO 67, YOU 

00:57:29.729 --> 00:57:32.475
ARE GOING TO NEED SOME SORT OF 
PERRY MASON MOMENT THAT CHANGES 

00:57:32.707 --> 00:57:36.244
THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE 11 
SENATORS TO BREAK FROM HOW THEY 

00:57:36.607 --> 00:57:41.992
HAVE ALREADY VOTED. IT IS JUST 
REALLY HARD FOR A SENATOR TO GO 

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.848
AHEAD AND VOTE FOR SOMETHING OR 
AGAINST SOMETHING AND TURNAROUND

00:57:46.083 --> 00:57:48.083
FIVE DAYS LATER AND VOTE FOR IT.
YOU NEED 

00:57:52.522 --> 00:57:57.404
A BIG SEACHANGE, SOMETHING THAT 
WOULD PERSUADE THEIR MINDS. 

00:57:57.405 --> 00:57:59.405
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT 
WITNESSES CLOSE TO 

00:58:03.493 --> 00:58:08.213
DONALD TRUMP PAUL COULD ALSO 
TESTIFY TO WHAT HE DID THAT DAY 

00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:11.205
AND WHAT HIS STATE OF MIND WAS 
THAT DAY AFTER THE ATTACK HAD 

00:58:11.435 --> 00:58:13.715
ALREADY STARTED BECAUSE THERE 
WAS THAT HUGE DELAY. THERE WAS A

00:58:13.963 --> 00:58:16.254
DELAY IN HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REACTED AND HAVING HIM CALL FOR 

00:58:16.485 --> 00:58:19.526
PEOPLE TO STAND DOWN. ALSO 
CONFUSION AND DELAY IN GETTING 

00:58:19.755 --> 00:58:21.755
NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS DEPLOYED 
OR ANY SORT OF NATIONAL 

00:58:23.461 --> 00:58:26.509
MOBILIZED REACTION SO THAT IS 
ALSO A CRUCIAL PIECE OF 

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.592
INFORMATION. WE JUST DON'T HAVE 
THE INSIGHT ON PAPER. WE TALKED 

00:58:29.824 --> 00:58:34.867
TO PEOPLE WITH BACKGROUND OF THE
WASHINGTON POST AND OTHER NEWS 

00:58:38.693 --> 00:58:41.411
OUTLETS BUT NOT PUTTING A NAME 
AND FACE AND STANDING UP AND 

00:58:41.642 --> 00:58:44.281
RAISING THEIR HANDS AND 
TESTIFYING TO WHAT THEY SAW. ONE

00:58:44.518 --> 00:58:47.082
LAST THING I WANT TO TALK TO 
ABOUT, THE VIDEO YESTERDAY, THE 

00:58:47.313 --> 00:58:49.540
13 MINUTE VIDEO THAT IMPEACHMENT
MANAGERS PLAYED WAS REALLY HARD 

00:58:53.871 --> 00:58:55.871
TO WATCH.

00:58:57.591 --> 00:59:00.510
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU AND THE 
CAPITOL HILL PRESS CORPS ARE 

00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:03.521
DOING IN THIS MOMENT OF HAVING 
TO COVER THIS STORY THAT HAS SO 

00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:04.899
PERSONALLY IMPACTED EVERYONE AS 
WELL? 

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:09.228
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I LIVE DID THAT DAY. I WAS 
THERE. WATCHING 

00:59:13.639 --> 00:59:15.639
THAT PRESENTATION, IT IS 
SOMEWHAT JARRING. IT BRINGS YOU 

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.708
BACK TO THAT DAY, THAT MOMENT. I
KNOW 

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:26.267
SOMEBODY WHO, THERE WAS A SPLIT 
SECOND IN THAT VIDEO WHERE THEY 

00:59:26.534 --> 00:59:28.872
WERE WALKING CALLS AND BANGING 
ON DOORS AND SHE FIGURED OUT 

00:59:29.102 --> 00:59:32.725
THAT THAT WAS THE DOOR THAT A 
GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE HIDING 

00:59:32.959 --> 00:59:34.959
BEHIND. IT IS A 

00:59:38.551 --> 00:59:41.220
JARRING THING, WATCHING ALL OF 
THIS UNFOLD AND IT WILL BE 

00:59:45.126 --> 00:59:48.229
AGAIN TODAY. THERE IS A CONCERN 
ON ONE AND FOR ME THAT THIS 

00:59:53.161 --> 00:59:59.217
WHOLE TRIAL GOES THROUGH AND IN 
FOUR OR FIVE DAYS THE WAY THEY 

00:59:59.443 --> 01:00:01.972
ARE RACING THROUGH IT, THE ONLY 
IMPACT MIGHT BE TO INFLICT MORE 

01:00:02.202 --> 01:00:04.408
TRAUMA ON THOSE WHO WERE THERE. 
ESPECIALLY THE CAPITAL POLICE 

01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:06.777
AND GIVEN WHAT THEY ARE 
PREVIEWING TO REPORTERS, I THINK

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.969
A LOT OF TODAY'S FOOTAGE IS 
GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD ON 

01:00:13.556 --> 01:00:16.839
CAPITAL POLICE WHO WERE AND 
LITERALLY HAND TO HAND COMBAT 

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:24.625
WITH AN INVADING FORCE ON 
JANUARY 6. SO I HOPE AND PRAY 

01:00:24.857 --> 01:00:29.486
THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE HELP 
THAT THEY NEED BOTH PHYSICALLY 

01:00:29.714 --> 01:00:31.714
AND EMOTIONALLY TO RECOVER FROM 

01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:39.729
IT ALL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING

01:00:39.979 --> 01:00:42.549
WITH US. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
LET'S GO TO JAMES. THERE IS A 

01:00:42.778 --> 01:00:45.093
QUESTION OF HOW VISCERAL THIS 
COULD BE MADE FOR THE AMERICAN 

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.157
PUBLIC BECAUSE WHILE THE 
SENATORS ARE THE JURY HERE, THIS

01:00:48.388 --> 01:00:50.672
IS ALSO ON TRIAL IN AMERICA'S 
HOMES, ON THEIR PHONES AND 

01:00:50.903 --> 01:00:53.188
LAPTOPS AND TELEVISIONS AS THEY 
PIECE TOGETHER THE TIMELINE AND 

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:56.390
WHAT HAPPENED. SO 

01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:02.998
I WONDER HOW MUCH THAT IS ON THE
MIND OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

01:01:03.229 --> 01:01:06.016
AND HOW THEY HAVE TO, MAKE IT 
THIS TO A BROADER AUDIENCE AS 

01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:07.865
WELL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY AND WHEN YOU TALK 

01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:09.866
TO THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 
THEY ARE PRIMARILY PLAYING AN 

01:01:09.939 --> 01:01:12.625
OUTSIDE GAME. THEY WOULD LOVE TO
HAVE A MOMENT, A PERRY MASON 

01:01:12.859 --> 01:01:18.583
MOMENT THAT PERSUADES REPUBLICAN
SENATORS TO ALL OF A SUDDEN 

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.830
SHAKE 

01:01:23.778 --> 01:01:26.899
THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO DONALD TRUMP
BUT THEY ARE REALISTIC AND 

01:01:27.128 --> 01:01:30.243
PRAGMATIC. THEY DO THINK THAT A 
PERRY MASON MOMENT AS PAUL PUT 

01:01:30.472 --> 01:01:33.028
IT WOULD HELP WITH THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE THAT IT REALLY COULD MOVE

01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:36.199
PUBLIC OPINION AND THAT 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WOULD BE 

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:38.524
RESPONSIVE TO THAT SHIFT IN 
PUBLIC OPINION. YOUR POINT IS A 

01:01:38.757 --> 01:01:42.932
GOOD ONE THAT WE DON'T HAVE 
WITNESSES BUT WE DO HAVE 

01:01:43.164 --> 01:01:45.631
REPORTING. WE HAVE TALKED TO 
PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE THAT 

01:01:45.858 --> 01:01:50.717
THEY WERE HORRIFIED BY TRUMP 
REFUSING TO WEIGH IN FOUR HOURS 

01:01:50.946 --> 01:01:53.149
AS THE MOB SACKED THE CAPITAL 
AND 

01:01:56.748 --> 01:02:00.198
IN FACT, SEVERAL OF THE 
SENATORS, THE REPUBLICAN 

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:02.791
SENATORS COULD BE WITNESSES. 
THIS IS NOT ONLY THE SCENE OF 

01:02:03.028 --> 01:02:05.585
THE CRIME BUT THEY WERE PEOPLE 
WHO WERE CALLING TRUMP THAT DAY 

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:11.567
TRYING TO GET HIM TO SEND HELP 
AND TRUMP WASN'T TAKING THEIR 

01:02:11.807 --> 01:02:14.135
CALLS. INSTEAD WE KNOW FROM 
REPORTING, HE WAS AT THE WHITE 

01:02:14.379 --> 01:02:17.398
HOUSE ENJOYING THE SHOW ON CABLE
NEWS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS 

01:02:20.098 --> 01:02:21.941
NOT DEPLOYING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WAS ALSO THE INCIDENT 

01:02:21.942 --> 01:02:25.056
WITH THE PRESIDENT CALLED MIKE 
LEE TRYING TO REACH THE NEW 

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:29.966
SENATOR FROM ALABAMA. IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THIS CHAOS AND NOT TO 

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.214
COME THINGS BUT TO 

01:02:35.677 --> 01:02:37.054
TALK ABOUT RETURNING THE 
ELECTION. 

01:02:37.055 --> 01:02:39.510
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND TRY TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
COMING BACK THAT NIGHT. 

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.804
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS SUCH AN 
IMPORTANT THING FOR THE COUNTRY 

01:02:42.035 --> 01:02:44.356
FOR THE PROCEEDINGS TO CONTINUE 
THAT NIGHT FOR THE ELECTION TO 

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.009
BE CERTIFIED, THAT IS A DATE 
JANUARY 6 THAT IS SET IN STONE 

01:02:49.245 --> 01:02:51.245
IN THE CONSTITUTION. TRUMP 
LITERALLY WAS CALLING TO REACH 

01:02:51.411 --> 01:02:57.713
TOMMY TO TELL HIM, TRY TO BLOCK 
THIS FROM HAPPENING TONIGHT. 

01:02:57.939 --> 01:03:00.653
LET'S POSTPONE IT AND MAYBE WE 
CAN HAVE MORE PRESSURE COME BACK

01:03:00.881 --> 01:03:05.723
AND ON THE SAME VEIN AS THAT, 
ELAINE WHO WAS THE 

01:03:07.226 --> 01:03:09.226
TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY, THE 
WIFE OF MITCH McCONNELL RESIGNED

01:03:11.692 --> 01:03:15.557
IN PROTEST AFTER THIS INCIDENT 
ON JANUARY 6 BECAUSE SHE WAS SO 

01:03:15.788 --> 01:03:19.892
DISTRAUGHT BY TRUMP'S HANDLING 
OF IT AND TRUMPS INTENTIONAL 

01:03:23.475 --> 01:03:25.794
DELAY TACTICS. SO IT HAS BEEN 
INTERESTING OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:28.810
OF WEEKS BECAUSE INITIALLY YOU 
DID SEE SEVERAL SENATORS BLAME 

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.557
TRUMP FOR WHAT HAPPENED 
INCLUDING LINDSEY GRAHAM AND 

01:03:33.025 --> 01:03:36.773
MITCH McCONNELL. ON THE HOUSE 
SIDE, YOU HEARD McCARTHY SAY 

01:03:37.004 --> 01:03:39.004
TRUMP 

01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:42.608
DESERVES BLAME AND TRIBALISM IS 
REALLY THE BEST THING GOING FOR 

01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:46.979
DONALD TRUMP WHICH IS THE TRIBAL
INSTINCTS KICKED IN AND YOU HAVE

01:03:47.221 --> 01:03:52.889
SEEN SEVERAL SENATORS THAT WERE 
PRETTY HARD ON TRUMP A MONTH AGO

01:03:53.124 --> 01:03:55.773
HAVE WALKED BACK THEIR COMMENTS.
KEVIN McCARTHY WAS ASKED ABOUT 

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.334
SAYING TRUMP DESERVES BLAME AND 
HE SAID WILL EVERYONE IN AMERICA

01:03:58.564 --> 01:04:02.380
DESERVES BLAME WHICH IS AN 
ILLUSTRATION OF SORT OF THESE 

01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:05.816
POLITICIANS WITH THEIR FINGERS 
IN THE WIND REACTING TO WHERE 

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.050
THE BASE OF THEIR 

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:12.806
PARTY REMAINS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL STAY WITH YOU. MUCH 

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.955
OF THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS 
UNPRECEDENTED. WE CAN STILL 

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:18.731
LEARN RATHER FROM HISTORY. LET'S
GO TO MY COLLEAGUE AND 

01:04:22.183 --> 01:04:23.975
PRESIDENTIAL EXPERT LILLIAN 
CUNNINGHAM FOR A LITTLE 

01:04:23.976 --> 01:04:25.976
PERSPECTIVE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM THE CREATOR AND HOST OF 

01:04:26.073 --> 01:04:29.547
THE PRESIDENTIAL PODCAST. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS THE POINT OF HOLDING 

01:04:29.773 --> 01:04:33.207
AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL FOR SOMEONE
WHO IS ALREADY LEFT OFFICE? THE 

01:04:33.443 --> 01:04:35.443
CONSTITUTION STATES 

01:04:37.213 --> 01:04:41.716
THAT IMPEACHMENT CAN LEAD EITHER
TO SOMEONE'S REMOVAL FROM OFFICE

01:04:41.956 --> 01:04:45.174
WHICH OF COURSE IS NO LONGER 
RELEVANT IN THIS CASE OR IT CAN 

01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:48.521
LEAD TO SOMEONE'S 
DISQUALIFICATION FROM EVER 

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:53.105
HOLDING OFFICE AGAIN. NOW 
ULTIMATELY THE SENATE HAS THE 

01:04:53.343 --> 01:04:56.974
POWER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WOULD
PURSUE SUCH A PUNISHMENT, BUT 

01:04:57.202 --> 01:05:00.764
THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. THERE 
HAVE BEEN THREE TIMES IN 

01:05:01.785 --> 01:05:03.785
AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE THE 
SENATE HAS DECIDED THROUGH AN 

01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:09.125
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TO BAN SOMEONE
FROM EVER HOLDING OFFICE AGAIN. 

01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:13.366
NOTABLY THOUGH, ALL THREE OF 
THOSE CASES INVOLVED FEDERAL 

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:16.211
JUDGES. THEY HAVE NEVER MADE 
SUCH A DECISION BEFORE INVOLVING

01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:18.441
A 

01:05:21.211 --> 01:05:23.211
FORMER PRESIDENT.

01:05:29.213 --> 01:05:31.541
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SEE TO 
BELIEVE. SOMETIMES WAITING ISN'T

01:05:31.779 --> 01:05:34.134
AN OPTION. WHEN THE NEWS IS 
BREAKING, WATCH AT THE NEWSROOM 

01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:36.362

SUBSCRIBING TO THAT LINK LETS 
EVERYONE HEAR FROM THE FRONT 

01:05:51.428 --> 01:05:53.754
LINES TO THE CONTROL ROOM NO 
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT OUR 

01:05:53.985 --> 01:05:56.358
CONTINUED EFFORTS TO INFORM THE 
PUBLIC, PROTECT THE FIRST 

01:05:56.592 --> 01:05:58.902
AMENDMENT AND FOSTER A HEALTHY 
DEMOCRACY. WE COULD NOT DO THIS 

01:06:03.676 --> 01:06:05.676
WITHOUT YOU.

01:06:10.047 --> 01:06:12.596
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 25 MINUTES UNTIL DAY TWO OF 
THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF FORMER 

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:15.726
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP RESUMES. 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LIVE SHOT 

01:06:15.956 --> 01:06:20.495
OF CAPITOL HILL. THE SITE OF 
WHAT IS UNFOLDING TODAY BUT ALSO

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:23.584
OF COURSE THE SITE OF THAT 
ATTACK ON JANUARY 6 THAT IS AT 

01:06:23.817 --> 01:06:27.809
THE HEART OF TODAY'S ARGUMENTS. 
LET'S GO TO RHONDA WHO IS IN THE

01:06:29.949 --> 01:06:32.078
CAPITAL COMPLEX. WE WERE JUST 
HEARING FROM LILLIAN IF YOU 

01:06:32.305 --> 01:06:36.285
MOMENTS AGO ABOUT THE HISTORY OF
THIS AND THE IDEA OF PREVENTING 

01:06:36.518 --> 01:06:40.974
SOMEONE FROM RUNNING FOR OFFICE,
HOLDING MAJOR OFFICE AGAIN. HOW 

01:06:41.202 --> 01:06:44.422
DOES THAT FACTOR INTO THE 
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF 

01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:48.203
REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW, SOME OF 
WHOM FRANKLY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE 

01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:52.562
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE REARVIEW 
MIRROR? 

01:06:52.563 --> 01:06:54.563
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS AN IMPORTANT AN OPEN 

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.410
QUESTION STILL BECAUSE WITH THIS
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, OF COURSE 

01:07:01.647 --> 01:07:03.647
THEY WILL ULTIMATELY VOTE 
WHETHER TO ACQUIT OR CONVICTED 

01:07:03.745 --> 01:07:06.329
DONALD TRUMP BUT THEY WOULD HAVE
TO TAKE ANOTHER VOTE AFTER THAT 

01:07:06.594 --> 01:07:08.996
TO DETERMINE IF THEY WANT TO 
REMOVE HIM FROM EVER POSSIBLY 

01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:13.793
BEING ABLE TO HOLD ELECTED 
OFFICE AGAIN. THAT IS A PART OF 

01:07:14.021 --> 01:07:16.021
THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
INTERPRETATION OF 

01:07:18.298 --> 01:07:20.768
AN IMPEACHMENT. IT IS NOT SO 
MUCH ABOUT REMOVING SOMEONE, IT 

01:07:21.009 --> 01:07:23.315
IS ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT 
THEY DON'T RETURN TO ELECTED 

01:07:23.546 --> 01:07:25.850
OFFICE AND THAT IS ANOTHER PART 
OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARGUMENT 

01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:28.081
HERE 

01:07:30.209 --> 01:07:34.209
IS THAT EVEN THOUGH HE IS GONE 
NOW, HE HAS MADE PROMISES THAT 

01:07:34.442 --> 01:07:36.998
HE WILL RETURN IN SOME FASHION. 
HE SAID THAT HIMSELF AND HIS 

01:07:37.228 --> 01:07:39.548
LAST COMMENTS THE DAY OF THE 
INAUGURATION BEFORE HE FLEW OFF 

01:07:39.779 --> 01:07:42.222
TOMORROW LAGO THAT HE WOULD 
RETURN IN SOME FASHION. THAT IS 

01:07:42.451 --> 01:07:44.523
A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY AND I 
THINK REPUBLICANS ARE STILL 

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:48.919
THINKING THROUGH HOW THEY FEEL 
ABOUT THAT IF THEY DO END UP 

01:07:49.147 --> 01:07:52.817
HAVING TO TAKE SOME SORT OF VOTE
ON IF HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN 

01:07:53.043 --> 01:07:55.135
AGAIN OR IF THERE IS A 
RESOLUTION DRAFTED TO DETERMINE 

01:07:55.364 --> 01:07:58.688
IF HE IS FIT FOR HOLDING OFFICE 
EVER AGAIN. I THINK THEY ARE ALL

01:07:58.922 --> 01:08:00.922
STILL VERY VERY 

01:08:03.383 --> 01:08:06.122
MUCH CALCULATING WHAT IS HIS 
ROLE RIGHT NOW IN THE PARTY? DO 

01:08:06.353 --> 01:08:08.926
YOU STAY LOYAL TO HIM OR DO YOU 
COMPLETELY DIVORCE YOURSELF FROM

01:08:13.054 --> 01:08:16.295
TRUMP AND TRUMP IS A? A LOT OF 
THEM ARE STILL MAKING THAT 

01:08:16.522 --> 01:08:19.372
DECISION THEMSELVES THAT IS WHY 
WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF 

01:08:19.602 --> 01:08:21.700
FLIP-FLOPPING FROM SOME OF THE 
REPUBLICANS WHO CAME OUT HOURS 

01:08:21.933 --> 01:08:25.528
OR DAYS AFTER JANUARY 6 AND SAID
HE HAD A ROLE IN IT AND WHEN IT 

01:08:25.755 --> 01:08:28.293
CAME TIME TO VOTE IN THE HOUSE, 
YOU HAD SOMEONE LIKE KEVIN 

01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:30.521
McCARTHY SAID HE BEARS 
RESPONSIBILITY BUT HE WOULD NOT 

01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:32.953
VOTE FOR HIS IMPEACHMENTS. IT IS
A LOT OF POLITICAL CALCULATION 

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.001
GOING ON WITH REPUBLICANS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JOINING ME NOW IS SARAH, A 

01:08:37.234 --> 01:08:39.234
VIDEO REPORTER ON OUR WASHINGTON
POST VISUAL 

01:08:42.584 --> 01:08:44.808

AWARD FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE 
PIONEERING VISUAL JOURNALISM. 

01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:48.943
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND THE

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT IS AN 
HONOR TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW. 

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:57.415
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. YOU AND THE TEAM 
PUT TOGETHER THIS VERY POINT BY 

01:08:57.650 --> 01:09:00.835
POINT RECONSTRUCTION OF WHAT 
HAPPENED ON THE EVENTS ON 

01:09:02.497 --> 01:09:04.497
JANUARY 6. IT IS SO 

01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:09.473
INFORMATIVE BECAUSE IT ZOOMS IN 
AND SHOWS US WHAT WAS HAPPENING 

01:09:09.706 --> 01:09:12.105
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE 
CAPITAL AT ANY CERTAIN TIME. I 

01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:18.545
JUST WANT TO PLAY A CLIP OF THAT
AND THIS IS PART OF THAT 

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.998
RECONSTRUCTION WHEN THE MOB IS 
ENTERING THE CAPITAL. LET'S 

01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:23.619
WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; POLICE ANNOUNCED THE ATTACK 

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:25.977
ON THEIR RADIO CHANNELS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CAPITAL HAS 

01:09:30.864 --> 01:09:32.864
BEEN BREACHED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER DENNY 

01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:35.066
IS ESCORTED OUT OF THE CHAMBER 
AND THE HOUSE GOES 

01:09:38.246 --> 01:09:40.246
INTO RECESS. HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY
PELOSI HAS ALREADY 

01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:47.609
BEEN EVACUATED. AT 2:19, CAPITAL

MOB SWELLS. VIOLENT WRITERS 
CRUSH 

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.583
THE POLICE. AT THE SAME TIME ON

KEEP AN ENTRANCE TO THE ROTUNDA

01:10:14.119 --> 01:10:18.680
THE MOB. WRITERS STREAMED 
THROUGH THE NOW OPEN MAIN DOORS 

01:10:18.913 --> 01:10:20.913

01:10:24.348 --> 01:10:28.249

HOUSE CHAMBER WHEREAS OF TO: 26,
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE

RESUMED SESSION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW CLOSE TO THESE WRITERS 

01:10:38.315 --> 01:10:42.076
GET TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY CAME VERY CLOSE. THERE 

01:10:44.665 --> 01:10:47.232
ARE INSTANCES WHERE THERE WERE 
RIDERS ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR 

01:10:47.461 --> 01:10:51.316
AND LAWMAKERS ON THE OTHER. WE 
SYNCHRONIZED NGO LOCATED 

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.338
THE FOOTAGE AND WE WERE ABLE TO 
MAP MOVEMENTS OF THE WRITERS TO 

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:00.938
ASSESS HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO 
LAWMAKERS. FOR INSTANCE IN A 

01:11:01.168 --> 01:11:04.530
VIDEO THAT HAS BEEN WIDELY 
SHARED, WE SEE THE RIDERS ENTER 

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.224
UNDERNEATH THE SENATE CHAMBER 
AND PURSUE A LOAN CAPITAL POLICE

01:11:09.452 --> 01:11:11.452
OFFICER, EUGENE GOODMAN UP THE 
STAIRCASE TO THE 

01:11:14.732 --> 01:11:17.283
SECOND FLOOR. AT ONE POINT THEY 
PASS WITHIN 100 FEET OF FORMER 

01:11:17.516 --> 01:11:21.728
VICE PRESIDENT PENTZ AND HIS 
FAMILY. ANOTHER INSTANCE OF HOW 

01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:25.230
CLOSE THE RIDERS CAME TO THE 
LAWMAKERS WAS ONE THEY ENTERED 

01:11:25.463 --> 01:11:30.080
NANCY PELOSI'S SUITES. THERE WAS
STAFFERS HANGING UNDERNEATH THE 

01:11:30.312 --> 01:11:34.645
TABLE AND A CONFERENCE ROOM. WE 
OBTAINED AUDIO WHERE YOU CAN 

01:11:34.883 --> 01:11:37.216
HEAR THE STAFFERS HIDING UNDER 
THE TABLE AND THE RIDERS OUTSIDE

01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:39.449
THE DOORS BANGING 

01:11:41.745 --> 01:11:43.981
AND YELLING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO PLAY IS SECOND CLIP

01:11:44.215 --> 01:11:46.215
FROM THE AFTERNOON OF 

01:11:48.849 --> 01:11:50.932
JANUARY 6 AND THIS WAS FROM 
OUTSIDE THE SPEAKERS GALLERY 

01:11:51.163 --> 01:11:53.846
WHICH IS OFF THE HOUSE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS LAST LAWMAKERS LEAVE THAT 

01:11:54.072 --> 01:11:56.072
TO: -- 2:42 PM, THE NUMBER OF 

01:12:00.164 --> 01:12:04.606
RIDERS GROWS. SOME 
REPRESENTATIVES REMAIN IN THE 

01:12:07.333 --> 01:12:11.733
HOUSE GALLERY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT. THIS IS JUST 

01:12:11.962 --> 01:12:13.962
MOMENTS BEFORE ASHLEY BABBITT 

01:12:16.279 --> 01:12:18.767
WAS SHOT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS HAPPENING IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:21.533
LOCATION AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CAPITAL AT

01:12:21.772 --> 01:12:23.681
THAT TIME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO MUCH WAS HAPPENING WITHIN 

01:12:23.682 --> 01:12:26.230
THESE FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE 
SHOOTING 

01:12:30.696 --> 01:12:33.174
AT 2:44. AT 2:41 PM, LAWMAKERS 
ARE BEING EVACUATED FROM THE 

01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:36.353
HOUSE FLOOR THROUGH THE SPEAKERS
LOBBY. WRITERS ARE ENTERING THAT

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:42.066
AREA AND THAT PUTS THEM WITHIN 
APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET OF EACH 

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.171
OTHER. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
BUILDING IN THE SENATE CHAMBER, 

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.365
THE RIDERS HAVE REACHED 

01:12:52.431 --> 01:12:55.281
THE CHAMBER. BACK IN THE HOUSE, 
THE GALLERY IS STILL FULL OF 

01:12:55.514 --> 01:12:59.240
LAWMAKERS. THEY ARE CROUCHED ON 
THE FLOOR HIDING UNDERNEATH 

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:03.499
THEIR SEATS UNABLE TO LEAVE 
BECAUSE THE CAPITAL POLICE HAVE 

01:13:03.727 --> 01:13:08.123
BARRICADED THE DOORS SO THAT THE
RIDERS CANNOT GET INSIDE. 

01:13:08.356 --> 01:13:13.602
OUTSIDE THE SPEAKERS LOBBY, WE 
SEE THE RIDERS GETTING MORE AND 

01:13:15.587 --> 01:13:17.587
MORE AGITATED. A LINE OF 

01:13:21.411 --> 01:13:23.820
POLICE OFFICERS LEAVE AS A 
TACTICAL UNIT ARRIVES. BEFORE 

01:13:24.049 --> 01:13:26.618
THEY DO, THE RIDERS START TO 
SMASH THE DOORS AND WINDOWS WITH

01:13:26.847 --> 01:13:31.246
HELMETS AND FLAGPOLES AS BABBITT
ATTEMPTS TO CLIMB THROUGH ONE OF

01:13:31.488 --> 01:13:35.359
THOSE SMASHED WINDOWS AND AND 
OFFICER FILES -- BUYERS A 

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.082
SINGLE SHOT. INSIDE THE GALLERY,
WE CAN SEE THE LAWMAKERS HEAR 

01:13:41.313 --> 01:13:43.862
THE GUNSHOT AND REACT TO IT BY 
TAKING OFF THEIR LAPEL PINS 

01:13:44.095 --> 01:13:46.095
AFRAID THAT THEY COULD BE 

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.290
EASILY IDENTIFIED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH AND 

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:53.959
I WILL TWEET OUT A LINK TO THIS 
RECONSTRUCTION THAT YOUR 

01:13:58.442 --> 01:14:01.378
TEAM DID. IT IS SO COMPELLING 
AND AS YOU POINT OUT YOU WERE 

01:14:01.622 --> 01:14:03.949
ABLE TO PINPOINT WHERE THINGS 
ARE IN THAT CAPITAL COMPLEX. I 

01:14:04.181 --> 01:14:06.759
KNOW YOU WILL BE WATCHING TODAY 
AS WE SEE WHAT THE IMPEACHMENT 

01:14:06.996 --> 01:14:10.017
MANAGERS PUT FORTH THEMSELVES 
THAT DAY. APPRECIATE IT. LET'S 

01:14:10.247 --> 01:14:12.247
GO 

01:14:13.275 --> 01:14:15.275
TO JAMES FOR MORE ON THE 
TIMELINE 

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:20.622
OF EVENTS AND WHY IT IS SO 
IMPORTANT FOR JOURNALISTS AS 

01:14:20.849 --> 01:14:24.440
WELL AS HISTORIANS FRANKLY JAMES
AS WELL AS THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT

01:14:24.671 --> 01:14:26.750
MANAGERS TO SHOW WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING WHEN AND JUST HOW 

01:14:26.975 --> 01:14:30.697
CLOSE THINGS WERE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY

01:14:30.932 --> 01:14:34.034
IMPORTANT FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE
GROUPS AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO 

01:14:34.264 --> 01:14:37.301
HAVE A PERRY MASON MOMENT, I 
THINK IT IS A GOOD WAY TO 

01:14:37.529 --> 01:14:39.529
CAPTURE HOW VISCERAL THIS WAS. 
THE FEAR THAT 

01:14:42.723 --> 01:14:45.658
PEOPLE FELT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THAT ROOM KNOW EXACTLY HOW SCARY

01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:48.698
IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE 
AND LIVED THROUGH IT BUT FOR A 

01:14:48.926 --> 01:14:51.265
LOT OF AMERICANS, ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, 

01:14:51.492 --> 01:14:53.492
IT ONLY GETS WORSE WITH TIME. 
THE MORE 

01:14:56.683 --> 01:15:01.817
WE LEARN THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF 
OUR VISUAL FORENSICS COLLEAGUES 

01:15:02.058 --> 01:15:05.231
HAS SHOWN US THAT IT WAS SO MUCH
SCARIER, THERE WERE SO MANY MORE

01:15:05.492 --> 01:15:07.586
CLOSE CALLS THAT WE REALIZED 
THAT THEY. THIS WASN'T SOME 

01:15:07.818 --> 01:15:10.144
SMALL RAGTAG GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO
CAME THROUGH ONE ENTRANCE AND 

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:12.370
WERE WANDERING AROUND AIMLESSLY.
THIS 

01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:17.065
WAS COORDINATED. IT WAS REALLY 
STARK IN TERMS OF HOW MANY 

01:15:17.292 --> 01:15:20.954
ENTRANCES THEY BREACHED. I THINK
IT IS IMPORTANT CERTAINLY TO 

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.192
KNOW THE MOMENT BY MOMENT IN THE
CAPITAL AND WE WILL SEE SOME OF 

01:15:25.389 --> 01:15:27.857
THAT TODAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
LOOK AT THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP 

01:15:28.084 --> 01:15:30.084
BETWEEN TRUMPS WORDS 

01:15:33.038 --> 01:15:35.954
AND ACTIONS. THIS IS NOT A LEGAL
TRIAL. THERE IS A DIFFERENT 

01:15:36.185 --> 01:15:38.185
LEGAL STANDARD FOR INCITEMENT 
AND THERE IS AN IMPEACHABLE 

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:41.223
STANDARD THAT THE IMPEACHABLE 
STANDARD IS HIGH CRIMES AND 

01:15:41.465 --> 01:15:43.781
MISDEMEANORS. THERE IS A LEGAL 
STANDARD BASED ON A 1969 SUPREME

01:15:44.887 --> 01:15:48.574
COURT CASE THAT MAKES IT HARD TO
PROSECUTE SOMEONE FOR INCITEMENT

01:15:48.808 --> 01:15:51.353
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE

01:15:51.587 --> 01:15:53.587
GROUPS TO UNDERSTAND, THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE HISTORIANS 

01:15:53.609 --> 01:15:58.488
AND POLITICIANS IS THE PATTERN 
OF CONDUCT DURING THOSE 77 DAYS 

01:15:58.726 --> 01:16:00.726
BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND 

01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:05.756
THE INAUGURATION. IT WAS NOT 
JUST THE SPEECH AT THE SO CALLED

01:16:05.985 --> 01:16:09.871
STOP THE STEEL RALLY RIGHT 
BEFORE THE MOB SACKED THE 

01:16:10.106 --> 01:16:14.773
CAPITAL. IT WAS TRUMPS TWEETS 
SAYING COME TO DC, IT IS GOING 

01:16:15.014 --> 01:16:19.517
TO BE WILD IN THE WEEKS RUNNING 
UP AHEAD OF TIME. EVEN THE 

01:16:19.748 --> 01:16:23.384
COMMENT TO THE PROUD BOYS TO 
STAND BACK AND STANDBY. ALSO HIS

01:16:23.616 --> 01:16:26.947
COMMENTS AFTERWARDS, NOT JUST 
HIS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WHICH WE 

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:31.606
TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE MINUTES 
AGO BUT ALSO HIS TWEET THAT 

01:16:31.847 --> 01:16:33.935
EVENING WHICH WE HEARD MENTIONED
THREE DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE

01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:36.071
OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS YESTERDAY 

01:16:36.072 --> 01:16:39.584
WHICH WAS THIS IS A DAY THAT 
WILL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER. THIS

01:16:39.814 --> 01:16:41.814
WAS A HISTORY AND PEOPLE LIKE 
YVONNE, TRUMP 

01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:47.685
AND OTHERS CALLING TO MEMBERS OF
THE MOB, THE INSURRECTIONIST, 

01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:51.372
CALLING THEM PATRIOTS EVEN AFTER
THEY HAD SACKED THE CAPITAL. SO 

01:16:51.602 --> 01:16:55.904
ALL OF THAT CREATES THIS 
PICTURE, THIS BODY OF EVIDENCE 

01:16:56.131 --> 01:17:00.823
THAT IT IS MORE THAN JUST ONE 
SPEECH. IT IS EVERYTHING THAT 

01:17:01.053 --> 01:17:04.707
WAS LEADING UP TO IT. EVEN 
TRUMPS SPEECH THE NIGHT OF THE 

01:17:04.952 --> 01:17:07.620
ELECTION WHERE HE CLAIMED 
VICTORY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CLEAR

01:17:07.996 --> 01:17:10.782
THE ELECTION WAS MOVING AWAY 
FROM HIM AND WE HAVE OUR OWN 

01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:13.351
REPORTING AT THE WASHINGTON POST
THE TRUMP KNEW THERE WAS GOING 

01:17:13.586 --> 01:17:15.586
TO BE THIS 

01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:21.149
RED MIRAGE WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE 
HE WAS LEAVING BECAUSE MILLAN 

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.488
BALLOTS HAD BEEN COUNTED BEFORE 
ELECTION DAY BECAUSE OF STATE 

01:17:23.725 --> 01:17:26.038
LAWS IN VARIOUS PLACES AND TRUMP
MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION BEFORE

01:17:26.273 --> 01:17:28.968
THE ELECTION THAT HE WOULD CLAIM
VICTORY EVEN IF IT LOOKED LIKE 

01:17:29.203 --> 01:17:31.781
HE WAS GOING TO BE DEFEATED SO 
HE COULD CALL THE ELECTION 

01:17:32.019 --> 01:17:34.326
ILLEGITIMATE. ALL OF THAT POINTS
TO MOTIVE, POINTS TO THIS 

01:17:34.569 --> 01:17:36.569
PATTERN 

01:17:38.838 --> 01:17:41.536
OF CONDUCT THAT IS PART OF WHAT 
ULTIMATELY LEADS TO THIS CHARGE 

01:17:41.765 --> 01:17:44.335
OF INCITEMENT. IT IS VALUABLE TO
CONSIDER ALL OF THAT AND I 

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.871
EXPECT WE WILL SEE INCREDIBLY 
COMPELLING FOOTAGE TODAY BUT WE 

01:17:49.108 --> 01:17:55.289
ARE ALSO GOING TO BE REMINDED OF
ALL THOSE THINGS DRIP BY DRIP BY

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.537
DRIP TO THIS FLOOD OF 

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:02.365
JANUARY 6. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WE DO SEE THAT 

01:18:02.366 --> 01:18:05.567
HISTORY THAT JAMES IS TALKING 
ABOUT, ALL THE EVENTS LEADING UP

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.806
TO JANUARY 6 ARE 

01:18:10.934 --> 01:18:13.146
AN IMPORTANT PART OF MAKING 
THEIR CASE AND BUILDING THEIR 

01:18:13.376 --> 01:18:15.921
ARGUMENT SO HOW ESSENTIAL WILL 
THAT BE TO THESE NEXT COUPLE OF 

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:18.149
DAYS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WILL BE 

01:18:21.231 --> 01:18:23.939
PRETTY ESSENTIAL AND WE HAVE 
BEEN HEARING THAT FROM HOUSE 

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.275
MANAGERS THAT THEY WANT TO 
CONSTRUCT A TIMELINE. THEY WANT 

01:18:26.504 --> 01:18:29.258
TO SHOW THIS WAS NOT ONE 
SINGULAR EVENT. IT WAS A PART OF

01:18:29.487 --> 01:18:32.262
A GROUP OF EVENTS FROM WEEKS IF 
NOT MONTHS OF DONALD TRUMP 

01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:34.491
HAVING RHETORIC ABOUT THE 
ELECTION BEING RAKED AND WHY 

01:18:34.564 --> 01:18:36.564
THAT 

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:43.388
IS IMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH 
THAT THERE IS A TREND, TO 

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.935
ESTABLISH THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST
A GROUP OF PEOPLE COMING 

01:18:46.164 --> 01:18:48.164
TOGETHER HIGHLY PASSIONATE ABOUT
COMING INTO THE CAPITAL ON 

01:18:48.267 --> 01:18:50.579
JANUARY 6 THAT SOME OF THEM EVEN
RECRUITED MEMBERS OF THEIR 

01:18:50.815 --> 01:18:53.507
FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THEIR 
STATES TO COME IN RIOTS ON BUSES

01:18:53.757 --> 01:18:55.757
TO 

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.404
GET HERE FOR THIS EVENT SO THIS 
WAS PLANNED. THERE WAS SOME 

01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:01.694
CHOREOGRAPHY WITH IT. THEY WERE 
COMING IN AT ALL DIFFERENT 

01:19:01.934 --> 01:19:04.648
ANGLES OF THE CAPITAL COMPLEX. 
IT WAS NOT A RANDOM EVENT. SO 

01:19:04.876 --> 01:19:08.299
HOUSE MANAGERS WANT TO SHOW THAT
THIS WAS A PART OF A LARGER 

01:19:08.532 --> 01:19:10.600
EVENT AND THE EVENT IS THAT 
DONALD TRUMP THROUGHOUT HIS 

01:19:10.837 --> 01:19:14.026
CAMPAIGN, THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGN, HE WAS TEEING UP TO 

01:19:14.255 --> 01:19:16.255
THIS MOMENT 

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.466
AND ALSO IN THE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT IN THE DRAFT, IT 

01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:25.671
DOES TALK ABOUT THAT CALL HE 
MADE A FEW DAYS BEFORE JANUARY 6

01:19:25.912 --> 01:19:28.494
TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF 
GEORGIA ASKING HIM TO QUOTE FIND

01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:30.727
SOME VOTES FOR HIM. THAT IS A 
PART OF 

01:19:34.131 --> 01:19:37.618
IT ALSO. A WANT TO PROJECT TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS WELL IS 

01:19:37.859 --> 01:19:40.226
TO THE SENATORS THAT THIS IS A 
PART OF LONG-STANDING BEHAVIOR. 

01:19:40.456 --> 01:19:43.017
IT WAS NOT A RANDOM EVENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW COMPLICIT DOES THAT MAKE 

01:19:43.762 --> 01:19:45.762
REPUBLICAN SENATORS AND HOUSE 
MEMBERS, REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO

01:19:45.777 --> 01:19:49.445
ARE SITTING HERE IN THIS CHAMBER
TODAY LISTENING TO THESE 

01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:52.374
ARGUMENTS IF THEY WERE 
SUPPORTING THROUGH THE 

01:19:57.304 --> 01:20:00.286
BOGUS LAWSUITS THEY GAVE TRUMPS 
CHALLENGES SOME SORT OF SHEEN OF

01:20:00.515 --> 01:20:02.612
LEGAL CREDIBILITY JUST BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE BEEN FILED AND ALSO 

01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:07.623
WERE REFUSING TO ACCEPT AND 
PUBLICLY SAY THAT JOE BIDEN HAD 

01:20:07.988 --> 01:20:10.378
WON THE ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY PERSONAL OPINION WOULD BE 

01:20:10.614 --> 01:20:12.614
A 

01:20:14.832 --> 01:20:16.832
FAIR AMOUNT. THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS HAVE MADE A

01:20:16.966 --> 01:20:19.228
DELIBERATE DECISION NOT TO PUT 
REPUBLICANS ON TRIAL HERE. THEY 

01:20:19.469 --> 01:20:23.596
OBVIOUSLY NEED 17 REPUBLICAN 
VOTES. SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO 

01:20:23.832 --> 01:20:29.882
HEAR DEMOCRATS SAYING JOSH HOLLY
DESERVES BLAME FOR HELPING 

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.812
INSIDE THE MOB BY GIVING THIS 
FALSE PATENT OF LEGITIMACY TO 

01:20:37.996 --> 01:20:40.439
THE CHALLENGING THE ELECTION 
RESULTS AND IN FACT, TRUMP'S 

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.752
LAWYERS HAVE SAID THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO MAKE THAT CLAIM. THEY 

01:20:44.983 --> 01:20:50.681
ARE UNDER PRESSURE BY TRUMP TO 
DO SO AND THAT IS WHY HIS FIRST 

01:20:50.917 --> 01:20:53.464
LEGAL TEAM, THE GUYS FROM SOUTH 
CAROLINA ALL QUIT TWO WEEKS AGO 

01:20:53.704 --> 01:20:57.404
BECAUSE THEY WERE WILLING TO 
ARGUE THAT ELECTION ACTUALLY WAS

01:20:57.634 --> 01:21:01.986
STOLEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE OF THAT AT ALL. I THINK

01:21:02.215 --> 01:21:05.354
YOU COULD MAKE A VERY STRONG 
LEGAL ARGUMENT OR CERTAINLY A 

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:10.536
POLITICAL ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE 
LIKE HOLLY AND TED CRUZ DESERVE 

01:21:10.768 --> 01:21:15.016
QUITE A LOT OF BLAME BUT WE ARE 
NOT GOING TO HEAR THAT FROM THE 

01:21:15.246 --> 01:21:17.826
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS BECAUSE IT 
IS NEVER A GOOD THING TO 

01:21:18.052 --> 01:21:20.052
ANTAGONIZE 

01:21:22.823 --> 01:21:28.023
THE JURY DURING A TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOT ONLY THAT BUT EVEN THOUGH

01:21:28.255 --> 01:21:31.073
WE ARE SEEING THE HOUSE JUST SO 
SPLIT AND DIVIDED RIGHT NOW AND 

01:21:31.301 --> 01:21:33.327
DEMOCRATS FOR EXAMPLE EXPRESSING
ACTUAL FEAR OVER THERE SAFETY 

01:21:33.572 --> 01:21:37.304
WHEN IT NEARBY REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO WERE 

01:21:37.537 --> 01:21:39.891
NOT, PROMISING NOT TO BRING 
WEAPONS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR, ETC.

01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:42.242
BUT THE SENATE HAS TRADITIONALLY
BEEN A REALLY COLLEGIAL BODY. 

01:21:42.474 --> 01:21:45.193
YOU COULD SEE A LOT OF MEMBERS 
BRISTLING EVEN IF THEY MIGHT 

01:21:49.006 --> 01:21:51.135
PRIVATELY AGREE THAT THESE HOUSE
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS COME IN 

01:21:51.368 --> 01:21:53.810
HERE AND START POINTING THE 
FINGER AT THEIR PEERS. 

01:21:53.811 --> 01:21:55.811
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS 

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.422
TOTALLY CORRECT AND A LOT OF 
THIS DYNAMIC IS MUCH MORE 

01:22:01.653 --> 01:22:04.194
PRONOUNCED ON THE HOUSE SIDE. 
THE HOUSE SIDE IS A MORE 

01:22:04.431 --> 01:22:06.431
MAJORITARIAN BODY, THEY ARE 
SMALLER DISTRICTS. THEY ARE A 

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:09.403
LOT MORE FRINGE FIGURES ON THE 
RIGHT AND THE LEFT IN THE RIGHT 

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:14.176
AND THERE IS A LOT MORE PALPABLE
TENSION OVER THERE. THEY DO HAVE

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:17.200
METAL DETECTORS THAT MEMBERS 
HAVE TO GO THROUGH NOW OR THEY 

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.460
GET FINDS. SOME REPUBLICANS 

01:22:22.194 --> 01:22:24.194
STILL REFUSING TO GO THROUGH 
METAL DETECTORS AND GETTING 

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:26.772
FIND. HOUSE MEMBERS REFUSING TO 
WEAR MASKS. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:29.010
STORIES, THAT'S 

01:22:30.326 --> 01:22:32.873
NOT TRUE. WE HAVE HEARD REFUSAL 
OF SENATORS TO WEAR MASKS LIKE 

01:22:33.105 --> 01:22:35.105
RAND PAUL BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT 
KIND 

01:22:37.829 --> 01:22:39.961
OF BODY. THE SENATE HAS LONG 
CONSIDERED ITSELF THE WORLD'S 

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.091
GREATEST DELIBERATIVE BODY AND 
THEY CERTAINLY WOULDN'T TAKE 

01:22:42.092 --> 01:22:44.187
WHILE TO A COLLEAGUE BEING 
IMPUGNED AND YOU CERTAINLY COULD

01:22:44.419 --> 01:22:46.419
SEE PEOPLE RAISING OBJECTIONS IF
THAT WERE 

01:22:50.572 --> 01:22:54.840
TO HAPPEN. IT IS NOT GOING TO 
WIN PEOPLE OVER IN THE TRIAL OF 

01:22:55.075 --> 01:22:57.297
PUBLIC OPINION EITHER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK TO THE WHITE 

01:22:57.533 --> 01:23:00.100
HOUSE TO CHECK IN WITH JOYCE. 
WHAT IS THE LATEST REACTION FROM

01:23:00.329 --> 01:23:03.495
THE WHITE HOUSE AND TEAM BIDEN 
ON THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL? 

01:23:03.496 --> 01:23:06.010
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 
NOT CHANGED THEIR MESSAGING ON 

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.873
IMPEACHMENT AND THEIR REACTION 
TO THE IMPEACHMENT AS IT IS NOT 

01:23:09.104 --> 01:23:12.621
LIKELY THAT THEY WILL. THEY HAVE
SAID SINCE TAKING OFFICE THAT 

01:23:15.815 --> 01:23:18.997
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS A LOT OF 
THINGS TO DO. HE HAS A NUMBER OF

01:23:19.236 --> 01:23:21.329
AGENDA ITEMS HE WANTS TO 
ACCOMPLISH AND THEY HAVE LARGELY

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.891
STAYED OUT OF THE FRAY IN 
REACTING TO ANYTHING THAT IS 

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.810
HAPPENING CERTAINLY THE DAY TO 
DAY NEWS THAT IS COMING OUT ON 

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.437
IMPEACHMENT WHICH IS IN DRAWING 
TO START CONTRAST WITH WHAT WE 

01:23:33.671 --> 01:23:35.507
WOULD'VE BEEN USED TO SING 
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMPS 

01:23:35.508 --> 01:23:39.581
ADMINISTRATION WHERE HE WAS 
CONSTANTLY ON TWITTER REACTING 

01:23:39.816 --> 01:23:41.886
TO REALLY EVERYTHING THAT WAS 
GOING ON AND CERTAINLY WATCHING 

01:23:42.123 --> 01:23:46.161
THE NEWS AS IT IS UNFOLDING. WE 
DO KNOW THAT A PRESS BRIEFING IS

01:23:46.392 --> 01:23:49.767
SCHEDULED FOR ANY MOMENT NOW AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE 

01:23:49.994 --> 01:23:52.647
BEEN SCHEDULING THESE PRESS 
CONFERENCES OVER THE LAST TWO 

01:23:52.874 --> 01:23:56.045
DAYS, THESE BRIEFINGS, RIGHT 
AROUND THE TIME WHEN IMPEACHMENT

01:23:56.286 --> 01:23:58.731
STARTS. IT COULD BE A SIGNAL 
THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 

01:23:58.966 --> 01:24:02.422
GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW 
THAT BIDEN IS FOCUSED ON AND WE 

01:24:02.652 --> 01:24:08.092
HEARD FROM JEN YESTERDAY IN THE 
LATEST PRESS BRIEFING WHERE SHE 

01:24:08.322 --> 01:24:10.160
WAS ASKED ABOUT IMPEACHMENT 
NUMEROUS TIMES AND BIDEN'S 

01:24:10.161 --> 01:24:12.161
THOUGHTS 

01:24:13.911 --> 01:24:15.981
ON IMPEACHMENT, AND SHE SAID 
NUMEROUS TIMES OVER AND OVER 

01:24:16.206 --> 01:24:18.907
AGAIN THAT BIDEN IS NOT FOCUSED 
ON THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO 

01:24:19.139 --> 01:24:25.323
RESPOND TO THE DAY TO DAY NEWS 
THAT IS HAPPENING. SHE SAID THAT

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:29.114
BIDEN IS A PRESIDENT, NOT A 
PUNGENT, AND SHE ALSO SAID THAT 

01:24:29.353 --> 01:24:33.745
SPEAKING ON BIDEN'S THOUGHTS ON 
TRUMP, BIDEN DECIDED TO RUN 

01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:38.495
AGAINST TRUMP BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT TRUMP WAS A THREAT TO OUR 

01:24:38.735 --> 01:24:41.736
DEMOCRACY. NOT A LOT OF MYSTERY 
THERE ON HOW BIDEN FEELS ABOUT 

01:24:41.963 --> 01:24:46.214
TRUMP AND HIS ROLE IN THIS, BUT 
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT 

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.756
HIMSELF YESTERDAY DURING A ROOM 
IN THE OVAL OFFICE DURING A 

01:24:53.983 --> 01:24:56.836
SITUATION IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
WERE A REPORTER ASKED HIM ARE 

01:24:57.075 --> 01:24:59.366
YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING THE 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL? WHAT ARE YOUR

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.584
THOUGHTS ON THAT AND TAKE A 
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 

01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:08.479
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I TOLD YOU BEFORE I HAVE A 
JOB. MY JOB IS TO KEEP PEOPLE, 

01:25:08.724 --> 01:25:13.512
WE HAVE ALREADY LOST OVER 40 
50,000 PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO 

01:25:13.746 --> 01:25:16.505
LOSE A WHOLE LOT MORE IF WE 
DON'T ACT AND ACT DECISIVELY AND

01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:21.197
QUICKLY. A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT 
OF CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BED 

01:25:21.439 --> 01:25:23.911
HUNGRY, A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE 
FOOD INSECURE. THEY ARE IN 

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.620
TROUBLE. THE SENATE HAS THEIR 
JOB. THEY ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN. 

01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:30.634
I'M SURE THEY WILL CONDUCT 
THEMSELVES WELL AND THAT IS ALL 

01:25:30.869 --> 01:25:33.732
I'M GOING TO SAY ABOUT 
IMPEACHMENT. 

01:25:33.733 --> 01:25:35.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS IMPEACHMENT IS GOING ON IN

01:25:39.769 --> 01:25:41.769
THE SENATE,

01:25:46.548 --> 01:25:49.137
BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS 
WILL BE GOING TO THE PENTAGON TO

01:25:49.366 --> 01:25:51.695
MEET WITH HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY 
LLOYD AUSTIN WHO IS THE FIRST 

01:25:51.927 --> 01:25:54.012
BLACK PERSON TO LEAD THE 
PENTAGON. THEY WILL BE GOING 

01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:56.110
THERE AND HONORING BLACK 
SERVICEMEMBERS AS WELL IN 

01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:58.359
OBSERVANCE OF FEBRUARY IS BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH. LETTER TODAY FROM

01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:01.142
THE WHITE HOUSE, WE WILL BE 
EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM JEFF WHO 

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:07.523
IS THE COVID TASK FORCE, COVID 
RESPONSE COORDINATOR I SHOULD 

01:26:07.752 --> 01:26:10.325
SAY AND WILL BE GIVING A PRESS 
BRIEFING AND WE SHOULD BE 

01:26:10.561 --> 01:26:12.650
HEARING SOME NEWS ABOUT THE 
VACCINE ROLLOUT AND BIDEN IS 

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.959
ALSO EXPECTED TO SIGN A COUPLE 
OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON 

01:26:15.187 --> 01:26:18.438
IMMIGRATION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO 

01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:22.453
TO YOU JAMES FOR THIS QUESTION 
OF JUST WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.156
WHILE THE SENATE IS DOING THIS. 
EVEN THOUGH THE SENATORS ARE 

01:26:27.394 --> 01:26:29.844
LITERALLY LOCKED IN THIS ROOM OR
THIS AREA DURING THE TRIAL, 

01:26:30.074 --> 01:26:34.430
THEIR STAFF CAN BE GETTING 
THINGS DONE. HOW HARD IS IT TO 

01:26:34.659 --> 01:26:37.767
KEEP MOMENTUM GOING ON THE COVID
RELIEF BILL? 

01:26:37.768 --> 01:26:40.537
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT NOW AS WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING THIS MORNING, THERE HAS 

01:26:40.772 --> 01:26:44.653
BEEN A SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE 
CONFIRMATION HEARING, 

01:26:44.881 --> 01:26:46.881
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 

01:26:50.249 --> 01:26:53.566
ASKING QUESTIONS. THEY ARE STILL
MOVING THROUGH REGULAR ORDER TO 

01:26:53.794 --> 01:26:55.879
TEE UP SEVERAL CONFIRMATION 
VOTES FOR NEXT WEEK TO GET 

01:26:56.105 --> 01:26:58.105
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S TEAM IN PLACE.
NEGOTIATIONS 

01:27:01.625 --> 01:27:04.845
ON THE COVID BILL ARE HAPPENING.
THEY ARE NOT IN ANY MEANINGFUL 

01:27:05.072 --> 01:27:07.072
WAY IMPACTED BY THIS. THEY 
ALREADY CLEARED THE PROCEDURAL 

01:27:07.182 --> 01:27:09.268
HURDLE FOR BUDGET RECONCILIATION
LAST WEEK AFTER THAT I'LL NOTE 

01:27:09.497 --> 01:27:13.800
-- ALL NIGHT VOTE WHERE HARRIS 
HAD TO COME TO BREAK THE TIE ON 

01:27:14.034 --> 01:27:16.034
THE ULTIMATE VOTES. THEY ARE 
STILL MANEUVERING BACK AND 

01:27:16.114 --> 01:27:20.035
FORTH. YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS WHO 
ARE NOT TOTALLY UNITED ON HOW TO

01:27:21.795 --> 01:27:24.263
HANDLE THIS IN THE HOUSE MEMBERS
AND SENATORS ARE PUTTING FORTH 

01:27:27.078 --> 01:27:29.429
VARIOUS PROPOSALS FOR WHERE TO 
CUT OFF THE STIMULUS CHECKS, HOW

01:27:29.658 --> 01:27:32.209
BIG TO MAKE THE STIMULUS CHECKS.
ALL OF THAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED 

01:27:32.568 --> 01:27:36.064
BEHIND THE SCENES AND A LOT OF 
THE FOCUS OF THE BIDEN 

01:27:36.295 --> 01:27:38.295
ADMINISTRATION 

01:27:39.877 --> 01:27:41.877
RIGHT NOW IS STOPPING SOME OF 
THE SO-CALLED MIDNIGHT 

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.015
REGULATIONS BY THE OUTGOING 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I TALKED 

01:27:44.251 --> 01:27:46.251
TO A BIDEN PERSON AND HE SAID 
THEY ARE 

01:27:49.829 --> 01:27:52.131
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE THINGS 

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.355
THAT COULD ACTUALLY HAVE 
TANGIBLE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON 

01:27:54.356 --> 01:27:57.801
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES 
TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEREGULATION TO

01:27:58.029 --> 01:28:00.029
TRY TO STOP THAT FROM GOING INTO
EFFECT 

01:28:03.241 --> 01:28:05.463
WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THIS TRIAL 
DRAGGED ON FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS 

01:28:05.709 --> 01:28:08.747
WHICH WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY VOTED
AT THE END OF THIS WEEK TO CALL 

01:28:08.978 --> 01:28:11.566
WITNESSES. THAT IT COULD START 
TO REALLY TAKE A TOLL ON THE 

01:28:11.805 --> 01:28:14.282
STIMULUS PACKAGE AND ON THE 
OTHER THINGS THAT BIDEN WANTS TO

01:28:14.509 --> 01:28:16.509
GET DONE BUT A WEEK IS NOT 

01:28:19.426 --> 01:28:22.735
GOING TO DERAIL PRESIDENT 
BIDEN'S AGENDA AND BIDEN DOES 

01:28:22.976 --> 01:28:26.400
HAVE SOME POLITICAL EXPERIENCE 
AND TALENT AT 

01:28:26.627 --> 01:28:28.627
COMPARTMENTALIZATION WHICH IS 
BEING ABLE TO NOT TALK ABOUT 

01:28:28.699 --> 01:28:33.115
THINGS HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT AND FOCUS ON THINGS HE IS 

01:28:33.354 --> 01:28:36.068
GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER THAT
IS THE VACCINE OR THE PENTAGON 

01:28:36.302 --> 01:28:39.114
OR WHAT HAVE YOU. BIDEN DID A 
PRETTY GOOD JOB THAT DURING THE 

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:41.892
CAMPAIGN WITH DRIVING HIS 
MESSAGE AT A TIME WHEN ALL OF US

01:28:42.122 --> 01:28:44.122
IN THE MEDIA ARE 

01:28:47.248 --> 01:28:51.240
FOCUSED ON THE THING THAT DONALD
TRUMP HAD DONE THAT DAY WAS. 

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:54.057
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO RHONDA. WE ARE 
WATCHING THESE SENATORS HAD INTO

01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:58.276
THE CHAMBER. THERE IS SENATOR 
GRASSLEY. WE JUST SAW MITCH 

01:28:58.506 --> 01:29:00.826
McCONNELL A FEW MOMENTS AGO, THE
TOP REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE. 

01:29:01.057 --> 01:29:03.057
WHAT WILL YOU BE LISTENING AND 
WATCHING 

01:29:06.547 --> 01:29:08.547
FOR TODAY?

01:29:19.001 --> 01:29:21.788
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY IS 
WAITING FOR IS TO SEE THIS NEW 

01:29:22.015 --> 01:29:23.881
EVIDENCE AT THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAY THEY 

01:29:23.882 --> 01:29:26.726
ARE GOING TO PUT FORWARD. THIS 
IS GOING TO BE TO REFRESH OUR 

01:29:26.956 --> 01:29:29.641
MEMORIES FROM THE BEGINNING OF 
THE SHOW, THIS WILL BE A NEVER 

01:29:29.872 --> 01:29:32.456
BEFORE SEEN SECURITY FOOTAGE OF 
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6 SO I 

01:29:32.685 --> 01:29:35.696
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THAT IS
AND WHAT IMPACT THAT HAS. SO 

01:29:35.924 --> 01:29:37.924
SENATORS WERE REALLY ENGAGED 
YESTERDAY AND LOOKING AT THE 

01:29:37.991 --> 01:29:40.017
VERY VIVID MONTAGE THAT THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS PUT 

01:29:40.244 --> 01:29:43.030
FORWARD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
ARGUMENTS, THE VIVID VIDEO THEY 

01:29:43.259 --> 01:29:45.826
SHOWED AN THAT MOVED SOME OF THE
SENATORS SO I'M INTERESTED TO 

01:29:46.056 --> 01:29:49.052
SEE SOME OF THIS NEW FOOTAGE AND
WHAT THAT MIGHT DO AND HOW THAT 

01:29:49.285 --> 01:29:51.285
EITHER CARRIES ON THE MOMENTUM 
OF THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

01:29:51.506 --> 01:29:53.613
MANAGERS HAVE HAD SINCE 
YESTERDAY AND WHAT THAT DOES TO 

01:29:53.842 --> 01:29:55.842
THIS TRIAL SO WATCHING THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY HAPPEN.

HOURS OF TIME TODAY FOR THE

IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TO MAKE 
THEIR ARGUMENTS. WE DO EXPECT TO

01:30:06.733 --> 01:30:09.305
HEAR FROM ALL OR AT LEAST A LOT 
OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. 

01:30:09.536 --> 01:30:12.469
THIS WILL BE A CHANCE TO SEE 
THEM EACH AN ACTION. WE HEARD 

01:30:12.696 --> 01:30:14.696
FROM THREE OF THEM. 

01:30:17.418 --> 01:30:21.551

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MAJORITY LEADER IS 

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.964

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU PREFER THE 

01:33:00.965 --> 01:33:04.250
INFORMATION FOR ALL SENATORS, NO
MOTIONS WERE FILED THIS MORNING.

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:09.355

01:33:14.187 --> 01:33:19.736
OF SENATE RESOLUTIONS 47, THE 
MANAGERS FOR THE HOUSE OF 

01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:21.885
REPRESENTATIVES

01:33:24.518 --> 01:33:26.607
HAVE 16 HOURS TO MAKE THE

01:33:36.209 --> 01:33:40.150
REPRESENTATIVES.  MR. RASKIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 

01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:43.000
PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE. GOOD MORNING AND GOOD 

01:33:43.143 --> 01:33:45.143
DAY.

01:33:46.727 --> 01:33:49.023
SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS TRIAL IS 
A CONTEST OF LAWYERS OR EVEN 

01:33:49.239 --> 01:33:52.520
WORSE, A COMPETITION BETWEEN 
MEDICAL PARTIES. IT IS NEITHER. 

01:33:52.717 --> 01:33:58.266
IT IS A MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR 
AMERICA. MY LATE FATHER MARCUS 

01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:02.783
RASKIN ONCE WROTE, DEMOCRACY 
NEEDS A GROUND TO STAND UPON AND

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.449
THAT GROUND IS THE TRUTH. 
AMERICAN NEEDS THE TRUTH ABOUT X

01:34:06.646 --> 01:34:09.902
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ROLE IN
INCITING THE INSURRECTION ON 

01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:14.434
JANUARY 6th, BECAUSE IT 
THREATENED OUR GOVERNMENT AND IT

01:34:14.646 --> 01:34:17.040
DISRUPTED, IT EASILY COULD HAVE 
DESTROYED THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER 

01:34:17.186 --> 01:34:21.066
OF POWER IN THE UNITED STATES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 233 YEARS

01:34:24.882 --> 01:34:26.882
. IT WAS SUGGESTED YESTERDAY BY 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S COUNSEL

01:34:26.952 --> 01:34:32.462
THAT THIS IS REALLY LIKE A 
ACCIDENT OR NATURAL DISASTER, 

01:34:32.665 --> 01:34:35.915
WHERE LOTS OF PEOPLE GET INJURED
AND KILLED IN SOCIETY WHEN THEY 

01:34:36.132 --> 01:34:38.132
ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME
AND

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:44.110
THAT IS A NATURAL AND NORMAL 
HUMAN REACTION ACCORDING TO 

01:34:44.167 --> 01:34:48.258
PRESIDENTS COUNCIL BUT HE SAYS 
IT IS UNFAIR IN THIS CASE. 

01:34:48.674 --> 01:34:50.114
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, 
ACCORDING TO MR. CASTOR, 

01:34:50.115 --> 01:34:54.016
ESSENTIALLY INNOCENT BYSTANDER 
WHO GOT SWEPT UP IN THIS 

01:34:54.235 --> 01:34:57.297
CATASTROPHE BUT DID NOTHING 
WRONG. THIS ASSERTION, MR. 

01:34:57.497 --> 01:34:59.959
CASTOR UNERRINGLY ECHOES HIS 
CLIENT, X PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

01:35:00.165 --> 01:35:03.669
WHO DECLARED AFTER THE 
INSURRECTION THAT HIS CONDUCT 

01:35:03.887 --> 01:35:12.111
WAS PUT TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. WE 
CAN ONLY ASSUME HE COULD DO, AND

01:35:12.315 --> 01:35:15.975
WHAT DO, THE EXACT SAME THING 
AGAIN, BECAUSE HE SAID HIS 

01:35:16.182 --> 01:35:20.486
CONDUCT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE.
SO, NOW THE FACTUAL INQUIRY OF 

01:35:20.684 --> 01:35:23.557
THE TRIAL IS SQUARELY POSED FOR 
US. THE JURISDICTIONAL 

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:27.875
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE IS GONE, 
WHETHER YOU WERE PERSUADED BY 

01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:33.810
THE PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL 
ANALYSIS YESTERDAY OR NOT, THE 

01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:37.521
SENATE VOTED TO REJECT IT. THE 
SENATE IS NO PROPERLY EXERCISING

01:35:37.723 --> 01:35:41.390
ITS JURISDICTION AND SITTING AS 
A COURT OF IMPEACHMENT 

01:35:41.579 --> 01:35:48.486
CONDUCTING A TRIAL ON THE FACTS.
WE ARE HAVING A TRIAL ON THE 

01:35:48.636 --> 01:35:52.446
FACTS. THE HOUSE SAYS 
EX-PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

01:35:52.647 --> 01:35:56.139
INCITED A VIOLENT INSURRECTION 
AGAINST CONGRESS AND THE 

01:35:56.554 --> 01:36:00.843
CONSTITUTION AND THE PEOPLE. THE
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER AND THE 

01:36:01.048 --> 01:36:06.380
PRESIDENT'S SAY HIS CONDUCT WAS 
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE AND HE IS A 

01:36:06.584 --> 01:36:11.081
INNOCENT VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES
LIKE THE OTHER INNOCENT VICTIMS 

01:36:11.486 --> 01:36:13.952
THAT WE WILL SEE GETTING CAUGHT 
UP IN ALL OF THE VIOLENCE AND 

01:36:14.165 --> 01:36:18.696
CHAOS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS
TO THAT WILL BE FOR YOU TO SEE 

01:36:18.919 --> 01:36:25.026
AND HEAR AND DIGEST. THE 
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW YOU THAT X 

01:36:25.243 --> 01:36:27.243
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NO INNOCENT 
BYSTANDER.

01:36:31.005 --> 01:36:33.601
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE 
CLEARLY INVITED THE JANUARY 6th 

01:36:33.738 --> 01:36:37.118
INSURRECTION. IT WILL SHOW THAT 
DONALD TRUMP SURRENDERED HIS 

01:36:37.263 --> 01:36:42.523
ROLE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND 
BECAME THE IN FIGHTER IN CHIEF 

01:36:42.939 --> 01:36:49.104
OF A DANGEROUS INSURRECTION IN 
THIS ONE, AS ONE OF OUR 

01:36:49.305 --> 01:36:51.756
COLLEAGUES BUT THIS SO COGENTLY 
ON JANUARY 6 ITSELF, THE 

01:36:51.964 --> 01:36:56.486
GREATEST BETRAYAL OF THE 
PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

01:36:57.246 --> 01:37:04.485
UNITED STATES. THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW YOU THAT HE SAW IT COMING 

01:37:04.703 --> 01:37:08.340
AND WAS NOT REMOTELY SURPRISED 
BY THE VIOLENCE. WHEN THE 

01:37:08.505 --> 01:37:12.741
VIOLENCE INEXORABLY AND 
INEVITABLY CAME AS PREDICTED AND

01:37:12.955 --> 01:37:18.310
OVERRAN THIS BODY AND THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH CHAOS, 

01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:21.845
WE WILL SHOW YOU THAT HE 
COMPLETELY ABDICATED HIS DUTY AS

01:37:22.046 --> 01:37:27.385
COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO STOP THE 
VIOLENCE AND PROTECT THE 

01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:30.268
GOVERNMENT AND PROTECT OUR 
OFFICERS AND OUR PEOPLE. HE 

01:37:30.467 --> 01:37:35.125
VIOLATED HIS OATH OF OFFICE TO 
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE

01:37:35.268 --> 01:37:39.980
CONSTITUTION, THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.

01:37:40.497 --> 01:37:43.125
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW YOU THAT 
HE ASSEMBLED AND FRAMED AND 

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:46.664
INCITED HIS FOLLOWERS TO DESCEND
UPON THE CAPITAL TO STOP THE 

01:37:46.866 --> 01:37:50.963
STEEL, TO BLOCK VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE AND CONGRESS FROM 

01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:55.806
FINALIZING HIS OPPONENTS 
ELECTION VICTORY OVER HIM.

01:38:01.268 --> 01:38:03.279
HE WILL SHOW THAT HE WAS WARNED 
THAT THESE FOLLOWERS WERE 

01:38:03.493 --> 01:38:07.616
PREPARED FOR A VIOLENT ATTACK 
TARGETING US AT THE CAPITAL 

01:38:08.038 --> 01:38:10.055
THROUGH MEDIA REPORTS, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT REPORTS AND EVEN 

01:38:10.201 --> 01:38:16.077
ARRESTS. IN SHORT, WE WILL PROVE
THAT THE IMPEACHED PRESIDENT WAS

01:38:16.283 --> 01:38:20.999
NO INNOCENT BYSTANDER WHO HIS 
CONDUCT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE 

01:38:21.437 --> 01:38:26.165
AND SHOULD BE A STANDARD FOR 
FUTURE PRESIDENTS, BUT THAT HE 

01:38:26.375 --> 01:38:30.902
INCITED THIS ATTACK AND HE SAW 
IT COMING. TO US, IT MAY HAVE 

01:38:31.102 --> 01:38:34.785
FELT LIKE CHAOS AND MADNESS BUT 
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MADNESS

01:38:35.549 --> 01:38:37.549
THAT DAY.

01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:42.036
THIS WAS AN ORGANIZED ATTACK ON 
THE COUNTING OF THE ELECTORAL 

01:38:42.445 --> 01:38:45.528
COLLEGE VOTES IN JOINT SESSION 
OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, 

01:38:45.732 --> 01:38:51.255
THE 12th AMENDMENT AND ELECTORAL
COUNT ACT TO PREVENT VICE 

01:38:51.472 --> 01:38:56.825
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND TO 
PREVENT US FOR ACCOUNTING 

01:38:57.225 --> 01:39:02.314
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES TO 
CERTIFY JOE BIDEN'S VICTORY OF 

01:39:02.754 --> 01:39:10.853
306 TO 232 IN THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE. A MARGIN THAT THE 

01:39:11.271 --> 01:39:15.941
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD DECLARED A 
LANDSLIDE IN 2016. WHEN MIKE 

01:39:16.093 --> 01:39:18.093
COLLEAGUE

01:39:20.072 --> 01:39:22.561
, MR. NEGUS'S BASE AFTER ME, HE 
WILL SET FORTH IN DETAIL, THE 

01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:26.420
ROADMAP OF ALL OF THE EVIDENCE 
IN THE CASE. MY FELLOW HOUSE 

01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:28.506
MANAGERS AND I WILL TAKE YOU 
THROUGH THE EVIDENCE 

01:39:28.507 --> 01:39:30.686
STEP-BY-STEP SO EVERYONE CAN SEE
EXACTLY HOW THESE EVENTS 

01:39:30.839 --> 01:39:35.322
UNFOLDED. I WANT TO TELL YOU A 
FEW KEY REASONS NOW THAT WE KNOW

01:39:36.092 --> 01:39:42.306
THIS CASE IS NOT ABOUT BLAMING 
AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER FOR THE 

01:39:42.513 --> 01:39:47.653
HORRIFIC VIOLENCE AND HARM THAT 
TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY 6th, THIS 

01:39:47.856 --> 01:39:52.141
IS ABOUT HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THE
PERSON SINGULARLY RESPONSIBLE 

01:39:52.364 --> 01:39:55.407
FOR INCITING THE TYPE. LET'S 
START WITH DECEMBER 12th. YOU 

01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:59.429
WILL SEE DURING THIS TRIAL A MAN
WHO PRAISED AND ENCOURAGED AND 

01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:04.508
CULTIVATED VIOLENCE. WE HAVE 
JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:10.941
MORE THAN A MONTH AFTER THE 
ELECTION HAS TAKEN PLACE. THAT 

01:40:11.142 --> 01:40:15.877
IS BEFORE THE SECOND MILLION 
MEGA MARCH, A RALLY THAT ENDED 

01:40:16.064 --> 01:40:19.409
IN SERIOUS VIOLENCE AND EVEN THE
BURNING OF THE CHURCH

01:40:24.877 --> 01:40:26.877
AND AS THE PRESIDENT FORECASTED,
WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING. ON 

01:40:26.908 --> 01:40:28.971
DECEMBER 19th, 18 DAYS BEFORE 
JANUARY 6, HE TOLD HIS FACE 

01:40:29.194 --> 01:40:31.254
ABOUT WHERE THE BATTLE WENT BE 
THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT NEXT. 

01:40:32.032 --> 01:40:35.932
JANUARY 6th WOULD BE WILD, HE 
PROMISED. BE THERE, WE WILL BE 

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.113
WILD, SAID THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT, 

01:40:40.302 --> 01:40:42.302
TOO, TURNED OUT

01:40:44.819 --> 01:40:47.252
TO BE TRUE. YOU WILL SEE IN THE 
DAYS THAT FOLLOWED THAT DONALD 

01:40:47.472 --> 01:40:49.678
TRUMP CONTINUED TO AGGRESSIVELY 
PROMOTE JANUARY 6th TWO HIS 

01:40:49.826 --> 01:40:54.070
FOLLOWERS. THE EVENT WAS 
SCHEDULED AT THE PRECISE TIME 

01:40:54.282 --> 01:40:58.993
THAT CONGRESS WOULD BE MEETING 
IN JOINT SESSION TO COUNT THE 

01:40:59.202 --> 01:41:04.071
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES AND TO 
FINALIZE THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL 

01:41:04.227 --> 01:41:08.061
ELECTION. IN FACT, IN THE DAYS 
LEADING UP TO THE ATTACK, YOU 

01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:11.726
WILL LEARN THERE WERE COUNTLESS 
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS, NEWS STORIES

01:41:11.922 --> 01:41:16.025
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CREDIBLE 
REPORTS FROM THE FBI AND CAPITOL

01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:20.135
POLICE THAT THE THOUSANDS 
GATHERING FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:23.826
SAVE AMERICA MARCH WERE VIOLENT,
ORGANIZED WITH WEAPONS AND WERE 

01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:29.307
TARGETING THE CAPITOL. THIS 
MODEL WAS SO  ORGANIZED OPENLY 

01:41:29.449 --> 01:41:35.068
AS THEY WOULD LATER SCREAM IN 
THE HALLS AND AS THEY POSTED ON 

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:37.334
FORUMS BEFORE THE ATTACK, THEY 
WERE SENT HERE BY THE PRESIDENT,

01:41:37.533 --> 01:41:40.645
THEY WERE INVITED HERE BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

01:41:40.837 --> 01:41:45.143
OF AMERICA. WHEN THEY SHOWED UP,
KNOWING OF THESE REPORTS THAT 

01:41:45.344 --> 01:41:49.661
THE CROWD WAS ANGRY AND IT WAS 
ARMED, HERE IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP

01:41:50.393 --> 01:41:52.393
TOLD THEM

01:41:55.591 --> 01:41:58.027
, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHIPPED
THE CROWD INTO A FRENZY TELLING 

01:41:58.233 --> 01:42:02.372
FOLLOWERS IF YOU DON'T FIGHT 
LIKE HELL

01:42:05.424 --> 01:42:07.671
, YOU WILL NOT HAVE A COUNTRY 
ANYMORE AND HE'S AIMED STRAIGHT 

01:42:07.885 --> 01:42:11.998
AT THE CAPITAL SAYING YOU WILL 
NEVER TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY WITH

01:42:12.206 --> 01:42:15.238
WEAKNESS, YOU HAVE TO SHOW 
STRENGTH AND YOU HAVE TO BE 

01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:23.299
STRONG. HE TOLD THEM TO FIGHT 
LIKE HELL AND THEY BROUGHT US 

01:42:23.927 --> 01:42:25.927
HELL

01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.794
ON THAT DAY. INCITED BY 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, HIS 

01:42:29.795 --> 01:42:33.049
MOTHER ATTACKED THE CAPITOL.  
THIS WAS LIVE ON TELEVISION 

01:42:33.264 --> 01:42:37.943
BEFORE A HORRIFIED NATION. 
ACCORDING TO THOSE AROUND HIM, 

01:42:38.145 --> 01:42:40.015
AT THE TIME, THIS IS HOW 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

01:42:40.016 --> 01:42:43.100
REPORTEDLY RESPONDED TO THE 
ATTACK THAT WE SAW HIM INSIGHT 

01:42:44.061 --> 01:42:46.061
IN PUBLIC

01:42:48.457 --> 01:42:53.164
, TO LIKE ENTHUSIASM, CONFUSION 
AS TO WHY OTHERS AROUND HIM WERE

01:42:53.374 --> 01:42:59.297
NOT AS HAPPY AS HE WAS. TRUMP 
INSIGHT JANUARY 6th ATTACK, AND 

01:42:59.509 --> 01:43:02.384
WHEN HIS MOM OVERRAN AND 
OCCUPIED THE SENATE AND ATTACKED

01:43:02.591 --> 01:43:06.868
THE HOUSE AND ASSAULTED LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, HE WATCHED ON TV 

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.205
LIKE A REALITY SHOW. HE REVELED 
IN IT AND HE DID NOTHING TO HELP

01:43:12.424 --> 01:43:17.301
US AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, 
INSTEAD, HE SERVED AS THE IN 

01:43:17.504 --> 01:43:21.828
FIGHTER IN CHIEF, SENDING TWEETS
THAT ONLY FURTHER INCITED THE 

01:43:22.576 --> 01:43:26.739
RAMPAGING MOB. HE MADE 
STATEMENTS LOBBY AND 

01:43:26.947 --> 01:43:33.547
SYMPATHIZING WITH THE 
INSURRECTIONIST. 4:17 P.M., OVER

01:43:33.751 --> 01:43:39.513
THREE HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING 
OF THE SEEDS, FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:43:39.716 --> 01:43:41.967
HE SPOKE OUT LOUD, NOT ON 
TWITTER, SPOKE OUT LOUD TO THE 

01:43:42.163 --> 01:43:43.812
AMERICAN PEOPLE. HERE IS WHAT HE
SAID. 

01:43:43.813 --> 01:43:46.584
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW YOUR PAIN, AND I KNOW 
YOU ARE HURT

01:43:52.611 --> 01:43:54.895
, YOU MIGHT BE SAYING ALL RIGHT,
THE PRESIDENT WILL CONSOLE US, 

01:43:55.097 --> 01:43:58.163
HE WILL REASSURE AMERICA, HE 
KNOWS OUR PAIN AND WE ARE HURT. 

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:03.933
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE THE HORRIFIC IMAGES 
OF OFFICERS BEING IMPALED AND 

01:44:04.136 --> 01:44:08.674
SMASHED OVER THE HEAD. WE WERE 
JUST UNDER ATTACK FOR THREE 

01:44:08.859 --> 01:44:10.904
HOURS BUT THIS IS WHAT HE GOES 
ON TO SAY. 

01:44:10.905 --> 01:44:14.812
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW YOUR PAIN AND I KNOW 
YOU ARE HURT, WE HAD AN ELECTION

01:44:15.017 --> 01:44:20.120
THAT WAS STOLEN FROM US, IT WAS 
A LANDSLIDE ELECTION AND 

01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:23.744
EVERYONE KNOWS IT, ESPECIALLY 
THE OTHER SIDE. 

01:44:23.745 --> 01:44:25.745
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.014
YOU THINK HE IS ABOUT TO DECRY 
THE MAYHEM AND VIOLENCE, THE US 

01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:33.618
PRECEDENTED SPECTACLE OF THIS 
MONTH ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL

01:44:34.707 --> 01:44:37.775
, BUT HE IS STILL PROMOTING THE 
BIG LIFE THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE 

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:40.546
FOR INFLAMING AND INCITING THE 
MOB IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:44:47.873 --> 01:44:50.989
IF ANYONE EVER HAD A DOUBT AS TO
HIS FOCUS THAT DAY, IT WAS NOT 

01:44:51.130 --> 01:44:53.638
TO DEFEND US, IT WAS NOT TO 
CONSOLE US, IT WAS TO PRAISE AND

01:44:53.835 --> 01:44:55.872
SYMPATHIZE AND COMMISERATE WITH 
THE MOB. IT WAS CUT TO CONTINUE 

01:44:56.077 --> 01:44:59.130
TO ACT AS IN CHIEF, NOT 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF, BY TELLING 

01:44:59.329 --> 01:45:02.427
THEM UP THERE ELECTION WAS 
STOLEN FROM THEM. EVEN THEN 

01:45:02.633 --> 01:45:05.804
AFTER THE VICIOUS ATTACK, HE 
CONTINUED TO SPREAD THE BIG LIFE

01:45:10.833 --> 01:45:13.304
. AS EVERYONE HERE KNOWS, JOE 
BIDEN WON BY MORE THAN 7 MILLION

01:45:13.515 --> 01:45:17.192
VOTES AND 306 TO 232 IN THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE. DONALD TRUMP 

01:45:17.343 --> 01:45:22.334
REFUSED TO ACCEPT HER LOSS, EVEN
AFTER THIS ATTACK. HE CELEBRATED

01:45:22.536 --> 01:45:26.363
THE PEOPLE WHO VIOLENTLY 
INTERFERED WITH THE PEACEFUL 

01:45:26.514 --> 01:45:30.962
TRANSFER OF POWER FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND 

01:45:31.174 --> 01:45:33.174
THAT THAT AT HIS URGING.

01:45:37.746 --> 01:45:40.198
WHEN HE DID, AND THIS VIDEO 
FINALLY TELL THEM TO GO HOME AND

01:45:40.405 --> 01:45:46.073
PEACE, HE ADDED THIS MESSAGE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE LOVE YOU, YOU ARE VERY 

01:45:46.234 --> 01:45:50.610
SPECIAL. DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS 
OF THE SENATE, THIS IS A DAY 

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:57.557
THAT WILL LIVE IN DISGRACE IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY, THAT IS UNLESS

01:45:57.748 --> 01:46:02.235
YOU ASK DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE 
THIS IS WHAT HE TWEETED BEFORE 

01:46:02.446 --> 01:46:04.446
HE WENT TO BED. AT 6:01 P.M.

01:46:11.483 --> 01:46:14.596
, NOT CONSOLING THE NATION, NOT 
REASSURING EVERYONE THAT THE 

01:46:15.353 --> 01:46:19.328
GOVERNMENT WAS SECURE, NOT A 
SINGLE WORD THAT ENTIRE DAY 

01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:24.493
CONDEMNING THE VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION. THAT IS WHAT HE 

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:27.159
SAYS. THESE ARE THE THINGS AND 
EVENTS THAT HAPPEN WHEN A SACRED

01:46:27.362 --> 01:46:30.248
LANDSLIDE ELECTION VICTORY IS SO
UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND VICIOUSLY 

01:46:30.665 --> 01:46:33.953
STRIPPED AWAY FROM GREAT 
PATRIOTS WHO HAVE BEEN BADLY AND

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:37.651
UNFAIRLY TREATED FOR SO LONG. GO
HOME WITH LOVE AND PEACE, 

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:44.170
REMEMBER THIS DAY FOREVER. THESE
ARE THE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT 

01:46:44.351 --> 01:46:47.296
HAPPEN WHEN A SACRED LANDSLIDE 
ELECTION VICTORY IS SO 

01:46:47.503 --> 01:46:52.417
UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND VICIOUSLY 
STRIPPED AWAY FROM GREAT 

01:46:52.617 --> 01:46:54.617
PATRIOTS. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS 
WAS ALL PERFECTLY NATURAL AND 

01:46:54.686 --> 01:46:56.686
FORESEEABLE TO DONALD TRUMP

01:47:02.665 --> 01:47:05.386
. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY, 
HE TOLD YOU IT WAS COMING. AT 

01:47:05.573 --> 01:47:08.267
THE END OF THE DAY, HE SAID THIS
WOULD HAPPEN AND THEN HE ADDS, 

01:47:08.472 --> 01:47:10.735
REMEMBER THIS DAY FOREVER, BUT 
NOT AS A DAY OF DISGRACE AND 

01:47:10.942 --> 01:47:14.138
HORROR AND TRAUMA, AS THE REST 
OF US REMEMBER IT, BUT AS A DAY 

01:47:14.279 --> 01:47:18.527
OF CELEBRATION, A DAY OF 
COMMEMORATION. IF WE LET IT BE, 

01:47:18.742 --> 01:47:21.415
IT WILL BE A DAY OF 
CONTINUATION, A CALL TO ACTION 

01:47:21.606 --> 01:47:26.401
AND A RALLYING CRY FOR THE NEXT 
ROUND OF INSURRECTIONARY JUSTICE

01:47:26.725 --> 01:47:31.828
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS WAS TOTALLY 
APPROPRIATE. SENATORS, THE 

01:47:32.023 --> 01:47:38.375
STAKES OF THIS TRIAL COULD NOT 
BE MORE SERIOUS. EVERY AMERICAN 

01:47:38.574 --> 01:47:42.441
YOUNG AND OLD AND IN BETWEEN IS 
INVITED TO PARTICIPATE WITH US 

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.878
IN THE ESSENTIAL JOURNEY TO FIND
THE FACTS AND SHARE THE TRUTH.

01:47:49.412 --> 01:47:52.236
TRIALS OR PUBLIC EVENTS IN A 
DEMOCRACY AND NO TRIAL IS MY 

01:47:52.379 --> 01:47:54.379
SIGNIFICANT THEN A IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL.

01:47:58.493 --> 01:48:00.125
BECAUSE THE INSURRECTION BROUGHT
SHOCKING VIOLENCE, BLOODSHED AND

01:48:00.126 --> 01:48:03.415
PAIN IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL, WE
WILL BE SHOWING RELEVANT CLIPS 

01:48:03.618 --> 01:48:06.016
OF THE MONTH ATTACK ON POLICE 
OFFICERS AND OTHER INNOCENT 

01:48:06.157 --> 01:48:08.943
PEOPLE. WE URGE PARENTS AND 
TEACHERS TO EXERCISE CLOSE 

01:48:09.161 --> 01:48:15.706
REVIEW OF WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
WATCHING HERE AND PLEASE LET 

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:18.566
ALONG WITH THEM IF YOU ARE 
ALLOWING THEM TO WATCH. THE 

01:48:18.779 --> 01:48:21.461
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WILL TRY TO
THE WARNINGS THE FOR THE MOST 

01:48:21.642 --> 01:48:25.313
GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING VIOLENCE 
THAT TOOK PLACE. WE BELIEVE THAT

01:48:26.068 --> 01:48:30.600
THE MANAGERS METICULOUS 
PRESENTATION WILL LEAD TO ONE 

01:48:30.801 --> 01:48:32.801
POWERFUL AND IRRESISTIBLE 
CONCLUSION

01:48:36.317 --> 01:48:38.151
, DONALD TRUMP COMMITTED A 
MASSIVE CRIME AGAINST OUR 

01:48:38.152 --> 01:48:40.789
CONSTITUTION AND OUR PEOPLE AND 
THE WORST VIOLATION OF THE 

01:48:40.998 --> 01:48:44.287
PRESIDENTIAL OATH OF OFFICE IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES

01:48:44.491 --> 01:48:46.753
OF AMERICA. FOR THIS, HE WAS 
IMPEACHED BY THE HOUSE OF 

01:48:46.972 --> 01:48:50.671
REPRESENTATIVES  AND HE MUST BE 
CONVICTED BY THE UNITED STATES 

01:48:51.407 --> 01:48:54.582
SENATE. BEFORE I CLOSE, I WANT 
TO ADDRESS A CONSTITUTIONAL 

01:48:55.339 --> 01:48:57.513
ISSUE  LINGERING FROM 
YESTERDAY'S ARGUMENT.

01:49:01.521 --> 01:49:03.521
THE PRESIDENT, OBVIOUSLY, IS 
EXPLORING WAYS

01:49:07.246 --> 01:49:09.327
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND TALK 
ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN HAS 

01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:11.352
RESPONSIBILITY FOR INCITING 
ANTI-. WE HURT A LOT YESTERDAY 

01:49:11.353 --> 01:49:14.035
ABOUT HIS CLAIM THAT WAS IN 
FRONT OF THE INSURRECTION WAS 

01:49:14.439 --> 01:49:16.439
PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT
WAS SOMEHOW PROTECTED BY THE 

01:49:16.849 --> 01:49:20.206
FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE FIBERS 
CAUGHT MY EYE BECAUSE I HAVE 

01:49:20.410 --> 01:49:23.406
BEEN A PROFESSOR OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL LOT  IN DECADES.

01:49:28.013 --> 01:49:29.853
THE FACTUAL PREMISE AND THE 
LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THAT 

01:49:29.854 --> 01:49:32.018
CLAIM ARE ALL WRONG. THEY 
PRESENT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:34.165
AS

01:49:35.964 --> 01:49:38.204
MERELY LIKE A GUY AT A RALLY 
EXPRESSING POLITICAL OPINION 

01:49:38.408 --> 01:49:41.066
THAT WE DISAGREE WITH AND NOW WE
ARE TRYING TO PUT HIM IN JAIL 

01:49:41.287 --> 01:49:43.547
FOR IT. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO 
WITH THE REALITY OF THESE 

01:49:43.749 --> 01:49:45.749
CHARGES OR HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 
OFFENSE.  THE PARTICULAR 

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.664
POLITICAL OPINIONS BEING 
EXPRESSED ARE NOT WHY WE IMPEACH

01:49:50.423 --> 01:49:53.627
THE PRESIDENT AND HAVE NOTHING 
TO DO WITH IT. IT MAKES A 

01:49:53.819 --> 01:49:57.091
DIFFERENCE WHAT THE IDEOLOGICAL 
CONTENT OF THE MOB WAS. IF WE 

01:49:57.704 --> 01:50:00.947
FORGIVE INCITEMENT TO VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION BY MILITANT TRUMP 

01:50:01.084 --> 01:50:06.367
FOLLOWERS THIS WEEK, YOU CAN BE 
SURE THERE WILL BE A BUNCH OF 

01:50:06.571 --> 01:50:08.571
NEW IDEOLOGICAL FLAVORS COMING 
SOON.

01:50:11.459 --> 01:50:12.703
AS WE DEMONSTRATE WITH 
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE, 

01:50:12.704 --> 01:50:15.152
PORTRAYING TRUMP AS A GUY ON THE
STREET BEING PUNISHED FOR HIS 

01:50:15.365 --> 01:50:19.692
IDEAS IS A FALSE DESCRIPTION OF 
HIS ACTIONS, HIS INTENT AND THE 

01:50:19.893 --> 01:50:22.653
ROLE THAT HE PLAYED ON AND WE 
FIXED WHEN HE WILLFULLY INFECTED

01:50:23.978 --> 01:50:29.530
AN INSURRECTIONARY MOB TO WRITE 
UP THE CAPITAL. LAST WEEK, 144 

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:33.153
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS, 
INCLUDING FLOYD ABRAMS, A 

01:50:33.295 --> 01:50:37.056
FEROCIOUS DEFENDER OF FREE 
SPEECH, CHARLES FRIEDE, 

01:50:37.194 --> 01:50:40.988
PRESIDENT REAGAN SOLICITOR 
GENERAL, STEPHEN CALABRESE, THE 

01:50:41.193 --> 01:50:45.283
COFOUNDER OF THE FEDERALIST 
SOCIETY, RELEASED A STATEMENT 

01:50:45.484 --> 01:50:48.991
CALLING THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST 
AMENDMENT ARGUMENT FRIVOLOUS, 

01:50:49.743 --> 01:50:53.124
LEGALLY FRIVOLOUS, ADDING WE ALL
AGREE THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT 

01:50:53.325 --> 01:50:55.964
DOES NOT PREVENT THE SENATE FROM
CONVICTING PRESIDENT DONALD 

01:50:56.151 --> 01:51:02.078
TRUMP AND DISQUALIFYING HIM FROM
HOLDING FUTURE OFFICE. THEY WENT

01:51:02.214 --> 01:51:05.433
ON TO SAY NO REASONABLE SCHOLAR 
OR JURISTS CONCLUDE THAT 

01:51:05.637 --> 01:51:09.338
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD A 
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO INCITE 

01:51:09.539 --> 01:51:15.855
A VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE SEAT OF 
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR SIT 

01:51:16.055 --> 01:51:18.513
BACK AND WATCH ON TELEVISION AS 
CONGRESS WAS TERRORIZED IN THE 

01:51:19.281 --> 01:51:25.443
CAPITOL.  INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE
IS OF COURSE NOT PROTECTED BY 

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:27.645
THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THAT IS WHY
MOST AMERICANS HAVE DISMISSED 

01:51:27.892 --> 01:51:32.383
DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST AMENDMENT 
RHETORIC SIMPLY BY REFERRING TO 

01:51:33.144 --> 01:51:39.521
WENDELL HOLMES' CANDY PHRASE "
YOU CANNOT SHOOT FIRE IN A 

01:51:40.277 --> 01:51:43.205
CROWDED THEATER." EVEN THAT 
PRINCIPLE DOES NOT BEGIN TO 

01:51:43.428 --> 01:51:46.404
CAPTURE HOW OFF-BASE THE 
ARGUMENT IS. THIS IS MUCH WORSE

01:51:50.381 --> 01:51:52.603
THAN SOMEONE WHO SHOUTS FIRE IN 
A CROWDED THEATER. THIS IS A 

01:51:52.804 --> 01:51:56.273
CASE WHERE THE FIRE CHIEF WHO IS
PAID TO PUT OUT FIRES SUNDAY MOB

01:51:56.474 --> 01:52:01.368
NOT TO YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED 
THEATER BUT TO SET THE THEATER 

01:52:02.137 --> 01:52:07.788
ON FIRE. WHEN THE FIRE ALARMS GO
OFF AND THE CALLS START FLOODING

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.065
INTO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ASKING
FOR HELP, DOES NOTHING BUT SIT 

01:52:11.285 --> 01:52:15.362
BACK, ENCOURAGE THE MOB TO 
CONTINUE ITS RAMPAGE AND WATCH 

01:52:15.577 --> 01:52:22.679
THE FIRE SPREAD ON TV WITH GLEE 
AND THE LIGHT. WE SAY THIS FIRE 

01:52:22.824 --> 01:52:26.646
CHIEF SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO 
HOLD THIS PUBLIC JOB AGAIN AND 

01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:29.710
YOU ARE FIRED AND PERMANENTLY 
DISQUALIFIED, AND HE OBJECTS, 

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:34.490
AND HE SAYS WE ARE VIOLATING HIS
FREE-SPEECH RIGHTS JUST BECAUSE

01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:42.347
HE IS PRO MOD OR PRO FIRE OR 
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. COME ON. 

01:52:42.769 --> 01:52:45.239
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO LAW 
SCHOOL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 

01:52:45.450 --> 01:52:49.569
WRONG WITH THAT ARGUMENT. HERE 
IS THE KEY, UNDOUBTEDLY, A 

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:52.623
PRIVATE PERSON CAN RUN AROUND ON
THE STREET EXPRESSING HIS OR HER

01:52:52.837 --> 01:52:57.159
SUPPORT FOR ENEMIES OF THE 
UNITED DATES AND ADVOCATING THE 

01:52:57.363 --> 01:53:00.206
OVERTHROW OF THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO 

01:53:00.404 --> 01:53:04.727
DO THAT UNDER THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT BUT IF THE PRESIDENT 

01:53:04.941 --> 01:53:07.226
SPENT ALL OF HIS DAYS DOING THAT
ENTERING THE EXACT SAME WORDS, 

01:53:07.626 --> 01:53:09.626
EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE 
ENEMIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND

01:53:09.684 --> 01:53:13.173
OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT, IS 
THERE ANYONE HERE WHO DOUBT THAT

01:53:13.372 --> 01:53:15.843
THIS WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF HIS
OATH OF OFFICE TO PRESERVE, 

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:20.044
PROTECT AND PROTECT THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 

01:53:20.190 --> 01:53:23.348
STATES AND THAT HE OR SHE COULD 
BE IMPEACHED FOR DOING THAT?

01:53:28.543 --> 01:53:30.819
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, YOU HAVE CHOSEN A SIDE 

01:53:31.022 --> 01:53:33.477
OF THE OATH OF OFFICE AND IF YOU
BREAK THAT, WE CAN IMPEACH, 

01:53:33.691 --> 01:53:35.337
REMOVE AND DISQUALIFY YOU 
PERMANENTLY FROM HOLDING ANY 

01:53:35.338 --> 01:53:39.209
OFFICE UNDER THE UNITED STATES. 
AS JUSTICE SCALIA ONCE SAID, 

01:53:39.435 --> 01:53:44.032
MEMORABLY, YOU CANNOT RIDE WITH 
THE COPS AND ROOT FOR THE 

01:53:44.251 --> 01:53:52.088
ROBBERS. IF YOU BECOME IN SITU 
IN CHIEF TO THE INSURRECTION, 

01:53:52.507 --> 01:53:54.754
YOU CANNOT EXPECT TO BE ON THE 
PAYROLL AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF 

01:53:54.957 --> 01:53:59.668
FOR THE UNION. TRUMP WAS THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

01:53:59.867 --> 01:54:03.385
AND HE HAD SWORN TO PRESERVE, 
PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION. HE HAD

01:54:04.155 --> 01:54:08.717
A AFFIRMATIVE BINDING DUTY, ONE 
THAT SET HIM APART FROM EVERYONE

01:54:08.923 --> 01:54:12.560
ELSE IN THE COUNTRY TO TAKE CARE
THAT THE LAWS BE FAITHFULLY 

01:54:12.714 --> 01:54:14.714
EXECUTED.

01:54:17.749 --> 01:54:19.407
INCLUDING ALL THE LAWS AGAINST 
ASSAULTING FEDERAL OFFICERS, 

01:54:19.408 --> 01:54:21.070
DESTROYING FEDERAL PROPERTY, THE
ONLY THREATENING MEMBERS OF 

01:54:21.071 --> 01:54:24.572
CONGRESS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT 
INTERFERING WITH FEDERAL 

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:26.832
ELECTIONS AND DOZENS OF OTHER 
FEDERAL LAWS THAT ARE WELL KNOWN

01:54:27.041 --> 01:54:30.961
TO ALL OF YOU. WHEN HE INVITED 
INSURRECTION ON JANUARY 6, HE 

01:54:31.166 --> 01:54:36.480
BROKE THAT OATH. HE VIOLATED 
THAT DUTY. THAT IS WHY WE ARE 

01:54:36.622 --> 01:54:39.345
HERE TODAY. THAT IS WHY HE HAS 
NO CREDIBLE CONSTITUTIONAL 

01:54:40.067 --> 01:54:48.698
DEFENSE. I WILL TELL YOU A FINAL
SAD STORY IN THIS KALEIDOSCOPE 

01:54:48.899 --> 01:54:50.899
OF SADNESS AND TERROR AND 
VIOLENCE. ONE OF OUR CAPITOL 

01:54:51.488 --> 01:54:53.488
OFFICERS 

01:54:55.645 --> 01:54:58.090
WHO DEFENDED US THAT DAY WAS A 
LONGTIME VETERAN OF OUR FORCE, A

01:54:58.308 --> 01:55:00.780
BRAVE AND HONORABLE PUBLIC 
SERVANT WHO SPENT SEVERAL HOURS 

01:55:01.187 --> 01:55:04.457
BATTLING THE MOB AS PART OF ONE 
OF THOSE BLUE LINES DESCENDING 

01:55:04.676 --> 01:55:06.676
THE CAPITAL IN OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:55:09.752 --> 01:55:12.203
FOR SEVERAL HOURS STRAIGHT, AS 
THE MARAUDERS PUNCHED AND KICKED

01:55:12.817 --> 01:55:18.759
AND MULLED AND SPIT UPON AND HIT
OFFICERS WITH BASEBALL BATS AND 

01:55:18.963 --> 01:55:20.991
FIRE EXTINGUISHERS, CURSED THE 
COPS AND STORMED OUR CAPITOL, HE

01:55:21.208 --> 01:55:26.317
DEFENDED US  AND HE LIVED EVERY 
MINUTE OF HIS OATH OF OFFICE. 

01:55:27.295 --> 01:55:33.607
AFTERWARDS, OVERWHELMED BY 
EMOTION, HE BROKE DOWN IN THE 

01:55:33.762 --> 01:55:40.337
ROTUNDA. HE CRIED FOR 15 
MINUTES. HE SHOUTED OUT, "

01:55:42.089 --> 01:55:45.929
CALLED A LETTER AND WORD 15 
TIMES TODAY."

01:55:49.456 --> 01:55:51.943
THEN HE RECORDED I SAT DOWN WITH
ONE OF MY BUDDIES, ANOTHER BLACK

01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:55.851
GUY IN TEARS STARTED STREAMING 
DOWN MY FACE AND I SAID, WHAT 

01:55:56.630 --> 01:56:00.223
THE F, MEN. IS THIS AMERICA?

01:56:05.259 --> 01:56:08.254
THAT IS THE QUESTION BEFORE ALL 
OF YOU IN THIS TRIAL, IS THIS 

01:56:08.401 --> 01:56:13.660
AMERICA? IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR 
DEMOCRACY EVER BE THE SAME IF WE

01:56:13.878 --> 01:56:15.743
DO NOT HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE 
PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING 

01:56:15.744 --> 01:56:20.049
THE VIOLENT ATTACK AGAINST OUR 
COUNTRY, OUR CAPITAL AND 

01:56:20.454 --> 01:56:24.354
DEMOCRACY AND ALL OF THOSE WHO 
SERVE US SO FAITHFULLY AND 

01:56:24.556 --> 01:56:26.556
HONORABLY, IS THIS AMERICA?

01:56:32.788 --> 01:56:39.064
MR. NANDU'S WILL NOW PROVIDE A 
ROADMAP OF OUR EVIDENTIARY CASE.

01:57:12.096 --> 01:57:18.081
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED 
SENATORS, COUNSEL, LIKE SEVERAL 

01:57:18.858 --> 01:57:24.805
OF YOU, I AM A CHILD OF 
IMMIGRANTS. AS A SON OF 

01:57:24.944 --> 01:57:31.095
IMMIGRANTS, I BELIEVE, FIRMLY IN
MY HEART, THAT THE UNITED STATES

01:57:31.297 --> 01:57:38.246
IS THE GREATEST REPUBLIC THAT 
THIS WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. A 

01:57:38.463 --> 01:57:42.842
HALLMARK OF OUR REPUBLIC SINCE 
THE DAYS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 

01:57:43.049 --> 01:57:48.999
HAS BEEN THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER 
OF POWER. FOR CENTURIES, WE HAVE

01:57:49.753 --> 01:57:56.405
ACCEPTED THIS AS FACT. 
UNFORTUNATELY, SADLY, WE 

01:57:57.234 --> 01:58:02.284
NOW THAT WE CAN NO LONGER TAKE 
THAT FOR GRANTED BECAUSE AS LEAD

01:58:02.419 --> 01:58:06.271
MANAGER RASKIN EXPLAINED ON 
JANUARY 6, THE PEACEFUL 

01:58:07.044 --> 01:58:11.255
TRANSITION OF POWER WAS 
VIOLENTLY INTERRUPTED WHEN A MOB

01:58:11.767 --> 01:58:18.380
STORMED THIS CAPITAL AND 
DESECRATED THIS CHAMBER. AS YOU 

01:58:18.583 --> 01:58:21.668
WILL SEE DURING THE COURSE OF 
THIS TRIAL, THAT MOB WAS 

01:58:22.090 --> 01:58:27.008
SUMMONED, ASSEMBLED AND INCITED 
BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE 

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:32.353
UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP. HE 
DID THAT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO 

01:58:32.556 --> 01:58:37.098
STOP THE TRANSFER OF POWER SO 
THAT HE COULD RETAIN POWER, EVEN

01:58:37.313 --> 01:58:46.726
THOUGH HE HAD LOST THE ELECTION.
WHEN THE VIOLENCE ERUPTED, THEY 

01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:52.970
WERE HERE IN OUR BUILDING WITH 
WEAPONS, HE DID NOTHING TO STOP 

01:58:53.124 --> 01:59:00.815
IT. IF WE ARE TO PROTECT OUR 
REPUBLIC AND PREVENT SOMETHING 

01:59:01.017 --> 01:59:08.301
LIKE THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING 
AGAIN, HE MUST BE CONVICTED. I 

01:59:08.497 --> 01:59:11.782
WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT
WE WILL SHOW YOU DURING THE 

01:59:11.993 --> 01:59:16.075
COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. AS MY 
FELLOW MANAGERS PRESENT OUR CASE

01:59:16.832 --> 01:59:23.222
TO YOU TODAY, TONIGHT, TOMORROW,
IT WILL BE HELPFUL TO THINK 

01:59:23.424 --> 01:59:27.343
ABOUT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION IN 

01:59:27.504 --> 01:59:32.618
THREE DISTINCT PARTS. THE 
ATTACK, THE PROVOCATION, THE 

01:59:32.763 --> 01:59:41.053
ATTACK, AND THE HARM. LET'S 
START WITH THE PROVOCATION. WE 

01:59:41.252 --> 01:59:44.275
WILL SHOW, DURING THE COURSE OF 
THIS TRIAL, THAT THIS ATTACK WAS

01:59:44.453 --> 01:59:51.302
PROVOKED BY THE PRESIDENT, 
INCITED BY THE PRESIDENT. AS A 

01:59:51.505 --> 01:59:55.591
RESULT, IT WAS PREDICTABLE AND 
IT WAS FORESEEABLE. OF COURSE 

01:59:55.991 --> 02:00:01.497
THAT MAKES SENSE. THIS MOB WAS 
WELL ORCHESTRATED, THEIR CONDUCT

02:00:02.106 --> 02:00:05.409
WAS INTENTIONAL, THEY DID IT ALL
IN PLAIN SIGHT, PROBABLY, 

02:00:06.370 --> 02:00:13.628
OPENLY, AND LOUDLY. THEY 
BELIEVED, THEY TRULY BELIEVED 

02:00:14.035 --> 02:00:19.160
THAT THEY WERE DOING THIS FOR 
HIM, THAT THIS WAS THEIR 

02:00:19.919 --> 02:00:26.555
PATRIOTIC DUTY. THEY EVEN 
PREDICTED THAT HE WOULD PROTECT 

02:00:27.309 --> 02:00:34.590
THEM. FOR THE MOST PART, THEY 
WERE RIGHT, IN HIS UNIQUE ROLE 

02:00:34.794 --> 02:00:38.097
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF OUR 
COUNTRY, AND AS THE ONE PERSON 

02:00:38.315 --> 02:00:41.491
THAT THE MOB WAS LISTENING TO 
AND FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM

02:00:44.688 --> 02:00:51.452
, HE HAD THE POWER TO STOP IT, 
AND HE DID NOT. 

02:00:55.937 --> 02:00:59.412
SOME HAVE SAID THAT PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP'S REMARKS SPEECH ON

02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:05.304
JANUARY 6th WAS JUST A SPEECH. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHEN IN OUR

02:01:05.442 --> 02:01:11.093
HISTORY HAS A SPEECH LED 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO STORM OUR

02:01:11.295 --> 02:01:18.372
NATIONS CAPITOL  WITH WEAPONS? 
SCALING THE WALLS AND BREAK 

02:01:18.526 --> 02:01:26.363
WINDOWS, KILL A CAPITOL POLICE 
OFFICER ? THIS WAS NOT JUST A 

02:01:26.504 --> 02:01:28.504
SPEECH

02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:34.574
, IT DID NOT JUST HAPPEN. AS YOU
EVALUATE THE FACTS THAT WE 

02:01:34.717 --> 02:01:40.972
PRESENT TO YOU, IT WILL BECOME 
CLEAR 

02:01:42.972 --> 02:01:47.310
CAME FROM. HERE IS THE THING, 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS, 

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:52.370
AS YOU WILL SEE, ON JANUARY 6th,
AND THAT SPEECH, JUST LIKE THE 

02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:56.537
MOBS ACTIONS WERE NOT CAREFULLY 
CHOSEN, THOSE WORDS HAVE A 

02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:02.309
SPECIFIC MEANING TO THAT CROWD 
AND HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? WE KNOW

02:02:02.521 --> 02:02:06.198
THIS BECAUSE IN THE WEEKS PRIOR 
TO, DURING, AND AFTER THE 

02:02:06.401 --> 02:02:14.204
ELECTION, HE USED THE SAME WORDS
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:20.155
YOU WILL HEAR, OVER AND OVER, 
THREE THINGS, YOU CAN SEE THEM 

02:02:20.354 --> 02:02:25.989
ON THE SCREENS. FIRST, WHAT LEAD
MANAGER RASKIN REFERRED TO AS

02:02:30.423 --> 02:02:35.125
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN, FULL OF
FRAUD, RIGGED. YOU WILL HEAR, 

02:02:35.343 --> 02:02:40.473
OVER AND OVER, HIM USING THAT 
LIKE TO URGE HIS SUPPORTERS TO 

02:02:40.693 --> 02:02:45.823
NEVER CONCEDE AND STOP THE 
STEEL. FINALLY, YOU WILL HEAR 

02:02:46.232 --> 02:02:51.340
THE CALL TWO ARMS THAT IT WAS 
HIS SUPPORTERS PATRIOTIC DUTY TO

02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:54.109
FIGHT LIKE

02:02:56.291 --> 02:03:04.079
HELL TO DO WHAT, TO STOP THE 
STEEL, TO STOP THE ELECTION FROM

02:03:04.294 --> 02:03:08.625
BEING STOLEN BY SHOWING UP IN 
THIS CHAMBER, TO STOP YOU, TO 

02:03:09.382 --> 02:03:15.799
STOP US. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT
YOU REMEMBER THOSE THREE PHRASES

02:03:16.017 --> 02:03:20.918
AS YOU CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE 
TODAY. ELECTION WAS STOLEN, STOP

02:03:21.117 --> 02:03:24.015
THE STEAL , AND FIGHT LIKE HELL

02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:30.522
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT JUST APPEAR
ON JANUARY 6th. LET ME SHOW YOU 

02:03:30.739 --> 02:03:35.444
WHAT I MEAN. LET'S START WITH 
THE BIG LIE. YOU WILL SEE, 

02:03:35.657 --> 02:03:38.660
DURING THIS TRIAL, THAT THE 
PRESENT REALIZED REALLY BY LAST 

02:03:38.807 --> 02:03:43.468
SPRING THAT HE COULD LOSE, HE 
MIGHT LOSE THE ELECTION. WHAT 

02:03:43.672 --> 02:03:47.952
DID HE DO? HE STARTED PLANTING 
THE SEEDS TO GET SOME OF HIS 

02:03:48.717 --> 02:03:54.057
SUPPORTERS READY BY SAYING THAT 
HE COULD LOSE THE ELECTION IF IT

02:03:54.827 --> 02:04:00.640
WAS STOLEN. IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT
HE DID WAS CREATE A LOOSE 

02:04:01.061 --> 02:04:05.962
SCENARIO, EITHER HE WON THE 
ELECTION, OR HE WOULD HAVE SOME 

02:04:06.166 --> 02:04:12.083
ANGRY SUPPORTERS, NOT ALL, BUT 
SOME WHO BELIEVED THAT IF HE 

02:04:12.225 --> 02:04:19.370
LOST, THE ELECTION HAD TO BE 
RIGGED AND THEY WOULD BE ANGRY

02:04:22.383 --> 02:04:28.471
. HE WAS TELLING AMERICANS THAT 
THEIR VOTE WAS STOLEN. IN 

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:36.048
AMERICA, OUR VOTE IS OUR VOICE. 
HIS FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT ELECTION 

02:04:36.186 --> 02:04:41.972
FRAUD, THAT WAS THE DRUMBEAT 
BEING USED TO INSPIRE, INSTIGATE

02:04:44.108 --> 02:04:51.641
, AND IGNITE THEM, TO ANGER THEM
. WATCH THIS CLIP.

02:04:53.946 --> 02:04:58.265
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THIS 
ELECTION BE TAKEN AWAY FROM US. 

02:04:58.635 --> 02:05:01.736
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL 
WIN. WE WILL NOT LET THEM. IT'S 

02:05:01.934 --> 02:05:10.359
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN LOSE, IN MY 
OPINION, IS MASSIVE FRAUD. 

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:17.105
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
AFTER THAT, HE LOST. HE LOST THE

02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:23.529
ELECTION. BUT, REMEMBER HE HAD 
NO LOSE SCENARIO THAT I 

02:05:24.288 --> 02:05:28.838
REFERENCED EARLIER. HE TOLD HIS 
BASE THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

02:05:29.039 --> 02:05:35.204
STOLEN, AS HE HAD FORECASTED. 
THEN, HE TOLD THEM YOUR ELECTION

02:05:35.407 --> 02:05:38.281
HAS BEEN STOLEN, BUT YOU CANNOT 
CONCEDE, YOU MUST STOP THE 

02:05:39.037 --> 02:05:41.037
STEAL. 

02:05:42.825 --> 02:05:47.992
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CANNOT LET ANOTHER PERSON
STEAL THAT ELECTION FOR YOU. ALL

02:05:48.223 --> 02:05:53.500
OVER THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE 
TOGETHER IN HOLDING UP SIGNS 

02:05:54.468 --> 02:05:59.512
"TRAN19." THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
TRYING TO STEAL THE WHITE HOUSE.

02:06:00.042 --> 02:06:02.042
YOU CANNOT LET THEM, YOU CANNOT 
LET THEM.

02:06:06.857 --> 02:06:10.236
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE HE IS INCITING THE 
SUPPORTERS, HE IS SIMULTANEOUSLY

02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:16.904
DOING EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY CAN
TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. FIRST 

02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:21.391
HE BEGINS WITH THE COURTS, A 
LEGITIMATE AVENUE, LEGITIMATE 

02:06:21.527 --> 02:06:27.792
AVENUE TO CHALLENGE THE ELECTION
, BUT, HE IGNORES ALL OF THEIR 

02:06:28.554 --> 02:06:32.656
ADVERSE RULINGS WHEN ALL HAVE 
HIS CLAIMS ARE THROWN OUT. THEN,

02:06:36.012 --> 02:06:38.291
HE MOVES ON TO PRESSURE STATE 
ELECTION OFFICIALS TO BLOCK THE 

02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:41.373
ELECTION RESULTS FOR HIS 
OPPONENT, EVEN THOUGH HE LOST IN

02:06:42.135 --> 02:06:46.079
THEIR STATES. YOU WILL HEAR MY 
FELLOW MANAGERS DISCUSSED THAT 

02:06:46.834 --> 02:06:49.898
IN DETAIL. THEN HE TRIES TO 
THREATEN STATE ELECTION 

02:06:50.051 --> 02:06:52.806
OFFICIALS TO CHANGE THE VOTES, 
TO MAKE HIM THE WINNER, EVEN 

02:06:53.014 --> 02:06:58.674
THREATENING CRIMINAL PENALTIES 
IF THEY REFUSED. HE HAD THE 

02:06:58.808 --> 02:07:03.856
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATE 
HIS CLAIMS. EVEN THEY FOUND NO 

02:07:04.065 --> 02:07:11.022
SUPPORT FOR THOSE CLAIMS. HE 
TRIED TO PERSUADE SOME MEMBERS 

02:07:11.237 --> 02:07:13.310
OF HIS PARTY AND CONGRESS TO 
BLOCK THE CERTIFICATION OF HIS 

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:17.986
VOTE WITH ATTACKS AND PUBLIC 
FORUMS. WHEN THAT FAILED, HE 

02:07:18.122 --> 02:07:24.039
TRIED TO INTIMIDATE THE VICE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

02:07:24.792 --> 02:07:30.532
OF AMERICA TO REFUSED TO CERTIFY
THE VOTE AND SEND IT BACK TO THE

02:07:30.684 --> 02:07:37.909
STATES. NONE OF IT WORKED. SO 
WHAT DOES HE DO? WITH HIS BACK 

02:07:38.056 --> 02:07:42.567
AGAINST THE WALL, WHEN ALL ELSE 
HAS FAILED, HE TURNS BACK

02:07:46.704 --> 02:07:49.767
TO HIS SUPPORTERS WHO HE ALREADY
SPENT MONTHS TELLING THEM THAT 

02:07:49.973 --> 02:07:54.405
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN, AND HE 
AMPLIFIED AN

02:07:59.008 --> 02:08:01.471
FURTHER, HE AND THE IT UP A 
NOTCH. HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY 

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:04.156
HAD TO BE READY NOT TO JUST 
"STOP THE STEAL"  HELLBUT TO  

02:08:04.711 --> 02:08:06.711
FIGHT LIKE

02:08:09.185 --> 02:08:11.185
HELL

02:08:13.626 --> 02:08:15.070
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER, WE 

02:08:15.071 --> 02:08:20.809
WILL ONLY WHEN. NOW IS NOT THE 
TIME TO RETREAT, NOW IS THE TIME

02:08:21.023 --> 02:08:23.252
TO FIGHT HARDER THAN EVER 
BEFORE. WE HAVE TO GO ALL THE 

02:08:23.456 --> 02:08:26.662
WAY AND LOOK AT THEM FIGHT LIKE 
HELL

02:08:31.656 --> 02:08:34.508
. WE WILL NOT FIGHT WE WILL NOT 
BREAK, WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP, WE

02:08:34.704 --> 02:08:39.162
WILL NEVER BACK DOWN, WE WILL 
NEVER EVER SURRENDER. 

02:08:39.163 --> 02:08:46.079
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WILL SEE THAT IN THE 
MONTHS THE PRESIDENT

02:08:48.857 --> 02:08:53.771
STATEMENTS, PEOPLE LISTENED, 
ARMED SUPPORTERS SURROUNDED 

02:08:54.524 --> 02:08:56.586
ELECTION OFFICIALS HOMES.

02:09:00.116 --> 02:09:02.116
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, FOR 
GEORGIA, THAT DEATH THREATS. 

02:09:02.711 --> 02:09:06.416
OFFICIALS WARNED THE PRESIDENT 
THAT HIS RHETORIC WAS DANGEROUS 

02:09:06.610 --> 02:09:10.981
AND IT WAS GOING TO RESULT IN 
DEADLY VIOLENCE. THAT IS WHAT 

02:09:11.188 --> 02:09:15.922
MAKES THIS SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE 
WHEN HE SAW, FIRST-HAND HAND, 

02:09:16.126 --> 02:09:20.535
THE VIOLENCE THAT HIS CONDUCT 
WAS CREATING, HE DID NOT STOP IT

02:09:21.217 --> 02:09:26.228
. HE COULD NOT CONDEMN THE 
VIOLENCE, HE INVITED IT FURTHER.

02:09:26.941 --> 02:09:33.081
HE GOT MORE SPECIFIC. HE DID NOT
JUST TELL THEM TO FIGHT LIKE 

02:09:33.838 --> 02:09:40.107
HELL, HE TOLD THEM WHERE AND 
WHEN. HE MADE SURE HE HAD 18 

02:09:40.279 --> 02:09:45.602
DAYS ADVANCED NOTICE. HE SENT 
HIS SAVE THE DATE FOR JANUARY 

02:09:45.746 --> 02:09:50.932
6th. HE TOLD THEM TO MARCH TO 
THE CAPITOL AND  FIGHT LIKE HELL

02:09:52.606 --> 02:09:54.606
.

02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:58.623
AS RASKIN SAID THE SAME DAY WE 
WERE CERTIFYING THE ELECTION 

02:09:58.825 --> 02:10:03.967
RESULTS, WHAT TIME WAS THAT 
RALLY SCHEDULED FOR? THE EXACT 

02:10:04.176 --> 02:10:10.352
SAME TIME THAT THIS CHAMBER WAS 
CERTIFYING THE ELECTION RESULTS 

02:10:10.757 --> 02:10:13.651
IN JOINT SESSION. WHEN DID HE 
CONCLUDE HIS SPEECH? LITERALLY 

02:10:14.407 --> 02:10:19.322
MOMENTS BEFORE SPEAKER PELOSI 
HAD GAMBLED US INTO SESSION. 

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:24.506
MANY OF US WERE IN THE HOUSE 
DURING THAT JOINT SESSION OF 

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:29.425
CONGRESS. I WAS SITTING TWO ROWS
BEHIND LEADER SCHUMER AND LEADER

02:10:29.646 --> 02:10:33.728
McCONNELL. I REMEMBER IT 
VIVIDLY. AS WE WERE STANDING 

02:10:34.479 --> 02:10:38.433
THERE FULFILLING OUR SOLEMN OATH
TO THE CONSTITUTION, THE 

02:10:38.611 --> 02:10:43.403
PRESIDENT WAS FINISHING HIS 
SPEECH A COUPLE MILES AWAY. HOW 

02:10:43.615 --> 02:10:47.499
DID HE CONCLUDE THAT INFAMOUS 
SPEECH? WITH A FINAL CALL TO 

02:10:47.632 --> 02:10:55.271
ACTION, HE TOLD THEM TO MARCH 
DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE TO COME

02:10:55.411 --> 02:10:57.411
HERE

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:03.768
, THAT IT WAS THEIR PATRIOTIC 
DUTY BECAUSE THE ELECTION HAD 

02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.083
BEEN STOLEN. WHEN THEY HEARD HIS
SPEECH, THEY UNDERSTOOD HIS 

02:11:09.842 --> 02:11:13.699
WORDS AND WHAT THEY MEANT 
BECAUSE THEY HAD HEARD IT BEFORE

02:11:15.258 --> 02:11:20.445
. LET'S JUST TAKE A MINUTE AND 
REALLY LOOK AT HIS WORDS ON 

02:11:21.205 --> 02:11:24.169
JANUARY 6th AS HE SPOKE AT THE 
FIFTH AMERICA RALLY. REMEMBER, I

02:11:24.935 --> 02:11:29.688
TOLD YOU YOU WILL HEAR THREE 
PHASES, THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN,

02:11:29.887 --> 02:11:32.374
STOP THE STEAL AND  FIGHT LIKE 
HELL.  LET'S START WITH THE 

02:11:33.133 --> 02:11:35.133
FIRST PHRASE.

02:11:40.552 --> 02:11:44.784
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF US HERE TODAY DO NOT 
WANT TO SEE OUR ELECTION VICTORY

02:11:44.928 --> 02:11:52.264
STOLEN. SAPIR THEFT IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S. 

02:11:52.693 --> 02:11:54.965
MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS ELECTION 
WAS STOLEN FROM YOU, FROM ME AND

02:11:55.166 --> 02:11:58.870
FROM THE COUNTRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OF COURSE EACH OF YOU HEARD 

02:11:59.055 --> 02:12:04.174
THOSE WORDS BEFORE, SO HAD THE 
CROWD. THE PRESIDENT HAD SPENT 

02:12:04.328 --> 02:12:07.908
MONTHS TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS 
THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN, 

02:12:08.111 --> 02:12:13.279
AND HE USED THIS SPEECH TO 
INCITE THEM FURTHER, TO INFLAME 

02:12:14.035 --> 02:12:18.825
THEM TO STOP THE STEAL,  TO STOP
THE CERTIFICATION OF THE 

02:12:19.581 --> 02:12:21.581
ELECTION RESULTS.

02:12:23.743 --> 02:12:26.752
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP, WE 
WILL NEVER COMES. IT DOES NOT 

02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:33.204
HAPPEN. YOU DO NOT CONCEDE WHEN 
THERE IS THEFT INVOLVED. TO USE 

02:12:33.404 --> 02:12:35.853
A FAVORITE TERM THAT ALL OF YOU 
PEOPLE REALLY CAME UP WITH, WE 

02:12:36.071 --> 02:12:42.791
WILL STOP THE STEAL . WE MUST 
STOP THE STEAL . 

02:12:42.792 --> 02:12:50.603
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FINALLY, THE PRESIDENT USED 
THIS SPEECH AS A CALL TO ARMS. 

02:12:50.814 --> 02:12:57.375
IT WAS NOT RHETORICAL. SOME OF 
HIS SUPPORTERS HAD BEEN PRIMED 

02:12:57.582 --> 02:13:02.075
FOR THIS OVER MANY MONTHS. AS 
YOU WILL LEARN, DATED THE FOR 

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:08.032
THIS SPEECH, AS LEAD MANAGER 
RASKIN NOTED, THERE WERE VAST 

02:13:08.795 --> 02:13:14.598
REPORTS ACROSS ALL MEDIA OUTLETS
THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD 

02:13:15.383 --> 02:13:20.554
BE ARMED AND THAT WOULD BE 
VIOLENT. YOU WILL LEARN THAT 

02:13:20.774 --> 02:13:23.464
CAPITOL POLICE AND THE FBI  
REPORTED IN THE DAYS LEADING UP 

02:13:23.663 --> 02:13:29.835
TO THE ATTACK THAT THOUSANDS AND
THE CROWD WOULD BE TARGETING THE

02:13:30.036 --> 02:13:32.036
CAPITOL SPECIFICALLY, THAT THEY 
HAD ARRESTED PEOPLE WITH  GUNS 

02:13:32.087 --> 02:13:37.432
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ATTACK ON 
WEAPONS CHARGES. THIS IS WHAT 

02:13:38.190 --> 02:13:44.349
OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SAID TO 
THE CROWD IN THE FACE OF THOSE 

02:13:44.499 --> 02:13:47.935
WARNINGS RIGHT BEFORE THEY CAME 
HERE. 

02:13:47.936 --> 02:13:52.840
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL NOT LET THEM SILENT 
YOUR VOICES. WE WILL NOT LET 

02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:57.055
THAT HAPPEN. NOT GOING TO LET 
THAT HAPPEN.

02:14:07.989 --> 02:14:15.683
THANK YOU. YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR 
PEOPLE TO FIGHT BECAUSE YOU WILL

02:14:15.888 --> 02:14:19.378
NEVER TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY WITH
WEAKNESS, YOU HAVE TO SHOW 

02:14:19.586 --> 02:14:22.338
STRENGTH AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
STRONG. WE FIGHT, WE

02:14:26.769 --> 02:14:29.017
FIGHT LIKE HELL. IF YOU DON'T 
FIGHT LIKE HELL, YOU WILL NOT 

02:14:29.232 --> 02:14:35.154
HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PEOPLE 

02:14:35.943 --> 02:14:41.762
TO FIGHT, HE TOLD THEM. 
SENATORS, THIS CLEARLY WAS NOT 

02:14:41.970 --> 02:14:48.743
JUST ONE SPEECH, IT DID NOT JUST
HAPPEN. IT WAS PART OF A 

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:53.613
CAREFULLY PLANNED MONTH-LONG 
EFFORT WITH A VERY SPECIFIC IN 

02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.413
STRUCTURE, SHOW UP ON JANUARY 6 
AND GET YOUR PEOPLE TO FIGHT THE

02:15:00.547 --> 02:15:10.310
CERTIFICATION. HE INCITED IT. IT
WAS FORESEEABLE. AGAIN, 

02:15:10.708 --> 02:15:15.400
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD 
FOR IT. BE PRESIDENT'S FORMER 

02:15:15.615 --> 02:15:20.444
CHIEF OF STAFF, THE RETIRED 
MARINE, FOUR-STAR GENERAL, WAS 

02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:25.049
CONFIRMED BY THIS MONEY TO THE 
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

02:15:25.646 --> 02:15:29.694
OVERWHELMING VOTE. BATMAN WAS 
JOHN KELLY. ON THE DAY AFTER THE

02:15:29.838 --> 02:15:37.306
INSURRECTION, HE SAID THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PRESIDENT KNOWS WHO HE IS

02:15:37.724 --> 02:15:40.813
TALKING TO WHEN HE TWEETS OR 
MAKES STATEMENTS. HE KNOWS WHO 

02:15:41.013 --> 02:15:49.189
HE IS TALKING TO. HE KNOWS WHAT 
HE WANTS THEM TO DO. THE FACT HE

02:15:49.412 --> 02:15:51.671
HAS BEEN SAYING THE THINGS HE 
HAS BEEN SAYING SINCE THE 

02:15:51.874 --> 02:15:54.563
ELECTION, ENCOURAGING PEOPLE 
WHICH IS NO SURPRISE AT WHAT 

02:15:55.321 --> 02:16:01.932
HAPPENED YESTERDAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO SURPRISE, THINK ABOUT 

02:16:02.131 --> 02:16:06.463
THAT, NO SURPRISE. THE PRESIDENT
HAD EVERY REASON TO KNOW THAT 

02:16:06.665 --> 02:16:12.619
THIS WOULD HAPPEN. HE ASSEMBLED 
THE MOM, HE SUMMONED THE MOB AND

02:16:13.023 --> 02:16:18.979
HE INCITED THE MOB. HE KNEW WHEN
HE TOOK THAT PODIUM ON THAT 

02:16:19.699 --> 02:16:25.412
FATEFUL MORNING, THAT THOSE IN 
ATTENDANCE HAD HEARD HIS WORDS 

02:16:25.559 --> 02:16:31.184
AND THEY WERE WAITING FOR HIS 
ORDERS TO BEGIN FIGHTING. THAT 

02:16:31.386 --> 02:16:35.274
OF COURSE BRINGS ME MY FELLOW 
MANAGERS TO WHAT HAPPENED HERE 

02:16:35.478 --> 02:16:43.709
IN THIS BUILDING. AS LEAD 
MANAGER RASKIN STATED, MY 

02:16:43.923 --> 02:16:45.923
COLLEAGUES ARE GOING TO WALK 
THROUGH THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 

02:16:46.017 --> 02:16:49.156
SIXTH AND THE EVIDENCE IN VERY 
GREAT DETAIL. THEY ARE PAINFUL

02:16:52.598 --> 02:16:56.328
TO WATCH AND RECOUNT, I WILL NOT
REPEAT THE EVIDENCE NOW BUT I DO

02:16:56.524 --> 02:16:59.359
WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT ALSO
HAPPENED DURING THAT TERRIBLE 

02:16:59.502 --> 02:17:05.960
ATTACK. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, 
ONCE AGAIN, FAILED US. WHEN THE 

02:17:06.728 --> 02:17:08.728
VIOLENCE ERUPTED

02:17:10.688 --> 02:17:12.557
, WHEN WE AND THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS PROTECTING

02:17:12.558 --> 02:17:14.558
US, PROTECTING YOU WERE UNDER 
ATTACK

02:17:17.981 --> 02:17:20.040
AS EACH OF YOU WERE BEING 
EVACUATED FROM THIS CHAMBER FROM

02:17:20.242 --> 02:17:22.517
A VIOLENT MOB AS WE WERE BEING 
EVACUATED FROM THE HOUSE, HE 

02:17:22.718 --> 02:17:27.245
COULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY, AND 
FORCEFULLY, INTERVENED TO STOP 

02:17:27.447 --> 02:17:32.560
THE VIOLENCE. IT WAS HIS DUTY AS
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO STOP THE 

02:17:32.778 --> 02:17:35.734
VIOLENCE, AND HE, ALONE, HAD 
THAT POWER

02:17:41.436 --> 02:17:43.942
, NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS UNIQUE
ROLE OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF, BUT 

02:17:44.151 --> 02:17:49.696
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY 
WERE FOLLOWING HIS ORDERS. THEY 

02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.480
SAID SO.

02:17:55.655 --> 02:17:59.813
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT FT. DRUM, FIGHT FOR 
TRUMP, FIGHT FOR TRUMP!

02:18:04.562 --> 02:18:08.041
WE ARE GOING BY THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES! 

02:18:08.042 --> 02:18:10.316
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT I WAS FOLLOWING MY 
PRESIDENT AND WHAT WE WERE 

02:18:10.518 --> 02:18:14.229
CALLED TO DO. PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP REQUESTED THAT WE BE IN DC

02:18:14.431 --> 02:18:21.696
ON THE SIXTH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HEARD IT FROM THEM

02:18:24.519 --> 02:18:29.586
WERE DOING WHAT HE WANTED THEM 
TO DO. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE 

02:18:29.741 --> 02:18:31.741
LISTENED TO YOU,

02:18:35.019 --> 02:18:37.305
TO ME, TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES, THEY WERE 

02:18:37.514 --> 02:18:39.785
ATTACKING, THEY DID NOT STOP IN 
THE FACE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

02:18:39.984 --> 02:18:43.488
POLICE OFFICERS FIGHTING FOR 
THEIR LIVES TO STOP THEM, THEY 

02:18:43.693 --> 02:18:49.084
WERE FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT. HE
ALONE, OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, 

02:18:49.224 --> 02:18:55.564
HAD THE POWER TO STOP IT. HE DID
NOT. YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE 

02:18:56.312 --> 02:19:01.236
TONIGHT, TOMORROW, THROUGHOUT 
THE TRIAL ABOUT HIS REFUSAL AS 

02:19:01.379 --> 02:19:05.609
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO RESPOND TO
NUMEROUS, DESPERATE PLEAS ON THE

02:19:06.364 --> 02:19:13.866
PHONE, ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA, 
BEGGING HIM TO STOP THE ATTACK. 

02:19:14.082 --> 02:19:17.168
YOU WILL SEE HIS RELENTLESS 
ATTACK ON VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, 

02:19:17.363 --> 02:19:21.465
WHO WAS AT THAT VERY MOMENT 
HIDING WITH HIS FAMILY AS ARMED 

02:19:21.672 --> 02:19:28.362
EXTREMIST WERE CHANTING "HANG 
MIKE PENCE." CALLING HIM A 

02:19:28.505 --> 02:19:34.593
TRAITOR. YOU WILL SEE THAT EVEN 
WHEN HE DID FINALLY, 3 1/2 HOURS

02:19:34.794 --> 02:19:41.742
INTO THE ATTACK, TELL THESE 
PEOPLE TO GO HOME, IN PEACE, HE 

02:19:41.885 --> 02:19:47.525
ADDED, AS LEAD MANAGER RASKIN 
SAID, I WILL QUOTE " YOU ARE 

02:19:48.302 --> 02:19:57.731
VERY SPECIAL. WE LOVE YOU." 
THINK FOR A MOMENT, 

02:19:58.694 --> 02:20:06.707
A MOMENT OF THE LIVES LOST THAT 
DAY, OF THE MORE THAN 140 

02:20:06.861 --> 02:20:13.260
WOUNDED POLICE OFFICERS AND ASK 
YOURSELF IF AS SOON AS THIS HAD 

02:20:13.404 --> 02:20:17.891
STARTED, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
HAD SIMPLY GONE ON TO TV, JUST 

02:20:18.091 --> 02:20:23.440
LOG ONTO TWITTER AND SAID STOP 
THE ATTACK. IF HE HAD DONE SO 

02:20:23.636 --> 02:20:29.985
WITH EVEN HALF AS MUCH FORCE AS 
HE SAID STOP THE STEAL , HOW 

02:20:30.189 --> 02:20:38.440
MANY LIVES WOULD WE HAVE SAVED? 
SADLY, HE DID NOT DO THAT. AT 

02:20:38.636 --> 02:20:44.220
THE END OF THE DAY, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN 

02:20:44.424 --> 02:20:50.190
STOPPING THE CERTIFICATION. 
THANKS TO THE BRAVERY OF OUR LAW

02:20:50.409 --> 02:20:54.911
ENFORCEMENT INTO THE BRAVERY OF 
THE SENATORS IN THIS ROOM, EACH 

02:20:55.661 --> 02:20:59.828
OF YOU WHO STILL FULFILLED YOUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, EVEN UNDER 

02:21:00.239 --> 02:21:05.711
THE THREAT OF MORTAL PERIL, BUT 
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THE 

02:21:06.129 --> 02:21:08.129
GREAT HARM HE CAUSED

02:21:11.059 --> 02:21:14.719
TO OUR ELECTED LEADERS, TO US, 
OUR FAMILIES, TO ALL WHO WORK IN

02:21:14.921 --> 02:21:20.903
THE CAPITOL,  OUR STAFF, YOUR 
STAFF, TO OUR BRIEF CAPITOL 

02:21:21.086 --> 02:21:25.642
POLICE WHO DEFEND US TIRELESSLY 
WITH LITTLE THANKS, WHO BELIEVED

02:21:27.196 --> 02:21:29.248
THAT THEY HAD A 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT WOULD 

02:21:29.649 --> 02:21:32.932
DEFEND AND PROTECT THEM BUT 
INSTEAD PUT THEM IN HARM'S WAY, 

02:21:33.131 --> 02:21:38.923
TO THOSE KILLED FOR HEATING HIS 
COMMAND, TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND 

02:21:39.331 --> 02:21:43.264
THE SYSTEM, WHICH ENSURES THAT 
WE HAD A PRESIDENT ELECTED BY 

02:21:44.019 --> 02:21:48.771
THE PEOPLE. OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND OUR STANDING IN THE

02:21:48.981 --> 02:21:55.505
WORLD, THE HARM WAS REAL, THAT 
DAMAGE WAS REAL. 

02:21:56.532 --> 02:22:03.249
LOST THEIR LIVES ON THAT 
TERRIBLE TRAGIC DAY. A WOMAN WAS

02:22:04.103 --> 02:22:10.489
SHOT DEAD, 50 FEET FROM WHERE WE
LAID OUR CERTIFIED 

02:22:11.385 --> 02:22:18.794
RESULTS. FOR THOSE WHO QUESTION 
JUST HOW BAD IT WAS, CRIMINAL 

02:22:18.936 --> 02:22:23.465
COMPLAINTS RECENTLY UNSEALED BY 
THE JUSTICE ARE MORE THAN 

02:22:23.608 --> 02:22:27.280
REVEALING. YOU WILL SEE ONE OF 
THESE DOCUMENTS ON THE SCREEN

02:22:31.275 --> 02:22:33.541
. AND THE CHARGING AFFIDAVIT OF 
ONE OF THE PROBABLY, WE LEARNED 

02:22:33.737 --> 02:22:37.435
MEMBERS OF HIS GROUP SAID I WILL
QUOTE, "THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED 

02:22:38.154 --> 02:22:46.097
MIKE PENCE IF GIVEN THE CHANCE."
AND ANOTHER, WE LEARNED OF A 

02:22:46.331 --> 02:22:50.051
TREAT, IN REAL TIME, WHILE THEY 
WERE IN THE BUILDING, STATING, 

02:22:50.256 --> 02:22:54.955
"WE BROKE INTO THE CAPITAL. WE 
GOT INSIDE, WE DID OUR PART. WE 

02:22:55.157 --> 02:22:59.873
WERE LOOKING FOR NANCY PELOSI TO
SHOOT HER IN THE FREAKING BRAIN 

02:23:00.076 --> 02:23:09.880
BUT WE DID NOT FIND HER." FOR 
ANYONE WHO SUGGESTS OTHERWISE

02:23:13.036 --> 02:23:18.553
, THESE DEFENDANTS, THEMSELVES, 
HAVE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHY THEY 

02:23:19.307 --> 02:23:24.770
WERE HERE. YOU WILL SEE THIS IN 
THE TRIAL THAT IN THE HALLS OF 

02:23:24.970 --> 02:23:29.414
THE CAPITOL , ON SOCIAL MEDIA, 
IN NEWS INTERVIEWS AND CHARGING 

02:23:29.566 --> 02:23:33.146
DOCUMENTS, THEY CONFIRM THEY 
WERE FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S 

02:23:34.118 --> 02:23:39.494
ORDERS. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE 
STATEMENTS ON SCREEN. ONE SAID 

02:23:39.632 --> 02:23:43.991
TRUMP WANTS ALL ABLE-BODIED 
PATRIOTS, ANOTHER THAT PRESIDENT

02:23:44.195 --> 02:23:47.894
DONALD TRUMP IS CALLING US TO 
FIGHT, THIS IS NOT A JOKE. 

02:23:48.097 --> 02:23:50.527
ANOTHER ONE, I THOUGHT I WAS 
FOLLOWING MY PRESIDENT. I 

02:23:50.726 --> 02:23:53.917
THOUGHT I WAS FOLLOWING WHAT WE 
WERE CALLED TO DO. OUR PRESIDENT

02:23:54.793 --> 02:23:59.346
WANTS US HERE. WE WAIT AND TAKE 
ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT. HE 

02:24:00.115 --> 02:24:03.670
MADE THEM BELIEVE OVER MANY 
WEEKS THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

02:24:03.831 --> 02:24:08.048
STOLEN AND THEY WERE FOLLOWING 
HIS COMMAND TO TAKE BACK THEIR 

02:24:08.201 --> 02:24:10.201
COUNTRY.

02:24:12.582 --> 02:24:19.729
AS I PREPARED FOR TODAY, 
YESTERDAY, THIS TRIAL, WHY 

02:24:19.937 --> 02:24:24.272
MEMORY I COULD NOT SHAKE WHICH 
WAS ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 6th,

02:24:24.457 --> 02:24:29.351
AND THE FEELING OF WALKING BACK 
ONTO THE HOUSE FLOOR AND SEEING 

02:24:29.548 --> 02:24:35.430
MANY OF YOU THERE. I REMEMBER US
FINISHING OUR TASK AT 4:00 IN 

02:24:36.181 --> 02:24:42.887
THE MORNING. AS I WALKED OFF OF 
THE FLOOR, I WAS SO GRATEFUL, SO

02:24:43.026 --> 02:24:49.267
GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
THANK THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 

02:24:49.468 --> 02:24:55.370
UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE, FOR 
HIS ACTIONS, FOR STANDING BEFORE

02:24:56.141 --> 02:25:00.185
US AND ASKING US TO FOLLOW OUR 
OATH AND OUR FAITH AND OUR DUTY

02:25:03.471 --> 02:25:09.774
. WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS
OF SLEEP THAT MORNING. EARLY THE

02:25:09.952 --> 02:25:14.871
NEXT DAY, I CALLED MY DAD WHO 
CAME TO THIS COUNTRY, AS I 

02:25:15.073 --> 02:25:18.292
MENTIONED, AS AN IMMIGRANT 40 
YEARS AGO. I TOLD HIM THAT THE 

02:25:18.441 --> 02:25:23.956
PROUDEST MOMENT BY FAR OF 
SERVING IN CONGRESS, FOR ME, WAS

02:25:24.903 --> 02:25:28.750
GOING BACK ONTO THE FLOOR WITH 
EACH OF YOU TO FINISH THE WORK 

02:25:29.157 --> 02:25:34.857
THAT WE HAD STARTED. I AM 
HUMBLED TO BE BACK WITH 

02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:42.010
TODAY AND JUST AS ON JANUARY 6th
WHEN WE OVERCAME THE ATTACK ON 

02:25:42.215 --> 02:25:46.691
OUR CAPITOL  AND OUR COUNTRY, I 
AM HOPEFUL THAT AT THIS TRIAL, 

02:25:46.888 --> 02:25:53.354
WE CAN USE OUR RESOLVE AND OUR 
RESILIENCE TO, AGAIN, UPHOLD OUR

02:25:53.491 --> 02:25:57.863
DEMOCRACY BY FAITHFULLY APPLYING
THE LAW, VINDICATING THE 

02:25:58.035 --> 02:26:00.803
CONSTITUTION, INCLUDING 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

02:26:01.001 --> 02:26:03.001
ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.

02:26:15.198 --> 02:26:23.443
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, REPRESENTATIVES 
JOAQUIN CASTRO AND ERIC SWELL 

02:26:23.644 --> 02:26:26.086
WILL NOW SHOW THE EVIDENCE OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S LONG 

02:26:26.838 --> 02:26:32.870
CAMPAIGN TO DELEGITIMIZE HIS 
ELECTORAL DEFEAT AND GALVANIZE 

02:26:33.565 --> 02:26:36.885
HIS SUPPORTERS TO HELP HIM 
RETAIN HIS POWER AT ANY COST. WE

02:26:37.098 --> 02:26:40.285
WILL GO STEP-BY-STEP AND EXPLAIN
THE PROGRESSION OF THE WEIGHT UP

02:26:40.432 --> 02:26:43.178
UNTIL THE ATTACK.

02:27:16.970 --> 02:27:19.012
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, MY NAME IS 
JOAQUIN CASTRO TO REPRESENT SAN 

02:27:19.208 --> 02:27:21.262
ANTONIO IN THE UNITED STATES 
CONGRESS. THERE IS A SAYING THAT

02:27:21.466 --> 02:27:24.710
A LIE CAN TRAVEL HALFWAY AROUND 
THE WORLD BEFORE THE TRUTH HAS A

02:27:24.914 --> 02:27:29.883
CHANCE TO PUT ON ITS SHOES. THAT
WAS BEFORE THE INTERNET. THE 

02:27:30.095 --> 02:27:36.651
POINT OF THAT SAYING IS THE LIE 
CAN DO INCREDIBLE DAMAGE AND 

02:27:37.051 --> 02:27:39.999
DESTRUCTION AND THAT IS 
ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THAT LINE 

02:27:40.886 --> 02:27:44.854
IS TOLD BY THE MOST POWERFUL 
PERSON ON EARTH, OUR 

02:27:45.617 --> 02:27:49.954
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES .

02:27:50.143 --> 02:27:56.111
THIS ATTACK DID NOT COME FROM 
ONE SPEECH, IT DID NOT HAPPEN BY

02:27:56.267 --> 02:28:01.050
ACCIDENT. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS, 
CLEARLY, THAT THIS MOB WAS 

02:28:01.221 --> 02:28:05.658
PROVOKED OVER MANY MONTHS BY 
DONALD J TRUMP. IF YOU LOOK AT 

02:28:05.856 --> 02:28:10.769
THE EVIDENCE, HIS PURPOSEFUL 
CONDUCT, YOU WILL SEE THE ATTACK

02:28:10.973 --> 02:28:16.081
WAS FORESEEABLE, AND PREVENTABLE
. I WILL START BY DISCUSSING 

02:28:16.316 --> 02:28:18.327
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIONS
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION, WHEN

02:28:18.526 --> 02:28:24.493
HE SET UP HIS BIG LINE. 
BEGINNING IN THE SPRING OF 2020,

02:28:24.709 --> 02:28:28.214
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BEGAN TO 
FALL BEHIND IN THE POLLS. BY 

02:28:28.418 --> 02:28:31.023
JULY, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD
REACHED A NEW LOW, HE WAS 

02:28:31.215 --> 02:28:36.817
RUNNING 15 POINTS BEHIND HIS 
OPPONENT. HE WAS SCARED. HE 

02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:41.717
BEGAN TO BELIEVE HE COULD 
LEGITIMATELY LOSE THE ELECTION. 

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:45.457
HE DID SOMETHING ENTIRELY 
UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF 

02:28:46.231 --> 02:28:52.223
OUR NATION, HE REFUSED TO COMMIT
TO A PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF 

02:28:52.436 --> 02:29:02.341
POWER. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CAN YOU GIVE 

02:29:02.544 --> 02:29:04.783
A DIRECT ANSWER, YOU WILL ACCEPT
THE ELECTION? 

02:29:04.784 --> 02:29:09.452
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM NOT GOING TO SAY YES.

02:29:14.215 --> 02:29:16.127
THERE IS A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF 
POWER? 

02:29:16.128 --> 02:29:20.352
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GET RID OF THE BALLOTS AND WE
WILL HAVE A PEACEFUL ONE. THERE 

02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:27.969
WILL BE A CONTINUATION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, THE PRESIDENT OF 

02:29:28.174 --> 02:29:31.966
THE UNITED STATES SAID " I WILL 
NOT BE A TRANSITION OF POWER

02:29:34.434 --> 02:29:37.041
THERE WON'T BE A TRANSITION OF 
POWER, THERE WILL BE A 

02:29:37.175 --> 02:29:39.175
CONTINUATION

02:29:40.374 --> 02:29:42.235
. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS GIVEN 
EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO TELL 

02:29:42.236 --> 02:29:44.236
SUPPORTERS, IF I LOSE,

02:29:50.605 --> 02:29:52.605
I WILL PEACEFULLY TRANSFER POWER
TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT. INSTEAD, 

02:29:52.704 --> 02:29:55.184
HE TOLD SUPPORTERS THE ONLY WAY 
HE COULD LOSE THE ELECTION AS IF

02:29:55.403 --> 02:29:57.403
IT WAS STOLEN. IN TWEET AFTER 
TWEET,

02:30:00.581 --> 02:30:02.439
HE MADE SWEEPING ALLEGATIONS OF 
ELECTION FRAUD THAT COULDN'T 

02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:04.440
POSSIBLY BE TRUE.

02:30:11.268 --> 02:30:13.719
HERE IS THE POINT. HE DIDN'T 
CARE IF THE CLAIMS WERE TRUE. HE

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:15.963
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS 
SUPPORTERS WERE ANGRY. LIKE THE 

02:30:16.165 --> 02:30:19.881
ELECTION WAS BEING RIPPED AWAY 
FROM THEM. ON MAY 24, SIX MONTHS

02:30:20.082 --> 02:30:24.191
BEFORE THE ELECTION, HE TWEETED 
IT WILL BE THE GREATEST RIGGED 

02:30:24.414 --> 02:30:28.929
ELECTION IN HISTORY. HOW COULD 
HE POSSIBLY KNOW THAT IT WOULD 

02:30:29.146 --> 02:30:32.229
BE THE GREATEST RIGGED ELECTION 
IN HISTORY, SIX MONTHS BEFORE 

02:30:32.430 --> 02:30:34.430
THE ELECTION HAPPENED

02:30:39.453 --> 02:30:41.284
? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ON JUNE 22, MORE OF THE SAME.

02:30:41.285 --> 02:30:43.737
OUR 2020 ELECTION, IT WILL BE 
THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES. AGAIN,

02:30:43.939 --> 02:30:49.567
ABOUT AN ELECTION THAT HAD NOT 
EVEN HAPPENED. ON JULY 30

02:30:54.819 --> 02:30:56.680
, 2020 WILL BE THE MOST 
INACCURATE AND FRAUDULENT 

02:30:56.681 --> 02:31:01.759
ELECTION IN HISTORY. AGAIN, JUST
BIG WORDS WITH NOTHING TO PROVE 

02:31:01.895 --> 02:31:03.895
THEM

02:31:06.335 --> 02:31:08.415
. HE WANTED TO MAKE SUPPORTERS 
BELIEVE THAT AN ELECTION VICTORY

02:31:08.618 --> 02:31:12.765
WOULD BE STOLEN FROM HIM AND 
FROM THEM. THIS WAS TO RILE UP 

02:31:12.968 --> 02:31:20.185
HIS BASE. TO MAKE THEM ANGRY. 
NOW, THESE WERE JUST A FEW OF 

02:31:20.387 --> 02:31:25.953
THE MANY TIMES PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TWEETED ABOUT THIS. HE DID IT IN

02:31:26.156 --> 02:31:29.614
SPEECHES, RALLIES ON TELEVISION 
TOO. 

02:31:29.615 --> 02:31:32.277
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS GOING TO BE THE 
GREATEST ELECTION DISASTER IN 

02:31:32.410 --> 02:31:34.410
HISTORY.

02:31:35.821 --> 02:31:38.079
THE ONLY WAY WE LOSE THIS 
ELECTION AS IF THE ELECTION IS 

02:31:38.283 --> 02:31:40.283
RIGGED, REMEMBER THAT.

02:31:44.902 --> 02:31:47.553
THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN TAKE THIS 
ELECTION AWAY FROM US IS IF THIS

02:31:47.758 --> 02:31:50.035
IS A RIGGED ELECTION. WE ARE 
GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION. 

02:31:50.036 --> 02:31:52.703
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S A RIGGED ELECTION, THE 
ONLY WAY WE WILL LOSE. 

02:31:52.704 --> 02:31:55.077
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST 
FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS EVER.

02:32:08.115 --> 02:32:10.159
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS CLEARLY A MAN WHO 
REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE 

02:32:10.371 --> 02:32:12.829
POSSIBILITY OR REALITY IN OUR 
DEMOCRACY OF LOSING AN ELECTION.

02:32:13.013 --> 02:32:15.075
THERE ARE DOZENS OF MORE TWEETS 
AND SPEECHES OF DONALD TRUMP 

02:32:15.276 --> 02:32:17.276
SPREADING HIS LIE. BUT, YOU GET 
THE POINT.

02:32:21.843 --> 02:32:23.891
HIS SUPPORTERS GOT THE POINT AS 
WELL. THEY FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT 

02:32:24.107 --> 02:32:26.107
IF HE LOST

02:32:30.308 --> 02:32:31.920
THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE ELECTION
WAS RIGGED. 

02:32:31.921 --> 02:32:34.029
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WILL YOU ACCEPT THE ELECTION 
OF JOE BIDEN UNDER ANY 

02:32:34.229 --> 02:32:34.848
CIRCUMSTANCE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO. 

02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:39.361
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHY IS THAT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BECAUSE IT IS LIES, DECEIT, 

02:32:39.563 --> 02:32:41.976
AND CORRUPTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO YOU THINK IF WE GET THE 

02:32:42.149 --> 02:32:44.149
ELECTION

02:32:46.764 --> 02:32:48.804
IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS OF BIDEN 
ENDS UP SOMEHOW BECOMING THE 

02:32:49.009 --> 02:32:50.851
WINNER, IS IT RIGGED? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES, VERY MUCH SO. 

02:32:50.852 --> 02:32:52.852
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF IT SHOWS UP WITH A JOE 

02:32:53.467 --> 02:32:55.467
BIDEN WHEN

02:33:00.288 --> 02:33:02.575
WIN, WOULD THAT BE THE ONLY WAY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD LOSE WITH 

02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:04.434
A RIGGED ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY, I AGREE WITH 

02:33:04.435 --> 02:33:09.814
THAT. THERE IS NO WAY IN HECK 
THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL LOSE. 

02:33:10.015 --> 02:33:12.266
BUT YES, IT WILL BE A RIGGED 
ELECTION WITH CHEATING THAT WENT

02:33:12.461 --> 02:33:14.800
ON AND WHAT HAVE YOU. I FIRMLY 
BELIEVE THAT. 

02:33:14.801 --> 02:33:20.278
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DON'T, ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM
HAVE RUN FOR ELECTION AND IT'S 

02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:25.586
NO FUN TO LOSE. I AM A TEXAS 
DEMOCRAT AND WE HAVE LOST A FEW 

02:33:25.803 --> 02:33:28.620
ELECTIONS OVER THE YEARS. BUT, 
CAN YOU IMAGINE TELLING YOUR 

02:33:28.759 --> 02:33:30.759
SUPPORTERS

02:33:33.421 --> 02:33:35.683
THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD 
POSSIBLY LOSE IS IF AN AMERICAN 

02:33:35.884 --> 02:33:41.848
ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN 
FROM YOU? ASK YOURSELF WHETHER 

02:33:42.050 --> 02:33:46.820
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN ANYONE, AT 
ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, MAKE 

02:33:47.026 --> 02:33:53.807
THE SAME CLAIM ABOUT THEIR OWN 
ELECTION? THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT 

02:33:54.015 --> 02:33:56.015
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID

02:33:59.102 --> 02:34:01.779
. HE TRULY MADE HIS BASE BELIEVE
THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT HE COULD 

02:34:01.986 --> 02:34:06.560
LOSE WAS IF THE ELECTION WAS 
RIGGED. SENATORS, ALL OF US KNOW

02:34:06.762 --> 02:34:10.222
AND ALL OF US UNDERSTAND HOW 
DANGEROUS THAT IS FOR OUR 

02:34:10.356 --> 02:34:12.356
COUNTRY.

02:34:18.291 --> 02:34:20.554
THE MOST COMBUSTIBLE THING YOU 
CAN DO IN A DEMOCRACY IS TO 

02:34:20.756 --> 02:34:22.756
CONVINCE PEOPLE THE ELECTION 
DOES NOT COUNT. THAT THEIR VOICE

02:34:22.828 --> 02:34:26.098
AND THEIR VOTE DO NOT COUNT. 
THAT IT IS ALL BEEN STOLEN. 

02:34:26.315 --> 02:34:31.259
ESPECIALLY, IF WHAT YOU ARE 
SAYING ARE LIES. LET US TURN NOW

02:34:31.475 --> 02:34:37.405
TO THE ELECTION. AS YOU KNOW, 
THE RESULTS WERE NOT FULLY 

02:34:37.623 --> 02:34:40.911
REPORTED ON ELECTION NIGHT, 
WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IN OUR 

02:34:41.667 --> 02:34:46.406
NATION'S HISTORY. BUT, BY 
NOVEMBER 7, MAJOR NEWS NETWORKS,

02:34:46.623 --> 02:34:50.542
INCLUDING FOX NEWS, REPORTED 
THAT ONCE THE REMAINING VOTES 

02:34:51.154 --> 02:34:53.455
WERE COUNTED THAT JOE BIDEN 
WOULD BE THE LIKELY VICTOR.

02:34:57.856 --> 02:34:59.901
SO, PRESIDENT TRUMP BEGAN URGING
HIS SUPPORTERS TO STOP THE 

02:35:00.104 --> 02:35:04.996
COUNT. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IF 
WE WENT AROUND THIS ROOM, THERE 

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.903
ARE FOLKS THAT ARE SITTING HERE 
THAT STARTED DOWN ON ELECTION 

02:35:10.101 --> 02:35:15.221
NIGHT AND ENDED UP COMING BACK 
UP AND WINNING THEIR RACES. 

02:35:15.425 --> 02:35:18.414
PERHAPS THAT IS WHY SOME OF YOU 
ARE SEATED IN THIS ROOM TODAY.

02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:26.880
BUT, IMAGINE IF YOU WERE BEHIND 
AND THE RESULTS START COMING IN.

02:35:27.083 --> 02:35:29.375
AS YOU PULL AHEAD, YOUR OPPONENT
SAYS, THAT'S NOT FAIR, STOP THE 

02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:35.941
COUNT WHILE I'M STILL AHEAD. 
THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. 

02:35:36.142 --> 02:35:39.698
THAT'S NOT HOW AMERICA WORKS. 
HERE, EVERY VOTE COUNTS.

02:35:43.474 --> 02:35:45.733
YOU DON'T JUST STOP COUNTY WHEN 
ONE PERSON IS AHEAD. WE COUNT 

02:35:46.489 --> 02:35:48.489
EVERY VOTE.

02:35:55.418 --> 02:35:57.468
LET'S BE CLEAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
KNEW THAT YOU CANNOT JUST STOP 

02:35:57.667 --> 02:36:01.933
COUNTING VOTES. BUT, HE WANTED 
TO INFLAME HIS BASE. THERE WAS A

02:36:02.137 --> 02:36:05.790
PURPOSE BEHIND THIS. TO TRULY 
MAKE THEM THINK THAT NOT 

02:36:05.993 --> 02:36:09.934
COUNTING THE VOTES THAT IT WAS A
RIGGED ELECTION. HE SAID ON 

02:36:10.704 --> 02:36:12.704
ELECTION NIGHT

02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:15.928
, QUOTE, THEY ARE TRYING TO 
STEAL THE ELECTION, WE WILL 

02:36:16.131 --> 02:36:18.131
NEVER LET THEM DO IT

02:36:20.838 --> 02:36:23.313
. A LITTLE OVER ONE HOUR LATER, 
AT ROUGHLY 2:30 IN THE MORNING, 

02:36:23.517 --> 02:36:26.375
BEFORE ALL OF THE VOTES WERE 
EVEN CLOSE TO BEING COUNTED, HE 

02:36:26.567 --> 02:36:29.616
GOES FURTHER AND ACTUALLY 
DECLARES VICTORY. TAKE A LOOK. 

02:36:29.817 --> 02:36:31.817
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS FRAUD

02:36:34.536 --> 02:36:39.264
OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THIS IS 
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY.

02:36:39.468 --> 02:36:41.468
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WERE GETTING READY TO WIN 

02:36:41.895 --> 02:36:46.427
THIS ELECTION AND FRANKLY WE DID
WIN THIS ELECTION. 

02:36:46.428 --> 02:36:48.428
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FRANKLY, WE DID WIN.

02:36:52.628 --> 02:36:57.642
RATHER THAN CALMLY SAYING, LET'S
COUNT THE VOTES AND IF THERE IS 

02:36:57.774 --> 02:37:00.217
LEGAL ISSUES, WE WILL GO TO 
COURT AND RESOLVE IT, INSTEAD, 

02:37:00.419 --> 02:37:08.446
HE TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS THAT HE 
ACTUALLY WON THE ELECTION AND 

02:37:08.646 --> 02:37:12.340
THE WHOLE THING WAS FRAUD. HE 
SAID ON NOVEMBER 4, AND HE HAS 

02:37:12.554 --> 02:37:14.554
NEVER RECOUNTED THAT STATEMENT, 
SINCE.

02:37:17.442 --> 02:37:21.975
DESPITE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
PRESSURE AT THE TIME, ELECTION 

02:37:22.192 --> 02:37:24.822
OFFICIALS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
CONTINUED TO CARRY OUT THEIR 

02:37:24.975 --> 02:37:26.975
DUTIES.

02:37:30.617 --> 02:37:32.880
AS THE VOTES WERE COUNTED AND 
HIS LOSS BECAME MORE CERTAIN, HE

02:37:33.097 --> 02:37:38.855
RILED UP HIS BASE FURTHER. TAKE 
A LOOK AT THESE TWEETS. ON 

02:37:39.052 --> 02:37:43.166
NOVEMBER 5, HE TWEETED IN ALL 
CAPITOL LETTERS, AS IF SHOUTING 

02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:48.403
COMMANDS,  QUOTE, STOP THE COUNT
. STOP THE FRAUD. SENATORS,

02:37:52.369 --> 02:37:54.369
IS DANGEROUS.

02:37:56.727 --> 02:37:59.345
I ALSO WANT YOU TO REMEMBER 
THESE TWEETS FOR ANOTHER REASON.

02:37:59.479 --> 02:38:03.726
BECAUSE, THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS 
LIKE WHEN DONALD TRUMP WANTS 

02:38:03.941 --> 02:38:09.567
PEOPLE TO STOP DOING SOMETHING. 
BEAR IN MIND

02:38:13.378 --> 02:38:15.378
PRESIDENT SAYING TO HIS 
SUPPORTERS THAT SOMEONE STOLE 

02:38:15.452 --> 02:38:17.452
YOUR CUP OF COFFEE.

02:38:26.137 --> 02:38:27.984
THIS IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS THAT YOUR

02:38:27.985 --> 02:38:30.087
ELECTION IS BEING STOLEN AND YOU
MUST STOP THE COUNTING OF 

02:38:30.847 --> 02:38:35.175
AMERICAN BOATS. IT WORKED. HIS 
WORDS BECAME THEIR ACTIONS. HIS 

02:38:35.334 --> 02:38:43.270
COMMANDS LED TO THEIR ACTIONS. 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THE SAME 

02:38:43.469 --> 02:38:49.012
DAY AS THOSE TWEETS, THE SAME 
DAY AS THOSE TWEETS, AROUND 100 

02:38:49.213 --> 02:38:53.726
TRUMP SUPPORTERS SHOWED UP IN 
FRONT OF THE MARICOPA COUNTY 

02:38:53.941 --> 02:38:58.230
ELECTIONS CENTER IN PHOENIX. 
SOME WERE CARRYING RIFLES. 

02:38:58.637 --> 02:39:01.936
LITERALLY TRYING TO INTIMIDATE 
OFFICIALS TO STOP THE COUNT, 

02:39:02.138 --> 02:39:05.034
JUST AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 
COMMANDED. THE ARIZONA SECRETARY

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:10.827
OF STATE, KATIE HOBBS, SAID THE 
PROTESTERS WERE QUOTE, CAUSING 

02:39:11.042 --> 02:39:15.354
DELAY AND DISRUPTION AND 
PREVENTING THE EMPLOYEES FROM 

02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:21.331
DOING THEIR JOB. LET'S CALL THIS
WHAT IT WAS. WE ARE FACING A 

02:39:21.935 --> 02:39:26.283
GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WORKERS ARE 
RISKING THEIR HEALTH TO ENSURE 

02:39:26.484 --> 02:39:28.484
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS

02:39:31.419 --> 02:39:33.279
. PRESIDENT TRUMP SUPPORTERS 
WERE ENCIRCLING THEM AND TRYING 

02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:36.074
TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THEIR
OWN JOBS. THIS IS DANGEROUS

02:39:39.889 --> 02:39:43.369
AND IT WAS SCARY AND A BLATANT 
ACT OF POLITICAL INTIMIDATION. 

02:39:44.342 --> 02:39:48.914
PHILADELPHIA, THAT SAME DAY, 
POLICE INVESTIGATED AN ALLEGED 

02:39:49.676 --> 02:39:53.432
PLOT TO ATTACK THE CITY'S 
CONVENTION CENTER WHERE VOTES 

02:39:53.633 --> 02:39:58.162
WERE BEING COUNTED. POLICE TOOK 
AT LEAST ONE MAN INTO CUSTODY 

02:39:58.378 --> 02:40:02.225
WHO WAS CARRYING A WEAPON. THIS 
HAPPENED ALL OVER. IN ATLANTA, 

02:40:02.821 --> 02:40:07.459
IN DETROIT, AND IN MILWAUKEE. 
SUPPORTERS USED ARMED FORCE TO 

02:40:07.676 --> 02:40:13.132
TRY TO DISRUPT LAWFUL COUNTING 
OF VOTES BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT 

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:18.058
INTO A's BIG LIE THAT THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM THEM. 

02:40:18.192 --> 02:40:22.433
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MONTHS OF 
INFLAMING AND INCITING HIS 

02:40:22.636 --> 02:40:27.130
SUPPORTERS HAD WORKED. THEY 
BELIEVED IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO 

02:40:27.347 --> 02:40:29.347
QUITE LITERALLY FIGHT TO STOP 
THE COUNT

02:40:32.684 --> 02:40:35.136
. SO, THE SHOWED UP AT ELECTION 
CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DO

02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:38.253
JUST THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS A FRAUD ON THE 

02:40:39.017 --> 02:40:43.551
AMERICAN PUBLIC. THIS IS AN 
EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY. 

02:40:43.766 --> 02:40:45.830
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WERE GETTING READY TO WIN 

02:40:46.595 --> 02:40:50.275
THIS ELECTION. FRANKLY, WE DID 
WIN THIS ELECTION. 

02:40:50.276 --> 02:40:52.276
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:40:54.275 --> 02:41:01.211
STOP THE COUNT. STOP THE COUNT. 
[ CROWD CHANTING ] STOP THE 

02:41:01.364 --> 02:41:03.364
COUNT. STOP THE COUNT.

02:41:08.451 --> 02:41:13.843
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT
FROM US. 

02:41:13.844 --> 02:41:15.844
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ CROWD CHANTING ].

02:41:20.588 --> 02:41:23.057
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WERE WINNING IN A NUMBER 
OF LOCATIONS OF MEN ARE NUMBER 

02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:27.355
STARTED GETTING WHITTLED AWAY IN
SECRET. 

02:41:27.356 --> 02:41:29.494
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY WILL BE DESTROYED 
BECAUSE AMERICA IS RISING.

02:41:42.692 --> 02:41:51.271
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IT IS. THEY HAD BOUGHT 
INTO HIS BIG LIE. PRESIDENT 

02:41:51.482 --> 02:41:54.434
TRUMP TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN, NEARLY EVERY DAY

02:41:54.973 --> 02:42:02.121
, AND DOZENS OF TWEETS, SPEECHES
AND RALLIES THAT THEIR VOICE AND

02:42:02.337 --> 02:42:06.061
THEIR VOTE WAS BEING STRIPPED 
AWAY AND THEY HAD TO FIGHT TO 

02:42:06.836 --> 02:42:11.740
STOP THAT. AND, THEY BELIEVED 
HIM AND SO THEY FOUGHT. YOU MAY 

02:42:11.875 --> 02:42:19.538
SAY THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW THEY 
WOULD TAKE UP ARMS. BUT, HE DID 

02:42:19.738 --> 02:42:24.176
KNOW WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE 
NEWS. PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT 

02:42:24.341 --> 02:42:26.341
STOP.

02:42:29.733 --> 02:42:36.568
AS WE WILL SHOW, WHEN HE LOST, 
HE BECAME MORE DESPERATE AND 

02:42:36.769 --> 02:42:38.769
INCITED HIS BASE EVEN FURTHER.

02:42:44.742 --> 02:42:46.563
HE URGED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN 
WITH INCREASINGLY FORCEFUL 

02:42:46.564 --> 02:42:52.096
LANGUAGE TO STOP THE STEEL. HE 
GREW MORE DESPERATE AND GAVE 

02:42:52.858 --> 02:42:58.291
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW, 
WHERE, AND WHEN TO FIGHT TO STOP

02:43:02.494 --> 02:43:08.462
THE STEAL. HE TOLD THEM TO SHOW 
UP ON JANUARY 6  AND MARCH TO 

02:43:08.664 --> 02:43:10.664
THE U.S. CAPITOL TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION 

02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:15.673
RESULTS. HE TOLD THEM TO COME 
HERE AND FIGHT LIKE .

02:43:23.139 --> 02:43:25.832
WE WILL SHOW THAT THIS MOB THAT 
SHOWED UP ON JANUARY 6 DID NOT 

02:43:26.036 --> 02:43:31.997
COME OUT OF THIN AIR. PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP, INCITED THIS 

02:43:32.401 --> 02:43:34.401
VIOLENCE. THAT IS THE TRUTH.

02:44:07.890 --> 02:44:13.645
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT AND DISTINGUISH
CENTERS. MY NAME IS ERIC 

02:44:13.848 --> 02:44:17.582
SWALWELL AND I REPRESENT 
CALIFORNIA'S DISTRICT.

02:44:21.413 --> 02:44:24.171
WE JUST LOOKED AT DONALD TRUMP'S
LIES AND ASK BEFORE THE ELECTION

02:44:24.301 --> 02:44:27.178
. BUT, TO PARAPHRASE WHAT IS IN 
CHURCH HILL, THAT WAS NOT THE 

02:44:27.378 --> 02:44:34.372
END OF HIS EFFORTS. THAT WAS NOT
THE BEGINNING OF THE END. BUT, 

02:44:34.576 --> 02:44:37.073
PERHAPS IT WAS THE END OF THE 
BEGINNING. HERE IS WHAT I MEAN. 

02:44:37.273 --> 02:44:44.337
YOU SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP PRIMED 
FOR MONTHS HIS SUPPORTERS,

02:44:48.865 --> 02:44:51.366
THAT IF HE LOST, IT WOULD ONLY 
BE SO BECAUSE THE ELECTION WAS 

02:44:51.573 --> 02:44:56.502
RIGGED. THAT WOULD TAKE TIME. 
JUST LIKE BUILDING A FLYER, IT 

02:44:56.704 --> 02:45:01.183
DOESN'T START WITH THE FLAMES. 
DONALD TRUMP, FOR MONTHS AND 

02:45:01.401 --> 02:45:03.674
MONTHS ASSEMBLED THE TENDER, THE
KINDLING AND HE THREW ON LOGS 

02:45:04.443 --> 02:45:06.443
FOR FUEL TO HAVE HIS SUPPORTERS 
BELIEVE

02:45:10.321 --> 02:45:12.797
THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT THEIR 
VICTORY WOULD BE LOST WAS IF IT 

02:45:12.999 --> 02:45:16.262
WAS STOLEN. SO, THAT WAY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS READY. IF 

02:45:16.478 --> 02:45:19.604
YOU LOST THE ELECTION, TO LIGHT 
THE MATCH.

02:45:23.630 --> 02:45:26.290
ON NOVEMBER 7, AFTER ALL THE 
VOTES WERE COUNTED, PRESIDENT 

02:45:26.491 --> 02:45:30.661
TRUMP DID LOSE BY 7 MILLION 
VOTES.

02:45:37.781 --> 02:45:40.445
FOR DONALD TRUMP, ALL WAS NOT 
LOST. HE HAD A BACKUP PLAN. 

02:45:40.646 --> 02:45:44.148
INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THE RESULTS
OR PURSUING LEGITIMATE CLAIMS, 

02:45:44.352 --> 02:45:50.186
HE TOLD HIS BASE MORE LIES. HE 
DOUSED THE FLAMES WITH KEROSENE

02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:58.684
. THIS WAS NOT JUST SOME RANDOM 
GUY AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD BAR 

02:45:59.117 --> 02:46:05.664
BLOWING OFF STEAM. THIS WAS OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. DAY AFTER 

02:46:05.867 --> 02:46:11.121
DAY HE TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS 
FALSE, OUTLANDISH LIES THAT THE 

02:46:11.261 --> 02:46:15.918
VICTORY AND THAT THE ELECTION 
OUTCOME WAS TAKEN AND THAT IT 

02:46:16.681 --> 02:46:19.797
WAS RIGGED. HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO
SUPPORT FOR HIS CLAIMS, BUT THAT

02:46:19.996 --> 02:46:24.915
WAS NOT THE POINT. HE WANTED TO 
MAKE HIS BASE ANGRIER AND 

02:46:25.065 --> 02:46:31.502
ANGRIER. TO MAKE THEM ANGRY, HE 
WAS WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING. ON 

02:46:32.277 --> 02:46:38.859
NOVEMBER 15, HE STATES, I 
CONCEDE NOTHING. WE HAVE A LONG 

02:46:39.061 --> 02:46:46.802
WAY TO GO. RIGGED ELECTION. IT 
DOESN'T SAY WHY THE ELECTION IS 

02:46:46.933 --> 02:46:52.314
RIGGED. ON NOVEMBER 17, IN A 
TWITTER STATEMENT, DEAD PEOPLE 

02:46:52.445 --> 02:47:01.297
VOTED. THAT'S IT. NO EVIDENCE, 
JUST DEAD PEOPLE VOTED.

02:47:04.722 --> 02:47:08.389
ON NOVEMBER 28 IN A TWITTER 
STATEMENT, WE HAVE FOUND MANY 

02:47:08.595 --> 02:47:14.913
ILLEGAL VOTES, STAY TUNED. THIS 
JUST WAS NOT TRUE. HE NEVER 

02:47:15.126 --> 02:47:19.219
FOUND ILLEGAL VOTES. HE DID NOT 
EVEN TRY TO PREVENT PRETEND HE 

02:47:19.424 --> 02:47:21.424
HAD EVIDENCE FOR THAT

02:47:24.772 --> 02:47:27.023
. STAY TUNED WAS ALL ABOUT 
INCITING HIS BASE AND NOT ABOUT 

02:47:27.228 --> 02:47:29.897
BRINGING LEGITIMATE CLAIMS. IT 
WAS ABOUT DRAMATIZING THE 

02:47:30.101 --> 02:47:33.971
ELECTION TO ANGER HIS 
SUPPORTERS. ON DECEMBER 5, YOU 

02:47:34.185 --> 02:47:38.856
CAN SEE HERE THAT HE GOES AFTER 
THE GOVERNORS OF ARIZONA AND 

02:47:38.994 --> 02:47:42.847
GEORGIA. GOVERNORS FROM HIS OWN 
PARTY CLAIMING THEY WERE NOT 

02:47:43.063 --> 02:47:45.063
WITH HIM. YOU SEE

02:47:51.237 --> 02:47:53.478
, SENATORS, HE CASTS THIS IN 
COMBAT TERMS THAT EITHER YOU ARE

02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:55.920
WITH HIM MAKING SURE THAT HE WON
THE ELECTION OR, YOU ARE 

02:47:56.134 --> 02:48:00.253
FIGHTING AGAINST HIM. THESE ARE 
JUST A FEW OF THE HUNDREDS OF 

02:48:01.029 --> 02:48:04.745
TWITTER STATEMENTS THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT. IT WAS NOT

02:48:04.947 --> 02:48:07.077
JUST TWITTER STATEMENTS. AS YOU 
WILL SEE

02:48:10.289 --> 02:48:12.289
, HE WAS DIALING INTO MEETINGS 
AND HOLDING RALLIES AND 

02:48:12.349 --> 02:48:14.665
APPEARING ON TELEVISION. 
CONTINUING TO SPREAD THE BIG LIE

02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:17.220
THAT HIS ELECTION VICTORY WAS 
STOLEN.

02:48:23.019 --> 02:48:25.287
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PEOPLE THAT WERE DEAD WERE 
SIGNING UP FOR BALLOTS. NOT ONLY

02:48:25.502 --> 02:48:28.541
WERE THEY PUTTING IN A BALLOT, 
BUT DEAD PEOPLE WERE REQUESTING 

02:48:28.677 --> 02:48:32.668
BALLOTS THAT HAD BEEN DEAD FOR 
YEARS AND THEY WERE REQUESTING 

02:48:32.836 --> 02:48:36.211
BALLOTS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DEAD PEOPLE VOTING ALL OVER 

02:48:36.966 --> 02:48:38.966
THE PLACE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE ALLEGED BIDEN OF

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:46.380
MARGIN OF VICTORY IN SEVERAL 
STATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY 

02:48:46.427 --> 02:48:48.427
EXTRAORDINARY LARGE MIDNIGHT 
VOTE DUMPS. HE SAW THEM GOING UP

02:48:48.513 --> 02:48:54.065
TO THE SKY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MASSIVE MIDNIGHT VOTE DUMPS 

02:48:54.484 --> 02:48:57.707
AND DEAD PEOPLE VOTING ALL OVER 
THE PLACE. HE SAID THERE WERE 

02:48:57.864 --> 02:49:02.713
VOTES GOING UP TO THE SKY. THIS 
WAS NEVER ABOUT PURSUING 

02:49:03.476 --> 02:49:05.476
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS

02:49:09.487 --> 02:49:11.936
.  HE WAS SAYING ANYTHING HE 
COULD TO TRIGGER AND ANGER HIS 

02:49:12.139 --> 02:49:14.387
BASE SO THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT 
LIKE TO OVERTURN  A LEGITIMATE 

02:49:14.604 --> 02:49:19.542
ELECTION. AND, IT WORKED. JUST 
AS MANAGER CASTRO SHOWED YOU, 

02:49:19.757 --> 02:49:23.295
TRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE TAKING UP 
ARMS TO STOP THE COUNT.  HIS 

02:49:23.496 --> 02:49:27.753
MESSAGE TO FIGHT LIKE  WAS 
HAVING REAL CONSEQUENCES. IN 

02:49:27.892 --> 02:49:29.892
MICHIGAN

02:49:31.922 --> 02:49:33.958
, YOU WILL RECALL THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP WAS ATTACKING THAT STATE 

02:49:34.162 --> 02:49:39.957
AND ITS OFFICIALS. HE CONTINUED 
THESE ATTACKS EVEN AFTER 

02:49:40.158 --> 02:49:43.311
MICHIGAN CERTIFIED ITS VOTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TAKE A LOOK AT MICHIGAN

02:49:47.950 --> 02:49:50.394
. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID 
WITH RESPECT TO COUNTIES. AND 

02:49:50.598 --> 02:49:56.747
THEN YOU GET TO DETROIT AND IT'S
LIKE MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE? 

02:49:57.154 --> 02:49:59.070
DEAD PEOPLE VOTING ALL OVER THE 
PLACE. 

02:49:59.071 --> 02:50:01.071
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:50:03.686 --> 02:50:05.686
IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTY IN 
MICHIGAN AND IN EVERY DISTRICT, 

02:50:05.764 --> 02:50:08.410
WE SHOULD'VE WON THAT STATE 
EASILY. WE HAVE A SIMILAR TYPE 

02:50:08.612 --> 02:50:13.081
OF GOVERNOR, I THINK, BUT I WILL
LET YOU KNOW THAT IN ABOUT A 

02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:14.787
WEEK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE WAS LITERALLY TELLING THEM

02:50:14.788 --> 02:50:19.522
THAT THERE WERE MORE VOTES IN 
DETROIT THAN PEOPLE. ABOUT 

02:50:19.737 --> 02:50:24.457
260,000 PEOPLE VOTED IN DETROIT.
THERE ARE ROUGHLY 500,000 

02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:29.378
REGISTERED VOTERS IN DETROIT. 
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 670,000 

02:50:29.581 --> 02:50:36.345
PEOPLE LIVING IN THE CITY. SO, 
AGAIN, NOT TRUE. BUT, HE NEEDED 

02:50:36.544 --> 02:50:41.652
TO MAKE THESE OUTLANDISH CLAIMS 
TO TRULY MAKE HIS SUPPORTERS 

02:50:41.852 --> 02:50:44.472
BELIEVE THAT THEIR VICTORY WAS 
STOLEN FROM THEM. AND, IT WAS 

02:50:44.613 --> 02:50:51.291
WORKING. A FEW DAYS AFTER THESE 
CLIPS ON DECEMBER 5, HIS 

02:50:51.495 --> 02:50:53.490
SUPPORTERS SURROUNDED THE 
MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE'S 

02:50:53.491 --> 02:50:56.194
HOME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE 

02:50:56.329 --> 02:50:58.329
HOUSE

02:51:00.815 --> 02:51:05.550
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; STOP THE STEAL . [ CROWD 

02:51:05.752 --> 02:51:15.339
CHANTING ] STOP THE STEAL. STOP 
THE STEAL .  STOP THE STEAL .

02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:23.408
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE A THREAT TO 
DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE A THREAT TO 

02:51:23.626 --> 02:51:27.995
FREE AND HONEST ELECTIONS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9:00 AT NIGHT, THE SECRETARY

02:51:31.019 --> 02:51:33.236
'S FAMILY WAS INSIDE AND 
PROTESTERS HAD SURROUNDED HER 

02:51:33.365 --> 02:51:36.039
HOME. THEY ARE CHANTING THAT SHE

02:51:41.276 --> 02:51:44.308
IS A FELON. WHEN THE PROTESTERS 
SHOWED UP TO SAY, STOP THE STEAL

02:51:47.923 --> 02:51:49.954
, IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME 
TRUMP SUPPORTERS HAD USED 

02:51:50.158 --> 02:51:53.229
THREATS AND INTIMIDATION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CANNOT SAY, I 

02:51:53.433 --> 02:51:55.433
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS INCITING.

02:52:04.685 --> 02:52:06.926
FROM WHAT MANAGER CASTRO SHOWED 
AND FROM WHAT I SHOWED, THERE IS

02:52:07.128 --> 02:52:09.128
PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT HIS 
WORDS HAD CONSEQUENCES. IF HE 

02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:11.868
HAD WANTED TO STOP IT, HE COULD 
STOP IT. YOU SAW MR. CASTRO READ

02:52:12.081 --> 02:52:15.557
STATEMENT AFTER STATEMENT FROM 
OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF SAYING TO

02:52:15.757 --> 02:52:17.839
STOP THE COUNT AND STOP THE 
STEAL . PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

02:52:18.596 --> 02:52:22.556
NEVER SHY ABOUT USING HIS 
PLATFORMS TO TRY TO STOP 

02:52:22.771 --> 02:52:24.771
SOMETHING. HE COULD

02:52:29.794 --> 02:52:31.631
VERY EASILY HAVE TOLD HIS 
SUPPORTERS TO STOP THREATENING 

02:52:31.632 --> 02:52:33.632
OFFICIALS AND STOP GOING TO 
THEIR HOMES. STOP THE THREATS. 

02:52:33.719 --> 02:52:36.441
BUT, EACH TIME, HE DID NOT. 
INSTEAD

02:52:40.443 --> 02:52:42.852
, IN THE FACE OF ESCALATING 
VIOLENCE, HE INCITED THEM 

02:52:42.982 --> 02:52:44.982
FURTHER

02:52:48.426 --> 02:52:50.426
. THE NEXT PHASE OF THE 
CERTIFICATION RESULTS WAS THE 

02:52:50.514 --> 02:52:52.514
CERTIFICATION ON DECEMBER 14 OF 
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. THE

02:52:52.546 --> 02:52:54.546
NIGHT BEFORE, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
PERSONALLY

02:53:00.481 --> 02:53:02.481
ISSUED 14 TWITTER STATEMENTS 
WITH MORE FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT THE

02:53:02.529 --> 02:53:04.374
ELECTION BEING STOLEN AND 
DIRECTING HIS SUPPORTERS TO MAKE

02:53:04.375 --> 02:53:10.690
SURE, QUOTE, THEY CANNOT BE 
CERTIFIED. HE STATES HERE THE

02:53:16.664 --> 02:53:18.664
RHINOS THAT RUN THE STATE VOTING
APPARATUS HAVE CAUSED THE 

02:53:18.741 --> 02:53:20.741
PROBLEM OF ALLOWING THE 
DEMOCRATS TO SO BLATANTLY CHEAT 

02:53:20.819 --> 02:53:24.108
IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE 
ELECTION WHICH WE WON 

02:53:24.310 --> 02:53:26.310
OVERWHELMINGLY. WE WILL NEVER 
GIVE UP.

02:53:32.344 --> 02:53:34.397
IN THE FACE OF THREATS TO 
ELECTED OFFICIALS, THIS IS HIS 

02:53:34.598 --> 02:53:36.598
MESSAGE. HE CALLS THEM

02:53:45.042 --> 02:53:47.042
RINOS. REPUBLICANS IN NAME ONLY 
.

02:53:51.415 --> 02:53:53.257
HE WANTED TO OVERTURN THE 
ELECTION RESULTS SO PRESIDENT 

02:53:53.258 --> 02:53:55.258
TRUMP COULD WIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DESPITE

02:54:02.705 --> 02:54:04.768
THE EFFORTS TO STOP, VOTERS CAST
THEIR WILL ACCORDING TO THE 

02:54:04.970 --> 02:54:08.054
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND JOE BIDEN 
WAS CERTIFIED AS HAVING WON 306 

02:54:08.258 --> 02:54:12.151
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. THE DAY
AFTER THIS OCCURRED, LEADER 

02:54:12.352 --> 02:54:15.825
McCONNELL RECOGNIZE THIS 
STATING, MANY OF US HOPE THAT 

02:54:16.026 --> 02:54:20.963
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD 
HAVE YIELD A DIFFERENT RESULT. 

02:54:21.167 --> 02:54:23.215
BUT OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT HAS
PROCESSES TO DETERMINE WHO WILL 

02:54:23.417 --> 02:54:27.318
BE SWORN IN ON JANUARY 20. 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE HAS SPOKEN. AS

02:54:27.521 --> 02:54:29.521
MANAGER CASTRO SAID

02:54:31.461 --> 02:54:34.601
, NO ONE HERE AND NO ONE AMONG 
US WANTS TO LOSE AN ELECTION

02:54:43.939 --> 02:54:45.993
. SOMETIMES THERE IS A REASON TO
DISPUTE AN ELECTION. SOMETIMES 

02:54:46.195 --> 02:54:49.082
THE COUNT IS CLOSE AND SOMETIMES
WE ASK FOR A RECOUNT OR WE GO TO

02:54:49.281 --> 02:54:50.912
COURT. THAT IS ENTIRELY 
APPROPRIATE. BUT, WHAT PRESIDENT

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:54.800
TRUMP DID WAS DIFFERENT. WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WAS THE 

02:54:55.016 --> 02:54:57.665
POLAR OPPOSITE OF WHAT ANY OF US
WOULD DO IF WE LOST AN ELECTION.

02:54:57.870 --> 02:55:03.171
BECAUSE, ONCE THE OUTCOME IS 
CLEAR AND A JUDGE RULES, WE 

02:55:03.371 --> 02:55:05.497
CONCEDE. WE RECOGNIZE THE WILL 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:12.962
. BECAUSE WE LET THE PEOPLE 
DECIDE. THAT IS WHAT ALL OF THE 

02:55:13.167 --> 02:55:15.012
COURTS AND THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT AND THE 50 STATES 

02:55:15.013 --> 02:55:17.013
THAT HAD COUNTED THE VOTES

02:55:22.136 --> 02:55:24.388
, THEY SAID IT WAS TIME FOR A 
PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER, 

02:55:24.588 --> 02:55:26.489
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR 
CONSTITUTION AND RULE OF LAW 

02:55:26.490 --> 02:55:31.001
DEMANDS. EXCEPT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE DIRECTED ALL OF THE RAGE THAT

02:55:31.207 --> 02:55:33.207
HE HAD INCITED TO JANUARY 6

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.974
. THAT WAS HIS LAST CHANCE TO 
STOP THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF 

02:55:40.137 --> 02:55:45.974
POWER. THAT BRINGS US TO THE 
ATTACK. MANAGER CASTRO TOLD YOU 

02:55:46.192 --> 02:55:50.699
THE POWER OF THE LIE, ESPECIALLY
WHEN THE LIGHT COMES FROM THE 

02:55:50.903 --> 02:55:52.987
MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE 
WORLD, THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. 

02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:57.694
IT ALSO HELPS IF YOU SPEND 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO AMPLIFY 

02:55:57.901 --> 02:56:01.662
THE LIE. YOU WILL SEE HERE THAT 
IN MID-DECEMBER

02:56:05.284 --> 02:56:08.583
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED TO THE
RELEASE OF ADS, INCLUDING THE 

02:56:08.801 --> 02:56:13.058
ONES ENTITLED, THE EVIDENCE IS 
OVERWHELMING. FRAUD, STOP THE 

02:56:13.465 --> 02:56:17.996
STEAL. HE STOPPED  SPENT $50 
MILLION FROM HIS LEGAL DEFENSE 

02:56:18.206 --> 02:56:23.285
FUND TO STOP THE STEAL AND 
AMPLIFY HIS MESSAGE. 

02:56:27.419 --> 02:56:29.419
THEY WERE RELEASED NATIONALLY 
AND PLAYED IN VIDEO ADS AND 

02:56:29.450 --> 02:56:31.450
ONLINE ADVERTISING. TARGETING

02:56:39.277 --> 02:56:41.332
TEXT MESSAGES. THEY USE THE SAME
WORDS AND PHRASES THAT PRESIDENT

02:56:41.534 --> 02:56:43.534
TRUMP HAD BEEN SPREADING FOR 
MONTHS. THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:45.590
FULL OF FRAUD AND TO STOP THE

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:52.664
STEAL. NOW THERE WAS A FURTHER 
PURPOSE. HOW DO WE KNOW THE 

02:56:52.865 --> 02:56:55.346
PURPOSE? THESE ADS WERE DESIGNED
TO RUN ALL THE WAY UP TO JANUARY

02:56:55.561 --> 02:56:57.561
5 . THEN, THEY STOPPED.

02:57:00.658 --> 02:57:02.286
THIS WAS PURPOSEFUL AND 
DELIBERATE PLANNING TO TARGET 

02:57:02.287 --> 02:57:05.256
HIS BASE TO RALLY AROUND THAT 
DAY. IT WAS NOT JUST HIS ADS

02:57:15.409 --> 02:57:17.659
, HE CONTINUED TO USE HIS OWN 
PLATFORM. HE TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:19.905
WHO TRULY BELIEVED THEIR VICTORY
HAD BEEN STOLEN AND THEY WERE 

02:57:20.107 --> 02:57:22.382
READY TO FIGHT. HE TOLD THEM 
WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW TO STOP 

02:57:22.587 --> 02:57:24.786
WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS A STEEL. 
DONALD TRUMP WOULD ISSUE A 

02:57:24.922 --> 02:57:31.755
DELIBERATE CALL TO ACTION. JUST 
LIKE IN HIS ADS, THAT ACTION 

02:57:31.973 --> 02:57:39.452
CENTERED AROUND JANUARY 6. ON 
DECEMBER 19, AT 1:42 IN THE 

02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:42.458
MORNING, OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
TWEETED

02:57:47.263 --> 02:57:54.230
, BIG PROTEST IN D.C. ON JANUARY
6, BE THERE. IT WILL BE WILD. WE

02:57:54.442 --> 02:57:59.474
WILL BE WILD. WE KNOW WHY HE 
PICKS THIS DAY

02:58:06.925 --> 02:58:09.387
, IT WASN'T RANDOM. IT WAS HIS 
LAST CHANCE TO STOP A PEACEFUL 

02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:12.246
TRANSITION OF POWER. HE GAVE HIS
SUPPORTERS PLENTY OF TIME TO 

02:58:12.380 --> 02:58:17.801
PLAN. THIS WAS A SAVE THE DATE 
THAT WAS SENT OUT 18 DAYS BEFORE

02:58:18.004 --> 02:58:20.497
THE EVENT ON JANUARY 6. IT WAS 
NOT A CASUAL ONE OFF REFERENCE 

02:58:20.698 --> 02:58:25.643
OR A SINGLE INVITATION. FOR THE 
NEXT 18 DAYS, DONALD TRUMP WOULD

02:58:25.861 --> 02:58:29.946
MAKE SURE TO REMIND THEM OVER 
AND OVER AND OVER TO SHOW UP ON 

02:58:30.705 --> 02:58:34.804
JANUARY 6. HE WOULD TELL THEM 
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED THEM TO 

02:58:34.938 --> 02:58:40.584
DO. ON DECEMBER 26, HE TWEETS, 
IF A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL 

02:58:41.342 --> 02:58:43.342
CANDIDATE HAD AN ELECTION

02:58:51.643 --> 02:58:53.877
STOLEN WITH PROOF OF SUCH ACTS 
AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE, 

02:58:54.078 --> 02:58:56.103
THE DEMOCRAT SENATORS WOULD 
CONSIDER IT AN ACT OF WAR AND 

02:58:56.318 --> 02:58:58.351
FIGHT TO THE DEATH. MITCH AND 
THE REPUBLICANS DO NOTHING. JUST

02:58:58.567 --> 02:59:00.567
WANT TO LET IT PASS WITH NO 
FIGHT.

02:59:07.593 --> 02:59:09.841
HE IS SAYING THE REPUBLICANS ARE
DOING NOTHING AND HAVE NO FIGHT 

02:59:10.056 --> 02:59:13.745
BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOB 
TAKING ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

02:59:13.962 --> 02:59:15.962
PROCESS OF CERTIFYING THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS.

02:59:23.151 --> 02:59:25.151
HE ALSO SUGGESTS, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, THAT IF THIS IS THE 

02:59:25.203 --> 02:59:27.665
REVERSE OF THE DEMOCRATS HAD 
LOST THAT IT WOULD BE AN ACT OF 

02:59:27.869 --> 02:59:31.131
WAR. AN ACT OF WAR. THAT IS HOW 
DONALD TRUMP PREPARED HIS 

02:59:31.351 --> 02:59:33.351
SUPPORTERS FOR JANUARY 6

02:59:36.255 --> 02:59:38.523
. HE EVEN STATED AGAIN, 14 
MINUTES LATER, TO MAKE SURE HIS 

02:59:38.739 --> 02:59:42.416
SUPPORTERS UNDERSTOOD. QUOTE, 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 

02:59:42.618 --> 02:59:45.636
FBI HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT THE 
2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION VOTER

02:59:45.775 --> 02:59:48.653
FRAUD. THE BIGGEST SCAM, ALL 
CAPS,

02:59:54.298 --> 02:59:55.926
IN THE NATION'S HISTORY DESPITE 
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE. THEY 

02:59:55.927 --> 03:00:00.054
SHOULD BE ASHAMED. THEN, HE 
ADDS, HISTORY WILL REMEMBER. 

03:00:00.272 --> 03:00:06.846
NEVER GIVE UP, SEE EVERYONE IN 
D.C. ON JANUARY 6. THAT PHRASE, 

03:00:07.053 --> 03:00:13.605
HISTORY WILL REMEMBER WAS THE 
ONLY TIME AND THE FIRST TIME 

03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:19.322
DONALD TRUMP HAD USED IT IN HIS 
PRESIDENCY. HE SENT THIS TO 70+ 

03:00:19.524 --> 03:00:24.028
MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS. THE 
DAY THEY NEEDED TO SHOW UP AND 

03:00:24.229 --> 03:00:29.406
BE READY TO FIGHT. ON DECEMBER 
27, HE REMINDS THEM AGAIN

03:00:32.166 --> 03:00:36.156
MISS IT. INFORMATION TO FOLLOW. 
A FEW DAYS LATER ON DECEMBER 30,

STATES, THE BIG PROTEST RALLY IN
WASHINGTON WILL TAKE PLACE AT 

03:00:53.096 --> 03:00:58.229
11:00 A.M.. LOCATIONAL DETAILS

03:00:58.434 --> 03:01:01.495
WILL SEE ONE HOUR LATER THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP RETWEETED ONE OF

03:01:01.695 --> 03:01:03.695
HIS TWITTER FOLLOWERS.

03:01:12.782 --> 03:01:14.782
THAT FOLLOWER WAS KYLIE KREMER, 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WOMEN FOR 

03:01:14.803 --> 03:01:16.674
AMERICA FIRST, THE GROUP 
ORGANIZING THE JANUARY 6 RALLY 

03:01:16.675 --> 03:01:19.130
AND THE CREATOR OF THE FACEBOOK 
GROUP, STOP THE STEAL 

03:01:27.136 --> 03:01:28.586

IS COMING, MR. PRESIDENT. 
REFERRING TO THE CALVARY SHOWING

03:01:30.444 --> 03:01:33.116
UP ON JANUARY 6. SHE ALSO ADDED 
A WEBSITE FOR SUPPORTERS TO RSVP

03:01:33.331 --> 03:01:36.067
AND MADE CLEAR WHAT THE MESSAGE 
WAS WITH THE HASHTAG,  STEAL .

03:01:42.118 --> 03:01:47.634
AND WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY? 
A GREAT HONOR, HE WROTE BACK. IT

03:01:47.849 --> 03:01:51.981
WAS NOT JUST A SINGLE TWEET. HE 
AND HIS ORGANIZERS WOULD DO THIS

03:01:52.183 --> 03:01:54.183
OVER AND OVER

03:02:05.105 --> 03:02:06.948
, REPEATEDLY. THEN ANOTHER 
SUPPORTER TWEETS, WE HAVE BEEN 

03:02:06.949 --> 03:02:08.997
MARCHING ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY 
FOR YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND NOW

BESIDE YOU. THANK YOU FOR 
FIGHTING FOR US. 

03:02:13.313 --> 03:02:15.559
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN MR. TRUMP RETWEETED HER 
TWEET, HE WROTE, BEST DAY EVER. 

03:02:16.321 --> 03:02:20.840
THANK YOU. IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR

STRONG ON JANUARY 6 AND WE ARE 
BRINGING THE CAVALRY, MR. 

03:02:27.338 --> 03:02:29.102
PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE BRINGING THE CAVALRY. 

03:02:29.103 --> 03:02:31.103
THAT IS THE CONSISTENT MESSAGE

03:02:37.681 --> 03:02:39.718
. THIS WAS NOT JUST ANY OLD 
PROTEST. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

03:02:39.934 --> 03:02:44.639
INCITING SOMETHING HISTORIC. THE
CAVALRY WAS COMING. HE WAS 

03:02:44.784 --> 03:02:47.222
ORGANIZED. IN HER POST

03:02:52.884 --> 03:02:55.310
, MS. LAWRENCE TAGGED KYLIE 
KREMER, THE ORGANIZER OF THE 

03:02:55.451 --> 03:02:57.451
EVENT

03:02:59.867 --> 03:03:01.867
, WHOSE POST WE JUST SAW 
PRESIDENT TRUMP RETWEET. AGAIN, 

03:03:01.957 --> 03:03:03.957
YOU SEE THIS WAS ALL CONNECTED.

03:03:11.154 --> 03:03:13.197
I WON'T SHOW YOU ALL OF THE 
TWITTER STATEMENTS, AND THERE 

03:03:13.415 --> 03:03:18.725
ARE A LOT. BUT, HERE IS ONE 
MORE. PRESIDENT TRUMP RETWEETED 

03:03:18.927 --> 03:03:22.246
ANOTHER POST WHICH HAD ALL OF 
THE DETAILS OF JANUARY 6 WITH 

03:03:22.448 --> 03:03:25.005
THE SAME HASHTAGS. MARCH FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, DO NOT CERTIFY,

03:03:29.637 --> 03:03:31.701
STOP THE STEAL. IN RESPONSE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WRITES BACK , I 

03:03:31.904 --> 03:03:34.068
WILL BE THERE ON THE HISTORIC 
DAY.

03:03:37.636 --> 03:03:39.636
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEFORE CONGRESS

03:03:41.956 --> 03:03:45.171
, I PROSECUTED VIOLENT CRIMES IN
CALIFORNIA. I WAS IN ALAMEDA 

03:03:45.330 --> 03:03:47.330
COUNTY

03:03:51.558 --> 03:03:52.984
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WHEN YOU 
INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE 

03:03:52.985 --> 03:03:54.985
VIOLENT CRIMES, YOU HAVE TO 
DISTINGUISH

03:03:59.168 --> 03:04:01.217
, WAS IT THE HEAT OF PASSION 
CRIME OR SOMETHING MORE 

03:04:01.419 --> 03:04:03.262
DELIBERATE AND PLANNED? WAS IT 
PREMEDITATED? THE EVIDENCE HERE 

03:04:03.263 --> 03:04:06.350
ON THIS IS OVERWHELMING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CONDUCT 

03:04:06.566 --> 03:04:10.806
LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6 WAS 
DELIBERATE, PLANNED, AND 

03:04:10.938 --> 03:04:17.631
PREMEDITATED. THIS WAS NOT ONE 
SPEECH OR ONE TWEETS, IT WAS 

03:04:17.837 --> 03:04:22.959
DOZENS IN RAPID SUCCESSION WITH 
THE SPECIFIC DETAILS. HE WAS 

03:04:23.159 --> 03:04:26.444
ACTING AS PART OF THE HOST 
COMMITTEE. IN FACT, WHEN HE HAD 

03:04:26.645 --> 03:04:31.771
ASSEMBLED HIS INFLAMED MOB IN 
D.C., HE WARNED US THAT HE KNEW 

03:04:31.982 --> 03:04:33.982
WHAT WAS COMING.

03:04:38.944 --> 03:04:41.349
THIS WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 'S 
STATEMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE THE 

03:04:41.483 --> 03:04:43.483
ATTACK

03:04:44.712 --> 03:04:47.189
. I SHOULD SAY THIS WAS ONE OF 
HIS DOZENS OF STATEMENTS ON 

03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:51.543
TWITTER IN THE HOURS LEADING UP 
TO THE ATTACK. I HOPE THE 

03:04:51.757 --> 03:04:53.757
DEMOCRATS AND EVEN MORE 
IMPORTANTLY THOUGH WEEK

03:04:58.894 --> 03:05:00.894
AND INEFFECTIVE RINO SECTION OF 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE LOOKING

03:05:00.949 --> 03:05:02.997
AT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
POURING INTO D.C. . THEY WON'T 

03:05:03.211 --> 03:05:05.211
STAND FOR A LANDSLIDE VICTORY TO
BE STOLEN.

03:05:10.158 --> 03:05:13.774
AT SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, AT 
JOHN CORNYN.

03:05:19.939 --> 03:05:22.195
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE POURING INTO
D.C. THAT WILL NOT STAND FOR THE

03:05:22.387 --> 03:05:26.316
LANDSLIDE ELECTION TO BE STOLEN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE. HE TAGS 

03:05:26.518 --> 03:05:28.518
SENATORS TO PRESSURE YOU TO STOP
THIS

03:05:33.666 --> 03:05:35.953
. HE WARNS ALL OF US THAT HIS 
THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS, WHOM 

03:05:36.167 --> 03:05:38.435
YOU WILL SEE THE FBI HAD WARNED 
WERE ARMED AND TARGETING THE 

03:05:39.211 --> 03:05:42.791
CAPITOL  WILL NOT STAND FOR US 
CERTIFYING THE RESULTS OF THE 

03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:48.142
ELECTION. THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT 
ONE SPEECH. HE BUILT THIS MOB 

03:05:48.561 --> 03:05:53.066
OVER MANY MONTHS WITH MISSED 
REPEATED MESSAGING UNTIL THEY 

03:05:53.281 --> 03:05:55.540
BELIEVED THEY HAD BEEN ROBBED OF
THEIR VOTE AND THEY WOULD DO 

03:05:55.744 --> 03:05:57.744
ANYTHING TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION

03:06:02.491 --> 03:06:04.739
. HE MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT 
THEIR VICTORY WAS STOLEN AND HE 

03:06:04.943 --> 03:06:07.415
AND CITED THEM SO THAT HE COULD 
USE THEM TO STEAL THE ELECTION 

03:06:08.177 --> 03:06:11.255
FOR HIMSELF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS ELECTION WAS RIGGED. 

03:06:11.390 --> 03:06:13.390
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:06:24.756 --> 03:06:26.996
THIS IS AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND WE WILL 

03:06:27.213 --> 03:06:29.465
NOT STAND FOR IT ANYMORE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE DON'T ROOT OUT THE 

03:06:29.669 --> 03:06:31.525
FRAUD, THE TREMENDOUS AND 
HORRIBLE FRAUD OF THE 2020 

03:06:31.526 --> 03:06:32.954
ELECTION, WE DON'T HAVE A 
COUNTRY ANYMORE. 

03:06:32.955 --> 03:06:35.005
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY LIE, THEY CHEAT, THEY 
STEAL. THEY ARE RUTHLESS IN 

03:06:35.219 --> 03:06:39.734
GETTING POWER AND CONTROL BY ANY
MEANS NECESSARY . 

03:06:39.735 --> 03:06:46.689
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PLEASE STEP BACK. MOVE BACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ CROWD CHANTING ]. 

03:06:46.690 --> 03:06:52.421
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ CROWD CHANTING ]. 

03:06:52.422 --> 03:06:54.422
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ CROWD CHANTING ]

03:06:59.394 --> 03:07:01.236
STOP THE STEAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO 

03:07:01.237 --> 03:07:04.747
STEAL THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU 
CANNOT LET THEM . 

03:07:04.748 --> 03:07:06.748
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN

03:07:12.388 --> 03:07:14.684
, NEVER CONCEDE, FIGHT. HE TOLD 
THEM IN SPEECH AFTER SPEECH. THE

03:07:14.899 --> 03:07:16.899
CROWDS WERE READY TO FIGHT

03:07:21.857 --> 03:07:23.890
. THIS IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS INCITING. HE FORESAW WHAT 

03:07:24.092 --> 03:07:26.364
WAS COMING AND THIS IS WHAT HE 
DELIBERATELY LED TO OUR DOORSTEP

03:07:26.584 --> 03:07:29.338
ON JANUARY 6. I WANT TO BE CLEAR
THAT DURING THIS TRIAL

03:07:34.155 --> 03:07:36.650
, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE VIOLENT
MOB DURING THE ATTACK, WE DON'T 

03:07:36.866 --> 03:07:38.866
MEAN EVERY AMERICAN WHO SHOWED 
UP AT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RALLY 

03:07:38.913 --> 03:07:41.306
PERIOD CERTAIN AMERICANS CAME TO
PROTEST PEACEFULLY, AS IS THEIR 

03:07:41.443 --> 03:07:45.002
RIGHT. THAT IS WHAT MAKES OUR 
COUNTRY SO GREAT. TO DEBATE 

03:07:45.141 --> 03:07:47.141
FREELY

03:07:49.552 --> 03:07:51.996
, OPENLY AND PEACEFULLY, OUR 
DIFFERENCES. JUST LIKE ALL OF 

03:07:52.127 --> 03:07:56.402
YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO IN 
THIS VERY ROOM ON JANUARY 6. 

03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:58.600
BUT, WHAT PRESIDENT DID

03:08:08.690 --> 03:08:10.690
TRUMP DID WAS DIFFERENT. HE 
DIDN'T TELL SUPPORTERS TO FIGHT 

03:08:10.772 --> 03:08:12.772
OR BE STRONG IN A CASUAL 
REFERENCE. HE REPEATEDLY, OVER 

03:08:12.829 --> 03:08:16.145
MONTHS, TOLD THEM TO FIGHT FOR A
SPECIFIC PURPOSE. HE TOLD THEM 

03:08:16.347 --> 03:08:18.393
THEIR VICTORY WAS STOLEN IN THE 
ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND THEIR 

03:08:18.603 --> 03:08:20.603
PATRIOTIC DUTY WAS TO FIGHT TO

03:08:23.711 --> 03:08:26.027
STOP THE STEAL. HE REPEATED THE 
MESSAGING EVEN AFTER HE SAW THE 

03:08:26.247 --> 03:08:30.165
VIOLENCE THAT IT WAS INCITING . 
THEY WERE PRIMED, ANGRY AND 

03:08:30.365 --> 03:08:32.826
READY TO FIGHT AND HE ESCALATED 
AND CHANNELED TO THE RAGE WITH A

03:08:33.042 --> 03:08:35.042
CALL TO ARMS

03:08:39.197 --> 03:08:41.871
. SHOW UP ON JANUARY 6 AT THE 
EXACT TIME THE VOTES OF THE 

03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:43.956
AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE BEING 
COUNTED AND CERTIFIED.  THEN, 

03:08:43.957 --> 03:08:46.969
MARCH TO THE CAPITOL AND FIGHT 
LIKE . HE TOLD THIS TO THOUSANDS

03:08:47.101 --> 03:08:49.101
OF

03:08:50.918 --> 03:08:52.999
PEOPLE WHO WERE ARMED TO THE 
TEETH AND TARGETING US AND 

03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:55.200
DETERMINED TO STOP THE ELECTORAL
COLLEGE COUNT

03:08:59.721 --> 03:09:01.566
. WHAT OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
DID WAS WILDLY DIFFERENT FROM 

03:09:01.567 --> 03:09:03.642
WHAT ANYONE HERE IN THIS ROOM 
DID TO RAISE ELECTION CONCERNS. 

03:09:03.836 --> 03:09:06.309
THIS WAS A DELIBERATE, 
PREMEDITATED INCITEMENT TO HIS 

03:09:06.525 --> 03:09:10.193
BASE TO ATTACK OUR CAPITOL WHILE
THE COUNTING WAS GOING ON . IT 

03:09:10.952 --> 03:09:14.701
WAS FORESEEABLE, ESPECIALLY TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO WARNED US 

03:09:15.092 --> 03:09:17.092
THAT HE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING

03:09:21.066 --> 03:09:23.146
. THIS IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE HAS 
OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWN AND WILL 

03:09:23.358 --> 03:09:25.483
SHOW IN THIS TRIAL. IT IS ALSO 
THE TRUTH.

03:09:32.777 --> 03:09:37.473
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MAJORITY LEADER? 

03:09:37.474 --> 03:09:43.379
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASKED FOR A RECESS FOR A 15
MINUTE BREAK. 

03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:47.045
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITH THAT OBJECTION, SO 
ORDERED.  

03:09:51.575 --> 03:09:53.575
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AN ORGANIZED AND METHODICAL 
MULTIMEDIA

03:09:59.141 --> 03:10:01.141
PRESENTATION THAT DONALD TRUMP 
VIOLATED HIS OATH OF OFFICE AND 

03:10:01.173 --> 03:10:03.418
SHOULD BE CONVICTED OF A HIGH 
CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR.  I AM 

03:10:03.636 --> 03:10:06.260
LIBBY CASEY  AND YOU ARE 
WATCHING  A WASHINGTON POST 

03:10:06.395 --> 03:10:13.270

METHODICALLY BUILDING A CASE 

03:10:39.259 --> 03:10:41.319
SHOWING WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
DOING IN THE WEEKS LEADING TO 

03:10:42.078 --> 03:10:44.078
JANUARY 6

03:10:47.453 --> 03:10:48.896
.

03:10:48.897 --> 03:10:51.148
YOU TAKE IT TOGETHER. ALL OF US 
AND EVERYONE WATCHING AT HOME 

03:10:51.351 --> 03:10:55.650
AND THE SINNERS IN THE TRIAL, WE
LIVED THROUGH THIS. IT IS NOT 

03:10:55.854 --> 03:10:58.236
HISTORY, IT IS THE LAST YEAR. IN
THE PRESENTATIONS FROM 

03:10:58.418 --> 03:11:00.418
CONGRESSMAN

03:11:07.706 --> 03:11:14.274
, WE SAW TWEETS GOING BACK NOT 
JUST TO THE ELECTION, BUT BEFORE

03:11:14.476 --> 03:11:20.400
THE ELECTION MAT THOSE UP TO SAY
IT WAS PROVOKED BY TRUMP. IT WAS

03:11:20.601 --> 03:11:24.526
USED A COUPLE OF TIMES BETWEEN 
PRESENTATIONS THAT HE SENT A 

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:31.960
SAVE THE DATE TO SUPPORTERS FOR 
PEOPLE TO COME TO WASHINGTON ON 

03:11:32.366 --> 03:11:37.433
JANUARY 6. IT IS MORE THAN JUST 
THE SINGLE SPEECH THAT PRESIDENT

03:11:37.574 --> 03:11:42.017
TRUMP GAVE BEFORE THE MOB CAME 
TO THE CAPITOL . 

03:11:42.018 --> 03:11:47.327
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN WE SAW THIS, ESPECIALLY 
IN THE LAST HOUR, IT IS BECAUSE 

03:11:47.531 --> 03:11:49.531
THE FBI HAD

03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:54.229
EVIDENCE WITH THE MORE THAN 200 
CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST THE 

03:11:54.274 --> 03:11:56.931
PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF THE 
RIOT THAT THERE WAS ADVANCE 

03:11:57.132 --> 03:11:59.644
PLANNING BEFORE JANUARY 6 AND IT
WAS NOT SPONTANEOUS. THERE WERE 

03:11:59.846 --> 03:12:03.937
PEOPLE ON THE DARK WEB TALKING 
ABOUT STORMING THE CAPITOL AFTER

03:12:04.139 --> 03:12:08.235
THE  RALLY. TO SAY IT WAS 
PROVOKED IN MORE THAN ONE SPEECH

03:12:08.991 --> 03:12:14.157
IS SO TO SAY THAT THE DEFENSE 
TEAM CANNOT COME BACK AND SAY IT

03:12:14.292 --> 03:12:18.725
WAS SPONTANEOUS AND IT WAS PLAN 
ON JANUARY 4 AND JANUARY 5. THAT

03:12:19.484 --> 03:12:21.484
TRUMP WAS

03:12:23.718 --> 03:12:26.534
EGGING PEOPLE ON AND THERE WAS 
NO WAY HE COULD LOSE THIS 

03:12:26.673 --> 03:12:28.673
ELECTION

03:12:30.946 --> 03:12:32.380
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO MORE INTO THE 

03:12:32.381 --> 03:12:36.089
DECISION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT
JANUARY 6 WOULD BE A HALLMARK 

03:12:36.492 --> 03:12:38.559
DAY. A DAY OF HISTORY, AS WE 
HEARD THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

03:12:39.315 --> 03:12:41.315
TALK ABOUT.

03:12:42.859 --> 03:12:45.141
AS WE HEARD PRIOR TO THIS YEAR 
THAT HAD BEEN A CEREMONIAL 

03:12:45.355 --> 03:12:47.355
MOMENT FOR CONGRESS TO CERTIFY 
THESE RESULTS.

03:12:58.715 --> 03:13:01.503
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER JANUARY 6, THIS IS WHEN
THEY CERTIFY THE VOTES.

03:13:09.039 --> 03:13:11.505
THE PRESIDENT, AS WELL AS SOME 
OF HIS ALLIES ON THE HILL FELT 

03:13:11.705 --> 03:13:14.440
IT WAS SORT OF A LAST STAND. 
THAT THEY WANTED TO OBJECT

03:13:19.923 --> 03:13:21.981
TO PRESIDENT BIDEN WINNING THE 
ELECTION AND THEY KNEW THIS WAS 

03:13:22.181 --> 03:13:24.417
THE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING AND 

03:13:24.621 --> 03:13:26.538
THESE PROCEEDINGS IS THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER'S SHOWING 

03:13:26.539 --> 03:13:31.359
THAT IT WAS KNOWN AMONG TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS. WE WERE SEEING 

03:13:32.135 --> 03:13:35.700
TWEETS WHERE ONE SUPPORTER SAID 
THE CALVARY IS COMING, MR. 

03:13:35.905 --> 03:13:40.623
PRESIDENT. THEY ARE ESTABLISHING
THIS IDEA THAT IT IS 

03:13:41.383 --> 03:13:43.383
PREMEDITATED AND

03:13:46.546 --> 03:13:48.802
MORE ORGANIZED THAN PEOPLE JUST 
TUNING IN TO SEE PEOPLE ON THE 

03:13:49.005 --> 03:13:51.005
LAWN OF THE CAPITOL AND BREAKING
IN 

03:13:55.820 --> 03:13:58.058
. THIS WAS A SLOW CREEP THROUGH 
THE LAST PART OF THE 

03:13:58.272 --> 03:14:00.272
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
AS WELL AS THE WEEKS BEFORE JOE 

03:14:00.371 --> 03:14:02.468
BIDEN WAS INAUGURATED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT LOOKS LIKE WE JUST SAW 

03:14:02.687 --> 03:14:04.687
SENATOR HOLLY IN THE BACKGROUND 
SORT OF SWORN

03:14:09.886 --> 03:14:12.191
SWARMED BY REPORTERS. WE DON'T 
HAVE AS MANY EYES AND EARS IN 

03:14:12.403 --> 03:14:15.089
THE HOUSE CHAMBER AS WE NORMALLY
WOULD WITH COVID RESTRICTIONS. 

03:14:15.495 --> 03:14:18.153
THEY ARE REALLY ACTING AS THE 
EYES AND EARS OF ALL OF US. THE 

03:14:18.369 --> 03:14:23.688
SENATE CONTROLS THE CAMERAS. THE
REASON YOU DON'T SEE THE CAMERA 

03:14:23.902 --> 03:14:26.937
PAN AROUND THE ROOM TO SHOW 
EVERYONE IS NOT THE DECISION OF 

03:14:27.093 --> 03:14:34.234
ANY BUDDY, IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
DECISION OF CONGRESS. WE CAN SEE

03:14:36.468 --> 03:14:40.133
IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE ARE 
PLAYING AT PAYING ATTENTION. I 

03:14:40.337 --> 03:14:46.058
HEARD FROM JOSH HAWLEY THAT HE 
IS NOT PAYING ATTENTION. 

03:14:46.059 --> 03:14:50.358
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I JUST GOT A MESSAGE FROM HIS
TEAM SAYING THAT HE WAS PAYING 

03:14:50.560 --> 03:14:54.669
ATTENTION AND LOOKING AT THE 
BRIEFS. THEY ARE PUSHING BACK ON

03:14:55.425 --> 03:15:01.059
THAT CHARACTERIZATION. LAST 
NIGHT WHEN WE SAW THAT VOTE, ALL

03:15:01.273 --> 03:15:06.743
OF THE SENATORS BOAT AT THEIR 
DESKS WHICH IS UNUSUAL. BECAUSE 

03:15:06.875 --> 03:15:08.875
OF

03:15:10.489 --> 03:15:12.489
SOCIAL DISTANCING. SOME OF THE 
CENTERS, INCLUDING

03:15:17.886 --> 03:15:21.563
JOSH HAWLEY HAVE BEEN IN THE  
GALLERY. SOME ARE SPREAD OUT IN 

03:15:22.326 --> 03:15:24.326
THE GALLERY

03:15:28.155 --> 03:15:30.404
AND THIS TIME, SOME ARE ALLOWED 
TO BE IN THE CLOAKROOM WHICH 

03:15:30.606 --> 03:15:33.290
MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE 
DIRECTLY ON THE FLOOR. I PROMISE

03:15:33.493 --> 03:15:35.969
TO OUR VIEWERS THAT WE WOULD 
LOVE TO KNOW, AS MUCH AS THEM, 

03:15:36.186 --> 03:15:41.043
WHEN THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS WHEN THERE IS A TWEET 

03:15:41.177 --> 03:15:45.766
CRITICIZING MITCH McCONNELL, WE 
WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIS FACIAL 

03:15:45.898 --> 03:15:50.938
EXPRESSION AND ALL OF THOSE WHO 
WERE NAME CHECKED IN THE LAST 

03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:53.819
FEW HOURS. IT IS ONE OF THE 
FRUSTRATING THINGS THAT WE DON'T

03:15:54.021 --> 03:15:59.150
HAVE THAT VISIBILITY. WE HAVE 
EVEN LESS VISIBILITY AND WE NEED

03:15:59.353 --> 03:16:02.026
THE REAL-TIME REACTION THAT WE 
DID DURING THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT

03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:04.229
TRIAL A YEAR AGO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:16:07.379 --> 03:16:09.379
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WE HEARD CONGRESSMAN

03:16:13.715 --> 03:16:15.775
SWALWELL MAKING A POINT THAT 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ALL THE 

03:16:15.974 --> 03:16:18.263
PROTESTERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE 
WHO CAME TO WASHINGTON, D.C.  TO

03:16:18.465 --> 03:16:20.897
DEMONSTRATE AND SHOW THEIR 
SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND TO 

03:16:21.025 --> 03:16:23.025
PROTEST THE RESULTS OF THE 
ELECTION

03:16:27.297 --> 03:16:29.297
. SO, HE IS TRYING TO 
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE

03:16:29.335 --> 03:16:35.319
WHO CAME TO D.C.. FOR THOSE WHO 
WANT TO MARCH THROUGH 

03:16:35.948 --> 03:16:39.690
AND STORMED THE CAPITOL . WHY IS
THAT IMPORTANT?

03:16:43.287 --> 03:16:45.808
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU 
DID HAVE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OF

03:16:46.009 --> 03:16:50.737
DEMONSTRATORS, AT FIRST,  WHO 
WERE NOT PART OF ANY SORT OF 

03:16:50.939 --> 03:16:53.006
ORGANIZING TO GET INTO THE 
CAPITOL . THERE HAS BEEN VIDEO 

03:16:53.222 --> 03:16:58.394
TO SHOW HOW THERE WAS A BATTLE 
BETWEEN THOSE OUTSIDE WHO WANTED

03:16:58.609 --> 03:17:04.802
TO COME IN AND OTHERS WHO SAID, 
I DIDN'T COME FOR THIS AND I 

03:17:05.013 --> 03:17:08.354
JUST CAME TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT DOES SHOW IN

03:17:08.559 --> 03:17:10.559
A WAY THAT THERE WAS 
DISORGANIZATION IN THE MINDS OF 

03:17:10.632 --> 03:17:13.139
THE GROUP THAT GATHERED AT THE 
CAPITOL . SOME DID NOT SIGN UP 

03:17:13.343 --> 03:17:15.343
TO COME IN

03:17:19.697 --> 03:17:22.347
.  SO, I BELIEVE THAT  ERIC 
SWALWELL WAS TRYING TO SHOW SOME

03:17:22.548 --> 03:17:24.582
OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN 
THE CHAMBER  THAT IT IS 

03:17:24.784 --> 03:17:27.470
UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERYONE WAS NOT
HERE TO BE VIOLENT. HOWEVER, 

03:17:27.668 --> 03:17:33.181
THERE WAS A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 
WHO CAME IN BY FORCE, OR FOLLOW 

03:17:33.382 --> 03:17:35.659
THE PEOPLE WHO CAME IN BY FORCE 
AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE 

03:17:35.874 --> 03:17:38.548
CULPABLE IN ALL OF THIS. THERE 
WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE GENUINELY 

03:17:38.764 --> 03:17:40.801
HERE BECAUSE THEY HEARD THERE 
WOULD BE A SPEECH FROM PRESIDENT

03:17:41.003 --> 03:17:43.134
TRUMP AND THEY WOULD BE HERE TO 
SUPPORT HIM.

03:17:48.430 --> 03:17:51.088
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE POINT IS THAT THERE WERE 
PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE MALL BUT 

03:17:51.288 --> 03:17:54.600
DID NOT RAMPAGE THE CAPITOL . 
WHETHER OR NOT YOU PUNCHED A 

03:17:54.805 --> 03:17:56.871
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER OR ATTACK
SOMEONE OR FOLLOW THEM, YOU WERE

03:17:57.087 --> 03:17:59.824
STILL BREAKING THE LAW AND 
COMING ONTO THIS PROPERTY

03:18:03.037 --> 03:18:05.931
. IT IS UP TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH 

03:18:06.690 --> 03:18:10.452
THOSE INDIVIDUALS.  BUT,  ERIC 
SWALWELL SEEMS TO BE SAYING IT 

03:18:10.666 --> 03:18:13.284
IS NOT ABOUT ALL REPUBLICANS  
AND EVEN ALL ABOUT THE 

03:18:13.462 --> 03:18:15.462
PROTESTERS.

03:18:18.043 --> 03:18:19.703
WE HAVE SEEN SOME LEADING 
REPUBLICANS ON CONSERVATIVE 

03:18:19.704 --> 03:18:23.841
TELEVISION TRYING TO PAINT THIS 
AS AN ATTACK OF ALL VOTERS OF 

03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:26.600
PRESIDENT TRUMP

03:18:29.172 --> 03:18:31.230
. IF YOU SUPPORTED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, YOU ARE LUMPED INTO THIS 

03:18:31.448 --> 03:18:33.684
AND YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY PART OF 
THE MOB THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING 

03:18:33.890 --> 03:18:36.668
AFTER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. WHAT I WAS STRUCK

03:18:36.829 --> 03:18:38.829
ABOUT

03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:48.635
THE TONE WAS THAT IT WAS ALMOST 
SYMPATHETIC TO THE RANK-AND-FILE

03:18:49.038 --> 03:18:51.038
TRUMP SUPPORTERS. TO SAY THEY 
WERE BEING MISLED

03:18:55.426 --> 03:18:57.698
. THEY SAID THAT A COUPLE OF 
TIMES. TRUMP LIED TO HIS 

03:18:57.900 --> 03:19:02.023
SUPPORTERS AND TOLD THEM THERE 
WAS THIS FRAUD. YOU KNOW, THEY 

03:19:02.228 --> 03:19:04.228
ARE ALMOST FRAMING THEM AS 
VICTIMS OF THIS CONSPIRACY BY 

03:19:04.873 --> 03:19:10.787
TRUMP TO GET THEM PASSIONATE AND
PROVOKE THEM BASED ON FALSE 

03:19:10.924 --> 03:19:13.629
PRETENSES. SO, I DID NOTICE

03:19:17.614 --> 03:19:20.199
THERE WAS A COUPLE OF MOMENTS, 
EVEN IN THE PHRASEOLOGY THAT 

03:19:20.337 --> 03:19:27.860
TRUMP IS THE DEFENDANT HERE AND 
NOT THE PEOPLE WHO STORMED THE 

03:19:28.842 --> 03:19:34.453
CAPITOL . THIS IS NOT CALLING 
TRUMP SUPPORTERS, OR HALF OF 

03:19:35.217 --> 03:19:39.776
THEM, DEPLORABLE'S. IT IS SAYING
THAT TRUMP HIMSELF WAS 

03:19:40.183 --> 03:19:43.855
DANGEROUSLY PLOTTING AND TRYING 
TO PROVOKE THIS MOB TO STOP THE 

03:19:44.058 --> 03:19:46.058
PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER

03:19:51.247 --> 03:19:52.879
.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING IN OUR COLLEAGUE,

03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:55.133
HANNAH JEWELL WHO STORMED THE 
CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6 . SO YOU 

03:19:55.892 --> 03:20:01.080
HEARD THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 
WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU? 

03:20:01.081 --> 03:20:08.058
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS JAMES WAS SAYING, DESPITE 
NOT BEING ON TRIAL,  THE CAPITOL

03:20:08.459 --> 03:20:10.459
RILES  WRITERS ARE PART OF THIS

03:20:15.618 --> 03:20:16.642
TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 

03:20:16.643 --> 03:20:19.500
TODAY, HAVE REFERRED REPEATEDLY 
TO THE STATEMENTS OF THE CAPITOL

03:20:20.137 --> 03:20:22.137
WRITERS  THEMSELVES WHO 
COMMITTED CRIMES THAT DAY

03:20:25.473 --> 03:20:28.753
. THE PRESIDENT TRUMP REQUESTED 
WE BE IN D.C. ON THAT DAY. I 

03:20:28.970 --> 03:20:31.401
THOUGHT I WAS FOLLOWING THE 
PRESIDENT AND DOING WHAT I WAS 

03:20:31.602 --> 03:20:36.513
CALLED TO DO. THINGS THAT THE 
WRITERS SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

03:20:36.715 --> 03:20:40.675
OR IN INTERVIEWS TO THE PRESS, 
IN FACT. IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE

03:20:42.217 --> 03:20:49.354
RIOTERS FEELING THEY WERE NOT 
DOING ANYTHING WRONG. SO, AS 

03:20:49.557 --> 03:20:52.418
REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO AND THE 
OTHERS REPEATED, HE SAID HIS 

03:20:52.618 --> 03:20:54.618
COMMANDS LED TO THEIR ACTIONS

03:20:58.555 --> 03:21:00.820
.  IN FACT, WE ARE SEEING SOME 
OF THE CAPITOL RIOTERS, 

03:21:01.024 --> 03:21:03.024
THEMSELVES  USE THIS ARGUMENT

03:21:06.126 --> 03:21:09.135
IN THEIR DEFENSES IN THEIR COURT
CASES. THE LAWYER FOR ONE OF THE

03:21:09.312 --> 03:21:13.917
MEMBERS ACTUALLY SAID HIS CLIENT
WAS ONE OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

03:21:14.674 --> 03:21:19.193
WHO WERE MISLED BY THE 
PRESIDENT'S DECEPTION. 

03:21:19.194 --> 03:21:23.097
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HIS CLIENT AND OTHERS LIKE 
HIM WILL LIKELY SPEND YEARS OF 

03:21:23.314 --> 03:21:27.458
THEIR LIVES IN PRISON WHILE 
DONALD TRUMP RESUMES HIS LIFE OF

03:21:27.672 --> 03:21:32.224
LUXURY AND PRIVILEGE.  THAT IS 
THE WORDS OF ONE OF THE LAWYERS 

03:21:32.443 --> 03:21:35.694
FOR ONE OF THE CAPITOL RIOTERS .
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE REMAINS 

03:21:35.910 --> 03:21:38.761
IMPORTANT TO THE TRIAL AND WHY 
THEY DID WHAT THEY DID. WE ARE 

03:21:38.967 --> 03:21:43.088
LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHO THEY ARE
AND THEIR BACKGROUNDS. ANOTHER 

03:21:43.302 --> 03:21:45.538
INTERESTING THING WE LEARNED 
TODAY ABOUT THE CAPITOL RIOTERS 

03:21:49.710 --> 03:21:51.762
AND AN EXCLUSIVE WASHINGTON POST
REPORT IS THAT 60% OF THOSE 

03:21:51.976 --> 03:21:53.976
ARRESTED HAD A HISTORY OF 
FINANCIAL TROUBLE OF SOME KIND 

03:21:54.075 --> 03:21:57.945
OR THAT INCLUDED BANKRUPTCY AND 
TAX PROBLEMS. EVEN THE WOMAN WHO

03:21:58.145 --> 03:22:00.145
TOOK A PRIVATE CHECKED

03:22:04.953 --> 03:22:06.823
TO WASHINGTON FROM TEXAS, HAD 
TAX AND BANKRUPTCY PROBLEMS 

03:22:06.824 --> 03:22:09.433
HERSELF. THIS IS COMING TO THE 
SOURCE OF WHAT COULD CAUSE 

03:22:09.563 --> 03:22:12.792
PEOPLE, WHETHER WAS THE 
PRESIDENT'S WORDS OR NOT, TO DO 

03:22:12.993 --> 03:22:16.980
THIS VIOLENT ACT. AT LEAST 30 OF
THE PEOPLE CHARGE SO FAR

03:22:21.031 --> 03:22:23.839
, AT LEAST 30 WERE MILITARY 
VETERANS AND A FEW WERE ACTIVE 

03:22:23.968 --> 03:22:26.854
RESERVISTS. BECAUSE OF THIS, 
SECRETARY AUSTIN HAS IMPLEMENTED

03:22:29.257 --> 03:22:33.381
A MILITARY WIDE STANDDOWN ORDER 
TO URGENTLY ADDRESS FAR RIGHT 

03:22:33.595 --> 03:22:38.986
EXTREMISM IN THE RANKS OF THE 
ARMED FORCES. I AM SURE THIS 

03:22:39.187 --> 03:22:41.433
WILL NOT BE THE LAST THAT WE 
HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE WRITERS 

03:22:42.204 --> 03:22:44.204
THEMSELVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TALKING ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT 

03:22:44.312 --> 03:22:49.781
THE MILITARY IS DOING ITSELF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND I WANTED TO MENTION BRUCE

03:22:49.912 --> 03:22:56.363
CASTOR, ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE SAID, YOU 

03:22:56.496 --> 03:22:58.496
WON'T HEAR ANYBODY SAY

03:23:03.802 --> 03:23:05.862
THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS OKAY. HE 
WAS TRYING TO SEPARATE PRESIDENT

03:23:06.071 --> 03:23:08.755
TRUMP FROM THOSE WHO PHYSICALLY 
DID THE ACTIONS. SO, WHAT WILL 

03:23:08.970 --> 03:23:11.421
YOU BE LISTENING FOR IN A COUPLE
DAYS TIME WHEN WE MOVED TO 

03:23:11.622 --> 03:23:16.569
HEARING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ATTORNEYS GIVE HIS RELATIONSHIP 

03:23:16.972 --> 03:23:19.387
TO THE ACCUSED? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I IMAGINE THERE WILL HAVE TO 

03:23:19.522 --> 03:23:21.522
BE

03:23:23.319 --> 03:23:25.319
AN INTENSE OLYMPIC LEVEL OF 
CHERRY PICKING AMONG THE 

03:23:25.728 --> 03:23:30.310
STATEMENTS OF THOSE CHARGE SO 
FAR IN THE RIOT AND WHAT THEY 

03:23:31.073 --> 03:23:33.979
HAVE SAID.  OF COURSE, WITH SO 
MANY PEOPLE ATTACKING THE 

03:23:34.738 --> 03:23:39.093
CAPITOL , THERE ARE SOME WHO I 
AM SURE DID GO FOR THE PROTESTS 

03:23:39.299 --> 03:23:41.299
AND THEN THOUGHT, WERE NOT 
ALLOWED TO

03:23:45.817 --> 03:23:48.530
-- OH, WE ARE GOING IN HERE NOW.
YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE DOING THAT. 

03:23:48.731 --> 03:23:53.266
THEN YOU HAVE GROUPS FROM THE 
MILITIA QUOTING THE PRESENT'S 

03:23:53.468 --> 03:23:55.468
WORDS THAT IT'S HARD TO SEPARATE
THE PRESIDENT FROM THAT. 

03:23:55.490 --> 03:23:57.545
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
HAS DONE A LOT TO SEPARATE 

03:23:57.747 --> 03:24:02.011
HIMSELF FROM THE WRITERS. HE 
SAID HE LOVED TO THE RIOTERS ON 

03:24:02.771 --> 03:24:06.314
THE DAY WHERE HE FINALLY CAME 
OUT TO SPEAK ON JANUARY 6. SO, 

03:24:06.521 --> 03:24:08.521
I'M LOOKING FOR

03:24:13.495 --> 03:24:15.202
OLYMPIC STYLE CHERRY PICKING, 
FOR SURE. 

03:24:15.203 --> 03:24:21.708
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH HANNAH 
JEWELL FOR THAT. THERE WAS ALSO 

03:24:22.488 --> 03:24:27.611
THIS STANDDOWN THAT WAS A 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WIDE 

03:24:27.742 --> 03:24:29.742
STANDDOWN

03:24:35.043 --> 03:24:37.538
. TO LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF 
WHERE EXTREMISM IS IN THE RANKS.

03:24:37.756 --> 03:24:39.886
CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY

03:24:44.744 --> 03:24:46.789
. A REPORT CAME OUT FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

03:24:46.991 --> 03:24:48.991
IN 2009, SHORTLY AFTER BARACK 
OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT AND IT 

03:24:49.026 --> 03:24:52.916
WARNED OF POTENTIAL RIGHT WING 
EXTREMISM FROM PEOPLE WHO CAME 

03:24:53.102 --> 03:24:55.102
BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
TO BECOME RADICALIZED TO SUPPORT

03:24:55.560 --> 03:25:00.266
RIGHT WING FRINGE GROUPS. THERE 
WAS BLOWBACK FROM A LOT 

03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:02.469
INCLUDING CENTERS IN THIS TRIAL

03:25:07.838 --> 03:25:09.838
. THE DHS SECRETARY APOLOGIZED 
AND THEY RETRACTED THE GUIDANCE.

03:25:09.900 --> 03:25:11.964
IT HAD A CHILLING EFFECT, FOR 
THE LAST DECADE. IT REALLY 

03:25:12.161 --> 03:25:15.470
PROMPTED A LOT OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO LOOK THE

03:25:16.233 --> 03:25:18.849
OTHER WAY AT TROUBLING SIGNS OF 
RADICALIZATION

03:25:22.858 --> 03:25:25.249
AND EXTREMISM. ESPECIALLY ON THE
RIGHT AND AMONG FORMER MILITARY 

03:25:25.387 --> 03:25:29.359
TYPES. MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE
INVOLVED IN THIS MOB AND THIS 

03:25:29.493 --> 03:25:32.903
RIOT. NOW THE PENDULUM IS 
SWINGING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION 

03:25:33.106 --> 03:25:37.235
AND THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION TO
LOOK AT THE HOTBEDS OF 

03:25:37.437 --> 03:25:41.336
RADICALIZATION. THERE HAS BEEN A
BIG PROLIFERATION OF EXTREMIST 

03:25:41.540 --> 03:25:45.209
GROUPS AND MILITIAS. THERE IS A 
LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF 

03:25:45.966 --> 03:25:49.459
THESE MILITIAS, WITH NAMES LIKE 
THE 3% ERRORS

03:25:53.841 --> 03:25:55.688
ARE COORDINATING WITH OTHER 
MILITIAS LIKE THE OATH KEEPERS 

03:25:55.689 --> 03:25:58.182
AND THAT THEY WERE HAVING RALLY 
POINTS BEFORE JANUARY 6 WHERE 

03:25:58.385 --> 03:26:00.872
THEY WERE HAVING KIND OF 
CARAVANS COMING TO WASHINGTON. 

03:26:01.074 --> 03:26:09.661
SO, THE GOVERNOR AND GOVERNMENT 
IS PART OF THE DRAGNET EXPLORING

03:26:09.881 --> 03:26:11.881
THE MOTIVES AND HOW PEOPLE 
DRIFTED INTO THESE GROUPS. THIS 

03:26:12.499 --> 03:26:14.499
IS SIGNIFICANT

03:26:20.521 --> 03:26:22.787
,  LIBBY, BECAUSE IT COULD ALLOW
THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING MORE 

03:26:23.003 --> 03:26:24.874
SERIOUS CHARGES RELATED TO 
CONSPIRACY THAT GO BEYOND JUST 

03:26:24.875 --> 03:26:26.520
BREACHING THE CAPITOL  AND 
GETTING INTO POTENTIALLY 

03:26:26.521 --> 03:26:30.623
SEDITION WHICH IS A LAW WHERE 
THERE IS A PENALTY OF A 

03:26:30.822 --> 03:26:34.905
MANDATORY 20 YEARS. SO, THAT IS 
WHERE THIS INVESTIGATION IS 

03:26:35.039 --> 03:26:39.449
GOING. BUT IT IS PRETTY CLEAR 
THE COUNTRY WILL BE GRAPPLING 

03:26:39.661 --> 03:26:43.432
WITH THIS EXTREMISM THREAT FOR A
LONG TIME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

03:26:46.855 --> 03:26:51.734
POLLS, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS
, AND THIS IS NOT TO SAY THE 

03:26:51.869 --> 03:26:54.866
REPUBLICANS ARE EXTREMIST BY ANY
MEASURE. MANY BELIEVE THAT JOE 

03:26:55.066 --> 03:27:00.389
BIDEN DID NOT WIN THE ELECTION 
FAIR AND SQUARE. THERE IS A 

03:27:00.590 --> 03:27:02.590
SIGNIFICANT SWATH OF

03:27:05.561 --> 03:27:07.561
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP AS

03:27:07.622 --> 03:27:09.480
LEGITIMATE AND THAT HAS BEEN 
ENCOURAGED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

03:27:09.481 --> 03:27:11.747
THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE SOME OF THE

03:27:11.951 --> 03:27:15.228
PEOPLE IN THAT CADRE MAY PURSUE 
EXTREMISM BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE

03:27:15.446 --> 03:27:19.780
THE GOVERNMENT AS LEGITIMATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK AND LISTEN TO 

03:27:19.998 --> 03:27:23.895
SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY 
LEAD HOUSE OF PEACE MANAGER, 

03:27:24.652 --> 03:27:26.652
JAMIE RASKIN

03:27:29.060 --> 03:27:31.913
. THIS IS THE CASE THAT NOT ONLY
DID DONALD TRUMP HAVE A ROLE IN 

03:27:32.116 --> 03:27:33.774
WHAT HAPPENED JANUARY 6, HE WAS 
THE RINGLEADER. 

03:27:33.775 --> 03:27:38.482
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW YOU 
THAT X PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NO 

03:27:39.241 --> 03:27:41.241
INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

03:27:43.986 --> 03:27:46.036
IT WILL SHOW THAT HE CLEARLY AND
CITED THE JANUARY 6 

03:27:46.253 --> 03:27:49.058
INSURRECTION. IT WILL SHOW THAT 
DONALD TRUMP SURRENDERED HIS 

03:27:49.199 --> 03:27:54.809
ROLE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND 
BECAME THE INSIGHTS OR IN 

03:27:55.821 --> 03:28:01.847
A DANGEROUS INSURRECTION. THIS 
WAS, AS A COLLEAGUE PUT IT SO 

03:28:02.263 --> 03:28:06.611
COGENTLY ON JANUARY 6, ITSELF, 
THE GREATEST PORTRAYAL OF THE 

03:28:07.374 --> 03:28:12.089
PRESIDENTIAL OATH IN THE HISTORY
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

03:28:12.090 --> 03:28:21.334
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS IMPEACHMENT MANAGER,
CONGRESSMAN RASKIN . LET'S GO TO

03:28:21.536 --> 03:28:23.635
WHAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE 

03:28:23.836 --> 03:28:27.929
AFTERNOON AND THE EVENING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE REST OF THE DAY WILL BE 

03:28:28.133 --> 03:28:31.045
MUCH LIKE WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE 
PAST COUPLE OF HOURS WHERE THE 

03:28:31.260 --> 03:28:33.260
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WILL 
CONTINUE TO LAY OUT THIS CASE IN

03:28:33.292 --> 03:28:36.196
THEIR OPENING ARGUMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT PROVOKED AND LED TO 

03:28:36.397 --> 03:28:44.175
THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL . 
THERE WILL BE MORE EVIDENCE AND 

03:28:44.390 --> 03:28:48.074
THERE WILL BE MORE OF A TIMELINE
OF TWEETS THAT FORMER PRESIDENT 

03:28:48.276 --> 03:28:55.881
TRUMP PUT OUT THERE IN THE DAYS 
LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6. THEY 

03:28:56.098 --> 03:28:58.165
WILL CONTINUE ON DISCUSSING THIS
AND USING VISUAL AIDS WHICH SEEM

03:28:58.381 --> 03:29:00.381
TO BE QUITE POWERFUL

03:29:04.713 --> 03:29:06.713
. SINCE YESTERDAY WHEN THEY 
UTILIZED THE LONG MONTAGE REAL 

03:29:06.794 --> 03:29:09.075
OF THE CLIPS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
OF THE CAPITOL. THIS IS HAVING 

03:29:09.292 --> 03:29:14.634
SOME IMPACT . THEY DO HAVE THEIR
CASE VERY WELL LAID OUT, 

03:29:14.841 --> 03:29:16.989
VISUALLY. WE ARE GOING TO SEE 
MORE OF THAT

03:29:21.033 --> 03:29:23.092
AND WE EXPECT TO SEE NEVER 
BEFORE SEEN SECURITY FOOTAGE OF 

03:29:23.294 --> 03:29:25.294
WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW 
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE THE RIOTERS 

03:29:25.509 --> 03:29:30.724
WERE TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND 
FORMER VP PENN SAYS WELL. 

03:29:30.725 --> 03:29:35.682
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST SAW MITCH McCONNELL 
ENTER THE CHAMBER. WE WILL BRING

03:29:35.884 --> 03:29:37.884
THIS TO YOU LIVE IN 
UNINTERRUPTED. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD

03:29:37.945 --> 03:29:42.866
THERE WILL BE TWO RAKES AND A 
DINNER BREAK THIS EVENING. 

03:29:43.083 --> 03:29:45.346
DURING THAT TIME, THE TEAM WILL 
BE HERE TALKING ABOUT THE LATEST

03:29:45.547 --> 03:29:47.547
NEWS AS WELL AS

03:29:55.433 --> 03:29:57.064
GETTING THE BREAKING NEWS 
STORIES RELATED TO THE 

03:29:57.065 --> 03:29:59.065
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS AND THE 
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY

03:29:59.112 --> 03:30:01.183
6. WE WILL GET THE NEWS 
SURROUNDING THAT AS WELL . 

03:30:01.399 --> 03:30:04.289
JAMES, AS WE GET CLOSE TO 2:00, 
I WANT TO GO TO YOU FOR REALLY 

03:30:04.692 --> 03:30:06.692
THE BARRAGE OF EXAMPLES

03:30:12.723 --> 03:30:15.694
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHRONICLING AND CALLING OUT 
HIS FALSE ONGOING AS THEY CAME, 

03:30:15.805 --> 03:30:19.882
BUT WHEN YOU SEE THEM ALL LINED 
UP TOGETHER, RATHER THAN SORT OF

03:30:19.995 --> 03:30:23.846
A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE. IT 
REALLY IS ASTOUNDING TO SEE THE 

03:30:23.976 --> 03:30:29.246
MAN WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES REFUSING TO ACCEPT

03:30:29.465 --> 03:30:33.838
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY LIBBY, AND SAYING 

03:30:33.948 --> 03:30:38.145
FOR MONTHS THAT HE WOULDN'T. 
NO MATTER WHAT. THERE WAS NO WAY

03:30:38.458 --> 03:30:40.495
HE COULD LOSE. IF HE LOST IT 
COULD BE ONLY BECAUSE OF FRAUD. 

03:30:40.608 --> 03:30:45.228
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS BEHIND 
IN THE POLLS AND WE WERE ALL 

03:30:45.357 --> 03:30:49.087
AWARE OF THE FACT -- SORRY TO 
INTERRUPT JAMES THAT A LOT OF 

03:30:49.213 --> 03:30:53.352
THE MAIL IN VOTING THAT WOULD BE
TAKING PLACE OR EARLY VOTING 

03:30:53.466 --> 03:30:57.941
BECAUSE OF THE COVID-19 AND 
TRYING TO ALLOW MORE AMERICANS 

03:30:58.051 --> 03:31:00.063
TO VOTE WOULD CHANGE HOW WE WERE
GETTING RESULTS ON ELECTION 

03:31:00.366 --> 03:31:01.196
NIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY, WE WERE TALKING 

03:31:01.197 --> 03:31:06.244
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS
AND THE -- FORMER PRESIDENT TOOK

03:31:06.355 --> 03:31:08.355
ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND HE PRIMED
PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE 

03:31:09.181 --> 03:31:13.443
ELECTION WAS GOING TO BE RIGGED.
HE DECLINED TO COMMIT TO THE 

03:31:13.558 --> 03:31:16.080
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. 
INCLUDING DURING THE FIRST 

03:31:16.204 --> 03:31:18.204
DEBATE. AND SO I THINK LIBBY, 
BIGGER PICTURE WHAT 

03:31:21.518 --> 03:31:25.033
WE SAW IN THIS OPENING SALVO 
THIS AFTERNOON WAS THAT 

03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:28.274
PREDICATE. REALLY IS KIND OF 
EVEN COVERING THE STUFF 

03:31:28.472 --> 03:31:33.042
DAY-TO-DAY AMAZING TO PUT IT 
BACK TOGETHER. WE FORGET SO MANY

03:31:33.151 --> 03:31:35.151
OF THE EXAMPLES. AS CASTRO SAID 
AT SOME POINT, THE CONGRESSMAN 

03:31:35.473 --> 03:31:38.632
FROM TEXAS, THERE ARE DOZENS AND
DOZENS OF MORE TWEETS AND 

03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:41.646
STATEMENTS LIKE THIS FROM 
RALLIES BUT YOU GET THE PICTURE.

03:31:41.754 --> 03:31:45.003
EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE 
ELECTION AND JANUARY 6th AND 

03:31:45.113 --> 03:31:48.983
YESTERDAY WE SAW SOME OF THE 
SPEECH THAT DIRECTLY PRECEDED 

03:31:49.108 --> 03:31:52.528
THE SIEGE OF THE CAPITOL. AND I 
THINK THIS AFTERNOON, WE'RE 

03:31:52.927 --> 03:31:56.489
GOING TO START TO GET INTO WHAT 
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6th. 

03:31:56.663 --> 03:32:00.473
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS NEVER 
BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGE IS GOING TO 

03:32:00.595 --> 03:32:03.116
COME OUT. AND THEY'VE SORT OF 
TEED IT UP TO I 

03:32:06.726 --> 03:32:07.676
THINK PUNCH PRETTY HARD THIS 
AFTERNOON. 

03:32:07.677 --> 03:32:11.919
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT TRUE CONNECTION DID THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS NEED TO 

03:32:12.029 --> 03:32:15.380
MAKE, JAMES, BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, WHAT HE SAID AND WHAT HE 

03:32:15.493 --> 03:32:18.007
DID, AND THE ATTACK? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, WE SAW SOME 

03:32:18.124 --> 03:32:22.268
CLIPS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE 
INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK. 

03:32:22.381 --> 03:32:24.524
ESPECIALLY THIS WOMAN FROM 
DALLAS. THIS REALTOR JENNA RYAN.

03:32:24.630 --> 03:32:27.862
YOU KNOW SAYING TRUMP TOLD US TO
COME. SO THAT'S OUT THERE. 

03:32:28.027 --> 03:32:30.914
THAT'S PART OF THE PUBLIC 
RECORD. WE SAW A REALLY 

03:32:31.023 --> 03:32:33.361
INTERESTING MAP LAST WEEK WITH 
CELL PHONE DATA THAT TRACKED 

03:32:33.843 --> 03:32:36.380
PEOPLE'S LOCATIONS AND YOU CAN 
LITERALLY SEE THE DOTS FROM 

03:32:36.586 --> 03:32:40.662
PEOPLE STANDING AT TRUMP'S RALLY
ON THE ELLIPSE AND THEN ALL 

03:32:40.874 --> 03:32:43.873
MIGRATING INTO THE CAPITOL. SO I
THINK YOU WILL SEE SOME THINGS 

03:32:43.992 --> 03:32:47.032
LIKE THAT TO SHOW ONE THING LED 
DIRECTLY TO THE OTHER. AND THAT 

03:32:47.556 --> 03:32:51.388
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE THERE 
AS AGENTS OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT I

03:32:51.598 --> 03:32:54.851
THINK ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO 
SHOW, LIBBY, FOR DEMOCRATS HERE,

03:32:55.458 --> 03:33:00.628
IS THEY NEED TO DEMONSTRATE AND 
THEY MAY NOT GET TO THIS AT 

03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:03.616
LENGTH UNTIL TOMORROW, IS THAT 
TRUMP DIDN'T RESPOND. ONCE IT 

03:33:03.721 --> 03:33:07.333
WAS CLEAR THAT THE MOB HAD GONE 
IN, THAT THE CAPITOL HAD BEEN 

03:33:07.631 --> 03:33:10.509
BREACHED, THAT EVERYONE WAS IN 
DANGER AND TRUMP WASN'T TAKING 

03:33:10.784 --> 03:33:16.207
CALLS OR SENDING HELP, AND THEN 
TRUMP WAS SORT OF RELISHING THE 

03:33:16.318 --> 03:33:20.022
SHOW AS JAMIE RASKIN PUT IT. SO 
THAT'S -- WE'VE SEEN THE 

03:33:20.187 --> 03:33:23.362
PREDICATE. NOW WE'LL SEE JANUARY
6th AND THEN I THINK WE'LL SEE 

03:33:23.567 --> 03:33:29.126
THE KIND OF THE HOURS AFTER THE 
CAPITOL WAS BREACHED. HOW TRUMP 

03:33:29.437 --> 03:33:31.402
DIDN'T ACT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND WE JUST SAW PRESIDENT 

03:33:31.403 --> 03:33:34.406
TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM 

03:33:37.643 --> 03:33:39.682
HEAD BACK INTO THE CHAMBER. 
JAMES, AFTER -- REALLY 

03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:42.829
DISASTROUS DAY BY TRUMP'S LEGAL 
TEAM YESTERDAY. HOW ARE THEY 

03:33:42.957 --> 03:33:45.087
SORT OF SCRAMMENING AND 
PRETEARING TO THINK ABOUT THE 

03:33:45.199 --> 03:33:47.036
NEXT STEPS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

03:33:47.037 --> 03:33:51.710
FRUSTRATED. THE PRESIDENT WAS 
ANGRY HE FELT EMBARRASSED. BY 

03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:54.942
THESE FOLKS. LINDSAY GRAHAM SAID
THIS MORNING THAT HE TALKED WITH

03:33:55.144 --> 03:33:59.422
TRUMP AND REASSURED HIM THAT THE
TEAM WILL GET ITS SEA LEGS FOR 

03:33:59.602 --> 03:34:02.074
LATER THIS WEEK. I THINK THAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO HIT HARDER ON 

03:34:02.342 --> 03:34:05.838
THE POINT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT EARLIER WHICH WAS TO 

03:34:06.115 --> 03:34:08.643
STIPULATE THAT THE MOB WAS 
TERRIBLE. AND THAT ALL THE STUFF

03:34:08.850 --> 03:34:12.099
THAT HAPPENED IN THE CAPITOL WAS
AWFUL AND THEN TRY THE SAY THESE

03:34:12.273 --> 03:34:16.283
PEOPLE WERE ACTING ON THEIR OWN 
-- THEY WEREN'T ACTING ON BEHALF

03:34:16.675 --> 03:34:20.835
OF TRUMP. I THINK THEY'RE GOING 
TO TRY TO LEAN INTO THAT AS MUCH

03:34:20.963 --> 03:34:23.515
AS POSSIBLE AND I EXPECT THEY 
WILL TRY TO FIND SOME 

03:34:23.771 --> 03:34:26.220
VALIDATION. IN A LOT OF VIDEOS 
WE SAW FROM THE HOUSE 

03:34:26.332 --> 03:34:28.332
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WHERE YOU 
KNOW TRUMP SAYS THIS WILL BE 

03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:32.221
REMEMBERED AS A HISTORIC DAY. 
TRUMP ALSO SAID PLEASE, GO 

03:34:32.332 --> 03:34:33.132
PEACEFULLY. SO THEY'LL FOCUS ON 
THAT. 

03:34:33.133 --> 03:34:37.296
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT, JAMES, THANKS SO 
MUCH. LET'S GO BACK NOW TO THE 

03:34:37.407 --> 03:34:43.453
FLOOR OF THE SENATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU 

03:34:46.503 --> 03:34:48.503
COLLEAGUES AND MADELEINE 

03:34:51.201 --> 03:34:54.521
DEAN AND TED LIEU WILL NOW 
DETAIL PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

03:34:54.631 --> 03:34:56.631
INCREASINGLY DESPERATE ATTEMPTS 
TO STOP THE SALE. 

03:35:11.066 --> 03:35:13.440
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EST STEAMED MEMBERS OF THE 

03:35:13.554 --> 03:35:16.296
SENATE, IT IS MY SOLEMN HONOR TO
BE BEFORE YOU TODAY. 

03:35:20.762 --> 03:35:24.598
I AM MADELEINE DEAN 
CONGRESSWOMAN THE FROM THE 

03:35:24.709 --> 03:35:26.709
FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF
PENNSYLVANIA. I'M A LAWYER AND A

03:35:26.876 --> 03:35:30.616
FORMER PROFESSOR OF WRITING AND 
I'M A SISTER AND I'M A WIFE AND 

03:35:30.728 --> 03:35:37.975
I'M A MOTHER, I'M A GRANDMOTHER 
TO THREE, WITH FOURTH ON HER 

03:35:38.081 --> 03:35:42.686
WAY. I'M A PERSON OF FAITH AND 
I'M AN AMERICAN. ALONG WITH 

03:35:42.797 --> 03:35:47.472
MANAGER LIEU I WILL PRESENT THE 
ACTIONS OF A DESPERATE PRESIDENT

03:35:47.587 --> 03:35:50.925
AND WE WILL PRESENT EVIDENCE 
TODAY OF A CLASS OF PUBLIC 

03:35:51.634 --> 03:35:54.284
SERVANTS WHO STANDING UP TO 
ENORMOUS PRESSURE FROM THE 

03:35:54.472 --> 03:35:59.555
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
DID THE RIGHT THING AND UPHELD 

03:35:59.750 --> 03:36:04.612
THEIR OATHS. MY COLLEAGUES JUST 
PRESENTED EVIDENCE OF A 

03:36:05.014 --> 03:36:07.171
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MONTHS LONGS 
EFFORTS TO INCITE HIS BASE 

03:36:07.565 --> 03:36:10.295
LEADING THEM TO BELIEVE THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN. 

03:36:10.411 --> 03:36:16.292
THAT THEY NEEDED TO FIGHT LIKE 
HELL TO STOP THE STEAL ON 

03:36:16.406 --> 03:36:18.406
JANUARY THE 6th. THESE WEREN'T 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ONLY 

03:36:22.457 --> 03:36:25.722
EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS.
MANAGER LIEU AND I WILL PRESENT 

03:36:25.835 --> 03:36:29.968
EVIDENCE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
RELENTLESS ESCALATING CAMPAIGNS 

03:36:30.079 --> 03:36:36.969
TO FABRICATE AN ELECTION VICTORY
BY IGNORING ADVERSE COURT 

03:36:37.093 --> 03:36:40.033
RULINGS. PRESSURING AND 
THREATENING ELECTION OFFICIALS. 

03:36:40.152 --> 03:36:44.376
ATTACKING SENATORS AND MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS. PRESSURING THE 

03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:51.118
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND FINALLY, 
BULLYING HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT.

03:36:51.230 --> 03:36:57.418
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES 
FILED 62 SEPARATE LAWSUITS IN 

03:36:57.552 --> 03:37:02.770
FEDERAL COURTS ACROSS MORE THAN 
HALF A DOZEN STATES AND THE 

03:37:02.881 --> 03:37:09.044
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, INCLUDING 
PENNSYLVANIA, MY HOME STATE, AS 

03:37:09.164 --> 03:37:11.164
WELL AS ARIZONA, 

03:37:14.015 --> 03:37:16.015
GEORGIA, MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, 
NEVADA, AND WISCONSIN. OF THE 62

03:37:17.677 --> 03:37:21.312
POST ELECTION LEGAL CHALLENGE, 
HE LOST 61. ONLY ONE WAS 

03:37:21.517 --> 03:37:26.481
SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT CASE 
INVOLVED BALLOT CURING IN 

03:37:26.691 --> 03:37:32.588
PENNSYLVANIA. AND HAD NO IMPACT 
ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 80,555 VOTE

03:37:32.701 --> 03:37:38.593
VICTORY IN OUR COMMONWEALTH. 
TO BE CLEAR, NOT A SINGLE COURT,

03:37:38.707 --> 03:37:44.838
NOT A SINGLE JUDGE, AGREED THAT 
THE ELECTION RESULTS WERE 

03:37:44.953 --> 03:37:47.001
INVALID OR SHOULD BE 
INVALIDATED. INSTEAD, COURT 

03:37:47.115 --> 03:37:52.671
AFTER COURT REVIEWING THESE 
CHALLENGES, SAID THESE CASES 

03:37:53.687 --> 03:37:59.970
WERE QUOTE NOT CREDIBLE. WITHOUT
MERIT. BASED ON NOTHING BUT 

03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:03.519
SPECULATION. AND FLAT OUT WRONG.
THE JUDICIARY RESOUNDINGLY 

03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:06.302
REJECTED TRUMP'S FRAUD 
ALLEGATIONS AND UPHELD THE 

03:38:06.414 --> 03:38:11.825
ELECTION RESULTS. BUT IT WAS 
MORE THAN THAT. THE COURTS SAID 

03:38:12.035 --> 03:38:16.106
THESE CASES WERE DIFFERENT. THEY
WERE DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

03:38:16.213 --> 03:38:22.163
FOR AN EXAMPLE. IN AN OPINION BY
UNITED STATES' DISTRICT COURT 

03:38:22.275 --> 03:38:24.609
JUDGE MATTHEW BRAND FROM 
PENNSYLVANIA, HE SAID AND I 

03:38:24.717 --> 03:38:30.291
QUOTE -- THIS COURT HAS BEEN 
PRESENTED WITH STRAINED LEGAL 

03:38:32.298 --> 03:38:35.156
ARGUMENTS WITHOUT MERIT AND 
SPECULATIVE ACCUSATIONS. IN THE 

03:38:35.288 --> 03:38:39.408
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THIS 
CANNOT JUSTIFY THE 

03:38:39.529 --> 03:38:43.262
DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF A SINGLE 
VOTER. LET ALONE ALL THE VOTERS 

03:38:43.778 --> 03:38:49.661
OF ITS SIXTH MOST POPULATED 
STATE. OUR PEOPLE AND LAWS AND 

03:38:49.773 --> 03:38:51.708
INSTITUTIONS DEMAND MORE. 
BECAUSE THIS COURT HAS NO 

03:38:51.709 --> 03:38:56.772
AUTHORITY TO TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT
TO VOTE OF EVEN A SINGLE PERSON,

03:38:56.886 --> 03:39:02.436
LET ALONE MILLIONS OF CITIZENS, 
IT CANNOT GRANT PLAINTIFF'S 

03:39:02.552 --> 03:39:05.489
REQUESTED RELIEF. THAT DECISION 
BY JUDGE BRAWN WAS AFFIRMED 

03:39:09.847 --> 03:39:14.317
ON APPEAL BY JUDGE STEFANOS 
BEBES APPOINTEE WHO AGREED AND 

03:39:14.503 --> 03:39:17.457
WROTE I QUOTE -- THE NUMBER OF 
BALLOTS IT SPECIFICALLY 

03:39:17.563 --> 03:39:22.441
CHALLENGES IS FAR SMALLER THAN 
THE ROUGHLY 81,000 VOTE MARGIN 

03:39:23.327 --> 03:39:29.313
OF VICTORY. AND IT NEVER CLAIMS 
FRAUD. OR THAT ANY OF THE VOTES 

03:39:29.913 --> 03:39:34.477
WERE CAST BY ILLEGAL VOTERS. 
PLUS, TOSSING OUT MILLIONS OF 

03:39:34.601 --> 03:39:36.942
MAIL-IN BALLOTS WOULD BE 
DRASTIC. AND UNPRECEDENTED. 

03:39:37.048 --> 03:39:43.813
DISENFRANCHISING A HUGE SWATH OF
THE ELECTORATE. AND UPSETTING 

03:39:43.932 --> 03:39:47.452
ALL DOWN BALLOT RACES. END 
QUOTE. 

03:39:47.635 --> 03:39:52.582
SIMILARLY, AS JUDGE LINDA PARKER
OF THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF 

03:39:52.695 --> 03:39:57.239
MICHIGAN FRAMED IT, SHE SAID -- 
STUNNING IN ITS SCOPE, AND 

03:39:57.343 --> 03:40:01.907
BREATHTAKING IN ITS REACH, IF 
GRANTED, THE RELIEF WOULD 

03:40:02.015 --> 03:40:08.360
DISENFRANCHISE THE VOTES OF MORE
THAN 5.5 MILLION MICHIGAN 

03:40:08.537 --> 03:40:14.750
CITIZENS WHO, WITH DIGNITY AND 
HOPE AND A PROMISE OF A VOTE, 

03:40:14.882 --> 03:40:18.050
PARTICIPATED IN THE 2020 GENERAL
ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP TOLD HIS 

03:40:18.449 --> 03:40:24.829
SUPPORTERS THEY ARE STEALING THE
ELECTION. THEY TOOK AWAY YOUR 

03:40:26.075 --> 03:40:28.890
VOTE. IT'S RIGGED. THAT WAS NOT 
TRUE. ACCORDING TO JUDGE AFTER 

03:40:29.005 --> 03:40:35.388
JUDGE, THE TRUTH WAS EXACTLY THE
OPPOSITE. TRUMP WAS NOT SUING 

03:40:36.595 --> 03:40:38.595
ENSURE ELECTION INTEGRITY. HE 
WAS PURSUING LAWSUITS THAT WOULD

03:40:38.872 --> 03:40:43.732
IN EFFECT STRIP AWAY AMERICAN 
VOTES SO THAT HE COULD WIN. IN 

03:40:43.843 --> 03:40:48.263
OTHER WORDS, DONALD TRUMP WAS 
ASKING THE JUDICIARY TO TAKE 

03:40:48.377 --> 03:40:53.960
AWAY VOTES FROM AMERICANS, SO 
THAT HE COULD STEAL THE ELECTION

03:40:54.072 --> 03:40:57.582
FOR HIMSELF. THEN, AFTER LOSING 
IN ALL THE COURTS, TRUMP TURNED 

03:40:59.005 --> 03:41:00.740
TO ANOTHER TACTIC. PRESSURING 
AND THREATENING ELECTION 

03:41:00.741 --> 03:41:05.282
OFFICIALS. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED
IN MICHIGAN AFTER TRUMP ATTACKED

03:41:05.407 --> 03:41:08.626
THE STATE. AND ITS ELECTION 
OFFICIALS. HIS SUPPORTERS 

03:41:08.833 --> 03:41:12.894
SURROUNDED THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE'S HOME AS YOU SAW IN THE 

03:41:13.017 --> 03:41:18.988
EARLIER SLIDE, CHANTING, CALLING
HER A FELON. ON NOVEMBER 17th, 

03:41:19.114 --> 03:41:23.748
THE BOARD OF CANVASSERS FOR 
WAYNE COUNTY, MICHIGAN, HOME TO 

03:41:23.860 --> 03:41:28.098
DETROIT, UNANIMOUSLY CERTIFIED 
THE ELECTION RESULTS FOR BIDEN. 

03:41:28.210 --> 03:41:32.583
THAT SAME NIGHT, AFTER THEIR 
VOTE TO CERTIFY THE RESULTS, 

03:41:32.699 --> 03:41:36.527
TRUMP CALLED THE TWO REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF THAT BOARD, 

03:41:36.642 --> 03:41:41.251
PRESSURING THEM TO CHANGE THEIR 
MINDS. THE CALL WORKED. THE NEXT

03:41:42.289 --> 03:41:45.793
DAY, BOTH MONICA PALMER AND 
WILLIAM HARTMAN, THE REPUBLICAN 

03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:48.110
BOARD MEMBERS, ATTEMPTED TO 
RESCIND THEIR 

03:41:50.985 --> 03:41:53.310
VOTE TO CERTIFY MICHIGAN'S 
ELECTION RESULTS. BUT THEY 

03:41:54.018 --> 03:41:57.172
SIMPLY COULDN'T. PRESIDENT TRUMP
DIDN'T STOP THERE. HE THEN 

03:41:57.668 --> 03:42:03.253
CONTACTED MAJORITY LEADER OF THE
MICHIGAN SENATE, MIKE SHIRKY AND

03:42:03.433 --> 03:42:07.723
THE SPEAKER OF THE MICHIGAN 
HOUSE LEE CHATFIELD TO LOBBY 

03:42:08.434 --> 03:42:12.298
THEM TO OVERTURN MICHIGAN'S 
RESULTS. TRUMP INVITED MR. 

03:42:12.599 --> 03:42:17.772
CHATFIELD AND MR. SHIRKY TO 
WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH HIM AT 

03:42:17.890 --> 03:42:20.826
THE WHITE HOUSE. LET'S BE CLEAR,
DONALD TRUMP WAS CALLING 

03:42:20.947 --> 03:42:24.768
OFFICIALS, HOSTING THEM AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE, URGING THEM TO DEFY

03:42:25.786 --> 03:42:31.486
THE VOTERS IN THEIR STATE, AND 
INSTEAD AWARD VOTES TO TRUMP. 

03:42:31.597 --> 03:42:36.545
THE OFFICIALS HELD STRONG AND SO
TRUMP MOVED ON TO A DIFFERENT 

03:42:36.662 --> 03:42:41.204
STATE. MY HOME STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. I AM CERTAIN MY 

03:42:41.404 --> 03:42:43.662
SENATORS, CASEY AND SENATOR 
TOOMEY, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED 

03:42:43.770 --> 03:42:48.516
THERE. IN EARLY DECEMBER, AS HE 
DID IN MICHIGAN, HE BEGAN 

03:42:49.738 --> 03:42:52.563
CALLING ELECTION OFFICIALS 
INCLUDING MY FORMER COLLEAGUES 

03:42:53.079 --> 03:42:55.017
IN THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE.
REPUBLICANS, MAJORITY LEADER KIM

03:42:55.018 --> 03:42:59.265
WARD AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, 
BRIAN CUTLER. MAJORITY LEADER 

03:43:00.575 --> 03:43:04.734
WARD SAID THE PRESIDENT CALLED 
HER TO QUOTE DECLARE THERE WAS A

03:43:05.055 --> 03:43:11.644
FRAUD IN THE VOTING, END QUOTE. 
THEN ON NOVEMBER 25th, PRESIDENT

03:43:12.028 --> 03:43:15.385
TRUMP PHONED INTO A REPUBLICAN 
STATE SENATE POLICY HEARING, 

03:43:16.907 --> 03:43:19.269
TRYING TO CONVINCE THE 
REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS, 

03:43:19.387 --> 03:43:22.685
SENATORS, AND HOUSE MEMBERS, 
THERE HAD BEEN A FRAUD IN THE 

03:43:22.792 --> 03:43:25.752
VOTE. HE EVEN HAD HIS LAWYER 
HOLD A PHONE UP TO THE 

03:43:26.046 --> 03:43:29.092
MICROPHONE IN THAT HEARING ROOM 
SO THE COMMITTEE COULD HEAR HIM.

03:43:29.202 --> 03:43:31.202
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. 

03:43:33.139 --> 03:43:37.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE 
CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN FOR OUR 

03:43:37.719 --> 03:43:41.967
COUNTRY AND THIS ELECTION HAS TO
BE TURNED AROUND. BECAUSE WE WON

03:43:42.262 --> 03:43:44.648
PENNSYLVANIA BY LOT AND WE WON 
ALL OF THESE SWING STATES BY A 

03:43:44.769 --> 03:43:46.769
LOT. 

03:43:49.252 --> 03:43:52.107
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS WAS A GATHERING -- I 
HAVE ATTENDED MANY I HAVE TO 

03:43:52.214 --> 03:43:55.864
TELL YOU AS A FORMER STATE 
LEGISLATOR, A LOT OF POLICY 

03:43:55.978 --> 03:43:58.018
HEARINGS. I HAVE TO SAY WITH 
SOME CONFIDENCE THAT WAS LIKELY 

03:43:58.202 --> 03:44:01.052
THE FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

03:44:01.339 --> 03:44:05.501
CALLED INTO A STATE LEGISLATIVE 
POLICY HEARING. AND REMEMBER, 

03:44:05.614 --> 03:44:09.707
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE 
WON PENNSYLVANIA. AND 

03:44:10.062 --> 03:44:12.062
PENNSYLVANIA HAD BEEN CERTIFIED 
THAT BIDEN HAD 

03:44:14.850 --> 03:44:18.408
WON BY MORE THAN 80,000 VOTES. 
LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER CALLING 

03:44:18.525 --> 03:44:22.758
INTO MEETING HE INVITED MULTIPLE
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE 

03:44:22.888 --> 03:44:24.888
PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. THE SAME SCHEME HE 

03:44:27.127 --> 03:44:32.122
HAD USED ON THE MICHIGAN 
LEGISLATORS. IT DIDN'T WORK. 

03:44:32.284 --> 03:44:34.383
WITH THOSE PUBLIC SERVANTS 
EITHER. THINK ABOUT IT. THE 

03:44:34.626 --> 03:44:38.600
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WAS CALLING PUBLIC OFFICIALS, 

03:44:39.089 --> 03:44:42.855
CALLING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, 
INVITING THEM INTO THE OVAL 

03:44:43.660 --> 03:44:47.425
OFFICE, TELLING THEM TO 
DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS OF THEIR 

03:44:47.533 --> 03:44:51.972
STATE? TELLING THEM TO OVERTURN 
THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

03:44:52.083 --> 03:44:56.534
ALSO, HE COULD TAKE THE ELECTION
FOR HIMSELF. AND THEN IN GEORGIA

03:44:56.641 --> 03:45:02.548
A STATE TRUMP HAD COUNTED ON FOR
VICTORY, HIS CONDUCT WAS PERHAPS

03:45:02.659 --> 03:45:09.116
THE MOST EGREGIOUS. ON NOVEMBER 
11th, REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF 

03:45:09.517 --> 03:45:12.766
STATE BRAD RAF FENSBERGER 
CONFIRMED HE BELIEVED BALLOTS 

03:45:12.879 --> 03:45:15.090
WERE ACCURATELY COUNTED FOR 
BIDEN. 

03:45:15.209 --> 03:45:19.765
TRUMP WENT ON A RELENTLESS 
ATTACK. HERE ARE JUST A FEW 

03:45:19.964 --> 03:45:24.144
EXAMPLES IN ALL TRUMP TWEETED AT
HIM 17 TIMES IN THE COMING WEEK.

03:45:24.260 --> 03:45:27.921
LET ME SHOW YOU JUST A FEW. 

03:45:44.967 --> 03:45:46.967
AND THESE ATTACKS HAD 
CONSEQUENCES. MR. RAFFENSPERGER 

03:45:49.126 --> 03:45:53.685
AND HIS FAMILY RECEIVED DEATH 
THREATS. QUOTE -- YOUR HUSBAND 

03:45:53.893 --> 03:45:58.157
DESERVES TO FACE A FIRING SQUAD.
YOU BETTER NOT BOTCH THIS 

03:45:58.281 --> 03:46:00.390
RECOUNT. YOUR LIFE DEPENDS UPON 
IT. 

03:46:00.508 --> 03:46:02.508
THE RAFFENSPERGERS SHOULD BE PUT
ON TRIAL 

03:46:05.449 --> 03:46:07.963
FOR TREASON AND FACE EXECUTION. 
JUST SOME OF THE THREATS THEY 

03:46:07.964 --> 03:46:11.884
RECEIVED. 
AFTER THESE DEATH THREATS ON 

03:46:11.991 --> 03:46:15.259
NOVEMBER 25th , MR. 
RAFFENSPERGER WROTE AN OP-ED 

03:46:15.367 --> 03:46:20.083
WHERE HE SAID MY FAMILY VOTED 
FOR TRUMP. DONATED TO HIM. 

03:46:20.202 --> 03:46:26.856
AND ARE NOW BEING THROWN UNDER 
THE BUS BY HIM. BUT HE ALSO 

03:46:26.993 --> 03:46:30.316
NOTED, ELECTIONS ARE THE BEDROCK
OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY NEED TO 

03:46:30.818 --> 03:46:37.830
BE RUN FAIRLY AND PERHAPS MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, IMPARTIALLY. THAT'S

03:46:38.620 --> 03:46:40.373
NOT PARTISAN. THAT'S JUST 
AMERICAN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

03:46:40.374 --> 03:46:46.061
REMEMBER THAT THIS WASN'T JUST A
RANDOM ATTACK. TRUMP WASN'T JUST

03:46:46.984 --> 03:46:51.247
CRITICIZING A POLITICIAN OVER 
POLICY. OR SAYING HE DIDN'T 

03:46:51.860 --> 03:46:54.098
AGREE. DONALD TRUMP WAS SAVAGELY
ATTACKING A SECRETARY OF STATE 

03:46:54.223 --> 03:46:57.250
BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL DID HIS 
JOB. AND CERTIFIED THE STATE 

03:46:57.366 --> 03:46:59.366
ACCORDING TO HOW 

03:47:00.688 --> 03:47:03.847
THE PEOPLE IN THAT STATE VOTED. 
DONALD TRUMP WAS TRYING TO 

03:47:03.961 --> 03:47:06.886
UNDERMINE OUR ELECTIONS BY 
TAKING VOTES AWAY FROM THE 

03:47:07.239 --> 03:47:10.121
AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO THAT HE 
COULD REMAIN PRESIDENT. AND HE 

03:47:11.433 --> 03:47:14.509
WAS WILLING TO BLAME AND BETRAY 
ANYONE, ANYONE, EVEN HIS OWN 

03:47:14.621 --> 03:47:18.811
SUPPORTERS, IF THEY GOT IN THE 
WAY. REMEMBER, 

03:47:22.168 --> 03:47:24.024
THREATS WERE TO MR. 
RAFFENSPERGER'S FAMILY. SO SOME 

03:47:24.025 --> 03:47:26.025
MAY SAY 

03:47:28.142 --> 03:47:31.561
TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW HIS ATTACKS 
AGAINST MR. RAFFENSPERGER WOULD 

03:47:31.738 --> 03:47:38.776
RESULT IN DEATH THREATS EXCEPT 
ALL OF THIS WAS VERY PUBLIC. THE

03:47:38.888 --> 03:47:42.267
SECRETARY PUBLISHED HIS OP-ED IN
"USA TODAY" AND MAJOR NETWORKS 

03:47:42.453 --> 03:47:45.151
INCLUDING FOX COVERED THE 
THREATS. WHAT DID TRUMP DO? DID 

03:47:45.576 --> 03:47:49.814
HE STOP? DID HE SAY NO, NO, 
SUPPORTERS, THAT ISN'T WHAT I 

03:47:49.928 --> 03:47:51.928
MEANT. 

03:47:53.702 --> 03:47:56.358
NO, HE DOUBLED DOWN. LET'S SEE 
THE EVIDENCE. 

03:47:56.359 --> 03:48:02.033
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS WAS A MASSIVE FRAUD. WE 
SHOULD NEVER TAKE PLACE IN THIS 

03:48:02.143 --> 03:48:04.495
COUNTRY. WE'RE LIKE A THIRD 
WORLD COUNTRY. LOOK AT GEORGIA. 

03:48:04.601 --> 03:48:08.728
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE, WHO IS REALLY -- HE'S 

03:48:08.848 --> 03:48:13.675
AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND 

03:48:13.787 --> 03:48:17.164
WHETHER HE'S REPUBLICAN OR NOT, 
THIS MAN, WHAT HE'S DONE -- 

03:48:17.165 --> 03:48:19.165
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HIS CHARACTER IN GEORGIA 
WHO'S A DISASTER. 

03:48:25.752 --> 03:48:29.227
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET THAT SINK IN. A 
REPUBLICAN PUBLIC SERVANT DOING 

03:48:29.345 --> 03:48:32.772
HIS JOB, WHOSE FAMILY HAD JUST 
RECEIVED DEATH THREATS AND THE 

03:48:33.177 --> 03:48:35.177
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
LABELED 

03:48:36.916 --> 03:48:40.564
HIM AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. AND 
THAT'S WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT 

03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:45.932
BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT JUST ONE 
ATTACK. OR ONE COMMENT. 

03:48:46.053 --> 03:48:51.016
THIS WAS ATTACK AFTER ATTACK IN 
THE FACE OF CLEAR THREATS OF 

03:48:51.125 --> 03:48:53.439
VIOLENCE. AND ON DECEMBER 1st, 
ANOTHER OFFICIAL GABRIEL 

03:48:54.263 --> 03:48:58.418
STERLING, A REPUBLICAN WHO VOTED
FOR TRUMP, MADE THIS POINT. AND 

03:48:59.121 --> 03:49:00.939
APPEALED DIRECTLY TO OUR 
PRESIDENT TO STOP HIS DANGEROUS 

03:49:00.940 --> 03:49:02.940
CONDUCT. 

03:49:04.705 --> 03:49:08.967
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, IT LOOKS LIKE 
YOU LIKELY LOST THE STATE OF 

03:49:09.078 --> 03:49:09.999
GEORGIA. WE'RE INVESTIGATING, 
THERE'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY. I 

03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:12.331
GET IT AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS 
TO GO THROUGH THE COURTS. WHAT 

03:49:12.734 --> 03:49:15.993
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO
AND YOU NEED TO STEP UP AND SAY 

03:49:16.598 --> 03:49:18.650
THIS, IS STOP INSPIRING PEOPLE 
TO COMMIT POTENTIAL ACTS OF 

03:49:18.757 --> 03:49:20.953
VIOLENCE. SOMEONE IS GOING TO 
GET HURT. SOMEONE IS GOING TO 

03:49:21.060 --> 03:49:23.234
GET SHOT. SOMEONE IS GOING TO 
GET KILLED. 

03:49:26.730 --> 03:49:33.822
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. STERLING PUT THIS 
PERFECTLY. IN THIS COUNTRY, WE 

03:49:34.345 --> 03:49:37.168
CAN APPROPRIATELY CHALLENGE A 
CLOSE COUNT. OR GO TO THE 

03:49:37.684 --> 03:49:40.435
COURTS. OR DISAGREE WITH OTHERS.
OR MAKE BOLD STATEMENTS. BUT 

03:49:41.938 --> 03:49:45.397
WHAT TRUMP WAS DOING WAS 
DIFFERENT. SOMEONE'S GOING TO 

03:49:45.589 --> 03:49:49.358
GET HURT. SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET
SHOT. 

03:49:49.473 --> 03:49:54.730
SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET KILLED. 
MR. STERLING SAW WHAT TRUMP'S 

03:49:54.855 --> 03:49:58.784
CONDUCT WAS FOMENTING. HE WARNED
HIM ON LIVE TV THAT VIOLENCE WAS

03:49:59.702 --> 03:50:03.769
ALREADY HAPPENING AND THAT MORE 
VIOLENCE WAS FORESEEABLE. AND 

03:50:04.764 --> 03:50:08.423
INEVITABLE. STERLING'S PLEAS 
WERE PLAYED OVER AND OVER ON 

03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:15.298
EVERY NETWORK. RATHER THAN HEED 
THAT WARNING, TRUMP ESCALATED 

03:50:15.812 --> 03:50:18.762
AGAIN. IN EARLY DECEMBER, TRUMP 
CALLED GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP OF 

03:50:19.279 --> 03:50:21.614
GEORGIA AND PRESSURED HIM TO 
HOLD A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE 

03:50:22.629 --> 03:50:26.812
STATE LEGISLATURE TO OVERTURN 
THE ELECTION RESULTS AND TO 

03:50:26.925 --> 03:50:29.847
APPOINT LEK ELECTORS WHO WOULD 
VOTE FOR TRUMP. A FEW WEEKS 

03:50:29.973 --> 03:50:33.289
LATER ON  DECEMBER 23rd , TRUMP 
CALLED THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR 

03:50:34.702 --> 03:50:37.843
FOR THE GEORGIA BUREAU OF 
INVESTIGATIONS. WHO WAS 

03:50:38.145 --> 03:50:40.171
CONDUCTING AN AUDIT. AND AN 
AUDIT OF THE 

03:50:45.185 --> 03:50:47.185
SIGNATURE MATCHING PROCEDURES 
FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS. TRUMP 

03:50:49.807 --> 03:50:51.807
URGED HIM, FIND THE FRAUD. AND 
CLAIMED THE OFFICIAL WOULD BE A 

03:50:52.034 --> 03:50:54.797
NATIONAL HERO IF HE DID. LET'S 
CALL THIS WHAT IT IS. HE WAS 

03:50:54.902 --> 03:50:59.636
ASKING THE OFFICIAL TO SAY THERE
WAS EVIDENCE OF FRAUD WHEN THERE

03:51:00.157 --> 03:51:04.845
WASN'T ANY. THE OFFICIAL REFUSED
AND THE INVESTIGATION WAS 

03:51:05.633 --> 03:51:07.633
COMPLETED. AND 

03:51:09.894 --> 03:51:15.546
ON DECEMBER 29th, RAFFENSPERGER 
ANNOUNCED THE AUDIT FOUND QUOTE 

03:51:15.660 --> 03:51:19.078
NO FRAUDULENT ABSENTEE BALLOTS 
WITH A QUOTE 99% CONFIDENCE 

03:51:19.193 --> 03:51:21.563
LEVEL. ON JANUARY 3rd TRUMP 
TWEETED ABOUT A CALL HE HAD 

03:51:24.595 --> 03:51:27.540
WITH GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIALS 
THE DAY BEFORE. HE SAID AND I 

03:51:28.983 --> 03:51:32.406
QUOTE -- I SPOKE TO SECRETARY OF
STATE RAFFENSPERGER YESTERDAY 

03:51:32.609 --> 03:51:35.622
ABOUT FULTON COUNTY AND VOTER 
FRAUD IN GEORGIA. HE WAS 

03:51:36.847 --> 03:51:40.254
UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE BALLOTS 

03:51:41.673 --> 03:51:46.422
UNDER THE TABLE SCAM, BALLOT 
DESTRUCTION, OUT OF STATE 

03:51:46.527 --> 03:51:51.591
VOTERS, DEAD VOTERS, AND MORE. 
HE HAS NO CLUE. ON JANUARY THE 

03:51:51.798 --> 03:51:53.798
5th, 

03:51:56.173 --> 03:51:59.478
THE "WASHINGTON POST" RELEASED A
RECORDING OF THAT CALL WHICH HAD

03:51:59.593 --> 03:52:02.325
OCCURRED ON JANUARY 2nd. 
REMEMBER JUST FOUR DAYS BEFORE 

03:52:02.494 --> 03:52:04.494
THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. 
HERE'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

03:52:04.605 --> 03:52:05.833
SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S MORE ILLEGAL FOR YOU 

03:52:05.834 --> 03:52:08.467
THAN IT IS FOR THEM. BECAUSE YOU
KNOW WHAT THEY DID. AND YOU ARE 

03:52:08.581 --> 03:52:11.744
NOT REPORTING IT. THAT'S -- YOU 
KNOW, THAT'S A -- CRIMINAL -- 

03:52:11.850 --> 03:52:15.469
THAT'S A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. 
AND YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T LET THAT

03:52:15.582 --> 03:52:19.212
HAPPEN. THAT'S -- THAT'S A BIG 
RISK TO YOU AND TO 

03:52:22.266 --> 03:52:24.414
RYAN. YOUR LAWYER. THAT'S A BIG 
RISK. 

03:52:24.415 --> 03:52:27.858
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS IS THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

03:52:27.967 --> 03:52:31.189
TELLING A SECRETARY OF STATE 
THAT IF HE DOES NOT FIND 

03:52:34.515 --> 03:52:37.767
VOTES, HE WILL FACE CRIMINAL 
PENALTIES. AND NOT JUST ANY 

03:52:37.887 --> 03:52:42.052
NUMBER OF VOTES. DONALD TRUMP 
WAS ASKING THE SECRETARY OF 

03:52:42.684 --> 03:52:45.856
STATE TO SOMEHOW FIND THE EXACT 
NUMBER OF VOTES DONALD TRUMP 

03:52:47.078 --> 03:52:49.078
LOST THE STATE 

03:52:51.034 --> 03:52:54.489
BY. REMEMBER, PRESIDENT BIDEN 
WON GEORGIA BY 11,779 VOTES. IN 

03:52:54.603 --> 03:53:00.667
HIS OWN WORDS, TRUMP SAID ALL I 
WANT TO DO IS THIS -- I JUST 

03:53:00.786 --> 03:53:03.918
WANT TO FIND 11,780 VOTES. HE 
WANTED THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO

03:53:04.937 --> 03:53:08.613
SOMEHOW FIND THE PRECISE NUMBER,
PLUS ONE, SO THAT HE COULD WIN. 

03:53:08.731 --> 03:53:13.249
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO LOOK -- ALL I WANT TO DO 

03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:20.661
IS THIS. I JUST WANT TO FIND 
11,780 VOTES, 

03:53:23.464 --> 03:53:26.650
MORE THAN WE HAVE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE SAYS IT RIGHT THERE. THE 

03:53:27.327 --> 03:53:31.579
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
TELLING A PUBLIC OFFICIAL TO 

03:53:32.077 --> 03:53:37.070
MANUFACTURE THE EXACT VOTES 
NEEDED SO HE CAN WIN. SENATORS, 

03:53:38.067 --> 03:53:44.652
WE MUST NOT BECOME NUMB TO THIS.
TRUMP DID THIS ACROSS 

03:53:46.902 --> 03:53:48.327
AFTER STATE. SO OFTEN. SO 
LOUDLY. SO PUBLICLY. PUBLIC 

03:53:48.328 --> 03:53:53.082
OFFICIALS LIKE YOU AND ME 
RECEIVED DEATH THREATS AND CALLS

03:53:53.190 --> 03:53:57.232
THREATENING CRIMINAL PENALTIES. 
ALL BECAUSE TRUMP WANTED TO 

03:53:57.343 --> 03:54:01.004
REMAIN IN POWER. THESE PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS EXERCISED GREAT 

03:54:01.112 --> 03:54:04.030
POLITICAL AND PERSONAL COURAGE 
IN THE FACE OF UNPRECEDENTED 

03:54:06.158 --> 03:54:08.701
PRESSURE FROM A PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES. SENATORS, 

03:54:12.533 --> 03:54:15.472
OURS IS A DIALOGUE WITH HISTORY.
A CONVERSATION IN THE PAST WITH 

03:54:15.591 --> 03:54:21.040
A HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. SENATORS,
I THANK 

03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:28.040
YOU TODAY FOR YOUR KIND 

03:54:32.089 --> 03:54:34.089
ATTENTION.

03:54:45.813 --> 03:54:47.959
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, I'M 
CONGRESSMAN TED LIEU. MY 

03:54:48.065 --> 03:54:50.994
COLLEAGUE WENT THROUGH PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE 

03:54:51.198 --> 03:54:54.062
ELECTION THROUGH THE COURTS. AND
WHEN THAT STARTED FAILING, HIS 

03:54:54.245 --> 03:54:58.316
DEEPLY DISTURBING ATTACKS ON 
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. I'M 

03:54:58.499 --> 03:55:01.471
GOING TO WALK THROUGH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS 

03:55:01.582 --> 03:55:03.832
REMAINING UNTIL JANUARY 6th  
WHEN HE TRIED AGAIN TO OVERTURN 

03:55:03.940 --> 03:55:05.940
THE ELECTION. 

03:55:07.534 --> 03:55:12.504
I FIRST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT 
REPRESENTATIVE RASKIN'S QUESTION

03:55:12.616 --> 03:55:18.785
TO YOU TODAY. IS THIS AMERICA? 
LIKE ALL OF YOU, I LOVE THIS 

03:55:18.903 --> 03:55:21.636
COUNTRY. I AM AN IMMIGRANT. MY 
PARENTS CAME TO OHIO AND WE 

03:55:21.742 --> 03:55:26.702
STARTED OFF LIVING IN THE 
BASEMENT OF A PERSON'S HOME. WE 

03:55:26.808 --> 03:55:29.029
WERE POOR. AND WE WENT TO FLEA 
MARKETS TO SELL GIFTS AND MAKE 

03:55:29.345 --> 03:55:31.578
ENDS MEET AND OVER MANY YEARS 
THEY BUILT A SMALL BUSINESS AND 

03:55:32.398 --> 03:55:35.854
OPENED SIX GIFT STORES AND 
ACHIEVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. ONE

03:55:35.960 --> 03:55:41.015
REASON I JOINED THE UNITED 
STATES AIR FORCE ON ACTIVE DUTY.

03:55:41.122 --> 03:55:44.081
I BELIEVE AMERICA IS AN 
EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY. I WAS 

03:55:44.252 --> 03:55:47.005
TRAINED AS A PROSECUTOR AT 
MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE IN 

03:55:47.111 --> 03:55:51.478
ALABAMA AND I REMAIN IN THE 
RESERVES BECAUSE WE'RE THE 

03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:55.110
GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. 
BUT HOW DID OUR EXCEPTIONAL 

03:55:55.221 --> 03:56:02.011
COUNTRY TO THE GET POINT WHERE A
VIOLENT MOB ATTACKED OUR 

03:56:02.179 --> 03:56:05.066
CAPITOL, MURDERING A POLICE 
OFFICER, ASSAULTING OVER 140 

03:56:05.183 --> 03:56:10.734
OTHER OFFICERS, HOW DO WE GET TO
THE POINT WHERE RIOTERS 

03:56:10.900 --> 03:56:12.900
DESECRATED, 

03:56:14.388 --> 03:56:16.216
DEFILED AND DISHONORED YOUR 
SENATE CHAMBER? THE VERY PLACE 

03:56:16.217 --> 03:56:20.978
WHERE YOU SIT BECAME A CRIME 
SCENE AND WHERE NATIONAL GUARD 

03:56:21.187 --> 03:56:25.233
TROOPS STILL PATROL OUTSIDE, 
WEARING BODY ARMOR. I'LL SHOW 

03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:33.349
YOU HOW WE GOT HERE. PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP RAN OUT OF 

03:56:33.463 --> 03:56:36.765
NON-VIOLENT OPTIONS TO MAINTAIN 
POWER. 

03:56:36.884 --> 03:56:39.878
AFTER HIS EFFORTS IN THE COURTS 
AND THREATENING OFFICIAL FAILED.

03:56:40.002 --> 03:56:43.503
HE TURNED TO PRIVATELY AND 
PUBLICLY ATTACKING MEMBERS OF 

03:56:43.613 --> 03:56:46.376
HIS OWN PARTY. IN THE HOUSE AND 
IN THE 

03:56:49.933 --> 03:56:52.581
SENATE. HE WOULD PUBLICLY BAIT 
SENATORS. NAMING THEM IN SOCIAL 

03:56:52.755 --> 03:56:59.260
MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, ON DECEMBER 
18th, PRESIDENT TRUMP NAMED AT 

03:56:59.666 --> 03:57:02.813
SENATOR MAJORITY LEADER AND AT 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS TELLING THEM

03:57:02.984 --> 03:57:06.372
THEY HAVE TO GET TOUGHER OR THEY
WON'T HAVE A REPUBLICAN PARTY 

03:57:06.483 --> 03:57:10.218
ANYMORE. WE WON THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION BY A LOT. FIGHT FOR IT.

03:57:10.324 --> 03:57:12.163
DON'T LET THEM TAKE IT AWAY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SUGGESTING 

03:57:12.164 --> 03:57:15.188
TO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE IF THEY
DIDN'T HELP HIM TRY TO OVERTURN 

03:57:15.295 --> 03:57:19.061
THE ELECTION, THERE WOULD 

03:57:22.357 --> 03:57:24.357
BE CONSEQUENCES. ON DECEMBER 
24th, PRESIDENT TRUMP WROTE -- I

03:57:24.822 --> 03:57:28.543
SAY AT LEAST EIGHTH REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS FROM LOSING IN THE LAST

03:57:28.751 --> 03:57:31.838
RIGGED FOR PRESIDENT ELECTION. 
NOW THEY ALMOST ALL SIT BACK AND

03:57:31.948 --> 03:57:38.853
WATCH ME FIGHT AGAINST A CROOKED
AND VICIOUS -- RADICAL LEFT 

03:57:38.970 --> 03:57:43.225
DEMOCRATS. I WILL AND ALL 
CAPITAL LETTERS HE WROTE, NEVER 

03:57:43.330 --> 03:57:48.312
FORGET EXCLAMATION POINT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS TELLING YOU 

03:57:48.424 --> 03:57:53.422
THAT YOU OWE HIM. THAT IF YOU 
DON'T HELP HIM FIGHT TO OVERTURN

03:57:53.994 --> 03:57:56.430
THE RESULTS HE WILL NEVER FORGET
AND THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES.

03:57:56.549 --> 03:57:59.229
THESE ARE THE THREATS JUST LIKE 
THE ONES HE MADE TO STATE AND 

03:57:59.351 --> 03:58:01.351
LOCAL OFFICIALS AND IT 
CONTINUED. 

03:58:02.935 --> 03:58:05.981
ON DECEMBER 29th, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TWEETED -- CAN YOU IMAGINE

03:58:06.097 --> 03:58:09.738
THE REPUBLICANS THROW A 
PRESIDENT ELECTION FROM THE 

03:58:09.847 --> 03:58:11.988
DEMOCRATS? ALL HELL WOULD BREAK 
OUT. REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ONLY 

03:58:13.081 --> 03:58:18.329
WANTS THE PATH OF LEAST 
RESISTANCE. OUR LEADERS, NOT ME 

03:58:18.452 --> 03:58:23.936
OF COURSE, ARE PATHETIC. 
THEY ONLY KNOW HOW TO LOSE. PS, 

03:58:24.349 --> 03:58:30.466
I GOT MANY SENATORS AND 
CONGRESSMEN AND CONGRESSWOMAN 

03:58:30.585 --> 03:58:31.753
ELECTED. I DO BELIEVE THEY 
FORGOT. 

03:58:31.754 --> 03:58:33.279
PRESIDENT TRUMP TARGETED 
SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

03:58:33.280 --> 03:58:38.118
ON SOCIAL MEDIA CALLING THEM 
PATHETIC FOR LETTING THE 

03:58:38.233 --> 03:58:42.205
ELECTION GET QUOTE STOLEN FROM 
THEM. ON JANUARY 4th, TWO 

03:58:45.235 --> 03:58:49.092
DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED -- THE 

03:58:50.198 --> 03:58:56.300
CAUCUS WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY WILL GO DOWN IN INFAMY AS 

03:58:56.426 --> 03:59:00.355
WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE GARDENS OF 
THE NATION. NOW HE'S MOCKING 

03:59:00.655 --> 03:59:06.473
SOME REPUBLICAN MEMBERS AS THE 
SURRENDER CAUCUS, CALLING THEM 

03:59:06.579 --> 03:59:08.688
WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE 
THEY WERE NOT PRETENDING HE HAD 

03:59:10.400 --> 03:59:15.075
WON WHEN IN FACT HE HAD NOT. AND
THEN THE VERY DAY BEFORE THE 

03:59:15.187 --> 03:59:18.315
ATTACK, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
THREATS GREW EVEN MORE HEATED 

03:59:18.435 --> 03:59:23.385
AND SPECIFIC TOWARDS REPUBLICANS
THAT HE CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF

03:59:23.498 --> 03:59:25.498
THAT SURRENDER CAUCUS. NOW WE'VE
SHOWN THINK TWEET BEFORE. BUT I 

03:59:25.551 --> 03:59:29.394
WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO 
HOW THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT JUST 

03:59:29.509 --> 03:59:33.193
INCITING HIS BASE, BUT HOW HE 
WAS ALSO CALLING OUT SPECIFIC 

03:59:33.432 --> 03:59:37.182
SENATE REPUBLICANS AT THE END OF
THIS TWEET. THIS IS A SPECIFIC 

03:59:37.294 --> 03:59:41.154
WARNING TO ANYONE WHO WON'T HELP
HIM OVERTURN THE RESULTS. ANYONE

03:59:41.345 --> 03:59:47.230
WHO WAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT 
BECAME AN ENEMY. AND LET ME BE 

03:59:47.936 --> 03:59:51.696
VERY CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT WASN'T
JUST COMING FOR ONE OR TWO 

03:59:51.908 --> 03:59:57.387
PEOPLE OR DEMOCRATS LIKE ME. HE 
WAS COMING FOR YOU. FOR 

03:59:57.687 --> 04:00:00.519
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS. HE WAS COMING FOR ALL 

04:00:00.634 --> 04:00:05.784
OF US. JUST AS THE MOB DID AT 
HIS DIRECTION. IN ADDITION TO 

04:00:05.890 --> 04:00:10.232
GOING AFTER SENATORS AND MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:00:10.842 --> 04:00:12.469
ALSO PRESSURED OUR JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE 

04:00:12.470 --> 04:00:17.746
FALSE CLAIMS THAT THE ELECTION 
WAS STOLEN. THAT THE PRESIDENT'S

04:00:17.856 --> 04:00:20.400
DIRECTION, ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WILLIAM BARR A LOYAL MEMBER OF 

04:00:22.198 --> 04:00:24.198
THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET, 
AUTHORIZED FEDERAL PROSECUTORS 

04:00:26.457 --> 04:00:29.428
TO PURSUE SUBSTANTIAL 
ALLEGATIONS OF VOTING AND VOTE 

04:00:30.216 --> 04:00:33.582
TABULATION IRREGULARITIES. BILL 
BARR PURSUING THESE ALLEGATIONS 

04:00:33.965 --> 04:00:37.312
SPARKED AN OUTCRY. 16 ASSISTANT 
U.S. ATTORNEYS IN THE TRUMP 

04:00:37.519 --> 04:00:39.882
ADMINISTRATION URGED THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CEASE THE 

04:00:40.267 --> 04:00:44.218
INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAD 
NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF ANY 

04:00:44.335 --> 04:00:49.078
SUBSTANTIAL ANOMALIES. THAT 
MEANS THEY DID NOT FIND ANY 

04:00:49.190 --> 04:00:54.774
EVIDENCE OF REAL FRAUD. ATTORNEY
GENERAL BARR PURSUED THE 

04:00:54.951 --> 04:00:59.202
INVESTIGATIONS ANYWAYS. AND 
AFTER HIS INVESTIGATION, THIS IS

04:00:59.315 --> 04:01:02.452
WHAT HE FOUND. QUOTE -- WE HAVE 
NOT SEEN FRAUD ON A SCALE THAT 

04:01:02.858 --> 04:01:07.042
COULD HAVE AFFECTED A DIFFERENT 
OUTCOME IN THE ELECTION. TWO 

04:01:07.153 --> 04:01:13.825
WEEKS LATER, ON  DECEMBER 14th ,
THE ELECTORS VOTED TO GIVE JOE 

04:01:13.932 --> 04:01:16.263
BIDEN 306 ELECTORAL VOTES AND 
ENSURED HIS VICTORY. THE 

04:01:17.980 --> 04:01:20.318
FOLLOWING DAY BILL BARR 
RESIGNED. ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR 

04:01:20.828 --> 04:01:23.865
HAD LOYALLY SERVED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. HE HAD NEVER PUBLICLY 

04:01:24.165 --> 04:01:28.033
COME OUT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 
BUT FOR BILL BARR, MAKING UP 

04:01:28.139 --> 04:01:31.907
ELECTION FRAUD CLAIMS AND SAYING
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN WAS A 

04:01:32.014 --> 04:01:37.177
BRIDGE TOO FAR. 
BILL BARR MADE CLEAR THAT 

04:01:37.283 --> 04:01:38.920
ATTEMPTING TO OVERTURN THE 
ELECTION RESULTS CROSSED A LINE.

04:01:38.921 --> 04:01:44.688
ACCORDING TO A NEWS REPORT, BILL
BARR THE HIGHEST LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:01:44.808 --> 04:01:48.173
OFFICIAL IN THE LAND, TOLD 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO HIS 

04:01:48.288 --> 04:01:53.837
FACE, THAT HIS THEORIES OF 
ELECTION FRAUD WERE QUOTE -- 

04:01:53.951 --> 04:01:58.232
BULL S [ BLEEP ]. UNQUOTE. WHEN 
BILL BARR RESIGNED HIS FORMER 

04:02:01.268 --> 04:02:04.098
DEPUTY JEFF ROSEN TOOK HIS 
PLACE. PRESIDENT TRUMP INITIALLY

04:02:04.207 --> 04:02:09.109
TWEETED ABOUT MR. ROSEN HE WAS 
AN OUTSTANDING PERSON WHEN HE 

04:02:09.228 --> 04:02:11.228
WAS ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BECOME 
ACTING ATTORNEY GENERALMENT BUT 

04:02:11.323 --> 04:02:13.438
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT THE SAME 
PRESSURE ON HIM THAT HE HAD DONE

04:02:13.549 --> 04:02:15.549
WITH STATE OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS
OF 

04:02:18.385 --> 04:02:20.385
CONGRESS AND U.S. SENATORS AND 
HIS 

04:02:23.374 --> 04:02:24.358
FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PORTEDLY 

04:02:24.359 --> 04:02:26.329
SUMMONED ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL
ROSEN TO THE OVAL OFFICE THE 

04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:31.593
NEXT DAY AND PRESSURED HIM TO 
APPOINT SPECIAL COUNSELS TO KEEP

04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:34.886
INVESTIGATING THE ELECTION. 
INCLUDING UNFOUNDED ACCUSATIONS 

04:02:34.994 --> 04:02:40.110
OF WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD AND 
ALSO TO INVESTIGATE DOMINION THE

04:02:40.238 --> 04:02:43.087
VOTING MACHINES' FIRM. ACCORDING
TO REPORTS, MR. ROSEN REFUSED. 

04:02:43.222 --> 04:02:47.366
HE MAINTAINED THAT HE WOULD MAKE
DECISIONS BASED ON THE FACTS AND

04:02:47.471 --> 04:02:50.891
THE LAW. AND REMINDED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WHAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN 

04:02:51.588 --> 04:02:54.843
TOLD BY ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL 
BARR. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD 

04:02:55.452 --> 04:02:59.144
ALREADY INVESTIGATED AND QUOTE 
FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF WIDESPREAD 

04:02:59.258 --> 04:03:02.079
FRAUD. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REFUSED TO FOLLOW THE FACTS AND 

04:03:02.447 --> 04:03:07.932
THE LAW. SO THE PRESIDENT TURNED
TO SOMEONE HE KNEW WOULD DO HIS 

04:03:08.036 --> 04:03:11.099
BIDDING. HE TURNED TO JEFFREY 
CLARK, AND ANOTHER JUSTICE 

04:03:11.271 --> 04:03:13.094
DEPARTMENT LAWYER, WHO HAD 
ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR 

04:03:13.095 --> 04:03:15.095
USING THE DEPARTMENT OF 

04:03:18.525 --> 04:03:20.525
JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE THE 
ELECTION RESULTS. SHORTLY AFTER 

04:03:20.959 --> 04:03:24.763
ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSEN 
FOLLOWED HIS DUTY AND THE LAW TO

04:03:24.889 --> 04:03:28.031
REFUSE TO REOPEN THE 
INVESTIGATIONS, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:03:28.139 --> 04:03:31.367
INTENDED TO REPLACE MR. ROSEN 
WITH MR. CLARK TO TRY TO STOP 

04:03:31.479 --> 04:03:35.011
CONGRESS FROM CERTIFYING THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS. 

04:03:35.128 --> 04:03:38.362
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, WHITE 
HOUSE COUNSEL PAT CIPOLLONE 

04:03:38.467 --> 04:03:43.032
ADVISED PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT TO 
FIRE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL 

04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:45.149
ROSEN. DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS HAD 
ALSO THREATENED TO RESIGN EN 

04:03:46.982 --> 04:03:50.274
MASSE IF HE HAD FIRED ROSEN. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACTIONS TIME 

04:03:50.386 --> 04:03:54.698
AND TIME AGAIN MADE CLEAR THAT 
HE WOULD DO ANYTHING AND 

04:03:54.807 --> 04:03:58.761
PRESSURE ANYONE IF IT MEANT 
OVERTURNING THE ELECTION 

04:03:58.869 --> 04:04:04.142
RESULTS. WE WATCHED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP USE ANY MEANS 

04:04:06.869 --> 04:04:08.869
PURSUE THIS AIM, FEVERISHLY 
GRASPING FOR STRAWS AND 

04:04:08.925 --> 04:04:12.786
RETAINING HIS HOLD ON THE 
PRESIDENCY BUT ALL HIS EFFORTS 

04:04:12.896 --> 04:04:16.542
PRIOR TO  JANUARY 6th  KEPT 
FAILING AND FINALLY IN HIS 

04:04:16.649 --> 04:04:20.484
DESPERATION HE TURNED ON HIS OWN
VICE PRESIDENT. 

04:04:20.603 --> 04:04:22.620
HE PRESSURED MIKE PENCE TO 
VIOLATE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL OATH 

04:04:22.738 --> 04:04:27.321
AND TO REFUSE TO CERTIFY THE 
OATH. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 

04:04:27.580 --> 04:04:31.953
DECIDED THAT VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE WHO PRESIDED OVER THE 

04:04:32.263 --> 04:04:34.297
CERTIFICATION, COULD SOMEHOW 
STOP IT. AS PENCE WOULD LATER 

04:04:34.594 --> 04:04:38.160
CONFIRM, THE VICE PRESIDENT DOES
NOT HAVE THAT POWER IN THE 

04:04:38.453 --> 04:04:40.592
CONSTITUTION. AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP NEVER TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHY

04:04:40.891 --> 04:04:45.244
HE THOUGHT THE VICE PRESIDENT 
COULD BLOCK THE CERTIFICATION OF

04:04:47.468 --> 04:04:51.420
ELECTION RESULTS. HE JUST BEGAN 
RELENTLESSLY ATTACKING THE VICE 

04:04:51.639 --> 04:04:53.639
PRESIDENT. PUBLICLY, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ATTACKED PENCE ON SOCIAL 

04:04:53.757 --> 04:04:56.203
MEDIA AND AT RALLIES. GETTING 
HIS SUPPORTERS TO BELIEVE THAT 

04:04:57.010 --> 04:04:59.010
MIKE PENCE COULD STOP THIS 
CERTIFICATION ON JANUARY 6th. 

04:05:00.874 --> 04:05:05.043
HERE'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
IN GEORGIA ON JANUARY 4th. 

04:05:05.044 --> 04:05:11.815
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND I HOPE MIKE PENCE COMES 
THROUGH FOR US. I HAVE TO TELL 

04:05:11.935 --> 04:05:14.859
YOU. I HOPE THAT TOUR GREAT VICE
PRESIDENT -- OUR GREAT VICE 

04:05:14.968 --> 04:05:19.726
PRESIDENT, COMES THROUGH FOR US.
HE'S A GREAT GUY. BECAUSE IF HE 

04:05:19.938 --> 04:05:21.938
DOESN'T COME THROUGH, I WON'T 
LIKE HIM QUITE AS MUCH. 

04:05:26.112 --> 04:05:29.652
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP APPLIED 

04:05:29.780 --> 04:05:33.668
SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO HIS 
SECOND IN COMMAND. MULTIPLE 

04:05:33.920 --> 04:05:36.061
REPORTS CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP USED HIS PERSONAL 

04:05:36.175 --> 04:05:38.175
ATTORNEYS AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO
PRESSURE THE VICE PRESIDENT. 

04:05:38.810 --> 04:05:42.561
TRUMP REPORTEDLY TOLD ALMOST 
ANYONE WHO CALLED HIM TO ALSO 

04:05:42.668 --> 04:05:45.808
CALL THE VICE PRESIDENT. 
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, WHEN MIKE 

04:05:45.919 --> 04:05:48.333
PENCE WAS IN THE OVAL OFFICE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD CALL 

04:05:48.448 --> 04:05:53.108
PEOPLE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO 
CONVINCE THE VICE PRESIDENT TO 

04:05:53.214 --> 04:05:56.355
HELP THEM. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
KEPT REPEATING THE MYTH THAT 

04:05:57.056 --> 04:06:00.311
PENCE COULD STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION TO HIS BASE TO 

04:06:01.624 --> 04:06:04.770
ANGER THEM. HOPING TO INTIMIDATE
MIKE PENCE. ON THE MORNING OF 

04:06:04.902 --> 04:06:09.647
THE RALLY ON JANUARY 6th , 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED -- 

04:06:11.216 --> 04:06:14.250
MIKE PENCE HAS TO DO IS SPEND 
THEM BACK TO THE STATES ALL CAPS

04:06:14.358 --> 04:06:20.407
HE WROTE -- AND WE WIN. 
DO IT MIKE, THIS IS A TIME FOR 

04:06:20.514 --> 04:06:23.973
EXTREME COURAGE. PRESIDENT TRUMP
LATER WENT TO ATTACK PENCE 

04:06:24.081 --> 04:06:30.432
NEARLY DOZEN TIMES IN HIS SPEECH
AT THE SAVE AMERICA MARCH. 

04:06:30.553 --> 04:06:32.786
PRIVATELY, IN PERSON BEFORE 
PENCE HEADED OVER TO OVERSEE THE

04:06:32.899 --> 04:06:39.112
JOINT SESSION ON JANUARY 6th. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAIN THREATENED

04:06:39.285 --> 04:06:42.025
PENCE. YOU CAN EITHER GO DOWN IN
HISTORY AS A PATRIOT MR. TRUMP 

04:06:42.145 --> 04:06:44.559
TOLD HIM, ACCORDING TO TWO 
PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THE 

04:06:44.695 --> 04:06:49.077
CONVERSATION. OR YOU CAN GO DOWN
IN HISTORY AS A. 

04:06:52.323 --> 04:06:59.018
AS A VETERAN I FIND IT DEEPLY 
DISHONORABLE OUR FORMER 

04:06:59.131 --> 04:07:01.967
PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
EQUATED PATRIOTISM WITH 

04:07:02.081 --> 04:07:03.301
VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION AND 
OVERTURNING THE ELECTION. YOU 

04:07:03.302 --> 04:07:06.848
WILL SEE AND HEAR THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF PRESIDENT 

04:07:06.970 --> 04:07:10.000
TRUMP'S REPEATED ATTACKS ON THE 
VICE PRESIDENT THE CHANTS OF 

04:07:10.126 --> 04:07:15.492
TRAITOR AND THE CHANTS OF HANG 
MIKE PENCE. THANKFULLY, VICE 

04:07:15.981 --> 04:07:19.934
PRESIDENT PENCE STOOD HIS GROUND
LIKE OUR OTHER BRAVE OFFICIALS 

04:07:20.041 --> 04:07:22.500
STOOD THEIR GROUND. HE REFUSED 
THE PRESIDENT AND FULFILLED HIS 

04:07:22.635 --> 04:07:28.064
DUTY ON  JANUARY 6th. EVEN AFTER
THE CAPITOL WAS ATTACKED, EVEN 

04:07:28.464 --> 04:07:33.822
AFTER HE WAS PERSONALLY 
TARGETED. EVEN AFTER HIS FAMILY 

04:07:34.133 --> 04:07:37.982
WAS TARGETED. VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE STOOD STRONG AND CERTIFIED

04:07:38.092 --> 04:07:40.323
THE ELECTION. VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE SHOWED US WHAT IT MEANS TO

04:07:40.434 --> 04:07:44.586
BE AN AMERICAN. WHAT IT MEANS TO
SHOW COURAGE. HE PUT HIS 

04:07:44.746 --> 04:07:49.892
COUNTRY, HIS OATH, HIS VALUES, 
AND HIS MORALS ABOVE THE WILL OF

04:07:50.258 --> 04:07:56.155
ONE MAN. THE PRESIDENT HAD TRIED
EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO SEIZE

04:07:56.957 --> 04:08:00.016
-- EVERYTHING IN HIS ATTEMPT TO 
SEIZE POWER FROM THE RIGHTFUL 

04:08:01.110 --> 04:08:04.134
VICTOR OF THE ELECTION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXTRAORDINARY 

04:08:04.251 --> 04:08:06.903
ACTIONS GREW INCREASE GRAY MORE 
DESPERATE. YOU SAW HIM GO FROM 

04:08:07.304 --> 04:08:10.854
PURSUING CLAIMS IN THE COURTS TO
THREATENING STATE AND LOCAL 

04:08:10.962 --> 04:08:12.962
ELECTION OFFICIALS TO THEN 
ATTACKING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN

04:08:14.000 --> 04:08:18.678
THE SENATE AND TO COMPROMISING 
ON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THEN 

04:08:19.985 --> 04:08:22.217
TO ATTACKING THE REPUBLICAN VICE
PRESIDENT. THESE BRAVE PUBLIC 

04:08:22.712 --> 04:08:24.854
SERVANTS WERE BEING PRESSURED BY
THE PRESIDENT TO OVERTURN THE 

04:08:24.963 --> 04:08:29.733
RESULTS AND SOME OF THEM AND 
THEIR FAMILIES GOT DEATH 

04:08:29.916 --> 04:08:33.280
THREATS. THANKFULLY, AT EVERY 
TURN, OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES 

04:08:33.391 --> 04:08:38.440
PREVAILED AND THE RULE OF LAW 
PREVAILED. BECAUSE ONLY BECAUSE 

04:08:39.247 --> 04:08:43.712
ALL THESE PEOPLE STAYED STRONG 
AND REFUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT

04:08:44.119 --> 04:08:50.196
OUR REPUBLIC HELD FAST. AND THE 
WILL OF THE ELECTORATE WAS SEEN 

04:08:50.512 --> 04:08:54.872
THROUGH. AND AT THIS POINT, 
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP RAN 

04:08:55.080 --> 04:08:57.684
OUT OF NON-VIOLENT OPTIONS TO 
MAINTAIN POWER. I BEGAN TO RAISE

04:08:58.933 --> 04:09:02.795
-- I BEGAN TODAY BY RAISING THE 
QUESTION OF HOW WE GOT HERE. 

04:09:02.907 --> 04:09:06.656
WHAT YOU SAW WAS A MAN SO 
DESPERATE TO CLING TO POWER THAT

04:09:06.763 --> 04:09:11.820
HE TRIED EVERYTHING HE COULD TO 
KEEP IT. AND WHEN HE RAN OUT OF 

04:09:11.939 --> 04:09:16.189
NON-VIOLENT MEASURES, HE TURNED 
TO THE VIOLENT MOB THAT ATTACKED

04:09:16.301 --> 04:09:19.836
YOUR SENATE CHAMBER ON  JANUARY 
6th. 

04:09:19.962 --> 04:09:23.998
AS YOU CAST YOUR VOTE AFTER THIS
TRIAL, I HOPE EACH OF YOU WILL 

04:09:24.122 --> 04:09:30.390
THINK OF THE BRAVERY OF ALL 
THESE PEOPLE WHO SAID NO TO 

04:09:30.504 --> 04:09:37.167
PRESIDENT TRUMP. BECAUSE THEY 
KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT RIGHT. 

04:09:37.315 --> 04:09:39.315
THAT THIS WAS NOT AMERICA. 

04:09:59.744 --> 04:10:03.283
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NEXT, STACEY PLASKETT OF THE
VIRGIN ISLANDS WILL SHOW HOW 

04:10:03.398 --> 04:10:08.961
PRESIDENT TRUMP WELCOMED AND 
AMPLIFIED HIS SUPPORTERS' PLANS 

04:10:09.566 --> 04:10:11.592
FOR INSURRECTION AGAINST THE 
UNION. I -- SHOULD SAY AS LEAD 

04:10:11.702 --> 04:10:15.556
MANAGER, THIS IS A MOMENT OF 
SPECIAL PRIDE FOR ME BECAUSE 

04:10:15.678 --> 04:10:19.218
REPRESENTATIVE PLASKETT IS NOT 
ONLY THE FIRST DELEGATE EVER TO 

04:10:19.331 --> 04:10:23.157
BE ON A TEAM OF IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, 

04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:26.723
BUT SHE WAS ALSO MY LAW STUDENT 
AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY'S 

04:10:26.834 --> 04:10:32.486
WASHINGTON COLLEGE OF LAW. AND I
HOPE I'M NOT VIOLATING ANY 

04:10:32.594 --> 04:10:36.447
FEDERAL EDUCATIONAL RECORDS LAWS
WHEN I SAY SHE WAS AN A. STUDENT

04:10:36.554 --> 04:10:38.762
THEN AND SHE'S AN A-PLUS STUDENT
NOW. STACEY PLASKETT? 

04:11:18.991 --> 04:11:20.991
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

04:11:24.023 --> 04:11:28.923
HI. MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED
SENATORS, I AM STACEY PLASKETT. 

04:11:29.029 --> 04:11:36.123
AND I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF 
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS OF THE UNITED

04:11:36.238 --> 04:11:38.238
STATES. OVER THIS PAST WEEKEND, 

04:11:40.096 --> 04:11:44.654
MY 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER I 
OVERHEARD HER TELLING ONE OF MY 

04:11:45.278 --> 04:11:48.650
SONS MOMMY DOESN'T SEEM REALLY 
NERVOUS ABOUT THE IMPEACHMENT 

04:11:49.234 --> 04:11:52.594
TRIAL TO WHICH THAT SON SOUNDING
LIKE AN OLDER BROTHER, YOU WILL 

04:11:52.896 --> 04:11:54.896
LEARN THAT MOST OF THE TIME MOM 

04:11:58.196 --> 04:12:03.166
MY REALISMS TO HAVE IT UNDER 
CONTROL. WE KNOW THAT'S NOT 

04:12:03.281 --> 04:12:06.824
ALWAYS THE CASE AS PARENTS BUT I
HAVE LEARNED THROUGHOUT MY LIFE 

04:12:07.121 --> 04:12:12.103
THAT PREPARATION AND TRUTH CAN 
CARRY YOU FAR. CAN ALLOW YOU TO 

04:12:12.815 --> 04:12:16.495
SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. I HAVE 
LEARNED THAT AS A YOUNG BLACK 

04:12:16.600 --> 04:12:22.269
GIRL, GROWING UP IN THE PROJECTS
IN BROOKLYN, HOUSING COMMUNITY 

04:12:22.374 --> 04:12:29.466
ON ST. CROIX, SENT TO THE MOST 
UNLIKELIEST OF SETTINGS, AND NOW

04:12:30.668 --> 04:12:35.634
AS AN ADULT WOMAN, REPRESENTING 
AN ISLAND TERRITORY SPEAKING TO 

04:12:36.043 --> 04:12:42.324
THE U.S. SENATE. AND BECAUSE OF 
TRUTH, I AM CONFIDENT TODAY, 

04:12:42.751 --> 04:12:44.751
SPEAKING BEFORE YOU, BECAUSE 

04:12:47.292 --> 04:12:50.032
TRUTH AND FACTS ARE 
OVERWHELMING, THAT OUR 

04:12:50.145 --> 04:12:56.219
PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, INCITED A MOB TO 

04:12:56.329 --> 04:12:58.674
STORM THE CAPITOL, TO ATTEMPT TO
STOP 

04:13:01.689 --> 04:13:03.718
THE CERTIFICATION OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. MY FELLOW

04:13:04.827 --> 04:13:11.028
MANAGERS HAVE SHOWN AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO SHOW CLEAR EVIDENCE 

04:13:11.234 --> 04:13:14.708
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP INCITED A 
VIOLENT MOB TO STORM OUR CAPITOL

04:13:14.812 --> 04:13:18.744
WHEN HE RAN OUT OF NON-VIOLENT 

04:13:22.091 --> 04:13:27.262
ASSEMBLED, THAT MOB, AT THE 
PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, ERUPTED 

04:13:27.371 --> 04:13:33.031
INTO THE BLOODIEST ATTACK ON 
THIS CAPITOL SINCE 1814. SOME OF

04:13:33.844 --> 04:13:37.223
YOU HAVE SAID THAT THERE'S NO 
WAY THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE 

04:13:39.031 --> 04:13:45.645
KNOWN HOW VIOLENT THE MOB WOULD 
BE. THAT IS FALSE. BECAUSE THE 

04:13:45.755 --> 04:13:51.092
VIOLENCE, IT WAS FORESEEABLE. 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY THIS 

04:13:51.202 --> 04:13:55.653
VIOLENCE WAS FORESEEABLE AND WHY
DONALD TRUMP WAS DIFFERENT THAN 

04:13:55.824 --> 04:14:00.212
ANY OTHER POLITICIAN JUST 
TELLING THEIR FIGHTERS, THEIR 

04:14:00.327 --> 04:14:03.266
SUPPORTERS, TO FIGHT FOR 
SOMETHING. THE VIOLENCE THAT 

04:14:03.658 --> 04:14:10.157
OCCURRED ON JANUARY 6th , LIKE 
THE ATTACK ITSELF, 

04:14:11.526 --> 04:14:15.531
APPEAR. YOU'LL SEE THAT DONALD 
TRUMP KNEW THE PEOPLE HE WAS 

04:14:15.743 --> 04:14:19.904
INCITING, HE SAW THE VIOLENCE 
THAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF, AND 

04:14:20.609 --> 04:14:29.028
HE HAD A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF
PRAISING AND ENCOURAGING THAT 

04:14:29.232 --> 04:14:36.033
VIOLENCE, NEVER, EVER CONDEMNING
IT. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THIS -- 

04:14:36.232 --> 04:14:39.665
IN SECRET. THE INSURGENTS 
BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE DOING 

04:14:39.977 --> 04:14:44.133
THE DUTY OF THEIR PRESIDENT. 
THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIS ORDERS. 

04:14:44.237 --> 04:14:50.748
AND SO THEY PUBLICIZED IT 
OPENLY, LOUDLY, PROUDLY, EXACT 

04:14:50.856 --> 04:14:55.436
BLUEPRINTS OF HOW THE ATTACK 
WOULD BE MADE. LAW ENFORCEMENT 

04:14:55.719 --> 04:15:01.324
SAW THESE POSTINGS AND REPORTED 
THAT THESE INSURGENTS WOULD 

04:15:01.436 --> 04:15:03.153
VIOLENTLY ATTACK THE CAPITOL 
ITSELF. 

04:15:03.154 --> 04:15:08.923
THIS WAS NOT JUST A COMMENT BY 
AN OFFICIAL TO FIGHT FOR A 

04:15:09.035 --> 04:15:11.035
CAUSE. THIS WAS MONTHS 

04:15:13.650 --> 04:15:17.872
OF CULTIVATING A BASE OF PEOPLE 
WHO WERE VIOLENT. PRAISING THAT 

04:15:18.680 --> 04:15:22.660
VIOLENCE AND THEN LEADING THAT 
VIOLENCE, THAT RAGE, STRAIGHT AT

04:15:22.841 --> 04:15:27.929
OUR DOOR. THE POINT IS THIS. BY 
THE TIME HE CALLED THE CAVALRY 

04:15:28.428 --> 04:15:34.000
OF HIS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS 
ON JANUARY 6th  IN AN EVENT HE 

04:15:34.216 --> 04:15:38.003
HAD INVITED THEM TO, HE HAD 
EVERY REASON TO KNOW THAT THEY 

04:15:39.982 --> 04:15:43.545
WERE ARMED, THAT THEY WERE 
VIOLENT, AND THAT THEY WOULD 

04:15:43.674 --> 04:15:47.703
ACTUALLY FIGHT. HE KNEW WHO HE 
WAS CALLING. AND THE VIOLENCE 

04:15:48.222 --> 04:15:51.353
THEY WERE CAPABLE OF. AND HE 
STILL GAVE THAT MARCHING ORDER 

04:15:52.782 --> 04:16:00.077
TO GO TO THE CAPITOL AND QUOTE 
FIGHT LIKE HELL. AND STOP THE 

04:16:00.377 --> 04:16:02.377
STEAL. MAKE NO MISTAKE. THE 

04:16:04.758 --> 04:16:08.028
VIOLENCE WAS NOT JUST 
FORESEEABLE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

04:16:08.144 --> 04:16:12.646
THE VIOLENCE WAS WHAT HE 
DELIBERATELY ENCOURAGED. AS 

04:16:12.751 --> 04:16:16.418
EARLY AS SEPTEMBER, TRUMP SET 
THE PRECEDENT THAT WHEN ASKED TO

04:16:16.526 --> 04:16:20.737
DENOUNCE VIOLENCE, HE WOULD DO 
THE OPPOSITE. AND ENCOURAGE IT. 

04:16:20.848 --> 04:16:24.308
NOW IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ONLY 
SAID SOMETHING ONCE ABOUT 

04:16:24.421 --> 04:16:28.089
FIGHTING TO STOP THE STEAL, AND 
VIOLENCE ERUPTED, THERE WOULD BE

04:16:28.199 --> 04:16:33.030
NO WAY TO KNOW HE INTENDED TO 
INCITE IT OR SAW IT COMING. BUT 

04:16:33.828 --> 04:16:39.021
JUST AS THE PRESIDENT SPENT 
MONTHS SPREADING HIS BIG LIE OF 

04:16:39.127 --> 04:16:45.498
THE ELECTION, HE ALSO SPENT 
MONTHS CULTIVATING GROUPS OF 

04:16:45.607 --> 04:16:50.593
PEOPLE WHO, FOLLOWING HIS 
COMMAND, REPEATEDLY ENGAGED IN 

04:16:50.724 --> 04:16:55.640
REAL, DANGEROUS VIOLENCE. 
AND WHEN THEY DID, AND THE 

04:16:55.757 --> 04:17:00.522
VIOLENCE ERUPTED AS A RESPONSE 
TO HIS CALLS TO FIGHT AGAINST 

04:17:00.627 --> 04:17:04.891
THE STOLEN ELECTION, HE DID NOT 
WALK IT BACK. HE DID NOT TELL 

04:17:06.819 --> 04:17:14.836
THEM NO. HE DID THE OPPOSITE. 
THE OPPOSITE. HE PRAISED AND 

04:17:14.959 --> 04:17:21.514
ENCOURAGED THE VIOLENCE SO THAT 
IT WOULD CONTINUE. HE FANNED THE

04:17:23.752 --> 04:17:25.752
FLAME OF VIOLENCE. AND IT 
WORKED. YOU'LL SEE THIS OVER 

04:17:25.995 --> 04:17:30.861
TIME. THESE VERY GROUPS AND 
INDIVIDUALS WHOSE VIOLENCE THE 

04:17:30.987 --> 04:17:35.440
PRESIDENT PRAISED. HELPED LEAD 
THE ATTACK ON JANUARY 6th. AND 

04:17:37.445 --> 04:17:41.439
THAT'S HOW WE KNOW CLEARLY THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIBERATELY 

04:17:41.553 --> 04:17:46.028
INCITED THIS AND HOW WE KNOW HE 
SAW IT COMING. THERE ARE MANY 

04:17:46.134 --> 04:17:48.503
EXAMPLES WHERE THE PRESIDENT 
ENGAGED IN THIS PATTERN. AND I'M

04:17:48.610 --> 04:17:54.864
JUST GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH A
FEW OF THEM. LET'S START WITH 

04:17:54.972 --> 04:17:59.029
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INCITEMENT
OF THE PROUD BOYS. MANY OF YOU 

04:18:01.065 --> 04:18:05.247
HAVE HEARD OF THIS GROUP, WHICH 
SINCE 2018, HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED 

04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:11.109
BY THE FBI AS AN EXTREMIST 
ORGANIZATION. SINCE THAT 

04:18:13.338 --> 04:18:16.604
CLASSIFICATION, THE GROUP HAS 
REPEATEDLY ENGAGED IN SERIOUS 

04:18:16.714 --> 04:18:19.853
ACTS OF VIOLENCE. INCLUDING AT 
PRO TRUMP RALLIES. AND ONE SUCH 

04:18:19.959 --> 04:18:25.115
ACT, ON  SEPTEMBER 7th , THE 
PROUD BOYS ATTACKED A MAN WITH A

04:18:25.305 --> 04:18:30.085
BASEBALL BAT. AND THEN PUNCHED 
HIM WHILE HE WAS DOWN ON THE 

04:18:30.296 --> 04:18:34.953
GROUND. ON SEPTEMBER 29th, 
DURING A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, 

04:18:35.160 --> 04:18:39.207
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED 
SPECIFICALLY IF HE WAS WILLING 

04:18:40.019 --> 04:18:42.390
TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACY AND 
MILITIA GROUPS, IF HE WAS 

04:18:42.496 --> 04:18:46.915
WILLING TO TELL THEM TO STAND 
DOWN. AND STOP THE VIOLENCE. 

04:18:47.028 --> 04:18:53.741
LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT ARE YOU WILLING TONIGHT, 

04:18:53.852 --> 04:18:56.296
TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS 
AND MILITIA GROUPS AND TO SAY 

04:18:56.435 --> 04:18:59.956
THAT THEY NEED TO STAND DOWN AND
NOT ADD TO THE VIOLENCE AT A 

04:19:00.066 --> 04:19:02.687
NUMBER OF THESE CITIES AS WE SAW
IN KENOSHA AND 

04:19:06.124 --> 04:19:09.891
AS WE'VE SEEN IN PORTLAND? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SURE -- I WOULD SAY -- 

04:19:09.892 --> 04:19:11.892
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S HEAR NOW THE 
PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE. 

04:19:14.638 --> 04:19:17.619
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO IT SIR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO IT. SAY IT. 

04:19:17.620 --> 04:19:20.768
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WANT TO CALL HIM -- WHAT 
DO YOU WANT TO CALL THEM? GIVE 

04:19:22.358 --> 04:19:24.906
THEM A NAME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHITE SUPREMACISTS. PROUD 

04:19:25.998 --> 04:19:28.456
BOYS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; STAND BACK AND STAND BY. 

04:19:28.457 --> 04:19:33.913
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN ASKED TO CONDEMN THE 
PROUD BOYS, AND 

04:19:38.472 --> 04:19:44.547
WHITE SUPREMACISTS, WHAT DID OUR
PRESIDENT SAY? HE SAID STAND 

04:19:44.681 --> 04:19:50.643
BACK AND STAND BY. HIS MESSAGE 
WAS HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR. THE 

04:19:51.141 --> 04:19:57.039
GROUP ADOPTED THAT PHRASE, STAND
BACK AND STAND BY, AS THEIR 

04:19:57.152 --> 04:19:59.263
OFFICIAL SLOGAN. THEY CREATED 
MERCHANDISE WITH THEIR NEW 

04:20:00.185 --> 04:20:04.589
SLOGAN WHICH THEY WORE PROUDLY 
ACROSS THEIR BACKS AT TRUMP'S 

04:20:06.382 --> 04:20:08.321
RALLIES. AND THEY FOLLOWED THE 
PRESIDENT'S ORDERS. YOU'LL SEE 

04:20:08.322 --> 04:20:13.691
MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IN THE 
TRIAL. BUT YOU WILL SEE IN THESE

04:20:15.322 --> 04:20:18.263
PHOTOS TO THE LEFT, DOMINIC 
PIZZOLA AND TO THE RIGHT WILLIAM

04:20:18.472 --> 04:20:21.062
PEPE. TWO OF THE LEADERS OF THE 
GROUP HEADING TO THE CAPITOL ON 

04:20:21.185 --> 04:20:26.134
JANUARY 6th. 
THEY WERE LATER CHARGED WITH 

04:20:26.245 --> 04:20:28.245
WORKING TOGETHER TO OBSTRUCT LAW
ENFORCEMENT. AS WE GO THROUGH 

04:20:28.519 --> 04:20:31.978
THIS EVIDENCE, I WANT YOU TO 
KEEP IN MIND THESE WORDS BY 

04:20:32.275 --> 04:20:37.379
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN ASKED TO 
CONDEMN VIOLENCE. STAND BACK AND

04:20:37.487 --> 04:20:39.487
STAND BY. 

04:20:40.896 --> 04:20:45.072
AND SEE EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF
THE KINDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THE 

04:20:45.182 --> 04:20:51.349
PROUD BOYS WHO HE HAD STANDING 
BY ON JANUARY 6th. 

04:20:51.520 --> 04:20:54.943
BY OCTOBER, AS MY COLLEAGUES MR.
CASTRO AND MR. SWALWELL SHOWED 

04:20:56.229 --> 04:21:00.395
YOU, DONALD TRUMP WAS ESCALATING
HIS BIG LIE THAT THE ONLY WAY HE

04:21:00.509 --> 04:21:04.139
COULD LOSE THE ELECTION WAS IF 
IT WAS RIGGED. 

04:21:04.254 --> 04:21:09.259
SO AS ELECTION DAY NEARED, HIS 
SUPPORTERS WERE FRUSTRATED. AND 

04:21:09.744 --> 04:21:14.976
THEY WERE ANGRY. THEY WERE 
PREPARED TO ENSURE HIS VICTORY 

04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:21.527
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. ONE OF 
THESE VIOLENT ACTS WAS ON 

04:21:22.129 --> 04:21:25.723
OCTOBER 30th. SOME TIME AFTER 
12:30 P.M. A CARAVAN OF MORE 

04:21:25.925 --> 04:21:30.869
THAN 50 TRUCKS COVERED IN PRO 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN GEAR CONFRONTED 

04:21:31.159 --> 04:21:34.963
AND SURROUNDED CARS CARRYING 
BIDEN AND HARRIS CAMPAIGN 

04:21:35.273 --> 04:21:39.663
WORKERS. AND A BIDEN/HARRIS 
CAMPAIGN BUS AS THEY WERE 

04:21:39.776 --> 04:21:41.776
TRAVELING DOWN INTERSTATE 

04:21:43.209 --> 04:21:45.209
35 FROM SAN ANTONIO TO AUSTIN. 

04:21:53.061 --> 04:21:54.490
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THIS 
CARAVAN REPEATEDLY TRIED TO 

04:21:54.491 --> 04:21:59.381
FORCE THE BUS YOU LAW AND YOU 
SEE IN THAT VIDEO TO SLOW DOWN 

04:21:59.500 --> 04:22:01.648
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY AND
THEN TO RUN IT OFF THE ROAD. 

04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:06.154
WHAT THAT VIDEO YOU JUST SAW 
DOES NOT SHOW IS THAT THE BUS 

04:22:06.305 --> 04:22:10.314
THAT THEY TRIED TO RUN OFF THE 
ROAD WAS 

04:22:15.332 --> 04:22:15.830
FILLED WITH YOUNG CAMPAIGN 
STAFF. VOLUNTEERS. SUPPORTERS. 

04:22:15.831 --> 04:22:21.068
SURROGATES. PEOPLE. 
AS THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS CLOSED 

04:22:21.173 --> 04:22:27.777
IN ON THE BUS, A LARGE BLACK 
PICKUP TRUCK ADORNED WITH TRUMP 

04:22:27.885 --> 04:22:33.244
FLAGS SUDDENLY AND INTENTIONALLY
SWERVED AND CRASHED INTO A CAR 

04:22:33.362 --> 04:22:38.716
DRIVEN BY A BIDEN/HARRIS 
VOLUNTEER. NEWS OF THE EVENT 

04:22:39.739 --> 04:22:43.198
WENT VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

04:22:43.302 --> 04:22:49.069
IN CAMPAIGN, SAW HIS OWN 
SUPPORTERS TRYING TO RUN A BUS 

04:22:49.233 --> 04:22:51.233
CARRYING HIS OPPONENTS' CAMPAIGN
WORKERS OFF THE HIGHWAY. 

04:22:54.340 --> 04:22:56.340
TO PHYSICALLY 

04:22:58.287 --> 04:23:00.287
INTIMIDATE PEOPLE IN THIS 
COUNTRY, CAMPAIGNING. HERE WAS 

04:23:02.148 --> 04:23:04.223
HIS RESPONSE THE NEXT DAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THREE, TWO, ONE. 

04:23:08.535 --> 04:23:10.535
GO!  7  7 

04:23:21.999 --> 04:23:25.119
NOT WELCOME TO THE RED KINGDOM, 
WELCOME TO THE RED KINGDOM  7 7 

04:23:29.688 --> 04:23:36.492
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES TWEETED A 

04:23:37.734 --> 04:23:41.664
SUPPORTERS TRYING TO DRIVE A BUS
OFF THE ROAD. YOU'LL RECALL IN 

04:23:42.478 --> 04:23:46.446
THAT FIRST VIDEO THAT I SHOWED 
YOU THERE WAS NO SOUND. WELL, 

04:23:46.640 --> 04:23:51.927
THE ONE THAT HE TWEETED HAD A 
FIGHT THEME SONG PLACED TO IT 

04:23:52.325 --> 04:23:54.817
THAT THE PRESIDENT, THE 
PRESIDENT PUT THAT MUSIC TO THAT

04:23:54.818 --> 04:23:59.679
VIDEO. 
AND HE ADDED AT THE TOP, I LOVE 

04:23:59.680 --> 04:24:05.008
TEXAS. 
BY THE NEXT EVENING, THAT TWEET 

04:24:05.219 --> 04:24:07.219
THAT HE DID 

04:24:09.876 --> 04:24:13.532
HAD BEEN VIEWED 12.6 MILLION 
TIMES. AND IT WASN'T JUST A 

04:24:13.735 --> 04:24:17.904
TWEET. ON NOVEMBER 1st, AT A 
MICHIGAN RALLY WITH A SEA OF 

04:24:18.092 --> 04:24:21.690
SUPPORTERS, THE PRESIDENT TALKED
ABOUT THAT INCIDENT AGAIN. HERE 

04:24:21.801 --> 04:24:23.380
IT IS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DID YOU SEE THE WAY OUR 

04:24:23.381 --> 04:24:27.245
PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW, THEY WERE 
PROTECTING HIS BUS YESTERDAY. 

04:24:27.361 --> 04:24:31.299
BECAUSE THEY'RE NICE. 
SO HIS BUS -- THEY HAD HUNDREDS 

04:24:31.399 --> 04:24:34.072
OF CARS, TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP AND
THE AMERICAN FLAG. THAT'S -- 

04:24:37.683 --> 04:24:43.046
YOU SEE TRUMP AND AMERICAN FLAG.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PRESIDENT MADE A PUBLIC 

04:24:43.163 --> 04:24:48.336
JOKE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST 
CAMPAIGNERS IN AN AMERICAN 

04:24:48.463 --> 04:24:53.192
ELECTION. HE MADE LIGHT OF IT. 
THIS WAS NOT A JOKE. IN FACT, IT

04:24:53.696 --> 04:24:58.870
WAS SO VIOLENT THAT IT PUT SO 
MANY PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY, THAT 

04:24:59.278 --> 04:25:02.328
THE FBI INVESTIGATED THE 
INCIDENT AND THE CRIMINAL 

04:25:02.445 --> 04:25:04.445
RESPONSIBILITY OF 

04:25:05.871 --> 04:25:07.871
THOSE WHO ATTACKED THESE 
CAMPAIGN WORKERS. NOW, OUR 

04:25:08.107 --> 04:25:11.960
PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP, COULD 
HAVE SAID OKAY, I DIDN'T REALIZE

04:25:12.086 --> 04:25:20.200
HOW BAD THAT WAS. THIS WAS VERY 
VIOLENT. PLEASE STOP. BUT HE 

04:25:20.365 --> 04:25:24.642
DIDN'T. HE SAW THE INVESTIGATION
AND MADE A STATEMENT IN DEFENSE 

04:25:24.847 --> 04:25:31.748
OF HIS SUPPORTERS' ATTACK ON THE
BUS WRITING QUOTE -- IN MY 

04:25:31.872 --> 04:25:35.379
OPINION, THESE PATRIOTS DID 
NOTHING WRONG. 

04:25:35.495 --> 04:25:40.546
ENGAGING IN VIOLENCE FOR HIM 
MADE THEM PATRIOTS TO DONALD 

04:25:40.660 --> 04:25:43.709
TRUMP. FOR ANYONE WHO SAYS 
DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW THE 

04:25:44.214 --> 04:25:47.395
VIOLENCE HE WAS INCITING, I ASK 
YOU TO CONSIDER HIS SUPPORTERS 

04:25:48.591 --> 04:25:52.248
TRIED TO DRIVE A BUS OFF THE 
HIGHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

04:25:54.768 --> 04:25:56.090
TO INTIMIDATE HIS OPPONENT'S 
CAMPAIGN WORKERS. AND HIS 

04:25:56.091 --> 04:26:01.357
RESPONSE WAS TO TWEET THE VIDEO 
OF THE INCIDENT THAT HAD FIGHT 

04:26:02.083 --> 04:26:08.913
MUSIC, JOKE ABOUT IT, AND CALL 
THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT 

04:26:09.026 --> 04:26:13.293
INCIDENT PATRIOTS. AND ONCE 
AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP'S PRAISE 

04:26:14.195 --> 04:26:20.121
WORKED TO INCITE THEM FURTHER. 
EMBOLDENED BY THAT PRAISE, THEY 

04:26:20.234 --> 04:26:23.315
REMAINED READY TO FIGHT. READY 
TO STAND BACK AND STAND BY. 

04:26:26.860 --> 04:26:29.679
THIS LINK IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. 
JUST LIKE WE SAW WITH THE PROUD 

04:26:29.793 --> 04:26:36.027
BOYS SHOWING UP IN FULL FORCE ON
JANUARY 6th. DONALD TRUMP'S 

04:26:36.247 --> 04:26:38.552
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THIS ATTACK 
MADE SURE HIS SUPPORTERS WERE 

04:26:39.255 --> 04:26:44.463
READY FOR THE NEXT ONE. THE 
CARAVAN BUS ATTACK HAD BEEN 

04:26:44.640 --> 04:26:46.943
ORGANIZED BY TRUMP SUPPORTER 
NAMED KEITH LEE. LEADING UP TO 

04:26:47.351 --> 04:26:52.649
THE ATTACK ON THE CAM TOLL ON 
JANUARY 6th, MR. LEE TEAMED UP 

04:26:52.931 --> 04:26:57.085
WITH OTHER SUPPORTERS TO FUND 
RAISE, TO HELP TO BRING PEOPLE 

04:26:57.596 --> 04:27:01.067
TO WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR THAT 
DAY. THE MORNING OF THE ATTACK, 

04:27:02.316 --> 04:27:05.826
HE FILMED FOOTAGE OF THE 
CAPITOL, POINTED OUT THE 

04:27:06.646 --> 04:27:09.306
FLIMSINESS OF FENCING AND THEN 
ADDRESSED HIS SUPPORTERS BEFORE 

04:27:09.418 --> 04:27:13.163
THE ATTACK SAYING QUOTE -- AS 
SOON AS YOU ALL GET DONE HEARING

04:27:13.289 --> 04:27:18.862
THE PRESIDENT, Y'ALL GET TO THE 
CAPITOL. WE NEED TO SURROUND 

04:27:19.052 --> 04:27:23.136
THIS PLACE. DURING THE ATTACK, 
HE USED THE BULL HORN TO CALL 

04:27:23.544 --> 04:27:29.563
OUT FOR THE MOB TO RUSH IN. HE 
LATER WENT TO THE ROTUNDA 

04:27:29.676 --> 04:27:36.073
HIMSELF. AND THEN BACK OUTSIDE 
TO URGE THE CROWD TO COME 

04:27:36.276 --> 04:27:41.485
INSIDE. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CULTIVATED.

04:27:41.593 --> 04:27:43.593
WHO WERE STANDING BY. I'D LIKE 

04:27:46.180 --> 04:27:49.642
TO LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE. 
AFTER THE ELECTION ON DECEMBER 

04:27:49.762 --> 04:27:53.110
12th , TRUMP SUPPORTERS GATHERED
EN MASSE 

04:27:56.111 --> 04:28:01.116
TO PROTEST THE STOLEN ELECTION 
IN D.C. IT WAS BILLED BY HIS 

04:28:01.699 --> 04:28:03.699
LOYALISTS AS THE SECOND MILLION 
MAGA MARCH. 

04:28:06.055 --> 04:28:10.640
THE RALLY WAS ORGANIZED BY WOMEN
FOR AMERICA FIRST. THE SAME 

04:28:12.861 --> 04:28:16.432
GROUP THAT YOU'LL SEE LATER 
SECURED THE PERMIT FOR THE 

04:28:16.537 --> 04:28:22.289
JANUARY 6th  RALLY AND WHO ELSE 
WAS THERE? THE PROUD BOYS. 

04:28:22.392 --> 04:28:27.155
STANDING BY. DONALD TRUMP DID 
NOT ATTEND THAT RALLY. BUT HE 

04:28:27.268 --> 04:28:29.268
MADE SURE TO MAKE SURE HIS 
SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY, 

04:28:29.318 --> 04:28:31.318
HOW 

04:28:33.744 --> 04:28:40.155
HE FELT ABOUT THE EVENT. AT 8:47
A.M., HE SENT OUT A TWEET, WE 

04:28:41.309 --> 04:28:46.029
HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT. 
AND THEN THE RALLY BEGAN. AND 

04:28:46.136 --> 04:28:49.690
DONALD TRUMP'S ALLIES WHO SPOKE 
AT THE RALLY, CARRIED ON HIS 

04:28:51.606 --> 04:28:55.443
MESSAGE OF THE STOLEN ELECTION. 
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FIGHTING 

04:28:55.556 --> 04:28:57.556
TO STOP THE STEAL. 

04:29:00.312 --> 04:29:04.714
HERE'S NICHOLAS FUENTES A 
COMMENTATOR WHO HAD ORGANIZED A 

04:29:04.819 --> 04:29:08.383
STOP THE STEAL RALLY IN 
MICHIGAN. 

04:29:08.384 --> 04:29:11.718
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FIRST MILLION MAGA MARCH 
WE PROMISED IF THE GOP WOULD NOT

04:29:12.210 --> 04:29:15.303
DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO 
KEEP TRUMP IN OFFICE. WE WOULD 

04:29:15.415 --> 04:29:17.415
DESTROY THE GOP. [ CHEERING AND 
APPLAUSE ] 

04:29:19.936 --> 04:29:25.636
AND IF WE -- IN WASHINGTON, 
D.C., FOR A SECOND MILLION MAGA 

04:29:26.235 --> 04:29:28.235
MARCH, WE'RE TIRED OF MAKING 
PROMISES. AND IT HAS TO HAPPEN 

04:29:28.466 --> 04:29:30.106
NOW. WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY THE
GOP. 

04:29:30.107 --> 04:29:32.107
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] 

04:29:43.276 --> 04:29:46.212
[ CHANTING ] 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DESTROY THE GOP. 

04:29:46.213 --> 04:29:51.721
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THOSE WORDS, THAT WAS TRUMP'S
MESSAGE. DESTROY ANYONE WHO 

04:29:51.824 --> 04:29:56.676
WON'T LISTEN. 
WHO WON'T HELP THEM TAKE THE 

04:29:56.785 --> 04:30:02.339
ELECTION FOR TRUMP. 
AND AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS WAS 

04:30:02.448 --> 04:30:06.516
JUST THE PREVIEW FOR FUENETES 
WHO LIKE THE PROUD BOYS AND 

04:30:06.636 --> 04:30:10.972
TRUMP CARAVAN ORGANIZERS, WOULD 
LATER HEED THE PRESIDENT'S CALL 

04:30:11.095 --> 04:30:14.635
AND COME TO WASHINGTON AND BE 
THERE ON JANUARY 6th. 

04:30:14.748 --> 04:30:20.004
LATER IN THE RALLY, A FORMER 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN 

04:30:20.111 --> 04:30:27.085
KATRINA PEARSON ALSO SPOKE. 
DURING HER SPEECH, SHE STATED 

04:30:27.188 --> 04:30:29.188
QUOTE 

04:30:33.654 --> 04:30:37.475
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REFERRING TO THE FIGHT TO 
STOP THE STEEL AND THEN SHE 

04:30:37.706 --> 04:30:39.812
ADDED WE KNEW BOTH REPUBLICAN 
AND DEMOCRATS WERE AGAINST WE 

04:30:40.042 --> 04:30:43.221
PEOPLE WILL, WE THE PEOPLE. WE 
ARE THE CAVALRY. NO ONE IS 

04:30:43.459 --> 04:30:49.133
COMING FOR US. IT IS CLEAR THAT 
TRUMP AND SOME OF HIS A 

04:30:49.377 --> 04:30:52.821
SUPPORTERS SAW THIS AS WAR, A 
FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO WAS 

04:30:53.051 --> 04:30:57.919
UNWILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK
TO KEEP DONALD TRUMP IN POWER. 

04:30:58.155 --> 04:31:04.226
WE ARE THE CALVARY AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP CONTINUE TO REINFORCE 

04:31:04.460 --> 04:31:06.460
THESE SUPPORTIVE MESSAGES 
THROUGHOUT 

04:31:10.000 --> 04:31:13.768
THE DAY. AT 1:48 PM AFTER BOTH 
SPEECHES, HE RETWEETED HIS 

04:31:14.007 --> 04:31:16.372
DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF'S TWEET 
SHOWING HIS CROWD THAT HE HAD 

04:31:16.613 --> 04:31:21.462
FLOWN OVER ON MARINE ONE AND HE 
TWEETED QUOTE THANK YOU 

04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:26.245
PATRIOTS. THESE PEOPLE WERE AS 
YOU CAN SEE GATHERED EN MASSE 

04:31:26.474 --> 04:31:28.474
AND BEING TOLD BY THE 
PRESIDENT'S ALLIES THAT THEIR 

04:31:28.580 --> 04:31:33.847
ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN AND 
THEY WERE TOLD THEY WERE THE 

04:31:34.212 --> 04:31:36.212
CALVARY. NO ONE ELSE COULD 

04:31:38.524 --> 04:31:40.621
DO IT AND AFTER HEARING THESE 
SPEECHES AND SEEING THE 

04:31:41.562 --> 04:31:43.859
PRESIDENT SUPPORT, THIS IS WHAT 
DONALD TRUMPS CALVARY WAS 

04:31:48.796 --> 04:31:50.796
CAPABLE OF.

04:32:10.612 --> 04:32:17.313
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT YOU JUST SAW WAS THE 
VIOLENCE THAT ENSUED AFTER THAT 

04:32:17.545 --> 04:32:21.578
RALLY. THE PROUD BOYS AFTER THAT
RALLY ENGAGED IN SERIOUS ACTS OF

04:32:21.809 --> 04:32:27.807
VIOLENCE IN DOWNTOWN DC. SOME 
TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND SELF 

04:32:28.046 --> 04:32:35.309
IDENTIFIED PROUD BOYS VANDALIZED
CHURCHES AFTER THAT RALLY. IF WE

04:32:35.538 --> 04:32:37.538
LOOK AT THESE EVENTS, IT IS 
CLEAR HOW WE 

04:32:42.028 --> 04:32:44.719
GOT HERE BECAUSE WHAT DID THE 
PRESIDENT DO AFTER THAT? HE 

04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:49.151
TURNED RIGHT AROUND AND A LITTLE
OVER A WEEK LATER HE BEGAN 

04:32:49.387 --> 04:32:52.862
COORDINATING THE JANUARY 6 SAVE 
AMERICA RALLY WITH THE SAME 

04:32:53.230 --> 04:32:55.330
PEOPLE WHO HAD PLANTED THE 
SECOND MILLION MAGGOT MARCH. 

04:32:58.344 --> 04:33:00.674
YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE WOMEN 
FOR AMERICA FIRST HAD ORGANIZED 

04:33:00.902 --> 04:33:04.640
THAT SECOND MILLION MARCH. THEY 
HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED RALLIES 

04:33:05.662 --> 04:33:15.415
FOR JANUARY 22nd AND JANUARY 23.
AFTER THE INAUGURATION. DONALD 

04:33:15.651 --> 04:33:21.537
TRUMP HAD OTHER PLANS. ON 
DECEMBER 19, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:33:21.771 --> 04:33:26.023
TWEETED HIS SAVE THE DATE FOR 
JANUARY 6. HE TOLD HIS 

04:33:26.251 --> 04:33:31.546
SUPPORTERS TO COME TO DC FOR A 
BIG PROTEST THE DAY BILLING IT 

04:33:32.476 --> 04:33:38.563
AS WILD. JUST DAYS LATER, WOMEN 
FOR AMERICA FIRST AMENDED THEIR 

04:33:38.800 --> 04:33:42.338
PERMIT TO HOLD THE RALLY ON 
JANUARY 6 PURSUANT TO THE 

04:33:42.567 --> 04:33:48.535
PRESENCE SAVE THE DATE INSTEAD 
OF AFTER THE INAUGURATION. THIS 

04:33:49.528 --> 04:33:55.450
WAS DELIBERATE. REPORTS CONFIRM 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, 

04:33:55.698 --> 04:33:57.997
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAME DIRECTLY 
INVOLVED WITH THE PLANNING OF 

04:33:59.493 --> 04:34:01.493
THE EVENT INCLUDING THE 

04:34:03.960 --> 04:34:06.507
SPEAKING LINEUP, EVEN THE MUSIC 
TO BE PLAYED JUST AS HE CHOSE 

04:34:06.735 --> 04:34:12.154
THE MUSIC FOR HIS RETWEET OF THE
CARAVAN DRIVING THE BIDEN HARRIS

04:34:12.384 --> 04:34:14.384
BUS OFF THE ROAD WITH THAT 

04:34:17.363 --> 04:34:19.974
FIGHT SONG. HE BROUGHT THE SAME 
PEOPLE WHO SPOKE AT THE SECOND 

04:34:20.203 --> 04:34:22.654
MILLION MAGA RALLY TO HELP AS 
WELL.  TRUMPS CAMPAIGN ADVISOR 

04:34:22.885 --> 04:34:27.012
CATRINA PEARSON WHO YOU RECALL 
SET ON DECEMBER 12 THAT THIS IS 

04:34:27.244 --> 04:34:29.244
ONLY THE BEGINNING. WE ARE 

04:34:32.393 --> 04:34:35.879
THE CALVARY ALSO BECAME DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN PLANNING THE EVENT. 

04:34:36.111 --> 04:34:38.111
THEY EVEN SENT OUT 

04:34:41.326 --> 04:34:43.558
INVITATIONS TOGETHER. THIS IS 
AMY, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF 

04:34:43.787 --> 04:34:46.514
WOMEN FOR AMERICA FIRST TWITTING
THE INVITATION TAGGING DONALD 

04:34:46.752 --> 04:34:51.063
TRUMP AND OTHER ORGANIZERS 
INVITING THE SAME SUPPORTERS WHO

04:34:51.290 --> 04:34:54.562
HAD JUST ENGAGED IN SERIOUS 
VIOLENCE AT THE SECOND MILLION 

04:34:54.790 --> 04:34:59.299
MAGA RALLY TO SHOW UP  TO THE 
LARGEST RALLY TO STOP 

04:35:04.221 --> 04:35:06.948
THE STEEL. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SEEMS TO HAVE OTHER PLANS FOR 

04:35:07.178 --> 04:35:11.110
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT THAT
RALLY ALSO. WOMEN FOR AMERICA 

04:35:11.346 --> 04:35:15.257
FIRST HAD INITIALLY PLANNED FOR 
THE RALLY GOERS TO REMAIN AT THE

04:35:15.624 --> 04:35:21.143
ELLIPSE UNTIL THE COUNTING OF 
THE STATE ELECTORAL SLATES WAS 

04:35:21.375 --> 04:35:23.488
COMPLETED JUST LIKE THEY HAVE 
REMAINED AT FREEDOM PLAZA AFTER 

04:35:23.721 --> 04:35:25.721
THE SECOND MILLION MAGA 

04:35:28.860 --> 04:35:31.327
MARCH.  IN FACT, THE PERMIT 
STATED IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS 

04:35:31.555 --> 04:35:33.597
THAT THE MARCH FROM THE ELLIPSE 
WAS 

04:35:37.795 --> 04:35:40.231
NOT PERMITTED. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 

04:35:40.458 --> 04:35:43.968
TEAM BECAME INVOLVED IN THE 
PLANNING THAT THE MARCH FROM THE

04:35:44.198 --> 04:35:49.982
ELLIPSE TO THE CAPITAL CAME 
ABOUT. IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION 

04:35:50.210 --> 04:35:56.693
OF THE ORIGINAL PERMIT. THIS WAS
NOT A COINCIDENCE. NONE OF THIS 

04:35:57.208 --> 04:35:59.996
WAS. DONALD TRUMP OVER MANY 
MONTHS 

04:36:03.794 --> 04:36:08.475
CULTIVATED VIOLENCE, PRAISED IT 
AND THEN WHEN HE SAW THE 

04:36:08.708 --> 04:36:10.961
VIOLENCE HIS SUPPORTERS WERE 
CAPABLE OF, HE CHANNELED IT TO 

04:36:11.926 --> 04:36:17.001
HIS BIG WILD HISTORIC EVENT. HE 
ORGANIZED JANUARY 6 WITH THE 

04:36:17.812 --> 04:36:20.876
SAME PEOPLE THAT HAD JUST 
ORGANIZED A RALLY RESULTING IN 

04:36:22.078 --> 04:36:25.999
SUBSTANTIAL VIOLENCE AND MADE 
ABSOLUTELY SURE THIS TIME THESE 

04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:31.216
VIOLENT A RALLY GOERS WOULDN'T 
JUST REMAIN IN PLACE. HE MADE 

04:36:31.584 --> 04:36:38.563
SURE THAT THOSE VIOLENT PEOPLE 
WOULD LITERALLY MARCH RIGHT HERE

04:36:38.802 --> 04:36:46.077
TO OUR STEPS FROM THE ELLIPSE TO
THE CAPITAL TO STOP THE STEEL. 

04:36:47.882 --> 04:36:49.882
HIS CALVARY, THIS 

04:36:51.733 --> 04:36:53.989
WAS DELIBERATE. AND BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

04:36:54.221 --> 04:36:57.512
INCITED THIS, BECAUSE HE WAS 
ORCHESTRATING THIS, BECAUSE HE 

04:36:57.741 --> 04:37:02.153
WAS INVITING THEM, THE 
INSURGENTS WERE NOT SHY ABOUT 

04:37:05.550 --> 04:37:07.550
THEIR PLANNING. THEY BELIEVE 
THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE ORDERS 

04:37:07.768 --> 04:37:11.503
OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THEY 
WERE AS THE TWEET WE JUST SAW 

04:37:11.749 --> 04:37:17.337
QUITE LITERALLY HIS CALVARY. SO 
THEY POSTED EXACT BLUEPRINTS OF 

04:37:17.579 --> 04:37:19.967
THE ATTACK OPENLY, 

04:37:23.834 --> 04:37:28.497
LOUDLY, PROUDLY. THEY DID THIS 
ALL OVER PUBLIC FORUMS. THESE 

04:37:28.728 --> 04:37:31.074
WERE NOT JUST HIDDEN POSTS AND 
DARK WEBSITES THAT TRUMP WOULD 

04:37:31.305 --> 04:37:35.346
NOT HAVE SEEN, QUITE THE 
OPPOSITE. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT

04:37:36.834 --> 04:37:41.165
TRUMPS TEAM MONITORED THESE 
WEBSITES. WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE 

04:37:41.453 --> 04:37:43.453
HIS ADVISORS 

04:37:44.750 --> 04:37:47.367
CONFIRM IT AND ASK WHITE HOUSE 
AND CAN PINE INSIDERS YOU 

04:37:51.790 --> 04:37:54.483
WILL READ WHO HAVE KNOWN BOTH 
GAVINO AND THE PRESIDENT FOUR 

04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:57.033
YEARS SAID THERE WAS NO WAY 
THAT'S GAVINO AND THE TRUMP 

04:37:57.263 --> 04:37:59.580
SOCIAL MEDIA OPERATION WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE PLAN 

04:37:59.813 --> 04:38:04.765
CIRCULATING ONLINE TO STORM THE 
CAPITAL. BECAUSE AND I QUOTE THE

04:38:04.992 --> 04:38:06.992
TRUMP OPERATION CLOSELY 
MONITORED THE WEB'S 

04:38:09.533 --> 04:38:11.388
DARKEST CORNERS RANGING FROM 
MAINSTREAM SITES SUCH AS 

04:38:11.389 --> 04:38:15.051
TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND REDDIT TO 
FRINGE MESSAGE BOARDS LIKE 

04:38:15.418 --> 04:38:17.418
FORTUNE 

04:38:18.868 --> 04:38:21.425
AND -- TO THE DONALD.WHEN, AN 
OFFSHOOT 

04:38:25.985 --> 04:38:28.010
OF A BAND REDDIT COMMUNITY 
DEDICATED TO RAPIDLY SUPPORTING 

04:38:28.248 --> 04:38:33.771
ALL THINGS TRUMP. THEY ACTIVELY 
MONITORED THE EXACT SITES LIKE 

04:38:37.568 --> 04:38:41.017
THE DONALD.WHEN ON WHICH THESE 
INSURRECTIONIST THROAT TO THEIR 

04:38:41.252 --> 04:38:43.252
POSTS. SO WHAT WOULD TRUMP AND 
HIS TEAM 

04:38:46.299 --> 04:38:48.299
HAVE SEEN WHEN THEY WERE 
MONITORING THESE SITES? WHAT 

04:38:48.509 --> 04:38:50.880
WOULD HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE SAID? 
THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN A CLEAR 

04:38:51.122 --> 04:38:53.122
ROADMAP OF EXACTLY 

04:38:55.848 --> 04:38:58.186
WHAT HAPPENED. THIS IS AN 
EXAMPLE OF A POST THAT WAS 

04:38:58.550 --> 04:39:00.833
CAPTURED FROM ONE OF THE SITES 
DEDICATED TO DONALD TRUMP THAT 

04:39:01.061 --> 04:39:05.217
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. SHORTLY 
BEFORE THE SITE WAS TAKEN DOWN. 

04:39:05.447 --> 04:39:11.606
THE MEME READS QUOTE THE CAPITAL
IS OUR GOAL. EVERYTHING ELSE IS 

04:39:14.733 --> 04:39:18.598
A DISTRACTION. EVERY CORRUPT 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS LOCKED IN ONE

04:39:18.966 --> 04:39:25.148
ROOM AND SURROUNDED BY REAL 
AMERICANS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT

04:39:25.379 --> 04:39:30.568
WILL NEVER PRESENT ITSELF AGAIN.
LET THAT SINK IN. THINK 

04:39:34.033 --> 04:39:37.972
ABOUT THAT. THE EXACT THING THAT
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6, THAT WAS 

04:39:40.118 --> 04:39:45.602
THEIR GOAL. AND THEY SAID IT OUT
LOUD ON SITES THAT THE TRUMP 

04:39:45.831 --> 04:39:47.831
ADMINISTRATION WAS 

04:39:49.267 --> 04:39:51.267
ACTIVELY MONITORING. A 
THIRD-PARTY SITE SHOULD A POST 

04:39:53.533 --> 04:39:57.714
ON THE DONALD.WIN WHERE ONE USER
POSTED QUOTE  THIS CANNOT SIMPLY

04:39:57.945 --> 04:40:03.382
BE A PROTEST. IT HAS TO BE THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MAGA 

04:40:03.613 --> 04:40:07.300
MILITIA WITH THE COMMAND OFFICES
SET UP  WITH ALL FURTHER MILITIA

04:40:07.748 --> 04:40:12.106
TACTICAL MISSIONS SPREADING FROM
THERE. ANOTHER USER SAID IN 

04:40:15.468 --> 04:40:19.531
RESPONSE QUOTE WE WILL HAVE TO 
ACHIEVE AN ACTUAL TACTICAL 

04:40:19.764 --> 04:40:23.425
VICTORY LIKE STORMING AND 
OCCUPYING THE CAPITAL. TO HAVE 

04:40:23.655 --> 04:40:28.262
THE INTENDED EFFECT. THAT IS 
WHAT THEY UNDERSTOOD DONALD 

04:40:28.494 --> 04:40:33.563
TRUMP TO WANT. THERE IT IS IN 
BLACK AND WHITE. THEY EXPLAINED 

04:40:33.792 --> 04:40:35.887
WHY THEY FELT JUSTIFIED IN THIS.
ANOTHER POSTER ON THE 

04:40:40.594 --> 04:40:42.896
FORM THAT DONALD.WIN WROTE ON 
JANUARY 4 QUOTE IF CONGRESS 

04:40:43.261 --> 04:40:45.261
ILLEGALLY CERTIFIES BY THE 

04:40:47.150 --> 04:40:50.290
NEED  -- BIDEN, TRUMP WOULD HAVE
NO CHOICE BUT TO DEMAND US TO 

04:40:50.519 --> 04:40:54.230
STORM CONGRESS AND KILLED/BE TO 
THEM UP HERE. 

04:40:57.313 --> 04:40:59.653
DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE NO 
CHOICE. THAT IS WHAT HE MADE 

04:41:00.965 --> 04:41:04.435
THEM BELIEVE TO THE POINT HIS 
SUPPORTERS FELT JUSTIFIED EVEN 

04:41:04.678 --> 04:41:09.392
AND CARRYING WEAPONS AND 
STORMING OUR CAPITAL. THIS WAS 

04:41:09.629 --> 04:41:14.655
IN POST AFTER POST. HERE IS 
ANOTHER. WHEN DISCUSSING HOW TO 

04:41:14.902 --> 04:41:18.935
CARRY GUNS INTO DC, ONE NOTED 
QUOTE YES IT IS A LEGAL BUT THIS

04:41:20.876 --> 04:41:28.592
IS WAR AND WE ARE CLEARLY IN A 
POST LEGAL PHASE OF OUR SOCIETY.

04:41:28.827 --> 04:41:34.203
WHAT? THEY TREATED IT AS A WAR 
AND THEY MEANT IT. THE MORNING 

04:41:34.438 --> 04:41:37.402
OF THE ATTACK UNDER THE THREAD 
TODAY I TOLD MY 

04:41:41.789 --> 04:41:44.122
KIDS GOODBYE, ONE POSTER WROTE 
TODAY I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT 

04:41:44.348 --> 04:41:47.229
CONVERSATION WITH MY CHILDREN 
THAT DADDY MIGHT NOT COME HOME 

04:41:48.492 --> 04:41:52.790
FROM DC. WITHIN A MATTER OF 
HOURS, THAT POST AMASSED 

04:41:55.808 --> 04:41:58.307
4000 LIKES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 
TRULY MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT 

04:41:58.534 --> 04:42:02.510
THEIR ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN 
AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PATRIOTIC 

04:42:02.746 --> 04:42:09.738
DUTY TO FIGHT TO STEAL IT BACK. 
PATRIOTIC, A TERM HE GAVE THOSE 

04:42:09.963 --> 04:42:13.338
WHO USE VIOLENCE FOR HIM AND 
THEY WERE WILLING TO SAY GOODBYE

04:42:13.582 --> 04:42:15.582
TO THEIR CHILDREN FOR 

04:42:17.947 --> 04:42:20.159
THIS FIGHT. THERE SUPPORTERS 
DIDN'T JUST RELY ON ENTERING THE

04:42:20.388 --> 04:42:27.130
CAPITAL WITH GUNS HAPHAZARDLY. 
THEY HAD MAPS OF THIS BUILDING. 

04:42:27.360 --> 04:42:30.450
THEY TALKED THROUGH WHICH 
TUNNELS TO USE AND HOW TO GET TO

04:42:30.677 --> 04:42:32.677
THE SENATE CHAMBER. 

04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:38.555
THERE WERE SPECIFIC FLOOR PLANS 
AND LAYOUTS OF THE CAPITAL 

04:42:38.790 --> 04:42:42.007
ALONGSIDE HOPES OF OVERWHELMING 
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO QUOTE FIND 

04:42:42.725 --> 04:42:44.725
THE TUNNELS, ARREST THE 

04:42:48.351 --> 04:42:50.691
WORST TRADERS. POSTERS ALSO 
FIXATED ON WHAT THEY SAW AS 

04:42:51.073 --> 04:42:54.511
THEIR ABILITY TO EASILY 
OVERWHELM THE CAPITAL POLICE AS 

04:42:54.747 --> 04:42:57.558
QUOTE THERE ARE ONLY AROUND 2000
OF THEM AND AGAIN THEY URGE 

04:42:57.791 --> 04:43:03.658
QUOTE THE CAPITAL IS OUR GOAL. 
EVERYTHING ELSE IS A 

04:43:03.890 --> 04:43:05.890
DISTRACTION. THERE WERE HUNDREDS
OF 

04:43:08.323 --> 04:43:10.990
THESE POSTS, HUNDREDS, MONITORED
BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

04:43:13.205 --> 04:43:17.415
THESE POSTS WERE CHILLINGLY 
ACCURATE RIGHT DOWN TO 

04:43:20.109 --> 04:43:22.795
COMMUNICATION DEVICES. A NEW 
AFFIDAVIT FILED BY THE FBI 

04:43:23.042 --> 04:43:25.042
DESCRIBED PREPARATIONS BY THE 

04:43:28.570 --> 04:43:31.986
WHITE RING -- WING GROUP THE 
PROUD VOICE TO STORM THE CAPITAL

04:43:32.214 --> 04:43:33.836
INCLUDING USING WALKIE-TALKIES 
AND EARPIECES TO DIRECT 

04:43:33.837 --> 04:43:36.679
MOVEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE 
BUILDING. THIS HAPPENED. THAT IS

04:43:36.915 --> 04:43:40.685
THE LEVEL OF PLANNING AND EVENTS
THAT OCCURRED. THEY 

04:43:44.285 --> 04:43:47.612
HAD EARPIECES. YOU WILL SEE 
PROUD BOY MEMBER DOMINIC HAS AN 

04:43:47.839 --> 04:43:49.860
EARPIECE IN HIS RIGHT EAR 
CONSISTENT WITH 

04:43:54.756 --> 04:43:57.733
THE AFFIDAVIT. IN ADDITION TO 
THESE DETAILED POSTS, THEY MADE 

04:43:57.966 --> 04:44:00.333
CLEAR WHY THEY THOUGHT THEY 
SHOULD DO THIS. WHY THEY THOUGHT

04:44:00.565 --> 04:44:02.883
THEY COULD DO THIS. IT WASN'T 
JUST THEY WERE DOING IT 

04:44:03.121 --> 04:44:05.716
FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S 
ORDERS, THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD 

04:44:07.236 --> 04:44:12.132
HELP THEM. A THIRD-PARTY SITE 
CAPTURED A POST ON THE 

04:44:12.364 --> 04:44:14.666
DONALD.WIN AGAIN. THE SITE 
MONITORED BY TRUMPS TEAM  AND HE

04:44:17.180 --> 04:44:21.448
WROTE QUOTE HE MEANING DONALD 
TRUMP IN THIS INSTANCE CAN ORDER

04:44:21.681 --> 04:44:26.633
THE GUARD TO STAND DOWN IF 
NEEDED. UNFORTUNATELY, HE HAS NO

04:44:26.863 --> 04:44:30.344
CONTROL OVER THE CAPITAL POLICE 
BUT THERE ARE ONLY AROUND 2000 

04:44:32.413 --> 04:44:37.126
OF THEM AND ARE USELESS FINANCES
OR GIRLS. IT IS ALL RIGHT THERE.

04:44:37.361 --> 04:44:42.825
THE OVERALL GOAL, MAPS OF THE 
CAPITAL, THE WEAPONS, 

04:44:45.415 --> 04:44:48.533
COMMUNICATION DEVICES, THEY EVEN
SAID PUBLICLY OPENLY, PROUDLY 

04:44:48.766 --> 04:44:53.946
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HELP 
THEM TO COMEDY OR THE NATIONAL 

04:44:54.188 --> 04:44:56.188
GUARD SO ALL THEY HAVE TO DO 

04:45:00.387 --> 04:45:02.612
IS OVERWHELM THE 2000 CAPITAL 
POLICE OFFICERS. THIS WAS 

04:45:02.845 --> 04:45:06.423
REPORTED IN THE NBC NEWS AND THE
WASHINGTON POST WITH HEADLINES 

04:45:06.653 --> 04:45:08.653
LIKE VIOLENT THREATS RIPPLED 
THROUGH FAR RIGHT INTERNET FORMS

04:45:08.721 --> 04:45:13.395
AHEAD OF PROTESTS, PRO-TRUMP 
FORMS ERUPT WITH VIOLENT THREATS

04:45:13.635 --> 04:45:15.635
AHEAD OF 

04:45:18.450 --> 04:45:21.139
WEDNESDAY'S RALLY AGAINST THE 
2020 ELECTION. FOX NEWS ALSO 

04:45:21.372 --> 04:45:24.041
REPORTED THAT THE PROUD BOYS 
WOULD COME TO THE JANUARY 6 THE 

04:45:24.275 --> 04:45:26.391
RALLY PREPARED FOR VIOLENT 
ACTION EVEN QUOTING A PROUD BOY 

04:45:26.621 --> 04:45:33.326
MEMBER WHO SAID THEY WOULD QUOTE
END -- INCOGNITO SPREAD AROUND 

04:45:33.567 --> 04:45:35.567
DOWNTOWN DC IN 

04:45:38.775 --> 04:45:41.054
SMALLER NUMBERS. CITY OFFICIALS 
SEEN THESE SAME WARNINGS ALSO 

04:45:41.287 --> 04:45:45.427
PUBLICLY WARNED ABOUT THE 
VIOLENCE AND UNLAWFUL WEAPONS AT

04:45:45.681 --> 04:45:49.616
THE EVENT. DC MAYOR CAUTIONED 
RESIDENTS OF THE DISTRICT OF 

04:45:49.854 --> 04:45:53.403
COLUMBIA TO AVOID THE DOWNTOWN 
AREA WHILE THE RALLY ATTENDEES 

04:45:53.637 --> 04:45:55.637
WERE 

04:45:57.530 --> 04:46:01.646
IN TOWN. FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
WARNED OF THESE THREATS ALSO. ON

04:46:01.877 --> 04:46:04.009
JANUARY 3, A CAPITAL POLICE 
INTELLIGENCE REPORT WARNED OF A 

04:46:04.244 --> 04:46:08.132
VIOLENT SCENARIO IN WHICH 
CONGRESS ITSELF COULD BE 

04:46:11.746 --> 04:46:13.869
THE TARGET OF THE ANGRY 
SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP ON

04:46:14.101 --> 04:46:16.101
JANUARY 6. ACCORDING TO 

04:46:19.382 --> 04:46:21.890
THAT REPORT OBTAINED BY THE 
WASHINGTON POST, SUPPORTERS OF 

04:46:22.121 --> 04:46:25.359
THE CURRENT PRESIDENT SEE 
JANUARY 6, 2021 AS THE LAST 

04:46:25.587 --> 04:46:27.673
OPPORTUNITY TO OVERTURN THE 
RESULTS OF THE 

04:46:31.244 --> 04:46:33.680
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THIS 
SENSE OF DESPERATION AND 

04:46:33.918 --> 04:46:37.564
DISAPPOINTMENT MAY LEAD TO MORE 
INCENTIVES TO BECOME VIOLENT. 

04:46:37.797 --> 04:46:39.797
UNLIKE 

04:46:41.000 --> 04:46:43.000
PREVIOUS POSTS ELECTION 
PROTESTS, THE TARGETS OF THE 

04:46:44.648 --> 04:46:46.310
PRO-TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE NOT 
NECESSARILY THE COUNTER 

04:46:46.311 --> 04:46:51.148
PROTESTERS AS THEY WERE 
PREVIOUSLY BUT RATHER CONGRESS 

04:46:51.383 --> 04:46:55.595
ITSELF IS THE TARGET FOR JANUARY
6. THE DAY BEFORE THE WRITERS 

04:46:55.825 --> 04:47:00.119
STORMED TO THE CONGRESS AN FBI 
OFFICE IN VIRGINIA ALSO ISSUED 

04:47:00.352 --> 04:47:03.288
AN EXPLICIT WARNING THAT 
EXTREMISTS WERE PREPARING TO 

04:47:03.524 --> 04:47:05.524
TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON TO COMMIT 
VIOLENCE AND 

04:47:08.616 --> 04:47:13.183
QUOTE WAR. ACCORDING TO INTERNAL
REPORTS. THE FBI REPORTS DECIDED

04:47:13.411 --> 04:47:17.588
TO AN ONLINE POST OR THE USER 
DECLARED THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS 

04:47:17.819 --> 04:47:19.819
SHOULD GO TO WASHINGTON AND GET 
VIOLENT. THE SUPPORTERS 

04:47:23.448 --> 04:47:26.386
SAID QUOTE STOP CALLING THIS A 
MARCH OR A RALLY OR A PROTEST. 

04:47:26.619 --> 04:47:33.057
GO THERE READY FOR WAR. WE GET 
OUR PRESIDENT OR WE DIE. THESE 

04:47:33.285 --> 04:47:37.753
THREAT WARNINGS WERE NOT JUST 
HYPOTHETICAL. ACTUAL ARREST 

04:47:37.983 --> 04:47:40.725
OCCURRED IN THE DAYS LEADING TO 
THE ATTACK ON JANUARY 4 TWO DAYS

04:47:40.955 --> 04:47:44.921
BEFORE THE RALLY, ONE EXTREMELY 
WELL-PUBLICIZED ARREST WAS OF A 

04:47:45.151 --> 04:47:47.320
PROBABLY LEADER WHO DESTROYED A 
CHURCHES BLACK 

04:47:50.864 --> 04:47:52.965

04:48:01.244 --> 04:48:03.130
ARRESTED, HE WAS CARRYING 
HIGH-CAPACITY FIREARM MAGAZINES 

04:48:03.131 --> 04:48:05.494
WHICH SHE CLAIMED WERE MEANT TO 
BE SUPPLIED TO ANOTHER RALLY 

04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:08.110
ATTENDEE FORD 

04:48:11.316 --> 04:48:13.316
JANUARY 6.

04:48:15.245 --> 04:48:17.583
BY THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 6 
ATTACK, DC POLICE HAD ALREADY 

04:48:17.815 --> 04:48:19.947
MADE SIX ARRESTS IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE PLANNED PROTEST ON 

04:48:20.174 --> 04:48:22.174
CHARGES OF CARRYING WEAPONS, 
AMMUNITIONS, ASSAULT, 

04:48:25.598 --> 04:48:30.753
ASSAULTING POLICE. THIS IS ALL 
IN PUBLIC VIEW. ALL OF IT. THE 

04:48:30.982 --> 04:48:36.162
TRUTH IS USUALLY SEEN AND RARELY
HEARD. TRUTH IS TRUTH WHETHER 

04:48:36.397 --> 04:48:43.106
DENIED OR NOT. THE TRUTH IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD SPENT MONTHS

04:48:43.334 --> 04:48:47.578
CALLING HIS SUPPORTERS TO A 
MARCH ON A SPECIFIC DAY AT A 

04:48:49.780 --> 04:48:55.113
SPECIFIC TIME IN SPECIFIC PLACES
TO STOP THE CERTIFICATION. AND 

04:48:55.348 --> 04:48:58.166
LEADING UP TO THE EVENT, THERE 
WERE 

04:49:02.164 --> 04:49:04.536
HUNDREDS OF HOSTS ONLINE SHOWING
THAT HIS SUPPORTERS TOOK THIS AS

04:49:04.769 --> 04:49:08.767
A CALL TO ARMS TO ATTACK THE 
CAPITAL. THERE WERE DETAILED 

04:49:08.995 --> 04:49:12.883
POSTS OF PLANS TO ATTACK ONLINE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WARNED THAT 

04:49:14.560 --> 04:49:16.842
THESE POSTS WERE REAL THREATS 
AND EVEN MADE ARRESTS DAYS 

04:49:17.067 --> 04:49:24.138
LEADING UP TO THE ATTACK. AND 
YET, IN THE FACE OF ALL OF THIS,

04:49:24.373 --> 04:49:27.146
THESE CREDIBLE WARNINGS OF 
SERIOUS DANGEROUS THREATS TO OUR

04:49:27.378 --> 04:49:29.910
CAPITAL WHEN THOSE THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF

04:49:31.011 --> 04:49:34.591
PRESIDENT TRUMP READY TO TAKE 
ORDERS AND ATTACK, THIS IS WHAT 

04:49:36.697 --> 04:49:42.672
HE SAID. WE ARE GOING TO THE 
CAPITAL AND WE FIGHT. WE FIGHT 

04:49:44.213 --> 04:49:49.118
LIKE ,  AND IF YOU DON'T FIGHT 
LIKE , YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE

04:49:49.348 --> 04:49:55.910
A COUNTRY ANYMORE. THAT IS WHY 
THIS IS DIFFERENT. THAT IS WHY 

04:49:56.143 --> 04:49:58.143
HE MUST BE CONVICTED 

04:50:02.021 --> 04:50:04.021
AND DISQUALIFIED.

04:50:19.347 --> 04:50:22.811
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPRESENTATIVE DEAN WILL NOW 
RETURN TO THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 

04:50:23.041 --> 04:50:25.041
6. SHALL DEMONSTRATE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S REPEATED INCITEMENT OF 

04:50:27.480 --> 04:50:30.231
THE CROWD THAT MORNING AS HE 
DIRECTED THEM TO THE CAPITAL AND

04:50:30.472 --> 04:50:32.472
HIS LAST DITCH EFFORT TO RETAIN 
HIS HOLD 

04:50:36.332 --> 04:50:38.332
ON POWER.

04:51:09.728 --> 04:51:12.200
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FOR ME AND FOR MANY 
AMERICANS, JANUARY 6 IS FOREVER 

04:51:12.429 --> 04:51:14.429
ETCHED IN 

04:51:17.175 --> 04:51:21.519
OUR MEMORIES. I WENT TO WORK 
WITH A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT. THE 

04:51:21.749 --> 04:51:24.797
START OF MY SECOND TERM AND 
CONGRESS AND THE FIRST TIME I 

04:51:25.022 --> 04:51:26.888
WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE 
CERTIFICATION OF A PRESIDENTIAL 

04:51:26.889 --> 04:51:29.687
ELECTION. THEN WE ALL KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED. I KNOW MANY OF US HAVE

04:51:29.913 --> 04:51:32.138
SIMILAR EXPERIENCES FROM THAT 
DAY BUT I WILL BRIEFLY SHARE 

04:51:32.368 --> 04:51:34.692
MINE. I STOOD WITH COLLEAGUES IN
THE GALLERY ABOVE THE HOUSE 

04:51:34.923 --> 04:51:36.923
FLOOR TO OBSERVE THE 

04:51:38.978 --> 04:51:40.978
ARIZONA CHALLENGE. MOMENTS 
LATER, POLICE RADIOS REPORTED A 

04:51:40.983 --> 04:51:47.137
BREACH OF THE CAPITAL GROUNDS. 
SOMEONE SHOUTED UP TO US DUCK 

04:51:47.367 --> 04:51:52.625
AND THEN LIE DOWN AND THEN READY
YOUR GAS MASKS. 

04:51:57.058 --> 04:51:59.195
SHORTLY AFTER THERE WAS A 
TERRIFYING BANGING ON THE 

04:52:00.107 --> 04:52:02.107
CHAMBER DOORS. I WILL NEVER 
FORGET 

04:52:04.975 --> 04:52:09.656
THAT SOUND. SHOUTS AND PANICKED 
CALLS TO MY HUSBAND AND TO MY 

04:52:09.886 --> 04:52:12.570
SONS, INSTRUCTIONS TO FLEE AND 
THEN THE CONSTANT WORRYING OF 

04:52:12.802 --> 04:52:14.802
THE GAS MASKS FILTERING 

04:52:16.558 --> 04:52:18.637
THE AIR. THE CHAMBER OF THE 
STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

04:52:18.871 --> 04:52:25.091
TURNED TO CHAOS. FOR DONALD 
TRUMP, IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT 

04:52:25.328 --> 04:52:27.441
DAY. EARLIER I SHOWED YOU DONALD
TRUMPS DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO 

04:52:29.560 --> 04:52:32.598
MAINTAIN POWER IGNORING ADVERSE 
COURT RULINGS ATTACKING ELECTED 

04:52:32.961 --> 04:52:35.088
OFFICIALS, PRESSURING HIS 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EVEN 

04:52:35.320 --> 04:52:39.471
ATTACKING HIS OWN VICE 
PRESIDENT. YOU SAW A MAN WHO 

04:52:39.710 --> 04:52:43.980
REFUSED TO LOSE, WHO WAS 
DESPERATE TO RETAIN POWER BY ANY

04:52:44.794 --> 04:52:47.500
MEANS NECESSARY. YOU SAW A MAN 
WILLING TO ATTACK ANYONE AND 

04:52:47.729 --> 04:52:52.753
EVERYONE WHO GOT IN HIS WAY. YOU
SAW A MAN WHO THOUGHT HE COULD 

04:52:52.980 --> 04:52:56.427
PLAY BY DIFFERENT RULES. HE TOLD
HIS SUPPORTERS AS MY COLLEAGUE 

04:52:56.660 --> 04:53:00.488
JUST SHOWED YOU EXACTLY WHAT HE 
THOUGHT THOSE DIFFERENT 

04:53:03.678 --> 04:53:05.678
RULES WERE. COMBAT, 

04:53:09.160 --> 04:53:12.324
FIGHT, VIOLENCE. THIS WAS NOT 
JUST ONE SPEECH. THIS WAS WEEKS 

04:53:12.557 --> 04:53:16.641
AND WEEKS OF DELIBERATE EFFORT 
BY DONALD TRUMP TO OVERTURN THE 

04:53:17.694 --> 04:53:19.799
ELECTION RESULTS SO THAT HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE UP 

04:53:23.592 --> 04:53:26.042
THE PRESIDENCY. THE SPEECH ON 
JANUARY 6 THE BUILDS ON, REFERS 

04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:29.007
TO AND AMPLIFIES THAT SAME 
PATTERN, THE PATTERN TRUMP HAD 

04:53:29.238 --> 04:53:31.238
USED AND BROADCASTED FOUR 
MONTHS. HE REFUSED 

04:53:35.506 --> 04:53:40.504
TO LOSE HIS ATTACKS ON OTHERS 
AND IS DIFFERENT RULES. THE ONLY

04:53:40.733 --> 04:53:43.053
THING DIFFERENT ABOUT HIS SPEECH
ON JANUARY 6 FROM ALL THESE 

04:53:43.282 --> 04:53:45.282
OTHER TIMES THAT WE 

04:53:47.760 --> 04:53:50.531
WENT THROUGH WAS THAT HE WAS NO 
LONGER TELLING HIS BASE THAT 

04:53:50.789 --> 04:53:53.411
THEY HAD TO FIGHT TO STOP THE 
STEEL. HE WAS FINALLY TELLING 

04:53:53.645 --> 04:53:55.645
THEM NOW IS THE TIME TO 

04:53:58.659 --> 04:54:03.924
DO IT. HERE IS THE PLACE AND 
HERE IS HOW. FOUR WEEKS, HE 

04:54:04.161 --> 04:54:06.985
URGED HIS SUPPORTERS TO SHOW UP 
AT A SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE AND

04:54:07.226 --> 04:54:09.678
WHEN THEY GOT THERE, HE TOLD 
THEM EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED. 

04:54:09.909 --> 04:54:11.909
LET'S START WITH HIS 
DESPERATION. YOU SAW HOW MUCH 

04:54:12.026 --> 04:54:15.423
PLANNING WENT INTO JANUARY 6 AND
WHEN THE DAY ARRIVED, DONALD 

04:54:15.659 --> 04:54:20.145
TRUMPS DESPERATION WAS IN FULL 
FORCE. BETWEEN THE TIME HE WOKE 

04:54:20.376 --> 04:54:25.799
UP ON JANUARY 5 AND THE START OF
THE SAVE AMERICA MARCH, THAT 

04:54:26.032 --> 04:54:28.032
NEXT DAY, HE HAD TWEETED 

04:54:32.042 --> 04:54:34.954
34 TIMES. ONE DONALD TRUMP WANTS
TO GET HIS MESSAGE ACROSS, HE IS

04:54:35.188 --> 04:54:39.635
NOT SHY AS YOU ALL KNOW. THESE 
TWEETS WERE RELENTLESS AND THESE

04:54:39.860 --> 04:54:43.668
TWEETS ALL CENTERED ON HIS 
SINGULAR FOCUS, HIS DRUMBEATS TO

04:54:43.902 --> 04:54:45.909
MOTIVATE, ANGER AND INSIGHT HIS 
SUPPORTERS, HIS 

04:54:49.098 --> 04:54:53.394
BIG LIE. THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION HAD BEEN RIGGED. IT HAD

04:54:53.628 --> 04:54:56.621
BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM AND THEY 
HAD TO FIGHT TO STOP IT. AND THE

04:54:56.849 --> 04:55:01.511
TIMING WAS NO COINCIDENCE. HE 
SENT 34 TWEETS BECAUSE THIS WAS 

04:55:01.737 --> 04:55:05.397
HIS LAST CHANCE TO RILE UP HIS 
SUPPORTERS BEFORE THE BIG 

04:55:05.639 --> 04:55:07.639
HISTORIC WILD EVENT HE 

04:55:10.225 --> 04:55:12.853
HAD PLANNED. NOW I WON'T GO 
THROUGH ALL OF THESE TWEETS BUT 

04:55:13.087 --> 04:55:15.087
LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT 

04:55:18.286 --> 04:55:23.921
IF YOU. AT 1 AM, HE TWEETED IF 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE COMES 

04:55:24.153 --> 04:55:26.751
THROUGH FOR US, WE WILL WIN THE 
PRESIDENCY. MIKE CAN SEND IT 

04:55:26.984 --> 04:55:29.657
BACK. THIS WILL LOOK FAMILIAR TO
YOU BECAUSE MR. LOU JUST SHOWED 

04:55:29.894 --> 04:55:31.997
YOU HOW TRUMP HAD PRIVATELY HE 
WAS PRESSURING AND PUBLICLY 

04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:35.269
ATTACKING HIS VICE PRESIDENT TO 
STOP THE CERTIFICATION. WHEN 

04:55:35.500 --> 04:55:37.500
VICE PRESIDENT 

04:55:40.614 --> 04:55:43.072
PENCE REFUSED, WHEN HE EXPLAINED
TO THE CONSTITUTION SIMPLY DOES 

04:55:43.304 --> 04:55:45.149
NOT ALLOW HIM TO STOP 
CERTIFICATION, DONALD TRUMP 

04:55:45.150 --> 04:55:47.150
PROVOKED HIS BASE TO 

04:55:49.628 --> 04:55:52.151
ATTACK HIM. THE LATE AND THE 
EVENING TWEET WAS NO DIFFERENT. 

04:55:52.391 --> 04:55:54.947
IT JUST GOT MORE FORCEFUL. LET'S
BE CLEAR WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS 

04:55:55.177 --> 04:55:58.576
SAYING THAT VICE PRESIDENT PENCE
COULD SEND BACK THE 

04:55:58.823 --> 04:56:03.291
CERTIFICATION WAS NOT TRUE. FOR 
ONE THING ALL 50 STATES HAD 

04:56:03.521 --> 04:56:07.109
RATIFIED THIS ELECTION AND FOR 
ANOTHER, VICE 

04:56:10.759 --> 04:56:13.469
PRESIDENT PENCE EXPLAINED TO HIM
THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER 

04:56:13.696 --> 04:56:15.970
TO UNILATERALLY OVERTURN STATES 
VOTES AND JUST SEND THE 

04:56:17.058 --> 04:56:20.521
CERTIFICATION BACK. DONALD TRUMP
KNEW THIS BUT THIS WAS HIS 

04:56:23.556 --> 04:56:27.439
LAST CHANCE. TO GET HIS VICE 
PRESIDENT TO STOP CERTIFICATION 

04:56:27.666 --> 04:56:32.750
AND SO HE WAS WILLING TO SAY OR 
DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. HIS 

04:56:32.977 --> 04:56:34.982
TWEETS ATTACKING THE ELECTION AS
FRAUDULENT ATTACKING HIS VICE 

04:56:35.221 --> 04:56:37.089
PRESIDENT AND URGING HIS 
SUPPORTERS TO FIGHT CONTINUED 

04:56:37.090 --> 04:56:43.550
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. HERE IS 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE. AT 8:17 AM, 

04:56:46.871 --> 04:56:51.273
TWEETED ALL MIKE PENCE HAS TO DO
IS SEND IT BACK TO THEM, BACK TO

04:56:51.505 --> 04:56:53.505
THE STATES, AND 

04:56:56.059 --> 04:56:58.994
WE WIN. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. 
EVEN THOUGH BY THEN, HE HAD 

04:57:01.744 --> 04:57:04.406
CLEARLY LOST. AS TRUMP CONTINUED
TWEETING THE SAVE AMERICA MARCH 

04:57:04.635 --> 04:57:07.905
AT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS NOW IN 
FULL SWING. THE SPEAKERS WHO 

04:57:08.134 --> 04:57:13.094
WARMED UP THE CROWD FOR TRUMP 
WERE MEMBERS OF HIS INNER 

04:57:13.337 --> 04:57:14.955
CIRCLE. FAMILY MEMBERS, HIS 
PERSONAL ATTORNEY, PEOPLE 

04:57:14.956 --> 04:57:16.956
PRESIDENT 

04:57:19.408 --> 04:57:22.105
TRUMP HAD DEPUTIZED TO SPEAK ON 
HIS BEHALF. SOME OF THE SPEAKERS

04:57:22.338 --> 04:57:24.663
ALSO SPOKE AT THE SECOND MILLION
MAGA MARCH WHICH RESULTED IN 

04:57:24.892 --> 04:57:26.892
SERIOUS VIOLENCE.  

04:57:28.558 --> 04:57:30.764
THE WARM-UP ACTS ON JANUARY 6 
FOCUSED ON PROMOTING DONALD 

04:57:30.993 --> 04:57:37.492
TRUMPS BIG LIE. THEY STOKED THE 
SAME FEARS, A STOLEN ELECTION OF

04:57:37.727 --> 04:57:39.727
FRAUD, OF RIPPING VICTORY AWAY 

04:57:42.574 --> 04:57:45.910
FROM THEM AND THE SPEAKERS TOLD 
THEM WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. AS THE

04:57:46.139 --> 04:57:49.476
CROWD ERUPTED AND FIGHT FOR 
TRUMP, CHANCE THROUGHOUT THAT 

04:57:49.707 --> 04:57:54.968
MORNING, DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR 
URGED THAT IS THE MESSAGE. THESE

04:57:55.209 --> 04:57:57.209
GUYS BETTER FIGHT 

04:58:00.361 --> 04:58:02.860
FOR TRUMP. THE SPEAKERS LASTED 
THREE HOURS REPEATING PRESIDENT 

04:58:03.086 --> 04:58:05.332
TRUMP'S MESSAGE AND FINALLY AT 
ABOUT NOON, DONALD TRUMP TOOK 

04:58:05.560 --> 04:58:10.077
THE STAGE WITH THE SEAL OF THE 
PRESIDENCY ON HIS PODIUM AND THE

04:58:10.311 --> 04:58:12.311
WHITE HOUSE AS 

04:58:15.596 --> 04:58:17.596
HIS BACKDROP.

04:58:19.545 --> 04:58:21.650
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE FOR MORE 
THAN 70 MINUTES. HIS NARRATIVE 

04:58:21.881 --> 04:58:24.225
WAS FAMILIAR. IT WAS THE SAME 
MESSAGE HE HAD SPENT MONTHS 

04:58:24.457 --> 04:58:26.667
SPREADING TO HIS SUPPORTERS. THE
BIG LIE, THE ELECTION WAS 

04:58:26.904 --> 04:58:28.904
STOLEN, THEY SHOULD 

04:58:30.508 --> 04:58:32.508
NEVER CONCEDE AND THAT HIS 
SUPPORTERS SHOULD BE PATRIOTS 

04:58:32.595 --> 04:58:38.426
AND FIGHT MUCH HARDER TO STOP 
THE STEEL, TO TAKE BACK OUR 

04:58:38.789 --> 04:58:41.385
COUNTRY. THE SAME PHRASES HE HAD
SPREAD FOUR WEEKS BUT NOW THE 

04:58:41.612 --> 04:58:43.612
MESSAGE 

04:58:46.358 --> 04:58:49.057
WAS IMMEDIATE. NOW IT WAS JUST 
NO LONGER JUST FIGHT, IT WAS 

04:58:49.292 --> 04:58:54.332
FIGHT RIGHT NOW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF US HERE TODAY DO NOT 

04:58:54.563 --> 04:58:57.475
WANT TO SEE OUR ELECTION VICTORY
STOLEN BY EMBOLDEN RADICAL LEFT 

04:58:57.706 --> 04:59:00.691
DEMOCRATS WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE
DOING AND STOLEN BY THE FAKE 

04:59:01.791 --> 04:59:04.840
NEWS MEDIA. THAT IS WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE AND WHAT THEY ARE 

04:59:05.071 --> 04:59:09.192
DOING. WILL NEVER GIVE UP AND WE
WILL NEVER CONCEDE. YOU DON'T 

04:59:09.420 --> 04:59:13.285
CONCEDE WHERE THERE IS THEFT 
INVOLVED. OUR COUNTRY HAS 

04:59:16.411 --> 04:59:19.430
HAD ENOUGH. WE WILL NOT TAKE IT 
ANYMORE AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS

04:59:20.076 --> 04:59:26.329
ALL ABOUT. AND TO USE A FAVORITE
TERM THAT ALL OF YOU PEOPLE 

04:59:26.557 --> 04:59:28.557
REALLY CAME UP WITH, WE WILL 
STOP 

04:59:33.407 --> 04:59:37.490
THE STEEL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT SET THE TONE. OUR 

04:59:37.725 --> 04:59:40.349
COUNTRY HAS HAD ENOUGH AND WE 
WILL NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. HE 

04:59:40.594 --> 04:59:43.400
TOLD THEM AND US RIGHT AT THE 
BEGINNING THAT THE ONLY WAY TO 

04:59:43.627 --> 04:59:46.298
TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY WAS TO 
FIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HE 

04:59:48.109 --> 04:59:51.816
SAID NEXT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RUDY, YOU DID A GREAT JOB. HE

04:59:52.044 --> 04:59:54.044
HAS 

04:59:55.411 --> 04:59:57.411
GOT GUTS. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

05:00:01.855 --> 05:00:04.715
REPUBLICAN PARTY, HE HAS GUTS, 
HE FIGHTS. 

05:00:04.716 --> 05:00:06.930
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MS. PLASKETT SHOWED YOU 
EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF DONALD 

05:00:07.156 --> 05:00:10.738
TRUMP WHEN CONFRONTED WITH 
VIOLENCE, PRAISING IT. WE SAW 

05:00:10.976 --> 05:00:15.501
HIM INSTRUCT THE PROUD BOYS A 
VIOLENT EXTREMIST GROUP TO STAND

05:00:15.730 --> 05:00:22.528
BACK AND STANDBY. THAT GROUP WAS
THERE ON JANUARY 6. WE SAW HIM 

05:00:22.760 --> 05:00:27.445
PRAISE A CARAVAN OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS AFTER THEY TRIED TO 

05:00:27.676 --> 05:00:31.821
DRIVE A BUS BELONGING TO THE 
BIDEN CAMPAIGN OFF THE ROAD. THE

05:00:32.047 --> 05:00:34.585
ORGANIZER OF THAT ATTACK WAS 
THERE ON JANUARY 6. WE SAW HIM 

05:00:35.627 --> 05:00:38.916
TEAM UP WITH THE ORGANIZERS OF 
THE VIOLENT SECOND MAGA MILLION 

05:00:41.111 --> 05:00:43.111
MARCH  TO PLAN HIS RALLY ON 

05:00:47.351 --> 05:00:50.935
JANUARY 6. WHAT DOES HE DO AT 
THAT RALLY? HE TELLS GIULIANI 

05:00:51.168 --> 05:00:53.767
HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB AT 
ADDRESSING THE CROWD SAYING HE 

05:00:53.997 --> 05:00:57.002
HAS GUTS TO CALL FOR FIGHTING 
AND TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS WHAT HE

05:01:01.769 --> 05:01:05.455
WAS PRAISING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO LET'S HAVE A TRIAL 

05:01:10.300 --> 05:01:13.281
BY COMBAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TRIAL BY COMBAT. DONALD TRUMP

05:01:15.041 --> 05:01:17.606
PRAISED RUDY, SAID HE DID A GOOD
JOB, HAD GUTS FORETELLING THE 

05:01:17.851 --> 05:01:21.390
CROWD THAT WE NEED TRIAL BY 
COMBAT. NEXT 

05:01:24.791 --> 05:01:28.545
MORE ATTACKS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL VICE PRESIDENT PENTZ HAS 

05:01:28.777 --> 05:01:34.339
TO DO IS SEND IT BACK TO THE 
STATES TO RECERTIFY AND WE 

05:01:34.566 --> 05:01:36.566
BECOME PRESIDENT AND YOU ARE THE

05:01:39.825 --> 05:01:41.680
HAPPIEST PEOPLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS ATTACK LIKE THE TWEETY 

05:01:41.681 --> 05:01:43.681
CENTER THAT MORNING HAD 

05:01:46.927 --> 05:01:48.927
A PURPOSE CONVINCING HIS 
SUPPORTERS THAT THE FUTURE OF 

05:01:49.163 --> 05:01:51.257
OUR COUNTRY OF OUR DEMOCRACY 
HINGED ON WHETHER VICE PRESIDENT

05:01:51.494 --> 05:01:53.572
PENCE WOULD OVERTURN THE 
ELECTION. SOMETHING HE KNEW 

05:01:53.800 --> 05:01:56.877
PENTZ COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT 
DO. HE CALLED OUT VICE PRESIDENT

05:01:57.106 --> 05:01:59.185
PENCE NINE TIMES THAT DAY AND 

05:02:03.176 --> 05:02:05.851
EACH TIME, HE GOT MORE FORCEFUL.
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID AT 12:15. 

05:02:06.088 --> 05:02:10.425
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT
MUCH HARDER AND MIKE PENCE IS 

05:02:10.659 --> 05:02:14.806
GOING TO HAVE TO COME THROUGH 
FOR US AND IF HE DOESN'T, THAT 

05:02:15.041 --> 05:02:17.041
WILL BE A SAD DAY FOR OUR 

05:02:20.240 --> 05:02:22.240
COUNTRY THE SAYS YOU ARE SWORN 
TO UPHOLD 

05:02:25.122 --> 05:02:28.632
OUR CONSTITUTION. NOW IT IS UP 
TO CONGRESS TO CONFRONT THIS 

05:02:28.861 --> 05:02:30.861
EGREGIOUS ASSAULT ON 

05:02:33.041 --> 05:02:36.000
OUR DEMOCRACY AND AFTER THIS, WE
ARE GOING TO WALK DOWN AND I 

05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:38.230
WILL BE THERE WITH YOU. WE ARE 
GOING TO 

05:02:42.177 --> 05:02:45.330
WALK DOWN ANYONE YOU WANT BUT I 
THINK RIGHT HERE WE ARE GOING TO

05:02:45.599 --> 05:02:51.110
WALK DOWN TO THE CAPITAL AND WE 
ARE GOING TO CHEER ON OUR BRAVE 

05:02:51.336 --> 05:02:53.336
SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN 

05:02:54.975 --> 05:02:57.988
AND WOMEN, AND WE ARE PROBABLY 
NOT GOING TO BE CHEERING SO MUCH

05:02:58.229 --> 05:03:00.229
FOR SOME 

05:03:02.493 --> 05:03:05.902
OF THEM. YOU WILL NEVER TAKE 
BACK OUR COUNTRY WITH WE CAN US.

05:03:06.138 --> 05:03:08.138
YOU HAVE TO SHOW STRENGTH AND 
YOU HAVE TO 

05:03:12.581 --> 05:03:14.910
BE STRONG. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT

05:03:15.135 --> 05:03:17.806
MUCH HARDER AND MIKE PENCE WILL 
HAVE TO COME THROUGH FOR US. 

05:03:18.037 --> 05:03:21.032
THAT IS WHAT HE SAID AND HE TOLD
THE CROWD WHAT HE MEANT AND 

05:03:21.266 --> 05:03:23.383
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO LITERALLY 
COMMANDING THEM TO CONFRONT US 

05:03:23.608 --> 05:03:28.170
AT THE CAPITAL. HE EVEN TOLD 
THEM HE'D WALK THERE WITH THEM 

05:03:28.397 --> 05:03:32.546
WHICH OF COURSE WAS NOT TRUE. 
THEN HE TOLD THEM EXACTLY WHAT 

05:03:32.776 --> 05:03:35.387
TO DO WHEN THEY GOT TO THE 
CAPITAL. YOU WILL NEVER TAKE 

05:03:35.617 --> 05:03:37.617
YOUR COUNTRY BACK 

05:03:40.407 --> 05:03:43.215
WITH WEAKNESS. YOU HAVE TO SHOW 
STRENGTH AND DON'T FORGET WHO 

05:03:43.465 --> 05:03:45.534
WAS STANDING THERE, THE SAME 
PEOPLE MS. PLASKETT DESCRIBED TO

05:03:45.761 --> 05:03:47.761
YOU. MANY PEOPLE VIOLENCE, 
VIOLENCE PEOPLE, LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:03:48.392 --> 05:03:51.079
HAD WARNED THEY WOULD BE ARMED 
AND WOULD BE TARGETING US. ONE 

05:03:51.310 --> 05:03:57.702
OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS KEY DEFENSES
FOCUSED ON WHAT HE SAID FOR A 

05:03:58.345 --> 05:04:00.345
FEW SECONDS, 15 MINUTES INTO 

05:04:04.172 --> 05:04:06.829
THE SPEECH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HERE 

05:04:07.061 --> 05:04:09.156
WILL SOON BE MARCHING OVER TO 
THE CAPITAL BUILDING TO 

05:04:09.386 --> 05:04:11.386
PEACEFULLY AND PATRIOTICALLY 
MAKE YOUR 

05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:17.150
VOICES HEARD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANY SPEECH SPANNING ALMOST 

05:04:18.256 --> 05:04:23.435
11,000 WORDS, YES WE DID CHECK, 
THAT WAS THE ONE TIME, THE ONLY 

05:04:23.661 --> 05:04:26.837
TIME THE PRESIDENT TRUMP USED 
THE WORD PEACEFUL OR ANY 

05:04:27.067 --> 05:04:29.067
SUGGESTION 

05:04:30.242 --> 05:04:32.242
OF NONVIOLENCE. THE IMPLICATION 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETS, THE 

05:04:32.351 --> 05:04:35.879
RALLY AND THE SPEECHES WERE 
CLEAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP USED THE 

05:04:36.107 --> 05:04:39.274
WORD FIGHT OR FIGHTING 20 TIMES 
INCLUDING TELLING THE CROWD THEY

05:04:39.503 --> 05:04:44.409
NEEDED TO FIGHT LIKE  TO SAVE 
OUR DEMOCRACY. WE KNOW HOW THE 

05:04:44.638 --> 05:04:48.847
CROWD RESPONDED TO DONALD TRUMPS
WORDS AND HE KNEW HOW THEY 

05:04:49.077 --> 05:04:51.391
RESPONDED TO HIS SPEECH. HERE IS
THE EVIDENCE AT HOW THE 

05:04:55.767 --> 05:04:57.767
CROWD REACTED.

05:05:27.927 --> 05:05:36.257
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TAKE THE CAPITAL. TAKE THE P 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- THE CAPITAL RIGHT 

05:05:42.690 --> 05:05:49.859
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; STORM THE CAPITAL, INVADE THE

05:05:50.093 --> 05:05:56.234
CAPITAL, FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT, 
FIGHT. TAKE THE CAPITAL RIGHT 

05:05:57.789 --> 05:05:59.789
NOW. THESE WERE THE WORDS OF 

05:06:02.657 --> 05:06:05.200
THE CROWD. TRUMP WAS TELLING 
THEM TO FIGHT AND HE WOULD KEEP 

05:06:05.566 --> 05:06:07.880
TELLING THEM TO FIGHT THROUGHOUT
THE REST OF HIS SPEECH. THESE 

05:06:08.118 --> 05:06:11.192
ARE NOT ONLY WORDS OF 
AGGRESSION, THEY ARE WORDS OF 

05:06:11.424 --> 05:06:13.943
INSURRECTION AND IF YOU HAVE ANY
DOUBT, LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS 

05:06:14.170 --> 05:06:16.170
NEXT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TODAY 

05:06:18.306 --> 05:06:20.748
WE SEE A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT 
BECAUSE RIGHT OVER THERE, RIGHT 

05:06:21.001 --> 05:06:25.679
THERE, WE SEE THE EVENT GOING TO
TAKE PLACE AND I'M GOING TO BE 

05:06:25.904 --> 05:06:29.317
WATCHING BECAUSE HISTORY IS 
GOING TO BE MADE. WE'RE GOING TO

05:06:29.552 --> 05:06:33.791
SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A 
GREAT AND COURAGEOUS LEADERS OR 

05:06:34.019 --> 05:06:36.178
WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE LEADERS 
THAT SHOULD BE ASHAMED 

05:06:40.856 --> 05:06:42.394
OF THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT 
HISTORY, THROUGHOUT ETERNITY, 

05:06:42.395 --> 05:06:45.944
THEY WILL BE ASHAMED AND YOU 
KNOW WHAT, IF THEY DO THE WRONG 

05:06:46.206 --> 05:06:50.283
THING, WE SHOULD NEVER EVER 
FORGET THAT THEY DID. WE SHOULD 

05:06:50.515 --> 05:06:52.515
NEVER 

05:06:53.643 --> 05:06:55.186
EVER FORGET. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF POINTS

05:06:55.187 --> 05:07:00.958
TO CONGRESS AND TELLS THOSE 
ASSEMBLED I'M GOING TO BE 

05:07:01.192 --> 05:07:03.192
WATCHING. HISTORY IS GOING TO 

05:07:05.223 --> 05:07:09.891
BE MADE. THIS WAS CLEARLY NOT 
JUST SOME RALLY OR MARCH OR 

05:07:10.127 --> 05:07:12.198
PROTEST. THIS WAS ABOUT DONALD 
TRUMP TRYING TO STEAL THE 

05:07:12.429 --> 05:07:14.429
ELECTION FOR HIMSELF CLAIMING 
THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

05:07:16.393 --> 05:07:18.393
FRAUDULENT, ILLEGITIMATE SO THAT
HIS SUPPORTERS WOULD FIGHT TO 

05:07:18.605 --> 05:07:21.943
TAKE IT BACK. IN FACT AFTER 
STOKING THE CROWDS ANGER FOR 

05:07:22.172 --> 05:07:27.575
NEARLY 40 MINUTES AFTER 
REPEATING FALSE ELECTION 

05:07:27.939 --> 05:07:31.759
CONSPIRACY AFTER FALSE ELECTION 
CONSPIRACY, HE SAID THIS IN NO 

05:07:35.292 --> 05:07:37.169
UNCERTAIN TERMS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WILL HAVE AN ILLEGITIMATE

05:07:37.170 --> 05:07:41.040
PRESENT. THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL 
HAVE. 

05:07:41.041 --> 05:07:43.041
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANY OUTCOME BESIDES HIM 
KEEPING THE PRESIDENCY WOULD 

05:07:46.458 --> 05:07:48.913
BE ILLEGITIMATE. THIS WAS 
BUILDING ON THE BIG LIE OF A 

05:07:49.142 --> 05:07:52.040
RIGGED AND STOLEN ELECTION. HERE
IS WHAT HE SAID A LITTLE LATER 

05:07:52.269 --> 05:07:54.269
IN 

05:07:56.208 --> 05:07:58.208
THE SPEECH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN YOU CATCH SOMEBODY AND A

05:07:58.289 --> 05:08:00.289
FRAUD, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GO BY 
VERY 

05:08:04.468 --> 05:08:08.481
DIFFERENT RULES. SO I HOPE MIKE 
HAS THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT HE 

05:08:08.851 --> 05:08:10.955
HAS TO DO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN YOU CATCH SOMEBODY IN A 

05:08:11.200 --> 05:08:13.958
FRAUD, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GO BY 
VERY DIFFERENT RULES. WE TOLD 

05:08:14.187 --> 05:08:16.833
YOU THAT CONTEXT MATTERS. HERE 
IS THE CONTEXT. THIS WAS NOT 

05:08:17.066 --> 05:08:19.066
JUST 

05:08:20.589 --> 05:08:23.050
ONE REFERENCE OR A MESSAGE TO 
SUPPORTERS BY A POLITICIAN TO 

05:08:23.282 --> 05:08:27.518
FIGHT FOR A CAUSE, HE DISSEMBLED
THOUSANDS OF VIOLENT PEOPLE, 

05:08:27.746 --> 05:08:32.839
PEOPLE HE KNEW WERE CAPABLE OF 
VIOLENCE, PEOPLE HE HAD SEEN IT 

05:08:33.989 --> 05:08:37.150
BE VIOLENT. THEY WERE STANDING 
NOW IN FRONT OF HIM, AND THEN HE

05:08:37.375 --> 05:08:44.068
POINTED TO US, LIT THE FUSE AND 
SENT AN ANGRY MOB TO FIGHT THE 

05:08:48.006 --> 05:08:50.642
PERCEIVED ENEMY, HIS OWN VICE 
PRESIDENTS AND THE MEMBERS OF 

05:08:50.871 --> 05:08:52.871
CONGRESS. AS WE CERTIFIED 

05:08:56.468 --> 05:08:58.468
AN ELECTION.

05:09:00.392 --> 05:09:02.717
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SAID SOMETHING IS WRONG 
HERE. SOMETHING IS REALLY WRONG.

05:09:02.966 --> 05:09:05.740
IT CANNOT HAVE HAPPENED AND WE 
FIGHTS. WE FIGHT LIKE AND IF YOU

05:09:05.974 --> 05:09:09.175
DON'T FIGHT LIKE ,  YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE.

05:09:10.554 --> 05:09:12.588
OUR EXCITING ADVENTURES AND 
BOLDEST ENDEAVORS HAVE NOT YET 

05:09:12.819 --> 05:09:15.076
BEGUN. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, FOR 

05:09:18.677 --> 05:09:21.369
OUR CHILDREN AND FOR OUR BELOVED
COUNTRY AND I SAY THIS DESPITE 

05:09:21.595 --> 05:09:24.705
ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED, THE BEST 
IS YET 

05:09:29.584 --> 05:09:36.437
TO COME. SO WE ARE GOING TO WALK
DOWN 

05:09:41.425 --> 05:09:44.080
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, AND WE ARE 
GOING TO THE CAPITAL AND WE ARE 

05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:46.310
GOING TO TRY 

05:09:48.124 --> 05:09:50.195
AND GIVE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
HOPELESS, THEY ARE NEVER VOTING 

05:09:50.428 --> 05:09:54.091
FOR ANYTHING, NOT EVEN ONE VOTE,
BUT WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GIVE 

05:09:55.038 --> 05:09:57.093
OUR REPUBLICANS, THE WEEK ONCE 
BECAUSE THE STRONG ONES DON'T 

05:09:57.322 --> 05:10:00.350
NEED ANY OF OUR HELP, WE ARE 
GOING TO TRY AND GIVE THEM THE 

05:10:00.580 --> 05:10:06.608
KIND OF PRIDE AND BOLDNESS THAT 
THEY NEED TO TAKE BACK OUR 

05:10:06.837 --> 05:10:09.087
COUNTRY. SO LET'S WALK DOWN 
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. I WANT TO 

05:10:09.325 --> 05:10:11.325
THANK 

05:10:12.906 --> 05:10:18.322
YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD 
BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL FOR

05:10:18.561 --> 05:10:21.280
BEING HERE. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

05:10:21.281 --> 05:10:23.281
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT FOR TRUMP, FIGHT 

05:10:28.083 --> 05:10:33.289
FOR TRUMP! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT FOR TRUMP. FIGHT 

05:10:36.126 --> 05:10:38.151
TRUMP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT FOR TRUMP. FIGHT 

05:10:43.118 --> 05:10:45.118
FOR TRUMP.

05:10:47.856 --> 05:10:51.075
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU DON'T FIGHT LIKE , YOU
ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY 

05:10:51.310 --> 05:10:54.454
ANYMORE.  THERE WAS ONLY ONE 
FIGHT LEFT AND IT WAS A MILE UP 

05:10:55.360 --> 05:10:57.495
THE ROAD. DONALD TRUMP, THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

05:10:57.723 --> 05:11:02.274
ORDERED THE CROWD TO MARCH ON 
CONGRESS AND SO THE CROWD 

05:11:02.503 --> 05:11:06.255
MARCHED. THIS IS INCREDIBLE YOU 
HEARD HIM SAY. THAT IS HOW 

05:11:06.486 --> 05:11:08.486
PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDED 

05:11:10.391 --> 05:11:12.920
HIS SPEECH. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE 
WITH A VERY BRIEF TIMELINE OF 

05:11:13.149 --> 05:11:16.642
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN PARALLEL 
ALONGSIDE THE PRESIDENT AS HE 

05:11:16.871 --> 05:11:18.871
SPOKE ON 

05:11:21.158 --> 05:11:23.489
6 JANUARY. A LITTLE AFTER NOON, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP BEGAN HIS SPEECH

05:11:23.720 --> 05:11:26.968
WITH A FIERY REFUSAL TO CONCEDE.
HE COMMANDED THE CROWD TO FIGHT 

05:11:27.197 --> 05:11:30.106
AND MARCH DOWN PENNSYLVANIA 
AVENUE AND AROUND 12:20, SOME 

05:11:30.344 --> 05:11:32.344
ATTENDEES 

05:11:35.316 --> 05:11:37.552
BEGAN MARCHING. BY 12:30 AS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUE TO 

05:11:37.785 --> 05:11:40.125
INCITE HIS SUPPORTERS, LARGE 
SEGMENTS OF THE RALLY CROWD HAD 

05:11:40.353 --> 05:11:42.353
AMASSED AT 

05:11:45.337 --> 05:11:47.773
THE CAPITAL. AT 12:53 AS THE 
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH WAS PLAYING 

05:11:48.003 --> 05:11:50.003
ON CELL PHONE BROADCASTS, THE 
OUTERMOST BARRICADE OF THE 

05:11:51.024 --> 05:11:53.024
NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE CAPITAL 

05:11:55.691 --> 05:11:59.123
WAS BREACHED. CAPITAL POLICE 
WERE FORCED BACK TO THE STEPS OF

05:12:03.953 --> 05:12:06.285
THE CAPITAL. AT 1:10, THE 
PRESIDENT ENDED HIS SPEECH WITH 

05:12:06.515 --> 05:12:10.109
A FINAL CALL TO FIGHT AND A 
FINAL ORDER TO MARCH TO THE 

05:12:10.342 --> 05:12:14.075
CAPITAL. AT 1:45, THE PRESIDENTS
FOLLOWERS SURGED PAST CAPITAL 

05:12:14.588 --> 05:12:20.549
POLICE SHOUTING THIS IS A 
REVOLUTION JUST AFTER 2:10, AN 

05:12:20.783 --> 05:12:26.159
HOUR AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDED
HIS SPEECH, THE INSURRECTIONIST 

05:12:26.386 --> 05:12:28.386
MOB OVERWHELMED 

05:12:29.622 --> 05:12:32.494
CAPITAL SECURITY AND MADE IT 
INSIDE THE HALLS OF CONGRESS. 

05:12:32.726 --> 05:12:37.973
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, THIS 
ATTACK NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED 

05:12:38.201 --> 05:12:40.201
BUT FOR 

05:12:42.812 --> 05:12:44.812
DONALD TRUMP. SO THEY CAME TRUMP

05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:51.255
AND TRUMP -- DRAPED IN TRUMPS 
FLAG AND USED TO THE AMERICAN 

05:12:51.487 --> 05:12:56.204
FLAG TO BATTER AND TO BLUDGEON 
AND 

05:12:59.274 --> 05:13:03.540
AT 2:30, I HEARD THAT TERRIFYING
BANGING ON THE HOUSE CHAMBER 

05:13:03.771 --> 05:13:07.658
DOORS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
MORE THAN 200 YEARS, THE SEAT OF

05:13:08.006 --> 05:13:11.511
OUR GOVERNMENT WAS RANSACKED ON 

05:13:16.468 --> 05:13:18.468
OUR WATCH.

05:13:27.908 --> 05:13:30.446
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK THIS 
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR 

05:13:33.592 --> 05:13:35.592
A BREAK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASKED FOR A RECESS UNTIL 

05:13:40.233 --> 05:13:42.233
4 PM.

05:13:57.774 --> 05:13:59.858
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF 
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ON

05:14:00.090 --> 05:14:02.172
A BREAK NOW UNTIL FOR O'CLOCK. 
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

05:14:02.408 --> 05:14:04.408
PRESENTING THE CASE FOR THE 
PRESIDENTS IMPEACHMENT. LET'S GO

05:14:04.477 --> 05:14:09.344
NOW TO MY GUESTS RHONDA, CAPITOL
HILL REPORTER AND JAMES CALL HIM

05:14:09.731 --> 05:14:11.815
-- COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON 
POST. AS CONGRESSMAN DEAN WAS 

05:14:12.042 --> 05:14:16.474
DESCRIBING WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED 
WHAT SHE REALLY TEARED UP AT THE

05:14:16.707 --> 05:14:20.326
BEGINNING OF HER SPEECH AND SHE 
TEARED UP AT THE END OF HER 

05:14:20.559 --> 05:14:23.464
PRESENTATION. BOTH TIMES 
CONNECTING THE PERSONAL 

05:14:23.700 --> 05:14:27.365
EXPERIENCE OF MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS BUT ALSO GIVING THAT 

05:14:27.600 --> 05:14:29.600
REALLY VISCERAL 

05:14:31.690 --> 05:14:33.690
IMAGE OF THESE ATTACKERS 
CARRYING THE FLAG OF DONALD 

05:14:33.890 --> 05:14:36.193
TRUMP AS THEY USED TO THE 
AMERICAN FLAG TO BATTER AND 

05:14:36.422 --> 05:14:38.422
BRUTALIZE POLICE 

05:14:42.187 --> 05:14:44.427
OFFICERS, RHONDA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. THAT LINE ABOUT THE FLAG

05:14:44.653 --> 05:14:47.552
WAS REALLY STARTLING AND YOU ARE
SEEING THE EMOTION OF THESE 

05:14:48.755 --> 05:14:50.843
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND THAT IS
JUST MIND BLOWING RELATED THINK 

05:14:51.076 --> 05:14:53.982
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN HAVE 
YOU EVER SEEN A CASE WHERE THE 

05:14:54.217 --> 05:14:58.253
PROSECUTION AS WELL IS THE 
JURORS WERE VICTIMS OF THE CRIME

05:14:58.491 --> 05:15:03.493
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO ARGUE 
ABOUT. WE ARE REALLY SEEING A 

05:15:03.722 --> 05:15:06.483
LOT OF THE PERSONAL RECOUNTING 
AND RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT DAY. I

05:15:06.715 --> 05:15:09.286
THINK THAT IS PROBABLY A PART OF
THE STRATEGY OF THE IMPEACHMENT 

05:15:09.521 --> 05:15:11.695
MANAGERS TO INJECT THEIR 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF 

05:15:15.775 --> 05:15:18.475
JANUARY 6 AND BRING THAT TO MY 
TO THE SENATORS BECAUSE THEY 

05:15:18.731 --> 05:15:20.833
ALSO HAVE VERY SIMILAR 
REMEMBRANCES OF THAT DAY. SO TO 

05:15:21.064 --> 05:15:23.896
GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF 
CONTEXT, I TALKED TO A MEMBER OF

05:15:24.139 --> 05:15:28.091
CONGRESS WHO REALLY VIVIDLY 
DISCUSSED HOW SHE HAD TO LIE ON 

05:15:28.322 --> 05:15:30.884
THE FLOOR AND SHE DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW DISTRESSED SHE WAS UNTIL SHE

05:15:31.117 --> 05:15:33.426
SAW A VIRAL PHOTO THAT WENT 
AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA THAT NIGHT 

05:15:33.656 --> 05:15:36.199
AND THE NEXT DAY SHOWING HOW 
SCARED SHE WAS AND SHE WAS 

05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:38.430
HOLDING THE HAND OF 

05:15:41.371 --> 05:15:44.280
JASON CROW WHO WAS A COMBAT 
VETERAN AND HE HAS EVEN SAID HE 

05:15:44.507 --> 05:15:47.495
THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO 
USE THOSE SKILLS TO FIGHT HIS 

05:15:47.741 --> 05:15:50.302
WAY OUT. THERE WERE HOURS OF AND
CERTAINTY THAT ALL OF THESE 

05:15:50.531 --> 05:15:53.983
MEMBERS EXPERIENCED IN THE HOUSE
MANAGERS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

05:15:54.216 --> 05:15:56.582
THE JURY, THE SENATORS AS WELL 
AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T 

05:15:56.816 --> 05:16:00.192
FORGET HOW DEVASTATING THAT IS. 
I DON'T THINK THE TEARING UP OR 

05:16:00.434 --> 05:16:03.958
ANY OF THE CRIES YOU ARE SEEING 
FROM THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS IS

05:16:04.204 --> 05:16:06.508
NOT GENUINE. I THINK THEY ARE 
ALL STILL GRAPPLING WITH THE 

05:16:06.741 --> 05:16:12.263
TRAUMA OF THE DAY. IF YOU ARE 
APPEAR ON THE HILL, JANUARY 6 IS

05:16:12.488 --> 05:16:17.117
VERY SO MUCH GOING ON. IT IS 
HARD TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE 

05:16:17.349 --> 05:16:19.457
CAPITAL. THERE ARE GATES THAT 
SURROUNDS ALL OF THE BLOCKS 

05:16:19.687 --> 05:16:23.447
AROUND THE OFFICE BUILDINGS AS 
WELL AS THE CAPITAL ITSELF. 

05:16:23.679 --> 05:16:26.303
THERE ARE CHECKPOINTS ALL OVER 
THE PLACE. YOU HAVE TO GO 

05:16:26.529 --> 05:16:29.360
THROUGH A LINE OF GUARDS TO 
CHECK YOUR BADGE TO SEE IF YOU 

05:16:29.591 --> 05:16:31.832
ARE CREDENTIALED TO EVEN ENTER 
THE BUILDING. SECURITY IS REALLY

05:16:32.072 --> 05:16:34.416
HIGH RIGHT NOW AND EVEN SOME OF 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE 

05:16:34.644 --> 05:16:36.644
CAPITAL IS STILL 

05:16:38.648 --> 05:16:40.869
BEING REPAIRED BECAUSE OF THE 
VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED ON THE 

05:16:41.102 --> 05:16:43.415
SIXTH. THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DO NOT 

05:16:43.645 --> 05:16:45.645
FORGET THAT AND THEY ARE 
THEMSELVES HUMAN AND STILL 

05:16:45.761 --> 05:16:49.613
WORKING THROUGH IT ALSO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, ONE OF THE ELEMENTS 

05:16:49.844 --> 05:16:52.306
THAT THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
ARE TRYING TO DRAW RIGHT NOW IS 

05:16:52.537 --> 05:16:57.746
CAUSE AND EFFECT. IT IS ONE 
THING TO SAY PRESIDENT 

05:17:01.396 --> 05:17:03.863
TRUMPS COMMENTS DIRECTLY INCITED
THOSE PEOPLE TO GO UP TO THE 

05:17:04.094 --> 05:17:06.094
CAPITAL AND BREAK INTO IT AND 
ATTACK 

05:17:10.275 --> 05:17:13.414
POLICE OFFICERS. BUT IT IS SORT 
OF AN EASIER WAY TO IMAGINE IT 

05:17:13.641 --> 05:17:15.641
AND SAY IT TO PHRASE IT IN 

05:17:19.205 --> 05:17:21.205
TERMS OF

05:17:23.533 --> 05:17:25.878
IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT DONE 
THESE THINGS AND SAID THESE 

05:17:26.109 --> 05:17:28.428
THINGS, THERE NEVER WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AN ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL. 

05:17:28.658 --> 05:17:30.993
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PEOPLE NEVER WOULD'VE COME TO
WASHINGTON IF HE HADN'T SPENT 

05:17:31.230 --> 05:17:33.957
THE 19 DAYS LEADING UP TO 
JANUARY 6 URGING THEM TO COME 

05:17:34.187 --> 05:17:36.768
AND SAYING IT WOULD BE WILD AND 
THERE WAS SOME VALUE AND 

05:17:36.995 --> 05:17:38.904
REPETITION. THE CONGRESSWOMAN 
FROM PENNSYLVANIA NOTABLY IS THE

05:17:38.905 --> 05:17:40.758
CONGRESSWOMAN WHO REPRESENTS 
BRUCE CASTOR, THE TRUMP ATTORNEY

05:17:40.759 --> 05:17:43.344
WHO SPOKE FIRST YESTERDAY AND 
SHE NOTED AT THE TOP OF HER 

05:17:43.577 --> 05:17:46.281
REMARKS WHICH WERE VERY POWERFUL
THAT SHE IS AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR

05:17:46.509 --> 05:17:48.509
BY BACKGROUND AND REALLY DID 
HIGHLIGHT THE POWER 

05:17:51.766 --> 05:17:54.256
OF WORDS. I THOUGHT SOME OF THE 
MOST DAMNING EVIDENCE AGAINST 

05:17:54.503 --> 05:17:59.082
TRUMP WERE HIS OWN WORDS. IT WAS
INTERESTING THE USE OF 

05:17:59.310 --> 05:18:00.930
REPETITION. OBVIOUSLY PASSED 
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS HAVEN'T HAD 

05:18:00.931 --> 05:18:04.908
AUDIO VISUALS EVEN LIKE THIS. WE
HEARD SOME TAPE FROM THE 

05:18:05.139 --> 05:18:07.584
WASHINGTON POST OBTAINED AUDIO 
OF TRUMP'S CALL TO GEORGIA 

05:18:07.822 --> 05:18:09.822
SECRETARY 

05:18:11.070 --> 05:18:13.070
OF STATE. THE AUDIOVISUAL 
PRESENTATION FROM THAT STOP THE 

05:18:13.503 --> 05:18:16.676
STEEL RALLY, FIRST WE HEARD WHAT
YOU WOULD SEE 

05:18:21.220 --> 05:18:23.306
ON CAMERA, WATCHING TELEVISION 
WHICH WAS JUST TRUMPS SPEECH AND

05:18:23.533 --> 05:18:26.496
THEN CONGRESSWOMAN DEAN WENT TO 
SHOW FOOTAGE FROM THE CROWD, 

05:18:26.729 --> 05:18:28.822
WATCHING HOW THEY REACTED TO 
WHAT TRUMP WAS SAYING. WHEN 

05:18:29.054 --> 05:18:33.526
TRUMP SAYS WE HAVE GOT TO GO 
FIGHT LIKE IF WE WILL STILL HAVE

05:18:33.755 --> 05:18:38.085
A COUNTRY,  YOU LITERALLY HEARD 
FROM THE CROWD FOOTAGE PEOPLE 

05:18:38.314 --> 05:18:40.391
WERE RESPONDING TO THOSE REMARKS
WHICH WE HEARD A COUPLE 

05:18:40.623 --> 05:18:43.338
DIFFERENT TIMES PLAYED DURING 
THAT PRESENTATION THINK STORMED 

05:18:43.574 --> 05:18:46.236
THE CAPITAL RIGHT NOW, TAKE THE 
CAPITAL, FIGHT, 

05:18:49.256 --> 05:18:51.891
FIGHT, FIGHT. THAT AS EVIDENCE 
GOES IS A REMARKABLE LINKAGE 

05:18:52.125 --> 05:18:54.795
BETWEEN THE WORDS OF THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE INCITEMENT OF 

05:18:55.026 --> 05:18:59.034
THE RIDERS AND THE INSURRECTION.
THAT PRESENTATION 

05:19:02.456 --> 05:19:06.263
I THOUGHT THAT A VERY EFFECTIVE 
JOB AT LAYING OUT HOW WE GOT UP 

05:19:06.499 --> 05:19:08.499
TO 

05:19:10.174 --> 05:19:12.729
JANUARY 6 AND WHAT HAPPENED THAT
DAY. ALSO SHE POINTED OUT TRUMP 

05:19:13.091 --> 05:19:17.959
PRAISING RUDY GIULIANI FOR THE 
COMMENTS HE HAD JUST MADE AND 

05:19:18.186 --> 05:19:20.270
SORTED THE HISTORY OF TRUMP 
CONDONING VIOLENT ACTIONS BY HIS

05:19:20.498 --> 05:19:23.580
SUPPORTERS. SHE NOTED IN THE 
CROWD THAT DAY ON JANUARY 6, THE

05:19:28.395 --> 05:19:31.313
SAME PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN INTO A 
CARAVAN AND SURROUNDED A BIDEN 

05:19:31.543 --> 05:19:34.260
CAMPAIGN BUS IN TEXAS WHICH 
TRUMP HAD CHEERED ON. IT IS THE 

05:19:34.494 --> 05:19:38.267
PATTERN OF CONDUCT THAT WHEN YOU
PUT ALL OF THIS TOGETHER, EVEN 

05:19:38.498 --> 05:19:40.498
THOUGH WE ALL LIVED 

05:19:42.283 --> 05:19:44.283
THROUGH IT, PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WATCHING AND PAYING CLOSE 

05:19:44.500 --> 05:19:47.059
ATTENTION TO THE NEWS BUT WHEN 
YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, THAT 

05:19:47.287 --> 05:19:49.590
THROUGH LINE REALLY DOES CREATE 
A PRETTY STRONG HEAVY CASE THAT 

05:19:49.819 --> 05:19:51.092
TRUMP DID INCITE THE 
INSURRECTION. 

05:19:51.093 --> 05:19:54.118
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT 
INCIDENT THAT JAMES 

05:19:58.132 --> 05:20:00.254
JUST HIGHLIGHTED, THAT AMBUSH OF
THE BIDEN HARRIS CAMPAIGN BUS 

05:20:04.976 --> 05:20:07.666
IN TEXAS. AT THE TIME, IT DREW 
WIDESPREAD CONDEMNATION AT THAT 

05:20:07.895 --> 05:20:09.895
COULD HAPPEN BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP
CHANGED THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION 

05:20:10.032 --> 05:20:12.602
BY TWEETING OUT AS WE SAW REALLY
A PRAISEWORTHY ENTHUSIASTIC GO 

05:20:12.832 --> 05:20:14.832
GET HIM SORT 

05:20:18.172 --> 05:20:19.939
OF VIDEO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. PRAISEWORTHY, SAYING 

05:20:19.940 --> 05:20:24.165
THAT HE LOVED TEXAS, THAT IS 
WHERE THAT SCENE HAPPENED AND 

05:20:24.394 --> 05:20:28.790
EVEN THERE WAS MUSIC UNDERNEATH 
IT. IT JUST SHOWS THAT IT IS 

05:20:29.035 --> 05:20:31.035
GOING TO BE HARD FOR 

05:20:34.422 --> 05:20:36.739
HIS TEAM TO REFUTE THAT BECAUSE 
THERE IS DOCUMENTATION. HE 

05:20:36.971 --> 05:20:39.454
TWEETED THESE VIDEOS, HE ADDED 
HIS OWN COMMENTARY TO THE VIDEOS

05:20:39.684 --> 05:20:41.814
SO THAT IS SOMETHING I AM 
PROBABLY GOING TO BE 

05:20:45.048 --> 05:20:47.887
LOOKING FOR WHEN WE GET TO HIS 
TEAMS ARGUMENTS IS HOW ARE THEY 

05:20:48.119 --> 05:20:51.045
GOING TO REFUTE ANY OF THAT OR 
HOW ARE THEY EVEN GOING TO 

05:20:51.277 --> 05:20:54.033
ADDRESS IT. THIS IS ONE OF THE 
SHARPEST TOOLS IN THE KIT FOR 

05:20:54.260 --> 05:20:56.333
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AS THEY
HAVE ALL SORTS OF DOCUMENTATION.

05:20:56.565 --> 05:20:59.163
THEY HAVE DAILY TWEETS LEADING 
UP TO THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6 

05:20:59.531 --> 05:21:01.860
AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT 
NOW IS TRY TO DRAW 

05:21:04.897 --> 05:21:08.020
THAT LINE BETWEEN THAT ACTIVITY,
THAT CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR AND 

05:21:08.256 --> 05:21:11.193
HOW IT LED TO JANUARY 6 AS A 
COMBINATION, NOT AS A SINGULAR 

05:21:11.420 --> 05:21:13.270
EVENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FBI WAS LOOKING INTO THAT

05:21:13.271 --> 05:21:15.602
AND NOT ONLY DID PRESIDENT TRUMP
EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR IT AND 

05:21:15.834 --> 05:21:18.623
CALL THEM PATRIOTS, MARCO RUBIO 
DID AS WELL SO WE CIRCLE BACK TO

05:21:18.857 --> 05:21:20.857
THE 

05:21:23.174 --> 05:21:26.137
ROLE OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO ARE 

05:21:26.368 --> 05:21:28.007
EVEN PRESENT AND PART OF THIS 
TRIAL. 

05:21:28.008 --> 05:21:30.101
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TRUMP CRITICIZED FBI DIRECTOR
CHRIS WHOM HE APPOINTED FOR 

05:21:30.328 --> 05:21:32.328
INVESTIGATING 

05:21:33.598 --> 05:21:35.598
THE INCIDENT. REALLY AGAIN WHEN 
YOU PUT ALL 

05:21:39.083 --> 05:21:41.221
THIS TOGETHER, IT IS A REMINDER 
THAT THESE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

05:21:41.453 --> 05:21:44.187
WE TALKED DURING THE LAST BREAK 
ABOUT WHO THE AUDIENCE IS HERE. 

05:21:44.423 --> 05:21:47.274
I THINK THE AUDIENCE AS MUCH AS 
ANYONE IS HISTORY. HISTORY IS 

05:21:47.505 --> 05:21:49.505
VERY UNLIKELY TO BE KIND TO 

05:21:52.484 --> 05:21:54.723
THIS PRESIDENT WHEN IN THIS CASE
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 

05:21:54.953 --> 05:21:56.953
LAYING OUT REALLY IS 

05:21:59.601 --> 05:22:02.150
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE 
VERY HARD FOR TRUMP LOYALISTS TO

05:22:02.382 --> 05:22:04.382
REHABILITATE HIS IMAGE WHEN YOU 
PUT ALL OF THIS 

05:22:08.874 --> 05:22:10.874
OUT THERE.

05:22:12.597 --> 05:22:15.071
OBVIOUSLY THE BURDEN IS HIGH IN 
TERMS OF TRYING TO CONVINCE 

05:22:15.303 --> 05:22:17.416
REPUBLICANS TO DEFECT BUT RIGHT 
NOW, THERE ARE SIX REPUBLICANS 

05:22:17.651 --> 05:22:19.961
WHO HAVE SIGNALED OPENNESS TO IT
PERHAPS OTHERS. THIS COULD STILL

05:22:20.189 --> 05:22:22.189
BE THE MOST BIPARTISAN 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL VOTES IN 

05:22:22.345 --> 05:22:23.762
AMERICAN HISTORY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IMPEACHMENT MANAGER AND 

05:22:23.763 --> 05:22:25.763
DELEGATE TO THE US HOUSE 

05:22:29.389 --> 05:22:31.389
OF REPRESENTATIVES

05:22:33.724 --> 05:22:35.740
STACY PLASKETT USE GRAPHICS TO 
PUNCTUATE THE PLANNING INVOLVED 

05:22:35.970 --> 05:22:39.053
IN THE MOB ATTACK. LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A POST 

05:22:39.282 --> 05:22:41.609
THAT WAS CAPTURED FROM ONE OF 
THE SITES DEDICATED TO DONALD 

05:22:41.835 --> 05:22:44.155
TRUMP THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT.
SHORTLY BEFORE THE SITE WAS 

05:22:44.387 --> 05:22:46.906
TAKEN DOWN. THE MEME READS QUOTE
THEY CAPITAL IS OUR GOAL. 

05:22:48.141 --> 05:22:50.141
EVERYTHING ELSE IS 

05:22:52.007 --> 05:22:55.861
A DISTRACTION. EVERY CORRUPT 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS LOCKED IN ONE

05:22:56.233 --> 05:23:02.016
ROOM AND SURROUNDED BY REAL 
AMERICANS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT

05:23:02.285 --> 05:23:09.073
WILL NEVER PRESENT ITSELF AGAIN.
LET THAT SINK IN. THINK ABOUT 

05:23:09.307 --> 05:23:15.265
THAT. THE EXACT THING THAT 
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6, THAT WAS 

05:23:16.385 --> 05:23:22.471
THEIR GOAL. THEY SAID IT OUT 
LOUD ON SITES THAT THE TRUMP 

05:23:22.706 --> 05:23:24.706
ADMINISTRATION WAS 

05:23:27.353 --> 05:23:29.418
ACTIVELY MONITORING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, LET'S GO TO YOU FOR 

05:23:29.664 --> 05:23:35.271
MORE ON THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS
BUILDING OF THESE EXAMPLES AND 

05:23:35.505 --> 05:23:37.505
CASES OF 

05:23:39.124 --> 05:23:41.383
REALLY THREATS MADE TO MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS AND VICE PRESIDENT 

05:23:41.617 --> 05:23:44.721
MIKE PENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS RIGHT. THERE TRYING 

05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:48.148
TO SHOW THEIR COLLEAGUES THERE 
IN THE SENATE THAT THE 

05:23:48.380 --> 05:23:50.421
INSURRECTION US UNDER THE 
DIRECTION OF DONALD TRUMP WERE 

05:23:50.667 --> 05:23:56.190
COMING FOR THEM. THE WORDS THAT 
STACY JUST READ, THEY WERE 

05:23:56.424 --> 05:23:58.424
CHILLING TO PROBABLY 

05:24:01.815 --> 05:24:04.072
ALL AMERICANS BECAUSE THESE 
PLANNERS WERE NOTING THE FACT 

05:24:04.312 --> 05:24:07.225
THAT ALL 435 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
WOULD BE HERE AT ONE TIME AND 

05:24:07.459 --> 05:24:12.420
THAT THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY. 
THEY WERE LOOKING AT IT AS YES A

05:24:12.666 --> 05:24:14.772
LAST STAND TO INTERRUPT THE 
CERTIFICATION PROCESS OF JOE 

05:24:16.503 --> 05:24:18.828
BIDEN'S WENT BUT THEY WERE ALSO 
LOOKING AT IT FROM THE 

05:24:19.059 --> 05:24:21.660
PERSPECTIVE OF YOU DON'T USUALLY
SEE ALL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN 

05:24:21.889 --> 05:24:25.072
ONE PLACE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD
OF TIME AND ON THE JANUARY 6 THE

05:24:25.446 --> 05:24:28.004
CERTIFICATION PROCEDURE, A PART 
OF THAT WAS THEY ALL HAD TO BE 

05:24:28.237 --> 05:24:32.645
HERE FOR THAT. EVERY MEMBER HAD 
TO BE HERE FOR IT. THE HOUSE HAS

05:24:33.017 --> 05:24:36.228
A ROLE WHERE THEY CAN VOTE BY 
PROXY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC 

05:24:36.459 --> 05:24:39.237
BUT ALL OF THEM WERE HERE TO BE 
A PART OF THAT CERTIFICATION 

05:24:39.476 --> 05:24:41.476
PROCESS. IT WAS WELL KNOWN 

05:24:45.078 --> 05:24:49.065
AND REPORTED BEFORE JANUARY 6 
THAT IT WOULD BE A LONG DAY SO 

05:24:49.298 --> 05:24:51.602
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ORGANIZERS OF 
THE INSURRECTION KNEW THAT AND 

05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:54.111
KNEW THAT THESE MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS WOULD ALL BE HERE AT 

05:24:54.353 --> 05:24:57.815
THE SAME TIME. SO WHAT STACY IS 
TRYING TO DO IS TO APPEAL TO HER

05:24:58.045 --> 05:24:59.916
COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE 
ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLICANS AND 

05:24:59.917 --> 05:25:03.539
TELLING THEM THAT THESE PEOPLE 
WERE COMING FOR US, ALL OF US 

05:25:03.768 --> 05:25:07.916
AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VERY IMPORTANT POINTS AS THEY

05:25:08.153 --> 05:25:12.396
TRY TO WIN OVER THIS JURY. JAMES
AS YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT HISTORY

05:25:12.665 --> 05:25:15.099
BEING AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT HERE,
ALSO THE 

05:25:18.259 --> 05:25:20.724
AMERICAN PUBLIC. A LOT OF THESE 
MEMBERS CAN PROBABLY RELATE TO 

05:25:25.279 --> 05:25:27.279
CONGRESSWOMAN DEANS

05:25:30.445 --> 05:25:31.884
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND 
RECOUNTING. THEY DON'T 

05:25:31.885 --> 05:25:34.217
NECESSARILY NEED TO HEAR BECAUSE
MANY OF THEM LIVED AT BUT 

05:25:34.451 --> 05:25:37.044
PERHAPS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED
TO HEAR IT TO BE REMINDED OF 

05:25:37.278 --> 05:25:39.278
JUST HOW TERRIFYING THIS 
EXPERIENCE WAS TO MANY AMERICANS

05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:41.044
WHO WERE TRAPPED IN THAT 
BUILDING. 

05:25:41.045 --> 05:25:43.725
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. WE TALK ABOUT THE
FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, IT WAS 

05:25:43.963 --> 05:25:46.513
SOMETHING THAT WAS HAPPENING ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD IN 

05:25:46.758 --> 05:25:50.209
UKRAINE ABOUT WEAPONS TRANSFERS 
AND MONEY BEING HELD UP AND 

05:25:50.441 --> 05:25:54.233
ASKING FOR A FAVOR AND A 
PRINTOUT OF A TRANSCRIPT. 

05:25:54.465 --> 05:25:57.089
OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE 
ROOM, THIS WAS INCREDIBLY 

05:25:57.325 --> 05:26:01.741
VISCERAL. THEY FEARED FOR THEIR 
LIVES MANY OF THEM. OBVIOUSLY WE

05:26:01.971 --> 05:26:05.473
CAN RELATE TO IT AND WE ARE HERE
IN WASHINGTON. RHONDA AND MANY 

05:26:05.704 --> 05:26:08.486
OF OUR COLLEAGUES WERE IN THAT 
BUILDING ON THAT THEY. WE KNOW A

05:26:08.716 --> 05:26:11.438
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THAT 
BUILDING. FOR A LOT OF 

05:26:15.874 --> 05:26:19.026
EVERYDAY AMERICANS, IT IS 
STRIKING TO SEE ALL OF THIS PUT 

05:26:19.258 --> 05:26:21.072
TOGETHER BECAUSE HEARING THESE 
STORIES, THESE TESTIMONIALS 

05:26:21.073 --> 05:26:23.073
REALLY CAPTURES JUST THE 
VISCERAL NESTS 

05:26:26.296 --> 05:26:28.648
OF IT. THAT IS ONE OF THE 
REASONS THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

05:26:28.879 --> 05:26:31.356
PRIVATELY REALLY WANT TO CALL 
WITNESSES AT THE END OF THE 

05:26:31.586 --> 05:26:34.312
WEEK, THEY WANT TO VOTE SO THERE
CAN BE WITNESSES. THERE IS 

05:26:34.543 --> 05:26:36.543
OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS WHO ARE 
EAGER TO 

05:26:40.111 --> 05:26:43.057
MOVE ON, NOT DWELL ON THIS AND 
THERE ARE DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO 

05:26:43.286 --> 05:26:45.730
ADVANCE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 
AGENDA. I THINK YOU WOULD HEAR 

05:26:45.960 --> 05:26:47.960
MORE OF THESE TESTIMONIALS AND 
PERHAPS THERE IS DIMINISHING 

05:26:48.104 --> 05:26:52.886
RETURNS, PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING
HER HEARING THESE INCREDIBLY 

05:26:53.122 --> 05:26:55.122
EMOTIONALLY 

05:26:56.161 --> 05:26:58.815
POWERFUL STORIES AND BUT THERE 
ARE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO

05:26:59.050 --> 05:27:03.478
ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT WHO ALSO 
HAVE STORIES OF HAVING THE N 

05:27:03.712 --> 05:27:05.811
WORD YELLED AT THEM AS JIMMY 
RECOUNTED EARLIER TODAY OF 

05:27:06.715 --> 05:27:12.465
HAVING FLAGPOLES JAMMED TOWARD 
THEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 

05:27:12.699 --> 05:27:14.699
REALLY TRAUMATIZING STORIES 
ABOUT 

05:27:18.296 --> 05:27:20.405
JANUARY 6. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO THAT AND JAMES OF SORT OF 

05:27:20.636 --> 05:27:25.294
GIVING ALL OF US A REMINDER OF 
WHAT IT WAS LIKE ON JANUARY 6 

05:27:25.525 --> 05:27:27.841
AND WHAT IT IS STILL LIKE TODAY,
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER TED 

05:27:28.246 --> 05:27:30.246
ARGUE THAT DONALD TRUMP TURNED 

05:27:32.727 --> 05:27:34.727
AGAINST EVERYONE WHO ACCEPTED 
THE REALITY AND ACCEPTED 

05:27:39.155 --> 05:27:41.649
THE FACT THAT HE LOST THE 
ELECTION. LET'S LISTEN. 

05:27:41.650 --> 05:27:44.180
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW DID OUR EXCEPTIONAL 
COUNTRY GET TO THE POINT WHERE A

05:27:44.410 --> 05:27:46.410
VIOLENT MOB ATTACKED OUR CAPITAL
MURDERING A 

05:27:48.976 --> 05:27:53.383
POLICE OFFICER, ASSAULTING OVER 
140 OTHER OFFICERS, HOW DO WE 

05:27:53.617 --> 05:27:56.962
GET TO A POINT WHERE RIDERS 
DESECRATED, DEFILED AND 

05:27:57.192 --> 05:27:59.192
DISHONORED YOUR 

05:28:00.746 --> 05:28:05.011
SENATE CHAMBER? THE VERY PLACE 
IN WHICH YOU SIT BECAME A CRIME 

05:28:05.244 --> 05:28:07.244
SCENE AND WHERE NATIONAL GUARD 
TROOPS STILL PATROL OUTSIDE 

05:28:07.447 --> 05:28:12.587
WEARING BODY ARMOR. I WILL SHOW 
YOU HOW WE GOT HERE. PRESIDENT 

05:28:12.814 --> 05:28:14.814
DONALD 

05:28:16.795 --> 05:28:20.921
J TRUMP RAN OUT OF NONVIOLENT 
OPTIONS TO MAINTAIN POWER. 

05:28:20.922 --> 05:28:22.922
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO 

05:28:25.729 --> 05:28:28.465
RHONDA. WHAT IS IT LIKE UP 
THERE? YOU ARE IN THE CAPITAL 

05:28:28.703 --> 05:28:32.701
COMPLEX UP THERE. WHAT IS IT 
LIKE A MONTH PLUS AFTER 

05:28:36.295 --> 05:28:38.321
THE RIGHT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN SOME WAYS, IT FEELS LIKE 

05:28:38.556 --> 05:28:42.244
IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY. THERE ARE
STILL SO MANY PHYSICAL REMINDERS

05:28:42.490 --> 05:28:46.726
OF WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS IN A 
ROOM BELOW THE AREA I AM ON 

05:28:46.954 --> 05:28:49.637
RIGHT NOW. I'M ON THE SENATE 
SIDE OF THE CAPITAL AND THERE 

05:28:49.869 --> 05:28:51.869
WERE KIND OF RESTRUCTURING OF 

05:28:54.573 --> 05:28:59.209
A WINDOW, A TAPED UP WINDOW AND 
PAINTING TO SHOW THAT PERHAPS 

05:28:59.442 --> 05:29:02.451
THIS IS STILL BEING LOOKED AT AS
A CRIME SCENE BY THOSE WHO WORK 

05:29:02.680 --> 05:29:04.680
HERE AT 

05:29:07.314 --> 05:29:11.961
THE CAPITAL, THAT THEY HAVE TO 
FIX A LOT OF THE WINDOWS, FIX 

05:29:12.197 --> 05:29:14.739
SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
IT IS STILL A VERY ACTIVE CRIME 

05:29:14.973 --> 05:29:18.084
SCENE I WOULD SAY. RIGHT NOW, IT
IS MORE QUIET THAN IT WAS THE 

05:29:18.316 --> 05:29:21.957
LAST IMPEACHMENT. I REMEMBER THE
ENERGY AND HERE AND WHERE I AM 

05:29:22.195 --> 05:29:24.976
AT, A LOT OF MEDIA RUNNING IN 
THE HALLWAY. WE WERE ALLOWED TO 

05:29:25.217 --> 05:29:27.999
GO TO PLACES WE WERE NO LONGER 
ALLOWED TO GO TO BECAUSE OF 

05:29:32.697 --> 05:29:37.356
THE SECURITY, AND IT JUST KEEPS 
BRINGING HOME THAT JANUARY 6 

05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:39.937
EVENT. THE NATIONAL GUARD IS 
STILL VERY MUCH HERE. THE NUMBER

05:29:40.165 --> 05:29:42.932
HAS BEEN REDUCED BUT THEY STILL 
HAVE A PRESENCE AT ALL OF THE 

05:29:43.295 --> 05:29:45.295
ENTRANCE POINTS OF 

05:29:47.327 --> 05:29:50.936
THE CAPITAL AND IT IS NOT JUST 
THE CAPITOL BUILDING ITSELF THAT

05:29:51.177 --> 05:29:53.623
HAS A PERIMETER AROUND IT. THE 
ENTIRE CAMPUS WHERE YOU HAVE 

05:29:53.869 --> 05:29:56.184
SOME OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE 
OFFICE BUILDINGS, THOSE ARE ALSO

05:29:56.426 --> 05:29:59.464
GATED OFF BY HIGH FENCING WITH 
BARBED WIRE. IT IS A MUST AS IF 

05:29:59.695 --> 05:30:03.109
YOU HAVE EVER DRIVEN BY A 
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON, THAT IS

05:30:03.349 --> 05:30:06.276
SORT OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND 
IT EXTENDS A FEW BLOCKS OUTSIDE 

05:30:06.508 --> 05:30:09.060
OF THE CAPITAL AND THE OFFICE 
BUILDINGS. IT IS VERY MUCH IS 

05:30:09.289 --> 05:30:11.289
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE ALL OF 
THESE REPRESENTATIVES AND 

05:30:11.376 --> 05:30:13.376
SENATORS HAVE TO REMEMBER EVERY 
TIME THEY COME IN 

05:30:17.388 --> 05:30:19.388
THIS BUILDING.

05:31:04.377 --> 05:31:06.377
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:31:10.654 --> 05:31:12.761
ALL THE OTHER PREDICATES AND 
CALLS TO CONGRESS FROM THE 

05:31:12.996 --> 05:31:15.474
SECRETARY OF STATE BUT A FEW 
HOURS OF THE DEMOCRATIC DINNER 

05:31:15.712 --> 05:31:17.712
BREAK, WE MAY SEE SOME NEVER 
BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGE.

05:31:29.583 --> 05:31:32.479
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ABOUT 
THE POWER OF THAT FOOTAGE AND 

05:31:32.717 --> 05:31:34.846
WHAT IT IS TRYING TO DO IN THIS 
MOMENT? 

05:31:34.847 --> 05:31:37.641
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT GETS 

05:31:37.884 --> 05:31:40.921
WORSE THE MORE WE HAVE SEEN. 
SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM 

05:31:41.151 --> 05:31:46.098
THE DAY IN THE CAPITAL AND WE 
HAVE OF GREAT VISUAL FORENSICS 

05:31:46.333 --> 05:31:48.267
TEAM THAT HAS BEEN 
RECONSTRUCTING THIS AND PUTTING 

05:31:48.268 --> 05:31:50.317
IT TOGETHER. IT IS CAMERA 
FOOTAGE FROM REPORTERS WHO 

05:31:50.550 --> 05:31:53.581
HAPPEN TO BE STANDING IN SOME 
SPOT AS THE MOB WENT BY OR SOME 

05:31:53.825 --> 05:31:55.825
PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO CAPTURED SOME 
IMAGES BUT THE CAPITAL CAPITOL 

05:31:55.963 --> 05:31:58.352
IS ONE OF THOSE FORTIFIED 
COMPLEXES IN THE WORLD IN TERMS 

05:31:58.586 --> 05:32:01.099
OF HOW MANY SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
AROUND. THEY ARE GOING TO SEE 

05:32:01.333 --> 05:32:05.679
ANGLES AND SCENES THAT WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE AND THAT 

05:32:06.407 --> 05:32:12.468
WILL BE HOW DANGEROUS THIS MOB 
WAS AND HOW FAR WORSE THE BREACH

05:32:12.710 --> 05:32:15.267
WAS THEN WE EVEN REALIZED ON 
JANUARY 6. AND HOW CLOSE

05:32:29.186 --> 05:32:31.579
-- WHETHER IT WAS THE VICE 
PRESIDENT OR OTHER MEMBERS, HOW 

05:32:31.814 --> 05:32:34.186
CLOSE THIS COULD'VE POTENTIALLY 
BEEN FAR WORSE IN TERMS OF THE 

05:32:34.418 --> 05:32:37.007
LOSS OF LIFE AND THE VIOLENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

05:32:37.238 --> 05:32:40.233
LEGAL TEAM HAD BACK IN AND A 
REMINDER THAT IT IS THE 

05:32:40.468 --> 05:32:43.770
IMPEACHMENT TEAMS RESPONSIBILITY
TO PROSECUTE THE CASE TODAY AND 

05:32:44.451 --> 05:32:48.663
THEN THE FLOOR WILL BE OPEN 
TOMORROW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

05:32:48.901 --> 05:32:50.901
TEAM AND THEY WILL HAVE TIME TO

05:32:57.902 --> 05:32:59.902
DEFEND PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THIS 
ONE ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT. 

05:33:00.147 --> 05:33:02.533
PRESIDENT TRUMP, NO MATTER WHAT 
IS STILL THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN 

05:33:02.773 --> 05:33:05.387
AMERICAN HISTORY TO BE IMPEACHED
TWICE AND WE WILL SEE JUST HOW 

05:33:05.632 --> 05:33:07.804
FAR THIS ATTEMPT BY THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS GETS TO 

05:33:08.050 --> 05:33:11.590
CONVICT HIM IN THE SENATE. IT IS
A LITTLE AFTER FOUR CLOCK YEAR 

05:33:11.838 --> 05:33:13.775
AND YOU'RE WATCHING SPECIAL 
COVERAGE FROM THE WASHINGTON 

05:33:13.776 --> 05:33:15.776
POST.

05:33:17.265 --> 05:33:20.279
RHONDA, JAMES LAID OUT FOR US 
WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE FOR

05:33:20.532 --> 05:33:22.898
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND 
INTO THE EVENING, FRANKLY. THERE

05:33:23.141 --> 05:33:25.141
IS THIS

05:33:29.297 --> 05:33:31.297
CHRONOLOGICAL BUILD THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DOING, GOING

05:33:31.311 --> 05:33:33.311
BACK TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
COMMENTS BEFORE JANUARY 6. WE 

05:33:33.461 --> 05:33:35.826
HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THE 
MORNING OF THE SIXTH AND THE 

05:33:36.065 --> 05:33:38.447
SPEECH AND NOW THE DRAMA REALLY 
TURNS TO THE CAPITAL CHECK 

05:33:38.699 --> 05:33:40.604
CAPITOL ITSELF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. WE 

05:33:40.605 --> 05:33:44.487
LEFT OFF WITH MADELEINE DEAN WHO
DISSECTED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

05:33:44.891 --> 05:33:47.265
SPEECH SENTENCE BY SENTENCE AND 
LINE BY LINE SHOWING HOW THE 

05:33:47.502 --> 05:33:49.618
CROWD REACTED WHEN THEY HEARD 
HIM SAY SOME OF THOSE 

05:33:49.852 --> 05:33:52.331
STATEMENTS. NEXT UP WE ARE 
LIKELY TO HEAR THAT THEY ARE 

05:33:52.565 --> 05:33:57.870
GOING TO START LOOKING AT THE 
ATTACK, WHEN THAT MOB CAME TO 

05:33:58.117 --> 05:34:00.117
THE CAPITAL, WHAT THEY DID 
OUTSIDE MOMENTS BEFORE ENTERING 

05:34:00.272 --> 05:34:03.031
AND ALSO WHAT THEY DID WHEN THEY
ENTERED. SO WE ARE REALLY 

05:34:03.262 --> 05:34:05.640
WAITING FOR THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
TO SHOW THIS NEW FOOTAGE THAT 

05:34:05.871 --> 05:34:08.255
THEY SAY, I HAVE HEARD THAT IT 
IS GOING TO BE

05:34:12.612 --> 05:34:14.968
VERY DIFFICULT TO WATCH. SOME 
SCENES WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

05:34:15.202 --> 05:34:17.530
WATCH SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT 
ARE REALLY GOING TO HELP 

05:34:17.762 --> 05:34:19.913
UNDERSCORE WHAT THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS ARE TRYING TO DO HERE 

05:34:20.147 --> 05:34:23.110
WHICH IS SHOW THAT THE SPEECH ON
THE SIXTH LED TO THE PEOPLE 

05:34:23.344 --> 05:34:25.232
COMING HERE AND WREAKING HAVOC 
ON THE CAPITOL. 

05:34:25.233 --> 05:34:29.547
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES COMER EARLY IN THE DAY 
AS THE IMPEACHMENT

05:34:40.410 --> 05:34:42.832
MANAGER, JAMIE RASKIN KICK 
THINGS OFF, HE GAVE A WARNING TO

05:34:43.061 --> 05:34:45.168
TEACHERS SAYING IF YOU HAVE 
PEOPLE WATCHING THIS AS AN 

05:34:45.436 --> 05:34:47.547
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE, GREAT, 
WE SHALL BE WATCHING IT BUT HE 

05:34:47.785 --> 05:34:50.158
GAVE THIS WARNING OF THE FACT 
THAT THERE WILL BE DIFFICULT 

05:34:50.524 --> 05:34:53.109
DRAMATIC FOOTAGE PLAYED, SO HE 
SAID IF YOU ARE A TEACHER, A 

05:34:53.357 --> 05:34:55.946
PARENT, BE AWARE OF THAT, REVIEW
IT AND PERHAPS A WATCH WHICH 

05:34:56.487 --> 05:34:59.317
WITH YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE. IT IS A 
POWERFUL COMMENT. IT ALSO IS A 

05:34:59.549 --> 05:35:02.493
LAWYER TACTIC TO SORT OF PREVIEW
THIS IS BIG, HEAVY STUFF. LET'S 

05:35:02.725 --> 05:35:04.856
NOT TAKE THE POLITICS TOTALLY 
OUT OF THE THINGS THAT 

05:35:05.088 --> 05:35:07.852
CONGRESSMAN RASKIN WAS SAYING 
BUT WE ARE GETTING TO THE DAY 

05:35:08.097 --> 05:35:10.097
WHEN

05:35:14.740 --> 05:35:16.152
THIS COULD BE DIFFICULT TO 
WATCH. 

05:35:16.153 --> 05:35:19.039
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY AND THAT IS A 
WARNING WE DID NOT HEAR YOUR GO.

05:35:19.283 --> 05:35:21.883
IT IS A WARNING WE DID NOT EVEN 
HEAR DURING BILL CLINTON'S 

05:35:22.114 --> 05:35:24.212
IMPEACHMENT FOR THE SEXUAL 
CONDUCT HE WAS ACCUSED OF. AND 

05:35:24.442 --> 05:35:27.432
YOU ARE RIGHT, IT IS A LAWYER 
TACTIC BUT IT IS ALSO SOMETHING 

05:35:27.673 --> 05:35:32.104
THAT HIGHLIGHTS JUST HOW 
VISCERAL AND HOW CLOSE THIS IS. 

05:35:32.340 --> 05:35:34.912
THIS WAS NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON 
POLITICIANS. THIS WAS AN ATTACK 

05:35:35.282 --> 05:35:38.910
ON OUR TEMPLE OF DEMOCRACY AND 
KIND OF ONE OF THE KEY SYMBOLS 

05:35:39.144 --> 05:35:43.007
OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL 
REPUBLIC IN THE SYSTEM OF 

05:35:43.439 --> 05:35:45.630
GOVERNMENT ITSELF. JANUARY 6 IS 
A DATE THAT

05:35:49.195 --> 05:35:51.050
IS PRESCRIBED IN THE 
CONSTITUTION FOR WHEN THE 

05:35:51.051 --> 05:35:53.594
ELECTORAL COLLEGE OF VOTES ARE 
COUNTED AND CERTIFIED. SO THIS 

05:35:53.836 --> 05:35:59.354
IS AN ATTACK ON A WORKPLACE AND 
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE 

05:35:59.593 --> 05:36:03.378
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE WORKPLACE
AND HOW IT FELT FOR THEM BUT I 

05:36:03.621 --> 05:36:06.293
THINK ALL AMERICANS IDENTIFY TO 
SOME DEGREE WITH THIS PLACE 

05:36:06.903 --> 05:36:13.159
BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO 
OUR CIVIC LIFE AND THAT IS WHY I

05:36:13.386 --> 05:36:17.520
THINK THESE VIDEOS WILL BE SO 
JARRING FOR SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE 

05:36:17.758 --> 05:36:24.273
THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON NANCY 
PELOSI OR CERTAIN REPUBLICAN 

05:36:24.506 --> 05:36:26.506
SENATORS. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON

05:36:31.224 --> 05:36:33.316
THE AMERICAN SYSTEM ITSELF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND WHY THE IMPORTANCE OF 

05:36:33.547 --> 05:36:35.547
SOMEBODY LIKE CONGRESSMAN DEAN 
TELLING HER PERSONAL STORY AND 

05:36:35.727 --> 05:36:41.376
TALKING ABOUT PLACING A CALL TO 
HER HUSBAND AND SONS. THIS DOES 

05:36:41.621 --> 05:36:43.746
SHOW THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
ARE PEOPLE, TOO. IT SEEMS 

05:36:43.982 --> 05:36:46.366
OBVIOUS BUT IT IS SO EASY TO 
CARICATURE AND VILIFY A 

05:36:46.600 --> 05:36:48.930
POLITICIAN WITH A P THAT MAY BE 
ON THE OPPOSING SIDE.

05:36:55.699 --> 05:36:57.866
THEY HAVE STAFF AND FAMILIES AND
THIS WAS A TERRIFYING 

05:36:58.097 --> 05:37:00.917
EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO
RHONDA WHO HAS BEEN TALKING WITH

05:37:01.151 --> 05:37:03.151
SOME LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE GONE 
THROUGH THAT DRAMATIC DATE. 

05:37:03.280 --> 05:37:05.396
RHONDA, WE ARE ALSO THOUGH, 
SEEING FOOTAGE RELATED TO POLICE

05:37:05.642 --> 05:37:07.642
OFFICERS AND

05:37:11.582 --> 05:37:13.582
IN THE 13 MINUTE MONTAGE THAT 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS PLAYED 

05:37:13.718 --> 05:37:15.718
YESTERDAY, THERE WERE PHYSICAL, 
BRUTAL ATTACKS ON POLICE OFFICER

05:37:15.817 --> 05:37:20.908
AT AND HATEFUL, ANGRY LANGUAGE 
USED AGAINST THEM, VILE, VERBAL 

05:37:21.140 --> 05:37:24.407
ATTACKS ON THEM AS WELL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND I AM WONDERING, TOO IF

05:37:29.214 --> 05:37:31.566
THIS NEVER BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGE 
THAT WE MIGHT SEE TODAY SHOWS 

05:37:31.797 --> 05:37:33.797
THAT AND HIGHLIGHTS THAT THESE 
OFFICERS WERE OVERTAKEN VERY 

05:37:33.928 --> 05:37:36.660
VIOLENTLY BY THE INSURRECTIONIST
. I AM ARE CALLING BACK WHEN

05:37:41.480 --> 05:37:44.052
I WAS HERE ON THE SIXTH AND WE 
WERE EVACUATED FROM CANON 

05:37:44.300 --> 05:37:46.906
HOSPITAL AND TOLD TO GO INTO THE
BASEMENT. A STAFFER WITH THE 

05:37:47.139 --> 05:37:50.014
ARCHITECT OFFICE TOLD US SHE WAS
QUITE SCARED THAT SHE SAW THE 

05:37:50.259 --> 05:37:53.640
MOB WAS OVERTAKING THE CAPITOL 
POLICE OFFICERS AND

05:37:59.411 --> 05:38:02.378
SHE SAID I THINK THAT IS WHY 
THEY WANT YOU ALL IN THE 

05:38:02.625 --> 05:38:04.998
BASEMENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MEN AND WOMEN TO PROTECT 

05:38:05.235 --> 05:38:07.575
YOU ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY MADE 
EVERYBODY IN ONE SPOT. I THINK 

05:38:07.815 --> 05:38:10.876
WE ARE GOING TO SEE SOME SCENES 
FROM THIS SECURITY ANGLE AND THE

05:38:11.113 --> 05:38:13.603
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE ANGLE. 
WE ARE GOING TO SEE SCENES THAT 

05:38:13.835 --> 05:38:16.422
REALLY SHOW HOW VIOLENT THIS 
GROUP WAS TOWARD THE MEN AND 

05:38:16.664 --> 05:38:21.150
WOMEN WHO ARE HERE TO THE 
OFFICERS. THAT IS GOING TO BE 

05:38:21.389 --> 05:38:23.389
PART OF THE CELL THAT THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER

05:38:29.343 --> 05:38:32.186
'S WANT TO SELL TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND SENATORS THAT THIS IS

05:38:32.419 --> 05:38:35.148
REALLY NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. WE 
WERE ALL IN GREAT DANGER. 

05:38:35.149 --> 05:38:37.742
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLEMAN, JAMES HOLMAN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GO 

05:38:38.215 --> 05:38:40.552
BACK TO THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE 
AS PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE.

MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS

05:41:47.143 --> 05:41:51.532

05:41:58.225 --> 05:42:03.353
YOU, IT WAS NOT UNTIL PREPARING 
FOR THIS TRIAL THAT I UNDERSTOOD

05:42:05.056 --> 05:42:10.883
THE FULL SCOPE AND LEARNED THE 
INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE GOING 

05:42:11.336 --> 05:42:16.637
TO SEE, THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE 
EFFORT TO ATTACK A RECEIPT OF 

05:42:16.871 --> 05:42:18.871
GOVERNMENT

05:42:19.955 --> 05:42:24.241
. IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MISSION, TO 

05:42:24.472 --> 05:42:30.852
PREVENT THE CERTIFICATION OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IT WAS AN

05:42:31.084 --> 05:42:38.897
ATTACK TO OUR REPUBLIC. TO OUR 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. MY 

05:42:39.656 --> 05:42:41.656
COLLEAGUES, MANAGER

05:42:45.449 --> 05:42:48.421
SWALWELL AND I ARE GOING TO WALK
YOU THROUGH THE ATTACK ON THE 

05:42:48.654 --> 05:42:51.460
CAPITOL THAT DAY AND  THE DANGER
THAT IT POST TO THE VICE 

05:42:51.690 --> 05:42:55.752
PRESIDENT, TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE, TO YOU ALL AS SENATORS, 

05:42:56.473 --> 05:43:02.485
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE, 
CAPITOL POLICE AND EVERYONE WHO 

05:43:02.722 --> 05:43:10.379
WORKS IN AND AROUND THIS 
CAPITOL. AS YOU HAVE, PRESIDENT 

05:43:10.612 --> 05:43:13.983
TRUMP HAD BEEN TELLING HIS 
SUPPORTERS AND HIS MILLIONS OF 

05:43:14.211 --> 05:43:16.211
TWITTER FOLLOWERS THAT PENCE HAD
THE ABILITY

05:43:20.521 --> 05:43:22.673
TO SECURE THE PRESIDENCY FOR 
TRUMP, THAT MIKE PENCE ALONE 

05:43:22.907 --> 05:43:29.263
HAVE THE POWER TO OVERTURN THE 
ELECTION RESULTS. -- IF HE WOULD

05:43:29.496 --> 05:43:36.128
JUST DO IT. BUT AT 12:50 5 PM ON
JANUARY 6, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 

05:43:36.363 --> 05:43:39.425
FORMALLY REFUSED THE PRESIDENT'S
DEMAND.

05:43:44.982 --> 05:43:47.829
HE WROTE, AND I QUOTE, "IT IS MY
CONSIDERED JUDGMENT THAT MY OATH

05:43:48.059 --> 05:43:52.225
TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE 
CONSTITUTION CONSTRAINS ME

05:43:58.089 --> 05:43:59.712
FROM CLAIMING UNILATERAL 
AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHICH 

05:43:59.713 --> 05:44:02.153
ELECTORAL VOTES SHOULD BE 
COUNTED AND WHICH SHOULD NOT." 

05:44:02.385 --> 05:44:08.318
PENCE ENDED HIS LETTER WITH A 
PASSAGE INCLUDING THE WORDS, "I 

05:44:08.555 --> 05:44:13.117
WILL DO MY DUTY." EVEN THOUGH 
THE COUNT RESULTED IN THE DEFEAT

05:44:15.869 --> 05:44:18.752
OF HIS PARTY AND HIS OWN 
CANDIDACY, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 

05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:24.925
HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST
THE PRESIDENT. TELL THE AMERICAN

05:44:25.165 --> 05:44:33.769
PUBLIC THE TRUTH AND UPHOLD OUR 
CONSTITUTION. THAT IS 

05:44:34.001 --> 05:44:39.867
PATRIOTISM. THAT PATRIOTISM IS 
ALSO WHAT PUT VICE PRESIDENT IN 

05:44:40.141 --> 05:44:46.390
SO MUCH DANGER ON JANUARY 6 BY 
THE MOB SENT BY OUR PRESIDENT.

05:44:50.841 --> 05:44:53.435
TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE MOB HE 
INCITED, THAT DUTY TO OUR 

05:44:53.667 --> 05:44:56.796
CONSTITUTION WAS AN ALL-OUT 
BETRAYAL. AND THE VICE PRESIDENT

05:44:57.677 --> 05:45:01.052
WAS THE DIRECT TARGET OF THAT 
RAGE.

05:45:09.790 --> 05:45:12.060
AT 12:50 3 PM, SENATORS, MEMBERS

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
PRESIDED OVER THE JOINT SESSION,

05:46:57.025 --> 05:47:00.247
TRUMP SUPPORTERS BEGIN THEIR 
ASSAULT ON OUR CAPITAL.

05:47:03.769 --> 05:47:05.175
RADIOCOMMUNICATION'S FROM THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT 

05:47:05.176 --> 05:47:09.926

05:47:42.008 --> 05:47:47.628

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:48:31.913 --> 05:48:33.913
AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DISMANTLE 
THE OUTERMOST PERIMETER, THE 

05:48:34.128 --> 05:48:39.222
RIOTERS DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR 
POWER TO STORM PAST THE POLICE 

05:48:39.455 --> 05:48:42.719
AND INTO THE CAPITOL. THEY 
COORDINATED MOVING METAL 

05:48:42.949 --> 05:48:44.949
BARRICADES. THE POLICE WERE 
USING THEM TO MAINTAIN DISTANCE.

05:48:45.050 --> 05:48:47.050
LISTEN TO THE YELLING

05:48:51.615 --> 05:48:54.377
, "PULL THEM THIS WAY." AS THEY 
GRAB THE BARRIERS AND ATTACK 

05:48:54.640 --> 05:48:56.069
OFFICERS TRYING TO HOLD THE 
LINE. 

05:48:56.070 --> 05:49:03.531

05:49:39.961 --> 05:49:42.632
SHORTLY AFTER, AT 1:40 5 PM,

CAPITOL POLICE, PROTECTING THE 
CAPITAL'S CAPITOL'S

05:49:58.200 --> 05:50:00.360
WEST STEPS, THE SIDE FACING THE 
WHITE HOUSE. IN ANOTHER 

05:50:00.591 --> 05:50:01.782
RADIOCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN 
METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICERS, 

05:50:01.783 --> 05:50:04.812
YOU CAN HEAR AN OFFICER DECLARE 
THAT THERE IS A RIOT AT THE 

05:50:05.051 --> 05:50:11.653
CAPITOL AT 1:40 9 PM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 50 WE ARE GOING TO GIVE

RIGHT WARNINGS! WE ARE GOING TO 
GIVE RIOT WARNINGS. THIS IS NOW 

05:50:17.851 --> 05:50:22.409
OFFICIALLY A RIOT.

SEVERAL VIDEOS THAT FOLLOW HAVE 

05:50:27.822 --> 05:50:31.610

05:50:32.263 --> 05:50:36.988
OF THE CAPITOL ON THE SENATE 
SIDE, THE SIDE FACING THE WHITE 

05:50:37.223 --> 05:50:41.668
HOUSE. WATCH THE RED DOT WHICH 
MOVES UP THE LOWER STEPS OF THE 

05:50:42.265 --> 05:50:49.026
CAPITAL TOO CAPITOL INDICATING 
THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE 

05:50:49.262 --> 05:50:51.199
RIOTERS AS THEY SEARCH PAST THE 
POLICE. 

05:50:51.200 --> 05:50:54.059
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

05:51:19.231 --> 05:51:26.383
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE THE MOB THAT DONALD 
TRUMP SENT TO STOP THE 

05:51:26.849 --> 05:51:29.211
CERTIFICATION CAME CLOSER AND 
CLOSER TO BREACHING THE CAPITOL,

05:51:29.454 --> 05:51:33.786
JUST ONE FLOOR BELOW WHERE WE 
ARE NOW, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 

05:51:34.017 --> 05:51:38.220
CONTINUED TO PRESIDE OVER THE 
SESSION IN THE SENATE CHAMBER 

05:51:38.454 --> 05:51:45.589
ABOVE. AT ABOUT 2:12 PM, SECRET 
SERVICE QUICKLY AND SUDDENLY 

05:51:45.991 --> 05:51:51.645
EVACUATED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
FROM THE SENATE FLOOR. HERE IS 

05:51:51.917 --> 05:51:53.642
THE IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THAT 
EVACUATION. 

05:51:53.643 --> 05:51:57.146
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL THEY JUST CUT OUT, IT 
LOOKS LIKE -- 

05:51:57.147 --> 05:52:02.339
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT FEELS LIKE THEY JUST TOOK 
MIKE PENCE OUT RATHER QUICKLY. 

05:52:02.581 --> 05:52:07.672
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JUST 
HAPPENED THERE. THEY USHERED 

05:52:08.102 --> 05:52:10.929
MIKE PENCE OUT, MOVED HIM FAST 
AND I SAW THE MOTIONS, TOO. 

05:52:10.930 --> 05:52:13.568
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE THE VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE WAS BEING EVACUATED FROM 

05:52:13.800 --> 05:52:17.715
THE SENATE CHAMBER, WRITERS WERE
AT THAT TIME BREAKING INTO THE 

05:52:17.949 --> 05:52:23.527
CAPITOL. THIS NEXT VIDEO SHOWS 
THEIR APPROACH AND THE INITIAL 

05:52:23.760 --> 05:52:27.595
BREACH OF THE CAPITOL COMPLEX. 
REMEMBER TO WATCH THE RED DOT 

05:52:28.317 --> 05:52:30.317
WHICH BROKE

05:52:33.546 --> 05:52:37.353
-- BEING TRACKING THROUGHOUT 
THIS INCIDENT. 

05:52:37.354 --> 05:52:39.466
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

05:53:17.211 --> 05:53:19.252
WE NEED JUSTICE! WE NEED 
JUSTICE! 

05:53:19.253 --> 05:53:21.253
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

05:53:29.197 --> 05:53:31.197
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

05:53:44.300 --> 05:53:46.300
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; KILL HIM! KILL HIM! 

05:53:51.463 --> 05:53:53.463
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

05:53:58.884 --> 05:54:05.901
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU,
THROUGH SECURITY FOOTAGE THAT 

05:54:06.135 --> 05:54:08.523
HAS NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC BEFORE,
WHAT THAT SAME BREACH LOOKED 

05:54:08.770 --> 05:54:13.378
LIKE FROM THE INSIDE. NOW, 
BECAUSE THIS IS SECURITY 

05:54:13.608 --> 05:54:16.516
FOOTAGE, THERE IS NO SOUND. 

05:54:44.371 --> 05:54:47.366
NOTE AS THE VIDEO BEGINS WE ARE 
SEEING THE INSIDE VIEW AS THE 

05:54:47.598 --> 05:54:54.086
MOB APPROACHES FROM OUTSIDE AND 
BEATS THE WINDOWS AND DOORS. YOU

05:54:54.317 --> 05:54:59.192
CAN SEE THAT THE RIOTERS FIRST 
BREAK THE WINDOW WITH THE WOODEN

05:54:59.438 --> 05:55:01.651
BEAM YOU SAW PREVIOUSLY AND A 
LOAN POLICE OFFICER INSIDE 

05:55:01.882 --> 05:55:08.101
RESPONSE AND BEGINS TO SPRAY THE
FIRST MAN WHO ENTERS BUT IS 

05:55:08.865 --> 05:55:10.865
QUICKLY OVERWHELMED.

05:55:15.778 --> 05:55:18.601
I WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO 
THE FIRST GROUP OF ASSAILANTS AS

05:55:18.839 --> 05:55:20.959
THEY BREAK INTO THE BUILDING. 
THE SECOND MAN THROUGH THE 

05:55:21.188 --> 05:55:24.447
WINDOW IS WEARING FULL TACTICAL 
BODY ARMOR. HE IS CARRYING A 

05:55:25.092 --> 05:55:28.727
BASEBALL BAT. OTHERS ARE 
CARRYING RIOT SHIELDS. AMONG 

05:55:29.481 --> 05:55:31.481
THIS GROUP ARE MEMBERS OF THE

05:55:36.712 --> 05:55:39.219
PROUD BOYS, SOME OF WHOM LIKE 
DOMINIC ZOLA WHO WAS RECENTLY 

05:55:39.453 --> 05:55:43.776
INDICTED ON FEDERAL CONSPIRACY 
CHARGES WE WILL DISCUSS LATER. 

05:55:44.198 --> 05:55:47.394
YOU CAN WATCH WHERE THEY ARE 
COMING ON OUR MODEL AS WELL.

05:56:03.434 --> 05:56:07.128
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MODEL 
THAT WAS CREATED FOR THIS

05:56:16.660 --> 05:56:19.912
, I THOUGHT BACK TO SEPTEMBER 
11. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU WERE 

05:56:20.142 --> 05:56:22.702
HERE. SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN MEMBERS ON THE HOUSE SIDE. 

05:56:22.941 --> 05:56:26.263
I WAS ALSO HERE ON SEPTEMBER 11.
I WAS A STAFFER AT THAT TIME. MY

05:56:26.494 --> 05:56:31.765
OFFICE WAS ON THE WEST FRONT OF 
THE CAPITOL. I WORKED IN THE 

05:56:31.997 --> 05:56:35.158
CAPITOL AND I WAS ON THE HOUSE 
SIDE. THIS YEAR IS 20 YEARS 

05:56:35.563 --> 05:56:41.295
SINCE THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 
11. ALMOST EVERY DAY, I REMEMBER

05:56:43.814 --> 05:56:46.483
THAT 44 AMERICANS GAVE THEIR 
LIVES TO STOP

05:56:50.342 --> 05:56:52.676
THE PLANE THAT WAS HEADED TO 
THIS CAPITOL BUILDING. I THANK 

05:56:52.907 --> 05:56:56.938
THEM EVERY DAY FOR SAVING MY 
LIFE AND THE LIFE OF SO MANY 

05:56:57.178 --> 05:57:03.403
OTHERS. THOSE AMERICANS 
SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES FOR LOVE 

05:57:04.135 --> 05:57:11.133
OF COUNTRY, HONOR, DUTY, ALL THE
THINGS THAT AMERICA MEANS.

05:57:14.537 --> 05:57:20.453
THE CAPITOL STANDS BECAUSE OF 
PEOPLE LIKE THAT. THIS

05:57:23.284 --> 05:57:26.444
WAS CONCEIVED BY OUR FOUNDING 
FATHERS, WAS BUILT BY SAVED 

05:57:26.683 --> 05:57:28.683
SLAVES AND REMAINS

05:57:32.554 --> 05:57:35.258
BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICE OF MEN 
AND WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD AND 

05:57:35.492 --> 05:57:38.268
WHEN I THINK OF THAT AND I THINK
OF THESE INSURGENTS, THESE 

05:57:38.505 --> 05:57:45.376
IMAGES INCITED BY OUR OWN 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

05:57:45.963 --> 05:57:52.087
ATTACKING THIS CAPITOL TO STOP 
THE CERTIFICATION OF A 

05:57:52.830 --> 05:57:58.697
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, OUR 
DEMOCRACY, OUR REPUBLIC,

05:58:04.748 --> 05:58:07.839
THE SAME TIME THAT THAT BREACH 
ON THIS CAPITOL BUILDING 

05:58:08.072 --> 05:58:13.546
OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 2:13 
P.M., JUST ONE FLOOR UP, WHILE 

05:58:14.250 --> 05:58:17.189
SENATOR LANGFORD WAS SPEAKING ON
THE SENATE FLOOR, SENATOR 

05:58:17.417 --> 05:58:24.730
GRASSLEY WHO HAD TAKEN OVER FOR 
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE CALLED AN 

05:58:24.982 --> 05:58:28.483
UNSCHEDULED IMMEDIATE RECESS OF 
THE SENATE. A SENATE EIGHT 

05:58:28.713 --> 05:58:31.611
APPROACHED SENATOR LANGFORD AND 
INFORMED HIM THE CAPITOL HAD 

05:58:32.283 --> 05:58:36.256
BEEN BREACHED. SENATOR GRASSLEY 
IS IMMEDIATELY ESCORTED OUT OF 

05:58:36.488 --> 05:58:38.488
THE SENATE CHAMBER.

05:58:44.538 --> 05:58:46.538
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- THANK YOU.

05:58:49.971 --> 05:58:54.122
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON, 
OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN RESPONDED

05:58:54.353 --> 05:58:59.731
TO THE INITIAL BREACH. YOU ALL 
MAY HAVE SEEN FOOTAGE OF OFFICER

05:59:00.324 --> 05:59:06.235
GOODMAN PREVIOUSLY BUT THERE IS 
MORE TO HIS HEROIC STORY. IN 

05:59:06.469 --> 05:59:09.488
THIS SECURITY FOOTAGE, YOU CAN 
SEE OFFICER GOODMAN RUNNING TO 

05:59:09.716 --> 05:59:13.334
RESPOND TO THE INITIAL BREACH. 

05:59:17.293 --> 05:59:23.407
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OFFICER GOODMAN PASSES 
SENATOR MITT ROMNEY AND DIRECTS 

05:59:23.643 --> 05:59:26.369
HIM TO TURN AROUND IN ORDER TO 
GET TO SAFETY.

05:59:31.204 --> 05:59:33.937
ON THE FIRST FLOOR, JUST BENEATH
THEM, THE MOB HAD ALREADY 

05:59:34.175 --> 05:59:39.971
STARTED TO SEARCH FOR THE SENATE
CHAMBER. OFFICER GOODMAN MADE 

05:59:40.202 --> 05:59:44.679
HIS WAY DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR 
WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED THE SAME 

05:59:44.924 --> 05:59:47.311
INSURRECTIONIST WE JUST SAW 
WATCH

05:59:51.131 --> 05:59:53.605
BREACH THE CAPITAL. IN THIS 
VIDEO, WE CAN SEE THE RIOTERS 

05:59:53.878 --> 05:59:56.920
SURGED TOWARD OFFICER GOODMAN. 
RECALL THAT THE

06:00:04.467 --> 06:00:07.089
WRITERS ARE IN RED AND OFFICER 
GOODMAN IN THIS MODEL IS IN 

06:00:07.319 --> 06:00:09.319
BLUE. WATCH OFFICER GOODMAN WHO 
BACKS UP THE STAIRS. 

06:01:25.712 --> 06:01:29.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEY, YOU WORK FOR US! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL DO IT. WE WILL DO IT!

06:01:29.400 --> 06:01:31.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEY! HEY! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

06:01:33.895 --> 06:01:38.666
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEY, -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

06:01:45.470 --> 06:01:50.311
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YO! YO! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT WORTH 

06:01:50.540 --> 06:01:52.540
IT! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEY -- 

06:02:00.763 --> 06:02:02.763
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:02:04.981 --> 06:02:07.365
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SHOUTING THAT
THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY WEAPONS, 

06:02:07.606 --> 06:02:11.738
WE KNOW FROM THE EARLIER VIDEO 
THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE. THE 

06:02:12.200 --> 06:02:14.200
SECOND ASSAILANT

06:02:17.026 --> 06:02:19.398
THROUGH THE BREACH WAS THE ONE 
CARRYING A METAL BASEBALL BAT. 

06:02:19.628 --> 06:02:22.591
WE KNOW THERE WERE OTHER WEAPONS
THERE THAT DAY. DID YOU HEAR THE

06:02:22.823 --> 06:02:26.887
OTHER SHOTS? WE ARE HERE FOR 
YOU! HE IS ONE PERSON, WE ARE 

06:02:27.514 --> 06:02:34.797
THOUSANDS. AND WHERE DO THEY 
COUNT THE VOTES? THEY WERE 

06:02:35.027 --> 06:02:37.358
COMING AT THE URGING OF DONALD 
TRUMP TO KEEP CONGRESS, A 

06:02:37.645 --> 06:02:42.874
SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, 
FROM CERTIFYING THE RESULTS OF A

06:02:43.608 --> 06:02:46.174
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AS THE 
RIOTERS REACHED

06:02:52.039 --> 06:02:55.004
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, THEY WERE
WITHIN 100 FEET OF WHERE THE 

06:02:55.241 --> 06:02:57.403
VICE PRESIDENT WAS SHELTERING 
WITH HIS FAMILY. AND THEY WERE 

06:02:57.645 --> 06:03:00.221
JUST FEET AWAY FROM ONE OF THE 
DOORS TO THIS CHAMBER. WHERE 

06:03:00.457 --> 06:03:03.944
MANY OF YOU REMAINED AT THAT 
TIME. I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU A 

06:03:04.188 --> 06:03:08.242
DIFFERENT ANGLE FROM THE 
SECURITY FOOTAGE OF OFFICER 

06:03:08.978 --> 06:03:12.086
GOODMAN'S ACTS. THIS VIDEO IS ON
THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE SENATE 

06:03:12.316 --> 06:03:18.518
WING OF THE CAPITOL. THE RED DOT
, AS YOU RECALL, REPRESENTS THE 

06:03:18.754 --> 06:03:20.754
INSURRECTIONISTS

06:03:23.716 --> 06:03:26.521
. THE BLUE DOT IS OFFICER 
GOODMAN WHO LED THE MOB AWAY 

06:03:26.752 --> 06:03:28.752
FROM THE CHAMBER JUST MINUTES 
EARLIER. 

06:03:41.731 --> 06:03:44.662
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE 
VIDEO JUST INSIDE THE HOLLOW IS 

06:03:44.895 --> 06:03:46.895
THE DOORWAY TO THE SENATE 
CHAMBER. WATCH HOW OFFICER 

06:03:47.045 --> 06:03:49.144
GOODMAN PROVOKES THE RIOTERS AND
PURPOSEFULLY DRAWS THEM AWAY 

06:03:49.376 --> 06:03:52.204
FROM THE DOOR TO THE SENATE 
CHAMBER AND TOWARDS THE OTHER 

06:03:52.570 --> 06:04:00.091
OFFICERS WAITING DOWN THE HALL. 
THE WRITER SEEN CARRYING -- THE 

06:04:00.321 --> 06:04:02.321
RIOTER

06:04:03.865 --> 06:04:06.493
SEEN CARRYING A BASEBALL THAT IS
THE SAME ONE BREACHING A WINDOW 

06:04:06.729 --> 06:04:11.973
ON THE VIDEO BEFORE. WHILE ALL 
OF THIS WAS GOING ON, VICE 

06:04:12.203 --> 06:04:15.336
PRESIDENT PENCE WAS STILL IN THE
ROOM NEAR THE SENATE CHAMBER. IT

06:04:15.566 --> 06:04:22.762
WAS NOT UNTIL 2:26 THAT HE WAS 
EVACUATED TO A SECURE LOCATION. 

06:04:23.182 --> 06:04:26.428
THIS NEXT SECURITY VIDEO SHOWS 
THAT EVACUATION.

06:04:32.444 --> 06:04:35.198
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE DEPICTED BY 
THE ORANGE DOT IN OUR MODEL. THE

06:04:35.432 --> 06:04:37.817
RED AND BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE 
LOCATION WHERE THE MOB AND 

06:04:38.052 --> 06:04:40.639
OFFICER GOODMAN WERE AND WHERE 
OFFICER GOODMAN LED THE MOB AWAY

06:04:40.892 --> 06:04:42.892
FROM THE CHAMBER MOMENTS AGO.

06:04:47.601 --> 06:04:52.545
YOU CAN SEE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE
AND HIS FAMILY QUICKLY MOVE DOWN

06:04:52.793 --> 06:04:55.210
THE STAIRS. THE VICE PRESIDENT 
TURNS AROUND BRIEFLY AS HE IS 

06:04:55.587 --> 06:05:03.310
HEADED DOWN. AS PENCE WAS BEING 
EVACUATED, RIOTERS STARTED TO 

06:05:04.068 --> 06:05:09.268
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL. 
THOSE INSIDE HELPED OTHER 

06:05:09.503 --> 06:05:12.199
RIOTERS BREAK IN THROUGH DOORS

06:05:18.732 --> 06:05:21.107
IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE 
ENTIRE BUILDING AND THE MOB WAS 

06:05:21.339 --> 06:05:23.339
LOOKING FOR VICE PRESIDENT PENCE
BECAUSE OF HIS PATRIOTISM. 

06:05:23.442 --> 06:05:27.629
BECAUSE THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD 
REFUSED TO DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT

06:05:27.859 --> 06:05:33.583
DEMAND AND OVERTURN THE ELECTION
RESULTS. DURING THE ASSAULT ON 

06:05:34.253 --> 06:05:37.818
THE CAPITAL, EXTREMISTS 
REPORTEDLY COORDINATED ONLINE 

06:05:38.232 --> 06:05:43.402
AND DISCUSSED HOW THEY WOULD 
HUNT DOWN THE VICE PRESIDENT. 

06:05:43.821 --> 06:05:46.911
JOURNALISTS IN THE CAPITAL 
REPORTED THEY HEARD RIOTERS SAY 

06:05:47.147 --> 06:05:55.383
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR PENCE IN 
ORDER TO EXECUTE HIM. TRUMP 

06:05:55.618 --> 06:06:01.926
SUPPORTERS HAD ERECTED A GALLOWS
ON THE LAWN IN FRONT OF THE 

06:06:02.597 --> 06:06:04.597
CAPITOL BUILDING.

06:06:06.647 --> 06:06:08.651
ANOTHER GROUP OF RIOTERS 
CHANTED, "HANG MIKE PENCE

06:06:15.991 --> 06:06:19.245
" AS THEY STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR
OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING. YOU CAN

06:06:19.478 --> 06:06:22.074
HEAR THE SECURITY ALARM FROM THE
DOOR IN THE BACKGROUND AND YOU 

06:06:22.307 --> 06:06:25.147
CAN HEAR THE MOB CALLING FOR THE
DEATH OF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF 

06:06:25.375 --> 06:06:29.082
THE UNITED STATES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HANG MIKE PENCE!

06:06:33.723 --> 06:06:36.169
HANG MIKE PENCE! HANG MIKE 
PENCE! HANG MIKE PENCE! 

06:06:36.170 --> 06:06:38.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:06:41.410 --> 06:06:44.046
THIS WAS NOT AN ISOLATED AREA OR
INCIDENT WHERE THAT WAS BEING 

06:06:44.279 --> 06:06:46.865
TOLD. WEAR THAT WAS BEING SAID. 
IT WAS GOING ON EVERYWHERE. 

06:06:47.197 --> 06:06:50.007
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 
CROWD OUTSIDE YELLING, BRING OUT

06:06:50.239 --> 06:06:56.109
PENCE. BRING HIM OUT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRING HIM OUT! BRING HIM OUT!

06:06:59.754 --> 06:07:02.136
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRING OUT PENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRING HIM OUT! 

06:07:02.137 --> 06:07:05.320
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRING OUT PENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRING HIM OUT. 

06:07:05.321 --> 06:07:09.673
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRING OUT PENCE! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 

06:07:09.905 --> 06:07:14.296
PRIMED HIS FOLLOWERS FOR MONTHS 
AND INFLAMED THE RALLY GOERS 

06:07:14.995 --> 06:07:19.782
THAT MORNING, IT IS NO WONDER 
THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 

06:07:20.018 --> 06:07:24.022
UNITED STATES WAS THE TARGET OF 
THEIR WRATH. AFTER PENCE REFUSED

06:07:24.252 --> 06:07:31.898
TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION RESULTS
. LISTEN TO THIS MAN EXPLAINED. 

06:07:32.300 --> 06:07:38.076
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, CONGRESS COWARDS HID IN
THEIR INSIDE AND

06:07:41.783 --> 06:07:43.783
EXPORTED AWAY

06:07:48.847 --> 06:07:51.426
BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE 
COWARDS AND CANNOT DO THE RIGHT 

06:07:51.659 --> 06:07:54.005
THING. PENCE, LIKE THOSE IS A 
TOTAL TREASONOUS PIG AND HIS 

06:07:54.236 --> 06:07:56.860
NAME WILL BE MUD FOREVER. NOW, 
THE REAL BATTLE BEGINS. AND IT 

06:07:57.094 --> 06:08:03.155
LOOKS LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
ARE VERY PEST. SO GOOD LUCK WITH

06:08:03.399 --> 06:08:10.929
THAT. PIECE OUT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PEACE OUT. SEVERAL 

06:08:11.688 --> 06:08:13.688
INSURRECTIONISTS DESCRIBED WHAT 
THEY

06:08:17.749 --> 06:08:19.880
HAD PLANNED TO DO IF THEY 
ENCOUNTERED THE VICE PRESIDENT 

06:08:20.118 --> 06:08:22.118
OR OTHER LAWMAKERS. ONE OF THEM,

06:08:27.498 --> 06:08:33.292
DOMNIC PIZOLA,  CAME TO THE 
CAPITOL WITH DEADLY INTENTIONS. 

06:08:33.523 --> 06:08:35.523
HE COMMANDEERED A CAPITOL

06:08:40.736 --> 06:08:43.222
POLICE SHIELD, USED IT TO SMASH 
A GLASS WINDOW, ENTER THE 

06:08:43.454 --> 06:08:45.573
CAPITOL AND PAVE THE WAY FOR 
DOZENS OF INSURRECTIONISTS. AS 

06:08:45.809 --> 06:08:48.667
YOU RECALL FROM AN EARLIER 
VIDEO, HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 

06:08:48.898 --> 06:08:54.449
WAVE OF WRITERS TO BREACH THE 
BUILDING. ON THE LEFT, YOU CAN 

06:08:54.690 --> 06:08:57.330
SEE A SCREENSHOT FROM THE VIDEO 
OF THE BREAK IN WE SHOWED 

06:08:57.561 --> 06:09:02.903
EARLIER AND ON THE RIGHT, YOU 
CAN SEE PIZOLA, IN THE MOB,  

06:09:03.213 --> 06:09:11.111
CHASE CAPITAL CAPITAL POLICE 
OFFICER GOODMAN. 

06:09:12.057 --> 06:09:16.252
BEEN CHARGED WITH EIGHT CRIMES 
FOR HIS CONDUCT RELATED TO

06:09:25.358 --> 06:09:27.358
JANUARY 6. ACCORDING TO AN 
AFFIDAVIT SUBMITTED TO THE 

06:09:27.454 --> 06:09:30.297
COURT, THE GROUP THAT WAS WITH 
HIM DURING THE SACK OF THE 

06:09:30.526 --> 06:09:32.861
CAPITAL CONFIRMED THEY WERE OUT 
TO MURDER "ANYONE THEY GOT THEIR

06:09:33.090 --> 06:09:36.390
HANDS ON." HERE IS WHAT THE FBI 
SAID. AND I QUOTE, "OTHER 

06:09:36.621 --> 06:09:38.953
MEMBERS OF THE GROUP TALKED 
ABOUT THINGS THEY HAD DONE THAT 

06:09:39.187 --> 06:09:43.328
DAY. THEY SAID THAT ANYONE THEY 
GOT THEIR HANDS ON, THEY WOULD 

06:09:43.560 --> 06:09:47.945
HAVE KILLED. INCLUDING NANCY 
PELOSI AND THEY WOULD HAVE 

06:09:48.179 --> 06:09:54.039
KILLED VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE
IF GIVEN THE CHANCE." THEY WERE 

06:09:54.769 --> 06:10:00.110
TALKING ABOUT ASSASSINATING THE 
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

06:10:00.344 --> 06:10:02.344
STATES.

06:10:04.889 --> 06:10:07.232
DURING THE COURSE OF THE ATTACK,
THE VICE PRESIDENT NEVER LEFT 

06:10:07.694 --> 06:10:09.694
THE CAPITAL.

06:10:11.494 --> 06:10:13.832
CAPITOL. HE REMAINED LOCKED DOWN
WITH HIS FAMILY, WITH HIS FAMILY

06:10:14.064 --> 06:10:16.971
INSIDE THE BUILDING. REMEMBER 
THAT. AS YOU THINK ABOUT THESE 

06:10:17.205 --> 06:10:20.579
IMAGES AND THE SOUNDS OF THE 
ATTACK. THE VICE PRESIDENT, OUR 

06:10:20.811 --> 06:10:25.962
SECOND-IN-COMMAND WAS ALWAYS AT 
THE CENTER OF IT. VICE PRESIDENT

06:10:26.197 --> 06:10:30.181
PENCE WAS THREATENED WITH DEATH 
BY THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS 

06:10:30.429 --> 06:10:34.519
BECAUSE HE REJECTED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT HE OVERTURN 

06:10:35.222 --> 06:10:40.094
THE ELECTION. THE MOB ALSO WENT 
AFTER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WHO 

06:10:40.340 --> 06:10:42.340
ALONGSIDE THE RESIDENT

06:10:46.482 --> 06:10:48.575
VICE PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDING 
OVER THE JOINT SESSION OF THE 

06:10:48.805 --> 06:10:52.100
CERTIFICATION IN THE HOUSE 
CHAMBER. THE CHILLING EVIDENCE 

06:10:52.330 --> 06:10:56.172
SHOWS THAT ON JANUARY 6, ARMED 
AND ORGANIZED INSURRECTIONISTS 

06:10:56.579 --> 06:10:58.579
TRAINED THEIR SIGHTS ON

06:11:05.492 --> 06:11:08.249
SPEAKER PELOSI. THEY SOUGHT OUT 
THE SPEAKER ON THE FLOOR AND IN 

06:11:08.486 --> 06:11:10.653
HER OFFICE, PUBLICLY DECLARED 
THEIR INTENT TO HARM OR KILL 

06:11:10.903 --> 06:11:13.034
HER, RANSACKED HER OFFICE AND 
TERRORIZED HER STUFF. AND THEY 

06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:19.913
DID IT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP SENT
THEM ON THIS MISSION. AS THE 

06:11:20.145 --> 06:11:22.145
INSURRECTIONISTS GOT CLOSER, 

06:11:25.463 --> 06:11:27.805
CAPITOL POLICE RUSHED THE 
SPEAKER FROM THE HOUSE FLOOR AT 

06:11:28.061 --> 06:11:31.230
2:15 P.M., MINUTES AFTER THE 
CAPITOL WAS FIRST BREACHED. THEY

06:11:31.461 --> 06:11:33.461
RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY THAT SHE 
WAS IN DANGER.

06:11:38.233 --> 06:11:40.711
THE SPEAKER IS NOT JUST RUSHED 
FROM THE FLOOR. THE CAPITOL 

06:11:40.950 --> 06:11:42.950
POLICE DEEMED THE THREAT SO 
DANGEROUS THAT THEY EVACUATED 

06:11:43.161 --> 06:11:48.220
HER ENTIRELY FROM THE CAPITOL 
COMPLEX. THEY RUSHED HER TO A

RIOTERS THEMSELVES THAT IF THEY

NANCY. THAT IS TRUMP'S NICKNAME

WHICH IS MARKED IN RED. THE 

06:14:07.752 --> 06:14:09.752
HOUSE CHAMBER IT SELF.

AND RANSACKED HER OFFICE. 
RIOTERS BROKE IN AND RANSACKED 

06:14:50.359 --> 06:14:52.359
HER OFFICE.

06:15:00.124 --> 06:15:02.257
THE STAFF RETREATED INTO AN 
INTERIOR ROOM. EIGHT OF THEM 

06:15:02.492 --> 06:15:04.650
GATHERED IN A CONFERENCE ROOM. 
ABOUT THE SAME TIME, CAPITOL 

06:15:04.882 --> 06:15:08.047
POLICE ANNOUNCED THE CAPITAL HAD
BEEN BREACHED. SPEAKER PELOSI'S 

06:15:08.286 --> 06:15:11.232
STAFF HEEDED THE CALL TO SHELTER
IN PLACE. ON OUR MODEL YOU CAN 

06:15:11.466 --> 06:15:17.219
SEE THE RIOTERS IN THE ROTUNDA 
IN RED AND THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE.

06:15:17.453 --> 06:15:19.572
THIS IS A SECURITY VIDEO SO 
THERE IS NO SOUND. 

06:15:25.289 --> 06:15:27.792
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THE STAFF 
MOVES FROM THEIR OFFICES, 

06:15:28.026 --> 06:15:30.804
THROUGH THE HALLS AND THEN 
ENTERS A DOOR ON THE RIGHT-HAND 

06:15:31.053 --> 06:15:37.439
SIDE. THAT IS THE OUTER DOOR OF 
A CONFERENCE ROOM WHICH ALSO HAS

06:15:37.674 --> 06:15:40.004
AN INNER DOOR THAT THEY 
BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE. THE 

06:15:40.249 --> 06:15:44.411
STAFF THEN HID UNDER A 
CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE IN THAT IN

06:15:45.100 --> 06:15:54.275
A ROOM. IN HER ROOM. AN ERROR --
INNER

06:15:56.168 --> 06:16:00.966
ROOM. THIS IS THE STAFF 
BARRICADING THEMSELVES INSIDE 

06:16:01.201 --> 06:16:06.294
THE INNER OFFICE. AFTER SEVEN 
MINUTES OF THEM BARRICADING 

06:16:06.526 --> 06:16:08.526
THEMSELVES AND THE LAST

06:16:11.286 --> 06:16:13.612
STAFFER ENTERING THE DOOR ON THE
RIGHT, A GROUP OF RIOTERS 

06:16:13.873 --> 06:16:15.873
ENTERED THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE. 
ONCE INSIDE, THE RIOTERS HAD 

06:16:16.227 --> 06:16:18.227
FREE REIGN

06:16:25.199 --> 06:16:27.542
IN THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE'S 
OFFICES. IN THIS SECURITY VIDEO,

06:16:27.774 --> 06:16:30.131
PAY ATTENTION TO THE DOOR THAT 
WE SAW THOSE STAFFERS LEADING 

06:16:30.363 --> 06:16:36.286
INTO AND GOING INTO. ONE OF THE 
RIOTERS YOU CAN SEE IS THROWING 

06:16:37.251 --> 06:16:41.617
-- AGAINST THE DOOR THREE TIMES 
UNTIL HE BREAKS OPEN THE

06:16:49.513 --> 06:16:51.912
OUTER DOOR. LUCKILY WHEN FACED 
WITH THE INNER DOOR, HE MOVES 

06:16:52.167 --> 06:16:54.167
ON. ANOTHER RIOTER LATER TRIED, 
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO BREAK THROUGH 

06:16:54.298 --> 06:16:58.472
THAT INNER DOOR. AT THIS POINT, 
THE MOB HAD ALREADY BROKEN INTO 

06:16:58.705 --> 06:17:01.456
THE SPEAKER'S FORMAL CONFERENCE 
ROOM THAT IS IN THE BACK OF THE 

06:17:01.687 --> 06:17:07.571
HALL AT THE TOP OF THE VIDEO. I 
WANT TO PLAY SOME AUDIO THAT WE 

06:17:07.815 --> 06:17:10.613
HAVE OF THE SPEAKER'S STAFF WITH
THE RIOTERS OF THE DOOR THAT 

06:17:10.844 --> 06:17:13.522
DAY. YOU CAN HEAR THE TERROR IN 
THEIR VOICE AS THEY DESCRIBE 

06:17:13.756 --> 06:17:17.703
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM. AS 
THEY ARE BARRICADED IN THE 

06:17:18.331 --> 06:17:21.997
CONFERENCE ROOM. PLEASE, LISTEN 
CAREFULLY. BECAUSE THE STAFFERS 

06:17:22.242 --> 06:17:28.344
WHISPERING INTO A PHONE AS HE 
HIDES FROM THE RIOTERS OUTSIDE 

06:17:29.088 --> 06:17:31.339
THE DOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:17:36.505 --> 06:17:41.738
WE NEED CAPITOL POLICE. THEY ARE
COMING DOWN THE HALL. THEY ARE 

06:17:41.972 --> 06:17:45.206
OPENING DOORS TRYING TO FIND 
HER. 

06:17:45.207 --> 06:17:50.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN HEAR THE POUNDING IN 
THE BACKGROUND AS THAT STAFFER 

06:17:51.312 --> 06:17:55.713
IS SPEAKING. ONE OF THOSE 
STAFFERS EXPLAINED LATER THAT 

06:17:55.941 --> 06:17:58.273
THEY COULD HEAR THE MOB GOING 
THROUGH HER OFFICES, BREAKING 

06:17:58.505 --> 06:18:04.247
DOWN THE DOOR AND YELLING, WHERE
ARE YOU, NANCY." THE MOB ALSO 

06:18:04.665 --> 06:18:06.665
PILLAGED AND VANDALIZED

06:18:09.476 --> 06:18:11.476
THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE AND 
DOCUMENTED THEIR CRIMES ON 

06:18:11.732 --> 06:18:15.894
SOCIAL MEDIA. THEY STOLE 
OBJECTS. DESECRATED THE OFFICE

06:18:19.510 --> 06:18:22.182
OF THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED 

06:18:22.419 --> 06:18:26.277
STATES. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THESE 
PHOTOS, RIOTERS BROKE DOWN A 

06:18:26.518 --> 06:18:28.855
DOOR. THEY ALSO SHATTERED A 
MIRROR.

06:18:33.082 --> 06:18:36.209
AT 2:50 P.M., SEVERAL RIOTERS 
INCLUDING RICHARD BARNETT 

06:18:36.626 --> 06:18:39.466
ENTERED SPEAKER PELOSI'S OFFICE.

06:18:43.900 --> 06:18:45.900
THE WORLD IS ALL

06:18:56.648 --> 06:18:59.502
, NOW, TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE 
IMAGES FROM THESE SLIDES. IF YOU

06:18:59.754 --> 06:19:01.969
LOOK CLOSELY, HOWEVER AT THE NOW
INFAMOUS PICTURES OF BARNETT 

06:19:02.212 --> 06:19:05.076
WITH HIS FEET ON THE DESK, YOU 
MIGHT SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU DID

06:19:05.323 --> 06:19:07.830
NOT NOTICE PREVIOUSLY. HERE IS A
BETTER LOOK. AS THIS PHOTO 

06:19:08.062 --> 06:19:10.198
HIGHLIGHTS, HE IS CARRYING A 
STUN GUN TUCKED INTO HIS 

06:19:10.436 --> 06:19:12.805
WAISTBAND. THE FBI IDENTIFIED 
THE DEVICE AS A 950,000 VOTE 

06:19:13.038 --> 06:19:15.038
VAULT

06:19:21.492 --> 06:19:23.701
STUN GUN WALKING STICK. THE 
WEAPON COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS

06:19:23.937 --> 06:19:25.937
PAIN AND INCAPACITATED ANYONE 
BARNETT HAD USED IT AGAINST. 

06:19:26.076 --> 06:19:28.462
RICHARD BARNETT BRAGGED ABOUT 
HIS ACTIONS. HE WAS PROUD OF THE

06:19:28.693 --> 06:19:31.327
WAY HE DESECRATED THE SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE'S OFFICE. HE LEFT A 

06:19:31.698 --> 06:19:38.616
NOTE. "WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN. 
BLOCK HERE IS BARNETT IN HIS OWN

06:19:38.848 --> 06:19:44.162
WORDS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW DO YOU GET IT? 

06:19:44.163 --> 06:19:47.709
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DIDN'T STEAL IT. I COULDN'T
SEE.

06:19:51.257 --> 06:19:54.907
SO I FIGURED, WELL, I'M IN HER 
OFFICE, I HAVE BLOOD IN HER 

06:19:55.154 --> 06:19:58.291
OFFICE, I PUT A QUARTER ON THE 
DESK EVEN THOUGH SHE WORK IT 

06:19:58.527 --> 06:20:03.059
WORTH IT AND I LEFT A NOTE ON 
HER DESK THAT SAYS NANCY, -- 

06:20:04.029 --> 06:20:06.029
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:20:08.265 --> 06:20:13.655
TRUMP'S MOB RANSACKED THE 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE'S OFFICE. 

06:20:14.404 --> 06:20:20.828
THEY TERRORIZED HER STAFF. 
AGAIN, THAT IS A MOB THAT WAS 

06:20:21.060 --> 06:20:25.821
SENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TO STOP THE 

06:20:26.056 --> 06:20:31.963
CERTIFICATION OF AN ELECTION. 
THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE SPEAKER 

06:20:32.204 --> 06:20:36.355
OF THE HOUSE, THE FIRST AND 
SECOND IN LINE TO THE 

06:20:36.586 --> 06:20:42.639
PRESIDENCY, WERE PERFORMING 
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES, 

06:20:42.877 --> 06:20:46.263
PRESIDING OVER THE ELECTION 
CERTIFICATION AND THEY WERE PUT 

06:20:46.930 --> 06:20:53.419
IN DANGER BECAUSE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP PUT HIS OWN DESIRES, HIS 

06:20:53.659 --> 06:21:01.817
OWN NEED FOR POWER OVER HIS DUTY
TO THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR 

06:21:02.542 --> 06:21:07.191
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP PUT A TARGET ON THEIR 

06:21:07.426 --> 06:21:12.682
BACKS AND HIS MOB BROKE INTO THE
CAPITAL TO HUNT THEM DOWN.

06:22:13.941 --> 06:22:15.941
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

06:22:23.313 --> 06:22:28.283
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY BREACHED THE CAPITOL. 
THEY HAVE BREACHED THE CAPITOL! 

06:22:28.699 --> 06:22:30.699
THEY ARE BEHIND THE LINES?

06:22:33.903 --> 06:22:36.187
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHORTLY AFTER 2:00 P.M., THE 
CAPITOL POLICE AND METROPOLITAN 

06:22:36.420 --> 06:22:40.388
POLICE WERE OVERWHELMED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOB. 

06:22:40.808 --> 06:22:46.344
PARAMETERS WERE BROKEN. THE 
CAPITOL HAD BEEN BREACHED.

06:22:56.329 --> 06:22:58.713
THOSE OFFICERS KEPT FIGHTING 
BACK FOR HOURS AND HOURS TO HOLD

06:22:58.949 --> 06:23:01.558
THE LINE. THEY FOUGHT TO DEFEND 
THE CAPITOL BUILDING AND ALL OF 

06:23:01.789 --> 06:23:06.100
US WITHIN IT. BUT THEY WEREN'T 
THERE JUST TO PROTECT US. AND 

06:23:06.624 --> 06:23:13.185
THEY DID, AND OUR STAFF AND THE 
CUSTODIAL STAFF AND ALL THE 

06:23:13.419 --> 06:23:16.157
PEOPLE WHO WORK SO HARD IN THIS 
BUILDING. THEY WERE THERE TO 

06:23:16.387 --> 06:23:19.774
PROTECT THE VOTES OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING 

06:23:20.007 --> 06:23:22.699
COUNTED THAT DAY. I WILL SHOW 
YOU MORE LATER ABOUT WHAT THAT 

06:23:22.933 --> 06:23:27.557
DAY WAS LIKE FOR THOSE BRAVE 
OFFICERS. BUT FIRST, LET'S GO 

06:23:27.789 --> 06:23:32.662
BACK TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHERE
MANAGER PLASKETT LEFT OFF IN THE

06:23:33.285 --> 06:23:35.285
HOUSE 

06:23:39.406 --> 06:23:41.543
CHAMBER. RIOTERS WHO HAD ENTERED
THE BUILDING THROUGH THE SENATE 

06:23:41.773 --> 06:23:43.927
QUICKLY SPREAD OUT THROUGH THE 
CAPITOL, MANY HEADED TOWARD THE 

06:23:44.162 --> 06:23:46.162
HOUSE AND CHAMBERS. AFTER 
SPEAKER PELOSI WAS USHERED OUT, 

06:23:46.277 --> 06:23:48.795
CHAIRMAN McGOVERN WAS PRESIDING 
IN THE HOUSE. ATTEMPTING TO KEEP

06:23:49.028 --> 06:23:53.334
THE COUNTY PROCESS GOING. ON OUR
PHONES, MEMBERS WERE RECEIVING 

06:23:54.048 --> 06:23:59.098
SECURITY UPDATES AND WATCHING 
SOCIAL MEDIA TO SEE THE HORROR 

06:23:59.336 --> 06:24:02.593
THAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE. WE 
NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE ITS 

06:24:03.169 --> 06:24:08.962
WAY IN. BY 2:20 5 PM, RIOTERS 
WHO WERE ALREADY IN THE BUILDING

06:24:09.207 --> 06:24:14.451
OPENED THE SIDE DOOR TO THE 
CAPITOL ROTUNDA TO LET MORE OF 

06:24:14.692 --> 06:24:16.895
THE MOB IN. THEY QUICKLY FLOODED
THROUGH THE DOORS, OVERWHELMING 

06:24:17.127 --> 06:24:24.425
OFFICERS. THIS IS NEW SECURITY 
FOOTAGE OF THOSE DOORS AND, AS 

06:24:24.662 --> 06:24:29.371
BEFORE, THE MOB IS IDENTIFIED 
WITH THE RED DOT ON THE MODEL OF

06:24:29.611 --> 06:24:32.118
THE CAPITOL. IF YOU LOOK 
CLOSELY, YOU WILL SEE THE FIRST 

06:24:32.351 --> 06:24:34.481
PERSON THROUGH THE DOOR THAT IS 
HOLDING THE TRUMP FLAG. 

06:25:18.785 --> 06:25:20.785
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:25:24.848 --> 06:25:27.502
AT THE SAME TIME, JUST ONE FLOOR
BELOW, THE MOB VIOLENTLY PUSHED 

06:25:27.734 --> 06:25:30.269
THROUGH A LINE OF CAPITOL POLICE
OFFICERS AND OVERTOOK THE AREA. 

06:25:30.501 --> 06:25:33.563
WE ALL KNOW THAT AREA IN THE 
CAPITAL AS THE CRYPT. THIS IS 

06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:36.149
DIRECTLY BENEATH THE ROTUNDA AT 
THE CENTER OF THE CAPITAL. 

06:25:36.378 --> 06:25:42.072
CAPITOL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

06:25:59.410 --> 06:26:02.039
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; INSIDE THE HOUSE CHAMBER, A 
SECURITY OFFICER

06:26:06.832 --> 06:26:09.378
SUSPENDED THE FLOOR DEBATE TO 
UPDATE MEMBERS. 

06:26:09.379 --> 06:26:12.330
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE -- IN THE ROTUNDA. 
PLEASE

06:26:17.098 --> 06:26:20.439

06:26:29.707 --> 06:26:32.586
GAS MASKS UNDERNEATH OUR SEATS 
AND BE PREPARED TO GRAB THEM. 

06:26:32.825 --> 06:26:34.825
DETERMINED TO KEEP THE

06:26:40.502 --> 06:26:42.539
COUNT GOING, CHAIRMAN McGOVERN 
CALLED THE HOUSE BACK INTO 

06:26:42.773 --> 06:26:45.132
SESSION BUT ONLY FOUR MINUTES 
LATER, AT 2:30 P.M., THE HOUSE 

06:26:45.369 --> 06:26:47.369
ABRUPTLY RECESSED. A NEW 
SECURITY AMOUNT SPENT WAS MADE.

06:26:51.637 --> 06:26:53.762
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GET DOWN UNDER YOUR CHAIRS IF

06:27:04.235 --> 06:27:07.131
SO WE HAVE FOLKS ENTERING THE 
ROTUNDA AND COMING DOWN THIS WAY

06:27:07.387 --> 06:27:10.702
SO WE WILL UPDATE YOU AS SOON AS
WE CAN BUT BE PREPARED. STAY 

06:27:10.952 --> 06:27:12.952
CALM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS A HEARD THAT ANNOUNCEMENT 

06:27:13.169 --> 06:27:16.873
ON THE FLOOR I SAW THE NEW HOUSE
CHAPLAIN ON JUST HER FOURTH J 

06:27:17.107 --> 06:27:19.519
DAY ON THE JOB WALK TO THE 
PODIUM, UNANNOUNCED AND AMIDST 

06:27:19.753 --> 06:27:22.716
THE CHAOS, SHE STARTED TO RECITE
A PRAYER FOR PEACE. UNCERTAIN 

06:27:22.960 --> 06:27:27.688
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT, I SENT A
TEXT MESSAGE TO MY WIFE.

06:27:33.515 --> 06:27:38.485
"I LOVE YOU AND THE BABIES. 
PLEASE, HUG THEM FOR ME." I 

06:27:38.716 --> 06:27:40.725
IMAGINE MANY OF YOU SENT A 
SIMILAR MESSAGE.

06:27:46.617 --> 06:27:48.981
WHAT WE COULD NOT SEE FROM 
INSIDE THE CHAMBER WAS THAT 

06:27:49.218 --> 06:27:51.218
OUTSIDE, THE MOB WAS GROWING 
LARGER AND LARGER. AND 

06:27:51.345 --> 06:27:53.438
APPROACHING OUR DOORS. BUT WE 
COULD HEAR THEM. THIS SECURITY 

06:27:53.670 --> 06:27:55.670
FOOTAGE WAS NOT MADE WITH

06:28:03.209 --> 06:28:05.820
SOUND. IT SHOWS A MOB MOVING 
TOWARD THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE 

06:28:06.053 --> 06:28:08.053
HOUSE CHAMBER TO STOP THE 
COUNTING OF VOTES. 

06:28:27.341 --> 06:28:31.526
IN THE BACK OF THE GROUP, YOU 
SEE ONE INDIVIDUAL CARRYING A 

06:28:32.478 --> 06:28:38.337
SIGN. THEY GET WITHIN FOOTSTEPS 
OF THE HOUSE DOOR. THE NEXT 

06:28:38.575 --> 06:28:42.125
VIDEO IS THE VIEWPOINT OF THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS. IT BEGINS WITH

06:28:42.371 --> 06:28:47.054
THE MOB  AMASSING AND CUT TO 
HEAD TO SHOW YOU THEIR SEARCH TO

06:28:47.284 --> 06:28:51.103
THE HOUSE DOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP!

06:28:53.021 --> 06:28:56.910
WE WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP! WE
WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP! WE 

06:28:57.667 --> 06:29:04.846
WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP! WE 
WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP! WE 

06:29:05.556 --> 06:29:12.484
WANT TRUMP! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I TOLD YOU THAT -- I WOULD 

06:29:12.713 --> 06:29:14.713
JUST STOP --

06:29:19.057 --> 06:29:21.709
DUDE, DUDE, DUDE, YOU ARE NOT 
HELPING, YOU'RE NOT HELPING. --

06:29:26.793 --> 06:29:29.292
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. 

06:29:29.293 --> 06:29:35.544
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- IT IS TOO LATE FOR THAT. 
THEY DON'T LISTEN WITHOUT THIS.

06:29:38.653 --> 06:29:40.653
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

06:29:45.702 --> 06:29:51.592
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THOSE DOORS TO ORIENT YOU AT 
HOME ARE THE DOORS OF THE

06:29:57.613 --> 06:30:00.227
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
THAT HE WALKS THROUGH WHEN HE OR

06:30:00.456 --> 06:30:03.291
SHE GIVES A STATE OF THE UNION 
ADDRESS. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ONE 

06:30:03.522 --> 06:30:05.622
MAN YELL, "NO VIOLENCE!" AND 
ANOTHER RESPONDED, IT IS TOO 

06:30:05.859 --> 06:30:07.915
LATE FOR THAT. THEY DON'T LISTEN
WITHOUT THAT."

06:30:13.938 --> 06:30:16.122
THEY WERE THERE TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION. 

06:30:16.352 --> 06:30:19.142
AT THIS POINT, INSIDE THE HOUSE 
CHAMBER, WE CAN NOW HEAR THE 

06:30:19.380 --> 06:30:22.454
POUNDING ON THE DOORS. AT 2:30 5
PM, MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE FLOOR 

06:30:22.685 --> 06:30:24.685
WORK TOLD AN EVACUATION WAS

06:30:34.671 --> 06:30:37.002
SECURED AND IT WAS TIME TO 
LEAVE. THIS VIDEO SHOWS MEMBERS 

06:30:37.246 --> 06:30:40.133
OF CONGRESS EXIT INTO THE SIDES 
OF THE PODIUM WHERE WE WOULD GO 

06:30:40.370 --> 06:30:42.240
THROUGH THE HOUSE LOBBY AND DOWN
THE STAIRS. 

06:30:42.241 --> 06:30:44.241
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

06:30:49.931 --> 06:30:51.713
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS 
RESTRICTIONS, CONGRESSIONAL 

06:30:51.714 --> 06:30:54.227
MEMBERS HAD BEEN WAITING IN THE 
GALLERY TO SPEAK

06:30:57.810 --> 06:30:59.810
JUST ONE FLOOR ABOVE THE HOUSE 
FLOOR. REPRESENTATIVES, STAFF, 

06:31:00.113 --> 06:31:02.113
JOURNALISTS TO COVER

06:31:04.246 --> 06:31:06.979
UNDER THEIR CHAIRS, HELPED EACH 
OTHER PUT ON GAS MASKS AND HELD 

06:31:07.215 --> 06:31:09.215
HANDS AS RIOTERS GATHERED 
OUTSIDE.

06:31:12.448 --> 06:31:17.730
HERE YOU SEE REPRESENTATIVE CROW
COMFORTING REPRESENTATIVE WILEY.

06:31:19.442 --> 06:31:22.094
THE RIOTERS CONTINUED TO 
SURROUND THE HOUSE CHANGER, 

06:31:22.498 --> 06:31:29.350
FLOODING HALLS AND KICKING ON 
DOORS AS THEY PASSED THEM. THIS 

06:31:29.583 --> 06:31:33.142
SECURITY VIDEO SHOWS ASHLI 
BABBITT FOLLOWED BY OTHERS IN 

06:31:33.607 --> 06:31:36.240
THE MOB TURNING THE CORNER 
TOWARD THE HOUSE LOBBY DOORS 

06:31:36.471 --> 06:31:38.471
WHERE THE MEMBERS WERE LEAVING.

06:32:21.404 --> 06:32:24.122
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHAIRMAN McGOVERN WAS ONE OF 
THE LAST MEMBERS TO LEAVE THE 

06:32:24.367 --> 06:32:28.700
FLOOR. HAS HE LEFT FOR THE HOUSE
LOBBY JUST AFTER 2:40 P.M., HE 

06:32:28.935 --> 06:32:30.935
WAS SPOTTED BY THE MOB. 

06:32:35.799 --> 06:32:37.799
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

06:32:41.191 --> 06:32:43.191
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

06:33:03.212 --> 06:33:05.978
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MINUTES LATER AT 2:40 4 PM, 
ASHLI BABBITT ATTEMPTED TO CLIMB

06:33:06.212 --> 06:33:08.552
THROUGH A SHATTERED WINDOW INTO 
THE HOUSE LOBBY. TO PROTECT THE 

06:33:08.782 --> 06:33:12.683
MEMBERS IN THE LOBBY, AN OFFICER
DISCHARGED HIS WEAPON. SHE WAS 

06:33:12.916 --> 06:33:17.598
KILLED. I WANT TO WARN EVERYONE 
THAT THE NEXT VIDEO WHICH SHOWS 

06:33:17.832 --> 06:33:20.105
HER DEATH IS GRAPHIC. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

06:33:25.982 --> 06:33:29.041
THERE IS A GUN! THERE IS A GUN! 
THERE IS A GUN! 

06:33:29.042 --> 06:33:31.042
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 

06:33:38.859 --> 06:33:40.859
OH! NO! 

06:33:44.153 --> 06:33:46.153
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:33:53.370 --> 06:33:57.436
INSIDE THE CHAMBER, 
REPRESENTATIVES, STAFF AND 

06:33:57.700 --> 06:34:02.188
JOURNALISTS REMAINED TRAPPED IN 
THE GALLERY. ONE FLOOR ABOVE THE

06:34:02.856 --> 06:34:04.977
HOUSE FLOOR, THEY HEARD THE 
GUNSHOT MY COLLEAGUE,

06:34:08.550 --> 06:34:11.565
REPRESENTATIVE DAN KILDEE 
PRODUCED THIS REPORTING. 

06:34:11.566 --> 06:34:14.071
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. --

06:34:17.826 --> 06:34:20.503
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TAKE YOUR PINS OFF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PINS OFF. 

06:34:20.504 --> 06:34:22.507
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUT OF FEAR THEY WOULD BE 
SEEN

06:34:29.555 --> 06:34:31.812
OR TAKEN BY THE MOB, MY 
COLLEAGUES WERE TELLING EACH 

06:34:32.049 --> 06:34:34.049
OTHER TO TAKE OFF THEIR 
CONGRESSIONAL PINS. THE BUZZING 

06:34:34.148 --> 06:34:37.241
SOUND YOU HEAR IN THE BACKGROUND
OF THE VIDEOS WAS THE SOUND OF 

06:34:37.495 --> 06:34:39.871
THE GAS MASKS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 
APPROXIMATELY 2:50 P.M. ABOUT 

06:34:40.100 --> 06:34:44.255
SIX MINUTES AFTER THE SHOOTING, 
DOWNSTAIRS, REMAINING MEMBERS OF

06:34:44.493 --> 06:34:46.922
THE STAFF AND JOURNALISTS IN THE
GALLERY WERE FINALLY ABLE TO 

06:34:47.153 --> 06:34:49.153
FLEE. 

06:34:52.318 --> 06:34:54.865
IN THIS SECURITY FOOTAGE VIDEO, 
YOU CAN SEE THEM EXITING. MANY 

06:34:55.096 --> 06:34:58.820
MEMBERS ARE STILL WEARING THEIR 
GAS MASKS. THEY WALKED JUST FEET

06:34:59.052 --> 06:35:03.773
AWAY FROM WORK CAPITOL POLICE 
ARE HOLDING AN INSURRECTIONIST 

06:35:04.280 --> 06:35:07.442
AT GUNPOINT. JUST MINUTES 
EARLIER, THAT INSURRECTIONIST 

06:35:07.845 --> 06:35:11.722
HAD TRIED TO OPEN THE GALLERY 
DOOR AND THANKFULLY, WAS STOPPED

06:35:12.376 --> 06:35:14.376
BY A TACTICAL TEAM.

06:35:54.422 --> 06:35:56.677
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALTHOUGH MEMBERS WERE BEING 
MOVED TO ANOTHER LOCATION, THE 

06:35:56.909 --> 06:35:59.462
MOB CONTINUED TO FIGHT TO STOP 
THE COUNT, TO FIND THE MEMBERS, 

06:35:59.702 --> 06:36:02.055
TO ENGAGE WITH THE POLICE. THE 
BUILDING WAS NOT YET SECURED. 

06:36:02.288 --> 06:36:07.382
THIS SECURITY VIDEO FROM 2:50 6 
PM SHOWS THE MOB IN THE HOUSE OF

06:36:07.616 --> 06:36:09.616
REPRESENTATIVES WING ON THE 
SECOND FLOOR

06:36:13.099 --> 06:36:14.770
OF THE CAPITAL. 
INSURRECTIONIST'S STILL INSIDE 

06:36:14.771 --> 06:36:17.028
THE BUILDING ARE FIGHTING WITH 
POLICE OVERWHELMED AND TRYING TO

06:36:17.258 --> 06:36:19.258
GET THEM OUT. 

06:36:30.688 --> 06:36:34.378
THROUGHOUT THIS PRESENTATION WE 
HAVE BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO SHARE 

06:36:34.780 --> 06:36:37.154
WHERE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WERE 
TAKEN ON THE PATHS THEY FOLLOWED

06:36:37.394 --> 06:36:41.913
TO GET OUT AND OFF THE FLOORS. 
BUT THAT VERY ISSUE WAS UNDER 

06:36:42.145 --> 06:36:45.342
DISCUSSION BY THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS THEMSELVES.  

06:36:45.745 --> 06:36:47.745
ONE EXAMPLE COMES FROM AN FBI 
AFFIDAVIT

06:36:51.124 --> 06:36:53.857
WHICH STATED THAT A LEADER OF 
THE MILITIA GROUP KNOWN AS THE 

06:36:54.088 --> 06:36:56.188
OATH KEEPERS RECEIVED MESSAGES 
WHILE HE WAS AT THE CAPITAL 

06:36:56.424 --> 06:37:00.030
CHICK CAPITOL. THEY WERE GIVEN 
DIRECTIONS AS TO WHERE THEY 

06:37:00.263 --> 06:37:02.748
THOUGHT MEMBERS WOULD BE 
SHELTERING AND INSTRUCTIONS TO 

06:37:03.000 --> 06:37:06.672
"TURN ON GAS. STILL THEM AND."

06:37:12.134 --> 06:37:15.251
AS YOU KNOW THE THREAT TO THE 
SENATE WAS NO LESS THAN THAT OF 

06:37:15.481 --> 06:37:17.481
THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE. THE 
MOB APPROACHED

06:37:24.005 --> 06:37:25.879
THE SENATE WITH THE SAME 
PURPOSE, FULFILLING PRESIDENT 

06:37:25.880 --> 06:37:27.797
TRUMP'S GOAL OF STOPPING THE 
COUNT, DELAYING THE 

06:37:27.798 --> 06:37:29.798
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE VOTES OF THE AMERICAN 

06:37:29.888 --> 06:37:33.691
PEOPLE. AS YOU HEARD FROM 
MANAGER PLASKETT, VICE PRESIDENT

06:37:39.146 --> 06:37:41.721
PANTS WAS MOVED AWAY FROM THE 
CHAMBER AROUND 2:20 5 PM. BY 

06:37:41.952 --> 06:37:45.490
THAT TIME, RIOTERS HAD BREACHED 
SEVERAL AREAS CLOSE TO THIS 

06:37:45.725 --> 06:37:47.725
CHAMBER AND WORK FLOODING THE 
HALLWAYS JUST OUTSIDE NEARBY. 

06:37:47.861 --> 06:37:50.724
THE SENATE CHANGER WAS NOT 
CHAMBER WAS NOT EVACUATED

06:37:59.262 --> 06:38:02.000
. THE MOB HAD BEEN IN THE 
BUILDING FOR NEARLY 15 MINUTES. 

06:38:02.232 --> 06:38:04.588
THIS NEW SECURITY FOOTAGE OF THE
SENATORS AND STAFF LEAVING THE 

06:38:04.819 --> 06:38:09.268
CHAMBER WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE
SCREENS. IT IS SILENT. 

06:38:36.134 --> 06:38:38.599
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CANNOT SEE IT IN THIS 
FOOTAGE BUT QUICK THINKING 

06:38:38.832 --> 06:38:44.411
SENATE FLOOR STAFF GRABBED AND 
PROTECTED THE ELECTORAL BALLOTS 

06:38:44.829 --> 06:38:46.829
THAT THE MOB WAS AFTER.

06:38:51.423 --> 06:38:53.897
THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE HERE THAT 
THEY WILL RECALL

06:38:58.653 --> 06:39:00.966
THAT ONCE YOU LEFT THE SENATE 
FLOOR, YOU MOVED THROUGH A 

06:39:01.201 --> 06:39:04.132
HALLWAY TO GET TO SAFETY. THAT 
HALLWAY WAS NEAR WHERE OFFICER 

06:39:04.370 --> 06:39:06.696
GOODMAN HAD ENCOUNTERED A MOB 
AND LED THEM UPSTAIRS AWAY FROM 

06:39:06.932 --> 06:39:11.863
THE SENATE CHAMBER. YOU KNOW HOW
CLOSE YOU CAME TO THE MOB. SOME 

06:39:12.098 --> 06:39:14.686
OF YOU I UNDERSTAND COULD HEAR 
THEM. BUT MOST OF THE PUBLIC 

06:39:14.919 --> 06:39:18.549
DOES NOT KNOW HOW CLOSE THESE 
RIOTERS CAME TO YOU.

06:39:24.597 --> 06:39:30.038
AS YOU WERE MOVING THROUGH THAT 
HALLWAY, I PASTE IT OFF. YOU 

06:39:30.742 --> 06:39:36.441
WERE JUST 58 STEPS AWAY FROM 
WHERE THE MOB WAS AMASSING AND 

06:39:36.674 --> 06:39:41.336
WHERE POLICE WERE RUSHING TO 
STOP THEM. THEY WERE YELLING.

06:39:45.172 --> 06:39:47.830
IN THIS SECURITY VIDEO, YOU CAN 
SEE HOW THE CAPITOL POLICE

06:39:51.862 --> 06:39:54.210
CREATED A LINE AND BLOCKED THE 
HALLWAY WITH THEIR BODIES TO 

06:39:54.440 --> 06:39:57.194
PREVENT RIOTERS AT THE END OF 
THE HALL FROM REACHING YOU AND 

06:39:57.427 --> 06:39:59.427
YOUR STAFF.

06:40:54.403 --> 06:40:56.880
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BECAUSE THIS IS SECURITY 
FOOTAGE YOU HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE,

06:40:57.116 --> 06:41:01.670
I WANT TO PLAYED AGAIN. I WANTED
TO PLAY IT AGAIN.

06:41:07.490 --> 06:41:10.550
AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AT THE 
OTHER END OF THE HALLWAY WHERE 

06:41:10.785 --> 06:41:12.887
THE MOB IS AMASSED AND THE 
SECURITY OFFICER RUSHING TO 

06:41:13.122 --> 06:41:15.122
PROTECT YOU. 

06:41:51.898 --> 06:41:53.898
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ADDITIONAL SECURITY

06:42:02.878 --> 06:42:04.878
FOOTAGE HOLD SHOWS HOW 
LEADERSHIP ARE AND THE MEMBERS 

06:42:04.980 --> 06:42:07.557
OF THE PROTECTIVE DETAIL HAD A 
NEAR MISS WITH THE MOB. THEY 

06:42:07.791 --> 06:42:10.645
CAME WITHIN YARDS OF RIOTERS AND
HAD TO TURN AROUND. HERE IN THIS

06:42:10.878 --> 06:42:14.819
NEW VIDEO YOU SEE LEADER SHURMUR
WALKING UP A RAMP. CHUCK SCHUMER

06:42:15.051 --> 06:42:18.487
WALKING UP A RAMP, GOING UP THE 
RAMP WITH THE DETAIL AND WILL 

06:42:18.716 --> 06:42:20.716
SOON GO OUT OF VIEW.

06:42:40.311 --> 06:42:42.824
SECONDS LATER THE RETURN AND RUN
BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY AND 

06:42:43.057 --> 06:42:45.178
OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE 
DOOR AND USE THEIR BODIES TO 

06:42:45.445 --> 06:42:47.805
KEEP THEM SAFE. AT 2:45 P.M., 
SHORTLY AFTER BEING USHERED FROM

06:42:48.050 --> 06:42:50.050
THE SENATE FLOOR,

06:42:54.581 --> 06:42:56.227
INSURRECTIONISTS REACHED THIS 
SENATE GALLERY. THE FOLLOWING 

06:42:56.228 --> 06:42:58.371
VIDEO WAS FILMED BY A NEW YORK 
REPORTER.  

06:42:58.372 --> 06:43:00.372
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE HERE!

06:43:06.985 --> 06:43:11.814

06:43:11.815 --> 06:43:14.288
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MINUTES LATER, HE 
INSURRECTIONISTS INVADED  AND 

06:43:14.520 --> 06:43:20.286
DESECRATED THE SENATE FLOOR. 
THESE VANDALS SHOUTED AND RIFLED

06:43:20.528 --> 06:43:23.714
THROUGH THE DESKS IN THIS ROOM. 
THEY TOOK PICTURES OF DOCUMENTS

06:43:28.765 --> 06:43:30.876
AND OF THEMSELVES, CELEBRATING 
THAT THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE 

06:43:31.112 --> 06:43:33.276
FLOOR AND STOPPED THE COUNTING 
OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. 

06:43:33.277 --> 06:43:36.776
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LOOK AT THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; --

06:43:40.581 --> 06:43:43.433
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GET A SNAP OF THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. 

06:43:43.434 --> 06:43:51.027
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEY, HOW DO I GET DOWN THERE?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GO DOWN THE STAIRS. 

06:43:51.028 --> 06:43:54.620
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HERE, LOOK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TED CRUZ'S OBJECTION. 

06:43:54.621 --> 06:43:59.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LOOK, OBJECTION TO COUNTING 
THE VOTES OF 

06:44:01.235 --> 06:44:03.576
ARIZONA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE KNOW THAT IS -- 

06:44:03.577 --> 06:44:07.846
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING 

06:44:08.506 --> 06:44:10.506
IN HERE. SCUMBAGS.

06:44:14.222 --> 06:44:16.893
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO FOLD, 
MAN! 

06:44:16.894 --> 06:44:23.527
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH THIS IS GOOD STUFF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO FOLD! 

06:44:23.760 --> 06:44:29.539
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LARRY BROCK WHO WAS ARRESTED 
FOR HIS ROLE IN THE INSURRECTION

06:44:29.996 --> 06:44:33.597
WAS PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR WEARING A HELMET, TACTICAL

06:44:33.829 --> 06:44:41.181
GEAR AND CARRYING FLEX CUFFS. 
THIS MAN ALSO

06:44:43.835 --> 06:44:45.835
GALLERY IS

06:44:48.480 --> 06:44:51.213
ERIC MONTEL. LIKE BROCK, HE WAS 
DRESSED IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE 

06:44:51.458 --> 06:44:57.051
TACTICAL GEAR, ALSO HOLDING UP 
FLEX CUFFS. IF THE DOORS TO THIS

06:44:57.290 --> 06:45:01.938
CHAMBER HAD BEEN BREACHED JUST 
MINUTES EARLIER, IMAGINE WHAT 

06:45:02.170 --> 06:45:10.651
THEY COULD HAVE DONE WITH THOSE 
CUFFS. AFTER INSURRECTIONISTS 

06:45:10.892 --> 06:45:16.525
OCCUPIED THE CAPITAL AND STOPPED
THE JOINT SESSION FROM COUNTING 

06:45:16.771 --> 06:45:19.124
THE VOTES, THE CAPITAL WAS IN 
LOCKDOWN FOR FIVE HOURS.

06:45:27.888 --> 06:45:31.536
AS LONG AS IT TOOK TO GET BACK 
TO THE CAPITAL -- CAPITOL, TO 

06:45:31.772 --> 06:45:33.772
GET BACK TO THE

06:45:37.594 --> 06:45:43.317
INSURRECTION, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EVEN LONGER BUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE 

06:45:43.547 --> 06:45:48.222
BEEN EVEN LONGER. 140 OFFICERS 
INJURED, THREE OFFICERS 

06:45:48.871 --> 06:45:52.898
ULTIMATELY LOST THEIR LIVES. WE 
ALL KNOW THAT AWFUL DAY COULD 

06:45:53.136 --> 06:45:56.067
HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE. THE 
ONLY REASON IT WAS NOT WAS 

06:45:56.316 --> 06:45:59.410
BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY 
BRAVERY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 

06:45:59.652 --> 06:46:03.355
THE CAPITOL POLICE AND 
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENTS.

06:46:04.444 --> 06:46:08.740
FOR HOURS AND HOURS, THESE 
INSURRECTIONIST WERE IN

06:46:11.503 --> 06:46:14.304
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH THESE 
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN. LIKE SOME 

06:46:14.990 --> 06:46:19.960
OF YOU, I COME FROM A LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FAMILY. MY DAD WAS A

06:46:20.199 --> 06:46:26.399
COP. MY TWO BROTHERS, MY LITTLE 
BROTHERS ARE COPS WHO WALK THE 

06:46:26.634 --> 06:46:28.666
BEAT TODAY. I'M PROUD OF THEM. 
AND LIKE

06:46:32.857 --> 06:46:35.816
IN EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT FAMILY,
WHEN WE HANG UP THE PHONE, WE 

06:46:36.052 --> 06:46:41.959
DON'T ONLY SAY I LOVE YOU. WE 
SAY, "BE SAFE." SO LET'S FOCUS 

06:46:42.192 --> 06:46:46.228
NOW ON THE ATTACK AND WHAT IT 
WAS LIKE FOR THE OFFICERS 

06:46:46.458 --> 06:46:50.255
DEFENDING THE CAPITAL THAT THEY.
AGAIN I WANT TO WARN YOU THAT 

06:46:50.487 --> 06:46:52.575
THE FOLLOWING AUDIO AND VIDEOS 
ARE GRAPHIC AND ARE UNSETTLING. 

06:46:52.805 --> 06:46:57.253
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE 
UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF WHAT 

06:46:57.489 --> 06:46:59.489
OCCURRED.

06:47:03.130 --> 06:47:05.729

HOW THE SPRAYS THAT WERE 
DESCRIBED ARE USED AGAINST 

06:47:57.705 --> 06:48:03.694
OFFICERS.

06:48:03.695 --> 06:48:07.065

OVERTAKEN THE POLICE LINE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:48:22.707 --> 06:48:25.969
WE HAVE LOST THE LINE. WE LOST 
THE LINE! WE ALL NEED TO PULL 

06:48:26.201 --> 06:48:33.630

06:49:04.056 --> 06:49:06.407

MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE 
HAD LEFT THIS AREA, ON THE WEST 

06:49:10.456 --> 06:49:14.417
FRONT OF THE BUILDING, THE MOB 
CONTINUED TO GROW, CONTINUED TO 

06:49:14.649 --> 06:49:20.879
BEAT THE OFFICERS AS THEY TRIED 
TO GET IN. IN THIS NEW SECURITY 

06:49:21.120 --> 06:49:23.353

ATTACKING OFFICERS WITH A 

06:49:23.585 --> 06:49:27.791
CRUTCH, A HOCKEY STICK, A 
BULLHORN AND A TRUMP FLAG. 

06:49:57.515 --> 06:49:59.515
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT 
SEMATECH

06:50:02.943 --> 06:50:05.188
FROM THE OFFICERS' PERSPECTIVE 
FROM HIS BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE.

06:50:31.343 --> 06:50:35.908
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE IS 

06:50:36.305 --> 06:50:38.305

06:50:42.026 --> 06:50:44.388
P.M. OVER TWO HOURS FROM WHEN 
THE CAPITAL WAS FIRST BREACHED. 

06:50:44.619 --> 06:50:47.613
THE ATTACK ON POLICE THAT 
AFTERNOON WAS CONSTANT. 

06:50:48.576 --> 06:50:51.075
METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFERS,

06:51:01.098 --> 06:51:03.438
MICHAEL PHENOM, A 20 YEAR POLICE
OFFICER WITH FOUR DAUGHTERS WAS 

06:51:03.667 --> 06:51:06.021
PART OF A LINE OF OFFICERS 
PROTECTING THE CAPITAL. HE WAS 

06:51:06.255 --> 06:51:08.600
ONE OF THREE OFFICERS THAT THE 
MOB DRAGGED DOWN THE STAIRS. 

06:51:08.843 --> 06:51:11.303
WHEN THEY DRAGGED HIM, THEY 
STOLE HIS BADGE, HIS RADIO, HIS 

06:51:11.536 --> 06:51:13.656
AMMUNITION MAGAZINE, AND THEY 
TASED HIM. IT TRIGGERED A HEART 

06:51:13.887 --> 06:51:18.773
ATTACK. HERE HE DESCRIBES HIS 
EXPERIENCE. 

06:51:18.774 --> 06:51:21.389
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LOOKED LIKE A MEDIEVAL BATTLE
SCENE. SOME OF THOSE BRUTAL 

06:51:21.756 --> 06:51:27.368
COMBAT THAT I HAVE EVER 
ENCOUNTERED. AT ONE POINT I GOT 

06:51:27.599 --> 06:51:32.961
TASED. PEOPLE YELLING OUT, WE 
GOT ONE! WE GOT ONE. 

06:51:32.962 --> 06:51:38.396

REGULARLY SERVES IN MPD

06:51:45.244 --> 06:51:47.244

FRONT CAPITOL ENTRANCE. HERE IS 
HER EXPERIENCE. 

06:51:48.968 --> 06:51:50.968
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:51:53.788 --> 06:51:56.478
I MEAN I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT 
THE OFFICERS THAT WERE THERE. 

06:51:56.715 --> 06:51:59.506
THE OFFICERS THAT WERE ON THE 
FRONT LINE. AND WHEN I SAY THE 

06:51:59.746 --> 06:52:01.831
FRONTLINE I MEAN LITERALLY 
OFFICERS THAT WERE IN A LINE 

06:52:02.071 --> 06:52:04.248
STOPPING THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
BEATING THEM WITH METAL POLES, 

06:52:04.488 --> 06:52:08.678
SPRAYING THEM WITH BEAR MACE, 
THEY DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR 

06:52:08.910 --> 06:52:12.028
POWER TO NOT LET THOSE PEOPLE IN
AND THIS WAS GOING ON FOR HOURS.

06:52:12.277 --> 06:52:14.277
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AROUND 4:

06:52:20.526 --> 06:52:23.000
30 P.M., HOURS INTO THE CAPITAL 
RIOTS, OFFICER DANIEL HODGES WAS

06:52:23.245 --> 06:52:25.245
PROTECTING A WESTSIDE CAPITOL 
ENTRANCE WHEN RIOTERS WHO ARE 

06:52:25.369 --> 06:52:28.921
TRYING TO STOP THE CERTIFICATION
TRAPPED HIM BETWEEN TWO DOORS. 

06:52:29.150 --> 06:52:31.161
WHEN OFFICER HODGES WAS 
INTERVIEWED LATER, THIS WAS HOW 

06:52:31.402 --> 06:52:35.225
HE DESCRIBED WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY THREW DOWN A HUGE METAL 

06:52:35.655 --> 06:52:38.491
OBJECT THAT HIT ME IN THE HEAD. 
I WAS ALSO KNOCKED DOWN

06:52:42.477 --> 06:52:45.316
THE MEDICAL MASK I WAS WEARING 
OVER THE TIME GOT PULLED UP OVER

06:52:45.550 --> 06:52:48.424
MY EYES SO I WAS ON THE GROUND 
AND BLINDED AND THEY STARTED 

06:52:48.655 --> 06:52:50.655
ATTACKING ME FROM ALL SIDES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIOTERS CRUSHED OFFICER 

06:52:50.763 --> 06:52:52.763
HODGES.

06:52:55.205 --> 06:52:57.578
HE WAS WEDGED IN THE DOORWAY. 
BLOOD WAS DRIPPING FROM HIS 

06:52:57.809 --> 06:52:59.809
MOUTH. HE STRUGGLED TO BREATHE. 
ALL WHILE THE INSURRECTIONISTS 

06:52:59.928 --> 06:53:01.928
HIT HIM. 

06:53:03.609 --> 06:53:05.860
OFFICER HODGES' EXPERIENCE 
REMINDS YOU OF WHAT HE AND MANY 

06:53:06.097 --> 06:53:09.385
OTHER OFFICERS EXPERIENCE THAT 
THEY. WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH.

06:53:14.370 --> 06:53:16.833

ALL WE CAN IN THIS CHAMBER TO 
MAKE SURE THAT NEVER HAPPENS 

06:54:12.401 --> 06:54:14.401
AGAIN.

06:55:00.034 --> 06:55:02.034

06:56:00.125 --> 06:56:02.238
VIOLATING HIS OATH OF OFFICE AND
ENDANGERING OUR COUNTRY, OUR 

06:56:02.476 --> 06:56:04.476
DEMOCRACY, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
AND HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT. 

06:56:04.573 --> 06:56:06.573
LET'S GO TO JANE'S HOME AND

06:56:12.334 --> 06:56:14.471
JAMES HOLMAN. I KNOW THIS WAS 
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR OUR 

06:56:14.704 --> 06:56:17.024
AUDIENCE TO WATCH BUT I WANT TO 
THANK EVERYONE FOR STICKING 

06:56:17.256 --> 06:56:19.362
THREAT BECAUSE IT IS AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BEAR 

06:56:19.599 --> 06:56:21.003
WITNESS TO WHAT HAPPENED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. 

06:56:21.004 --> 06:56:23.724
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN SEE MITCH McCONNELL 
GOING ON RIGHT NOW JUST WATCH 

06:56:23.956 --> 06:56:30.757
AND SEE IF HIS HE HAS A -- 
JURORS WHO ARE PART OF THIS 

06:56:30.990 --> 06:56:33.502
HORRIBLE DAY. I WANT TO GO 
THROUGH THE ELEMENTS HERE AND 

06:56:33.743 --> 06:56:38.637
TALK THROUGH THE IMPORTANT 
ASPECTS OF THIS BECAUSE THE 

06:56:38.893 --> 06:56:42.536
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WHO GAVE 
THEIR PRESENTATIONS, DELEGATE 

06:56:42.939 --> 06:56:47.988
PLASKETT AND REPRESENTATIVE 
CAPITOL  REALLY FOCUSED ON SOME 

06:56:48.222 --> 06:56:50.363
KEY THINGS. AS THEY WENT THROUGH
THE TIMELINE, INCLUDING

06:56:55.574 --> 06:56:58.389
THE PERIL THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS
IN, THE DANGER TO THE SPEAKER OF

06:56:58.617 --> 06:57:01.187
THE HOUSE HAD SHE NOT BEEN 
EVACUATED IN TIME AND OF COURSE 

06:57:01.422 --> 06:57:03.997
THE DANGER TO ALL MEMBERS AS 
WELL AS POLICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT

06:57:04.228 --> 06:57:06.027
THE VICE PRESIDENT TO BEGIN 
WITH. JAMES? 

06:57:06.028 --> 06:57:09.861
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE SAW ALL THE 
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THAT WAS 

06:57:10.091 --> 06:57:13.137
JUXTAPOSED WITH VIDEOS WE HAVE 
SEEN BEFORE AND IT DID SHOW HOW 

06:57:13.373 --> 06:57:17.986
MANY CLOSE CALLS THERE WERE. IT 
REALLY IS MORE STRIKING THAN 

06:57:18.218 --> 06:57:21.023
EVER NOW HAVING SEEN THE 
PRESENTATION WHICH HAS SHOWN 

06:57:21.262 --> 06:57:24.323
THERE WAS NOT MORE LOSS OF LIFE 
ON JANUARY 6 AND THERE WAS NOT 

06:57:24.562 --> 06:57:29.300
DEADLY FORCE MORE USED BY 
OFFICERS. THE PENCE VIDEO SHOWED

06:57:29.534 --> 06:57:31.878
THE VICE PRESIDENT. WE OBVIOUSLY
ALSO TOGETHER

06:57:39.935 --> 06:57:42.524
ON JANUARY 6 WHEN HE WAS TAKEN 
OFF THE SENATE FLOOR, WHISKED 

06:57:42.758 --> 06:57:45.353
AWAY BY SECRET SERVICE. THE NEW 
FOOTAGE WE SAW SHOWS HIM BEING 

06:57:45.591 --> 06:57:48.160
RUSHED DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS 
JUST OFF THE SENATE CHAMBER TO 

06:57:48.398 --> 06:57:52.297
HIS HIDEAWAY. AND YOU SEE THE 
VICE PRESIDENT LOOKING BEHIND TO

06:57:52.531 --> 06:57:55.087
HIS LEFT SORT OF NERVOUSLY AS HE
IS BEING RUSHED OUT ESSENTIALLY 

06:57:55.318 --> 06:57:57.682
RUNNING AWAY AND YOU ALSO SEE IN
THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THAT 

06:57:57.916 --> 06:58:03.574
THE MOB REALLY WAS BASICALLY 
JUST OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE 

06:58:03.978 --> 06:58:07.877
PENCE WAS. SECRET SERVICE HAD 
BARRICADED THE DOOR BUT AND THE 

06:58:08.126 --> 06:58:13.319
MOB DID NOT KNOW HE WAS THERE 
BUT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM 

06:58:13.602 --> 06:58:16.227
AND CHANTING, HEY, MIKE PENCE." 
HE WAS RIGHT THERE THROUGH IT 

06:58:16.461 --> 06:58:18.461
ALL

06:58:25.417 --> 06:58:27.606
AS THEY ENDED UP GETTING INTO 
THE SENATE CHAMBER. 

06:58:27.607 --> 06:58:30.432
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I JUST WANT TO MENTION WE SAW
SENATOR ROMNEY GO DOWN THE 

06:58:30.666 --> 06:58:32.802
CORRIDOR AND ALL THE REPORTERS 
FOLLOWING HIM BECAUSE WE SAW 

06:58:33.033 --> 06:58:35.033
STUNNING FOOTAGE OF OFFICER 
GOODMAN SAVING THE SENATORS IN 

06:58:35.148 --> 06:58:37.960
THE CHAMBER BY REDIRECTING THE 
MOB AWAY FROM THEM. WE SAW THAT 

06:58:38.203 --> 06:58:40.374
FOOTAGE OF HIM RUNNING THROUGH 
THE HALL TO CONFRONT, AS 

06:58:40.637 --> 06:58:44.204
DELICATE PLASKETT  EXPLAINED, 
THE FIRST WAVE OF ATTACKERS. HE 

06:58:44.471 --> 06:58:47.009
PASSES MITT ROMNEY AND WARNS HIM
AND ROMNEY TURNS AND RUNS

06:58:54.499 --> 06:58:56.499
, JAMES? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL, 

06:58:56.512 --> 06:58:59.550
THE TWO CLOSE CALLS I WAS KIND 
OF STRUCK BY WHICH WE DID NOT 

06:58:59.793 --> 06:59:01.668
KNOW ABOUT BEFORE THE 
PRESENTATION. WITH MITT ROMNEY, 

06:59:01.669 --> 06:59:04.286
YOU REALLY, YOU SAW IN THE VIDEO
IT IS CLEARLY MITT ROMNEY 

06:59:04.521 --> 06:59:09.434
WALKING DOWN YOU SAW THE MOB 
COMING IN, THE GUY WAVING A 

06:59:09.669 --> 06:59:11.790
TRUMP FLAG AND ANOTHER HAD A 
CONFEDERATE FLAG AND SOMEONE 

06:59:12.064 --> 06:59:14.429
USED A WOODEN BASICALLY BOARD TO
BREAK THROUGH THE WINDOW AND

06:59:22.151 --> 06:59:24.708
SOMEONE ELSE OPENS THE DOOR BUT 
WE SAW THE VIDEO OF EVERYONE 

06:59:24.940 --> 06:59:27.544
INSIDE. THERE WAS AT LEAST 100 
PEOPLE WHO HAD GOTTEN INSIDE AND

06:59:27.790 --> 06:59:29.657
SIMULTANEOUSLY, MITT ROMNEY IS 
LITERALLY WALKING DOWN THE 

06:59:29.658 --> 06:59:31.987
HALLWAY TOWARD THEM AND SO WE 
HAVE SEEN OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN

06:59:32.354 --> 06:59:34.689
WHO HAS OBVIOUSLY GOTTEN A LOT 
OF ATTENTION. THERE WAS A 

06:59:34.920 --> 06:59:37.249
REPORTER FROM HUFF POST WHO 
CAPTURED A VIDEO OF HIM LEADING 

06:59:37.487 --> 06:59:40.560
THE MOB AWAY FROM THE WHERE THE 
SENATORS WERE IN THE CHAMBER AND

06:59:40.791 --> 06:59:43.327
WHERE MIKE PENCE WAS SORT OF 
GUIDING THEM TOWARD WHERE THERE 

06:59:43.562 --> 06:59:46.689
WAS A BACK UP LINE OF OFFICERS. 
WE DID NOT REALIZE BEFORE NOW 

06:59:46.919 --> 06:59:48.919
THAT ROMNEY

06:59:59.608 --> 07:00:01.608
. OBVIOUSLY,

07:00:04.045 --> 07:00:06.045
THIS CREW JUST TESTED THEM

07:00:18.211 --> 07:00:20.972
. IF THAT CROWD HAD GOTTEN TO 
ROMNEY, IF GOODMAN HAD NOT 

07:00:21.224 --> 07:00:23.798
TURNED ROMNEY AROUND AND YOU SAW
HIM RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION, IT 

07:00:24.047 --> 07:00:26.166
WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER. 
SIMILARLY, IT WOULD'VE BEEN A 

07:00:26.396 --> 07:00:29.179
DISASTER IF CHUCK SCHUMER HAD 
RUN INTO THE CROWD AND THAT WAS 

07:00:29.424 --> 07:00:32.023
THE OTHER CLOSE CALL THAT WE DID
NOT KNOW ABOUT BEFORE THE 

07:00:32.265 --> 07:00:34.358
PRESENTATION SO YOU SAW CHUCK 
SCHUMER WALKING UP WITH THE 

07:00:34.590 --> 07:00:36.590
SECURITY DETAIL. THOSE WHO KNOW 
THE CAPITAL NO

07:00:41.174 --> 07:00:43.544
CAPITOL KNOW HE WAS WALKING INTO
THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER AND 

07:00:43.778 --> 07:00:45.924
THERE WERE PEOPLE COMING THE 
OTHER DIRECTION SO YOU SEE 

07:00:46.156 --> 07:00:48.524
SHURMUR GO UP THIS RAMP AND 
IMMEDIATELY TURN AROUND AND COME

07:00:48.764 --> 07:00:51.927
BACK DOWN THE RAMP AND HE IS 
WALKING UP THE RAMP AND WHEN HE 

07:00:52.158 --> 07:00:54.267
GOES BACK DOWN THE RAMP 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER, HE IS RUNNING

07:00:54.498 --> 07:00:57.099
SO WE DID NOT REALIZE HOW CLOSE,
AGAIN, ONE OF THE MOST 

07:00:57.332 --> 07:00:59.332
RECOGNIZABLE FIGURES IN 
CONGRESS, CHUCK SCHUMER, IF HE 

07:00:59.471 --> 07:01:02.447
HAD COME IN CONTACT WITH THE MOB
IT WOULD'VE BEEN A DISASTER AND 

07:01:02.688 --> 07:01:05.741
WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED. SWALWELL ALSO SHOWED 

07:01:05.972 --> 07:01:08.121
FOOTAGE NOT ONCE BUT TWICE OF 
SENATORS WHEN THEY WERE 

07:01:08.525 --> 07:01:12.235
EVACUATED  FROM THE SENATE 
CHAMBER AND GOING TO THE SECURE 

07:01:12.469 --> 07:01:14.604
LOCATION WHERE THEY ENDED UP 
STAYING FOR SEVERAL HOURS. YOU 

07:01:14.840 --> 07:01:18.866
LITERALLY SAW SEVERAL SENATORS 
WHO WERE IN THE CHAMBER FOR THE 

07:01:19.098 --> 07:01:21.098
TRIAL INCLUDING A BUNCH OF 
REPUBLICANS WHO

07:01:26.508 --> 07:01:28.150
OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT'S 
IMPEACHMENT RUNNING FOR THEIR 

07:01:28.151 --> 07:01:30.923
LIVES AND YOUR SAKE STAFFERS, 
THOSE THAT COVER CONGRESS, A LOT

07:01:31.160 --> 07:01:33.160
OF US QUITE RECOGNIZABLE, 
RUNNING DOWN AND

07:01:37.404 --> 07:01:39.759
SWALWELL PLAYED IT TWICE BECAUSE
IT WAS SUCH A VISCERAL IMAGE. 

07:01:39.988 --> 07:01:42.612
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO PLAY THAT FOOTAGE 
OF SENATOR ROMNEY. THIS IS 

07:01:42.848 --> 07:01:45.221
DELEGATE  STACY PLASKETT  ONE OF
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TAKING 

07:01:45.454 --> 07:01:48.251
US THROUGH THAT MOMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN THIS SECURITY FOOTAGE YOU 

07:01:48.491 --> 07:01:50.806
CAN SEE OFFICER GOODMAN RUNNING 
TO RESPOND TO THE INITIAL 

07:01:51.052 --> 07:01:58.105
BREACH. OFFICER GOODMAN PASSES 
SENATOR MITT ROMNEY AND DIRECTS 

07:01:58.471 --> 07:02:01.749
HIM TO TURN AROUND IN ORDER TO 
GET TO SAFETY.

07:02:08.434 --> 07:02:10.951
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO RHONDA COLEMAN 
LIVE AT THE CAPITAL. RHONDA, 

07:02:11.184 --> 07:02:14.687
THERE WERE MANY CLOSE CALLS AS 
OUTLINED IN THE FOOTAGE TODAY 

07:02:14.931 --> 07:02:17.811
AND ALSO THE USE OF THOSE RED 
DOTS THAT SHOWED SORT OF WHERE 

07:02:18.048 --> 07:02:20.151
ATTACKERS WERE AND WHERE 
IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN AMERICAN 

07:02:20.381 --> 07:02:21.971
GOVERNMENT WERE AT THE SAME 
TIME. 

07:02:21.972 --> 07:02:23.972
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: RIGHT,

07:02:31.799 --> 07:02:34.395
THIS SORT OF ADDS MORE PIECES TO
THE WHOLE PUZZLE. THE TIMELINE 

07:02:34.633 --> 07:02:36.771
THAT WAS JUST TOLD US BY THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, SHOWING 

07:02:37.003 --> 07:02:42.155
THESE NEAR MISSES OF KEY FIGURES
IN CONGRESS. ALL OF THEM, REALLY

07:02:42.395 --> 07:02:44.753
AND GOING OVER SOME OF THE 
DOCUMENTATION THAT IS PART OF 

07:02:44.990 --> 07:02:47.843
THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION OF THIS.
ONE THAT STANDS OUT TO ME AS A 

07:02:48.077 --> 07:02:53.734
MAN ASSOCIATED WITH ONE OF THE 
GROUPS THAT SAID IN AN FBI 

07:02:53.971 --> 07:02:56.378
INTERVIEW THAT THEY WOULD KILL 
ANYONE THEY GOT THEIR HANDS ON 

07:02:56.608 --> 07:02:58.608
AND THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY 
LOOKING FOR NANCY PELOSI. WE 

07:02:58.753 --> 07:03:01.809
ALSO LEARNED AND SOME MAY HAVE 
LEARNED THAT THE MAN WHO PUT HIS

07:03:02.045 --> 07:03:04.792
FEET ON NANCY PELOSI'S DESK HAD 
A HIGH-VOLTAGE STUN GUN ON HIM. 

07:03:05.022 --> 07:03:07.864
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT STACEY 
PLASKETT DID SHARE AND SHOWED 

07:03:08.105 --> 07:03:10.987
AND HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PHOTO 
THERE OF HIM. THERE ARE ALL 

07:03:11.216 --> 07:03:14.837
THESE DETAILS THAT ARE SORT OF 
KIND OF MAKING THIS PICTURE EVEN

07:03:15.240 --> 07:03:17.240
MORE GRIM. WE SAW

07:03:21.263 --> 07:03:24.203
HOW NANCY PELOSI'S STAFFERS HAD 
TO HIDE IN A ROOM AND COULD HEAR

07:03:24.466 --> 07:03:28.309
THE MOB IN HER OFFICE. WE WERE 
NOW ABLE TO SEE HOW THEY LEFT 

07:03:28.541 --> 07:03:32.775
AND WENT INTO A ROOM AND HOW 
MOMENTS LATER THE MOB CAME 

07:03:33.012 --> 07:03:37.242
THROUGH AND TRIED TO BREAK INTO 
THE DOORWAY THAT THEY WERE ALL 

07:03:37.484 --> 07:03:39.389
IN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M GOING TO JUST LISTEN TO 

07:03:39.390 --> 07:03:41.390
SENATOR MURKOWSKI HERE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO MY COLLEAGUES, I WASN'T 

07:03:41.515 --> 07:03:45.650
FULLY AWARE OF EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE 

07:03:45.880 --> 07:03:48.455
BUILDING SO WHEN WE SEE ALL THE 
PIECES COME TOGETHER, JUST THE 

07:03:48.691 --> 07:03:50.691
TOTAL AWARENESS OF THAT BEING

07:03:52.915 --> 07:03:59.233
, THE THREAT NOT JUST TO ASSESS 
PEOPLE, AS LAWMAKERS BUT THE 

07:03:59.469 --> 07:04:06.563
THREAT TO THE INSTITUTION AND 
WHAT CONGRESS REPRESENTS. IT 

07:04:07.552 --> 07:04:12.321
DISTURBING. GREATLY DISTURBING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MAN

07:04:16.726 --> 07:04:19.308
HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE A CASE 
THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY DONALD 

07:04:19.541 --> 07:04:20.942
TRUMP'S DOING. YOU AGREE WITH 
THAT? 

07:04:20.943 --> 07:04:23.275
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS ARE MAKING A VERY 

07:04:23.510 --> 07:04:26.437
STRONG CASE FOR A TIMELINE THAT 
LAID OUT VERY CLEARLY

07:04:30.384 --> 07:04:33.218
WITH THE WORDS THAT WERE USED, 
WHEN HE USED THEM, HOW HE USED 

07:04:33.459 --> 07:04:35.459
THEM TO REALLY BUILD THE ANGER

07:04:43.332 --> 07:04:45.856
, THE VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW HERE 
IN THIS CAPITOL. 

07:04:45.857 --> 07:04:48.653
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THERE ANY DOUBT IN YOUR 
MIND AS WE WATCHED THAT, THEY 

07:04:48.902 --> 07:04:51.709
CALLED IT A DRUMBEAT WITH REGARD
TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THEY 

07:04:51.942 --> 07:04:54.428
BUILT, LIKE YOU SAID, A 
TIMELINE. IS THERE ANY DOUBT IN 

07:04:54.660 --> 07:04:56.875
YOUR MIND THAT DONALD TYPE 
DONALD TRUMP INCITED AN 

07:04:57.109 --> 07:05:01.045
INSURRECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM LOOKING AT WHAT WE ARE 

07:05:01.292 --> 07:05:05.949
SEEING NOW. I HAVE SAID THAT I 
WOULD LOOK TO THE EVIDENCE THAT 

07:05:06.566 --> 07:05:11.412
IS PRESENTED. THE EVIDENCE THAT 
HAS BEEN PRESENTED THUS FAR IS 

07:05:11.938 --> 07:05:17.152
PRETTY DAMNING. BUT I ALSO KNOW 
THAT I HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND 

07:05:17.383 --> 07:05:19.453
RESPONSIBILITY AND ONE THAT I 
ACCEPT TO LISTEN TO WHAT

07:05:24.802 --> 07:05:27.735
THE DEFENSE WILL PRESENT AND SO 
I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT

07:05:27.966 --> 07:05:35.250
IN A DAY OR SO BUT TODAY, AGAIN,
I THINK THE SERIES OF VIDEOS

07:05:38.830 --> 07:05:41.673
THAT WE HAVE SEEN, AGAIN, A 
REMINDER OF WHAT WE ALL LIVED 

07:05:41.902 --> 07:05:44.732
THROUGH AND UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT 
SOME DID NOT LIVE THROUGH. IT IS

07:05:44.979 --> 07:05:51.747
GREATLY, GREATLY DISTURBING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS THAT IF 

07:05:51.976 --> 07:05:54.227
THE SENATE DOES NOT ACT AND BAR 
DONALD TRUMP FROM

07:06:00.039 --> 07:06:02.608
RUNNING FOR OFFICE AGAIN THAT HE
COULD RUN AGAIN AND INSIGHT THE 

07:06:02.846 --> 07:06:04.263
SIMILAR SAME MOB OF SUPPORTERS 
HERE? 

07:06:04.264 --> 07:06:07.154
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T SEE HOW -- I DON'T 
SEE HOW, AFTER THE AMERICAN 

07:06:07.397 --> 07:06:11.789
PUBLIC SEES THE FULL STORY LAID 
OUT HERE, NOT JUST IN ONE 

07:06:12.021 --> 07:06:14.795
SNIPPET ON THIS DAY AND ANOTHER 
ON THAT, BUT THIS WHOLE, THIS 

07:06:15.034 --> 07:06:22.432
FULL SCENARIO THAT HAS BEEN LAID
OUT BEFORE US, I JUST DON'T SEE 

07:06:22.672 --> 07:06:30.190
HOW DONALD TRUMP COULD BE 
REELECTED. I JUST DON'T SEE 

07:06:30.865 --> 07:06:34.453
THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE UNDER NO PRESSURE OR 

07:06:34.684 --> 07:06:37.357
ARE YOU FROM YOUR LEADERSHIP TO 
GO A CERTAIN WAY? 

07:06:37.358 --> 07:06:40.270
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NONE WHATSOEVER. ABSOLUTELY 
NOT. 

07:06:40.271 --> 07:06:42.271
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO YOU FEEL FREE

07:06:46.157 --> 07:06:47.580
TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. 

07:06:47.581 --> 07:06:49.581
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

07:06:55.812 --> 07:06:57.986
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI FROM 
ALASKA, A KEY SENATOR TO WATCH 

07:06:58.222 --> 07:07:00.546
BECAUSE SHE IS ONE OF THOSE SIX 
REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED WITH 

07:07:00.775 --> 07:07:02.775
DEMOCRATS YESTERDAY SAYING THIS 
IS A CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS.

07:07:15.608 --> 07:07:18.651
RHONDA, I AM SORRY TO CUT YOU 
OFF EARLIER AND I WANT TO GET 

07:07:18.886 --> 07:07:21.684
BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BUT 
I WANTED TO STAY ON LISA 

07:07:21.920 --> 07:07:24.279
MURKOWSKI FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE 
SHE HAD SOME VERY STRONG WORDS. 

07:07:24.516 --> 07:07:26.786
SHE CALLED THE EVIDENCE DAMNING 
AND TALKED ABOUT HOW DISTURBING 

07:07:27.020 --> 07:07:29.813
IT WAS AND YET SHE WANTS TO HEAR
EVERYTHING LAID OUT THIS WEEK. 

07:07:30.041 --> 07:07:32.887
SHE IS NOT COMMITTING AT THIS 
POINT. SHE WANTS TO HEAR ALL OF 

07:07:33.122 --> 07:07:35.711
THE EVIDENCE. SHE DID SAY SHE 
DOES NOT SEE HOW DONALD TRUMP 

07:07:36.080 --> 07:07:38.669
COULD EVER BE REELECTED AGAIN. I
THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF 

07:07:38.903 --> 07:07:41.009
REPUBLICANS WHO WOULD BEG TO 
DIFFER ON THAT. RHONDA. 

07:07:41.010 --> 07:07:43.601
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: I THINK YOU ARE 
RIGHT AND I AM ACTUALLY, WHEN 

07:07:43.829 --> 07:07:46.563
SHE SAID THAT I WAS THINKING 
BACK TO 2015 ONE DONALD TRUMP 

07:07:46.793 --> 07:07:48.913
CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR AND 
ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY. A LOT 

07:07:49.146 --> 07:07:51.973
OF REPUBLICANS DID NOT THINK IT 
WAS SERIOUS AND DID NOT THINK HE

07:07:52.203 --> 07:07:54.788
WOULD BE ELECTED AND DEMOCRATS 
AS WELL BUT IT INDEED HAPPENED 

07:07:55.020 --> 07:07:57.518
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS ALSO 
PUTTING SOME RESPONSIBILITY ON 

07:07:57.758 --> 07:08:00.410
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT AFTER 
THEY VIEW THIS NOW, THEY WOULD 

07:08:00.643 --> 07:08:03.227
NOT VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN FOUR 
YEARS FROM NOW BUT WE REALLY 

07:08:03.464 --> 07:08:06.304
DON'T KNOW. SO I DON'T KNOW. I 
THINK SHE MIGHT BE SORT OF 

07:08:06.534 --> 07:08:08.534
GIVING HERSELF

07:08:11.156 --> 07:08:14.011
, YOU KNOW, LETTING HER KNOW 
THAT SHE IS TRYING TO BE AN 

07:08:14.243 --> 07:08:16.353
IMPARTIAL JUROR. SHE HAS 
SOMEWHAT OF A SIMILAR POSTURE AS

07:08:16.585 --> 07:08:19.099
SHE DID LAST IMPEACHMENT WHERE 
SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE LAST 

07:08:19.347 --> 07:08:22.145
SENATORS WE WERE ALL WATCHING TO
SEE WHICH WAY SHE WAS GOING TO 

07:08:22.377 --> 07:08:24.974
GO. SHE HAD SAID THEN THAT SHE 
DID NOT AGREE WITH DONALD 

07:08:25.214 --> 07:08:27.962
TRUMP'S ACTIONS BUT WOULD NOT 
VOTE TO IMPEACH HIM SO IT SOUNDS

07:08:28.191 --> 07:08:30.771
LIKE SHE IS SORT OF KIND OF 
TAKING THAT SIMILAR STANCE THERE

07:08:31.003 --> 07:08:34.061
OF NOT AGREEING ON ONE SIDE OR 
THE OTHER JUST YET SO WE WILL 

07:08:34.308 --> 07:08:37.435
SEE. WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH HER 
AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER SIX

07:08:37.800 --> 07:08:39.916
REPUBLICANS WHO DID VOTE FOR THE
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS TRIAL.

07:08:40.450 --> 07:08:43.303
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA I WANTED TO LET YOU 
GET BACK TO FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.

07:08:43.553 --> 07:08:46.137
I'M SO SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF 
EARLIER. WE WILL KEEP MONITORING

07:08:46.369 --> 07:08:48.369
THAT

07:09:02.052 --> 07:09:04.655
MICROPHONE TO SEE IF SENATORS TO
COME AND SPEAK, ONCE WE ARE 

07:09:04.886 --> 07:09:06.886
PARTICULARLY WATCHING. PLEASE, 
CONTINUE ON WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

07:09:07.007 --> 07:09:09.340
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: RIGHT AND THIS IS 
AN IMPORTANT TIME BECAUSE THEY 

07:09:09.572 --> 07:09:12.316
ARE GOING AFTER THEIR DINNER 
BREAK AND A LOT OF THEM WILL 

07:09:12.556 --> 07:09:15.383
STOP TO TALK TO SOME REPORTERS 
ALONG THE WAY SO IT IS IMPORTANT

07:09:15.617 --> 07:09:18.415
TO CHECK IN AND SEE WHAT THEY 
ARE SAYING AFTER WE HAVE WATCHED

07:09:18.654 --> 07:09:20.654
SOME REALLY STRIKING FOOTAGE 
OVER THE LAST HOUR. THIS 

07:09:20.767 --> 07:09:23.737
PRESENTATION WE JUST SAW ALLOWED
US TO SEE HOW CLOSE. WE ARE TOLD

07:09:23.970 --> 07:09:27.037
HOW STAFFERS WERE BARRICADED BUT
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE HOW CLOSE 

07:09:27.266 --> 07:09:30.040
THE MOB GOT TO THOSE STAFFERS 
AND MANY WERE QUITE YOUNG AND I 

07:09:30.271 --> 07:09:33.224
HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY STAFFERS 
HERE ON THE HILL SINCE JANUARY 6

07:09:33.455 --> 07:09:36.779
AND A LOT OF THEM DO SHARE THE 
TRAUMA THAT THEY HAD THAT DAY 

07:09:37.009 --> 07:09:39.348
AND CONCEIVED TO LIVE WITH WHEN 
THEY SEE THESE

07:09:47.445 --> 07:09:49.445
SCENES AND WALKED BACK INTO 
THESE BUILDINGS. THIS IS 

07:09:49.589 --> 07:09:51.959
SOMETHING THEY CANNOT LEAVE 
BEHIND JUST ON JANUARY 6 AND I 

07:09:52.203 --> 07:09:54.801
THINK FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
WHO MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THE SCALE

07:09:55.034 --> 07:09:57.982
OF JANUARY 6 AND HOW LONG IT 
LASTED, HOW IT WAS HOURS, THAT 

07:09:58.213 --> 07:10:00.584
PEOPLE WERE BARRICADED IN SAFE 
ROOMS, THEY ARE GETTING A SENSE 

07:10:00.822 --> 07:10:03.385
OF THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS ALSO
A PORTION IN REPRESENTATIVES 

07:10:03.635 --> 07:10:05.635
WHILE WHILE'S COMMENTS WHERE HE 
SAID HE PACED

07:10:12.052 --> 07:10:15.076
IT OUT AND SAW HOW CLOSE THEY 
WERE TO THE MOB THAT CAME IN 

07:10:15.310 --> 07:10:17.964
THAT DIRECTION AND SAID THEY 
WERE ONLY 58 STATE STEPS AWAY. 

07:10:18.195 --> 07:10:20.195
THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A 
LOT OF

07:10:24.472 --> 07:10:27.722
, A MORE GRIM PICTURE THAN WHAT 
IT WAS BUT WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT 

07:10:27.961 --> 07:10:30.544
NOW, THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE RIGHT 
NOW IS STILL VERY DIFFICULT TO 

07:10:30.780 --> 07:10:33.159
GRASP THAT THEY CAME THAT CLOSE 
TO SO MANY PEOPLE. 

07:10:33.160 --> 07:10:35.160
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT JUST HOW 
REPUBLICANS

07:10:43.819 --> 07:10:45.861
AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE REACTING 
TO THIS WITH INVESTIGATIVE 

07:10:46.093 --> 07:10:48.205
REPORTER, TOM HAMBURGER. WE JUST
HEARD LISA MURKOWSKI, A SENATOR 

07:10:48.437 --> 07:10:50.795
FROM ALASKA MARVEL AND SAY SHE 
DOESN'T SEE HOW PEOPLE COULD 

07:10:51.041 --> 07:10:53.367
REELECT DONALD TRUMP AFTER 
HEARING ALL OF THIS BUT I WANT 

07:10:53.612 --> 07:10:56.107
TO TALK ABOUT A STORY YOU 
REPORTED WITH OUR CALLING, CANHA

07:10:56.342 --> 07:10:58.469
KNOWLES ABOUT THE SENATE 
MAJORITY A REPUBLICAN IN THE 

07:10:58.702 --> 07:11:03.705
STATE OF MICHIGAN WHO TOLD 
MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY THAT THE 

07:11:03.938 --> 07:11:06.218
CAPITOL ATTACK WAS STAGED AND 
NOT DONE BY TWO TRUMP 

07:11:06.451 --> 07:11:08.578
SUPPORTERS. TOM? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: SO THIS IS MAYBE A 

07:11:08.834 --> 07:11:10.834
SIGN OF

07:11:12.812 --> 07:11:15.159
AT LEAST SOME OF THE GRASSROOTS 
REACTION. YOU HAVE THE MAJORITY 

07:11:15.402 --> 07:11:20.205
LEADER OF THE MICHIGAN STATE 
SENATE, MAJORITY LEADER SHIRKEY 

07:11:20.439 --> 07:11:25.596
WHO AND RECORDED CONVERSATION 
WITH A REPUBLICAN ACTIVIST IN 

07:11:26.322 --> 07:11:28.322
MICHIGAN DESCRIBED

07:11:31.300 --> 07:11:35.010
THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL AS A 
WHOLE AND SAID THAT HE THOUGHT 

07:11:35.398 --> 07:11:38.213
ANTIFA SUPPORTERS WERE REALLY 
BEHIND IT.

07:11:49.009 --> 07:11:51.113
IT CREATED SOMETHING OF A 
SENSATION IN MICHIGAN AND THERE 

07:11:51.348 --> 07:11:53.663
WERE CALLS FOR HIM TO STEP DOWN 
AND ANGRY COMMENTS FROM 

07:11:53.894 --> 07:11:55.894
DEMOCRATS. HE APOLOGIZED BUT 
SAID HE SOMETIMES ALLOWS HIS 

07:11:55.978 --> 07:12:02.177
STRONG VIEWS AND STRONG VIEWS TO
GET AHEAD OF WHAT HE REALLY 

07:12:02.407 --> 07:12:04.407
OUGHT TO SAY. HE DID NOT, 
HOWEVER

07:12:07.346 --> 07:12:10.364
, APOLOGIZE FOR CALLING IT A 
HOAX AND TODAY, HE WAS CAUGHT I 

07:12:10.628 --> 07:12:15.018
GATHER IN LANSING, MICHIGAN, IN 
THE STATE CAPITAL IN THE SENATE 

07:12:15.249 --> 07:12:17.861
ON A HOT MICROPHONE TALKING TO A
COLLEAGUE IN THE LEGISLATURE 

07:12:18.618 --> 07:12:25.367
SAYING THAT HE THOUGHT THE HOAX 
WAS THAT IT WAS BLAMING DONALD 

07:12:25.604 --> 07:12:28.316
TRUMP FOR THIS THAT IT HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.

07:12:31.434 --> 07:12:34.021
WE HAVE ASKED HIM AGAIN FOR 
COMMENT TODAY AND DON'T HAVE ANY

07:12:34.253 --> 07:12:39.091
FURTHER RESPONSE. BUT IT IS A 
SIGN OF HOW POLARIZED THIS 

07:12:39.343 --> 07:12:41.826
COUNTRY CONTINUES TO BE AND HOW 
EVEN AS THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

07:12:42.065 --> 07:12:45.701
GETS UNDERWAY PUBLIC REPUBLICAN 
SUPPORTERS, ALLIES OF DONALD 

07:12:45.931 --> 07:12:47.931
TRUMP CONTINUE TO

07:12:51.478 --> 07:12:54.403
, AT LEAST IN SOME WAY, WANT TO 
COME TO HIS DEFENSE. 

07:12:54.404 --> 07:12:56.494
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOM, CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE 
TAYLOR GREENE WHO IS KNOWN TO 

07:12:56.725 --> 07:13:01.925
ENDORSE AND SHARE CONSPIRACY 
THERE IS, TOTALLY BIZARRE 

07:13:02.326 --> 07:13:07.508
CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND SAID 
ABSOLUTELY BONKERS THINGS THAT 

07:13:07.743 --> 07:13:10.182
I'M NOT GOING TO WIN TO IN 
DETAIL RIGHT NOW.

07:13:14.897 --> 07:13:17.231
SHE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS WERE NOT THE ONE TO 

07:13:17.461 --> 07:13:21.363
BLAME IN THIS. HOW ARE PEOPLE 
ABLE TO SAY THAT GIVEN WHAT WE 

07:13:21.601 --> 07:13:25.887
ARE WITNESSING TODAY? AND THE 
FACT THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS 

07:13:26.136 --> 07:13:28.371
THEMSELVES HAVE TAKEN CREDIT FOR
STORMING THE CAPITAL? 

07:13:28.372 --> 07:13:33.373
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GET 
INTO THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE 

07:13:33.808 --> 07:13:38.553
CLAIMING THIS. WE WERE 
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN LATER

07:13:38.782 --> 07:13:43.426
SHIRKEY AND HIS THOUGHTS BECAUSE
YOU MAY RECALL HE WAS NOT 

07:13:43.910 --> 07:13:45.910
CONSIDERED A

07:13:48.530 --> 07:13:50.885
-- ON THE EXTREME EDGES OR 
FRINGES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

07:13:51.125 --> 07:13:53.622
ONE DONALD TRUMP CALLED HIM TO 
WASHINGTON, TO ASK FOR HIS 

07:13:53.854 --> 07:13:58.264
SUPPORT IN THE OVAL OFFICE, 
CONTESTING THE VOTE IN MICHIGAN,

07:13:58.498 --> 07:14:02.626
HE AND THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE 
MAJORITY LEADER FROM LANSING, 

07:14:03.218 --> 07:14:09.034
MICHIGAN TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT
THEY DID NOT THINK HE HAD WON 

07:14:09.280 --> 07:14:13.015
AND THEY ASKED FOR HELP WITH A 
COVERED RELIEF PACKAGE SO HE WAS

07:14:15.136 --> 07:14:18.157
A REPUBLICAN WHO SEEMED TO BE 
QUITE CENTERED.

07:14:23.745 --> 07:14:26.363
SINCE JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN SWORN 
AND THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS IN 

07:14:26.595 --> 07:14:28.933
THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WHICH 
LATER SHIRKEY IS SURELY AWARE OF

07:14:29.166 --> 07:14:32.996
TO REPRIMAND REPUBLICANS WHO ARE
CONSIDERED DISLOYAL TO DONALD 

07:14:33.229 --> 07:14:35.229
TRUMP. SOME REPUBLICAN

07:14:38.515 --> 07:14:40.967
, STATE AND COUNTY REPUBLICAN 
UNITS HAVE TAKEN VOTES TO

07:14:44.937 --> 07:14:48.039
CENSURE OR DISAPPROVE ONE OF THE
MOST SENIOR AND INFLUENTIAL 

07:14:48.444 --> 07:14:50.507
REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE, FRED 
UPTON, A MICHIGAN CONGRESSMAN, 

07:14:51.269 --> 07:14:56.271
FOR HIS, WHAT WAS PERCEIVED AS 
DISLOYALTY TO DONALD TRUMP.

07:14:59.846 --> 07:15:02.857
WE DO HAVE AND WE ARE CONTINUING
TO FIND, WE ARE SEEING IT IN 

07:15:03.089 --> 07:15:05.089
MICHIGAN AND YOU JUST

07:15:07.471 --> 07:15:09.798
DESCRIBED A CONGRESSWOMAN FROM 
GEORGIA AND WE ARE SEEING IT IN 

07:15:10.029 --> 07:15:12.029
OTHER TRUMP STRONGHOLDS AROUND 
THE COUNTRY THAT THERE IS 

07:15:12.138 --> 07:15:14.243
CONTINUED LOYALTY FOR DONALD 
TRUMP AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO 

07:15:14.475 --> 07:15:18.975
CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO SOME 
THEORIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN 

07:15:19.212 --> 07:15:23.157
THIS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS AS FAR 
OUT AND IS FALSE WHETHER IT HAS 

07:15:23.387 --> 07:15:25.387
TO DO WITH ELECTION FRAUD OR 
WITH

07:15:29.695 --> 07:15:32.804
THE CAPITOL ATTACK THAT IT WAS 
SOMEWHAT OF A HOAX AND WAS NOT 

07:15:33.319 --> 07:15:36.862
INSTIGATED BY DONALD TRUMP. WE 
ARE STILL HEARING THAT 

07:15:37.094 --> 07:15:39.691
REVERBERATION AND THAT IS A SIGN
OF JUST HOW DIVIDED AND 

07:15:40.060 --> 07:15:46.809
POLARIZED WE CONTINUE TO BE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, I WILL BRING YOU INTO 

07:15:47.048 --> 07:15:51.249
THE CONVERSATION. I REALLY 
APPRECIATE TOM'S JOURNALISTIC 

07:15:51.682 --> 07:15:54.516
AND ABSOLUTELY WE ARE NOT GOING 
TO GET IN THE HEADS OF PEOPLE 

07:15:54.753 --> 07:15:56.878
ABSOLUTELY BUT I WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT JUSTIFICATION ARE THEY 

07:15:57.125 --> 07:16:02.868
USING? HOW ARE THEY EXPLAINING 
AWAY THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS 

07:16:03.276 --> 07:16:08.321
ANTIFA OR SOMETHING THAT THERE 
IS NO EVIDENCE FOR? I WILL POINT

07:16:08.554 --> 07:16:10.706
OUT THAT WHILE WE HAVE BEEN 
BROADCASTING THIS FOR THE 

07:16:10.941 --> 07:16:12.941
WASHINGTON POST AND THE 
NETWORKS,

07:16:20.390 --> 07:16:22.738
THE CABLE NETWORKS ARE COVERING 
IT, FOX NEWS PULLED AWAY FROM 

07:16:22.970 --> 07:16:24.970
THE PRESENTATION SO IF YOU'RE 
WONDERING WHERE PEOPLE ARE 

07:16:25.068 --> 07:16:27.403
GETTING THEIR INFORMATION, AND 
YOU ARE A FOX NEWS VIEWER, YOU 

07:16:27.641 --> 07:16:29.742
ARE NOT SEEING SOME OF THE 
EVIDENCE PRESENTED THIS EVENING.

07:16:29.975 --> 07:16:32.458
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE BEST THING FOR DONALD 
TRUMP WOULD BE THE TRAVEL 

07:16:32.692 --> 07:16:35.231
IMPULSE AND FOX CUTTING AWAY IS 
A METAPHOR FOR A LOT OF 

07:16:35.462 --> 07:16:37.462
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO LOOK AWAY.
TO.

07:16:42.984 --> 07:16:45.721
LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE. TO NOT 
WATCH WHAT HAPPENED AND ONE OF 

07:16:45.957 --> 07:16:48.296
THE REASONS THIS WAS SO 
EFFECTIVE FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE 

07:16:48.530 --> 07:16:51.094
ROOM IS IT IS VISCERAL, THEY 
WERE THERE AND THEY COULD NOT 

07:16:51.330 --> 07:16:53.330
LOOK AWAY. THE SENATORS HAD 
WATCH. ULTIMATELY, THEIR ENTIRE 

07:16:53.569 --> 07:16:56.176
POLITICAL CAREERS ARE TIED UP 
AND HOW THEY VOTE ON THIS. 

07:16:56.418 --> 07:16:58.418
ULTIMATELY, WHETHER TRUMP IS 
CONVICTED OR ACQUITTED, THIS IS 

07:16:58.547 --> 07:17:01.122
HIS LEGACY. WHAT WE SAW AND A 
LOT OF THESE POLITICIANS KNOW 

07:17:01.352 --> 07:17:03.352
THAT

07:17:04.858 --> 07:17:07.828
, THEY KNOW THAT IS HOW EVERYONE
IS GOING TO REMEMBER HIM BUT 

07:17:08.060 --> 07:17:13.559
THERE IS THIS ECHO CHAMBER ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND PLACES. FOX 

07:17:13.805 --> 07:17:16.096
NEWS IS CONSERVATIVE OR 
PRO-TRUMP ENOUGH FOR A LOT OF 

07:17:16.326 --> 07:17:21.915
TRUMP SUPPORTERS SO THEY TURN TO
NEWS NEXT-DOOR AMERICAN NEWS.

07:17:30.795 --> 07:17:33.147
THIS IS A TIME IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY TO ONLY EXPOSE YOURSELF 

07:17:33.380 --> 07:17:35.472
TO INFORMATION THAT VALIDATES 
WHAT YOU ALREADY THINK AND THAT 

07:17:35.704 --> 07:17:38.037
IS SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP 
UNDERSTANDS AND THAT IS WHY HE 

07:17:38.269 --> 07:17:40.378
WAS ABLE TO BECOME THE FIRST 
PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY 

07:17:40.611 --> 07:17:45.761
WITH NO PRIOR GOVERNMENT OR 
MILITARY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HE 

07:17:45.996 --> 07:17:47.864
CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
FRAGMENTED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT 

07:17:47.865 --> 07:17:50.667
WHERE THE WAY TO BREAK THROUGH 
ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT IS TO BE

07:17:50.902 --> 07:17:54.205
PROVOCATIVE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT
ONE SHARED SET OF FACTS ANYMORE 

07:17:54.439 --> 07:17:56.890
AS THEY USED TO BE. IT IS 
TOTALLY, KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID 

07:17:57.124 --> 07:18:00.881
THIS WORLD OF ALTERNATIVE FACTS 
WHERE THEY CREATED THIS 

07:18:01.476 --> 07:18:05.853
ARCHITECTURE THAT IS TOTALLY 
DISTINCT FROM REALITY. 

07:18:05.854 --> 07:18:08.182
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU 
REPORTING FROM OUR COLLEAGUE, 

07:18:08.414 --> 07:18:10.414
SIMON KIM WHO WAS ABLE TO --

07:18:16.783 --> 07:18:18.968
SEUNG MIN KIM.

07:18:22.700 --> 07:18:27.481
ALSO WITH OFFICER GOODMAN WHO 
WAS WIDELY PRAISED BUT HE DID 

07:18:27.719 --> 07:18:30.277
NOT KNOW BUT HE WOULD LOOK 
FORWARD TO THANKING HIM ONCE HE 

07:18:30.516 --> 07:18:32.516
SAW HIM.

07:18:35.683 --> 07:18:37.935
SENATOR ROMNEY ALSO SAID THIS, 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY TROUBLING 

07:18:38.179 --> 07:18:40.500
TO SEE THE GREAT VIOLENCE AT OUR
CAPITOL POLICE AND OTHERS 

07:18:40.734 --> 07:18:43.351
SUBJECTED TO AND IT TEARS AT 
YOUR HEART AND BRINGS TEARS TO 

07:18:43.583 --> 07:18:45.203
YOUR EYES. THAT WAS 
OVERWHELMINGLY DISTRESSING AND 

07:18:45.204 --> 07:18:49.042
EMOTIONAL. SO RHONDA COLEMAN, WE
ARE GETTING A SENSE THAT

07:18:56.512 --> 07:18:58.775
SENDERS WERE VERY MUCH TUNED IN 
THIS EVENING, PAYING ATTENTION, 

07:18:59.007 --> 07:19:01.819
FOCUS. FOR RICK MITT ROMNEY TO 
TELL -- TO ALL OF THE OTHERS, 

07:19:02.047 --> 07:19:04.047
FRANKLY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

07:19:06.785 --> 07:19:09.256
THOSE VIDEOS FROM THE SECURITY 
CAMERA ANGLE KIND OF BROUGHT IT 

07:19:09.489 --> 07:19:12.114
HOME TO THEM AND SHOWED HOW 
CLOSE THEY WERE AND THE PEOPLE 

07:19:12.351 --> 07:19:15.185
THAT GOT AS CLOSE AS THEY DID 
HAD INTENT. THEY CAME HERE WITH 

07:19:15.421 --> 07:19:19.742
A PREFACE AND THAT IS WHAT THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 

07:19:19.973 --> 07:19:22.570
TRYING TO TELL EVERYONE IS THAT 
THE WORDS THAT DONALD TRUMP SAID

07:19:22.802 --> 07:19:25.890
THAT ONLY ON THE EARLY PART OF 
JANUARY 6 BUT ALSO LEADING UP TO

07:19:26.127 --> 07:19:30.090
-- I THINK WE ARE GOING TO 
LISTEN TO CHUCK SCHUMER.

07:19:35.498 --> 07:19:38.764
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE ON BREAK TO DINNER. I 
DON'T THINK MANY OF US FEEL LIKE

07:19:39.022 --> 07:19:41.341
EATING DINNER. IT WAS GUT 
WRENCHING. THE BRAVERY OF OUR 

07:19:41.573 --> 07:19:43.698
POLICE OFFICERS IS INCREDIBLE. 
IT WAS COMPELLING. AND I JUST 

07:19:43.929 --> 07:19:46.284
HOPE THAT OUR REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES HAVE AN OPEN MIND AS 

07:19:46.518 --> 07:19:48.518
A LOOK TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE 
SEEING TODAY.

07:19:52.131 --> 07:19:55.825
THE MANAGERS MADE AN 
OVERWHELMINGLY COMPELLING CASE 

07:19:56.057 --> 07:19:58.057
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.

07:20:16.144 --> 07:20:18.144
--

07:20:24.038 --> 07:20:26.268
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO REACTION ABOUT 
WHAT MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK 

07:20:26.503 --> 07:20:28.612
SCHUMER SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL I FEEL LIKE HE FELT HE 

07:20:28.847 --> 07:20:31.698
HAD THE, BECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF 
THE SENATORS WE SAW IN THAT 

07:20:31.933 --> 07:20:34.738
NEVER BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGE WHERE 
YOU SEE JUST HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO

07:20:34.981 --> 07:20:37.920
DANGER. SO HE DID COMMENT ON 
WHAT THAT FELT LIKE AND HE 

07:20:38.154 --> 07:20:40.154
BELIEVES THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS ARE DEALING WITH AND 

07:20:40.342 --> 07:20:43.181
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB AT 
LETTING PEOPLE HOW NO HOW BAD 

07:20:43.414 --> 07:20:45.414
THE SITUATION WAS.

07:20:47.733 --> 07:20:50.531
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING
IS SHOWING THERE WAS INTENT AND 

07:20:50.764 --> 07:20:53.616
PURPOSE THAT MANY OF THESE MEN 
AND WOMEN AS WELL WHO WERE IN 

07:20:53.852 --> 07:20:56.672
THE GROUP CAME WITH WEAPONS. 
THERE WAS A MAN WHO, IN ONE 

07:20:56.915 --> 07:21:00.916
EARLY VIDEO WE SHOT A BIT AGO, 
CAME IN WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND 

07:21:01.156 --> 07:21:03.156
WHEN HE BROKE THROUGH,

07:21:05.623 --> 07:21:08.379
HE AND THE OTHERS WERE ABLE TO 
PULL OTHERS THROUGH WHO ARE 

07:21:08.618 --> 07:21:11.195
TRYING TO BREAK OTHER DOORS AND 
WINDOWS. SO THERE WAS INTENT AND

07:21:11.437 --> 07:21:17.894
PURPOSE. WE SEE THE MAN WITH THE
ZIP TIES AND HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO

07:21:18.125 --> 07:21:20.626
SOME SENATORS WHO HAD GOTTEN 
AWAY TOWARD THE END OF THE 

07:21:20.857 --> 07:21:23.887
EVACUATION. THIS IS SHOWING THAT
THERE WAS PREMEDITATION. IT 

07:21:24.117 --> 07:21:26.504
DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY IN THE 
ENTIRE GROUP OR THE ENTIRE GROUP

07:21:26.735 --> 07:21:28.735
OF PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THESE

07:21:31.832 --> 07:21:34.883
WERE GOING TO BE VIOLENT BUT IT 
IS SHOWING YOU THERE WAS A LEVEL

07:21:35.121 --> 07:21:38.084
OF COORDINATION AMONG SOME OF 
THESE PEOPLE AND WE ARE SEEING 

07:21:38.324 --> 07:21:40.422
SOME FBI REPORTS COMING OUT NOW 
SHOWING THE THINKING

07:21:43.972 --> 07:21:46.606
THE PEOPLE HAD AND HOW THEY ARE 
SAYING THEY CAME HERE BECAUSE 

07:21:46.837 --> 07:21:48.957
THEIR PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, ASKED THEM TO DO THIS SO 

07:21:49.187 --> 07:21:51.187
I BELIEVE I MENTIONED IT EARLIER
BUT WE ALSO

07:21:56.528 --> 07:21:58.892
LEARNED THAT THE MAN WHO INVADED
SPEAKER PELOSI'S OFFICE AND PUT 

07:21:59.136 --> 07:22:01.730
HIS FEET ON THE DESK AT A 
HIGH-VOLTAGE STUN GUN ON HIS 

07:22:01.963 --> 07:22:04.537
BELT. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAME 
HERE NOT JUST FOR A PASSIONATE 

07:22:04.774 --> 07:22:07.602
SHOW OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL. THEY 
CAME HERE WITH MATERIALS TO DO 

07:22:07.847 --> 07:22:11.552
HARM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOM HAMBURGER, YOU HAVE BEEN 

07:22:11.786 --> 07:22:15.329
REPORTING ON SORT OF THE ROLE IN
THE PROCESS HERE RIGHT NOW.

07:22:19.518 --> 07:22:22.618
THIS IS NOT SORT OF A CLASSIC 
CRIMINAL TRIAL IN THAT THIS IS A

07:22:22.852 --> 07:22:24.723
POLITICAL TRIAL BUT THERE ARE 
VERY IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL 

07:22:24.724 --> 07:22:26.724
QUESTIONS AT STAKE HERE SO

07:22:29.393 --> 07:22:31.969
WHAT DO THESE JURORS, THE 
SENATORS NEED TO BE SORT OF 

07:22:32.201 --> 07:22:34.201
WEIGHING IN SORT OF BURDEN OF 
PROOF?

07:22:37.380 --> 07:22:40.351
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WILL THAT IS SUCH A GOOD 
QUESTION AND YOU ARE RIGHT, OF 

07:22:40.583 --> 07:22:46.091
COURSE THAT THIS IS NOT A 
TRADITIONAL TRIAL. IT IS PART OF

07:22:46.335 --> 07:22:48.451
OUR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL
STRUCTURE AND ONE OF THE THINGS 

07:22:48.682 --> 07:22:51.898
THAT CAME HOME TO ALL OF US I 
THINK AND THIS WAS THE INTENT. 

07:22:52.137 --> 07:22:54.137
MANY MEMBERS OF THIS JURY WERE 
THEMSELVES

07:22:58.786 --> 07:23:02.258
ACTORS, PARTICIPANTS IN THE 
DRAMA THAT WE SAW UNFOLD HERE. 

07:23:03.223 --> 07:23:08.606
SO I KNOW FROM TALKING WITH SOME
OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS TEAM JUST 

07:23:08.839 --> 07:23:13.266
BEFORE THIS LAST SEGMENT, THEY 
VIEWED WHAT THEY WERE SHOWING US

07:23:13.502 --> 07:23:15.502
PERHAPS

07:23:19.175 --> 07:23:21.408
THE MOST STARTLING AND EFFECTIVE
MATERIAL THAT COULD BE PRESENTED

07:23:21.640 --> 07:23:23.661
TO THESE JURORS. THEY ARE 
TARGETING PARTICULARLY THE 17 

07:23:23.892 --> 07:23:29.532
REPUBLICAN VOTES THAT THEY NEED 
TO CONVICT DONALD TRUMP. PART OF

07:23:29.762 --> 07:23:34.848
WHAT THEY WANTED TO DISPLAY 
TODAY AND PART OF WHAT I THOUGHT

07:23:35.078 --> 07:23:38.546
THEY SHOWED QUITE EFFECTIVELY 
WAS JUST HOW CLOSE IS MEMBERS OF

07:23:38.777 --> 07:23:43.339
THE SENATE, THESE JURORS CAME TO
HARM COMING TO SERIOUS DANGER 

07:23:43.568 --> 07:23:49.037
FROM THOSE WHO, FROM THE MOB 
THAT WAS ASSAULTING THE CAPITAL.

07:23:49.270 --> 07:23:54.924
ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS TEAM SHOWED ME THAT HE 

07:23:55.155 --> 07:23:59.571
THOUGHT MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 
WOULD BE SURPRISED THEMSELVES TO

07:23:59.799 --> 07:24:04.918
LEARN HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO THE
MOB AND THERE WAS THAT DRAMATIC 

07:24:05.153 --> 07:24:10.303
SEQUENCE WHERE YOU SAW THE 
SENATORS BEING LET OUT, SOME OF 

07:24:10.535 --> 07:24:14.290
THEM PUTTING SHOULDERS ON EACH 
OTHER'S ARMS AS THEY WERE 

07:24:14.523 --> 07:24:16.523
LEADING OUT, TAKING

07:24:19.260 --> 07:24:23.041
THEM FROM THE SENATE CHAMBERS. 
CAPITOL POLICE WERE GUARDING 

07:24:23.298 --> 07:24:27.048
THEM AND REPRESENTATIVE SWALWELL
REPORTS THERE WERE  ONLY 48 

07:24:27.423 --> 07:24:29.423
STEPS FROM THE MOB.

07:24:34.390 --> 07:24:37.649
SO ALL OF THIS IS WHAT GOES IN 
OF COURSE TO A PRESENTATION TO A

07:24:37.881 --> 07:24:39.881
JURY. IT IS PARTLY

07:24:44.852 --> 07:24:46.997
THERE ARE THEATRICS INVOLVED, 
EMOTION INVOLVED AND YOU DO WANT

07:24:47.236 --> 07:24:49.629
TO REACH BOTH THE EMOTION AND 
PERSONAL INTERESTS OF THE JUROR.

07:24:49.862 --> 07:24:55.214
I THOUGHT THESE, THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS STRUCK A VERY EFFECTIVE

07:24:55.449 --> 07:24:59.094
TONE TODAY MIXING A FACTUAL AND 
IN SOME WAYS, UNDERSTATED 

07:24:59.333 --> 07:25:06.220
PRESENTATION WITH THE EMOTION WE
SAW CONGRESSWOMAN MADELEINE DEAN

07:25:06.453 --> 07:25:09.919
FROM PENNSYLVANIA SHE RECALLED 
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6, BREAK 

07:25:10.151 --> 07:25:13.236
DOWN EMOTIONALLY. ALL OF THAT IS
PART OF MAKING AN EFFECTIVE 

07:25:13.478 --> 07:25:15.788
CASE. BUT I THINK WHAT IT COMES 
DOWN TO IS

07:25:20.554 --> 07:25:23.338
WHAT ONE OF THE MANAGER TEAMS 
SAID TO ME JUST BEFORE, HE SAID,

07:25:23.572 --> 07:25:25.906
"THE BEST WAY TO SUMMARIZE OUR 
CASE, WHAT WE ARE PRESENTING 

07:25:26.140 --> 07:25:28.625
HERE IS THAT IT WAS DONALD 
TRUMP, QUOTING LIZ CHENEY, THE 

07:25:28.857 --> 07:25:32.907
REPUBLICAN LEADER, "IT WAS 
DONALD TRUMP WHO ASSEMBLED THE 

07:25:33.143 --> 07:25:35.721
MOB, LIT THE FLAME OF THIS 
ATTACK AND "SO YOU WANT, THEY 

07:25:35.966 --> 07:25:38.098
HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TODAY A SORT 
OF SYSTEMATIC FASHION

07:25:42.421 --> 07:25:44.978
THE NATURE OF THE ATTACK, HOW 
SEVERE IT WAS AND LINKED IT 

07:25:45.206 --> 07:25:47.806
ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENTATIONS 
EARLIER TODAY TO DONALD TRUMP'S 

07:25:48.508 --> 07:25:52.092
WORDS AND DONALD TRUMP'S 
ACTIONS. 

07:25:52.093 --> 07:25:54.093
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S NOW BRING IN

07:26:04.611 --> 07:26:06.715
OUR COLLEAGUE, HANNAH JEWELL WHO
HAS BEEN REPORTING ON THE 

07:26:06.947 --> 07:26:09.090
AMERICANS WHO MADE UP THAT MOB 
THAT ATTACKED THE CAPITAL. 

07:26:09.323 --> 07:26:11.323
HANNAH, THE PROSECUTION RELIED 
TODAY ON COURT DOCUMENTS AND 

07:26:11.474 --> 07:26:13.848
INTERVIEWS AND EVEN SOCIAL MEDIA
POST FROM MEMBERS OF THAT MOD 

07:26:14.086 --> 07:26:16.344
WHO CITED PRESIDENT TRUMP AS 
THEIR MOTIVATION FOR ACTION SO 

07:26:16.579 --> 07:26:18.464
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD TODAY THAT 
STANDS OUT? 

07:26:18.465 --> 07:26:20.807
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN SEE HOW THE 
STATEMENTS FROM RIOTERS  ARE 

07:26:21.035 --> 07:26:23.370
USED TO CREATE A TIMELINE OF 
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AND WE 

07:26:23.601 --> 07:26:26.776
CONTINUE TO LEARN ABOUT WHO 
THESE RIOTERS ARE AND  HOW THEY 

07:26:27.007 --> 07:26:32.395
FELT OVERTIME BY THE PRESIDENT 
SPECIFICALLY SO WE HAD VIRGIN 

07:26:32.624 --> 07:26:34.485
ISLAND DELEGATE AND IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGER, STACEY PLASKETT WHO 

07:26:34.486 --> 07:26:39.585
DREW A LINE FROM THE CAPITAL 
ATTACK CAPITOL ATTACK BACK TO 

07:26:39.830 --> 07:26:42.065
TIMES WHEN TRUMP SUPPORTERS HAD 
DONE ISLAND ACTS AND RECEIVED 

07:26:42.295 --> 07:26:44.295
THE PRAISE AND RECOVERING

07:26:47.523 --> 07:26:49.523
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT.

07:26:55.384 --> 07:26:57.466
AND THEN IN OCTOBER WHEN TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS APPEARED TO ATTEMPT 

07:26:57.831 --> 07:27:01.119
TO RUN A BUS OFF THE FREEWAY IN 
TEXAS AND SHE ALSO THEN SHARED A

07:27:01.353 --> 07:27:03.722
TRUMP TWEET ON OCTOBER 31 THAT 
SHOWED THAT INCIDENT WITH THE 

07:27:03.951 --> 07:27:06.966
WORDS THAT HE LOVED TEXAS, TEXAS
MUSIC BUT HE ADDED TO IT, IT WAS

07:27:07.200 --> 07:27:09.200
VERY FESTIVE AND CELEBRATORY AND

07:27:13.051 --> 07:27:15.377
THE NEXT DAY HE TWEETED AGAIN, 
"IN MY OPINION, THESE PATRIOTS 

07:27:15.612 --> 07:27:17.612
DID NOTHING WRONG." SO SHE 
REALLY SHOWED HOW THESE 

07:27:17.787 --> 07:27:19.787
INCIDENTS

07:27:26.201 --> 07:27:28.319
STEPPED UP EACH TIME THEY 
RECEIVED THIS FEEDBACK FROM THE 

07:27:28.550 --> 07:27:30.550
PRESIDENT. SHE SHOWED HOW THE 
ORGANIZER OF THAT SO-CALLED 

07:27:30.663 --> 07:27:33.698
TRUMP TRAIN THAT TRIED TO RUN A 
BUS OFF THE FREEWAY IN TEXAS, A 

07:27:33.930 --> 07:27:36.617
CAPITAL RIOTER NAMED KEITH LEE 
WENT ON TO FUND RAISE FOR THE 

07:27:36.850 --> 07:27:38.850
JANUARY 6 ATTACK

07:27:43.512 --> 07:27:46.316
AND ON THAT MORNING OF JANUARY 
6, HE USED A BULLHORN TO DIRECT 

07:27:46.688 --> 07:27:48.819
THE CROWD SHOUTING THAT THEY 
NEEDED TO SURROUND THE CAPITAL 

07:27:49.070 --> 07:27:52.086
AND IT IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW
THE RIOTERS WERE ABLE TO BUILD 

07:27:52.319 --> 07:27:54.878
UP THEIR RESOURCES  FIRST OF ALL
AND ALSO THEIR INSPIRATION AND 

07:27:55.115 --> 07:27:57.138
THEIR ACUITY OVERTIME AND ALSO 
MENTIONED TRUMP TWEETED ON 

07:27:57.373 --> 07:28:00.185
JANUARY 12, "WE HAVE JUST BEGUN 
TO FIGHT "JUST BEFORE THAT DAY 

07:28:00.425 --> 07:28:02.425
IN MID DECEMBER SO-CALLED 
MILLION IN MARCH. THERE HAVE 

07:28:02.515 --> 07:28:07.911
BEEN A LOT OF VIOLENCE AFTER 
THAT RALLY ACROSS DOWNTOWN DC 

07:28:08.139 --> 07:28:11.394
AND BEYOND. THIS INCLUDES A 
PROUD BOY LEADER WHO VANDALIZED 

07:28:11.946 --> 07:28:15.467
CHURCHES AND WAS ARRESTED.

07:28:19.028 --> 07:28:22.061
THERE WAS A LIVE STREAM FROM THE
PROUD BOYS ON THE DAY OF THE 

07:28:22.290 --> 07:28:24.394
CAPITOL RIOT. THEY MENTIONED HIS
ARREST AS PART OF THEIR 

07:28:24.624 --> 07:28:27.029
MOTIVATION AND ALSO REFERENCED 
THEIR MEMBERS BEING STABBED

07:28:31.812 --> 07:28:33.939
COME UP PEOPLE WERE STABBED IN 
THE VIOLENCE FOLLOWING DECEMBER 

07:28:34.177 --> 07:28:37.260
12. IN FACT WE HAD REPORTED IN A
POST THAT SOME TABLETS -- THE 

07:28:37.500 --> 07:28:40.339
PROUD BOYS WHO HAD BEEN AT THE 
CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6 HAD TURNED 

07:28:40.570 --> 07:28:45.720
ON DC POLICE AS REVENGE FOR THE 
STABBING AND INDICATED THAT IN 

07:28:45.953 --> 07:28:50.767
THEIR STANCE CHANCE. IT ALSO 
REFERENCED MANY TIMES THE 

07:28:51.174 --> 07:28:54.723
PHRASE, "STANBACK AND STANDBY 
"WHERE THE PRESIDENT SAID IN A 

07:28:54.956 --> 07:28:56.956
DEBATE WHERE HE WAS

07:29:00.840 --> 07:29:02.840
NOT CONDEMNING THE PROUD BOYS 
THEMSELVES AND PLUS USED 

07:29:02.936 --> 07:29:04.936
LANGUAGE LIKE SAYING,

07:29:07.796 --> 07:29:09.909
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE TRUMP 
CULTIVATED WERE STANDING BY SO 

07:29:10.137 --> 07:29:12.281
SHE WAS TAKING THAT LANGUAGE 
FROM TRUMP'S OWN WORDS AND 

07:29:12.517 --> 07:29:14.774
SHOWING HOW THE PROUD BOYS 
BASICALLY BUILT UP THEIR SENSE 

07:29:15.026 --> 07:29:17.337
OF COMMUNITY. THE TRUMP TEAM HAS
IMPLIED HE FOR TODAY THAT

07:29:25.462 --> 07:29:27.829
PROOF OF EXACT ADVANCE PLANNING 
MIGHT EXONERATE HIM IN THE BLAME

07:29:28.071 --> 07:29:30.382
BUT IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TODAY 
ARE SHOWING IT CAN ALSO MEAN THE

07:29:30.615 --> 07:29:32.263
OPPOSITE, REFERENCING 
WALKIE-TALKIES USED BY THE PROUD

07:29:32.264 --> 07:29:36.333
BOYS AND OTHER GROUPS, FOCUSING 
ON GEAR AND TACTICAL GEAR AS 

07:29:36.709 --> 07:29:38.709
ROGER MENTIONED EARLIER.

07:29:42.507 --> 07:29:45.320
THE FLEX CUFFS SO THE ZIP TIE 
HANDCUFFS WE SAW IN THE PHOTOS 

07:29:45.557 --> 07:29:48.166
AND ALSO SHARED POSTS WEEKS 
BEFORE THE ATTACK ON THE

07:29:51.956 --> 07:29:56.260
MESSAGE BOARD THAT HAS SINCE 
GONE OFF-LINE. THEY HAVE BROUGHT

07:29:56.496 --> 07:29:59.308
UP THE FACT THAT THE TRUMP TEAM 
WAS AWARE OF THIS PLANNING AND 

07:29:59.543 --> 07:30:03.399
THE MANAGERS ALSO REFERENCED THE
POST'S REPORTING OF THE FBI'S 

07:30:04.058 --> 07:30:07.169
KNOWLEDGE AND WARNING OF A 
SO-CALLED WAR AT THE CAPITAL. 

07:30:07.402 --> 07:30:13.248
THERE WAS PROOF OF THIS WHICH 
MANY RIOTERS ACTED IN THEIR 

07:30:13.916 --> 07:30:17.828
BEHAVIORS  BEFORE, DURING AND 
AFTER THE RIOTS AND THIS IS AN 

07:30:18.201 --> 07:30:20.201
IMPUNITY THAT DEMOCRATS HAD 
ALLEGED

07:30:23.392 --> 07:30:25.729
THEY BELIEVED THEY WERE ACTING 
ON THE ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT 

07:30:25.960 --> 07:30:31.589
AND INDEED THE SUMMIT OF THAT 
SOME OF THE RIOTERS  HAVE 

07:30:31.992 --> 07:30:34.073
EXPLICITLY SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOM I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK 

07:30:34.303 --> 07:30:37.281
IN ONE MORE TIME BEFORE WE LET 
YOU GO. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

07:30:37.518 --> 07:30:39.852
THE BURDEN OF PROOF AND WHAT THE
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS NEED TO 

07:30:40.081 --> 07:30:42.239
SORT OF CONVINCE THESE JURORS, 
THE SENATORS OFF BUT TOM,

07:30:46.230 --> 07:30:48.916
WHAT IS THE HARDEST PART FOR 
THEM? IS IT MAKING A DIRECT 

07:30:49.159 --> 07:30:51.011
CORRELATION FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S WORDS TO THE ACTIONS 

07:30:51.012 --> 07:30:55.276
THAT THE ATTACKERS TOOK? IS IT 
COUNTERING THE FREE-SPEECH 

07:30:56.011 --> 07:31:01.053
CLAIMS THAT HIS DEFENSE TEAM WAS
MAKING YESTERDAY? WHAT DO THEY 

07:31:01.445 --> 07:31:03.861
SEE AS THEIR TOUGHEST CHARGE 
HERE? 

07:31:03.862 --> 07:31:11.775
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN I ASKED MEMBERS OF THE 
MANAGER'S TEAM WHAT THEIR 

07:31:12.242 --> 07:31:14.242
IS GOING INTO

07:31:16.927 --> 07:31:19.306
AS THE TRIAL OPENED THIS WEEK, I
HAD A ONE-WORD ANSWER, 

07:31:20.001 --> 07:31:22.976
CONVICTION. SO THEY ARE, AS WE 
DISCUSSED

07:31:26.770 --> 07:31:29.225
, TARGETING THOSE 17 REPUBLICAN 
SENATE VOTES THAT THEY WOULD 

07:31:29.472 --> 07:31:32.819
NEED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. 
WHAT IS THE HARDEST CHALLENGE? 

07:31:33.060 --> 07:31:36.466
AT THE MOMENT, THE BULK OF THE 
MAJORITY OF THE REPUBLICAN 

07:31:36.751 --> 07:31:41.115
SENATORS ARE TAKING THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFRAMP. THAT IS,

07:31:41.348 --> 07:31:43.348
THEY ARE BUYING THE ARGUMENT

07:31:48.805 --> 07:31:51.644
THAT IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO 
TRY A PRESIDENT ONCE HE HAS LEFT

07:31:51.876 --> 07:31:53.876
OFFICE.

07:31:56.377 --> 07:31:59.413
IT IS A WAY FOR THEM TO, IF YOU 
ADOPT THAT APPROACH, WHICH SOME 

07:31:59.650 --> 07:32:01.512
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS HAVE, 
BUT THE CONSENSUS MOSTLY LIES 

07:32:01.513 --> 07:32:03.962
WITH THOSE WHO SEE IT 
DIFFERENTLY. BUT IF YOU ADOPT 

07:32:04.193 --> 07:32:09.000
THAT APPROACH, IT MEANS THIS 
TRIAL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WE 

07:32:09.232 --> 07:32:11.473
CAN'T CONVICT A FORMER 
PRESIDENT. THEREFORE, THE 

07:32:12.009 --> 07:32:16.815
EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE BEING ASKED
TO EXAMINE IS IMMATERIAL. SO YOU

07:32:17.539 --> 07:32:22.803
COULD ARGUE AT THE FRONT END 
THAT THE BIGGEST HURDLE THEY 

07:32:23.042 --> 07:32:25.123
FACE IS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL 
ARGUMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE SAW, 

07:32:25.355 --> 07:32:29.198
THAT IS WHAT THE MANAGERS DEALT 
WITH ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE 

07:32:29.432 --> 07:32:31.432
OPENING OF THIS TRIAL. THE 
CONSENSUS

07:32:39.781 --> 07:32:42.723
, EVEN THE CONSENSUS FROM DONALD
TRUMP IS WE REPORTED IT IN THE 

07:32:42.964 --> 07:32:45.049
WASHINGTON POST IS THAT THE 
DEMOCRATIC MANAGERS DID THE MORE

07:32:45.282 --> 07:32:47.154
EFFECTIVE JOB IN MAKING A 
CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT. BUT 

07:32:47.155 --> 07:32:49.477
HAVING SAID THAT, THE OTHER 
THING THESE MANAGERS NEED TO DO 

07:32:49.720 --> 07:32:52.762
IS DO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
EARLIER IN A TRIAL. BE 

07:32:52.996 --> 07:32:57.962
CONVINCING. GET THROUGH THE 
RESISTANCE OF POLITICAL AND EVEN

07:33:00.480 --> 07:33:05.214
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT TO 
SORT OF PENETRATE TO THE HEART 

07:33:05.445 --> 07:33:07.445
OF THE MATTER. TODAY, THEY 
SHOWED

07:33:12.757 --> 07:33:15.110
OR THEIR PLAN WAS TO SHOW 
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, MEMBERS 

07:33:15.348 --> 07:33:17.456
OF THIS JURY INFORMATION AND 
MATERIAL THEY HAD NEVER SEEN 

07:33:17.689 --> 07:33:19.689
BEFORE ABOUT A, THE RISK 
UNDERTAKEN AND SUFFERED AND 

07:33:19.902 --> 07:33:21.902
UNDERTAKEN BY

07:33:30.708 --> 07:33:33.296
CAPITOL HILL POLICE AND TWO, THE
RISK, THE BRUSH WITH DANGER THEY

07:33:33.527 --> 07:33:36.072
THEMSELVES FACED FROM THIS MOB 
SO ONE OF THE THOUGHTS IS THAT, 

07:33:36.305 --> 07:33:39.590
ONE OF THEIR GOALS TODAY WAS TO 
SORT OF PENETRATE REPUBLICAN 

07:33:39.834 --> 07:33:42.081
RESISTANCE, IF YOU WILL. GET 
THEM TO PAY ATTENTION AND 

07:33:42.310 --> 07:33:49.327
REALIZE HOW THIS AFFECTED THE 
VITAL INSTITUTION OF THE U.S. 

07:33:49.563 --> 07:33:53.037
SENATE, U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED WORK 

07:33:53.446 --> 07:33:57.973
OF READING THE ELECTORAL BALLOTS
ON JANUARY 6 AND ALSO TO LOOK AT

07:33:59.902 --> 07:34:02.313
THE SOURCE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY
INSURRECTION THAT THEY 

07:34:02.541 --> 07:34:10.110
THEMSELVES OBSERVED AND SO THE 
TASK BEFORE THEM IS BOTH LEGAL 

07:34:10.342 --> 07:34:14.789
AND CONSTITUTIONAL AND ALSO HAS 
AN EMOTIONAL AND AS WE HEARD 

07:34:15.024 --> 07:34:17.024
TODAY, KIND OF A PATRIOTIC

07:34:23.620 --> 07:34:24.791
TONE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOM HAMBURGER, INVESTIGATIVE 

07:34:24.792 --> 07:34:26.211
REPORTER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US. 

07:34:26.212 --> 07:34:28.989
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES LET'S GO BACK TO FOR 
SOME REACTION TO WHAT TOM JUST 

07:34:29.221 --> 07:34:31.221
SAID. THE JOB OF CONVINCING 17 
REPUBLICANS

07:34:34.914 --> 07:34:36.914
THE PRESIDENT,

07:34:42.893 --> 07:34:45.845
TO CONVICT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES IS A BIG JOB. IN 

07:34:46.084 --> 07:34:49.740
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS LINES, IS 
TODAY THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY? IS

07:34:49.971 --> 07:34:52.038
THERE STILL MORE EVIDENCE THEY 
NEED TO LAYOUT INCLUDING WHAT 

07:34:52.268 --> 07:34:54.338
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF THE INITIAL ROUND 

07:34:54.569 --> 07:34:57.735
OF THE ATTACK? WHERE DO THEY GO 
FROM HERE I GUESS IN TERMS OF 

07:34:57.969 --> 07:35:00.320
TRYING TO BUILD MOMENTUM AND 
KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE CHILLING 

07:35:00.549 --> 07:35:02.549
DETAILS

07:35:10.788 --> 07:35:12.788
THEY SHARED TODAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT, LIBBY 

07:35:12.878 --> 07:35:15.443
AND THE DEFENSE GETS THE LAST 
WORD WHICH THEY KNOW THEY ARE 

07:35:15.676 --> 07:35:18.481
GOING TO GET THEIR 16 HOURS TO 
GO AFTER THIS AND THERE HAVE 

07:35:18.712 --> 07:35:21.407
BEEN SO MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST
FIVE YEARS, REALLY WHERE IT 

07:35:21.658 --> 07:35:23.984
SEEMED LIKE DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT
FOR THE COUNT AND REPUBLICANS 

07:35:24.213 --> 07:35:26.538
WERE TURNING ON HIM AND THEN 
MOMENTUM SORT OF SLIPPED AND 

07:35:26.772 --> 07:35:29.580
FADED AWAY EVEN WITH THIS. YOU 
THINK ABOUT JANUARY 6, JUST OVER

07:35:29.817 --> 07:35:31.817
A MONTH AGO.

07:35:36.812 --> 07:35:42.779
McCONNELL AND -- BOTH SAID TRUMP
DESERVES THIS AND McCONNELL'S 

07:35:43.009 --> 07:35:45.009
WIFE RESIGNING IN PROTEST AND

07:35:49.373 --> 07:35:52.163
THE REST OF THE PARTY A FEW DAYS
LATER DOESN'T REALLY COME ALONG,

07:35:52.402 --> 07:35:55.205
THEY BOTH SORT OF BACKED OFF 
WHAT THEY HAD SAID. AND I THINK 

07:35:55.434 --> 07:35:58.025
A DYNAMIC LIKE THAT IS MOST 
LIKELY TO PLAY OUT HERE WHERE 

07:35:58.255 --> 07:36:00.515
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE HEARING THAT 
THESE SENATORS ARE SITTING, 

07:36:00.754 --> 07:36:04.386
HAVING THEIR DINNER BREAK AND WE
HEARD CHUCK SCHUMER SAY MY 

07:36:04.619 --> 07:36:07.157
NUMBERS, MEMBERS DON'T REALLY 
FEEL LIKE EATING BECAUSE THE 

07:36:07.390 --> 07:36:09.390
VIDEO WAS SO STOMACH TERMING

07:36:17.133 --> 07:36:19.133
TURNING. ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
REPUBLICANS ARE HORRIFIED BY 

07:36:19.245 --> 07:36:22.036
THIS AND HORRIFIED BY THE CLOSE 
CALLS. IF YOU CAN HAVE A SECRET 

07:36:22.269 --> 07:36:25.276
VOTE, I'M NOT SURE THEY WOULD 
GET TO 67 BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST

07:36:25.511 --> 07:36:30.352
HALF A DOZEN SENATE REPUBLICANS 
WHO WOULD LOOK TO CONVICT TRUMP 

07:36:30.584 --> 07:36:32.701
IF THEY COULD DO SO WITHOUT 
PUTTING THEIR POLITICAL CAREERS 

07:36:32.931 --> 07:36:35.708
AT RISK OR NOT CURRENTLY 
PLANNING TO DO SO AND SO I THINK

07:36:37.573 --> 07:36:39.573
THE GOAL OF THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS, EVERYTHING TOM SAID 

07:36:39.674 --> 07:36:42.019
BUT ALSO TO FORCE THESE MEMBERS 
TO SIT WITH THIS DISCOMFORT 

07:36:42.250 --> 07:36:44.250
OVERNIGHT. TOMORROW THEY WILL 
HEAR MORE ABOUT

07:36:50.826 --> 07:36:53.676
HOW TRUMP DIDN'T ACT AS THIS WAS
ALL PLAYING OUT FOR HOURS AND 

07:36:53.907 --> 07:36:56.263
HOURS. DEMOCRATS WILL MAKE THE 
CASE THAT TRUMP WAS BEING QUITE 

07:36:56.495 --> 07:36:59.079
NEGLIGENT AND SO I THINK THAT 
THERE WERE SOME KIND OF PERRY 

07:36:59.311 --> 07:37:01.312
MASON MOMENTS AS PAUL KANE PUT 
IT EARLIER TODAY.

07:37:05.302 --> 07:37:10.140
WHERE TRUMP MADE REPREHENSIBLE 
COMMENTS ON TAPE. THEY FELL BACK

07:37:10.801 --> 07:37:12.801
IN LINE

07:37:14.807 --> 07:37:17.618
BUT THE QUESTION IS IS THAT 
GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. A LOT OF 

07:37:17.844 --> 07:37:19.844
IT TRUTHFULLY THESE POLITICIANS 
FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE 

07:37:19.962 --> 07:37:24.255
CONSTITUENTS AND THE BASE OF THE
PARTY AND SO ONE OF THE REASONS 

07:37:24.484 --> 07:37:26.484
THEY HAVE ALWAYS COME BACK TO 
TRUMP IS

07:37:30.181 --> 07:37:33.118
THE BASE OF THE PARTY HAS BEEN 
WITH HIM AND PERHAPS THAT CAN 

07:37:33.354 --> 07:37:35.354
START TO CHANGE.

07:37:40.100 --> 07:37:42.645
. TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A TWITTER 
MEGAPHONE ANYMORE, IS NOT OUT 

07:37:42.877 --> 07:37:44.877
THERE PASSING POLICY AND 
ULTIMATELY, THERE ARE GOING TO 

07:37:44.977 --> 07:37:47.532
BE A COUPLE OF MEMBERS ON THE 
RIGHT WHO FACE REALLY TOUGH 

07:37:47.762 --> 07:37:51.929
VOTES OF CONSCIENCE AND THE MAY 
NOT DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 

07:37:52.452 --> 07:37:57.505
WHICH IS PRIVATELY VOTE TO 
CONVICT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

07:37:57.740 --> 07:37:59.615
WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
AFTER TODAY. 

07:37:59.616 --> 07:38:01.967
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING HANNAH BACK INTO 
THE CONVERSATION. WE HEARD FROM 

07:38:02.218 --> 07:38:04.510
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER PLASKETT  
ABOUT ONE OF THEM IN CHARGE, 

07:38:04.741 --> 07:38:08.212
LIAM CALHOUN WHO IS A LAWYER AND
SHE SHARED A FACEBOOK POST HE 

07:38:08.443 --> 07:38:11.144
WROTE TALKING ABOUT "CRAZY 
NANCY."

07:38:21.948 --> 07:38:23.838
AND DELEGATE SWALWELL REMINDED 
EVERYBODY -- PLASKETT REMINDED 

07:38:23.839 --> 07:38:26.145
EVERYBODY THAT IS WHAT DONALD 
TRUMP CALLS THE SPEAKER OF THE 

07:38:26.375 --> 07:38:28.487
HOUSE, NANCY PELOSI AND THE 
FACEBOOK POST DESCRIBES  GOING 

07:38:28.728 --> 07:38:30.728
THROUGH THE HOUSE AND KICKING 
DOWN A DOOR

07:38:34.553 --> 07:38:36.666
TO NANCY PELOSI'S OFFICE AND 
ONLY TURNING WAY BECAUSE A 

07:38:36.898 --> 07:38:39.691
S.W.A.T. TEAM SHOWED UP. THE 
MANNER OF THE FACEBOOK POST IS 

07:38:39.945 --> 07:38:43.183
SORT OF BRAGGING AND CELEBRATING

07:38:47.134 --> 07:38:49.134
IN THE ATTACK.

07:38:55.246 --> 07:38:57.479
WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION OF THESE
BOASTFUL SOCIAL MEDIA SHARES? 

07:38:57.715 --> 07:38:59.715
THAT ONE AND THE ONES THAT 
RICHARD BARNETT PHOTOGRAPHED 

07:38:59.830 --> 07:39:01.830
SECRETLY

07:39:06.648 --> 07:39:09.343
IN NANCY PELOSI'S OFFICE. HOW IS
THAT COMING BACK TO HAUNT THESE 

07:39:09.584 --> 07:39:11.584
INDIVIDUALS CRIMINALLY AS WELL 
AS EVIDENCE IN THIS SENATE 

07:39:11.680 --> 07:39:13.538
TRIAL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING

07:39:13.539 --> 07:39:15.869
PARTS OF JANUARY 6 FOR ME 
PERSONALLY JUST WATCHING AT HOME

07:39:16.104 --> 07:39:19.658
WAS SEEING HOW, AT THE END OF 
THE DAY, ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE 

07:39:19.891 --> 07:39:22.498
BEING ALLOWED TO LEAVE AND WERE 
SORT OF JOVIAL AND THERE WAS 

07:39:22.734 --> 07:39:28.745
THIS DOORS BEING HELD FOR THEM 
TO LEAVE THE CAPITAL AND YOU CAN

07:39:28.974 --> 07:39:33.249
SEE IN THAT SENSE HOW MUCH, IT 
FELT LIKE PEOPLE LEAVING A 

07:39:33.481 --> 07:39:35.567
FOOTBALL GAME, PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN
AWAY WITH SOMETHING. YOU COULD 

07:39:35.809 --> 07:39:38.545
TELL THE ENERGY OF THE PEOPLE 
WAS THAT THEY MAY REALLY COULD 

07:39:38.774 --> 07:39:43.621
GET AWAY WITH MURDER, FRANKLY. 
AS THREE PEOPLE DID THAT

07:39:51.785 --> 07:39:55.474
, THEY DID DIE THAT DAY AND A 
LOT OF THE SHOCKING THING IS WHY

07:39:55.706 --> 07:39:58.034
ARE THESE PEOPLE BEING ARRESTED 
BECAUSE WE WATCHED LIVE ALL OF 

07:39:58.268 --> 07:40:00.268
THIS VIOLENCE HAPPEN BUT NOW 
THEY ARE

07:40:07.304 --> 07:40:11.234
-- SOME OF THE LAWYERS OF THE 
CAPITAL RIOTERS ARE WRITING IN 

07:40:11.470 --> 07:40:13.840
THEIR DEFENSE THAT THEY WERE LED
ASTRAY AND BY TRUMP,

07:40:18.476 --> 07:40:21.110
AND A LAWYER WROTE HIS CLIENT 
WAS FACING YEARS AND YEARS IN 

07:40:21.341 --> 07:40:25.371
PRISON AND WHILE TRUMP GOT TO 
LIVE IN LUXURY WAS THE GIST OF 

07:40:25.605 --> 07:40:30.769
IT. SO YOU SEE THESE SORTS OF 
IMPUNITY OF THE RIOTERS BUT THAT

07:40:31.017 --> 07:40:37.637
END OF THE DAY, THERE ARE AROUND
200 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED

07:40:37.865 --> 07:40:39.865
WITH EVERYTHING FROM

07:40:45.185 --> 07:40:47.500
ENTRY TO LESSER CLOCK CRIMES TO 
A CONSPIRACY, A MUCH MORE 

07:40:47.730 --> 07:40:49.727
SERIOUS CHARGE WHICH REQUIRES 
SHOWING EVIDENCE OF PRIOR 

07:40:49.728 --> 07:40:53.624
PLANNING AND CROSSING STATE 
LINES AND CONSPIRING WITH OTHERS

07:40:53.857 --> 07:40:56.777
AS THE CHARGE SAYS AND SO I 
CAN'T HELP BUT ALSO THINK ABOUT 

07:40:57.004 --> 07:41:01.171
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
CONSEQUENCES SLOWLY CATCHING UP 

07:41:01.404 --> 07:41:03.935
WITH THESE RIOTERS FORCING OVER 
THE SUMMER, WE SAW

07:41:08.342 --> 07:41:11.054
PROTESTERS AND MANY WE REPORTED 
ON AND WATCHED IN THE SUMMER OF 

07:41:11.284 --> 07:41:13.611
2020 HOW IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE WERE
ARRESTED AND HOW THEY WORK OFTEN

07:41:14.752 --> 07:41:20.116
VERY AGGRESSIVELY ARRESTED. I 
KNOW THAT YESTERDAY, TRUMP'S 

07:41:20.494 --> 07:41:28.381
ATTORNEY WAS BEGINNING TO BRING 
UP BLACK LIVES MATTER 

07:41:28.618 --> 07:41:31.362
PROTESTERS, SAYING THAT PEOPLE 
HAD EXPRESSED

07:41:35.126 --> 07:41:37.680
SUPPORT FOR THOSE PROTESTS AND 
SAYING THAT IS THE SAME THING AS

07:41:37.911 --> 07:41:40.423
THESE CAPITOL RIOTERS AND  WHILE
WATCHING THIS REAL FRAME BY 

07:41:40.664 --> 07:41:45.690
FRAME, RELIVING OF THE DAY ON 
THIS, YOU SEE THAT COORDINATED 

07:41:46.090 --> 07:41:51.826
VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE 
PARTICULARLY AND IT IS JUST SO, 

07:41:52.059 --> 07:41:56.126
I HAVE TO WONDER, ARE THE TRUMP 
LAWYERS, THE TRUMP TEAM, 

07:41:56.355 --> 07:42:00.017
REWRITING THEIR REBUTTAL OR IF 
THEY COULD JUST STICK ON THIS 

07:42:00.251 --> 07:42:02.251
LINE

07:42:05.653 --> 07:42:08.256
WITH WHAT WE HAVE JUST SEEN, WE 
HAVE SEEN PEOPLE SAYING, SAYING 

07:42:08.489 --> 07:42:10.489
"WHERE ARE YOU NANCY?" IT IS 
REALLY EXPLICIT, INTENTIONAL 

07:42:10.586 --> 07:42:14.054
WISHES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST 
LAWMAKERS. ARE THEY GOING TO 

07:42:14.288 --> 07:42:17.363
STILL SAY THAT IS THE SAME THING
, THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO SUPPORTED 

07:42:18.014 --> 07:42:20.014
RACIAL JUSTICE

07:42:27.169 --> 07:42:29.269
PROTESTERS IN THE SUMMER? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HANNAH, THANK YOU FOR TALKING

07:42:29.500 --> 07:42:31.500
WITH US. RHONDA COLEMAN, 
PIVOTING FROM WHAT HANNAH WAS 

07:42:31.614 --> 07:42:34.319
TALKING ABOUT, WE HAVE DISCUSSED
IN THE PAST HOUR THE THREATS 

07:42:34.550 --> 07:42:36.550
SPECIFICALLY TO THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 

07:42:36.685 --> 07:42:39.402
A LITTLE BIT THE THREATS TO 
SPEAKER PELOSI BUT LET'S GO INTO

07:42:39.636 --> 07:42:42.216
THAT MORE BECAUSE SOME OF THESE 
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THEY SHARED, 

07:42:42.447 --> 07:42:44.447
SOME OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT 
WERE SHARED WERE FRANKLY 

07:42:44.575 --> 07:42:46.575
HORRIFYING

07:42:49.740 --> 07:42:53.713
AND I WANT TO CITE ONE OF THE 
AFFIDAVITS, THE FBI'S AFFIDAVIT 

07:42:54.665 --> 07:43:02.148
AGAINST PIZOLA. IF THEY FOUND  
NANCY PELOSI OR MIKE PENCE, THEY

07:43:02.381 --> 07:43:04.837
WOULD HAVE KILLED THEM. WHERE 
DOES THAT LEAVE THE MEN AND 

07:43:05.068 --> 07:43:09.461
WOMEN IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
INVOLVEMENT? 

07:43:09.462 --> 07:43:11.462
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS

07:43:21.982 --> 07:43:24.987
WHAT WE JUST WATCHED AS IT'S ALL
WHAT IT TOOK TO GET PENCE OFF 

07:43:25.218 --> 07:43:28.020
THE FLOOR AND SECRET SERVICE GOT
HIM OFF THE FLOOR AND HIS FAMILY

07:43:28.260 --> 07:43:31.071
WAS HERE AS WELL AND WE SAW, 
TOO, THE GALLOWS THAT WERE BUILT

07:43:31.302 --> 07:43:34.005
OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL ON THE LAWN 
AND THE CHANCE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA

07:43:34.239 --> 07:43:39.002
VIDEOS SAYING HANG MIKE PENCE, 
HANG MIKE PENCE SO THE 

07:43:39.233 --> 07:43:41.576
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TOOK A FAIR
AMOUNT OF TIME IN THIS LAST 

07:43:41.812 --> 07:43:44.791
PORTION TALKING ABOUT THE THREAT
TO PENCE SO THAT IS SORT OF AN 

07:43:45.285 --> 07:43:47.373
APPEAL TO THE REPUBLICANS IN 
THAT CHAMBER TO THINK ABOUT 

07:43:47.602 --> 07:43:49.602
THAT, THAT THIS WAS THEIR 
ATTORNEY'S VICE PRESIDENT WHO 

07:43:49.694 --> 07:43:52.846
WAS IN AS MUCH DANGER AS THE 
REST OF THEM AND IT ALSO POINTS 

07:43:53.393 --> 07:43:56.814
OUT A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT 
ABOUT JANUARY 6. THE CONTINUITY 

07:43:57.223 --> 07:43:59.303
OF OUR GOVERNMENT, EVERYONE WAS 
HERE. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO 

07:43:59.534 --> 07:44:01.835
THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE, NEXT 
IN LINE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT. 

07:44:02.071 --> 07:44:05.927
HE WAS HERE. AFTER HEARING HIM, 
YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

07:44:06.158 --> 07:44:09.545
SENATE AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
AND THEY WERE HERE. YOU HAVE SO 

07:44:09.774 --> 07:44:11.774
MANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS 
WHO ARE IN LINE

07:44:15.787 --> 07:44:18.138
IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO 
THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE ALL 

07:44:18.367 --> 07:44:20.367
HERE. SO THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING 
THAT WAS OF

07:44:25.140 --> 07:44:27.421
THE NATURE OF A NATIONAL 
SECURITY ISSUE, TOO HAVING ALL 

07:44:27.653 --> 07:44:30.436
THESE PEOPLE HERE AND ALL OF 
THEM IN DANGER SO I THINK THE 

07:44:30.670 --> 07:44:32.761
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CERTAINLY 
WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE LEVEL OF 

07:44:32.990 --> 07:44:36.200
DANGER TO MIKE PENCE AND THE 
FACT THAT HE WAS OR IS PART OF 

07:44:36.437 --> 07:44:39.259
THEIR PARTY AND HE WAS IN REALLY
GREAT DANGER. WHEN YOU READ 

07:44:39.497 --> 07:44:41.832
THESE AFFIDAVITS AND WHEN YOU 
SEE THOSE PHOTOS FROM THE CHANT

07:44:45.813 --> 07:44:47.844
S AND GALLOWS BUILT ON THE 
CAPITOL LAWN. 

07:44:47.845 --> 07:44:50.985
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRIEFLY ON THAT POINT IT DID 
SEEM LIKE DELEGATE PLASKETT WAS 

07:44:51.214 --> 07:44:56.127
MAKING THESE SENATORS , MAKE A 
CHOICE. ARE YOU ONE MIKE PENCE'S

07:44:56.356 --> 07:44:58.356
I DOE RUN DONALD TRUMP'S

07:45:05.275 --> 07:45:07.534
SIDE. SHE REALLY CREATED A 
SCHISM BETWEEN THE TWO, POINT 

07:45:07.766 --> 07:45:09.766
OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
THEM, REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO THE

07:45:09.855 --> 07:45:11.855
PRESIDENT VERSUS THE VICE 
PRESIDENT AND TALKED ABOUT MIKE 

07:45:11.994 --> 07:45:14.491
PENCE'S PATRIOTISM, HIS FAMILY, 
BEING THERE WITH HIM AND REALLY 

07:45:14.725 --> 07:45:19.989
EMPHASIZING HE WAS WITH HIS 
FAMILY. SO WHAT DOES THAT DO 

07:45:20.218 --> 07:45:22.561
POLITICALLY FOR THE SENATORS AS 
THEY LOOK AT THAT DICHOTOMY? 

07:45:22.793 --> 07:45:28.509
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DOES SORT OF POINT OUT 
SOME OF THE DIVISIONS IN THE 

07:45:28.739 --> 07:45:33.738
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THIS WHOLE 
QUESTION OF 

07:45:33.739 --> 07:45:35.255
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  FOR THEIR OWN DO POLITICAL 
THEY FUTURES, REMAIN OR LOYAL DO

07:45:35.256 --> 07:45:36.304
TO THEY DONALD START TRUMP 
TEARING AWAY FOR FROM HIM 

07:45:36.305 --> 07:45:38.361
REASONS OF THEIR AND OWN ISOLATE
POLITICAL FUTURES OR DO THEY 

07:45:38.592 --> 07:45:40.585
START TURN AWAY FROM  HIM AND 
TRUMP AND ISOLATE TRUMP TRUMP IS

07:45:40.586 --> 07:45:41.923
AND AS TRUMPISM. SOMETHING 
SEPARATE FROM THE REPUBLICAN 

07:45:41.924 --> 07:45:44.179
PARTY. I THINK THAT MAY BE AT 
THE HEART OF PERHAPS STACY 

07:45:44.395 --> 07:45:49.480
PLASKETT WAS GETTING THEM TO SEE
IS THAT RIGHT NOW, DONALD TRUMP 

07:45:49.683 --> 07:45:51.722
IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT, HE IS 
NOT THE STANDARD, HOWEVER THEY 

07:45:51.924 --> 07:45:54.962
NEED TO CONSIDER ARE THEY GOING 
TO GO WITH SOMEONE MORE OF AN 

07:45:55.098 --> 07:45:58.067
ESTABLISHED REPUBLICAN THEN MIKE
PENCE AND SEEING THE GREAT 

07:45:58.266 --> 07:46:03.164
DANGER HE IS IN OR WILL THEY 
CONTINUE TRUMP-ISM REPRESENTED 

07:46:03.369 --> 07:46:06.034
AMONG THE PEOPLE THERE WITH THE 
TIES AND  START GUNS IN HERE TO 

07:46:06.450 --> 07:46:09.522
THE DANGER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JOINING US IS JOYCE CALL 

07:46:09.726 --> 07:46:14.403
POLITICAL VIDEO REPORTER. WHAT 
HAS THAT OUT TO YOU IN THIS 

07:46:15.168 --> 07:46:18.607
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU AND RHONDA WILL

07:46:22.997 --> 07:46:25.061
TALKING ABOUT DELEGATE PLASKETT.
SHE HAD THE FLOOR FOR A LARGE 

07:46:25.263 --> 07:46:27.952
PORTION OF THE DAY. HER JOB ON 
THE FLOOR WAS TO WALK THROUGH 

07:46:28.154 --> 07:46:32.643
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THERE 
WERE MOMENTS WHERE SHE WAS 

07:46:32.843 --> 07:46:35.304
WALKING THROUGH THE DETAILS. YOU
CAN SEE THE MODELS OF THE 

07:46:35.506 --> 07:46:39.167
CAPITAL WITH THE RED DOT THAT 
SIGNIFIED THE INSURRECTIONIST 

07:46:39.582 --> 07:46:44.868
WERE GOING IN THE PAST TO THE 
FLOORS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE. 

07:46:45.071 --> 07:46:50.468
SHE HAD THIS MOMENT TOWARDS THE 
END OF HER REMARKS WERE SHE SAID

07:46:53.645 --> 07:46:56.095
LOOKING AT THE MODELS REMINDED 
HER OF THE ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 

07:46:56.300 --> 07:47:01.223
11th. SHE TALKED ABOUT AT THE 
TIME JUST BEING A STAFFER ON THE

07:47:01.420 --> 07:47:04.276
HILL. SHE SAID SHE WAS ON THE 
HOUSE SIDE AND SHE MADE THIS 

07:47:04.481 --> 07:47:08.990
EMOTIONAL AND COMPELLING 
RECOLLECTION OF WHAT THAT DAY 

07:47:09.194 --> 07:47:14.917
WAS LIKE WHEN THE CAPITOL WAS 
ALMOST ATTACKED  AND SHE SAID 

07:47:15.336 --> 07:47:20.263
SHE REMEMBERS THE 44 AMERICANS 
WHO WERE ON BOARD, ONE OF THE 

07:47:20.873 --> 07:47:23.260
HIJACKED PLANES HEADED TOWARDS 
THE CAPITAL THAT ENDED UP BEING 

07:47:23.404 --> 07:47:28.047
DIVERTED. SHE SAID SHE COULD 
HAVE LOST HER LIFE THAT THEY. 

07:47:28.454 --> 07:47:30.501
WHAT SHE WAS DOING IN THAT 
MOMENT WAS DRAWING A COMPARISON 

07:47:30.705 --> 07:47:34.104
BETWEEN THIS ATTACK ON THE 
CAPITAL WHERE A MOB OF TRUMP 

07:47:34.254 --> 07:47:38.465
SUPPORTERS AND SUCCESSFULLY 
ATTACK THE CAPITOL AND ENDED UP 

07:47:38.872 --> 07:47:43.356
BEING A DEADLY MOMENT. THIS 
ATTACK NEARLY HAPPENED WITH 

07:47:44.114 --> 07:47:46.114
FOREIGN TERRORIST

07:47:48.694 --> 07:47:51.138
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THOSE BRAVE 
AMERICANS ON BOARD THAT PLANE ON

07:47:51.340 --> 07:47:54.547
SEPTEMBER 11th. TAKE A LISTEN TO
A BIT MORE OF WHAT SHE HAD TO 

07:47:54.697 --> 07:47:56.697
SAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CAPITOL STANDS BECAUSE OF

07:47:56.862 --> 07:48:01.506
PEOPLE LIKE THAT . THIS CAPITAL 
CONCEIVED BY OUR FOUNDING 

07:48:01.644 --> 07:48:06.879
FATHERS THAT WAS BUILT BY SLAVES
THAT REMAINS THROUGH THE 

07:48:07.093 --> 07:48:13.466
SACRIFICE OF SERVICE, MEN AND 
WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN I 

07:48:14.223 --> 07:48:20.730
THINK OF THAT, AND I THINK OF 
THESE INSURGENTS, THESE IMAGES

07:48:23.911 --> 07:48:29.029
, INCITED BY OUR OWN PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES ATTACKING 

07:48:29.791 --> 07:48:34.695
THIS CAPITAL TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION OF A PRESIDENTIAL 

07:48:34.840 --> 07:48:36.840
ELECTION

07:48:38.223 --> 07:48:42.655
, OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR REPUBLIC.

07:48:46.184 --> 07:48:48.415
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK ONE OF THE MOST 
STRIKING THINGS ABOUT THE TOWN 

07:48:48.622 --> 07:48:50.622
OF TODAY WATCHING THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS PRESENT 

07:48:51.019 --> 07:48:56.401
THEIR ARGUMENTS IS JUST HOW 
MEASURED THEY WERE. THIS IS NOT 

07:48:56.594 --> 07:49:02.170
JUST A DELEGATE PLASKETT BUT WE 
HEARD THIS TOWN REPLICATED 

07:49:02.587 --> 07:49:04.447
THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AS THEY 

07:49:04.448 --> 07:49:06.103
PRESENTED THEIR ARGUMENTS AND 
WALKED SENATORS THROUGH WHAT 

07:49:06.104 --> 07:49:11.430
HAPPENED THAT DAY. THERE WAS NO 
CHARACTERIZATION OF TRUMP BEYOND

07:49:11.629 --> 07:49:15.776
DESCRIBING EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
AND LAYOUT EVIDENCE IMMEDIATELY 

07:49:16.189 --> 07:49:19.652
AFTER TELLING THE STORY OF 
STEP-BY-STEP WHAT HAPPENED THAT 

07:49:19.854 --> 07:49:24.749
DAY AND HOW THE INSURRECTIONIST 
GOT INSIDE THE CAPITOL AND THE 

07:49:24.950 --> 07:49:29.893
VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW ON JANUARY 
6 . IN TERMS OF TALKING 

07:49:30.710 --> 07:49:35.798
9/11, THAT WAS A HORRIFYING DAY 
AND REALLY TIME IN OUR NATIONS 

07:49:35.938 --> 07:49:39.748
HISTORY. ONE THING THAT 
AMERICANS REMEMBER FROM THAT 

07:49:39.949 --> 07:49:42.203
TIME IS HOW UNIFIED THE COUNTRY 
WAS AND I AND THAT DELEGATE 

07:49:42.418 --> 07:49:47.949
PLASKETT AND BRINGING UP 9/11 
WAS REMINDING SENATORS 

07:49:48.361 --> 07:49:50.425
ESPECIALLY ON THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE OF THE UNITY DURING A TIME 

07:49:50.639 --> 07:49:56.585
WHEN THE COUNTRY FACED ATTACKS 
AND SIMILARLY WHEN, REGARDLESS 

07:49:56.799 --> 07:49:59.250
OF WHAT SIDE THE AISLE YOU WERE 
ON, SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT VICE 

07:49:59.455 --> 07:50:04.968
PRESIDENT PENCE FOR A LARGE 
PORTION OF HER SPEECH THAT ALL 

07:50:05.179 --> 07:50:07.243
OF THE MEMBERS AND STAFFERS AND 
REPORTERS IN THAT BUILDING WERE 

07:50:08.007 --> 07:50:12.558
UNDER ATTACK, LIBBY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JALISCO, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

07:50:12.968 --> 07:50:15.416
JAMES, LET'S GO TO YOU TO FOLLOW
UP ON THE POINTS JOYCE WAS 

07:50:15.630 --> 07:50:17.261
MAKING BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY 
IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS THERE 

07:50:17.262 --> 07:50:23.628
ABOUT THE MEASURED TONE AND THE 
EMOTIONAL GUT PUNCHED THE 

07:50:23.826 --> 07:50:27.490
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE MAKING 
TONIGHT. 

07:50:27.491 --> 07:50:29.539
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY, THERE IS NO DOUBT
IT HAD A STRONG, EMOTIONAL 

07:50:29.740 --> 07:50:34.015
EFFECT ON EVERYONE. THE KEY 
CHALLENGE WILL BE FOR TRUMP'S 

07:50:34.217 --> 07:50:38.704
DEFENSE IS TO STIPULATE THAT THE
RIOT WAS TERRIBLE. THEY HAVE TO 

07:50:38.909 --> 07:50:43.227
FOCUS ON THE PROCEDURAL OFF 
RAMPS AND THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON 

07:50:43.431 --> 07:50:49.534
THE IDEA THAT THESE PEOPLE, EVEN
IF THEY WERE PROVOKED BY TRUMP 

07:50:49.942 --> 07:50:54.198
DID NOT ACT ON TRUMP'S BEHALF 
THAT THIS CONDUCT IS 

07:50:54.360 --> 07:50:58.478
INDEFENSIBLE. WE HEARD THAT FROM
BRUCE CASTOR AT THE START OF HIS

07:50:58.636 --> 07:51:01.648
PRESENTATION. HE SAID THEY WOULD
STIPULATE THIS IS TERRIBLE. AS 

07:51:01.849 --> 07:51:06.731
WE ARE SEEING REPORTERS WE TALK,
YOU ARE SEEING SENATORS LIKE TED

07:51:06.934 --> 07:51:13.088
CRUZ ONE OF THE TWO MAIN 
REPUBLICANS LEADING THE 

07:51:13.305 --> 07:51:15.305
OBJECTION TO CERTIFYING THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE SAYING THESE 

07:51:15.473 --> 07:51:19.185
WERE TERRORIST, NONE OF US 
SUPPORT TERRORISM. YOU ARE 

07:51:19.328 --> 07:51:21.328
SEEING REPUBLICANS

07:51:24.154 --> 07:51:28.234
WHO ARE EMOTIONALLY TALKING 
ABOUT HOW EUGENE GOODMAN IS A 

07:51:28.435 --> 07:51:31.703
HERO AND THEY WANT TO BUY HIM A 
BEER. THAT WILL BE THE NEEDLE 

07:51:31.915 --> 07:51:35.617
THEY ARE TRYING TO THREAD. I DO 
NOT KNOW IF THAT WORKS IN THE 

07:51:36.391 --> 07:51:40.330
OPINION BUT THEY ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO LEAN AND HARD ON THE 

07:51:40.533 --> 07:51:43.398
IDEA HARD THAT THEY DO NOT 
CONDONE MISCONDUCT INSIDE THE 

07:51:43.599 --> 07:51:46.137
CAPITOL AND TO SEPARATE  TRUMP 
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

07:51:50.950 --> 07:51:53.594
THAT IS WHY WE SAW MANY HOURS 
THE LENGTH OF THE PREDICATE TO 

07:51:53.797 --> 07:51:56.049
WHAT TRUMP SAID BEFORE EVERYONE 
CAME TO THE CAPITOL  BEFORE WE 

07:51:56.249 --> 07:52:01.807
SELL ALL OF THE IS NEVER BEFORE 
SEEN FOOTAGE THIS EVENING. IT 

07:52:02.017 --> 07:52:07.320
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 
THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE TEAM, 

07:52:07.521 --> 07:52:13.425
WHEN THEY GET THEIR 16 HOURS, 
EXPLAINS TRUMP DOING AND SLOW 

07:52:13.626 --> 07:52:19.875
WALKING ON REQUESTS FOR AID FROM
A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICAN 

07:52:20.028 --> 07:52:22.877
SENATORS THAT ARE NOW JURORS IN 
HIS TRIAL. 

07:52:22.878 --> 07:52:25.135
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, HOW MUCH SORT OF

07:52:28.915 --> 07:52:31.090
SECOND RECONSIDERATION ARE WE 
SEEING FROM REPUBLICANS AT THIS 

07:52:31.232 --> 07:52:35.167
POINT? OBVIOUSLY, LOUISIANA 
SENATOR BILL CASSIDY TOOK A 

07:52:35.313 --> 07:52:39.944
DIFFERENT STANCE ON THE SECOND 
VOTE ESSENTIALLY ON WHETHER THIS

07:52:40.705 --> 07:52:43.101
WAS CONSTITUTIONAL NOW SAYING IT
IS. I AM WONDERING ABOUT

07:52:47.272 --> 07:52:49.526
JIM LANGFORD, WHO WE HAVE SEEN 
IN THESE IMAGES BECAUSE HE WAS 

07:52:49.724 --> 07:52:51.975
TALKING WHEN THIS WENT DOWN. NBC
REPORTER LEON CALDWELL, THERE ON

07:52:52.737 --> 07:52:58.321
THE GROUND, WAS POINTING OUT 
LANGFORD LOOKED EMOTIONAL AS 

07:52:58.527 --> 07:53:01.525
THEY TOOK THE DINNER BREAK. SHE 
WRITES HE WAS HUDDLED WITH 

07:53:01.671 --> 07:53:06.218
ANOTHER SENATOR, SENATOR DAINES 
AND THEY WERE HAVING A MOMENT 

07:53:06.357 --> 07:53:12.996
TOGETHER. LANGFORD, AFTER THE 
JANUARY 6 A JACK, APOLOGIZED TO 

07:53:13.210 --> 07:53:16.493
BLACK TOLSON'S AND SAID HE DID 
NOT REALIZE TRYING TO NULLIFY 

07:53:16.700 --> 07:53:21.587
THE ELECTION RESULTS FROM STATES
LIKE MICHIGAN, GEORGIA, WITH 

07:53:21.786 --> 07:53:26.504
STRONG BLACK SENATORS OF DETROIT
AND ATLANTA WOULD BE IN EFFECT 

07:53:26.922 --> 07:53:28.553
TRYING TO DISENFRANCHISE 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THIS 

07:53:28.554 --> 07:53:30.554
COUNTRY. HE WAS PART OF THAT 
REPUBLICAN EFFORT

07:53:36.723 --> 07:53:38.747
TO DENY THE VALIDITY OF THE 
ELECTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

07:53:39.160 --> 07:53:41.160
POINT OUT HE WAS FACING BACKLASH
IN OKLAHOMA INCLUDING BEING 

07:53:41.803 --> 07:53:48.977
KICKED OFF WITH A PROJECT THERE 
HONORING THE MASSACRE. 

07:53:48.978 --> 07:53:51.838
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE RIGHT. IT WOULD BE 
QUITE A DRAMATIC SWING TO 

07:53:52.039 --> 07:53:54.447
NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF THE 
ELECTION TO REMOVE TRUMP FOR 

07:53:54.599 --> 07:54:01.473
INFIGHTING WHAT HAPPENED. THERE 
IS NO PUBLIC INDICATION. SO FAR,

07:54:01.673 --> 07:54:05.566
WE ARE WATCHING THE SIX WHO 
VOTED TO PROCEED WITH THE 

07:54:05.782 --> 07:54:09.877
CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIAL. WE 
SAW A LISA MURKOWSKI FROM ALASKA

07:54:10.646 --> 07:54:14.189
COME OUT. ULTIMATELY, THOSE ARE 
NOT CERTAIN VOTES. SHE IS 

07:54:14.391 --> 07:54:17.428
KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN AND WANTS 
TO HEAR HIM UP FOR REELECTION IN

07:54:17.566 --> 07:54:19.566
2020 TWO.

07:54:23.031 --> 07:54:25.690
IT ALWAYS SEEMED IF THERE WAS A 
CHANCE TO GET 17 REPUBLICANS TO 

07:54:25.889 --> 07:54:28.786
BREAK RANKS, IT WOULD BE IN A 
CLUB. THERE IS THIS HARD GROUP 

07:54:28.975 --> 07:54:34.499
CORE OF HALF A DOZEN ROMNEY, 
THEN SAYS, LISA MURKOWSKI, SUSAN

07:54:34.704 --> 07:54:39.391
COLLINS, WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE 
BILL CASSIDY TO BE A PART OF 

07:54:39.596 --> 07:54:42.891
THAT BUT THERE ARE A BUNCH OF 
OTHERS WHO SORT OF, IN THEIR 

07:54:43.107 --> 07:54:48.051
HEART OF HEARTS, WOULD CERTAINLY
LIKE TO VOTE TO CONVICT TRUMP, 

07:54:48.248 --> 07:54:53.730
BUT THEY WILL NOT WALK THE PLANK
ON THEIR OWN. THE NAME A LOT OF 

07:54:53.930 --> 07:54:56.011
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, I'M 
GETTING A LOT OF TECH ABOUT 

07:54:56.225 --> 07:54:58.892
REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES IS MITCH 
McCONNELL. IF MITCH McCONNELL, 

07:54:59.090 --> 07:55:02.564
WHO BACKED AWAY FROM THIS EARLY 
OPENNESS TO POTENTIALLY 

07:55:03.322 --> 07:55:06.252
CONVICTING TRUMP, IF MITCH 
McCONNELL CAN OUT OF THIS AND 

07:55:06.453 --> 07:55:10.284
SAID LET'S CONVICT TRUMP, I 
THINK YOU WOULD SEE PROBABLY 

07:55:10.483 --> 07:55:14.059
HAVE A DOZEN OTHER REPUBLICANS 
SHAKE LOOSE. MAYBE YOU WOULD GET

07:55:14.262 --> 07:55:19.571
UP TO 17. JOHN CORNYN WAS 
TALKING TO REPORTERS. 

07:55:19.572 --> 07:55:25.028
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S HEAR SENATOR CASSIDY 
REALLY QUICK. 

07:55:25.029 --> 07:55:29.625
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER 
AND THAT SHOULD GIVE ANYONE WHO 

07:55:29.819 --> 07:55:31.819
LOVES OUR REPUBLIC GREAT CAUSE

07:55:37.405 --> 07:55:39.057
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DID NOT CATCH THE BEGINNING

07:55:39.058 --> 07:55:41.523
BUT SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT CONCERNS AND INTERRUPTION 

07:55:41.735 --> 07:55:46.847
OF THE POWER WHICH SHOULD GIVE 
ALL AMERICANS, THAT IS SENATOR 

07:55:47.269 --> 07:55:50.137
CASSIDY, THE REPUBLICAN FROM 
LOUISIANA WHO VOTED WITH THE 

07:55:50.339 --> 07:55:53.400
DEMOCRATS YESTERDAY TO SAY THIS 
PROCESS IS CONSTITUTIONAL. 

07:55:53.802 --> 07:55:58.291
SORRY, GO AHEAD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE DO NOT KNOW IF HE WILL 

07:55:58.493 --> 07:56:03.229
VOTE TO CONVICT TRUMP. THAT 
WOULD BE A SURPRISING MOVE, 

07:56:03.430 --> 07:56:05.466
SIGNIFICANT VOTE EVEN THOUGH HE 
DOES NOT FACE VOTERS UNTIL 2026.

07:56:05.670 --> 07:56:09.746
SOME OTHER VOTERS VOTING THIS IS
NOT CONSTITUTIONAL BUT STILL 

07:56:09.962 --> 07:56:14.444
COULD BE IN PLAY ARE THE FOUR 
SENATORS WHO HAVE ANNOUNCED 

07:56:15.207 --> 07:56:18.752
THEIR RETIREMENT. FROM 
PENNSYLVANIA, DID VOTE TO ALLOW 

07:56:18.957 --> 07:56:21.027
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE 
TRIAL BUT THE THREE WERE 

07:56:21.804 --> 07:56:27.111
RETIRING SENATORS BUT COULD, IN 
THEORY, VOTE FOR RICHARD FOR 

07:56:27.263 --> 07:56:30.568
ALABAMA, RICHARD BROWER FROM 
NORTH CAROLINA AND ROB PORTMAN 

07:56:30.717 --> 07:56:35.522
FROM OHIO. ALL THREE OF THOSE 
GUYS ARE INSTITUTIONALLY MINDED,

07:56:35.736 --> 07:56:41.656
HAVE BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR A LONG
TIME AND IF YOU WERE GOING TO 

07:56:41.856 --> 07:56:43.916
SEE MOVEMENT TO GET UP TO 17 
REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS, THOSE 

07:56:44.677 --> 07:56:47.277
THREE GENTLEMEN WOULD ALMOST BE 
PART OF THAT GROUP

07:56:50.696 --> 07:56:52.343
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLVIN, WE JUST TO 

07:56:52.344 --> 07:56:54.827
SENATOR WARNOCK, THE SECOND TIME
TODAY, RHONDA, I WAS SEEING 

07:56:55.043 --> 07:56:58.351
WHERE HE WAS TRYING TO GO, WHICH
WAS A LIGHTER MOMENT IN THIS 

07:56:59.108 --> 07:57:02.863
HEAVY DAY AS WE WATCHED THE 
SENATORS, BACK IN TOGETHER IN 

07:57:03.625 --> 07:57:05.625
THE CHAMBER.

07:57:08.763 --> 07:57:10.836
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AND A 
SHOCKING WAY TO START YOUR 

07:57:11.040 --> 07:57:15.079
CAREER FOR THESE FRESHMEN, 
SENATOR WARNOCK AMONG THEM, 

07:57:15.225 --> 07:57:18.843
RHONDA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT THAT, TOO. THAT'S 

07:57:19.044 --> 07:57:22.530
THE SECOND TIME HE SEEMED TO 
POINT AND ASKED IF THAT IS WHERE

07:57:22.738 --> 07:57:27.664
HE SHOULD GO. THIS IS THE SECOND
OR THIRD WEEK IN SCHOOL FOR HIM 

07:57:27.866 --> 07:57:31.719
AS WELL AS A FEW MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE WHO WERE JUST SWORN IN. 

07:57:31.922 --> 07:57:35.434
THEY ARE PART OF THE GROUP I AM 
WATCHING, TOO. EVEN THOUGH HE IS

07:57:35.647 --> 07:57:38.089
A DEMOCRAT, RAFAEL WARNOCK AS 
WELL AS MARK KELLY FROM ARIZONA,

07:57:38.290 --> 07:57:41.894
THOSE WERE TWO SENATE RACES, 
CLOSE SENATE RACES WE WERE 

07:57:42.045 --> 07:57:47.528
WATCHING, THEY WILL BE UP FOR 
REELECTION IN 2022, THE NEXT 

07:57:47.936 --> 07:57:54.837
CYCLE. THEY ARE FILLING OUT A 
TEXT-JOHN McCAIN'S CASE, PASSED 

07:57:54.983 --> 07:58:00.199
AWAY. I AM WONDERING HOW THEY 
ALSO APPROACHED SOMETHING AS A 

07:58:00.400 --> 07:58:05.130
IMPEACHMENT AND THAT BEING ONE 
OF THEIR FIRST BIG VOTES. IT IS 

07:58:05.331 --> 07:58:08.601
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF SENATORS
AND HOUSE MEMBERS WHEN THEY TAKE

07:58:08.803 --> 07:58:13.506
THEIR IMPEACHMENT VOTE HAVE TO 
CONSIDER BECAUSE IT IS ON THE 

07:58:13.710 --> 07:58:15.710
RECORD, IT IS A HISTORICAL 
MOMENT. TO START YOUR SENATE 

07:58:15.737 --> 07:58:18.632
CAREER OFF WITH A BIG VOTE LIKE 
THIS, IT IS SOMETHING TO WATCH 

07:58:18.849 --> 07:58:22.879
TO SEE HOW THEY HANDLE THIS. I 
DON'T THINK ANY OF THE NEW 

07:58:23.016 --> 07:58:26.908
SENATORS WANTED TO START OFF 
THEIR CAREERS WITH, I THINK WE 

07:58:27.110 --> 07:58:30.600
WILL GO TO THE CHAMBER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLEMAN, JAMES, THANK 

07:58:30.802 --> 07:58:33.872
YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO THE 
SENATE FLOOR AND IMPEACHMENT 

07:58:34.635 --> 07:58:37.342
LEADER RASKIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW REMIND US OF WHAT 

07:58:37.547 --> 07:58:41.431
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING
DURING THE ATTACK, THEY WILL 

07:58:41.646 --> 07:58:44.756
SHOW HOW HE CONTINUED TO STOKE 
THE INSURRECTION AND REFUSED TO 

07:58:45.519 --> 07:58:51.167
SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE 
OR HAVE ANYTHING TO STOP IT.

07:59:09.452 --> 07:59:11.452
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED

07:59:14.387 --> 07:59:16.799
SENATORS, YOU JUST HEARD FROM MY
COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE HARROWING 

07:59:16.937 --> 07:59:19.903
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED HERE AT THE
CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th  AND SAW 

07:59:20.109 --> 07:59:24.419
THE DISTURBING VIDEO. I WOULD 
LIKE TO TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO 

07:59:24.620 --> 07:59:28.740
WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE OTHER 
END OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AT 

07:59:28.941 --> 07:59:34.859
THE WHITE HOUSE. THE TRUTH IS, 
THE FACTS ARE, THAT ON JANUARY 

07:59:35.026 --> 07:59:42.402
6th, DONALD TRUMP DID NOT ONCE 
CONDEMN THIS ATTACK. HE DID NOT 

07:59:42.547 --> 07:59:45.010
ONCE CONDEMN THE ATTACKERS

07:59:48.630 --> 07:59:52.295
. ON JANUARY 6th, THE ONLY 
PERSON HE CONDEMNED WAS HIS OWN 

07:59:52.501 --> 07:59:58.213
VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE, WHO 
WAS HIDING IN THIS BUILDING WITH

07:59:58.970 --> 08:00:06.123
HIS FAMILY IN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.
THE FIRST CRUCIAL HOURS OF THIS 

08:00:06.269 --> 08:00:14.771
VIOLENT ATTACK, HE DID NOTHING 
TO STOP IT, NOTHING TO HELP US. 

08:00:14.972 --> 08:00:20.508
BY ALL ACCOUNTS FROM THE PEOPLE 
AROUND HIM, HE WAS DELIGHTED. 

08:00:20.713 --> 08:00:25.408
HERE IS THE LAST THING DONALD 
TRUMP SAID THAT THEY. YOU MIGHT 

08:00:26.160 --> 08:00:31.353
REMEMBER THIS FROM EMOTIONS 
PRESENTATION IN THE WEEK, AT 

08:00:31.553 --> 08:00:35.590
6:00 P.M., ON JANUARY 6th, AFTER
ALL OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT YOU 

08:00:35.730 --> 08:00:40.375
JUST SAW, THE CAPITOL POLICE AND
THE NATIONAL GUARD FIGHTING TO 

08:00:40.577 --> 08:00:45.899
SECURE THIS BUILDING, HERE IS 
WHAT DONALD TRUMP TWEETED, THESE

08:00:46.102 --> 08:00:50.223
ARE THE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT 
HAPPEN WHEN A SACRED LANDSLIDE 

08:00:50.424 --> 08:00:53.283
ELECTION VICTORY IS SO 
UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND VICIOUSLY 

08:00:54.046 --> 08:00:58.195
STRIPPED AWAY FROM GREAT 
PATRIOTS THAT HAVE BEEN BADLY 

08:00:58.394 --> 08:01:03.214
AND UNFAIRLY TREATED FOR SO 
LONG. GO HOME WITH LOVE AND IN 

08:01:03.397 --> 08:01:05.802
PEACE, REMEMBER THIS DAY 
FOREVER.

08:01:11.243 --> 08:01:13.290
HE GOT WHAT HE INCITED AND 
ACCORDING TO DONALD TRUMP, WE 

08:01:13.509 --> 08:01:18.161
GOT WHAT WE DESERVED. DONALD 
TRUMP'S INCITEMENT OF THIS 

08:01:18.303 --> 08:01:22.083
INSURRECTION INCLUDING HIS 
DERELICTION OF HIS DUTY OF 

08:01:22.285 --> 08:01:24.285
COMMANDER IN CHIEF

08:01:28.794 --> 08:01:31.769
, IS COMPLETE REFUSAL TO CONDEMN
THE ATTACK WHILE IT WAS GOING ON

08:01:32.686 --> 08:01:34.715
AND HAS CONTINUED IN FRONT OF 
THE VIOLENCE DURING THE ATTACK 

08:01:35.469 --> 08:01:37.469
REQUIRE IMPEACHMENT

08:01:40.670 --> 08:01:42.911
. LET'S TURN TO PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP'S CONDUCT THAT DAY, I WANT

08:01:43.112 --> 08:01:46.577
TO START AT THE BEGINNING WHEN 
HE ADDRESSED HIS THOUSANDS OF 

08:01:46.776 --> 08:01:48.776
GREAT PATRIOTS AS HE CALLED THEM
THAT MORNING, AROUND NOON, 

08:01:48.828 --> 08:01:52.267
DONALD TRUMP BEGIN SPEAKING AS 
RALLIED JUST ON PENNSYLVANIA 

08:01:52.411 --> 08:01:57.143
AVENUE. EVEN BEFORE DONALD TRUMP
FINISHED SPEAKING, HIS 

08:01:57.299 --> 08:02:00.896
SUPPORTERS BEGAN TO WALK DOWN 
TOWARD THE CAPITAL AND THEY WERE

08:02:01.102 --> 08:02:06.625
STARTING TO CHANT "STOP THE 
STEEL, STORM THE CAPITOL, INVADE

08:02:06.841 --> 08:02:12.570
THE CAPITAL,  FIGHT FOR TRUMP." 
BY 12:53 P.M., THEY HAD 

08:02:13.329 --> 08:02:15.329
VIOLENTLY FORCED THEIR WAY 
THROUGH THE BARRICADE AT THE 

08:02:15.979 --> 08:02:24.212
CAPITOL.  ABOUT 1:00 THAT DAY, 
WITH THIS CHAOS JUST STARTING, 

08:02:24.990 --> 08:02:27.481
SPEAKER PELOSI, AS THE 
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES, FORMALLY 

08:02:27.689 --> 08:02:32.165
COMMENCED THE PROCESS BY WHICH 
THE CHAMBER CERTIFY THE ELECTION

08:02:32.325 --> 08:02:38.790
RESULTS. WITHIN 10 MINUTES, AT 
1:11 P.M., AS IF ALMOST ON CUE, 

08:02:39.559 --> 08:02:44.513
DONALD TRUMP CONCLUDED HIS 
SPEECH WITH HIS FINAL REMINDER 

08:02:44.715 --> 08:02:47.396
TO THE THOUSANDS GATHERED THERE 
AND IT WAS TIME TO GO TO THE 

08:02:47.598 --> 08:02:49.598
CAPITOL, LET'S WATCH. 

08:02:52.085 --> 08:02:55.539
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO THE CAPITOL 
AND WE WILL TRY AND GIVE , BUT 

08:02:55.742 --> 08:03:00.188
WE WILL TRY AND GIVE OUR 
REPUBLICANS THE WEAK ONES 

08:03:00.325 --> 08:03:03.926
BECAUSE THE STRONG ONES DON'T 
NEED ANY OF OUR HELP. WE ARE 

08:03:04.143 --> 08:03:10.073
GOING TO TRY TO GIVE THEM THE 
KIND OF PRIDE AND BOLDNESS THAT 

08:03:10.290 --> 08:03:15.645
THEY NEED TO TAKE BACK OUR 
COUNTRY. LET'S WALK ON 

08:03:15.862 --> 08:03:17.911
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU, 

08:03:18.114 --> 08:03:22.234
AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU
ALL FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS 

08:03:22.434 --> 08:03:24.434
INCREDIBLE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:03:31.891 --> 08:03:34.551
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED 
WHEN THESE SUPPORTERS FOLLOWING 

08:03:35.317 --> 08:03:40.707
HIS ORDERS ARRIVE AT THE CAPITOL
BUT I WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT 

08:03:40.911 --> 08:03:44.452
HAPPENED  NEXT. YOU RECALLED 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID WE 

08:03:44.653 --> 08:03:46.928
ARE GOING TO THE CAPITOL 
SUGGESTING  HE WAS GOING TO GO 

08:03:47.123 --> 08:03:54.898
WITH THIS CROWD. THAT WAS NOT 
TRUE. LET'S HEAR WHAT HE SAID. 

08:03:55.105 --> 08:03:59.579
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS UP TO CONGRESS TO 
CONFRONT THIS EGREGIOUS ASSAULT 

08:03:59.783 --> 08:04:05.478
ON A DEMOCRACY AND AFTER THIS, 
WE WILL WALK DOWN AND I WILL BE 

08:04:05.678 --> 08:04:07.678
THERE WITH YOU, WE WILL WALK 
DOWN,

08:04:12.178 --> 08:04:14.609
ANYONE YOU WANT, BUT I THINK 
RIGHT HERE, WE WILL WALK DOWN TO

08:04:14.809 --> 08:04:21.749
THE CAPITOL . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS OF COURSE WAS NOT TRUE, 

08:04:21.962 --> 08:04:24.811
THEY DID NOT GO WITH HIM TO THE 
CAPITAL. HE LEFT AND WENT BACK 

08:04:25.228 --> 08:04:28.442
TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WHILE HE WAS
ON ROUTE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, 

08:04:28.596 --> 08:04:32.601
VIOLENCE REALLY BEGAN TO GROW AT
THE CAPITOL.  WITHIN MINUTES OF 

08:04:33.362 --> 08:04:37.910
DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH AND THEN, 
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REPORTS OF

08:04:38.671 --> 08:04:42.421
ESCALATING VIOLENCE THAT BEGAN 
TO SURFACE, BUILDINGS AROUND THE

08:04:42.624 --> 08:04:47.964
CAPITOL  WERE STARTING TO BE 
EVACUATED. BY 1:15, A EXPLOSIVE 

08:04:48.169 --> 08:04:54.114
DEVICE WAS FOUND AT THE DNC, A 
PIPE BOMB HAD BEEN FOUND AT THE 

08:04:54.724 --> 08:04:58.833
RNC, ABOUT 15 MINUTES EARLIER. 
THE HOUSE SERGEANT AT ARMS HAD 

08:04:59.051 --> 08:05:01.051
CALLED FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE

08:05:03.729 --> 08:05:05.773
. AT 1:34 P.M., THE MAYOR OF 
WASHINGTON, D.C. CALLED FOR 

08:05:05.984 --> 08:05:10.263
ADDITIONAL NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
. I WILL NOT GO THROUGH ALL OF 

08:05:10.471 --> 08:05:14.739
THE DETAILS OF THE VIOLENCE THAT
UNFOLDED HERE, YOU JUST SAW 

08:05:14.939 --> 08:05:18.210
THAT. AS WE WALK THROUGH WHAT 
OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF DID THAT 

08:05:18.409 --> 08:05:23.927
DAY, VERY CLEAR, ABOUT EXACTLY 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE AT THE 

08:05:24.689 --> 08:05:26.689
SAME TIME

08:05:30.007 --> 08:05:32.007
.

08:05:37.851 --> 08:05:39.851
OVERWHELMING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

08:05:42.781 --> 08:05:50.169
HE DID NOTHING. WE HEARD NOTHING
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

08:05:50.372 --> 08:05:55.241
STATES. WE DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING
FROM DONALD TRUMP UNTIL 1:49 

08:05:55.381 --> 08:06:00.371
P.M. AND WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS 
UNFOLDING, PRESIDENT DONALD 

08:06:00.511 --> 08:06:09.265
TRUMP SET OUT A. THIS WAS THE 
FIRST THING HE DID WHEN HE WENT 

08:06:09.466 --> 08:06:12.766
TO THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL, 
ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ,

08:06:12.982 --> 08:06:19.655
HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT WAS UNDER
VIOLENT ATTACK. WHAT WAS THAT 

08:06:19.837 --> 08:06:21.837
TWEET

08:06:24.403 --> 08:06:26.403
? NEARLY AN HOUR AFTER THE 
RIOTERS BREACHED THE CAPITAL 

08:06:26.668 --> 08:06:30.926
PERIMETER AT 1:49, DONALD TRUMP 
RELEASED A PROPAGANDA REAL OF 

08:06:31.079 --> 08:06:36.477
HIS SAVE AMERICA SPEECH THAT HE 
HAD GIVEN AN HOUR BEFORE. I WANT

08:06:37.234 --> 08:06:39.649
TO BE CLEAR, THE EVENTS I JUST 
DESCRIBED,

08:06:43.618 --> 08:06:45.241
THE RIOTERS ARE BREACHING THE 
CAPITAL, ATTACKING LAW 

08:06:45.242 --> 08:06:47.437
ENFORCEMENT, THE VIOLENCE IS 
BROADCAST ALL OVER THE 

08:06:47.733 --> 08:06:49.975
TELEVISION FOR THE WHOLE WORLD 
TO SEE INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT 

08:06:50.174 --> 08:06:54.859
OF THE UNITED STATES. I WANT TO 
SHOW YOU THIS IS WHAT WAS 

08:06:55.073 --> 08:06:58.758
HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE DONALD 
TRUMP SENT THE VIDEO OUT AGAIN 

08:06:58.959 --> 08:07:00.959
AND AS HE DOES IT

08:07:03.279 --> 08:07:07.564
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR COUNTRY HAS HAD ENOUGH. 

08:07:07.983 --> 08:07:11.471
WE WILL NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. 
THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. 

08:07:11.881 --> 08:07:16.389
TO USE A FAVORITE TERM THAT ALL 
OF YOU PEOPLE REALLY CAME UP 

08:07:16.605 --> 08:07:22.741
WITH, WE WILL STOP THE STEAL , 
BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER TAKE BACK

08:07:22.944 --> 08:07:26.880
OUR COUNTRY WITH WEAKNESS, YOU 
HAVE TO SHOW STRENGTH AND YOU 

08:07:27.084 --> 08:07:29.084
HAVE TO BE STRONG

08:07:32.178 --> 08:07:33.401
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVEN IF PRESIDENT DONALD 

08:07:33.402 --> 08:07:35.639
TRUMP CLAIMS HE DID NOT KNOW THE
EXTENT OF THE VIOLENCE THAT 

08:07:35.845 --> 08:07:38.450
WOULD FOLLOW HIS SPEECH, IT WAS 
NOT HAPPENING IN PLAINVIEW, 

08:07:38.649 --> 08:07:44.645
BROADCAST ON TELEVISION, HIS 
SUPPORTERS WERE ATTACKING LAW 

08:07:44.851 --> 08:07:48.711
ENFORCEMENT, THE MAYOR AND THE 
POLICE CHIEF WERE CALLING FOR 

08:07:48.917 --> 08:07:51.612
HELP, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND 
THE VICE PRESIDENT WERE INSIDE 

08:07:51.813 --> 08:07:56.522
SCARED FOR THEIR LIVES. HE DOES 
NOT SEND HELP, DOES NOT TRY TO 

08:07:56.728 --> 08:08:00.010
STOP IT, DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE WE
DID THE VIDEO OF THE SPEECH THAT

08:08:00.207 --> 08:08:05.118
HE HAD GIVEN BEFORE, THE 
INCLUDED LANGUAGE LIKE OUR 

08:08:05.538 --> 08:08:10.448
COUNTRY HAS HAD ENOUGH. WE WILL 
NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. THAT IS 

08:08:10.668 --> 08:08:16.556
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, YOU HAVE
TO BE STRONG. THOSE AROUND 

08:08:16.990 --> 08:08:21.738
DONALD TRUMP, AS LATER REPORTED,
WERE DISCUSSED IN. HAS ADVISERS,

08:08:22.498 --> 08:08:27.433
THOSE WORKING FOR HIM, FORMER 
OFFICIALS AND EVEN HIS FAMILY 

08:08:27.635 --> 08:08:31.758
WERE BEGGING HIM TO DO 
SOMETHING. KELLYANNE CONWAY, THE

08:08:31.957 --> 08:08:36.459
PRESIDENT'S CONWAY SAID TO ADD 
HER NAME TO THE COURSE OF AID 

08:08:36.852 --> 08:08:42.604
URGING DONALD TRUMP TO TAKE 
ACTION. IVANKA TRUMP, THE 

08:08:42.808 --> 08:08:46.474
PRESIDENT'S OWN DAUGHTER, WENT 
TO THE OVAL OFFICE AS SOON AS 

08:08:46.671 --> 08:08:48.805
THE RIOTING ESCALATED. AS 
CONCERNED

08:08:52.380 --> 08:08:54.380
CONFIRMED BY SENATOR GRAHAM, 
TRYING TO GET PRESIDENT TRUMP TO

08:08:54.409 --> 08:08:57.880
SPEAK OUT FOR EVERYONE TO LEAVE.
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY 

08:08:58.286 --> 08:09:02.568
CALLED JARED KUSHNER PLEADING 
WITH HIM TO PERSUADE TRUMP TO 

08:09:02.973 --> 08:09:04.973
ISSUE A STATEMENT OR

08:09:07.644 --> 08:09:09.883
TO DO SOMETHING AND SO, TOO, 
WENT DOWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

08:09:10.082 --> 08:09:12.988
AFTER THAT CALL. IT WAS NOT JUST
THE PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

08:09:13.147 --> 08:09:17.245
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM BOTH 
PARTIES, WHO WERE TRAPPED HERE 

08:09:17.440 --> 08:09:24.669
CALLING THE WHITE HOUSE TO ASK 
FOR HELP. SOME MEMBERS APPEALED 

08:09:25.074 --> 08:09:30.390
DIRECTLY TO DONALD TRUMP. THESE 
MEMBERS WHO HAD "BEEN WILL TRUMP

08:09:30.597 --> 08:09:34.030
SUPPORTERS AND WILLING TO VOTE 
AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE 

08:09:34.172 --> 08:09:38.977
RESULTS WERE NOW SCARED FOR 
THEIR LIVES." MINORITY LEADER 

08:09:39.594 --> 08:09:45.128
KEVIN McCARTHY REPEATEDLY EVEN 
GOT INTO A SCREAMING MATCH AND 

08:09:45.336 --> 08:09:47.980
THE ATTACK WAS UNDERWAY, 
DEMANDING THAT TRUMP DO 

08:09:48.183 --> 08:09:50.183
SOMETHING, ISSUE A STATEMENT 
DENOUNCING THE MOM

08:09:53.138 --> 08:09:55.582
. I IMAGINE MANY OF YOU SITTING 
HERE TODAY PICK UP YOUR PHONE 

08:09:56.203 --> 08:10:01.525
AND TRIED TO REACH SOMEBODY AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE TO ASK FOR HELP.

08:10:01.723 --> 08:10:04.211
THIS WAS NOT PART OF SOME 
POLITICS, THESE WERE AMERICANS 

08:10:04.409 --> 08:10:08.296
FROM ALL SIDES FORCING OUR 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO TRY TO 

08:10:08.711 --> 08:10:14.430
DEFEND AND PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. 
HE WAS REQUIRED TO DO THAT. THE 

08:10:14.646 --> 08:10:17.083
EXTENT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE TRIED 
TO REACH THE PRESIDENT TO GET 

08:10:17.295 --> 08:10:19.295
HIM TO ACT

08:10:22.182 --> 08:10:24.642
IS NOT KNOWN, BUT WHAT IS CLEAR,
WHAT WE KNOW WITHOUT ANY DOUBT 

08:10:24.842 --> 08:10:27.518
IS THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
THE PEOPLE AROUND DONALD TRUMP 

08:10:28.265 --> 08:10:33.636
LOBBIED HIM TO TAKE COMMAND. 
WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR IS WHAT 

08:10:34.068 --> 08:10:37.058
DONALD TRUMP, OUR COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF DID IN THOSE HOURS TO 

08:10:37.212 --> 08:10:45.942
PROTECT US, NOTHING. NOT 
ANYTHING. HE KNEW IT WAS 

08:10:46.146 --> 08:10:48.146
HAPPENING, THE ATTACK WAS

08:10:51.089 --> 08:10:53.143
ON TV, WE ALL KNOW THAT 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD THE 

08:10:53.342 --> 08:10:58.081
POWER TO DEPUTIES. HE WAS OUR 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF. HE HAD THE 

08:10:58.282 --> 08:11:03.386
POWER TO ASSESS THE SECURITY 
SITUATION, AND BACKUP, AND HELP,

08:11:03.604 --> 08:11:06.466
HE HAD INSIGHT TO THIS VIOLENT 
ATTACK. THEY WERE LISTENING TO 

08:11:06.667 --> 08:11:11.781
HIM, HE COULD HAVE COMMANDED 
THEM TO LEAVE, BUT HE DID NOT. 

08:11:12.190 --> 08:11:14.892
THE FIRST CRITICAL HOUR AND A 
HALF OF THIS BLOODY ATTACK, 

08:11:15.627 --> 08:11:17.627
DONALD TRUMP

08:11:21.626 --> 08:11:27.546
TWEETED HIS RALLY AND DID 
NOTHING ELSE. WE KNOW WHY, WE 

08:11:27.744 --> 08:11:30.795
KNOW HIS STATE OF MIND THAT 
PROMPTED HIS AFTER COMPLETE 

08:11:31.587 --> 08:11:37.418
REFUSAL TO DEFEND US REPORTED BY
THOSE AROUND HIM, THE PRESIDENT 

08:11:38.166 --> 08:11:44.030
HAS REPORTED BY SOURCES THAT THE
TIME WAS DELIGHTED. AS HE 

08:11:44.171 --> 08:11:47.770
WATCHED THE VIOLENCE UNFOLD ON 
TELEVISION, PRESIDENT DONALD 

08:11:48.147 --> 08:11:52.225
TRUMP WAS REPORTEDLY AND I QUOTE
BORDERLINE ENTHUSIASTIC BECAUSE 

08:11:52.360 --> 08:11:54.580
INTIMATE THE CERTIFICATION WAS 
BEING DERAILED."

08:12:00.004 --> 08:12:01.650
SENATOR BEN SASSE RELATED 
CONVERSATION TO SENIOR WHITE 

08:12:01.651 --> 08:12:05.118
HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP WAS "WALKING AROUND

08:12:05.318 --> 08:12:07.348
THE WHITE HOUSE CONFUSED ABOUT 
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ON HIS TEAM 

08:12:07.549 --> 08:12:15.083
WERE NOT EXCITED AS HE WAS." 
TRUMPS REACTION TO THIS ATTACK 

08:12:15.486 --> 08:12:17.486
REPORTEDLY, JENNY REALLY FREAKED
PEOPLE OUT

08:12:20.790 --> 08:12:25.721
. I UNDERSTAND WHY. WE JUST 
SUFFERED A VERY SERIOUS ATTACK 

08:12:25.891 --> 08:12:32.620
ON OUR COUNTRY AND WE STOPPED IN
THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DO IT. 

08:12:33.040 --> 08:12:38.362
WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAW IT, HE WAS
DELIGHTED. WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

08:12:39.327 --> 08:12:43.448
DID NEXT CONFIRMED WHY HE WANTED
THIS BECAUSE IT SHOWS HIS 

08:12:44.070 --> 08:12:47.617
SINGULAR FOCUS THAT DAY, THE DAY
WE WERE ATTACKED

08:12:51.216 --> 08:12:53.216
WAS NOT PROTECTING US OR 
PROTECTING YOU OR PROTECTING THE

08:12:53.279 --> 08:12:56.742
CAPITOL,  IT WAS STOPPING THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION 

08:12:56.944 --> 08:13:02.645
RESULTS. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. 
SHORTLY AFTER 2:00 P.M., AS THE 

08:13:02.788 --> 08:13:06.522
NEEDS WAS FULLY UNDERWAY, THEN 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP MADE A 

08:13:06.646 --> 08:13:12.901
CALL. THIS IS THE FIRST CALL HE 
MADE TO ANYONE INSIDE THE 

08:13:13.106 --> 08:13:15.106
CAPITAL DURING THE ATTACK.

08:13:19.029 --> 08:13:21.494
DID NOT CALL THE VICE PRESIDENT 
TO ASK HOW HE COULD HELP DEFEND 

08:13:21.694 --> 08:13:24.139
THE CAPITOL OR CALL THE NEXT  
TWO IN LINE FOR THE PRESIDENCY 

08:13:24.341 --> 08:13:26.966
TO CHECK ON THEIR SAFETY OR 
WELL-BEING. INSTEAD, HE 

08:13:27.108 --> 08:13:33.697
ATTEMPTED TO CALL SENATOR TAYLOR
AND DIALED SENATOR LEE BY 

08:13:33.835 --> 08:13:40.531
ACCIDENT. SENATOR LEE SAID HE 
ENDED A PRAYER WITH A CHAMBER. 

08:13:40.951 --> 08:13:46.451
THE PHONE RANG, IT WAS DONALD 
TRUMP AND HE EXPLAINS THE PHONE 

08:13:47.211 --> 08:13:49.622
CALL GOES HEY, TOMMY, TRUMP 
ASKS, AND

08:13:53.198 --> 08:13:55.680
SENATOR LEE SAYS THIS IS NOT 
TOMMY AND HE HANDS THE PHONE TO 

08:13:56.440 --> 08:14:01.799
SENATOR TOMORROW. SENATOR LEE 
CONFIRMED HE STOOD BY SENATOR 

08:14:02.204 --> 08:14:05.300
AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SPOKE
ON THE PHONE. ON THAT CALL, 

08:14:06.060 --> 08:14:13.702
DONALD TRUMP ASKED SENATOR 
TUBURALL TO MAKE THIS , THAT IS 

08:14:13.918 --> 08:14:21.677
WHY HE CALLED. LET'S BE CLEAR, 
AT ROUGHLY 2:00 P.M., 

08:14:22.287 --> 08:14:24.331
DONALD TRUMP WAS WALKING AROUND 
THE WHITE HOUSE WATCHING THE TV,

08:14:24.534 --> 08:14:27.560
DELIGHTED, AND SPENT 5 TO 10 
MINUTES TALKING TO SENATOR 

08:14:27.714 --> 08:14:29.714
TURBERVILLE

08:14:31.286 --> 08:14:33.544
ASKING HIM TO DELAY THE RESULTS,
THIS IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN 

08:14:33.747 --> 08:14:35.747
THE CAPITOL. 

08:14:45.480 --> 08:14:48.211
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PROTESTERS WERE CALLED IN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU

08:14:52.347 --> 08:14:54.347
.

08:15:00.345 --> 08:15:02.345
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

08:15:04.337 --> 08:15:06.780
YOU SAW SENATOR LANGFORD THAT 
SPEAKING AND LEAVE THE FLOOR 

08:15:06.985 --> 08:15:11.209
QUICKLY IN THAT CLIP BECAUSE 
THESE HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE 

08:15:11.352 --> 08:15:13.352
BARRICADES AND ENTERED

08:15:18.222 --> 08:15:20.087
THE BUILDING. AS THESE ARMED 
INSURRECTIONS BANGED ON THE 

08:15:20.088 --> 08:15:22.332
DOORS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WERE 
TOLD TO PUT ON THEIR GAS MASK 

08:15:23.094 --> 08:15:25.830
AND PUT BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS 
FOR SAFETY AND PREPARED TO 

08:15:26.039 --> 08:15:31.141
EVACUATE. DONALD TRUMP WAS 
CALLING TO ASK A SENATOR TO 

08:15:31.343 --> 08:15:36.639
DELAY THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS.
LET THAT SINK IN. DONALD TRUMP 

08:15:37.402 --> 08:15:42.352
DID NOT GET TO FINISH THAT CALL,
WAS CUT OFF BECAUSE THE SENATORS

08:15:42.556 --> 08:15:45.479
HAD TO MOVE FOR SECURITY AND 
THINK GOD

08:15:49.298 --> 08:15:51.368
THEY DID BECAUSE AS THE CALL WAS
OCCURRING, THE RIOTERS THAT 

08:15:51.584 --> 08:15:55.475
CLOSE TO THE SENATE CHAMBERS. AS
WE ALL KNOW NOW, BUT FOR THE 

08:15:56.240 --> 08:16:00.938
HEROISM A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER
EUGENE GOODMAN AND OTHER 

08:16:01.123 --> 08:16:04.949
OFFICERS WHO DID THESE A 
DIFFERENT TIME, THEY VERY LIKELY

08:16:05.152 --> 08:16:09.979
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN-THINK ABOUT 
THAT. ARMED INSURRECTIONIST

08:16:13.961 --> 08:16:16.580
, GUNS, WEAPONS, ZIP TIES, BRASS
KNUCKLES, THEY WERE COMING FOR 

08:16:16.719 --> 08:16:22.154
US.  THEY WERE INSIDE THE UNITED
STATES CAPITOL  TRYING TO STOP 

08:16:22.908 --> 08:16:28.522
THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THE 
POLICE WERE OUTNUMBERED AND BUT 

08:16:28.728 --> 08:16:34.480
FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, THEY WOULD
HAVE GOTTEN A, ALL OF US. OUR 

08:16:34.681 --> 08:16:38.561
COMMANDER IN CHIEF MAKES A CALL 
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THE SIEGE 

08:16:38.761 --> 08:16:42.659
BEGAN, NOT TO PRESERVE OR 
PROTECT AND DEFEND YOU AND OUR 

08:16:43.423 --> 08:16:48.250
COUNTRY AND THE CAPITOL, BUT  TO
JOIN FORCES WITH THE MOM AND 

08:16:48.398 --> 08:16:50.960
PRESSURE A SENATOR TO STOP 
CERTIFICATION.

08:16:55.346 --> 08:16:59.039
WE JUST CANNOT GET THEM TO THIS 
KIND OF BEHAVIOR. THERE CAN BE 

08:16:59.240 --> 08:17:01.614
NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE OF 
DONALD TRUMP'S CALL

08:17:05.189 --> 08:17:07.240
THAT HE WAS NOT CALLING TO 
SUCCESS THE SECURITY THREATS ARE

08:17:07.454 --> 08:17:10.338
CHECKED ON THE WELL-BEING OF YOU
OR ANYONE ELSE. INDEED, LATER ON

08:17:11.100 --> 08:17:15.258
THAT EVENING WHILE ALL OF THE 
DESTRUCTION AND DAMAGE STILL 

08:17:15.456 --> 08:17:18.520
CONTINUE, DOZENS OF OFFICERS 
WERE TREATED FOR SERIOUS 

08:17:19.282 --> 08:17:24.193
INJURIES, DEATHS WERE CONFIRMED.
ABOUT 7:00 P.M., THE PRESIDENT'S

08:17:24.327 --> 08:17:31.396
PERSONAL LAWYER, RUDY GIULIANI, 
MADE A CALL. JUST IN CASE YOU 

08:17:31.604 --> 08:17:33.438
DON'T THINK THERE WAS SOME 
COORDINATION, HE ALSO CALLED 

08:17:33.439 --> 08:17:37.105
SENATOR LEES PHONE TRYING TO 
REACH SENATOR TURBERVILLE.  WE 

08:17:37.299 --> 08:17:40.584
DON'T HAVE TO GUESS AS TO WHAT 
RUDY GIULIANI SAID IN THE 

08:17:40.784 --> 08:17:44.234
VOICEMAIL BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT 
RECORDED. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT 

08:17:44.435 --> 08:17:48.469
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER 
SAID ON THE NIGHT OF THIS 

08:17:48.625 --> 08:17:52.155
ATTACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR TURBERVILLE OR A  SAY

08:17:52.300 --> 08:17:56.644
COACH TURBERVILLE, THIS IS RUDY 
GIULIANI, THE PRESIDENT'S 

08:17:56.862 --> 08:18:03.664
LAWYER. I AM CALLING BECAUSE I 
WANT TO DISCUSS AND HOW WE NEED 

08:18:04.072 --> 08:18:10.008
YOU AND YOUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS 
TO SLOW IT DOWN. 

08:18:10.009 --> 08:18:14.916
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS WAS THE SINGULAR FOCUS 
OF DONALD TRUMP DURING THIS 

08:18:15.333 --> 08:18:21.238
BLOODY VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE 
CAPITOL.  IT WAS STOPPING THE 

08:18:21.383 --> 08:18:29.639
CERTIFICATION. AS I MENTIONED, I
WAS A TRAILER FOR 16 YEARS. 

08:18:29.866 --> 08:18:31.866
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ASK A 
JUROR TO USE REASONABLE 

08:18:31.924 --> 08:18:34.968
INFERENCES TO PIECE TOGETHER A 
DEFENDANT'S STATE OF MIND. WE 

08:18:35.173 --> 08:18:39.256
DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS HERE. OUR 
COUNTRY WAS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED 

08:18:39.469 --> 08:18:44.556
BY AN ARMED MOB, PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY REFUSED TO

08:18:44.755 --> 08:18:48.350
STOP THE ATTACK OR EVEN ADDRESS 
THE ATTACK AT ALL, HE MADE CLEAR

08:18:49.702 --> 08:18:53.181
HIS FOCUS WAS THE SAME GOAL OF 
THE ATTACKERS HE INCITED, TO 

08:18:53.387 --> 08:18:58.287
STOP THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS 
AND PREVENT A PEACEFUL 

08:18:58.484 --> 08:19:03.364
TRANSITION OF POWER. THE ONLY 
ACTION WE KNOW HE TOOK AN HOUR 

08:19:03.567 --> 08:19:08.454
INTO THIS ATTACK WAS TO CALL 
SENATOR TURBERVILLE  TO ASK HIM 

08:19:08.655 --> 08:19:13.138
TO DELAY THE CERTIFICATION. THIS
IS AS CLEAR EVIDENCE AS I HAVE 

08:19:13.346 --> 08:19:17.638
EVER SEEN OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP 
REALLY CARED ABOUT THAT DAY. 

08:19:18.600 --> 08:19:23.137
LOOK, THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS,
AS WE ALL KNOW, INCLUDES DEBATE 

08:19:23.897 --> 08:19:28.863
AND OBJECTIONS. SOME OF US 
DISAGREED, BUT WE CAME HERE ON 

08:19:29.625 --> 08:19:31.912
JANUARY 6 TO FORMALLY ADMINISTER
THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS 

08:19:32.114 --> 08:19:36.691
PURSUANT TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
DUTIES. AT THE END OF IT,  

08:19:37.027 --> 08:19:39.875
CONGRESS CERTIFIED THE RESULTS 
TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE

08:19:40.630 --> 08:19:44.976
A COUNTRY WITH LEADERS WHO ARE 
ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE 

08:19:45.120 --> 08:19:47.120
PEOPLE.

08:19:49.125 --> 08:19:51.392
DONALD TRUMP'S OBJECTION TO THIS
ARE NOT ON TRIAL. WHAT IS ON 

08:19:51.594 --> 08:19:55.866
TRIAL IS WHILE WE WERE UNDER 
ARMED ATTACK AND BEING 

08:19:56.006 --> 08:19:58.006
EVACUATED,

08:19:59.987 --> 08:20:01.814
WHILE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS WERE FIGHTING FOR THEIR

08:20:01.815 --> 08:20:03.851
LIVES, OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
WAS CALLING NOT TO DETERMINE HOW

08:20:04.610 --> 08:20:08.586
TO BEST SECURE THE BUILDING AND 
THE PEOPLE IN IT BUT TO CONTINUE

08:20:09.347 --> 08:20:12.445
PRESSURE SENATORS TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION PROCESS AND THE 

08:20:12.644 --> 08:20:19.405
PEOPLE TRANSFER OF POWER. JUST 
AS HE INCITED THE MOM TO DO 

08:20:19.603 --> 08:20:25.003
EARLIER IN THE DAY. THIS WAS A 
BREATHTAKING DERELICTION OF HIS

08:20:28.992 --> 08:20:31.738
DUTY, OF HIS VIOLATION, OF HIS 
GOES, AS OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF

08:20:35.099 --> 08:20:37.136
. BEFORE AND HANDED OVER TO 
MANAGER CASTRO TO WALK THROUGH 

08:20:37.354 --> 08:20:41.791
THE REST OF THE DAY, LET ME MAKE
ONE FINAL POINT PLEASE. THESE 

08:20:41.935 --> 08:20:46.585
ATTACKERS STOOD RIGHT WHERE YOU 
ARE, THEY WENT ON THAT ROSTRUM, 

08:20:46.995 --> 08:20:52.519
THEY RIFLED THROUGH YOUR DESKS 
AND THEY DESECRATED THIS PLACE. 

08:20:52.722 --> 08:20:58.173
LITERALLY, THE PRESIDENT SAT 
DELIGHTED, DOING NOTHING TO HELP

08:20:58.310 --> 08:21:05.783
US,, ONE OF YOU TO PRESSURE TO 
STOP THE CERTIFICATION. I CANNOT

08:21:05.998 --> 08:21:08.353
BE THAT THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
CAN INSIGHT

08:21:11.964 --> 08:21:14.824
A LAWLESS, BLOODY INSURRECTION 
AND THEN UTTERLY FAIL IN HIS 

08:21:15.039 --> 08:21:19.328
DUTY OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO 
DEFEND US FROM THE ATTACK AND 

08:21:19.532 --> 08:21:21.392
DEFEND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS FROM THAT ATTACK AND 

08:21:21.393 --> 08:21:28.406
GET AWAY WITH IT. DONALD TRUMP 
ABDICATED HIS DUTY TO US ALL. WE

08:21:28.608 --> 08:21:32.395
HAVE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. YOU CAN
MAKE IT RIGHT

08:21:39.591 --> 08:21:41.591
.

08:21:59.892 --> 08:22:03.977
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY FELLOW MANAGER, DAVID 
FACILITY, SHOWED YOU WHAT 

08:22:04.178 --> 08:22:06.644
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID AND 
DID NOT DO IN THOSE FIRST 

08:22:06.842 --> 08:22:12.310
CRITICAL HOURS OF THE ATTACK. TO
SEND A TWEET ACT 1:49 P.M. WHERE

08:22:12.473 --> 08:22:18.931
HE POSTED A SPEECH THAT INCITED 
THE ATTACK. HE CALLED THE 

08:22:19.135 --> 08:22:25.496
SENATOR TO ASK HIM TO DELAY THE 
CERTIFICATION. AND THE SENATOR 

08:22:25.699 --> 08:22:30.750
WAS EVACUATED FOR HIS OWN 
SAFETY-WE LEFT OFF AROUND 2:15 

08:22:30.925 --> 08:22:36.701
P.M.. AT THIS POINT, INSURGENTS 
WERE INSIDE THE SENATE AND THE 

08:22:36.838 --> 08:22:43.063
HOUSE AND THE SENATE HAD BEEN 
EVACUATED BY EVERYONE'S SAFETY. 

08:22:43.263 --> 08:22:47.574
AS YOU SAW, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE AND HIS FAMILY EVEN HAD TO

08:22:48.334 --> 08:22:55.562
BE EVACUATED FOR THEIR SAFETY. 
YOU WILL RECALL THAT DONALD 

08:22:55.765 --> 08:22:57.896
TRUMP HAD MADE VICE PRESIDENT 
PENN STATE A TARGET

08:23:02.109 --> 08:23:04.151
. HE ATTACKED THE VICE PRESIDENT
AT THE RALLIES, AND SPEECHES, 

08:23:04.347 --> 08:23:08.430
AND ON TWITTER. DURING PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH THAT 

08:23:08.638 --> 08:23:10.679
MORNING OF THE ATTACK, HE RAMP 
IT UP AGAIN AFTER PRIVATELY 

08:23:11.285 --> 08:23:16.712
PRESSURING MIKE PENCE IN FRONT 
OF THOUSANDS IN THE CROWD, HE 

08:23:16.850 --> 08:23:24.907
CALLED MIKE PENCE OUT 11 TIMES 
INCLUDING SAYING "MIKE PENCE, I 

08:23:25.116 --> 08:23:28.632
HOPE YOU WILL STAND UP FOR THE 
GOOD OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND FOR

08:23:28.834 --> 08:23:32.934
THE GOOD OF YOUR COUNTRY. IF YOU
ARE NOT, I WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 

08:23:33.693 --> 08:23:39.838
IN YOU. I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT 
NOW. THIS WAS THE CROWDS 

08:23:39.976 --> 08:23:44.618
RESPONSE TO DONALD TRUMP'S DAYS 
OF RELENTLESS ATTACKS ON HIS OWN

08:23:45.376 --> 08:23:48.068
VICE PRESIDENT.

08:23:57.879 --> 08:24:02.667

WHAT HIS WORDS WERE CAUSING, HE 

08:25:16.610 --> 08:25:22.958
DID NOT DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS 
TO STOP THE CROWD. IN FACT, HE 

08:25:23.138 --> 08:25:28.552
DID THE OPPOSITE, HE FUELED THE 
FIRE. AT 2:24 P.M., HE TWEETED "

PRESIDENT WHOSE LIFE WAS BEING 
THREATENED

08:26:11.956 --> 08:26:18.737
. SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY WELL WHO
WAS PAYING ATTENTION ANYWAY? 

08:26:19.713 --> 08:26:26.301
THAT MOB WAS PAYING ATTENTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MIKE PENCE DID NOT HAVE 

08:26:26.719 --> 08:26:30.227
COURAGE TO DO WHAT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN DONE TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY

08:26:30.429 --> 08:26:34.697
AND OUR CONSTITUTION GIVING A 
CHANCE TO CERTIFY A CORRECTED 

08:26:34.908 --> 08:26:39.406
SET OF FACTS OR INACCURATE ONES,
WHICH THEY WERE ASKED TO 

08:26:40.162 --> 08:26:45.065
PREVIOUSLY CERTIFIED. U.S. 
DEMANDS THE TRUTH.

08:26:52.840 --> 08:26:59.718
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CAN I SPEAK TO PELOSI? MIKE

08:27:07.616 --> 08:27:09.848

IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING 
DONE, YOU HAVE TO DO THAT 

08:27:26.266 --> 08:27:28.266
YOURSELF.

08:27:32.148 --> 08:27:34.217
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE INSURGENTS AMPLIFIED 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET 

08:27:34.945 --> 08:27:39.689
ATTACKING THE VICE PRESIDENT 
WITH A BULLHORN. THEY WERE 

08:27:39.904 --> 08:27:42.699
PAYING ATTENTION AND THEY ALSO 
FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS.

08:27:47.435 --> 08:27:49.881
IN FACT, THE INSURGENTS, WERE AT
ONE POINT, AS YOU SAW, 60 FEET 

08:27:50.097 --> 08:27:53.926
AWAY FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT AND
THE VICE PRESIDENT'S FAMILY.

08:27:57.436 --> 08:27:59.501
SOME OF THESE INSURGENTS WERE 
HEARD SAYING "THAT THEY HOPE TO 

08:27:59.701 --> 08:28:03.992
FIND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 
AND EXECUTE HIM BY HANGING HIM 

08:28:04.394 --> 08:28:08.640
FROM A CAPITOL POETRY  AS A 
TRADER.

08:28:13.027 --> 08:28:15.179
AND THEN, THEY ERECTED A GALLOWS
WITH A NEWS

08:28:21.119 --> 08:28:30.229
. THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP 
INCITED. PLEASE TAKE A CLOSE 

08:28:30.427 --> 08:28:38.818
LOOK AT THAT PICTURE. IT HARKENS
BACK TO OUR NATION'S WORST 

08:28:39.427 --> 08:28:41.427
HISTORY OF LYNCHING

08:28:44.688 --> 08:28:49.519
. A PRESIDENT'S WORDS HAVE THE 
POWER TO MOVE PEOPLE TO ACTION

08:28:53.068 --> 08:28:55.068
. THESE WERE THE RESULTS

08:28:59.650 --> 08:29:03.905
. WHY DID THE PRESIDENT INCITE 
SUCH RAGE AGAINST THE VICE 

08:29:04.046 --> 08:29:09.084
PRESIDENT? HE WAS FULFILLING HIS
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY AS WE ALL 

08:29:09.284 --> 08:29:15.270
WERE THAT DAY. VICE PRESIDENT'S 
IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE CARRIED OUT

08:29:17.442 --> 08:29:18.871
THIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY 
OVERSEEING THE CERTIFICATION OF 

08:29:18.872 --> 08:29:21.350
THE ELECTION RESULTS WITHOUT 
INCIDENT, WITHOUT CONTEST, 

08:29:21.553 --> 08:29:28.350
WITHOUT A WORD FOR THE ENTIRETY 
OF OUR NATION. PART OF OUR 

08:29:28.554 --> 08:29:32.583
PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER IN 
THE UNITED STATES. THE VICE 

08:29:32.726 --> 08:29:37.513
PRESIDENT SAID HE REVIEWED THE 
CONSTITUTION AND HE COULD NOT 

08:29:37.713 --> 08:29:39.713
BLOCK THE CERTIFICATION AS 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WANTED 

08:29:39.920 --> 08:29:45.692
HIM AND WAS PRESSURING HIM TO DO
. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT IN A 

08:29:45.908 --> 08:29:48.797
LETTER THAT MORNING, A FEW HOURS
BEFORE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 

08:29:49.763 --> 08:29:54.739
TWEET "I WILL APPROACH THIS 
MOMENT WITH A SENSE OF DUTY AND 

08:29:54.940 --> 08:29:57.148
AN OPEN MIND SECOND POLITICS

08:30:03.945 --> 08:30:06.501
PUTTING PERSONAL POLITICS ASIDE 
AND DO MY PART TO FAITHFULLY 

08:30:06.724 --> 08:30:08.507
DISCHARGE MY DUTIES, OUR DUTIES 
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 

08:30:08.508 --> 08:30:10.707
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ALSO PRAY THAT WE WILL DO 
SO WITH HUMILITY 

08:30:14.650 --> 08:30:17.309
AND FAITH. AND THE PRESIDENT'S 
RESPONSE TO THAT STATEMENT WAS 

08:30:17.540 --> 08:30:19.994
TO ATTACK MIKE PENCE WHILE HE 
WAS WITH HIS FAMILY UNDER THE 

08:30:20.208 --> 08:30:22.208
THREAT OF A 

08:30:25.205 --> 08:30:29.256
VIOLENT MOB. THE VICE PRESIDENT 
WAS FOLLOWING HIS FAITH, HIS 

08:30:29.474 --> 08:30:33.493
DUTY, AND HIS OATH TO OUR 
NATION. WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT 

08:30:36.441 --> 08:30:38.441
AND I DON'T AGREE ON TOO MUCH 

08:30:41.726 --> 08:30:44.672
IN POLITICS, BUT HE IS A MAN WHO
UPHOLDS HIS OATH, HIS FAITH, HIS

08:30:44.890 --> 08:30:49.858
DUTY. AND MOST OF ALL, UPHOLDS 
THE CONSTITUTION. MIKE PENCE IS 

08:30:50.091 --> 08:30:52.167
NOT A TRAITOR TO THIS COUNTRY. 
HE IS 

08:30:55.740 --> 08:31:01.625
A PATRIOT. AND HE AND HIS FAMILY
WERE WITH HIM THAT DAY, THEY DID

08:31:01.851 --> 08:31:03.851
NOT 

08:31:05.490 --> 08:31:07.512
DESERVE THIS. THEY DID NOT 
DESERVE A PRESIDENT UNLEASHING A

08:31:07.748 --> 08:31:13.659
MOP ON THEM. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 
HE WAS JUST DOING HIS JOB. AS 

08:31:13.883 --> 08:31:17.482
THIS WAS UNFOLDING IN THE 
CROWDED ROOM, 

08:31:20.519 --> 08:31:23.121
THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE WAS NOT 
ALONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE 

08:31:23.346 --> 08:31:27.766
PEOPLE CLOSEST TO HIM, HIS 
FAMILY AND ADVISERS WHO SAW THIS

08:31:27.986 --> 08:31:33.548
UNFOLDING IN REAL-TIME BEGGED 
HIM, IMPLORED HIM. STOP 

08:31:37.381 --> 08:31:39.381

08:31:40.832 --> 08:31:43.947
AN AIDE TO MARK MEADOWS, THE 
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF URGED

08:31:44.174 --> 08:31:48.190
HIS BOSS TO GO SEE THE 
PRESIDENT, SAYING QUOTE, THEY 

08:31:48.406 --> 08:31:54.917
ARE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE. THEY 
ARE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE. THAT'S

08:31:55.155 --> 08:32:00.736
WITH THOSE AROUND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP FEARED. AND 

08:32:05.736 --> 08:32:10.943
STILL, NOTHING. IT WAS NOT UNTIL
2:38 P.M., NEARLY 2 HOURS AFTER 

08:32:11.158 --> 08:32:16.983
THE START OF THE SIEGE. THAT 
DONALD TRUMP EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED 

08:32:21.800 --> 08:32:25.728
THE ATTACK. WHEN HE FINALLY DID 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE ATTACK, HERE IS 

08:32:25.977 --> 08:32:27.977
WHAT HE SAID. ON 

08:32:31.148 --> 08:32:34.093

THE CHANT I HEARD THE MOST TODAY
WAS FIGHT FOR TRUMP! THAT'S 

08:33:03.569 --> 08:33:07.427
CLEARLY WHAT MANY OF THEM FEEL 
THAT THEY ARE DOING. 

08:33:07.428 --> 08:33:09.428

PLEASE SUPPORT OUR CAPITAL 
POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY

ARE TRULY ON THE SIDE OF OUR 
COUNTRY. STEVE PEACEFUL. MUCH 

08:33:46.210 --> 08:33:49.215
HAS BEEN MADE OF THE FACT THAT 
IN HIS TWEET, HE SAYS STAY 

08:33:52.664 --> 08:33:58.350
PEACEFUL. SENATORS, STAY 
PEACEFUL? THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A

08:33:58.564 --> 08:34:00.564
SECOND. THESE FOLKS WERE 

08:34:04.180 --> 08:34:06.279
NOT PEACEFUL. THEY WERE BREAKING
WINDOWS. PUSHING THROUGH LAW 

08:34:09.721 --> 08:34:11.707
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, WAVING THE
FLAG AS THEY INVADED THIS 

08:34:11.708 --> 08:34:15.164

NEVER DID. HE DID NOT APPEAR 
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, HE DID NOT

08:34:51.191 --> 08:34:55.498
WANT IT TO STOP. HE WANTED THEM 
TO 

08:34:59.085 --> 08:35:04.174
STAY AND TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION. HIS FAILURE HAD 

08:35:04.396 --> 08:35:06.396
GRAVE AND 

08:35:07.822 --> 08:35:09.822

TRIED TO BREAK THROUGH A GLASS 
DOOR TO REACH THE SPEAKERS 

08:35:22.801 --> 08:35:26.378
LOBBY. AT THIS POINT, THE POLICE

08:36:18.881 --> 08:36:22.406
DISAPPOINTED AT THIS VERY 
MOMENT. PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT.

08:36:22.622 --> 08:36:26.731
ANYONE INVOLVED IN THIS, IF YOU 
ARE HEARING ME, HEAR ME VERY 

08:36:26.948 --> 08:36:28.948
LOUD AND CLEAR. THIS IS NOT THE 

08:36:32.317 --> 08:36:34.317
AMERICAN WAY.

08:38:54.651 --> 08:38:56.651
OF HERE!

08:39:14.416 --> 08:39:17.537
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS NOT 10 MINUTES INTO 
THE INSURRECTION. THIS IS NOT 

08:39:22.473 --> 08:39:26.437
JUST AFTER HIS SPEECH EARLIER 
THAT DAY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT 

08:39:26.662 --> 08:39:30.263
OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SAW 
HAPPENING AND THAT WAS HIS 

08:39:30.477 --> 08:39:35.334
RESPONSE. YOU WILL NOTICE, ONE 
OF THE THINGS HE SAYS TO HIS 

08:39:35.564 --> 08:39:40.443
MOM, TO THESE INSURRECTIONIST, 
RATHER THAN TO STOP OR TO LEAVE 

08:39:40.659 --> 08:39:44.027
WAS TO SAY THANK YOU. 

08:39:48.332 --> 08:39:50.332
THANK YOU. THANK YOU 

08:39:52.398 --> 08:39:56.894
FOR WHAT? THANK YOU FOR 
SHATTERING THE WINDOWS AND 

08:40:00.519 --> 08:40:02.519
DESTROYING PROPERTY? THANK YOU 
FOR INJURING MORE THAN 140 

08:40:03.567 --> 08:40:05.567
POLICE OFFICERS? 

08:40:08.239 --> 08:40:11.158
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IN DANGER 
ALL OF THE LIVES, THE LIVES OF 

08:40:12.303 --> 08:40:15.562
OUR FAMILIES? HOW ABOUT INSTEAD 
OF THANK YOU, AND DONALD TRUMP 

08:40:15.794 --> 08:40:20.446
ON THAT DAY ACTED LIKE OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND STOPPED 

08:40:20.707 --> 08:40:24.661
THIS AS ONLY HE COULD AND TOLD 
THOSE PEOPLE 

08:40:28.152 --> 08:40:31.409
TO LEAVE? HERE IS WHERE FORMER 
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, HIS 

08:40:31.640 --> 08:40:35.467
VERY GOOD FRIEND SAID AFTER THAT

08:40:40.482 --> 08:40:42.429
TWEET. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M PRETTY SURE THE PRESIDENT

08:40:42.430 --> 08:40:46.857
CAUSED THIS TO OCCUR. HE IS THE 
ONLY ONE THAT CAN MAKE IT STOP. 

08:40:47.070 --> 08:40:49.712
WITH THE PRESIDENT SAID IS NOT 
GOOD ENOUGH. HE HAS TO COME OUT 

08:40:49.941 --> 08:40:54.347
AND TELL HIS SUPPORTERS TO LEAVE
THE CAPITAL 

08:40:55.257 --> 08:40:58.462
ALLOW CONGRESS TO DO THEIR 
BUSINESS PEACEFULLY. AND 

08:40:58.685 --> 08:41:00.685
ANYTHING SHORT OF 

08:41:02.281 --> 08:41:05.749
THAT IS DENYING HIS 
RESPONSIBILITY. 

08:41:05.750 --> 08:41:07.750
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE IS RIGHT HERE CHRIS 
CHRISTIE 

08:41:11.416 --> 08:41:13.799
IS RIGHT. WE KNOW HOW DONALD 
TRUMP ACTS ON TWITTER AND 

08:41:14.018 --> 08:41:16.822
OTHERWISE HAS A MESSAGE TO 
CONVEY. IN FACT, I ASK YOU TO 

08:41:17.047 --> 08:41:20.041
REMEMBER THE STREETS EARLIER 
THIS MORNING. WHEN HE YELLED ON 

08:41:20.268 --> 08:41:22.268
TWITTER, STOP 

08:41:25.231 --> 08:41:27.847
THE COUNSELING WHEN HE WANTED TO
INCITE HIS SUPPORTERS TO SHOW UP

08:41:28.074 --> 08:41:31.197
ON JANUARY 6, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TWEETED 16 TIMES BETWEEN BEN 

08:41:31.418 --> 08:41:34.607
KNIGHT ON JANUARY 5 AND HIS NEW 
RALLY SPEECH THE 

08:41:39.568 --> 08:41:44.119
NEXT DAY. 16 TIMES TO GET THEM 
TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY 

08:41:44.357 --> 08:41:49.249
WANTED. HIS MESSAGE IN THOSE 16 
TIMES WAS CLEAR. FIGHT, STAY 

08:41:49.464 --> 08:41:53.264
STRONG, BE STRONG. WHEN THE 

08:41:56.806 --> 08:42:01.259
SAID THE ONE THING EVERYONE 
AROUND HIM WAS BEGGING HIM 

08:42:04.841 --> 08:42:06.841
TO SAY. STOP 

08:42:10.258 --> 08:42:12.258
THE ATTACK.

08:42:21.091 --> 08:42:23.230
ONLY DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE 
STOPPED 

08:42:26.977 --> 08:42:28.999
THAT ATTACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A GUY THAT KNOWS HOW TO TREAT

08:42:29.223 --> 08:42:33.006
VERY AGGRESSIVELY ON TWITTER PUT
OUT ONE OF THE WEAKEST 

08:42:33.228 --> 08:42:35.604
STATEMENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
BECAUSE HIS EGO WILL NOT 

08:42:40.520 --> 08:42:43.936
LET HIM -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE WAS NOT JUST OUR 

08:42:44.163 --> 08:42:45.948
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. HE HAD 
INSIDE OF THE ATTACK THE 

08:42:45.949 --> 08:42:47.949
INSURGENTS WERE FOLLOWING 

08:42:50.750 --> 08:42:52.995
HIS COMMANDS. AND ESAU, WHEN 
THEY READ ALOUD THIS TWEET, 

08:42:53.215 --> 08:42:57.542
ATTACKING THE VICE PRESIDENT, 
THEY CONFIRMED THIS DURING THE 

08:43:02.442 --> 08:43:04.442
ATTACK TO.

08:43:09.021 --> 08:43:11.021
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ SCREAMING 

08:43:14.442 --> 08:43:16.155
]  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, ASK YOURSELF THIS, 

08:43:16.156 --> 08:43:21.004
HOW EASY WOULD IT HAVE BEEN FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE A SIMPLE 

08:43:21.235 --> 08:43:23.235
COMMAND? A SIMPLE INSTRUCTION? 
JUST 

08:43:25.684 --> 08:43:27.684
TELLING THIS, 

08:43:29.334 --> 08:43:32.226
STOP, LEAVE. THIS WAS A 
DERELICTION OF DUTY. PLAIN 

08:43:35.046 --> 08:43:39.086
SIMPLE. AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
FOR ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAD DONE 

08:43:39.311 --> 08:43:44.770
THAT. THAT BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT 
POINT. YOU HEARD FROM MY 

08:43:44.986 --> 08:43:46.986
COLLEAGUES THAT WHEN PLANNING 
THIS ATTACK, THE INSURGENTS 

08:43:47.218 --> 08:43:51.504
PREDICT DID THAT DONALD TRUMP 
WOULD COME IN THE NATIONAL GUARD

08:43:51.732 --> 08:43:53.732
TO 

08:43:56.145 --> 08:43:58.778
HELP THEM. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE
DON'T KNOW YET ABOUT WHAT 

08:43:58.989 --> 08:44:05.042
HAPPENED THAT DAY. HERE'S WHAT 
WE DO KNOW. DONALD TRUMP DID NOT

08:44:05.260 --> 08:44:07.260
SEND HELP TO 

08:44:08.742 --> 08:44:10.742
THESE OFFICERS. WHO WERE BADLY 
OUTNUMBERED, OVERWHELMED AND 

08:44:13.008 --> 08:44:17.892
BEING BEATEN-DOWN. TWO HOURS 
INTO THE INSURRECTION, BY 3:00 

08:44:18.140 --> 08:44:21.161
P.M., PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD NOT 
DEPLOYED THE NATIONAL GUARD. OR 

08:44:21.387 --> 08:44:23.387
ANY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT 

08:44:25.194 --> 08:44:29.107
TO HELP. DESPITE MULTIPLE PLEAS 
TO DO SO. PRESIDENT 

08:44:33.529 --> 08:44:35.824
DONALD TRUMP WHO WAS AT THE TIME
OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE 

08:44:36.037 --> 08:44:38.397
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, HE 
TOOK A SOLEMN OATH TO PRESERVE, 

08:44:38.619 --> 08:44:40.619
PROTECT AND DEFEND 

08:44:44.695 --> 08:44:46.695
THIS COUNTRY. HE FAILED TO 
UPHOLD 

08:44:50.382 --> 08:44:54.451
THAT OATH. THERE'S NO INDICATION
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP EVER MADE A

08:44:54.681 --> 08:44:57.783
CALL TO HAVE THE GUARD DEPLOYED.
OR HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 

08:44:58.001 --> 08:45:00.001
GUARD 

08:45:02.288 --> 08:45:08.319
BEING DEPLOYED. SHORT AFTER 3:04
P.M., HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE CARD

08:45:08.576 --> 08:45:13.009
HAD BEEN ACTIVATED. LISTED THE 
PEOPLE THAT HE SPOKE WITH PRIOR 

08:45:13.229 --> 08:45:15.451
TO THIS ACTIVATION, INCLUDING 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, 

08:45:15.677 --> 08:45:17.677
SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER 
McCONNELL, 

08:45:21.469 --> 08:45:23.203
SENATOR SCHUMER AND 
REPRESENTATIVE HOYER. BUT THAT 

08:45:23.204 --> 08:45:27.485
LIST DID NOT INCLUDE THE 
PRESIDENT. THIS OMISSION OF HIS 

08:45:27.709 --> 08:45:29.709
NAME WAS REPORTEDLY NOT 
ACCIDENTAL. ACCORDING 

08:45:32.638 --> 08:45:36.348
TO REPORTS, TRUMP INITIALLY 
REBUFFED REQUESTS AND REQUIRED 

08:45:36.563 --> 08:45:41.174
INTERFERENCE BY OTHER OFFICIALS 
INCLUDING HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE 

08:45:41.388 --> 08:45:43.388
COUNCILMAN. 

08:45:44.626 --> 08:45:49.717
AND LATER, QUOTE, AS A MOB OF 
TRUMP SUPPORTERS BREACHED POLICE

08:45:49.936 --> 08:45:53.778
BARRICADES AND SEES THE CAPITAL,
TRUMP REPORTEDLY WAS QUOTE, 

08:45:54.027 --> 08:45:56.027
DISENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH 

08:45:59.572 --> 08:46:01.572
PENTAGON LEADERS.

08:46:06.970 --> 08:46:08.970
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS REPORTEDLY 
AND I QUOTE COMPLETELY, TOTALLY 

08:46:08.973 --> 08:46:10.973
OUT 

08:46:12.444 --> 08:46:15.283
OF IT. HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO 
REACH THE NATIONAL GUARD AND IT 

08:46:15.502 --> 08:46:19.508
WAS VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, STILL 
UNDER THE THREAT FOR HIS LIFE 

08:46:19.727 --> 08:46:25.195
WHO REPORTEDLY SPOKE TO THE 
GUARD. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CONDUCT

08:46:25.424 --> 08:46:27.424
REFERS 

08:46:30.257 --> 08:46:33.723
THIS TO. AT NO POINT DID DONALD 
TRUMP EVEN REFERENCE THE 

08:46:33.942 --> 08:46:36.905
NATIONAL GUARD. THE ONLY THING 
THAT WE HEARD CONNECTING THE 

08:46:37.135 --> 08:46:41.257
PRESIDENT TO THE GUARD WAS HIS 
PRESS SECRETARY WHO TWEETED 

08:46:41.476 --> 08:46:44.188
ABOUT THE GUARD BEING DEPLOYED 
OVER HALF AN HOUR LATER AT 

08:46:49.131 --> 08:46:51.995
3:36 P.M. WE HAVE SEEN WHAT 
DONALD TRUMP DOES WHEN HE TRIES 

08:46:52.229 --> 08:46:55.410
TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SOMETHING. 
AND YET, EVEN WHEN THE NATIONAL 

08:46:55.621 --> 08:47:02.522
GUARD WAS FINALLY DEPLOYED, HE 
DID NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE IT. IN 

08:47:02.745 --> 08:47:05.268
FACT, HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY A WORD 
ABOUT THE NATIONAL GUARD THE 

08:47:08.716 --> 08:47:10.716
ENTIRE DAY. THINK 

08:47:12.370 --> 08:47:14.744
ABOUT THAT. THE BLOODIEST ATTACK
WE HAVE SEEN ON OUR CAPITAL 

08:47:17.239 --> 08:47:22.123
SINCE 1812 AND OUR PRESIDENT 
COULD NOT BE BOTHERED TO EVEN 

08:47:22.371 --> 08:47:24.371
MENTION THAT HELP WAS ON 

08:47:28.153 --> 08:47:30.510
ITS WAY. THESE INSURGENTS HAD 
BEEN ATTACKING OUR GOVERNMENT 

08:47:30.724 --> 08:47:35.591
FOR OVER FOUR HOURS BY THAT 
POINT. AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN THE 

08:47:35.812 --> 08:47:38.302
TARGET, BUT IT WAS THE BRAVE MEN
AND WOMEN WHO PROTECT OUR 

08:47:38.522 --> 08:47:40.522
CAPITAL, WHO WERE OUT THERE 
COMBATING THOUSANDS 

08:47:44.178 --> 08:47:46.178
OF ARMED

08:47:51.376 --> 08:47:53.376
INSURGENTS.  WHO 

08:47:55.228 --> 08:47:57.757
WERE BATTLING THE MEN AND WOMEN 
PROTECTING OUR LIVES. THAT'S WHO

08:47:57.991 --> 08:47:59.991
DONALD TRUMP LEFT 

08:48:02.888 --> 08:48:04.888
UNPROTECT DID.

08:48:22.244 --> 08:48:24.244
HOW SEVERELY THEY 

08:48:26.712 --> 08:48:28.554
WERE OUTNUMBERED. WHILE OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, WHOSE JOB IT

08:48:28.555 --> 08:48:33.458
WAS TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THEM. 
WISHES WATCHING, AND DOING 

08:48:33.671 --> 08:48:37.328
NOTHING. FOR HOURS. REFUSING TO 
SEND HELP. IF HE WANTED TO 

08:48:37.553 --> 08:48:42.201
PROTECT THESE OFFICERS, IF HE 
CARED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY, AS HE 

08:48:44.797 --> 08:48:47.275
TWEETED ABOUT, HE WOULD HAVE 
TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS TO LEAVE, HE

08:48:47.513 --> 08:48:49.513
WOULD HAVE SENT HELP 

08:48:51.695 --> 08:48:53.954
RIGHT AWAY. ONE OFFICER WAS 
KILLED. OTHERS TOOK THEIR LIVES.

08:48:54.258 --> 08:48:58.340
AFTER THE ATTACK. MORE THAN 140 
POLICE 

08:49:01.862 --> 08:49:04.414
OFFICERS WERE INJURED, INCLUDING
CRACKED WRISTS, ONE 

08:49:07.948 --> 08:49:10.841
OFFICER LOST AND I. ANOTHER WAS 
STABBED WITH A METAL FENCE TAKE.

08:49:11.055 --> 08:49:14.492
THEY WERE COMPLETELY AND 
VIOLENTLY OVERWHELMED BY A MOB 

08:49:14.727 --> 08:49:19.758
AND NEEDED HELP. AND OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, PRESIDENT 

08:49:20.011 --> 08:49:22.170
TRUMP REFUSED TO SEND 

08:49:27.180 --> 08:49:30.965
IT. SENATORS, YOU HAVE SEEN ALL 
THE EVIDENCE SO FAR, IN 

08:49:35.916 --> 08:49:39.001
THIS IS CLEAR. ON JANUARY 6, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP LEFT EVERYONE IN

08:49:39.839 --> 08:49:41.839
HIS CAPITAL 

08:49:45.055 --> 08:49:47.232
FOR DEBT. FOR THE NEXT HOUR, 
AFTER 

08:49:51.620 --> 08:49:53.997
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 3:00 P.M. 
TWEET, HE STILL DID NOTHING. NOT

08:49:54.219 --> 08:49:56.219
UNTIL 

08:49:58.321 --> 08:50:00.658
4:17 P.M., OVER 3.5 HOURS AFTER 
THE VIOLENCE STARTED, HE FINALLY

08:50:00.872 --> 08:50:06.124
ASKED THE INSURGENTS TO GO HOME.
ON THE RIGHT, YOU WILL SEE WHAT 

08:50:06.345 --> 08:50:08.602
HAPPENED IN THAT DAY IN THE 
HOURS LEADING UP TO HIS 

08:50:10.714 --> 08:50:12.980
PRERECORDED VIDEO. ON THE LEFT, 
YOU WILL SEE HIS MESSAGE. LET'S 

08:50:13.203 --> 08:50:15.203
WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW YOUR PAIN, I KNOW YOU 

08:50:15.407 --> 08:50:20.581
ARE HURT. WE HAD AN ELECTION 
THAT WAS STOLEN FROM US. IT WAS 

08:50:20.809 --> 08:50:22.809
A LANDSLIDE ELECTION AND 
EVERYONE KNOWS IT. ESPECIALLY 

08:50:22.922 --> 08:50:24.922
THE 

08:50:26.967 --> 08:50:30.090
OTHER SIDE. BUT YOU HAVE TO GO 
HOME NOW. WE HAVE TO HAVE PEACE,

08:50:30.333 --> 08:50:32.573
WE HAVE TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER. 
WE HAVE TO RESPECT 

08:50:35.699 --> 08:50:38.085
OUR GREAT PEOPLE IN LAW AND 
ORDER. WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY 

08:50:38.303 --> 08:50:40.789
HURT. IT'S A VERY TOUGH PERIOD 
OF TIME. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A 

08:50:41.020 --> 08:50:43.250
TIME LIKE THIS, WHERE SUCH A 
THING HAPPENED WHERE THEY COULD 

08:50:43.467 --> 08:50:48.245
TAKE IT AWAY FROM ALL OF US, FOR
ME, FROM YOU, FROM OUR COUNTRY. 

08:50:48.477 --> 08:50:50.715
THIS WAS A FRAUDULENT ELECTION. 
BUT WE CANNOT PLAY INTO THE 

08:50:50.943 --> 08:50:52.943
HANDS OF THESE PEOPLE. WE HAVE 
TO 

08:50:56.623 --> 08:51:00.513
HAVE PEACE. SO GO HOME, WE LOVE 
YOU, YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL. WE 

08:51:00.749 --> 08:51:03.974
HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS. YOU SEE 
THE WAY OTHERS ARE TREATED THAT 

08:51:04.189 --> 08:51:09.707
ARE SO BAD AND SO EVIL. WE KNOW 
HOW YOU FEEL. BUT GO HOME, AND 

08:51:09.933 --> 08:51:11.933
GO HOME 

08:51:14.835 --> 08:51:16.835
IN PEACE.

08:51:22.215 --> 08:51:24.215
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS THE FIRST TIME OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SPOKE 

08:51:24.285 --> 08:51:27.119
PUBLICLY AT ALL SINCE THE ATTACK
BEGAN. OVER THE 3.5 HOURS AFTER 

08:51:27.352 --> 08:51:29.836
IT STARTED. AND THESE ARE THE 
ENTIRETY OF THE WORDS THE 

08:51:30.059 --> 08:51:32.059
PRESIDENT SPOKE OUT LOUD TO THE 

08:51:35.357 --> 08:51:37.850
AMERICAN PEOPLE OR TO THE 
ATTACKERS THAT ENTIRE DAY. 

08:51:38.081 --> 08:51:40.936
NOWHERE IN THAT VIDEO, NOT ONCE,
DID HE SAY I CONDEMN THIS 

08:51:41.168 --> 08:51:45.946
INSURRECTION. I CONDEMN WHAT YOU
DID TODAY. NOWHERE DID HE SAY I 

08:51:46.176 --> 08:51:50.448
AM SENDING HELP IMMEDIATELY. 
STOP THIS! HERE'S WHAT HE SAID 

08:51:50.707 --> 08:51:57.777
INSTEAD. I KNOW YOUR PAIN. I 
KNOW YOU ARE HURT. WE HAD AN 

08:51:58.097 --> 08:52:02.469
ELECTION THAT WAS STOLEN. EVEN 
AFTER ALL THE THINGS 

08:52:06.295 --> 08:52:12.486
WE WITNESSED, HE GOES OUT AND 
TELLS THE SAME BIG LIE. THE SAME

08:52:14.212 --> 08:52:19.567
BIG LIFE THAT ENRAGED AND 
INCITED THE ATTACK. HE 

08:52:21.581 --> 08:52:25.336
THIS WHILE THE ATTACK WAS 
ONGOING AND WHILE WE WERE STILL 

08:52:26.613 --> 08:52:32.745
UNDER THREAT. HERE'S WHAT ELSE 
HE SENT. GO HOME IN PEACE. WE 

08:52:32.984 --> 08:52:35.586
LOVE YOU! YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL. 

08:52:39.199 --> 08:52:42.178
SENATORS, YOU WERE HERE. YOU SAW
THIS WITH YOUR OWN EYES. YOU 

08:52:42.512 --> 08:52:44.512
FACED 

08:52:47.055 --> 08:52:50.074
THAT DANGER. AND WHEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

08:52:50.292 --> 08:52:52.292
CONFRONT THEM AS THE LEADER OF 

08:52:55.049 --> 08:52:56.962
US ALL, AS OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, WHAT DID HE 

08:52:56.963 --> 08:53:00.182
TELL THEM? WE LOVE YOU? YOU ARE 
VERY SPECIAL. THIS WAS NOT 

08:53:03.370 --> 08:53:05.370
A CONDEMNATION. THIS WAS A 
MESSAGE OF CONSOLATION, OF 

08:53:05.436 --> 08:53:11.494
SUPPORT. OF PRAISE. IF THERE'S 
ANY DOUBT THAT HIS SUPPORTERS, 

08:53:11.872 --> 08:53:14.407
THESE INSURGENTS TOOK THIS AS A 
MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AND PRAISE , 

08:53:14.669 --> 08:53:16.669
WATCH 

08:53:17.792 --> 08:53:19.402
FOR YOURSELVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD TRUMP ASKED EVERYONE 

08:53:19.403 --> 08:53:25.204
TO GO HOME. HE JUST PUT OUT A 
TWEET THAT IS A 

08:53:28.704 --> 08:53:34.840
MINUTE LONG. WE WON THE [ BLEEP 
] TODAY. WE [ BLEEP ] ONE. WE 

08:53:35.057 --> 08:53:39.620
WON BY SENDING A MESSAGE 
DEPENDS. IF THEY DON'T DO AS 

08:53:39.868 --> 08:53:42.607
THEY ARE OPPOSED TO DO AND THEY 
DON'T UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, 

08:53:42.835 --> 08:53:44.835
YOU WILL REMOVE THEM FROM OFFICE
ONE WAY 

08:53:48.268 --> 08:53:52.118
OR ANOTHER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SUSPECT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT 

08:53:52.335 --> 08:53:55.967
MEN. YOU WILL HEAR HIM SAY THAT 
WE WON THE DAY. WHO WON 

08:53:59.032 --> 08:54:01.525
THE DAY? WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST 
FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES 

08:54:06.276 --> 08:54:08.276
THAT DAY. THE 

08:54:11.760 --> 08:54:15.726
LIFE-THREATENING DANGER. WHO WON
ON 

08:54:20.708 --> 08:54:25.300
JANUARY 6? THAT IS NOT A WIN FOR
AMERICA. BUT IT IS A WIN FOR 

08:54:25.533 --> 08:54:27.533
DONALD TRUMP, UNLESS WE HOLD 

08:54:31.057 --> 08:54:33.057
HIM ACCOUNTABLE.

08:54:36.199 --> 08:54:38.272
NOW, A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AFTER
THE VIDEO, THE 

08:54:42.098 --> 08:54:44.020
BRAVES MEMBERS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT SECURE THE CAPITAL 

08:54:44.021 --> 08:54:46.238
AND WE GOT READY TO CONTINUE 
CERTIFYING THE RESULTS OF OUR 

08:54:46.471 --> 08:54:49.034
FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. A HALF 
HOUR AFTER THAT, PRESIDENT TRUMP

08:54:49.254 --> 08:54:51.254
ISSUED 

08:54:54.212 --> 08:54:59.060
ANOTHER TWEET. AS TO WHETHER HE 
HAD INCITED THIS, HE 

08:54:59.295 --> 08:55:01.295
COMMEMORATED WHAT HAPPENED ON 

08:55:04.443 --> 08:55:06.443
JANUARY 6. ON JANUARY 6, 

08:55:10.245 --> 08:55:13.284
HE TWEETED, THESE ARE THE THINGS
AND EVENTS THAT HAPPEN WHEN A 

08:55:13.510 --> 08:55:15.510
SACRED LANDSLIDE ELECTION SO 
UNCEREMONIOUSLY 

08:55:18.995 --> 08:55:20.995
AND VICIOUSLY

08:55:23.325 --> 08:55:25.325
, REMEMBER THIS 

08:55:28.750 --> 08:55:30.750
DAY FOREVER.

08:55:35.307 --> 08:55:37.460
THIS TWEET SHOWS EXACTLY HOW 
DONALD TRUMP FELT ABOUT WHAT 

08:55:37.696 --> 08:55:39.696
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6. THESE ARE
THE THINGS 

08:55:42.824 --> 08:55:45.430
THAT HAPPENED. HE IS SAYING, 
THIS WAS FOR SEEABLE. HE IS 

08:55:45.649 --> 08:55:50.767
SAYING, I TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU CERTIFY 

08:55:50.981 --> 08:55:54.741
THE ELECTION FOR ANYONE ELSE. 
AND YOU GOT WHAT YOU DESERVE FOR

08:55:54.965 --> 08:55:56.965
TRYING TO TAKE MY 

08:56:00.435 --> 08:56:04.135
POWER AWAY. GREAT PAGES, GO HOME
WITH LOVE AND IN PEACE. REMEMBER

08:56:04.353 --> 08:56:06.353

08:56:09.029 --> 08:56:11.843
DAY FOREVER. HE IS SAYING TO 
THEM, YOU DID GOOD. HE IS NOT 

08:56:12.067 --> 08:56:14.604
REGRETFUL, HE'S NOT BREATHING, 
HE IS NOT SAD. HE IS NOT ANGRY 

08:56:14.835 --> 08:56:17.509
ABOUT THE ATTACK. HE IS 

08:56:22.374 --> 08:56:24.374
COMMEMORATING IT.

08:56:28.935 --> 08:56:31.231
THIS IS THE ENTIRETY OF WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TO THE 

08:56:31.475 --> 08:56:33.603
PUBLIC. FIVE TWEETS IN A 
PRERECORDED VIDEO. ON THE DATE 

08:56:33.824 --> 08:56:35.879
OF THE MOST BLOODY INSURRECTION 
WE HAVE FACED IN GENERATIONS, 

08:56:38.081 --> 08:56:40.116
OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WAS KNOWN
FOR SENDING 108 TWEETS IN A 

08:56:40.366 --> 08:56:44.774
NORMAL DAY. HE SENT FIVE TWEETS 
AND A PRERECORDED VIDEO. THAT IS

08:56:45.019 --> 08:56:46.843
THE ENTIRETY OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS FROM 

08:56:46.844 --> 08:56:50.297
WHEN THE ATTACK BEGAN UNTIL HE 
WENT TO BED ON JANUARY 6. THAT 

08:56:50.525 --> 08:56:53.220
IS ALL HE DID. DESPITE ALL THE 
PEOPLE 

08:56:58.105 --> 08:57:00.769
WE KNOW WHO BEGGED HIM TO 
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND. 

08:57:00.990 --> 08:57:02.990
THAT WAS OUR 

08:57:05.506 --> 08:57:07.506
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF'S RESPONSE. 
HE BEGAN THE DAY WITH QUOTE OUR 

08:57:07.527 --> 08:57:12.741
COUNTRY HAS HAD ENOUGH. AND WE 
WILL NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE! AND 

08:57:12.957 --> 08:57:18.018
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. 
AND HANDED THE ATTACK LETTING US

08:57:18.507 --> 08:57:20.507
KNOW THAT WE GOT WHAT HE 
FOREWARNED 

08:57:23.989 --> 08:57:26.407
THAT MORNING. WE WILL, OF 
COURSE, EACH OF US REMEMBER THAT

08:57:27.639 --> 08:57:29.639
DAY FOREVER. BUT NOT IN THE WAY 
THAT PRESIDENT 

08:57:33.325 --> 08:57:35.476
TRUMP INTENDED. NOT BECAUSE OF 
THE ACTIONS OF THESE VIOLENT, 

08:57:38.412 --> 08:57:40.236
UNPATRIOTIC INSURRECTIONIST. I 
WILL REMEMBER THAT DAY FOREVER 

08:57:40.237 --> 08:57:42.338
BECAUSE DESPITE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S THIS IS TIMES THROUGHOUT

08:57:42.560 --> 08:57:44.560
THE DAY TO ENCOURAGE 

08:57:46.328 --> 08:57:48.328
THE SIEGE, 

08:57:51.529 --> 08:57:57.432
HE FAILED. AT E:06 P.M., THE 
SENATE GOBBLED INTO SESSION. 

08:57:57.652 --> 08:58:00.790
ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, THE HOUSE 

08:58:03.995 --> 08:58:05.995
FOLLOWED SUIT. CLOSE TO 4:00 
A.M., AFTER SPENDING A 

08:58:06.012 --> 08:58:08.012
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE DAY 
EVACUATING OR ON THE 

08:58:12.464 --> 08:58:14.964
FLOOR HIDING. THIS GREAT BODY 
FULFILL THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE 

08:58:15.199 --> 08:58:17.199
AND CERTIFY THE ELECTORAL 

08:58:20.377 --> 08:58:23.687
COLLEGE WILL. I AM PROUD TO BE 
PART OF CONGRESS, I AM PROUD 

08:58:23.905 --> 08:58:25.971
THAT WE ENSURE THE WILL OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE FINALLY 

08:58:26.183 --> 08:58:28.183
PREVAILED ON 

08:58:30.208 --> 08:58:33.186
THAT DAY. AND I AM PROUD THAT I,
AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM 

08:58:33.399 --> 08:58:35.884
ABIDED BY OUR OATH OF OFFICE 
EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT 

08:58:36.110 --> 08:58:39.382
ABIDE BY HIS. PRESIDENT TOO TOOK

08:58:44.357 --> 08:58:48.397
AN OATH. HE SWORE ON A BIBLE TO 
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND. 

08:58:48.613 --> 08:58:51.035
WHO AMONG US CAN HONESTLY SAY 
THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT HE HAD 

08:58:51.252 --> 08:58:58.255
HELD THAT BATTLE? AND WHO AMONG 
US WILL LET HIS OTHER 

08:58:58.521 --> 08:59:00.521
DERELICTION OF 

08:59:03.449 --> 08:59:05.449
DUTY STAND?

08:59:14.077 --> 08:59:18.757
MR. PRESIDENT, THE MANAGERS ARE 
PREPARED TO RECESS FOR THE 

08:59:18.985 --> 08:59:20.985
EVENING AND TO FINISH OUR 
OPENING 

08:59:24.984 --> 08:59:28.309
STATEMENT TOMORROW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT.

08:59:28.525 --> 08:59:30.525
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

08:59:32.360 --> 08:59:35.231
MR. PRESIDENT. FIRST, WITH RULE 
16, I MAKE A MOTION. 

08:59:38.247 --> 08:59:40.247
STATEMENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED BY 
THE 

08:59:44.079 --> 08:59:46.079
HOUSE MANAGERS.

08:59:50.846 --> 08:59:53.368
THEY WERE NOT MADE BY ME, THEY 
WERE NOT ACCURATE. WERE CONTRARY

08:59:55.726 --> 08:59:57.726
TO FACT. I MOVE THAT THEY BE 
STRICKEN FROM 

09:00:02.358 --> 09:00:04.358
THE RECORD.

09:00:07.293 --> 09:00:09.293
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 47, 

09:00:11.361 --> 09:00:13.490
SECTION 4, PRESENTATIONS ARE NOT
LIMITED TO THE MARKET PROVIDED 

09:00:16.243 --> 09:00:18.243
FOR -- OF 

09:00:20.908 --> 09:00:22.908
THAT RESOLUTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:00:26.309 --> 09:00:28.309
MAJORITY LEADER?

09:00:34.112 --> 09:00:39.117
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT?

09:00:46.034 --> 09:00:49.283
RIGHT HERE? WAIT, WAIT, WE MIGHT
AS WELL HEAR CLEARLY WHAT THE 

09:00:49.506 --> 09:00:52.319
RULING OF THE CHAIR WAS. SO IF 
YOU WOULD REPEAT THAT? 

09:00:56.451 --> 09:00:58.464
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES, PURSUANT TO THE SENATE 
RESOLUTION 47, THE PRESENTATIONS

09:00:58.680 --> 09:01:00.680
ARE 

09:01:03.500 --> 09:01:05.500
NOT LIMITED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:01:07.834 --> 09:01:11.538
YEAH, YOU. PURSUANT TO SENATE 
RESOLUTION 437, SECTION FOUR, 

09:01:11.752 --> 09:01:16.768
THEY ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE 
RECORD PROVIDED IN THAT 

09:01:16.987 --> 09:01:20.063
RESOLUTION. THE SENATE FROM UTAH

09:01:23.471 --> 09:01:25.471
HAS APPEALED. IS THAT CORRECT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES, 

09:01:28.353 --> 09:01:30.353
I 

09:01:31.602 --> 09:01:33.602
HAVE. AND -- HAVE 

09:01:37.217 --> 09:01:39.763
BEEN REQUESTED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS THE QUESTION? IS IT 

09:01:39.979 --> 09:01:42.485
SHALL THE RULING OF THE CHAIR BE
SUSTAINED? IS THAT THE QUESTION?

09:01:42.717 --> 09:01:45.047
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES, YES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:01:49.263 --> 09:01:52.230
NO. NO. WHAT MAY I ASK IS THE 
RULING OF THE CHAIR? MY POINT 

09:01:52.453 --> 09:01:54.453
WAS NOT ABOUT WHETHER IT'S 
APPROPRIATE FOR THEM 

09:01:57.195 --> 09:02:03.079
TO MAKE -- MY POINT IS TO STRIKE
THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE FALSE. 

09:02:03.290 --> 09:02:05.290
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATE 

09:02:08.509 --> 09:02:10.384
RESOLUTION 47 FOR THE SITUATION 
IS CORRECT. 

09:02:10.385 --> 09:02:12.385
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE 
RESOLUTION 47, 

09:02:17.244 --> 09:02:19.244
SECTION 4 IS CORRECT. THE 
PRIORITIES PRESENTATIONS ARE 

09:02:22.387 --> 09:02:25.439
NOT LIMITED 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THAT IS NOT MY

09:02:25.669 --> 09:02:28.154
MOTION. YOU HAVE RULED ON A 
MOTION, YOU HAVE RULED ON 

09:02:28.370 --> 09:02:30.370
SOMETHING THAT 

09:02:31.734 --> 09:02:34.143
WAS NOT WHAT I MOVED. WHAT I 
ASKED WAS, STATEMENTS WERE 

09:02:34.373 --> 09:02:37.573
ATTRIBUTED TO ME REPEATEDLY. AS 
TO WHICH I HAVE PERSONAL 

09:02:37.796 --> 09:02:39.796
KNOWLEDGE, BECAUSE I AM 

09:02:43.250 --> 09:02:45.250
THE SOURCE.

09:02:47.791 --> 09:02:49.791
I NEVER MADE THOSE STATEMENTS. 
ASKED THAT THEY BE STRICKEN. 

09:02:49.998 --> 09:02:52.691
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE BASED ON

09:02:52.908 --> 09:02:55.479
DEPOSITIONS, WHICH THEY ARE NOT.
IT IS SIMPLY BASED ON THE FACT 

09:02:55.699 --> 09:02:58.122
THAT I AM THE WITNESS. I AM THE 
ONLY WITNESS. THOSE STATEMENTS 

09:02:58.347 --> 09:03:00.354
ARE NOT TRUE AND ASKED THAT YOU 
STRIKE THEM. 

09:03:00.355 --> 09:03:02.852
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:03:06.287 --> 09:03:08.287
MR. PRESIDENT? 

09:03:11.500 --> 09:03:14.290
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JOE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE IS ON AN APPEAL. 

09:03:19.221 --> 09:03:21.221
MR. PRESIDENT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 

09:03:25.929 --> 09:03:27.929
THIS --

09:03:34.532 --> 09:03:36.967
IS -- THE YEAS AND DAYS HAVE 
BEEN ASKED. THEY HAVE 

09:03:40.832 --> 09:03:44.284
BEEN REQUESTED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PLEASE LET HIM EXPLAIN, MR. 

09:03:44.520 --> 09:03:46.520
PRESIDENT. WAS IT FALSE? WHAT 
WAS FALSE 

09:03:49.571 --> 09:03:51.571
ABOUT IT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THESE ARE IN ORDER UNDER 

09:03:53.022 --> 09:03:58.306
SENATE RESOLUTION -- UNLIMITED 
FOR THE RECORD PROVIDED FOR 

09:03:58.522 --> 09:04:01.237
SECTION ONE OF THE RESOLUTION. 
AND THAT HAS 

09:04:04.812 --> 09:04:07.352
BEEN APPEALED.  THE YEAS AND 
NAYS HAS BEEN COUNTED. WE WILL 

09:04:07.570 --> 09:04:09.570
CALL THE 

09:04:12.454 --> 09:04:20.861
ROLE.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MS. BALDWIN. MR. BRAZILE. MR.

09:04:21.082 --> 09:04:23.082
BENNETT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; POINT 

09:04:26.148 --> 09:04:28.148
OF CLARIFICATION. WHAT IS 

09:04:31.774 --> 09:04:33.774
THE QUESTION?

09:04:42.811 --> 09:04:45.286
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SUGGEST WE ABSENCE OF 

09:04:49.933 --> 09:04:51.933
A QUORUM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:04:55.350 --> 09:04:58.790
MS. BALDWIN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY, SO SENATOR MIKE LEE HAS

09:04:59.011 --> 09:05:00.757
OBJECTED TO STATEMENTS MADE BY 
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 

09:05:00.758 --> 09:05:02.758
DESCRIBING A SCENE 

09:05:05.921 --> 09:05:08.598
IN WHICH HE GOT A PHONE CALL 
ALLEGEDLY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 

09:05:08.811 --> 09:05:10.804
WHO WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR 
TOMMY TURBERVILLE. SENATOR LEE 

09:05:10.805 --> 09:05:12.805
SAYS THAT IS NOT 

09:05:15.876 --> 09:05:17.876
WHAT HAPPENED

09:05:20.216 --> 09:05:22.926
, SO HE IS ASKING FOR TO BE 
STRICKEN FROM THE RECORD. YOU 

09:05:23.152 --> 09:05:25.398
CAN SEE THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION
THERE AS SENATOR LEAHY, SENATOR 

09:05:25.611 --> 09:05:28.206
TEMPEST RESIDING OVER THIS WAS 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEEN

09:05:28.446 --> 09:05:30.966
AND WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY 
VOTING ON. TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS

09:05:31.196 --> 09:05:33.831
OUT NOW, AND WE WILL TRY TO 
MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON, I WANT 

09:05:34.050 --> 09:05:36.467
TO BRING IN JAMES HOMAN. WE ARE 
GOING TO KEEP WATCHING WHAT'S 

09:05:36.812 --> 09:05:39.223
HAPPENING ON THE FLOOR AS ALL OF
THE SENATORS GATHER AROUND. YOU 

09:05:39.446 --> 09:05:44.616
ARE REMINDING US ONLINE THAT 
EVEN AS THIS IS DISPUTED, 

09:05:44.845 --> 09:05:46.845
BECAUSE THERE IS A RECORDING 

09:05:49.266 --> 09:05:52.934
OF IT, THERE WAS A PHONE CALL ME
LATER BY RUDY GIULIANI TO TOMMY 

09:05:53.168 --> 09:05:55.168
TURBERVILLE ASKING HIM TO STALL 
AND DELAY THE VOTE 

09:05:59.783 --> 09:06:03.290
GOING FORWARD 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ULTIMATELY, WE WILL TALK 

09:06:03.505 --> 09:06:06.839
ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE 

09:06:10.810 --> 09:06:12.906
OF HOURS, BUT THERE WAS NO 
DISPUTE THAT RUDY GIULIANI 

09:06:13.118 --> 09:06:15.547
CALLED THE WRONG NUMBER. MIKE 
LEE DID 

09:06:20.365 --> 09:06:22.275
NOT ELABORATE ON WHAT EXACTLY 
HIS OBJECTION IS. 

09:06:22.276 --> 09:06:24.276
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU DECIDE 

09:06:27.414 --> 09:06:29.414
RUDY GIULIANI.

09:06:33.164 --> 09:06:35.183
WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED WHAT THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS THAT 

09:06:35.396 --> 09:06:37.564
TODAY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND 
THE PRESIDENT PICKED UP THE 

09:06:37.779 --> 09:06:39.779
PHONE AND CALLED LIKELY. HE 
MEANT TO CALL TOMMY TURBERVILLE.

09:06:39.971 --> 09:06:42.153
WHAT HE SAID IS THAT WE PASSED 
THE PHONE TO SENATOR 

09:06:42.363 --> 09:06:44.363
TURBERVILLE. WHAT WE HAVE A 

09:06:47.732 --> 09:06:50.355
RECORDING OF IS RUDY GIULIANI 
LATER ON THEN CALLING TOMMY 

09:06:50.576 --> 09:06:52.576
TURBERVILLE, ALSO TRYING TO 
REACH HIM TO HAVE HIM SLOWDOWN 

09:06:52.732 --> 09:06:54.732
THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:06:56.545 --> 09:06:58.545
EXACTLY. SO THE FIRST PART OF 
THAT, THESE 

09:07:02.975 --> 09:07:04.975
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE RELYING
EXTENSIVELY ON PRESS REPORTING. 

09:07:05.076 --> 09:07:07.076
BECAUSE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN 
DEPOSITIONS. THERE WERE HEARINGS

09:07:07.181 --> 09:07:09.181
DURING 

09:07:12.121 --> 09:07:16.179
THE UKRAINE IMPEACHMENT. SO YOU 
SAW A LOT TODAY DIFFERENT NEWS 

09:07:16.392 --> 09:07:18.392
ORGANIZATIONS BEING CITED. THE 
WASHINGTON POST WAS BEING 

09:07:22.687 --> 09:07:24.687
CITED OFF.

09:07:36.169 --> 09:07:38.378
THAT DID CALL AND LEAVE A 
MESSAGE THAT WAS AIMED FOR 

09:07:38.605 --> 09:07:40.605
TURBERVILLE AND APPARENTLY IN 

09:07:44.009 --> 09:07:46.009
COORDINATION WITH

09:07:49.779 --> 09:07:52.031
RUDY GIULIANI AT THE TOP OF THE 
VOICEMAIL, AS THE PRESIDENT'S 

09:07:52.276 --> 09:07:54.276
LAWYER. HE SAYS WE NEED YOUR 
HELP HOURS AFTER THE 

09:07:54.454 --> 09:07:56.454
INSTRUCTION. HOURS AFTER THE 
CAPITAL HAD 

09:07:59.736 --> 09:08:01.736
BEEN BREACHED 

09:08:22.099 --> 09:08:24.318
THE IMPORTANT POINT IS WHY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS DOING, WHAT 

09:08:24.532 --> 09:08:28.884
RUDY GIULIANI WANTED HIS YOU 
KNOW CLOSE ADVISORS AND 

09:08:29.104 --> 09:08:31.104
ATTORNEYS AT THE TIME 

09:08:34.491 --> 09:08:36.836
WERE DOING RATHER THAN TRYING TO
SCRAMBLE AND STOP THE HORRIBLE 

09:08:37.051 --> 09:08:41.564
RIOTING PLEASE IN THE CAPITAL 
WAS CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE 

09:08:41.782 --> 09:08:42.890
CERTIFICATION OF ELECTION 
RESULTS. RHONDA. 

09:08:42.891 --> 09:08:45.985
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S CORRECT. THAT IS WITH 
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

09:08:46.223 --> 09:08:48.467
WANTED TO END THE DAY ON. 
SHOWING WHAT TRUMP'S FRAME OF 

09:08:52.918 --> 09:08:57.510
MIND WAS WHEN HE WAS WATCHING TV
WHEN PEOPLE ASKING HIM TO DO 

09:08:57.725 --> 09:09:01.172
SOMETHING, THERE WAS A LOT OF 
DOCUMENTATION. AND ALSO NETWORK 

09:09:01.384 --> 09:09:03.384
THAT I INTERVIEWED WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES 

09:09:05.377 --> 09:09:07.754
AND SENATORS THAT WERE TRYING TO
GIVE THE PRESIDENT TO DO 

09:09:07.967 --> 09:09:09.967
SOMETHING. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS 
LAST 

09:09:12.280 --> 09:09:14.311
PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS HAVE 
BEEN. WAS INTERESTING ABOUT WHAT

09:09:14.547 --> 09:09:18.627
HAPPENED RIGHT NOW, THAT'S WHY 
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF 

09:09:18.842 --> 09:09:20.638
BACK-AND-FORTH AND CONFUSION 
THAT AT AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, 

09:09:20.639 --> 09:09:22.639
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM A NORMAL 
SENATE 

09:09:26.444 --> 09:09:31.040
FLOOR PRECEDING. THERE ARE RULES
THAT THEY HAVE TO GO BY. ONE OF 

09:09:31.269 --> 09:09:33.792
THEM IS THAT NO ONE IS ALLOWED 
TO TALK, OTHER THAN THE 

09:09:34.017 --> 09:09:35.815
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND THE 
DEFENSE LAWYERS. ANYTHING THAT 

09:09:35.816 --> 09:09:37.976
IS SAID TO THE CHAIR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK TO 

09:09:41.951 --> 09:09:43.951
THE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO CALL AND THE 

09:09:43.971 --> 09:09:45.971
MANAGER FOR A 

09:09:47.449 --> 09:09:50.914
BRIEF STATEMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER 

09:09:51.133 --> 09:09:53.133
QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY QUOTED 

09:09:56.708 --> 09:09:59.751
A NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT WHICH THEY 
DISTINGUISH SENATOR HAS TAKEN AN

09:09:59.964 --> 09:10:03.395
AFFECTION SHE. WE ARE HAPPY TO 
WITHDRAW -- ON THE GROUNDS THAT 

09:10:03.625 --> 09:10:09.381
IT IS, ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT IS
NOT TRUE. AND WE ARE GOING TO 

09:10:09.595 --> 09:10:12.305
WITHDRAW THIS EVENING. WITHOUT 
ANY PREJUDICE, THE ABILITY TO 

09:10:12.546 --> 09:10:14.546
RESUBMIT IT IF POSSIBLE. 

09:10:17.925 --> 09:10:20.455
WE CAN DEBATED. THIS IS MUCH ADO
ABOUT NOTHING, BECAUSE IS NOT 

09:10:20.670 --> 09:10:22.670
CRITICAL IN ANY WAY TO 

09:10:26.191 --> 09:10:28.191
OUR CASE.

09:10:30.722 --> 09:10:32.722
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE MANAGERS ISSUES 
STANDS. MR. LEE HAS WITHDRAWN 

09:10:32.925 --> 09:10:35.900
HIS REQUEST. WE MAY RELITIGATE 
IT TOMORROW IF WE HAVE TO. I 

09:10:40.823 --> 09:10:42.823
NOW ASK

09:10:46.990 --> 09:10:48.524
UNANIMOUS CONSENT, TRIAL 
ADJOURNED UNTIL 12:00 NOON 

09:10:48.525 --> 09:10:50.502
TOMORROW, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11 
AND THIS ALSO CONSTITUTES THE 

09:10:50.503 --> 09:10:52.503
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OBJECTION. SO SENATOR STANDS 

09:10:56.873 --> 09:10:58.873
THE JURY.

09:11:07.716 --> 09:11:09.897
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE STANDS ADJOURNED. 
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY, LEAVING A 

09:11:10.115 --> 09:11:12.505
LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION AND 
CHAOS THEY. I HAD TO POINT OUT 

09:11:12.744 --> 09:11:14.723
RHONDA IN JAMES, THIS IS LIKE 
PROCEDURAL CHAOS. OBVIOUSLY, 

09:11:14.724 --> 09:11:18.513
SENATOR LEE IS VERY UPSET. BUT 
THE WORD CHAOS IS REALLY A WORD 

09:11:18.738 --> 09:11:21.325
PUT IN CONTEXT BY THE HORRIBLE 
IMAGES WE SAW AUTHOR OF THE DAY.

09:11:21.537 --> 09:11:23.537
THIS IS LIKE RELATIVE 

09:11:26.758 --> 09:11:28.758
PROCEDURAL CHAOS.

09:11:32.296 --> 09:11:34.296
THIS PROCEDURAL ISSUE. LOST FOR 
A MOMENT THERE. OTHER SENATORS 

09:11:34.502 --> 09:11:36.692
SEEMED LOST IN RESPONSE. RHONDA,
JUST TALK IS AGAIN THROUGH HOW 

09:11:36.926 --> 09:11:40.429
THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY
MIGHT NORMALLY BE DOING EVERY 

09:11:40.652 --> 09:11:41.931
DAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WRIGHT, AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

09:11:41.932 --> 09:11:44.267
HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES 
THAN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING. SO 

09:11:44.489 --> 09:11:45.798
THERE ARE DIFFERENT 
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES THAT 

09:11:45.799 --> 09:11:47.987
THE SENATORS HAVE TO ABIDE BY. 
ONE OF THEM IS THAT 

09:11:52.541 --> 09:11:55.824
THEY CAN'T STAND UP OR SPEAK. 
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LOOK OR 

09:11:56.043 --> 09:11:58.417
READ ANYTHING VOLATILE IS GOING 
ON. SO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT 

09:12:03.120 --> 09:12:05.120
OF A

09:12:07.045 --> 09:12:08.798
WILD CARD THAT JUST HAPPEN 
THERE. WRECKING PROCEDURALLY, 

09:12:08.799 --> 09:12:11.417
THE LEADERS IN THE SENATE WERE 
NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THAT. 

09:12:11.629 --> 09:12:14.573
IF THEY COULD LOOK. THEY ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO PICK UP ANY SORT OF 

09:12:14.790 --> 09:12:17.251
ISSUE, ANY SORT OF MOTION. BRING
UP ANY SORT OF DEBATE DURING 

09:12:17.478 --> 09:12:19.729
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. SO I THINK 
THAT THAT WAS THE RECORDER THAT 

09:12:19.942 --> 09:12:21.943
THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE ON 

09:12:22.158 --> 09:12:24.214
HOW TO ADDRESS MIKE LEE'S 
COMPLAINED THERE. IT DOES LOOK 

09:12:24.427 --> 09:12:27.290
LIKE HE WAS A LITTLE BIT HEATED 
THAT HIS NAME WAS USED IN SOME 

09:12:27.513 --> 09:12:31.470
OF THE EVIDENCE THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS PUT FORTH TODAY. BUT 

09:12:31.689 --> 09:12:33.671
OVERALL, THEY HAVE ENOUGH 
EVIDENCE AND ENOUGH REPORTING TO

09:12:33.672 --> 09:12:37.994
SHOW WHAT TRUMP'S FRAME OF MIND 
WAS DURING -- IT WAS 

09:12:42.956 --> 09:12:47.350
SOMEWHAT RELISHING. THEY 
DISCUSSED THAT HE WAS NOT 

09:12:47.564 --> 09:12:51.822
ENGAGED, NOT REALLY APPEARING TO
CALL THIS OFF ANYTIME SOON. HE 

09:12:52.044 --> 09:12:56.220
ALSO SAW THE TIMELINE AS SOME 
REPRESENTATIVES GOING ON CABLE 

09:12:56.562 --> 09:12:58.562
NEWS. ASKING THE PRESIDENT TO 
CALL THIS OFF. 

09:13:02.865 --> 09:13:07.089
YOU HAD McCARTHY, WHO IS THE 
PUMP -- REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE

09:13:07.308 --> 09:13:09.806
HOUSE. HE WAS AMONG THEM, ASKING
THE PRESIDENT TO CALL US OFF. 

09:13:10.029 --> 09:13:14.163
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER 
OVERALL HAS TRIED TO ESTABLISH 

09:13:14.381 --> 09:13:16.594
THAT AFTER THE ATTACK, OR DURING
THE ATTACK, THE PRESIDENT WAS 

09:13:16.814 --> 09:13:20.082
CHECKED OUT AND DID NOT GIVE ANY
THOUGHT TO 

09:13:25.018 --> 09:13:27.629
THEIR SAFETY OF THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE. 

09:13:27.630 --> 09:13:32.797
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT, JAMES AND RHONDA, 
A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM THE 

09:13:33.011 --> 09:13:35.423
HILL POOLER, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE 
A NUMBER OF REPORTERS THAT COULD

09:13:35.635 --> 09:13:37.635
BE IN THAT CHAMBER BECAUSE OF 
COVID SAFETY 

09:13:41.879 --> 09:13:44.277
PRECAUTIONS. BY SAYING THAT AS 
THIS INFORMATION WAS GIVEN BY 

09:13:44.497 --> 09:13:46.497
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THE 
SENATOR LEE WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD

09:13:46.506 --> 09:13:48.506
VEHEMENTLY, WRITING DOWN AN 

09:13:51.835 --> 09:13:54.210
ECONOMIC AND SCRIBBLING THIS IS 
NOT WHAT HAPPENED. PASSING THAT 

09:13:54.427 --> 09:13:56.427
OFF TO DAVID SCHON, ONE OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS. SO 

09:13:56.596 --> 09:13:59.204
JAMES, THEY DISPATCHED WITH US 
FOR NOW. PUT IT ON THE BACK FOR 

09:14:01.858 --> 09:14:04.370
THE MOMENT. THEY WILL PICK IT UP
TOMORROW. YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE

09:14:04.585 --> 09:14:06.763
THE FATIGUE SETTING IN I THINK 
AMONG THE BODY TAKING 

09:14:06.764 --> 09:14:08.764
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S A GROUP OF 

09:14:12.163 --> 09:14:14.163
OLDER SENATORS.

09:14:17.501 --> 09:14:19.886
WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING IN WHAT
I THINK THE LEE KERFUFFLE SPEAKS

09:14:20.105 --> 09:14:22.105
TO WAS HOW MANY REPUBLICANS WERE
INVOKED AND CITED. REALLY 

09:14:22.288 --> 09:14:24.288
FASCINATING TO SEE HOW SOME OF 
THEM RESPOND. THE HOUSE 

09:14:26.653 --> 09:14:28.512
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WERE PRETTY
STRATEGIC ABOUT PICKING AND 

09:14:28.513 --> 09:14:31.607
CHOOSING WHICH REPUBLICANS THEY 
CITED. BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF 

09:14:31.819 --> 09:14:34.223
HOUSE REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY 
REFERENCED WITH SOMEONE LIKE 

09:14:34.456 --> 09:14:36.456
MIKE GALLAGHER, THE 

09:14:39.458 --> 09:14:41.111
REPUBLICAN FROM WISCONSIN WHO 
ULTIMATELY VOTED AGAINST 

09:14:41.112 --> 09:14:43.112
IMPEACHMENT. IT WILL BE 
FASCINATING TO SEE IN THE COMING

09:14:43.289 --> 09:14:47.193
HOURS HOW THEY RESPOND TO BEING 
CITED. IT WILL ALSO BE 

09:14:47.412 --> 09:14:49.412
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MIKE 
PENCE RESPONSE IF 

09:14:53.811 --> 09:14:58.134
AT ALL. I WOULD EXPECT TO NOT 
HEAR FROM HIM AT ALL. IT IS 

09:14:58.352 --> 09:15:00.328
REALLY REMARKABLE, SOME OF THE 
MOST DAMNING EVIDENCE AGAINST 

09:15:00.329 --> 09:15:02.571
TRUMP FROM THIS LAST STRETCH OF 
TODAY'S PRESENTATION HAD TO DO 

09:15:02.791 --> 09:15:06.955
WITH PENS BEING IN THE CAPITAL. 
PENS TRYING TO GET THE NATIONAL 

09:15:07.203 --> 09:15:09.203
GUARD TO COME, TRUMP 

09:15:11.152 --> 09:15:13.152
BEING DISENGAGED. AND TRUMP NOT 
CALLING PENS, NOT CHECKING ON 

09:15:13.355 --> 09:15:15.355
HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT, 
CONTINUING TO ATTACK HIM 

09:15:19.274 --> 09:15:21.856
ON TWITTER. YOU HAVE TO WONDER 
WHAT HE IS THINKING SURELY, HE 

09:15:22.077 --> 09:15:25.945
IS WATCHING THIS TRIAL. AND YOU 
KNOW, HE IS KIND OF POTENTIALLY 

09:15:26.167 --> 09:15:28.167
A KEY 

09:15:29.644 --> 09:15:32.250
WITNESS HERE. BUT WE HAVE NOT 
REALLY HEARD HIM. WE SAW HIM 

09:15:32.465 --> 09:15:34.465
OBVIOUSLY ON JANUARY 6. BUT 
THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE LIKE 

09:15:38.782 --> 09:15:41.322
THAT WHO YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, WE
LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 

09:15:41.545 --> 09:15:43.900
THINKING AS THIS IS ALL PLAYING 
ON. 

09:15:43.901 --> 09:15:49.379
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, THE MESSAGES THAT 
REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO SEND 

09:15:49.593 --> 09:15:51.593
TO THE RIOTERS, TO PRESIDENT 

09:15:55.771 --> 09:15:58.603
TRUMP THROUGH FOX NEWS, THROUGH 
MAKING THEIR OWN STATEMENTS, 

09:15:58.821 --> 09:16:02.768
THROUGH SENDING OUT THEIR OWN 
TWEETS REALLY DO SPEAK TO THE 

09:16:02.982 --> 09:16:04.982
VACUUM THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
LEAVING THAT AFTERNOON BY NOT 

09:16:05.173 --> 09:16:08.085
COMING OUT AND FIRMLY CONDEMNING
WHAT WAS HAPPENING. 

09:16:08.086 --> 09:16:11.935
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEY WERE 
ABLE TO 

09:16:16.721 --> 09:16:21.786
SHOW THAT IT WAS QUITE CERTAIN 
THAT IT TOOK SO LONG FOR HIM TO 

09:16:22.000 --> 09:16:24.189
MAKE A STATEMENT THAT HE HAD 
MADE AROUND 4:00. THEY ALSO 

09:16:24.405 --> 09:16:26.640
POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S NO 
EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS INVOLVED AT

09:16:26.866 --> 09:16:29.590
ALL IN THE DECISION TO BRING THE
NATIONAL GUARD IN. SO THE HOUSE 

09:16:29.802 --> 09:16:31.880
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THEY 
WANTED THE LAST PART OF THIS DAY

09:16:32.093 --> 09:16:34.950
TO REALLY LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT
THE PRESIDENT IN THE BEGINNING, 

09:16:35.165 --> 09:16:39.598
HIS WORDS LED TO THE ATTACK. THE
ATTACK HAPPENED AND HE DID NOT 

09:16:39.815 --> 09:16:43.028
SEEM TO WANT TO CALL IT OFF FOR 
SOME TIME AND SEEM TO BE PUSHED 

09:16:43.242 --> 09:16:45.450
BY FELLOW REPUBLICANS AND AIDES 
WHO SAID YOU'VE GOT TO DO 

09:16:45.669 --> 09:16:50.778
SOMETHING AND HE PUT OUT THE 
VIDEO OF COURSE. TODAY ALSO SHOW

09:16:50.994 --> 09:16:54.581
THE CONTRADICTION OF THAT VIDEO,
OF HIM SAYING IT WAS AN UNFAIR 

09:16:54.808 --> 09:16:57.258
ELECTION. GO HOME, WE LOVE YOU. 
AND HE ALSO TWEETED LATER ON 

09:16:57.487 --> 09:17:01.677
THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A
LAWFUL ELECTION IS THROWN OUT. A

09:17:06.499 --> 09:17:08.813
LANDSLIDE ELECTION IS THROWN 
OUT. AND OF COURSE, THAT IS 

09:17:09.030 --> 09:17:11.030
MISINFORMATION AND NOT TRUE. IT 
WAS NOT A LANDSLIDE ON 

09:17:15.441 --> 09:17:18.651
HIS END. BUT THEY SHOW THIS 
WHOLE TIMELINE OF HOW HE TREATED

09:17:18.866 --> 09:17:21.094
THE INSURRECTION TO SORT OF 
BOLSTER THEIR WHOLE CASE THAT HE

09:17:21.308 --> 09:17:24.196
WAS A PART OF IT. HE WAS NOT 
JUST A BYSTANDER. THIS JUST KIND

09:17:24.428 --> 09:17:26.177
OF AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENED IN 
THESE PASSIONATE SUPPORTERS OF 

09:17:26.178 --> 09:17:28.476
HIS GOT TO THE CAPITAL. THEY 
WANTED TO SHOW THE WHOLE 

09:17:28.690 --> 09:17:30.373
TIMELINE AND HOW INVOLVED HE 
WAS. 

09:17:30.374 --> 09:17:34.264
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE 
SENATORS LEAVE THE FAMILIAR SITE

09:17:34.477 --> 09:17:40.339
ANY OF THE JOURNALISTS. THEY 
MOVE FAST, RON AND JAMES. WHAT 

09:17:40.550 --> 09:17:45.251
DID YOU CALL THEM? A JERROD 
TUCKER C? THEY SHOULD GET OUT OF

09:17:45.479 --> 09:17:47.479
THERE FAST. CATCH 

09:17:50.799 --> 09:17:53.417
THEIR RIGHTS. THEY'VE GOT 
ANOTHER BIG DAY TOMORROW. I DO 

09:17:53.633 --> 09:17:56.463
WANT TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND 
TALK ABOUT WHAT IS LEFT FOR THE 

09:17:56.682 --> 09:17:58.879
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TO DO. SO 
JAMES, CAN STEP BACK AND THE 

09:17:59.098 --> 09:18:01.098
PICTURE, GO OVER WHAT'S NEXT 
PRESUMABLY FOR 

09:18:04.816 --> 09:18:07.151
THEM TOMORROW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RAY. SO WE DID GET KIND OF 

09:18:07.366 --> 09:18:11.824
THE FULL SWEEP. THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS HAVE NOW USED HALF OF 

09:18:12.043 --> 09:18:14.504
THEIR TIME. THEY WERE ALLOTTED 
16 HOURS. THE HAVE USED EIGHT OF

09:18:14.731 --> 09:18:17.168
THOSE HOURS. A MORE HOURS 
TOMORROW. WE HAVE NOW SEEN THE 

09:18:17.383 --> 09:18:20.656
WHOLE RUN-UP TO JANUARY 6 AND 
KIND OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING 

09:18:20.882 --> 09:18:22.882
DURING 

09:18:25.003 --> 09:18:27.973
THE PRIOR. I ASSUME THAT WE WILL
SEE MORE ON WHAT FOLLOWED IN THE

09:18:28.191 --> 09:18:30.191
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH 

09:18:32.321 --> 09:18:35.404
OF THAT AND WE WILL GO BACK AND 
UNPACK AND SORT OF ADD MORE MEAT

09:18:35.762 --> 09:18:40.150
TO THE BONES ON VARIOUS THINGS 
RELATED TO THE ACTUAL SINGLE 

09:18:40.365 --> 09:18:43.694
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT, WHICH IS
IN SIMON. I EXPECT THAT WE WILL 

09:18:43.917 --> 09:18:45.917
HEAR THE TERM DERELICTION OF 
DUTY A LOT 

09:18:50.315 --> 09:18:53.979
MORE TOMORROW. WE HAVE A LITTLE 
TEASE OF SOME OF THE EVIDENCE. I

09:18:54.219 --> 09:18:57.036
THINK WE CAN EXPECT MORE. THEY 
SHOW THE VIDEO OF THE Q AND ON 

09:18:57.254 --> 09:18:59.456
SCHAUMANN. SAW JOAQUIN -- FROM 
TEXAS JOKING. I'M SURE YOU HAVE 

09:19:02.189 --> 09:19:04.719
SEEN HIM. HE WAS THE ONE THAT 
WAS STANDING ON THE SENATE 

09:19:04.935 --> 09:19:07.104
ROSTER AND MOVING FROM THE DC 
JAIL TO THE VIRGINIA JAIL 

09:19:07.332 --> 09:19:09.969
BECAUSE HE WILL ONLY EAT ORGANIC
FOOD. BUT HE IS ON VIDEO THERE 

09:19:10.191 --> 09:19:14.015
SAYING WE ARE LEAVING NOW 
BECAUSE TRUMP TOLD US TO. HE 

09:19:14.235 --> 09:19:16.235
SAID WE WON 

09:19:19.387 --> 09:19:22.462
THE DAY. AND WE SENT A MESSAGE 
TO MIKE PENCE AND TO CONGRESS 

09:19:22.673 --> 09:19:24.766
AND WE STOPPED THE CERTIFICATION
FROM HAPPENING FOR NOW. AND 

09:19:24.983 --> 09:19:27.397
TRUMP IS GOING TO TELL US TO GO 
HOME. THAT WAS PARTICULARLY 

09:19:27.620 --> 09:19:30.032
COMPELLING BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT
THE MEMBERS OF THE MOB, AT LEAST

09:19:30.249 --> 09:19:33.442
SOME OF THEM ARE DIRECTLY 
LISTENING TO TRUMP. THEY THOUGHT

09:19:33.669 --> 09:19:35.669
THAT THEY WERE 

09:19:37.948 --> 09:19:40.142
THERE AT TRUMP'S BEHEST AND ON 
HIS BEHALF. AND I THINK 

09:19:40.358 --> 09:19:43.251
DEMOCRATS PLAN TO UNPACK THAT 
THE MORE TOMORROW. TO 

09:19:46.272 --> 09:19:50.010
TIE TRUMP TO THE ACTUAL 
INSURRECTION. BECAUSE WE KNOW 

09:19:50.229 --> 09:19:52.229
THAT THE DEFENSE STRATEGY IS 
GOING 

09:19:56.167 --> 09:20:01.266
TO BE TO DECOUPLE TRUMP FROM THE
INSURRECTION IS MUCH AS 

09:20:01.480 --> 09:20:04.102
POSSIBLE. SO THEY WENT TO CEMENT
THOSE TIES. SO WE CAN EXPECT TO 

09:20:04.318 --> 09:20:06.318
SEE A LOT MORE VIDEO LIKE WHAT 
WE 

09:20:10.388 --> 09:20:12.388
SAW TODAY.

09:20:16.750 --> 09:20:18.750
COMMENTING WHAT WAS ON 

09:20:22.376 --> 09:20:24.376
SOCIAL MEDIA.

09:20:27.117 --> 09:20:29.117
BROADCASTING IT LIVE TO EVERYONE

09:20:32.946 --> 09:20:37.767
WATCHING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL TO 

09:20:37.989 --> 09:20:40.435
COVER. IN THOSE HOURS. IT WAS A 
GOOD REMINDER OF 

09:20:45.320 --> 09:20:47.320
THE PRESENTATION

09:20:49.880 --> 09:20:52.112
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH THE USE

09:20:57.123 --> 09:20:59.198
RIOTERS. LITERALLY THREE HOURS 
AFTER THE CAPITAL WAS FIRST 

09:20:59.410 --> 09:21:01.410
BREACHED. SOME OF THE HORRIFIC 
SCENES, THE GHASTLY IMAGES 

09:21:04.914 --> 09:21:06.914
WERE LIKE 

09:21:10.125 --> 09:21:12.671
THREE -- AS WE REMEMBER AND 
EVERYONE 

09:21:17.642 --> 09:21:19.642
WAS WATCHING

09:21:22.184 --> 09:21:24.369
IT HOURS AFTER THE BREACH 
ESSENTIALLY. SO I THINK YOU WILL

09:21:24.588 --> 09:21:26.588
SEE SOME MORE OF 

09:21:30.039 --> 09:21:33.676
THOSE HOURS CONTINUING 
INDECISION OF THE WHITE HOUSE. 

09:21:33.890 --> 09:21:35.890
PAST -- HAVING 

09:21:39.183 --> 09:21:41.183
TO INTERVENE.

09:21:46.361 --> 09:21:50.071
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S WATCH THE NEW EVIDENCE 
PRESENTED TODAY. HERE IS 

09:21:50.287 --> 09:21:52.287
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS STACY PARR 
SKIN REINFORCING THE 

09:21:55.498 --> 09:21:57.609
THREAT ON DONALD TRUMP'S OWN 
VICE PRESIDENT. THIS WAS THE 

09:21:57.827 --> 09:22:02.430
FOOTAGES MIKE PENCE AND JUST 
WHAT HE EXPERIENCED THAT DAY. 

09:22:02.659 --> 09:22:04.659
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS 
STILL IN 

09:22:08.833 --> 09:22:10.833
THE ROOM

09:22:16.837 --> 09:22:18.837
THIS NEXT SECURITY VIDEO SHOWS 

09:22:22.667 --> 09:22:25.684
THAT EVACUATION. HIS MOVEMENTS 
ARE DEPICTED BY THE ORANGE DOT 

09:22:25.903 --> 09:22:28.088
IN OUR MODEL. THE RED AND BLUE 
DOTS REPRESENT THE LOCATION 

09:22:28.313 --> 09:22:33.485
WHERE OFFICE AND -- OFFICER 
GOODMAN LED THE CHAMBER JUST 

09:22:38.308 --> 09:22:42.735
MOMENTS AGO? YOU CAN SEE VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE AND HIS FAMILY 

09:22:42.947 --> 09:22:44.947
QUICKLY MOVE DOWN 

09:22:48.267 --> 09:22:50.267
THE STAIRS?

09:23:11.895 --> 09:23:14.113
THE MOB ARE LOOKING FOR VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE BECAUSE OF HIS 

09:23:14.341 --> 09:23:16.341
PATRIOTISM. BECAUSE THE 

09:23:19.554 --> 09:23:21.554
VICE PRESIDENT

09:23:23.486 --> 09:23:25.486
HE OVERTURNED REAL 

09:23:28.899 --> 09:23:30.899
EXPERIENCE WITH. BUT IMPEACHMENT
MANAGERS STACY POSTURE 

09:23:35.184 --> 09:23:37.822
EARLIER TODAY. WE CAN ONLY 
SPECULATE ON THE FUTURE 

09:23:38.037 --> 09:23:41.827
RELATIONSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP AND
MIKE PENCE BUT IT IS 

09:23:46.782 --> 09:23:49.819
JUST SHOCKING TO THINK ABOUT THE
VICE PRESIDENT BEING TRAPPED IN 

09:23:50.055 --> 09:23:52.274
THE CAPITAL WITH HIS FAMILY. AND
THE PRESIDENT NOT CALLING HIM, 

09:23:52.486 --> 09:23:54.486
CHECKING UP 

09:23:57.349 --> 09:23:59.349
ON HER.

09:24:04.933 --> 09:24:06.915
YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY DOING 
NOTHING TO SAVE THE VICE 

09:24:06.916 --> 09:24:08.916
PRESIDENT WHO WAS UNDER THREAT 
IN THE GROUP 

09:24:13.194 --> 09:24:15.201
MOMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, AND EVEN MIKE 

09:24:15.413 --> 09:24:17.614
PENCE'S FAMILY WAS HERE. HIS 
WIFE, HIS DAUGHTER, BUT ALSO HIS

09:24:17.828 --> 09:24:22.965
BROTHER IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.
HE HAD A LOT OF HIS IMMEDIATE 

09:24:23.188 --> 09:24:25.854
FAMILY IN THIS CONGRESS WHO WERE
IN DAVE -- GRAVE DANGER. I THINK

09:24:26.078 --> 09:24:28.991
THE REASON WE HEARD THEM BRING 
UP MIKE PENCE OFTEN IS BECAUSE 

09:24:29.211 --> 09:24:32.105
A, HE IS A PART OF THE PARTY OF 
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT THE

09:24:32.327 --> 09:24:37.137
MANAGERS TRIED TO APPEAL TO. WE 
SEE DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS LEADING

09:24:37.351 --> 09:24:42.516
UP TO THE SIXTH WHEN HE GIVES 
THAT SPEECH AND TALKS ABOUT 

09:24:42.734 --> 09:24:44.734
PENS. WE ARE COUNTING 

09:24:48.343 --> 09:24:53.327
ON YOU. EVEN SAYING BEFORE WHEN 
HE WAS IN GEORGIA, HE 

09:24:57.901 --> 09:25:01.394
SAID THAT WE SET OUR EYES ON 
MIKE PENCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING

09:25:01.607 --> 09:25:04.309
FOR US AND IF HE DOESN'T, NOT 
GOING TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. 

09:25:04.523 --> 09:25:06.971
THIS IS PART OF THE STRATEGY 
THAT THEY WANT TO USE. DONALD 

09:25:11.103 --> 09:25:13.398
TRUMP'S WORDS REALLY HAVING AN 
IMPACT ON THE DEFENSE THAT 

09:25:13.617 --> 09:25:15.617
HAPPENED HERE AT 

09:25:18.822 --> 09:25:20.822
THE CAPITAL.

09:25:27.013 --> 09:25:29.258
SHOWING ALL OF THE RHETORIC 
ABOUT PENS AND SEEING PENS IN 

09:25:29.473 --> 09:25:31.702
THE TYPE OF DANGER WHERE THE 
CROWD IS CHANTING HANG MIKE 

09:25:31.916 --> 09:25:33.916
PENCE. THEY HAVE THE GALLOWS 
CONSTRUCTED ON THE 

09:25:37.924 --> 09:25:40.235
CAPITAL LAWN. MANY PEOPLE WERE 
IDENTIFYING PENS AS THE CORE 

09:25:40.455 --> 09:25:42.455
PERSON THEY WERE GOING AFTER 
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAVE BEEN 

09:25:42.641 --> 09:25:44.641
TALKING ABOUT IT FOR 

09:25:46.324 --> 09:25:48.324
SO LONG. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE OTHER PERSON WE HAVE 

09:25:48.427 --> 09:25:50.427
HEARD A LOT 

09:25:53.575 --> 09:25:55.575
ABOUT TODAY

09:26:00.746 --> 09:26:03.074
THE CASE BEING LAID OUT WAS 
ABOUT SPEAKER PELOSI. ALL 

09:26:03.293 --> 09:26:05.265
LAWMAKERS WERE IN DANGER. WE SAW
THAT THROUGHOUT THE 

09:26:05.266 --> 09:26:07.214
PRESENTATION. SPEAKER PELOSI WAS
ALSO A SUBJECT OF VITRIOL, 

09:26:07.215 --> 09:26:08.958
HATRED AND ANGER. STORMING THE 
CAPITAL. THE IMPEACHMENT 

09:26:08.959 --> 09:26:15.196
MANAGERS MADE A DIRECT LINE 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

09:26:15.416 --> 09:26:17.416
NAME-CALLING AND RHETORIC 

09:26:19.637 --> 09:26:21.637
AGAINST HER TO WERE DEVELOPED 
TODAY ON JANUARY 

09:26:24.307 --> 09:26:24.870
6. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

09:26:24.871 --> 09:26:27.585
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SPEAKER PELOSI CHOSE THESE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. THE 

09:26:27.799 --> 09:26:32.088
RABBIT, BY THE SPEAKER TO AND 
THEY KNOW HER WELL. AND THEY ARE

09:26:32.318 --> 09:26:34.318
ALL ON THE 

09:26:35.898 --> 09:26:38.006
HOUSE SIDE. AND CLEARLY, THEY 
WERE USING THE NICKNAME THE 

09:26:38.735 --> 09:26:40.735
TRUMP HAD FOR HER BUT 

09:26:43.000 --> 09:26:45.000
IT WAS A HORROR 

09:26:48.627 --> 09:26:53.024
MOVIE WATCHING THEM SAY WE ARE 
COMING FOR YOU NANCY. TO SEE 

09:26:53.236 --> 09:26:55.236
THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID BREECH 

09:26:59.397 --> 09:27:02.518
HER OFFICE. WE LEARNED TODAY 
THAT 

09:27:07.523 --> 09:27:10.026
HE HAD AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL 
STUN GUN THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 

09:27:10.252 --> 09:27:12.252
INCAPACITATED. WE 

09:27:15.042 --> 09:27:17.843
HAD THE AUDIO THAT WAS 
ORIGINALLY OBTAINED BY THE 

09:27:18.064 --> 09:27:21.203
WASHINGTON POST COLLEAGUES OF 
THE STAFFER AND ONE OF PELOSI'S 

09:27:21.434 --> 09:27:23.434
STAFFERS. LISTENING TO PEOPLE 
BANG ON THE DOOR 

09:27:26.487 --> 09:27:28.710
FOR HOURS. THERE'S NO QUESTION 
THAT WE ALSO LEARNED TODAY THAT 

09:27:32.376 --> 09:27:34.483
PELOSI WAS EVACUATED TO A REMOTE
LOCATION TAKEN AWAY FROM 

09:27:37.863 --> 09:27:39.863
THE CAPITAL. PELOSI WAS CLEARLY 
ONE OF 

09:27:42.948 --> 09:27:45.599
THE TARGETS. TRUMP MADE NO 
SECRET OF THAT. AND ONE OF THE 

09:27:45.838 --> 09:27:47.838
THINGS THAT'S 

09:27:50.595 --> 09:27:55.133
BEEN INTERESTING AS WE LEARN 
MORE ABOUT THE 200 POSTMAN 

09:27:55.358 --> 09:27:57.943
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED IS HOW 
MANY OF THEM HAVE HISTORIES OF 

09:27:58.181 --> 09:28:00.181
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, OF ABUSING 
WOMEN, 

09:28:02.441 --> 09:28:04.441
OF OTHERWISE CRIMINALLY CHARGED 
MISOGYNY. THAT IS NOT SALLY'S 

09:28:04.660 --> 09:28:06.660
SURPRISE. VERY OFTEN, WHEN THERE

09:28:10.105 --> 09:28:13.269
ARE SHOOTERS, THAT IS THE 
BIGGEST , THE BIGGEST 

09:28:18.011 --> 09:28:20.011
RED FLAG.

09:28:23.378 --> 09:28:25.378
LOOKING FOR BLOODLUST FOR NANCY 
PELOSI. THEY WERE JUST VERY 

09:28:27.229 --> 09:28:28.607
VIOLENT, ENRAGED. TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS. 

09:28:28.608 --> 09:28:30.608
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, IT HAS 

09:28:32.715 --> 09:28:34.917
BEEN REPEATED OVER AND OVER BY 
PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

09:28:35.150 --> 09:28:36.994
SAFETY THAT THAT SORT OF 
NAME-CALLING AND DEHUMANIZING 

09:28:36.995 --> 09:28:38.995
AND ANGRY RHETORIC WILL 

09:28:41.451 --> 09:28:43.562
EVENTUALLY LEAD TO VIOLENCE OR 
ATTEMPTS AT VIOLENCE. THIS IS 

09:28:43.780 --> 09:28:45.780
ONLY ONE OF 

09:28:48.909 --> 09:28:52.805
THE INCIDENTS WHERE IT HAS. I 
WENT TO PLAY A CLIP FROM THAT 

09:28:53.040 --> 09:28:55.053
AFTERNOON, JANUARY 6. JAMES WAS 
JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS. THIS 

09:28:59.268 --> 09:29:03.123
IS FROM JUST OUTSIDE THE DOORS 
THAT LEAD TO SPEAKER PELOSI'S 

09:29:03.405 --> 09:29:05.798
SUITE AT THE CAPITAL. THIS IS 
FROM TIMELINE OF EVENTS THAT 

09:29:06.039 --> 09:29:08.090
WERE PUT TOGETHER BY WASHINGTON 
POST VISUAL FORENSICS TEAM. 

09:29:08.340 --> 09:29:10.139
WATCH THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI'S 

09:29:10.140 --> 09:29:12.624
SUITE. MEMBERS OF THE STAFF HIDE
UNDER A TABLE IN A 

09:29:17.153 --> 09:29:20.772
CONFERENCE ROOM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE POUNDING ON DOORS, 

09:29:20.986 --> 09:29:22.986
TRYING TO 

09:29:26.087 --> 09:29:28.087
FIND HER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WRITERS GATHER NEAR THE HOUSE

09:29:32.249 --> 09:29:34.249
CHAMBER ENTRANCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, WE CAME 

09:29:37.934 --> 09:29:40.049
THIS FAR, WHAT YOU SAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DRAG THEM OUT! 

09:29:40.050 --> 09:29:44.930
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DRAG THEM OUT AND HANG THEM 
OUT? WE SAW TODAY, RHONDA, 

09:29:45.152 --> 09:29:47.152
FOOTAGE OF SOME OF THESE 
ATTACKERS GOING DOWN THE HALL, 

09:29:47.350 --> 09:29:49.984
BRINGING IN THE DOOR OF SPEAKER 
PELOSI'S OFFICE AND ENCOUNTERING

09:29:50.205 --> 09:29:54.355
A SECOND DOOR THAT HAD BEEN 
CLOSED AND BARRICADED IF I AM 

09:29:54.574 --> 09:29:58.549
CALLING CORRECTLY. THEY KEPT 
MOVING ON, BUT IT WAS JUST SO 

09:29:58.922 --> 09:30:02.702
CHILLING TO THINK ABOUT THE 
STAFFERS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE ON 

09:30:02.922 --> 09:30:05.349
THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE DOORS AS
THE ATTACKERS WENT DOWN HALLS 

09:30:07.393 --> 09:30:11.425
LIKE THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, WE DO KNOW THAT

09:30:11.639 --> 09:30:15.165
SHE WAS TAKEN OFF SITE COME OFF 
THE COMPLEX COMPLETELY, FOR HER 

09:30:15.375 --> 09:30:18.394
STAFF WAS STILL VERY VULNERABLE 
IN MANY OF THEM ARE VERY YOUNG. 

09:30:18.629 --> 09:30:20.629
SPEAKING TO A STAFFER A FEW DAYS
AGO ABOUT 

09:30:25.210 --> 09:30:27.210
THEIR EXPERIENCE

09:30:34.804 --> 09:30:36.804
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S APPARENT THAT

09:30:39.885 --> 09:30:43.411
MEMBERS OF THE MOB MAY HAVE 
HARMED ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH 

09:30:43.626 --> 09:30:47.392
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI. WE 
FOUND OUT THAT ONE OF THE 

09:30:47.615 --> 09:30:52.732
ORGANIZERS OF THE MILITIA SAID 
THAT THEY WANTED TO KILL ANYONE 

09:30:52.946 --> 09:30:54.946
THEY GOT THEIR HANDS ON.

09:31:06.291 --> 09:31:11.877
THERE WAS CONCERN FOR ANYONE WHO
MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE WRONG PLACE

09:31:12.101 --> 09:31:16.636
AT THE WRONG TIME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WERE TO ABOUT WHAT TO 

09:31:16.849 --> 09:31:20.410
EXPECT FOR TOMORROW. WHAT YOU 
SEE IS THE JOB LEFT TO DO BEFORE

09:31:20.619 --> 09:31:24.247
WE GET TO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE 
TRIAL WHICH WILL BE THE DEFENSE 

09:31:24.459 --> 09:31:26.459
TEAM TAKING CENTRAL STAGE

09:31:28.838 --> 09:31:30.613
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THE IMPEACHMENT 

09:31:30.614 --> 09:31:36.361
MANAGERS WILL EXPAND ON WHAT 
THEY TALKED ABOUT. I THINK IT 

09:31:36.574 --> 09:31:39.114
WILL BE ONE OF THE LAST TIMES 
THAT THEY CAN SPEAK IN THE 

09:31:39.466 --> 09:31:43.321
TRIAL. THE WHAT HAPPENS IS IT 
WILL MOVE ON TO TRUMP'S DEFENSE 

09:31:43.535 --> 09:31:48.783
TEAM. AND THEN THERE WILL BE 
FOUR HOURS WHERE THEY WILL BE 

09:31:49.003 --> 09:31:54.076
ABLE TO WRITE THEIR QUESTIONS 
FOR BOTH SIDES. THIS WILL BE AN 

09:31:54.287 --> 09:31:56.287
IMPORTANT DAY BECAUSE THEY WILL

09:32:00.108 --> 09:32:02.108
BUILD ON WHAT THEY ESTABLISH 
TODAY. THERE MAY BE SOME 

09:32:02.288 --> 09:32:04.288
REPETITION BUT OVERALL THEY WANT
TO CONTINUE TO ESTABLISH THAT 

09:32:04.464 --> 09:32:06.464
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS 
THAT LED TO THE EVENTS.

09:32:09.871 --> 09:32:12.385
EVEN THOUGH WE SAW A LOT OF NEW 
SECURITY FOOTAGE MATERIAL. ONE 

09:32:12.594 --> 09:32:15.226
OF THE KEY PARTS OF THIS DAY WAS
EARLIER IN THE MORNING. WHEN 

09:32:15.434 --> 09:32:18.645
THEY LOOKED AT THE TIMELINE OF 
TRUMPS RHETORIC REGARDING THE 

09:32:18.858 --> 09:32:20.858
ELECTION AND HOW THAT BUILT INTO

09:32:32.204 --> 09:32:34.557
JANUARYT 6th. THIS PROVES THAT 
IT WAS AN ISOLATED OR RANDOM. IT

09:32:34.774 --> 09:32:39.264
WAS SOMETHING HE HAD TALKED 
ABOUT . AND THOSE WHO PREPARED 

09:32:40.079 --> 09:32:49.882
CAME PREPARED TO DO HARM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S LISTEN TO THE LEAD AND 

09:32:50.282 --> 09:32:54.905
PEACH MEANT MANAGER RASK IN 
ILLUSTRATING HIS POINT EARLIER 

09:32:55.121 --> 09:32:57.121
TODAY.

09:33:00.440 --> 09:33:07.354
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MOST AMERICANS HAVE DISMISSED
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RHETORIC BY 

09:33:07.754 --> 09:33:11.667
REFERRING TO JUSTICE HOLMES 
PHRASE THAT YOU CAN'T SHOUT FIRE

09:33:12.378 --> 09:33:14.378
IN A

09:33:18.117 --> 09:33:20.057
CROWDED THEATER. IT DOESN'T 
BEGIN TO CAPTURE HOW OFF-BASE 

09:33:20.058 --> 09:33:25.443
THE ARGUMENT IS. THIS IS WORSE 
THAN SOMEONE WHO SHOUTS FIRE IN 

09:33:25.666 --> 09:33:28.023
A CROWDED THEATER. THIS IS A 
CASE WHERE THE TOP DOWN FIRE 

09:33:28.240 --> 09:33:30.240
CHIEF WHO IS PAID TO PUT OUT 
FIRES

09:33:37.413 --> 09:33:40.193
SINCE MOB NOT TO YELL FIRE, BUT 
TO SET THE THEATER ON FIRE. AND 

09:33:40.407 --> 09:33:43.376
WHEN THE FIRE ALARMS GO OFF IN 
THE CALL STARTED SLIDING INTO 

09:33:43.596 --> 09:33:46.547
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ASKING FOR 
HELP. DOES NOTHING BUT SIT BACK,

09:33:46.759 --> 09:33:50.256
ENCOURAGE THE MOB TO CONTINUE 
THE RAMPAGE AND WATCH AS THE 

09:33:50.470 --> 09:33:54.476
FIRE SPREADS ON TV. WITH GLEE 
AND DELIGHT. 

09:33:54.477 --> 09:34:02.193
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS LEAD IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS RASKIN.  AS CONGRESSMAN

09:34:02.402 --> 09:34:07.092
RASKIN MADE THAT ANALOGY.  THEY 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY TRIED TO SHOW

09:34:07.825 --> 09:34:13.059
AN LAYOUT THAT EXACT POINT THAT 
TRUMP WAS THAT A FIRE CHIEF THE 

09:34:13.275 --> 09:34:15.275
DID INSIDE THE MOB

09:34:21.088 --> 09:34:28.605
AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO BURN. BUT 
THAT WAS A TOUCHDOWN ANALOGY. 

09:34:28.821 --> 09:34:35.841
AND IT DID SET THE TONE AND LAY 
THE GROUNDWORK.

09:34:40.176 --> 09:34:42.375
THE CASE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT
HAD TRUMP IMMEDIATELY

09:34:47.490 --> 09:34:50.081
SAID AS SOON AS THE CAPITAL WAS 
BREACHED TO GET OUT THIS IS 

09:34:50.299 --> 09:34:54.189
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. WE ARE 
SENDING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. 

09:34:54.950 --> 09:34:57.805
THE CULMINATION EVEN MONTHS 
BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN

09:35:02.520 --> 09:35:04.886
TRUMP REFUSED TO COMMIT TO A 
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. HIS 

09:35:05.095 --> 09:35:07.593
DECLARATION THAT HE COULD NOT 
POSSIBLY LOSE. CREATED THIS 

09:35:08.005 --> 09:35:12.503
METAPHORICAL PICTURE OF A FIRE 
CHIEF THAT WAS PUTTING DOWN ALL 

09:35:12.713 --> 09:35:14.981
THIS KINDLING. AND THEN THE 
LIGHTING THE MATCH AND NOT GOING

09:35:15.194 --> 09:35:21.295
TO SEND HELP IS HIS OWN PEOPLE 
WERE STARTING THE FIRE. THIS WAS

09:35:21.503 --> 09:35:25.625
AN ANALOGY THAT CAPTURES THE 
ARGUMENT THAT THEY WERE TRYING 

09:35:25.844 --> 09:35:32.998
TO LAY OUT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROLES OF

09:35:33.214 --> 09:35:38.879
THE VARIOUS IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS
TODAY AND HOW THEY AS A TEAM HAD

09:35:39.089 --> 09:35:41.089
A COHESIVE ARGUMENT AND THE 
STRATEGY WHICH IS SO DIFFERENT 

09:35:41.229 --> 09:35:44.180
FROM WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY. 
TRUMPS LAWYERS SEEM LIKE THEY 

09:35:44.389 --> 09:35:46.389
CAME FROM A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE.

09:35:49.845 --> 09:35:52.001
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK YOU'RE SEEING THE 
LEVEL OF PREPARATION THAT HAS 

09:35:52.230 --> 09:35:55.541
GONE INTO THE PROSECUTION'S 
CASE. THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 

09:35:55.757 --> 09:35:57.941
THERE ARE NINE OF THEM AND THEY 
WERE LED BY

09:36:02.031 --> 09:36:08.532
MANAGER RASKIN.  ONE OF THE 
FIRST PEOPLE WE HEARD FROM WAS 

09:36:08.947 --> 09:36:14.978
HOUSE MEMBER FROM COLORADO THE 
YOUNGEST IMPEACHMENT MANAGER

09:36:19.297 --> 09:36:21.446
NEGUSE. HE WAS UTILIZED 
YESTERDAY AS WELL. AND A LOT OF 

09:36:22.091 --> 09:36:25.846
PEOPLE  PROBABLY SAW AND HEARD 
FROM HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND

09:36:26.061 --> 09:36:30.477
THAT SHOWS THAT SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS FOR THE WHOLE NATION'S 

09:36:30.881 --> 09:36:32.881
WATCHING, THIS COULD ELEVATE THE
CAREERS OF MANY HOUSE MEMBERS 

09:36:33.059 --> 09:36:37.780
WHO WANT TO BE LEADERS MONDAY. 
WE ALSO HEARD FROM MADELEINE 

09:36:37.999 --> 09:36:39.999
DEAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA. SHE MADE
MENTION AND I

09:36:44.895 --> 09:36:47.378
PREVIEW DO THIS YESTERDAY. SHE'S
A LAWYER BY TRADE BUT HAS SPENT 

09:36:47.593 --> 09:36:49.765
A LOT OF HER CAREER AS AN 
ENGLISH PROFESSOR. SHE TALKED 

09:36:49.978 --> 09:36:55.337
ABOUT HOW THAT MAY INFORM HER 
MORE BECAUSE SHE CAN SHOW YOU 

09:36:55.548 --> 09:36:57.548
HOW WORDS MATTER

09:37:01.749 --> 09:37:03.487
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHE WAS TASKED WITH GIVING A 

09:37:03.488 --> 09:37:05.574
DISSECTION OF TRUMPS WORDS AND 
HOW THEY CHEERED IT

09:37:09.478 --> 09:37:11.667
CERTAIN POINTS. AND SHE WAS 
BREAKING DOWN HOW THOSE LED TO 

09:37:11.883 --> 09:37:16.205
THE LATER EVENTS. WE HAVE HEARD 
FROM ALL OF THEM. THERE ARE A 

09:37:16.414 --> 09:37:18.414
FEW OTHERS THAT WE DID NOT HEAR 
FROM.

09:37:24.856 --> 09:37:26.856
DIANA

09:37:31.408 --> 09:37:38.289
DEGETTE WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS  
ATTORNEY PRIOR. THAT IS THE ROLE

09:37:40.754 --> 09:37:45.221
THAT THEY IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
PLAY. THEY ARE THE PROSECUTION 

09:37:45.622 --> 09:37:47.933
TEAM AND WE WILL HEAR FROM 
TRUMPS DEFENSE TEAM LATER THIS 

09:37:48.147 --> 09:37:53.874
WEEK. BUT LET'S PLAY A CLIP FROM
CONGRESSMAN DEAN. THIS WAS PART 

09:37:54.102 --> 09:37:59.039
OF HER ARGUMENT THAT REALLY GOT 
PERSONAL. IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL 

09:37:59.253 --> 09:38:04.425
REMINDER TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE

09:38:04.652 --> 09:38:09.138
AT THE CAPITAL ON THAT DAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SOMEBODY SHOUTED OUT:, LIE 

09:38:09.357 --> 09:38:16.941
DOWN, READY YOUR GAS MASK. 
SHORTLY AFTER THERE WAS 

09:38:17.871 --> 09:38:22.857
TERRIFYING BANGING ON THE 
CHAMBER DOORS. AND I WILL NEVER 

09:38:23.074 --> 09:38:28.434
FORGET THAT SOUND. SHOUTS AND 
PANICKED CALLS TO MY HUSBAND AND

09:38:28.659 --> 09:38:33.525
SONS. INSTRUCTIONS TO FLEE AND 
THE CONSTANT WORRY THAT THE

09:38:38.234 --> 09:38:40.616
GAS MASK WOULD FILTER THE AIR. 
THE CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES

09:38:40.832 --> 09:38:44.956
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TURNED 
TO CHAOS. FOR DONALD TRUMP IT 

09:38:45.170 --> 09:38:49.508
WAS A DIFFERENT DAY.! WHAT A 
TRANSITION TO GO FROM HER 

09:38:49.722 --> 09:38:51.982
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS GOING THROUGH THAT

09:38:52.199 --> 09:38:56.616
DAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT HIS RIGHT. AND THAT'S 

09:38:56.832 --> 09:38:59.009
SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN IN THE 
LAST FEW DAYS. THE IMPEACHMENT 

09:38:59.230 --> 09:39:03.473
MANAGERS ARE NOT SHYING AWAY 
FROM HOW EMOTIONAL THEY FELT 

09:39:04.189 --> 09:39:06.651
THAT DAY THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
THEIR OWN

09:39:11.963 --> 09:39:14.285
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND WHAT 
STOOD OUT TO THEM AND WHAT THEY 

09:39:14.501 --> 09:39:16.928
WENT THROUGH. WE HAVE SEEN SOME 
EMOTION FROM ALL OF THEM. AND 

09:39:17.155 --> 09:39:19.155
THAT UNDERSCORES THE POINT THAT 
THEY ARE HUMAN

09:39:21.912 --> 09:39:23.912
. IT SHOULD NOT BE 
UNDERESTIMATED HOW TRAUMATIC THE

09:39:24.006 --> 09:39:26.006
DAY IS FOR MANY PEOPLE ON THE 
HILL

09:39:31.864 --> 09:39:33.864
. IT MAY FEEL A LITTLE BIT 
DISTANT,

09:39:38.362 --> 09:39:41.241
MAYBE A MONTH BUT IS NOT A LONG 
TIME. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAME 

09:39:41.764 --> 09:39:43.764
RIGHT BACK

09:39:45.477 --> 09:39:47.477
TO THE FLOOR TO CONTINUE THE 
BUSINESS THAT THEY WERE 

09:39:47.665 --> 09:39:51.361
THEREFORE TO CERTIFY THE 
ELECTORIAL COLLEGE VOTES. THEY 

09:39:51.775 --> 09:39:54.366
WENT RIGHT BACK TO WORK AND THEY
BEEN COMING BACK EACH WEEK GOING

09:39:54.576 --> 09:39:56.576
THROUGH ADDITIONAL SECURITY 
MEASURES ON THE HILL. THERE ARE 

09:39:56.641 --> 09:40:00.806
STILL BROKEN WINDOWS, YOU CAN 
SEE THE REPAIR THAT HAS HAPPENED

09:40:01.025 --> 09:40:03.025
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

09:40:07.616 --> 09:40:09.816
THESE ARE THE PHYSICAL REMINDERS
THAT EACH MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND

09:40:10.033 --> 09:40:12.033
THE PEOPLE WHO INHABIT THE 
BUILDINGS HAVE TO CONFRONT THESE

09:40:12.211 --> 09:40:15.379
A DAILY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE 
STILL WORKING THROUGH THE TRAUMA

09:40:15.606 --> 09:40:20.226
OF THAT DAY. LEASE ON THE HOUSE 
SIDE WE HAVE SEEN THE SPEAKER OF

09:40:20.439 --> 09:40:23.407
THE HOUSE OFFER COUNSELING 
RESOURCES.

09:40:30.364 --> 09:40:31.874
SHE'S ALSO ASKING 
REPRESENTATIVES TO SCHEDULE TIME

09:40:31.875 --> 09:40:34.761
OR THEY CAN HAVE A ONE ON TIME 
WITH THE CAMERA AND TALK THROUGH

09:40:34.983 --> 09:40:39.005
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6th.  SHE 
SAID THAT AS PART OF HISTORY BUT

09:40:39.218 --> 09:40:41.724
SHE WANTED TO BE PART OF THEIR 
HEALING. THEY ARE DOING THAT 

09:40:41.936 --> 09:40:44.953
WHILE WORKING ON AN IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL. THE THE A

09:40:51.283 --> 09:40:55.958
OTHER BIG ITEMS INCLUDING THE 
COVID-19 PACKAGE. HOPING TO 

09:40:56.359 --> 09:40:58.793
BRING THAT TO THE FLOOR AS SOON 
AS THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WRAPS 

09:40:59.008 --> 09:41:01.939
UP. BUT RHONDA ONE OF THE PEOPLE
WHO DELIVERED A POWERFUL 

09:41:02.592 --> 09:41:10.532
ARGUMENT WAS DELEGATE PLASKETT. 

09:41:23.378 --> 09:41:28.708
PEOPLE WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF 
WASHINGTON, D.C. KNOW THIS 

09:41:28.921 --> 09:41:30.862
EXPERIENCE WELL. PEOPLE THAT 
HAVE THAT REPRESENTATION THAT IS

09:41:30.863 --> 09:41:36.990
NOT EQUAL. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
POWERFUL ROLE THAT SHE IS IN 

09:41:37.392 --> 09:41:40.251
DESPITE HER STATUS AS A DELEGATE
? 

09:41:40.252 --> 09:41:42.252
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHE IS A

09:41:45.107 --> 09:41:46.886
PROSECUTOR SHE HAS THAT 
BACKGROUND THAT IS SOMETHING 

09:41:46.887 --> 09:41:52.304
THAT SHE TOLD HOUSE SPEAKER 
NANCY PELOSI. SHE WROTE A LETTER

09:41:52.526 --> 09:41:55.015
SAYING THAT SHE WANTED TO BE 
CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE 

09:41:55.364 --> 09:41:57.652
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS BECAUSE SHE
HAD THE BACKGROUND AS A 

09:41:58.267 --> 09:42:00.906
PROSECUTOR. AND POINTED OUT THAT
BLACK WOMEN NEEDED TO BE PART OF

09:42:01.516 --> 09:42:03.516
THE PROCEEDINGS

09:42:07.255 --> 09:42:10.110
IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY. GIVEN THAT
THEY VOTE AT HIGH LEVELS AND ARE

09:42:10.326 --> 09:42:12.671
ENGAGED POLITICALLY. SHE WANTED 
THAT TO BE SHOWCASED. AND IN THE

09:42:12.887 --> 09:42:16.352
END HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI 
DID NOT GO WITH HER. BUT I 

09:42:16.935 --> 09:42:18.935
BELIEVE THAT

09:42:26.748 --> 09:42:29.071
THIS LED TO HER BEING UTILIZE 
THIS TIME AROUND. SHE ALSO 

09:42:29.283 --> 09:42:31.275
WORKED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE DURING THE BUSH 

09:42:31.276 --> 09:42:33.039
ADMINISTRATION AND WAS A 
REPUBLICAN BEFORE SHE TURNED 

09:42:33.040 --> 09:42:37.558
DEMOCRAT IN 2008. SHE HAS A LOT 
OF LEGAL EXPERIENCE. WE HEARD 

09:42:37.893 --> 09:42:40.555
HER TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WAS A 
STAFFER ON THE HILL DURING THE 

09:42:40.764 --> 09:42:45.372
9/11 AND HOW THAT IMPACTED HER. 
SHE'S HAD A BIT OF A HISTORY ON 

09:42:45.999 --> 09:42:48.562
THE HILL EVEN THOUGH SHE IS IN 
AT LARGE

09:42:52.754 --> 09:42:54.930
MEMBER FROM THE VIRGIN ISLANDS 
THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME 

09:42:55.155 --> 09:43:00.487
VOTING RIGHTS AS THE OTHER 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. SHE IS 

09:43:00.700 --> 09:43:02.850
BECOMING A NAME THAT PEOPLE ARE 
FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE SHE HAS 

09:43:03.064 --> 09:43:08.416
BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF TIME TO BE 
PART OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE 

09:43:08.634 --> 09:43:10.730
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE MAKING.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT SHE WAS 

09:43:10.943 --> 09:43:13.122
NOT ABLE TO VOTE TO IMPEACH 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BUT NOW 

09:43:13.351 --> 09:43:15.496
SHE'S PART OF THE TEAM IN MAKING
ARGUMENTS. GIVEN SUCH AN 

09:43:15.716 --> 09:43:18.090
IMPORTANT ROLE TODAY IN THIS 
PROCESS BY HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

09:43:18.310 --> 09:43:20.310
MANAGERS.

09:43:22.613 --> 09:43:24.613
ONE THING TO REMARK ON EVEN 
THOUGH WE'VE HEARD EMOTIONAL 

09:43:24.808 --> 09:43:28.713
MOMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
AS THEY DESCRIBED THEIR PERSONAL

09:43:28.935 --> 09:43:30.935
EXPERIENCE. THEY HAVE KEPT THE 
TONES SO MODERATED

09:43:36.830 --> 09:43:39.103
. AND THEY'VE KEPT THEIR REMARKS
ASSISTING. THEY'VE RELIED ON THE

09:43:39.321 --> 09:43:41.321
FOOTAGE AND AUDIO AND THE SOCIAL
MEDIA CLIPS

09:43:44.960 --> 09:43:47.150
TO KICK UP THAT EMOTIONAL LEVEL.
RATHER THAN YELLING.

09:43:52.670 --> 09:43:55.309
MIKE LEE WAS THE MOST EMOTIONAL 
PERSON WE SAW ON THE FLOOR OF 

09:43:55.519 --> 09:43:58.975
THE SENATE. AND HE WAS EVEN 
TALKING ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON 

09:43:59.381 --> 09:44:01.381
CAPITOL POLICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT THAT'S SUCH A SMART  

09:44:01.561 --> 09:44:03.561
OBSERVATION.

09:44:05.680 --> 09:44:10.959
IF MIKE LEE HAD BEEN NEARLY AS 
WORKED UP AS A MITT ROMNEY, THE 

09:44:11.177 --> 09:44:17.220
HOUSE HAS A REPRESENTATION FOR 
BEING FIRED UP. AND

09:44:24.360 --> 09:44:26.721
RASKIN IS KNOWN TO GIVE LOUD 
SPEECHES GOING BACK TO HIS DAYS 

09:44:26.935 --> 09:44:28.935
IN THE MARYLAND STATE 
LEGISLATURE. 

09:44:35.528 --> 09:44:37.700
THEY LET THE AUDIO VISUALS SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES. I'M GLAD WE'RE 

09:44:37.912 --> 09:44:41.261
TALKING ABOUT THIS DELEGATE. SHE
SAID THAT JANUARY 6th REMINDED 

09:44:41.479 --> 09:44:43.479
HER OF THE SEPTEMBER  11.

09:44:48.535 --> 09:44:52.935
YOU GOT THAT FEELING FROM THE 
AUDIO AND VIDEO.

09:44:58.480 --> 09:45:00.472
LISTENING TO THE RADIO 
TRANSMISSIONS WITH THE 

09:45:00.473 --> 09:45:05.028
FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS
GOING INTO TWIN TOWERS. AND 

09:45:05.733 --> 09:45:12.700
FIRST RESPONDERS SAYING 1013. 
WHICH IS WHAT WE HEARD FROM A 

09:45:13.117 --> 09:45:15.511
LOCAL WASHINGTON, D.C. POLICE 
OFFICER WHO WENT TO THE CAPITAL.

09:45:16.966 --> 09:45:20.629
AND THEIR FLANK WAS BREACHED. 
AND HE WAS RADIOING AND CALLING 

09:45:21.386 --> 09:45:28.791
FOR BACKUP. SAYING THAT OFFICERS
WERE UNDER DURESS. AND NOTHING 

09:45:29.002 --> 09:45:32.768
THAT THE HOUSE MANAGER COULD SAY
WOULD EQUATE WITH THE

09:45:37.479 --> 09:45:40.175
VISCERAL FEELING OF THAT OFFICER
AND THE FEAR IN HIS VOICE AS HE 

09:45:40.390 --> 09:45:42.390
WAS BEING ATTACKED

09:45:46.374 --> 09:45:51.845
. THERE WAS NO SOUND, 
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS DO NOT HAVE

09:45:52.072 --> 09:45:58.963
AUDIO. IT WAS QUIET, AND IT WAS 
SURREAL WATCHING THAT WINDOW 

09:45:59.185 --> 09:46:01.185
GLASS

09:46:04.500 --> 09:46:06.711
BEING BROKEN. THERE WAS NO SOUND
AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE 

09:46:06.925 --> 09:46:09.087
CLIMBING THROUGH THE GLASS. AND 
PEOPLE OPENING THE DOOR. AND THE

09:46:09.299 --> 09:46:14.406
MANAGERS JUXTAPOSE THE VIDEOS 
WITH THE LOUD NOISY VIDEOS OF 

09:46:14.733 --> 09:46:17.812
PEOPLE SCREAMING PROFANITY AND 
TALKING ABOUT KILLING HOUSE 

09:46:18.025 --> 09:46:23.996
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI. THAT MADE 
THE NOISE IN US ALL THE MORE 

09:46:24.410 --> 09:46:31.057
HAUNTING AND JARRING. SO THAT 
OFFICERS DID HAVE BODYCAMS AND 

09:46:31.271 --> 09:46:38.173
RADIOS AND WERE PLEADING FOR 
HELP IT WAS SO STARK. MORE SO 

09:46:38.389 --> 09:46:42.079
THAN WHAT ANYONE COULD'VE SAID 
IN A SPEECH. 

09:46:42.080 --> 09:46:48.594

LONG DAY. AND WE WILL BE BACK TO
