00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.700
I never wanted to ruin any one's life. 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.340
 It was just such an eerie feeling.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.510
I'm just too scared.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.910
She said, I know who my biological parents are.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.740
I can feel my body sinking now just talking about it,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.640
I was just like, 'whoo'.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.530
You and me have the same Dad, don't we? 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.070
Oh my gosh.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.240
She's like, yeah.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.990
That's definitely her.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.860
Yeah, I'm your sister. 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.770
How on earth could my sister move next door to me?

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.030
Holy crap.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.650
My name is Hillary Harris. I was adopted when I was an infant.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.190
My parents were very loving and very nice.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.050
I grew up in Elmwood, Wisconsin.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.000
I came to Eau Claire in 2005 for college.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.100
I met my husband in 2008. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.280
We bought this house, here in Eau Clair, in October of 2011.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.410
Then I found out I was pregnant.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.860
That's when I went through the adoption agency and found out

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.950
all my information about where I came from, birth mom, birth dad,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.930
I found out then that I had other siblings, but I could not find the half sister.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.370
Her name was Don Johnson.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.940
When we looked at the house, honestly we didn't even realise that it had a shared driveway.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.010
The house that we shared the driveway with

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.590
it was actually a rental house. Like every year there was new neighbours. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.240
And we had actually contemplated moving.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.120
So in 2017, the new neighbour moves in.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.480
And I don't know I didn't even introduce myself.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.210
I remember that. I'll was just like 'uh, whatever.'

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.590
My name is Dawn Johnson.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.480
I was raised in Wisconsin in a small town.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.660
My parents were not married.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.500
I did not know who my biological father was until I was 18.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.330
When we moved to Eau Clair we did look at probably 20+ houses.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.390
The house that I finally found was on Craigslist. 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.560
I actually pulled up and the first thing I noticed was a shared driveway.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.090
First thing that came to me is who's going to take care of the snow.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.630
After I moved into the house, I did come to find a little girl was coming next door. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.890
Her name is Stella.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.320
I did not like when Stella kept going over there.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.720
So I mean, I would definitely like watch through the window 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.710
if she'd like walk over there.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.770
My husband came over and was like 'I met the new neighbours.'

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.110
I was like, 'oh cool. What's her name?' 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.200
- 'Dawn.'

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.650
What are the chances it's not possible.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.980
I was at home one day and a big truck pulled in our driveway

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900
with huge stacks of shingles on it.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.010
And there was a big red banner, like wrapped around the shingles.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.120
And it said:

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.070
Johnson

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.920
I'm like, 'oh my God.'

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.210
I was stressing myself out about it.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.430
And my husband was getting stressed out. 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.410
He's like, 'if you don't ask her, I'm gonna ask her.'

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.990
Stella's mom and father came over.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.480
And I remember like looking at her hands.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.300
Oh, she's really big hands, too. And she has curly hair.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.490
And I have naturally wavy hair.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.600
I had a set of eyes on me that I could feel

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.070
going up and down my body.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.250
I was still too nervous at that point.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.080
I'm thinking 'huh!'

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.300
And then they decided, 'well, we're not going to get back to the roof

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.020
so we're going to leave.' 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.230
We sit by and walked inside and my husband's like,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.490
'Dude, what the heck? You didn't ask her?'

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.040
Well I'm like 'I couldn't couldn't! I'm just too scared!'

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.920
I never wanted to ruin anyone's life, you know, 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.150
or like be a surprise where they didn't want anything to do with me.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.770
And now there's this woman moving next door to me... 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.470
I can make her really sad or I ruined some family secret.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.230
So I pull up my father's obituary and see that it says Dawn Johnson

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.820
The phone lights up and it says: 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.720
'Hi, this is you know, Hillary your next-door neighbour.' 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.820
'Is your last name Johnson?'

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.440
Were you Miss Little Corn Fest Queen?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.860
I said 'yes, I was Miss Little Corn Fest in 1983.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.230
And she goes 'well, who's your dad?'

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.570
I said Wayne Close but unfortunately he passed away in 2010.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.720
And it was like silent for a couple minutes.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.630
Oh my gosh, it's her. It's Dawn Johnson.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.330
I said 'you and me have the same Dad, don't we?

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.610
And she's like, 'yeah, I'm your sister.'

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.710
I'm like, 'oh my gosh!'

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.430
I was just in shock. 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.250
Holy crap now what? Now what's our dynamic going to be like?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.230
And the next day I ended up bringing pictures of her biological father

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.340
because she has never met him and brought her flowers

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.940
and a card and said, 'you know, welcome sis, I'm glad to meet you.'

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.790
We talked a lot. We spent a lot of time together.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.220
We're very fortunate that we've had a very good have a really good connection together.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.550
I feel like Dawn's over here a lot.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.080
I mean, not like not like that, but I'll ask her for like, honestly,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.330
I've probably asked her for at least 10 rolls of toilet paper.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.480
A lot of life changes.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.720
A lot of firsts for both of us.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.240
I'm expecting another little girl in a couple months.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.020
I kind of felt like Dawn's there now as a neighbour

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.400
and a sister and a grandma.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.680
We see each other every day.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.060
We see each other every day.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.580
She comes home from work and I'll go out there and talk to her.

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:09.179
People really don't know each other and anymore,

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:11.489
they just are too busy with each other's lives

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:13.829
and they never really do get to know your neighbours.

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:16.859
So be kind to your neighbour because you never know

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:18.810
it could be your sister you've been looking for.
