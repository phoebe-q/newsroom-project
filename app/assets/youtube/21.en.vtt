00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.549
the cabinet has just had a long detailed
and impassioned debate on the draft

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.599
withdrawal agreement and the outline
political declaration on our future

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.830
relationship with the European Union
these documents were the result of

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
thousands of hours of hard negotiation
by UK officials and many many meetings

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.300
which I and other ministers held with
our EU counterparts I firmly believe

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
that the draft withdrawal agreement was
the best that could be negotiated and it

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.930
was for the cabinet to decide whether to
move on in the talks the choices before

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
us were difficult particularly in
relation to the Northern Ireland

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.899
backstop but the collective decision of
cabinet was that the government should

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.210
agree the draft withdrawal agreement and
the outline political declaration this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.760
is a decisive step which enables us to
move on and finalize the deal in the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.460
days ahead
 these decisions were not taken lightly but I believe

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.710
it is a decision that is firmly in the national
interest when you strip away the detail

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.960
the choice before us is clear this deal
which delivers on the vote of the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.200
referendum which brings back control of
our money, laws, and borders, ends free

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.270
movement, protects jobs security and our
union or leave with No Deal only or no

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.340
brexit at all, I know that there will be
difficult days ahead this is a decision

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.360
which will come under intense scrutiny
and that is entirely as it should be and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.390
entirely understandable but the choice
was this deal which enables us to take

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.460
back control and to build a brighter
future for our country or going back to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.020
square one with more division more
uncertainty and a failure to deliver on

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.939
the referendum it's my job as Prime
Minister to explain the decisions that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.439
the government has taken and I stand
ready to do that beginning tomorrow with

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.729
a statement in Parliament but if I may
end by just saying this I believe that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.870
what I owe to this country is to take
decisions that are in the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.170
National interest and I firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.090
decision which is in the best interests
of our entire united kingdom

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.180
