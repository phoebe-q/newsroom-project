00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:45.018
decide. He decided to cheat in 
the upcoming election. And he 

00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:47.767
got caught.

00:44:50.453 --> 00:44:52.329
That was an example from the 
congressman about Heidi was 

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.330
taking the personal and 
political

00:45:08.455 --> 00:45:10.143
and also referencing President 
Trump. Who is there audience 

00:45:10.144 --> 00:45:11.641
right now? 
&gt;&gt; I think they are thinking 

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.331
about their constituent. Some of
them are thinking about 

00:45:13.332 --> 00:45:15.577
reelection and that is not to 
say that what they said was not 

00:45:15.767 --> 00:45:18.205
sincere but we see on both sides
there is a PR element to this. 

00:45:18.394 --> 00:45:20.646
The Republicans are angry but 
they amp up the anger a bit for 

00:45:20.836 --> 00:45:22.715
the cameras. The Democrats are 
sincere but they want to 

00:45:22.716 --> 00:45:24.716
demonstrate to the public how 
serious and solemn they are in 

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.770
undertaking this very dramatic 
and historic move.

00:45:38.645 --> 00:45:40.645
That has been a theme in the 
Democratic messaging ever since 

00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:42.579
the impeachment inquiry (we 
heard it from Nancy Pelosi on 

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.835
down, the idea that this is a 
solemn moment. This is not a 

00:45:45.016 --> 00:45:49.147
moment there celebrated, this is
not anything they wanted. I 

00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:51.014
think they have been very 
concerned about being credible 

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:53.640
messengers for this 
accountability not looking as if

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.830
it is a partisan exercise.

00:45:59.453 --> 00:46:01.521
Will become in your Roundup last
night because you are working on

00:46:01.705 --> 00:46:03.390
this like the live update 
covering this initial markup 

00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.391
hearing last night. You had this

00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:10.893
great line that you wrote 
Democrats in repentance portray 

00:46:10.894 --> 00:46:15.957
the vote as a moment in history 
and they are to be on the right 

00:46:16.148 --> 00:46:18.148
side of it. We did

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.704
hear Democrats saying I was by 
her Republican colleagues could 

00:46:28.705 --> 00:46:30.771
be on the right side of it. But 
Republicans have the same 

00:46:30.963 --> 00:46:33.157
refrain. Repugnance tried to 
cast the vote today as loyalty

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.576
to the Constitution and our 
founding fathers. The case they 

00:46:39.577 --> 00:46:41.835
made was the impeachment was put
in place not to be a single 

00:46:42.023 --> 00:46:43.894
party decision but it was 
supposed to be something that 

00:46:43.895 --> 00:46:45.769
you collectively decided. There 
was fear among the founders that

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.770
if you did do a single

00:47:01.522 --> 00:47:03.019
party impeachment the country 
would be terribly divided 

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.520
&gt;&gt; the Republicans are 
encouraging Democrats to vote 

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:06.206
their conscience and vote 
against impeachment each one was

00:47:06.207 --> 00:47:07.892
appealing to the other to do 
right by history. 

00:47:07.893 --> 00:47:09.584
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about the 
Republican arguments last night.

00:47:09.585 --> 00:47:12.015
It was largely on process and 
then outrage at the fact

00:47:19.892 --> 00:47:21.892
that, in their view, Democrats 
have been trying to impeach the 

00:47:21.961 --> 00:47:23.961
president for years now. Not 
just for the last couple of 

00:47:24.019 --> 00:47:26.019
months. You heard over and over 
again Rebecca been saying and 

00:47:26.085 --> 00:47:28.085
they do has of Democrats they 
can point to specifically you 

00:47:28.142 --> 00:47:30.209
have been trying to impeach the 
president since the day he was 

00:47:30.397 --> 00:47:31.897
elected. You hear many 
arguments, though on the 

00:47:31.898 --> 00:47:34.535
substance of the charges. 
&gt;&gt; You did not. Most of it was 

00:47:34.663 --> 00:47:38.833
process and the fact that this 
was a witch hunt as the 

00:47:39.021 --> 00:47:41.271
president would call it, a sham,
hope, this was an attempt by the

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:43.327
Democrats to finally after three
years of trying, find something 

00:47:43.328 --> 00:47:46.342
to pin the president down on and
impeach him. You did not hear a 

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.530
lot of conversation about the 
phone call

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.922
with Volodymyr Zelensky or the 
withholding a military aid. With

00:47:58.923 --> 00:48:01.183
the military a question to come 
up the only point they did, was 

00:48:01.364 --> 00:48:03.577
the aid was eventually released 
and no harm was done.

00:48:09.634 --> 00:48:11.324
In terms of the president's 
behavior in the president's 

00:48:11.325 --> 00:48:13.387
actions you did not hear the 
Republicans defend that at all I

00:48:13.577 --> 00:48:14.516
think. 
&gt;&gt; I remember interviewing 

00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:16.517
Congressman Al Green three years
ago early 2017. Right after the 

00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:18.589
president was inaugurated really
calling for President Trump's 

00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:20.596
impeachment.

00:48:24.852 --> 00:48:26.921
So we saw quite quickly couple 
of members who were kind of 

00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:29.183
stepping out as to what Speaker 
Pelosi wanted them to be doing 

00:48:29.361 --> 00:48:31.361
and calling for impeachment very
early on.

00:48:38.379 --> 00:48:40.632
And that is what the Republicans
are pointing to now pico it has 

00:48:40.823 --> 00:48:42.883
been a huge part of Republican 
messaging to point out the idea 

00:48:43.072 --> 00:48:45.072
that so many Democrats wanted to
impeach Trump from the start. 

00:48:45.136 --> 00:48:47.767
Were so upset about his election
. Obviously, the election had 

00:48:47.957 --> 00:48:49.646
been interfered with by Russian,
there was fundamentally unfair 

00:48:49.647 --> 00:48:51.647
that Trump may have confided 
that interference.

00:48:55.661 --> 00:48:57.544
Democrats only some of them had 
extremely feelings about that 

00:48:57.545 --> 00:48:59.604
from the beginning. We knew it 
was a challenge for Nancy Pelosi

00:48:59.793 --> 00:49:01.793
to keep her members in line

00:49:08.622 --> 00:49:10.875
because she obviously did not 
want it to look like it was a 

00:49:11.064 --> 00:49:12.376
foregone conclusion. The 
Democrats were just hunting 

00:49:12.377 --> 00:49:14.257
around for the right excuse to 
begin an impeachment proceeding.

00:49:14.258 --> 00:49:18.013
We know that there was a lot of 
tension in the caucus about 

00:49:18.203 --> 00:49:20.083
this. Nancy Pelosi waited until 
this Ukraine's saga to begin 

00:49:20.084 --> 00:49:22.084
while members of her party were

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.160
making motions that there were a
number of actions Trump had 

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.056
taken that could have incited 
this in the past. I think it has

00:49:30.192 --> 00:49:32.192
been

00:49:41.122 --> 00:49:42.996
a difficult exercise in 
leadership for Pelosi. What I am

00:49:42.997 --> 00:49:45.068
very curious about is once we 
get to the house floor likely 

00:49:45.257 --> 00:49:46.949
next week, will we see the 
Democratic caucus remain 

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.199
unified. It does not sound like 
we will pit it sounds like there

00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:51.391
will be a handful of Democratic

00:49:54.649 --> 00:49:56.340
defections because we know that 
public opinion on impeachment 

00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:58.593
has really not moved that my 
&gt;&gt; That's such a great point and

00:49:58.783 --> 00:50:01.415
I want to dig more into that in 
a moment. It seems like at this 

00:50:01.595 --> 00:50:04.606
point the judiciary committee is
because we heard the Democratic 

00:50:04.978 --> 00:50:06.673
house is absolutely for voting 
for these articles of 

00:50:06.674 --> 00:50:08.732
impeachment, the repugnance 
absolutely against it.  

00:50:08.733 --> 00:50:12.808
&gt;&gt; For three years we have heard
from people

00:50:16.441 --> 00:50:19.073
that are now in the majority 
talk about the crimes of the 

00:50:19.202 --> 00:50:21.202
president.

00:50:27.902 --> 00:50:29.964
And where are they? Well they 
can sing Mr. President come in, 

00:50:30.155 --> 00:50:32.408
we will be fair with you, come 
tell us about the crimes. And 

00:50:32.598 --> 00:50:34.472
here's the crimes you have 
committed. And where are they 

00:50:34.473 --> 00:50:36.473
now that we have the articles of
impeachment?

00:50:44.432 --> 00:50:46.124
A vague abuse of power, 
obstruction of Congress. The 

00:50:46.125 --> 00:50:48.125
very thing is the majority has 
done. I would have expected 

00:50:48.766 --> 00:50:51.946
President Trump to just say you 
came after me, my business 

00:50:52.137 --> 00:50:54.137
Associates, my family now.

00:50:58.336 --> 00:51:00.396
I'm going back and I'm going to 
make billions of dollars, the 

00:51:00.586 --> 00:51:03.365
heck with you guys but he has 
hung in there. It is amazing.

00:51:08.476 --> 00:51:10.168
&gt;&gt; Democrats would certainly 
love it if President Trump 

00:51:10.169 --> 00:51:12.231
decided had enough of this. And 
it's not looking like that. The 

00:51:12.422 --> 00:51:14.422
president has been on the 
campaign

00:51:19.564 --> 00:51:21.441
essentially pushing back at this
impeachment process. I want to 

00:51:21.442 --> 00:51:23.509
dig into the articles themselves
a little bit because we will be 

00:51:23.699 --> 00:51:26.227
hearing a lot about them in very
specific detail this morning. 

00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:28.204
This hearing, this markup 
hearing is expected to get 

00:51:28.205 --> 00:51:30.086
underway in just about 10 
minutes time. Let's talk about 

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:32.525
unity and possible defections. 
&gt;&gt; Beaker

00:51:40.413 --> 00:51:42.413
Pelosi is very good at vote 
counting and very good at 

00:51:42.481 --> 00:51:44.481
pulling the caucus together. She
knows her rank. She is also 

00:51:44.544 --> 00:51:47.191
someone who is willing to allow 
members develop how they need to

00:51:47.335 --> 00:51:49.335
vote.

00:51:54.314 --> 00:51:56.314
Whether does to vote their 
conscience or whether it is to 

00:51:56.386 --> 00:51:57.507
keep their seats come reelection
time 

00:51:57.508 --> 00:51:59.508
&gt;&gt; that's right and Democratic 
leadership has said they are not

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.642
going to whip this vote. That 
means they are not going to 

00:52:01.831 --> 00:52:03.831
putting really tough pressure on
members to vote the party line. 

00:52:03.896 --> 00:52:06.496
Whether that is true behind the 
scenes, we are not quite sure.

00:52:11.222 --> 00:52:13.481
But Nancy Pelosi is dealing with
the caucus in the house that is 

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.733
made up of a huge range of 
members from different areas of 

00:52:15.922 --> 00:52:17.922
the country from districts, many
of which elected Trump. She is 

00:52:17.984 --> 00:52:22.872
dealing with these purple 
districts when district 

00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:25.474
Democrats who feel as if they 
were to vote for impeachment,

00:52:28.885 --> 00:52:30.757
their reelection would be in 
"Jeopardy" and then the house 

00:52:30.758 --> 00:52:32.827
majority for Democrats would be 
in "Jeopardy". It is kind of a 

00:52:33.017 --> 00:52:35.838
share political question in a 
certain way. And perhaps by 

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:38.019
easing up on some of those 
members

00:52:42.032 --> 00:52:43.344
, she does herself a favor 
politically. 

00:52:43.345 --> 00:52:45.759
&gt;&gt; Now she can have defections 
but only a certain number.

00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:08.681
I was going to say there is no 
way but we cannot predict 

00:53:08.874 --> 00:53:10.742
anything that is going to 
happen. Is very unlikely that 

00:53:10.743 --> 00:53:13.001
Speaker Pelosi would allow a 
vote to go to the floor she was 

00:53:13.181 --> 00:53:15.439
not 100% sure she had the votes 
to pass something as grave as 

00:53:15.628 --> 00:53:17.628
this assets significant as the 
&gt;&gt; The chances that this passes 

00:53:17.688 --> 00:53:20.127
the for next week is almost at 
100%, let's put it at 99%. To 

00:53:20.316 --> 00:53:22.002
Alisa's point about the 
Democratic caucus. You had a 

00:53:22.003 --> 00:53:24.003
number of progressives win in 
2018. Like AOC, like Ilhan Omar 

00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:26.071
on the platform of defeating 
President Trump. You had a 

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.772
number of Democrats win in these
purple district on jobs, 

00:53:28.913 --> 00:53:30.913
healthcare.

00:53:37.952 --> 00:53:39.952
So those voters were not 
interested in what Trump did and

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.471
who he talked to in Ukraine, 
they're worried about their own 

00:53:42.613 --> 00:53:44.613
pocketbooks.

00:54:01.407 --> 00:54:03.667
So in order for Nancy Pelosi to 
keep the majority, it is not 

00:54:03.848 --> 00:54:05.727
those progressives that she 
needs to worry about. They are 

00:54:05.728 --> 00:54:07.608
going to win reelection. It's as
moderate Democrats and that's 

00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:09.609
why Nancy Pelosi has been so 
reluctant to even bring up 

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:11.734
impeachment. That's why it is 
with a heavy heart I think she 

00:54:11.925 --> 00:54:13.605
is doing this because as 
Republicans have taunted her, 

00:54:13.606 --> 00:54:15.606
this could cost them the 
majority put we heard that last 

00:54:15.675 --> 00:54:17.361
night. We heard Republicans 
saying say goodbye to your 

00:54:17.362 --> 00:54:18.860
majority. 
&gt;&gt; Okay part of trying to keep 

00:54:18.861 --> 00:54:20.368
everyone happy especially the 
moderates is creating these 

00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:22.369
limited articles of impeachment.
There is some progressives and 

00:54:22.816 --> 00:54:26.558
activists outside and serving in
Congress would have loved to 

00:54:26.748 --> 00:54:28.617
have seen a laundry list of 
articles of impeachment listing 

00:54:28.618 --> 00:54:30.494
all kinds of things whether it 
is the emollients clause, 

00:54:30.495 --> 00:54:32.495
whether it is

00:54:36.876 --> 00:54:38.755
President Trump's treatment of 
women. You could have throw the 

00:54:38.756 --> 00:54:40.816
kitchen sink it here and made 
some people happy but that is 

00:54:41.006 --> 00:54:43.255
not the way the Democrats chose 
to go. Let's talk about what is 

00:54:43.445 --> 00:54:45.445
actually in these two articles 
of impeachment.  We have got 

00:54:45.514 --> 00:54:47.734
abuse of power which is a very 
broadly defined article

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:57.140
was so much that happened bid 
Trump in Ukraine, the 

00:54:57.141 --> 00:54:58.834
withholding of aid, the pressure
on Volodymyr Zelensky, the 

00:54:58.835 --> 00:55:00.708
withholding of a Whitehouse 
meeting for some time. This 

00:55:00.709 --> 00:55:03.318
whole idea of the alleged quid 
pro quo is in that article.

00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:09.908
In the second one we had is 
Trump's response to the inquiry 

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.090
itself. Obstruction of Congress.

00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:16.286
President Trump telling 
deputies, telling agencies not 

00:55:16.287 --> 00:55:18.337
to comply, not to handover 
documents, not to allowed

00:55:29.046 --> 00:55:30.736
officials to testify. These are 
two very clearly defined 

00:55:30.737 --> 00:55:32.737
articles that I think Democrats 
knew that if the American people

00:55:32.794 --> 00:55:34.485
are going to understand 
anything, it would probably be 

00:55:34.486 --> 00:55:37.491
those. We are not getting into a
lot of ancillary issues. 

00:55:37.492 --> 00:55:39.492
&gt;&gt; Colby does this out moderate 
Democrats go back to their 

00:55:39.552 --> 00:55:41.620
districts and say look, yeah, 
I'm going to vote for this, for 

00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:44.432
this very specific thing, this 
very specific set of actions, 

00:55:44.621 --> 00:55:46.621
the president is alleged to have
taken.

00:55:54.564 --> 00:55:56.626
You know, were going to move on 
from it after that 

00:55:56.627 --> 00:55:59.074
&gt;&gt; they are going to try to go 
out there like Ely said and 

00:55:59.252 --> 00:56:00.942
explain these articles because 
they are pretty simple in 

00:56:00.943 --> 00:56:02.943
nature. You can understand

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.140
the present makes a phone call, 
the present withhold aid, the 

00:56:09.202 --> 00:56:10.702
president asked for an 
investigation into Joe Biden. 

00:56:10.703 --> 00:56:12.773
That's not hard to wrap your 
head around. Like the mullah or 

00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:17.457
investigation was very 
complicated and trying to 

00:56:17.646 --> 00:56:19.522
impeach him on the Mueller 
report would've been a huge 

00:56:19.523 --> 00:56:21.209
challenge for Democrats. The 
reason why Nancy Pelosi wanted 

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:23.247
to hold dismal before the end of
the year

00:56:33.594 --> 00:56:35.662
was so they could get back to 
healthcare and all the things 

00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:37.910
that the moderate Democrats want
to run on next year picot of 

00:56:38.099 --> 00:56:39.979
course they're still working on 
Capitol Hill. December is often 

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.038
a really busy time on the hill. 
It's like everything that has 

00:56:42.228 --> 00:56:44.857
been in the works is do or die 
time and it's time to get it 

00:56:45.047 --> 00:56:47.297
passed or let it wither on the 
vine. So we are seeing our 

00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:49.487
college report on everything 
from like a new NAFTA trade deal

00:56:49.547 --> 00:56:51.612
on D at down. Who wins in a case
like that ?

00:56:51.613 --> 00:56:53.613
&gt;&gt; Right so what was interesting
is that Nancy Pelosi announce 

00:56:53.672 --> 00:56:55.672
the articles of impeachment and 
almost in the next breath  

00:56:55.743 --> 00:56:57.772
announced a negotiation with the
White House on trade.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.620
Which is a huge win for 
President Trump. He is been 

00:57:05.684 --> 00:57:08.325
fighting for trade in a new 
NAFTA since the beginning of his

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:13.191
presidency. So if he ends up 
getting that, that is going to 

00:57:13.382 --> 00:57:15.442
be another talking point for him
on the campaign trail next year.

00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:17.631
Certainly moderate Democrats

00:57:26.892 --> 00:57:28.761
or Democrats at large can 
campaign on that as well. 

00:57:28.762 --> 00:57:31.017
&gt;&gt; They can also say we are not 
hung up on impeachment right. 

00:57:31.208 --> 00:57:33.650
&gt;&gt; Yes of the whole argument of,
you know, we can walk into, at 

00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:36.085
the same time. We can do two 
things at the same type 

00:57:36.086 --> 00:57:38.344
&gt;&gt; I think that is a message 
they are hoping they can take 

00:57:38.525 --> 00:57:40.561
back to their districts. As the 
sun undergoes its

00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:55.972
trial I think Democratic 
leadership is hoping that these 

00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:57.973
members will be back at home 
focused on this kitchen table 

00:57:58.036 --> 00:57:59.907
issues, putting impeachment that
aside for now and doing what 

00:57:59.908 --> 00:58:01.221
they can to bolster their own 
reelection 

00:58:01.222 --> 00:58:03.100
&gt;&gt; Also space force one of 
President Trump's other goals 

00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:05.503
looks like it is going to happen
with attached to it

00:58:20.724 --> 00:58:22.411
parental leave for federal 
workers. Which is something that

00:58:22.412 --> 00:58:24.477
Democrats have been pushing for 
a long time. It is also a 

00:58:24.666 --> 00:58:26.355
priority of Ivanka Trump, the 
presidents daughter. She's going

00:58:26.356 --> 00:58:28.356
to take a lot of credit for 
parental leave for federal 

00:58:28.414 --> 00:58:29.164
workers 
&gt;&gt; 12 weeks. 

00:58:29.165 --> 00:58:30.479
&gt;&gt; Which is significant for 
federal workers. 

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.735
&gt;&gt; Also something Democrats can 
go home and say we are not just 

00:58:32.916 --> 00:58:34.983
hung up on impeachment, we are 
doing other things at the same 

00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:37.420
time. Okay so as we watch today 
we are expecting to see these 

00:58:37.611 --> 00:58:42.863
two articles of impeachment gone
over with a fine tooth comb  

00:58:43.238 --> 00:58:45.238
which is what happens in a 
markup. Ultimately, the goal of 

00:58:45.302 --> 00:58:47.740
Democrats at the end of the day 
is to vote on these two articles

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.428
and pass them out a committee, 
call me 

00:58:49.429 --> 00:58:51.867
&gt;&gt; right and that's what we will
see at the end of the day. 

00:58:52.048 --> 00:58:54.048
You'll see hours and hours of 
debate, hours of fighting, most 

00:58:54.116 --> 00:58:56.367
of the Republican side bit at 
the end of all this they are 

00:58:56.556 --> 00:59:00.302
going to debate, vote on article
1 and they will vote on article 

00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:02.929
2. They're going to get all the 
debate out of the way on the 

00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:05.558
front and and then do those two 
votes at the very very end of 

00:59:05.747 --> 00:59:08.197
this markup which could end up 
being in the early evening 

00:59:08.338 --> 00:59:10.338
likely.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.621
&gt;&gt; We know there a couple of 
constraints on the timing. Is 

00:59:19.809 --> 00:59:21.498
the White House Christmas party 
for certain lawmakers this 

00:59:21.499 --> 00:59:23.748
evening so they do not want to 
miss that. We know there's a 

00:59:23.937 --> 00:59:25.814
congressional delegation that is
going to be leaving for Europe 

00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:27.815
to commemorate and anniversary 
for the Battle of the Bulge of 

00:59:27.876 --> 00:59:30.097
all things. They do want to 
leave on time tonight.

00:59:38.944 --> 00:59:40.813
Similar to how this whole 
timeline has been compressed by 

00:59:40.814 --> 00:59:42.691
the Christmas holidays in the 
coming of the 2020 election, 

00:59:42.692 --> 00:59:44.753
tonight I think we are going to 
see lawmakers who are bit 

00:59:44.942 --> 00:59:46.942
exhausted ready to finish the 
business of the week and prepare

00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:48.690
for what is happening on the 
floor next week. 

00:59:48.691 --> 00:59:50.948
&gt;&gt; Chairman never has come into 
the room so we will bring you 

00:59:51.137 --> 00:59:55.449
live in on erupted. I want to 
thank you guys for being with us

00:59:55.639 --> 00:59:58.074
&gt;&gt; we will be back after break 
to break into what is going on, 

00:59:58.263 --> 01:00:00.713
explain the process and talk 
about the highlights of what is 

01:00:00.859 --> 01:00:02.859
happening.

01:00:18.703 --> 01:00:20.952
Once this gets out of the 
committee is to go to the house 

01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:23.210
floor and Democrats want to get 
this done before they leave for 

01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:25.460
the winter recess so we are 
looking at next week for house 

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:27.337
floor vote. That is another 
opportunity in the final 

01:00:27.338 --> 01:00:29.338
opportunity for Republicans to 
push back on this. Today is the 

01:00:29.394 --> 01:00:31.394
last chance for these judiciary 
members on the repugnant side of

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.526
the aisle to have their moment 
in the spotlight. To sort of 

01:00:33.707 --> 01:00:35.773
have less people the fight for 
airtime as opposed to when it 

01:00:35.964 --> 01:00:38.021
goes to the whole house floor. 
And give their consent and their

01:00:38.212 --> 01:00:39.337
dissatisfaction with how this 
has gone. 

01:00:39.338 --> 01:00:41.405
&gt;&gt; We have to remember that the 
house is such a different 

01:00:41.586 --> 01:00:43.586
chamber than the Senate but once
the process moves over even 

01:00:43.654 --> 01:00:45.865
though there is going to be 
quite a bit of

01:01:12.343 --> 01:01:14.343
conflict, it will be a more 
subdued process in certain ways.

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.410
There are Republicans that want 
to keep that trial as possible. 

01:01:16.478 --> 01:01:18.534
It might not be what the 
president wants but I think we 

01:01:18.724 --> 01:01:20.973
will see the Township very much 
when we moved to the other side 

01:01:21.162 --> 01:01:23.232
of the capital. This is the 
people's house and you heard it 

01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:25.668
all last night. I made you heard
the story of America, you're the

01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:27.917
story of legislatures and you 
heard a lot of hyperbole and a 

01:01:28.107 --> 01:01:30.351
lot of drama from both sides of 
the aisle. If you were turning 

01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:32.541
into that last night not having 
seen anything else you would 

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:34.601
really feel like democracy was 
on the line. Absolutely and you 

01:01:34.668 --> 01:01:36.668
would be confused. You know, you
hear both sides make these 

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:40.861
really compelling arguments and 
passionate arguments and without

01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:43.111
all the facts, who do you 
believe if you are the American 

01:01:43.293 --> 01:01:45.167
people question mark what is 
true? Did the President abuse 

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.616
power or was it just par for the
course? Was it just a present 

01:01:47.795 --> 01:01:49.294
chatting up a foreign leader 
about investigations and 

01:01:49.295 --> 01:01:50.981
corruption? That's what the 
Democrats need to convince the 

01:01:50.982 --> 01:01:53.429
American people of and they only
have a couple more days to do it

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.865
&gt;&gt; all right you can see there 
the members gathering. The way a

01:01:56.053 --> 01:01:58.113
markup works as they dig through
the process here. They will dig 

01:01:58.302 --> 01:02:03.178
through the substance of the 
bill and make technical changes 

01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:05.616
and tweaks to language for this 
is not the high drama that we 

01:02:05.804 --> 01:02:07.804
saw in the Intel committee where
witnesses are coming before the 

01:02:07.863 --> 01:02:09.369
committee and testifying and 
dropping bombshells. This is 

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.239
much more about these committee 
members hatching over things and

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.309
it is a chance for committee 
members to have their final say 

01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:15.491
before these articles get out of
this committee.

01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:36.375
It is their final chance to make
their case to the American 

01:02:36.564 --> 01:02:38.251
public, Elise. 
&gt;&gt; That's right and I think it's

01:02:38.252 --> 01:02:40.123
been difficult for Democrats on 
the judiciary committee to tell 

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:42.380
that unified story but it looks 
like we about to clear and it 

01:02:42.568 --> 01:02:44.625
will be interesting to see if 
they can do that better today. 

01:02:44.817 --> 01:02:46.884
&gt;&gt; Let's go to Chairman Nadler 
as he calls this markup hearing 

01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:49.641
to order.

01:03:03.566 --> 01:03:05.566
&gt;&gt; The Judiciary Committee well 
please come to order, corn being

01:03:05.632 --> 01:03:07.316

yesterday I had completed 

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.815
opening statements on the 
resolution about to be 

01:03:08.816 --> 01:03:10.836
considered. Notice under house 
resolution 660 I now call

president of the United States 

01:03:16.882 --> 01:03:18.882
for high crimes and misdemeanors
&gt;&gt;

01:03:24.758 --> 01:03:26.758
Mr. Chairman, point of order. I 
make a point order against 

01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:28.324
consideration on the grounds 
that the chairman willfully 

01:03:28.325 --> 01:03:30.013
refused to schedule a day of 
hearings 

01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:32.453
&gt;&gt; we will entertain that point 
of order once we have completed 

01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:35.086
calling up the resolution 
&gt;&gt; we now call up

01:03:47.636 --> 01:03:49.636

John Trump for high crimes and

misdemeanors. For purposes of 
markup and move that the 

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:52.702
committee reported the 
resolution favorably to the 

01:03:52.703 --> 01:03:54.011
house. The clerk will report the
resolution

crimes and misdemeanors and

submitted the following 

01:04:04.136 --> 01:04:06.136

executed Donald J Trump is abuse
the powers of the presidency and

01:05:16.529 --> 01:05:18.529
that using the powers of the 
high of's President Trump's is 

01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:20.464
elicited the interference of a 
foreign government, you great in

01:05:20.465 --> 01:05:22.501
the 2020 United States 
presidential election. He did so

01:05:30.214 --> 01:05:31.906
through scheme or course of 
conduct that included soliciting

01:05:31.907 --> 01:05:33.780
the government of Ukraine to 
publicly announce into the cases

01:05:33.781 --> 01:05:35.781
that would benefit his relax, 
harm the election prospect of a 

01:05:35.839 --> 01:05:37.155
political opponent, and 
influence the 2020 presidential 

01:05:37.156 --> 01:05:38.844
election to his advantage. 
President Trump also sought to 

01:05:38.845 --> 01:05:40.713
pressure the government of 
Ukraine to take the steps by 

01:05:40.714 --> 01:05:42.212
conditioning government accepts 
significant value to vacate of 

01:05:42.213 --> 01:05:43.721
its public announcement of the 
investigation. President Trump 

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:45.938
engaged in the chair 
&gt;&gt; chairman object 

01:05:45.939 --> 01:05:47.939
&gt;&gt;

01:06:08.099 --> 01:06:09.218
objection reserve 
&gt;&gt; personal political benefit. 

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:11.285
In doing so President Trump use 
the powers of the presidency in 

01:06:11.474 --> 01:06:13.341
a manner that compromised the 
necessary of the United States 

01:06:13.342 --> 01:06:15.031
and undermine the integrity of 
the United States Democratic 

01:06:15.032 --> 01:06:16.908
process. He does ignored and 
injured the interest of the 

01:06:16.909 --> 01:06:18.909
nation. President Trump engaged 
in a scheme or course of conduct

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.664
to the following means. One, 
President Trump acting both 

01:06:20.665 --> 01:06:22.532
directly and through his agent 
within and outside the United 

01:06:22.533 --> 01:06:24.037
States government solicited the 
government of Ukraine to 

01:06:24.038 --> 01:06:25.347
publicly announce investigations
into a, political opponent 

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.224
Former Vice President Joe Biden 
and become a disk credited 

01:06:27.225 --> 01:06:29.101
theory promoted by Russia a 
lashing that Ukraine rather than

01:06:29.102 --> 01:06:30.599
Russia interfered in the 2016 
United States presidential 

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.413
election. To, with the same 
corrupt motors President Trump 

01:06:33.784 --> 01:06:35.784
with his agents

01:06:50.103 --> 01:06:52.103
on the public announcements that
he had requested a, the release 

01:06:52.168 --> 01:06:54.168
of $391 million of United States
taxpayer funds that Congress had

01:06:54.228 --> 01:06:56.098
appropriated on a bipartisan 
basis for the purpose of writing

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.099
invite all military and security
assistance to Ukraine, depose 

01:06:58.365 --> 01:07:00.365
Russian aggression

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.667
and be ahead of state meeting at
the White House which present of

01:07:11.857 --> 01:07:13.354
the or Craig continue to 
demonstrate United States 

01:07:13.355 --> 01:07:15.355
support for the government of 
Ukraine in the state of Russian 

01:07:15.414 --> 01:07:16.919
aggression three the public 
revelation of his actions. 

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.920
President Trump ultimately 
released the military

01:07:30.605 --> 01:07:32.105
security assistance but his 
presence was openly and 

01:07:32.106 --> 01:07:33.420
corruptly soliciting Ukraine to 
undergo investigation for 

01:07:33.421 --> 01:07:34.730
political benefit 
&gt;&gt; this actions are consistent 

01:07:34.731 --> 01:07:36.236
with President Trump's previous 
invitations of interference in 

01:07:36.237 --> 01:07:38.105
United States election. I love 
this President Trump abuse the 

01:07:38.106 --> 01:07:39.983
powers of the business by injury
national security another vital 

01:07:39.984 --> 01:07:41.859
national interest to obtain and 
him proper personal benefit. He 

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.918
has also betrayed the nation by 
abusing his I asked her to 

01:07:44.107 --> 01:07:46.107
enlist a foreign power in 
corrupting Democratic

01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:51.418
elections 
&gt;&gt; he has demonstrated he will 

01:07:51.419 --> 01:07:53.295
remain a threat to national 
security and the Constitution if

01:07:53.296 --> 01:07:55.543
allowed to remain in office but 
he has acted in a manner grossly

01:07:55.733 --> 01:07:57.044
incompatible with 
self-governance and the role of 

01:07:57.045 --> 01:07:58.553
law. President Trump warns 
impeachment and trial, removed 

01:07:58.554 --> 01:08:00.554
from office and disqualification
to hold and enjoy any office of 

01:08:00.608 --> 01:08:02.608
honor under United States. 
Article 2 obstruction of 

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.643
Congress.

01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:09.549
The custody provides of the 
house of it because cell have 

01:08:09.615 --> 01:08:11.615
the sole power of impeachment 
and that the president shall be 

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:13.670
removed from the office

01:08:27.986 --> 01:08:29.484
on impeachment for the 
conviction of treason, bribery 

01:08:29.485 --> 01:08:31.359
or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors. In his conduct of 

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360
the office of the president of 
the United States and in 

01:08:33.435 --> 01:08:34.925
violation of his constant 
national to faithfully execute 

01:08:34.926 --> 01:08:36.991
the president of the United 
States and to the best of the 

01:08:37.171 --> 01:08:38.867
belly preserve, protect and 
defend the Constitution of the 

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.553
United States. In violation of 
his constitutional duties take 

01:08:40.554 --> 01:08:42.554
care the laws

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:03.615
he faithfully executed Donald J 
Trump has directed the 

01:09:03.616 --> 01:09:04.736
unprecedented and categorical 
and indiscriminate subpoenas 

01:09:04.737 --> 01:09:06.422
issued by the House of 
Representatives pursuant to its 

01:09:06.423 --> 01:09:08.303
sole power of impeachment. 
President Trump is a bruise the 

01:09:08.304 --> 01:09:10.304
powers of the presidency in a 
matter and subversive of the 

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.865
Constitution Avenue. The House 
of Representatives has engaged 

01:09:11.866 --> 01:09:13.365
in an impeachment inquiry 
focused on President Trump's 

01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:14.863
corrupts alliteration of the 
government of Ukraine, to 

01:09:14.864 --> 01:09:16.550
interfere in the 2020 United 
States presidential election. As

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.427
part of this impeachment inquiry
the committee is undertaking the

01:09:18.428 --> 01:09:19.927
investigation seeking documents 
and testimony deemed vital to 

01:09:19.928 --> 01:09:22.176
the inquiry by various executive
offices in current official to 

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:23.863
go President Trump directed 
executive branch officers and 

01:09:23.864 --> 01:09:25.553
officials not to comply with 
those subpoenas. President Trump

01:09:25.554 --> 01:09:27.431
does interpose the powers of the
presidency against the lawful 

01:09:27.432 --> 01:09:29.112
subpoenas of the House of 
Representatives and is himself 

01:09:29.113 --> 01:09:30.612
functions and judgments 
necessary to exercise the sole 

01:09:30.613 --> 01:09:32.613
power of the

01:09:36.995 --> 01:09:38.304
impeachment and House of 
Representatives. President Trump

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:40.305
abuse the power of his high 
office in the following means. 

01:09:40.371 --> 01:09:42.371
One, directing the White House 
to defy a lawful subpoena by 

01:09:42.431 --> 01:09:43.930
withholding the production of 
documents saw two, directing 

01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:45.805
other executive branches and 
offices to defy law foes the 

01:09:45.806 --> 01:09:48.069
thing is, and but for the 
production of documents and 

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:50.207
records

01:09:57.622 --> 01:09:59.498
from the committee and reports 
to which the Office of 

01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:00.808
Management and Budget, 
Department of Energy and 

01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:02.681
department of defense refused to
produce a single document of 

01:10:02.682 --> 01:10:03.617
record 
&gt;&gt; three, directing executive 

01:10:03.618 --> 01:10:05.881
committee not to cooperate with 
the committee nine defied name 

01:10:06.022 --> 01:10:12.245
he John Mulvaney Robert B Blair 
dyne a Eisenberg Michael Ellis, 

01:10:12.616 --> 01:10:14.616
pesty, Russell T Vann, Michael 
Duffy, Brian McCormick

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.997
. These actions were consistent 
with President Trump's previous 

01:10:27.998 --> 01:10:29.117
efforts to undermine United 
States government, 

01:10:29.118 --> 01:10:30.436
investigations into foreign 
interference in United States 

01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:32.437
election through these actions 
President Trump's sought to

01:10:36.998 --> 01:10:38.998
the right to determine the 
property, scope and nature of an

01:10:39.055 --> 01:10:40.929
impeachment inquiry into his own
conduct as well as the 

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.806
unilateral prerogative to deny 
any and all information to the 

01:10:42.807 --> 01:10:44.807
House of Representatives

01:11:10.368 --> 01:11:12.435
in exercise of its sole power of
impeachment. In the history of 

01:11:12.627 --> 01:11:14.501
the Republic and no president 
has ever ordered the complete 

01:11:14.502 --> 01:11:16.180
defiance of an impeachment 
inquiry or sought to obstruct 

01:11:16.181 --> 01:11:18.057
and impede so capacitively the 
ability of the House of 

01:11:18.058 --> 01:11:19.373
Representatives to investigate 
high crimes and misdemeanors. 

01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:21.061
This abuse of officers to 
cover-up the president's own 

01:11:21.062 --> 01:11:22.938
repeated Wisconsin and to seize 
control of the power of 

01:11:22.939 --> 01:11:24.436
impeachment. Thus to nullify a 
vital constitutional safeguard 

01:11:24.437 --> 01:11:26.437
vested solely in the House of 
Representatives. In all of this,

01:11:26.496 --> 01:11:28.564
President Trump has acted in a 
manner contrary to his trust as 

01:11:28.753 --> 01:11:29.872
president and subversive of 
constitutional government 

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:31.873
through the great cause of law 
and justice and to manifest 

01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:33.814
injury to the people of the 
United States. President Trump 

01:11:33.815 --> 01:11:35.873
by such conduct has demonstrated
that he will remain a threat to 

01:11:36.063 --> 01:11:38.063
the Constitution if allowed to 
remain in office and has acted 

01:11:38.123 --> 01:11:39.997
in a manner grossly incompatible
with self-governance of the role

01:11:39.998 --> 01:11:42.064
of law. President Trump the 
sworn impeachment trial and 

01:11:42.252 --> 01:11:43.750
removal from office and 
disqualification to hold and 

01:11:43.751 --> 01:11:45.751
enjoy the office of honor trust 
or profit under United States 

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:47.876
&gt;&gt; the gentleman will now stay 
his point of order up 

01:11:47.877 --> 01:11:49.877
&gt;&gt; thank you Mr. Chairman

01:11:55.933 --> 01:11:57.933
the chairman was furnished with 
the demand signed by all the 

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.307
Republican members of the 
committee during impeachment 

01:11:59.308 --> 01:12:01.308
hearing held on December 4th the
chairman has refused to respond 

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:03.061
to multiple additional requests 
that the hearing be scheduled 

01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:05.062
and at one point, actually 
telling me

01:12:11.495 --> 01:12:13.566
and I actually responded to 
this. That we will roll with it 

01:12:13.754 --> 01:12:16.370
today. We are here today and it 
is a farce that we are having a 

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.816
role on this today because there
is no other time we are actually

01:12:18.997 --> 01:12:21.251
taking up the articles today. 
The rule is and by the way this 

01:12:21.441 --> 01:12:23.441
rule is not superseded by any 
portion

01:12:28.002 --> 01:12:30.060
of 660 that could've been done 
by majority but they were too 

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.693
busy and in a hurry to get it 60
the floor that after discussing 

01:12:32.873 --> 01:12:34.873
this, they chose not to exempt 
the minority hearing date. This 

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.996
could've been done, they chose 
not to and now we're not having 

01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:39.046
it. I continue my point of 
order. 

01:12:39.047 --> 01:12:41.502
&gt;&gt; If I understand the 
gentleman's point of honor he 

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.941
asserts we are violating clause 
to Jay one of house role 11 by 

01:12:44.129 --> 01:12:46.129
conducting this markup before we
have held a hearing that the 

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:48.190
minority members requested on 
December 4th.

01:12:51.253 --> 01:12:53.124
In my view the gentleman is 
claiming a broader privilege 

01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:55.163
than clause to Jay one actually 
provides the minority.

01:13:07.186 --> 01:13:09.255
The minority has do hearings on 
the matter of the December 4th 

01:13:09.445 --> 01:13:10.753
hearing which was a 
constitutional grounds for 

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.624
impeachment. I'm willing to work
with the minority to schedule 

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:14.625
such a hearing but not before 
today's markup of the articles 

01:13:14.693 --> 01:13:16.693
of impeachment. The house rule 
does not require

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:32.130
me to schedule a hearing on a 
particular day, nor does it 

01:13:32.318 --> 01:13:34.318
require me to schedule a hearing
as a condition precedent for 

01:13:34.383 --> 01:13:35.879
taking any specific legislative 
action. Otherwise, the minority 

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.760
would have the ability to delay 
or block legislative action 

01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:39.815
which is clearly not the purpose
of the role. I reach this 

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:41.319
conclusion after reviewing the 
plaintext and legislative 

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.187
history of the house rule after 
considering prior precedent in 

01:13:43.188 --> 01:13:45.188
committee practice, after 
consulting with problem interior

01:13:47.694 --> 01:13:49.003
parties 
&gt;&gt; I believe my scheduling is 

01:13:49.004 --> 01:13:50.689
reasonable for several reasons. 
First the minority's views have 

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:52.376
not been shut out. The 
legislative history in the 

01:13:52.377 --> 01:13:54.783
morning or the day rule shows 
that it was Rittman to

01:13:59.881 --> 01:14:01.569
preventing the minority position
from being represented in the 

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.443
hearing. As a reporter for the 
joint committee and the 

01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:05.320
organization of Congress in 1966
explains, it is procedure for 

01:14:05.321 --> 01:14:07.321
representatives both sides

01:14:09.819 --> 01:14:11.317
to give testimony in committee 
hearings and when 

01:14:11.318 --> 01:14:13.318
representatives representing the
minority position are not a lot 

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.582
of time

01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:22.571
a statute exists to protect 
minority rights. Of course that 

01:14:22.572 --> 01:14:24.633
did not happen at the December 
4th hearing. The minority had a 

01:14:24.822 --> 01:14:26.822
witness at the hearing, 
Professor Turley

01:14:34.384 --> 01:14:36.073
which ably represented their 
position as was afforded ample 

01:14:36.074 --> 01:14:38.074
time to discuss that position. 
Rather than being shut out the 

01:14:38.131 --> 01:14:40.131
minority did not get as many 
witnesses as they would have 

01:14:40.198 --> 01:14:42.457
preferred that is not the 
purpose of the house rule. 

01:14:42.597 --> 01:14:44.597
Second,

01:14:48.632 --> 01:14:50.318
the minority and the president 
has special protections under 

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.818
House resolution 660. The 
procedures proceeded under House

01:14:51.819 --> 01:14:53.504
resolution 660 give the 
president and the minority a 

01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:55.582
variety of special privileges to
present evidence and subpoena 

01:14:55.736 --> 01:14:57.736
witnesses.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:06.821
There are alternative procedures
by which witnesses can be 

01:15:06.822 --> 01:15:08.694
requested and even subpoena but 
they have not been exercised. 

01:15:08.695 --> 01:15:10.758
Third, there is no president for
the use of minority delays for 

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:12.950
legislative or impeachment 
proceedings. It is clear

01:15:19.193 --> 01:15:21.193
that the minority day rule is 
not intended to lay legislative 

01:15:21.259 --> 01:15:22.756
activity. Again it's the 
committee and the organization 

01:15:22.757 --> 01:15:24.444
of Congress explicitly 
explained, we do not look upon 

01:15:24.445 --> 01:15:26.445
this rule as an authorization 
for delaying tactics. It is made

01:15:26.513 --> 01:15:28.763
part of the house rules in 1971 
but is not involved in either 

01:15:28.951 --> 01:15:30.951
the Nixon or

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:35.323
Clinton impeachment as a matter 
fact the only person I am aware 

01:15:35.512 --> 01:15:37.200
of in the conference of 
impeachment took place several 

01:15:37.201 --> 01:15:38.887
weeks ago in the intelligence 
committee. There the minority 

01:15:38.888 --> 01:15:41.089
also requested a day of hearings
even though they all

01:15:44.889 --> 01:15:46.755
sent witnesses to participate in
the proceedings for the minority

01:15:46.756 --> 01:15:48.825
ultimately did not raise a point
of order. While they did offer 

01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:51.590
an amendment

01:15:58.573 --> 01:16:00.573
that amendment was rejected by 
the committee. Thus there is No 

01:16:00.631 --> 01:16:02.136
precedent, and the president 
supporting the gentleman's point

01:16:02.137 --> 01:16:04.137
of order. The one precedent we 
have indicates that point of 

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:06.071
order does not lie to delay 
consideration of articles of 

01:16:06.072 --> 01:16:09.824
impeachment. Finally,  the 
judiciary committee practice and

01:16:10.013 --> 01:16:11.883
president do not support the 
gentleman's point of order. Last

01:16:11.884 --> 01:16:13.884
year other members and I sent

01:16:17.134 --> 01:16:18.821
the minority request. The 
chairman never responded to our 

01:16:18.822 --> 01:16:20.822
request and never scheduled a 
hearing. I do not believe a 

01:16:21.462 --> 01:16:24.823
single member of the majority 
argued in favor of us granting a

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:28.199
hearing under the rules. Back in
2005 then chairman go to the 

01:16:28.388 --> 01:16:30.388
minority day hearing but cut off
witnesses

01:16:51.824 --> 01:16:53.824
, shut off the microphone, shut 
off the lights and abruptly 

01:16:53.888 --> 01:16:55.575
ended the hearing while members 
were seeking recognition to 

01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:57.576
speak. Again no one in the 
majority argued in favor of 

01:16:57.634 --> 01:16:59.511
protecting our rights. As a 
result there is no committee 

01:16:59.512 --> 01:17:01.198
practice or president supporting
the gentleman's point of order. 

01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:03.446
&gt;&gt; For all those reasons I do 
not sustain the point of order. 

01:17:03.637 --> 01:17:05.133
&gt;&gt; Mr. Chairman .
&gt;&gt; what purpose does the 

01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:06.639
gentleman seek recognition? The 
gentleman's answer to my 

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.886
question has struck a nerve. In 
his own words it is not the 

01:17:09.074 --> 01:17:10.571
chairman's right to decide 
whether prior hearings are 

01:17:10.572 --> 01:17:12.640
sufficient are the chairman's 
right to violate the rules in 

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.126
order to interfere 
&gt;&gt; it is interesting to me that 

01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:17.270
this time has become the issue

01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:28.761
&gt;&gt; I made my ruling on the play 
of order. If the gentleman 

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:30.450
wishes to appeal this ruling, if
the gentleman 

01:17:30.451 --> 01:17:32.884
&gt;&gt; I would like for the sake of 
history for the chairman to take

01:17:33.075 --> 01:17:34.577
more -- 
&gt;&gt; does the gentleman wish to 

01:17:34.578 --> 01:17:37.384
appear the point yes or know ?
&gt;&gt; 

01:17:37.385 --> 01:17:38.704
&gt;&gt; The chairman is doing this 
again 

01:17:38.705 --> 01:17:40.734
&gt;&gt; the ruling of the chair is 
not sustain.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:51.636
&gt;&gt; I moved to table. 
&gt;&gt; Did you actually call for a 

01:17:51.824 --> 01:17:53.511
vote ? 
&gt;&gt; I did not sustain, you did 

01:17:53.512 --> 01:17:55.512
not call for a vote 
&gt;&gt; I sustained the point of 

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:59.324
order 
&gt;&gt; I call for a bill really the 

01:17:59.513 --> 01:18:01.955
chair, now it's time for a vote 
&gt;&gt; I moved that the point of 

01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:04.572
order is not well taken. 
&gt;&gt; That is painfully office. I 

01:18:04.762 --> 01:18:06.075
have appeal the ruling of the 
chair 

01:18:06.076 --> 01:18:08.108
&gt;&gt; I moved to table 
&gt;&gt; the gentleman has

01:18:13.575 --> 01:18:15.822
moved in the later has moved to 
Cabell, the motion to table is 

01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:18.448
not debatable all in favor the 
motion to table say I. Opposed 

01:18:19.197 --> 01:18:24.600

sustained 

01:18:24.601 --> 01:18:26.601
&gt;&gt;

01:18:33.264 --> 01:18:35.321
the gentleman asked for roll 
call on the motion to table. The

01:18:35.514 --> 01:18:37.576
appeal of the ruling of the 
chair the clerk will call the 

01:18:37.765 --> 01:18:40.026

17 noes.

01:20:29.514 --> 01:20:31.579
We will now proceed to MMS. The 
clerk will read the first 

01:20:31.769 --> 01:20:33.769
section of the resolution.

01:20:46.204 --> 01:20:47.893
Interest 755 impeaching Donald 
John Trump president of the 

01:20:47.894 --> 01:20:49.761
United States for high crimes 
and misdemeanors and House of 

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.457
Representatives December the 20 
19th is another cemented the 

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:53.326
following resolution which was 
referred to the committee on the

01:20:53.327 --> 01:20:55.207
Judiciary. Resolution impeaching
John on J Trump president of the

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:56.890
United States for high crayons 
and misdemeanors resolve that 

01:20:56.891 --> 01:20:59.145
Donald J Trump is not the United
States and the beach for high 

01:20:59.326 --> 01:21:00.830
crimes and misdemeanors in the 
following articles of 

01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:02.831
impeachment be exhibited to the 
state Senate. 

01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:09.827
Articles of impeachment about 
how servers is in the United 

01:21:09.828 --> 01:21:11.828
States American the name of 
itself and the people of the 

01:21:11.889 --> 01:21:13.889
United States of America against
Donald J Trump president of the 

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.953
night states of America and 
maintenance and support of its  

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.519
impeachment against him for high
crimes and misdemeanors 

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.387
&gt;&gt; I now recognize myself for 
purposes of offering an 

01:21:19.388 --> 01:21:21.388
amendment. The report

01:21:23.702 --> 01:21:25.582
the clerk will report the 
amendment go the amendment in 

01:21:25.583 --> 01:21:27.828
the name of the substitute for 
HR 7'5" offered by Mr. Noller of

01:21:28.018 --> 01:21:30.018
New York. All that follows after
the resulting clause and insert 

01:21:30.078 --> 01:21:32.330
the following 
&gt;&gt; with that enchantment the 

01:21:32.705 --> 01:21:35.343
amount will be considered as 
read without objection

01:21:40.768 --> 01:21:42.768
I will now recognize myself to 
explain the amendment in the 

01:21:42.834 --> 01:21:46.204
nature of the substitute this 
amendment makes a minor change. 

01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:48.079
In certain places where the 
underlying resolution refers to 

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.080
Donald J Trump the amendment

01:21:53.143 --> 01:21:55.143
refers to Donald John Trump 
otherwise it makes no changes to

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.456
the resolution and I urge all of
my colleagues to reap support up

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.646
and I now recognize the ranking

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:05.145
member Mr. Collins for any 
recommendation 

01:22:05.146 --> 01:22:07.146
&gt;&gt; the nature the substitute is 
absolutely irrelevant.

01:22:10.391 --> 01:22:12.391
Making Donald J Trump and making
Donald Trump. Don Trump just 

01:22:12.457 --> 01:22:14.457
simply shows the frankly

01:22:32.144 --> 01:22:34.391
absurdity of where we are apt to
&gt;&gt; today were going to spend 

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.639
plenty of time for you listing 
here. Were going to talk about 

01:22:36.829 --> 01:22:38.705
this amendment substitute, were 
going to talk about the factual 

01:22:38.706 --> 01:22:40.582
basis that have actually know 
factual basis to impeach the 

01:22:40.583 --> 01:22:42.829
president. I'm going to go back 
for just a minute since I did 

01:22:43.018 --> 01:22:45.083
not have time and had to sit 
through a well rehearsed many 

01:22:45.272 --> 01:22:47.272
days put together

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:52.765
an explanation of what will be 
known in 2019 outside of the 

01:22:52.957 --> 01:22:54.833
fact that this committee finally
accomplished its goal after the 

01:22:54.834 --> 01:22:56.705
chairman stated he wanted to 
since November of last year 

01:22:56.706 --> 01:22:58.585
impeach this president. What 
will be known by this committee 

01:22:58.586 --> 01:23:01.136
from here on out is that this 
committee has now founded 

01:23:01.389 --> 01:23:03.271
sounded the death of minority 
rights in this committee but 

01:23:03.272 --> 01:23:05.139
this committee has become 
nothing but a rubber stamp, this

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.017
committee is amazingly now on 
such a clock and calendar 

01:23:07.018 --> 01:23:09.454
process that they do not care. 
Facts be . They do not care.  

01:23:09.643 --> 01:23:11.643
They do not care that we had

01:23:16.954 --> 01:23:19.391
one witness out of three when I 
asked for a second witness I was

01:23:19.581 --> 01:23:21.641
told I could not. Even though 
there had recovery such as well 

01:23:21.829 --> 01:23:24.276
before, I was told I was asking 
too late. One witness out of two

01:23:24.454 --> 01:23:26.454
panels. That's all we had of 
witnesses. This is a travesty 

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:32.144
and a sham from day one. I could
talk until I'm blue in the face 

01:23:32.335 --> 01:23:34.335
but nobody on the majority cares

01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:47.892
but the spot that is left by 
what has just happened will 

01:23:48.081 --> 01:23:50.148
resonate over the years. It will
resonate over the years in a 

01:23:50.331 --> 01:23:52.766
sense that there is no fact that
we can come to. They had no 

01:23:52.956 --> 01:23:54.833
desire to hear any witnesses 
outside of their own plane 

01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:56.330
driven clock impeachment. The 
chairman itself of vehemently 

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:58.400
fought for minority hearing to 
sit there and read that is an 

01:23:59.146 --> 01:24:01.146
amazing statement in a crushing 
blow to this committee. There is

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.203
no way to recover from that. In 
fact

01:24:27.831 --> 01:24:30.084
there may be. I wonder if the 
chairman would join me in making

01:24:30.275 --> 01:24:32.332
sure that the rules committee 
next week, they do not way the 

01:24:32.522 --> 01:24:34.580
point of order against this. But
I know they will. That's why 

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.646
they're going to take it. 
Because I will guarantee you 

01:24:36.647 --> 01:24:38.711
when you look into it further, 
this point of order would be 

01:24:38.893 --> 01:24:40.209
sustained against these 
impeachment articles so they're 

01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:42.457
going to have to wave them next 
week. Watch and see. They will 

01:24:42.647 --> 01:24:44.707
waive this point of order and 
waive any other point of order 

01:24:44.894 --> 01:24:47.329
on these articles by the time it
comes to the floor. Some of you 

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.080
may say

01:24:56.144 --> 01:24:57.831
the ranking member talks about 
process. The ranking member 

01:24:57.832 --> 01:24:59.708
talks about process, the ranking
member talks about the process 

01:24:59.709 --> 01:25:01.961
never the foundation believe me 
we will in you date you with the

01:25:02.147 --> 01:25:04.394
fact that I have already put 
some of you do not choose to 

01:25:04.582 --> 01:25:06.649
report them. What is important 
for many who report on this body

01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:09.079
and for many have said in this 
body and for those who have 

01:25:09.268 --> 01:25:11.527
served in this body, the members
of gone before on the people of 

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:13.706
set this committee up in the 
people that have set our 

01:25:13.772 --> 01:25:15.828
Congress up of the ones right 
now that should be hanging their

01:25:16.018 --> 01:25:18.018
head in shame. We had two 
hearings none of which featured 

01:25:18.087 --> 01:25:19.953
witnesses. There is not a 
Democrat in this room that 

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:22.021
should be happy about this. The 
sol amenities should be on the 

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.891
death of this committee's 
process and procedure. Do not 

01:25:23.892 --> 01:25:25.892
give me the Solomon a about 
impeaching a president could you

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:28.588
have been wanting to do that for
a long time. You want to take it

01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:30.830
and just rejoice, go at it 
because this is what you wanted.

01:25:31.021 --> 01:25:33.080
But when it comes to the 
hearing, when it comes to the 

01:25:33.277 --> 01:25:38.333
minority rights, when it comes 
which we've seen time after time

01:25:38.524 --> 01:25:40.524
in which I've had to write this 
chairman multipage letters on 

01:25:40.581 --> 01:25:43.033
the abuse of procedural issues 
in this committee, this is a 

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:48.458
travesty. Lie about it if you, 
talk about it if you want but 

01:25:48.647 --> 01:25:50.336
the American people see it 
because the American people 

01:25:50.337 --> 01:25:52.337
understand inherently fairness. 
They understand to process

01:25:59.336 --> 01:26:01.581
. Why? Because it is what 
America was based on. It is what

01:26:01.771 --> 01:26:04.019
America takes pride in. When we 
do not have it, nobody can have 

01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:06.462
it. When we do not have fairness
in this committee, how can they 

01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:08.707
stand up and say the two weakest
articles of impeachment in the 

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.582
history of this country, 
honestly with a straight face 

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:13.020
look to the American people and 
say we did good. No you did not.

01:26:13.209 --> 01:26:17.144
You stained this body. You have 
taken this committee and made it

01:26:17.334 --> 01:26:19.334
a rubber stamp.

01:26:29.148 --> 01:26:31.584
Did any of the majority run to 
be a rubber stamp to get the 

01:26:31.772 --> 01:26:34.021
magic? I know the minority on 
this side did not. You know why 

01:26:34.212 --> 01:26:36.082
we become a rubber stamp 
question mark because my stair 

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:38.083
chairman said so 20 years ago.

01:26:43.961 --> 01:26:46.213
He said so 20 years ago when he 
said if the committee only 

01:26:46.399 --> 01:26:48.457
accepts what other people give 
him and do not on their own 

01:26:48.646 --> 01:26:50.646
verified and thoroughly vetted 
then we are nothing but a rubber

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.585
stamp. Mr. Chairman you should 
have run for chairmanship I 

01:26:52.586 --> 01:26:58.586
believe more than to be a rubber
stamp for Mr. Schiff and Ms. 

01:26:58.775 --> 01:27:00.454
Pelosi. We already do this 
committee was overrun and 

01:27:00.455 --> 01:27:02.332
overtaken Miss because Mr. 
Schiff and Ms. Pelosi took it 

01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:04.333
from us earlier this year. That 
was the first embarrassment. The

01:27:04.393 --> 01:27:06.393
rest of it has been in 
embarrassment since. We look at 

01:27:06.456 --> 01:27:08.456
this and as we go forward

01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:13.205
, we will have plenty of time to
show the complete farce of 

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:15.394
substance. Mr. Chairman what 
will live from the state is your

01:27:15.457 --> 01:27:17.457
ruling in the majority's ruling 
of minority rights are dead in 

01:27:17.527 --> 01:27:19.210
this Congress and especially 
this community. I yelled back 

01:27:19.211 --> 01:27:23.337
&gt;&gt; Mr. Chairman go are there any
amendments ? 

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.023
&gt;&gt; What purpose does the 
gentleman 

01:27:25.024 --> 01:27:30.082
&gt;&gt; I moved to strike the lighter
story. I cannot allow the 

01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:33.647
ranking member to 
mischaracterize your description

01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:35.866
of the history of this 
committee. It may be

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.083
an inconvenience for the ranking
member to be forced to listen to

01:27:42.275 --> 01:27:44.275
the history of this committee 
and why everything that you just

01:27:44.335 --> 01:27:46.374
laid out is so important. To the
continuing

01:27:58.022 --> 01:27:59.333
of this committee representing 
and recognizing respecting 

01:27:59.334 --> 01:28:01.334
minority rights but he chooses 
not to present going to restate 

01:28:01.398 --> 01:28:03.084
it again. I appreciate the 
ranking member for acknowledging

01:28:03.085 --> 01:28:07.020
that they have the opportunity 
to call witnesses. And that is 

01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:09.175
consistent with the rules. But 
to then turn around and suggest 

01:28:09.176 --> 01:28:10.786
TO that the rules are being 
SUGGEST trampled, the THE rules 

01:28:10.787 --> 01:28:13.208
are dead. Ignores everything 
that you just laid out. More 

01:28:13.398 --> 01:28:15.398
than 50 years ago

01:28:19.777 --> 01:28:21.777
. More than 50 years ago the 
joint committee on the 

01:28:21.832 --> 01:28:23.832
organization of Congress made 
clear

01:28:28.395 --> 01:28:30.460
in their report to the house and
senate that is normal procedure 

01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:32.517
for witnesses representing both 
sides of the issue to give 

01:28:32.518 --> 01:28:34.958
testimony in committee hearings.
And that is where the rule comes

01:28:35.102 --> 01:28:38.340
from. And that is what has 
happened. The ranking member 

01:28:39.098 --> 01:28:41.098
acknowledged that.

01:28:43.023 --> 01:28:48.276
There is No right to a separate 
day the rule makes clear they 

01:28:48.457 --> 01:28:51.034
have the right to call witnesses
on their way which is called on 

01:28:51.533 --> 01:28:53.533
December 

01:31:23.976 --> 01:31:25.976
ARTICLE ONE IGNORES THE 

01:31:28.871 --> 01:31:30.871
TRUTH. 
&gt;&gt; TO TWO INDIVIDUALS ON THE 

01:31:31.626 --> 01:31:35.921
CALL, NO PRESSURE, NO PUSHING, 
NO LINKAGE WHATSOEVER BETWEEN 

01:31:36.721 --> 01:31:40.206
SECURITY ASSISTANT MONEY AND ANY
TYPE OF INVESTIGATION. WE KNEW 

01:31:40.436 --> 01:31:45.106
THAT THE UKRAINIANS KNEW AT THE 
TIME OF THE CALL THAT THE 

01:31:48.801 --> 01:31:53.306
AID HAD BEEN HELD UP. MOST 
IMPORTANTLY, WE KNEW THE 

01:31:53.536 --> 01:31:58.556
UKRAINIANS TOOK NO ACTION, NO 
INVESTIGATION, NO ANNOUNCEMENT 

01:31:59.286 --> 01:32:02.506
ON CNN, NO ANNOUNCEMENT 
WHATSOEVER THERE WAS ANY TYPE OF

01:32:02.736 --> 01:32:07.156
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BIDENS TO
GET THE AID RELEASED. THOSE FOUR

01:32:07.386 --> 01:32:12.926
FACTS. THOSE FOUR FACTS HAVE 
NEVER CHANGED. SECOND, FIVE KEY 

01:32:13.156 --> 01:32:16.246
MEETINGS THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN
JULY 18th WHEN THE AID WAS 

01:32:16.606 --> 01:32:20.916
PAUSED, SEPTEMBER 11th WHEN THE 
AID WAS RELEASED. FIVE TEAM 

01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:25.926
MEETINGS, WE HAVE THE PHONE 
CALL. 5/25th. YOU JUST 

01:32:26.156 --> 01:32:34.686
DESCRIBED. SECOND, THE VERY NEXT
DAY, THE NEXT DAY WE HAVE A 

01:32:35.781 --> 01:32:40.941
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.
THIRD, MEETING AUGUST 29th, MET 

01:32:41.441 --> 01:32:45.722
SEPTEMBER 2nd AND FIFTH ON 
SEPTEMBER 5th, WE HAVE 

01:32:46.931 --> 01:32:52.646
BIPARTISAN SENATOR, SENATOR 
JOHNSON, SENATOR MURPHY MEETING 

01:32:52.876 --> 01:32:56.026
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. IN NONE
OF THOSE FIVE MEETINGS DID 

01:32:56.256 --> 01:33:00.126
LINKING DOLLARS, SECURITY 
ASSISTANT DOLLARS TO AN 

01:33:02.296 --> 01:33:06.936
INVESTIGATION COME UP. NEVER 
CAME UP. YOU WOULD THINK IN THE 

01:33:07.671 --> 01:33:11.049
LAST TWO THEY KNEW THE AID WAS 
WITHHELD IT WOULD COME UP IN THE

01:33:11.276 --> 01:33:15.726
LAST TWO MEETINGS BUT IT DIDN'T 
COME UP. MORE FACTS, THE FIVE 

01:33:16.526 --> 01:33:18.995
MEETINGS HAVE NEVER CHANGED. 
ARTICLE ONE IGNORES THE TRUTH, 

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:22.166
THE FACTS AND IGNORES WHAT 
HAPPENED AND WHAT HAS BEEN LAID 

01:33:22.406 --> 01:33:24.406
OUT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

01:33:28.116 --> 01:33:33.726
OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS. I 
HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL ADOPT 

01:33:33.956 --> 01:33:35.956
THE AMENDMENT 

01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:39.430
AND STRIKE ARTICLE 

01:33:41.556 --> 01:33:47.016
ONE. WITH THAT, I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS AMENDMENT 

01:33:47.286 --> 01:33:51.626
ATTEMPTS TO STRIKE ARTICLE ONE 
IN ITS ENTIRETY. I'M GOING TO GO

01:33:51.856 --> 01:33:54.586
THROUGH THE EVIDENCE AND 
PARTICULARLY BEGIN WITH FOCUS ON

01:33:55.446 --> 01:33:59.107
THE PRESIDENT'S OWN CONDUCT. THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

01:33:59.346 --> 01:34:04.446
HIRED RUDY GIULIANI TO GO TO 
UKRAINE AND LEAD THIS SCHEME TO 

01:34:04.685 --> 01:34:10.096
SMEAR BY PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE 
THEN BEGAN A CAMPAIGN PERSONALLY

01:34:10.356 --> 01:34:12.865
TO SMEAR AMBASSADOR YOVANOVICH 
AND RECOMMEND SHE BE FIRED TO 

01:34:14.086 --> 01:34:17.016
CLEAR THE WAY OF THIS ANTI 
CORRUPTION CHAMPION SO HIS 

01:34:17.256 --> 01:34:19.956
SCHEME COULD BE FULLY 
IMPLEMENTED. HE DIRECTED A HOLD 

01:34:20.186 --> 01:34:24.625
ON THE MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE 
AND NO ONE COULD PROVIDE ANY 

01:34:25.346 --> 01:34:27.526
EXPLANATION TO PRESSURE THEM TO 
INTERFERE IN THE 2020 ELECTION. 

01:34:27.755 --> 01:34:34.486
THEN THE PRESIDENT IN HIS OWN 
WORDS GETS ON THE TELEPHONE AND 

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:39.786
ASKED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY FOR A 
FAVOR, TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION

01:34:40.111 --> 01:34:45.046
OF HIS CHIEF POLITICAL RIVAL 
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

01:34:45.276 --> 01:34:50.286
DETAIL OF THE CONVERSATION, 
DIRECT EVIDENCE FROM ALEXANDER, 

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.036
MR. FORESTMAN WHO LISTENED IN ON
AND HEARD THE PRESIDENT OUT OF 

01:34:54.269 --> 01:34:58.056
HIS OWN MOUTH PRESSURING A 
FOREIGN LEADER TO CORRUPT OUR 

01:34:58.815 --> 01:35:02.526
ELECTION. THE PRESIDENT THEN 
MADE ADMISSIONS IN PUBLIC ON 

01:35:02.936 --> 01:35:07.815
OCTOBER 2nd, OCTOBER 3rd AND 4th
AND INVITED ANOTHER POWER TO 

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:10.105
INTERFERE. CHIEF OF STAFF 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PRESIDENT 

01:35:10.106 --> 01:35:15.676
DIRECT HIM TO PUT THIS 
UNEXPLAINED HOLD ON AID TO 

01:35:15.905 --> 01:35:19.256
UKRAINE. THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED 
THE VICE PRESIDENT NOT TO ATTEND

01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:23.026
THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY BECAUSE HE HADN'T YET 

01:35:23.256 --> 01:35:27.155
GOT WHAT HE WAS DEMANDING, A 
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT INTERBEDDED 

01:35:27.776 --> 01:35:30.566
TO DAMAGE HIS POLITICAL 
OPPONENT. AMBASSADOR TESTIFIED 

01:35:30.796 --> 01:35:34.925
THAT THE UKRAINIANS WERE TOLD 
AND I QUOTE THE RESUMPTION OF 

01:35:37.725 --> 01:35:39.945
U.S. AID WOULD LIKELY NOT RECUR 
UNTIL UKRAINE PROVIDED THE 

01:35:40.176 --> 01:35:43.286
STATEMENT WE HAVE BEEN 
DISCUSSING FOR MANY WEEKS AND 

01:35:43.522 --> 01:35:48.456
THEN TESTIFIED HE SPOKE TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHILE THE 

01:35:48.815 --> 01:35:53.365
PRESIDENT CLAIMED THERE WAS NO 
KID PRO QUO HE MADE IT CLEAR HE 

01:35:53.615 --> 01:35:56.765
MUST ANNOUNCE THE INVESTIGATION 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DISCUSSED IN THE

01:35:57.046 --> 01:36:01.706
25th CALL IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE 
LIFTED. THAT'S DIRECT EVIDENCE. 

01:36:01.935 --> 01:36:05.735
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THEY 
HIGHLIGHT THERE'S OVER 260 TEXT 

01:36:06.155 --> 01:36:10.695
MESSAGES AND CALLS AS THE 
PRESIDENT'S OWN WORDS. E-MAILS 

01:36:10.925 --> 01:36:14.746
BETWEEN HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS 
IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

01:36:14.985 --> 01:36:19.955
HUNDREDSOF PRESS STATEMENTS AND 
TWEETS BY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 

01:36:20.326 --> 01:36:23.026
PERSONAL ATTORNEY CORROBORATING 
THEIR DESIRE TO PURSUE 

01:36:23.267 --> 01:36:25.571
INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN PRIOR 
TO THE 2020 ELECTION. I'M GOING 

01:36:25.805 --> 01:36:29.346
TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE A COUPLE 
OF EXAMPLES. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:36:29.915 --> 01:36:32.376
HIMSELF SAID OCTOBER 2nd, I 
QUOTE JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE'VE 

01:36:32.615 --> 01:36:39.186
BEEN INVESTIGATING ON A PERSONAL
BASIS THROUGH RUDY AND OTHER 

01:36:39.665 --> 01:36:45.205
LAWYERS CORRUPTION IN THE 
ELECTION. AMBASSADOR E-MAILED 

01:36:45.435 --> 01:36:48.135
MULTIPLE HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS 
HE TALKED TOSSEN CAN 

01:36:52.396 --> 01:36:57.946
I AND WILL RECEIVE TO ZELENSKY. 
IN ADDITION TO THE E-MAIL, 

01:36:58.175 --> 01:37:00.175
TEXTING AMBASSADOR, 

01:37:03.455 --> 01:37:07.715
IT'S THE SAME THING CLEAR. GAVE 
HIM A FULL BRIEFING, HE'S GOT 

01:37:10.335 --> 01:37:16.075
IT. I HAD BREAKFAST WITH RUDY 
THIS MORNING. MOST IMPORTANT TO 

01:37:18.185 --> 01:37:23.786
SAY HELP INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS
ANY ANY PERSONAL ISSUES. THE 

01:37:24.036 --> 01:37:27.415
DELIVER RABBLE MEANING THAT FOR 
UKRAINE TO GET TO THE WHITE 

01:37:27.645 --> 01:37:29.846
HOUSE MEETING SEEN CAN I NEEDS 
TO ANNOUNCE THE INVESTIGATION. 

01:37:30.085 --> 01:37:35.720
HE SAYS READY TO GET DATES AS 
SOON AS THEY CONFIRM. RESPONSE 

01:37:35.955 --> 01:37:40.351
EXCELLENT. HOW TO JUST SWAY HIM.
HE RESPONDS NOT SURE I DID. I 

01:37:40.596 --> 01:37:44.595
THINK POTUS WANTS THE DELIVER 
RABBLE. HE ASKED DOES HE KNOW 

01:37:44.855 --> 01:37:51.216
THAT? HE SAID YEP, CLEARLY LOTS 
OF CONVERSATIONS GOING ON. 

01:37:51.455 --> 01:37:54.275
AUGUST 16th, AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
DISCUSSES THE CONCERN HE WAS NOT

01:37:54.616 --> 01:37:58.435
USING OFFICIAL CHANNELS LIKE THE
PRESIDENT OF JUSTICE. TAYLOR 

01:37:58.675 --> 01:38:06.095
TEXT AMBASSADOR A PERSON WHO 
ASKED FOR AN OFFICIAL REQUEST. 

01:38:06.335 --> 01:38:10.105
HE REPLIES YES BUT DON'T SITE. I
WON'T, YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS NOT

01:38:10.415 --> 01:38:15.425
GOOD. WE NEED TO STAY CLEAR. NOW
22nd AMBASSADOR E-MAILED 

01:38:15.655 --> 01:38:20.345
SECRETARY OF STATE TO MAKE SURE 
TO BREAK THE LAW JAM MEANING 

01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:23.875
RELEASING THE MILITARY AID 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WOULD HAVE TO

01:38:24.105 --> 01:38:26.255
MOVE FORWARD ON ISSUES AND 
IMPORTANCE TO TRUMP MEANING THE 

01:38:26.485 --> 01:38:31.175
INVESTIGATION AND THE LIST GOES 
ON AND ON. THIS CLAIMS THIS IS 

01:38:31.615 --> 01:38:37.590
THE EVIDENCE AND SIMPLY NOT 
TRUE. THERE'S OVERWHELMING 

01:38:37.825 --> 01:38:40.965
EVIDENCE OF AN EXISTENCE OF A 
SCHEME LED BY THE PRESIDENT TO 

01:38:41.545 --> 01:38:44.625
CORRUPT THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS 
TO CONTINUE TO BIG HOLD MILITARY

01:38:44.865 --> 01:38:49.515
AID UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT WOULD

01:38:49.745 --> 01:38:51.745
SMEAR 

01:38:54.615 --> 01:38:55.984
THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF POLITICAL 
ARRIVALS. 

01:38:55.985 --> 01:38:57.985
&gt;&gt; 

01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:05.765
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIR. I'VE 
MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

01:39:06.005 --> 01:39:08.005
MR. CHAIR, IT REALLY QUIET 

01:39:12.115 --> 01:39:18.825
DISTURBED ME WHEN YOU REJECTED 
THE RULE OF THE HOUSE WHEN IT 

01:39:19.305 --> 01:39:22.395
SAYS IN THE RULE YOU REQUIRE 
THAT YOU SET A DATE FOR A 

01:39:23.215 --> 01:39:26.275
MINORITY HEARING AND THE REASON 
THIS IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THE

01:39:26.515 --> 01:39:32.125
RULES HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT THE 
WINDOW HERE ON THIS PROCESS. IN 

01:39:35.895 --> 01:39:37.895
FACT, 

01:39:40.915 --> 01:39:42.915
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

01:39:45.735 --> 01:39:50.745
FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T GO TO 
THE COMMITTEE, INSTEAD IT'S 

01:39:55.045 --> 01:39:57.715
HANDED OVER TO ADAM S. WHERE HE 
HAS CLOSED 

01:40:02.465 --> 01:40:04.465
DOOR HEARINGS IN THE 

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:10.335
BASEMENT. I WAS TOLD SEVERAL 
TIMES I COULDN'T GO IN AND I'M 

01:40:10.565 --> 01:40:13.595
SUPPOSE TO VOTE ON THIS TODAY 
AND WE'VE NOT HAD ONE SINGLE 

01:40:13.935 --> 01:40:19.065
FACT WITNESS IN THE COMMITTEE AT
ALL AND THEN I HEAR FROM MY 

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:22.505
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE WE'RE ON 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT 

01:40:22.735 --> 01:40:25.465
REPUBLICANS WERE REFUSED TO HAVE
ANY OF THEIR WITNESSES IN THAT 

01:40:26.955 --> 01:40:31.855
COMMITTEE AND THEN ON TOP OF 
THAT 

01:40:35.155 --> 01:40:37.135
REPUBLICANS WERE TOLD, 
INTERRUPTED, SILENCED BY 

01:40:37.136 --> 01:40:39.136
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF WHEN THEY 

01:40:43.555 --> 01:40:48.575
TRIED TO ASK WITNESSES 
QUESTIONS. I MEAN, NOWEN HEARING

01:40:48.835 --> 01:40:50.945
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, WE'RE 
SUPPOSE TO VOTE ON SOMETHING 

01:40:51.715 --> 01:40:55.245
WHEN WE HAVEN'T HEARD DIRECTLY 
FROM ANY FACT WITNESSES. ALL WE 

01:40:56.225 --> 01:40:59.985
HEARD FROM WAS ABUNCH OF LIBERAL
LAW PROFESSORS THAT YOU CALLED 

01:41:00.475 --> 01:41:05.135
HERE THAT HAVE A KNOWN RECORD OF
DISLIKING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

01:41:05.365 --> 01:41:10.955
THEN YOU HAVE STAFF TALK TO US. 
AND THEN AGAIN HERE IN THIS 

01:41:11.185 --> 01:41:13.185
COMMITTEE, OUR REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS 

01:41:16.425 --> 01:41:19.245
ASK FOR WITNESSES SO THAT WE CAN
ASK QUESTIONS TO GET THE TRUTH 

01:41:19.475 --> 01:41:24.235
AND SAY OUR SIDE OF THE STORY. 
NO, SO THEN WE TURN TO OKAY, 

01:41:24.475 --> 01:41:29.715
UNDER THE HOUSE RULE IT SAYS 
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO SET A 

01:41:29.945 --> 01:41:32.925
MINORITY HEARING SO THAT WE CAN 
AT LEAST CALL WITNESSES AND WE 

01:41:33.155 --> 01:41:36.675
CAN GIVE SOME TRUTH TO THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC INSTEAD OF THIS 

01:41:37.645 --> 01:41:45.545
ONE SIDED SHAM BUT NO, HERE 
AGAIN, RIGHT HERE NO, WE'RE NOT 

01:41:46.045 --> 01:41:52.327
GOING TO DO THAT. I'LL CONSIDER 
THE FUTURE A MINORITY HEARING. 

01:41:52.565 --> 01:42:01.145
FOR GOODNESS SAKES, WE'RE VOTING
ON THIS TODAY. IT'S DONE. YOU'VE

01:42:01.375 --> 01:42:04.845
ALREADY PUT THROUGH THIS. IT 
JUST CONTINUES TO AMAZE ME HOW 

01:42:05.235 --> 01:42:10.546
CORRUPT, HOW UNFAIR THIS PROCESS
HAS BEEN FROM THE START. I MEAN,

01:42:10.785 --> 01:42:17.825
FOR GOODNESS SAKES, 17 OUT OF 24
OF MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES THAT

01:42:18.055 --> 01:42:23.795
HAVE ALREADY VOTED ON THE HOUSE 
FLOOR TO CONTINUE WITH THE 

01:42:24.035 --> 01:42:27.915
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, IT WAS 
MR. GREEN WHO PUT A RESOLUTION 

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:31.660
ON THE FLOOR, ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT, JULY 17th AND THEN 

01:42:31.895 --> 01:42:35.875
THERE WAS A VOTE TO TABLE IT AND
THEY VOTED AGAINST THE TABLING 

01:42:36.105 --> 01:42:40.610
MEANING THEY WANTED TO GO AHEAD 
WITH ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. 

01:42:40.835 --> 01:42:46.355
THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE THE  JULY 
25th CALL. I MEAN, COME ON. THIS

01:42:46.625 --> 01:42:49.895
IS A PREDETERMINED, YOU GUYS 
HAVE BEEN WANTING TO IMPEACH 

01:42:50.125 --> 01:42:52.125
THIS 

01:42:54.555 --> 01:42:56.555
PRESIDENT SINCE HE GOT 

01:42:58.935 --> 01:43:01.505
ELECTED. I KNOW SOME OF YOU 
THINK THE PRESIDENT DID 

01:43:01.745 --> 01:43:04.485
SOMETHING WRONG. THE FACT IS 
THERE IS NO, NONE OF YOUR 

01:43:04.725 --> 01:43:06.725
WITNESSES, NONE OF 

01:43:09.205 --> 01:43:15.475
YOUR FACT WITNESSES WERE ABLE TO
ESTABLISH ANY EVIDENCE OF 

01:43:15.705 --> 01:43:18.195
BRIBERY, REASON, HIGH CRIME OR 
MISDEMEANORS. THAT'S WHAT IT 

01:43:18.425 --> 01:43:21.035
SAYS HAS TO BE DONE IN THE 
CONSTITUTION. AGAIN, I BELIEVE 

01:43:21.265 --> 01:43:24.975
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES IS RIGHT THIS IS A SHAM 

01:43:25.845 --> 01:43:30.400
IMPEACHMENT AND IT SURE IS A 
SHAME AND I YIELD BACK 

01:43:34.435 --> 01:43:41.455
THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

01:43:41.685 --> 01:43:43.685
WITH 

01:43:45.545 --> 01:43:48.310
MUCH RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES IT
IS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW SOME OF 

01:43:48.535 --> 01:43:52.975
THESE ARGUMENTS. I'VE HEARD 
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ANY SUBBASE

01:43:54.075 --> 01:43:57.405
TIFF DEFENSES OF THE PRESIDENT'S
CONDUCT BUT AGAIN FOCUSED ON 

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.820
SOME ARGUMENTS IN MY VIEW AND 
I'M COMPELLED TO RESPOND TO AT 

01:44:01.054 --> 01:44:03.054
LEAST ONE OF THOSE WHICH IS THE 
NOTION 

01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:11.135
ABOUT THE CLOSED DOOR 
DEPOSITIONS. AS I UNDERSTAND IT 

01:44:11.815 --> 01:44:15.285
FROM READING THE TRANSCRIPTS, 
MANY MINORITY MEMBERS WERE 

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:19.055
PRESENT AND GRANTED EQUAL TIME 
TO QUESTION WITNESSES BROUGHT 

01:44:19.455 --> 01:44:22.350
BEFORE THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

01:44:22.705 --> 01:44:25.247
COMMITTEE AND OVERSITES 
COMMITTEE. SOME OF THESE MEMBERS

01:44:25.699 --> 01:44:29.745
ARE ON THE COMMITTEE. I STRUGGLE
TO UNDERSTAND THE REJECTIONS IN 

01:44:29.995 --> 01:44:32.625
THAT REGARD. THE IDEA THAT THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S 

01:44:32.887 --> 01:44:35.644
INVESTIGATION WAS NOT 
SUFFICIENTLY TRANSPARENT IN MY 

01:44:35.925 --> 01:44:41.655
VIEW ALSO RINGS HOLLOW. AS WE 
KNOW, THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM THOSE

01:44:41.885 --> 01:44:45.685
INTERVIEWS WAS DEPOSITIONS THAT 
HAVE BEEN RELEASED. I KNOW I 

01:44:46.464 --> 01:44:49.475
REVIEWED THEM. I SUSPECT MANY OF

01:44:53.495 --> 01:44:55.495
MY 

01:44:58.505 --> 01:45:00.505
COLLEAGUES HAVE AS WELL.

01:45:16.495 --> 01:45:20.930
LET US STAY TRUE TO THE FACTS 
AND LET'S DISPERSE THE PROCESS 

01:45:21.165 --> 01:45:25.804
ARGUMENTS AND GET TO THE SUB 
TANS OF WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. I

01:45:26.035 --> 01:45:30.825
WILL ALSO SAY HISTORICAL CONTEXT
MATTERS. I WAS NOT ON A 

01:45:31.605 --> 01:45:36.014
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN 1999 OR 
1998. MY UNDERSTANDING IS AT 

01:45:37.285 --> 01:45:41.445
THAT TIME, THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE DID NOT EXAMINE ANY 

01:45:42.085 --> 01:45:45.245
FACT WITNESSES DURING THE 
CLINTON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. I 

01:45:45.474 --> 01:45:52.130
KNOW THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE HERE AT THAT TIME. 

01:45:52.359 --> 01:45:55.245
THEY ARE WELL AWARE THEY 
QUESTIONED KEN STAR AND 

01:45:56.155 --> 01:45:59.185
AFTERWARDS HAD HEARINGS WITH 
LEGAL EXPERTS TO EXPOUND UPON 

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:04.365
THE LEGAL STANDARDS TO DEFINE A 
DECISION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. I

01:46:04.615 --> 01:46:08.914
WOULD SAY DURING THE NIXON 

01:46:13.290 --> 01:46:16.335
IMPEACHMENT, THE EXAMINATION OF 
WITNESSES. UNLIKE BOTH THE NIXON

01:46:16.564 --> 01:46:21.184
INQUIRY AS WELL AS THE CLINTON 
INQUIRY, THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 

01:46:21.489 --> 01:46:25.604
COMMITTEES HEARINGS FEATURED 
TESTIMONY FROM A DOZEN WITNESSES

01:46:25.844 --> 01:46:30.314
IN OPEN HEARING SUBJECT BY 
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS IN COUNSEL. 

01:46:30.545 --> 01:46:36.945
FACTS MATTER. I HOPE THAT EACH 
AND EVERY ONE OF US CAN AGREE AT

01:46:37.185 --> 01:46:39.894
LEAST ON THAT. I WOULD YIELD TO 
THE MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA. 

01:46:39.895 --> 01:46:48.664
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW GOING 
BACK TO THE ANALOGY TO THE NIXON

01:46:48.904 --> 01:46:52.774
IMPEACHMENT THERE WAS REALLY NO 
PUBLIC PRESENTATION IN THE 

01:46:53.094 --> 01:46:58.224
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THERE WERE 
SOME QUIET A FEW DEADLY 

01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:05.144
WEAPON TUITIONS THAT WERE 
PRIVATE BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF 

01:47:05.404 --> 01:47:10.514
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE 
AS YOU'LL RECALL, THE 

01:47:14.115 --> 01:47:17.969
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL JOHN DEAN 

01:47:21.995 --> 01:47:23.995
APPEARED 

01:47:27.014 --> 01:47:32.175
THERE WAS A RECORDING THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY KNEW ABOUT IT AND TOOK 

01:47:32.409 --> 01:47:37.314
NOTICE OF IT. THERE'S ONLY A FEW
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT 

01:47:37.674 --> 01:47:41.999
WERE ON THE DISH THEIR COMMITTEE
DURING THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT. 

01:47:42.234 --> 01:47:44.234
I WAS ONE 

01:47:48.054 --> 01:47:55.589
OF THEM. MISS JACKSON AND ADLER 
AND THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO. WE 

01:47:55.815 --> 01:48:00.734
HAD A REPORT FROM MR. STAR. I 
KNEW IT VERY WELL. WE HAD THE 

01:48:00.954 --> 01:48:03.504
REPORT. WE HAD EVIDENCE IN THE 
FORD BUILDING WE COULD GO OVER 

01:48:03.899 --> 01:48:11.394
AND LOOK AT PRIVATELY. A NUMBER 
OF MEMBERS DID. GENTLEMAN HAVE 

01:48:11.754 --> 01:48:13.754
CORRECTLY SUMMARIZED THE 

01:48:15.545 --> 01:48:17.545
SITUATION 

01:48:20.555 --> 01:48:24.764
I WOULD YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; I MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST 

01:48:24.994 --> 01:48:27.754
WORD. MISS CHAIRMAN, I THINK 
IT'S OBVIOUS TO ALL THE AMERICAN

01:48:27.984 --> 01:48:29.994
PUBLIC THAT 

01:48:34.019 --> 01:48:36.019
THIS 

01:48:39.024 --> 01:48:44.374
IS A RAILROAD TRACK. THE REAL 
KEY IS WE WERE HERE IN THE 

01:48:44.724 --> 01:48:47.074
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. THE 
REPUBLICANS AND THE PRESIDENT 

01:48:47.334 --> 01:48:49.774
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE 

01:48:53.784 --> 01:48:55.784
TO 

01:48:57.064 --> 01:48:59.854
PUT ON LIVE WITNESSES. IF YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE A TRIAL YOU'RE 

01:49:00.084 --> 01:49:02.719
GOING TO HAVE A PROSECUTION AND 
DEFENSE. WE DON'T HAVE A DEFENSE

01:49:02.954 --> 01:49:06.414
BECAUSE OF THE RULINGS THAT HAVE
BEEN MADE. ONE OF WHICH WAS MADE

01:49:06.654 --> 01:49:12.654
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO BY THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE. NOW,

01:49:12.885 --> 01:49:18.444
LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL THE 
HEARINGS THAT WERE IN THE 

01:49:18.799 --> 01:49:22.664
BASEMENT OF THE CAPITOL WERE 
SECRET HEARINGS. THEY WERE 

01:49:23.479 --> 01:49:26.894
CLASSIFIED HEARINGS. NONE OF THE
MEMBERS WHO WERE IN THAT ROOM 

01:49:27.129 --> 01:49:32.484
COULD ETHICALLY GO OUT AND TELL 
THE PUBLIC AND THE NEWS MEDIA 

01:49:33.044 --> 01:49:36.024
EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID THERE. 
THEY PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN 

01:49:36.994 --> 01:49:40.184
HELD BEFORE THE ETHICS COMMITTEE
OR WORSE IF THEY ATTEMPTED TO DO

01:49:40.414 --> 01:49:45.774
THAT. THERE WERE LEAKS THAT CAME
OUT OF THERE. I GRANT YOU THAT. 

01:49:46.004 --> 01:49:49.674
NONE OF THE MEMBERS COULD. THE 
OTHER POINT IS THAT THE VAST 

01:49:50.064 --> 01:49:55.004
MAJORITY OF MEMBERS OF THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHICH HAS 

01:49:55.744 --> 01:49:57.994
ULTIMATE JURISDICTION OVER ALL 
PROPOSED IMPEACHMENTS ARE NOT 

01:49:58.224 --> 01:50:01.584
MEMBERS OF THE THREE OTHER 
COMMITTEES AND WERE NOT ALLOWED 

01:50:02.464 --> 01:50:08.094
TO GO INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE 
CAPITOL HEARING ROOM TO LISTEN 

01:50:12.104 --> 01:50:14.104
TO 

01:50:17.104 --> 01:50:21.934
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MY 

01:50:22.166 --> 01:50:24.166
COLLEAGUES THAT 

01:50:26.872 --> 01:50:32.464
ELECTED TO DO THAT. WHEN YOU 
HAVE A TRIAL YOU REALLY CANNOT 

01:50:34.884 --> 01:50:37.014
MAKE A DETERMINATION ON EXACTLY 
WHETHER THE WITNESSES ARE 

01:50:38.094 --> 01:50:41.186
TELLING THE TRUTH OR 
EXAGGERATING OR MIXING IT UP OR 

01:50:41.444 --> 01:50:44.824
SPINNING IT SOMEWHERE OR THE 
OTHER WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM IN

01:50:45.404 --> 01:50:48.674
PERSON. WE DON'T HAVE THAT 
OPPORTUNITY. THERE WERE A FEW 

01:50:48.904 --> 01:50:51.874
SELECT WITNESSES THAT WERE IN 
THE PUBLIC HEARINGS OVER IN THE 

01:50:52.104 --> 01:50:54.104
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 

01:50:58.084 --> 01:51:00.084
A 

01:51:03.104 --> 01:51:05.104
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

01:51:08.144 --> 01:51:11.334
WE HEARD COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE 
FACT IN THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT,

01:51:13.324 --> 01:51:15.324
THERE WERE 

01:51:17.384 --> 01:51:21.364
NO FACT WITNESSES. WE WERE THERE
AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS BOTH 

01:51:21.594 --> 01:51:28.524
SIDES WERE ALLOWED TO PRESENT 
WHATEVER WITNESSES THEY WANTED 

01:51:28.754 --> 01:51:34.664
TO. STAR DID ALL THE GRONING 
WORK PUTTING TOGETHER THE FACTS.

01:51:34.904 --> 01:51:38.044
HE SENT OVER 36 BOXES OF 
EVIDENCE WHICH WAS PUT OVER INTO

01:51:42.264 --> 01:51:44.614
THE BUILDING. THAT'S NOT 
HAPPENED HERE. THE INDEPENDENT 

01:51:44.844 --> 01:51:49.794
COUNSEL LOOKED INTO WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE. MR. 

01:51:50.024 --> 01:51:53.364
MULER CAME AND TESTIFIED AND 
THAT ENDED UP BEING A BIG FIZZLE

01:51:53.765 --> 01:52:02.144
FOR WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO
DO. MUCH OF THE MULER STUFF 

01:52:02.984 --> 01:52:06.114
AFTER HIS TESTIMONY AND THE 
CROSS EXAMINATION BY MEMBERS ON 

01:52:06.354 --> 01:52:10.344
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ENDED 

01:52:14.384 --> 01:52:19.149
UP DISAPPEARING INTO OUTER 
SPACE. LET ME SAY EVERYBODY ON 

01:52:19.384 --> 01:52:23.074
BOTH ENDS OF THE TELEPHONE CALL 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

01:52:23.424 --> 01:52:31.107
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAS SAID VERY
CLEARLY THERE WAS NO QUID PRO 

01:52:31.334 --> 01:52:34.384
QUO OFFER. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE
PUT ON THE UKRAINIANS. I DON'T 

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:36.614
KNOW HOW MANY TIMES PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY 

01:52:41.164 --> 01:52:44.354
HAS TO SAY THAT. APPARENTLY, 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE MINDS ON

01:52:44.584 --> 01:52:48.234
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE 
CLOSED AND THAT'S WHAT THE FACTS

01:52:48.494 --> 01:52:52.524
ARE. THE FACTS SPEAK FOR 
THEMSELVES. THERE WAS NO 

01:52:54.544 --> 01:52:59.946
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE HERE. THAT'S
WHY ARTICLE ONE ENDED UP FALLING

01:53:00.174 --> 01:53:04.294
FLAT ON ITS FACE AND THAT IT 
SHOULD BE STRICKEN AND I SUPPORT

01:53:04.649 --> 01:53:10.644
THE AMENDMENT TO STRIKE IT FROM 
A GENTLEMAN OF OHIO AND 

01:53:14.684 --> 01:53:19.863
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 

01:53:19.864 --> 01:53:23.934
&gt;&gt; REAL QUICK. ALSO, JUST KENT 
STAR SENT THOSE OVER BEFORE THE 

01:53:24.434 --> 01:53:26.434
HEARINGS BEGAN TOO, CORRECT. WE 
DIDN'T 

01:53:29.254 --> 01:53:34.513
GET IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
HEARING? 

01:53:34.514 --> 01:53:39.033
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS 
EXPIRED. 

01:53:39.034 --> 01:53:42.833
&gt;&gt; TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 

01:53:42.834 --> 01:53:45.639
&gt;&gt; I THINK BEFORE I BEGIN TO 
COMMENT ON THE DISCUSSION HERE, 

01:53:45.874 --> 01:53:49.864
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND ALL OF 
US THAT THE PRESIDENT ABUSED HIS

01:53:50.324 --> 01:53:54.864
POWER AND IS A CONTINUING THREAT
NOT ONLY TO DEMOCRACY BUT OUR 

01:53:55.094 --> 01:54:00.384
NATIONAL SECURITY. WE DO NOT 
TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. WE TAKE IT 

01:54:00.614 --> 01:54:03.634
VERY SERIOUSLY. I BEG TO DIFFER 
WITH MY DEAR FRIEND AS ONE WHO 

01:54:03.854 --> 01:54:12.354
WAS HERE FOR THE IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS IN 1998 ALONG WITH 

01:54:12.609 --> 01:54:16.404
MY COLLEAGUES I NEED TO BE VERY 
CLEAR OF 

01:54:20.194 --> 01:54:25.854
THE DISTINCTIVE DIFFERENCE WE 
HAD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE 

01:54:26.084 --> 01:54:31.184
PROSECUTOR WAS AN INDEPENDENT 
STATUTE THAT ALLOWED DURING THE 

01:54:31.644 --> 01:54:33.833
NIXON IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS 
AND MRS. STAR TO HAVE AN 

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:38.584
INDEPENDENT PROCESS OF 
INVESTIGATION. THE CONGRESS WAS 

01:54:39.104 --> 01:54:41.564
NOT PREVIEWED TO ANY OF THAT 
INVESTIGATION AT ALL. THEY 

01:54:43.464 --> 01:54:45.464
PROCEEDED 

01:54:47.483 --> 01:54:52.594
AND WERE NOT INTERFERED WITH AS 
MR. MULER WAS BECAUSE HE WAS AN 

01:54:52.824 --> 01:54:57.974
EMPLOYEE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE AND HIS EMPLOYER CAME 

01:54:58.234 --> 01:55:01.584
OUT AND CHARACTERIZED HIS REPORT
BEFORE HE COULD DISCUSS IT. IN 

01:55:02.154 --> 01:55:04.154
THE 

01:55:05.924 --> 01:55:08.744
INSTANCE OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF 
1998, CONGRESS RECEIVED A REPORT

01:55:08.974 --> 01:55:17.584
JUST AS BOTH OUR PRESIDENT ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND 

01:55:17.984 --> 01:55:24.614
WE, THE MAJORITY RECEIVED 
REPORTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHO 

01:55:24.853 --> 01:55:28.714
WERE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEES. 
THEY DID THEIR WORK IN A 

01:55:30.754 --> 01:55:35.973
CLASSIFIED SETTING AS I IMAGINED
BOTH MR. STAR HAD TO DO IN 

01:55:37.744 --> 01:55:39.713
CERTAIN INSTANCES. THEY WERE 
LIKE PROSECUTORS. THEY HAD 

01:55:39.714 --> 01:55:44.013
WITNESSES NOT IN THE PUBLIC AND 
THEN THERE WERE FULL PUBLIC 

01:55:44.244 --> 01:55:46.713
HEARINGS, 17 WITNESSES, 
FIRSTHAND 

01:55:50.494 --> 01:55:55.783
WITNESSES WHO HEARD THE CALL AND
TESTIFIED ON FIRSTHAND 

01:55:56.024 --> 01:55:58.864
KNOWLEDGE. IT'S CLEAR WE'RE 
DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF A 

01:55:59.094 --> 01:56:02.622
CONTINUING THREAT WHICH IS WHY 
WE HAVE TO RESPOND. LET ME BE 

01:56:02.854 --> 01:56:08.928
CLEAR. I HOLD IN MY HAND THE 
UNCLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT. I BEG 

01:56:09.153 --> 01:56:12.564
TO DIFFER WITH MY FRIENDS. ALLOW
ME TO TELL YOU FOR A 

01:56:16.574 --> 01:56:20.574
MOMENT IN THE CALL PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY SAID THESE SENTENCES. I

01:56:20.804 --> 01:56:25.199
WOULD LIKE THORACIC OUTLET THANK
YOU FOR YOUR DEFENSE AND TRYING 

01:56:25.433 --> 01:56:31.223
TO COOPERATE. WE WANT TO BE 
READY TO BUY JAVELINS. THAT'S 

01:56:31.453 --> 01:56:35.873
MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM THE 
UNITED STATES FOR DEFENSE 

01:56:36.104 --> 01:56:40.163
PURPOSES. UKRAINE, IN THE MIDST 
OF A WAR AGAINST A NATION THAT 

01:56:40.394 --> 01:56:43.153
SHOT DOWN AT LEAST SOME 

01:56:46.814 --> 01:56:50.533
OF THOSE ALLEGED TO BE 
SEPARATIST, COMMERCIAL AIRLINES.

01:56:50.763 --> 01:56:55.704
OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE 
MILITARY ARE ON THE GROUND 

01:56:56.264 --> 01:56:58.264
TRYING TO ASSIST 

01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:03.778
AND HERE'S THE NEXT SENTENCE. 
LET GET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF 

01:57:04.559 --> 01:57:06.944
DEFENSE. LET'S REVIEW YOUR 
REQUEST. THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE.

01:57:07.184 --> 01:57:09.573
I WOULD LIKE YOU 

01:57:12.714 --> 01:57:19.204
TO DO A FAVOR THOUGH. 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT 

01:57:19.433 --> 01:57:22.924
DEFENSE. THE NEXT SENTENCE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN WE'RE 

01:57:27.654 --> 01:57:30.553
WELL AWARE OF THE PREDICAMENT. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE 

01:57:30.793 --> 01:57:33.124
ATTORNEY GENERAL CALL YOU OR 
YOUR PEOPLE AND WOULD LIKE YOU 

01:57:33.354 --> 01:57:35.354
TO GET TO 

01:57:37.288 --> 01:57:43.228
THE BOTTOM OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION. I WOULD JUST 

01:57:43.454 --> 01:57:45.454
OFFER TO 

01:57:47.253 --> 01:57:49.253
SAY 

01:57:50.293 --> 01:57:52.293
THAT IT IS 

01:57:55.913 --> 01:57:57.913
NOT WITHOUT FACTS WE 

01:58:01.953 --> 01:58:03.953
PROCEED.

01:58:15.873 --> 01:58:19.663
&gt;&gt; THE MILITARY AS UKRAINIAN 
SOLDIERS PERISHED THE BATTLE. 

01:58:19.893 --> 01:58:24.034
NOTE ALSO THE HIGHEST DEATH 
TOTAL ON ANY DAY IN THE UKRAINE 

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:30.233
RUSSIAN WAR WAS AUGUST 7th THIS 
YEAR WHILE AID WAS BEING 

01:58:30.594 --> 01:58:33.878
WITHHELD. THIS HAS LIFE AND 
DEATH CONSEQUENCES AND I YIELD 

01:58:34.113 --> 01:58:38.703
BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN. 
&gt;&gt; VERY QUICKLY. IMPEACHMENT IS 

01:58:38.924 --> 01:58:42.503
DESIGNED FOR THE PRESIDENT AND 
HIS HIGHER MINISTERS TO BE 

01:58:42.733 --> 01:58:45.313
CALLED INTO ACCOUNT. THAT'S ALL 
WE'RE DOING ON THE BEHALF OF THE

01:58:45.543 --> 01:58:49.923
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND PROSECTING 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

01:58:53.843 --> 01:58:55.843
OF 

01:58:58.854 --> 01:59:00.854
THIS NATION. I YIELD BACK.

01:59:11.473 --> 01:59:16.553
&gt;&gt; FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE 
BEEN IN A WAR ZONE, PEOPLE DO 

01:59:20.403 --> 01:59:22.403
DIE 

01:59:25.093 --> 01:59:30.323
IN THE WAR ZONE. 
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT CLINTON SUBMITTED A

01:59:30.553 --> 01:59:33.758
CRIME AND PERJURY. THE 
CONSTITUTION IS PRETTY CLEAR ON 

01:59:35.313 --> 01:59:38.903
WHAT CONSTITUTES AN IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSE. REASON, BRIBERY AND 

01:59:39.844 --> 01:59:42.103
OTHER HIGH CRIMES. IT'S NOT 
REASON, BRIBERY AND OTHER HIGH 

01:59:42.333 --> 01:59:44.333
CRIMES AND DEMEANORS AND 
WHATEVER 

01:59:46.553 --> 01:59:50.453
ELSE NANCY AND ADAM SCHIFF DEEM 
IMPEACHABLE. I THINK WE COULD 

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:54.073
SAY NO PRESIDENT INTERVENES WITH
THE HOUSING OFFICES. JUST LIKE 

01:59:54.303 --> 01:59:57.508
THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T ABUSE 
THE POWERS TO OBTAIN THE PHONE 

01:59:57.738 --> 02:00:00.543
RECORDS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERSONAL ATTORNEY, A MEMBER OF 

02:00:00.779 --> 02:00:02.779
THE MEDIA, RANKS MEMBER OF THE 

02:00:05.473 --> 02:00:10.243
SAME COMMITTEE. THAT DOESN'T 
MAKE ALLEGED ABUSIVE POWER. ON 

02:00:10.483 --> 02:00:12.833
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS OF 
IMPEACHMENT, THE MAJORITY GOES 

02:00:13.063 --> 02:00:18.173
TO GREAT LENGTHS TO EXPLAIN WHY 
THE ABUSIVE POWER IS AN 

02:00:18.523 --> 02:00:20.993
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE MENTIONING 
IT WAS ONE OF THE CHARGES 

02:00:21.223 --> 02:00:23.443
AGAINST RICHARD NIXON AND BILL 
CLINTON. WHAT THEY DON'T MENTION

02:00:24.053 --> 02:00:29.523
IS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HAS NEVER ADOPTED AN ALLEGED 

02:00:30.108 --> 02:00:33.763
ABUSIVE EMPOWER AS AN 
IMPEACHMENT. WHY? THERE'S NO 

02:00:34.003 --> 02:00:39.323
CRIMINAL STATUTE DESCRIBING WHAT
ALLEGED ABUSIVE POWER IS. IT'S 

02:00:39.863 --> 02:00:41.863
THERE ARE FOR A 

02:00:45.983 --> 02:00:52.203
BIG AND AM BIGGOUS AMBIGUOUS 
TERM. THEY SHOW THE ACTIONS OF 

02:00:53.263 --> 02:00:57.993
THE PRESIDENT RISE TO A LEVEL OF
IMPEACHMENT. I BELIEVE BILL 

02:00:58.503 --> 02:01:01.528
CLINTON HAD ABUSED THE POWER OF 
HIS OFFICE AND WE FAILED TO 

02:01:01.758 --> 02:01:05.733
CONVINCE THE COLLEAGUES IN THE 
HOUSE AND THAT PARTICULAR CHARGE

02:01:06.003 --> 02:01:11.503
WAS REJECTED BY THE CASE. IN 
THIS CASE, THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED

02:01:12.357 --> 02:01:17.088
IS LESS CONVINCING AND 
NONEXISTENT. FIST, NO QUID PRO 

02:01:17.323 --> 02:01:24.443
QUO. SECOND, IT'S LIKELY KNOWN 
THAT UKRAINE IS ONE OF THE MOST 

02:01:28.023 --> 02:01:31.313
CORRUPT COUNTRIES ON THE PLANET.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS WELL AWARE 

02:01:31.808 --> 02:01:36.381
OF THE FACT AND QUIET SKEPTICAL 
OF GETTING UKRAINE FOREIGN AID 

02:01:36.613 --> 02:01:40.073
LONG BEFORE THE JULY 25th PHONE 
CALL. THIRD UKRAINE ACTUALLY 

02:01:40.303 --> 02:01:45.813
RECEIVED THE AID AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT WAS SATISFIED THAT 

02:01:46.393 --> 02:01:50.273
UKRAINE HAD TAKEN MEANINGFUL 
STEPS. WHICH AGAIN IS AN 

02:01:51.163 --> 02:01:56.043
OBLIGATION REQUIRED BY LAW. 
BASED ON THE ACTUAL FACTS OF THE

02:01:56.283 --> 02:01:58.283
CASE COMPILED BY THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, IT'S 

02:01:58.533 --> 02:02:02.733
CLEAR NO ABUSIVE POWER EVER TOOK
PLACE AND THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T 

02:02:03.003 --> 02:02:07.193
ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT. MR. 

02:02:07.423 --> 02:02:11.843
CHAIRMAN, AS YOU WELL KNOW 
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

02:02:12.378 --> 02:02:15.083
BETWEEN THE POWER CHARGES 
BETWEEN NIXON AND CLINTON AND 

02:02:15.783 --> 02:02:19.243
THOSE PRESENTED HERE. IN THE 
NIXON IMPEACHMENT, ABUSIVE POWER

02:02:20.303 --> 02:02:23.663
WAS ATTACKED ON CHARGE. FAR LESS
IMPORTANT THAN THE ACTUAL HIGH 

02:02:23.893 --> 02:02:27.323
CRIMES CHARGED AGAINST BOTH OF 
THEM. HERE IT'S THE MAIN THRUST 

02:02:27.563 --> 02:02:31.533
OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ENTIRE 
CASE. LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY.

02:02:31.773 --> 02:02:33.773
THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT FOR 
IMPEACHMENT IN THIS CASE IS 

02:02:33.933 --> 02:02:39.033
BASED ON A CHARGE THAT IS NOT A 
CRIME. MUCH LESS A HIGH CRIME 

02:02:39.263 --> 02:02:43.883
AND THAT HAS NEVER BEEN APPROVED
BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

02:02:44.113 --> 02:02:46.363
AND A PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT 
BEFORE EVER IN HISTORY. IF 

02:02:47.083 --> 02:02:50.643
THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT, YOU 
WASTED A WHOLE LOT OF TIME AND 

02:02:50.883 --> 02:02:58.253
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ALL BECAUSE SO 
MANY OF YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, HATE 

02:02:58.533 --> 02:03:03.943
THIS PRESIDENT. ONE LAST THING, 
I GUESS WE NOW KNOW WHY NANCY 

02:03:04.183 --> 02:03:08.083
PELOSI WAS FOCUSED ON BRIBERY AS
A POTENTIAL CHARGE. SHE WAS 

02:03:08.483 --> 02:03:13.613
DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR A 
CRIME, ANY CRIME TO JUSTIFY THIS

02:03:13.843 --> 02:03:16.043
SHAM IMPEACHMENT. THAT WAS 
ABANDONED BECAUSE SHE KNOWS MOST

02:03:16.353 --> 02:03:20.263
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS KNOW AND NOW
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THERE 

02:03:20.753 --> 02:03:27.503
SIMPLY WASN'T A CRIME COMMITTED 
HERE AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE AN 

02:03:31.218 --> 02:03:35.292
IMPEACHMENT HERE EITHER. I YIELD
BACK. 

02:03:35.293 --> 02:03:41.873
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. THERE 
ARE NO CRIMES HERE. THAT IS THE 

02:03:42.123 --> 02:03:45.003
DEFENSE MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE
AISLE LOOK FORWARD. HOW ABOUT 

02:03:45.233 --> 02:03:49.593
THE HIGHEST CRIME ONE WHO HOLDS 
PUBLIC OFFICE COULD 

02:03:54.533 --> 02:03:57.783
COMMIT? A CRIME AGAINST HOUR 
CONSTITUTION. AFTERALL, THE 

02:03:58.043 --> 02:04:02.013
CONSTITUTION IS THE HIGHEST MOST
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND. EVERY 

02:04:03.373 --> 02:04:05.373
OTHER LAW, STATUTORY LAWS 
INCLUDED DERIVE FROM THE 

02:04:06.433 --> 02:04:10.913
CONSTITUTION, NOT THE OTHER WAY 
AROUND. THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED 

02:04:11.143 --> 02:04:16.633
THE HIGHEST CRIME AGAINST THE 
CONSTITUTION BY ABUSING HIS 

02:04:16.853 --> 02:04:24.658
OFFICE. CHEATING IN AN ELECTION 
AND INVITING FOREIGN 

02:04:24.913 --> 02:04:27.313
INTERFERENCE FOR PURELY PERSONAL
GAIN WHILE JEOPARDIZING OUR 

02:04:27.913 --> 02:04:34.343
NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE 
INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. NOW,

02:04:34.583 --> 02:04:37.923
THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT 
REQUIRE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE 

02:04:38.323 --> 02:04:41.863
COMMITTED STATUTORY CRIMES. 
AFTERALL, WE IN CONGRESS ARE NOT

02:04:42.743 --> 02:04:46.503
CRIMINAL PROSECUTORS. WE DO NOT 
PROSECUTE CRIMES, WE PROTECT THE

02:04:46.953 --> 02:04:50.663
CONSTITUTION. SINCE MY 
COLLEAGUES KEEP BRINGING UP WHAT

02:04:51.153 --> 02:04:53.153
POTENTIAL CRIMES A CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTOR COULD CHARGE A 

02:04:53.263 --> 02:04:56.033
PRESIDENT WITH, LET'S GO THROUGH

02:04:59.913 --> 02:05:03.033
SOME OF THEM. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
CONDUCT OVERLAPS WITH CRIMINAL 

02:05:03.913 --> 02:05:10.233
ACTS. LET'S START THE CRIMINAL 
BRIBERY, 18U.S. CODE 201B2A. 

02:05:10.473 --> 02:05:14.193
RELEVANT HERE, CRIMINAL BRIBERY 
OCCURS WHEN A PUBLIC OFFICIAL 

02:05:14.433 --> 02:05:17.083
DEMANDS OR SEEKS ANYTHING OF 
VALUE PERSONALLY. IN RETURN TO 

02:05:17.393 --> 02:05:21.193
BEING INFLUENCED IN THE 
PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICIAL ACT. 

02:05:21.433 --> 02:05:26.263
ADDITIONALLY, THE PUBLIC 
OFFICIAL MUST CARRY OUT THESE 

02:05:26.592 --> 02:05:30.882
ACTS ABRUPTLY. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DEMANDED AND SOUGHT THE 

02:05:34.002 --> 02:05:36.723
ANNOUNCEMENT AND CONDUCT 
LITTICLY MOTIVATED. ANYTHING OF 

02:05:36.958 --> 02:05:42.302
VALUE PERSONALLY, FOR THE 
PURPOSE OF ANTI BRIBERY LAW, THE

02:05:44.553 --> 02:05:48.573
VALUE HAS BEEN BROADLY CARRIED 
OUT THE PURPOSE OF PUNISHING THE

02:05:49.273 --> 02:05:54.152
ABUSE OF PUBLIC OFFICE. THE 
THIRD REQUIREMENT AS THE SPELL 

02:05:54.382 --> 02:05:56.493
COMMITTEE REPORTED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SOUGHT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF 

02:05:56.733 --> 02:06:03.033
THESE INVESTIGATIONS IN RETURN 
FOR THE TWO OFFICIAL ACTS. 

02:06:03.263 --> 02:06:05.672
FIRST, THE CONDITIONED RELEASE 
OF VITAL MILITARY ASSISTANT AND 

02:06:05.923 --> 02:06:11.793
SECOND, HE CONDITIONED A HEAD OF
STATE MEETING ON THESE 

02:06:12.153 --> 02:06:14.733
INVESTIGATIONS. FOURTH, 
PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICIAL ACT. 

02:06:14.967 --> 02:06:20.838
THE COURTS DEFINED AN OFFICIAL 
ACT AS ANY DECISION OR ACTION, 

02:06:21.233 --> 02:06:24.308
MATTER, CAUSE, SUIT OR 
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY BE WITH THE

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:31.273
OFFICIAL. THE MILITARY AID AND 
THE WHITE HOUSE MEET THIS 

02:06:31.513 --> 02:06:33.361
REQUIREMENT. FINALLY, CORRUPTLY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP BEHAVED 

02:06:33.362 --> 02:06:37.162
CORRUPTLY THROUGHOUT THIS COURSE
OF CONDUCT BECAUSE HE USED THIS 

02:06:37.513 --> 02:06:43.352
OFFICIAL OFFICE IN EXCHANGE TO 
SEEK A PRIVATE BENEFIT. A SECOND

02:06:44.742 --> 02:06:48.315
CRIME, SERVICE FRAUD. 18U.S. 
CODE SECTION 1346. PRESIDENT 

02:06:49.577 --> 02:06:51.903
TRUMP KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY 
ORCHESTRATED A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD

02:06:52.143 --> 02:06:55.792
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF THE 
SERVICES AS PRESIDENT OF THE 

02:06:56.762 --> 02:06:59.592
UNITED STATES. THIS HAS BEEN A 
LINE OFTEN IN THE COURTS WITH 

02:06:59.892 --> 02:07:01.892
BRIBERY ACCEPTED AND ALSO 
INCLUDED 

02:07:04.863 --> 02:07:06.051
USING A WIDER COMMUNICATION, 
CLEARLY. 

02:07:06.052 --> 02:07:11.723
&gt;&gt; DO YOU YIELD YOUR QUESTION? 
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT YIELD. THE JULY 25 

02:07:11.953 --> 02:07:15.322
PHONE CALL CONSTITUTES A WIRE 
COMMUNICATION. THERE YOU HAVE 

02:07:15.553 --> 02:07:19.483
IT. AT LEAST TWO CRIMINAL 
STATUTORY CRIMES. HOWEVER, ALL 

02:07:19.712 --> 02:07:22.372
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 
STATUTORY CRIMES ARE MOOT 

02:07:22.603 --> 02:07:26.673
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES REFUSES TO ALLOW 

02:07:28.508 --> 02:07:32.433
HIS OWN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO
INDICT HIM. THE PRESIDENT MAY BE

02:07:32.693 --> 02:07:35.482
CHARGED WITH CRIMES STATUTORILY 
ONE DAY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT 

02:07:36.232 --> 02:07:40.162
WE'RE DOING HERE ON THIS DAY. WE
ARE NOT RESTRICTED LIKE THE 

02:07:40.422 --> 02:07:43.683
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS. WE 
WILL UPHOLD OUR DUTY TO CHARGE 

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:47.413
THE PRESIDENT WITH THE CRIMES 
AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION THAT HE

02:07:49.673 --> 02:07:52.063
HAS COMMITTED USING YOUR 
TAXPAYER DOLLARS JEOPARDIZING 

02:07:52.302 --> 02:08:00.852
THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR VOTE FOR A
PURELY POLITICAL PURPOSE AND A 

02:08:02.953 --> 02:08:06.162
PURELY PERSONAL GAIN. MR. 
CHAIRMAN, WITH THAT I 

02:08:09.853 --> 02:08:12.868
YIELD. 
&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THE GENTLEMAN'S 

02:08:13.112 --> 02:08:16.302
FORMER PROSECUTOR SPEAKING WITH 
AUTHORITY. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 

02:08:16.543 --> 02:08:20.842
THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT SOMEHOW 
LYING ABOUT A SEXUAL AFFAIR IS 

02:08:21.582 --> 02:08:26.017
AN ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER 
BUT THE MISUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL 

02:08:26.252 --> 02:08:31.553
POWERS TO GET A BENEFIT SOMEHOW 
DOESN'T MATTER. IF IT'S LYING 

02:08:31.793 --> 02:08:35.693
ABOUT SEX WE COULD PUT STORMY 
DANIELS AHEAD OF US. WE DON'T 

02:08:37.132 --> 02:08:38.792
BELIEVE THAT'S A HIGH CRIME. 
&gt;&gt; YIELD. 

02:08:38.793 --> 02:08:43.472
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT BEFORE US. IT 
SHOULD NOT BE FOR US. IT'S NOT 

02:08:44.472 --> 02:08:50.161
AN ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER. 
I FIELD BACK. 

02:08:50.162 --> 02:08:52.282
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN, THIS TIME HAS 

02:08:55.783 --> 02:08:57.783
EXPIRED. 
&gt;&gt; I 

02:08:59.618 --> 02:09:01.301
RISE IN SUPPORT. 
&gt;&gt; YIELD BRIEFLY. 

02:09:01.302 --> 02:09:03.571
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN YIELD BRIEFLY? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

02:09:03.572 --> 02:09:09.064
&gt;&gt; THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT 
BILL CLINTON LIED TO A GRAND 

02:09:09.823 --> 02:09:14.022
JURY. THAT IS A CRIME. THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT PASSED 

02:09:14.263 --> 02:09:18.262
THE HOUSE AND ACCUSED BILL 
CLINTON OF LYING TO A GRAND 

02:09:18.502 --> 02:09:21.873
JURY, A CRIME AND SOMETHING THAT
OBSTRUCTS THE ABILITY OF THE 

02:09:22.112 --> 02:09:27.152
COURTS TO GET TO THE TRUTH. THIS
IS NOT WHAT IS 

02:09:31.492 --> 02:09:35.892
HAPPENING HERE. BIG DIFFERENCE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IT IS INTERESTING 

02:09:36.132 --> 02:09:41.952
THOUGH WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF 
FRAUD. NOT VALUED PRESIDENT BUT 

02:09:42.202 --> 02:09:46.422
FROM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE. I REALIZE PEOPLE ON THE

02:09:46.662 --> 02:09:49.712
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAVE 
BEEN BUSY TRYING TO FIND SOME 

02:09:49.952 --> 02:09:52.482
KIND OF CRIMINAL CHARGE TO BRING
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT NONE OF 

02:09:52.742 --> 02:09:56.392
WHICH WORKED THAT THEY MAY NOT 
HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE MOST 

02:09:57.352 --> 02:10:03.952
RESENT REPORT BUT IT IS CLEAR 
NOW, IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT THE 

02:10:04.892 --> 02:10:07.192
WHOLE INVESTIGATION THAT HAS 
BROUGHT US HERE WITH CRIME 

02:10:10.672 --> 02:10:14.752
AFTER CRIME BEING ALLEGED AND 
HAVING TO BE DROPPED WAS A 

02:10:14.982 --> 02:10:19.662
FRAUDULENT EFFORT BEFORE THE 
COURT TO HAVE A SURVEILLANCE 

02:10:20.687 --> 02:10:24.392
WARRANT DONE AGAINST CARTER 
PAGE. THEY LIED INITIALLY AND 

02:10:24.882 --> 02:10:30.237
SAID THAT HE WAS A RUSSIAN AGENT
WHEN ACTUALLY HE HAD BEEN USED 

02:10:30.472 --> 02:10:37.877
BY THE CIA AS A SPY AGAINST 
RUSSIA. SO THEY LIED. IT WAS 

02:10:38.112 --> 02:10:41.092
FRAUDULENT AND THERE HOPEFULLY 
WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL ANSWER 

02:10:41.322 --> 02:10:43.912
FOR THEIR CRIMES AND FRAUD IN 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR 

02:10:44.152 --> 02:10:48.992
THE DAYS TO COME AND THAT SOUNDS
LIKE IT SHOULD BE THE CASE. IT 

02:10:49.222 --> 02:10:51.452
WAS FRAUD THROUGH. FOR THREE 
YEARS WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT 

02:10:51.792 --> 02:10:55.472
THE CRIMES OF THE CANDIDATE 
TRUMP AND THEN THE CRIMES OF 

02:10:55.712 --> 02:11:01.592
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WE COME NOW 
TODAY BASED ON THE INITIAL FRAUD

02:11:01.832 --> 02:11:05.782
THAT GOT THIS WHOLE IMPEACHMENT 
STUFF STARTED AND NO ONE ON THE 

02:11:06.482 --> 02:11:09.532
OTHER SIDE IS WILLING TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FRAUD THAT 

02:11:09.772 --> 02:11:13.602
BROUGHT US HERE NOR THE FACT 
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE 

02:11:14.082 --> 02:11:18.222
BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S CRIMES AND WE'RE 

02:11:18.722 --> 02:11:23.417
EVEN HEARING TODAY LIKE WE JUST 
DID OH YES, THERE WERE CRIMES. 

02:11:23.652 --> 02:11:27.392
WHY AREN'T THEY IN THIS 
IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENT? BECAUSE 

02:11:27.632 --> 02:11:31.862
THEY DON'T EXIST. THEY'VE BEEN 
DISPROVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER

02:11:32.412 --> 02:11:36.482
AGAIN AND THAT'S WHY THE 
GENTLEMAN'S AMENDMENT IS SO WELL

02:11:36.847 --> 02:11:40.702
TAKEN. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN
THIS GROUND. I THINK IT'S A BAD 

02:11:41.012 --> 02:11:46.302
IDEA WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED 
BEFORE. HIGH CRIMES AND 

02:11:46.662 --> 02:11:49.942
MISDEMEANORS IF IT'S NOT REASON,
EVEN MISDEMEANORS ARE CRIMES. SO

02:11:50.282 --> 02:11:53.882
WE'VE HAD TO DROP THE FRAUD OF 
ALL THE CRIMES BEING ALLEGED AND

02:11:54.242 --> 02:11:56.242
PEOPLE SAYING IN 

02:11:58.022 --> 02:12:03.642
HERE AND IN THE PUBLIC GEE, 
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE PRESIDENT

02:12:04.052 --> 02:12:09.027
BECAUSE HE CONCLUDED WITH RUSSIA
AND THAT'S BEEN DISPROVEN AND 

02:12:09.527 --> 02:12:11.862
DROPPED. NOW WE'RE LEFT WITH 
BRIBERY AND DISTORTION AND NOW 

02:12:12.132 --> 02:12:16.182
THOSE HAD TO BE DROPPED BECAUSE 
THERE WERE NO CRIMES AND I 

02:12:16.452 --> 02:12:19.292
APPRECIATE THE GENTLEMAN 
BRINGING UP CRIMES BUT THOSE ARE

02:12:19.652 --> 02:12:23.302
NOT ALLEGED HERE. LET ME JUST 
SAY THIS IS A DAY THAT 

02:12:28.072 --> 02:12:30.072
WILL LIVE IN EMERGENCY

02:12:34.712 --> 02:12:38.352
INFAMY. THOSE DAYS ARE GOING TO 
BE GONE. THIS BECAME A TOOL OF 

02:12:38.832 --> 02:12:45.757
THE MAJORITY TO TRY TO DEFEAT, 
USE TAXPAYER FUNDS, TO DEFEAT A 

02:12:46.002 --> 02:12:48.022
PRESIDENT. BY THE WAY, THE STAR 
REPORT, 36 BOXES, 

02:12:51.612 --> 02:12:55.132
HE CAME IN AND TESTIFIED. WE 
WERE KEPT OUT OF HEARING THE 

02:12:55.732 --> 02:12:59.092
WITNESSES. THERE WERE, IN THE 
WATER GATE, THESE WITNESSES 

02:12:59.912 --> 02:13:05.762
TESTIFIED ON TELEVISION. IT WAS 
PUBLIC. IT WAS NOT A STAR 

02:13:05.992 --> 02:13:09.862
CHAMBER LIKE THE SCHIFF CHAMBER 
BECAME. I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD 

02:13:10.117 --> 02:13:15.437
BACK MY TIME TO MY FRIEND. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN DID IT HAPPEN? IF IT 

02:13:15.672 --> 02:13:19.472
HAPPENED WHY ISN'T IT IN THE 
RESOLUTION. DEMOCRATS SAY 

02:13:19.712 --> 02:13:22.282
THERE'S SOME SCHEME TO HAVE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY PRESIDENT 

02:13:22.522 --> 02:13:26.302
ZELENSKY TO GET A PHONE CALL 
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND GET THE 

02:13:27.222 --> 02:13:30.022
AID RELEASED. WHEN DID THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT HAPPEN? THEY GOT 

02:13:30.262 --> 02:13:34.562
THE CALL ON  JULY 25th. THEY GOT
THE MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 25th. 

02:13:34.792 --> 02:13:38.092
THEY GOT THEIR MONEY ON 
SEPTEMBER 11th. THERE WAS NEVER 

02:13:38.732 --> 02:13:41.132
AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE 
UKRAINIANS TO DO AN 

02:13:41.392 --> 02:13:44.253
INVESTIGATION. YOU CAN KEEP 
SAYING ALL THIS STUFF AND ALL 

02:13:44.482 --> 02:13:48.142
THE POINTS THIS HAPPENED, IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. NOT THE FACTS. 

02:13:48.382 --> 02:13:51.792
THOSE ARE NOT THE FACTS. WE KNOW
WHY THE AID GOT RELEASED, WE 

02:13:52.052 --> 02:13:54.664
LEARNED THIS GUY, THE NEW 
PRESIDENT WAS ACTUALLY THE 

02:13:54.902 --> 02:13:58.112
TRANSFORMER, THE REAL DEAL WAS 
ACTUALLY A DEAL WITH THE 

02:13:58.352 --> 02:14:00.770
CORRUPTION DEAL IN HIS COUNTRY. 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. YOU CAN 

02:14:01.012 --> 02:14:03.012
MAKE UP ALL THE THINGS YOU 

02:14:05.222 --> 02:14:07.242
WANT. THOSE ARE NOT 

02:14:11.272 --> 02:14:13.272
THE 

02:14:16.122 --> 02:14:17.441
FACTS. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN, TIME EXPIRED. 

02:14:17.442 --> 02:14:22.922
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT APEWSED HIS POWER. 

02:14:23.162 --> 02:14:25.582
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE HE WELCOMED 
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

02:14:28.902 --> 02:14:33.012
AS IT RELATES TO RUSSIA. HE 
SOLICITED THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN 

02:14:33.252 --> 02:14:40.532
WITH CHINA AND DID IT WITH 
UKRAINE. HE'S A SERIAL 

02:14:41.422 --> 02:14:45.992
SOLICITOR. LET'S GO THROUGH THE 
FACTS. CONGRESS ALLOCATED $391 

02:14:46.232 --> 02:14:50.372
MILLION ON A MILITARY AID TO 
UKRAINE. CURRENTLY AT WAR WITH 

02:14:52.052 --> 02:14:58.202
RUSSIAN BACKED SEPARATIST IN THE
EAST. UKRAINE IS A FRIEND AND 

02:14:58.442 --> 02:15:03.622
RUSSIA IS A FOE. THE UNITED 
STATES IS PROBABLY THE 

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:10.042
ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN 

02:15:13.172 --> 02:15:16.002
PUTIN AND UKRAINE BEING OVERRUN.
IT WOULD BE IN THE NATIONAL 

02:15:16.232 --> 02:15:18.492
SECURITY INTEREST OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND EVERY SINGLE FACT 

02:15:18.851 --> 02:15:25.282
WITNESS BEFORE THIS CONGRESS 
SAID SO. YOU CAN'T EVEN DISPUTE 

02:15:25.522 --> 02:15:32.532
THAT. WE ALLOCATED ON A 
BIPARTISAN BASIS. THEN THE AID 

02:15:32.892 --> 02:15:35.692
WAS WITHHELD. FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND THEY DESERVE TO 

02:15:35.922 --> 02:15:38.852
FIGURE OUT WHY. IN FEBRUARY, 
THERE WAS A LETTER SAYING OKAY, 

02:15:40.041 --> 02:15:49.772
THE AID IS ON THE WAY. IT NEVER 
ARRIVED. IN APRIL HE HAD A 

02:15:51.372 --> 02:15:53.702
PHONE CALL TO PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY. THE WORD CORRUPTION 

02:15:55.082 --> 02:15:59.202
WAS NOT MENTIONED ONCE. THEN IN 
MAY, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 

02:16:01.072 --> 02:16:04.942
WROTE TO THIS CONGRESS. AND SAID
ALL NECESSARY PRECONDITIONS WAS 

02:16:05.182 --> 02:16:12.187
A RECEIPT OF THE AID HAVE BEEN 
MET BY THE NEW UKRAINIAN 

02:16:13.312 --> 02:16:15.312
GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTI 

02:16:15.622 --> 02:16:19.472
CORRUPTION PROTOCOLS. WE HAVE 
THAT LETTER. IT WAS SENT TO YOU 

02:16:19.702 --> 02:16:25.761
AND US. THEN IN JULY ON THE 18th
AT AN OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND 

02:16:26.002 --> 02:16:30.421
BUDGET MEETING, THE AID WAS 
OFFICIALLY FROZEN AT THE 

02:16:30.812 --> 02:16:36.432
DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT. 
TWICE DURING THE SUMMER, MITCH 

02:16:37.171 --> 02:16:41.382
MCCONNELL, THE SENATE REPUBLICAN
MAJORITY LEADER CALLED THE TRUMP

02:16:41.812 --> 02:16:47.622
ADMINISTRATION, WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE AID? MITCH MCCONNELL 

02:16:49.411 --> 02:16:53.832
COULDN'T GET A GOOD ANSWER. THEN
ON JULY 25th THERE WAS ANOTHER 

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:58.822
CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. THE WORD 

02:16:59.091 --> 02:17:05.481
CORRUPTION IS NOT MENTIONED 
ONCE. HERE'S WHAT WAS SAID. 

02:17:05.722 --> 02:17:08.812
ZELENSKY TALKS ABOUT DEFENSE. 
THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS DO US

02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:13.651
A 

02:17:15.671 --> 02:17:17.671
FAVOR 

02:17:18.812 --> 02:17:24.991
THOUGH. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
I NEED YOU TO LOOK INTO SOME 

02:17:25.816 --> 02:17:29.562
THINGS. RELATED TO A WILD 
CONSPIRACY THEORY RELATED TO THE

02:17:29.821 --> 02:17:35.632
2016 CAMPAIGN AND ALSO SAYS I 
WANT YOU TO LOOK INTO JOE BIDEN.

02:17:35.862 --> 02:17:42.705
THEN WHAT'S INTERESTING IF YOU 
THINK IT WAS SUCH A PERFECT 

02:17:43.522 --> 02:17:47.161
CALL, HE MENTIONS RUDOLPH 
GIULIANI. NOT ONCE, TWICE BUT 

02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:54.871
THREE TIMES. WHY ON AN OFFICIAL 
CALL WOULD THE PRESIDENT MENTION

02:17:55.611 --> 02:17:59.071
RUDOLPH GIULIANI? HE'S NOT AN 
AMBASSADOR, HE'S NOT A DIPLOMAT,

02:17:59.921 --> 02:18:02.751
HE'S PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLITICAL
ENFORCER. THEN WHAT HAPPENS? YOU

02:18:02.992 --> 02:18:06.992
SAID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE 
FACTS. IN AUGUST, GIULIANI 

02:18:07.352 --> 02:18:12.081
TRAVELS TO MADRID AND MEETS WITH
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT AS A 

02:18:12.351 --> 02:18:16.621
FOLLOW UP TO TRUMP SAYING 
UKRAINE, GO MEET WITH GIULIANI. 

02:18:16.851 --> 02:18:23.801
THEN A STATEMENT IS DRAFTED 
ABOUT THE PHONY INVESTIGATION 

02:18:24.061 --> 02:18:29.212
AND SENT TO THE UKRAINIANS. WHAT
HAPPENS? IN AUGUST, THE WHISTLE 

02:18:29.451 --> 02:18:32.661
BLOWER COMPLAINT IS FILED. 
SEPTEMBER 9th, THE WHISTLE 

02:18:32.892 --> 02:18:36.791
BLOWER COMPLAINT IS MADE PUBLIC 
TO CONGRESS. TWO DAYS LATER ON  

02:18:37.031 --> 02:18:41.792
SEPTEMBER 11th, ALL THE SUDDEN 
THE AID IS RELEASED. WHY WAS THE

02:18:42.051 --> 02:18:47.741
AID RELEASED? BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT WAS CAUGHT RED HANDED.

02:18:47.981 --> 02:18:52.721
TRYING TO PRESSURE A FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT TO TARGET 

02:18:56.652 --> 02:19:02.710
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. I YIELD 
BACK. 

02:19:02.711 --> 02:19:05.221
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE? 
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE FIVE MEETINGS WE 

02:19:05.641 --> 02:19:11.601
DETAILED THAT SHOWED WHY THE AID
WAS RELEASED. THERE WAS BELIEF 

02:19:11.886 --> 02:19:14.931
ON THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVING 
UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST 

02:19:15.171 --> 02:19:18.761
CORRUPT AND AFTER A NUMBER OF 
EVENTS WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT 

02:19:18.991 --> 02:19:24.310
FOR THE BIPARTISAN SENATE, THERE
WAS A RESOLUTION OF THAT AID BUT

02:19:24.542 --> 02:19:29.916
THIS DEBATE JUST LAPS A CERTAIN 
SINCERITY. I HEARD EARLIER MY 

02:19:30.161 --> 02:19:33.767
FRIEND SAY LIST OUT ALL THESE 
CRIMES. IF I'M WATCHING AT HOME 

02:19:34.001 --> 02:19:38.551
I'M THINKING WHERE ARE THEY IN 
THE IMPEACHMENT? THAT'S JUST A 

02:19:38.791 --> 02:19:43.632
DEMOCRAT DRIVE BY TO GO LIST 
CRIMES YOU DON'T 

02:19:47.651 --> 02:19:51.991
ALLEGE AND HAVE EVIDENCE FOR. 
THEY'RE AIMING CRIMES IN DEBATE 

02:19:52.601 --> 02:19:57.271
THEY DON'T HAVE IN THE 
IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTION. THEN I 

02:19:57.511 --> 02:20:03.821
HEAR MY FRIEND FROM NEW YORK 
BRING UP RUSSIA. THE IMPEACHMENT

02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:08.341
THEORIES PASSED AND FAILED. 
THEY'RE DEBATING ABOUT HOW ARE 

02:20:08.571 --> 02:20:10.941
YOU HERE? DEBATING ABOUT 
MILITARY AID AND JAVELINS 

02:20:11.411 --> 02:20:13.981
PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:20:18.021 --> 02:20:20.021
DELIVERED 

02:20:23.041 --> 02:20:29.681
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WITHHELD.
WHERE WAS THIS CONCERN ABOUT HOW

02:20:30.061 --> 02:20:35.001
TO MAKE THE UKRAINE GREAT AGAIN?
I THINK MR. JORDAN DREAMS OF 

02:20:35.391 --> 02:20:37.391
THEM IN HIS 

02:20:41.361 --> 02:20:45.641
SLEEP. BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
ZELENSKY 

02:20:49.661 --> 02:20:51.661
SAYS 

02:20:53.861 --> 02:20:56.301
THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. 
EVERYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR 

02:20:56.541 --> 02:21:00.301
THEM SAY TODAY CAN BE 
CATEGORIZED INTO THREE AREAS. 

02:21:00.541 --> 02:21:05.866
FIRST, IT'S STUFF PEOPLE 
PRESUMED AND HAD NO DIRECT 

02:21:06.622 --> 02:21:09.111
EVIDENCE OF AND SECOND IT'S 
HEARSAY, SOMEBODY TOLD SOMEBODY 

02:21:09.351 --> 02:21:13.251
AND TOLD SOMEBODY ELSE THAT 
CREATED SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE 

02:21:13.482 --> 02:21:17.251
PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT OR IT IS 
REFLECTIVE OF A SINCERE POLICY 

02:21:17.491 --> 02:21:20.091
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT HOW TO 

02:21:24.101 --> 02:21:26.101
MAKE 

02:21:28.541 --> 02:21:31.201
THE UKRAINE GREAT AGAIN. THEY 
BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO DO 

02:21:31.431 --> 02:21:35.891
EVERYTHING FOR THE UKRAINE. I 
THINK MOST AMERICANS KNOW THAT 

02:21:36.131 --> 02:21:40.651
YOU CANNOT HAVE A SHAKE DOWN IF 
THE PERSON BEING SHOOK DOWN 

02:21:40.891 --> 02:21:43.811
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE SHAKE 
DOWN. PRESIDENT SAYING HIMSELF I

02:21:44.041 --> 02:21:47.786
FELT NO PRESSURE AND THEN TALK 
ABOUT BAD TIMING. WE GOT THIS 

02:21:48.781 --> 02:21:52.691
TIME ARTICLE THAT COMES OUT ON 
THE 10th OF 

02:21:56.701 --> 02:22:04.501
DECEMBER. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. 
THERE'S ANOTHER GUY. HE KNEW 

02:22:04.731 --> 02:22:08.421
THERE WAS PRESSURE. THE SAME DAY
THEY INTRODUCED THEIR ARTICLES 

02:22:09.161 --> 02:22:13.251
OF IMPEACHMENT, HE GIVES AN 
INTERVIEW AND SAYS I QUOTE 

02:22:13.481 --> 02:22:18.011
GORDON AND I WERE NEVER ALONE 
TOGETHER. WE BUMPED INTO EACH 

02:22:18.391 --> 02:22:21.171
OTHER INTO THE HALLWAY. I 
REMEMBER EVERYTHING. IT'S FINE 

02:22:21.411 --> 02:22:24.311
WITH MY MEMORY. WE TALKED ABOUT 
HOW WELL THE MEETING WENT. THAT 

02:22:24.561 --> 02:22:27.981
IS ALL WE TALKED ABOUT. HERE 
THEY ARE WITH NO CRIME, NO 

02:22:28.991 --> 02:22:31.671
VICTIM, WITH NO WITNESSES AND NO
KNOWLEDGE OF ANY SHAKE 

02:22:36.081 --> 02:22:38.081
DOWN AND YET THEY 

02:22:41.701 --> 02:22:47.801
PROCEED. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE WHEN
THEY'RE LYING TO US. THEY'RE SO 

02:22:48.035 --> 02:22:50.761
WEAK AND SO DEPENDENT ON THE 
UNITED STATES WE CAN'T BELIEVE A

02:22:50.991 --> 02:22:55.491
WORD THEY SAY. AGAIN, WHERE WERE
YOU DURING THE OBAMA 

02:22:55.732 --> 02:22:59.996
ADMINISTRATION WHEN THIS WEAK 
ALLIE DIDN'T GET JAVELINS THEN 

02:23:00.671 --> 02:23:03.911
WITHHELD. I SUPPORT THE JORDAN 
AMENDMENT. THIS ARTICLE ONE, 

02:23:04.331 --> 02:23:08.371
THIS ABUSIVE POWER THEY ALLEGED 
IN THE IMPEACHMENT THEORY IS A 

02:23:08.681 --> 02:23:12.121
TOTAL JOKE. THEY HAVE TO SAY 
ABUSIVE POWER BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:23:17.141 --> 02:23:20.191
HAVE EVIDENCE FOR ABINSTRUCTION.
THEY OBSTRUCTION. ALL THOSE 

02:23:20.421 --> 02:23:22.421
SPECIFIC CRIMES THAT THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA NAMED 

02:23:22.461 --> 02:23:28.531
CANNOT BE SUPPORTED BY THE 
EVIDENCE. THIS IS SORT OF THE 

02:23:28.901 --> 02:23:33.091
INKBLOT TEST OF THE IMPEACHMENT 
SO THAT THE COUNTRY CAN STARE 

02:23:33.321 --> 02:23:36.911
AND EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHAT THEY 
WANT TO SEE. THIS NOTION OF 

02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:41.676
ABUSIVE POWER. JUST THE LOWEST 
OF LOW ENERGY IMPEACHMENT 

02:23:41.911 --> 02:23:44.041
THEORIES. HECK, I DON'T KNOW ANY
POLITICAL PARTY THAT DOESN'T 

02:23:44.271 --> 02:23:49.301
THINK WHEN THE OTHER SIDE IS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE THEY ABUSE 

02:23:52.641 --> 02:23:56.781
POWER OR DO TOO MUCH. WE DIDN'T 
DO THIS TO THE COUNTRY AND PUT 

02:23:57.242 --> 02:24:01.511
THEM THROUGH THE NONSENSE. YOU 
SET THE STANDARD. YOU SET IT UP 

02:24:02.576 --> 02:24:04.576
TO BE BIPARTISAN AND 
OVERWHELMING. IT AIN'T 

02:24:07.086 --> 02:24:09.086
THAT AND 

02:24:11.241 --> 02:24:13.241
I 

02:24:16.246 --> 02:24:18.246
LOOKS BAD. I YIELD BACK.

02:24:26.611 --> 02:24:32.071
&gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT ARGUE THINGS BOTH 
WAYS. YOU CAN'T SAY THE 

02:24:32.921 --> 02:24:36.311
PRESIDENT WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT
UKRAINE HE RELEASED AID. HE 

02:24:36.541 --> 02:24:41.311
RELEASED AID IN 2017, HE 
RELEASED AID IN 2018 AND THEN 

02:24:41.551 --> 02:24:43.551
SUDDENLY BECAME CONCERNED IN 
2019 AFTER VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 

02:24:43.701 --> 02:24:49.361
ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO RUN. 
IF YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT HE WAS 

02:24:49.591 --> 02:24:54.761
SO CONCERNED ABOUT UKRAINE THAT 
HE RELEASED AID IN 2017 AND 2018

02:24:55.011 --> 02:24:59.921
THEN WHY IN 2019 AFTER THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CLEARED 

02:25:00.161 --> 02:25:02.641
UKRAINE ON CHARGES OF 
CORRUPTION, WHY THEN DID HE 

02:25:03.051 --> 02:25:07.331
DECIDE HE WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT
CORRUPTION THAT HE WAS NOT GOING

02:25:07.561 --> 02:25:13.551
TO RELEASE AID? THAT MAKES, I'M 
SORRY, I'M NOT YIELDING. I'M NOT

02:25:13.781 --> 02:25:15.781
YIELDING. 
&gt;&gt; THEY GOT A NEW PRESIDENT, 

02:25:16.621 --> 02:25:18.621
THAT'S WHY. 
&gt;&gt; THE YOUNG LADY HAS THE TIME 

02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:24.581
AND THE COMMITTEE WILL BE IN 
ORDER AND THE COMMITTEE WILL NOT

02:25:25.086 --> 02:25:27.086
INTERRUPT. CONTINUE. 
&gt;&gt; THEY GOT A NEW PRESIDENT WHO 

02:25:27.571 --> 02:25:30.991
WAS KNOWN TO BE AN ANTI 
CORRUPTION FIGHTER. THAT 

02:25:31.221 --> 02:25:34.751
ARGUMENT HAS NO WEIGHT 
WHATSOEVER. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO 

02:25:34.991 --> 02:25:39.560
ARGUE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SO 
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION AT 

02:25:39.791 --> 02:25:44.571
THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT, YOU HAVE
TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE RECORD OF 

02:25:45.252 --> 02:25:49.001
U.S. POLICY AND OUR AGREEMENT 
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 

02:25:49.361 --> 02:25:52.541
WOULD LOOK UNDER CERTAIN 
CONDITIONS BEFORE THEY RELEASED 

02:25:52.781 --> 02:25:56.891
MILITARY AID TO DETERMINE 
WHETHER OR NOT A COUNTRY HAS 

02:25:57.121 --> 02:25:59.501
SATISFIED THOSE REQUIREMENTS 
AROUND CORRUPTION AND THE 

02:26:00.001 --> 02:26:02.001
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE RELEASED 

02:26:04.974 --> 02:26:07.111
THAT REPORT. NOWHERE BETWEEN THE
TIME DONALD TRUMP WITHHELD AID 

02:26:07.351 --> 02:26:11.035
AND THE TIME HE RELEASED THE AID
WAS THERE AN ADDITIONAL 

02:26:11.991 --> 02:26:14.591
ASSESSMENT REQUIRED OR DONE. IN 
FACT, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 

02:26:14.831 --> 02:26:17.421
SIDED THEY DIDN'T NEED TO DO 
ANOTHER ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THEY 

02:26:17.851 --> 02:26:20.151
HAVE ALREADY DONE THE 
ASSESSMENT. AT THE END OF THE 

02:26:20.391 --> 02:26:23.531
DAY I HAVE ONLY TWO QUESTIONS 
FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 

02:26:26.331 --> 02:26:29.491
SIDE. THESE ARE THE TWO 
QUESTIONS. FORGET ABOUT 

02:26:30.851 --> 02:26:33.591
PRESIDENT TRUMP. FORGET ABOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. WILL ANY ONE OF

02:26:34.471 --> 02:26:41.295
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
SAY THAT IT IS AN ABUSE OF POWER

02:26:41.971 --> 02:26:50.051
TO CONDITION AID, TO CONDITION 
AID ON OFFICIAL ACT? FORGET 

02:26:50.290 --> 02:26:56.911
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP. IS ANY 
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILLING TO 

02:26:57.140 --> 02:27:02.166
SAY THAT IT IS EVER OKAY FOR A 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

02:27:03.521 --> 02:27:06.731
OF AMERICA TO INVITE FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS? 

02:27:06.971 --> 02:27:11.410
NOT A SINGLE ONE OF YOU HAS SAID
THAT SO FAR. 

02:27:11.411 --> 02:27:14.270
&gt;&gt; I'LL SAY. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM 

02:27:14.511 --> 02:27:16.511
TEXAS. 
&gt;&gt; WILL YOU YIELD SO WE CAN 

02:27:16.561 --> 02:27:18.821
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER THE 

02:27:19.051 --> 02:27:21.871
QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO BREAK THIS DOWN. 

02:27:22.111 --> 02:27:25.757
&gt;&gt; SHE HAS THE TIME. 
&gt;&gt; SHE ASKED US. 

02:27:25.758 --> 02:27:29.021
&gt;&gt; MEMBERS YOU KNOW PERFECTLY 
WELL IT IS OUT OF ORDER TO 

02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:32.979
INTERRUPT MEMBERS WHO HAVE THE 
TIME. 

02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:34.980
&gt;&gt; UNLESS 

02:27:37.681 --> 02:27:41.431
THEY ASK YOU.. 
&gt;&gt; DID SHE YIELD IT TO WHOM? SHE

02:27:41.675 --> 02:27:45.761
NOW HAS THE TIME. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. THANK 

02:27:46.001 --> 02:27:48.970
YOU REPRESENTATIVE. I WANT TO 
BREAK THIS DOWN IN SIMPLE TERMS 

02:27:49.211 --> 02:27:53.441
FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC BECAUSE 
OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ARE 

02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:56.590
WORKING OVERTIME TO TRY TO 
CONVINCE US THAT WE DIDN'T SEE 

02:27:56.831 --> 02:28:00.311
WHAT WE SAW WITH OUR OWN EYES 
AND WE DIDN'T HEAR WHAT WE HEARD

02:28:00.706 --> 02:28:05.051
WITH OUR OWN EARS. LET'S BRING 
IT DOWN TO AN EXAMPLE USED 

02:28:05.715 --> 02:28:08.551
DURING THE HEARING. IF A 
GOVERNOR, IF A COMMUNITY SUFFERS

02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:12.731
A NATURAL DISASTER AND THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE HAS AID 

02:28:14.836 --> 02:28:19.741
THAT WILL HELP THAT COMMUNITY, 
BUT CALLS THE MAYOR OF YOUR 

02:28:19.971 --> 02:28:25.150
COMMUNITY AND SAYS I WANT YOU TO
DO ME A FAVOR THOUGH AND 

02:28:25.381 --> 02:28:30.045
CONDITION WITH GIVING THE AID TO
THE COMMUNITY ON THE POLICE 

02:28:30.411 --> 02:28:33.591
CHIEF SMEARING HIS POLITICAL 
OPPONENT HAS THERE BEEN A CRIME?

02:28:33.821 --> 02:28:39.171
THE ANSWER IS YES. THAT GOVERNOR
WOULD GO TO JAIL. IF THAT 

02:28:39.401 --> 02:28:43.120
GOVERNOR LATER RELEASES THE AID 
AFTER HE GOT CAUGHT, IT DOESN'T 

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:47.451
MATTER. HE STILL COMMITTED THE 
CRIME. FURTHER MORE, IF THAT 

02:28:47.831 --> 02:28:51.641
GOVERNOR SAYS DURING THE 
INVESTIGATION 

02:28:54.705 --> 02:28:58.481
I'M GOING TO FIGHT THE 
SUBPOENAS, GUESS WHAT HAPPENED 

02:28:58.721 --> 02:29:01.570
TO THE GOVERNOR? HE COMMITTED A 
CRIME. HE WOULD GO TO JAIL. IF 

02:29:01.931 --> 02:29:06.710
THE GOVERNOR THEN TRIED TO COVER
UP HIS WRONG DOING, COVER IT UP 

02:29:06.951 --> 02:29:11.900
SO THAT HIS PEOPLE, HIS 
CONSTITUENTS COULDN'T SEE HIS 

02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:15.861
WRONG DOING, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
TO THE GOVERNOR? DID HE COMMIT A

02:29:16.090 --> 02:29:20.130
CRIME? YES, HE WOULD GO TO JAIL.
AS WILDLY AS THEY'RE TRYING TO 

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:23.700
CONVINCE YOU THERE WAS NO WRONG 
DOING, I WANT THE AMERICAN 

02:29:23.930 --> 02:29:27.461
PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
GOING ON HERE. IT'S CLEAR AS 

02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:32.450
DAY. WE'VE SEEN IT WITH OUR OWN 
EYES. WE'VE HEARD IT WITH OUR 

02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:34.820
OWN 

02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:38.860
EARS. FACTS MATTER. I YIELD 
BACK. [CAPTIONERS TRANSITIONING]

02:30:23.206 --> 02:30:25.206
RECORD WILL BE INTRODUCED.

02:30:29.694 --> 02:30:31.898
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

02:30:31.899 --> 02:30:36.813
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. THANK
YOU FOR COMING BACK. I WANT TO 

02:30:37.213 --> 02:30:41.418
ADDRESS COMMENTS THERE ARE 
DEFINITELY CRIMES IN THIS 

02:30:41.564 --> 02:30:46.554
SITUATION. FIRST OF ALL, DURING 
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, HE 

02:30:47.319 --> 02:30:49.319
WENT ON

02:30:51.636 --> 02:30:53.668
NATIONAL TV AND SAID SOMETHING 
TO THE EFFECT THAT AN INDICTMENT

02:30:53.866 --> 02:30:57.738
IS COMING. HE KNEW IT. I KNOW 
THAT MR. SMALL WELL WAS A 

02:30:57.937 --> 02:31:04.026
PROSECUTOR AND NOS  CRIMES  AND 
HE NOS   NOT TO BRING A CHARGE 

02:31:04.226 --> 02:31:06.615
OR A CRIME UNLESS THERE IS A 
REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF 

02:31:06.766 --> 02:31:12.763
CONVICTION. I WOULD DIRECT HIM 
TO THE ELEMENTS OF BRIBERY. WHO 

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:19.870
EVER BEING A PUBLIC OFFICIAL FOR
BEING INFLUENCED IN THE 

02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:23.477
PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICIAL ACT. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S 

02:31:23.626 --> 02:31:29.824
CRIMINAL INTEGRITY DEPARTMENT 
WITH SOMETHING AS NAPI LIST AS 

02:31:30.573 --> 02:31:35.547
AN INVESTIGATION IS NOT OF 
CONCRETE VALUE. AND A CON 

02:31:36.272 --> 02:31:40.336
INSTITUTE'S SOMETHING OF VALUE 
UNDER THIS STATUTE. ALSO THE 

02:31:40.489 --> 02:31:42.772
OTHER ELEMENT.

02:31:56.841 --> 02:31:58.875
IF THERE ARE CRIMES, WE SHOULD 
BE BRINGING IN EXPERTS AND 

02:31:59.077 --> 02:32:02.071
TESTIMONY AND IF THERE IS A 
CRIME, IT IS MORE FAIR TO CHARGE

02:32:02.217 --> 02:32:06.478
-- TO PASS ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT ON A PRESIDENT

02:32:10.247 --> 02:32:14.871
DEFENDING AGAINST SPECIFIC 
ELEMENTS AS OPPOSED TO ABUSE OF 

02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:23.242
POWER. MR. SWALWELL , THE ACT 
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT UNDER THE 

02:32:23.659 --> 02:32:26.493
McCONNELL DECISION IN THE 
SUPREME COURT, THAT DECISION 

02:32:27.242 --> 02:32:32.701
SAYS THAT SETTING UP A 
ORGANIZING EVENT DOES NOT SET UP

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:37.675
THE DEFINITION OF AN OFFICIAL 
ACT. THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS 

02:32:37.877 --> 02:32:40.335
MISSING IN YOUR ANALYSIS BUT 
THAT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME 

02:32:40.511 --> 02:32:43.560
BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ELEMENTS 
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL FOUND  

02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:49.862
IN THIS SITUATION. I THINK IT IS
UNFORTUNATE WHEN THE GENTLEMAN 

02:32:50.063 --> 02:32:54.281
FROM RHODE ISLAND TALKS ABOUT 
THE PRESIDENT SENDING MR. 

02:32:54.428 --> 02:33:01.839
GIULIANI TO THE UKRAINE TO SMEAR
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. LET'S TALK

02:33:02.039 --> 02:33:07.121
ABOUT WHAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 
DID. HIS SON SAT ON A BOARD AND 

02:33:07.323 --> 02:33:09.323
MADE AN A RED JUST AMOUNT OF 
MONEY

02:33:16.673 --> 02:33:18.673
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD NO 
BACKGROUND IN ENERGY OR NO 

02:33:18.706 --> 02:33:20.706
BACKGROUND IN UKRAINE WHILE HIS 
FATHER WAS VICE PRESIDENT. IF 

02:33:20.726 --> 02:33:22.963
THAT IS NOT A FAIR TOPIC FOR 
DISCUSSION IN THE WORLD OF 

02:33:23.163 --> 02:33:27.234
POLITICS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. 
IT'S MARRYING IS TRYING TO 

02:33:27.434 --> 02:33:31.501
CONJURE UP FALSE INFORMATION OR 
MAKING A FAKE ARGUMENT BASED ON 

02:33:32.261 --> 02:33:34.261
FALSE INFORMATION

02:33:35.766 --> 02:33:37.800
. THIS IS NOT SMEARING, THIS IS 
SEEKING THE TRUTH ABOUT 

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.037
CORRUPTION. NOT A SINGLE MEMBER 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

02:33:41.252 --> 02:33:46.281
HAS BEEN WILLING TO CONDEMN THE 
CONDUCT OF THE FORMER VICE 

02:33:46.427 --> 02:33:48.427
PRESIDENT

02:33:50.386 --> 02:33:52.821
. HOW FRUSTRATING IT MUST BE TO 
BE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HAVE YOUR

02:33:53.034 --> 02:33:55.469
SON SPEND OVER $1 MILLION ON 
ATTORNEYS FEES WHEN THE SPECIAL 

02:33:55.668 --> 02:33:57.795
COUNCIL IS INVESTIGATING  
SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED

02:34:01.153 --> 02:34:03.186
. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AND 
THERE WAS NO CONSPIRACY BETWEEN 

02:34:03.387 --> 02:34:09.420
RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
BUT, THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF 

02:34:09.567 --> 02:34:12.628
WRONGDOING BETWEEN HUNTER BIDEN

02:34:15.786 --> 02:34:20.443
, THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, JOE
BIDEN. 

02:34:20.444 --> 02:34:22.487
&gt;&gt; WITH ALL GENTLEMAN YIELD? 
&gt;&gt; NO, I WILL NOT. AND THE 

02:34:22.689 --> 02:34:25.882
UKRAINE AND THE CORPORATION.

02:34:30.002 --> 02:34:32.638
SO THE IDEA THERE WAS A SMEAR 
GOING ON, LET'S LOOK AT THE 

02:34:32.839 --> 02:34:34.950
FACTS. I WILL YIELD TO MY FRIEND
FROM ARIZONA

02:34:38.528 --> 02:34:39.742
. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LET'S 

02:34:39.743 --> 02:34:42.994
TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN 
2017 AND 20 18 AND IN 2019 THERE

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:49.907
WAS A PAUSE PUT ON IT. AND 
BENCHMARKS WERE PUT UNDER THE 

02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:53.508
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
TESTIFIED IN THIS COMMITTEE. WE 

02:34:53.654 --> 02:34:57.366
KNOW THAT SEVERAL PREVIOUS 
CORRUPT ADMINISTRATORS AND 

02:34:57.509 --> 02:35:02.029
CABINET OFFICIALS INCLUDING SOME
OLIGARCHS HAVE RELATIONSHIPS

02:35:05.134 --> 02:35:09.338
. THERE WAS CONCERN OVER WAS THE
REAL DEAL. THE PAUSE WAS UNKNOWN

02:35:09.482 --> 02:35:12.545
AND THEY MET WITH

02:35:18.137 --> 02:35:22.808
HIM TO DETERMINE HE WAS THE REAL
DEAL. ONCE TWO NEW 

02:35:23.757 --> 02:35:29.511
ANTICORRUPTION MEASURES WERE 
DONE IN TWO DAYS, THAT'S WHAT 

02:35:29.926 --> 02:35:31.926
CHANGED. YIELD BACK.

02:35:34.595 --> 02:35:37.374
&gt;&gt; FOR PURPOSES, THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM CALIFORNIA? 

02:35:37.375 --> 02:35:44.131
&gt;&gt; THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST
FOR A NOVEMBER 15, 2019 ARTICLE.

02:35:44.348 --> 02:35:48.558
ALL OF ROBERT MUELLER'S 
INDICTMENTS IN HIS LENGTHY 

02:35:48.708 --> 02:35:52.008
INVESTIGATION. 
&gt;&gt; I OBJECT. 

02:35:52.009 --> 02:35:56.928
&gt;&gt; I OBJECT, I WANT TO SEE IT. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN RESERVES A 

02:35:57.342 --> 02:35:59.673
OBJECTION AND WANTS TO SEE IT 
AND THAT IS FAIR.

02:35:59.674 --> 02:36:06.829
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU SEEK 
RESIGNATION TIERS I MOVED TO 

02:36:06.982 --> 02:36:13.324
STRIKE. I YIELD TO MY FRIEND AND
COLLEAGUE FROM FLORIDA. 

02:36:13.325 --> 02:36:17.659
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE GENTLEMAN FOR 
YIELDING. I NEED TO COME BACK TO

02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:23.343
THIS INTERVIEW BECAUSE IT'S LIKE
THE TREE IN THE FOREST THAT FELL

02:36:23.543 --> 02:36:25.914
AND NOBODY HEARD AND IT 
DEMOLISHES THE CASE. THEY HAVE 

02:36:26.074 --> 02:36:29.942
NO EVIDENCE THAT UKRAINIANS EVER
KNEW THIS AID WAS WITHHELD

02:36:33.296 --> 02:36:35.296
. THEY ARE LITERALLY TRYING TO 
PROSECUTE AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST

02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:37.900
THE PRESIDENT FOR A SHAKE DOWN 
WHEN THE ALLEGED PEOPLE BEING 

02:36:38.047 --> 02:36:43.038
SHOOK DOWN FELT NO PRESSURE AND 
NUMBER TWO DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT 

02:36:43.252 --> 02:36:49.137
WAS HAPPENING. TIME AND AGAIN, 
YOU HEARD THEM IN DEBATE AND THE

02:36:49.337 --> 02:36:51.369
PRESS CONFERENCES AND THE WHOLE 
CIRCUS OF SHOWS GOING ON HERE. 

02:36:51.571 --> 02:36:55.436
WE HAVE THIS TESTIMONY FROM 
GORDON SONDLAND AND WE ALL 

02:36:56.202 --> 02:37:00.519
REMEMBER HIM. WANDERING HIS WAY 
TO AN ESCALATOR WITH THIS GUY 

02:37:00.719 --> 02:37:06.409
WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH AS A SECOND 
LANGUAGE. GORDON SAYS, MAYBE I 

02:37:06.612 --> 02:37:11.025
SAID SOMETHING TO HIM ABOUT THIS
. THAT WAS THE WHOLE DEAL FOR 

02:37:11.174 --> 02:37:15.244
THEM. AND THEN, YOU TALK ABOUT 
EMBARRASSING. THIS

02:37:21.036 --> 02:37:23.056
SAME DAY THAT THEY INTRODUCE THE
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT THAT WE 

02:37:23.269 --> 02:37:25.501
KNEW WHAT THEY WOULD INTRODUCE 
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, THE MOMENT

02:37:25.703 --> 02:37:29.869
THEY TOOK MAJORITY. SO, SHOW ME 
THE UKRAINIAN THAT WAS PRESSURED

02:37:30.172 --> 02:37:34.842
. SHOW ME THE UKRAINIAN THAT NEW
ANY OF THIS WAS TIED TO ANY 

02:37:35.041 --> 02:37:38.908
CONDITIONALITY. THERE IS NO 
CONDITIONALITY IN THE CALL AND 

02:37:39.109 --> 02:37:43.578
SO IT IS QUITE EASY TO ANSWER 
THE GENTLE LADY FROM 

02:37:44.327 --> 02:37:49.065
WASHINGTON'S QUESTION. THERE IS 
NO CONDITIONALITY. YOU CANNOT 

02:37:49.266 --> 02:37:52.918
PROVE IT AND YOU HAVE NO 
EVIDENCE OF IT. FRANKLY, EVEN 

02:37:53.678 --> 02:37:57.587
THE UKRAINIANS AND THEIR 
PURPORTED VICTIMS ARE COMING OUT

02:37:57.801 --> 02:37:59.801
IN THE PRESS

02:38:03.485 --> 02:38:05.517
THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE HAS
BEEN REJECTED. I YIELD TO THE 

02:38:05.718 --> 02:38:08.905
GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO.
&gt;&gt; PENNSYLVANIA. 

02:38:08.906 --> 02:38:12.768
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN
FROM PENNSYLVANIA. 

02:38:12.769 --> 02:38:16.225
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MY FRIEND FROM 
OHIO. 

02:38:16.226 --> 02:38:23.998
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YIELDING. 
ZELENSKY RAN ON THE  CORRUPTION 

02:38:24.196 --> 02:38:28.060
AND LET'S SEE IF HE IS THE REAL 
DEAL. WE TALK ABOUT FIVE 

02:38:28.262 --> 02:38:30.262
CRITICAL MEETINGS THAT TOOK 
PLACE

02:38:34.562 --> 02:38:36.795
. FIVE MEETINGS AND I THINK THE 
LAST IS MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE 

02:38:36.995 --> 02:38:39.038
YOU HAD A DEMOCRAT SENATOR AND A
REPUBLICAN SENATOR MEET WITH 

02:38:39.229 --> 02:38:43.498
PRESIDENTNINE . THEY KNEW THE 
AID HAD BEEN PAUSED AT THAT TIME

02:38:43.699 --> 02:38:48.782
AND THE ISSUE NEVER CAME UP. 
WHAT DID COME UP WAS THAT BOTH 

02:38:48.983 --> 02:38:53.452
CENTERS CAME BACK AND SAID THIS 
IS THE REAL DEAL AND WE ARE 

02:38:53.652 --> 02:38:57.306
SPENDING THE HARD EARNED TAX 
DOLLARS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

02:38:58.056 --> 02:39:03.092
TO UKRAINE. THAT IS WHAT 
HAPPENED ON THE FACTS ARE CLEAR.

02:39:05.236 --> 02:39:08.226
THE FACTS ARE ON THE PRESIDENT'S
SIDE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN ON HIS

02:39:08.372 --> 02:39:13.155
SIDE. THE DEMOCRATS KEEP SAYING 
TO GET THE CALL AND TO MAKE THE 

02:39:13.356 --> 02:39:18.642
MONEY, THERE HAD TO BE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT. DECEMBER 12, THERE

02:39:18.841 --> 02:39:21.361
IS YET TO BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
ABOUT ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION

02:39:25.342 --> 02:39:27.575
. IT NEVER HAPPENED BECAUSE IT 
NEVER NEEDED TO HAPPEN AND THAT 

02:39:27.777 --> 02:39:32.040
WASN'T THE POINT. THEY GOT THE 
PAUL CALL. THEY GOT THE MONEY 

02:39:32.791 --> 02:39:34.791
SEPTEMBER 11.

02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:39.970
&gt;&gt; THE OTHER THING I WANT TO 
POINT OUT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW 

02:39:40.171 --> 02:39:42.204
MANY TIMES I HAVE HEARD THIS 
WITH THE DEMOCRATS TALKING ABOUT

02:39:42.405 --> 02:39:45.253
THIS IN THE NOW FAMOUS CALL 
TRANSCRIPT WITH PRESIDENT 

02:39:46.014 --> 02:39:50.679
ZELENSKY . THE DEMOCRATS DON'T 
READ THE PLAIN LANGUAGE AND THE 

02:39:50.823 --> 02:39:55.003
STAR PROFESSOR WITNESS HERE LAST
WEEK TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING THE

02:39:55.765 --> 02:40:01.293
ROYAL WE. YOU TRY TO PORTRAY THE
SENTENCE AND SHE SAID, I WOULD 

02:40:01.493 --> 02:40:05.962
LIKE YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR, 
THOUGH. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS.

02:40:06.164 --> 02:40:10.645
IT HAS COME I WOULD LIKE YOU TO 
DO US A FAVOR. GUESS WHAT THE 

02:40:10.845 --> 02:40:18.359
NEXT TWO WORDS ARE? BECAUSE OUR 
COUNTRY, IT DOESN'T SAY I WOULD 

02:40:18.561 --> 02:40:21.504
LIKE YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. IT 
DOESN'T SAY THAT

02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:27.296
. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A 
FAVOR BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS 

02:40:27.495 --> 02:40:30.143
BEEN THROUGH A LOT. THAT IS THE 
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR. HECK

02:40:30.344 --> 02:40:32.344
YEAH, OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN 
THROUGH A LOT

02:40:35.415 --> 02:40:37.449
. THIS IS THE DAY AFTER BOB 
MUELLER SET THROUGH THIS 

02:40:37.650 --> 02:40:40.902
COMMITTEE AND WE LEARNED THERE 
WAS NOTHING THERE. FOR TWO YEARS

02:40:41.105 --> 02:40:43.137
OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN PUT THROUGH
TURMOIL BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS. 

02:40:43.338 --> 02:40:46.389
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
POINTING OUT. IN THE PARAGRAPH, 

02:40:46.591 --> 02:40:48.591
HE REFERENCES BOB MUELLER

02:40:55.324 --> 02:40:57.559
. HECK YEAH, OUR COUNTRY HAD 
BEEN THROUGH A LOT AND THE 

02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:59.795
PRESIDENT WAS PRETTY TICKED 
ABOUT IT AND WANTED TO FIND OUT 

02:40:59.996 --> 02:41:02.230
WHAT WAS GOING ON. THAT IS VERY 
LEGITIMATE AND WORKING ON BEHALF

02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:07.104
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS I 
SAID LAST NIGHT, 63 MILLION 

02:41:07.304 --> 02:41:09.541
PEOPLE VOTED FOR THIS GUY AND 
THAT'S WHY THE SPEAKER OF THE 

02:41:09.752 --> 02:41:11.752
HOUSE CALLED IT AN IMPOSTER.

02:41:19.503 --> 02:41:21.503
I YELLED BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 

02:41:21.681 --> 02:41:23.681
MR. JOHNSON. 
&gt;&gt;

02:41:26.404 --> 02:41:28.660
MR. DIRECTOR, A LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

02:41:28.805 --> 02:41:30.805
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO SLOW DOWN AND BUY 
ARTICLE.

02:41:34.937 --> 02:41:37.172
BOTH GENTLEMEN ARE ATTORNEYS AND
IN THIS CASE, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO

02:41:37.372 --> 02:41:39.372
BE FINDERS OF FACT. TO CAREFULLY
AND OBJECTIVELY ANALYZE THE 

02:41:39.402 --> 02:41:41.530
CLAIMS AGAINST THE RECORD. LET'S
DO THAT

02:41:44.887 --> 02:41:47.477
. THERE ARE TWO ARTICLES, ABUSE 
OF POWER AND OBSTRUCTION OF 

02:41:47.626 --> 02:41:50.929
JUSTICE. ON THE FIRST, DEMOCRATS
KNOW THERE IS ZERO DIRECT 

02:41:51.076 --> 02:41:55.251
EVIDENCE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. 
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP ENGAGED IN 

02:41:55.453 --> 02:41:59.718
ANY SCHEME OF ANY KIND AS IS IN 
THE RESOLUTION OR THAT HE 

02:42:00.118 --> 02:42:02.969
INFLUENCE THE 2020 ELECTION. NO 
INFLUENCE -- IMPEACHMENT SHOULD 

02:42:03.170 --> 02:42:08.654
PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF HEARSAY,
CONJECTURE AND SPECULATION THAT 

02:42:08.856 --> 02:42:11.091
WOULD NOT BE ADMISSIBLE IN THE 
LOCAL TRAFFIC COURT. WE SAY THAT

02:42:11.292 --> 02:42:16.321
OVER AND OVER. AND THERE IS 
SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE OF ANY 

02:42:16.466 --> 02:42:20.845
CONDITION. I GUESS I NEED TO 
REPEAT THE FOUR INDISPUTABLE 

02:42:21.045 --> 02:42:23.414
FACTS IN THIS RECORD. BECAUSE 
REPETITION IS REALLY NECESSARY 

02:42:23.563 --> 02:42:27.747
HERE. FIRST, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SAY NO  

02:42:27.948 --> 02:42:32.777
PRESSURE WAS EXERTED. THE CALL 
TRANSCRIPT SHOWS NO 

02:42:32.921 --> 02:42:37.293
CONDITIONALITY AND NUMBER THREE 
IS UKRAINE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE 

02:42:37.496 --> 02:42:40.705
AID, AS IT HAS BEEN SAID OVER 
AND OVER, THAT IT WAS NOT BEEN 

02:42:40.860 --> 02:42:45.212
DELAYED. THEY STILL RECEIVE THE 
AID AND THEY GOT THE MEETING. 

02:42:45.426 --> 02:42:47.245
OUR COLLEAGUES KEEP 
MISREPRESENTING THE FACTS. NOT 

02:42:47.246 --> 02:42:53.145
ONLY DO THEY MISREPRESENT THAT 
DO ME A FAVOR DO US A FAVOR BUT 

02:42:53.545 --> 02:42:55.582
THREE OF THE 17 WITNESSES 
LISTENED IN ON THE CALL THAT 

02:42:55.783 --> 02:43:00.051
WERE CALLED BY CHAIRMANSHIP. 
FROM WHAT WE HAVE HEARD THIS 

02:43:00.251 --> 02:43:02.251
MORNING, THEY DID NOT PROVIDE

02:43:05.672 --> 02:43:08.898
UNCONTROVERTED THEORIES. THEY 
CONTRADICTED EACH OTHER.

02:43:15.078 --> 02:43:16.909
AND THE OTHER SHOWS THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HOLDS A 

02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:18.728
DEEP-SEATED AND REASONABLE 
SKEPTICISM OF UKRAINE DUE TO ITS

02:43:18.729 --> 02:43:22.594
HISTORY OF PERVASIVE CORRUPTION.
AND THE NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT 

02:43:22.794 --> 02:43:28.490
IS A TRUE REPORTER -- REFORMER 
AND THE PRESIDENT FOUND OUT HE 

02:43:28.689 --> 02:43:33.358
IS A SWAMP TRAINER AND THE FUNDS
WERE RELEASED. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:37.572
WANTED TO ENSURE THE TAXPAYER 
ASSISTANCE WOULD NOT BE 

02:43:37.726 --> 02:43:41.076
SQUANDERED BY WHAT IS PURPORTED 
TO BE THE THIRD MOST CORRUPTION 

02:43:42.028 --> 02:43:48.995
LADEN COUNTRY IN THE WORLD PRIOR
TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY . THE 

02:43:49.195 --> 02:43:51.387
SECOND CLAIM OF THIS RESOLUTION 
IS THE PRESIDENT OBSTRUCTED 

02:43:51.535 --> 02:43:54.167
CONGRESS. BUT, HE SIMPLY DID

02:43:57.931 --> 02:44:01.276
WHAT EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS 
DONE. WHAT IS HIS

02:44:06.268 --> 02:44:08.088
BIG INFRACTION? HE HAS EXERTED 
POLITICAL IMMUNITY TO QUESTION 

02:44:08.089 --> 02:44:12.555
SUBPOENAS BY ISSUED TO VARIOUS 
WHITE HOUSE OF VISUALS. THERE IS

02:44:13.305 --> 02:44:17.180
NO EVIDENCE OF IMPEACHABLE 
CONDUCT AND THAT AND IT IS 

02:44:17.326 --> 02:44:21.504
COMMONPLACE. ON EVERY PREVIOUS 
ESTERS AND IN THE PAST, WHAT IS 

02:44:21.705 --> 02:44:25.555
BETWEEN THE BRANCHES HAS BEEN 
EASILY AND CALMLY RESOLVED 

02:44:25.768 --> 02:44:30.839
EITHER BY GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION
OR A SIMPLE FILING WITH THE 

02:44:31.038 --> 02:44:36.122
THIRD BRANCH OF OUR GOVERNMENT, 
THE JUDICIAL GOVERNMENT. 

02:44:36.324 --> 02:44:41.012
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LAWFUL CAUSE
TO CHALLENGE THE SUBPOENAS IN 

02:44:41.743 --> 02:44:45.465
THESE MATTERS. IN THIS CALLOUS 
THEY ARE TRYING TO SUBPOENA 

02:44:45.665 --> 02:44:49.129
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR SEEKING 
JUDICIAL REVIEW BETWEEN 

02:44:49.891 --> 02:44:55.617
HIGH-RANKING ADVISORS AND 
WHETHER IT SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. 

02:44:55.837 --> 02:44:58.265
THAT WOULD BE EXPEDITED IN THE 
COURTS AND WOULD NOT TAKE LONG. 

02:44:58.467 --> 02:45:02.320
DEMOCRATS DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR 
THAT. WHY? THEY PROMISED 

02:45:02.534 --> 02:45:06.385
IMPEACHMENT BY CHRISTMAS. IT 
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT 

02:45:06.586 --> 02:45:11.827
TRUMP HAS CONSISTENTLY 
QUESTIONED ABOUT THIS OVERSIGHT 

02:45:11.981 --> 02:45:16.338
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
ADMINISTRATIONS OFFICIALS WITH 

02:45:16.553 --> 02:45:18.553
20 BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

02:45:21.019 --> 02:45:23.254
. AT THE START OF THE INQUIRY, 
THE WHITE HOUSE PRODUCED MORE 

02:45:23.456 --> 02:45:25.456
THAN 100 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS

02:45:41.127 --> 02:45:44.175
&gt;&gt; THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SINGLE
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS LIKE THE ONE

02:45:44.378 --> 02:45:49.183
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY 
ARE SEEKING TO NULLIFY WITH A 

02:45:49.326 --> 02:45:52.388
SHAM. IT IS TO NOTIFY

02:45:56.762 --> 02:46:00.101
FOR DOUGH PROCESS AND ALL THE 
REST. MY COLLEAGUE

02:46:03.875 --> 02:46:05.875
EVOKED AND QUOTED BARBARA JORDAN
WHO SAID DURING THE WATERGATE 

02:46:06.446 --> 02:46:09.765
INQUIRY THAT IMPEACHMENT NOT 
ONLY MANDATES DUE PROCESS BUT 

02:46:09.963 --> 02:46:13.017
DUE PROCESS QUADRUPLED. THEY 
HAVE VIOLATED THAT HERE. THEY 

02:46:13.215 --> 02:46:15.759
HAVE VIOLATED THE RULES AND 
EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY CAN SEE.

02:46:17.285 --> 02:46:24.588
THE PRESS WILL PAY A HEAVY PRICE
FOR IT. THE PANDORA'S BOX WILL 

02:46:24.789 --> 02:46:27.839
DO IRREPARABLE INJURY TO OUR 
COUNTRY AHEAD. THAT'S MY CONCERN

02:46:28.052 --> 02:46:30.645
AND WHY THE FACTS MATTER. I 
YELLED BACK. 

02:46:30.646 --> 02:46:35.356
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I MOVE TO 

02:46:35.555 --> 02:46:38.958
STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; RECOGNIZED. 

02:46:38.959 --> 02:46:43.490
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, IT'S INCREDIBLE
TO ME THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

02:46:43.692 --> 02:46:47.703
AISLE DOES NOT SEE THE FACTS AND
IS APPARENTLY NOT

02:46:54.245 --> 02:46:56.692
AWARE OF WHAT IS BEFORE US. IT 
IS OBVIOUS TO ME THE PRESIDENT 

02:46:56.894 --> 02:46:58.925
HAS PUT PERSONAL INTEREST ABOVE 
THIS COUNTRY. WITH THAT, I WILL 

02:46:59.126 --> 02:47:03.793
YIELD BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM
MARYLAND.

02:47:03.794 --> 02:47:08.062
&gt;&gt; RHODE ISLAND. 
&gt;&gt; RHODE ISLAND.

02:47:08.063 --> 02:47:10.063
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE GENTLE LADY FOR 
YIELDING.

02:47:13.545 --> 02:47:18.862
WE HAVE JUST HEARD REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES CLAIM THERE IS NO 

02:47:19.012 --> 02:47:21.012
DEMAND OR CONDITIONALITY FOR 
THIS AID.

02:47:24.713 --> 02:47:26.547
IT WAS GENERATED BY THE 
PRESIDENT'S DEEP DESIRE TO 

02:47:26.548 --> 02:47:32.029
FERRET OUT CORRUPTION. THAT IS 
LAUGHABLE. THE PRESIDENT HAD TWO

02:47:32.231 --> 02:47:34.063
PHONE CALLS WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND NEVER ONCE UTTERED 

02:47:34.064 --> 02:47:36.218
THE WORD  CORRUPTION. IT WAS NOT
ABOUT CORRUPTION

02:47:40.149 --> 02:47:42.184
. THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS 
BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF 

02:47:42.384 --> 02:47:44.384
DEFENSE HAD ALREADY CERTIFIED 
THAT STEPS HAD BEEN TAKEN TO 

02:47:44.422 --> 02:47:46.609
COMBAT CORRUPTION BACK ON MAY 20
THIRD. DESPITE THAT 

02:47:46.798 --> 02:47:50.666
CERTIFICATION, THAT HOLD 
REMAINED IN PLACE. IN FACT, THE 

02:47:50.830 --> 02:47:55.394
PROFESSIONALS TESTIFIED ABOUT 
THEM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT

02:47:55.592 --> 02:47:59.860
IS POSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD AID. THE
CERTIFICATION SHOWS NO BASIS 

02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:04.126
OTHER THAN THE PRESIDENT ORDERED
IT. IT'S NOT ABOUT CORRUPTION. 

02:48:04.327 --> 02:48:08.879
IT WAS ABOUT EXTRACTING A 
COMMITMENT TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY.

02:48:17.121 --> 02:48:19.355
AN INVESTIGATION INTO MR. 
TRUMP'S CHIEF POLITICAL RIVAL,  

02:48:19.555 --> 02:48:25.196
MR. BIDEN . THE PRESIDENT 
SATISFIED HIMSELF AND THIS IS 

02:48:25.338 --> 02:48:31.953
NONSENSE. IT IS PORTRAYED BY ALL
EVIDENCE COLLECTED. LET ME 

02:48:32.154 --> 02:48:36.623
REMIND YOU OF IT BECAUSE YOU 
APPARENTLY DO NOT REMEMBER. MR. 

02:48:36.827 --> 02:48:41.652
SANS TESTIFIED UNDER OATH THAT 
IT WAS QUID PRO QUO FOR OUR 

02:48:41.796 --> 02:48:49.013
RAISING THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY . RUDY 

02:48:49.775 --> 02:48:53.307
GIULIANI DEMANDED A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT ANNOUNCING THE 

02:48:54.229 --> 02:48:56.229
INVESTIGATION OF THE

02:49:03.271 --> 02:49:05.654
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT. WE KNEW 
THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO THE 

02:49:05.797 --> 02:49:11.590
PRESIDENT. AND ON THE JULY 25 
CALL, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HIMSELF

02:49:11.792 --> 02:49:14.838
RECOGNIZED THE CONNECTION 
BETWEEN THE MEETING AND  

02:49:15.253 --> 02:49:17.688
INVESTIGATION. HE SAID, I ALSO 
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISIT

02:49:17.887 --> 02:49:23.372
TO THE UNITED STATES. WE WILL BE
SERIOUS ABOUT THE CASE AND WORK 

02:49:23.572 --> 02:49:26.167
ON THE INVESTIGATION. THE 
PRESIDENT SPOKE ON THE CALL 

02:49:26.312 --> 02:49:33.058
ABOUT THE BIDENS AND ABOUT 
BURISMA . ULTIMATELY ANNOUNCING 

02:49:33.216 --> 02:49:38.607
WITH NO EXPLANATION AND EVERYONE
IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 

02:49:39.008 --> 02:49:41.008
AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM 
RECOMMENDED RELEASE OF THE AID. 

02:49:41.602 --> 02:49:44.197
AN IMPORTANT ALLY OF THE UNITED 
STATES

02:49:49.372 --> 02:49:51.606
FACING A WAR WITH THE RUSSIANS 
THAT TOOK PART OF THEIR COUNTRY 

02:49:51.807 --> 02:49:53.807
AND THREATENING TO KILL PEOPLE 
IN EASTERN UKRAINE. THE MILITARY

02:49:53.843 --> 02:49:55.843
AID WAS A LIFELINE FOR THIS 
EMERGING DEMOCRACY. THE ONLY 

02:49:56.277 --> 02:49:59.261
PEOPLE WHO BENEFITED FROM THIS 
SCHEME WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:50:03.182 --> 02:50:05.415
AS WELL AS VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 
RUSSIA WHO WERE TRYING TO WEAKEN

02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:10.699
THE UKRAINIAN'S. THERE WAS A 
RECENT ARTICLE THAT CAPTURED 

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:15.715
THIS THAT SAID PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY IS FACING  PRESIDENT 

02:50:15.863 --> 02:50:22.640
PUTIN ALL ALONE. THIS IS RUSSIA 
WEAKENING UKRAINE BUT THIS 

02:50:22.789 --> 02:50:28.780
NOTION THAT THE AID WAS LISTED 
BECAUSE OF THE EVIDENCE 

02:50:28.981 --> 02:50:32.790
COLLECTED IN THE 300 PAGE REPORT
COLLECTED BY THE INTELLIGENCE 

02:50:32.938 --> 02:50:37.312
COMMITTEE. IT WAS RELEASED 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT GOT CAUGHT

02:50:37.512 --> 02:50:40.763
AND THE WHISTLEBLOWER FILED THE 
REPORT ALLEGING AN ELABORATE 

02:50:40.966 --> 02:50:45.653
SCHEME BY THE PRESIDENT THAT 
PORTRAYED AND BETRAYED THE 

02:50:45.845 --> 02:50:48.791
NATIONAL INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY
. THE PERSONAL INTERESTS OF THE

02:50:53.161 --> 02:50:55.161
PRESIDENT AND NOT THE NATIONAL 
INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY. AN 

02:50:55.193 --> 02:50:57.370
ATTEMPT TO CORRUPT OUR ELECTION 
BY DRAGGING AND FOREIGN 

02:50:57.521 --> 02:51:01.278
INTERFERENCE. IT IS THE HIGHEST 
OF HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.

02:51:01.477 --> 02:51:05.746
OUR FRAMERS SPOKE ABOUT THIS 
ABUSE OF POWER AND ABUSING THE 

02:51:05.947 --> 02:51:07.780
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY TO 
ADVANCE PERSONAL INTEREST AND 

02:51:07.781 --> 02:51:14.080
UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC. 
&gt;&gt; AND MY REMAINING 30 MINUTES. 

02:51:14.265 --> 02:51:18.090
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MR. RASKIN. 

02:51:18.091 --> 02:51:23.632
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MR. RASKIN. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO FLESH

02:51:23.832 --> 02:51:26.399
OUT THE DETAIL OF WHAT THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE ISLAND WAS 

02:51:26.547 --> 02:51:30.131
WAITING. ONE OF THE DEPOSITIONS 
WAS DAVID HOLMAN, A STATE 

02:51:30.337 --> 02:51:34.383
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL AT THE U.S. 
EMBASSY IN KYIV. HE TESTIFIED A 

02:51:34.597 --> 02:51:39.068
QUID PRO QUO . HE SAW HIM ON THE
PHONE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

02:51:39.267 --> 02:51:45.797
HE REPORTED AT THAT TIME TO HIM.
HE SAID, THE PRESIDENT DOES A 

02:51:45.971 --> 02:51:49.641
GIVE A BLANK ABOUT UKRAINE AND 
IS INTERESTED IN THE BIG STUFF. 

02:51:49.835 --> 02:51:54.599
WHAT IS THE BIG STUFF? WHATEVER 
WILL BENEFIT HIM. I YIELD BACK.

02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:02.719
&gt;&gt; RECOGNITION, THE GENTLEMAN IS
RECOGNIZED

02:52:05.876 --> 02:52:07.092
. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. LAST NIGHT AND 

02:52:07.093 --> 02:52:11.160
TODAY WE HAVE HEARD MANY TIMES 
FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 

02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:13.592
SIDE THAT SAY THE FACTS ON THIS 
ARE NOT CONTESTED, YET THEY 

02:52:14.358 --> 02:52:18.879
REALLY ARE. I JUST WANT TO POINT
OUT HIGHLIGHTED BY MY COLLEAGUE 

02:52:19.077 --> 02:52:23.960
FROM LOUISIANA A MOMENT AGO. ON 
THE TELEPHONE CALL, LISTENING, 

02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:26.190
OF THE 17 WITNESSES THAT CAME 
IN, ONLY THREE ACTUALLY LISTENED

02:52:26.391 --> 02:52:29.641
AND ON THE PHONE CALL. BUT EACH 
HAVE CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY. 

02:52:29.841 --> 02:52:31.841
SO, EVEN THE THREE

02:52:34.521 --> 02:52:39.792
WITNESSES THAT HEARD THE CALL 
ARE CONFLICTED. WHY IS THAT 

02:52:39.994 --> 02:52:42.445
IMPORTANT AND WHY DO I BRING 
THAT UP? I BRING IT UP BECAUSE 

02:52:43.204 --> 02:52:47.115
OF THIS. MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

02:52:47.515 --> 02:52:52.799
TAKE EVERY INFERENCE IN THE 
LIGHT MOST NEGATIVE TO THE 

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.691
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS 

02:52:55.850 --> 02:52:59.434
ANIMOSITY THERE MANIFESTED SINCE
2016, THE DAY AFTER HE WAS 

02:52:59.576 --> 02:53:07.215
ELECTED. SO, HAVING WATCHED THIS
PROCEDURE, MOSTLY ON THE HEELS 

02:53:07.428 --> 02:53:10.263
OF THE OTHER PROCEDURES AND THE 
ATTEMPTS TO IMPEACH THIS 

02:53:10.464 --> 02:53:13.408
PRESIDENT AND INVESTIGATE. I AM 
LEFT WONDERING

02:53:20.829 --> 02:53:22.864
. YOU WANT EVERY INFERENCE TO GO
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, WHY 

02:53:23.066 --> 02:53:24.885
SHOULD THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GIVE 
YOU ANY INFERENCE OF 

02:53:24.886 --> 02:53:26.886
CREDIBILITY? THE REALITY IS

02:53:29.768 --> 02:53:31.768
WHEN MY COLLEAGUE FROM 
CALIFORNIA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE

02:53:32.138 --> 02:53:34.138
RUSSIAN ISSUE

02:53:36.270 --> 02:53:38.270
, NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN WAS 
INDICTED FOR CONSPIRING WITH 

02:53:38.302 --> 02:53:40.302
RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 
ELECTIONS. NOT ONE. IF YOU STILL

02:53:40.334 --> 02:53:42.334
BELIEVE THERE WAS COLLUSION WITH
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

02:53:46.421 --> 02:53:49.214
BUT, WHAT ARE THE FACTS GET TO? 
WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST TALKED 

02:53:49.365 --> 02:53:54.338
ABOUT THAT THE MONEY WAS 
RELEASED, THE AID WAS RELEASED. 

02:53:54.552 --> 02:53:56.784
AGAIN, HE TAKES THIS INFERENCE 
BASED ON A TIMELINE AND HE IS 

02:53:57.544 --> 02:54:00.799
CITING FRANK HEARSAY.

02:54:04.503 --> 02:54:08.154
DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I OVERHEARD A 
CONVERSATION WHILE I WAS SITTING

02:54:08.355 --> 02:54:12.624
ON THE PATIO AT A RESTAURANT 
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING 

02:54:12.824 --> 02:54:15.272
AROUND AND I COULD HEAR 
EVERYTHING. I WAS SO CONCERNED 

02:54:15.471 --> 02:54:19.884
ABOUT IT THAT I DIDN'T TELL 
ANYBODY. I CAME IN ONCE THIS GOT

02:54:20.028 --> 02:54:27.043
REALLY GOING AND REVVED UP. YOU 
WANT TO TAKE EVERY INFERENCE 

02:54:27.248 --> 02:54:29.895
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, WHY 
SHOULD WE GIVE YOU CREDIBILITY? 

02:54:30.296 --> 02:54:32.531
THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE IN THIS
CASE REMAINS THE SAME AFTER ALL 

02:54:32.730 --> 02:54:42.483
OF THIS TIME. NO PRESSURE. NO 
PRESSURE ON THE PHONE CALL. MR. 

02:54:42.683 --> 02:54:46.346
ZELENSKY HAS SAID THAT 
REPEATEDLY . ALL DAY LONG HE HAS

02:54:46.546 --> 02:54:48.546
SAID NO PRESSURE.

02:54:52.438 --> 02:54:58.057
ARE THEY LYING? NO. WE KNOW THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER WAS LYING. WE KNOW

02:54:58.251 --> 02:55:00.251
THAT

02:55:02.323 --> 02:55:04.323
MR.

02:55:07.671 --> 02:55:12.955
SCHIFF WAS  LYING WHEN HE SAID 
EIGHT TIMES PRESSURE WAS PUT ON 

02:55:13.156 --> 02:55:19.253
THE UKRAINIANS. NOT TRUE. THERE 
WAS NO CONDITIONALITY AND 

02:55:19.455 --> 02:55:22.841
EVERYONE SAYS THERE IS NO 
CONDITIONALITY. EVERYONE 

02:55:22.988 --> 02:55:29.401
LISTENED. UKRAINE WAS UNAWARE, 
SO HOW CAN YOU LEVERAGE?

02:55:29.402 --> 02:55:32.653
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NEVER ANY 
INVESTIGATION. WHAT HAPPENED AND

02:55:32.854 --> 02:55:37.738
WHAT TRIGGERED IT. YOU HAVE HIGH
RANKING U.S. OFFICIALS GOING TO 

02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:43.423
YOUR CRANE AND MEETING WITH THEM
AND YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF 

02:55:43.623 --> 02:55:45.623
UKRAINE SIGNING TO PIECES OF

02:55:52.156 --> 02:55:53.738
LEGISLATION REASSIGNING THE 
TRIBUNAL AND ASSIGNING IMMUNITY 

02:55:53.739 --> 02:55:55.205
FROM PROSECUTION OF THE 
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF UKRAINE. 

02:55:55.206 --> 02:55:58.853
SIGNIFICANT ANTICORRUPTION 
MEASURES WERE THE OF CONVINCING 

02:55:59.267 --> 02:56:03.683
-- WERE THE --

02:56:12.057 --> 02:56:15.509
WORTHY OF CONVINCING THERE WAS A
CHANCE . I YIELD TO MY FRIEND 

02:56:16.123 --> 02:56:22.009
FROM COLORADO. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR SONDLAND IS YOUR  

02:56:22.426 --> 02:56:24.426
WITNESS. YOU ARE BASING 
IMPEACHMENT ON AMBASSADOR 

02:56:24.660 --> 02:56:26.660
SONDLAND'S TESTIMONY ?

02:56:32.579 --> 02:56:34.815
IN HIS FIRST TESTIMONY, HE SAID 
325 TIMES, I DON'T REMEMBER, I 

02:56:35.014 --> 02:56:38.671
DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT SURE. 325 
TIMES. YOU DON'T THINK THAT WHEN

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:43.344
THIS GETS TO THE SENATE THAT HE 
IS GOING TO BE IMPEACHED ON ALL 

02:56:43.545 --> 02:56:46.491
THE THINGS THAT HE DIDN'T 
REMEMBER? THEN, HIS TESTIMONY

02:56:51.066 --> 02:56:53.901
IS IMPEACHED AND NOT HIS OFFICE.
I SEE THE SMIRK. THEN HE READS 

02:56:54.317 --> 02:57:01.380
AND HE LISTENS TO WHAT I'M 
PASSENGER TALES IS THE DAY 

02:57:01.532 --> 02:57:08.535
AMBASSADOR -- ABBAS OR TAYLOR 
SAYS AND MEMORY IS REFRESHED. I 

02:57:09.296 --> 02:57:12.747
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. RADCLIFFE SEEKS 

02:57:12.898 --> 02:57:15.997
RECOGNITION. 
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 

02:57:16.146 --> 02:57:19.642
WORD. 
&gt;&gt; MOVED AND RECOGNIZED. 

02:57:19.643 --> 02:57:24.980
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I WANT TO RESPOND 
TO THE CONGRESSMAN'S COMMENTS 

02:57:25.194 --> 02:57:27.194
WHEN HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S

02:57:30.668 --> 02:57:32.498
DEMAND CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY 
CORRUPTION BECAUSE THE WORD 

02:57:32.499 --> 02:57:35.947
CORRUPTION IS NEVER ANSWERED 
ANYWHERE IN THE TRANSCRIPT. THE 

02:57:36.161 --> 02:57:40.426
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BUILT A FAKE 

02:57:41.029 --> 02:57:48.950
IMPEACHMENT SCHEME AROUND AN 
ALLEGED DEMAND. WHAT WORD IS NOT

02:57:49.152 --> 02:57:53.220
ANYWHERE IN THE TRANSCRIPT? IT 
IS DEMAND. NOWHERE DOES THE 

02:57:53.421 --> 02:57:57.230
PRESIDENT MAKE A DEMAND. THE 
WORD DEMAND CAME FROM THE 

02:57:57.384 --> 02:58:00.481
WHISTLEBLOWER AND THAT'S THE 
FIRST TIME WE HEARD THE WORD 

02:58:00.633 --> 02:58:03.575
DEMAND. HE NOTIFIED THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE 

02:58:04.322 --> 02:58:09.672
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. HE 
THOUGHT HE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE

02:58:09.872 --> 02:58:15.156
NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE 
BECAUSE WHAT PRESIDENT WOULD 

02:58:15.357 --> 02:58:17.357
TAKE THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF 
RELEASING A TRANSCRIPT WITH A 

02:58:17.390 --> 02:58:20.240
FOREIGN LEADER? THIS PRESIDENT 
DID. SOMETHING THE WHISTLEBLOWER

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
NEVER EXPECT.

02:58:27.501 --> 02:58:33.441
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE KEPT HEARING
, GOT CAUGHT. PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

02:58:33.641 --> 02:58:37.798
WE KEEP HEARING, IS OBSTRUCTING 
JUSTICE. THE PRESIDENT

02:58:41.359 --> 02:58:43.359
THAT TOOK THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP
OF RELEASING A TRANSCRIPT SO 

02:58:43.392 --> 02:58:46.843
EVERYONE COULD SEE THE TRUTH IS 
NOT OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS. THE 

02:58:47.044 --> 02:58:51.925
PRESIDENT DID NOT GET CAUGHT. 
THE WHISTLEBLOWER GOT CAUGHT. 

02:58:52.124 --> 02:58:54.361
THE WHISTLEBLOWER MADE FALSE 
STATEMENTS. THE WHISTLEBLOWER 

02:58:54.562 --> 02:59:03.709
GOT CAUGHT WITH CHAIRMAN SHIFTS.
-- 46 

02:59:04.660 --> 02:59:10.965
-- CHAIRMAN SCHIFF . THE PERSON 
THAT GOT CAUGHT WAS THE 

02:59:11.109 --> 02:59:15.896
WHISTLEBLOWER. HAVE YOU SPOKEN 
DIRECTLY TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER? 

02:59:16.096 --> 02:59:22.800
NO, WE HAVE NOT. THE PERSON THAT
SAID HE HAD EVIDENCE OF THE 

02:59:23.001 --> 02:59:26.450
FIRST FAKE IMPEACHMENT SCAM, 
COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA HAD 

02:59:26.650 --> 02:59:30.465
EVIDENCE OF THE COLLUSION AND 
THEN DIDN'T HAVE IT. THE PERSON 

02:59:30.611 --> 02:59:36.002
WHO, IN THE COURSE OF THAT, READ
INTO THE DOCUMENT, THE STEELE 

02:59:36.753 --> 02:59:40.419
DOSSIER, THAT PEOPLE NEEDED TO 
KNOW THE TRUTH. WE HEARD ABOUT 

02:59:40.569 --> 02:59:42.569
THE

02:59:44.539 --> 02:59:46.559
THIS WEEK WHEN THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL SAID IT WAS RUBBISH AND 

02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:50.983
ALL MADE UP.  YEAH, THAT 
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF . NOW HE WAS 

02:59:51.130 --> 02:59:56.724
CAUGHT NOT BEING TRUTHFUL ABOUT 
A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO DID NOT TELL

02:59:56.923 --> 03:00:01.891
THE TRUTH VERBALLY AND IN 
WRITING. THAT IS IN A TRANSCRIPT

03:00:02.608 --> 03:00:05.782
. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID NOT 
GET IN THIS ONE WEEK IMPEACHMENT

03:00:06.809 --> 03:00:12.495
SUMMARY AND IN THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, WE DIDN'T GET THE 

03:00:12.643 --> 03:00:17.644
TRANSCRIPT. CHAIRMAN SCHIFF DID 
NOT SEND IT  OVER. ONLY IF YOU 

03:00:17.844 --> 03:00:21.497
WERE ON THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE WILL YOU SEE THAT 

03:00:21.697 --> 03:00:24.547
TRANSCRIPT. I'VE SEEN IT AND I 
WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO SEE IT. I

03:00:24.750 --> 03:00:30.639
YIELD TO CONGRESSMAN JORDAN. 
&gt;&gt; AND REFERENCING THE GENTLEMAN

03:00:31.389 --> 03:00:38.560
FROM ROAD ISLAND. AND MR. 
SONDLAND  WHO PRESUMED THERE WAS

03:00:38.761 --> 03:00:43.994
A QUID PRO QUO AND FILED AN 
ADDENDUM TO THE DEPOSITION 

03:00:44.139 --> 03:00:47.201
TESTIMONY. IN THE ADDENDUM, HE 
SAID HE RECALLED THAT

03:00:53.184 --> 03:00:55.018
MR. MORRISON RECALL THAT I 
CONVEYED THIS MESSAGE ON 

03:00:55.019 --> 03:00:57.815
SEPTEMBER 1, 2019 IN CONNECTION 
TO THE VICE PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO

03:00:57.958 --> 03:01:02.885
WARSAW AND THE CONVERSATION WITH
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY . HERE'S THE 

03:01:03.071 --> 03:01:05.071
THING,

03:01:08.016 --> 03:01:10.016
SOMEHOW THROUGH ALL OF THAT WE 
GET THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVING 

03:01:10.047 --> 03:01:12.281
THERE WAS QUID PRO QUO AND THEY 
NEED TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. 

03:01:13.043 --> 03:01:17.365
WHAT THEY FORGET IS WHAT MR. 
GATES BROUGHT UP A FEW MINUTES 

03:01:18.125 --> 03:01:22.033
AGO. THEY ARE TALKING AND THIS 
IS PART OF THEIR SCHEME. TWO 

03:01:22.793 --> 03:01:27.719
DAYS AGO, THE GUY WHO STARTED IT
SAID IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND THAT'S

03:01:28.481 --> 03:01:30.481
THEIR GUY.

03:01:35.850 --> 03:01:38.083
HE HAD TO FILE HIS ADDENDUM TO 
HIS TESTIMONY AND RIGHT THE 

03:01:38.284 --> 03:01:40.519
SENTENCE TO CLARIFY AND I THINK 
THIS IS AMAZING. THIS IS THE 

03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:45.391
CLARIFICATION. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR
RECALLED IN SEPTEMBER 2019 IN 

03:01:45.592 --> 03:01:52.505
THE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY . HE IS THE KEY HERE IN

03:01:52.704 --> 03:01:54.739
TIME MAGAZINE JUST REPORTED IT 
DID NOT HAPPEN. THE SAME DAY 

03:01:54.939 --> 03:01:58.997
THAT ESTHER GATES SAID YOU FILED
YOUR ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. 

03:01:59.749 --> 03:02:04.021
HOLY COW, THIS IS WHAT IT COMES 
TO? I YIELD BACK. 

03:02:04.022 --> 03:02:06.022
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK

03:02:08.348 --> 03:02:09.563
. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I MOVE TO 

03:02:09.564 --> 03:02:11.564
STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

03:02:14.647 --> 03:02:19.660
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIR, I MOVED TO STRIKE 
THE LAST WORD? 

03:02:19.661 --> 03:02:25.000
&gt;&gt; THE LADY IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THAT I HAVE 

03:02:25.201 --> 03:02:27.236
BEEN PRETTY SHOCKED AND 
DISAPPOINTED WITH MY COLLEAGUES 

03:02:27.437 --> 03:02:32.106
ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE HAVE 
BEEN SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE 

03:02:32.856 --> 03:02:36.789
BEEN SAID LIKE THE PRESIDENT 
NEVER USED THE WORD DEMAND. I 

03:02:36.989 --> 03:02:42.608
CAN TELL YOU THIS. WHEN A ROBBER
POINT A GUN AT YOU TO TAKE YOUR 

03:02:42.756 --> 03:02:47.345
MONEY, THEY USUALLY DON'T WALK 
UP AND SAY, I'M ROBBING YOU 

03:02:48.106 --> 03:02:53.190
RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER ARGUMENT WE
HAVE HEARD THIS MORNING IS THAT 

03:02:53.343 --> 03:02:55.765
THE AIDE WAS RELEASED

03:03:00.749 --> 03:03:02.981
, IT WAS EVENTUALLY RELEASED AND
THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION OR AN

03:03:03.197 --> 03:03:04.816
ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN 
INVESTIGATION. BUT THE AIDE WAS 

03:03:04.817 --> 03:03:09.483
RELEASED BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT 
GOT CAUGHT. IT WAS RELEASED 

03:03:09.682 --> 03:03:12.329
AFTER THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S 
COMPLAINT. IT WAS RELEASED AFTER

03:03:12.530 --> 03:03:16.396
PUBLIC REPORTS THE AIDE WAS 
BEING WITHHELD BECAUSE UKRAINE 

03:03:16.597 --> 03:03:22.483
WAS BEING COERCED INTO DOING AN 
INVESTIGATION. AND, CONGRESS HAD

03:03:22.683 --> 03:03:26.950
INITIATED CONGRESSIONAL AND BEST
OCCASIONS INTO WHY THE AIDE WAS 

03:03:27.699 --> 03:03:35.282
BEING RELEASED. YOU KNOW, WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS ALL DAY 

03:03:35.482 --> 03:03:37.482
LONG, BUT THE EFFECTS ARE PRETTY
CLEAR.

03:03:41.783 --> 03:03:44.216
THE PRESIDENT ABUSED HIS POWER, 
THE PRECIOUS POWER OF HIS OFFICE

03:03:44.419 --> 03:03:48.686
TO COERCE A COUNTRY DEPENDENT ON
US. A COUNTRY WHO IS FIGHTING 

03:03:48.885 --> 03:03:53.967
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION BECAUSE WHEN 
UKRAINE FIGHTS AGGRESSION, THEY 

03:03:54.166 --> 03:03:58.271
ARE HELPING US FIGHT THE RUSSIAN
AGGRESSION AND HE DID IT FOR 

03:03:58.647 --> 03:04:03.719
PERSONAL GAIN ANY HE SHOULD BE 
HELD ACCOUNTABLE. MR. CHAIR, I 

03:04:04.468 --> 03:04:06.468
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE LADY YIELDS BACK.

03:04:09.606 --> 03:04:11.385
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE A 
QUESTION. 

03:04:11.386 --> 03:04:16.722
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. THERE

03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:22.405
IS RECOMMEND -- THERE IS 
INFORMATION ABOUT CORRESPONDENCE

03:04:22.606 --> 03:04:26.824
AND A SUBPOENA SERVED BY 
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF . 

03:04:26.825 --> 03:04:31.890
&gt;&gt; WE RESIDE -- REVERSE THE 
RIGHT TO OBJECT.

03:04:36.218 --> 03:04:38.218
&gt;&gt; I HAVE OTHERS. 
&gt;&gt; THOSE CITED OCTOBER 15 AND 

03:04:38.606 --> 03:04:40.606
DECEMBER 11.

03:04:45.770 --> 03:04:47.390
OFFERS TO WORK WITH CONGRESS 
WITH LEGITIMATE OVERSIGHT 

03:04:47.391 --> 03:04:48.821
AUTHORITIES. THERE WERE 
INACCURACIES IN THE REPORT. 

03:04:48.822 --> 03:04:53.624
CONTRARY TO THE ASSERTION -- 
&gt;&gt; ARE THESE PUBLIC 

03:04:53.777 --> 03:04:56.124
CORRESPONDENCE?
&gt;&gt; IT IS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN 

03:04:56.323 --> 03:05:03.639
THE VICE PRESIDENT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSES?

03:05:03.640 --> 03:05:08.292
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

03:05:08.293 --> 03:05:09.283
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE LADY IS 
RECOGNIZED. 

03:05:09.284 --> 03:05:14.808
&gt;&gt; I YIELD. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I THINK YOU NEED 

03:05:15.022 --> 03:05:18.058
TO REMEMBER THAT THE ABUSE OF 
POWER IS COMING FROM THE QUID 

03:05:18.272 --> 03:05:21.722
PRO QUO CHARGE WHICH THEN 
MORPHED INTO BRIBERY. THE 

03:05:22.483 --> 03:05:27.004
PROBLEM IS THAT MY COLLEAGUES 
CANNOT MAKE OUT THE CASE WHICH 

03:05:27.766 --> 03:05:32.495
MEANS THE ELEMENTS ARE NOT 
SUPPORTED BY THE FACT. LET'S GO 

03:05:32.689 --> 03:05:36.542
BACK AND LOOK AT THE FEDERAL 
STATUTE FOR BRIBERY. THE 

03:05:36.755 --> 03:05:40.007
ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS. WHOEVER
BEING A PUBLIC OFFICIAL 

03:05:40.770 --> 03:05:44.272
CORRUPTLY OF DEMANDS OR RECEIVES
PERSONALLY ANYTHING OF VALUE IN 

03:05:44.473 --> 03:05:48.690
RETURN FOR BEING AN INFLUENCE IN
THE PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICIAL 

03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:53.207
ACT. WE CAN TEAR APART EACH OF 
THESE ELEMENTS, BUT LET ME FOCUS

03:05:53.970 --> 03:05:55.970
ON CORRUPT.

03:05:58.497 --> 03:06:00.523
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT HAVE 
CORRUPT INTENT AND THAT'S WHY 

03:06:00.723 --> 03:06:07.625
THE DEMOCRATS CANNOT MAKE OUT A 
CASE. PRIOR TO THE JULY 25 CALL,

03:06:08.375 --> 03:06:11.839
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT ASKING 
UKRAINE TO QUOTE UNQUOTE MAKEUP 

03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:20.583
DIRT ON MY OPPONENT. FOR 
WHATEVER REASON, THAT IS BEING 

03:06:20.731 --> 03:06:24.687
MISSED. THERE WAS ALSO 
SIGNIFICANT REASON TO BELIEVE 

03:06:25.090 --> 03:06:29.972
THE BUTTONS WERE INVOLVED IN 
CORRUPTION AND THERE IS EVIDENCE

03:06:30.172 --> 03:06:32.243
THAT UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS 
COLLUDED WITH DEMOCRATS IN THE 

03:06:33.022 --> 03:06:37.290
2016 CAMPAIGN. THERE IS A LOT 
BEING TALKED ABOUT WITH THE 

03:06:37.490 --> 03:06:42.770
CONSPIRACY THEORY BUT THEY ALL 
REPORTED ON THIS. FOR WHATEVER 

03:06:42.971 --> 03:06:46.223
REASON, NOW IT IS LABELED A 
CONSPIRACY THEORY. ALSO THE 

03:06:46.423 --> 03:06:50.492
PRESIDENT WAS NOT SEEKING TO 
HELP WITH THE 2020 CAMPAIGN BUT 

03:06:50.699 --> 03:06:55.361
WAS SEEKING ACCOUNTABILITY 
REGARDING THE UKRAINE DEMOCRAT 

03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:57.795
COLLUSION AND 2016 AND ALSO 
POTENTIAL CORRUPTION IN THE 

03:06:58.559 --> 03:07:02.263
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S DEALINGS 
WITH UKRAINE AS WELL. WE HAVE TO

03:07:03.013 --> 03:07:08.160
REMEMBER TOO WHAT PROFESSOR 
TURLEY SAID. PROFESSOR TURLEY 

03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:11.343
VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND IS
NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER AND HE WAS

03:07:11.490 --> 03:07:16.282
IMPARTIAL. I QUOTE THE 
PROFESSOR. PRESIDENT TRUMP DID 

03:07:16.482 --> 03:07:19.132
NOT STATE A QUID PRO QUO IN THE 
CALL. HE IS USING THE STATEMENT 

03:07:19.891 --> 03:07:22.079
TO PROMPT THE UKRAINIANS TO 
COOPERATE

03:07:26.648 --> 03:07:28.648
. PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVE THERE 
WAS A CORRUPT AGREEMENT WITH 

03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:31.918
HUNTER BIDEN THAT WAS NOT FULLY 
INVESTIGATED BY THE OBAMA 

03:07:32.132 --> 03:07:34.132
ADMINISTRATION, THE REQUEST FOR 
INVESTIGATION IS NOT CORRUPT. 

03:07:34.163 --> 03:07:38.017
AGAIN, QUOTING PROFESSOR TURLEY.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO QUOTE THE 

03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:42.898
MUELLER REPORT. AS AN ASIDE, WE 
NEED TO REMEMBER MONTHS AGO THE 

03:07:43.301 --> 03:07:45.533
MOTHER CAME HERE AND SAID THERE 
WAS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR 

03:07:45.936 --> 03:07:49.184
OF OBSTRUCTION. AGAIN, WE ARE 
BACK HERE. LET ME GO TO THE 

03:07:49.935 --> 03:07:51.935
MUELLER REPORT.

03:07:54.267 --> 03:07:56.267
THERE WAS DISCUSSION OF 
CORRUPTION IN THE REPORT AS IT 

03:07:56.300 --> 03:07:58.131
PERTAINED TO OBSTRUCTION OF 
JUSTICE. IT WAS SAYING THAT 

03:07:58.132 --> 03:08:00.132
CORRUPTLY MEANS ACTING WITH

03:08:02.798 --> 03:08:04.798
AN IMPROPER MOTIVE OR WITH 
INTENT TO ATTAIN AN IMPROPER 

03:08:04.831 --> 03:08:07.880
ADVANTAGE FOR HIMSELF OR SOMEONE
ELSE INCONSISTENT WITH THE 

03:08:08.082 --> 03:08:13.164
OFFICIAL DUTY ON THE RIGHTS OF 
OTHERS. BY THAT STANDARD, BY 

03:08:13.366 --> 03:08:15.799
MUELLER POPA'S OWN STANDARD, THE
PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR IS 

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:19.667
INCONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION
OF THE UNDERLYING STATUTE. WITH 

03:08:19.866 --> 03:08:22.454
THAT, I YIELD BACK TO MY FRIEND 
AND COLLEAGUE FROM ALABAMA. 

03:08:22.455 --> 03:08:25.749
&gt;&gt; I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY 
TIME TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

03:08:25.950 --> 03:08:29.415
TEXAS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MY FRIEND, SO MUCH.

03:08:29.616 --> 03:08:34.687
FIRST OF ALL, I WAS ASTOUNDED, 
HAVING BEEN A PROSECUTOR AND 

03:08:34.899 --> 03:08:40.180
HAVING DEFENDED CASES. I'VE BEEN
A JUDGE AND I'VE SINCE A LOT OF 

03:08:40.381 --> 03:08:43.015
PEOPLE TO PRISON. I HAVE NEVER 
SENT SOMEONE TO PRISON WHERE THE

03:08:43.216 --> 03:08:49.113
VICTIM DID NOT KNOW OR FIGURE 
OUT THEY WERE A VICTIM. THAT IS 

03:08:49.514 --> 03:08:54.835
EXTRAORDINARY TO HEAR. THAT YOU 
CAN COMMIT A CRIME LIKE BRIBERY 

03:08:55.748 --> 03:09:00.001
OR THEFT AND THE VICTIM NEVER 
NOS  OR FIGURES OUT

03:09:04.962 --> 03:09:07.195
. I'VE NEVER SENT ANYBODY TO 
PRISON WHEN THE VICTIM DID NOT 

03:09:07.395 --> 03:09:09.531
KNOW THEY WERE A VICTIM. THERE 
MR. ROBY

03:09:15.519 --> 03:09:16.485
. 
&gt;&gt; I LET IT GO. 

03:09:16.486 --> 03:09:20.390
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MR. COLLINS TIERS 
ALL RIGHT, THERE IS ALSO 

03:09:20.590 --> 03:09:23.239
PROBABLY NOBODY ON THIS 
COMMITTEE THAT HAS FOLLOWED WHAT

03:09:23.438 --> 03:09:26.889
HAS HAPPENED OVER TIME IN 
UKRAINE MORE THAN I HAVE. THERE 

03:09:27.090 --> 03:09:35.223
IS NO QUESTION THAT PUTIN WANTS 
THE OLD SOVIET EMPIRE BACK . 

03:09:35.425 --> 03:09:38.273
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN PRESIDENT 
BUSH WAS IN OFFICE WAS THAT 

03:09:38.677 --> 03:09:43.146
PUTIN HAD RUSSIA INVADE GEORGIA 
. PRESIDENT BUSH REACTED 

03:09:43.346 --> 03:09:46.400
STRONGLY AND PUT SANCTIONS IN 
PLACE. SO, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN 

03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:48.800
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK OFFICE AND

03:09:52.288 --> 03:09:55.165
CLINTON WAS IN OFFICE? THEY WENT
OVER WITH A RED PLASTIC RESET 

03:09:55.326 --> 03:09:58.376
BUTTON AND THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR
TO PUTIN . LOOK, BUSH 

03:09:58.578 --> 03:10:02.845
OVERREACTED WHEN YOU INVADED 
GEORGIA AND SO YOU CAN INVADE 

03:10:03.046 --> 03:10:07.717
UKRAINE AND WE ARE OKAY. THAT 
MAY NOT BE WHAT THEY INTENDED, 

03:10:07.928 --> 03:10:11.381
BUT THAT'S WHAT PUTIN HEARD AND 
THEY INVADED UKRAINE, CRIMEA  

03:10:11.938 --> 03:10:17.450
AND EUROPE IS UPSET AT TRUMP? 
FOR HEAVEN SAKE. 

03:10:17.451 --> 03:10:27.169
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE LADY'S TIME IS 
EXPIRED. AND RECOGNIZING. 

03:10:27.170 --> 03:10:30.778
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

03:10:30.779 --> 03:10:33.620
&gt;&gt; RECOGNIZED.
&gt;&gt; AND MOVING

03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:41.521
SONDLAND AS AMBASSADOR TO THE EU
WHICH IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PICK.

03:10:46.114 --> 03:10:47.932
HE CONTRIBUTED MONEY TO THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND BECAME 

03:10:47.933 --> 03:10:50.529
AMBASSADOR TO THE EU. THEY DON'T
LIKE HIM NOW BECAUSE HE 

03:10:50.675 --> 03:10:54.234
CLARIFIED HIS TESTIMONY TO SAY, 
YES, THERE WAS DEFINITELY QUIT 

03:10:54.848 --> 03:10:59.522
PRO QUOTE AT THE HEART OF THIS 
WHOLE THING. OF COURSE, THEY 

03:10:59.730 --> 03:11:01.956
TURN ON THE PRESIDENT'S OWN 
AMBASSADOR. WE DON'T HAVE TO 

03:11:02.157 --> 03:11:05.096
RELY ON HIS WORD. I MENTIONED 
THIS BEFORE BECAUSE

03:11:10.076 --> 03:11:12.076
HE HAD LUNCH WITH DAVID HOLMES, 
THE SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT 

03:11:12.107 --> 03:11:16.933
OFFICIAL AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN 
KYIV. THEY WENT TO A RESTAURANT 

03:11:19.227 --> 03:11:21.607
AND AMBASSADOR SONDLAND GOT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE PHONE . 

03:11:21.754 --> 03:11:23.754
AFTERWARDS

03:11:24.911 --> 03:11:29.586
, AND HOLMES COULD HEAR THE 
CONVERSATION. THIS IS ALL 

03:11:29.787 --> 03:11:32.384
UNCONTRADICTED BY OTHER 
WITNESSES WHO WERE THERE. AND 

03:11:32.537 --> 03:11:37.396
ESSENTIALLY THE AMBASSADOR SAID 
TO HIM, YOU KNOW,

03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:44.768
ZELENSKY LOVES YOUR AND YOU WILL
GET  EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT FROM 

03:11:44.913 --> 03:11:46.913
HIM. AND

03:11:50.910 --> 03:11:53.554
HOLMES SAID, WHAT CAN WE GET? HE
SAID, IT'S THE BIG STUFF. HOLMES

03:11:53.755 --> 03:11:56.474
SAID, DO YOU MEAN THE WAR BY THE
BIG STUFF?

03:12:01.475 --> 03:12:04.197
AND HE SAID, NO, WHAT MR. TRUMP 
CARES ABOUT. I DON'T HAVE

03:12:08.175 --> 03:12:10.611
THE VERBATIM IN FRONT OF ME, BUT
THE SUBSTANCE IS CLEAR. WHAT CAN

03:12:10.812 --> 03:12:16.098
BENEFIT HIM, LIKE THE BIDENS. IT
WAS EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

03:12:16.300 --> 03:12:19.752
WANTED TO GET FROM PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY. HE WANTED A STATEMENT 

03:12:20.513 --> 03:12:26.452
ON TELEVISION THAT UKRAINE WAS 
INVESTIGATING AND IS GOING TO 

03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:32.866
INVESTIGATE VP JOE BIDEN. HE 
WANTED A STATEMENT CONTRADICTING

03:12:35.802 --> 03:12:37.831
THE 2016 UNDERSTANDING BY OUR 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND BY 

03:12:38.032 --> 03:12:43.920
SPECIAL COUNCIL  MUELLER THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN INTERFERENCE IN 

03:12:44.121 --> 03:12:48.803
SAYING THAT UKRAINE INTERFERED. 
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED AND THAT 

03:12:49.004 --> 03:12:52.655
WAS THE BIG STUFF. HE DID NOT 
CARE ABOUT THE RUSSIAN WAR ON 

03:12:52.855 --> 03:12:57.335
THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. HE DID 
NOT CARE ABOUT CORRUPTION. THEY 

03:12:57.536 --> 03:13:02.139
INVITE US TO BELIEVE THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS AN ANTI-CORRUPTION CREW

03:13:02.287 --> 03:13:07.823
SHADER. HE WAS SHAKING DOWN 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND HE 

03:13:07.970 --> 03:13:13.373
DOESN'T RAISE CORRUPTION ON THE 
CALL EXCEPT FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED

03:13:13.574 --> 03:13:16.561
WAS GOING ON WITH THE BIDENS. 
EXCEPT THAT HE REDUCED 

03:13:16.701 --> 03:13:19.712
ANTICORRUPTION FUNDING FOR 
UKRAINE AND HE DOESN'T RAISE IT 

03:13:20.074 --> 03:13:25.363
ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WE CAN FIND 
IT. YOU PICK UP THE NEW YORK 

03:13:26.122 --> 03:13:30.587
TIMES YESTERDAY AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAD TO PAY $2 MILLION TO 

03:13:30.738 --> 03:13:33.633
CHARITIES BECAUSE HE RIPPED OFF 
HIS OWN CHARITY FOR MILLIONS OF 

03:13:33.779 --> 03:13:36.929
DOLLARS. THIS IS THE 
ANTICORRUPTION CRUSADER THEY 

03:13:37.144 --> 03:13:45.063
WANT US TO BELIEVE IN. THE GUY 
WHO PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

03:13:45.467 --> 03:13:47.500
WHICH THE ATTORNEY JOURNAL OF 
NEW YORK CALLED A CLASSIC BAIT 

03:13:47.700 --> 03:13:51.968
AND SWITCH OPERATION. THIS IS 
THE GUY THEY WANTED US TO 

03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:54.961
BELIEVE WAS SHAKING DOWN THE 
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE

03:13:59.686 --> 03:14:01.686
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED HE HAD A 
SECRET ANTI-TRUMP AGENDA THAT 

03:14:01.718 --> 03:14:03.751
WASN'T RELATED TO THE BIDENS OR 
RELATED TO REHABILITATING THE 

03:14:04.509 --> 03:14:06.509
TOTALLY DISCREDITED RUSSIAN 
CONSPIRACY THEORY

03:14:10.252 --> 03:14:12.487
. THAT IT WAS UKRAINE AND NOT 
RUSSIA THAT INTERFERED IN OUR 

03:14:12.687 --> 03:14:18.171
CAMPAIGN IN 2016. COME ON. GET 
REAL. BE SERIOUS. WE KNOW 

03:14:18.372 --> 03:14:22.025
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE WITH 
17 WITNESSES. IT IS 

03:14:22.227 --> 03:14:25.022
UNCONTRADICTED AND THERE IS NO 
RIVAL STORY. NO RIVAL STORY AT 

03:14:25.170 --> 03:14:32.179
ALL. OUR COLLEAGUES WILL NOT 
EVEN TELL US WHETHER IN THEORY 

03:14:32.391 --> 03:14:34.626
THEY THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG FOR
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

03:14:34.827 --> 03:14:36.859
STATES TO SHAKE DOWN FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTS AND TO GET INVOLVED 

03:14:37.061 --> 03:14:40.912
IN OUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS IN
ORDER TO HARM THE PRESIDENT'S 

03:14:41.663 --> 03:14:44.777
POLITICAL OPPONENTS. THEY WON'T 
EVEN TELL US IN PRINCIPLE 

03:14:44.978 --> 03:14:47.962
WHETHER THEY THINK IT IS WRONG 
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IT IS TOO 

03:14:48.109 --> 03:14:51.790
DANGEROUS. WE KNOW THEY DON'T 
ACCEPT THE FACTS OR THE EVIDENCE

03:14:52.694 --> 03:14:54.728
AND THEY DON'T LIKE THE FACT 
THAT THE DEPOSITIONS TOOK PLACE 

03:14:54.927 --> 03:14:58.589
IN THE BASEMENT. WHERE SHOULD 
THEY HAVE BEEN? THE FIRST FLOOR 

03:14:58.790 --> 03:15:04.208
OR THE SECOND FLOOR? IF WE FOUND
ANOTHER ROOM, WOULD THAT BE ALL 

03:15:04.397 --> 03:15:08.943
RIGHT? I WAS IN THAT ROOM AND 
THERE WERE DEMOCRATS AND THERE 

03:15:09.145 --> 03:15:11.177
WERE REPUBLICANS. THE DEMOCRATIC
COUNCIL GOT ONE HOUR  AND THE 

03:15:11.379 --> 03:15:15.041
REPUBLICAN COUNCIL GOT ONE HOUR 
AND IT WAS ON BOTH SIDES. ENOUGH

03:15:15.242 --> 03:15:19.310
OF THESE PHONY OBJECTIONS. LET'S
GET BACK TO THE FACTS OF WHAT 

03:15:19.509 --> 03:15:22.758
HAPPENED. THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES SHOULD DOWN A 

03:15:22.958 --> 03:15:25.191
FOREIGN POWER TO GET INVOLVED IN
OUR ELECTION. THAT IS WRONG. I 

03:15:25.942 --> 03:15:28.134
YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN. 

03:15:28.135 --> 03:15:32.859
&gt;&gt; YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN. 

03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:36.316
&gt;&gt; TO WHAT PURPOSES DO YOU SEEK 
RECOGNITION? 

03:15:36.317 --> 03:15:40.573
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE LAST WORD.
&gt;&gt;

03:15:44.090 --> 03:15:46.051
THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:15:46.052 --> 03:15:49.910
&gt;&gt; THERE IS MENTIONING A LOT 
ABOUT DAVID HOLMES 

03:15:53.024 --> 03:15:56.224
. FOR A GUY WHO HEARD PART OF 
ONE HALF OF A THREE-MINUTE PHONE

03:15:56.402 --> 03:16:00.080
CALL. HE HAD A 40 MINUTE OPENING
STATEMENT.  SONDLAND 

03:16:05.007 --> 03:16:07.038
TESTIFIED THAT BIDEN WAS NEVER 
LINKED IN HIS MIND UNTIL THE 

03:16:07.238 --> 03:16:09.271
TRANSCRIPT WAS RELEASED AT THE 
END OF AUGUST . THE DEMOCRATIC 

03:16:09.472 --> 03:16:11.706
REPORT AND NOT THE REPUBLICAN 
REPORT, THE DEMOCRATIC REPORT 

03:16:12.470 --> 03:16:16.586
DOES NOT ESTABLISH A LINK 
BETWEEN THE INVESTIGATION FOR 

03:16:16.788 --> 03:16:21.658
HIS POLITICAL BENEFIT. ONLY 
DEMOCRATS RELYING ON THAT 

03:16:22.074 --> 03:16:24.074
INVESTIGATION AS AMBASSADOR

03:16:29.176 --> 03:16:31.008
SONDLAND'S TESTIMONY. THEY LEAVE
OUT CRUCIAL PARTS OF THE 

03:16:31.009 --> 03:16:33.009
TESTIMONY WHICH IS AFTER BEING 
QUESTIONED  THAT HE ONLY 

03:16:33.044 --> 03:16:36.745
PRESUMED TO THE LINKAGE. IN 
FACT, HE ADMITTED IN HIS PUBLIC 

03:16:36.898 --> 03:16:39.333
TESTIMONY THAT NO ONE IN THE 
WORLD TOLD HIM THERE WAS ANY 

03:16:39.534 --> 03:16:44.817
LANGUAGE. THIS WAS THE BASIC 
BASIS FOR THE DEMOCRATS. I WANT 

03:16:45.017 --> 03:16:50.905
TO GO FURTHER ABOUT WHY WE 
SHOULD ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT. A 

03:16:51.118 --> 03:16:53.153
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WAS SAY 
NEVER, IN MY VIEW, HAD AMERICAN 

03:16:53.913 --> 03:16:57.967
BEEN LED BY SUCH A DANGEROUS 
HEAD OF STATE. HE BEMOANED THAT 

03:16:58.113 --> 03:17:01.404
AMERICA WAS LED BY A RECKLESS 
AND ARROGANT PRESIDENT.

03:17:04.925 --> 03:17:06.756
THAT WAS SENATOR ROBERT BYRD 
FROM WEST VIRGINIA DESCRIBING 

03:17:06.757 --> 03:17:08.757
GEORGE W. BUSH.

03:17:11.830 --> 03:17:13.861
RONALD REAGAN WAS ACCUSED OF 
ABUSE OF POWER FOR PUSHING A 

03:17:14.063 --> 03:17:16.380
GROWTH-BASED ECONOMIC AGENDA. 
FOR COMMITTING TROOPS TO LEBANON

03:17:18.533 --> 03:17:23.816
OR FOR TURNING BACK THE 
SANDINISTAS AND IN NICARAGUA.  

03:17:24.017 --> 03:17:25.435
CLINTON, EXCLUDING THE 
IMPEACHMENT, WAS ACCUSED OF 

03:17:25.436 --> 03:17:27.436
ABUSIVE ACCUSATIONS FOR AN ASIAN
FUNDRAISING.

03:17:31.943 --> 03:17:33.943
AID TO GIVING SWEETHEART 
APPOINTMENTS AND USE OF THE FBI 

03:17:33.975 --> 03:17:37.763
TO DIG UP DIRT ON POLITICAL 
EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS WACO AND A 

03:17:37.915 --> 03:17:42.701
SWEDISH SLUSH FUND. GEORGE W. 
BUSH WAS ACCUSED FOR DOMESTIC 

03:17:42.914 --> 03:17:45.753
SPYING AND ENERGY TASK FORCE 
CONTROVERSY. THE PRESIDENTIAL 

03:17:46.513 --> 03:17:52.868
RECORDS THAT, TARIFFS, THE IRAQ 
WAR AND NSA OVERREACH. OBAMA'S 

03:17:53.067 --> 03:17:55.067
IRS ENGAGED IN

03:17:58.660 --> 03:17:59.972
TARGETING CHARITABLE GROUPS. 
FAST AND FURIOUS GUNRUNNING 

03:17:59.973 --> 03:18:02.208
SCANDAL THAN COLLECTING PHONE 
RECORDS ON AP JOURNALISTS 

03:18:02.407 --> 03:18:07.786
WITHOUT A RECORD WARRANT. AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

03:18:11.959 --> 03:18:14.189
. THE PROBLEM WE ARE RUNNING 
INTO, WHICH IS GOING TO LAST 

03:18:14.390 --> 03:18:16.826
LONGER THAN TODAY AND FAR LONGER
IN THIS CONGRESS IS THAT THIS 

03:18:17.028 --> 03:18:21.710
WILL BECOME THE NEW NORMAL. 
EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I

03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:24.348
MENTIONED HAVE REPORTS WRITTEN 
ABOUT THEM AND THEY PROBABLY HAD

03:18:25.107 --> 03:18:28.817
ELECTION CONSEQUENCES. THERE 
WERE HEARINGS HELD BUT THEY DID 

03:18:29.021 --> 03:18:33.889
NOT HAVE A NEBULOUS AND 
AMBIGUOUS CHARGE OF POWER. IF 

03:18:34.090 --> 03:18:36.327
YOU CANNOT PROVE AN UNDERLYING 
CRYING, YOU DON'T GET TO USE ALL

03:18:36.527 --> 03:18:38.974
THE EVIDENCE YOU ARE PRESENTING.
THIS WILL CONTINUE AND THIS WILL

03:18:39.174 --> 03:18:43.028
MOVE FORWARD AND THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY, THE PARTY NOT IN 

03:18:43.241 --> 03:18:47.094
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ACCUSED THE 
WHITE HOUSE OF POWER. IT STARTED

03:18:47.295 --> 03:18:52.578
200 YEARS AGO AND WILL CONTINUE 
INTO THE FUTURE. 

03:18:52.979 --> 03:18:57.663
CONGRATULATIONS, NOW IT WILL BE 
IMPEACHMENT EVERY TIME ONE PARTY

03:18:57.864 --> 03:18:59.483
CONTROLS THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES AND THE OTHER 

03:18:59.484 --> 03:19:01.918
PARTY IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
WITH THAT, I YIELD MY FRIEND 

03:19:02.682 --> 03:19:08.022
FROM LOUISIANA. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK MY FRIEND. FOR THE 

03:19:08.222 --> 03:19:10.222
LAST TWO HOURS WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT THIS AMENDMENT 

03:19:10.256 --> 03:19:12.490
THAT MR. JORDAN BROUGHT TO 
STRIKE ARTICLE 1 OF THE 

03:19:12.691 --> 03:19:18.178
RESOLUTION. IT'S NOT WORTH THE 
PAPER IT IS WRITTEN ON. ARTICLE 

03:19:18.379 --> 03:19:20.402
4 OF THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US 
THE POWER TO IMPEACH THE 

03:19:20.614 --> 03:19:23.052
PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
TREASON, BRIBERY OR A HIGH CRIME

03:19:23.812 --> 03:19:27.653
OR MISDEMEANOR. YOU HAVE 
DEVOLVED THIS TO AN ABUSE OF 

03:19:27.794 --> 03:19:30.460
POWER ALLEGATION WHICH IS 
CERTAINLY NOT A HIGH CRIME

03:19:34.019 --> 03:19:36.457
. TO SUMMARIZE, IF YOU GET LOST 
IN THE ARGUMENTS AT HOME, HERE'S

03:19:36.659 --> 03:19:39.095
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. IN THE 
243 YEAR HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY,

03:19:39.293 --> 03:19:44.781
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO 
PRESIDENTS IMPEACHED BY A VOTE 

03:19:44.983 --> 03:19:48.034
OF THE HOUSE AND THOSE ARE 
ANDREW JOHNSON AND BILL CLINTON.

03:19:48.233 --> 03:19:50.233
AND THEN NIXON IMPEACHMENT 
INVESTIGATION, EVIDENCE CLEARLY 

03:19:50.466 --> 03:19:52.466
ESTABLISH THAT CRIMINAL ACTS 
WERE COMMITTED

03:19:55.149 --> 03:19:57.325
. EVIDENCE CLEARLY ESTABLISH 
THAT SPECIFIC CRIMINAL ACTS WERE

03:19:57.480 --> 03:20:00.832
COMMITTED. YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE 
IT HERE AND THEY KNOW IT AND YOU

03:20:01.588 --> 03:20:03.588
KNOW IT

03:20:05.500 --> 03:20:07.936
. IT'S NOT AN ARTICLE 1 OR 
ARTICLE 2 AND IN NOTHING THAT 

03:20:08.138 --> 03:20:11.120
HAS BEEN SAID HERE IN THE LAST 
TWO HOURS. THE FACTS DO NOT 

03:20:11.273 --> 03:20:13.782
CHANGE. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED
SINGLE PARTY IMPEACHMENT 

03:20:13.938 --> 03:20:19.310
CHARADE. EVERYBODY AT HOME CAN 
SEE THAT CLEARLY. THESE THINGS 

03:20:19.511 --> 03:20:22.046
DON'T CHANGE AND THEY WON'T. I 
YIELD BACK TO MY FRIEND.

03:20:22.047 --> 03:20:24.950
&gt;&gt; MR. ARMSTRONG. 
&gt;&gt;

03:20:28.863 --> 03:20:30.236
I YIELD TO MY FRIEND FROM 
FLORIDA. 

03:20:30.237 --> 03:20:32.237
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE GENTLEMAN FOR 
YIELDING. NO EVIDENCE.

03:20:36.378 --> 03:20:38.378
NO ONE FELT THERE WAS A 
CONNECTION BETWEEN U.S. MILITARY

03:20:38.399 --> 03:20:40.399
AID IN THE REQUEST FOR 
INVESTIGATIONS

03:20:43.482 --> 03:20:45.717
. THE EARMARK WAS ADEQUATE AND 
WE NEVER HAD THE FEELING THIS 

03:20:45.918 --> 03:20:47.951
WILL AID WAS CONNECTED TO A 
SPECIFIC ISSUE. MR. CHAIRMAN, I 

03:20:48.152 --> 03:20:51.559
SEEK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ENTER 
THE TIME ARTICLE INTO THE 

03:20:51.707 --> 03:20:55.755
RECORD.
&gt;&gt; THE ARTICLE WILL BE ENTERED.

03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:03.074
&gt;&gt; MR. COHEN SEEKS RECOGNITION. 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

03:21:03.075 --> 03:21:07.606
&gt;&gt; RECOGNIZED.
&gt;&gt; I TOOK THEATER AND DRAMA IN 

03:21:07.767 --> 03:21:13.749
COLLEGE AND I WAS TOLD THE FIRST
THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO HAVE 

03:21:13.947 --> 03:21:15.378
THE WILLING SUSPENSION OF 
DISBELIEF. THE REPUBLICANS 

03:21:15.379 --> 03:21:18.096
OBVIOUSLY TOOK THE COURSE OVER 
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

03:21:21.665 --> 03:21:24.672
I MEAN, THEY ARE THE FIFTH 
AVENUE CROWD. THEY HAVE TALKED 

03:21:24.832 --> 03:21:31.013
ABOUT SONDLAND . THAT IS THE MAN
THE PRESIDENT AND POINTED AS HIS

03:21:31.213 --> 03:21:36.303
AMBASSADOR TO THE EU. THAT IS 
THE MAN HE SAYS IS A GREAT GUY 

03:21:36.504 --> 03:21:40.558
AND THE MAN WHO IS STILL 
EMPLOYED. SONDLAND HAS SAID THEY

03:21:40.759 --> 03:21:47.677
WERE ALL IN THE LOOP . POMPEO, 
GIULIANI, MULVANEY, THEY WERE 

03:21:47.878 --> 03:21:52.747
ALL IN THE LOOP. IT WAS ALL 
ABOUT THE QUID PRO QUO. IT WAS 

03:21:53.508 --> 03:21:58.370
ABOUT HAVING AN INVESTIGATION 
ANNOUNCED ON CNN AND THEN YOU 

03:21:58.521 --> 03:22:03.307
GET THE MILITARY AID. AND 
SONDLAND TOLD IN WARSAW TO  

03:22:03.855 --> 03:22:05.855
PRESIDENT

03:22:07.988 --> 03:22:09.805
ZELENSKY THAT YOU HAVE TO 
ANNOUNCE THE INVESTIGATION. IT 

03:22:09.806 --> 03:22:14.073
WAS A STRONG ARM . THEY DID IT. 
AND WHERE DO WE GET THESE PEOPLE

03:22:14.274 --> 03:22:18.954
IN THE LOOP TO TESTIFY. THE 
PRESIDENT SAYS NO, HE WON'T LET 

03:22:19.711 --> 03:22:23.220
THEM TESTIFY BECAUSE HE NOS  IF 
THEY TELL THE TRUTH  THAT IT 

03:22:23.419 --> 03:22:27.071
WILL HURT HIS CASE BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW THAT THEY HELD UP THE 

03:22:27.837 --> 03:22:34.087
MILITARY AID. PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
HAS NO CHOICE . HE NEEDS AMERICA

03:22:34.588 --> 03:22:40.488
TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM RUSSIA. 
THEY SAY HE HASN'T SAID THAT HE 

03:22:41.249 --> 03:22:47.389
FELT PRESSURED. A, HE IS AN 
ACTOR AND B, HE'S A POLITICIAN 

03:22:47.791 --> 03:22:56.328
AND HE DEPENDS ON US. HE HAS NO 
CHOICE. HE CAN SAY THAT. HE KNEW

03:22:56.527 --> 03:23:00.394
THE AID WAS BEING WITHHELD. HE 
KNEW IT JULY 25 AND THERE WERE 

03:23:00.594 --> 03:23:02.594
COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE EMBASSY

03:23:15.222 --> 03:23:19.384
. THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO FROM
SONDLAND . HE KNEW THAT

03:23:23.745 --> 03:23:25.779
THE WHISTLEBLOWER HAD COME 
FORWARD AND HE KNEW THE JIG WAS 

03:23:25.978 --> 03:23:31.879
UP. HE NEEDED TO FIND SOMETHING 
TO SAY IN THE RECORD. THEIR BEST

03:23:32.081 --> 03:23:35.529
WITNESS, THEY TALK ABOUT THE 
THREE PROFESSORS, THE THREE MOST

03:23:35.730 --> 03:23:39.793
RESPECTED PROFESSORS IN AMERICA 
AND THEY ALL SAID THIS IS THE 

03:23:39.944 --> 03:23:43.652
MOST IMPEACHABLE PRESIDENT. HIS 
ABUSE OF POWER IS ONE OF THE 

03:23:43.851 --> 03:23:46.086
MOST SERIOUS OFFENSES YOU CAN 
IMAGINE. IT'S THE CONSTITUTION 

03:23:46.300 --> 03:23:50.356
AND THE LAW OF THE LAND. IF YOU 
ABUSE YOUR POWER, THAT IS THE 

03:23:50.971 --> 03:23:54.244
MOST IMPEACHABLE CRIME YOU CAN 
BE CHARGED WITH. THEY FORGET 

03:23:55.183 --> 03:24:01.117
THEIR WITNESS SAID THAT WHAT THE
PRESIDENT DID WAS WRONG. HE DID 

03:24:01.330 --> 03:24:04.983
NOT COME IN AND GIVE A CLEAN 
BILL OF HEALTH. HE SAID, YOU 

03:24:05.182 --> 03:24:07.619
NEED MORE INFORMATION AND YOU 
NEED MORE PROOF. YOU CANNOT GET 

03:24:07.820 --> 03:24:10.158
THE PROOF BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT 
WILL NOT ALLOW HIS MEN

03:24:14.523 --> 03:24:16.972
TO TESTIFY. ONE IS WRITING A 
BOOK AND THE OTHER IS IN AN 

03:24:17.173 --> 03:24:19.196
INTERIM JOB. THE OTHER ONE IS 
RUNNING FOR SENATOR. THEY CAN'T 

03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:25.700
DO IT. THE PROOF IS THERE AND 
THIS IS THE MOST ABUSIVE ACT WE 

03:24:26.448 --> 03:24:31.584
CAN IMAGINE. TRYING TO INFLUENCE
ELECTIONS WITH FOREIGN 

03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:34.224
INTERFERENCE THAT TAKES POWER 
AWAY FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

03:24:34.438 --> 03:24:40.127
THAT WOULD END OUR COUNTRY AS WE
KNOW IT. A DEMOCRACY AND A 

03:24:40.330 --> 03:24:42.765
SHINING CITY ON THE HILL AND A 
BEACON OF HOPE FROM AROUND THE 

03:24:43.527 --> 03:24:48.250
WORLD WHO LOOK AT A GOVERNMENT 
WHO GIVES PEOPLE THE POWER AND 

03:24:49.009 --> 03:24:51.009
NOT KINGS.

03:24:52.718 --> 03:24:55.757
THIS IS A MAN WHO THINKS HE CAN 
DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. ARTICLE 2 

03:24:55.970 --> 03:24:58.712
SAYS, I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT, 
I'M PRESIDENT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

03:25:02.060 --> 03:25:04.496
WHEN HE SAYS, I NEED A FAVOR, HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT GETTING DIRT 

03:25:04.696 --> 03:25:10.741
ON THE BIDENS. HE FEARS JOE 
BIDEN AS HIS PRIMARY POLITICAL 

03:25:10.893 --> 03:25:15.665
RIVAL. MICHAEL COHEN DOESN'T SAY
WHAT HE WANTS AND HE SPEAKS IN 

03:25:15.879 --> 03:25:19.529
CODE. THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
CODE.  MICHAEL COHEN NOS  IT  

03:25:19.728 --> 03:25:27.045
AND IS IN PRISON NOW. INDIVIDUAL
1 IS NOT IN PRISON NOW BECAUSE 

03:25:27.247 --> 03:25:30.447
INDIVIDUAL 1 COULD NOT BEAT 
INDICTED BECAUSE OF THE JUSTICE 

03:25:30.592 --> 03:25:33.897
DEPARTMENT'S POLICY THAT YOU 
CANNOT INDICT A SITTING 

03:25:34.084 --> 03:25:37.806
PRESIDENT. MICHAEL COHEN IS IN 
PRISON BECAUSE HE FACILITATED 

03:25:38.757 --> 03:25:41.955
PAYMENTS TO MS. DANIELS AND MS. 
McDOUGALL

03:25:45.327 --> 03:25:47.562
. THE ABUSE OF POWER IS HAVING A
TERRIBLE FOUNDATION IN TAKING 

03:25:47.763 --> 03:25:51.415
ADVANTAGE OF CHARITIES AND USING
MONEY FOR YOUR OWN PURPOSES AND 

03:25:51.615 --> 03:25:54.667
HAVING TO PAY A $2 MILLION FINE 
AND NOT BEING ALLOWED ON A BOARD

03:25:54.866 --> 03:25:57.101
EVER AGAIN BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
HAVE THE CHARACTER TO BE OVER A 

03:25:57.851 --> 03:25:59.851
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

03:26:03.001 --> 03:26:05.236
. ABUSE OF POWER IS RIPPING OFF 
THE PEOPLE AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY 

03:26:05.436 --> 03:26:08.887
AND PAYING $25 MILLION. I YIELD 
BACK THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. 

03:26:09.035 --> 03:26:12.136
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 

03:26:12.339 --> 03:26:14.339
WORD. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN RECOGNIZED

03:26:16.604 --> 03:26:18.224
. 
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO WHY 

03:26:18.225 --> 03:26:23.110
I DON'T SEE REMARKS FROM THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE IN 

03:26:23.312 --> 03:26:25.546
THESE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. I
DO WANT TO SAY I'M A LITTLE 

03:26:25.745 --> 03:26:28.392
INCREDULOUS AS A PROSECUTOR. I'M
AMAZED AT WHAT THE MAJORITY ARE 

03:26:28.595 --> 03:26:35.297
CALLING FAX. THEY KEEP TALKING 
ABOUT THE EVIDENCE. WELL, THE 

03:26:35.497 --> 03:26:40.371
EVIDENCE IS IN DISPUTE BECAUSE 
IT IS BASED UPON HEARSAY, 

03:26:40.572 --> 03:26:48.292
OPINION AND SPECULATION. THESE 
ARE NOT FACTS , IT IS TESTIMONY 

03:26:48.491 --> 03:26:51.289
ABOUT WHAT SOMEONE CONCLUDED 
FROM ACTS TAKEN BY MEMBERS OF 

03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:59.253
THE ADMINISTRATION. THE CHARGE 
IS ABUSE OF POWER BUT WHAT THE 

03:26:59.402 --> 03:27:04.749
MAJORITY IS REALLY UPSET ABOUT 
IS THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT 

03:27:04.949 --> 03:27:07.131
AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS 
EXERCISING ITS POWER UNDER THE 

03:27:07.301 --> 03:27:11.585
CONSTITUTION. ITS AUTHORIZED 
POWERS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 

03:27:11.733 --> 03:27:16.677
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY TO SET 
FOREIGN POLICY AND FIRE, FOR 

03:27:16.827 --> 03:27:25.054
EXAMPLE, AN AMBASSADOR. IT IS 
NOT A SMEAR ON A OFFICIAL, IT IS

03:27:25.268 --> 03:27:29.322
THE USE OF ARTICLE 2, SECTION 2 
OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE 

03:27:29.522 --> 03:27:32.985
PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZED BY 
STATUTE TO PUT A STOP ON THE 

03:27:33.186 --> 03:27:38.754
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. THE 
PRESIDENT IS INSTRUCTED IN THE

03:27:46.390 --> 03:27:51.569
NDAA TO ASK FOR  INFORMATION 
FROM UKRAINE.

03:27:56.949 --> 03:27:59.179
YOU HAVE THE FACT THEY WERE ON 
THE CALL AND THE TRANSCRIPT 

03:27:59.393 --> 03:28:02.163
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. YOU HAVE 
OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS AFTER 

03:28:02.312 --> 03:28:04.312
THAT

03:28:09.751 --> 03:28:12.320
. WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL 
TESTIMONY THAT HAS NOT BEEN 

03:28:12.471 --> 03:28:16.855
HEARD, IT JUST SHOWS THE 
MAJORITY DOESN'T HAVE INTEREST 

03:28:17.055 --> 03:28:19.703
IN GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
QUESTION BECAUSE IF THEY DID 

03:28:19.904 --> 03:28:25.591
CARE ABOUT ACTUALLY FINDING OUT 
ABOUT FACTS, THEY WOULD BE 

03:28:26.351 --> 03:28:29.243
CALLING HIM BACK INTO THIS 
COMMITTEE IN DELAYING THIS 

03:28:29.444 --> 03:28:34.068
PROCESS. WHAT WE HAVE READ FROM 
THIS ARTICLE IN TIME MAGAZINE IS

03:28:34.216 --> 03:28:41.429
INCREDIBLE. IT IS EXCULPATORY 
AND QUITE FRANKLY A BOMBSHELL. 

03:28:41.845 --> 03:28:50.371
WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIFIC REJECTION
OF CLAIMS MADE BY AMBASSADOR 

03:28:50.785 --> 03:28:54.235
SONDLAND THAT AID WOULD NOT BE 
RELEASED  UNLESS INVESTIGATION 

03:28:54.434 --> 03:28:59.304
WERE LOST. WHY IS HE NOT HERE? 
IT WAS STATED WE NEVER HAD THAT 

03:28:59.518 --> 03:29:04.787
FEELING AND WE HAVE A UNDERSTAND
THE AID HAD BEEN FROZEN. WE WERE

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:10.029
TOLD THEY WOULD FIGURE IT OUT 
AND AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IT WAS 

03:29:10.213 --> 03:29:14.542
UNFROZEN. IT WASN'T CONNECTED TO
ANY SPECIFIC ISSUE. IF YOU 

03:29:14.744 --> 03:29:19.626
IGNORE THIS EVIDENCE AND YOU ARE
IN A COURT CASE, YOU WOULD LOSE 

03:29:19.826 --> 03:29:25.102
YOUR LAW LICENSE FOR ALLOWING A 
CASE TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT THIS 

03:29:25.302 --> 03:29:28.507
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE PROVIDED TO
THE DEFENSE.

03:29:28.508 --> 03:29:36.271
&gt;&gt; IT IS SO RIDICULOUS TO ME 
THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING TIME TO 

03:29:36.485 --> 03:29:41.086
LOOK FURTHER INTO THAT. WITH 
THAT, I WANT TO YIELD TO MR. 

03:29:41.234 --> 03:29:44.336
COLLINS.
&gt;&gt;  [ CAPTIONERS TRANSITIONING ]

03:29:44.489 --> 03:29:46.489
.
&gt;&gt;

03:30:26.131 --> 03:30:28.152
AND CALL IT ABUSE OF POWER 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:31.295
ELSE TO GIVE, THEY DON'T HAVE AN
ACTUAL CRIME BECAUSE IF THEY DID

03:30:32.216 --> 03:30:36.680
, IF YOU HAVE THE CRIME, IF YOU 
HAD IT YOU WOULD'VE PUT IT IN 

03:30:36.883 --> 03:30:40.546
THE ARTICLES YOU DIDN'T DO IT. 
BUT THE LAST THING THAT'S 

03:30:40.748 --> 03:30:44.813
AMAZING TO ME AND THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM TENNESSEE SENATE, HE CALLED

03:30:45.015 --> 03:30:47.806
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY A POLITICIAN 
AND AN ACTOR  IN A DERISIVE WAY.

03:30:47.994 --> 03:30:49.994
BASICALLY

03:30:54.565 --> 03:30:56.380
IMPLYING THAT POLITICIANS LIE, 
EVEN BETWEEN THAT THIS MORNING, 

03:30:56.381 --> 03:30:59.029
AND HE IS AN ACTOR. IT'S AMAZING
TO ME HOW WE IN THIS COMMITTEE 

03:30:59.788 --> 03:31:01.788
ARE AGGREGATING

03:31:06.142 --> 03:31:08.575
MR. ZELENSKY IN THE EYES OF HIS 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE 

03:31:08.776 --> 03:31:10.806
CAN'T MAKE A CASE AGAINST THIS 
PRESIDENT. THIS IS THE TRAGEDY 

03:31:11.007 --> 03:31:13.242
OF THIS IMPEACHMENT RIGHT NOW. 
THEY CAN'T MAKE THE FACT THAT HE

03:31:13.456 --> 03:31:15.779
FELT PRESSURE, THAT THE CRITICAL
ELEMENT OF THE CASE. 

03:31:15.780 --> 03:31:22.485
&gt;&gt; WHO IS SEEKING RECOGNITION? 
THE MAC

03:31:25.638 --> 03:31:30.505
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE UNANIMOUS 
REQUEST TO INTRODUCE THE USA 

03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:34.371
TODAY, THE CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT
OF THE PRESIDENT, FROM THE 

03:31:34.572 --> 03:31:36.955
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER AND THE 
BOSTON GLOBE -- 

03:31:36.956 --> 03:31:38.956
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO READ IT.

03:31:41.888 --> 03:31:44.123
&gt;&gt; THE OBJECTION IS HEARD. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE FOR HIM TO READ 

03:31:44.884 --> 03:31:46.884
IT. FEMALE
&gt;&gt;

03:31:50.422 --> 03:31:54.074
DOES ANYONE ELSE SEEK 
RECOGNITION OF THIS AMENDMENT? 

03:31:54.475 --> 03:31:59.162
WHAT PURPOSE? 
&gt;&gt; MOVE TO STRIKE LAST WORD. 

03:31:59.322 --> 03:32:01.393
&gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT MEMBERS OF THIS
COMMITTEE WOULD INSULATE THAT 

03:32:01.594 --> 03:32:05.648
UKRAINIANS GOT IN THE HAND OF 
RUSSIANS IS -- HAVING SERVED IN 

03:32:06.412 --> 03:32:08.412
THE COMBAT

03:32:15.813 --> 03:32:17.847
THEATER, TO BLAME THE AIDE WAS 
DELAYED A FEW WEEKS WOULD'VE 

03:32:18.047 --> 03:32:20.283
SAVED LIVES IS FRANKLY ENFOLDING
TO ME AND ALL THAT SERVED. NOW 

03:32:20.483 --> 03:32:22.483
DEMOCRATS WANT YOU TO BELIEVE 
THAT UKRAINIANS DIED AT ITS 

03:32:22.517 --> 03:32:24.749
TRUMPS ALL. WHAT WE IMPEACH HIM 
ON THAT. MEMBERS ON THE OTHER 

03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:27.181
SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT BRIBERY AND LAYING OUT A 

03:32:27.381 --> 03:32:30.833
CASE FOR BRIBERY YET, IF THEIR 
CASE WAS SO COMPELLING AND 

03:32:31.047 --> 03:32:35.314
OVERWHELMING AND THEY HAD THE 
ELEMENTS, WHY IS IN THE ARTICLES

03:32:35.514 --> 03:32:37.333
OF IMPEACHMENT? THEY DIDN'T 
INCLUDE IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO 

03:32:37.334 --> 03:32:39.566
EVIDENCE FOR THAT. THE AIDE WAS 
RELEASED BEFORE THE DEADLINE SET

03:32:40.316 --> 03:32:42.316
OUT BY

03:32:49.323 --> 03:32:50.948
CONGRESS. THEY RELEASED THE 
AIDE. UKRAINIANS DIDN'T START 

03:32:50.949 --> 03:32:52.780
ANY INVESTIGATIONS. THEY ALSO 
GOT A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 

03:32:52.781 --> 03:32:54.599
TRUMP AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DOESN'T HAVE TO MEET WITH 

03:32:54.600 --> 03:32:56.600
FOREIGN LEADERS AND HE STILL 
AGREED TO MEET WITH THEM. 

03:32:56.635 --> 03:32:59.026
ARTICLE 2 SAYS THE PRESIDENT, 
VICE PRESIDENT SHALL BE REMOVED,

03:32:59.243 --> 03:33:04.966
TREASON AND OTHER HIGH CRIMES 
AND MISDEMEANORS.  CONGRESS HAS 

03:33:05.168 --> 03:33:08.352
INTERPRETED THIS TO MEAN THAT 
CONGRESS HAS COMMITTED AN ACTUAL

03:33:08.506 --> 03:33:10.506
ACT

03:33:22.021 --> 03:33:24.256
, FOR EXAMPLE, HE WAS ACCUSED OF
A CRIMINAL ACT, BILL CLINTON, 

03:33:24.470 --> 03:33:26.694
THREE, THESE WERE CRIMES THAT 
WERE NOT TRIED IN THE HOUSE OF 

03:33:26.906 --> 03:33:28.906
REPRESENTATIVES, COULD HAVE BEEN
TRIED IN THE CRIMINAL COURT. THE

03:33:28.939 --> 03:33:31.573
STANDARD OF CRIMINALITY PROVIDES
CLARITY AND IS ONE W. MR. 

03:33:31.774 --> 03:33:33.202
TURLEY'S PLANT, ALTHOUGH 
CRIMINALITY IS NOT REQUIRED, 

03:33:33.203 --> 03:33:35.023
CLARITY IS NECESSARY. THAT COMES
FROM A COMPLETE AND 

03:33:35.024 --> 03:33:36.441
COMPREHENSIVE RECORD THAT 
ELIMINATES THE SCOPE. 

03:33:36.442 --> 03:33:37.873
EXPLANATIONS. BUT THROUGHOUT 
THIS INVESTIGATION THE DEMOCRATS

03:33:37.874 --> 03:33:41.881
COULDN'T FIND ANY WILL ACT ON 
THE PRESENT. INSTEAD OF RELYING 

03:33:42.029 --> 03:33:44.029
ON

03:33:47.422 --> 03:33:49.422
PRECEDENT, THEY DECIDED TO 
IMPEACH AND FOR ABUSE OF POWER. 

03:33:49.454 --> 03:33:54.724
A VAGUE PHRASE THAT APPEARS 
NOWHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION WHEN

03:33:54.938 --> 03:33:56.938
DISCUSSING IMPEACHMENT. IT HAS 
NO BASIS IN FACT OR EVIDENCE 

03:33:56.970 --> 03:33:59.111
RATHER IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN 
PERSONAL OPINION AND PERCEPTION.

03:34:07.330 --> 03:34:09.150
MR. TURLEY ALSO EXPLAINED THE 
APPLICATION OF THIS OCCURRENCE 

03:34:09.151 --> 03:34:11.184
QUOTE WE HAVE NEVER IMPEACHED A 
PRESIDENT SOLELY OR EVEN LARGELY

03:34:11.384 --> 03:34:13.417
ON THE BASIS OF A NONCRIMINAL 
ABUSE OF POWER ALLEGATION. THERE

03:34:13.617 --> 03:34:17.682
IS GOOD REASON FOR THAT [ABUSES 
OF POWER TEND TO BE LESS DEFINED

03:34:17.883 --> 03:34:20.117
AND MORE DEBATABLE AS A BASIS 
FOR IMPEACHMENT AND SOME OF THE 

03:34:20.319 --> 03:34:22.565
CRIMES ALREADY MENTIONED HE WENT
ON TO SAY THAT THE PROBLEM WITH 

03:34:22.765 --> 03:34:25.198
PROVING ABUSE OF POWER THEORY IS
A LACK OF DIRECT EVIDENCE DUE TO

03:34:25.399 --> 03:34:27.399
FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE

03:34:30.680 --> 03:34:32.680
WITNESSES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT
DIRECT EVIDENCE, THERE IS NOT, 

03:34:32.715 --> 03:34:34.746
THE ONLY PERSON WHO WOULD HAVE 
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE QUID 

03:34:34.947 --> 03:34:36.947
PRO QUO  BRIBERY EXTORTION OR 
WHATEVER BUZZWORD THE DEMOCRATS 

03:34:36.980 --> 03:34:39.014
WENT TO TROT OUT NEXT IS 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, WHO HAS  

03:34:39.215 --> 03:34:41.215
CATEGORICALLY DENIED ANY SUCH 
AGREEMENT OR PRESSURE. HEREIN 

03:34:41.807 --> 03:34:43.807
LIES THE

03:34:46.531 --> 03:34:48.150
ISSUE ON HINGING YOUR 
IMPEACHMENT ON A NONCRIMINAL 

03:34:48.151 --> 03:34:50.183
ABUSE OF POWER ALLEGATION. THE 
FACTS DON'T SUPPORT YOUR CLAIMS.

03:34:50.385 --> 03:34:52.718
NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE USSR
PRESENT IN IMPEACHED

03:34:56.272 --> 03:34:58.507
SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF ABUSE OF 
POWER. EVERY PRESIDENT WAS BEEN 

03:34:58.708 --> 03:35:00.708
IMPEACHED HAS BEEN IMPEACHED FOR
CRIMINAL ACTS.

03:35:16.996 --> 03:35:18.996
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED TO 
PROVE A NONCRIMINAL STANDARD FOR

03:35:19.031 --> 03:35:21.062
ABUSE OF POWER AND HAVE RELIED 
ON HEARSAY AND CONJECTURE. THE 

03:35:21.265 --> 03:35:23.698
DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DO IS 
PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF 

03:35:23.899 --> 03:35:25.899
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MAKE 
THEM THINK THAT WRONGDOING HAS 

03:35:25.932 --> 03:35:27.966
OCCURRED WHERE THERE IS NONE. BY
USING FANCY RHETORIC AND FLOWERY

03:35:28.165 --> 03:35:30.165
LANGUAGE THEY THINK THEY CAN 
CONVINCE A NATION OF THEIR 

03:35:30.198 --> 03:35:32.198
ILL-CONCEIVED IDEAS. DON'T FALL 
FOR IT, AMERICA. I YIELD THE 

03:35:32.233 --> 03:35:33.598
REMAINDER OF MY TIME TO MR. 
JORDAN. 

03:35:33.599 --> 03:35:36.298
&gt;&gt; IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO
TO TAKE SOME OF SONLAND YOU GOT 

03:35:36.498 --> 03:35:38.936
TO TAKE ALL OF IT. IF YOU'RE 
GOING TO MENTION THEM 611 TIMES 

03:35:39.133 --> 03:35:41.567
AND REPORT IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
BUILD YOUR CASE AROUND  THE GUY 

03:35:42.318 --> 03:35:45.433
WHO PRESUMED,  PRESUMED HER WAS 
A QUID PRO QUO, THE GUY WHO HAD 

03:35:45.635 --> 03:35:47.867
TO FILE AN ADDENDUM  TO HIS 
DEPOSITION, IF YOU'RE GOING TO 

03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:52.950
DO ALL THAT YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE
DIRECT CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH 

03:35:53.149 --> 03:35:55.149
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES.

03:35:59.649 --> 03:36:01.682
WHERE HE ASKED MR. PRESIDENT 
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM UKRAINE? 

03:36:01.882 --> 03:36:03.715
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT SAY? 
INTERESTING, SONLAND LEFT THIS 

03:36:03.716 --> 03:36:05.716
OUT OF HIS OPENING 

03:36:10.819 --> 03:36:12.850
STATEMENT, WHAT YOU WANT FROM 
UKRAINE AND THE PRESIDENT SAID I

03:36:13.065 --> 03:36:16.100
WANT NOTHING, NO QUID PRO QUO, I
WANT HIM TO DO WHAT HE SAID . I 

03:36:16.314 --> 03:36:18.948
WANT HIM TO DO WHAT HE RAN ON. 
YOU CAN'T IGNORE THAT. THE ONE 

03:36:19.149 --> 03:36:21.149
PIECE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE, YOU 
WANT ALL THIS PRESUMPTION, YOU 

03:36:21.182 --> 03:36:23.182
WANT ALL THIS ADDENDUM,

03:36:27.883 --> 03:36:30.733
YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME OF SONLAND
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF IT. I 

03:36:30.935 --> 03:36:32.504
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MR. STEVIE . 

03:36:32.505 --> 03:36:39.673
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO MR. GATES. I HAVE 
30 SECONDS. I HAVE 30 SECONDS 

03:36:39.873 --> 03:36:41.873
LEFT BEFORE THEY CUT THE CLOCK.
&gt;&gt;

03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:47.960
I THINK THE GENTLEMAN FOR 
YIELDING, I JUST THINK THE 

03:36:47.994 --> 03:36:49.994
GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE,

03:36:55.100 --> 03:36:57.133
THE DEBATE ON THE LAST SUBJECT 
RELATIONS THAT WE ARE DEALING 

03:36:57.346 --> 03:36:59.367
WITH, THIS IS NOT A RIFLE SHOT 
IMPEACHMENT WITH FACTS AND 

03:36:59.568 --> 03:37:01.600
EVIDENCE, THIS IS A BIRD SHOT, 
HE TALKS ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM 

03:37:01.816 --> 03:37:07.901
YOU KNOW THE CAMPAIGN-FINANCE 
CONCERNS, TO TRUMP UNIVERSITY, 

03:37:08.102 --> 03:37:13.387
CONCERNS ABOUT CHARITIES THIS IS
LIKE PIN THE TAIL ON YOUR 

03:37:13.587 --> 03:37:15.218
FAVORITE IMPEACHMENT VERY 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE

03:37:15.219 --> 03:37:17.219
FOR ONE THING

03:37:20.095 --> 03:37:21.911
TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT ON. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YELLED BACK. 

03:37:21.912 --> 03:37:24.101
WHAT PURPOSE DOES MR. McCLINTOCK
SEEK RECOGNITION? 

03:37:24.102 --> 03:37:27.194
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THAT GENTLEMAN IS REGULATED. 

03:37:27.357 --> 03:37:32.277
&gt;&gt; THE CONSTITUTION INTRODUCES 
THE PRESIDENT WITH 15 WORDS, THE

03:37:32.478 --> 03:37:36.755
EXECUTIVE POWER SHALL BE VESTED 
IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

03:37:36.946 --> 03:37:39.491
STATES OF AMERICA. IT DOES NOT 
VEST ANY AUTHORITY IN LIEUTENANT

03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:44.030
COLONEL'S OF THE NSC, 
AMBASSADORS, STATE DEPARTMENT

03:37:47.719 --> 03:37:48.937
OFFICIALS OR CABINET 
SECRETARIES, THE ONLY 

03:37:48.938 --> 03:37:51.987
AUTHORITIES THAT THESE OFFICIALS
EXERCISE, IS DELEGATED TO THEM 

03:37:52.188 --> 03:37:56.456
BY THE PRESIDENT. SO, ALL OF THE
CRITICISMS AND RESENTMENTS AND 

03:37:56.856 --> 03:37:58.475
PERSONAL AND POLITICAL 
DISAGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE HEARD

03:37:58.476 --> 03:38:00.670
FROM THOSE OFFICIALS ARE 
COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. IT IS 

03:38:00.822 --> 03:38:02.832
DANGEROUS THAT SO MANY OFFICIALS

03:38:06.396 --> 03:38:08.226
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO 

03:38:08.227 --> 03:38:10.464
OVERRIDE PRESIDENTIAL POLICY 
LEAK CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND 

03:38:10.663 --> 03:38:15.344
ACTIVELY WORK TO UNDERMINE A 
LAWFUL DISCHARGE OF THE 

03:38:15.544 --> 03:38:20.830
PRESIDENT'S DUTIES UNDER ARTICLE
2 IF THEIR JUDGMENT CAN REPLACE 

03:38:21.029 --> 03:38:23.265
THAT OF THE PRESIDENT, IT MEANS 
THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED 

03:38:23.466 --> 03:38:25.466
STATES HAVE SIMPLY BEEN REMOVED 
FROM THE EQUATION. SOMEONE SAID 

03:38:25.499 --> 03:38:31.584
DURING THE DISCUSSION TODAY THAT
THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTUALLY 

03:38:31.998 --> 03:38:33.819
COMMITTED REAL CRIMES. THE 
ARTICLE DOES NOT CHARGE SUCH 

03:38:33.820 --> 03:38:37.785
CRIMES. WHY NOT? BECAUSE THERE'S
NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

03:38:43.371 --> 03:38:45.607
THEM. IF THERE WAS EVIDENCE, YOU
KNOW THAT IN A HEARTBEAT THEY 

03:38:45.807 --> 03:38:48.858
WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THESE 
CHARGES, SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY THEY 

03:38:49.058 --> 03:38:51.058
DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THEIR OWN 
RHETORIC. ONE MEMBER SAID, WE 

03:38:51.093 --> 03:38:53.093
ARE NOT RESTRICTED AS THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS, THINK 

03:38:53.125 --> 03:38:58.198
ABOUT WHAT THAT STATEMENT MEANS.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS 

03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:00.435
RESTRICTED BY THE BILL OF 
RIGHTS. THE BILL OF RIGHTS SETS 

03:39:01.198 --> 03:39:03.198
FORTH BASIC

03:39:11.815 --> 03:39:13.815
PRINCIPLES OF DUE PROCESS, THE 
RIGHT TO CONFRONT YOUR ACCUSER, 

03:39:13.833 --> 03:39:16.079
THE RIGHT TO CALL WITNESSES IN 
YOUR DEFENSE, CHARGES HAVE TO BE

03:39:16.279 --> 03:39:18.279
SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE, NOT 
GOSSIP. AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT 

03:39:18.313 --> 03:39:20.335
TO APPEAL TO THE COURTS TO 
PROTECT THESE RIGHTS, YES, THE 

03:39:20.549 --> 03:39:22.549
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS 
RESTRICTED BY THE BILL OF RIGHTS

03:39:22.579 --> 03:39:24.579
BUT OUR BILL OF RIGHTS WITH ITS 
DUE PROCESS RESTRICTIONS, 

03:39:24.598 --> 03:39:29.068
RESTRICTS ALL OF US WHO TAKE THE
OATH OF OFFICE. THAT INCLUDES 

03:39:29.281 --> 03:39:31.858
CONGRESS. WE ARE RESTRICTED TO 
RESPECT

03:39:42.688 --> 03:39:44.507
THESE RIGHTS ALSO. ONLY THE 
MAJORITY IS NOW PLACING 

03:39:44.508 --> 03:39:46.538
THEMSELVES ABOVE THE SUPREME LAW
OF THE LAND. THE LAWFUL EXERCISE

03:39:46.740 --> 03:39:50.607
OF EXECUTIVE POWER IS SIMPLY NOT
UNIMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. THE 

03:39:50.808 --> 03:39:52.439
PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
FAITHFULLY EXECUTING THE LAWS, 

03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:54.764
THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES 
ACT MAKES IT A CRIME TO

03:40:02.390 --> 03:40:04.390
OFFER SOMETHING OF VALUE TO 
SECURE BUSINESS IN A FOREIGN 

03:40:04.422 --> 03:40:06.422
COUNTRY. THE FACTS OF MR. 
BIDEN'S ACTIONS IN THE UKRAINE 

03:40:06.444 --> 03:40:08.444
CERTAINLY LOOK LIKE THEY CROSS 
THAT LINE.

03:40:14.171 --> 03:40:15.990
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO REQUEST COOPERATION

03:40:15.991 --> 03:40:17.621
OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO 
INVESTIGATE POTENTIALLY CORRUPT 

03:40:17.622 --> 03:40:19.038
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN U.S. 
OFFICIALS AND THEIR OWN 

03:40:19.039 --> 03:40:21.039
OFFICIALS? OF COURSE HE DOES.

03:40:27.575 --> 03:40:29.575
DEMOCRATS INTO THE MOST SINISTER
MOTIVES TO THIS REQUEST. NOTHING

03:40:29.606 --> 03:40:31.640
IN THE CONVERSATION SUGGEST 
THAT. DO US A FAVOR BECAUSE OUR 

03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:34.074
COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT 
AND UKRAINE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT 

03:40:34.274 --> 03:40:37.324
IT. THAT'S THE EXACT QUOTE. THE 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 

03:40:37.524 --> 03:40:39.155
ACT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO DETERMINE THAT

03:40:39.156 --> 03:40:44.638
UKRAINE IS TAKING STEPS TO 
COMBAT CORRUPTION BEFORE IT CAN 

03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:47.074
BE RELEASED. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
MADE MUCH OF THE FACT THAT THE 

03:40:47.276 --> 03:40:49.508
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CERTIFIED 
THIS INMATE IN MAY. NUMBER 1 THE

03:40:49.709 --> 03:40:52.509
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE EXERCISES 
NO AUTHORITY INDEPENDENT OF THE 

03:40:52.660 --> 03:40:56.095
PRESIDENT, THE BUCK STILL STOPS 
AT THE PRESIDENT DESK AND

03:41:00.681 --> 03:41:01.897
THE PRESIDENT RETAINS 
RESPONSIBILITY DETERMINED THAT 

03:41:01.898 --> 03:41:03.813
THE FINDINGS OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION REMAIN VALID. 

03:41:03.814 --> 03:41:05.814
PARTICULARLY AS HE ASSESSES THE

03:41:12.465 --> 03:41:14.296
ATTENTION OF THE NEWLY ELECTED 
PRESIDENT AND PARLIAMENT AND 

03:41:14.297 --> 03:41:16.332
LEST WE FORGET, LAST YEAR, THREE
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WROTE TO THE

03:41:16.530 --> 03:41:18.530
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT, DEMANDING 
THAT IT COOPERATE

03:41:28.103 --> 03:41:29.737
IN INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT FROM.
THE DEMOCRATS FOUND ABSOLUTELY 

03:41:29.738 --> 03:41:31.556
NOTHING OBJECTIONABLE ABOUT 
THIS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I SEE 

03:41:31.557 --> 03:41:33.557
IS THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 
HAS THE AUTHORITY AND THE 

03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:35.590
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SUCH A 
REQUEST. SO WHAT'S AT STAKE 

03:41:35.621 --> 03:41:37.038
HERE? THE WORST POSSIBLE 
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE 

03:41:37.039 --> 03:41:39.476
PRESIDENT'S MOTIVES AND 
DISCHARGING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 

03:41:39.689 --> 03:41:45.372
POWERS ARE BEING IMPUTED TO HIM 
BY HIS MOST VITRIOLIC OPPONENTS.

03:41:45.574 --> 03:41:47.554
NOW THERE'S NOTHING 
EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THAT, IT'S 

03:41:47.555 --> 03:41:50.599
CALLED, POLITICS. BUT IF THIS 
CAN BECOME THE NEW STANDARD OF 

03:41:50.758 --> 03:41:53.494
IMPEACHMENT, THAT CONGRESS CAN 
IMPEACH ANY PRESIDENT WHOSE 

03:41:53.695 --> 03:41:57.765
MOTIVES HIS OPPONENTS QUESTION, 
IF THIS IS ALLOWED TO REPLACE 

03:41:57.966 --> 03:41:59.966
TREES AND BRIBERY ANOTHER

03:42:04.465 --> 03:42:06.465
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS AS 
THE STANDARD FOR NULLIFYING A 

03:42:06.499 --> 03:42:07.917
NATIONAL ELECTION AND 
SUBSTITUTING THE JUDGMENT OF 

03:42:07.918 --> 03:42:11.170
CONGRESS  INSTEAD OF THE 
JUDGMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

03:42:11.369 --> 03:42:14.620
WELL THEN NO PRESIDENT CAN MAKE 
ANY DECISION WITHOUT SUBJECTING 

03:42:14.820 --> 03:42:16.820
THE NATION TO THE TRAVESTY GOING
ON TODAY.

03:42:20.718 --> 03:42:22.537
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL BE 
SUBORDINATED TO THE LEGISLATIVE,

03:42:22.538 --> 03:42:24.538
SERVING UP THE PLEASURE OF 
CONGRESS, AND THE SEPARATION OF 

03:42:24.573 --> 03:42:29.350
POWER IS AT THE HEART OF OUR, 
WILL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. 

03:42:29.351 --> 03:42:33.003
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE GUILT BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MOVED TO

03:42:38.588 --> 03:42:39.805
STRIKE. 
&gt;&gt; AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS 

03:42:39.806 --> 03:42:42.400
AMENDMENT WHICH I THINK IS 
PROBABLY ON OF THE MOST TELLING 

03:42:42.554 --> 03:42:47.480
AMENDMENTS, THIS IS THE MOST 
AMORPHOUS AMENDMENT THAT YOU CAN

03:42:47.631 --> 03:42:51.525
HAVE. EVEN WHEN I WAS WAITING 
FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM

03:43:02.559 --> 03:43:04.793
THE CHAIRMAN AND OTHERS AT THE 
PODIUM I WAS ACTUALLY THERE AND 

03:43:04.994 --> 03:43:07.025
WAS BEING INTERVIEWED AND WHEN I
HEARD OF THIS ONE, BEEN 

03:43:07.226 --> 03:43:09.226
CONFIRMED ABUSE OF POWER WAS ONE
OF THEIR ARTICLES OF 

03:43:09.259 --> 03:43:11.091
IMPEACHMENT, IT WAS SIMPLY 
STUNNING AND MY FIRST REACTION 

03:43:11.092 --> 03:43:13.326
HAS RUNG TRUE COMPLETELY HERE 
TODAY, BY MANY OF THE MEMBERS ON

03:43:13.528 --> 03:43:15.144
THE MAJORITY INCLUDING THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE WHO 

03:43:15.145 --> 03:43:17.145
RECENTLY CONFIRMED. ABUSE OF 
POWER FOR ARTICLES OF 

03:43:17.293 --> 03:43:19.293
IMPEACHMENT

03:43:24.496 --> 03:43:26.531
CAN MEAN ANYTHING THEY WANTED TO
MEAN. IT'S THE CARTE BLANCHE 

03:43:26.731 --> 03:43:29.167
COVERAGE, IT'S SAYING WE DON'T 
HAVE A CASE BUT GO OUT AND MAKE 

03:43:29.365 --> 03:43:32.214
IT UP. JUST GO OUT AND SAY WHAT 
YOU DON'T LIKE. IF HE DIDN'T SAY

03:43:32.416 --> 03:43:34.649
SOMETHING NICE TO THIS, DO THIS 
AND THAT WILL COVER YOU, YOU 

03:43:34.850 --> 03:43:36.850
WILL BE OKAY BECAUSE REMEMBER, 
THIS IS ALWAYS ABOUT AN 

03:43:36.883 --> 03:43:39.582
ELECTION. YOU KNOW HOW WE 
CONTINUE TO KNOW THIS? WE KEEP 

03:43:39.733 --> 03:43:41.967
MISQUOTING THE TRANSCRIPT. THEY 
DON'T HAVE THE FAX SO WE KEEP 

03:43:42.727 --> 03:43:47.344
MISQUOTING THE TRANSCRIPTS AIN'T
DO ME A FAVOR. IT'S SIMPLE,

03:43:51.722 --> 03:43:54.357
IF YOU'VE GOT A CASE MAKE IT BUT
DON'T MAKE IT UP BECAUSE YOU 

03:43:54.557 --> 03:43:57.204
DON'T HAVE IT. WHAT WE HAVE HERE
ALSO IS THIS CONTINUAL JUST 

03:43:57.404 --> 03:43:59.404
REPEATED ATTACKS ON THE 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT

03:44:03.694 --> 03:44:05.523
, ZELENSKY. THE REPEATED 
ATTACKS. BECAUSE WE ARE EITHER 

03:44:05.524 --> 03:44:07.524
CLAIMING HE IS A LIAR OR A 
PUPPET

03:44:11.825 --> 03:44:14.259
OR HE IS A POLITICIAN, AN ACTOR 
SO DISREGARD HIM. WOW. THAT'S A 

03:44:14.461 --> 03:44:16.805
LOT OF CONCERN FOR THE UKRAINIAN
PEOPLE, TAKING ON THEIR

03:44:27.666 --> 03:44:29.497
PRESIDENT THAT THEY JUST 
ELECTED. WHEN WE UNDERSTAND AND 

03:44:29.498 --> 03:44:32.140
WE LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS HOW IT 
GETS TO THE PROBLEM. WHEN YOU 

03:44:32.337 --> 03:44:34.771
GET TO A CERTAIN POINT AND YOU 
CAN'T MAKE YOUR CASE, WHEN YOU 

03:44:34.986 --> 03:44:36.986
CAN'T ACTUALLY ADDED UP, WHEN 
YOU HAVE LAW SCHOOL PROFESSORS 

03:44:37.007 --> 03:44:39.453
TELL YOU IF YOU THINK THIS AND 
THIS THEN THE INFERENCE IS OKAY,

03:44:39.654 --> 03:44:41.654
THEN WE HAVE LOWERED THE 
STANDARD WHERE ANYTHING CAN BE 

03:44:41.689 --> 03:44:43.721
BROUGHT IN. THE FACTUAL CASE 
THAT HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE 

03:44:43.922 --> 03:44:46.457
PAST, ALMOST 3 HOURS NOW BY THE 
MINORITY SIDE IS LAID

03:44:52.246 --> 03:44:54.881
BARE THE CASE OF ABUSE OF POWER,
THERE IS NONE. YOU CAN MAKE IT 

03:44:55.095 --> 03:44:57.732
UP, YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER YOU
WANT AND YOU CAN TRY AND SELL 

03:44:57.932 --> 03:45:00.366
THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT
THEY ARE NOT BUYING IT. THEY ARE

03:45:00.578 --> 03:45:02.814
NOT. AND IT'S GOING TO GET 
HARDER AND HARDER FOR MEMBERS TO

03:45:03.017 --> 03:45:05.017
ACTUALLY GO AND SAY, NEXT WEEK

03:45:07.886 --> 03:45:10.533
, WHERE THEY STICK THEIR CARD IN
AND VOTE YES ON THE ABUSE OF 

03:45:10.736 --> 03:45:12.966
POWER THAN ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO 
BACK AND EXPLAIN THAT. IT'S EASY

03:45:13.168 --> 03:45:15.168
IN THIS ROOM.

03:45:20.079 --> 03:45:22.100
YOU'VE GOT HELP FROM YOUR 
COLLEAGUES BUT WHEN YOU ARE BACK

03:45:22.314 --> 03:45:24.332
HOME TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY 
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE DOWN A 

03:45:24.547 --> 03:45:26.547
PRESIDENT, DULY ELECTED OVER 
ABUSE OF POWER BECAUSE SOME OF 

03:45:26.567 --> 03:45:28.399
THE ARGUMENTS WE HEARD THIS 
MORNING? THAT'S AMAZING. THERE 

03:45:28.400 --> 03:45:30.635
IS TRUE SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHAT 
WENT ON IN THE UKRAINE AND IS 

03:45:30.834 --> 03:45:32.834
DEEPLY ROOTED WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT AND BY THE WAY THERE 

03:45:32.866 --> 03:45:35.460
WAS ANOTHER TIME, UKRAINE EIGHT 
WAS HELD, IT'S NOT THE FIRST 

03:45:35.628 --> 03:45:37.628
TIME.

03:45:41.599 --> 03:45:43.599
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, MOST 
PEOPLE WERE AMAZED THAT HE 

03:45:43.633 --> 03:45:45.868
ACTUALLY DOES WHAT HE SAYS HE'S 
GOING TO DO, HE ACTUALLY DOES 

03:45:46.068 --> 03:45:49.007
THOSE KIND OF THINGS. THAT'S 
WHAT TRUE LEADERSHIP DOES.

03:45:56.224 --> 03:45:58.224
OTHER COUNTRIES AID WAS ALSO 
HELD, LEBANON WAS ACTUALLY HELD.

03:45:58.260 --> 03:46:04.362
OTHERS WERE ACTUALLY HELD, THIS 
IS NOT A NEW THING. DO NOT LET 

03:46:04.564 --> 03:46:06.382
THE MAJORITY CONVINCE, TRY TO 
CONVINCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

03:46:06.383 --> 03:46:08.418
THAT WITHHOLDING AID OR NOT 
LOOKING INTO CORRUPTION IS A NEW

03:46:08.618 --> 03:46:10.618
THING, DON'T LET THEM DO IT.

03:46:17.564 --> 03:46:20.200
WHEN YOU ARE HAVING TO PLAY A 
PART YOU HAVE TO DO THAT, YOU 

03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:22.433
HAVE TO MAKE IT UP, IT'S ALL 
INLAND, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE 

03:46:22.634 --> 03:46:24.866
DOING. MR. HALE TESTIFIED ONE OF
THE MORE EGREGIOUS ONES, I HAVE 

03:46:25.078 --> 03:46:27.787
A FRIEND OF MINE WHO TEXTED ME A
FEW MINUTES AGO, AGAIN IT NEEDS 

03:46:27.946 --> 03:46:29.946
TO BE HIT.

03:46:35.637 --> 03:46:37.667
ONE OF THE THINGS PERPETRATED 
THIS MORNING OUT TO THE AMERICAN

03:46:37.868 --> 03:46:39.900
PEOPLE WAS, PEOPLE LOST THEIR 
LIVES IN THE UKRAINE OVER THIS 

03:46:40.101 --> 03:46:42.334
AID. THIS FRIEND OF MINE, WHO 
TEXTED ME A FEW MINUTES AGO, 

03:46:42.548 --> 03:46:45.741
LOST LIMBS ON HIS OWN BODY IN 
DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY. IN A WAR

03:46:45.892 --> 03:46:48.836
ZONE. HE SAYS, DON'T LET THEM 
GET AWAY WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS 

03:46:49.037 --> 03:46:51.270
IS A FUTURE ACT, MR. HALE 
TESTIFIED TO THIS FACT, IN FACT 

03:46:51.487 --> 03:46:53.827
HE REPEATED IT IN HIS 
DEPOSITION, GO TO THE TRANSCRIPT

03:46:56.356 --> 03:46:58.790
. HE SAID THIS WAS FUTURE AID 
AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 

03:46:58.990 --> 03:47:00.990
RUNNING THE ARMY RIGHT THEN.

03:47:04.073 --> 03:47:06.510
RUSSIA HAS INVADED UKRAINE, THEY
ARE FIGHTING, IT IS A HOT WAR. 

03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:09.897
BUT TO BLAME THIS CONVERSATION 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A WEAK 

03:47:10.048 --> 03:47:14.632
CASE? YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND 
THROW THAT INTO SCARE THE 

03:47:14.833 --> 03:47:19.661
AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT'S NOT 
RIGHT. MAKE A CASE, HAVE YOUR 

03:47:19.815 --> 03:47:25.599
FAX, PUT IT IN THE ARTICLE BUT 
WHEN YOU CAN'T DO THAT, YOU GO 

03:47:25.814 --> 03:47:27.834
IN THE BACK ROOM AND YOU START 
WRITING ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 

03:47:28.047 --> 03:47:30.047
AND YOU SAY

03:47:37.992 --> 03:47:40.438
, OH, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. LET'S
PUT SOMETHING IN THERE THAT ALL 

03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:42.672
OF OUR CONFERENCE CAN GET BEHIND
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THE 

03:47:42.875 --> 03:47:44.875
PRESIDENT. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt;

03:47:51.397 --> 03:47:55.463
TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE AISLE, I WILL REMIND

03:47:55.663 --> 03:47:57.663
YOU OF THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:48:01.553 --> 03:48:03.788
RECOVERED AND REVIEW THEM AND 
PUT THEM ON THE RECORD AGAIN FOR

03:48:04.002 --> 03:48:06.438
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. BECAUSE 
FACTS DO MATTER. NOTICE THE 

03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:08.459
CONTRACT BETWEEN THE 
CONVERSATION ON THIS SIDE OF THE

03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:10.694
AISLE, AND THAT. THEY RUN AWAY 
FROM THE FACTS, THEY ARE AFRAID 

03:48:10.908 --> 03:48:12.908
TO ADMIT TO THEMSELVES

03:48:16.380 --> 03:48:18.380
OR TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OF 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR 

03:48:18.416 --> 03:48:20.648
REALLY ADDS UP TO. LET ME JUST 
RECITE THE FACTS, WHEN UKRAINIAN

03:48:20.850 --> 03:48:24.514
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  RAISED THE 
ISSUE OF U.S. MILITARY 

03:48:24.718 --> 03:48:26.718
ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE DURING THE

03:48:32.433 --> 03:48:34.469
JULY 25 CALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REPLIED, QUOTE, I WOULD LIKE YOU

03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:37.105
TO DO US A FAVOR THOUGH, BECAUSE
OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A 

03:48:37.306 --> 03:48:40.155
LOT AND UKRAINE KNOWS A LOT 
ABOUT THAT. CONGRESS 

03:48:40.355 --> 03:48:42.739
APPROPRIATED AND AUTHORIZED $391
MILLION IN SECURITY ASSISTANCE 

03:48:42.896 --> 03:48:44.896
TO

03:48:48.680 --> 03:48:50.680
UKRAINE. ON MAY 23 THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CERTIFY TO

03:48:50.714 --> 03:48:53.564
CONGRESS THAT UKRAINE HAD 
COMPLETED THE REQUISITE 

03:48:53.964 --> 03:48:55.583
ANTICORRUPTION REFORM ACTIONS TO
QUALIFY FOR THE SECURITY 

03:48:55.584 --> 03:48:58.232
ASSISTANCE APPROPRIATED BY 
CONGRESS. THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF 

03:48:58.434 --> 03:49:00.434
DIRECTED THE AID

03:49:04.528 --> 03:49:06.528
TO BE PUT ON HOLD. IN JULY 
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS ASKED 

03:49:06.562 --> 03:49:08.742
PENTAGON STAFF ABOUT THE HOLD ON
MILITARY ASSISTANCE. NO 

03:49:08.947 --> 03:49:12.807
LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY OR 
NATIONAL SECURITY RATIONALE, 

03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:15.795
EXISTS AND THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT
BROUGHT ONE FORWARD,

03:49:19.363 --> 03:49:20.980
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO 
WITHHOLD THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE

03:49:20.981 --> 03:49:22.981
FROM UKRAINE. PROVIDING AID

03:49:27.684 --> 03:49:29.717
TO UKRAINE IS IN THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY INTEREST OF THE UNITED 

03:49:29.917 --> 03:49:31.917
STATES. WITHHOLDING IT IS IN THE
PERSONAL POLITICAL INTEREST OF 

03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:35.000
THE PRESIDENT AND OF PUTIN. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FAILED TO SAY 

03:49:35.202 --> 03:49:37.202
THE WORD CORRUPTION DURING HIS 
APRIL 21 CALL WITH PRESIDENT 

03:49:37.232 --> 03:49:40.886
ZELENSKY,  PRESIDENT TRUMP 
FAILED TO SAY THE WORD 

03:49:41.086 --> 03:49:43.118
CORRUPTION DURING HIS JULY 25 
CALL TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.  THE

03:49:43.332 --> 03:49:47.275
EIGHT TO UKRAINE WAS RELEASED 
ONLY AFTER HOUSE COMMITTEES AND

03:49:55.923 --> 03:49:57.540
ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION INTO 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO

03:49:57.541 --> 03:49:59.374
HOLD THE AID. THE PRESIDENT 
INSTRUCTED ALL WITNESSES FROM 

03:49:59.375 --> 03:50:00.993
THE ADMINISTRATION NOT TO 
TESTIFY AND WITHHELD ALL 

03:50:00.994 --> 03:50:02.994
RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FROM HOUSE 
INVESTIGATORS. ON OCTOBER 3,

03:50:07.094 --> 03:50:09.094
WHEN ASKED BY A REPORTER, WHAT 
HE HOPED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

03:50:09.127 --> 03:50:11.763
WOULD TO FOLLOWING THE JULY 25 
CALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE 

03:50:11.964 --> 03:50:16.647
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, 
WELL, I WOULD THINK THAT IF THEY

03:50:16.848 --> 03:50:21.114
WERE HONEST ABOUT IT, THEY WOULD
START A MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO

03:50:21.316 --> 03:50:26.385
THE BIDENS. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE 
ANSWER. ON OCTOBER 17 AT A PRESS

03:50:26.603 --> 03:50:28.603
BRIEFING IN THE WHITE HOUSE, 
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF NICK 

03:50:28.622 --> 03:50:33.101
MULVANEY SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ABSOLUTELY MENTIONED CORRUPTION 

03:50:33.302 --> 03:50:38.989
RELATED TO THE DNC SERVER DURING
HIS JULY 25 CALL AND THAT SERVER

03:50:39.188 --> 03:50:41.748
WAS PART OF WHY WE HELD THE 
MONEY UP

03:50:46.907 --> 03:50:49.144
.  UPON TAKING A QUESTION FROM A
REPORTER, ATTEMPTING TO CLARIFY 

03:50:49.344 --> 03:50:51.789
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A QUID PRO
QUO,  MULVANEY REPLIED, WE DO 

03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:55.645
THAT ALL THE TIME WITH 
FOREIGN-POLICY, GET OVER IT. LET

03:50:55.845 --> 03:51:01.330
ME REMIND YOU OF A STATEMENT 
THAT DR. FIONA HILL MADE IN HER 

03:51:02.094 --> 03:51:04.094
OPENING STATEMENT

03:51:05.999 --> 03:51:07.833
. IN HER EXTRAORDINARY POWERFUL 
OPENING STATEMENT AN INCREDIBLE 

03:51:07.834 --> 03:51:09.834
TESTIMONY BEFORE THIS CONGRESS

03:51:16.969 --> 03:51:19.818
. SHE SAID AND I QUOTE, IF THE 
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE ELSE IN P OR

03:51:20.020 --> 03:51:22.020
SUBVERTS THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER 

03:51:22.055 --> 03:51:24.055
TO FURTHER A DOMESTIC POLITICAL 
OR PERSONAL INTEREST, THAT IS 

03:51:24.086 --> 03:51:26.417
MORE THAN WORTHY OF YOUR 
ATTENTION. I ASKED MY COLLEAGUES

03:51:27.336 --> 03:51:32.620
RESPECTFULLY, ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THIS DAIS, IS THIS NOT WORTHY

03:51:32.820 --> 03:51:35.163
OF OUR ATTENTION TO UPHOLD THE 
CONSTITUTION

03:51:39.927 --> 03:51:42.576
AND ASK THE PRESIDENT TO DO THE 
SAME? OR DO THEY THINK IT IS 

03:51:42.778 --> 03:51:46.117
PROPER, DO THEY THINK IT'S OKAY,
FOR ANY PRESIDENT, NOT JUST

03:51:52.932 --> 03:51:54.932
THIS ONE BUT FOR ANY PRESIDENT 
TO INVITE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

03:51:54.961 --> 03:51:56.994
INTO OUR ELECTIONS? WITH THAT 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I YIELD TO THE 

03:51:57.195 --> 03:52:01.261
GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE ISLAND. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE GENTLE LADY FROM 

03:52:01.462 --> 03:52:03.495
YIELDING. THERE WAS A LETTER 
SIGNED BY MORE THAN FIVE LEGAL 

03:52:03.695 --> 03:52:06.692
SCHOLARS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM, I 
WOULD LIKE TO READ FROM VERY 

03:52:06.847 --> 03:52:10.283
BRIEFLY. THEY SAY THE PRESIDENT 
CONGRESS CONDUCT IS THE THREAT

03:52:16.697 --> 03:52:18.602
TO OUR DEMOCRACY THAT THE 
FOUNDERS FEARED WHEN THEY 

03:52:18.603 --> 03:52:20.148
INCLUDE THE REMEDY OF 
IMPEACHMENT IN THE CONSTITUTION.

03:52:20.149 --> 03:52:22.149
WE TAKE NO POSITION ON WHETHER 
THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED CRIME 

03:52:22.183 --> 03:52:24.772
BUT CONDUCT CANNOT BE CRIMINAL 
TO BE PEACEABLE. THE STANDARD IS

03:52:24.927 --> 03:52:30.102
CONSTITUTIONAL. THEY GO ON TO 
SAY IMPEACHMENT IS ESSENTIAL 

03:52:31.075 --> 03:52:35.998
REMEDY FOR CONDUCT THAT CORRUPTS
ELECTIONS. I KNOW MY TIME IS 

03:52:36.199 --> 03:52:41.887
ABOUT TO EXPIRE. I WOULD LIKE TO
READ ADDITIONAL PARTS OF THAT. I

03:52:42.089 --> 03:52:44.526
YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE LADY YIELD BACK I 

03:52:45.276 --> 03:52:47.276
RECOGNIZE MYSELF

03:52:52.241 --> 03:52:53.460
. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN, I 

03:52:53.461 --> 03:52:55.707
WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO READ 
BECAUSE THIS AGAIN, IS A LETTER 

03:52:55.907 --> 03:52:57.907
SIGNED BY MORE THAN 500

03:53:07.284 --> 03:53:09.284
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS. AND I 
THINK SOME OF THE CONCLUSION MY 

03:53:09.314 --> 03:53:11.134
COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING 
WITH, IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

03:53:11.135 --> 03:53:12.571
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES AND 
VIOLATIONS OF THE CRIMINAL 

03:53:12.572 --> 03:53:14.587
STATUTE, SO I HOPE THIS WILL 
HELP CLARIFY THAT. THEY WRITE, 

03:53:14.800 --> 03:53:16.800
IMPEACHMENT IS A REMEDY FOR 
GRAVE ABUSES OF THE PUBLIC 

03:53:16.833 --> 03:53:18.450
TRUST. IMPEACHMENT IS AN 
ESPECIALLY ESSENTIAL REMEDY FOR 

03:53:18.451 --> 03:53:20.485
CONDUCT THAT CORRUPTS ELECTIONS.
THE PRIMARY CHECK ON A PRESIDENT

03:53:20.688 --> 03:53:23.158
IS POLITICAL, IF A PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES POORLY VOTERS CAN PUMP 

03:53:23.542 --> 03:53:29.020
PUNISH HIM OR HER AT THE POLLS, 
IF A PRESIDENT WHO CORRUPTS THE 

03:53:29.220 --> 03:53:31.256
SYSTEM OF ELECTIONS TO PLACE 
HIMSELF BEYOND THE REACH OF THIS

03:53:31.458 --> 03:53:33.434
POLITICAL CHECK. THE 
CONSTITUTION ENGINES, GEORGE 

03:53:33.435 --> 03:53:37.757
MASON DESCRIBED IMPEACHMENT, AS 
ATTEMPTS TO OBSERVE THE 

03:53:38.710 --> 03:53:40.710
CONSTITUTION.

03:53:43.645 --> 03:53:45.645
SIMPLY, IF A PRESIDENT XI'S

03:53:54.203 --> 03:53:56.036
AT HIS EFFORTS AT REELECTION, 
TRUSTING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 

03:53:56.037 --> 03:53:58.474
TO SERVE AS A CHECK THROUGH THAT
ELECTION IS NO REMEDY AT ALL. 

03:53:58.669 --> 03:54:01.117
THIS IS WHAT IMPEACHMENT IS FOR.
THEY GO ON TO SAY IN THIS 

03:54:01.318 --> 03:54:03.349
LETTER, WHETHER HIS CONDUCT IS 
CLASSIFIED AS BRIBERY OR HIGH 

03:54:03.552 --> 03:54:05.382
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS IT IS 
CLEARLY IMPEACHABLE UNDER OUR 

03:54:05.383 --> 03:54:08.219
CONSTITUTION.  IN ASKING 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THIS 

03:54:08.419 --> 03:54:10.419
LETTER HAS MORE THAN 500 LEGAL 
SCHOLARS,

03:54:34.223 --> 03:54:36.458
I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE WILL 

03:54:36.661 --> 03:54:38.661
UNDERSTAND THAT THE BASIS OF 
THIS ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT THAT

03:54:38.694 --> 03:54:40.524
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, VIOLATED THE PUBLIC 

03:54:40.525 --> 03:54:42.345
TRUST, UNDERMINES THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES, 

03:54:42.346 --> 03:54:44.346
BETRAYED OUR NATIONAL INTEREST, 
BY USING THE ENORMOUS POWER OF 

03:54:44.378 --> 03:54:46.612
HIS OFFICE. NOT TO ADVANCE THE 
PUBLIC GOOD, NOT TO ADVANCE THE 

03:54:46.824 --> 03:54:48.844
POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN
THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED 

03:54:49.057 --> 03:54:50.875
STATES, TO ADVANCE HIS OWN 
PERSONAL POLITICAL BENEFIT. THAT

03:54:50.876 --> 03:54:52.876
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FRAMERS 
SPOKE ABOUT, THAT'S NOT MY 

03:54:52.911 --> 03:54:54.911
CONCLUSION ALONE, IT WAS THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE SCHOLARS WE 

03:54:54.943 --> 03:54:57.176
HEARD FROM IN OUR HEARINGS, AND 
OR THAN 500 LEGAL SCHOLARS THAT 

03:54:57.376 --> 03:54:59.825
HAVE JOINED US. I HOPE IT'LL PUT
TO REST THIS NOTION THAT YOU 

03:55:00.025 --> 03:55:01.845
HAVE TO VIOLATE A CRIMINAL 
STATUTE. A PRESIDENT COULD 

03:55:01.846 --> 03:55:04.143
DEFACE A POST OFFICE, A MAILBOX,
THAT'S A FEDERAL CRIME. NO ONE 

03:55:04.293 --> 03:55:06.293
WOULD SUGGEST THE PRESIDENT 
COULD BE IMPEACHED FOR THAT. THE

03:55:06.324 --> 03:55:08.345
FRAMERS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
ABUSES OF THE PUBLIC TRUST, A 

03:55:08.559 --> 03:55:11.597
VIOLATION OF THE MOST SACRED 
OATH, TO HONOR THE INTEREST OF 

03:55:11.810 --> 03:55:14.447
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT TO 
ADVANCE YOUR OWN PERSONAL 

03:55:14.646 --> 03:55:19.579
INTERESTS. THESE SCHOLARS IT 
MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN I ASK 

03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:23.689
UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO BE MADE A 
PART OF THE

03:55:28.058 --> 03:55:29.476
RECORD. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SIMPLY POINT OUT A 

03:55:29.477 --> 03:55:31.477
FEW THINGS, NUMBER 1 THAT THE 
IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT NIXON 

03:55:31.511 --> 03:55:38.419
ALTHOUGH HE HAD COMMITTED ANY 
CRIMES, ABUSE OF POWER, 

03:55:38.620 --> 03:55:44.103
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, IT DID 
NOT SPECIFY A SPECIFIC CRIME. I 

03:55:44.305 --> 03:55:47.053
WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE 
MAJORITY STAFF REPORT OF THE

03:55:59.744 --> 03:56:01.978
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN 1974, NOT
JUST NOW, AND I BELIEVE IN 1998 

03:56:02.189 --> 03:56:04.007
CERTAINLY 1974, POINTED OUT THAT
CRIMES AND IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES 

03:56:04.008 --> 03:56:05.839
ARE DIFFERENT THINGS. THERE 
CRIMES WHICH MAY NOT BE 

03:56:05.840 --> 03:56:07.256
IMPEACHABLE THERE ARE 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES WHICH MAY 

03:56:07.257 --> 03:56:09.090
NOT BE CRIMES. AND IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSE, HIGH CRIMES AND 

03:56:09.091 --> 03:56:11.483
MISDEMEANORS, THAT'S A GRAVE AND
SERIOUS  OFFENSE AGAINST THE 

03:56:11.641 --> 03:56:13.641
CONSTITUTION

03:56:15.190 --> 03:56:17.423
. I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE 
FEDERALIST PAGES. I WOULD ALSO 

03:56:17.624 --> 03:56:19.624
SAY ONE OTHER THING. WE HAVE 
REPEATEDLY HEARD THAT THE 

03:56:19.656 --> 03:56:24.524
DEMOCRATS ARE ACCUSING PRESIDENT
ZELENSKY  AND MR. YERMAK OF 

03:56:24.938 --> 03:56:26.938
LYING  BECAUSE

03:56:30.627 --> 03:56:32.456
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SAID HE 
WASN'T PRESSURED. OF COURSE HE 

03:56:32.457 --> 03:56:34.457
SAID HE WASN'T PRESSURED 

03:56:37.731 --> 03:56:39.765
. THE UNITED STATES IS A 
POWERFUL NATION ON WHICH HIS 

03:56:39.969 --> 03:56:43.418
NATION IS DEPENDENT. HE HAS A 
GUN TO HIS HEAD. THE FACT THAT 

03:56:43.618 --> 03:56:46.166
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES UPON WHOM HE DEPENDS FOR.

03:56:47.485 --> 03:56:49.521
FOR HELP IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS,
HAS SHOWN HIMSELF WILLING TO 

03:56:49.722 --> 03:56:55.340
WITHHOLD THAT AID AND TO DO 
OTHER THINGS, BASED ON WHAT HE 

03:56:55.492 --> 03:57:01.022
SAYS. BASED ON WHETHER HE IS 
WILLING TO PLAY ALONG WITH THE

03:57:07.395 --> 03:57:09.395
PRESIDENT FOR HIS PERSONAL AND 
POLITICAL GOALS. OF COURSE HE 

03:57:09.428 --> 03:57:11.662
DENIES HE WAS PRESSURED BECAUSE 
THAT IF HE KNOWS THAT IF HE 

03:57:11.862 --> 03:57:13.862
DIDN'T TONIGHT, THERE MIGHT BE 
HEAVY CONSEQUENCES TO PAY AND 

03:57:13.898 --> 03:57:15.898
YOU CANNOT CREDIT THAT DENIAL

03:57:24.052 --> 03:57:26.086
, WITHOUT ANY ASPERSIONS ON HIS 
CHARACTER, SIMPLY ON THE FACT 

03:57:26.287 --> 03:57:28.724
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES PULLED A GUN TO HIS HEAD.

03:57:28.924 --> 03:57:31.361
I YIELD BACK AND THE QUESTION IS
ON THE AMENDMENT, THOSE IN FAVOR

03:57:31.561 --> 03:57:37.203
SAY I, THE NOSE HABIT. 
&gt;&gt; ROLL CALL IS REQUESTED. 

03:57:37.204 --> 03:57:39.444
&gt;&gt;&gt; [ ROLL CALL ] 

03:59:24.374 --> 03:59:27.774
&gt;&gt;&gt; ANY MEMBERS TO VOTE WHICH 
HAD NOT VOTED?

03:59:33.313 --> 03:59:34.828
MR. RICHMOND YOU ARE NOT 
RECORDED.

03:59:34.829 --> 03:59:36.829
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt;

03:59:40.419 --> 03:59:43.256
ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVEN'T 
VOTED WHO WISH TO VOTE? THE 

03:59:43.470 --> 03:59:45.470
CLERK WILL REPORT.

03:59:50.779 --> 03:59:54.801
MR. SHERMAN THERE ARE 17 EYES 
AND 23 NOSE. 

03:59:54.802 --> 04:00:03.256
&gt;&gt; ANY FURTHER AMENDMENTS? 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN BEST MEGA

04:00:08.856 --> 04:00:10.429
THE GENTLE LADY RESERVES THE 
POINT OF ORDER. 

04:00:10.430 --> 04:00:13.845
&gt;&gt; AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT 
OFFERED BY MR. GATES OF FLORIDA,

04:00:15.305 --> 04:00:21.611
PAGE 3 STRIKE LINES 10 THROUGH 
11 AND INSERT THE FOLLOWING.

04:00:27.549 --> 04:00:29.549
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED 
TO EXPLAIN HIS

04:00:38.519 --> 04:00:39.533
AMENDMENT. 
&gt;&gt; DISTRACTS THE REFERENCE TO 

04:00:39.534 --> 04:00:41.534
JOE BIDEN AS THE CENTER OF THE 
PROPOSED INVESTIGATION AND 

04:00:41.567 --> 04:00:43.567
REPLACES IT WITH THE TRUE TOPIC 
OF THE INVESTIGATION, BURISMA 

04:00:43.589 --> 04:00:45.624
AND HUNTER BIDEN. AN ESSENTIAL 
ELEMENT OF THE DEMOCRATS CASE ON

04:00:45.824 --> 04:00:47.824
ABUSE OF POWER IS THAT THE

04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:59.842
BIDENS DID NOTHING WRONG, IT CAN
ONLY BE AN ABUSE OF POWER AND 

04:01:00.056 --> 04:01:02.076
NOT A CORRECT USE OF POWER IF 
THE PRESIDENT WAS PURSUING 

04:01:02.292 --> 04:01:04.310
SOMETHING UNDER WHICH THERE WAS 
NO REASONABLE BASIS TO ASK A 

04:01:04.524 --> 04:01:06.342
QUESTION ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN AND 
CHARISMA. HUNTER BIDEN AND 

04:01:06.343 --> 04:01:08.343
CHARISMA, WHAT AN INTERESTING 
STORY,

04:01:19.960 --> 04:01:21.780
AND I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERY 
AMERICAN KNOWS, THERE'S 

04:01:21.781 --> 04:01:23.781
SOMETHING UP WITH THAT, $86,000 
A MONTH? NO EXPERIENCE? WORKING 

04:01:23.813 --> 04:01:25.813
FOR SOME FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
WHILE YOUR DAD IS A VICE 

04:01:25.846 --> 04:01:27.846
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? 
IS THERE ANYONE WHO BELIEVES 

04:01:27.879 --> 04:01:30.517
THIS IS OKAY? I KNOW WE HAVE A 
FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES MAYBE WHO 

04:01:30.729 --> 04:01:32.729
ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OR 
MIGHT RUN FOR PRESIDENT, WOULD 

04:01:32.749 --> 04:01:34.996
YOU LET YOUR VICE PRESIDENT HAVE
THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER OR FAMILY 

04:01:35.198 --> 04:01:37.198
MEMBER OUT LIGHTING FOR SOME 
FOREIGN COMPANY? MAYBE I'LL USE 

04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:39.229
LANGUAGE FAMILIAR TO THE FORMER 
VICE PRESIDENT. ON, MAN. THIS 

04:01:39.250 --> 04:01:44.135
LOOKS DIRTY AS IT IS. HUNTER 
BIDEN WAS MAKING MORE THAN FIVE 

04:01:44.336 --> 04:01:46.572
TIMES MORE THAN A BOARD MEMBER 
FOR EXXON MOBIL. I'VE HEARD OF 

04:01:47.321 --> 04:01:51.653
THAT COMPANY. I WANTED TO READ 
UP ON HUNTER BIDEN AND LEARN 

04:01:51.855 --> 04:01:54.086
MORE ABOUT HIM I FOUND THIS VERY
EXTENSIVE PROFILE IN THE NEW 

04:01:54.288 --> 04:01:56.288
YORKER AND HERE'S WHAT IT SAYS,

04:02:09.554 --> 04:02:11.789
HUNTER SAID AT THAT POINT, HE 
HAD NOT SLEPT FOR SEVERAL DAYS 

04:02:11.989 --> 04:02:14.022
DRIVING EAST ON INTERSTATE 10, 
JUST BEYOND PALM SPRINGS HE LOST

04:02:14.223 --> 04:02:16.669
CONTROL OF HIS CAR WHICH JUMPED 
THE MEDIAN AND SKIDDED TO A STOP

04:02:16.871 --> 04:02:18.904
ON THE SHOULDER OF THE WESTBOUND
SIDE. HE CALLED HERTZ, WHICH 

04:02:19.103 --> 04:02:21.339
CAME TO COLLECT THE DAMAGED CAR 
AND GAVE HIM A SECOND RENTAL. 

04:02:21.540 --> 04:02:24.175
THE HERTZ RENTAL OFFICER TOLD ME
HE FOUND A CRACK PIPE IN THE CAR

04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:26.410
ONE OF THE CONSULS A LINE OF 
WHITE POWDER RESIDUE. THE 

04:02:26.624 --> 04:02:28.241
ATTORNEY, HERTZ CALLED THE 
PRESCOTT POLICE DEPARTMENT AT 

04:02:28.242 --> 04:02:29.875
OFFICERS FILED A NARCOTICS 
OFFENSE REPORT, LISTING ITEMS 

04:02:29.876 --> 04:02:31.876
SEIZED IN THE CAR

04:02:47.181 --> 04:02:48.809
INCLUDING THE PLASTIC BAG 
CONTAINING A WHITE POWDER 

04:02:48.810 --> 04:02:50.427
SUBSTANCE, SECRET SERVICE 
BUSINESS CARD, CREDIT CARDS AND 

04:02:50.428 --> 04:02:52.428
HUNTER BIDEN'S DRIVERS LICENSE. 
THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL 

04:02:52.461 --> 04:02:54.461
EVIDENCE, AND I DON'T WANT TO 
MAKE LIGHT OF ANYBODY'S 

04:02:54.494 --> 04:02:56.528
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES, I KNOW 
THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING HARD TO

04:02:56.729 --> 04:02:58.729
SOLVE THOSE THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

04:02:58.761 --> 04:03:00.593
THAT BURISMA HIRED HUNTER BIDEN 
TO RESOLVE THEIR INTERNATIONAL 

04:03:00.594 --> 04:03:02.594
DISPUTES WHEN HE COULD NOT 
RESOLVE HIS OWN DISPUTE WITH 

04:03:02.628 --> 04:03:04.859
HERTZ RENTAL CAR OVER LEAVING 
COCAINE AND A CRACK PIPE IN THE 

04:03:05.059 --> 04:03:07.059
CAR. IT CONTINUES.

04:03:09.527 --> 04:03:11.964
HUNTER STAYED IN LOS ANGELES FOR
ABOUT A WEEK, HE SAID HE NEEDED 

04:03:12.163 --> 04:03:14.396
TO GET AWAY AND FORGET SOON 
AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN L.A. HE 

04:03:14.611 --> 04:03:16.844
SAID HE ASKED A HOMELESS MAN 
WHERE HE COULD BUY CRACK. HUNTER

04:03:17.045 --> 04:03:21.108
SAID THE MAN TOOK HIM TO A 
NEARBY HOMELESS AND CAP WERE A 

04:03:21.310 --> 04:03:23.370
NARROW PASSAGEWAY BETWEEN THE 
TENSE, SOMEONE PUT A GUN TO HIS 

04:03:23.571 --> 04:03:27.838
HEAD BEFORE REALIZING THAT HE 
WAS THE BUYER, HE RETURNED TO 

04:03:28.040 --> 04:03:30.834
BUY MORE CRACK A FEW TIMES THAT 
WEEK. AGAIN, NOT CASTING ANY 

04:03:30.994 --> 04:03:32.994
JUDGMENT

04:03:35.359 --> 04:03:37.359
ON ANY CHALLENGES SOMEONE GOES 
THROUGH IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE 

04:03:37.394 --> 04:03:39.427
BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 
THIS WAS THE GUY WANDERING 

04:03:39.627 --> 04:03:42.678
THROUGH HOMELESS AND CAN'T 
ENCOMPASS BUYING CRACK THAT WAS 

04:03:43.078 --> 04:03:45.078
GETTING $86,000 A MONTH TO 
BURISMA HOLDING. THAT MIGHT BE 

04:03:45.116 --> 04:03:47.116
ONE OF THE WAYS

04:03:53.843 --> 04:03:56.278
WHEN ABC ASKED, DO YOU THINK YOU
WOULD'VE GOTTEN THIS JOB IN THE 

04:03:56.490 --> 04:03:58.510
ABSENCE OF YOUR DAD BEING THE 
VICE PRESIDENT? WELL, HE SAID, 

04:03:58.724 --> 04:04:00.958
PROBABLY NOT. AND THEN I LOOKED 
TO THE RECORD EVIDENCE. AND I 

04:04:01.159 --> 04:04:04.811
LOOKED AT THE TESTIMONY OF MR. 
KENT, MR. KENT WAS ONE OF THE 

04:04:05.012 --> 04:04:07.042
WITNESSES THEY CALLED ON THE 
FIRST DAY. HE SAID THE REASON 

04:04:07.257 --> 04:04:09.690
WAS SO DIRTY THAT OUR OWN 
EMBASSY HAD TO PULL OUT OF THE 

04:04:09.890 --> 04:04:11.890
JOINT SPONSORSHIP WITH THEM. 
WHEN

04:04:15.376 --> 04:04:16.998
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH WAS BEING
PREPPED FOR SENATE CONFIRMATION,

04:04:16.999 --> 04:04:18.830
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS SO 
WORRIED ABOUT THE CORRUPTION 

04:04:18.831 --> 04:04:22.484
AROUND BURISMA AND HUNTER BIDEN,
THAT THEY HELD SPECIAL PREP 

04:04:22.686 --> 04:04:24.718
MOMENTS TO TRY AND GET READY FOR
THE INEVITABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

04:04:24.919 --> 04:04:29.800
THIS OBVIOUS CORRUPTION THAT THE
PRESIDENT ASKED ABOUT. MR. KENT 

04:04:30.001 --> 04:04:32.034
AGAIN ONE OF THEIR WITNESSES 
FROM THE FIRST DAY, ALSO GAVE 

04:04:32.235 --> 04:04:34.268
TESTIMONY, THAT THE REASON A, 
THAT THE HEAD OF BURISMA HAVE 

04:04:34.468 --> 04:04:36.468
STOLEN $23 MILLION

04:04:39.955 --> 04:04:43.001
IN THE USA THE U.K. AND HE PAID 
A BRIBE TO GET OFF THE HOOK. SO 

04:04:43.202 --> 04:04:45.437
IT'S NOT AS IF HER EASEMENT IS 
PULLING OUT NEW PLAYS, THEIR 

04:04:45.638 --> 04:04:50.118
PLAYBOOK IS TO DO DIRTY STUFF 
AND THEN GO AND PAY TRIBES AND 

04:04:50.321 --> 04:04:52.647
HIRE THE PEOPLE NECESSARY TO 
MAKE THOSE PROBLEMS GO AWAY.

04:05:01.088 --> 04:05:03.320
THIS IS WHY THE MINORITY HEARING
ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT BY THE 

04:05:03.521 --> 04:05:05.754
WAY. YOU WONDER WHY REPUBLICANS 
ARE SO ANGRY THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

04:05:05.956 --> 04:05:08.189
A HEARING TO PUT ON OUR OWN 
WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE AND YOU 

04:05:08.390 --> 04:05:11.037
MAY WONDER WHY IF THEY FEEL SO 
GOOD ABOUT THE CASE WHY DID THEY

04:05:11.239 --> 04:05:13.270
BLOCK OUR ABILITY TO PUT IN 
EVIDENCE, IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE 

04:05:13.471 --> 04:05:15.704
THE ABILITY TO SHOW THAT BURISMA
IS CORRUPT. WE HAVE THE ABILITY 

04:05:15.918 --> 04:05:17.918
TO SHOW THAT HUNTER BIDEN IS 
CORRUPT. AND THAT TOTALLY 

04:05:17.938 --> 04:05:19.971
ESCALATES THE PRESIDENT. BECAUSE
THERE'S NO WAY OF UNITED STATES 

04:05:20.173 --> 04:05:24.037
OF AMERICA, THAT HONESTLY 
PURSUING ACTUAL CORRUPTION IS IN

04:05:24.239 --> 04:05:26.239
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE, THAT'S

04:05:29.111 --> 04:05:31.344
WHY I OFFER THE AMENDMENT AND I 
ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE 

04:05:31.557 --> 04:05:32.974
FOR IT. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I WITHDRAW MY 

04:05:32.975 --> 04:05:35.912
POINT OF ORDER.
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN? 

04:05:35.913 --> 04:05:37.913
&gt;&gt;

04:05:39.477 --> 04:05:41.660
THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.

04:05:44.965 --> 04:05:46.535
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

04:05:46.536 --> 04:05:50.648
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN I RISE IN 
OPPOSITION TO THIS AMENDMENT AND

04:05:50.849 --> 04:05:55.998
I WOULD SAY THAT THE POT CALLING
THE KETTLE BLACK IS NOT 

04:05:56.153 --> 04:06:04.667
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO. I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT MEMBERS IF ANY 

04:06:05.066 --> 04:06:09.133
HAVE HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH 
SUBSTANCE ABUSE INVESTED IN DUI,

04:06:09.334 --> 04:06:13.688
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IF I DID, I 
WOULDN'T RAISE IT

04:06:18.281 --> 04:06:20.457
AGAINST ANYONE ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. I DON'T THINK IT'S 

04:06:20.606 --> 04:06:22.606
PROPER

04:06:25.382 --> 04:06:28.232
. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK, WE'VE 
GOT TO GET BACK DOWN TO WHAT IS 

04:06:28.432 --> 04:06:34.274
MOST IMPORTANT HERE THIS IS A 
QUESTION THAT STANDS OUT LIKE A

04:06:37.781 --> 04:06:40.015
BIG THROBBING SORT SO INSIDE OF 
A SHOE THAT'S TOO SMALL. AND 

04:06:40.216 --> 04:06:45.287
THAT IS THIS QUESTION, IS IT 
EVER OKAY FOR A PRESIDENT OF THE

04:06:45.499 --> 04:06:50.369
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, TO 
INVITE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN 

04:06:51.130 --> 04:06:53.316
AN UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN?

04:07:08.820 --> 04:07:16.052
&gt;&gt; IS THE GENTLEMAN YIELDING? 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN HAS THE TIME. 

04:07:16.053 --> 04:07:18.053
&gt;&gt;

04:07:21.853 --> 04:07:24.198
THE SILENCE WAS AND IS 
DEAFENING, AND THERE WILL BE

04:07:27.949 --> 04:07:30.181
PLENTY OF TIME FOR YOU TO 
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION AND I 

04:07:30.396 --> 04:07:32.828
WOULD INVITE YOU TO DO SO. I 
GAVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OF ABOUT

04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:35.580
10 OR 15 SECONDS WHILE YOU CAN 
GET YOUR STORY TOGETHER

04:07:40.145 --> 04:07:42.982
AND NOBODY CAME UP WITH A STORY.
SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU MOVE TO 

04:07:43.181 --> 04:07:45.215
STRIKE THE LAST WORD AND EXPLAIN
THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

04:07:45.428 --> 04:07:48.667
IT'S NEVER PROPER FOR A UNITED 
STATES PRESIDENT TO HOLD A 

04:07:49.081 --> 04:07:54.767
FOREIGN COUNTRY OVER A BARREL TO
MAKE THEM DO THAT PRESIDENT'S 

04:07:55.525 --> 04:08:02.366
PERSONAL BIDDING AND HOLDING 
NEEDED SECURITY SIX,

04:08:09.197 --> 04:08:11.631
ASSISTANCE, DANGLING IT, I'LL 
GIVE IT TO YOU IF YOU DO THIS. I

04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:14.221
MEAN, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED. IT'S LIKE THE AMERICAN

04:08:14.381 --> 04:08:21.175
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.
THOSE ARE THE FACTS, THE 

04:08:21.377 --> 04:08:25.185
PRESIDENT SAID IT, WHEN HE 
RELEASED THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE 

04:08:25.339 --> 04:08:30.421
SUMMARY OF THAT PHONE CALL ON 
JULY 25, THE SUMMARY

04:08:34.992 --> 04:08:36.992
OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN WORDS, 
SHOWS THAT THE PRESIDENT TRIED 

04:08:37.023 --> 04:08:40.675
TO GET PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO 
INTERFERE  IN THE UPCOMING 

04:08:41.627 --> 04:08:43.627
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

04:08:45.557 --> 04:08:48.139
THAT IS ESTABLISHED BY THE 
FACTS, SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT 

04:08:52.862 --> 04:08:54.894
HUNTER BIDEN AND THEY HAVE SAID 
THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE 

04:08:55.095 --> 04:08:57.743
REPEATEDLY, UP UNTIL THEY START 
TALKING ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN 

04:08:58.144 --> 04:09:00.144
HAVING SOME SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
PROBLEMS. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH

04:09:00.171 --> 04:09:03.520
WAYS MUST BE HONEST, THIS IS 
ABOUT OUR CONSCIENCE

04:09:09.726 --> 04:09:11.954
, THE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATION, 
THE CONSCIENCE OF MY FRIENDS ON 

04:09:12.169 --> 04:09:15.515
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. DO 
YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW

04:09:16.636 --> 04:09:21.104
THIS TO GO UNADDRESSED, WHAT THE
PRESIDENT DID, BECAUSE WE ARE A 

04:09:21.708 --> 04:09:23.708
COUNTRY OF PRESIDENT

04:09:28.408 --> 04:09:31.258
, WE ARE A COUNTRY OF RULE OF 
LAW, WE ARE A COUNTRY OF NORMS 

04:09:31.874 --> 04:09:33.892
AND TRADITIONS. ARE WE GOING TO 
ALLOW THE VIOLATION OF OUR 

04:09:34.643 --> 04:09:42.026
NORMS, OUR TRADITIONS, OUR LEGAL
PRECEDENTS, BECAUSE AFTER ALL, 

04:09:42.427 --> 04:09:45.226
LIBRARY WAS NOT A CRIME, THERE 
WAS NO CRIMINAL CODE WHEN THE 

04:09:45.382 --> 04:09:50.909
FRAMERS PASS THE CONSTITUTION 
BUT THEY SAID BRIBERY IN THERE 

04:09:51.059 --> 04:09:53.108
AND WHAT BRIBERY MEANT WAS, I'M 
OFFERING YOU

04:10:04.566 --> 04:10:06.812
SOMETHING IF YOU DO SOMETHING 
FOR ME. I'LL GIVE YOU THIS IN 

04:10:07.013 --> 04:10:09.248
OTHER WORDS, YOU GIVE ME THIS, 
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. THAT'S WHAT 

04:10:09.448 --> 04:10:11.684
WE HAD IN THIS CASE, THAT'S WHAT
BRIBERY MEANS, IT DOESN'T DEPEND

04:10:11.884 --> 04:10:14.533
ON A STATUTE, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT
WE KNOW WAS DONE. AND SO, LET'S 

04:10:15.298 --> 04:10:17.167
NOT GET BOGGED DOWN IN 
TECHNICALITIES AND IN CHARACTER 

04:10:17.168 --> 04:10:22.853
ASSASSINATION. LET'S KEEP OUR 
EYE ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN 

04:10:23.055 --> 04:10:25.055
THIS CASE AND WHETHER OR NOT OUR
CONSCIENCES

04:10:29.155 --> 04:10:31.590
DICTATE THAT WE DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT, WE CAN'T LET IT GO 

04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:36.461
UNADDRESSED. AND THE WAY THAT WE
DEAL WITH THIS GRAVE ABUSE OF 

04:10:36.662 --> 04:10:41.142
THE PUBLIC TRUST IS WITH THE 
DRASTIC ACTION THAT IT REQUIRES 

04:10:41.902 --> 04:10:45.410
BECAUSE THIS IS A DRASTIC 
CIRCUMSTANCE. THE DRASTIC ACTION

04:10:46.173 --> 04:10:52.110
IS IMPEACHMENT AND THAT'S WHY WE
ARE HERE TODAY. AND I ASKED MY 

04:10:52.311 --> 04:10:54.552
COLLEAGUES TO LET YOUR 
CONSCIENCE BE YOUR GUIDE. I 

04:10:54.744 --> 04:10:56.744
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.

04:11:01.243 --> 04:11:03.228
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN I MOVED TO 
STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:05.229
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, MY MIND IS 
WOBBLED BY THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

04:11:05.511 --> 04:11:12.013
GEORGIA SAYING THAT BRIBERY WAS 
OKAY UNTIL 1787 WHEN THE 

04:11:12.214 --> 04:11:17.296
CONSTITUTION WAS ADOPTED AND TWO
YEARS LATER WHEN CONGRESS PASSED

04:11:17.497 --> 04:11:22.982
THE FIRST CRIMINAL CODE, FIRST 
OF ALL THERE'S A COMMON LAW 

04:11:23.182 --> 04:11:26.128
DEFINITION OF BRIBERY, I THINK 
PEOPLE REALIZE THAT

04:11:29.887 --> 04:11:32.335
BRIBERY WAS NO GOOD BUT WE ALSO 
HAVE CRIMINAL CODES IN EACH OF 

04:11:33.098 --> 04:11:35.098
THE 13

04:11:38.220 --> 04:11:39.637
INDEPENDENT STATES, COLONIES 
BEFORE THE DECLARATION OF 

04:11:39.638 --> 04:11:40.853
INDEPENDENCE. 
&gt;&gt; WILL THE GENTLEMAN ANSWER MY 

04:11:40.854 --> 04:11:42.854
QUESTION? 
&gt;&gt; NO, I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU.

04:11:45.336 --> 04:11:52.440
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN HAS THE TIME. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. THE SECOND THING IS, IF

04:11:52.640 --> 04:11:56.039
YOU, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
AISLE, TO LEAVE THAT

04:12:00.774 --> 04:12:03.409
JOE BIDEN IS A MAN WHO TELLS THE
TRUTH, YOU OUGHT TO SUPPORT THIS

04:12:03.608 --> 04:12:05.964
AMENDMENT. BECAUSE JOE BIDEN, 
EVER SINCE HUNTERS

04:12:14.992 --> 04:12:16.810
INVOLVEMENT WITH BURISMA HAS 
REPEATEDLY ASKED WHETHER HE MADE

04:12:16.811 --> 04:12:18.844
ANY ARRANGEMENTS TO GET HUNTER 
THIS REALLY CUSHY JOB. AND HE 

04:12:19.047 --> 04:12:23.113
SAID NO. OR MY SONS BUSINESS 
INVOLVEMENT OR MY SONS AND I'M 

04:12:23.313 --> 04:12:27.582
NOT INVOLVED IN THAT. SO YOU PUT
JOE BIDEN'S IN YOUR ARTICLES OF 

04:12:27.783 --> 04:12:32.654
IMPEACHMENT, WHEN THE REAL 
MALEFACTOR IS HUNTER BIDEN. 

04:12:32.868 --> 04:12:35.664
HUNTER IS NOT RUNNING FOR 
ANYTHING. AND

04:12:45.461 --> 04:12:47.494
IF THE MALEFACTOR IS HUNTER 
BIDEN, I GUESS YOUR CLAIM THAT 

04:12:47.695 --> 04:12:49.524
THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO 
INFLUENCE THE 2020 ELECTION, 

04:12:49.525 --> 04:12:52.162
WOULD GO OUT THE WINDOW. BUT IF 
YOU THINK THAT JOE BIDEN IS A 

04:12:52.361 --> 04:12:55.812
MAN WHO TELLS THE TRUTH, AND 
I'LL GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE

04:12:56.026 --> 04:12:59.064
DOUBT BECAUSE I THINK HE 
DESERVES IT. THEN LET'S GET RID 

04:12:59.276 --> 04:13:02.112
OF JOE BIDEN IN THE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT, SUBSTITUTE HIS SONS

04:13:02.313 --> 04:13:04.313
NAME IN THERE, AND

04:13:08.815 --> 04:13:10.648
PERCEIVE. I CHALLENGE YOU, 
BECAUSE EVERYONE OF YOU THAT 

04:13:10.649 --> 04:13:13.191
WILL VOTE NO ON THIS AMENDMENT 
IS GOING TO BE SAYING,

04:13:20.200 --> 04:13:22.635
I THINK THAT JOE BIDEN IS A 
LIAR. IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT 

04:13:22.836 --> 04:13:25.686
JOE BIDEN IS A LIAR, VOTE YES. I
YIELD THE BALANCE OF MY TIME TO 

04:13:25.886 --> 04:13:27.886
MR. GAETZ. 

04:13:31.372 --> 04:13:33.404
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
AGAIN, IT'S IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE

04:13:33.604 --> 04:13:35.638
THE BURDEN OF PROOF HERE. IT'S 
THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE SAYING, 

04:13:35.838 --> 04:13:39.895
ANY QUESTION ABOUT THE BIDEN 
SITUATION, BURISMA, IT COULD 

04:13:40.111 --> 04:13:42.129
ONLY BE AN ABUSE OF POWER. I 
THINK THIS AMENDMENT REALLY 

04:13:42.345 --> 04:13:44.726
REFLECTS HOW THE PRESIDENT WAS 
USING HIS POWER PERFECTLY. 

04:13:44.875 --> 04:13:46.875
ENTIRELY

04:13:49.046 --> 04:13:51.817
APPROPRIATELY. IT ALSO SHOWS HOW
SCARED THEY ARE OF THE FACTS. IF

04:13:52.013 --> 04:13:57.367
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL 
IN THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN, 

04:13:57.565 --> 04:13:59.907
WORK WITH THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY,
IF WE ARE ABLE TO

04:14:07.119 --> 04:14:09.153
BRING FORWARD HUNTER BIDEN, IF 
WE ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE 

04:14:09.353 --> 04:14:11.353
BIAS OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER, THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD SEE, WE 

04:14:11.386 --> 04:14:13.421
ARE NOT IN THIS DEBATE AND THIS 
DISCUSSION, THAT THE PRESIDENT 

04:14:13.622 --> 04:14:15.622
ANYTHING WRONG OR

04:14:22.961 --> 04:14:24.391
IMPEACHABLE, WE ARE HERE 
FUNDAMENTALLY BECAUSE THEY 

04:14:24.392 --> 04:14:26.690
CANNOT ACCEPT THE FACT THAT HE 
WON THE 2016 ELECTION. I THINK 

04:14:26.840 --> 04:14:28.859
ALL AMERICANS KNOW THE PRESIDENT
HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT TO 

04:14:29.060 --> 04:14:31.060
ACCEPT THEIR STANDARD WOULD MEAN
THAT IF SOMEONE ANNOUNCES THAT 

04:14:31.096 --> 04:14:33.637
THEY ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN INSTANT

04:14:37.801 --> 04:14:40.022
IMMUNITY DEAL FOR ANYTHING THEY 
WOULD EVER DO. I MEAN, ARE THEY 

04:14:40.236 --> 04:14:42.056
REALLY SAYING, THAT IF JOE 
BIDEN, HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA, 

04:14:42.057 --> 04:14:44.092
WERE ENGAGED IN SOME CORRUPT ACT
THAT JUST BECAUSE JOE BIDEN 

04:14:44.293 --> 04:14:49.378
ANNOUNCED THE PRESIDENCY, THAT 
WOULD SOMEHOW ABSOLVE HIM OF THE

04:14:49.579 --> 04:14:51.196
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY? IT'S A 
LUDICROUS POSITION. MAYBE IT'S 

04:14:51.197 --> 04:14:54.650
INFORMED BY THE FACT THAT YOU 
ALL GOT A LITTLE LUCKY ON THE 

04:14:54.851 --> 04:14:58.304
HILLARY CLINTON STUFF, SHE 
THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS IN 

04:14:58.518 --> 04:15:00.518
A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THAT 
HER CRIMES DIDN'T HAVE TO BE 

04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:02.550
HELD TO ACCOUNT

04:15:07.253 --> 04:15:10.088
IN A WAY, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE 
THE CASE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT 

04:15:10.303 --> 04:15:12.536
SHOULDN'T BE THE STANDARD IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND I'M

04:15:12.736 --> 04:15:15.532
GLAD THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT 
WHO IS AT TIMES, SKEPTICAL OF 

04:15:15.684 --> 04:15:17.684
THIS

04:15:22.487 --> 04:15:24.305
FOREIGN AID, WHO DOES PUT 
AMERICA FIRST THAT UNDERSTANDS 

04:15:24.306 --> 04:15:26.139
THAT IN CORRUPT PLACES, THE 
RESOURCES WE PROVIDE DON'T 

04:15:26.140 --> 04:15:29.075
ALWAYS MAKE IT TO AN AREA OF 
NEED BUT WE CONCLUDE WITH THIS,

04:15:37.920 --> 04:15:39.551
ONCE THE MEETINGS HAPPENED THAT 
DEMONSTRATED THAT PRESIDENT 

04:15:39.552 --> 04:15:41.584
ZELENSKY WAS A TRUE REFORMER, 
THAT HE WASN'T CORRUPT, THAT HE 

04:15:41.785 --> 04:15:43.820
WAS HONEST, HONEST FROM THE 
POINT OF HIS CAMPAIGN ALL THE 

04:15:44.019 --> 04:15:46.455
WAY UP UNTIL THE POINT WHEN HE 
SAID THERE WAS NO PRESSURE PUT 

04:15:46.656 --> 04:15:48.890
ON HIM OR HIS GOVERNMENT FOR THE
STATE.  YOU ACCEPT THAT 

04:15:49.091 --> 04:15:50.924
PROPOSITION, IT'S VERY CLEAR 
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ENTIRELY 

04:15:50.925 --> 04:15:52.960
APPROPRIATE IN THOSE QUESTIONS 
I'VE GOT TO SAY, NOW WE HAVE 

04:15:53.161 --> 04:15:55.193
REACHED THE POINT IN TIME WHERE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN'T THE ONLY 

04:15:55.394 --> 04:15:57.213
PRESIDENT BEING ATTACKED IN THIS
HEARING. THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

04:15:57.214 --> 04:16:00.679
TENNESSEE WENT AFTER PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AS AN ACTOR, 

04:16:00.881 --> 04:16:02.913
POLITICIAN, THEY PRESUME HE WAS 
A LIAR WHEN HE SAID THERE'S 

04:16:03.114 --> 04:16:08.388
NOTHING WRONG. 
&gt;&gt; MY NAME WAS CALLED CAN I 

04:16:08.603 --> 04:16:10.319
RESPOND? 
&gt;&gt; IT JUST SHOWS THE ABSURDITY 

04:16:10.320 --> 04:16:15.049
-- 
&gt;&gt; I WAS ASKING IF I COULD 

04:16:15.199 --> 04:16:17.630
RESPOND BECAUSE MY NAME WAS 
CALLED. 

04:16:17.631 --> 04:16:21.541
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD.

04:16:21.542 --> 04:16:23.542
&gt;&gt;

04:16:28.093 --> 04:16:30.093
THE LADY IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE CHAIRMAN. THIS IS

04:16:30.128 --> 04:16:33.314
ABOUT DISTRACTION, DISTRACTION, 
DISTRACTION. THREE HOURS SAYING 

04:16:33.581 --> 04:16:39.267
THEY DID NOT TARGET THE VIOLENCE
NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT HE DID 

04:16:39.468 --> 04:16:41.658
SO WHICH IS IT? I'M HOLDING THE 
CLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED 

04:16:41.803 --> 04:16:47.802
CONVERSATION AND LET ME JUST 
CLARIFY A CERTAIN POINT, AND 

04:16:48.003 --> 04:16:51.554
THAT POINT IS THAT I DID READ 
THE TRANSCRIPT AND IT DID SAY US

04:16:53.286 --> 04:16:57.094
, BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S NOTE THAT EVEN 

04:16:57.252 --> 04:17:00.736
SUGGESTED THAT THE QUESTION THAT
HE ASKED

04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:09.910
BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN 
TESTIMONY BY MR. GOLDMAN WHO 

04:17:09.942 --> 04:17:12.323
OBVIOUSLY WENT THROUGH EVERY 
ASPECT OF THIS, I ASKED THE 

04:17:12.478 --> 04:17:16.444
QUESTION, ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT 
THE PRESIDENT SAID ANYTHING FROM

04:17:17.206 --> 04:17:19.206
THE NOTES THAT ARE

04:17:22.742 --> 04:17:24.777
GIVEN THE BRIEFING THAT IS GIVEN
BY THOSE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 

04:17:24.976 --> 04:17:28.429
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. STAFF 
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

04:17:28.629 --> 04:17:30.864
COUNCIL, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, 
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ON 

04:17:31.278 --> 04:17:35.747
CORRUPTION. HE DIDN'T SPEAK 
ANYTHING ABOUT CORRUPTION THAT 

04:17:35.946 --> 04:17:38.382
HE WAS BRIEFED ON. AND IF YOU GO
THROUGH THE CALL, HE CONTINUES 

04:17:38.582 --> 04:17:43.581
TO MENTION THE BIDEN'S. AND SO, 
THIS AGAIN, IS ABOUT UKRAINE.

04:17:48.748 --> 04:17:50.748
THE PRESIDENT DID ASK UKRAINE, 
THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, A 

04:17:50.769 --> 04:17:54.380
VULNERABLE LEADER OF A COUNTRY 
THAT IS FLEDGLING AND TRYING TO 

04:17:54.545 --> 04:17:56.545
SURVIVE

04:17:58.087 --> 04:18:00.724
. NOW LET ME SAY THAT I INTEND 
TO INTRODUCE INTO THE RECORD, AN

04:18:00.938 --> 04:18:07.224
ARTICLE THAT INDICATED VERY 
CLEARLY, THAT PEOPLE DID DIE. 

04:18:07.640 --> 04:18:11.023
TRUMP FROZE MILITARY AID AS 
UKRAINIANS SOCIALIST

04:18:14.541 --> 04:18:20.190
-- I ASKED CONSENT TO SUBMIT 
THAT TO THE RECORD. THE FACTS 

04:18:20.341 --> 04:18:29.783
ARE, -- THE FACTS ARE, PRESIDENT
TRUMP PROVIDED $510 MILLION IN 

04:18:29.983 --> 04:18:35.600
EIGHT IN 2017 AND 359 MILLION IN
2018 BUT HE WANTED TO STOP IN 

04:18:35.797 --> 04:18:37.797
2019

04:18:40.139 --> 04:18:42.171
, THE YEAR OR MONTHS BEFORE THE 
2020 ELECTION. IN ADDITION, 

04:18:42.929 --> 04:18:47.251
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADVISORS 
CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

04:18:48.012 --> 04:18:50.012
INVESTIGATION, 2016

04:18:51.721 --> 04:18:53.549
ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE 
BIDEN'S WERE NOT U.S. POLICY. 

04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:55.550
AND AS WELL, THEY HAVE DEBUNKED 
ANY ASSOCIATION

04:19:01.067 --> 04:19:03.635
THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING TO THE 
IMPROPRIETY OF THE FORMER VICE 

04:19:03.782 --> 04:19:06.443
PRESIDENT AND HIS SERVICE AS IT 
RELATED TO UKRAINE.

04:19:10.403 --> 04:19:12.437
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE 

04:19:12.637 --> 04:19:17.920
STATE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED THAT 
UKRAINE HAD MET ALL BENCHMARKS 

04:19:18.121 --> 04:19:20.556
AND THE AID SHOULD BE RELEASED, 
THAT IS THE POLICY OF THE UNITED

04:19:20.771 --> 04:19:22.993
STATES OF AMERICA. THERE WAS NO 
NEED FOR THIS PRESIDENT TO AN 

04:19:23.207 --> 04:19:28.077
ESSENCE, TRY TO MAKE UP HIS OWN 
POLICY. IN HIS OWN STATEMENT OF 

04:19:29.029 --> 04:19:33.964
ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, AND I 
ASKED UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO HAVE 

04:19:34.167 --> 04:19:36.965
THOSE IN THE RECORD, THIS FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE, NOTHING IN THIS

04:19:37.117 --> 04:19:39.117
SAID TO DISCUSS CORRUPTION

04:19:42.706 --> 04:19:45.075
. WHY? BECAUSE UKRAINE HAD 
ALREADY MET THE STANDARDS OF 

04:19:45.227 --> 04:19:47.227
INDEPENDENT

04:19:50.423 --> 04:19:52.423
EXECUTIVE AGENCIES THAT THEY HAD
MET THAT STANDARD OF CORRUPTION,

04:19:52.456 --> 04:19:56.523
THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
RELEASED. AND WE WELL KNOW AS 

04:19:56.725 --> 04:19:58.725
THE PROCESS OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER
AND THE TIMING THAT PRESIDENT 

04:19:59.307 --> 04:20:02.145
ZELENSKY , DESPERATE FOR MONEY, 
PEOPLE DYING IN THE FIELD, WAS 

04:20:02.298 --> 04:20:07.384
ASKED TO DO A CNN ANNOUNCEMENT. 
AND HE WAS GOING TO BE

04:20:12.765 --> 04:20:14.398
ONE OF CNN'S WELL-KNOWN SHOWS 
DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL 

04:20:14.399 --> 04:20:16.429
POLITICS. BUT IT WAS STOPPED IN 
ITS TRACKS, AS TESTIFIED BY 

04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:21.916
WITNESSES, UNDER OATH, BECAUSE 
OF THE WHISTLEBLOWERS STATEMENT.

04:20:22.116 --> 04:20:24.552
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, THERE IS 
SOME REPRESENTATION OF CRIME, 

04:20:25.315 --> 04:20:28.490
CRIME, CRIME. FIRST OF ALL, OUR 
SCHOLARS INDICATE

04:20:38.359 --> 04:20:40.190
THAT THESE ARE IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSES, THE CONDUCT OF THE 

04:20:40.191 --> 04:20:42.023
PRESIDENT IS IMPEACHABLE AND 
THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SHOW.

04:20:42.024 --> 04:20:44.056
BUT AS I INDICATED YESTERDAY, 
THIS MY FRIENDS, IS A LEGAL 

04:20:44.257 --> 04:20:46.291
DOCUMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. IT
IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT. YOU CAN 

04:20:47.050 --> 04:20:50.344
BREACH AND VIOLATE THE LAW OF 
THE CONSTITUTION. THERE ARE 

04:20:51.109 --> 04:20:54.569
CONSTITUTIONAL CRIMES, AND THE 
VASTNESS OF THE IMPEACHMENT 

04:20:54.725 --> 04:21:02.126
PROCESS DOES INCLUDE THE EXCESS 
OF POWER I THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

04:21:02.340 --> 04:21:04.340
UNITED STATES. NOW, I KNEW 
BARBARA JORDAN AND MY FRIENDS 

04:21:04.359 --> 04:21:06.359
WANTED TO QUOTE HER

04:21:13.915 --> 04:21:15.951
, SHE ALSO SAID, THE FRAMERS 
CONFIDED IN THE CONGRESS OF 

04:21:16.151 --> 04:21:18.584
POWER IF NEED BE, TO REMOVE A 
PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO STRIKE A 

04:21:18.784 --> 04:21:20.615
DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN A 
PRESIDENT SWOLLEN WITH POWER AND

04:21:20.616 --> 04:21:22.616
PRESERVATION OF THE INDEPENDENCE
OF THE EXECUTIVE. YOU CAN 

04:21:23.001 --> 04:21:25.904
VIOLATE THE CRIMES OF THE 
CONSTITUTION, ABUSE OF POWER 

04:21:26.668 --> 04:21:28.668
INCLUDES THAT,

04:21:33.210 --> 04:21:34.182
THIS AMENDMENT SHOULD BE 
DEFEATED. 

04:21:34.183 --> 04:21:35.608
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE LADY, THE TIME HAS
EXPIRED. 

04:21:35.609 --> 04:21:37.609
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIR? 
&gt;&gt;

04:21:40.731 --> 04:21:42.701
MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

04:21:42.702 --> 04:21:44.702
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ANSWER MY COLLEAGUE
FROM GEORGIA MR. JOHNSON'S 

04:21:44.785 --> 04:21:49.054
QUESTION THAT HE ASKED BEFORE. 
IS IT EVER OKAY TO INVITE A 

04:21:49.818 --> 04:21:54.337
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO BECOME 
INVOLVED IN AN ELECTION 

04:21:54.538 --> 04:21:57.387
INVOLVING A POLITICAL OPPONENT, 
THE ANSWER IS YES. IT BETTER BE,

04:21:57.588 --> 04:22:03.077
WE DO IT ALL THE TIME. HAVE YOU 
THAT QUICKLY FORGOTTEN HOW THE 

04:22:03.277 --> 04:22:05.712
TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION 
PROCEEDED QUESTION MARK THE 

04:22:06.328 --> 04:22:11.000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ASKED GREAT
WRITTEN AND ITALY AND AUSTRALIA 

04:22:11.958 --> 04:22:14.968
TO ASSIST IN ITS INVESTIGATION

04:22:18.921 --> 04:22:22.316
OF A PERSON WHO WAS A POLITICAL 
OPPONENT, FROM THE OPPOSITE 

04:22:22.475 --> 04:22:28.162
PARTY I KEEP HEARING OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN YOU CAN'T INVESTIGATE

04:22:29.679 --> 04:22:33.546
POLITICAL OPPONENTS. WE HAVE A 
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO WAS

04:22:33.746 --> 04:22:35.746
AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE 
AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, 

04:22:35.779 --> 04:22:40.048
INVESTIGATING HIS POLITICAL 
OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP AT THE 

04:22:40.249 --> 04:22:44.920
VERY MOMENT HE WAS RUNNING TO 
REPLACE HIM AS PRESIDENT. MY 

04:22:45.121 --> 04:22:49.591
CALLING ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE, 
MR. CASTRO WAS INVESTIGATING 

04:22:49.792 --> 04:22:51.823
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE VERY SAME
MOMENT HIS BROTHER WAS RUNNING 

04:22:52.024 --> 04:22:56.292
TO REPLACE PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE ONLY ONE 

04:22:56.493 --> 04:23:00.963
WITH THE REALLY LEGITIMATE 
REASON TO BE DOING IT. HE IS THE

04:23:01.727 --> 04:23:03.727
CHIEF EXECUTIVE.

04:23:12.133 --> 04:23:14.133
CHIEF EXECUTIVE. WE ARE IN THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RIGHT? WE 

04:23:14.166 --> 04:23:15.998
DO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTION, 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRESIDENT

04:23:15.999 --> 04:23:20.469
IS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. AND ALL
POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

04:23:20.669 --> 04:23:22.703
DERIVES FROM THE PRESIDENT. AND 
THE PRESIDENT CAN AND SHOULD ASK

04:23:22.904 --> 04:23:24.941
FOR ASSISTANCE FROM FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTS AND ONGOING CRIMINAL

04:23:25.138 --> 04:23:29.605
INVESTIGATIONS. THERE WAS AN 
ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 

04:23:29.806 --> 04:23:35.495
INTO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2016, 
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR, HAD LONG 

04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:40.177
BEFORE THE APPOINTED U.S. 
ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM TO 

04:23:40.379 --> 04:23:44.590
INVESTIGATE EXACTLY THAT ISSUE. 
IT WASN'T JUST APPROPRIATE, IT 

04:23:44.755 --> 04:23:51.089
WAS ABSOLUTELY THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. AND HUNTER 

04:23:51.241 --> 04:23:59.067
BIDEN? THE PRESIDENT HAS, AS THE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THE ABILITY TO 

04:23:59.828 --> 04:24:03.221
ASK ABOUT MATTERS WHERE THERE IS
A

04:24:13.287 --> 04:24:15.519
PRIMA FACIE CASE OF CORRUPTION, 
WHAT DO WE HAVE IN RESPECT TO 

04:24:15.719 --> 04:24:17.952
HUNTER BIDEN? TONS OF MONEY FOR 
A POSITION WHERE HE HAS NO 

04:24:18.153 --> 04:24:19.988
UKRAINIAN EXPERIENCE, WHERE HE 
HAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH UKRAINE 

04:24:19.989 --> 04:24:22.120
OR WITH ENERGY AND AT THE VERY 
SAME TIME,

04:24:27.102 --> 04:24:28.920
THE UKRAINIANS WERE DECIDING 
THAT HUNTER BIDEN WAS THE 

04:24:28.921 --> 04:24:30.755
PERFECT PERSON TO GET THAT 
SWEETHEART DEAL, THE CHINESE 

04:24:30.756 --> 04:24:32.989
WERE DECIDING THAT HUNTER BIDEN 
WAS THE PERFECT PERSON TO GET A 

04:24:33.190 --> 04:24:37.658
SWEETHEART DEAL TO MANAGE $1.5 
MILLION IN FINANCIAL ASSETS. AND

04:24:37.858 --> 04:24:41.620
WHEN THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT 
WANTED TO INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION

04:24:46.596 --> 04:24:48.831
, LIKE WE ALL KEEP TALKING 
ABOUT, THEY NEED TO, THEY START 

04:24:49.031 --> 04:24:52.084
INVESTIGATING THE REASON AND 
WHAT HAPPENS, JOE BIDEN SAYS YOU

04:24:52.284 --> 04:24:54.677
BETTER FIRE THAT PROSECUTOR 
INVESTIGATING CORRUPTION

04:25:04.877 --> 04:25:07.314
INTO BURISMA, OR YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO GET $1 BILLION AND SIX 

04:25:07.526 --> 04:25:08.944
HOURS LATER, THAT'S WHAT 
HAPPENED. THAT'S CALLED 

04:25:08.945 --> 04:25:10.980
INFLUENCE PEDDLING, THAT IS A 
CRIME. AND THERE IS A PRIMA 

04:25:11.181 --> 04:25:14.632
FACIE CASE OF THAT. AND IT'S 
ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE FOR A 

04:25:14.832 --> 04:25:17.148
PRESIDENT TO ASK ABOUT THAT. I 
YIELD TO MY FRIEND

04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:23.767
. 
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO THE

04:25:23.768 --> 04:25:25.768
COMMENTS FROM THE GENTLE LADY 
FROM TEXAS SHE SAID THE 

04:25:25.799 --> 04:25:27.832
PRESIDENT MADE UP HIS OWN 
POLICY, WELL THAT'S HOW IT WORKS

04:25:28.033 --> 04:25:31.035
IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU GET YOUR 
NAME ON A BALLOT, YOU RUN FOR 

04:25:31.186 --> 04:25:35.151
OFFICE, YOU GO TALK TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY EVALUATED 

04:25:35.350 --> 04:25:37.350
ALL AND ON ELECTION DAY

04:25:43.674 --> 04:25:45.908
THEY DECIDE WHO THEY WANT MAKING
THE POLICY, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS 

04:25:46.122 --> 04:25:48.122
IN OUR COUNTRY. IT'S NOT THE 
UNELECTED PEOPLE, TELLING THE 

04:25:48.142 --> 04:25:50.142
ELECTED INDIVIDUAL HOW WE DO 
THINGS. BECAUSE THE ON ELECTED 

04:25:50.177 --> 04:25:52.177
PEOPLE AREN'T DIRECTLY 
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE. IS 

04:25:52.210 --> 04:25:56.880
WHAT MAKES OUR SYSTEM THE BEST, 
THE GREATEST, AND WHEN YOU TURN 

04:25:57.082 --> 04:25:59.530
THAT ON ITS HEAD, THAT'S WHEN 
YOU GET PROBLEMS. AND WE SAW IT 

04:25:59.730 --> 04:26:01.730
HAPPEN, BECAUSE WE SAW

04:26:15.570 --> 04:26:17.570
CHUCK'S ESSAY ON 2017, WHEN YOU 
MESS WITH THE INTELLIGENCE 

04:26:17.602 --> 04:26:19.634
COMMUNITY, THEY HAVE SIX WAYS 
FROM SUNDAY AT GETTING BACK AT 

04:26:19.835 --> 04:26:21.867
YOU. THAT IS A SCARY STATEMENT 
BECAUSE THAT IS SAYING THE 

04:26:22.068 --> 04:26:24.505
UNELECTED PEOPLE CAN GET BACK AT
THE PERSON WHO PUT THEIR NAME ON

04:26:24.718 --> 04:26:26.955
A BALLOT AND GOT ELECTED TO HIGH
OFFICE. THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN 

04:26:27.154 --> 04:26:29.188
THIS SITUATION. SO, FOR SOMEONE 
IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO

04:26:29.393 --> 04:26:31.425
SAY THE PRESIDENT MADE UP HIS 
OWN POLICY AND SOMEHOW THAT'S 

04:26:31.624 --> 04:26:34.263
WRONG, THAT SHOULD BE A 
FRIGHTENING POSITION TO TAKE BUT

04:26:34.464 --> 04:26:36.464
I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE TODAY. IN THEIR 

04:26:36.498 --> 04:26:38.970
QUEST TO GO AFTER THIS PRESIDENT
TAKING STATEMENTS LIKE THAT 

04:26:39.135 --> 04:26:41.135
STATEMENT BY OUR COLLEAGUE AND 
STATEMENTS BY SENATOR SCHUMER. I

04:26:41.733 --> 04:26:43.733
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE

04:26:48.271 --> 04:26:49.247
? 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

04:26:49.248 --> 04:26:54.574
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE ISSUES FOR THE 
ELECTION AND THERE ARE ISSUES 

04:26:54.774 --> 04:26:59.242
FOR THIS COMMITTEE. THE BEHAVIOR
OF VICE PRESIDENTS BIDEN SON AND

04:26:59.455 --> 04:27:02.849
FRANKLY THE BEHAVIOR OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TWO SONS AND 

04:27:02.995 --> 04:27:07.172
DAUGHTER MAY BE DISCUSSED IN THE
ELECTION. BUT HERE, WE ARE 

04:27:07.774 --> 04:27:12.654
TALKING ABOUT THE ABUSE OF 
PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY, THE 

04:27:13.417 --> 04:27:17.326
PRESIDENT MUST TAKE CARE THAT 
THE LAWS BE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED.

04:27:18.087 --> 04:27:23.008
WE KNOW, FROM THE EMAILS FROM 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO THE 

04:27:23.223 --> 04:27:25.223
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,

04:27:27.691 --> 04:27:32.357
THAT THE UKRAINIANS KNEW THAT 
THE AIDE WAS BEING WITHHELD, 

04:27:32.759 --> 04:27:34.591
THAT'S DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. WE 
ALSO KNOW, THAT WHATEVER WAS 

04:27:34.592 --> 04:27:36.592
GOING ON THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT 
LIKE

04:27:42.514 --> 04:27:44.549
WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT SON AND 
THE VICE PRESIDENT, THAT WAS 

04:27:44.749 --> 04:27:48.000
KNOWN IN 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018,
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL VICE 

04:27:48.202 --> 04:27:51.805
PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS BEATING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE POLLS, 

04:27:51.955 --> 04:28:00.801
THAT THIS ISSUE WAS RAISED, TO 
TRY AND FORCE A FOREIGN COUNTRY 

04:28:01.202 --> 04:28:06.084
TO INVENT AN INVESTIGATION TO BE
USED POLITICALLY. THAT IS NOT 

04:28:06.486 --> 04:28:08.486
SEEING THAT THE LAWS ARE

04:28:12.375 --> 04:28:14.206
FAITHFULLY EXECUTED. THAT IS AN 
ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY 

04:28:14.207 --> 04:28:16.541
AND I WOULD YIELD NOW TO THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA.

04:28:20.094 --> 04:28:25.981
&gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE HOURS 
SINCE I MADE THIS POINT I GUESS 

04:28:26.194 --> 04:28:29.189
IT NEEDS TO BE MADE AGAIN FROM 
TIME TO TIME, WE CAN'T SIMPLY 

04:28:29.357 --> 04:28:33.297
ALLOW THE MISCHARACTERIZATION 
AND THE MISSTATEMENT OF THE 

04:28:33.499 --> 04:28:35.646
RULES, THE HISTORY OF THE RULES,
AND HOUSE RESOLUTIONS

04:28:39.800 --> 04:28:42.365
, WE CAN'T STAND FOR IT, I WANT 
TO ADDRESS AGAIN

04:28:48.278 --> 04:28:53.819
IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT IS 
THE CASE OVER 50 YEARS AGO WHEN 

04:28:54.019 --> 04:28:57.469
THE RULE WAS WRITTEN AND SAID 
IT'S NORMAL PROCEDURE FOR 

04:28:57.885 --> 04:29:04.374
WITNESSES REPRESENTING BOTH 
SIDES TO REPRESENT TESTIMONY AT 

04:29:04.788 --> 04:29:10.271
HEARINGS, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED 
AT THE DECEMBER 4 MEETING LET'S 

04:29:10.474 --> 04:29:15.555
BE HONEST ABOUT THE RULES, AND 
HOUSE RESOLUTION 660 IT PROVIDES

04:29:16.314 --> 04:29:18.314
AN OPPORTUNITY

04:30:34.106 --> 04:30:41.565
&gt;&gt;   AMBASSADOR VOLKER, TRUMP 
APPOINTEE, THEY ALL CONFIRMED 

04:30:42.010 --> 04:30:45.402
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESSURED A
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO TARGET AN 

04:30:45.682 --> 04:30:48.183
AMERICAN CYST FROM POLITICAL 
GAIN AND AT THE SAME TIME HELD 

04:30:48.591 --> 04:30:52.977
WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION 391 $391 
MILLION IN MILITARY AID 

04:30:54.672 --> 04:30:57.884
UNDERMINING AMERICA'S NATIONAL 
SECURITY. LET'S LOOK AT 

04:30:58.104 --> 04:31:01.194
AMBASSADOR VOLKER'S TESTIMONY.  
HE TESTIFIED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF 

04:31:01.409 --> 04:31:04.439
RAISING THE 2016 ELECTIONS OF 
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, ALL OF 

04:31:05.199 --> 04:31:08.270
THESE THINGS I CONSIDERED TO BE 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  

04:31:11.680 --> 04:31:15.326
WHAT WAS HIS RESPONSE?  IT WAS 
PRETTY SIMPLE.  QUOTE.  I THINK 

04:31:15.965 --> 04:31:17.965
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST VICE 

04:31:20.650 --> 04:31:23.771
PRESIDENT BIDEN A SELF-SERVING 
AND NOT CREDIBLE.  THAT'S WHAT 

04:31:24.201 --> 04:31:31.208
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.  I YIELDBACK.
&gt;&gt;  CHAIRMAN, I YIELD BACK. 

04:31:31.209 --> 04:31:34.079
&gt;&gt; THE YOUNG LADY YIELDS BACK.  

04:31:38.629 --> 04:31:42.455
WE SEEK RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; IN SUPPORT OF THE AMENDMENT. 

04:31:42.745 --> 04:31:44.884
&gt;&gt; DESIRE TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

04:31:44.885 --> 04:31:47.909
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS READY. 

04:31:47.910 --> 04:31:53.649
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING, WE'RE
HEARING FROM THE SAME PEOPLE 

04:31:55.394 --> 04:32:03.211
ACCUSING US OF COVERING UP, NOT 
WILLING TO FACE THE TRUTH.  

04:32:03.426 --> 04:32:06.701
THEY'RE THE SAME ARGUMENTS WE'VE
BEEN HEARING FOR 3 YEARS NOW.  

04:32:07.016 --> 04:32:09.016
FIRST IT WAS ACCUSING 

04:32:12.291 --> 04:32:17.092
US NOT BEING WILLING TO FACE THE
FACTS AND THE PRESIDENT IN 

04:32:17.312 --> 04:32:20.887
COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.  THOSE 
TURNED OUT TO BE LIES.  WE WERE 

04:32:21.092 --> 04:32:24.371
RIGHT, AND THOSE NOT FACING THE 
TRUTH WERE THE ONES NOT FACING 

04:32:24.581 --> 04:32:28.142
THE TRUTH.  WE HEARD ABOUT ALL 
KINDS OF OTHER ALLEGATIONS, AND 

04:32:28.361 --> 04:32:31.371
WE SAID WAIT, THAT DOESN'T 
APPEAR TO BE SUPPORTIVE, OR WE 

04:32:31.602 --> 04:32:34.543
WEREN'T FACING THE TRUTH.  AND 
IT WAS A LOT OF MEDIA SUPPORT 

04:32:34.758 --> 04:32:36.758
FOR THOSE POSITIONS.  

04:32:39.093 --> 04:32:41.093
BUT WE STILL 

04:32:44.968 --> 04:32:51.378
PERSISTED THAT WE WERE THE ONES 
THAT WERE RIGHT.  AND WE WERE 

04:32:51.593 --> 04:32:55.189
RIGHT. THEY HAPPEN WRONG, AND 
WE'RE NOT HEARING ANYONE COME IN

04:32:55.409 --> 04:33:03.399
AND SAY WE'RE REALLY SORRY WHEN 
WE ACCUSED YOU OF NOT BEING 

04:33:03.639 --> 04:33:07.005
SAFE.  YOU WERE RIGHT IT WAS NO 
RUSSIA COLLUSION.  YOU WERE 

04:33:07.225 --> 04:33:11.790
RIGHT.  IT WAS NO EXTORG, AND MY
FRIENDS ACROSS THE AISLE KEEP 

04:33:11.996 --> 04:33:15.586
CHANGING THE SUBJECT.  WHAT THE 
CALL MADE CLEAR IS THAT WE'RE 

04:33:16.292 --> 04:33:21.532
INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT ABOUT 
IF IT WAS UKRAINIAN COLLUSION OR

04:33:21.742 --> 04:33:28.278
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION. 
NOW, IT'S AMAZING HOW THE 

04:33:28.678 --> 04:33:31.243
MAJORITY CAN TAKE TWO POSITIONS 
THAT 

04:33:34.248 --> 04:33:38.770
COUNTER INDICATE EACH OTHER. 
FIRST OF ALL, YOU SAID IT WAS NO

04:33:39.185 --> 04:33:43.405
EFFORT BY REPUBLICANS INCLUDING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP 

04:33:43.980 --> 04:33:46.440
INTERFERENCE FROM FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES.  WE HEAR THAT OVER 

04:33:47.105 --> 04:33:52.861
AND OVER INCLUDING YESTERDAY AND
TODAY.  AND REALLY THE ONLY WAY 

04:33:53.076 --> 04:33:57.716
TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT PRESIDENT
OBAMA REFUSED TO DO, IF YOU 

04:33:57.931 --> 04:34:01.685
REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA 
BELITTLED PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

04:34:01.915 --> 04:34:06.960
CANDIDATE TRUMP FOR SAYING HE 
CONCERNED ABOUT OUTSIDE 

04:34:07.295 --> 04:34:10.524
INTERFERENCE, AND IN FACT, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A MOCKERY 

04:34:11.164 --> 04:34:17.910
ABOUT THOSE WHO THEY THOUGHT HE 
MIGHT MOCK SOMEONE WHO WOULD 

04:34:18.244 --> 04:34:21.074
INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTIONS. HE
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT 

04:34:21.754 --> 04:34:23.824
OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE BECAUSE 
APPARENTLY HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT 

04:34:24.614 --> 04:34:28.234
THE OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE WOULD 
HELP HILLARY CLINTON, AND WE 

04:34:28.444 --> 04:34:31.862
HEARD IT WAS PEOPLE CERTAINLY 
ACCUSED IN UKRAINE OF DOING ALL 

04:34:32.092 --> 04:34:35.722
THEY COULD TO HELP HILLARY 
CLINTON.  IN FACT, IT WAS 

04:34:35.972 --> 04:34:41.447
UNHEARD OF TO HAVE A FOREIGN 
AMBASSADOR IN OUR COUNTRY STEP 

04:34:41.657 --> 04:34:44.277
UP AND COME OUT WITH SUPPORT FOR
HILLARY CLINTON.  SO WHAT WE 

04:34:44.487 --> 04:34:46.487
CONTINUE TO SEE IS 

04:34:49.858 --> 04:34:51.858
PROJECTING SOMEBODY ON THEIR 

04:34:55.595 --> 04:34:59.200
SIDE ENGAGES IN ILLEGAL OR 
IMPROPER CONDUCT, AND THAT'S 

04:35:00.285 --> 04:35:04.443
WHAT THEY ACCUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP
OF DOING, AND ALL OF THIS 

04:35:06.243 --> 04:35:09.343
SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS ABOUT 
POLITICAL PURPOSES, AND I MEAN 

04:35:09.583 --> 04:35:15.386
THIS IS THE TRANSCRIPT FROM 1943
WHEN PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WAS 

04:35:15.616 --> 04:35:20.636
TALKING TO MARSHAL STALIN.  HE'S
TALKING TO STALIN. THIS IS 

04:35:20.897 --> 04:35:25.774
APPARENTLY A MEETING, AND HE 
WANTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT 

04:35:26.388 --> 04:35:28.388
INTERNAL AMERICAN POLITICS.  

04:35:31.549 --> 04:35:36.089
AND FROM STENOGRAPHERS, THEY SAY
THAT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WAS 

04:35:36.314 --> 04:35:40.854
THERE IN THE UNITED STATES, 6 TO
7 MILLION AMERICANS, 

04:35:41.468 --> 04:35:43.824
ABSTRACTION, THE POLITICAL MAP, 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR 

04:35:44.159 --> 04:35:48.599
VOTES, AND HE WAS EXPLAINING HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO GO PUBLIC.  HE 

04:35:49.339 --> 04:35:52.614
DIDN'T CARE BASICALLY WHEN THE 
SOVIET UNION TOOK OVER POLAND.  

04:35:53.169 --> 04:35:57.456
HE DIDN'T CARE WHEN THEY CUT 
DOWN POLAND'S BORDERS FROM THE 

04:35:57.665 --> 04:36:02.275
EAST TO THE WEST, AND HE GOES ON
TO SAY, JOKINGLY THAT WHEN THE 

04:36:02.891 --> 04:36:04.891
SOVIET 

04:36:07.901 --> 04:36:09.901
ARMIES ACUPAY

04:36:11.980 --> 04:36:14.970
OCCUPY AND INVADE AND ACUPAY, HE
DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO WAR BUT 

04:36:15.685 --> 04:36:18.574
CONTINUES TO EMPHASIZE THINGS HE
CAN'T GO PUBLIC WITH.  THESE 

04:36:18.899 --> 04:36:22.049
THINGS HAVE GONE ON BY DEMOCRATS
FOR MANY DECADES.  

04:36:26.339 --> 04:36:29.894
AND HERE THEY COME AFTER THE ONE
GUY, HE WANTS TO GET TO THE 

04:36:30.139 --> 04:36:33.145
BOTTOM OF 2016 FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE, WHAT DO THEY 

04:36:33.420 --> 04:36:37.225
ACCUSE HIM OF?  GETTING FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE.  NO, YOU CAN'T 

04:36:37.595 --> 04:36:40.831
RULE OUT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 
UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS. YOU 

04:36:41.058 --> 04:36:44.556
CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.  WELL, 
I GUESS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN

04:36:44.781 --> 04:36:48.451
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, BUT THIS HAS 
GOT TO STOP BEFORE IT GOES TO 

04:36:48.666 --> 04:36:53.392
YOU MUCH FURTHER.  I YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK, 

04:36:58.182 --> 04:37:00.927
AND SEEK RECOGNITION.  

04:37:10.385 --> 04:37:14.711
WHAT PURPOSE ARE YOU SEEKING 
RECOGNITION? 

04:37:14.712 --> 04:37:19.781
&gt;&gt; FOR A STRIKE. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

04:37:19.782 --> 04:37:23.358
&gt;&gt; I HAD YOU WERE RECOGNIZING 
THE WRONG GUY THAT SHOULD HAVE 

04:37:24.218 --> 04:37:29.228
BEEN BIDEN AND THAT UKRAINE WAS 
THE THIRD MOST CORRUPT NATION ON

04:37:29.453 --> 04:37:33.172
EARTH AND THAT HUNTER BIDEN HAD 
JUST PUT HIMSELF RIGHT SNACK DAB

04:37:33.532 --> 04:37:37.162
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT 
CORRUPTION, AND EVEN THOUGH 

04:37:37.452 --> 04:37:41.152
DEMOCRATS AND MANY OF THEIR 
FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA WOULD HAVE 

04:37:44.753 --> 04:37:50.903
YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS BURISMA, 
BIDEN CORRUPTION, THAT THIS WAS 

04:37:51.382 --> 04:37:55.640
ALL A VAST RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY
ALLEGATION, WHEN IN ACTUALLY, IT

04:37:56.880 --> 04:38:02.760
WAS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
THAT RAISED THIS ISSUES FIRST.  

04:38:03.380 --> 04:38:09.030
BACK IN 2015 GEORGE KENT RAISED 
HIS CONCERNS ABOUT BIDEN TO THE 

04:38:13.114 --> 04:38:15.114
OFFICE, AND THE FORMER 
AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE MARIE 

04:38:15.994 --> 04:38:19.756
YOVANOVITCH, SORRY ABOUT THAT 
SAID SHE WAS COACHED BY THE 

04:38:19.992 --> 04:38:23.172
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ON HOW TO 
ANSWER 

04:38:27.402 --> 04:38:31.477
PESKY QUESTIONS ABOUT BITEEN AND
BURISMA THAT MIGHT ARISE IN HER 

04:38:31.697 --> 04:38:35.807
INTELLIGENCE CONFERENCE.  AND 
NEARLY EVERY PERSON AGREED THAT 

04:38:37.477 --> 04:38:40.845
HUNTER BIDEN'S BURISMA DEAL 
CREATED AT THE VERY LEAST A 

04:38:41.290 --> 04:38:44.363
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  YET THE 
DEMOCRATS ON THE INTELLIGENCE 

04:38:44.864 --> 04:38:47.635
COMMITTEE AND NOW DEMOCRATS IN 
THIS COMMITTEE ARE DETERMINED TO

04:38:48.031 --> 04:38:52.659
SWEEP ALL OF THIS UNDER THE RUG 
AND IGNORE IT, NOT LET US 

04:38:52.970 --> 04:38:58.350
CO-WITNESS ON IT.  AND INSTEAD 
RUSH TO IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT. 

04:39:02.223 --> 04:39:04.223
YOU'VE 

04:39:05.843 --> 04:39:08.974
GOT THE VICE PRESIDENT RECEIVING
COPOLICY AND SON 

04:39:13.444 --> 04:39:15.479
HUNTER BIDEN RECEIVING OVER 
$150,000 A MONTH EVEN THOUGH HE 

04:39:15.699 --> 04:39:19.650
HAD NO EXPERTISE IN ENERGY OR IN
UKRAINE.  YET THEY WOULDN'T LET 

04:39:20.000 --> 04:39:23.050
US CALL WITNESSES OR DELVE INTO 
THIS.  AND IT WAS INTERESTING 

04:39:23.266 --> 04:39:26.410
THAT JOE BIDEN GOT INTO AN 
ARGUMENT WITH A MAN THAT ONE OF 

04:39:26.630 --> 04:39:31.282
HIS EVENTS IN IOWA RECENTLY 
CALLED THE MAN A LIAR AND 

04:39:31.521 --> 04:39:35.492
CHALLENGED HIM TO A PUSHUP 
CONTEST AND SPOUTED OFF A BUNCH 

04:39:36.002 --> 04:39:43.559
OF OTHER MALARKEY, AND NOW THE  
COMMITTEE, THIS COMMITTEE IS 

04:39:44.714 --> 04:39:48.459
CONDUCTOR AN IMPEACHMENT 
INVESTIGATION BASED ON AS 

04:39:49.224 --> 04:39:54.780
PROFESSOR TURLEY PUT IT 
RECENTLY, THIN EVIDENCE AND 

04:39:55.260 --> 04:39:59.881
EVIDENCE THAT DOESN'T SMELL 
RIGHT, WAFER THEN EVIDENCE.  AND

04:40:00.897 --> 04:40:04.464
THIS WAS A PROFESS WHO 
ACKNOWLEDGED HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR 

04:40:04.680 --> 04:40:07.510
PRESIDENT TRUMP.  IN FACT ALL 
FOUR WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED, 

04:40:07.940 --> 04:40:12.169
NONE OF THEM HAD VOTED FOR HIM. 
HE SAID WAFER THIN EVIDENCE, 

04:40:12.389 --> 04:40:14.619
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLED TO 
IMPEACH A PRESIDENT ON.  AND 

04:40:14.829 --> 04:40:16.959
WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT, THERE 
ARE SO MANY THINGS GETTING 

04:40:17.199 --> 04:40:21.659
IGNORED. IT WAS ONE THING THAT 
USMCA TRADE DEAL WHICH IS VERY 

04:40:21.889 --> 04:40:26.630
IMPORTANT TO REPLACE NAFTA, IT 
LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT GETS ACROSS 

04:40:27.111 --> 04:40:32.495
THE FINISHLINE.  I HOPE SO.  IT 
WILL GEE FOR THE COUNTRY.  IT'S 

04:40:32.823 --> 04:40:36.582
BIPARTISAN.  BUT I THINK IF 
ANYTHING GOOD COMES OUT OF THE 

04:40:36.802 --> 04:40:39.415
IMPEACHMENT, IT WILL GET PAST 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 

04:40:40.643 --> 04:40:43.306
SHOW WE DID SOMETHING. WE DID 
SOMETHING.  VERY LITTLE IS 

04:40:43.556 --> 04:40:47.166
PASSED IN THE LAW.  WE HAVE 
68,000 AMERICANS WHO DIED FROM 

04:40:48.196 --> 04:40:51.421
OPIOID OVERDOSES FROM LAST YEAR 
ALONE. I THINK IT WAS 70,000 THE

04:40:51.629 --> 04:40:54.250
YEAR BEFORE THAT, AND EVEN 
THOUGH THE NUMBER HAS GONE DOWN 

04:40:54.725 --> 04:40:58.305
A BIT, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY 
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING A WHOLE LOT 

04:40:58.540 --> 04:41:01.325
BETTER, IT WAS BECAUSE NOT QUITE
AS MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING, BUT 

04:41:01.645 --> 04:41:04.672
THERE'S JUST AS MANY PEOPLE THAT
ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS SCOURGE, 

04:41:05.451 --> 04:41:09.002
THESE OPIOIDS AND OTHER DRUGS.  
OUR SOUTHERN 

04:41:13.762 --> 04:41:17.553
BORDER IS --  WEHAVE FAR TOO 
MANY PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE 

04:41:17.773 --> 04:41:22.083
BORDER.  THAT'S SOMETHING WE 
SHOULD WORK ON AND OUR ASYLUM 

04:41:22.328 --> 04:41:26.173
LAWS THAT NEED TO BE REFORMED.  
WE HAVE A $22 TRILLION DEBT 

04:41:27.033 --> 04:41:31.203
HANGING OVER OUR LED. THE REASON
I MENTIONED THESE THINGS IS 

04:41:31.633 --> 04:41:34.769
BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEE ISN'T 
DOING A THING AND SPENDING ALL 

04:41:34.984 --> 04:41:38.379
OUR TIME ON IMPEACHMENT IN ONE 
FORM OR THE OTHER.  I HAVE A 

04:41:38.609 --> 04:41:40.994
BILL, A BALANCED BUDGET 
AMENDMENT WHICH ACTUALLY MOVING 

04:41:41.214 --> 04:41:44.020
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, WE SHOULD 

04:41:44.240 --> 04:41:47.824
HAVE DONE IT YEARS AGO, THOSE 
ARE ALL IN OUR JURISDICTION, 

04:41:49.073 --> 04:41:52.694
INFRASTRUCTURE, NOT IN OUR 
JURISDICTION, BUT UNITED STATES 

04:41:53.018 --> 04:41:55.909
CONGRESS MIGHT ACT ON IT.  WE 
HAVE HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES 

04:41:56.129 --> 04:41:58.619
CRUMBLING IN THIS COUNTRY.  
CITES SOMETHING WE GENERALLY 

04:41:59.389 --> 04:42:02.099
AGREE ON. BUT THE DEMOCRATS 
DON'T WANT THEM TO TAKE ANY 

04:42:02.494 --> 04:42:05.408
CREDIT FOR THAT.  THAT'S 
UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN.  IT'S 

04:42:05.948 --> 04:42:08.908
UNFORTUNATE TAKING UP ALL ALL 
THIS TIME ON IMPEACHMENT WHEN 

04:42:09.133 --> 04:42:13.054
IT'S SO MANY THINGS WE SHOULD BE
WORKING ON FOR THE BENEFIT FOR 

04:42:13.358 --> 04:42:15.358
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

04:42:19.048 --> 04:42:22.723
&gt;&gt; MR. JORDAN, DO YOU SEEK 
RECOGNITION? 

04:42:22.724 --> 04:42:24.493
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO THE RANKING 
MEMBER. 

04:42:24.494 --> 04:42:28.099
&gt;&gt; I MEANTED TO SAY QUICKLY, IT 
IS AMAZING THAT THEY GOT REALLY 

04:42:28.739 --> 04:42:31.110
EXPENSIVE ABOUT PROCESS ON THE 
MAJORITY SIDE WHEN WE POINTED 

04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:35.030
OUT THE TRAGEDY AND TRAVESTY OF 
BEING A RUBBERSTAMP IN THIS 

04:42:35.260 --> 04:42:37.625
COMMITTEE AND GENTLEMAN FROM 
FLORIDA BROUGHT UP A COUPLE OF 

04:42:37.840 --> 04:42:39.840
THINGS. LET ME REMIND, THE WHITE
HOUSE 

04:42:42.891 --> 04:42:44.891
AND EVERYTHING, JUST LIKE 
EVERYTHING ELSE, IT ALL GOES TO 

04:42:45.111 --> 04:42:47.321
THE WHIM AND WHIMBER OF THE 
CHAIRMAN AND MAJORITY.  THEY 

04:42:47.541 --> 04:42:50.364
CAN'T DO ANYTHING THEY WANT.  IT
ALL GOES BACK TO THE MAJORITY 

04:42:50.580 --> 04:42:54.440
OPINION.  I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

04:42:54.660 --> 04:42:56.660
FLORIDA. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YIELDING.  THEY

04:42:56.770 --> 04:43:00.180
CAN'T BE CLEAN IF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 

04:43:00.901 --> 04:43:05.820
ABUSE OF POWER.  THEY CANT PROVE
THE QUESTION INTO THE BIDENS ARE

04:43:06.055 --> 04:43:08.185
UNREASONABLE. THE GENTLEMAN FROM
NEW YORK SAID YOU'RE NOT 

04:43:08.410 --> 04:43:12.054
LISTENING TO THE WITNESSES.  I 
LISTENED VERY CLOSELY TOOCH 

04:43:14.319 --> 04:43:19.614
WITNESSES.  I HEARD MR. KENT SAY
THEY WERE SO CONCERNED ABOUT 

04:43:19.833 --> 04:43:24.202
BURISMA, THEY HAD TO PULL BACK. 
SO IF IT'S OKAY FOR KENT TO ASK 

04:43:24.413 --> 04:43:28.132
QUESTIONS WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT?
I LISTENED TO YOVANOVITCH, AND 

04:43:28.362 --> 04:43:32.058
SHE SAID IT'S PREPARATION TO ASK
STICKY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE 

04:43:32.348 --> 04:43:37.009
VICE PRESIDENT'S SON WAS OFF 
MOONLIGHTING FOR FOREIGN 

04:43:37.229 --> 04:43:40.849
COUNTRY.  IF IT'S OKAY FOR THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO ASK 

04:43:41.069 --> 04:43:43.837
THOSE QUESTIONS, WHY NOT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO ASK THOSE 

04:43:44.052 --> 04:43:47.292
QUESTIONS? HERE'S ONE THING I 
KNOW.  CORRUPT PEOPLE, THEY 

04:43:47.882 --> 04:43:50.952
DON'T JUST STEAL ONCE.  THEY GET
INTO THIS CYCLE AND CULTURE OF 

04:43:51.172 --> 04:43:55.207
CORRUPTION, AND IT'S 
DISAPPOINTING.  I READ BACK TO 

04:43:55.421 --> 04:44:00.016
THIS NEW YORKER ARTICLE.  I'M 
READING DIRECTLY FROM IT.  ONE 

04:44:00.237 --> 04:44:02.237
OF 

04:44:05.237 --> 04:44:11.121
CATHELENE MOTIONS IS IN REGARDS 
TO A LARGE DIAMOND.  WHEN ASKED 

04:44:11.396 --> 04:44:15.081
ABOUT IT, HE TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN
GIVEN THE DIAMOND BY A LARGE 

04:44:15.686 --> 04:44:19.792
ENERGY TYCOON. HE TOLD ME TWO 
ASSOCIATES ACCOMPANIED HIM IN 

04:44:20.002 --> 04:44:25.177
MIAMI, AND THEY SURPRISED HIM BY
GIVING HIM A RARE VINTAGE OF 

04:44:25.417 --> 04:44:28.851
SCOTCH WORTH THOUSANDS OF 
DOLLARS.  THIS GUY WASN'T JUST 

04:44:29.075 --> 04:44:33.400
TAKING THESE WEIRD JOBS FROM THE
UKRAINIANS. HE WAS TAKING 

04:44:33.685 --> 04:44:36.160
DIAMONDS AND SCOTCH FROM THE 
CHINESE, AND I THINK IT IS 

04:44:36.647 --> 04:44:39.010
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

04:44:39.218 --> 04:44:41.998
TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT'S THE 
CASE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

04:44:42.218 --> 04:44:47.788
WATCHING TODAY KNOW THIS ISN'T 
AN IMPEACHMENT MOVEMENT.  IT'S 

04:44:48.008 --> 04:44:50.888
LOSING STEAM.  I WAS WATCHING 
THE HEARING ON THE WAY IN THIS 

04:44:51.128 --> 04:44:55.268
MORNING, MAYBE ONE OF THE ONLY 
FOLKS, BUT I WAS WATCHING, AND I

04:44:56.598 --> 04:44:59.696
HEARD GLORIA SAY THE POLLING ON 
IMPEACHMENT IS BAD FOR 

04:44:59.916 --> 04:45:07.537
DEMOCRATS.  I HEARD THE CHAIRMAN
SAY THAT HE HAD GOB ON CN T KWS 

04:45:07.870 --> 04:45:10.520
ONCE WE HAD ALL OF THESE PUBLIC 
HEARINGS, AND WE'LL ANIMATE ALL 

04:45:10.781 --> 04:45:15.701
OF THESE SUPPORT FROM HEARINGS. 
WELL, NOW YOU'VE HAD THE 

04:45:16.136 --> 04:45:18.560
HEARINGS AND CALLED WITNESSES, 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU'RE 

04:45:18.790 --> 04:45:23.260
LOSING GROUND.  YOU'RE LOSING 
GROUND WITH THE VOTERS AND EVEN 

04:45:24.000 --> 04:45:26.850
WITH YOUR OWN DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES.  I BELIEVE SOME OF 

04:45:27.430 --> 04:45:31.238
THE REPORTING I'VE SEEN ARE 
BEGGING YOU TO PURSUE SOMETHING 

04:45:31.448 --> 04:45:35.348
OTHER THAN IMPEACHMENT.  THIS 
BLOOD LOSS FOR UMPEACHMENT IS 

04:45:35.559 --> 04:45:38.248
NOT GOING TO BE VISITED ON US OR
PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT'S GOING TO 

04:45:38.599 --> 04:45:42.648
BE VISITED ON YOUR OWN MEMBERS, 
AND THEY'RE ASKING YOU NOT TO DO

04:45:42.869 --> 04:45:50.444
THIS. THE ONLY STANDARD THAT 
SPEAKER PELOSI AND SPEAKER 

04:45:50.663 --> 04:45:55.199
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF SAID, IT HAS TO 
BE BIPARTISAN. THEY SAID IT ALL 

04:45:55.899 --> 04:45:58.839
THROUGHOUT THE CALENDER YEAR.  
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGED 

04:45:59.179 --> 04:46:03.845
IS NOT THE STRENGTHENING OF THE 
EVIDENCE.  IT'S GOING INTO THE 

04:46:04.055 --> 04:46:08.250
ELECTION, AND THEY TAKEN A LOOK 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, 

04:46:08.625 --> 04:46:13.360
AND THEY REALIZE THEY TO TAKE A 
LOOK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CAPABLE

04:46:13.585 --> 04:46:16.661
OF DEFEATING PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 
A FAIR FIGHT.  WE KNOW THAT. THE

04:46:16.870 --> 04:46:21.346
AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT. AND 
SO THE ONLY BIPARTISAN VOTE ON 

04:46:21.600 --> 04:46:26.192
IMPEACHMENT IS A BIPARTISAN VOTE
AGAINST OPENING AN INQUIRY.  AND

04:46:26.732 --> 04:46:30.662
THE ONLY POSSIBILITY FOR THAT 
MOVEMENT FROM THEN TO NOW 

04:46:31.202 --> 04:46:33.833
DESPITE ALL OF THE HEARINGS 
DESPITE ALL OF THE DAMAGED 

04:46:34.084 --> 04:46:37.453
INSTITUTIONS THROUGH THIS VERY 
WEIRD AND INVESTIGATION YOU'VE 

04:46:38.878 --> 04:46:43.516
RUN, THE ONLY THING IS THAT 
YOU'LL LOSE MOST VOTES THAN YOU 

04:46:43.921 --> 04:46:47.202
STARTED WITH. YOU LOST TWO OF 
YOUR MEMBERS.  YOU'LL NOT LOSE 

04:46:47.611 --> 04:46:50.572
TWO MEMBERS BUT HAVE A RISK OF 
LOSING MORE MEMBERS. AND YOU 

04:46:50.792 --> 04:46:53.242
KNOW WHAT, REPUBLICANS ARE 
UNITED.  WE SEE THIS FOR WHAT IT

04:46:53.462 --> 04:46:58.412
IS. AND WE KNOW JUST AS MY 
COLLEAGUE FROM OHIO MR. JORDAN 

04:46:58.878 --> 04:47:01.243
SAID, IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ON 
PRESIDENT TRUMP POLITICALLY 

04:47:01.463 --> 04:47:05.749
THOUGH IT IS THE ELECTION THAT 
MOTIVATES THEM FOR THIS BIZARRE 

04:47:06.024 --> 04:47:08.719
BEHAVIOR. IT'S NOT JUST AN 
ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENCY. IT'S 

04:47:08.949 --> 04:47:15.136
AN ATTACK ON US. IT'S AN ATTACK 
THAT BELIEVES IN THE PRESIDENT 

04:47:15.361 --> 04:47:18.886
AND UNDERSTAND VERY WELL WHO WE 
VOTED FOR AND HAS NONTRADITIONAL

04:47:19.402 --> 04:47:23.151
WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS BUT WE 
SEE THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THE 

04:47:23.372 --> 04:47:25.892
COUNTRY.  MORE JOBS, MORE 
OPPORTUNITY.  THEY HAVE NO 

04:47:26.103 --> 04:47:29.342
ANSWER FOR THAT IN THE UPCOMING 
ELECTION.  THAT'S WHY WE'RE 

04:47:29.552 --> 04:47:36.710
HERE.  
&gt;&gt;  FOR PURPOSES, MR. BEAK SEEKS

04:47:36.940 --> 04:47:38.940
RECOGNITION 
&gt;&gt;  MAUVE TO STRIKE THE LAST 

04:47:39.450 --> 04:47:43.980
WORK. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. I 

04:47:44.210 --> 04:47:46.300
MENTIONED BEFORE THAT LOOKING AT
THE EVIDENCE, I'M STUNNED THAT 

04:47:46.560 --> 04:47:54.350
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE AISLE PER  PETTILY 

04:47:59.355 --> 04:48:06.495
READ READ EVERY INFENCE THEY CAN
MAKE, AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLE 

04:48:08.115 --> 04:48:10.115
INFRERNS OF CREDIBILITY STACKED 
UP, AND I SUPPORT THE 

04:48:10.190 --> 04:48:13.805
GENTLEMAN'S AMENDMENT, AND I 
WANT TO READ THIS FROM A 

04:48:14.265 --> 04:48:18.240
UKRAINIAN SOURCE WHO IS NAMED 
AND CITED IN A RECENT 

04:48:19.505 --> 04:48:21.505
PUBLIGATION. IT SAYS QUOTE, 

04:48:24.478 --> 04:48:29.383
BY INVITING OFFICIAL FOREIGNERS,
UKRAINIAN WANTS TO GET INTEREST,

04:48:29.613 --> 04:48:34.973
AND HAVING HUNTER BIDEN ON 
BOARD, THE OWNER WANTED TO 

04:48:35.192 --> 04:48:38.093
CORRECT THE IMAGE AND GET COVER 
BECAUSE AUTHORITIES ARE SCARED 

04:48:38.392 --> 04:48:44.625
BY THE U.S. EMBASSY IN UKRAINE. 
HUNTER BIDEN USING AS THE 

04:48:44.845 --> 04:48:51.395
CAPABILITIES OF HIS FAMILY ACTED
AS A BUFFER FOR HIS FAMILY AND 

04:48:51.845 --> 04:48:55.325
UKRAINIAN AGENCY.  HIS 
CORRUPTION SMELLS.  SO LET'S 

04:48:55.555 --> 04:48:58.845
LOOK AT THE TRANSCRIPT OUR 
COLLEAGUES KEEP REFERRING TO.  

04:48:59.615 --> 04:49:04.306
FACE FORWARD.  THE OTHER THING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS, THERE'S A 

04:49:04.516 --> 04:49:09.771
LOT OF TALK ABOUT BIDEN'S SON, 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO DO 

04:49:09.986 --> 04:49:13.349
OUT ABOUT THAT.  WHATEVER YOU 
CAN DO WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

04:49:13.963 --> 04:49:17.152
WOULD BE GREAT.  BIDEN WENT IN 
SAYING YOU CAN STOP PROSECUTION.

04:49:17.603 --> 04:49:20.673
IF YOU LOOK INTO IT, IT SOUNDS 
HORRIBLE TO ME.  THAT IS THE 

04:49:20.943 --> 04:49:24.604
ESSENCE OF WHAT THEY WANT TO 
IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR.  SO

04:49:24.969 --> 04:49:29.384
IT BEGATHIZE QUESTION, IT REALLY
BEGS THE QUESTION, REALLY, DO 

04:49:29.599 --> 04:49:34.659
YOU GET IMMUNITY, IS IT AN 
IMMUNITY GRANTING VENT TO HAVE A

04:49:34.879 --> 04:49:38.899
PUBLIC RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE? DO
YOU GET IMMUNITY FOR THAT?  

04:49:39.799 --> 04:49:45.342
LET'S FLIP IT. THE QUESTION IS 
DOES THE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO 

04:49:45.841 --> 04:49:49.696
REQUEST AN INVESTIGATION INMOST 
ASSURE UDLY.  HE MENTIONS THE 

04:49:49.916 --> 04:49:52.522
ATTORNEY GENERAL HERE.  IT IS 
CLEAR THAT HE WOULD LIKE AN 

04:49:52.742 --> 04:49:54.846
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
CORRUPTION SURROUNDING UKRAINE 

04:49:55.796 --> 04:50:00.356
BECAUSE WHAT THIS PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY GOES ON TO SAY?  HE 

04:50:00.886 --> 04:50:04.416
GOES ON TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO 
RESTORE THE HONESTY IN HIS 

04:50:04.762 --> 04:50:09.257
COUNTRY.  THAT'S WHAT HE'S 
TALKING ABOUT.  YOU HAVE THE 

04:50:09.487 --> 04:50:12.422
ATTORNEY GENERAL.  YOU HAVE THE 
PRESIDENT OF BOTH COUNTRIES 

04:50:12.712 --> 04:50:15.465
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE'S 
CORRUPTION, AND LET GET IT FIXED

04:50:15.765 --> 04:50:19.896
UP, AND AT LEAST YOU'RE BACK TO 
THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF DEMOCRATS

04:50:20.186 --> 04:50:25.466
WANTING TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP FOR THESE ABUSE OF POWER 

04:50:25.791 --> 04:50:28.419
ISSUES.  THESE 

04:50:33.124 --> 04:50:40.058
AMOR  THESE ISSUES OF 
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS.  IT'S 

04:50:40.288 --> 04:50:45.243
JUST BIZARRE.  HUNTER BIDEN 
PLACED ON THE BOARD OF BURISMA 

04:50:47.679 --> 04:50:53.453
IN 2014, AND IN THE MEANTIME, 
EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT BURISMA'S

04:50:53.687 --> 04:50:57.963
COMPANY PAID ABOUT 3.4 $3.4 
MILLION A COMPANY CALLED 

04:51:00.814 --> 04:51:04.944
ROSEMONT CINEMA, THE COMPANY OF 
HUNTER AND HIS PARTNER.  THAT IS

04:51:06.274 --> 04:51:08.274
REALLY 

04:51:10.114 --> 04:51:13.258
INTRIGUING, THE INVESTIGATIONS 
SURROUNDING BURISMA STOPPED, AND

04:51:13.477 --> 04:51:17.912
BURISMA'S REPUTATION IN UKRAINE 
IS LOW, AND IT WAS DUBIOUS EVEN 

04:51:18.132 --> 04:51:23.643
BEFORE THIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
RAISED IT TO NEW ATTENTION.  

04:51:24.168 --> 04:51:28.133
NOW, LET'S FACE IT, ACCORDING TO
UKRAINIAN SOURCES, BURISMA IS 

04:51:30.134 --> 04:51:33.813
NOT ON EVERYBODY'S FRONT BURNER 
IN THE UKRAINE, BUT IT IS HERE 

04:51:38.423 --> 04:51:42.929
BECAUSE WE WERE PROVIDING 
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

04:51:43.264 --> 04:51:48.199
IN FOREIGN AID TO UKRAINE.  THIS
PRESIDENT SAID WE NEED TO STOP 

04:51:48.429 --> 04:51:51.779
CORRUPTION.  HE MENTIONS THE 
CORRUPTION HE HEARD ABOUT.  IS 

04:51:52.554 --> 04:51:55.260
THAT IMPEACHABLE?  NO. HE'S 
ASKING FOR AN INVESTIGATION TO 

04:51:55.483 --> 04:51:58.678
GET TOOT BOTTOM OF IT BECAUSE 
YOU DON'T GET IMMUNITY BECAUSE 

04:51:58.928 --> 04:52:02.149
YOUR FATHER IS RUNNING FOR 
PUBLIC OFF THE OFFICE, JUST 

04:52:02.758 --> 04:52:05.744
BECAUSE ANYONE RELATED TO YOU IS
RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.  AND 

04:52:05.968 --> 04:52:09.198
I WILL TELL YOU THIS PRESIDENT 
HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB IN 

04:52:09.439 --> 04:52:13.064
SPITE OF 3 YEARS OF CONSTANT 
HARASSMENT BY THE DEMOCRATS OF 

04:52:13.385 --> 04:52:16.440
THIS BODY AND MEDIA ON THE LEFT 
OF THIS COUNTRY.  WE HAVE A 

04:52:16.675 --> 04:52:22.525
GREAT ECONOMY.  HE'S TRYING TO 
BRING ORDER TO THE BORD BORDER. 

04:52:22.745 --> 04:52:27.273
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING THAN
EVER BEFORE.  THIS PRESIDENT 

04:52:27.918 --> 04:52:32.108
SUPPORTS THE MILITARY AND 
PRESTIGE AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS

04:52:32.588 --> 04:52:37.861
NO MORE POLICY ON THE FOREIGN 
SIDE THAT WE SAW ON THE 

04:52:38.076 --> 04:52:41.717
PRESENTATION.  HE IS WORKING 

04:52:45.427 --> 04:52:47.527
WITH GREATNESS 
&gt;&gt;  MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST 

04:52:47.757 --> 04:52:49.757
WORD. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO BEGIN VERY QUICKLY 

04:52:50.057 --> 04:52:53.907
AND BEGIN WITH THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM OHIO LAMONTING ABOUT THE 

04:52:54.667 --> 04:52:57.306
PRODUCTIVITY IN CONGRESS AND 
REMIND MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER 

04:52:57.516 --> 04:53:00.771
SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT WE PASSED
NEARLY 400-PIECES 

04:53:04.411 --> 04:53:09.827
OF LEGISLATION AND 275 OF THOSE 
BILLS ARE BIPARTISAN AND RAISE 

04:53:10.223 --> 04:53:13.512
THE COST OF PREEXISTING DRUGS 
AND PREEXISTING CONDITIONS AND 

04:53:14.267 --> 04:53:17.172
PROVIDE EQUAL CARE FOR EQUAL 
WORK AND RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE 

04:53:17.393 --> 04:53:19.853
FOR 3 # MILLION AMERICANS.  

04:53:29.943 --> 04:53:35.753
AND BIGGEST ANTI CORRUPTION 
BILL.  THE LIST IS EXHAUSTIVE, 

04:53:35.968 --> 04:53:39.938
AND SADLY 87% OF THOSE BILLS ARE
LYING ON 

04:53:43.158 --> 04:53:45.158
MITCH MCCONNELL'S DISC DESK.  

04:53:49.893 --> 04:53:57.177
AND NOW LET'S GET BACK TO THE 
FACTS OF THIS IMPEACHMENT 

04:53:57.394 --> 04:53:59.394
HEARING.  

04:54:40.675 --> 04:54:46.726
&gt;&gt;  WHAT HAPPENED IN 2019?  WHAT
CHANGE SND THE PRESIDENT IS 

04:54:46.956 --> 04:54:50.546
LOSING IN A NATIONAL POLL BY 
DOUBLE DIGITS TO JOE BIDEN.  

04:54:50.766 --> 04:54:54.965
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.  THIRD, 
MULTIPLE WITNESSES, TRUMP 

04:54:57.307 --> 04:54:59.307
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, 
TESTIFIED THAT VICE PRESIDENT 

04:54:59.622 --> 04:55:04.576
BIDEN DID NOTHING WRONG 
INCLUDING MR. KENT, AMBASSADOR 

04:55:07.233 --> 04:55:13.463
YOVANOVITCH, AMBASSADOR HOLMES 
AND AMBASSADOR VOLKER.  THE 

04:55:13.693 --> 04:55:17.513
FIRING WAS DONE IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH OFFICIAL U.S. POLICY.  IT'S

04:55:17.733 --> 04:55:21.803
APRUBD BY THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT, APPROVED BY THE 

04:55:22.063 --> 04:55:26.061
UNITED STATES AND MANY COUNTRIES
THROUGHOUT YOU'RE AND A 

04:55:26.496 --> 04:55:30.010
BIPARTISAN.  THIS IS A CORRUPT 
PROSECUTOR AND OFFICIAL U.S. 

04:55:30.226 --> 04:55:33.465
POLICY THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT 
WAS EXECUTING.  BY CONTRAST, 

04:55:33.706 --> 04:55:37.431
WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS CASE, THE 
BASIS OF THIS IMPEACHMENT 

04:55:38.071 --> 04:55:40.106
PROCEEDING IS EXACTLY THE 
OPPOSITE.  WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:55:40.361 --> 04:55:45.237
WAS DOING WAS NOT OFFICIAL U.S. 
POLICY, AND ALL OF THE WITNESSES

04:55:45.452 --> 04:55:47.452
CONFIRM THAT. IT WAS NOT DONE 
THROUGH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 

04:55:47.612 --> 04:55:50.252
AND IT WAS DONE AGAINST THE 
ADVICE OF ALL OF HIS ADVISORS.  

04:55:50.582 --> 04:55:52.842
AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S VERY 
DIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE 

04:55:53.342 --> 04:55:55.342
CONFRONTING TODAY.  AND 

04:55:59.439 --> 04:56:07.013
THIS WAS WORK NOT DONE BY THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT BUT LED BY THE 

04:56:12.033 --> 04:56:15.198
PRESIDENT'S PERSON ATTORNEY. 
LET'S NOT CONFUSE THESE TWO 

04:56:15.518 --> 04:56:18.516
THINGS.  FACTS MATTER.  THE 
TRUTH MATTERS.  YOU CAN'T 

04:56:18.996 --> 04:56:22.306
CONTINUE TO MAKE ASSERTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD FROM 

04:56:22.744 --> 04:56:24.806
THE GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA. 
&gt;&gt; I THANK 

04:56:29.776 --> 04:56:31.776
THE GENTLEMAN

04:56:34.999 --> 04:56:41.003
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SO 
INTERESTED IN YIELDING, FOR MANY

04:56:45.613 --> 04:56:49.643
YEARS THE VICE PRESIDENT'S SON 
WAS ON THE BOARD.  THEY NEVER 

04:56:50.260 --> 04:56:55.281
INVESTIGATED THIS.  IT ONLY CAME
ABOUT WHEN VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 

04:56:55.496 --> 04:56:58.876
BECAME PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
POLITICAL OPPONENT.  HE CALLED 

04:56:59.191 --> 04:57:03.179
ZELENSKY TO CONGRATULATE HIM, 
AND THEN IN HIS TALKING POINTS 

04:57:03.434 --> 04:57:07.824
HE TOLD HIM TO BRING UP 
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE.  HE NEVER

04:57:09.084 --> 04:57:12.369
DID IT, BUT THEY LIED TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAID THE 

04:57:12.719 --> 04:57:16.365
PRESIDENT HAD.  JULY 25TH, 
AGAIN, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNSEL

04:57:16.759 --> 04:57:21.025
MEMBERS WORKED REALLY HARD TO 
TELL THE PRESIDENT, IMPRESS UPON

04:57:21.235 --> 04:57:25.107
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT HE NEEDS
TO ROOT OUT CORRUPTION.  THE 

04:57:25.487 --> 04:57:30.322
PRESIDENT NEVER BRINGS UP 
CORRUPTION.  HE WANTED TO 

04:57:30.622 --> 04:57:34.112
INVESTIGATE A U.S. CITIZEN.  
IT'S A FORMAL PROCESS THEY GO 

04:57:34.337 --> 04:57:38.127
THROUGH.  THE PRESIDENT NEVER 
ASKED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO

04:57:38.362 --> 04:57:40.832
THIS.  THE PRESIDENT WAS NEVER 
INTERESTED IN FIGHTING 

04:57:41.112 --> 04:57:44.995
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. HE WAS 
ONLY INTERESTED IN WEAPONIZING 

04:57:45.340 --> 04:57:49.300
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE FOR HIS 
OWN PERSONAL BENEFIT.  AND 

04:57:49.568 --> 04:57:53.981
THAT'S WHY WE MUST HOLD HIM 
COUNTABLE FOR ABUSE OF POWER.  

04:57:58.356 --> 04:58:01.766
RECOGNIZE THE CONSENT REQUEST. 
&gt;&gt; THE ARTICLE IS DATED FEBRUARY

04:58:02.876 --> 04:58:06.717
FEBRUARY 12TH, 2019, JUST 
2-WEEKS BEFORE THE CALL WHEN HE 

04:58:06.927 --> 04:58:10.027
ASKED WHETHER HE SHOULD WORRY 
ABOUT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN.

04:58:10.887 --> 04:58:13.176
&gt;&gt; NO OBJECTION. 
&gt;&gt;. 

04:58:13.177 --> 04:58:19.394
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE VOTES ON THE FLOOR 
MEMBER VOTES ON THE FLOOR.  THE 

04:58:19.614 --> 04:58:25.085
MEETING WILL STAND IN RECESS 
UNTIL AFTER THE VOTES.  PLEASE 

04:58:25.393 --> 04:58:28.613
RECONVENE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
VOTES.  THE COMMITTEE IS IN 

04:58:28.828 --> 04:58:30.828
RECESS. THANKS.  

05:00:14.138 --> 05:00:18.418
&gt;&gt;  THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES IS 
MUCH MORE SERIOUS. 

05:00:18.419 --> 05:00:21.434
&gt;&gt; IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE IT 
HAS BEEN OTHER DAYS WHERE THE 

05:00:21.894 --> 05:00:24.419
PRESIDENT'S TEAM IS NOT PAYING 
ATTENTION TO THIS HEARING. 

05:00:24.654 --> 05:00:29.856
WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN CAPITOL 
HILL IS CERTAINLY BENEATH FROM 

05:00:30.220 --> 05:00:33.296
WHAT THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION 
TO.  HE SEEMS VERY ENGAGED AND 

05:00:34.051 --> 05:00:36.463
CALLING OUT SPECIFIC NUMBERS BY 
NAMES AS THEY'VE SPOKEN THIS 

05:00:37.014 --> 05:00:38.761
MORNING. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.  HE TRIED TO 

05:00:38.762 --> 05:00:42.393
CORRECT A PAIR OF DEMOCRATIC 
HOUSE MEMBERS IN REAL TIME AFTER

05:00:42.723 --> 05:00:47.972
THEY SPOKE IN THE HEARING TO TRY
TO SAY THEY HAD MISCHARACTERIZED

05:00:48.232 --> 05:00:51.422
HIS INTENT AND MISCHARACTERIZED 
WHAT HE SAID IN HIS PHONE CALL 

05:00:51.992 --> 05:00:55.192
WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT, 
AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALL SEEN THE

05:00:55.412 --> 05:00:57.412
ROUGH TRANSCRIPT OF THAT CALL.  

05:01:00.867 --> 05:01:05.332
IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS SAYING THERE IT 

05:01:06.232 --> 05:01:10.885
SPEAKS TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE
IMPEACHMENT MEETINGS, AND IT'S 

05:01:12.235 --> 05:01:15.645
FOCUSING ON GOVERNING AND CHILD 
CARE AND PAID LEAVE POLICIES AND

05:01:16.565 --> 05:01:19.885
OTHER INITIATIVES, BUT HIS FOCUS
IS CLEARLY ON WHAT'S HAPPENING 

05:01:20.105 --> 05:01:22.674
IN THE HOUSE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 

05:01:22.675 --> 05:01:26.875
&gt;&gt; REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN 
CRITICIZED, OR IT'S BEEN NOTED 

05:01:27.187 --> 05:01:30.159
SEVERAL TIMES AS THEY TRY TO 
DEFEND THE PRESIDENT, THEY'RE 

05:01:31.032 --> 05:01:34.652
FOCUSED ON HOW, YOU KNOW, THEY 
HAVE ISSUE WITH HOW DEMOCRATS 

05:01:35.147 --> 05:01:38.767
ARE RUNNING THE SHOW BECAUSE 
DEMOCRATS DO HAVE CONTROL HERE 

05:01:38.978 --> 05:01:44.528
IN THIS COMMITSY, BUT AS WELL AS
IN THE HOUSE GENERALLY, AND I 

05:01:44.738 --> 05:01:48.198
HEARD ONE SAYING WE'RE ALL JUST 
FOCUSENED ON THE PROCESS, AND 

05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:51.838
WE'RE NOT AND THEN HE WENT 
THROUGH 10 ITEMS HE DIDN'T LIKE 

05:01:52.408 --> 05:01:56.113
ABOUT THE PROCESS.  OTHER 
MEMBERS ON THE SIDE OF THE 

05:02:00.838 --> 05:02:02.838
AISLE

05:02:06.436 --> 05:02:11.337
.  WHAT ARE YOU NOTICING AS 
THEY'RE TRYING TO LAUNCH A 

05:02:11.653 --> 05:02:13.944
DEFENSE. 
&gt;&gt; TODAY HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL 

05:02:14.613 --> 05:02:17.344
DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ABUSED HIS POWER, AND IF 

05:02:17.723 --> 05:02:22.062
SO DOES THAT MERIT IMPEACHMENT 
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING 

05:02:23.187 --> 05:02:27.827
AND UNIQUE TO THE IMPEACHMENT 
HEARINGS WE HAD SO FAR.  I DO 

05:02:28.047 --> 05:02:32.609
SEE REPUBLICANS TRYING TO TALK 
MORE ABOUT SUBSTANCE DONALD 

05:02:32.829 --> 05:02:34.829
TRUMP OVER THE 

05:02:38.934 --> 05:02:47.686
PAST WEEK TWEETED AND SAID 
DEFEND ME ON THAT.  AND HE HAD 

05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:51.676
THERE'S NO WAY UKRAINE KNEW 
ABOUT THE AID BEING WITHHELD 

05:02:52.316 --> 05:02:54.885
WHEN UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT HOPPED 
ON THE PHONE IN JULY WHICH 

05:02:55.365 --> 05:02:57.365
IGNORED TESTIMONY FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE THAT 

05:02:57.715 --> 05:02:59.715
THERE'S INDICATIONS THAT THEY 

05:03:04.175 --> 05:03:06.175
MIGHT HAVE

05:03:10.801 --> 05:03:16.601
ANOTHER AREA IS THE CRIME TO 
IMPEACH TRUMP. I THINK IT'S A 

05:03:16.831 --> 05:03:19.141
DEBATE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
SCHOLARS A COUPLE OF WEEKS 

05:03:19.501 --> 05:03:23.011
TOUCHED ON THIS.  THE 
REPUBLICANS SAID YOU DON'T HAVE 

05:03:23.232 --> 05:03:27.767
TO MEET TO GET IMPEACHED.  THOSE
ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.  BUT 

05:03:28.037 --> 05:03:31.797
JONATHAN TURLEY SAID I THINK IT 
WILL BE BETTER IF YOU WOULD 

05:03:32.492 --> 05:03:38.333
CONVINCE AMERICA HE BASICALLY 
COMMITTED A CRIME.  BASICALLY HE

05:03:38.623 --> 05:03:42.883
PUT IT TO BILL CLINTON, HE'S 
ACCUSED OF TWO THINGS, LYING TO 

05:03:43.103 --> 05:03:47.427
A GRAND JURY AND OBSTRUCTER A 
GRAND JURY PROCESS.  I WANTED TO

05:03:47.687 --> 05:03:49.687
PULL 

05:03:51.897 --> 05:03:55.617
UP A PROCESS WHO PULLED BACK IN 
THAT WAY.  SHE SAID THIS IS A 

05:03:55.857 --> 05:03:58.579
LEGAL DOCUMENT, THIS 
CONSTITUTION, I'M QUOTING HERE. 

05:03:59.010 --> 05:04:02.030
YOU CAN BREECH AND VIOLATE THE 
LAWS OF THE CONSTITUTION.  

05:04:03.129 --> 05:04:06.280
THEY'RE CONSTITUTIONAL CRIMES.  
WE'RE GETTING INTO A SUBSTANTIAL

05:04:06.755 --> 05:04:08.978
DEBATE HERE.  
&gt;&gt;  THERE'S A QUESTION ON THE 

05:04:09.426 --> 05:04:13.761
TABLE OF WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DID IS WORTH IMPEACHMENT.  LET'S

05:04:14.096 --> 05:04:22.171
LISTEN TO CHAIRMAN NADHER, AND 
HE REFERRED TO IMPEACHER NIXON, 

05:04:22.701 --> 05:04:27.131
AND HE USED THAT AS A REFERENCE 
TO DEFENSE PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND 

05:04:27.361 --> 05:04:31.513
THOSE ARE AN ABUSE OF POWER AND 
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. 

05:04:31.514 --> 05:04:35.854
&gt;&gt; AND THE IMPEACHMENT OF 
PRESIDENT NUXEN, ALTHOUGH HE 

05:04:36.265 --> 05:04:39.731
COMMITTED MANY CRIMES, THEY 
IMPEACHED FOR ABUSE OF POWER AND

05:04:40.181 --> 05:04:44.651
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.  IT DID 
NOT SPECIFY A SPECIFIC CRIME, 

05:04:44.891 --> 05:04:48.161
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE 
MAJORITY STAFF REPORT OF THE 

05:04:48.541 --> 05:04:50.541
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BACK IN 

05:04:54.739 --> 05:05:01.233
1974, AND I BELIEVE 1998 BUT 
CERTAINLY 1974 POINTED OUT 

05:05:01.547 --> 05:05:06.183
DIFFERENT THINGS.  IT'S CRIMES 
NOT IMPEACHABLE AND DIFFERENT 

05:05:06.428 --> 05:05:09.302
THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT PEE A 
CRIME.  IT IS A GRAVE AND 

05:05:09.518 --> 05:05:11.518
SERIOUS OFFENSE AGAINST THE 
CONSTITUTION 

05:05:14.777 --> 05:05:15.956
AND OBSTRUCTION FORM OF 
GOVERNMENT. 

05:05:15.957 --> 05:05:17.957
&gt;&gt; AT 

05:05:20.842 --> 05:05:25.496
THE BEGINNING WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT PRESIDENT NIXON, ALTHOUGH 

05:05:25.706 --> 05:05:29.451
HE DIDN'T STEP DOWN, THEY 
RECOMMENDED IT, AND THEY DID 

05:05:29.666 --> 05:05:34.183
MAKE IT THROUGH THIS PART.  IT 
IS IN PLACE.  WHAT ARE THE OTHER

05:05:34.398 --> 05:05:37.022
TAKEAWAYS FROM WHAT NADLER WAS 
SAYING? 

05:05:37.023 --> 05:05:41.008
&gt;&gt; HE WAS TRYING TO GET AT WHAT 
I WAS SAYING EARLIER, IT'S A 

05:05:41.284 --> 05:05:44.303
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRIME AND 
IMPEACHMENT.  THEY NEED A VAGUE 

05:05:44.553 --> 05:05:46.553
TERM THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE 
JUMPED ON THEM FOR WHICH IS 

05:05:46.753 --> 05:05:49.773
ABUSE OF POWER.  I HEARD 
REPUBLICANS SAY A LOT LIKE 

05:05:49.993 --> 05:05:54.184
LISTEN.  ABUSE OF POWER ISN'T 
SOMETHING YOU FIND IN THE 

05:05:54.504 --> 05:05:57.824
CRIMINAL CODE.  IT'S TOO VAGUE. 
YOU'RE MAKING UP STUFF TO THROW 

05:05:58.054 --> 05:06:02.454
UP THERE.  WHEREAS DEMOCRATS 
ARGUE, LIKE, THE FOUNDERS LEFT 

05:06:02.789 --> 05:06:04.904
THIS PURPOSELY VAGUE FOR US 
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T IMAGINE 

05:06:05.174 --> 05:06:09.949
SOME CRIMES THAT THE PRESIDENTS 
WOULD COMMIT THAT WOULD BE 

05:06:10.249 --> 05:06:13.961
IMPEACHABLE, AND WE THINK DONALD
TRUMP HAS LEVERAGED THE ENTIRE 

05:06:14.205 --> 05:06:16.625
STATE DEPARTMENT FOR HIS 
POLITICAL BENEFIT. THE FACTS 

05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:20.600
SHOW ABUSE OF POWER.  THEY'RE 
TALKING PAST EACH OTHER. 

05:06:20.601 --> 05:06:24.990
&gt;&gt; IT'S NO RULE BOOK FOR 
CONGRESS AND TURNS TO PAGE 47 

05:06:25.210 --> 05:06:29.085
AND SAYS ABUSE OF POWER, AND 
THERE'S A CHECKLIST FOR ALL OF 

05:06:29.300 --> 05:06:32.340
THE THINGS THAT FIT THAT 
CRITERIA.  IT'S A JUDGMENT CALL 

05:06:32.560 --> 05:06:35.096
THAT THESE ELECTED 
REPRESENTATIVES ARE BEING ASKED 

05:06:35.321 --> 05:06:38.361
TO DO, AND THAT'S THE WAY THE 
FOUNDERS SET UP THE SYSTEM.  

05:06:38.786 --> 05:06:42.336
IT'S AN ENTIRE POLITICAL 
PROCESS, AND THAT'S BY DESIGN.  

05:06:42.596 --> 05:06:46.319
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A CRIMINAL 
PROCESS AND DIFFERENT THAN WHAT 

05:06:46.744 --> 05:06:50.290
YOU OR I WOULD GO THROUGH IN A 
COURT OF LAW ACCUSED PHOTOGRAPH 

05:06:50.509 --> 05:06:53.329
CRIME.  AND THE CHALLENGE IS NOT
ONLY TO CONVINCE THEIR 

05:06:53.550 --> 05:06:57.086
COLLEAGUES IN THAT COMMITTEE BUT
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WHAT 

05:06:57.406 --> 05:07:01.601
TRUMP HAS DONE IS WORTHY OF 
IMPEACHMENT.  THEY'VE HAD A HARD

05:07:01.841 --> 05:07:04.745
TIME MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THAT 
POLLING. 

05:07:04.746 --> 05:07:08.436
&gt;&gt; LET'S LISTEN TO THE 
CONGRESSMAN FROM THE REPUBLICAN 

05:07:09.066 --> 05:07:12.026
PERSPECTIVE, AND HE SOUNDED 
AGITATED, AND OUR COLLEAGUE 

05:07:12.611 --> 05:07:15.606
REPORTED HE WAS HUDDLING WITH 
COUNSEL BEFORE HE LAUNCHED THIS 

05:07:15.926 --> 05:07:20.661
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO MAKE THE CASE 
AGAINST IMPEACHMENT.  

05:07:20.662 --> 05:07:25.067
&gt;&gt;  THIS NOTION OF ABUSE OF 
POWER IS LOWEST IN IMPEACHMENT 

05:07:25.416 --> 05:07:29.210
THEORIES.  HECK, I DON'T KNOW 
ANY POLITICAL PARTIES THAT DON'T

05:07:29.420 --> 05:07:32.934
THINK WITH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
WHITE HOUSE THAT DON'T HAVE 

05:07:33.649 --> 05:07:39.366
ABUSE OF POWER.  I HAVE A LOT OF
CONSTITUENTS THAT THINK BARACK 

05:07:42.597 --> 05:07:44.597
OBAMA ABUSES 

05:07:47.646 --> 05:07:50.225
SEDHIS POWER. YOU SET THE 
STANDARD. IT'S BIPARTISAN AND 

05:07:50.448 --> 05:07:53.529
OVERWHELMING.  I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; LOW ENERGY, SOUNDS LIKE A 

05:07:53.989 --> 05:07:56.919
CALL TO SOMEONE AND A WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE THE AUDIENCE 

05:07:57.134 --> 05:08:01.664
HAS WON.  WE ALL REMEMBER THE 
2016 CAMPAIGN WHERE THE THEN 

05:08:01.983 --> 05:08:06.849
CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP USED THAT
WORD LOW ENERGY TO TEAR DOWN 

05:08:07.264 --> 05:08:10.659
BUSH AND PREVENT THE FLORIDA 
GOVERNOR FROM GAINING ANY 

05:08:10.924 --> 05:08:13.934
TRACTION IN THAT RACE AND USED 
IT 

05:08:18.946 --> 05:08:23.454
QUITE EFFECTIVELY. IT'S ONE OF 
THE CATCH PHRASES THAT HE GAVE 

05:08:23.669 --> 05:08:26.074
THE CONGRESSMAN FROM FLL. I'M 
SURE THEY KNOW HE'S ONE OF THE 

05:08:26.279 --> 05:08:28.699
MOST TRUSTED ALLIES IN THE HOUSE
AND USED HIS PERCH ON THE 

05:08:28.919 --> 05:08:30.919
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO REALLY 

05:08:34.160 --> 05:08:40.146
ARTICULATE A FIERY TRUMP 
&gt;&gt;  THE CONGRESSMAN HAS A LOT ON

05:08:40.727 --> 05:08:44.462
HIS PLATE, AND THIS IS THE 
MOMENT WE'RE SEEING HIM TEAR 

05:08:46.759 --> 05:08:50.429
THROUGH AJNDA ITEMS BECAUSE IT'S
ACTIVITY ON CAPITOL HILL.  

05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:56.310
GENDA ITEMS BECAUSE IT'S 
ACTIVITY ON CAPITOL HILL.  

05:08:57.492 --> 05:09:00.102
MEMBERS WILL HANG OUT WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE? 

05:09:00.582 --> 05:09:06.089
&gt;&gt; YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.  IT'S ONE
OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE THEY HANG

05:09:06.303 --> 05:09:11.514
OUT AT THE HOUSE, AND THEY PUT 
ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND IT'S

05:09:12.743 --> 05:09:14.743
THE CONGRESSIONAL BALL.  IT'S 
HOSTED BY 

05:09:18.904 --> 05:09:21.433
THE FIRST LADY. IT'S TRADITION. 
IT'S UNCLEAR WHO WILL SHOW UP. I

05:09:21.688 --> 05:09:24.088
DON'T KNOW IF PELOSI WILL BE 
THERE OR ANY DEMOCRATS.  I 

05:09:24.312 --> 05:09:26.297
ASSUME IT WILL BE MOSTLY A 
REPUBLICAN GATHERING, BUT 

05:09:26.298 --> 05:09:29.728
NONETHELESS IT IS A SOCIAL EVENT
ON A VERY MOMENTOUS DAY IN TERMS

05:09:30.413 --> 05:09:33.653
OF THE IMPEACHMENT SERIES. 
&gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO GET A READING 

05:09:33.873 --> 05:09:37.703
FROM YOU BEFORE WE LET YOU GO.  
WHAT ARE THE OTHER AGENDA ITEMS 

05:09:38.403 --> 05:09:41.384
THEY HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH FROM 

05:09:46.274 --> 05:09:51.025
THIS PAIRNL PARENTAL LEAD, AND 
ALSO TRADE DEAL, NAFTA AND 

05:09:51.240 --> 05:09:53.240
SOMETHING THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT,
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE VIEWING 

05:09:53.410 --> 05:09:55.495
THOSE ITEMS? 
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE QUITE OPTIMISTIC 

05:09:56.165 --> 05:10:03.956
ABOUT THAT.  THE USMCA, THE 
TRAIT DEAL TO REPLACE NAFTA, THE

05:10:04.701 --> 05:10:07.961
PRESIDENT NEGOTIATED THE TERMS 
WITH THE CANADIANS MANY, MANY 

05:10:08.446 --> 05:10:12.312
MONTHS AGO, AND THAT BILL HAS 
BEN HOLDING IN CONGRESS FOR SOME

05:10:12.747 --> 05:10:16.438
TIME NOW.  THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 
BEEN PUSHING HARD FOR IT. AND 

05:10:16.653 --> 05:10:19.623
FINALLY IT WAS A BREAK THIS WEEK
WHEN SPEAKER PELOSI AND OTHER 

05:10:20.503 --> 05:10:25.122
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS ANNOUNCED 
SUPPORT FOR A COMPROINIZE OF THE

05:10:25.512 --> 05:10:29.597
UAMCA DEAL.  THAT BILL IS IN THE
SENATE AND PROBABLY WON'T GET 

05:10:29.982 --> 05:10:34.024
PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW UNTIL
EARLY NEXT YEAR. IT'S A 

05:10:34.234 --> 05:10:37.034
POLITICAL MOMENT TOO.  IT WAS A 
DECISION BY THE DEMOCRATS TO 

05:10:37.264 --> 05:10:41.864
MOVE THIS FORWARD, SO THEY'RE 
MORE VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC 

05:10:42.208 --> 05:10:45.834
LAWMAKERS SAY WE WEREN'T JUST 
IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT BUT 

05:10:46.058 --> 05:10:48.279
DOING BUSINESS FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND TRYING TO GET THINGS 

05:10:48.519 --> 05:10:52.876
DONE.  IT WILL STAND POTENTIALLY
AS ONLY THE LEGISLATIVE 

05:10:53.096 --> 05:10:56.776
ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS ENTIRE YEAR.
&gt;&gt; AND FINALLY AS WE TURN OUR 

05:10:56.986 --> 05:11:02.106
ATTENTION TO WHAT GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN JANUARY BECAUSE WE'RE 

05:11:06.921 --> 05:11:08.921
SEEING

05:11:19.853 --> 05:11:21.853
?  

05:12:08.885 --> 05:12:13.154
&gt;&gt;  ALL RIGHT.  STAY WITH US.  I
WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF A 

05:12:15.984 --> 05:12:21.468
TAPE FROM CONGRESSMAN JEREMY 
NADLER.  THIS IS THE RANKING 

05:12:21.698 --> 05:12:25.058
CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE, AND DOUG 
COLLINS.  EVEN AS THEY GO HEAD 

05:12:25.383 --> 05:12:27.968
TO HEAD, THEY HAVE A WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP. LET'S PLAY A 

05:12:28.258 --> 05:12:33.714
LITTLE BIT OF HOW TODAY STARTED.
&gt;&gt; BACK IN 2005, THE CHAIRMAN 

05:12:34.184 --> 05:12:36.954
SCHEDULED THE MINORITY DAY 
HEARING BUT CUT OFF WITNESSES, 

05:12:37.403 --> 05:12:44.527
SHUT OFF THE MICROPHONES AND 
SHUT OFF THE LIGHTS AND REFUSED 

05:12:44.992 --> 05:12:48.357
RECOGNITION WHEN THEY REFUSED TO
SPEAK.  NO ONE IN THE MAJORITY 

05:12:50.707 --> 05:12:54.736
ARGUED OUR ROTHS.  IT'S NO 
PRACTICE FOR THE POINT OF ORDER.

05:12:55.181 --> 05:12:57.626
FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, I 
DON'T SUSTAIN THE 

05:13:01.616 --> 05:13:04.532
POINT OF ORDER. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I THINK THAT 

05:13:04.761 --> 05:13:10.041
THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION, THIS 
STRUCK A NERVE SAYING IN 

05:13:10.371 --> 05:13:13.881
PREVIOUS RIGHTS, IT IS NOT THE 
CHAIRMAN'S RIGHT TO DECIDE 

05:13:14.101 --> 05:13:16.267
WHETHER IT IS SUFFICIENT OR 
WHETHER IT'S ACCEPTABLE OR 

05:13:16.782 --> 05:13:20.052
CHAIRMAN'S RIGHT TO VIOLATE THE 
RULES IN ORD TO INTERFERE.  IT 

05:13:20.267 --> 05:13:22.372
IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT THIS 
TIME HAS BECOME 

05:13:27.390 --> 05:13:29.390
THE ISSUE.

05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:34.510
&gt;&gt;  I WOULD LIKE THE 

05:13:37.480 --> 05:13:40.615
CHAIRMAN TO TAKE ONE MORE 
MINUTE. 

05:13:40.616 --> 05:13:44.196
&gt;&gt; DOES HE APPEAL, YES OR NO? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

05:13:44.197 --> 05:13:48.264
&gt;&gt; THE APPEAL OF THE RULING OF 
THE CHAIR IS NOT SUSTAINED. 

05:13:48.265 --> 05:13:51.580
&gt;&gt; I MOVE TO TABLE. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU ACTUALLY CALL FOR A 

05:13:51.805 --> 05:13:55.674
VOTE? HOW DO YOU NOT SUSTAIN AND
NOT CALL FOR A VOTE? 

05:13:55.675 --> 05:13:58.672
&gt;&gt; I SUSTAINED FOR A POINT OF 
ORDER. 

05:13:58.673 --> 05:14:02.038
&gt;&gt; I CALL FOR A BILL RULE OF 
CHAIR. AND I CALL FOR A VOTE. 

05:14:02.248 --> 05:14:05.127
&gt;&gt; I RULE THAT THE POINT OF 
ORDER IS NOT WELL TAKEN. 

05:14:05.128 --> 05:14:07.637
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S PAINFULLY 
OBVIOUS. 

05:14:07.638 --> 05:14:11.399
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.  LET'S GO TO 
CAPITOL HILL AND BRING IN OUR 

05:14:13.789 --> 05:14:18.600
COLLEAGUE WHO HAS BEEN THERE 
THIS MORNING. SO DO THEY SEEM TO

05:14:18.840 --> 05:14:21.310
HAVE A HEALTHY WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP?  DO THEY SEEM TO 

05:14:22.019 --> 05:14:24.019
GET ALONG? 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU KNOW WHEN I 

05:14:24.119 --> 05:14:26.990
WATCHED THESE TWO, IT'S ALSO 
FASCINATING TO ME TO SEE A 

05:14:27.230 --> 05:14:29.789
CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBER AND 
WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP AND LIKE.

05:14:30.214 --> 05:14:33.199
AND THESE TWO MEN, YOU CAN 
DETECT IT IS SOME LEVEL OF 

05:14:33.619 --> 05:14:35.619
RESPECT FOR WHAT BOTH 

05:14:40.069 --> 05:14:46.558
SIDES SAY I THINK HE GIVES HIM 
VIEW TO TALK AND INTERJECT. I 

05:14:46.784 --> 05:14:50.298
THINK THEY HAVE A REPORE THERE, 
BUT I CAN'T SPEAK ON PERSONAL 

05:14:50.636 --> 05:14:54.086
RELATIONSHIPS, BUT WE MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO FORGIVE THESE TWO MEN 

05:14:54.307 --> 05:14:56.927
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
HAVE SOME OF THE MOST WEIGHTY 

05:14:57.152 --> 05:15:01.127
ISSUES IN FRONT OF THEM THIS 
YEAR, THE RUSSIA PROBE, 

05:15:01.712 --> 05:15:03.712
OBSTRUCTION, GETTING SUBPOENAS 
FROM SOME OF THE WITNESSES THEY 

05:15:03.882 --> 05:15:06.697
WANTED TO HEAR FROM, DEALING 
WITH THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, 

05:15:07.152 --> 05:15:10.437
SO IF IT IS RANCOR, IT IS 
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT IS A LOT OF 

05:15:10.887 --> 05:15:14.182
SERIOUS ISSUES IN FRONT OF THE 
TWO MEN, THEY SORT OF PER 

05:15:14.787 --> 05:15:18.427
SONIFIED BOTH OF THEIR SIDES AND
REPRESENT BOTH OF THEIR SIDE 

05:15:18.907 --> 05:15:21.117
VIEWED WITH THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION, AND WE KNOW IT'S

05:15:21.339 --> 05:15:23.902
WIDE GOALS BETWEEN THE TWO. 
&gt;&gt; SO RHONDA, THIS COMMITTEE IS 

05:15:24.122 --> 05:15:27.941
ON A BREAK FOR A VOTE. THERE'S 
SO MUCH ELSE HAPPENING ON 

05:15:28.162 --> 05:15:31.254
CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW. TAKE US 
THROUGH WHAT ELSE IS IN PLAY. 

05:15:31.472 --> 05:15:36.207
&gt;&gt; Reporter: RIGHT.  SO THEY 
BROKE FOR A VOTE ON THE HOUSE 

05:15:36.422 --> 05:15:39.037
FLOOR RIGHT NOW.  THAT IS A 
BILL.  IT IS ACTUALLY NAMED 

05:15:39.253 --> 05:15:47.387
AFTER THE LATE ELIJAH CUMMINGS. 
IT'S A LOWER DRUG PRICE FOR 

05:15:47.607 --> 05:15:49.286
MEDICAID AND MEDICARE 
RECIPIENTS. IT ISN'T SOMETHING 

05:15:49.287 --> 05:15:51.707
SUPPORTED BY REPUBLICANS RIGHT 
NOW.  IT WILL PROBABLY PASS THE 

05:15:51.917 --> 05:15:55.333
HOUSE BUT PROBABLY NOT PASS THE 
SENATE EVEN IF TAKEN UP, AND THE

05:15:55.761 --> 05:15:59.218
PRESIDENT HAS MENTIONED THAT HE 
WILL VETO IT IF IT DID PASS THE 

05:15:59.634 --> 05:16:03.140
SENATE.  SPEAKER PELOSI HAS BEEN
SPEAKING ACTUALLY ALL DAY ABOUT 

05:16:03.361 --> 05:16:05.645
THIS.  SHE HAD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE A LITTLE BIT AGO 

05:16:05.871 --> 05:16:09.356
TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO PASS 
THIS, AND THE LAST FEW WEEKS 

05:16:09.976 --> 05:16:13.054
AND- HOAR WEEKLY PRESSERS, SHE 
USUALLY BEGINS TALKING ABOUT 

05:16:13.279 --> 05:16:18.224
THIS BILL AND HOW IT'S 
IMPORTANT.  SO YEAH, A LOT OF 

05:16:18.462 --> 05:16:21.789
BIG ISSUES HAPPENING HERE IN THE
HOUSE. AND ALSO, BETSY, THE 

05:16:22.029 --> 05:16:26.849
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION IS HERE 
TESTIFYING TO THE COMMITTEE ON 

05:16:27.143 --> 05:16:31.173
THE FACT THAT THERE WERE STUDENT
LOAN RECIPIENTS WHO WERE 

05:16:31.558 --> 05:16:35.852
DEFRAUDED BY FOR-PROFIT SCHOOLS.
SO AGAIN, ANOTHER BIG ISSUE 

05:16:36.201 --> 05:16:40.721
THERE TOO. SO A LOT AN ALWAYS 
HAPPENING ON THE HILL ALONGSIDE 

05:16:40.936 --> 05:16:43.750
THIS IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION. 
&gt;&gt; WELL, RHONDA COLEMAN, THANK 

05:16:44.451 --> 05:16:48.591
YOU SO: HOPEFULLY YOU'LL GET A 
BRIEF BREAK BEFORE YOU HEAD BACK

05:16:48.811 --> 05:16:51.441
INTO THE HEARING ROOM.  TURNING 
BACK TO AMBER PHILLIPS, REPORT 

05:16:51.681 --> 05:16:57.664
FOR THE 6, AND JACKIE WHO WRITES
OUR MORNING NEWS LETTER.  

05:17:01.325 --> 05:17:07.199
I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT 
STANDS OUT TO YOU, AND EVEN 

05:17:07.949 --> 05:17:10.285
THOUGH A MARKUP IS VERY 

05:17:15.090 --> 05:17:17.090
PROCEDURAL, IT'S

05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:24.485
A BIG MOMENT BECAUSE WE EXPECT 
THEM TO GET 

05:17:27.665 --> 05:17:30.536
OUT TODAY.  WHAT'S STANDING OUT 
TOO? 

05:17:30.537 --> 05:17:33.007
&gt;&gt; IT MIGHT SOUND CYNICAL, BUT I
THINK 

05:17:38.008 --> 05:17:40.989
THE INEVITABLY 

05:17:46.009 --> 05:17:48.009
INEVTU

05:17:54.500 --> 05:17:59.411
INEVTABILITY, YOU ARE THE WHITE 
HOUSE  SENATE PREPARING FOR A 

05:17:59.621 --> 05:18:02.250
TRIAL AND MOVE THROUGH IT AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

05:18:02.251 --> 05:18:06.045
&gt;&gt; ONE THING WE'RE WATCHING FOR 
IS DEFECTIONS.  BE DON'T EXPECT 

05:18:06.260 --> 05:18:09.195
TO SEE DEFECTIONS ON THIS 
COMMITTEE, AND WE HEARD LAST 

05:18:09.415 --> 05:18:13.830
NIGHT ON THE OPENING STATEMENTS,
EVERYONE WAS QUITE SOLID ON THE 

05:18:14.045 --> 05:18:17.650
DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND REPUBLICAN 
SIDE, BUT HOUSE LEADERSHIP IS 

05:18:17.869 --> 05:18:21.914
PREPARING FOR POSSIBLE SANCTIONS
WHEN THE FULL HOUSE VOTES. 

05:18:21.915 --> 05:18:25.204
&gt;&gt; YEAH.  THIS IS NOT EXPECTED 
SINCE WE KNEW. 

05:18:25.205 --> 05:18:28.874
&gt;&gt; NOT UNEXPECTED? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  SINCE WE KNEW IT 

05:18:29.094 --> 05:18:32.254
WAS 30 DEMOCRATS WHO WON AND 
HELPED DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE IN

05:18:32.879 --> 05:18:37.184
DISTRICTS THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP, 
AND THEY ARE ONE REASON, 30 

05:18:37.704 --> 05:18:40.854
REASONS NANCY PELOSI HAS WAITED 
THIS LONG TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT. 

05:18:41.384 --> 05:18:46.699
AND SO OUR COLLEAGUES REPORTED 
LAST NIGHT THAT DEMOCRATIC 

05:18:47.402 --> 05:18:50.932
LEADER ARE EXPECTING AT LEAST 
TWO DEFECTIONS.  WE KNOW IT WAS 

05:18:51.152 --> 05:18:53.832
TWO DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED AGAINST 
THE RULES SETTING UP IMPEACHMENT

05:18:54.213 --> 05:18:58.697
WHICH WAS KIND OF A PROXY VOTE, 
BUT AS MANY AS HALF A DOZEN AND 

05:18:58.947 --> 05:19:04.302
MAYBE MORE.  I WANT TO NOTE THAT
IS INTERESTING.  POLITICALLY, 

05:19:04.832 --> 05:19:11.938
IT'S NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF LEFT 
FIELD IN PART THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

05:19:12.233 --> 05:19:14.663
REPRESENTING THE TRUMP DISTRICT,
AND DOZENS OF REPUBLICANS VOTED 

05:19:14.883 --> 05:19:18.307
NOT TO IMPEACH HIM, AND THEY 
ACTUALLY HELPED SINK TWO 

05:19:18.652 --> 05:19:20.652
ARTICLES 

05:19:23.667 --> 05:19:26.577
OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST THE FOUR 
HE WANTED.  SO THIS WOULD BE A 

05:19:26.797 --> 05:19:29.972
NORMAL THING FOR IMPEACHMENT. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH.  WE'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG 

05:19:30.195 --> 05:19:32.915
THE HOUSE SPEAKER PELOSI WAS 
READY TO GO THROUGH THIS 

05:19:33.130 --> 05:19:37.940
PROCESS, AND WE'RE SEEING 
EXACTLY WHY RIGHT NOW, AND I 

05:19:38.160 --> 05:19:40.956
THINK THAT'S IN PART OF WHY 
YOU'RE SEEING THE PARALLEL 

05:19:41.491 --> 05:19:45.382
TRACKS OF THE POLICY BEING MOVED
FORWARD FROM THE SPEAKER 

05:19:45.776 --> 05:19:48.984
URTENDING THE REFORM IN MADRID 
DURING A REALLY MOMENTOUS PART 

05:19:49.234 --> 05:19:55.754
OF THIS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS TO 
USMCA GETTING PUSHED ONTO 

05:19:56.249 --> 05:20:01.158
THESONT.  THE SENATE.  BUT I 
THINK IT'S A FEW MEMBERS OF THE 

05:20:01.859 --> 05:20:05.814
HOUSE JUDICIARY, ONE IN 
PARTICULAR, LUCY MCBATH WHO I 

05:20:06.039 --> 05:20:09.179
THINK IS THE ONLY MEMBER ON THE 
COMMITTEE WHO COMES FROM, 

05:20:10.539 --> 05:20:13.889
REPRESENTS A VULNERABLE DISTRICT
WHO PREVIOUSLY VOTED FOR TRUMP 

05:20:15.129 --> 05:20:17.879
IN 2016, AND SHE DELIVERED A 

05:20:22.584 --> 05:20:26.329
PRETTY GOOD MESSAGE THAT THIS 
WAS NOT THE AMERICA HER SON 

05:20:26.664 --> 05:20:29.874
JORDAN WHO WAS KILLED BY GUN 
VIOLENCE WOULD HAVE WANTED.  I 

05:20:30.099 --> 05:20:36.026
THINK IT DOES COME TO A MATTER, 
BOILS DOWN A MATTER OF WHAT IS 

05:20:36.264 --> 05:20:40.249
THE MOAT ECSPEED I WENT THING 
POLITICALLY FOR DEMOCRATS TO DO,

05:20:40.693 --> 05:20:44.565
OR DO THEY BELIEVE IT WILL HOLD 
A LOT OF WAIT IN YEARS TO COME. 

05:20:45.025 --> 05:20:47.570
IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE 
WAY THE WHITE HOUSE IS DOING 

05:20:47.785 --> 05:20:50.260
THIS IS THAT THE MEDIA HAS 
GOTTEN IT WRONG ALL ALONG.  

05:20:51.270 --> 05:20:55.327
EDWARD HAS BEEN SO CONCERNED 
WITH REPUBLICANS, AND KEEPING AN

05:20:55.847 --> 05:21:00.397
EYE ON MCROMNEY, AND WILL THEY 
VOTE TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, 

05:21:00.617 --> 05:21:04.047
AND IN REALITY, THEY THINK IT'S 
DEMOCRATS WE SHOULD ALL KEEP AN 

05:21:04.277 --> 05:21:08.573
EYE ON IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE, 
PEOPLE LIKE JOE AND DOUG CALL 

05:21:11.723 --> 05:21:13.723
WHOONZ ARE VULNERABLE. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT ONE, JACKIE.  YOU KNOW,

05:21:13.912 --> 05:21:17.631
DO YOU GET THE SENSE THAT 
SPEAKER PELOSI IS SUCCEEDING IN 

05:21:18.001 --> 05:21:20.861
THE MESSAGING OF WE WEREN'T 
IMPEACHING PRESIDENT TRUMP A 

05:21:21.491 --> 05:21:24.741
YEAR AGO.  WE ARE WORKING ON 
THIS NOW, AND SHE'S TRYING TO 

05:21:25.196 --> 05:21:29.174
HAVE THIS VERY SOLEMN TONE.  SHE
IS QUOTING EVERYTHING FROM 

05:21:29.399 --> 05:21:32.854
SCRIPTURE TO THE CONSTITUTION TO
FOUNDING FATHERS WHEN SHE TALKS 

05:21:34.019 --> 05:21:38.036
ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.  JACKIE, DO 
YOU THINK THAT IS RESINATING 

05:21:38.751 --> 05:21:42.201
FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING, THAT 

05:21:42.422 --> 05:21:46.067
THE STORY AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE
CHANGED.  IT'S NOT THE THE 

05:21:46.297 --> 05:21:49.876
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ON THIS 
IMPEACHMENT PATH ALL ALONG WHICH

05:21:50.092 --> 05:21:54.346
IS WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING 
TO IMPRUCH.  

05:21:54.347 --> 05:21:57.273
&gt;&gt;  IT IT'S A CONTRAST BETWEEN 
THE WAY DEMOCRATS ARE SPEAKING 

05:21:57.623 --> 05:22:00.213
AND THE WAY REPUBLICANS AND 
RHETORIC REPUBLICANS ARE USING 

05:22:00.443 --> 05:22:03.903
AND HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO COME 
ACROSS AS COMBATIVE, AGGRESSIVE 

05:22:04.953 --> 05:22:08.951
AND REALLY ON THE DEFENSIVE FOR 
THE PRESIDENT.  SO, YOU KNOW, 

05:22:10.071 --> 05:22:15.376
I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE HOUSE 
SPEAKER PELOSI, IF THAT'S 

05:22:15.601 --> 05:22:22.252
RESINATING WITH VOTERS PER SE, 
SOME WHO HAVE TUNED OUT, SOME 

05:22:22.463 --> 05:22:27.033
WHO HAVE BEEN BEEN IN 
BATTLEGROUNDS AND THEY TAPERER 

05:22:27.248 --> 05:22:33.278
OFF FOR THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.
I DO THINK IT WILL BE A NEWT  

05:22:33.593 --> 05:22:36.798
NEW GRAVITY.  YOU WILL HAVE THEM
SITTING ON THE BENCH 

05:22:37.183 --> 05:22:39.534
CIRCUMSTANCE DAYS A WEEK AND 
LISTENING TO TESTIMONY AND 

05:22:39.755 --> 05:22:42.944
DEBATE. IT WILL PUT A PAUSE ON 
THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, SO I 

05:22:43.934 --> 05:22:46.974
THINK REGARDLESS OF WHAT, YOU 
KNOW, HOUSE SPEAKER PELOSI HAS 

05:22:47.324 --> 05:22:50.521
BEEN ABLE TO COMPLISH, THE NEW 
PHASE OF IF AND WHEN THIS DOES 

05:22:50.811 --> 05:22:54.640
MAKE IT TO THE SENATE, WILL FEEL
CONSEQUENTIAL. 

05:22:54.641 --> 05:22:58.405
&gt;&gt; OKAY.  LET'S TALK ABOUT 
PROCESS A LITTLE BIT, WHAT 

05:22:58.625 --> 05:23:02.680
HAPPENING TODAY, THESE TWO 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT ARE 

05:23:02.902 --> 05:23:06.250
ESSENTIALLY BEING MARKED UP, AND
IT'S IDEAS BEING PROPOSED OR 

05:23:06.460 --> 05:23:11.127
SUGGESTED. ONE OF THEM WAS TO 
CHANGE IT FROM DONALD J. TRUMP 

05:23:11.702 --> 05:23:16.027
TO DONALD JOHN TRUMP.  GET THAT 
IMMEDIATELY CHANGED.  BUT WE'VE 

05:23:16.287 --> 05:23:21.337
SEEN REPUBLICANS TRY TO PUT 
STUFF OUT THERE.  JORDAN PUSHING

05:23:21.567 --> 05:23:25.993
BACK AGAINST THE ABUSE OF POWER 
WHICH IS A KEY PART OF THE 

05:23:26.417 --> 05:23:29.549
ARTICLES, AND WE HEARD MATT 
GATES. HE WANTED TO TAKE OUT 

05:23:29.779 --> 05:23:33.429
REFERENCES TO FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND PUT IN 

05:23:33.648 --> 05:23:39.622
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT BURISMA 
AND  HUNTER BIDEN, AND THEN HE 

05:23:39.837 --> 05:23:42.872
WENT ON A TEAR ABOUT THE DRUG 
PROBLEMS THAT HUNTER BIDEN 

05:23:43.352 --> 05:23:46.232
TALKED ABOUT, AND HE TALKED 
ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF BUYING 

05:23:46.452 --> 05:23:50.756
DRUGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AND 
IT WAS VERY INFLAMMATORY.  WE 

05:23:51.451 --> 05:23:54.376
SAW PUSHBACK AFTER THAT. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH. I WAS LIKE THIS WHOLE 

05:23:54.596 --> 05:23:59.116
THING IS SO DRAMATIC, AND 
LAWMAKERS KNOW THIS IS A 

05:23:59.591 --> 05:24:02.550
DRAMATIC MOMENT, AND I THOUGHT 
SOMETIMES THE DRAMA CAME ACROSS 

05:24:03.041 --> 05:24:07.955
AS LIKE LUCY MCBATH TALKING 
ABOUT HER SON THAT DIED AND 

05:24:10.041 --> 05:24:14.659
REALITY TV --  ISH.  AND SO WHAT
HAPPENED THEY WANT TO MUDDY THE 

05:24:14.949 --> 05:24:18.659
WATERS ON WHO IS BEING 
INVESTIGATING AND/OR TRY TO 

05:24:19.434 --> 05:24:23.914
COMMUNICATE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WAS WAS RIGHT IN ASKING THEM TO 

05:24:24.194 --> 05:24:27.144
INVESTIGATE THE BIDENS.  IT'S 
THERE IN THE PHONE TRANSCRIPT.  

05:24:27.719 --> 05:24:32.426
YOU CAN'T DENY IT.  HOW DO THEY 
SEE IT AS AN OKAY THING TO DO.  

05:24:33.326 --> 05:24:36.837
THEY IMPUGN HUNTER BIDEN 
HIMSELF. YOU TALK ABOUT HIM 

05:24:37.056 --> 05:24:40.776
BEING ON THE BOARD OF BURISMA, 
AND HOW BURISMA IS CORRUPT WHICH

05:24:41.007 --> 05:24:45.372
NOBODY DISAGREED WITH, AND NEW A
FRANKLY SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT, HE

05:24:46.331 --> 05:24:49.919
GAVE MATT ON AND ON ABOUT A 
MASSIVE PUBLIC HEARING ABOUT 

05:24:50.252 --> 05:24:56.105
SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  HE OPENED UP 
AND TALKED ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE

05:24:56.315 --> 05:25:00.430
AND FAMILY PROBLEMS.  HE DOESN'T
HAVE A SQUEAKY CLEAN PROBLEM.  

05:25:09.505 --> 05:25:14.002
AND LIKE WHERE ARE WE GOING, AND
JOHNSON KINDLY GOES, I WOULDN'T 

05:25:14.327 --> 05:25:18.380
CALL, YOU KNOW, THE KETTLE 
BLACK. 

05:25:18.381 --> 05:25:20.017
&gt;&gt; YEAH, POT CALLING THE KETTLE 
BLACK. 

05:25:20.018 --> 05:25:23.708
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, POT CALLING THE 
KETTLE BLACK, AND CALLING OW 

05:25:25.883 --> 05:25:29.367
THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN 
ARRESTED FOR A DUI. 

05:25:29.368 --> 05:25:33.843
&gt;&gt; YEAH.  HE SAID BACKGROUND AND
HISTORY, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A 

05:25:34.798 --> 05:25:39.098
HISTORY OF DUI.  IT WAS A JOLT 
IN THE ROOM BECAUSE THEY KNOW 

05:25:39.388 --> 05:25:46.653
MATT HAS A DUI ON HIS RECORD.  
IT GOT DIRTY AND PERSONAL. 

05:25:46.654 --> 05:25:50.834
&gt;&gt; I WAS LAUGHING TO MYSELF FOR 
A MOMENT BECAUSE I WAS READING 

05:25:51.213 --> 05:25:54.727
LIVE COMMENTS ON THE LIVESTREAM,
AND IT WAS WHY ARE THE DEMOCRATS

05:25:55.797 --> 05:25:59.117
SPEAKING MORE CALMLY THAN THE 
REPUBLICANS.  BUT I THINK IT IS 

05:25:59.337 --> 05:26:03.107
PART OF THE TRAGEDY TO BE 
SERIOUS AND SOBER AND ABOUT 

05:26:03.326 --> 05:26:06.366
TOPICS THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
WEIGHING REALLY HEAVILY, AND 

05:26:06.781 --> 05:26:10.791
MATT GATES AND DOUG COLLINS AND 
GYM JORDAN ARE TRYING TO MUDDY 

05:26:11.026 --> 05:26:13.912
THE WATERS AND DEFLECT BECAUSE 
THEY REALIZE THAT, YOU 

05:26:18.942 --> 05:26:20.942
KNOW, THE

05:26:26.269 --> 05:26:30.223
FACTS WOULD HAVE CAME OUT DON'T 
EXONERATE THIS PRESIDENT. 

05:26:30.224 --> 05:26:34.774
&gt;&gt; AND VERY QUICKLY, THE 
PRESIDENT TWEETED SOMETHING I'VE

05:26:35.104 --> 05:26:39.934
BEEN WAITING FOR THEM TO ECHO, 
AND HE SAID I DID NOTHING WRONG.

05:26:41.504 --> 05:26:44.924
AND TALKING POINTS FROM THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP TO THIS 

05:26:45.319 --> 05:26:48.892
COMMITTEE SAID JUST SAY IT WAS 
AN IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT WHICH IS 

05:26:49.487 --> 05:26:52.687
DIFFERENT, AND I THINK THAT'S 
JUST INTERESTED EVEN IF THEY'RE 

05:26:54.087 --> 05:26:57.073
DEFENDING TRUMP, THEY'RE NOT 
WILLING TO GO AS FAR AS THE 

05:26:57.293 --> 05:27:00.302
PRESIDENT DOES 
&gt;&gt; OUR COLLEAGUE AARON HAD A 

05:27:02.123 --> 05:27:06.773
GREAT PIECE SAID IT WAS CRIMINAL
CONDUCT.  THE TWO ARTICLES OF 

05:27:07.109 --> 05:27:10.089
IMPEACHMENT AREN'T EXPLICITLY 
MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION 

05:27:10.749 --> 05:27:13.684
BECAUSE THEY ULTIMATELY DECIDED 
NOT TO INTRODUCE OBSTRUCTION OF 

05:27:13.899 --> 05:27:19.706
JUSTICE OR BRIBERY WHICH ARE TWO
CRIMES PER SE. 

05:27:19.707 --> 05:27:24.587
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.  JACKIE FROM THE 
RED POWER UP WHICH YOU CAN 

05:27:25.017 --> 05:27:28.151
SUBSCRIBE TO, AND AMBER PHILLIPS
WRITES THE EVENING NEWS LETTER. 

05:27:29.431 --> 05:27:33.076
AMBER STAY WITH US FOR A MOMENT.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY

05:27:33.282 --> 05:27:36.402
HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE 
EVEN THOUGH PROCEEDINGS ARE 

05:27:36.612 --> 05:27:38.793
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, TWO 
OTHERS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED A 

05:27:39.603 --> 05:27:43.698
LOT, BILL CLINTON AND RICHARD 
NIXON.  LET'S LISTEN TO 

05:27:45.028 --> 05:27:48.981
CONGRESSMAN FROM OHIO.  
&gt;&gt;  AND THE NEW MEMO IS GROUNDS 

05:27:49.206 --> 05:27:53.466
FOR IMPEACHMENT.  THE MAJORITY 
GOES TO GREATLENGTHS TO EXPLAIN 

05:27:53.797 --> 05:27:59.794
WHY ABUSE OF POWER IS GOOD.  AND
IT WAS BOTH RICHARD NIXON AND 

05:28:00.024 --> 05:28:03.718
BILLCLIPTEN.  WHAT THEY DON'T 
MENTION IS THAT THE HOUSE OF 

05:28:03.934 --> 05:28:07.385
REPRESENTATIVES NEVER ADOPTED 
ALLEGED ABUSE OF POWER AS IT IS 

05:28:07.594 --> 05:28:11.381
CHARGED IN IMPEACHMENT. WHO?  
BECAUSE IT'S NO CRIMINAL STATUTE

05:28:12.056 --> 05:28:16.311
ALLEGING WHAT ALLEGED ABUSE OF 
POWER ACTUALLY IS.  ABUSE OF 

05:28:16.741 --> 05:28:21.914
POWER IS A VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS 
TERM OPEN TO INTERPRETATION FOR 

05:28:22.130 --> 05:28:27.084
EVERY INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT 
LACKS A CONCISE DEFINITION IT IS

05:28:27.304 --> 05:28:31.496
A HIGHER BURDEN OF PROOF TO SHOW
THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT 

05:28:31.711 --> 05:28:33.711
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF 
IMPEACHMENT.  

05:29:18.748 --> 05:29:20.748
CONSTITUTION SAYS 

05:30:05.163 --> 05:30:08.983
PROTECT AGAINST SOME KIND OF 
ABUSE THEY COULDN'T IMAGINE. 

05:30:09.142 --> 05:30:12.223
THEY DIDN'T LIST OUT EVERY CRIME
THEY COULD THINK OF A LAWMAKER 

05:30:12.463 --> 05:30:15.913
DOING. IT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE TO
SAY THIS IS WHY WE THINK TRUMP, 

05:30:16.183 --> 05:30:19.544
THE KEY TERM IN THIS 
CONSTITUTION, IS TRUMP MEANT 

05:30:19.884 --> 05:30:22.982
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOR. 
&gt;&gt; AS THIS HAS ALL BEEN GOING  

05:30:23.323 --> 05:30:26.995
ON, YOU REPORTED THIS GREAT  
LEAD, EVEN AS THE HOUSE BEGAN 

05:30:27.803 --> 05:30:29.593
DRAFTING CHARGES AGAINST 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HIS PRIVATE 

05:30:29.594 --> 05:30:31.594
ATTORNEY, WHO MANY BELIEVE IS 
PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LEADING 

05:30:31.984 --> 05:30:36.483
TRUMP ON THE PATH TO HIS LIKELY 
IMPEACHMENT MADE AN AUDACIOUS 

05:30:36.625 --> 05:30:39.084
TRIP TO THE COUNTRY AT THE 
CENTER OF THE SCANDAL. THIS IS 

05:30:39.235 --> 05:30:43.714
RUDY GIULIANI TRAVELING TO KIEV.
WHAT ARE PEOPLE MAKING OF THIS 

05:30:45.088 --> 05:30:48.314
RIGHT NOW? WE HEARD MATT GATES 
ON THE SUNDAY SHOW SAY IT WAS 

05:30:49.034 --> 05:30:51.414
WEIRD. MATT GATES WE TALKED 
ABOUT A MAJOR DEFENDER OF 

05:30:52.085 --> 05:30:54.085
PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO WHAT'S THE 
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT RUDY 

05:30:54.174 --> 05:30:56.824
GIULIANI IS UP TO? 
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A SENSE AS WITH MANY 

05:30:57.074 --> 05:30:59.244
THINGS IN THIS ADMINISTRATION 
AND THIS WHITE HOUSE, THERE'S A 

05:30:59.623 --> 05:31:02.614
DOUBLING DOWN OF WHAT WAS GOING 
ON BEFORE. SO YOU KNOW, I WAS 

05:31:02.774 --> 05:31:07.694
RIGHT TO PURSUE THIS AGENDA, I'M
GOING TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS

05:31:07.914 --> 05:31:09.914
AGENDA. REMEMBER THAT RUDY 
GIULIANI WENT THERE WITH 

05:31:13.124 --> 05:31:17.044
A DOCUMENTARY CREW FROM ONE 
AMERICA NEWS NETWORK THE IDEA 

05:31:17.194 --> 05:31:20.824
WAS TO PUT OUT IN VIDEO FORM 
ARGUMENTS RUDY GIULIANI HAD BEEN

05:31:20.985 --> 05:31:24.024
MAKING ON FOX NEWS THROUGHOUT 
THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AND THIS

05:31:24.348 --> 05:31:26.434
ALSO HAPPENED BEFORE REPORTING 
WE HAD IN THE PAPER THAT THE 

05:31:26.615 --> 05:31:30.914
SENATE IS NARROWING IN ON AN 
IDEA OF HAVING A TRIAL WITH NO 

05:31:31.064 --> 05:31:33.155
WITNESSES. A QUICK TRIAL THAT 
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GO INTO THE

05:31:33.415 --> 05:31:36.098
DETAILS OF EVERYTHING THAT'S 
BEEN GOING ON. IF THAT WEREN'T 

05:31:36.244 --> 05:31:40.494
TO HAVE  HAPPENED, YOU WOULD 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE 

05:31:41.465 --> 05:31:45.465
SOME CONTENT TO SHOW SORT OF THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE 

05:31:45.619 --> 05:31:49.013
ARGUMENTS. AND RUDY GIULIANI WAS
PUTTING TOGETHER ALL OF THIS 

05:31:49.254 --> 05:31:54.784
NARRATIVE BEFORE THE SUSPECTED 
SENATE TRIAL. SO I THINK RUDY 

05:31:57.468 --> 05:31:59.925
GIULIANI HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO 
DELIVER A REPORT ON HIS 

05:32:00.074 --> 05:32:02.434
ACTIVITIES, WHAT HE'S GATHERED. 
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE THIS 

05:32:02.774 --> 05:32:05.053
MIGHT END UP COINCIDING WITH THE
SENATE TRIAL. 

05:32:05.054 --> 05:32:08.187
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR HIM TO 
DELIVER A REPORT? IS IT LIKE A 

05:32:08.905 --> 05:32:12.714
FORMAL PROCESS THAT WOULD BE 
USED? I MEAN -- 

05:32:12.715 --> 05:32:15.485
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK 
YOU'VE SEEN HAPPENING THROUGHOUT

05:32:16.199 --> 05:32:20.205
THIS PROCESS IS UKRAINE IS A 
VERY COMPLICATED PLACE TO 

05:32:20.364 --> 05:32:25.989
UNDERSTAND AND MOST AMERICANS 
DON'T HAVE, NOR SHOULD THEY 

05:32:26.144 --> 05:32:29.245
NECESSARILY HAVE A DETAILED 
UNDERSTAND OF UKRAINIAN 

05:32:29.404 --> 05:32:33.204
PROSECUTORS INTERNATIONAL 
POLITICS IN UKRAINE. SO WHEN 

05:32:33.364 --> 05:32:37.065
RUDY GIULIANI INTERVIEWS 
SPECIFIC PEOPLE AND SORT OF 

05:32:37.904 --> 05:32:39.904
CHERRY PICKS INFORMATION IN 
ORDER TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT WHAT

05:32:40.465 --> 05:32:44.085
HE'S SAYING IS CORRUPTION ON JOE
BIDEN'S PART IN UKRAINE, THAT 

05:32:44.525 --> 05:32:47.554
STUFF CAN STICK BECAUSE IT'S 
VERY DIFFICULT TO -- YOU HAVE TO

05:32:48.035 --> 05:32:51.944
SORT OF EXPLAIN THE ENTIRE 
CONTEXT IN UKRAINE AND PEOPLE 

05:32:52.115 --> 05:32:54.835
DON'T REALLY NECESSARILY HAVE 
SORT OF PATIENCE FOR THAT KIND 

05:32:55.755 --> 05:32:59.095
OF ARGUMENT. SO BRINGING THAT 
ARGUMENT BACK DURING A SENATE 

05:32:59.284 --> 05:33:03.243
TRIAL COULD CERTAINLY BE 
HELPFUL. 

05:33:03.244 --> 05:33:05.925
&gt;&gt;&gt; OKAY. SO EVEN AS THAT'S 
HAPPENING, WE SEE THIS 

05:33:06.284 --> 05:33:12.885
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS MARCHING ON.
DO YOU GET THE SENSE OF HOW 

05:33:13.045 --> 05:33:17.504
REPUBLICANS ARE VIEWING THE ROLE
OF RUDY GIULIANI RIGHT NOW? IS 

05:33:17.655 --> 05:33:20.654
THERE AN APPETITE FOR HIM TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THIS? DOES THE WHITE

05:33:20.805 --> 05:33:23.704
HOUSE HAVE AN APPETITE FOR HIM 
TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS? 

05:33:23.705 --> 05:33:26.615
&gt;&gt; WE'VE HEARD MIXED THINGS ON 
THAT FRONT. WE'VE HEARD WHITE 

05:33:26.755 --> 05:33:29.315
HOUSE  OFFICIALS SAY THEY REALLY
DON'T WANT HIM INVOLVED. BUT HE 

05:33:29.455 --> 05:33:31.915
CONTINUES TO SAY THE PRESIDENT 
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AND THAT 

05:33:32.405 --> 05:33:36.515
HE'S COMPILING THIS REPORT AND 
THE PRESIDENT KNOWS ABOUT THAT. 

05:33:36.655 --> 05:33:40.347
SO THERE SEEMS TO BE DIVISION IN
THE TRUMP CAMP ABOUT WHAT ROLE 

05:33:40.495 --> 05:33:42.674
THEY WANT RUDY GIULIANI TO PLAY 
GOING FORWARD. RUDY GIULIANI IS 

05:33:42.925 --> 05:33:44.925
ALSO UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR 

05:33:47.899 --> 05:33:50.264
HIS ACTIVITIES BY THE SOUTHERN 
DEMOCRATIC OF NEW YORK WHICH HAS

05:33:50.405 --> 05:33:53.415
ALL READY INDICTED TWO OF HIS 
ASSOCIATES WHO WERE WORKING WITH

05:33:53.655 --> 05:33:57.214
HIM ON UKRAINIAN ISSUES OVER THE
COURSE OF THE YEAR. AND I THINK 

05:33:57.555 --> 05:34:00.314
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AS THE 
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS SORT OF 

05:34:00.465 --> 05:34:04.715
COMES TO A CLOSE WITH THE VOTE 
AND THEN WHAT WE ASSUME WILL BE 

05:34:05.436 --> 05:34:09.315
A FAIRLY QUICK TRIAL IN THE 
SENATE, THE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC 

05:34:09.465 --> 05:34:14.477
OF NEW YORK PROCESS WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

05:34:14.975 --> 05:34:17.254
YEAR AND THAT WILL COINCIDE WITH
THE ELECTION. 

05:34:17.255 --> 05:34:20.015
&gt;&gt; DO YOU GET THE SENSE THAT 
REPUBLICANS JUST WANT RUDY 

05:34:20.255 --> 05:34:22.749
GIULIANI TO GO AWAY. 
&gt;&gt; THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH 

05:34:22.955 --> 05:34:26.105
HIM. THIS IS A SAFE ASSUMPTION. 
I HAVEN'T DONE MY OWN REPORTING 

05:34:26.605 --> 05:34:32.945
ON THIS. BUT LISTEN, YOU HEARD 
TRUMP'S OWN EUROPEAN UNION 

05:34:33.095 --> 05:34:35.945
AMBASSADOR SAY I DIDN'T THINK IT
WAS GOOD IDEA FOR RUDY GIULIANI 

05:34:36.205 --> 05:34:38.915
TO LEAD THIS UKRAINE POLICY. HE 
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT UKRAINE. 

05:34:39.065 --> 05:34:42.325
HE'S NOT A DIPLOMAT. HE'S NOT A 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. WHAT IS 

05:34:42.907 --> 05:34:45.745
GOING ON? IN ADDITION HE HAS HIS
OWN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, 

05:34:46.199 --> 05:34:49.614
BUSINESS WISE, WHICH YOU GUYS 
HAVE  REPORTED ON EXTENSIVELY. 

05:34:49.764 --> 05:34:53.305
SO I THINK WE CAN EXTRAPOLATE 
FROM THAT THAT REPUBLICAN 

05:34:53.525 --> 05:34:57.364
SENATORS WHO ARE SMART AND 
UNDERSTAND GOOD POLITICS AND BAD

05:34:57.845 --> 05:34:59.909
POLITICS DO NOT WANT RUDY 
GIULIANI INVOLVED IN ANY OF  

05:35:00.584 --> 05:35:03.285
THIS. COLLEAGUES HAVE RECORDED 
THAT LINDSAY GRAHAM, THE 

05:35:03.645 --> 05:35:06.665
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE IS HAVING HIS OWN 

05:35:06.825 --> 05:35:09.465
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BIDENS. 
HE HASN'T CALLED RUDY GIULIANI 

05:35:09.614 --> 05:35:13.145
TO COME TALK ABOUT THIS. EVEN AS
RUDY GIULIANI COMES BACK FROM 

05:35:13.765 --> 05:35:18.275
UKRAINE WAVING LIKE SOME REPORT 
HE'S GOING TO GIVE THEM. I'M 

05:35:18.485 --> 05:35:22.269
SPECULATING HERE THAT COULD BE 
ONE REASON WHY OUR REPORTING 

05:35:22.416 --> 05:35:24.804
SAID MITCH McCONNELL DOESN'T 
WANT ANY WITNESSES. 

05:35:24.805 --> 05:35:27.887
&gt;&gt; ONE THING YOU'VE BEEN 
REPORTING ON IS THIS QUESTION OF

05:35:28.976 --> 05:35:32.588
HOW SECURE THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONVERSATION IS. HOW SECURE THE 

05:35:32.789 --> 05:35:35.075
CONVERSATIONS ARE OF PEOPLE THAT
ARE ARE WORKING FOR HIM. AND 

05:35:35.745 --> 05:35:39.276
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  SHOCKING 
MOMENTS WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS 

05:35:39.449 --> 05:35:43.355
BEEN BRAGGING OR TALKING ABOUT 
HIS  COMMUNICATIONS, WE SAW THIS

05:35:45.375 --> 05:35:48.396
IN MAR-A-LAGO. BUT ALSO THIS 
INVESTIGATION PROCESS HAS 

05:35:48.575 --> 05:35:53.055
REVEALED SOME VERY SURPRISING 
DECISIONS BY TRUMP ALLIES TO 

05:35:54.336 --> 05:35:58.376
HAVE A CONVERSATION AND, YOU 
KNOW, IN A RESTAURANT IN UKRAINE

05:35:58.526 --> 05:36:02.179
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES NOW, DEMOCRATS ARE 

05:36:03.696 --> 05:36:07.455
CRITICAL OF THIS. BUT, WHAT IS 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

05:36:07.715 --> 05:36:10.295
SAYING ABOUT IT? 
&gt;&gt; FOR THE INTELLIGENCE 

05:36:10.445 --> 05:36:15.696
COMMUNITY, THIS IS AN ON SEC 
MIGHT MARRY, IT'S HOW YOU 

05:36:15.945 --> 05:36:19.478
CONTROL YOUR COMMUNICATIONS TO 
THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY TO 

05:36:20.196 --> 05:36:22.196
ENSURE THE A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
IS 

05:36:24.898 --> 05:36:29.445
NOT EAVESDROPPING ON THEM. YOU 
SEE THIS ON THE DOOR. DON'T DO 

05:36:29.599 --> 05:36:32.685
THINGS WITH YOUR COMPUTER THAT 
MIGHT MAKE YOU MORE VULNERABLE 

05:36:32.886 --> 05:36:36.490
TO THIS KIND OF EAVESDROP 
ORGANIZE SPYING. AND WHAT'S 

05:36:36.725 --> 05:36:42.146
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS ENTIRE 
PROCESS AND YOU SEE CERTAIN ON 

05:36:43.179 --> 05:36:45.179
SEC VULNERABILITIES IN THE 

05:36:49.936 --> 05:36:51.936
REPORT. GORE DAN

05:37:01.996 --> 05:37:03.996
GORDON

05:37:11.956 --> 05:37:16.725
SUMLAND. ADAM SCHIFF AND THE 
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 

05:37:17.056 --> 05:37:19.466
SUBPOENAS PHONE ORDERS, RUDY 
GIULIANI'S PHONE RECORDS, AS 

05:37:19.625 --> 05:37:23.816
WELL AS ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES 
AND WHAT YOU SAW IN THOSE PHONE 

05:37:24.036 --> 05:37:28.316
RECORDS IS DURING KEY MOMENTS OF
THE UKRAINE SAGA THE DAY FOR 

05:37:28.534 --> 05:37:30.534
EXAMPLE THAT THE U.S. AMBASSADOR
TO UKRAINE 

05:37:35.036 --> 05:37:37.056
WAS RECALLED, RUDY GIULIANI WAS 
FURIOUSLY CALLING THE WHITE 

05:37:37.776 --> 05:37:40.385
HOUSE. BECAUSE THE RECORDS ARE  
SUBPOENAED FROM AT&amp;T YOU KNOW 

05:37:40.545 --> 05:37:46.136
THAT HE'S SPEAKING ON A CELL 
PHONE, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, EVEN

05:37:46.497 --> 05:37:50.076
IF IT'S ON A SECURE WHITE HOUSE 
LINE, A SECURE WHITE HOUSE HAND 

05:37:50.436 --> 05:37:54.676
LINE, IF HE'S ON AN OPEN CELL 
PHONE LINE, THAT'S A HUGELY 

05:37:54.890 --> 05:37:56.890
VULNERABLE ENVIRONMENT TO 
DISCUSS ANYTHING SENSITIVE. AND 

05:37:57.855 --> 05:38:01.306
THE RECALL OF THE U.S. 
AMBASSADOR OF UKRAINE WOULD BE 

05:38:01.526 --> 05:38:04.026
SOMETHING OF DEEP INTEREST TO 
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER 

05:38:04.509 --> 05:38:07.550
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES FOR THAT 
MATTER. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIT

05:38:07.706 --> 05:38:14.686
OF AN IRONY THAT, YOU KNOW, THE 
LAST ELECTION CYCLE, 2016 WAS 

05:38:15.046 --> 05:38:17.106
DOMINATED ABOUT WHETHER HILLARY 
CLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE 

05:38:17.256 --> 05:38:21.125
WAS USING THIS PRIVATE EMAIL 
SERVER AND THERE FOR HAVING 

05:38:21.706 --> 05:38:24.086
INSECURE COMMUNICATIONS OPEN TO 
SPYING BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS 

05:38:24.547 --> 05:38:28.626
AND THAT STORY HAS SORT OF UNDER
GIRDED THE ENTIRE IMPEACHMENT 

05:38:29.206 --> 05:38:31.385
PROCESS HERE. BUT HAS GOTTEN 
LESS ATTENTION. 

05:38:31.386 --> 05:38:36.296
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S FASCINATING. THIS 
QUESTION OF THE PHONE  CALLS, 

05:38:36.946 --> 05:38:39.776
PHONE RECORDS, IT WAS A SURPRISE
THING THAT CAME OUT. DO WE KNOW 

05:38:40.696 --> 05:38:47.045
MUCH AT THIS POINT? IS THERE ANY
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WHO? 

05:38:47.186 --> 05:38:50.486
THE WHAT? THE WHY? YOU MADE VERY
IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS ABOUT 

05:38:51.100 --> 05:38:54.126
TIMING. WHICH REPORTERS HAVE 
BEEN DIGGING INTO. AND I'D LIKE 

05:38:54.276 --> 05:38:58.287
TO HEAR FROM YOU, DO WE HAVE A 
SENSE THAT HOUSE INVESTIGATORS 

05:38:58.746 --> 05:39:04.156
ARE PUSHING ON THAT TO FIND OUT 
MORE. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE 

05:39:04.306 --> 05:39:08.217
SHOULD TALK ABOUT. REPUBLICANS 
ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WHO GOT 

05:39:08.366 --> 05:39:11.676
THE PHONE CALLS BUT IS THERE 
STILL A WINDOW OPEN FOR 

05:39:11.826 --> 05:39:15.466
DEMOCRATS TO DO INVESTIGATION 
INTO WHY RUDY GIULIANI WOULD BE 

05:39:15.667 --> 05:39:23.256
MAKING THESE CALLS, WHO WAS HE 
CALLING, THERE WERE CALLS TO 

05:39:23.516 --> 05:39:27.256
NEGATIVE ONE MINUS ONE, IS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT? THEY HAVE THE 

05:39:27.807 --> 05:39:30.837
TUNE TO FLUSH THIS OUT MORE, BUT
THE WINDOW IS CLOSING IN TERMS 

05:39:31.196 --> 05:39:34.557
OF THE HOUSEWORK OF THIS PHASE. 
&gt;&gt; CONGRESS COULD START UP ANY 

05:39:34.706 --> 05:39:37.596
INVESTIGATION IT WANTS TO. AND I
THINK THERE ARE VALID THINGS 

05:39:38.816 --> 05:39:42.917
HERE TO INVESTIGATE. THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO, POLITICALLY. ONE, I 

05:39:43.066 --> 05:39:45.896
MEAN RUDY GIULIANI IS A PUBLIC 
FIGURE BUT YOU HAVE THIS CLICK 

05:39:46.047 --> 05:39:51.137
OF CONGRESS INVESTIGATING A 
PRIVATE CITIZEN, THAT WOULD BE 

05:39:51.295 --> 05:39:53.285
ICKY. DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT 
TOGETHER THE EVIDENCE, ALL THE 

05:39:53.286 --> 05:39:56.707
EVIDENCE THEY THINK THEY CAN TO 
IMPEACH TRUMP AND THEY'RE MOVING

05:39:56.926 --> 05:39:59.176
FORWARD. THEY WISH THEY HAD 
MORE. THEY COULDN'T GET MORE. 

05:39:59.326 --> 05:40:03.997
THESE CALLS WERE TANTALIZING 
TRAILS BUT THEY HAVEN'T PURSUED 

05:40:04.146 --> 05:40:06.986
IT. THEY'RE JUST RUNNING OUT OF 
TIME. AND THEN THREE, I THINK  

05:40:07.666 --> 05:40:11.007
DEMOCRATS ARE VERY CAUTIOUS OF 
THIS POLITICAL ARGUMENT 

05:40:11.167 --> 05:40:14.988
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING. THEY'RE 
SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR 

05:40:15.137 --> 05:40:17.531
LUNGS THE DEMOCRATS ARE JUST 
ATTACKING TRUMP BECAUSE THEY 

05:40:17.686 --> 05:40:20.876
DON'T LIKE HIM. AND THEY'RE 
AFRAID THEY CAN'T BEAT HIM IN 

05:40:21.086 --> 05:40:24.877
NOVEMBER. NANCY PELOSI HAS HER 
OWN MAJORITY TO WORRY ABOUT. 

05:40:25.028 --> 05:40:29.106
IT'S NOT LIKE ON A RAZOR'S EDGE 
IN NOVEMBER. BUT SHE CAN MAKE 

05:40:29.556 --> 05:40:33.007
MASSIVE POLITICAL MISTAKES. I 
THINK MOVING FORWARD ON 

05:40:33.147 --> 05:40:35.607
INVESTIGATING RUDY GIULIANI 
WOULD -- COULD MERIT BEING 

05:40:35.757 --> 05:40:38.795
DESCRIBED AS A MASSIVE POLITICAL
MISTAKE. 

05:40:38.796 --> 05:40:42.697
&gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE DISTRICT OF

05:40:43.107 --> 05:40:46.836
NEW YORK IS DOING IT. ADAM 
SCHIFF SAID THEY'RE GOING TO 

05:40:47.027 --> 05:40:50.735
CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO THE PHONE 
CALLS THEY OUTLINED IN THE 

05:40:50.957 --> 05:40:53.457
REPORT. IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER 
THAT'S GOING TO GO ANY WHERE. 

05:40:53.607 --> 05:40:56.256
&gt;&gt; ADAM SCHIFF WAS ASKED ABOUT A
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER IN THOSE 

05:40:57.217 --> 05:41:01.265
PHONE CALLS. ADAM SCHIFF'S 
COLLEAGUE ON THE INTELLIGENCE 

05:41:01.416 --> 05:41:04.197
COMMITTEE. HE SAID WE'LL REFER 
TO THE ETHICS COMMITTEE, THEY'RE

05:41:05.117 --> 05:41:10.477
NOT GOING TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD 
OF WHAT NUNEZ KNEW ABOUT UKRAINE

05:41:10.957 --> 05:41:13.127
AND GIULIANI AND WHEN. 
&gt;&gt; REPUBLICANS WERE CRITICAL AS 

05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:16.666
THE PHONE CALLS CAME UP AND 
WONDERING WHO WAS SEEKING THEM. 

05:41:16.817 --> 05:41:22.850
WAS IT ADAM SCHIFF? WAS IT AS 
ATTORNEY FOR THE COMMITTEE? THEY

05:41:22.997 --> 05:41:25.947
WERE TRYING TO PULL AT THREAD 
THIS IS WEEK ASKING COUNCIL FOR 

05:41:26.527 --> 05:41:29.186
THE DEMOCRATS, WHO INITIATED 
THIS? WHO GOT THESE PHONE 

05:41:29.647 --> 05:41:33.027
RECORDS, AND THEY DIDN'T ANSWER.
THEY SAID THAT'S PART OF A 

05:41:33.327 --> 05:41:35.807
BEHIND THE SCENES INVESTIGATION,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO  

05:41:36.327 --> 05:41:38.996
THAT. WHY IS THAT RELEVANT TO 
REPUBLICANS. 

05:41:38.997 --> 05:41:43.587
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS SORT OF 
INVESTIGATORY MALPRACTICE BY 

05:41:43.946 --> 05:41:47.306
SCHIFF. HE SHOULDN'T INCLUDE A 
PHONE CALL WITH A MEMBER OF 

05:41:47.987 --> 05:41:51.337
CONGRESS OR A JOURNALIST, THAT 
WAS  DETAILED IN THE REPORT. HE 

05:41:51.647 --> 05:41:55.127
SHOULDN'T INCLUDE A PHONE CALL 
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL 

05:41:55.277 --> 05:41:57.337
ATTORNEY. AND I THINK IT'S 
PRETTY CLEAR FROM THE REPORT, 

05:41:57.571 --> 05:42:01.201
THEY HAVEN'T SAID EXACTLY WHOSE 
RECORDS THEY SUBPOENAED, BUT 

05:42:01.347 --> 05:42:07.237
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF 
THE REPORT, IT SEEMS CLEAR THEY 

05:42:07.387 --> 05:42:11.339
SUBPOENAED RUDY GIULIANI'S 
RECORDS AND HIS ASSOCIATES. WHEN

05:42:11.487 --> 05:42:15.056
THEY WERE CALLING DEVEN NUNEZ OR
A JOURNALIST FROM THE HILL, 

05:42:15.637 --> 05:42:20.067
THOSE RECORDS WOULD THEN SHOW UP
ON THEIR -- I THINK IT ALL CAME 

05:42:20.917 --> 05:42:25.306
FROM AT&amp;T. ON THEIR PHONE CALL 
LOG. SO THE REPUBLICANS, AS YOU 

05:42:25.547 --> 05:42:29.806
SAY, HAVE RAISED ALLEGATIONS 
THAT THIS WAS WRONG, THAT DEVEN 

05:42:30.147 --> 05:42:34.027
NUNEZ OR THE JOURNALIST'S NAME 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOTTED OUT OR 

05:42:34.787 --> 05:42:39.507
NOT INCLUDED AT ALL. I THINK THE
DEFENSE OF THAT ON THE HOUSE 

05:42:39.867 --> 05:42:42.107
INTELLIGENCE SIDE ON THE 
DEMOCRAT'S SIDE HAS ESSENTIALLY 

05:42:42.327 --> 05:42:46.476
BEEN THAT WE NEEDED TO IN OUR 
REPORT DEMONSTRATE A PATTERN OF 

05:42:46.697 --> 05:42:50.017
BEHAVIOR. AND THEY'RE 
ESSENTIALLY ACCUSING JOHN 

05:42:50.397 --> 05:42:54.767
SOLOMON AND DEVEN NUNEZ OF 
INVOLVEMENT IN WHAT WAS SORT OF 

05:42:55.447 --> 05:42:57.607
GIULIANI'S SPEARHEADED CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST JOE BIDEN. 

05:42:57.608 --> 05:42:59.787
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE DEFENSES 
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING TODAY AND

05:42:59.947 --> 05:43:02.557
THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING IS THAT 
THE DEFENSE MONEY FOR UKRAINE 

05:43:02.698 --> 05:43:07.207
THAT WAS HELD UP WAS ULTIMATELY 
DELIVERED. AND WITHOUT, YOU 

05:43:07.358 --> 05:43:09.358
KNOW, AN INVESTIGATION 
ANNOUNCEMENT COMING FROM 

05:43:09.387 --> 05:43:13.967
UKRAINE, WITHOUT THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT OR A DRAMATIC 

05:43:14.117 --> 05:43:18.327
UNVEILING ON CNN OR ANYTHING 
ELSE THAT THEY'RE INVESTIGATING 

05:43:18.527 --> 05:43:21.437
BARISMA OR THE BIDENS OR 
ANYTHING ELSE. SO DEMOCRAT HAVES

05:43:21.609 --> 05:43:24.027
A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT. 
BECAUSE THE TIMELINE IS  

05:43:24.867 --> 05:43:29.967
QUESTIONABLE. IT'S A BIT POROUS.
HOW ARE YOU VIEWING THAT  

05:43:30.107 --> 05:43:32.067
DEFENSE? 
&gt;&gt; ONCE AGAIN, I THINK IT FITS 

05:43:32.068 --> 05:43:36.287
IN THE PATTERN OF REPUBLICANS 
HAVING THIS BUMPER STICKER 

05:43:36.607 --> 05:43:40.767
DEFENSE THAT JUST LIKE CAN 
RESONATE OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON 

05:43:41.607 --> 05:43:44.928
MORE QUICKLY THAN I THINK 
DEMOCRATS MORE NUANCED ARGUMENTS

05:43:46.228 --> 05:43:49.608
AND REBUTTALLED CAN. I HEAR 
REPUBLICANS SAY UKRAINE GOT 

05:43:50.208 --> 05:43:54.328
THEIR MONEY. UKRAINE GOT THEIR 
MONEY. IT TAKES A COUPLE 

05:43:54.682 --> 05:43:57.768
PARAGRAPHS TO EXPLAIN THE OTHER 
SIDE. WHICH IS AROUND THE TIME 

05:43:57.922 --> 05:44:02.287
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP RELEASED 
THE  AID, WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS

05:44:02.527 --> 05:44:05.067
THIS WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT 
CIRCULATING IN WASHINGTON. THE 

05:44:06.122 --> 05:44:08.588
NEW YORK TIMES HAS REPORTED THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS BRIEFED ON 

05:44:08.737 --> 05:44:12.717
THIS AROUND THAT TIME. THEIR 
NARRATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING 

05:44:13.027 --> 05:44:16.577
HE GOT CAUGHT OR HE  FEARED HE 
WAS GOING TO GET CAUGHT SO HE 

05:44:16.837 --> 05:44:21.428
RELEASED THE AID. I HEARD AN 
ARGUMENT FROM JIM JORDAN SAYING 

05:44:21.788 --> 05:44:25.838
ON THE DAY TRUMP RELEASED AID 
THERE WERE TWO  ANTI-CORRUPTION 

05:44:25.988 --> 05:44:29.558
LAWS THAT WERE GOING TO BE 
SIGNED INTO LAW IN UKRAINE. 

05:44:29.718 --> 05:44:31.887
WHICH IS INTERESTING. 
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THE 

05:44:32.108 --> 05:44:35.528
DEMOCRATS HAVE PERHAPS NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO GET ACROSS HERE, AS 

05:44:35.868 --> 05:44:39.428
CLEARLY AS THEY PERHAPS WANTED 
IS THAT THE QUID PRO QUO IS FOR 

05:44:39.578 --> 05:44:43.858
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING, RIGHT, 
THE INITIAL QUID PRO QUO IS THAT

05:44:44.562 --> 05:44:47.768
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION ARE WITHHOLDING A

05:44:48.488 --> 05:44:54.868
PROMISED OVAL OFFICE MEETING FOR
ZELENSKY UNTIL HE PUBLICLY 

05:44:55.088 --> 05:44:58.202
ANNOUNCES THESE INVESTIGATIONS 
THAT WILL HELP TRUMP POLITICALLY

05:44:59.468 --> 05:45:04.277
IN THE 2020 ELECTION. INTO JOE 
BIDEN AS WELL AS WHAT HAPPENED 

05:45:04.731 --> 05:45:07.268
IN 2016. AS YOU LOOK AT THE 
TIMELINE, THE INITIAL QUID PRO 

05:45:07.408 --> 05:45:10.147
QUO IS YOU WON'T GET A HIGH 
PROFILE MEETING WITH THE WHITE 

05:45:10.297 --> 05:45:13.568
HOUSE, WHICH IS IMPORTANT. YOU 
WANT TO SHOW RUSSIA THAT THE 

05:45:14.044 --> 05:45:17.268
U.S. IS BEHIND UKRAINE, EVEN 
THOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 

05:45:17.468 --> 05:45:19.788
CHANGED. UNTIL YOU MAKE THIS 
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. IT'S CLEAR 

05:45:19.947 --> 05:45:23.308
IN THE REPORT. IT'S CLEAR FROM 
THE TESTIMONY. IT'S CLEAR FROM 

05:45:23.448 --> 05:45:26.912
THE TEXT  MESSAGES RELEASED THAT
THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS EXCHANGE 

05:45:27.057 --> 05:45:30.717
FOR THAT MEETING IN EXCHANGE FOR
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THEN WHAT 

05:45:30.938 --> 05:45:33.888
HAPPENS IS AS THEY GO BACK AND 
FORTH ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND

05:45:34.037 --> 05:45:37.087
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO BE 
MADE. THE UKRAINIANS LEARN THAT 

05:45:37.239 --> 05:45:40.298
ACTUALLY THE MILITARY IS NOT 
COMING EITHER. AND IT'S 

05:45:40.656 --> 05:45:48.097
COMMUNICATED TO THEM THROUGH THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE EU, 

05:45:48.248 --> 05:45:50.248
GORDON 

05:45:53.108 --> 05:45:55.108
SOME LIND.
THE INITIAL QUID PRO QUO IS FOR 

05:45:55.338 --> 05:45:58.108
THE MEETING AND THE ARGUMENT IS 
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THE AID WAS 

05:45:58.308 --> 05:46:03.437
SORT OF A PILE ON. IT WAS SORT 
OF AN ADDED MEASURE OF PRESSURE.

05:46:03.587 --> 05:46:07.798
AND WHAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 
TRIED TO SAY IS WELL BECAUSE THE

05:46:08.032 --> 05:46:11.073
UKRAINIANS, SOME UKRAINIANS 
CERTAINLY BUT NOT ALL, DIDN'T 

05:46:11.217 --> 05:46:15.028
KNOW ABOUT THE AID BEING HELD UP
IN JULY, IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A

05:46:15.187 --> 05:46:19.217
QUID PRO QUO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
KNOW IT. THE UKRAINIANS KNEW 

05:46:19.358 --> 05:46:21.533
FULL WELL THEY NEEDED THE 
MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND 

05:46:21.798 --> 05:46:27.697
THEY KNEW FULL WELL THEY WEREN'T
GETTING IT UNTIL ZELENSKY MADE 

05:46:27.858 --> 05:46:29.068
THIS COMMITMENT ON THE 
INVESTIGATION. 

05:46:29.069 --> 05:46:34.737
&gt;&gt; IN THE VERY FIRST PHONE CALL 
BETWEEN ZELENSKY AND THE WHITE 

05:46:35.228 --> 05:46:37.206
HOUSE. IT'S CLEAR THE WHITE 
HOUSE WANTS TIME WITH THE 

05:46:37.207 --> 05:46:39.667
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE THAT CAN GET
CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT. BUT DO 

05:46:39.823 --> 05:46:42.308
YOU THINK THAT IT'S BEEN MADE TO
THE CLEAR PUBLIC OF WHY THAT 

05:46:42.527 --> 05:46:45.788
MEETING IS SO PRECIOUS AND SO 
IMPORTANT TO THE NEW LEADER OF 

05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:49.344
UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

05:46:49.557 --> 05:46:52.948
STRUGGLED A LITTLE BIT IN 
CLARIFYING THAT. INITIALLY THE 

05:46:53.308 --> 05:46:56.717
NARRATIVE WAS THE QUID PRO QUO 
WAS FOR THE AID. BUT IT BECAME 

05:46:56.877 --> 05:46:59.298
CLEAR OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
INVESTIGATION THAT THE FIRST 

05:46:59.457 --> 05:47:02.857
QUID PRO QUO WAS REALLY FOR THAT
MEETING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 

05:47:03.288 --> 05:47:05.288
THAT MEETING FOR THE UKRAINIANS 
CAN'T BE 

05:47:09.958 --> 05:47:11.958
OVER STATED. RIGHT.

05:47:13.257 --> 05:47:17.387
THE FIRST NEW GOVERNMENT IN 
UKRAINE WHICH WAS THE FIRST 

05:47:18.781 --> 05:47:20.337
UPRISING. THEY ARE AT WILLIAM 
BARR WITH RUSSIA BACKED PROXIES 

05:47:20.338 --> 05:47:23.807
IN THE EAST. THEY'RE TRYING TO 
NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT IN THAT 

05:47:24.068 --> 05:47:27.378
WAR. THEY RECEIVE MILITARY AID 
WITH THE UNITED STATES. 

05:47:27.523 --> 05:47:29.337
NEGOTIATING WITH RUSSIA WITHOUT 
SHOWING THE KREMLIN THAT THE 

05:47:29.338 --> 05:47:32.773
U.S. IS STILL BACKING US EVEN 
THOUGH WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNMENT 

05:47:32.918 --> 05:47:36.717
IS A PERILOUS POSITION NOR THEM.
THE WAY TO SHOW THE U.S. STILL 

05:47:37.078 --> 05:47:39.788
BACKS UKRAINE IS WITH A BIG 
HANDSHAKE WHITE HOUSE MEETING 

05:47:40.588 --> 05:47:44.587
AND ENDORSING WHAT DONALD TRUMP 
IS SAYING. 

05:47:44.588 --> 05:47:46.658
&gt;&gt; IT STILL 

05:47:51.678 --> 05:47:54.918
HASN'T HAPPENED TRUMP AND 
ZELENSKY MET ON THE SIDELINES OF

05:47:55.137 --> 05:47:59.917
THE U.N. IN A PREVIOUSLY PLAN 
MEETING AND ZELENSKY MADE A 

05:48:00.072 --> 05:48:03.122
JOKE. IT WASN'T A JOKE. WHERE'S 
THE MEETING? ARE YOU GOING TO 

05:48:03.958 --> 05:48:06.088
INVITE ME? HE STILL HASN'T 
GOTTEN THAT. AND PAUL MAKES A 

05:48:06.527 --> 05:48:09.527
GOOD POINT. THE MEETING GETS 
LOST IN DEMOCRATS TALKING ABOUT 

05:48:10.027 --> 05:48:14.748
THE AID. THEY JUST FEEL LIKE 
THAT'S THE MORE EGREGIOUS THING 

05:48:15.047 --> 05:48:18.107
TO HOLD UP. BUT THEY STILL 
HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT. THEY COULD 

05:48:19.127 --> 05:48:23.016
ERASE REPUBLICANS TALKING POINT 
OF UKRAINE GOT THEIR MONEY BY 

05:48:23.381 --> 05:48:26.598
PERHAPS UPPING AND EXPLAINING 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OVAL 

05:48:27.028 --> 05:48:29.798
OFFICE MEETING TO UKRAINE .  BUT
THAT TAKES A LOT OF DETAILS AS 

05:48:30.487 --> 05:48:33.178
PAUL OUTLINES ELOQUENTLY. LIKE 
RUSSIAN 

05:48:37.438 --> 05:48:39.438
BACKED SEPARATISTS. THE 2014 NEW
GOVERNMENT. AND IT'S HARD FOR 

05:48:39.657 --> 05:48:42.588
DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW. 
&gt;&gt; IF SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT 

05:48:42.806 --> 05:48:47.997
HAPPENED THIS WEEK, ZELENSKY MET
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. AND THERE 

05:48:48.898 --> 05:48:54.228
WAS CONCERN THAT ZELENSKY WAS 
GOING INTO THIS MEETING 

05:48:54.402 --> 05:48:57.758
COMPROMISED OR NOT IN THE 
STRONGEST POSITION. WE TALKED TO

05:48:58.227 --> 05:49:01.208
ROBIN DICKSON WHO SAID THIS WAS 
A REAL CONCERN OF THE UKRAINIANS

05:49:01.928 --> 05:49:05.410
THAT ZELENSKY HAS BEEN DINGED BY
THIS PROCESS. 

05:49:05.411 --> 05:49:07.116
&gt;&gt; YEAH. I THINK THERE ARE 
SERIOUS CONCERNS IN UKRAINE 

05:49:07.117 --> 05:49:11.127
RIGHT NOW THAT THEY DO NOT 
ACTUALLY ENJOY DESPITE WHAT IS 

05:49:11.848 --> 05:49:15.247
ON PAPER, WHAT'S PASSED THROUGH 
CONGRESS, BIPARTISAN BACKING 

05:49:15.397 --> 05:49:20.237
FROM  CONGRESS. SUPPORT FROM THE
PENTAGON. SUPPORT FROM THE STATE

05:49:20.667 --> 05:49:22.667
DEPARTMENT. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T
LIKE UKRAINE AND DOESN'T SUPPORT

05:49:22.777 --> 05:49:26.658
THEM. NOW THERE ARE ACCUSATIONS 
ABOUT UKRAINE MEDALING IN THE  

05:49:27.258 --> 05:49:29.258
ELECTION. WHICH HAS NOT BEEN 
PROVEN. CORRUPTION AND UKRAINE 

05:49:29.377 --> 05:49:36.497
ARE TWO WORDS COMING TOGETHER 
ALL THE TIME THESE DAYS. 

05:49:36.498 --> 05:49:39.628
&gt;&gt; THEY NO LONGER ENJOY THE KIND
OF STEADFAST U.S. BACKING 

05:49:40.128 --> 05:49:46.808
THEY'VE ENJOYED AND AS WE SAW 
FROM THIS SUMMIT WITH PUTIN AND 

05:49:46.997 --> 05:49:49.507
ZELENSKY, NOTHING REALLY CAME OF
IT. WE'RE STILL SORT OF AT A 

05:49:50.079 --> 05:49:52.302
STAND STILL. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

05:49:52.496 --> 05:49:54.962
US. I WANT TO PLAY SOME TAPE, 
AMBER, FROM LAST NIGHT T 

05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:59.888
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MADE THIS 
UNUSUAL MOVE OF HAVING SOME OF 

05:50:00.027 --> 05:50:02.847
THE ACTION HAPPEN IN PRIME TIME 
LAST NIGHT. LET'S LISTEN TO 

05:50:03.317 --> 05:50:05.918
THESE OPENING SPEECHES. THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS ON BOTH 

05:50:06.078 --> 05:50:10.108
SIDES OF THE AISLE TO MAKE THEIR
CASE FOR OR AGAINST THE ARTICLES

05:50:10.658 --> 05:50:12.867
OF IMPEACHMENT. 
&gt;&gt; TODAY WE MEET TO BEGIN 

05:50:13.027 --> 05:50:17.977
CONSIDERATION OF ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT 

05:50:18.348 --> 05:50:22.578
DONALD J TRUMP. OTHER PRESIDENTS
HAVE RESISTED CONGRESSIONAL OVER

05:50:22.717 --> 05:50:26.547
SIGHT. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
STONE WALL WAS COMPLETE, 

05:50:27.007 --> 05:50:30.754
ABSOLUTE AND WITHOUT PRECEDENT 
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 

05:50:30.755 --> 05:50:34.027
&gt;&gt; WHEN THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR 
ARGUMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT 

05:50:34.277 --> 05:50:40.618
PRESSURED PLAZA HEN SKI, THEY 
THEN ATTACK MR. ZELENSKY THE 

05:50:40.838 --> 05:50:44.728
MAJORITY IS SAYING MR. ZELENSKY 
IS A LIAR AND WE'RE TEARING DOWN

05:50:44.878 --> 05:50:48.088
A WORLD LEADER IN THE EYES OF 
THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE HIM IN HIS 

05:50:48.348 --> 05:50:52.348
OWN COUNTRY AND RUSSIA WHO IS 
ATTACKING HIM. WHEN WE CAN'T 

05:50:52.567 --> 05:50:56.958
MAKE OUR CASE WE NOT ONLY TRY TO
TEAR DOWN THE LEADER OF THE FREE

05:50:57.108 --> 05:50:59.698
WORLD, PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE'RE 
TEARING DOWN THE NEWLY ELECTED 

05:50:59.857 --> 05:51:03.688
LEADER OF THE UKRAINE. AFTER ALL
THESE HEARINGS AND GRAND 

05:51:03.837 --> 05:51:06.287
PRONOUNCEMENTS AND TALKS OF 
CRIME IN PLAIN SIGHT WE GET 

05:51:06.547 --> 05:51:10.838
ABUSE OF POWER? WITH NO REAL 
DATES ON THIS IS THE ABUSE. IT'S

05:51:11.947 --> 05:51:15.077
JUST GENERIC, VAGUE STATEMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; UNDERSTANDABLE THAT 

05:51:15.318 --> 05:51:17.947
REPUBLICANS FEEL LOYALTY TO THE 
LEADER OF THEIR PARTY. BUT 

05:51:18.397 --> 05:51:21.697
LOYALTY TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR 
CONSTITUTION MUST BE  GREATER. 

05:51:21.847 --> 05:51:25.417
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE'RE DEBATING HERE IN 
MY OPINION IS THE WEAKEST CASE 

05:51:27.517 --> 05:51:30.117
IN HISTORY. AND YET THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED TO GO 

05:51:30.699 --> 05:51:34.298
FULL SPEED AHEAD, AGAIN, BECAUSE
OF THE CLOCK AND THE CALENDAR, 

05:51:34.658 --> 05:51:39.538
WITH AN INCOMPLETE RECORD, 
SIMPLY BY USING HEARSAY 

05:51:39.757 --> 05:51:44.078
EVIDENCE, AND TRASHING THE RULES
OF THE HOUSE EVERY TIME THEY CAN

05:51:44.418 --> 05:51:51.338
IN ORDER TO SPEED THINGS UP WITH
A PREORDAINED CONCLUSION AND 

05:51:51.484 --> 05:51:54.306
THAT'S A PARTISAN VOTE FOR 
IMPEACHMENT. 

05:51:54.307 --> 05:51:57.668
&gt;&gt; TOMORROW THIS COMMITTEE WILL 
HOLD A VOTE TO IMPEACH A 

05:51:57.817 --> 05:51:59.817
PRESIDENT WITHOUT HAVING HEARD 
FROM A SINGLE WITNESS AND 

05:52:00.207 --> 05:52:02.698
WITHOUT ALLOWING THE MINORITY 
PARTY THE ABILITY TO CALL 

05:52:03.397 --> 05:52:06.607
WITNESSES OR PRESENT ANY  
DEFENSE, WHAT A TRAVESTY OF 

05:52:06.757 --> 05:52:08.848
JUSTICE. 
&gt;&gt; THE HOUSE IS A SEPARATE AND 

05:52:09.091 --> 05:52:12.990
COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WE
DON'T WORK FOR THIS PRESIDENT OR

05:52:14.897 --> 05:52:17.637
ANY PRESIDENT. WE WORK FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. FORTUNATELY, WE

05:52:17.787 --> 05:52:20.837
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT AS DUMB AS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINKS WE ARE. 

05:52:20.982 --> 05:52:25.668
IF YOU BREAK THE LAW, AND 
WITHHOLD DOCK YOU WANTS, WE KNOW

05:52:26.702 --> 05:52:32.317
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THOSE DOCUMENTS
MAYBE YOU LOOK GOOD. 

05:52:32.318 --> 05:52:35.308
&gt;&gt; IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT 
ABUSED HIS POWER. IF EVERYTHING 

05:52:35.466 --> 05:52:38.388
HE DID WAS 

05:52:43.397 --> 05:52:45.397
TRULY PERFECT

05:52:47.098 --> 05:52:50.297
, HE WOULD HAVE DEMANDED THAT 
EVERYONE THAT WORKS FOR HIM COME

05:52:50.447 --> 05:52:54.178
FORWARD AND TELL THE TRUTH. BUT 
INSTEAD OF ORDERING HIS STAFF TO

05:52:54.378 --> 05:52:56.516
TELL THE TRUTH, HE SILENCED 
THEM. 

05:52:56.517 --> 05:52:58.988
&gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT WHAT CHAIRMAN 
SCHIFF DID LAST WEEK. HE 

05:52:59.138 --> 05:53:01.908
RELEASED THE PHONE RECORDS OF 
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER.

05:53:02.058 --> 05:53:06.188
THE PHONE RECORDS OF A MEMBER OF
THE PRESS AND THE PEN RECORD OF 

05:53:06.447 --> 05:53:10.718
A REPUBLICAN -- AND THE PHONE 
RECORDS OF A REPUBLICAN MEMBER 

05:53:11.067 --> 05:53:13.729
OF CONGRESS. THIS IS SCARY 
STUFF. IT'S DANGEROUS FOR OUR 

05:53:13.958 --> 05:53:16.787
COUNTRY. IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR 
OUR  COUNTRY. AND WE SHOULD 

05:53:16.947 --> 05:53:20.556
REMEMBER WHAT EMMET FOOD TOLD 
US, THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER, WHAT

05:53:20.697 --> 05:53:23.698
HE TOLD US WHEN THE MULLER 
REPORT CAME OUT. IT WOULD BE 

05:53:24.158 --> 05:53:26.978
WELL TO REMEMBER THAT WHAT CAN 
BE DONE TO A PRESIDENT CAN BE 

05:53:27.258 --> 05:53:32.207
DONE TO ANY OF US. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE MARKING UP ARTICLES OF

05:53:32.427 --> 05:53:34.778
IMPEACHMENT FOR OFFENSES THAT 
AREN'T CRIMES THAT SOME MEMBERS 

05:53:34.928 --> 05:53:39.101
OF CONGRESS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF 
BEFORE. MUCH LESS KNOW WHAT IT 

05:53:39.537 --> 05:53:40.787
MEANS. 
&gt;&gt; HOUSE DEMOCRATS AREN'T 

05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:43.478
CLARIFYING THAT NO ONE'S ABOVE 
THE LAW. THEY'RE JUST CLARIFYING

05:53:43.647 --> 05:53:47.548
THAT NONE OF THEM ARE ABOVE 
PARTISAN SHIP AND POLITICS. THIS

05:53:47.697 --> 05:53:50.427
IS THE QUICKEST, THINNEST, 
WEAKEST, MOST PARTISAN 

05:53:50.638 --> 05:53:53.638
IMPEACHMENT IN ALL OF AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY. AND FOR 

05:53:53.785 --> 05:54:02.897
ALL THE RADICAL LEFT ATTACKS ON 
THE PRESIDENT'S HONESTY THERE 

05:54:03.048 --> 05:54:09.747
LIES  LIE THEY CONTINUE TO FUEL 
THE IMPEACHMENT. 

05:54:09.748 --> 05:54:15.458
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE SAW THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE GAVEL IN AT 7:00 LAST 

05:54:16.018 --> 05:54:18.837
NIGHT. WHICH IS UNUSUAL TO GET 
ROLLING THE ARTICLES OF 

05:54:19.097 --> 05:54:21.399
IMPEACHMENT. THAT'S NIGHT WAS A 
CHANCE FOR EVERY MEMBER TO MAKE 

05:54:21.577 --> 05:54:27.777
THEIR OWN OPENING STATEMENT. 
AMBER  PHILLIPS WITH THE FIX. 

05:54:27.927 --> 05:54:30.558
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, I'D 
LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S STANDING OUT

05:54:30.778 --> 05:54:35.098
TO YOU TODAY SO FAR, I'D HATE TO
REDUCE THIS TO WINNERS AND  

05:54:35.758 --> 05:54:39.107
LOSERS, I THINK IT DOES A 
DISSERVICE, BUT DO YOU GET THE 

05:54:39.257 --> 05:54:41.608
SENSE OF DEMOCRATS OR  
REPUBLICANS FEELING GOOD ABOUT 

05:54:41.748 --> 05:54:44.577
HOW THEY'RE HANDLING THE PROCESS
AT THIS POINT. 

05:54:44.578 --> 05:54:48.978
&gt;&gt; I SEE A UNITED FRONT FROM 
REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE. 

05:54:49.123 --> 05:54:54.017
THEY'VE UNITED AGAINST THIS IDEA
THAT THE DEMOCRAT HAVES A 

05:54:54.818 --> 05:54:57.228
PRETERMED OUTCOME THAT THEY'RE 
TRYING TO MAKE THE EVIDENCE FIT 

05:54:58.857 --> 05:55:03.118
THAT OUTCOME AND THEY'VE PRETTY 
RESOLUTELY STOOD BEHIND THE 

05:55:03.267 --> 05:55:07.798
PRESIDENT IN A WAY I WASN'T SURE
THEY WOULD. I THINK AMBER HAS 

05:55:07.948 --> 05:55:10.258
WRITTEN ABOUT THIS TOO. THERE'S 
SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IDEA

05:55:11.158 --> 05:55:13.958
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOTHING 
WRONG AND THE IDEA THAT HE -- 

05:55:14.107 --> 05:55:16.578
WELL, MAYBE THE CALL WASN'T 
PERFECT AND MAYBE IT'S NOT A 

05:55:16.737 --> 05:55:20.438
GREAT IDEA TO ASK A FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE YOUR 

05:55:20.798 --> 05:55:25.818
POLITICAL OPPONENTS BUT IT'S NOT
IMPEACHABLE. AND WE THOUGHT 

05:55:25.968 --> 05:55:30.298
MAYBE THEY'D GO TOWARD THE NOT 
IMPEACHABLE ARM. BUT THEY'RE 

05:55:30.518 --> 05:55:33.707
GOING TOWARD THE THERE'S NOTHING
AT ALL WRONG HERE. WE'RE SEEING 

05:55:33.858 --> 05:55:37.796
THAT UNITED ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE 

05:55:38.058 --> 05:55:40.058
COMMITTEE. DEMOCRATS ON THE 
OTHER HAND ARE TRYING TO RECON 

05:55:40.118 --> 05:55:44.537
WITH THE  ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT THEY'VE CHOSEN 

05:55:45.147 --> 05:55:47.778
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING A POINT 
OF ARGUING THOSE ARTICLES DON'T 

05:55:47.927 --> 05:55:50.518
INCLUDE A STATUTORY CRIME WHICH 
I THINK IS SOMETHING DEMOCRATS 

05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:53.648
HAVE TO DEAL WITH NOW BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T. ABUSE OF POWER IS 

05:55:53.898 --> 05:55:57.738
KIND OF A NEBULOUS CONCEPT. 
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS IS NOT 

05:55:57.897 --> 05:56:01.086
SOMETHING YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED 
FOR IN A COURT OF LAW. SO WE'VE 

05:56:01.237 --> 05:56:03.628
SEEN SOME DEMOCRATS COME FORWARD
AND SAY WELL, THIS ACTUALLY WAS 

05:56:03.788 --> 05:56:12.767
BRIBE  BRIBERY. WE'VE SEEN 
OTHERS SAY THIS IS NOT ABOUT 

05:56:12.918 --> 05:56:16.667
STATUTORY CRIMES BUT CRIMES 
AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION. WHAT 

05:56:16.808 --> 05:56:18.987
DOES THAT MEAN TO YOUR AVERAGE 
PERSON WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND 

05:56:20.327 --> 05:56:23.448
THE PROCESS. THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
NEED TO BE FOCUSED. THEY NEED TO

05:56:26.398 --> 05:56:29.247
MAKE A CONCISE CASE TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

05:56:29.248 --> 05:56:33.218
&gt;&gt; WHEN IS IT IMPORTANT TO ASK 
WHEN THERE ARE WINNERS AND  

05:56:33.478 --> 05:56:35.698
LOSERS IN THIS PROCESS? 
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE GOING TO BE WINNERS

05:56:36.372 --> 05:56:39.007
AND LOSERS, THE PRESIDENT WON'T 
BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE, BUT THIS

05:56:39.227 --> 05:56:43.758
ALL PLAY INTO THE 2020 ELECTION,
CERTAINLY, AND IF THIS EVEN  

05:56:43.998 --> 05:56:49.887
MOVES THE NEEDLE A LITTLE BIT 
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT CAN BE A

05:56:51.397 --> 05:56:53.428
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. IF THIS 
MAKES YOUR AVERAGE SWING VOTER 

05:56:53.638 --> 05:56:56.818
THAT MUCH MORE UNLIKELY TO 
SUPPORT HIM, THAT CAN HAVE A 

05:56:57.837 --> 05:57:01.458
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. IF IT 
MOTIVATES THE PRESIDENT'S 

05:57:01.808 --> 05:57:04.948
SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY FEEL 
HE'S BEING PERSECUTED THROUGH 

05:57:05.458 --> 05:57:08.638
THIN CHARGES AND NOT BEING 
ACCUSED OF A CRIME, THAT CAN BE 

05:57:09.118 --> 05:57:13.938
SIGNIFICANT AS WELL. PRACTICALLY
SPEAKING, AS FAR AS REMOVAL FROM

05:57:14.088 --> 05:57:16.858
OFFICE, A LOT OF THIS ISN'T 
GOING TO MATTER, AS FAR AS CASES

05:57:17.428 --> 05:57:20.518
BEING MADE, AS FAR AS THE STAGE 
CRAFT HERE, ALL OF THIS WILL 

05:57:20.708 --> 05:57:23.117
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE 2020 
ELECTION. 

05:57:23.118 --> 05:57:25.748
&gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO HEAR
DEMOCRATS MAKE THEIR CASE. SOME 

05:57:25.888 --> 05:57:28.458
HAVE JUST BEEN SORT OF LIKE 
ALMOST LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

05:57:29.277 --> 05:57:32.147
IS HAPPENING. OF COURSE THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DONE SOMETHING 

05:57:33.198 --> 05:57:35.898
WRONG. AND SOME HAVE SAID, YOU 
KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON 

05:57:36.138 --> 05:57:40.268
THESE TWO SPECIFIC ARTICLES. BUT
THEN YOU'VE ALSO HAD DEMOCRATS 

05:57:40.528 --> 05:57:43.196
REFERENCING LIKE PAST BEHAVIOR 
OR OTHER ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE

05:57:43.348 --> 05:57:46.068
PRESIDENT, WHICH REPUBLICANS 
HAVE BEEN QUICK TO JUMP ON. 

05:57:46.218 --> 05:57:48.788
THEY'RE LIKE YOU WANT BOTH  
THINGS, YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO

05:57:49.028 --> 05:57:53.368
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. YET 
YOU'RE REFERENCING OTHER 

05:57:53.568 --> 05:57:56.118
BEHAVIOR BY THE PRESIDENT THAT 
COMES NOWHERE NEAR THESE  

05:57:56.838 --> 05:57:58.838
ARTICLES. 
&gt;&gt; THAT GETS THE DEMOCRAT'S 

05:57:59.067 --> 05:58:02.108
CENTRAL STRUGGLE HERE, THEY 
DON'T LIKE TRUMP. THEY WISH HE 

05:58:03.447 --> 05:58:09.195
DIDN'T WIN. HOW DO THEY CONVINCE
VOTERS TO THEY'RE IMPEACHING HIM

05:58:09.418 --> 05:58:12.787
ON LEGITIMATE ISSUES. BECAUSE 
REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING THIS NOT 

05:58:13.377 --> 05:58:16.067
NUANCED ARM. SHOUTING FROM THE 
ROOFTOPS. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET 

05:58:16.278 --> 05:58:21.978
HIM OUT OF OFFICE. THEY WOULDN'T
WIN IN 2016. IGNORING THE FACT 

05:58:23.358 --> 05:58:26.450
THAT PENCE WOULD BE PRESIDENT IF
TRUMP WERE REMOVED FROM OFFICE. 

05:58:26.598 --> 05:58:29.298
&gt;&gt; THIS IS UNQUESTIONABLY A 
CULMINATION OF EVERYTHING THAT'S

05:58:29.667 --> 05:58:32.548
COME BEFORE IT. EVEN DEMOCRATS 
ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. THEY'RE 

05:58:33.218 --> 05:58:35.927
SAYING WELL, HE'S TRIED TO GET 
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN AN 

05:58:36.297 --> 05:58:38.638
ELECTION BEFORE. IF WE DON'T 
STOP HIM NOW, HE'S GOING TO TRY 

05:58:38.999 --> 05:58:43.127
TO DO IT AGAIN, HE'S DONE IT SO 
MANY TIMES BEFORE, YET THEY'VE 

05:58:43.342 --> 05:58:46.887
DECIDED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 
INCLUDE THOSE PREVIOUS INSTANCES

05:58:47.128 --> 05:58:49.849
IN THESE IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES 
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED THEY'LL 

05:58:50.557 --> 05:58:53.708
BE ACCUSED OF BRINGING UP OLD 
STUFF OR SOME OBSTRUCTION OF 

05:58:53.928 --> 05:58:56.298
JUSTICE STUFF THAT ROBERT MULLER
DIDN'T ACTUALLY ACCUSE THE 

05:58:56.448 --> 05:59:01.228
PRESIDENT OF A CRIME. THEY HAVE 
ELECTED TO GO VERY NARROW WITH 

05:59:02.188 --> 05:59:04.817
THIS. KEEP THIS VERY FOCUSED ON 
THE UKRAINE SITUATION, BUT 

05:59:05.022 --> 05:59:07.188
THAT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS 
AS FAR AS A STRATEGY GOES. 

08:59:46.975 --> 08:59:50.640
A NEWLY ELECTED YOUNG PRESIDENT 
THAT WE ALL WERE EXCITED ABOUT. 

08:59:51.402 --> 08:59:58.969
AND TAKE ANTICORRUPTION 
PRESIDENT. HE WAS TRIED TO 

08:59:59.171 --> 09:00:03.233
COERCE AND INTERFERING IN THE 
2020 ELECTIONS. THE THINGS I 

09:00:03.434 --> 09:00:09.286
HAVE HEARD TODAY. ABOUT VICE 
PRESIDENT CHALL AND THE THINGS 

09:00:09.506 --> 09:00:14.159
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE VICE 
PRESIDENT SON, WE HAVE MILLIONS 

09:00:14.376 --> 09:00:18.686
OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO 
ARE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION. I 

09:00:18.888 --> 09:00:22.784
BELIEVE TO PROTECT THIS 
PRESIDENT AT ANY COST IS 

09:00:22.920 --> 09:00:25.318
SHAMEFUL. ARTICLE 2,

09:00:31.670 --> 09:00:33.514
THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT SAID THIS.
THE ARTICLE PRINCIPALLY ADDRESS 

09:00:33.515 --> 09:00:38.535
PRESIDENT NIXON'S USE OF POWER. 
INCLUDING POWERS VESTED SOLELY 

09:00:38.735 --> 09:00:41.269
IN THE PRESIDENT. TO AID HIS 
POLITICAL ALLIES AND HARM HIS 

09:00:42.021 --> 09:00:44.021
POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN PROPER

09:00:47.715 --> 09:00:49.817
PERSONAL POLITICAL ADVANTAGE. 
AND EXPLAIN IN THIS ARTICLE THAT

09:00:50.018 --> 09:00:52.018
THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
THEN STATED

09:00:57.117 --> 09:00:58.944
THAT PRESIDENT NIXON'S CONDUCT 
WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR HIS PERSONAL 

09:00:58.945 --> 09:01:01.623
POLITICAL ADVANTAGE AND NOT IN 
THE FURTHERANCE OF ANY VALID 

09:01:02.384 --> 09:01:07.013
NATIONAL POLICY. THE PRESIDENT 
ABUSED HIS POWER.

09:01:11.038 --> 09:01:14.355
INTO ME AND AT LEAST THE MEMBERS
ON THIS SIDE OF THE DAIS THAT 

09:01:14.499 --> 09:01:19.508
MATTERS. WITH THAT I YIELD THE 
REMAINING TIME TO MR. RICHMAN 

09:01:20.269 --> 09:01:24.076
FROM LOUISIANA. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. I 

09:01:24.272 --> 09:01:27.175
WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE WHEN THE 
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AND YOU LOOK

09:01:27.395 --> 09:01:29.395
AT THE CREDIBILITY OF A 
TESTIMONY

09:01:34.394 --> 09:01:36.897
, AND WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE YOU 
CAN LOOK AT OTHER THINGS. I WANT

09:01:37.107 --> 09:01:40.085
TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD THE 
GUARDIAN ARTICLE ROGER STONE AND

09:01:40.836 --> 09:01:45.817
MICHAEL COHEN. THE MEN 
IMPLICATED IN CRIMES. CNN 

09:01:46.035 --> 09:01:49.685
POLITICS AND SIX TRUMP 
ASSOCIATES HAVE BEEN CONVICTED 

09:01:50.118 --> 09:01:52.118
IN MUELLER RELATED 
INVESTIGATIONS.

09:01:54.995 --> 09:01:59.812
&gt;&gt; MY GRANDMOTHER SAID BIRDS OF 
A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER. ALSO, 

09:02:00.213 --> 09:02:04.569
RESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE 13,435 
POSTS ON MISLEADING CLAIMS OVER 

09:02:04.704 --> 09:02:09.484
900. 
&gt;&gt; THAT OBJECTION. THE TIME HAS 

09:02:09.625 --> 09:02:11.625
EXPIRED.

09:02:16.778 --> 09:02:22.304
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. THANK 
YOU CHAIRMAN. I WANT TO SPEAK 

09:02:22.523 --> 09:02:27.535
FIRST TO THE UNDERLYING 
AMENDMENTS THAT CALLS FOR THE 

09:02:27.674 --> 09:02:30.873
ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE AIDE WAS
RELEASED

09:02:35.224 --> 09:02:44.034
IN THE ARTICLE, THE FIRST 
ARTICLE I BELIEVE. I WANT TO, 

09:02:44.788 --> 09:02:52.176
AGAIN, RECOUNT NOT ONLY TO JULY 
25 CALL, WHERE PREVIOUSLY I HAVE

09:02:52.324 --> 09:02:58.014
INDICATED THE PRESIDENTS 
LANGUAGE, WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO 

09:02:58.218 --> 09:03:00.624
DO US A FAVOR. THAT WAS NOT TIED

09:03:05.887 --> 09:03:10.014
TO US REPRESENTING THE ENTITY OF
A PUBLIC RIS PRESENTATION.

09:03:14.434 --> 09:03:16.355
WOULD BE THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. ESTABLISH FOREIGN 

09:03:16.356 --> 09:03:21.259
POLICY BY THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE. THAT IS BECAUSE THE 

09:03:21.461 --> 09:03:23.584
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ANNE STATE 
HAD ALREADY CERTIFIED THAT THE 

09:03:23.786 --> 09:03:25.786
UKRAINE WAS WORKING TO GRADUATE

09:03:28.674 --> 09:03:30.674
AND WORKING TO ENSURE

09:03:35.240 --> 09:03:37.354
THE END OF CORRUPTION THAT HAVE 
MET THE STANDARDS THAT WERE 

09:03:37.575 --> 09:03:42.320
REQUIRED FOR FUNDING. THE OTHER 
THING IS WHEN LIEUTENANT COLONEL

09:03:43.084 --> 09:03:49.404
THEN MEN THOUGHT THE WORDS THAT 
HE HEARD WERE APPALLING TO BE 

09:03:49.623 --> 09:03:54.074
INAPPROPRIATE FOR A CALL TO THE 
PRESIDENT AS IT RELATES TO A 

09:03:54.214 --> 09:04:01.094
QUESTION TYING THE MILITARY AID 
TO INVESTIGATION BIDEN AND 

09:04:01.245 --> 09:04:03.245
OTHERS

09:04:07.134 --> 09:04:09.134
, SONS AND OTHERS AND NOT 
OFFICIAL POLICY. HE IMMEDIATELY 

09:04:09.244 --> 09:04:11.374
GIVE IT TO THE NFC COUNSEL JOHN 
EISENBERG. JOHN EISENBERG TOOK 

09:04:12.137 --> 09:04:18.624
THE INFORMATION AND THEN 
ULTIMATELY PUT IT IN A SEPARATE 

09:04:19.604 --> 09:04:25.174
COATED FILING. AND ASKED THAT 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL NOT SAY 

09:04:25.393 --> 09:04:32.663
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THAT IS 
UNUSUAL. YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF

09:04:32.866 --> 09:04:38.400
IT WAS NORMAL BUSINESS AND IT 
HAD TO DO WAS STANDARD U.S. 

09:04:38.613 --> 09:04:44.133
FOREIGN-POLICY IT WOULD BE OKAY 
TO TALK ABOUT THAT CALL. THEY 

09:04:44.343 --> 09:04:46.443
KNEW A MAJOR MISTAKE HAD BEEN 
MADE. THEY KNEW THAT THE 

09:04:46.643 --> 09:04:49.796
PRESIDENT HAD OFFERED TO GIVE 
MILITARY AID IF HE GOT AN 

09:04:49.942 --> 09:04:53.323
INVESTIGATION AGAINST HIS 
POLITICAL RIVAL AND HIS 

09:04:53.966 --> 09:04:55.966
POLITICAL RIVAL HAPPEN TO BE JOE
BIDEN.

09:04:59.313 --> 09:05:03.667
THAT WAS CONSPICUOUSLY USING 
PUBLIC OFFICE IN PUBLIC MONEY 

09:05:03.814 --> 09:05:11.815
FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DESIRES. 
LET ME ALSO SAY OUR FRIENDS TALK

09:05:12.023 --> 09:05:14.144
ABOUT THE COURTS. WE HAVE NOT 
SHIED AWAY FROM THE COURTS. 

09:05:14.895 --> 09:05:16.895
JUDGE HOWELL

09:05:18.112 --> 09:05:20.012
, REGARDING THE GRAND JURY 
MATERIAL SPECIFICALLY SAID THERE

09:05:20.013 --> 09:05:22.867
IS AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY YOU 
CAN'T STAND IN THE WAY MR. 

09:05:23.013 --> 09:05:29.092
PRESIDENT. JUDGE JACKSON 
INDICATED IN HER DECISION THAT 

09:05:29.303 --> 09:05:32.533
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT A KING. WE
ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT

09:05:37.352 --> 09:05:39.895
NOT AS A MOTHER SOMEONE'S CHILD.
WHO MAY HAVE SOME CONCERNS. LIKE

09:05:40.106 --> 09:05:45.303
EVERY AMERICAN'S CHILD MAY HAVE.
WHICH I AM SADDENED THAT THOSE 

09:05:45.523 --> 09:05:49.775
PERSONAL MATTERS WERE RAISED. WE
ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE ABUSE

09:05:49.986 --> 09:05:53.553
OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THE 
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. ANOTHER

09:05:53.763 --> 09:05:55.763
AMENDMENT WE VOTED AGAINST.

09:06:00.403 --> 09:06:02.403
AND RODINO STATEMENT DURING THE 
NIXON PROCEEDINGS HE MADE IT 

09:06:02.556 --> 09:06:04.556
CLEAR TO PRESIDENT NIXON 
REGARDING HIS

09:06:08.919 --> 09:06:10.919
FAVOR TO COMPLY WITH SUBPOENAS. 
ISSUES PURSUED TO THE WATERGATE 

09:06:11.039 --> 09:06:13.039
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. THE 
CONSTITUTION REINFORCES THE FACT

09:06:17.826 --> 09:06:19.826
THAT WE HAVE THE SOLE POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THE UNDERLYING 

09:06:19.963 --> 09:06:22.067
DECISIONS OF THE TWO COURT 
DECISIONS I MENTION IS THAT WE 

09:06:22.295 --> 09:06:24.383
WERE AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. AS 
A REMINDER TO MY COLLEAGUES THIS

09:06:24.603 --> 09:06:26.603
COMMITTEE ME ULTIMATELY APPROVED
AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT

09:06:34.332 --> 09:06:38.183
IT IS CLEAR IT WAS A CASE WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT CANNOT DICTATE TO 

09:06:38.402 --> 09:06:40.402
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

09:06:43.675 --> 09:06:46.193
WHAT HE WAS REFUSING TO GIVE OR 
NOT. THIS IS WHERE MY FRIENDS 

09:06:46.413 --> 09:06:48.742
STEER OFF THE RAILS. THEY REFUSE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACTS OF THE 

09:06:48.953 --> 09:06:56.725
CASE. THE PRESIDENT TOOK MONEY 
TO USE THE MONIES TO DENY MR. 

09:06:56.876 --> 09:07:03.633
ZELINSKI HE WAS GOING TO GO 
AHEAD AND ANNOUNCE THE 

09:07:03.835 --> 09:07:08.702
INVESTIGATIONS ON CNN. WHAT WAS 
STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS WHEN THE 

09:07:09.462 --> 09:07:11.462
WHISTLEBLOWER LETTER

09:07:17.632 --> 09:07:19.974
OR STATEMENT WAS RELEASED, IT 
WAS OUT OF THE BAG. THAT THE 

09:07:20.192 --> 09:07:22.512
PRESIDENT HAD DONE THIS ON THE 
JULY 25 CALL. LET'S BE CLEAR. 

09:07:22.712 --> 09:07:24.712
THIS IS ABOUT FACTS AND THE 
CONSTITUTION.

09:07:29.491 --> 09:07:31.882
&gt;&gt; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'VE 
BEEN SITTING HERE ALL DAY

09:07:35.672 --> 09:07:40.514
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE ALL DAY 
LONG. I WANT TO SAY THIS TO THE 

09:07:41.130 --> 09:07:43.130
AMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE OUR DAY 
ENDS TODAY.

09:07:49.899 --> 09:07:51.899
MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE 
EXPLAINED THE EVIDENCE THAT WE 

09:07:51.978 --> 09:07:54.062
HAVE HEARD. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND 

09:07:54.272 --> 09:07:56.676
HEARD FROM SO MANY WITNESSES 
ALONG THE WAY. AS WE

09:08:01.684 --> 09:08:03.175
HAVE BEEN UPHOLDING OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO 

09:08:03.176 --> 09:08:05.176
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION, SOME 
TODAY HAVE ARGUED WE HAVE NOT 

09:08:05.302 --> 09:08:07.302
UPHELD OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
OBLIGATION TO LEGISLATE

09:08:14.672 --> 09:08:16.985
AND TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. ALL WE 
WANT TO DO IS IMPEACH THE 

09:08:17.192 --> 09:08:19.321
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
I TRULY WANT TO ASSURE THE 

09:08:19.545 --> 09:08:23.382
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND GIVE YOU 
HOPE THIS IS NOT TRUE. I WANT TO

09:08:24.152 --> 09:08:26.152
MAKE SURE

09:08:28.241 --> 09:08:30.775
THAT WE SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

09:08:30.974 --> 09:08:33.441
ON YOUR BEHALF. DESPITE WHAT 
MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 

09:08:33.582 --> 09:08:37.887
THINK CONGRESS CAN WALK AND CHEW
GUM AT THE SAME TIME.

09:08:42.943 --> 09:08:45.006
THIS CONGRESS HAS BEEN WORKING 
VERY HARD ON BEHALF OF THE 

09:08:45.774 --> 09:08:47.774
AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN SPITE OF 
EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING 

09:08:47.972 --> 09:08:49.972
WITH THIS IMPEACHMENT. THIS VERY
DAY A BILL

09:08:55.383 --> 09:08:57.752
, WE PASSED A BILL THAT LOWERS 
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 

09:08:57.953 --> 09:09:02.180
FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
AMERICANS. HR THREE. IT WILL 

09:09:02.382 --> 09:09:04.800
SAVE OUR TAXPAYERS OVER $456 
BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE.

09:09:11.750 --> 09:09:13.661
AND ALLOW FOR THE EXPANSION OF 
MEDICARE COVERAGE. INCLUDING 

09:09:13.662 --> 09:09:15.561
HEARING, DENTAL AND VISION 
BENEFITS. JUST THIS WEEK WE 

09:09:15.562 --> 09:09:17.797
ACHIEVED MONUMENTAL CHANGES TO 
THE U.S. MEXICO CANADA TRADE 

09:09:17.946 --> 09:09:23.922
AGREEMENT. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING 
A LONG TIME FOR THAT. THIS 

09:09:24.142 --> 09:09:26.272
AGREEMENT IS HUGE. IT'S A HUGE 
WIN FOR OUR FAMILIES, WORKERS 

09:09:26.482 --> 09:09:30.842
AND BUSINESS OWNERS. IN EVERY 
DISTRICT ACROSS THE UNITED 

09:09:31.011 --> 09:09:35.842
STATES. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY 

09:09:36.052 --> 09:09:38.052
COMPETITIVE IN A GLOBAL 
ENVIRONMENT. YESTERDAY WE VOTED 

09:09:38.342 --> 09:09:43.982
TO SUPPORT THE NDA A. 
LEGISLATION THAT WILL KEEP OUR 

09:09:44.741 --> 09:09:49.301
COUNTRY SAFE. AND WILL GIVE A 
RAISE TO OUR SERVICEMEMBERS AND 

09:09:49.502 --> 09:09:53.641
INCLUDE IMPORTANT REFORMS. 
LIKELY FOR ALL FEDERAL EMPLOYEES

09:09:56.940 --> 09:10:01.192
AND RE-APPEALING THE WIDOWS TAX.
YOU IN ON THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE

09:10:01.395 --> 09:10:03.395
WORKED TOGETHER. THIS WEEK BY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES

09:10:06.281 --> 09:10:08.601
, CONGRESSMAN RUSH AND PAUL AND 
I WERE AMONG A BIPARTISAN GROUP 

09:10:08.804 --> 09:10:11.361
OF LAWMAKERS TO INTRODUCE 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD END 

09:10:11.562 --> 09:10:15.601
ONLINE CHILD EXPLOITATION. SINCE
WE HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THIS 

09:10:16.371 --> 09:10:21.731
ROOM TODAY A DEAL HAS BEEN 
FORGED. BY OUR COLLEAGUES. TO 

09:10:21.948 --> 09:10:27.908
FUND OUR GOVERNMENT. AND AVOID 
ANOTHER SHUTDOWN. THROUGHOUT 

09:10:28.675 --> 09:10:30.675
THIS INVESTIGATION

09:10:33.837 --> 09:10:35.837
MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN 
FULFILLING OUR DUTIES. AS 

09:10:35.964 --> 09:10:39.971
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. DO NOT BE 
DECEIVED. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 

09:10:40.391 --> 09:10:45.008
ON THE AMERICAN PUBLIC'S BEHALF.
EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN SPITE OF 

09:10:45.773 --> 09:10:51.191
THE TRAGEDY WE ARE IN NOW WITH 
THIS IMPEACHMENT. THIS CONGRESS,

09:10:51.411 --> 09:10:59.845
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WE
HAVE PASSED OVER 275 BILLS. 275 

09:11:00.001 --> 09:11:02.001
BILLS.

09:11:05.005 --> 09:11:07.005
WE ARE DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY. 
AND DELIVERING ON THE PROMISES 

09:11:07.141 --> 09:11:10.805
THAT WE MAKE TO EACH AND EVERY 
ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I WANT 

09:11:11.021 --> 09:11:15.511
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO KNOW 
THIS. WE ARE TRULY DISHEARTENED.

09:11:15.891 --> 09:11:22.271
BY WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE WITH 
IMPEACHMENT. DO KNOW WE ARE 

09:11:22.491 --> 09:11:28.465
WORKING ON YOUR BEHALF. EACH AND
EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE WILL 

09:11:28.680 --> 09:11:34.217
CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE SWORE AN 
OATH TO DO. THAT IS TO PROTECT 

09:11:34.420 --> 09:11:40.334
AND SERVE YOU. EVEN IN THIS 
MOMENT. IN THIS TRAGEDY, BE REST

09:11:40.501 --> 09:11:47.711
ASSURED WE WILL DO JUST THAT. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE

09:11:53.782 --> 09:11:55.782
&gt;&gt;

09:12:05.429 --> 09:12:08.501
I TRY TO TEACH MY STUDENTS TO 
PICK THE BEST ARGUMENT. I WILL 

09:12:08.661 --> 09:12:10.661
IGNORE

09:12:13.071 --> 09:12:15.071
ALL OF THE FRIVOLOUS PROCESS 
OBJECTIONS ABOUT THE ROOMS AND 

09:12:15.191 --> 09:12:17.521
THE TEMPERATURE. ALL THAT STUFF 
WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT. I WILL TRY 

09:12:17.741 --> 09:12:21.973
TO MAKE WHAT I THINK IS THE BEST
ARGUMENT OR RECONSTRUCT THE BEST

09:12:22.191 --> 09:12:24.191
ARGUMENT THAT HAS COME OUT 
TODAY.

09:12:28.335 --> 09:12:30.441
OUR COLLEAGUES FACE A DIFFICULT 
TASK. 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

09:12:30.661 --> 09:12:34.892
BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
DONE SOMETHING WRONG. IN THESE 

09:12:35.101 --> 09:12:39.610
ACTIONS OF TRYING TO PRESSURE A 
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO GET 

09:12:39.812 --> 09:12:41.812
INVOLVED IN OUR ELECTION.

09:12:45.972 --> 09:12:49.381
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM THERE. THEY 
HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM WHICH IS 

09:12:49.601 --> 09:12:53.191
THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING AND 
UNCONTRADICTED BODY OF EVIDENCE 

09:12:53.431 --> 09:12:55.431
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID THAT.

09:12:59.430 --> 09:13:01.430
THE PRESIDENT WITHHELD HUNDREDS 
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 

09:13:01.905 --> 09:13:05.541
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. THAT WE HAD
VOTED FOR OR BESIEGED FOR AN 

09:13:05.691 --> 09:13:07.691
ALLY.

09:13:10.100 --> 09:13:12.751
HE WAS TRYING TO GET THE 
PRESIDENT OF THAT COUNTRY. TO 

09:13:12.901 --> 09:13:14.901
AGREE

09:13:19.430 --> 09:13:21.430
TO CONDUCT A PRESS CONFERENCE. 
HE WOULD SAY HE WAS 

09:13:21.571 --> 09:13:24.776
INVESTIGATING THE BIDENS. HE 
ALSO WANTED PRESIDENT ZELINSKI 

09:13:25.192 --> 09:13:27.192
TO VALIDATE VLADIMIR PUTIN'S

09:13:30.751 --> 09:13:32.751
DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY THEORY
ABOUT THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.

09:13:39.450 --> 09:13:42.010
WHICH IS THAT IT WAS THE UKRAINE
AND NOT RUSSIA THAT ENGAGED IN 

09:13:42.210 --> 09:13:44.470
THE SWEEPING AND SYSTEMATIC 
CAMPAIGN TO INTERFERE IN OUR 

09:13:44.630 --> 09:13:48.774
ELECTIONS. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH 
THAT? WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

09:13:48.990 --> 09:13:50.990
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PROCESS 
FOR MONTHS. I THINK THEY 

09:13:51.110 --> 09:13:55.004
UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SERIOUS 
INVESTIGATION. WITH THE RIGOROUS

09:13:55.150 --> 09:13:59.841
METHODS. AND SERIOUS INESCAPABLE
CONCLUSIONS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

09:14:00.836 --> 09:14:07.875
ARE FOCUSED ON IT. THE MAJORITY 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT 

09:14:08.023 --> 09:14:13.090
IMPEACHED. ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS
ANYWAY. HUGE NUMBERS OF 

09:14:13.310 --> 09:14:15.960
AMERICANS ARE VERY DISTURBED BY 
THIS. WHAT HAVE THEY COME UP 

09:14:16.110 --> 09:14:19.520
WITH? THEY HAVE NOT FOUND AN 
ALIBI.

09:14:34.098 --> 09:14:36.444
THEY COME UP WITH THE DEFENSE 
WHICH TO ME LOOKS A MITIGATING 

09:14:36.660 --> 09:14:38.833
FACTOR. A PLEA FOR MERCY. THE 
PRESIDENT DID ALL OF THESE 

09:14:39.044 --> 09:14:40.972
THINGS. HIS MOTIVE IS 
MISUNDERSTOOD. ALL OF US THINK 

09:14:40.973 --> 09:14:43.087
HE WAS DOING IT BECAUSE HE 
WANTED TO ADVANCE HIS OWN 

09:14:43.300 --> 09:14:45.300
REELECTION PROSPECTS. IN SOME 
SENSE HE WANTED TO HELP FOR 

09:14:45.470 --> 09:14:47.470
WHATEVER REASON HIS FRIEND 
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

09:14:52.751 --> 09:14:55.064
PUTIN HAS BEEN ON TV BRAGGING 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IS 

09:14:55.282 --> 09:14:58.060
FOCUSED ON THE UKRAINE IN THE 
2016 ELECTION AND NOT RUSSIA. 

09:14:58.500 --> 09:15:00.500
NOTE TO MR. PUTIN THAT'S NOT 
RIGHT. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S 

09:15:00.670 --> 09:15:02.670
GOING ON. IN ANY EVENT

09:15:06.620 --> 09:15:12.080
, THE NEW ARGUMENT IS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS NOT TRYING TO 

09:15:12.300 --> 09:15:16.700
ADVANCE HIS OWN POLITICAL 
INTEREST. HE WAS TRYING TO 

09:15:16.877 --> 09:15:18.877
ADVANCE

09:15:20.811 --> 09:15:25.442
LITTLE-KNOWN CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
CORRUPTION. THAT'S WHY SO MUCH 

09:15:25.652 --> 09:15:27.694
OF A DISCUSSION TODAY HAS BEEN 
ABOUT CORRUPTION.

09:15:35.460 --> 09:15:39.062
I WANT TO CATALOG SOME OF THE 
OTHER ONES. TO TRY TO PUT THIS 

09:15:39.820 --> 09:15:43.090
IN ORDER. SO PEOPLE CAN 
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH 

09:15:43.310 --> 09:15:45.310
THEIR BEST ARGUMENT.

09:15:56.435 --> 09:15:58.600
THE PRESIDENT NEVER RAISE THE 
WORD CORRUPTION ON THE JULY 25 

09:15:58.802 --> 09:16:00.629
TELEPHONE CALL. BIDENS NAME WAS 
MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES. WASN'T 

09:16:00.630 --> 09:16:02.563
CORRUPTION, CORRUPTION, 
CORRUPTION. IT WAS BIDEN, BIDEN,

09:16:02.564 --> 09:16:05.620
BIDEN. YOU NEVER RAISED ANY 
OTHER COMPANIES AT ALL. IT WAS 

09:16:05.835 --> 09:16:07.835
ALL ABOUT CHARISMA

09:16:16.523 --> 09:16:18.523
, HUNTER BIDENS COMPANY. THAT'S 
ALL HE MENTIONED. HE'S NEVER 

09:16:18.592 --> 09:16:20.453
MENTIONED ANY OTHER COMPANY IN 
CONNECTION WITH CORRUPTION IN 

09:16:20.454 --> 09:16:24.843
THE UKRAINE IN 2017 AND 18 THE 
PRESIDENT PASSED IT ALONG. HE 

09:16:25.050 --> 09:16:28.245
DID NOT EVEN RAISE THE BIDENS AT
THAT POINT IT BECAME AN ISSUE IN

09:16:28.403 --> 09:16:33.394
2019. WHY? JOE BIDEN HAD 
SURPASSED HIM IN THE PUBLIC 

09:16:34.153 --> 09:16:38.205
OPINION POLLS. NOW SUDDENLY IT 
WAS A BIG ISSUE. HE CARED ABOUT 

09:16:38.351 --> 09:16:44.720
IT. WHAT IS THE OTHER EVIDENCE? 
THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM, RUDY 

09:16:44.867 --> 09:16:46.867
GIULIANI

09:16:49.043 --> 09:16:51.113
AND PARNAS AND FRUMAN ENGAGE IN 
A SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE 

09:16:51.313 --> 09:16:53.313
U.S. AMBASSADOR WHO WAS

09:16:57.171 --> 09:16:59.171
AGAINST THE UKRAINE. THE 
PRESIDENT GOT HER OUT OF THE 

09:16:59.271 --> 09:17:01.380
WAY. HE PULLED HER BACK. ALL THE
EVIDENCE SHOWS THEY WERE 

09:17:01.600 --> 09:17:03.491
PROMOTING CORRUPTION AND A 
CORRUPT SCHEME. THEY WERE NOT 

09:17:03.492 --> 09:17:05.492
TRYING TO ATTACK IT. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU CHAIRMAN.

09:17:12.852 --> 09:17:14.569
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSES DO YOU 
GENERALLY SEEK RECOGNITION? 

09:17:14.570 --> 09:17:17.399
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. BRIEFLY MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

09:17:17.540 --> 09:17:25.969
MEMBERS, BIDEN'S NAME WAS USED 
MULTIPLE TIMES. I THINK THAT IS 

09:17:26.190 --> 09:17:28.190
A LITTLE MISLEADING.

09:17:31.239 --> 09:17:34.700
THE ONLY PLACE IN THIS WHOLE 
TELEPHONE CALL WHERE BIDEN IS 

09:17:34.915 --> 09:17:43.100
EVEN BROUGHT UP IS IN ONE LITTLE
PARAGRAPH. THAT WAS ON PAGE 4 OF

09:17:43.320 --> 09:17:46.740
FIVE PAGES OF THE TRANSCRIPTS. 
MOST OF THE CALL WAS ABOUT 

09:17:47.169 --> 09:17:49.750
CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  AND THE NEW 

09:17:49.952 --> 09:17:55.489
PARLIAMENT. TALKING ABOUT HOW A 
LOT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 

09:17:55.891 --> 09:17:58.059
AREN'T PITCHING IN WITH THE AID.

09:18:03.129 --> 09:18:07.179
THAT WAS THE UKRAINE AS MUCH AS 
THE UNITED STATES HAD. ALL KINDS

09:18:07.399 --> 09:18:13.299
OF THINGS. IT WAS A LONG PHONE 
CALL. IT IS DISINGENUOUS TO SAY 

09:18:13.519 --> 09:18:16.189
THE WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT THIS. 
BIDEN WAS MENTIONED SEVERAL 

09:18:16.334 --> 09:18:18.334
TIMES.

09:18:23.291 --> 09:18:25.399
I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TWEETS THIS OUT. HE READS THE 

09:18:25.619 --> 09:18:27.619
TRANSCRIPT. I WISH PEOPLE WOULD.
EVERYBODY WATCHES TV.

09:18:33.109 --> 09:18:35.679
THEY GET THESE COMMENTS. I DID 
THIS WITH MY HUSBAND. I SO WOULD

09:18:35.888 --> 09:18:38.009
YOU PLEASE READ THE TRANSCRIPTS.
IT'S ONLY FIVE PAGES LONG. IT 

09:18:38.233 --> 09:18:42.969
DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH. AFTER HE
READ IT HE WAS LIKE THAT IS IT 

09:18:43.169 --> 09:18:48.034
THAT'S ALL THEY'VE GOT? THIS IS 
A MENTION ABOUT BIDEN. PAGE 5, 

09:18:48.239 --> 09:18:53.802
THE OTHER THING, THERE'S A LOT 
OF TALK ABOUT BIDEN'S SON. THAT 

09:18:54.002 --> 09:18:58.042
BIDEN STOPPED THE PROSECUTION. A
LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO FIND OUT 

09:18:58.798 --> 09:19:01.429
ABOUT THAT. WHATEVER YOU CAN DO 
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD 

09:19:02.199 --> 09:19:05.559
BE GREAT. BIDEN WENT AROUND 
BRAGGING THAT HE STOPPED THE 

09:19:05.699 --> 09:19:09.599
PROSECUTION. IF YOU CAN LOOK 
INTO IT, IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE TO 

09:19:09.738 --> 09:19:14.282
ME. THAT'S IT FOLKS. THAT'S ALL 
THERE IS. MR. CHAIRMAN I YIELD 

09:19:14.429 --> 09:19:17.989
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION NOW OCCURS ON 

09:19:18.429 --> 09:19:24.588

09:22:10.609 --> 09:22:12.609
OFFERED BY MR. ROSENTHAL OF 
PENNSYLVANIA.

09:22:21.901 --> 09:22:23.800
STAGE FIVE BEGINNING ON LINE 6. 
STRIKE ARTICLE TO. 

09:22:23.801 --> 09:22:26.139
&gt;&gt; I WITHDRAW MY POINT OF ORDER.
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED 

09:22:26.359 --> 09:22:27.840
FOR FIVE MINUTES TO EXPLAIN HIS 
AMENDMENT. 

09:22:27.841 --> 09:22:29.975
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; MY AMENDMENT WOULD STRIKE ALL

09:22:30.179 --> 09:22:34.812
OF ARTICLE 2. THE FACTS SIMPLY 
DO NOT ALIGN WITH THE DEMOCRATS 

09:22:35.019 --> 09:22:39.239
CLAIM OF OBSTRUCTION. OUR 
GOVERNMENT HAS THREE BRANCHES 

09:22:39.460 --> 09:22:41.460
FOR A REASON.

09:22:46.031 --> 09:22:48.031
WHEN THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE 

09:22:48.129 --> 09:22:50.129
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IT IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE RESOLVED BY THE 

09:22:50.249 --> 09:22:52.312
THIRD BRANCH, THE COURT. 
REPUBLICANS RECOGNIZE THIS IN 

09:22:52.449 --> 09:22:54.449
2011.

09:22:56.881 --> 09:22:58.598
WHEN THE INVESTIGATED PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S FAST AND FURIOUS 

09:22:58.599 --> 09:23:00.779
SCANDAL. THE FAST AND FURIOUS 
CANDLE ALLOWED 2000 FIREARMS

09:23:05.178 --> 09:23:07.457
TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF DRUG 
CARTELS. AND RESULTED IN THE 

09:23:07.669 --> 09:23:09.959
DEATH OF AN AMERICAN BORDER 
PATROL AGENT. PEOPLE ACTUALLY 

09:23:10.099 --> 09:23:14.679
DIED IN PRESIDENT OBAMA SCANDAL.
THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLICANS 

09:23:14.899 --> 09:23:18.309
INVESTIGATION OF THE SCANDAL 
THEY MADE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO 

09:23:18.528 --> 09:23:21.262
ACCOMMODATE THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. YET DESPITE 

09:23:21.479 --> 09:23:25.971
THEIR EFFORTS PRESIDENT OBAMA 
INVOKE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 

09:23:26.178 --> 09:23:31.040
BARRED TESTIMONY AND DOCUMENTS. 
WHAT DID THE REPUBLICANS DO? THE

09:23:31.791 --> 09:23:33.791
APPROPRIATE THING.

09:23:42.911 --> 09:23:44.911
THEY WENT TO THE COURTS. 
COMPARED THOSE EFFORTS WITH WHAT

09:23:45.019 --> 09:23:47.019
WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE DEMOCRATS 
DURING THIS IMPEACHMENT SHAM. 

09:23:47.159 --> 09:23:49.031
HOUSE DEMOCRATS COULD WORK FOR 
THE ADMINISTRATION TO REACH 

09:23:49.032 --> 09:23:52.691
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THEIR 
REQUEST. THEY DIDN'T. WHY IS 

09:23:52.890 --> 09:23:58.810
THAT? IT IS SIMPLE. THEY HAVE A 
DEADLINE TO SEND THIS MESS OUT 

09:23:59.579 --> 09:24:02.498
OF CONGRESS AND INTO THE SENATE 
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

09:24:10.957 --> 09:24:12.869
DESPITE WHAT YOU HEAR FROM MY 
COLLEAGUES THE ADMINISTRATION 

09:24:12.870 --> 09:24:14.804
HAS CONSISTENTLY COOPERATED WITH
DEMOCRATS. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE

09:24:14.805 --> 09:24:17.119
BEEN OUT TO GET THIS PRESIDENT 
SINCE THE VERY MOMENT HE WAS 

09:24:17.339 --> 09:24:21.830
ELECTED. LET'S GO THROUGH THE 
NUMBERS. OVER 25 ADMINISTRATION 

09:24:22.039 --> 09:24:24.039
OFFICIALS HAVE TESTIFIED BEFORE 
THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. 

09:24:24.319 --> 09:24:28.389
OVER 25. 20 ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS HAVE TESTIFIED BEFORE 

09:24:29.159 --> 09:24:31.159
THIS COMMITTEE.

09:24:33.529 --> 09:24:35.448
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO 
HANDED OVER MORE THAN 100,000 

09:24:35.449 --> 09:24:38.133
PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. SINCE THE 
START OF THE SHAM IMPEACHMENT 

09:24:38.279 --> 09:24:40.279
INQUIRY.

09:24:43.760 --> 09:24:45.760
DEMOCRATS HAVE THREATENED 
WITNESSES.

09:24:49.946 --> 09:24:52.279
THAT QUOTE ON QUOTE ANY FAILURE 
TO APPEAR IN RESPONSE TO A 

09:24:52.499 --> 09:24:54.568
LETTER REQUESTING THEIR PRESENTS
WOULD CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF 

09:24:54.709 --> 09:24:58.588
OBSTRUCTION. LET ME GO THROUGH 
THAT LANGUAGE. A LETTER WOULD 

09:24:58.742 --> 09:25:03.770
CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF 
OBSTRUCTION. THAT'S NOT A 

09:25:03.973 --> 09:25:05.973
SUBPOENA THAT IS A LETTER. 
DEMOCRATS HAVE TOLD

09:25:10.148 --> 09:25:12.033
THE STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE 
THAT THEY INSISTED ON USING 

09:25:12.034 --> 09:25:15.148
AGENCY COUNSEL TO PROTECT 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH CONFIDENTIALITY

09:25:15.298 --> 09:25:20.678
INTEREST. THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR 
SALARIES WITHHELD. THAT SOUNDS 

09:25:20.898 --> 09:25:26.596
LIKE ABUSE OF POWER. I DIGRESS A
LITTLE BIT. DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT 

09:25:26.800 --> 09:25:28.800
AFFORDED THIS PRESIDENT BASIC 
PROCEDURE

09:25:31.708 --> 09:25:33.834
PROTECTIONS. SUCH AS THE RIGHT 
TO SEE THE EVIDENCE AND THE 

09:25:34.035 --> 09:25:36.729
RIGHT TO CALL WITNESSES OR THE 
RIGHT TO HAVE COUNSEL AT 

09:25:36.874 --> 09:25:42.318
HEARINGS. JUST NOT THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS BEEN 

09:25:42.738 --> 09:25:45.088
RAILROADED BY THE DEMOCRATS. 
JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS VOTED DOWN 

09:25:45.528 --> 09:25:48.084
MY OWN SUBPOENA AND MY MOM OCEAN
MOTION TO SUBPOENA.

09:25:51.843 --> 09:25:54.178
EVEN THOUGH I SAID HE OR SHE 
COULD TESTIFY AT THE EXECUTIVE 

09:25:54.398 --> 09:26:01.609
SESSION. YET THEY VOTED IT DOWN.
CHAIRMAN NADLER REFUSED THE 

09:26:01.810 --> 09:26:05.882
REQUEST THE CHAIRMAN SHIFT 
TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 

09:26:06.308 --> 09:26:08.308
HOUSE DEMOCRATS ALSO DENIED 
EVERY REPUBLICAN REQUEST FOR A 

09:26:08.839 --> 09:26:16.233
FACT WITNESS. I ASK WHO IS 
REALLY OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS? THE

09:26:16.472 --> 09:26:18.658
DEMOCRATS HAVE NO CASE WHEN IT 
COMES TO OBSTRUCTION.

09:26:22.412 --> 09:26:24.298
THIS OBSTRUCTION CHARGE IS 
BASELESS AND BOGUS. IF THEY 

09:26:24.299 --> 09:26:26.442
REALLY WANTED TO CHARGE SOMEWHAT
THE WITH OBSTRUCTION HOW ABOUT 

09:26:26.658 --> 09:26:28.658
THEY START WITH ADAM SCHIFF. 
THANK YOU.

09:26:33.738 --> 09:26:35.738
&gt;&gt;

09:26:41.088 --> 09:26:43.208
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY 
ANSWERING MY COLLEAGUES 

09:26:43.430 --> 09:26:48.347
QUESTION. WHO IS REALLY 
OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS? WHO IS? 

09:26:48.568 --> 09:26:50.568
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THE TEXT
OF THE CONSTITUTION

09:26:56.120 --> 09:26:58.120
DEVOTES A FEW SENTENCES TO A 
DISCUSSION OF IMPEACHMENT POWER.

09:26:58.208 --> 09:27:00.365
AMONG THE FEW SENTENCES IS THE 
CLEAR STATEMENT THAT THE HOUSE 

09:27:00.578 --> 09:27:04.150
POSSESSES THE SOLE POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THAT MEANS IT WAS 

09:27:04.368 --> 09:27:06.518
IN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE 
HOUSE TO DETERMINE WHAT EVIDENCE

09:27:06.718 --> 09:27:09.348
IS NECESSARY FOR IT TOGETHER IN 
ORDER TO EXERCISE THAT POWER.

09:27:17.597 --> 09:27:23.348
THE HOUSE IS SO POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT WOULD BE HOLED INTO 

09:27:23.548 --> 09:27:25.548
THE DICTATES OF THE JUDICIAL RAN
THE

09:27:31.369 --> 09:27:33.261
THAN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. PAST 
PRESIDENTS HAVE DISAPPROVED OF 

09:27:33.262 --> 09:27:35.211
IMPEACHMENT AND CRITICIZE THE 
HOUSE. DOUBTED ITS MOTIVES AND 

09:27:35.212 --> 09:27:37.212
INSISTED THEY DID NOTHING WRONG.

09:27:43.088 --> 09:27:45.238
NO PRESIDENT INCLUDING PRESIDENT
NIXON WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF 

09:27:45.458 --> 09:27:47.359
BEING IMPEACHED FOR OBSTRUCTION 
OF CONGRESS HAD DECLARED HIMSELF

09:27:47.360 --> 09:27:49.247
AND THE ENTIRE BRANCH OF 
GOVERNMENT HE OVERSEES TOTALLY 

09:27:49.248 --> 09:27:51.388
EXEMPT FROM SUBPOENAS ISSUED BY 
THE HOUSE. PURSUANT TO ITS SOLE 

09:27:51.611 --> 09:27:56.698
POWER OF IMPEACHMENT. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS MADE COMPLIANCE WITH 

09:27:56.918 --> 09:27:58.918
EVERY DEMAND. A CONDITION OF 
CONSIDERING

09:28:07.569 --> 09:28:09.457
WHETHER TO HONOR SUBPOENAS. HE 
HAS DIRECTED HIS SENIOR 

09:28:09.458 --> 09:28:11.377
OFFICIALS TO VIOLATE THEIR OWN 
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO TURNOVER 

09:28:11.378 --> 09:28:13.378
SUBPOENAS AND PROVIDE TESTIMONY.
THE HOUSE WAS ONLY ABLE TO 

09:28:13.460 --> 09:28:15.460
CONDUCT ITS INQUIRY INTO THE 
UKRAINE MATTER BECAUSE SEVERAL 

09:28:15.578 --> 09:28:18.441
WITNESSES LIKE THE AMBASSADORS 
IN THE ETERNAL COLONEL

09:28:21.968 --> 09:28:24.188
HAVE THE COURAGE TO DEFY THE 
PRESIDENTS UNLAWFUL COMMANDS.

09:28:29.657 --> 09:28:33.288
MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT 
INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD WAIT 

09:28:33.507 --> 09:28:35.507
TO GET FROM THE COURT.

09:28:40.279 --> 09:28:43.031
WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT TO GET
FROM THE COURT IF THE PRESIDENT 

09:28:43.239 --> 09:28:44.947
WOULD COMPLY AND PROVIDE 
DOCUMENTS. I REMEMBER WHEN 

09:28:44.948 --> 09:28:46.948
AMBASSADOR SUMLIN WAS 
TESTIFYING. HE SAID HE WAS 

09:28:47.070 --> 09:28:50.158
TESTIFYING FROM MEMORY. HE 
WASN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO HAVE 

09:28:50.342 --> 09:28:52.342
ACCESS

09:28:54.712 --> 09:28:56.829
TO HIS OWN NOTES IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

09:28:57.031 --> 09:29:02.558
ABUSED HIS POWER AND IS A 
CONTINUED THREAT TO OUR 

09:29:02.762 --> 09:29:04.637
DEMOCRACY AND NATIONAL SECURITY.
HE PUT HIMSELF BEFORE THE 

09:29:04.638 --> 09:29:07.218
COUNTRY AND NO ONE IS ABOVE THE 
LAW. WHEN I THINK OF OUR 

09:29:07.422 --> 09:29:12.458
ELECTIONS AND MY CONCERN, OUR 
ELECTIONS SHOULD BE DECIDED BY 

09:29:12.600 --> 09:29:14.600
US.

09:29:19.529 --> 09:29:23.972
WE TALKED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
ABOUT THE REAL REASON FOR ALL OF

09:29:24.188 --> 09:29:29.288
THIS WAS HIS CONCERN ABOUT 
CORRUPTION. AS ONE OF MY 

09:29:29.488 --> 09:29:32.030
COLLEAGUES SAID EARLIER TODAY IF
HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT 

09:29:32.238 --> 09:29:34.238
CORRUPTION HE WOULD BE CONCERNED
ABOUT

09:29:41.804 --> 09:29:44.598
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE. AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HE

09:29:44.801 --> 09:29:46.801
HAS BEEN AFFILIATED WITH. WHO 
ARE AWAITING SENTENCES OR SENT 

09:29:46.898 --> 09:29:48.898
TO PRISON, SERVING TIME OR ARE 
AWAITING COURT.

09:29:52.849 --> 09:29:54.772
IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT MEMBERS OF 
THE MINORITY NEVER ACTUALLY 

09:29:54.773 --> 09:29:56.237
DEFENDED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
MISCONDUCT. BY DECEIT DISPUTING 

09:29:56.238 --> 09:30:00.048
THE FACTS OF THE CASE. BUT 
INSTEAD TRYING TO DISTRACT WITH 

09:30:00.260 --> 09:30:02.260
THE RELEVANT ISSUES.

09:30:04.945 --> 09:30:07.237
I DON'T BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUES ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

09:30:07.458 --> 09:30:11.288
ANSWERED. FORGET PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. IS IT EVER OKAY FOR A 

09:30:12.058 --> 09:30:16.138
PRESIDENT TO INVITE FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION? 

09:30:16.349 --> 09:30:22.077
WITH THAT I YIELD TO MY 
COLLEAGUE FROM CALIFORNIA. 

09:30:22.078 --> 09:30:28.238
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO ASK UNANIMOUS
CONSENT BEFORE THE END OF THE 

09:30:28.458 --> 09:30:32.942
RECORD. A LETTER FROM THE 
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL. DATED 

09:30:33.158 --> 09:30:36.590
OCTOBER 8, 2019. 
&gt;&gt; WITH THAT OBJECTION.

09:30:42.210 --> 09:30:49.233
&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO 
RECEIVE INFORMATION. WE HAVE A 

09:30:49.437 --> 09:30:51.770
RIGHT TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ON THE 
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN 

09:30:51.982 --> 09:30:53.982
ABLE TO OBTAIN.

09:30:56.369 --> 09:30:58.369
IMPEACHMENT IS SOLELY IN THE 
PROVINCE OF THE CONGRESS. JUST 

09:30:58.488 --> 09:31:03.818
ON THE NARROW ISSUE OF THE 
ASSERTION OF PRIVILEGE, I THINK 

09:31:04.018 --> 09:31:08.072
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE 
PRIVILEGE, NO PRIVILEGE WAS 

09:31:08.278 --> 09:31:10.278
ASSERTED IN THIS LETTER BY THE 
COUNCIL.

09:31:13.841 --> 09:31:17.638
HE DOESN'T SAY IT IS EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE. HE DOESN'T SAY 

09:31:18.081 --> 09:31:20.238
ANYTHING YOU COULD TAKE TO 
COURT. HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE 

09:31:20.458 --> 09:31:22.854
WHAT WE ARE DOING. THEY WILL NOT
GIVE US ANYTHING.

09:31:27.638 --> 09:31:33.668
THAT IS AN ABSURD SITUATION. IT 
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT IS REALLY 

09:31:33.814 --> 09:31:40.368
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. I THINK
THE GENTLE LADY FOR YIELDING. I 

09:31:40.588 --> 09:31:45.886
YIELD BACK TO HER. MY TIME HAS 
EXPIRED. 

09:31:45.887 --> 09:31:51.529
&gt;&gt; FOR PURPOSES. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL DISTRACT THE LAST 

09:31:51.672 --> 09:31:55.198
WORD. LISTENING TO MY TWO 
COLLEAGUES FROM CALIFORNIA, THIS

09:31:55.417 --> 09:32:00.137
SEEMS TO BE THE GREATEST AMOUNT 
OF CIRCULAR REASONING

09:32:03.729 --> 09:32:06.459
WE HAVE HEARD IN THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT. 

09:32:06.659 --> 09:32:11.557
THIS IS ONE THAT GRABS THE BLUE 
RIBBON. WHAT I HEAR IS AN 

09:32:12.308 --> 09:32:16.862
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, IF THE 
WHITE HOUSE DOES NOT GIVE THE 

09:32:17.068 --> 09:32:22.398
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS
COMMITTEE EVERYTHING WE ASK FOR,

09:32:22.618 --> 09:32:24.883
THEN THAT IS OBSTRUCTION OF 
CONGRESS AND AN IMPEACHABLE 

09:32:25.028 --> 09:32:30.238
OFFENSE. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE LAW
SAYS OR WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE. 

09:32:30.678 --> 09:32:34.157
THERE ARE CERTAIN PRIVILEGES AND
IMMUNITIES THAT THE PRESIDENT 

09:32:34.318 --> 09:32:39.298
HAS. YOU ARE RESPECTIVE OF 
WHETHER WE ARE DOING OVERSIGHT 

09:32:39.728 --> 09:32:45.052
OR WHETHER WE ARE USING OUR 
ARTICLE TO POWER. THE SOLE POWER

09:32:45.268 --> 09:32:49.498
OF IMPEACHMENT. HE OUGHT TO BE 
ABLE TO PRESENT THOSE IN A COURT

09:32:50.268 --> 09:32:52.953
OF LAW. THIS IS NOT A COURT OF 
LAW.

09:33:00.923 --> 09:33:03.058
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY 
PRIVILEGES INVOLVED. WE KNOW 

09:33:03.278 --> 09:33:08.528
WHAT THE ANSWER WILL BE. WE WILL
BLOW ANY CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE 

09:33:08.668 --> 09:33:12.861
AWAY. WE WILL BLOW ANY TYPE OF 
EXECUTIVE IMMUNITY AWAY. WE ARE 

09:33:13.069 --> 09:33:15.069
GOING TO SIMPLY SAY WE WANTED,

09:33:18.977 --> 09:33:23.558
WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE INFORMATION
OR DOING SOME LEGITIMATE 

09:33:23.701 --> 09:33:32.347
OVERSIGHT. WE KNOW THAT THE 
REJECTION OF THE ARGUMENT THAT 

09:33:32.568 --> 09:33:35.387
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO 
COURT FOR THAT IS BOGUS.

09:33:39.408 --> 09:33:41.759
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS
GONE TO COURT. TO TRY TO GET 

09:33:41.973 --> 09:33:44.198
ENFORCEMENT SUBPOENAS THAT ARE A
RESULT OF THIS IMPEACHMENT 

09:33:44.339 --> 09:33:47.117
INQUIRY. THE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST
DON AGAIN.

09:33:52.418 --> 09:33:54.762
IT HAS GOTTEN AS FAR AS THE DC 
CIRCUIT. OTHERS ARE PENDING 

09:33:55.188 --> 09:33:58.350
FURTHER BACKWARDS. IN THE 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WHAT I WOULD 

09:33:58.548 --> 09:34:06.178
LIKE TO ASK BY MY FRIENDS ON THE
MAJORITY SIDE, OKAY THEY WERE 

09:34:06.402 --> 09:34:09.068
DONE WITH THIS IMPEACHMENT 
INQUIRY NEXT WEEK. THE HOUSE 

09:34:09.228 --> 09:34:14.047
PASS BOTH ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. IT GOES TO THE 

09:34:14.248 --> 09:34:19.478
SENATE FOR TRIAL. DOES THAT MEAN
THE WHOLE NEXUS OF WHY YOU WERE 

09:34:19.698 --> 09:34:25.228
ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE THOSE 
SUBPOENAS IS GONE? ARE YOU GOING

09:34:25.447 --> 09:34:30.737
TO GO TO COURT AND SAY IT IS 
GONE? WE ARE MOVED TO DISMISS 

09:34:30.939 --> 09:34:35.811
THOSE ACTIONS TO SUPPORT 
ENFORCEMENT OF THE SUBPOENAS? IF

09:34:36.018 --> 09:34:39.629
YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE ARGUMENT 
THAT I JUST HEARD YOU HAVE TO DO

09:34:39.831 --> 09:34:41.831
IT. I DOUBTED.

09:34:46.628 --> 09:34:49.238
&gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE MYSELF. FOR FIVE 
MINUTES.

09:34:53.636 --> 09:34:55.988
THE ACTIONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
OF THE PRESIDENT IN THIS CASE 

09:34:56.758 --> 09:35:00.289
ARE DIFFERENT IN KIND FROM ALL 
PREVIOUS ACTIONS

09:35:04.438 --> 09:35:07.091
OF EXECUTIVES OF PRESIDENTS. 
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF A CERTAIN

09:35:07.268 --> 09:35:15.838
PRIVILEGE. RATHER THE COUNSEL 
WROTE GIVING YOUR INQUIRY LACKS 

09:35:16.058 --> 09:35:18.058
ANY LEGITIMATE CONSTITUTIONAL 
FOUNDATION

09:35:29.452 --> 09:35:33.161
THAT IS OUR FUNCTION. THAT 
SENTENCE SHOWS RIGHT THERE.

09:35:37.198 --> 09:35:44.098
NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IF THE 
WHITE HOUSE HAS SIMPLY ASSERTED 

09:35:44.318 --> 09:35:46.577
PRIVILEGES FOR A NUMBER OF 
WITNESSES THAT COULD BE 

09:35:46.718 --> 09:35:48.718
ADJUDICATED.

09:35:54.311 --> 09:35:57.771
TO OPPOSE THAT AS A REASON FOR 
IMPEACHMENT.

09:36:01.745 --> 09:36:03.830
THAT WOULD BE INVALID. THAT'S 
NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. 

09:36:04.028 --> 09:36:06.028
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT

09:36:10.612 --> 09:36:12.612
SAYING HE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE OUR
IMPEACHMENT. HE WILL NOT 

09:36:12.727 --> 09:36:16.377
PARTICIPATE IN IT. HE WILL NOT 
GRANT ANYTHING. THAT IS AN 

09:36:16.578 --> 09:36:18.578
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS.

09:36:22.528 --> 09:36:27.167
TO DECIDE WHETHER TO HAVE AN 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. IT IS A 

09:36:27.388 --> 09:36:29.842
DECISION TO TRY TO FRUSTRATE 
THAT INQUIRY BY DENYING ALL 

09:36:29.985 --> 09:36:31.985
PRECIPITATION

09:36:37.981 --> 09:36:39.437
PARTICIPATION WITHOUT ASSERTING 
PRIVILEGES. PRIVILEGES MAY BE 

09:36:39.438 --> 09:36:41.438
ADJUDICATED IN COURT.

09:36:45.802 --> 09:36:49.238
IMPEACHMENT POWER CANNOT BE 
EXERCISED BY CONGRESS. IF 

09:36:49.458 --> 09:36:51.458
ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH IT

09:36:54.546 --> 09:36:57.307
AND ELIMINATES THE POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT. AS A CHECK ON THE 

09:36:57.527 --> 09:37:04.268
POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY. IT IS A
LARGE STEP TOWARD DICTATORSHIP. 

09:37:04.708 --> 09:37:08.978
THE THREAT OF IMPEACHMENT IS THE
ONLY THREAT. ON A PRESIDENT WHO

09:37:15.487 --> 09:37:17.397
DESERVES POWERS AND DESTROYS THE
SEPARATION OF POWERS. ESPECIALLY

09:37:17.398 --> 09:37:19.538
GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
POLICY. THAT THE SITTING 

09:37:19.758 --> 09:37:21.758
PRESIDENT CANNOT BE INDICTED.

09:37:31.709 --> 09:37:34.001
THAT LEAVES ONLY IMPEACHMENT AS 
A REMEDY AND IS A CHECK ON 

09:37:34.209 --> 09:37:36.333
PRESIDENTIAL POWER. IF YOU DON'T
WANT A DICTATORSHIP YOU HAVE TO 

09:37:36.538 --> 09:37:39.288
ALLOW CONGRESS TO EXERCISE THE 
POWER OF IMPEACHMENT. THIS MEANS

09:37:39.508 --> 09:37:42.667
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET THE 
DOCUMENTS WE DEMAND. MAY BE 

09:37:42.877 --> 09:37:48.638
SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRIVILEGES. 
THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE. INSTEAD 

09:37:48.840 --> 09:37:51.730
WHAT HAS BEEN ASSERTED AS OF THE
EXECUTIVE IS THE RIGHT TO 

09:37:51.877 --> 09:37:54.477
DETERMINE THAT THE IMPEACHMENT 
INCREASE IS INVALID.

09:37:58.849 --> 09:38:01.377
THIS IS AN ASSERTION OF 
TYRANNICAL POWER. WE MUST 

09:38:01.799 --> 09:38:09.557
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT ON THIS 
ARTICLE. TO GO ALONG WITH THIS 

09:38:09.702 --> 09:38:14.247
AMENDMENT AND GET RID OF ARTICLE
2. AN EFFECT THAT IS 

09:38:14.387 --> 09:38:16.387
PERMISSIBLE.

09:38:19.839 --> 09:38:21.969
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO DENY THE 
IMPEACHMENT POWER OF THE HOUSE 

09:38:22.177 --> 09:38:24.917
IS A LONG STEP AWAY FROM 
CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT, AND A

09:38:25.118 --> 09:38:27.881
LONG STEP AWAY FROM ANY CONTROL 
OVER THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT.

09:38:28.088 --> 09:38:31.656
I OPPOSE THE AMENDMENT. I YIELD 
BACK. 

09:38:31.657 --> 09:38:33.657
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN?

09:38:36.770 --> 09:38:39.298
&gt;&gt; I ASKED YOU IF YOU WOULD 
YIELD FOR ONE QUICK MINUTE. ONE 

09:38:39.517 --> 09:38:46.737
QUICK QUESTION ON THAT. YOU SAID
IT IS THE ONLY REMEDY. WHY IS 

09:38:46.947 --> 09:38:48.947
COURT AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY IN 
THIS CASE?

09:38:52.457 --> 09:38:57.547
&gt;&gt; WHAT MIGHT BE AN APPROPRIATE 
REMEDY IT'S A PRIVILEGE WE ARE 

09:38:57.770 --> 09:38:59.858
ASSERTING. I'M NOT WILLING TO 
SAY YOU COULD MOUNT AN 

09:39:00.627 --> 09:39:07.268
IMPEACHMENT BASED. NO PRIVILEGES
HAVE BEEN ASSERTED. THERE IS 

09:39:07.468 --> 09:39:09.803
NOTHING FOR THE COURT TO REVIEW.
ALL THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IS 

09:39:10.567 --> 09:39:12.567
THERE WILL

09:39:14.538 --> 09:39:17.087
-- HE HAS DIRECTED EVERYONE TO 
NOT PROVIDE A PIECE OF PAPER. DO

09:39:17.838 --> 09:39:21.577
NOT TESTIFY. THERE IS NOTHING 
FOR THE COURT TO REVIEW.

09:39:25.780 --> 09:39:27.780
HE IS SIMPLY ASSERTING THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION, THAT HE DOESN'T 

09:39:27.857 --> 09:39:29.857
RECOGNIZE THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
POWER.

09:39:32.802 --> 09:39:40.468
IT IS NOT HIS FUNCTION TO DO. 
&gt;&gt; IS IN THE NEXT STEP TO HOLD A

09:39:40.667 --> 09:39:44.992
WITNESS IN CONTEMPT FOR NOT 
PRODUCING DOCUMENTS OR NOT 

09:39:45.651 --> 09:39:47.881
APPEARING? 
&gt;&gt; IF A PRIVILEGE WERE ASSERTED,

09:39:48.026 --> 09:39:57.417
YES. IT HAS BE GONE BEYOND THAT.
THE ONLY REMEDY FOR A PRESIDENT

09:40:00.154 --> 09:40:02.457
WHO SAYS THE HOUSE DOES NOT HAVE
THE POWER TO DETERMINE IN 

09:40:02.677 --> 09:40:05.157
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS TO SAY 
THAT IS AN OBSTRUCTION OF 

09:40:05.297 --> 09:40:10.217
CONGRESS. 
&gt;&gt; MY TIME IS EXPIRED. I YIELD 

09:40:10.392 --> 09:40:13.939
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE

09:40:20.317 --> 09:40:21.376
-- 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZE. 

09:40:21.377 --> 09:40:23.377
&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THE GENTLEMAN 
OFFERING HIS AMENDMENT TO STRIKE

09:40:23.457 --> 09:40:29.035
THE SECOND ARTICLE. WHICH I 
THINK IS RIDICULOUS. AS THE 

09:40:29.247 --> 09:40:31.247
FIRST ARTICLE IN THIS CASE.

09:40:34.971 --> 09:40:36.666
OBSTRUCTION CHARGE REQUIRES A 
CONCERTED EFFORT TO INTERFERE 

09:40:36.667 --> 09:40:39.067
WITH OR IMPEDE A CONGRESSIONAL 
ELECTION. WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID

09:40:42.618 --> 09:40:45.117
ASSERTING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS
NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM 

09:40:45.338 --> 09:40:47.338
OBSTRUCTION. EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE
IS A TIME HONORED

09:40:52.157 --> 09:40:53.666
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT
OF EACH AND EVERY 

09:40:53.667 --> 09:40:55.546
ADMINISTRATION. IT'S BEEN 
ASSERTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY 

09:40:55.547 --> 09:40:57.869
ADMINISTRATION AFTER 
ADMINISTRATION. BOTH REPUBLICAN 

09:40:58.641 --> 09:41:00.641
AND DEMOCRATIC.

09:41:02.969 --> 09:41:04.686
WHEN CONGRESS DISAGREES WITH 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE THE REMEDY 

09:41:04.687 --> 09:41:08.737
IS NOT IMPEACHMENT. THE REMEDY 
IS TO GO TO COURT AND LET THE 

09:41:08.940 --> 09:41:10.940
THIRD BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

09:41:13.779 --> 09:41:15.915
DECIDE WHO IS CORRECT. THAT'S 
WHY WE HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES 

09:41:16.127 --> 09:41:20.987
IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE THREE 
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. IN THIS 

09:41:21.191 --> 09:41:23.971
CASE THE REMEDY IS TO GO TO THE 
COURT AND LET THE COURT DECIDE 

09:41:24.177 --> 09:41:26.177
IF THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
CONGRESS DISAGREE.

09:41:33.237 --> 09:41:35.608
EXCEPT THAT THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE DECIDED THEY DO NOT WANT TO

09:41:35.810 --> 09:41:38.157
WAIT FOR THE COURTS TO DECIDE. 
NOT WHEN THEY CAN IMPEACH THE 

09:41:38.381 --> 09:41:43.235
PRESIDENT. AND MAYBE DAMAGE HIM 
POLITICALLY. APPARENTLY THAT IS 

09:41:43.437 --> 09:41:45.802
NOT HAPPENING. I THINK THAT WAS 
THEIR GOAL. YOU WANT TO TALK 

09:41:46.000 --> 09:41:48.096
ABOUT ABUSE OF POWER, WHAT THE 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING HERE 

09:41:48.317 --> 09:41:53.417
IS A CLEAR CASE IN MY VIEW. THE 
MAJORITY SHOULD HOLD THEMSELVES 

09:41:54.197 --> 09:41:56.197
IN CONTEMPT.

09:41:59.412 --> 09:42:00.889
FOR CONDUCTING THIS ONE-SIDED 
BIAS IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION 

09:42:00.890 --> 09:42:02.768
AND THEN ATTACKING THE WHITE 
HOUSE FOR REFUSING TO 

09:42:02.769 --> 09:42:05.687
PARTICIPATE IN AN UNFAIR 
PROCESS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

09:42:05.889 --> 09:42:08.277
RECORD OF THIS PRESIDENT, THUS 
FAR

09:42:19.527 --> 09:42:21.627
, HE'S ONLY BEEN IN OFFICE THREE
YEARS. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE 

09:42:21.829 --> 09:42:23.556
QUITE CONSIDERABLE. IMPEACHING A
PRESIDENT THAT HAS ACCOMPLISHED 

09:42:23.557 --> 09:42:25.889
THESE THINGS IS ABSURD. LOOK AT 
THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW. WHY IS 

09:42:26.098 --> 09:42:28.627
THE ECONOMY DOING SO WELL? IT IS
TWO THINGS. THE TAX CUTS AND 

09:42:29.388 --> 09:42:32.853
JOBS ACT THAT THIS PRESIDENT 
PUSHED. AND WAS PASSED WHEN THE 

09:42:33.067 --> 09:42:36.877
PREVIOUS CONGRESS WAS IN 
CONTROL. THE DEMOCRATS KEPT 

09:42:37.097 --> 09:42:39.097
SCREAMING THESE ARE TAX CUTS.

09:42:42.831 --> 09:42:44.831
85% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE 
THEIR TAXES REDUCED. WEALTHY 

09:42:44.967 --> 09:42:50.837
PEOPLE GOT THEIR TAXES TAUGHT 
CUT. SO DID EVERYONE ELSE IN THE

09:42:50.977 --> 09:42:55.377
ECONOMY. THAT'S ONE OF THE 
PRINCIPAL REASONS WE ARE SEEING 

09:42:55.597 --> 09:42:57.597
THE ECONOMY CONTINUE TO GROW. 
THAT'S A REASON UNEMPLOYMENT IS 

09:42:57.677 --> 09:42:59.677
SO LOW RIGHT NOW.

09:43:05.577 --> 09:43:08.067
IT IS NOT JUST WEALTHY PEOPLE 
DOING WELL. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 

09:43:08.727 --> 09:43:12.872
DOING WELL IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
TAX CUTS. 85% OF THE PEOPLE GOT 

09:43:13.073 --> 09:43:15.073
THEIR TAX CUT.

09:43:19.606 --> 09:43:23.561
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT AN ALL-TIME 
LOW BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S 

09:43:23.707 --> 09:43:26.901
POLICIES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
CONGRESS.

09:43:40.160 --> 09:43:42.457
BACK WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE IN 
THE MAJORITY. I HAPPEN TO BE THE

09:43:42.668 --> 09:43:44.668
LEAD REPUBLICAN ON THE HOUSE 
SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE. I WAS 

09:43:44.801 --> 09:43:46.801
THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE LAST TWO 
YEARS. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 

09:43:46.917 --> 09:43:49.057
DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW. THEIR
CONFIDENCE IS AT AN ALL-TIME 

09:43:49.277 --> 09:43:51.597
HIGH. WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT 
SMALL BUSINESSES DO WELL? 70% OF

09:43:51.800 --> 09:43:54.987
THE NEW JOBS ARE CREATED BY 
SMALL BUSINESS FOLKS. ALL ACROSS

09:43:55.747 --> 09:44:04.151
THIS COUNTRY. THE OTHER THING, 
OTHER THAN TAXES BEING REDUCED 

09:44:04.565 --> 09:44:09.517
IS BECAUSE HE HAS REDUCED THE 
REDTAPE. THE BUREAUCRACY. THE 

09:44:09.741 --> 09:44:12.890
REGULATIONS THAT COME OUT OF 
WASHINGTON. HE SAID HIS GOAL WAS

09:44:13.090 --> 09:44:17.867
TO GET RID OF TWO EXISTING 
REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW.

09:44:21.928 --> 09:44:24.433
FOR EVERY NEW REGULATION COMING 
OUT OF WASHINGTON. THAT WAS A 

09:44:25.191 --> 09:44:27.217
TOUGH GOAL. THOSE TWO THINGS 
TOGETHER

09:44:30.991 --> 09:44:33.567
ARE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL REASONS
THIS ECONOMY IS GROWING SO WELL.

09:44:33.770 --> 09:44:36.967
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU 
COULD TALK ABOUT. ONE THAT WILL 

09:44:37.191 --> 09:44:45.656
ACTUALLY HAPPEN SOON IS 
IMPROVING NAFTA. USMCA. 

09:44:46.070 --> 09:44:50.305
HOPEFULLY THE DEMOCRATS WILL 
PASS THIS IN THE HOUSE. THEY 

09:44:50.517 --> 09:44:56.237
FACE THE CHALLENGE. IF THEY 
PASSED IT, THEN THE PRESIDENT 

09:44:56.457 --> 09:44:58.938
OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO GET 
CREDIT. HE HAS BEEN PUSHING 

09:44:59.077 --> 09:45:06.447
THIS. THEY ALSO ARE TRYING TO 
GET RID OF THE LABEL OF BEING A 

09:45:06.667 --> 09:45:10.477
DO-NOTHING CONGRESS SINCE THEY 
HAVE BEEN IN CONTROL NOW. THEY 

09:45:10.687 --> 09:45:13.177
WILL APPARENTLY IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT. AT THE SAME TIME PAY 

09:45:13.321 --> 09:45:17.218
US. IT UNFORTUNATELY TAKES 
IMPEACHING A PRESIDENT TO PASS 

09:45:17.358 --> 09:45:19.358
IT.

09:45:28.507 --> 09:45:30.507
&gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE

09:45:34.249 --> 09:45:36.307
-- 
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 

09:45:36.496 --> 09:45:38.496
WORD.

09:45:43.585 --> 09:45:45.585
I AM REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 
THE SUGGESTION THAT HAS BEEN 

09:45:45.697 --> 09:45:47.697
MADE SEVERAL TIMES TODAY. THAT 
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IS FOR 

09:45:47.843 --> 09:45:49.971
SALE. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION IN 
THE CONSTITUTION THAT ALLOWS A 

09:45:50.177 --> 09:45:52.477
PRESIDENT TO CHEAT IN AN 
ELECTION BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS 

09:45:53.237 --> 09:45:55.237
GOING WELL.

09:46:00.298 --> 09:46:02.437
MY OATH TO PROTECT AND DEFEND 
THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T FOR SALE.

09:46:02.657 --> 09:46:04.586
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OBSTRUCTION
AND ABUSE OF POWER AND 

09:46:04.587 --> 09:46:06.587
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS

09:46:12.387 --> 09:46:14.507
ARE NOT IMPEACHABLE NOTHING IS. 
ARTICLE 1 CHARGES TRUMP WITH THE

09:46:14.727 --> 09:46:16.727
ABUSE OF POWER FOR ATTEMPTING TO
UNDERMINE OUR ELECTIONS. THE 

09:46:16.839 --> 09:46:20.857
PRIMARY CHECK ON A PRESIDENT 
BECOMING A KING'S ELECTIONS. 

09:46:21.296 --> 09:46:23.296
THIS PRESIDENT ABUSED HIS POWERS
TO UNDERMINE OUR ELECTIONS. THAT

09:46:23.456 --> 09:46:27.307
IS ARTICLE 1. ARTICLE TO WHICH 
MY COLLEAGUE SUGGESTED

09:46:36.828 --> 09:46:38.546
WE SHOULD ABANDON. CHARGES 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH OBSTRUCTION

09:46:38.547 --> 09:46:40.547
OF CONGRESS FOR BLOCKING THE 
PRODUCTION OF ALL DOCUMENTS AND 

09:46:40.667 --> 09:46:42.156
WITNESSES SUBPOENAED BY CONGRESS
IN THE IMPEACHMENT 

09:46:42.157 --> 09:46:43.848
INVESTIGATION. CONGRESS'S POWER 
TO INVESTIGATE AND IMPEACH THE 

09:46:43.849 --> 09:46:45.849
PRESIDENT IS THE BACKSTOP

09:46:48.968 --> 09:46:50.889
TO ELECTIONS. TO PROTECT OUR 
GOVERNMENT. FROM BEING OVERRUN 

09:46:50.890 --> 09:46:53.137
BY A TYRANNICAL EXECUTIVE. THE 
PRESIDENT HAS UNDERMINED OUR 

09:46:53.281 --> 09:46:55.957
CONSTITUTION OBSTRUCTING 
CONGRESSES IMPEACHMENT POWER 

09:46:56.396 --> 09:46:58.396
WITHOUT A LEGAL BASIS.

09:47:02.609 --> 09:47:04.609
FOR OUR CONSTITUTION TO OPERATE 
PROPERLY IT DEPENDS UPON PEOPLE 

09:47:04.747 --> 09:47:09.798
OUT ACTING IN A REASONABLE 
MANNER. WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH 

09:47:10.017 --> 09:47:12.707
AN EXECUTIVE AT THIS POINT WHO 
IS ACTING ANY REASONABLE MANNER.

09:47:13.471 --> 09:47:20.717
OFTEN PEOPLE ASK LAWYERS CAN I 
SUE? IT IS AN OLD LAWYER JOKE. 

09:47:20.920 --> 09:47:22.920
OF COURSE YOU CAN SEE WHO

09:47:29.187 --> 09:47:31.557
. THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU WIN? 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE A 

09:47:31.759 --> 09:47:35.167
CAREER OUT OF SUING. KNOWING 
THAT HE HAD NO CHANCE TO WIN. HE

09:47:35.367 --> 09:47:37.367
HAS CLOGGED UP OUR COURTS. FOR 
DECADES. HE USUALLY LOSES 

09:47:38.009 --> 09:47:41.718
BECAUSE HE HASN'T A LEGAL LEG TO
STAND ON. THAT IS THE SITUATION 

09:47:41.920 --> 09:47:45.747
WE ARE IN NOW. HE HAS DEFIED 
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS WITHOUT 

09:47:45.947 --> 09:47:51.177
A LEGAL LEG TO STAND ON. HE 
HASN'T CLAIMED EXECUTIVE 

09:47:51.321 --> 09:47:53.321
PRIVILEGE

09:47:55.850 --> 09:47:57.968
TOUCHES SOMETHING THAT COULD GO 
TO THE COURTS. HE'S MADE UP 

09:47:58.177 --> 09:47:59.906
SOMETHING CALLED ABSOLUTE 
IMMUNITY. NEVER BEFORE IN THE 

09:47:59.907 --> 09:48:05.005
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAVE WE 
HAD A PRESIDENT WHO SAID YOU 

09:48:05.206 --> 09:48:07.587
CAN'T TALK TO ANYONE IN MY 
ADMINISTRATION. YOU CAN'T SEE 

09:48:08.361 --> 09:48:13.134
ANY DOCUMENTS. WHEN WE HAD HOPE 
HICKS COME BEFORE, THE 

09:48:13.887 --> 09:48:16.347
COMMUNICATION SECRETARY. COME 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SEVERAL 

09:48:17.117 --> 09:48:21.219
MONTHS AGO SHE WAS SUBJECT TO A 
CLAIM OF ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY. SHE 

09:48:21.428 --> 09:48:24.677
WASN'T ALLOWED TO TESTIFY TO 
ANYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED

09:48:28.216 --> 09:48:30.769
THAT SHE HAD SEEN THAT HAVE BEEN
DONE FROM THE MOMENT SHE WALKED 

09:48:30.969 --> 09:48:34.577
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE UNTIL SHE 
LEFT. SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TELL

09:48:34.778 --> 09:48:38.607
US WHERE HER OFFICE WAS THIS IS 
THE ABSOLUTE IRON CURTAIN THAT 

09:48:38.810 --> 09:48:42.547
THIS PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO 
PLACE BETWEEN HIS ADMINISTRATION

09:48:44.606 --> 09:48:49.251
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE 
IS NO WAY I WILL VOTE TO REMOVE 

09:48:49.467 --> 09:48:53.886
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS FROM 
THESE ARTICLES. I YIELD BACK. 

09:48:54.028 --> 09:48:56.028
&gt;&gt;

09:48:58.527 --> 09:49:00.527
THE JAN LADY YELLS BACK.

09:49:04.037 --> 09:49:06.037
WHAT PURPOSES MR. JORDAN?

09:49:10.460 --> 09:49:12.567
&gt;&gt; I SUPPORT THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
PENNSYLVANIA. HE SAID IN HIS 

09:49:12.770 --> 09:49:17.428
REMARKS THE REAL OBSTRUCTION 
CAME FROM CHAIRMAN SHIFT WHICH 

09:49:17.633 --> 09:49:21.677
IS SO TRUE. YOU THE FIRST VICTIM
WAS? THIS COMMITTEE. UNLESS YOU 

09:49:21.879 --> 09:49:28.187
RUN THE INTEL COMMITTEE YOU 
COULD NOT SET IN FOR THE 17 FACT

09:49:28.327 --> 09:49:30.327
WITNESSES.

09:49:34.697 --> 09:49:37.017
YOU COULD NOT BE A PART OF THOSE
DEPOSITIONS. SOME PEOPLE TRIED. 

09:49:37.237 --> 09:49:42.318
A GOOD FRIEND FROM FLORIDA TRIED
TO GET IN. THE FIRST VICTIM OF 

09:49:42.538 --> 09:49:44.736
THE REAL OBSTRUCTION TO GET TO 
ALL THE INFORMATION

09:49:48.297 --> 09:49:50.003
WAS THIS COMMITTEE. THE 
COMMITTEE CHARGED WITH WRITING 

09:49:50.004 --> 09:49:53.417
OF THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. 
MARKING THEM UP AS WE SPEAK. 

09:49:53.833 --> 09:49:56.217
WASN'T ALLOWED TO BE IN THERE 
FOR THE 17 WITNESSES.

09:49:59.719 --> 09:50:01.915
THE DEMOCRAT ROLES WERE WORSE. 
NO SUBPOENA POWER FOR 

09:50:02.057 --> 09:50:04.880
REPUBLICANS. DEPOSITIONS AS I 
SAID DONE IN SECRET IN THE 

09:50:05.103 --> 09:50:08.257
BUNKER OF THE BASEMENT OF THE 
CAPITAL. IN THOSE DEPOSITIONS 

09:50:08.687 --> 09:50:13.228
THESE WITNESSES WERE SUBPOENAED.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ANSWER OUR 

09:50:13.377 --> 09:50:15.377
QUESTIONS.

09:50:18.377 --> 09:50:20.377
ONLY THE DEMOCRATS GOT ALL OF 
THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED. THERE 

09:50:20.447 --> 09:50:25.825
WERE QUESTIONS THAT REPUBLICANS 
ASKED. DEMOCRATS DENIED 

09:50:26.247 --> 09:50:29.389
REPUBLICAN WITNESSES FOR THE 
OPENING HEARINGS. WE WERE 

09:50:29.589 --> 09:50:31.589
ALLOWED TO CALL THE WITNESSES 
THAT WE WANTED.

09:50:38.685 --> 09:50:41.737
WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO CALL OUR 
WITNESSES. THE ONE WITNESS THAT 

09:50:41.941 --> 09:50:48.363
WE WANTED TO CALL EVEN THOUGH 
ADAM SHIFT SAID WE DID NOT GET A

09:50:48.577 --> 09:50:53.217
CHANCE TO HEAR FROM HIM. WHEN 
THIS ALL HAPPENED IN SEPTEMBER. 

09:50:53.657 --> 09:50:58.627
ADAM SCHIFF TOLD US WE WILL GET 
A HEAR FROM THE WHISTLEBLOWER.

09:51:03.878 --> 09:51:05.596
THE WHISTLEBLOWER WITH NO 
FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE. WHO WAS 

09:51:05.597 --> 09:51:07.697
BIASED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND
WORKED WITH JOE BIDEN. HE THEN 

09:51:07.917 --> 09:51:10.790
CHANGED HIS MIND. WHAT CHANGE 
THE CHAIRMAN'S MIND? THE DAY 

09:51:10.935 --> 09:51:12.935
AFTER

09:51:14.697 --> 09:51:17.117
THE CALL THE WHISTLEBLOWER 
RIGHTS THIS MEMO. THE CALL

09:51:22.801 --> 09:51:24.920
WAS DESCRIBED AS CRAZY AND 
FRIGHTENING. HE WAITS 18 DAYS TO

09:51:25.127 --> 09:51:28.051
FILE HIS COMPLAINT. THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER GOES OFF AND SEES 

09:51:28.257 --> 09:51:30.835
ADAM SHIFT IN THAT TIMEFRAME. 
GETS MARCHING ORDERS FROM ADAM 

09:51:31.591 --> 09:51:33.591
SCHIFF STAFF.

09:51:41.667 --> 09:51:43.987
EVERYTHING CHANGES. WE DO NOT 
GET TO HEAR FROM HIM. WE DON'T 

09:51:44.187 --> 09:51:46.507
GET TO HEAR FROM THE PERSON. 
BECAUSE WE DON'T GET TO HEAR 

09:51:46.727 --> 09:51:50.511
FROM THE WHISTLEBLOWER, REMEMBER
THE COMPLAINT ON AUGUST 12. HE 

09:51:50.727 --> 09:51:53.086
SAYS THIS. OVER THE PAST FOUR 
MONTHS MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN 

09:51:53.307 --> 09:51:55.415
U.S. OFFICIALS INFORMED ME ABOUT
THIS EFFORT. WE HAVE NO IDEA. 

09:51:55.608 --> 09:51:58.387
THE COMMITTEE MARKING UP 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. WE HAVE

09:51:58.607 --> 09:52:03.217
NO IDEA WHO THOSE OFFICIALS ARE.
WE DO NOT KNOW IF WE TALK TO 

09:52:03.437 --> 09:52:06.418
THEM OR IF THEY CAME AND 
TESTIFIED. MY GUESS IS COLONEL 

09:52:06.637 --> 09:52:09.011
BITTMAN WAS ONE OF THEM. WHO 
KNOWS. WE DON'T KNOW.

09:52:12.772 --> 09:52:16.389
WE NEVER GOT TO TALK TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL WHO STARTED IT ALL. 

09:52:16.809 --> 09:52:19.727
THAT'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INTEL
COMMITTEE TOLD US WHEN IT ALL 

09:52:19.877 --> 09:52:22.570
STARTED. WHEN IT IS DISCOVERED 
THAT HAS STAFF I COMMUNICATED 

09:52:23.331 --> 09:52:27.677
WITH WHISTLEBLOWER NOPE, WE WILL
NOT GET TO. THE REAL VICTIM IS 

09:52:28.445 --> 09:52:32.687
THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAVE HAD FOUR
DEMOCRATIC WITNESSES IN FRONT OF

09:52:32.867 --> 09:52:34.867
US.

09:52:37.204 --> 09:52:41.038
ONE DEMOCRAT LAW PROFESSOR THAT 
THE REPUBLICANS CALLED IN. THOSE

09:52:41.237 --> 09:52:45.937
ARE THE FOUR WITNESSES AND A 
BUNCH OF STUFF. OF THE 17 

09:52:46.157 --> 09:52:48.216
WITNESSES. I SUPPORT THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA'S 

09:52:48.357 --> 09:52:50.357
AMENDMENT.

09:52:56.941 --> 09:53:01.086
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE 
ISLAND IS RECOGNIZED. 

09:53:01.087 --> 09:53:03.087
&gt;&gt;

09:53:05.849 --> 09:53:07.756
WE ARE CHARGED WITH THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING THE 

09:53:07.757 --> 09:53:11.979
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
IN THIS INVESTIGATION. APPLYING 

09:53:12.187 --> 09:53:14.867
THEM TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT WE
HAVE SWORN AND PROTECT AND 

09:53:15.017 --> 09:53:18.861
DEFEND. THIS SERIES OF EVENTS 
WAS DESCRIBED BY TRUMP OFFICIALS

09:53:20.238 --> 09:53:26.147
AND AMBASSADOR BOLTON IS A DRUG 
DEAL. IT WAS DESCRIBED BY FIONA 

09:53:26.369 --> 09:53:29.207
HILL AS A DOMESTIC POLITICAL 
ERRAND.

09:53:34.219 --> 09:53:38.687
260 TEXT MESSAGES AND THE 
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

09:53:39.457 --> 09:53:44.457
OWN WORDS. EMAILS BETWEEN 
HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS OF THE 

09:53:44.677 --> 09:53:46.707
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

09:53:46.858 --> 09:53:48.858
HIRED RUDY GIULIANI TO LEAD THIS
EFFORT.

09:53:53.377 --> 09:54:00.911
HE FIRED AMBASSADOR YVONNE 
ELITCH. THE PRESIDENT PUT A HOLD

09:54:01.119 --> 09:54:03.277
ON THE MILITARY AID TO THE 
UKRAINE. HE DEMANDED THAT 

09:54:04.047 --> 09:54:10.278
ZELENSKY  ANNOUNCE -- THE 
PRESIDENT PUT THE THREE AMIGOS 

09:54:10.437 --> 09:54:16.020
AND AMBASSADOR SOLD ONE SOMEONE 
IN CHARGE OF THE UKRAINE.

09:54:20.799 --> 09:54:27.390
THE PRESIDENT TOLD THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE,

09:54:27.609 --> 09:54:29.609
NOT TO ATTEND THE UKRAINE 
INAUGURATION.

09:54:35.999 --> 09:54:39.087
JUST TO NAME A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF
THE EVIDENCE. IF YOU DRILL DOWN 

09:54:39.237 --> 09:54:41.237
MORE I DON'T WANT TO

09:54:47.237 --> 09:54:49.096
DASHA TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE 

09:54:49.097 --> 09:54:53.567
OF THIS ACTIVITY. JULY 21, 2019 
THERE WAS A TEXT FROM AMBASSADOR

09:54:53.770 --> 09:54:55.770
TAYLOR TO AMBASSADOR SONLAND.

09:55:09.267 --> 09:55:11.267
DAVID HOLMES TESTIFIED. I WAS 
SURPRISED THE REQUIREMENT WAS SO

09:55:11.368 --> 09:55:13.368
SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE. THIS WAS 
A DEMAND THE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

09:55:14.027 --> 09:55:16.027
ZELENSKY 

09:55:19.219 --> 09:55:26.210
MR. HOLMES TESTIFIED IN RESPONSE
TO A QUESTION DURING -- YOUR 

09:55:26.427 --> 09:55:28.427
ACKNOWLEDGING MR. HOLMES.

09:55:33.003 --> 09:55:34.716
THE UKRAINE FELT PRESSURED TO 
UNDERTAKE THE INVESTIGATIONS. 

09:55:34.717 --> 09:55:36.970
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND RUDY 
GIULIANI AND OTHERS WERE 

09:55:37.107 --> 09:55:39.107
DEMANDING.

09:55:44.910 --> 09:55:47.217
ANSWER TO MR. HOLMES YES SIR. 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR HAS A CALL IN 

09:55:47.427 --> 09:55:49.577
SEPTEMBER 8. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
SAYS THIS IS A CAREER DIPLOMAT. 

09:55:49.780 --> 09:55:51.780
A VIETNAM WAR HERO. AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR SAYS

09:55:57.879 --> 09:55:59.578
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A 
BUSINESSMAN. WHAT A BUSINESSMAN 

09:55:59.579 --> 09:56:04.667
IS ABOUT TO SIGN A CHECK, THIS 
IS LIKE ASKING A PERSON TO PAY 

09:56:04.869 --> 09:56:10.807
UP BEFORE ASSIGNING A CHECK. 
THAT EXPLANATION MADE NO SENSE. 

09:56:11.240 --> 09:56:15.718
UKRAINIANS DO NOT OWE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ANYTHING. AND HOLDING UP 

09:56:15.924 --> 09:56:19.768
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR DOMESTIC
POLITICAL GAIN WAS CRAZY. 

09:56:20.177 --> 09:56:22.417
FINALLY ON SEPTEMBER 9 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR IN A TEXT 

09:56:22.557 --> 09:56:27.257
EXCHANGE WITH AMBASSADOR SONLAND
, I THINK IT'S CRAZY

09:56:31.207 --> 09:56:33.106
TO WITHHOLD SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
FOR HELP WITH THE POLITICAL 

09:56:33.107 --> 09:56:37.778
CAMPAIGN END QUOTE. THE RECORD 
IS FILLED WITH EVIDENCE. IN 

09:56:37.987 --> 09:56:41.780
FACT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES ABUSE THE ENORMOUS

09:56:41.985 --> 09:56:46.884
POWER OF HIS OFFICE IN AN EFFORT
TO CHEAT IN THE 2020 ELECTIONS.

09:56:53.446 --> 09:56:55.557
TO DRIVE FOR INTERFERENCE INTO 
THE 2020 ELECTION AND TO CORRUPT

09:56:55.760 --> 09:56:57.676
AND AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. AND USE THE POWER OF 

09:56:57.677 --> 09:56:59.851
HIS OFFICE WITH THE HELP OF 
TAXPAYER FUNDS. TO LEVERAGE HIS 

09:57:00.056 --> 09:57:04.477
EFFORT TO DRAG FOREIGN POWERS 
INTO OUR ELECTIONS. WHEN I HEAR 

09:57:04.696 --> 09:57:07.807
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE AISLE SAY WHO IS THE 

09:57:07.947 --> 09:57:09.947
VICTIM

09:57:18.437 --> 09:57:20.437
, THE VICTIM IS AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY. THE VICTIM IS THE 

09:57:20.596 --> 09:57:22.943
PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. WHO EXPECT 
US TO HONOR OUR OATH AND PROTECT

09:57:23.161 --> 09:57:25.047
AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION. ARE
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SAYING 

09:57:25.048 --> 09:57:28.200
IT IS OKAY FOR A PRESIDENT TO 
INVITE OR DRAG OR PERSUADE OR 

09:57:28.357 --> 09:57:30.738
COERCE FOREIGN POWERS TO DISTORT
AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL 

09:57:30.887 --> 09:57:32.887
ELECTION?

09:57:41.848 --> 09:57:44.181
WE HAVE MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE 
GIVEN OUR LIVES TO PROTECT OUR 

09:57:44.397 --> 09:57:47.167
DEMOCRACY. WE OWE IT TO THEM TO 
BE SURE YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE 

09:57:47.387 --> 09:57:49.387
WHO'S GOING TO BE THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 

09:57:49.516 --> 09:57:51.807
NOT SOME FOREIGN POWER. IF WE 
ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO GET AWAY 

09:57:52.018 --> 09:57:54.377
WITH THIS WE WILL OF LOST OUR 
DEMOCRACY AND WE WILL CONVEY 

09:57:54.597 --> 09:57:56.597
THAT TO FOREIGN POWERS. I URGE 
MY COLLEAGUES

09:58:01.497 --> 09:58:03.497
TO SUPPORT THESE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. SO WE CAN VINDICATE

09:58:03.627 --> 09:58:05.627
THE RIGHT OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN 

09:58:05.761 --> 09:58:07.008
FUTURE AND ELECT THEIR OWN 
LEADERS. 

09:58:07.009 --> 09:58:09.009
&gt;&gt; MADAM CHAIR?

09:58:13.799 --> 09:58:16.107
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO URGE SUPPORT FOR 

09:58:16.327 --> 09:58:19.407
THIS AMENDMENT STRIKING ARTICLE.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT SAID TODAY.

09:58:19.627 --> 09:58:23.840
AS EVERYONE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED. 
I'M STRUCK BY THE HYPERBOLIC 

09:58:24.042 --> 09:58:26.222
LANGUAGE THAT IS BEING USED ON 
THE OTHER SIDE.

09:58:32.018 --> 09:58:34.127
AND THIS BREATHLESS CHARGE WE 
HEAR ABOUT OVER AND OVER. THIS 

09:58:34.337 --> 09:58:36.866
IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY
OF THE PUBLIC THAT ANY PRESIDENT

09:58:37.087 --> 09:58:39.016
HAS INVOKED THIS KIND OF 
IMMUNITY AND PRIVILEGE OVER 

09:58:39.017 --> 09:58:41.017
SUBPOENAS FROM CONGRESS. IT IS 
SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

09:58:45.801 --> 09:58:48.106
A REVIEW OF THE HISTORY, EVEN A 
REVIEW OF THE WITNESS TESTIMONY 

09:58:48.310 --> 09:58:50.626
THAT WAS PRESENTED IN THIS VERY 
COMMITTEE A WEEK AGO. IT WAS 

09:58:50.828 --> 09:58:54.968
SURELY THAT IS A BASELESS 
CHARGE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A 

09:58:55.174 --> 09:58:57.174
SINGLE PARTY FRAUDULENT AND

09:58:59.801 --> 09:59:01.671
PEACH PROCESS DEPLOYED AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENT LIKE THE ONE 

09:59:01.672 --> 09:59:06.622
THAT'S BEING USED AGAINST DONALD
TRUMP. IT'S NOT THE CLAIM THAT 

09:59:06.825 --> 09:59:08.656
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT TO 
TURN OVER WITNESSES OR 

09:59:08.657 --> 09:59:10.657
DOCUMENTS. THAT AS WE SAID IS 
QUITE COMMON.

09:59:14.341 --> 09:59:16.574
BY THE WAY LET'S REMEMBER IT 
NEEDS TO BE NOTED AGAIN THAT 

09:59:16.776 --> 09:59:19.655
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CONSISTENTLY
COOPERATED WITH THIS CONGRESS 

09:59:20.056 --> 09:59:23.723
AND FULFILLING ITS OVERSIGHT AND
INVESTIGATION RESPONSIBILITIES. 

09:59:24.131 --> 09:59:26.131
THIS MORNING THERE WERE 25 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS THAT 

09:59:26.240 --> 09:59:30.783
TESTIFIED. OVER 20 HAD TESTIFIED
BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY 

09:59:30.921 --> 09:59:36.531
COMMITTEE. AT THE START OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. THE WHITE 

09:59:36.731 --> 09:59:42.047
HOUSE PRODUCED MORE THAN 100,000
PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. TO THE 

09:59:42.256 --> 09:59:44.440
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. IN SPITE OF
THEIR ALLEGATION THE DEMOCRATS 

09:59:44.584 --> 09:59:47.838
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A LAWFUL
COST TO CHALLENGE THE SUBPOENAS.

09:59:55.454 --> 09:59:56.468
THEY INVOLVE DIRECT 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN 

09:59:56.469 --> 09:59:58.293
HIGH-RANKING ADVISORS AND A 
PRESIDENT THAT IS VERY SENSITIVE

09:59:58.294 --> 10:00:02.582
STUFF. IT'S RECOGNIZED TO BE 
PRIVILEGED. WE NEED THE COURTS 

10:00:02.787 --> 10:00:06.663
TO SORT THROUGH THE NUANCES. 
MOST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE 

10:00:06.875 --> 10:00:09.025
NOT RELATED TO THE UKRAINE 
MATTER. ANY OBJECTIVE OBSERVER

10:00:28.425 --> 10:00:30.285
THE ADMINISTRATION IS BEING USED
BY THESE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE 

10:00:30.286 --> 10:00:31.977
CHAIRS. TO ADVANCE THEIR 
POLITICAL AGENDA. THIS AGENDA 

10:00:31.978 --> 10:00:34.579
DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TIME TO 
PROCEED TO DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY

10:00:34.778 --> 10:00:36.778
AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT 
IS HISTORIC. PROFESSOR TURLEY 

10:00:36.955 --> 10:00:39.575
WAS OUR ONLY WITNESS. THE ONLY 
ONE THAT WE WERE ALLOWED.

10:00:44.165 --> 10:00:46.275
IN THE EXCEPTIONAL TESTIMONY HE 
SUBMITTED TO US IN WRITING. HE 

10:00:47.037 --> 10:00:49.037
SAID QUOTE,

10:00:54.801 --> 10:00:57.385
THIS IS PAGE 42 OF HIS DOCUMENT.
IF THIS COMMITTEE ELECTS TO SEEK

10:00:57.587 --> 10:00:59.264
IMPEACHMENT ON THE PRESIDENTS 
FILLER TO YIELD THE 

10:00:59.265 --> 10:01:01.265
CONGRESSIONAL DEMANDS IT WILL 
HAVE TO DISTINGUISH A LONG LINE 

10:01:01.948 --> 10:01:03.948
OF CASES

10:01:08.798 --> 10:01:10.716
WHERE PRIOR PRESIDENTS SOUGHT 
THE VERY SAME REVIEW WHILE 

10:01:10.717 --> 10:01:12.703
WITHHOLDING WITNESSES AND 
DOCUMENTS. TAKE THE OBAMA 

10:01:12.704 --> 10:01:14.704
ADMINISTRATION

10:01:21.798 --> 10:01:23.798
ON THE INVESTIGATION OF FAST AND
FURIOUS. CONGRESS BEGAN AN 

10:01:23.894 --> 10:01:25.623
OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATION INTO 
THAT SCANDAL. SOME MEMBERS CALL 

10:01:25.624 --> 10:01:26.881
FOR IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA INVOKED 

10:01:26.882 --> 10:01:30.051
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGES. THIS IS 
NOT UNPRECEDENTED. PROFESSOR 

10:01:30.815 --> 10:01:32.815
TURLEY CONTINUES.

10:01:35.755 --> 10:01:38.075
THE POSITION WAS REGARDED AS 
EXTREME. SOME EVEN SAID EXTREME.

10:01:39.972 --> 10:01:42.594
RESIDENT OBAMA HAD EVERY RIGHT 
TO SEEK JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE 

10:01:42.755 --> 10:01:45.354
MATTER. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THAT 

10:01:45.494 --> 10:01:48.624
POSITION. ON THIS OBSTRUCTION 
THEORY

10:01:52.114 --> 10:01:55.514
WOULD BE AN ABUSE OF POWER BY 
CONGRESS. IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS 

10:01:55.938 --> 10:01:57.938
TO SET FOR FUTURE PRESIDENTS AND
CONGRESSES.

10:02:05.234 --> 10:02:07.384
HERE IS THE DEAL. IMPEACHMENT 
WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE A 

10:02:07.604 --> 10:02:09.694
REMEDY FOR POLITICAL 
DISAGREEMENTS. IT WASN'T 

10:02:09.911 --> 10:02:13.268
INTENDED TO BE A REMEDY FOR 
LEGAL DISAGREEMENTS. BETWEEN THE

10:02:13.484 --> 10:02:16.247
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THAT'S WHY 

10:02:16.453 --> 10:02:19.834
THERE IS A THIRD BRANCH OF 
GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A VERY 

10:02:20.593 --> 10:02:22.593
DANGEROUS ROAD.

10:02:24.738 --> 10:02:27.156
AS PROFESSOR TURLEY NOTED. I 
HOPE AND PRAY THAT FUTURE 

10:02:27.294 --> 10:02:31.246
CONGRESSES CAN AND WILL EXERCISE
GREATER RESTRAINT. IN WHAT HAS 

10:02:31.463 --> 10:02:33.463
BEEN SHOW BY SHERMAN SHIFT

10:02:38.835 --> 10:02:40.977
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF. THE CIVILITY OF
OUR REPUBLIC WILL DEPEND ON THAT

10:02:41.194 --> 10:02:45.977
IN THE FUTURE.  I PRAY WE CAN 
PUT THIS GENIE BACK IN THE 

10:02:46.124 --> 10:02:48.124
BOTTLE.

10:02:51.223 --> 10:02:53.223
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE THE 
GENTLEMAN

10:02:56.493 --> 10:02:59.193
FROM FLORIDA SEEKS RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 

10:02:59.338 --> 10:03:03.273
WORD. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S TRULY DISHEARTENING TO 

10:03:03.493 --> 10:03:06.253
HEAR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE ARGUE IN FAVOR OF CRIPPLING

10:03:06.473 --> 10:03:11.169
THE VERY INSTITUTION THEY ARE A 
PART OF. THE POWER OF 

10:03:11.383 --> 10:03:16.263
IMPEACHMENT HAS BILLED IN DUE 
PROCESS FOR PROTECTIONS. WE ARE 

10:03:16.483 --> 10:03:20.456
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DULY 
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. WE ARE 

10:03:20.613 --> 10:03:23.333
EMPOWERED TO HOLD TO ACCOUNT 
CORRUPT AND

10:03:27.562 --> 10:03:29.562
CRIMINAL PRESIDENTS. WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT OBSTRUCTS AND 

10:03:29.583 --> 10:03:31.805
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HE IS 
OBSTRUCTING THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

10:03:32.013 --> 10:03:36.433
A RIGHT TO KNOW OF THE PRESIDENT
IS RUNNING THEIR GOVERNMENT. 

10:03:36.873 --> 10:03:39.467
AFTER ALL THAT IS THE BASIS OF 
OUR GOVERNMENT. BY THE PEOPLE 

10:03:39.683 --> 10:03:43.953
AND FOR THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE 
REQUESTED HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS 

10:03:44.184 --> 10:03:46.553
AND HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY 
ABSOLUTELY

10:03:50.740 --> 10:03:52.993
NOT ONE DOCUMENT. THE PRESIDENT 
HAS INSTRUCTED THE SAFETY 

10:03:53.177 --> 10:03:56.443
DEPARTMENT TO NOT GIVE US THE 
INFORMATION WE HAVE ASKED. SHE 

10:03:56.663 --> 10:04:01.955
HAS TOLD WITNESSES TO COME IN 
FRONT OF CONGRESS TO TESTIFY. TO

10:04:02.164 --> 10:04:08.733
NOT COME AND TESTIFY. TALK ABOUT
A DANGEROUS PRESIDENT. THE 

10:04:08.936 --> 10:04:11.790
PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW HOW HE IS
USING THE OFFICE OF THE 

10:04:11.963 --> 10:04:13.963
PRESIDENCY.

10:04:16.372 --> 10:04:18.452
OF THE PEOPLE WHOM HE WAS 
ELECTED TO SERVE. THE PRESIDENT 

10:04:18.653 --> 10:04:22.723
HAS ABUSED HIS OFFICE AND IS 
USING THE POWER OF THE OFFICE TO

10:04:22.938 --> 10:04:25.892
HIDE THE EXTENT OF THAT ABUSE 
FROM THE PEOPLE. THAT IS ABUSE 

10:04:26.652 --> 10:04:31.393
OF POWER. THAT IS AN IMPEACHABLE
DEFENSE. I WANT TO END BY SAYING

10:04:31.602 --> 10:04:36.442
IT IS ALSO APPALLING THAT 
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS THE 

10:04:36.653 --> 10:04:38.827
PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY HAVE CONTINUOUSLY ATTACKED

10:04:40.471 --> 10:04:42.471
FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS.

10:04:45.112 --> 10:04:47.352
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 
MILITARY. OUR INTELLIGENCE 

10:04:47.536 --> 10:04:49.536
COMMUNITY.

10:04:54.412 --> 10:04:56.331
THOSE WHO PROTECT US EVERY DAY. 
UNDERMINING OUR NATIONAL 

10:04:56.332 --> 10:04:58.463
SECURITY. THEY ARE PATRIOTS AND 
THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH. 

10:04:58.672 --> 10:05:00.832
AFTER ALL WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. 
I YIELD BACK.

10:05:06.004 --> 10:05:08.004
&gt;&gt; I RISE IN SUPPORT.

10:05:11.773 --> 10:05:19.592
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SO SURREAL, AND IT 

10:05:19.795 --> 10:05:21.795
SEEMS WE HAVE COME TO A TIME

10:05:25.652 --> 10:05:27.963
WHERE RIGHT IS WRONG AND WRONG 
IS RIGHT AND BULLIES ARE THE 

10:05:28.172 --> 10:05:32.002
VICTIMS AND THE VICTIMS ARE 
CALLED BULLIES. FOR THREE YEARS 

10:05:32.975 --> 10:05:39.477
THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
HARASSED. HE HAS BEEN 

10:05:40.227 --> 10:05:44.506
ELECTRONICALLY SURVEILLED, SPIED
UPON US NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD CALL

10:05:44.646 --> 10:05:50.992
IT. ALLEGATIONS HAVE NEVER 
CEASED. THEY CONTINUE AND THEY 

10:05:51.193 --> 10:05:53.933
ARE CONTINUING TODAY. AT SOME 
POINT YOU WOULD THINK THAT 

10:05:54.149 --> 10:05:57.742
SOMEONE WOULD LOOK AT THE ABUSES
BY CONGRESS

10:06:02.248 --> 10:06:06.184
AND BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
AND FRIENDS OF OUR DEMOCRATS. BY

10:06:06.385 --> 10:06:08.468
THE FBI FRIENDS OF OUR DEMOCRATS
WHO HATED THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE 

10:06:08.615 --> 10:06:10.615
WAS NOTHING BUT A CANDIDATE.

10:06:15.343 --> 10:06:17.364
AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY WOULD SAY
THIS IS OUT-OF-CONTROL. WE NEED 

10:06:17.578 --> 10:06:20.776
TO STEP BACK AND SAY WAIT, THIS 
TRAIN IS OFF THE TRACKS. IT IS 

10:06:20.919 --> 10:06:26.509
TIME TO GET REASONABLE. WHAT HAS
GONE ON THE LAST THREE YEARS IS 

10:06:27.269 --> 10:06:31.868
NOT REASONABLE. THERE IS A 
DOCTRINE AND ATTORNEYS NO

10:06:35.455 --> 10:06:38.089
YOU WERE GOING TO TRY TO PURSUE 
SOME REMEDY YOU NEED TO HAVE 

10:06:38.841 --> 10:06:45.803
CLEAN HANDS. THE MAJORITY HAS 
BEEN SO ABUSIVE, SURE THIS 

10:06:46.004 --> 10:06:48.004
ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED

10:06:52.716 --> 10:06:54.133
TONS OF WITNESSES AFTER 
SUBPOENAS. SOME WITHOUT. 

10:06:54.134 --> 10:06:56.164
SOMETIMES IT WAS JUST 
NEGOTIATED. NORMALLY WHAT 

10:06:56.366 --> 10:07:00.434
HAPPENS IS SUBPOENA IS RECEIVED 
AND IT MEANS YOU ARE NOT GOING 

10:07:00.634 --> 10:07:05.717
TO BE ABLE TO USE AN AGENCY 
ATTORNEY EVEN THOUGH AN AGENCY 

10:07:05.930 --> 10:07:09.366
ATTORNEY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN.
EVEN THOUGH THE ONLY WAY THAT 

10:07:09.568 --> 10:07:13.432
THE WITNESS CAN APPEAR AND HAVE 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE PROPERLY 

10:07:13.633 --> 10:07:19.729
CLAIMED IS TO HAVE AN AGENCY OR 
DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY WITH THEM. 

10:07:20.131 --> 10:07:23.379
THAT'S WHEN THINGS GET 
NEGOTIATED AND GET WORKED OUT. 

10:07:23.793 --> 10:07:25.793
SOME OF OUR FRIENDS NOW

10:07:30.294 --> 10:07:35.965
THAT IF THEY ARE ABUSIVE ENOUGH 
WITH SUBPOENAS AND WITH LAW FAIR

10:07:37.141 --> 10:07:41.951
AND USING THE LAW AS A WEAPON 
YOU CAN RUN PEOPLE OUT OF 

10:07:42.171 --> 10:07:48.918
OFFICE. THEY SUCCESSFULLY DID 
THAT WITH SARAH PALIN, RYAN 

10:07:49.117 --> 10:07:54.605
ZINKE E, HE COULD NOT KEEP 
HIRING INDIVIDUAL LAWYERS. THIS 

10:07:54.804 --> 10:08:01.539
IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT HAS 
BEEN GOING ON. THIS WILL END UP,

10:08:01.742 --> 10:08:06.737
SINCE OUR FRIENDS ARE NOT BEING 
REASONABLE.

10:08:11.778 --> 10:08:13.778
WE ARE NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE 
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SO 

10:08:13.822 --> 10:08:15.822
AGENCY LAWYERS COULD CLAIM 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. EVEN THOUGH

10:08:17.080 --> 10:08:22.460
THE TARGET KEPT CHANGING. THEY 
DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD 

10:08:22.661 --> 10:08:25.765
COME AND TESTIFY ABOUT. THEY 
WERE BEING ACCUSED OF ALL KINDS 

10:08:25.981 --> 10:08:29.660
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IT HAS 
CHANGED EVEN IN THE LAST 48 

10:08:29.806 --> 10:08:34.695
HOURS. HOW DO YOU DEFEND YOUR 
SELF WHEN THE CHARGE KEEPS 

10:08:34.835 --> 10:08:41.862
CHANGING? THIS IS A STOLEN S 
COURT SYSTEM. YOU DO NOT GET TO 

10:08:42.292 --> 10:08:47.231
MEET AND CROSS-EXAMINE YOUR 
WITNESSES. IN FACT, WE WILL JUST

10:08:47.440 --> 10:08:52.490
HAVE SOME LAW PROFESSOR THAT IS 
PAID BY OUR FRIENDS. COME IN AND

10:08:52.690 --> 10:08:54.690
EXPLAIN

10:08:58.850 --> 10:09:01.187
WHAT THE WITNESSES PROBABLY SAID
OR DID SAY, OR WHAT IT IS. 

10:09:01.400 --> 10:09:03.400
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO HEAR.

10:09:08.221 --> 10:09:10.334
YOU WILL VOTE ON GUILTY OR 
INNOCENT OR IMPEACHMENT OR NOT. 

10:09:10.554 --> 10:09:12.554
WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING 
WITNESSES. BRING US THE CHANCE 

10:09:12.650 --> 10:09:15.009
TO VOTE AND WE WILL VOTE. IT IS 
AN OUTRAGE. THERE'S NOTHING 

10:09:15.230 --> 10:09:17.994
REASONABLE ABOUT WHAT HAS GONE 
ON. ESPECIALLY, IT IS SO IRONIC.

10:09:18.204 --> 10:09:21.740
THIS IS THE SAME WEEK AND THE 
CORRUPTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 

10:09:21.888 --> 10:09:23.888
JUSTICE HAS BEEN SHOWN

10:09:27.752 --> 10:09:29.752
. THERE IS NO SORROW OR APOLOGY.

10:09:34.510 --> 10:09:39.390
NO REMORSE WHATSOEVER BY THIS 
INCREDIBLE ABUSIVE SYSTEM. THE 

10:09:39.610 --> 10:09:41.610
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS IS

10:09:46.151 --> 10:09:48.370
BY PEOPLE IN CONGRESS. THE 
MINISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN 

10:09:48.510 --> 10:09:52.380
UNREASONABLE. THEY HAVE SEEN 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WHEN THIS 

10:09:52.534 --> 10:10:00.601
ABUSE OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
GETS PEOPLE IN A PERJURY TRAP. 

10:10:01.004 --> 10:10:04.350
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO GO ON. IF 
WE CAN GET YOU IN A GATED 

10:10:04.493 --> 10:10:08.430
TESTIFY WE CAN PROSECUTE YOU IF 
YOU MAKE A MISTAKE WHILE YOU ARE

10:10:08.650 --> 10:10:12.071
TESTIFYING. IT WAS VERY 
REASONABLE NOT TO COME ANSWER 

10:10:12.280 --> 10:10:14.730
THE SUBPOENAS WHEN YOU COULD NOT
HAVE AN AGENCY LAWYER. THERE ARE

10:10:14.875 --> 10:10:16.329
NO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OTHER 
SIDE.

10:10:16.330 --> 10:10:21.130
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt;

10:10:26.753 --> 10:10:28.753
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION WE HAVE SEEN A 

10:10:28.822 --> 10:10:32.054
STARK CONTRAST BETWEEN THE 
PATRIOTS WHO STOOD UP TO TELL 

10:10:32.269 --> 10:10:35.380
THE TRUTH AND THOSE WHO HAVE 
TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THE TRUTH.

10:10:35.520 --> 10:10:37.520
TONIGHT

10:10:42.060 --> 10:10:45.040
, TO THOSE PATRIOTS I WANT TO 
LIFT YOU UP. I WANT TO TELL YOU 

10:10:45.260 --> 10:10:48.450
THANK YOU. I AM IN AWE OF YOU. I
AM IN AWE OF YOUR COURAGE TO 

10:10:48.670 --> 10:10:50.548
UPHOLD YOUR OATH AT A GREAT 
PERSONAL SACRIFICE. AND 

10:10:50.549 --> 10:10:52.549
PROFESSIONAL COST. PATRIOTS LIKE
LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALEXANDER 

10:10:52.571 --> 10:10:57.394
LINDEMANN. PURPLE HEART 
RECIPIENT AND IRAQ WAR VETERAN. 

10:10:57.610 --> 10:11:02.590
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM TAYLOR. 
VIETNAM WAR VETERAN. MARIA 

10:11:02.766 --> 10:11:04.766
YOVANOVITCH

10:11:10.178 --> 10:11:12.108
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UKRAINE. WHO JOINED THE FOREIGN 

10:11:12.109 --> 10:11:14.881
SERVICE DURING THE REAGAN 
ADMINISTRATION. DR. FIONA HILL. 

10:11:15.307 --> 10:11:17.307
DR. FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND SENIOR DIRECTOR OF

10:11:17.420 --> 10:11:21.906
EUROPEAN RUSSIA ON THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL. SO MANY 

10:11:22.109 --> 10:11:26.753
OTHERS. MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER 
WITNESSES. THIS ADMINISTRATION 

10:11:26.959 --> 10:11:29.291
CONFIRM THE DETAILS OF THE 
WRONGDOING OF THE PRESIDENT. 

10:11:29.539 --> 10:11:31.539
THEY DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENT WHO 
REFLEXES

10:11:35.029 --> 10:11:37.069
REFLECTIVELY AND REPEATEDLY 
ABUSED HIS POWER FOR PERSONAL 

10:11:37.208 --> 10:11:42.229
GAIN. JEOPARDIZING OUR SECURITY 
AND OUR OWN DEMOCRACY. EACH 

10:11:42.449 --> 10:11:45.550
PATRIOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO LIVE
UP TO THEIR OATH. THEIR WORDS 

10:11:45.699 --> 10:11:47.699
MATTERED.

10:11:49.489 --> 10:11:51.388
PATRIOTS, MY FAMILY KNOW 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SACRIFICE OF

10:11:51.389 --> 10:11:53.729
SERVICE. TWO AND MY BROTHER 
SERVED IN THE NAVY DURING THE 

10:11:53.951 --> 10:11:55.951
VIETNAM WAR. MY MOTHER

10:11:59.259 --> 10:12:04.589
BROTHER BOB SERVING TWO TOURS. 
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE SERVED WITH 

10:12:04.792 --> 10:12:08.619
THOSE WHO SERVED ON MY OWN 
STAFF. ONE THE TENANT WAS 

10:12:08.820 --> 10:12:11.823
RECENTLY CALLED TO SERVICE TO 
ACTIVE DUTY. AND STAFFERS TIM 

10:12:12.029 --> 10:12:17.379
KAINE AND DAVE CAR AGAIN. NOW AS
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IT IS OUR 

10:12:17.579 --> 10:12:22.689
TURN TO STAND UP. DR. KING ONCE 
SAID THE ULTIMATE MEASURE OF A 

10:12:22.899 --> 10:12:27.359
MAN IS NOT WHERE HE STANDS IN 
MOMENTS OF COMFORT AND 

10:12:27.579 --> 10:12:29.579
CONVENIENCE. IT'S WHERE HE 
STANDS AT TIMES OF CHALLENGE. 

10:12:30.038 --> 10:12:34.499
AND CONTROVERSY. THIS IS A TIME 
OF GREAT CHALLENGE. SOME OF MY 

10:12:34.669 --> 10:12:39.259
COLLEAGUES DO NOT WANT TO FACE 
THE REALITIES OF A PRESIDENTS 

10:12:39.459 --> 10:12:42.419
WRONGDOING. SO I ASKED MY 
COLLEAGUES TONIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU

10:12:43.189 --> 10:12:45.189
AFRAID OF?

10:12:48.842 --> 10:12:51.378
THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT BY THOSE 
WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO STAND UP

10:12:51.589 --> 10:12:53.589
AGAINST KING GEORGE. WE ARE 
CALLED TO STAND UP AGAINST 

10:12:53.739 --> 10:12:59.870
DONALD JAY TRUMP. WHAT ARE YOU 
AFRAID OF? LOOK TO OUR FRAMERS. 

10:13:00.298 --> 10:13:02.298
LOOK TO OUR PATRIOTS FOR 
COURAGE.

10:13:06.849 --> 10:13:08.971
THIS IS ABOUT COURAGE. THE 
COURAGE TO HONOR OUR OATH. MY 

10:13:09.178 --> 10:13:11.178
OATH, YOUR OATH, MR. CHAIRMAN

10:13:21.276 --> 10:13:23.276
I WILL WITH SOMBERNESS OF 
PURPOSE YET WITH CONFIDENCE IN 

10:13:23.409 --> 10:13:25.739
OUR CONSTITUTION BE VOTING NO ON
THIS AMENDMENT AND VOTING YES ON

10:13:25.959 --> 10:13:28.369
THESE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. 
WITH THAT I YIELD BACK. 

10:13:28.370 --> 10:13:37.499
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSES? 
&gt;&gt; I SUPPORT

10:13:39.489 --> 10:13:41.489
THE AMENDMENT.

10:13:47.198 --> 10:13:49.198
I OFFER THIS TO YOU. CHARGING 
THE PRESIDENT WITH OBSTRUCTION 

10:13:49.336 --> 10:13:51.336
OF CONGRESS IS UNPRECEDENTED. IN
ITSELF

10:13:56.962 --> 10:13:58.841
IT THREATENS OUR SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT. THE PRINCIPLES OF 

10:13:58.842 --> 10:14:00.842
SEPARATION OF POWERS AND CHECKS 
AND BALANCES TO MANNED A 

10:14:00.978 --> 10:14:03.688
PRESIDENT BE PERMITTED TO RESIST
A MAN THAT THE PRESIDENT FINDS 

10:14:03.905 --> 10:14:05.844
HARASSING OR OTHERWISE VIOLATIVE
OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 

10:14:05.845 --> 10:14:07.938
PRIVILEGES. IT IS AN ABSURDITY 
TO CLAIM

10:14:12.589 --> 10:14:14.512
THAT THE SOLE POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT IMPLIES DUTIES TO 

10:14:14.513 --> 10:14:17.378
THE PRESIDENT TO COOPERATE IN 
ANY AND ALL CONGRESSIONAL 

10:14:17.589 --> 10:14:22.178
REQUESTS. NO MATTER THEIR MERIT.
DISPUTES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES 

10:14:22.395 --> 10:14:24.971
ARE ACTUALLY A FEATURE. THEY ARE
A FEATURE OF OUR SYSTEM.

10:14:33.401 --> 10:14:35.499
THEY ARE NOT A BUG IN THE 
SYSTEM. THE BRANCHES ARE 

10:14:35.709 --> 10:14:37.870
REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN A PROCESS 
OF ACCOMMODATION. TO REACH AN 

10:14:38.078 --> 10:14:39.971
AGREEMENT THAT TAKES INTO 
ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE EQUITIES OF

10:14:39.972 --> 10:14:42.367
BOTH SIDES. BOTH BRANCHES HAVE 
RIGHTS AND INTEREST TO PROTECT.

10:14:48.890 --> 10:14:51.010
IF THOSE DISPUTES CANNOT BE 
RESOLVED THE COURTS ARE TO STEP 

10:14:51.229 --> 10:14:53.229
IN. ANYTHING LESS THREATENS THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS. IT'S THE 

10:14:53.352 --> 10:14:55.044
VERY FOUNDATION OF THIS 
CONSTITUTION. THIS MAJORITY HAS 

10:14:55.045 --> 10:15:00.169
TAKEN THE POSITION, A DUBIOUS 
POSITION, THAT DESPITE THEIR 

10:15:00.588 --> 10:15:02.588
VOTE OF A FULL HOUSE IS NOT 
REQUIRED

10:15:06.317 --> 10:15:07.990
TO OPEN AN IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDING. THINK OF THE 

10:15:07.991 --> 10:15:10.858
IMPLICATION OF THAT. ANY ROAD 
CHAIRMAN CAN COMMIT AN 

10:15:11.048 --> 10:15:13.048
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENT.

10:15:21.802 --> 10:15:23.802
UNDER THE THEORY OF THESE 
ARTICLES THE PRESIDENT HAS NO 

10:15:23.908 --> 10:15:25.908
CHOICE BUT TO COMPLY WITH A 
SINGLE ROAD COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. 

10:15:26.012 --> 10:15:30.002
HIS FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD BE 
IMPEACHABLE. HOW DOES THAT WITH 

10:15:30.208 --> 10:15:34.002
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS? THOU 
SHALL NOT BE ARTIFICIALLY ABLE 

10:15:34.141 --> 10:15:36.141
TO

10:15:39.176 --> 10:15:40.676
CREATE IMPEACHABLE DEFENSE 
THROUGH ITS OWN ACTIONS. 

10:15:40.677 --> 10:15:45.091
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACTIONS ARE 
NOT UNPRECEDENTED. ANY 

10:15:45.308 --> 10:15:46.608
PRESIDENTS HAVE TO FIGHT 
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS 

10:15:46.609 --> 10:15:48.609
INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA ON 
MANY OCCASIONS.

10:15:54.051 --> 10:15:55.738
MAYBE PRESIDENTS HAVE OUTRIGHT 
REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH 

10:15:55.739 --> 10:15:57.941
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AS 
WELL. I WILL GIVE YOU THREE 

10:15:58.084 --> 10:16:01.309
HISTORICAL CASES THAT ARE NOT 
ARTIFACTS. THEIR ACTUAL CASES.

10:16:09.518 --> 10:16:11.638
FOR INSTANCE PRESIDENT JACKSON 
SAID IN 1837, HE CALLED A HOUSE 

10:16:11.839 --> 10:16:13.978
SUBPOENA ILLEGAL AND 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. STATING HE 

10:16:14.198 --> 10:16:19.868
WOULD REPEL ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS AS
AN INVASION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF 

10:16:20.088 --> 10:16:24.178
JUSTICE. AS WELL AS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. HIS SACRED DUTY TO

10:16:24.398 --> 10:16:26.973
THE PEOPLE THE UNITED STATES TO 
RESIST THEM AS HE WOULD.

10:16:36.628 --> 10:16:38.628
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPANISH
ACQUISITION. THAT IS FROM ANDREW

10:16:38.750 --> 10:16:40.627
JACKSON. LATER PRESIDENT 
COOLIDGE SAID IN THE NEW YORK 

10:16:40.628 --> 10:16:42.968
TIMES ARTICLE FROM APRIL 24, 
THAT HE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE 

10:16:43.188 --> 10:16:45.188
SENATE SAYING HE WOULD CEASE TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THEIR UNWARRANTED

10:16:45.328 --> 10:16:47.307
INTRUSION. AND QUESTIONING THE 
LEGITIMACY OF THEIR 

10:16:47.308 --> 10:16:51.308
INVESTIGATION. IN 1948 PRESIDENT
TRUMAN AND EXECUTIVE PUBLISH 

10:16:51.528 --> 10:16:54.299
EXECUTIVE ORDER IN THE FEDERAL 
REGISTER ORDERING EXECUTIVE 

10:16:54.508 --> 10:16:57.978
DEPARTMENTS TO RESPECTFULLY 
DECLINE ANY SUBPOENA PERTAINING 

10:16:58.180 --> 10:17:00.971
TO CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION 
INTO EXECUTIVE BRANCH PERSONNEL.

10:17:04.178 --> 10:17:12.478
WE HAVE THE RECENT OBAMA 
EXAMPLE. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, 

10:17:12.696 --> 10:17:14.696
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY

10:17:19.930 --> 10:17:22.024
, THE CHAIRMAN SAID HE DID NOT 
EXERT PRIVILEGE. ACTUALLY HE 

10:17:22.228 --> 10:17:24.238
CLAIMED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN A
VERY BROAD WAY.

10:17:28.008 --> 10:17:30.338
TYPICALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS I
WOULD ISSUE A SUBPOENA AND HAVE 

10:17:31.107 --> 10:17:36.908
IT SERVED. THE PERSON DOES NOT 
SHOW UP. GUESS WHAT WE DO? WE GO

10:17:37.567 --> 10:17:41.598
INTO COURT. WE PROVE THE 
PROVIDENCE OF OUR SUBPOENA. THE 

10:17:41.801 --> 10:17:45.399
COURT THEN ISSUES AN ADDITIONAL 
ORDER. MAYBE IT IS A WARRANT FOR

10:17:45.599 --> 10:17:47.599
ARREST. MAYBE IT'S A FINE.

10:17:51.088 --> 10:17:53.088
WE UNVEIL OURSELVES THROUGH THE 
PROCESS. YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT. 

10:17:53.228 --> 10:17:58.770
MR. SCHIFF SAID SO JUST LAST 
WEEK. BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO

10:17:58.978 --> 10:18:04.867
TAKE THE TIME TO UNVEIL HIMSELF 
OF THE PROCESS THAT YOU CLAIM 

10:18:05.080 --> 10:18:11.847
YOU ARE DEFENDING. THAT IS 
PRECISELY WHY PROFESSOR TURLEY 

10:18:12.068 --> 10:18:17.437
AND ALL WHO LOOK AT THIS WITH 
THE OBJECTIVE I SAY YOU ARE THE 

10:18:17.657 --> 10:18:20.277
ONES ABUSING THE PROCESS. YOU 
ARE ABUSING CONGRESS

10:18:24.493 --> 10:18:26.493
AND ABUSING THE PRESIDENT AND 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. I'M AFRAID

10:18:26.627 --> 10:18:30.637
WHAT HAPPENS IS WE ACTUALLY 
INTEGRATE OUR BODY AND WE 

10:18:30.839 --> 10:18:34.328
INTEGRATE THE VERY PROCESS THAT 
WE CLAIM TO BE PROTECTING TODAY.

10:18:35.567 --> 10:18:40.937
WITH THAT I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MISS ESCOBAR'S RECOGNITION.

10:18:44.749 --> 10:18:50.046
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE HEARD OUR COLLEAGUES 
ARGUE THAT OBSTRUCTION OF 

10:18:50.257 --> 10:18:52.257
CONGRESS HAS NOT HAPPENED.

10:18:54.957 --> 10:18:56.957
ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES CALLED THE
CHARGE RIDICULOUS. ANOTHER 

10:18:57.437 --> 10:19:00.427
COLLEAGUE SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS
CONSISTENTLY COOPERATED WITH 

10:19:00.567 --> 10:19:02.909
DEMOCRATS. A STUNNING STATEMENT.

10:19:08.447 --> 10:19:10.447
I HAVE HAD THE INCREDIBLE 
PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON THE 

10:19:10.600 --> 10:19:13.071
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR 
ALMOST A YEAR. FRESHMAN WERE 

10:19:13.288 --> 10:19:18.027
SWORN IN JANUARY 3. WE HAVE HAD 
MANY HEARINGS. THERE IS A THREAD

10:19:22.437 --> 10:19:24.387
THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL OF THOSE 
HEARINGS. ESPECIALLY THOSE 

10:19:24.388 --> 10:19:28.847
HEARINGS WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO 
PROVIDE PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER 

10:19:29.067 --> 10:19:31.718
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. THAT THREAD IS THAT

10:19:35.950 --> 10:19:37.950
MY COLLEAGUES COMPLAINED 
BITTERLY. ABOUT OUR EFFORTS

10:19:44.427 --> 10:19:46.749
TO BE IN CHECK. OUR EFFORTS TO 
PERFORM OUR OBLIGATION TO THE 

10:19:46.949 --> 10:19:48.949
CONSTITUTION. AND OUR EFFORTS TO
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. WE HEAR IT 

10:19:49.080 --> 10:19:53.440
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THIS IDEA 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

10:19:53.597 --> 10:19:59.266
COOPERATED, THAT IS THE CLAIM 
THAT IS ACTUALLY ABSURD. DURING 

10:19:59.468 --> 10:20:03.946
SOME OF OUR OVERSIGHT HEARINGS 
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY HE 

10:20:04.147 --> 10:20:07.780
WAS COVERED UNDER ABSOLUTE 
IMMUNITY. WITHOUT LISTING

10:20:11.307 --> 10:20:17.906
THE DOCUMENTS OR THE REASONS WHY
HE DESERVED ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY. 

10:20:18.347 --> 10:20:22.597
NO PRESIDENT, NOT EVEN RICHARD 
NIXON, NO PRESIDENT HAS REFUSED 

10:20:23.001 --> 10:20:27.740
TO HONOR SUBPOENAS DURING 
IMPEACHMENT. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE

10:20:32.087 --> 10:20:34.429
, THIS PRESIDENT HAS ACHIEVED A 
NEW LOW. AND LOWER THE BAR 

10:20:34.650 --> 10:20:38.020
SIGNIFICANTLY. IF IT WERE NOT 
FOR THE PATRIOTS, AND I 

10:20:38.783 --> 10:20:40.783
ASSOCIATE MYSELF

10:20:42.963 --> 10:20:44.880
WITH THE STATEMENT BY 
REPRESENTATIVE DEAN. WHO THANKED

10:20:44.881 --> 10:20:51.213
THEM, THEY ARE HEROES. THEY PUT 
THEIR REPUTATION, THEIR NAMES 

10:20:51.417 --> 10:20:54.417
AND THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR 
SECURITY AT RISK. SO THEY COULD 

10:20:54.637 --> 10:21:00.147
DEFEND THIS COUNTRY AND DEFEND 
THE CONSTITUTION AND UPHOLD THE 

10:21:00.367 --> 10:21:05.024
OATH OF OFFICE. THE OATH THAT 
THEY TOOK AS PUBLIC SERVICE. 

10:21:05.237 --> 10:21:07.691
LET'S FIND OUT JUST HOW 
COOPERATIVE THIS PRESIDENT HAS 

10:21:07.847 --> 10:21:12.277
BEEN DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

10:21:17.974 --> 10:21:19.866
REPRESENTATIVE'S WALL WELL AND 
MY COLLEAGUE WHO SERVES ON 

10:21:19.867 --> 10:21:21.867
INTELLIGENCE. HOW MANY DOCUMENTS
DID YOU ALL REQUEST DURING THIS 

10:21:22.001 --> 10:21:24.001
INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; 71.

10:21:34.750 --> 10:21:36.877
&gt;&gt; ON PAGES 30 AND 31 IT WAS 71 
DOCUMENTS. 

10:21:36.878 --> 10:21:39.002
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY WITNESSES? 
&gt;&gt; 12 WITNESSES WE ASKED TO SHOW

10:21:39.761 --> 10:21:41.761
UP. 
&gt;&gt;

10:21:47.969 --> 10:21:49.666
SO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
UNDERSTANDS YOU REQUESTED 72 

10:21:49.667 --> 10:21:51.667
DOCUMENTS AND 12 WITNESSES. HOW 
MANY DOCUMENTS AND HOW MANY 

10:21:51.824 --> 10:21:52.907
WITNESSES DID THE PRESIDENT 
PROVIDE? 

10:21:52.908 --> 10:21:59.516
&gt;&gt; 12 WERE ASKED. ZERO OF THE 71
DOCUMENTS WERE PROVIDED. 

10:21:59.517 --> 10:22:04.407
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO 
ASK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT IS 

10:22:04.627 --> 10:22:10.167
THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO HIDE 
FROM YOU? WHY IS HE TRYING TO 

10:22:10.386 --> 10:22:13.137
KEEP YOU IN THE DARK? IF HE HAS 
NOTHING TO HIDE, THEN LET HIM 

10:22:13.357 --> 10:22:15.357
COME FORWARD WITH THOSE 
DOCUMENTS AND THOSE WITNESSES.

10:22:20.576 --> 10:22:22.707
I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY JUST 
TOUCHING A LITTLE BIT ON 

10:22:22.913 --> 10:22:25.717
SOMETHING I MENTIONED LAST 
NIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE 

10:22:25.927 --> 10:22:28.347
COME TO EXPECT THIS KIND OF 
BEHAVIOR FROM THE PRESIDENT.

10:22:32.697 --> 10:22:34.828
THIS REALLY IS A VERY TRAGIC 
MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. A 

10:22:35.046 --> 10:22:37.726
DARK MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
IT'S MADE EVEN MORE TRAGIC BY 

10:22:37.867 --> 10:22:42.908
ENABLERS. WHO SEEK TO MAKE SURE 
THEY PROTECT ONE MAN AT ANY 

10:22:43.117 --> 10:22:50.077
COST. ONE MAN WHO IS NOT FOR 
AMERICA. ONE MAN WHO IS FOR 

10:22:50.217 --> 10:22:56.989
HIMSELF. THIS IS A RECKONING FOR
US. THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN WE 

10:22:57.196 --> 10:23:00.667
SHOULD BE STANDING WITH THE 
PATRIOTS. I AM VERY PROUD

10:23:06.588 --> 10:23:09.317
AS DARK AS THIS MOMENT IS. I AM 
PROUD TO STAND WITH THE PATRIOTS

10:23:09.537 --> 10:23:15.229
HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE. I WILL 
CONTINUE TO STAND WITH THE 

10:23:15.447 --> 10:23:17.356
PATRIOTS WHO DEFEND THIS 
COUNTRY. MR. CHAIRMAN I YIELD 

10:23:17.357 --> 10:23:19.357
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSES

10:23:26.069 --> 10:23:28.069
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED.

10:23:31.171 --> 10:23:33.497
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TALKED TODAY ABOUT 
THE LACK OF EVIDENCE AND SUPPORT

10:23:33.716 --> 10:23:37.696
OF THE FIRST ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THE ABUSE OF POWER 

10:23:37.844 --> 10:23:39.844
ARTICLE.

10:23:42.517 --> 10:23:44.517
THEY CAN'T PROVE BRIBERY OR 
EXTORTION.

10:23:51.316 --> 10:23:53.596
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE ELEMENTS 
TO PROVE ANY CRIME THEY CREATED 

10:23:53.798 --> 10:23:55.798
ONE. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO 
HIGHER CRIME.

10:24:03.792 --> 10:24:05.792
THERE ARE HIGHER CRIMES. THERE 
ARE ACTUAL CRIMES. SINCE THE 

10:24:05.898 --> 10:24:08.019
PRESIDENT DID NOT COMMIT ONE 
HERE WE ARE. LAUGHABLE IF IT 

10:24:08.226 --> 10:24:10.946
WEREN'T SO SAD. THE SAME FOR 
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATED 

10:24:11.086 --> 10:24:13.086
THROUGHOUT.

10:24:19.277 --> 10:24:21.196
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY SAID THERE WAS NO 

10:24:21.197 --> 10:24:23.326
PRESSURE ON THE CALL. THERE WAS 
NO CONDITIONALITY OF AID. THE 

10:24:23.546 --> 10:24:25.690
UKRAINIANS WERE NOT AWARE THAT 
THE AIDE WAS WITHHELD WHEN THE 

10:24:25.903 --> 10:24:27.903
PRESIDENT SPOKE. AND WE HAVE THE
TIME MAGAZINE ARTICLE INVOLVING 

10:24:28.206 --> 10:24:30.356
-- WHICH HASN'T BEEN PURSUED BY 
THE COMMITTEE. UKRAINE DID NOT 

10:24:30.567 --> 10:24:32.567
OPEN AN INVESTIGATION BUT STILL 
RECEIVE THE AID. MY COLLEAGUE 

10:24:32.707 --> 10:24:35.616
SAID EARLIER WE CAN'T PROVE ANY 
OF IT. WE WILL ACCUSE HIM OF ALL

10:24:35.819 --> 10:24:39.038
OF IT AND CALL HIM AND ABUSE OF 
POWER. WE HAVE AN ARTICLE 

10:24:39.446 --> 10:24:41.446
CHARGING OBSTRUCTION OF 
CONGRESS.

10:24:51.958 --> 10:24:53.665
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALLEGED THE 
PRESIDENT DIRECTED THE 

10:24:53.666 --> 10:24:54.939
UNPRECEDENTED CATEGORICAL AND 
INDISCRIMINATE DEFIANCE OF 

10:24:54.940 --> 10:24:56.940
SUBPOENAS ISSUED BY THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES. THE FACTS DON'T

10:24:57.039 --> 10:25:00.068
MATCH UP WITH THESE CLAIMS. THE 
PRESIDENT HAS LEGITIMATE 

10:25:00.290 --> 10:25:01.774
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGES. THE 
COURT SHOULD DETERMINE THE 

10:25:01.775 --> 10:25:06.858
BOUNDARIES OF THESE PRIVILEGES. 
WHITE HOUSE RELEASED TO CALL 

10:25:07.078 --> 10:25:09.078
TRANSCRIPTS FOR THE PUBLIC FOR 
REVIEW DURING THIS PROCESS. THE 

10:25:09.225 --> 10:25:11.225
PRESIDENT TOLD HIM GO TELL THE 
TRUTH.

10:25:15.256 --> 10:25:19.507
IN ADDITION THE CLAIMS OF 
INSTRUCTION IGNORE THE 

10:25:19.714 --> 10:25:22.898
APPROPRIATE ROLE OF THE THIRD 
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. TO REVIEW 

10:25:23.305 --> 10:25:27.397
CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE 
AND CONGRESS. THE MAJORITY, 

10:25:27.616 --> 10:25:29.616
FAILING TO YIELD THEIR DEMANDS.

10:25:36.536 --> 10:25:38.194
FAILS TO DISTINGUISH INSTANCES 
WHERE PRIOR PRESIDENTS SOUGHT 

10:25:38.195 --> 10:25:40.226
THE VERY SAME REVIEW. WHILE 
WITHHOLDING TESTIMONY AND 

10:25:40.366 --> 10:25:42.366
DOCUMENTS.

10:25:50.129 --> 10:25:52.129
TO IGNORE INSTANCES WHERE THE 
TWO BRANCHES NEGOTIATED IN GOOD 

10:25:52.214 --> 10:25:54.214
FAITH. OVER THERE RETURN OF 
DOCUMENTS. AFTER THE FAILURE OF 

10:25:54.346 --> 10:25:56.456
THE MAJORITY TO NEGOTIATE IN 
GOOD FAITH OVER THE RULES FOR 

10:25:56.676 --> 10:25:58.676
THIS VERY IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING
WHY WOULD WE THINK THAT THERE 

10:25:58.768 --> 10:26:00.768
WOULD BE AN EFFORT BY THE 
PRESIDENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND 

10:26:00.886 --> 10:26:04.076
WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE 
THE DISPUTE. BETTER AND THEIR 

10:26:04.286 --> 10:26:06.436
MINDS TO WAIT FOR THE RECOURSE. 
THEY ARE RIGHT.

10:26:12.347 --> 10:26:14.019
PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE FAST 
AND FURIOUS INVESTIGATION 

10:26:14.020 --> 10:26:16.020
INVOKED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 
BARRED

10:26:20.821 --> 10:26:22.505
DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY. THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ARGUED THE 

10:26:22.506 --> 10:26:24.656
COURTS HAD NO AUTHORITY OVER ITS
DENIAL OF SUCH WITNESSES. BUT 

10:26:24.858 --> 10:26:26.858
THE FEDERAL COURT AND COMMITTEE 
ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT 

10:26:27.336 --> 10:26:29.336
REFORM DISAGREED.

10:26:35.426 --> 10:26:37.115
PROFESSOR TURLEY AND HIS 
TESTIMONY TO THIS COMMITTEE 

10:26:37.116 --> 10:26:38.821
TESTIFIED HE THINKS THE 
DEMOCRATS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS IS

10:26:38.822 --> 10:26:41.998
AN ABUSE OF POWER. HE SAID 
QUOTE, WHAT I AM SAYING IS IF 

10:26:42.206 --> 10:26:44.396
YOU WANT A WELL BASED LEGITIMATE
IMPEACHMENT CASE TO

10:26:51.797 --> 10:26:53.679
SET THE ABBREVIATED SCHEDULE AND
DEMAND DOCUMENTS AND IMPEACH 

10:26:53.680 --> 10:26:55.960
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TURNED
OVER WHEN THEY GO TO A COURT, 

10:26:56.166 --> 10:26:58.759
WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOES TO A 
COURT I THINK THAT. IS AN ABUSE 

10:26:58.975 --> 10:27:01.306
OF POWER. IF YOU MAKE A HIGH 
CRIME MISDEMEANOR OUT OF GOING 

10:27:01.526 --> 10:27:04.829
TO THE COURTS IT IS AN ABUSE OF 
POWER. IT IS YOUR ABUSE OF 

10:27:04.956 --> 10:27:08.416
POWER. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO 
SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.

10:27:22.797 --> 10:27:24.797
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. MY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN 

10:27:24.936 --> 10:27:27.686
PUTTING FORWARD A LOT OF EXCUSES
TODAY. I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE 

10:27:27.829 --> 10:27:30.296
ONES THAT WE HAVE HEARD THE 
MOST. FIRST, THEY HAVE SAID

10:27:34.676 --> 10:27:36.605
THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR WAS ALL
ABOUT HIS SUPPOSEDLY LEGITIMATE 

10:27:36.606 --> 10:27:40.595
CONCERN ABOUT CORRUPTION. WHAT 
WE KNOW IS THAT ALL OF PRESIDENT

10:27:41.366 --> 10:27:45.663
TRUMP'S AGENCIES, ALL OF HIS 
ADVISORS AND EVERYONE 

10:27:46.076 --> 10:27:48.076
UNANIMOUSLY TOLD HIM

10:27:53.807 --> 10:27:55.705
THAT UKRAINE HAVE PASSED ALL THE
ANTICORRUPTION BENCHMARKS. WHAT 

10:27:55.706 --> 10:27:57.876
WE KNOW IS THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE SAID NO FURTHER REVIEW 

10:27:58.096 --> 10:28:02.320
ON THE CLAIM CORRUPTION WAS 
NECESSARY. WHAT WE KNOW IS THE 

10:28:02.527 --> 10:28:04.527
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET CUTS

10:28:07.637 --> 10:28:10.196
AID FOR THE UKRAINE DESIGNED TO 
FIGHT THE UKRAINE CORRUPTION. 

10:28:10.616 --> 10:28:14.661
AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH BOTH CALLS 

10:28:15.436 --> 10:28:20.217
OF PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WAS GIVEN 
OFFICIAL TALKING POINTS.  

10:28:20.657 --> 10:28:22.657
OFFICIAL TALKING POINTS ON 
CORRUPTION IN THE UKRAINE.

10:28:27.640 --> 10:28:29.640
AND YES HE NEVER USE THOSE 
TALKING POINTS. HE NEVER 

10:28:29.757 --> 10:28:31.898
MENTIONED THE WORD CORRUPTION ON
EITHER CALL. THE ONLY TWO NAMES 

10:28:32.096 --> 10:28:36.965
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MENTIONED 
WERE JOE AND HUNTER BIDEN. ON 

10:28:37.726 --> 10:28:39.726
JULY 25.

10:28:49.537 --> 10:28:51.245
THE SECOND EXCUSE THE 
REPUBLICANS PUT FORWARD. THEY 

10:28:51.246 --> 10:28:53.386
SUGGEST THIS WAS ALL ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S DESIRE TO GET THE 

10:28:53.606 --> 10:28:55.606
EUROPEAN UNION TO SHARE MORE OF 
THE BURDEN OF FOREIGN 

10:28:55.686 --> 10:29:01.237
ASSISTANCE. LET'S LOOK AT THAT. 
MR. HOLMES TOLD US THAT EUROPE 

10:29:01.446 --> 10:29:03.566
PROVIDES FOUR TIMES AS MUCH 
ASSISTANCE AND MORE AID TO THE 

10:29:03.768 --> 10:29:06.076
UKRAINE THAN WE DO. ACTUALLY THE
UNITED STATES A LARGELY GETS 

10:29:06.828 --> 10:29:11.516
PAID BACK. ON TOP OF THAT 
AMBASSADOR SONLAND AND PRESIDENT

10:29:11.736 --> 10:29:13.736
TRUMP'S AMBASSADOR TO THE 
EUROPEAN UNION TESTIFIED CLEARLY

10:29:16.206 --> 10:29:18.576
THAT NOBODY EVER TOLD HIM TO GO 
TO THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND 

10:29:18.792 --> 10:29:20.792
ACTUALLY ASK FOR MORE MILITARY 
AID

10:29:29.207 --> 10:29:31.326
TO BE PROVIDED. THAT SIMPLY 
WASN'T THE CASE. THE ONLY THING 

10:29:31.546 --> 10:29:33.025
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD 
AMBASSADOR SONLAND TO 

10:29:33.026 --> 10:29:35.167
COMMUNICATE TO THE UKRAINE, WHAT
WAS THAT. HE TOLD US THE 

10:29:35.366 --> 10:29:37.546
RESUMPTION OF AID WOULD LIKELY 
NOT OCCUR UNLESS PRESIDENT

10:29:42.135 --> 10:29:43.165
ZELENSKY ANNOUNCED THE 
INVESTIGATION. AMBASSADOR 

10:29:43.166 --> 10:29:48.736
SONLAND MAKE CLEAR ON LEST  AS 
THEY WERE ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD 

10:29:48.939 --> 10:29:50.939
BE A STALEMATE OVER THE AID.

10:29:54.276 --> 10:29:56.335
WHAT WERE THESE INVESTIGATIONS? 
2016 ELECTION INTERFERENCE. AND 

10:29:56.495 --> 10:29:58.495
BURISMA. MEANING

10:30:03.901 --> 10:30:05.901
THE BIDENS. FINALLY LEFT WITH NO
OTHER DEFENSES. MY REPUBLICAN 

10:30:06.018 --> 10:30:08.155
COLLEAGUES SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAD A LEGITIMATE REASON TO 

10:30:08.366 --> 10:30:11.758
INVESTIGATE VICE PRESIDENT 
BIDEN. ONCE AGAIN LET'S LOOK AT 

10:30:12.508 --> 10:30:17.415
THE FACTS. THAT MAKES NO SENSE 
WHATSOEVER. THE MINORITIES OWN 

10:30:17.555 --> 10:30:19.846
REPORT STATES THAT THE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE BIDENS 

10:30:20.066 --> 10:30:22.066
WERE FROM 2015.

10:30:34.327 --> 10:30:36.327
PRESIDENT TRUMP READILY GAVE 
MILITARY AID TO THE UKRAINE IN 

10:30:36.445 --> 10:30:38.586
2017 AND THEN AGAIN IN 2018. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OWN AIDE TOLD 

10:30:38.787 --> 10:30:40.787
HIM THAT THERE WAS NO MERIT TO 
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WHAT 

10:30:40.886 --> 10:30:44.506
CHANGED? WHAT LED TO THE SUDDEN 
PUSH TO HOLD UP CONGRESSIONALLY 

10:30:44.726 --> 10:30:47.987
APPROVED DESPERATELY NEEDED 
MILITARY AID WITHOUT TELLING 

10:30:48.126 --> 10:30:50.126
ANYBODY THE REASON?

10:30:58.315 --> 10:31:00.195
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BEGAN 
BEATING PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE 

10:31:00.196 --> 10:31:02.345
POLLS. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. 
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID DO US 

10:31:02.546 --> 10:31:06.768
A FAVOR, WHO WAS THE US? WE KNOW
WHO THE US WAS. HE SAID IT. 

10:31:07.189 --> 10:31:10.056
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  THAT HIS PERSONAL 

10:31:10.205 --> 10:31:14.275
ATTORNEY, HIS PERSONAL LAWYER, 
RUDY GIULIANI

10:31:21.236 --> 10:31:23.345
, QUOTE VERY MUCH KNOWS WHAT IS 
GOING ON. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

10:31:23.566 --> 10:31:25.566
COULD'VE GONE THROUGH OFFICIAL 
CHANNELS IF HE WANTED. HE 

10:31:26.015 --> 10:31:30.565
COULD'VE ASKED FOR THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL TO CONDUCT AN 

10:31:30.768 --> 10:31:32.269
INVESTIGATION. HE COULD'VE 
CONDUCTED ALL SORTS OF 

10:31:32.270 --> 10:31:34.270
LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATIONS BUT HE
DIDN'T. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE

10:31:34.385 --> 10:31:37.146
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAID THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER ASKED THEM

10:31:37.365 --> 10:31:40.436
TO DO ANY INVESTIGATIONS EVEN 
TALK TO THE UKRAINE. INSTEAD

10:31:48.325 --> 10:31:50.224
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED HIS 
PERSONAL ATTORNEY BECAUSE US WAS

10:31:50.225 --> 10:31:52.225
NOT ABOUT AMERICANA. THE 
PRESIDENT WAS NOT PUTTING 

10:31:52.506 --> 10:31:54.273
AMERICA FIRST. THIS WASN'T 
OFFICIAL POLICY. THIS WASN'T 

10:31:54.274 --> 10:31:59.402
WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
EVERY WITNESS TOLD US THAT TOO. 

10:31:59.817 --> 10:32:01.817
THIS WAS PERSONAL. IT WAS OFFER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

10:32:10.633 --> 10:32:12.758
PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN. TO 
BENEFIT HIS OWN CAMPAIGN AND HIS

10:32:12.975 --> 10:32:14.975
REELECTION. THAT'S WHY HE USED 
HIS PERSONAL ATTORNEY TO DO 

10:32:15.105 --> 10:32:17.625
THAT. HE ABUSED HIS POWER AND 
THE BOWER ENTRUSTED TO HIM BY WE

10:32:17.828 --> 10:32:19.828
THE PEOPLE. HE PLACED OUR 
SAFETY, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 

10:32:19.955 --> 10:32:25.017
TAXPAYER MONEY ON THE TABLE. 
THAT IS AN ABUSE OF POWER. WE 

10:32:25.225 --> 10:32:28.564
MUST IMPEACH DONALD JAY TRUMP. I
YIELD BACK. 

10:32:28.565 --> 10:32:30.565
&gt;&gt;

10:32:37.141 --> 10:32:38.614
WE MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

10:32:38.615 --> 10:32:43.055
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT 

10:32:43.274 --> 10:32:45.274
SUBPOENAS FOR A LITTLE BIT. 
ADAMIC CRADDICK

10:32:52.001 --> 10:32:54.095
-- IT STARTED IN THIS COMMITTEE 
WITH THE SUBPOENA TO THE 

10:32:54.305 --> 10:32:56.224
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR. THE 
COMPLIANCE WHATEVER REQUIRED HIM

10:32:56.225 --> 10:32:58.365
TO VIOLATE THE LAW. LIKE A 
REASONABLE AND RATIONAL WILL 

10:32:58.585 --> 10:33:03.912
DELIVER TO BODY. WHAT DO WE DO? 
WE HELD THEM IN CONTEMPT.

10:33:07.845 --> 10:33:10.225
WE HELD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 
THE UNITED STATES IN CONTEMPT OF

10:33:10.445 --> 10:33:15.525
CONGRESS FOR NOT VIOLATING THE 
LAW. IT GETS BETTER. AFTER THAT 

10:33:15.747 --> 10:33:18.317
WE HELD A HEARING ABOUT WHETHER 
OR NOT WE SHOULD HAVE HELD HIM 

10:33:18.535 --> 10:33:20.535
IN CONTEMPT. OVERSIGHT DEMOCRATS

10:33:28.279 --> 10:33:29.756
SUBPOENAED DOCUMENTS FROM 
COMMERCE AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS 

10:33:29.757 --> 10:33:32.115
RELATING DIRECTLY TO A CASE THAT
WAS PENDING IN FRONT OF THE 

10:33:32.315 --> 10:33:34.174
SUPREME COURT. AS I STATED 
EARLIER THE SAME DEMOCRATS 

10:33:34.175 --> 10:33:35.844
SUBPOENAED THE PERSONAL EMAILS 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CHILDREN. 

10:33:35.845 --> 10:33:37.845
DEMOCRATS HAVE SUBPOENAED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

10:33:52.238 --> 10:33:54.144
TAX RETURNS FOR PURELY POLITICAL
PURPOSES. SPEAKING OF POLITICS, 

10:33:54.145 --> 10:33:56.037
ADAM SCHIFF IS THE SUBPOENA 
POWER OF THE INTELLIGENCE 

10:33:56.038 --> 10:33:57.954
COMMITTEE TO OBTAIN PHONE 
RECORDS. HE RELEASED THE PHONE 

10:33:57.955 --> 10:34:00.535
RECORDS OF A MEMBER OF THE PRESS
AND THE RANKING MEMBER IN HIS 

10:34:01.305 --> 10:34:03.305
POLITICAL OPPONENT.

10:34:07.596 --> 10:34:09.515
YOU CANNOT WEAPONIZE THE 
SUBPOENA POWER OF CONGRESS IN 

10:34:09.516 --> 10:34:11.516
ORDER TO ARREST THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH AND NOT EXPECT THE 

10:34:11.635 --> 10:34:13.635
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO USE EVERY 
LEGAL REMEDY AT THEIR DISPOSAL 

10:34:13.823 --> 10:34:18.485
TO OPPOSE THE SUBPOENAS. YOU CAN
CONTINUE WITH AN IMPEACHMENT 

10:34:18.705 --> 10:34:20.624
PROCEEDING. IT'S A POLITICAL 
PROCEEDING. WHAT YOU CANNOT DO 

10:34:20.625 --> 10:34:24.405
IS CHARGE OBSTRUCTION BECAUSE 
YOU WILL CONTINUE FASTER THAN 

10:34:24.617 --> 10:34:27.007
ALLOWING THE COURTS TO DECIDE 
IT. BEFORE I FINISH I WOULD LIKE

10:34:27.205 --> 10:34:29.903
TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS.
WE HAVEN'T SUBPOENAED AMBASSADOR

10:34:30.035 --> 10:34:33.545
BOLTON. HE BEGGED ONE TO HAVE 
ONE ISSUED TO HIM. WE HAVEN'T 

10:34:33.748 --> 10:34:35.748
SUBPOENAED THE WHISTLEBLOWER OR 
ADAM SCHIFF.

10:34:40.615 --> 10:34:42.534
WE HAVEN'T SUBPOENAED ALL THE 
PEOPLE THAT THE WHISTLEBLOWER 

10:34:42.535 --> 10:34:48.295
MENTIONED TO TALK TO IN 
RELATION. IF WE WANT TO TALK 

10:34:48.515 --> 10:34:50.862
ABOUT ABUSE AND OBSTRUCTION AND 
WHY THESE THINGS ARE GOING ON I 

10:34:51.072 --> 10:34:53.072
THINK IS ANOTHER COMMENT

10:34:56.135 --> 10:34:59.992
, WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND HE 
IS US. WITH THAT I YIELD BACK. 

10:35:00.955 --> 10:35:02.955
&gt;&gt;

10:35:04.882 --> 10:35:09.791
THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR.
CHAIRMAN THERE ARE TWO ARTICLES 

10:35:10.435 --> 10:35:12.435
OF IMPEACHMENT. EACH IS VITALLY 
IMPORTANT.

10:35:23.165 --> 10:35:30.225
ARTICLE 1 BEST IN THE HOUSE, 
SOLE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT. THAT 

10:35:30.443 --> 10:35:36.195
SET FORTH IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
WHAT HAS THE PRESIDENT DONE? 

10:35:36.635 --> 10:35:39.105
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE FIRST AND
ONLY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN 

10:35:39.268 --> 10:35:43.715
HISTORY TO OPENLY AND 
INDISCRIMINATELY DEFY ALL 

10:35:43.862 --> 10:35:47.684
ASPECTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

10:35:58.265 --> 10:36:00.385
OCTOBER 26 THE PRESIDENT ARGUED 
THAT CONGRESS SHOULD NOT EVEN BE

10:36:00.605 --> 10:36:02.725
ALLOWED TO IMPEACH HIM UNDER THE
CONSTITUTION. ON OCTOBER 8 THE 

10:36:02.945 --> 10:36:05.095
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL ACTING ON 
BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT WROTE A 

10:36:05.295 --> 10:36:07.295
LETTER TO THE HOUSE AND SAID 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CANNOT 

10:36:07.385 --> 10:36:12.025
PERMIT HIS ADMINISTRATION TO 
PARTICIPATE. THIS IS NOT A 

10:36:12.793 --> 10:36:14.793
FISHING EXPEDITION.

10:36:19.276 --> 10:36:21.385
THIS IS A MATTER OF GRAVE 
IMPORTANCE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

10:36:21.605 --> 10:36:26.485
IT AT LENGTH. THE ABUSE OF POWER
THE PRESIDENT HAS EXHIBITED. 

10:36:26.889 --> 10:36:29.218
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT REFUSED TO
PRODUCE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT

10:36:29.439 --> 10:36:31.768
THE DOZENS OF OFFICIALS THAT HE 
HAS BLOCKED. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE 

10:36:31.975 --> 10:36:34.325
DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE ASKED 
FOR? WHAT ABOUT THE WITNESSES 

10:36:34.545 --> 10:36:39.435
THAT DID COME FORWARD. WHO TOLD 
US ABOUT THE BRIEF MATERIALS 

10:36:39.655 --> 10:36:44.495
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CALL. AND
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 

10:36:44.715 --> 10:36:46.715
STAFF AND THE CONCLUSIONS

10:36:54.909 --> 10:36:56.605
FOR MEETINGS RELATED TO THE 
UKRAINE. INCLUDING MILITARY 

10:36:56.606 --> 10:36:58.284
ASSISTANCE. WHAT ABOUT THE 
MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION FROM 

10:36:58.285 --> 10:37:00.285
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MEETING IN NEW
YORK WITH PRESIDENT TRENT ONE 

10:37:00.455 --> 10:37:02.455
ZELENSKY.  WHAT ABOUT THE 
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE 

10:37:02.939 --> 10:37:08.759
VICE PRESIDENT. THE NOTES TAKEN 
FROM JENNIFER WILLIAMS. THE 

10:37:08.975 --> 10:37:10.975
BRIEFING MATERIALS PREPARED FOR 
THE VICE PRESIDENTS MEETING.

10:37:17.319 --> 10:37:19.319
ON NOVEMBER 24 THE NEWS REPORT 
REVEALED THE WHITE HOUSE 

10:37:19.424 --> 10:37:22.445
CONDUCTED A RECORDS REVIEW AND 
TURNED UP HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS 

10:37:22.869 --> 10:37:24.767
THAT REVEAL EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO
GENERATE AFTER-THE-FACT OF THE 

10:37:24.768 --> 10:37:26.768
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DECISION. 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING 

10:37:27.429 --> 10:37:31.748
ABOUT. OBSTRUCTION MATTERS 
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE 

10:37:31.961 --> 10:37:37.037
LOOKING FOR. WE KNOW HOW 
IMPORTANT IT IS. THE PRESIDENT 

10:37:37.265 --> 10:37:41.705
HAS STOOD IN THE WAY OF THIS 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. DOING 

10:37:41.915 --> 10:37:48.264
IT'S IMPORTANT WORK. THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED 

10:37:48.676 --> 10:37:50.644
THESE OFFICIALS TO SPEAK. 
SHOULD'VE ALLOWED THESE 

10:37:50.645 --> 10:37:54.153
DOCUMENTS TO SPEAK. MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 

10:37:54.311 --> 10:37:57.475
UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT A FISHING
EXPEDITION.

10:38:00.999 --> 10:38:03.925
THEY KNOW THESE DOCUMENTS ARE 
THEIR. IF THEY WERE TO HELP THE 

10:38:04.065 --> 10:38:06.849
PRESIDENT THEY WOULD BE URGING 
THE PRESIDENT TO WORK WITH US.

10:38:10.385 --> 10:38:15.365
RATHER THAN OBSTRUCT US. WE HAVE
TO PROCEED. I OPPOSE THIS 

10:38:15.525 --> 10:38:21.494
AMENDMENT. I YIELD THE BALANCE 
OF MY TIME TO MR. JOHNSON. 

10:38:21.495 --> 10:38:24.786
&gt;&gt; TONIGHT WE ARE CALLED UPON TO
PROTECT THE NATION'S CORE 

10:38:25.005 --> 10:38:28.475
VALUES. MONEY AND THE ECONOMY 
ARE NOT OUR CORE VALUES.

10:38:38.769 --> 10:38:43.445
WITHHOLDING DESPERATELY NEEDED 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FROM AIDE 

10:38:43.665 --> 10:38:47.515
ALLY. DESPERATELY IN NEED. THAT 
IS NOT A CORE VALUE. CO-WORST 

10:38:47.735 --> 10:38:49.735
THAN A FOREIGN POWER

10:38:53.226 --> 10:38:55.356
TO INTERFERE IN A PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IS NOT OUR CORE VALUE. 

10:38:55.575 --> 10:38:57.575
GIVING CONGRESS THE FIGURE.

10:39:13.425 --> 10:39:17.415
RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR DUTIES ARE 

10:39:18.174 --> 10:39:20.174
FAITHFULLY EXECUTED.

10:39:22.535 --> 10:39:26.612
A FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE 
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

10:39:30.164 --> 10:39:33.675
. OUR CORE VALUES TO THE BEST OF
YOUR ABILITY.

10:39:37.385 --> 10:39:39.385
PRESERVING AND PROTECTING AND 
DEFENDING OUR CONSTITUTION. THAT

10:39:39.825 --> 10:39:41.825
IS THE

10:39:43.395 --> 10:39:46.803
NATION'S CORE VALUES. WHEN A 
PRESIDENT COMMITS A GRAVE ABUSE 

10:39:47.015 --> 10:39:52.539
OF THE PUBLIC TRUST BY RUNNING A
ROUGHSHOD OVER THE HIGH OFFICE 

10:39:52.755 --> 10:39:57.625
OF THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS IS
LEFT WITH NO CHOICE THAN TO DO 

10:39:57.827 --> 10:40:02.738
ITS DUTY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC 
AND THE REPUBLIC FROM CLEAR AND 

10:40:03.507 --> 10:40:09.335
PRESENT DANGER. WE MUST IMPEACH 
THIS PRESIDENT. WITH THAT I 

10:40:09.555 --> 10:40:11.555
YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELD BACK.

10:40:29.045 --> 10:40:30.746
&gt;&gt; WE MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

10:40:30.747 --> 10:40:32.857
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP PRESSURE OF A 

10:40:33.065 --> 10:40:34.960
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO TARGET AN 
AMERICAN CITIZEN FOR POLITICAL 

10:40:34.961 --> 10:40:37.535
GAIN. AT THE SAME TIME WITH HELP
$391 MILLION IN MILITARY AID TO 

10:40:37.758 --> 10:40:39.867
VACATION AS PART OF A SCHEME TO 
SOLICIT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN 

10:40:40.085 --> 10:40:46.395
THE 2020 ELECTION. THE JULY 25 
ROUGH TRANSCRIPT IS A SMOKING 

10:40:46.535 --> 10:40:54.908
GUN. AND DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS 
PULLED THE TRIGGER. DO US A 

10:40:55.045 --> 10:40:57.045
FAVOR

10:40:59.865 --> 10:41:03.435
. THE CENTRAL QUESTION FOR US TO
RESOLVE ON THIS COMMITTEE IS 

10:41:03.655 --> 10:41:06.044
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT SOUGHT A 
POLITICAL FAVOR

10:41:09.205 --> 10:41:12.515
, OR IS HE AS MY REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES SUGGEST AN ANTI-

10:41:14.185 --> 10:41:19.966
CORRUPTION CRUSADER? THAT NOTION
IS LAUGHABLE. LET'S JUST CHECK 

10:41:20.731 --> 10:41:26.015
THE RECORD. TO SEE WHAT IT SAYS.
DONALD TRUMP SPOKE TO THE 

10:41:26.155 --> 10:41:28.155
UKRAINIAN

10:41:30.634 --> 10:41:32.955
PRESIDENT TWICE. ONCE ON APRIL 
21. HE DID NOT USE THE WORD 

10:41:33.395 --> 10:41:35.395
CORRUPTION ONCE. HE HAD A SECOND
CALL

10:41:40.375 --> 10:41:42.686
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UKRAINE. ON JULY 25. HE DID NOT 

10:41:42.900 --> 10:41:46.185
USE THE WORD CORRUPTION ONCE. 
DONALD TRUMP'S OWN DEPARTMENT OF

10:41:46.338 --> 10:41:53.935
DEFENSE WROTE A LETTER TO THE 
CONGRESS ON MAY 23. AND SAID 

10:41:54.375 --> 10:41:58.135
THAT THE NEW UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT, THE NEW UKRAINIAN 

10:41:58.275 --> 10:42:03.339
GOVERNMENT HAVE SATISFIED ALL 
NECESSARY PRECONDITIONS

10:42:09.005 --> 10:42:11.005
TO RECEIVE THE AID. INCLUDING 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 

10:42:11.266 --> 10:42:14.297
ANTICORRUPTION PROTOCOL. THAT 
WAS DONALD TRUMP'S DEPARTMENT OF

10:42:15.051 --> 10:42:20.655
DEFENSE. SAYING THERE ARE NO 
CORRUPTION CONCERNS THAT SHOULD 

10:42:20.865 --> 10:42:28.358
JUSTIFY THE WITHHOLDING OF THE 
AID. THAT'S WHY SO MANY TRUMP 

10:42:28.495 --> 10:42:30.495
APPOINTED WITNESSES

10:42:34.975 --> 10:42:37.863
CAME FORWARD AND WERE TROUBLED. 
I JUST WANT TO ENTER INTO THE 

10:42:38.005 --> 10:42:42.265
RECORD. LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
ALEXANDER GOODMAN WHO WAS ON THE

10:42:42.425 --> 10:42:49.303
CALL REPORTED HIS CONCERN 
BECAUSE QUOTE, THEY HAS 

10:42:49.515 --> 10:42:51.867
SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL SECURITY 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY. 

10:42:52.825 --> 10:42:57.965
THE LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAID IT 
IS IMPROPER FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

10:42:58.185 --> 10:43:01.374
THE UNITED STATES TO DEMAND A 
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION

10:43:01.576 --> 10:43:07.575
INTO A U.S. CITIZEN FOR A 
POLITICAL OPPONENT. THAT WAS 

10:43:07.792 --> 10:43:12.565
LIEUTENANT COLONEL DENMAN. IRAQ 
WAR VETERAN. PURPLE HEART 

10:43:12.708 --> 10:43:15.877
RECIPIENT. 20 YEARS OF ACTIVE 
DUTY.

10:43:25.175 --> 10:43:26.856
GORDON SONDLAND, AMBASSADOR, 
APPOINTED BY DONALD TRUMP. WHAT 

10:43:26.857 --> 10:43:29.395
DID HE SAY? EVERYBODY WAS IN THE
LOOP. IT WAS NO SECRET. WAS 

10:43:29.615 --> 10:43:33.334
THERE A QUID PRO QUO? THE ANSWER
IS YES. IS SONLAND A NEVER 

10:43:33.478 --> 10:43:35.478
TRUMPER?

10:43:38.265 --> 10:43:40.395
IT WAS APPOINTED BY DONALD 
TRUMP. HE GAVE $1 MILLION TO 

10:43:40.818 --> 10:43:43.678
TRUMPS INAUGURATION. OF COURSE 
THERE IS BILL TAYLOR. WEST POINT

10:43:43.821 --> 10:43:47.425
GRADUATE. WHAT DID HE SAY? TO 
WITHHOLD THE ASSISTANT

10:43:51.418 --> 10:43:53.525
FOR NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN 
HELP WITH THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN

10:43:53.745 --> 10:43:55.745
MADE NO SENSE.

10:43:58.615 --> 10:44:00.756
IT WAS ILLOGICAL. IT CANNOT BE 
EXPLAINED. IT WAS CRAZY. THAT 

10:44:00.965 --> 10:44:04.585
WAS THE RECORD EVIDENCE THAT HAS
BEEN ESTABLISHED. DONALD TRUMP 

10:44:04.787 --> 10:44:06.787
DID NOT CARE ABOUT

10:44:10.125 --> 10:44:11.996
ALLEGED CORRUPTION IN THE 
UKRAINE. HE SOUGHT A POLITICAL 

10:44:11.997 --> 10:44:13.997
FAVOR. AT THE SAME TIME,

10:44:17.321 --> 10:44:19.180
DONALD TRUMP WAS ALLEGEDLY 
CONCERNED WITH CORRUPTION IN THE

10:44:19.181 --> 10:44:25.161
UKRAINE. HE AUTHORIZED $8 
BILLION IN WEAPONS SALES TO THE 

10:44:25.365 --> 10:44:27.365
CORRUPT KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA.

10:44:30.665 --> 10:44:32.854
ANOTHER GULF STATE. $8 BILLION. 
IN APRIL HE AUTHORIZED.

10:44:36.586 --> 10:44:38.764
HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY CONCERNED 
ABOUT CORRUPTION. THIS IS A 

10:44:38.905 --> 10:44:41.715
REGIME THAT BUTCHERED A 
WASHINGTON POST JOURNALIST WITH 

10:44:41.935 --> 10:44:44.735
A BONE SAW AND THEN LIED ABOUT 
IT.

10:44:52.366 --> 10:44:54.366
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS 
WITHHOLDING MONEY FROM THE 

10:44:54.445 --> 10:44:56.445
UKRAINE. HE AUTHORIZED A BILLION
DOLLARS IN WEAPONS SALES OVER 

10:44:56.570 --> 10:44:58.570
THE OBJECTION OF CONGRESS.

10:45:01.345 --> 10:45:03.253
THE PRESIDENT PRESSURED A 
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO TARGET AN 

10:45:03.254 --> 10:45:05.254
AMERICAN CITIZEN FOR POLITICAL 
GAIN.

10:45:11.776 --> 10:45:13.235
HE SOLICITED FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2020 

10:45:13.236 --> 10:45:15.964
ELECTION. THE RECORD IS CLEAR. 
HE ABUSED HIS POWER. HE MUST BE 

10:45:16.625 --> 10:45:22.905
HELD ACCOUNTABLE. IN AMERICA NO 
ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. I YIELD 

10:45:23.085 --> 10:45:26.381
BACK. 
&gt;&gt;

10:45:30.915 --> 10:45:36.295
I HAVE LISTENED TO THIS. THIS 
IDEA OF THE PROCESS. THE IDEA

10:45:47.334 --> 10:45:49.996
, I SUPPORT THIS. FRANKLY WE ARE
IN A POSITION THAT WE DON'T NEED

10:45:50.204 --> 10:45:52.475
TO BE. HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO 
LISTEN ALL DAY TODAY. TO THE 

10:45:52.685 --> 10:45:54.836
TRYING TO BUILD A CASE OUT OF 
NOTHING. THE MAJORITY HAS 

10:45:55.036 --> 10:46:04.365
DISPARAGED BEYOND BELIEF. I AM 
NOT SURE WHY, I AM NOT SURE WHY 

10:46:04.785 --> 10:46:06.984
THEY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE TO PUT 
OUT THE ARTICLES

10:46:10.797 --> 10:46:12.967
. THEY DIE BECAUSE OF AID THAT 
WAS WITHHELD

10:46:31.153 --> 10:46:33.275
KEEP SENDING IT OUT THERE. THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING. IT

10:46:33.494 --> 10:46:36.305
IS AMAZING TO ME TO LISTEN TO MY
COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT HOW WE DID

10:46:36.525 --> 10:46:38.655
PROPER PROCESS. LET ME TAKE YOU 
ON A WONDERLAND TRIP BACK 

10:46:38.856 --> 10:46:40.856
THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE THIS 
YEAR. WE DID MORE THINGS THAT 

10:46:41.015 --> 10:46:43.017
WERE AMAZINGLY OUTRAGEOUS THAN I
COULD EVER IMAGINE.

10:46:47.895 --> 10:46:50.246
WE LEARNED SOME STUFF THIS YEAR.
NO OFFENSE TO MY CHAIRMAN. HE'S 

10:46:50.464 --> 10:46:52.987
BEEN DOING THE BEST HE COULD. TO
SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF BEING THE

10:46:53.184 --> 10:46:56.395
CHAIRMAN. WE HAVE LEARNED THIS 
YEAR SUBPOENAS, THEY HELPED YOU 

10:46:56.615 --> 10:47:00.204
LOOK BETTER IN COURT. WE LEARNED
THAT SUBPOENAS ARE A 

10:47:00.405 --> 10:47:06.165
CONVERSATION STARTER. I AM NOT 
SURE WHAT THAT IS ABOUT. I KNOW 

10:47:06.927 --> 10:47:09.175
IN COURT THEIR COMPELLING 
INFORMATION.

10:47:13.165 --> 10:47:16.792
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS AND YOU 
START TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS 

10:47:17.005 --> 10:47:19.890
HAVE BEEN DENIED PROCESS AND 
DENIED THIS IT'S INTERESTING TO 

10:47:20.034 --> 10:47:23.424
ME. 70 SOMETHING DAYS, THE OTHER
DAY

10:47:26.927 --> 10:47:29.064
I THINK THIS YOUNG LADY IN 
CALIFORNIA SAID THEY TRIED TO 

10:47:29.265 --> 10:47:31.265
MAKE A COMPARISON.

10:47:34.827 --> 10:47:36.915
THAT WAS AFTER THREE AND HALF 
YEARS OF INVESTIGATION. IN THIS 

10:47:37.135 --> 10:47:39.135
ONE WE HAVE HAD SINCE SEPTEMBER 
UNTIL NOW.

10:47:47.818 --> 10:47:49.687
THE MAJORITY IS ACTING LIKE 
PETULANT CHILDREN. THEY'RE NOT 

10:47:49.688 --> 10:47:51.688
GETTING THEIR WAY QUICK ENOUGH 
BECAUSE SANTA CLAUS HASN'T COME 

10:47:51.838 --> 10:47:53.957
YET. THERE GETTING READY TO VOTE
FOR THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENT. THE

10:47:54.165 --> 10:47:58.195
AMERICAN PEOPLE NEXT NOVEMBER 
WILL REMEMBER THIS CHRISTMAS 

10:47:58.405 --> 10:48:00.938
PRESENT. IT GOES BACK FURTHER. I
REMEMBER A TIME WHEN WE WANT TO 

10:48:01.143 --> 10:48:03.143
TALK ABOUT THE SANCTITY OF 
SUBPOENAS WHY DID THE MAJORITY 

10:48:03.255 --> 10:48:05.255
WITHDRAW FROM THE CONFERENCE?

10:48:12.579 --> 10:48:14.695
THEY COULD'VE HAD THE CHARADE 
AND STILL STAYED IN COURT. IT'S 

10:48:14.896 --> 10:48:17.625
A WASTE OF TIME. DON'T HAND ME 
THESE HIGH AND MIGHTY ARGUMENTS 

10:48:18.395 --> 10:48:21.715
ABOUT PROCESS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT
OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS. IT'S ABOUT

10:48:21.931 --> 10:48:26.468
CONGRESS BEING PETULANT. AND 
SAYING WE DO NOT WHAT WE WON'T 

10:48:26.604 --> 10:48:31.907
WANT. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR 
ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL WHITAKER

10:48:33.145 --> 10:48:35.932
, DO YOU REMEMBER THIS? I WILL 
REMIND SOME OF THE FOLKS.

10:48:40.314 --> 10:48:42.314
THEY WERE TRYING TO GET ACTING 
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHITAKER HERE. 

10:48:42.435 --> 10:48:44.746
THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE 
POLITICAL POINTS AS THE YEAR GOT

10:48:44.959 --> 10:48:46.959
STARTED BECAUSE THERE WAS 
NOTHING ROLLING AT.

10:48:52.018 --> 10:48:53.924
MUELLER HADN'T HAPPENED. THEY 
COULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT EXCEPT 

10:48:53.925 --> 10:48:56.021
FOR BROAD GENERIC TERMS. ONE 
WEEK BEFORE BILL BARR WAS SWORN 

10:48:56.235 --> 10:48:59.403
IN WE BROUGHT IN MR. WHITAKER. 
WE THREATENED HIM WITH A 

10:48:59.605 --> 10:49:02.184
SUBPOENA AND MADE PUBLIC 
DECLARATION ABOUT A SUBPOENA. 

10:49:02.605 --> 10:49:04.926
UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THE NIGHT 
BEFORE THEY SENT HIM A LETTER. 

10:49:05.135 --> 10:49:07.525
IF YOU SHOW UP WE WILL NOT DO 
THAT SUBPOENA.

10:49:11.343 --> 10:49:13.845
WE FOUND IT ALL RIGHT HERE. WE 
TALKED ABOUT IT. IT'S HARD FOR 

10:49:14.065 --> 10:49:18.295
ME TO HEAR HOW THIS CONGRESS AND
THIS COMMITTEE, AND WE WON'T 

10:49:18.515 --> 10:49:20.515
EVEN GET STARTED ON MR.

10:49:24.685 --> 10:49:26.958
SCHIFF. HE LOVES THE CAMERA AND 
THE MICROPHONE AND LOVES HIS OWN

10:49:27.165 --> 10:49:29.735
GAVEL. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO ANSWER
HIS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS OWN WORK

10:49:29.945 --> 10:49:31.945
AND WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY DONE.

10:49:36.106 --> 10:49:38.255
LAST WEEK WHEN MR. GOLDMAN WAS 
HERE WHO ACTUALLY ORDERED THE 

10:49:38.457 --> 10:49:42.036
MATCHING OF THAT SO THEY CAN 
UNMASK RANKING MEMBER AND 

10:49:42.244 --> 10:49:45.376
JOURNALIST. THEY COULD HAVE JUST
AS EASILY PUT IN IF IT HAD BEEN 

10:49:45.516 --> 10:49:47.516
PROPER

10:49:52.481 --> 10:49:54.481
NUMBER ONE CONGRESSPERSON ONE. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER THEY COULD USE

10:49:54.554 --> 10:49:56.554
WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO. THEY 
DID IT FOR DRIVE-BY PURPOSES. 

10:49:56.648 --> 10:50:00.085
TONIGHT AS WE HEAR THE ANGST AND
WE HEAR THE PLANE OUT HYPOCRISY 

10:50:00.515 --> 10:50:02.515
REMEMBER THIS IS A MAJORITY.

10:50:10.858 --> 10:50:13.195
THEY HAVE ONE THING IN MIND. 
THEY HAVE NOT PASSED BILLS. I 

10:50:13.415 --> 10:50:15.565
DENY THEY HAVE NOT PASSED BILLS 
ENOUGH THAT CAN GET ANY 

10:50:15.769 --> 10:50:19.725
BIPARTISANSHIP IN THE UNIT 
SENATE. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

10:50:19.865 --> 10:50:21.865
SUBPOENAS.

10:50:27.244 --> 10:50:29.373
YOU DON'T HAVE ABUSE OF POWER 
AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE 

10:50:29.584 --> 10:50:31.584
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.

10:50:35.164 --> 10:50:37.805
MRS. DEMING SEEKS RECOGNITION. 
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 

10:50:37.954 --> 10:50:40.475
WORD. MR. CHAIRMAN I RISE IN 
OPPOSITION TO THIS AMENDMENT. 

10:50:40.694 --> 10:50:46.004
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID WE ARE
USING THE LAW AS A WEAPON. THE 

10:50:46.224 --> 10:50:51.077
LAW IS A WEAPON. AGAINST PEOPLE 
WHO DON'T RESPECT IT AND DON'T 

10:50:51.848 --> 10:50:55.134
OBEY IT. MY REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES HAVE CLAIMED THERE IS

10:50:55.354 --> 10:51:00.674
NOT ENOUGH HERE. TO IMPEACH A 
PRESIDENT. I HAVE HEARD THEM 

10:51:01.448 --> 10:51:06.745
PREVIOUSLY SAY THIS IS MERELY 
ABOUT EIGHT LINES FROM ONE PHONE

10:51:06.884 --> 10:51:10.997
CALL. PERHAPS THEY HAVE 
FORGOTTEN THAT THE PRESSURE 

10:51:11.135 --> 10:51:19.072
AGAINST THE UKRAINE LASTED FOR 
MONTHS. PERHAPS THEY FORGOT THEY

10:51:19.276 --> 10:51:23.846
ARE TRYING TO LIMIT THIS TO 
MERELY EIGHT LINES ON ONE PHONE 

10:51:23.987 --> 10:51:29.414
CALL. UNDERESTIMATES THE RISKS 
TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 

10:51:29.828 --> 10:51:35.214
INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. YOU SEE,
UKRAINE'S ABILITY TO PROTECT 

10:51:35.365 --> 10:51:39.525
THEMSELVES AGAINST RUSSIAN 
AGGRESSION IS DIRECTLY TIED TO 

10:51:40.288 --> 10:51:46.154
OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OURSELVES
FROM RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. THAT'S 

10:51:46.300 --> 10:51:53.644
RIGHT, THIS PRESIDENT ONLY CARES
ABOUT THE BIG STUFF

10:51:57.867 --> 10:52:01.155
. THE BIG STUFF, BIG THINGS THAT
ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO HIS 

10:52:01.295 --> 10:52:07.997
PERSONAL AGENDA. MY COLLEAGUES 
ALSO SEEM TO IGNORE THE PATTERN 

10:52:08.757 --> 10:52:10.757
OF BEHAVIOR.

10:52:13.345 --> 10:52:17.994
THE PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT. 
CERTAINLY THE ABUSE OF POWER. 

10:52:18.403 --> 10:52:20.444
FIRST THE PRESIDENT WELCOMED 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 

10:52:20.595 --> 10:52:25.545
ELECTION. HIS CAMPAIGN HAVE 
MULTIPLE CONTACTS WITH RUSSIA. 

10:52:25.684 --> 10:52:29.325
HE PUBLICLY HIMSELF INVITED 
RUSSIA TO INTERFERE.

10:52:35.856 --> 10:52:37.995
RUSSIA IF YOU ARE LISTENING, 
REMEMBER THIS? I HOPE YOU WERE 

10:52:38.215 --> 10:52:43.284
ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS 
THAT ARE MISSING. THEN AFTER THE

10:52:43.504 --> 10:52:45.213
SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS ASSIGNED TO 
INVESTIGATE THE PRESIDENT'S 

10:52:45.214 --> 10:52:49.704
CONDUCT THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO 
COVER IT UP. BY OBSTRUCTING THE 

10:52:49.906 --> 10:52:52.794
INVESTIGATION, AND REFUSING TO 
COOPERATE. THEN THIS ONE REALLY 

10:52:52.955 --> 10:52:59.414
ADDS AND TAKES THE CAKE. ONE DAY
AFTER THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

10:52:59.556 --> 10:53:02.765
TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ADDED AGAIN.

10:53:09.724 --> 10:53:11.423
APPARENTLY UNDETERMINED AND BOLD
AND. HE DEMANDED INTERFERENCE 

10:53:11.424 --> 10:53:16.294
INTO THE 2020 ELECTIONS. TELLING
A VULNERABLE ALLY, I WOULD LIKE 

10:53:16.514 --> 10:53:25.785
YOU TO DO US A FAVOR. 
CONDITIONED OFFICIAL ACTS ON THE

10:53:25.984 --> 10:53:27.683
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SHAM 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 

10:53:27.684 --> 10:53:32.784
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF POLITICAL 
RIVAL. AND TRUE TO FORM, AFTER 

10:53:32.994 --> 10:53:40.224
THE PRESIDENT SCHEME WAS EXPOSED
AND HE WAS CAUGHT, AND CONGRESS 

10:53:40.444 --> 10:53:44.656
LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION THE 
PRESIDENT TRIED TO COVER IT UP. 

10:53:45.074 --> 10:53:47.074
BY TRYING TO UNDERTAKE A 
COMPLETE BLOCKADE. OF

10:53:52.096 --> 10:53:55.218
THE INVESTIGATION. THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT IS PART ANY 

10:53:55.395 --> 10:53:57.395
PATTERN.

10:54:00.544 --> 10:54:02.460
FIRST THE PRESIDENT INVITES 
FOREIGN POWERS TO INTERFERE IN 

10:54:02.461 --> 10:54:06.284
OUR ELECTION, AND THEN HE 
INSTRUCTS UNLAWFUL INQUIRIES 

10:54:06.497 --> 10:54:12.298
INTO HIS BEHAVIOR. WHETHER BY 
CONGRESS, OR BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

10:54:17.821 --> 10:54:20.814
THEN HE DOES IT AGAIN. REMEMBER 
HE BELIEVES HE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

10:54:21.825 --> 10:54:23.964
HE CERTAINLY HAS THE FULL 
SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE 

10:54:24.736 --> 10:54:27.956
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. MOST 
RECENTLY THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED

10:54:28.163 --> 10:54:31.848
PUBLICLY THAT CHINA, WHY DON'T 
YOU COME ON IN

10:54:37.372 --> 10:54:39.372
. THE WATER IS WARM. CHINA 
SHOULD INTERFERE IN OUR 

10:54:39.514 --> 10:54:42.009
ELECTIONS BY INVESTIGATING 
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

10:54:42.224 --> 10:54:44.781
THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN NO 
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HIS 

10:54:44.984 --> 10:54:46.984
MISCONDUCT. HE HAS SHOWN

10:54:54.847 --> 10:54:56.959
NO REMORSE. WHETHER HE HAS 
DOUBLE DOWN AND MADE CLEAR HE 

10:54:57.177 --> 10:54:59.064
WILL CONTINUE TO SOLICIT 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION FOR

10:54:59.065 --> 10:55:03.066
HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN, NOT THE 
GAIN OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE 

10:55:03.284 --> 10:55:05.209
WILL CONTINUE TO DISREGARD A 
COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. 

10:55:05.210 --> 10:55:10.244
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN CHECK. IN 

10:55:10.464 --> 10:55:14.845
OTHER WORDS UNLESS HE IS STOPPED
THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO 

10:55:15.014 --> 10:55:17.384
ERODE OUR DEMOCRACY.

10:55:20.835 --> 10:55:23.791
AND THE VALUES OF WHICH OUR 
COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED. WE CANNOT 

10:55:23.992 --> 10:55:29.357
AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. MR. CHAIRMAN I YIELD 

10:55:30.114 --> 10:55:33.705
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. RADCLIFFE SEEKS 

10:55:33.854 --> 10:55:41.954
RECOGNITION. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD. THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

10:55:42.108 --> 10:55:44.108
TEXAS. THERE IS A SAYING

10:55:52.664 --> 10:55:54.664
, FAX DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR 
FEELINGS. LET'S GO THROUGH 

10:55:54.786 --> 10:55:56.693
FACTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AND HOW 

10:55:56.694 --> 10:55:58.694
MUCH THEY ACTUALLY HAVE 
COOPERATED WITH CONGRESS. IN A 

10:55:59.144 --> 10:56:04.344
REPORT, THE SCHIFF REPORT, HE 
ARGUED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

10:56:04.494 --> 10:56:08.345
OBSTRUCTED THE IMPEACHMENT 
INQUIRY.  AND LETTER SENT TO 

10:56:08.554 --> 10:56:10.554
REQUEST DEPOSITION WITNESSES 
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF WROTE 

10:56:15.796 --> 10:56:17.683
, ANY FAILURE TO APPEAR FOR 
SCHEDULED DEPOSITIONS SHALL 

10:56:17.684 --> 10:56:19.684
CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF 
OBSTRUCTION OF THE HOUSES 

10:56:19.718 --> 10:56:22.414
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. END QUOTE. 
HOWEVER, THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE

10:56:23.414 --> 10:56:25.343
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION 
COMPLYING WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL

10:56:25.344 --> 10:56:27.344
OVERSIGHT

10:56:32.424 --> 10:56:34.345
IN THE INVESTIGATIONS DURING 
2017 AND 2018. EVEN WITH 

10:56:34.346 --> 10:56:35.853
CONGRESSIONAL PROBES THE 
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT FIND 

10:56:35.854 --> 10:56:39.284
LEGITIMATE. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 25
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 

10:56:39.695 --> 10:56:41.695
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE 
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

10:56:47.155 --> 10:56:48.833
. OVER 20 ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS TESTIFIED BEFORE THE 

10:56:48.834 --> 10:56:50.834
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
ADDITIONALLY

10:56:54.414 --> 10:56:56.303
AS THE START OF THE DEMOCRAT 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THE 

10:56:56.304 --> 10:56:58.534
ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED MORE
THAN 100,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS.

10:56:58.902 --> 10:57:00.603
TO THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT 
COMMITTEE. THAT'S OVER 100,000 

10:57:00.604 --> 10:57:02.604
PAGES OF DOCUMENTS.

10:57:11.734 --> 10:57:14.064
THEY WERE PRODUCED IN A TIMELY 
MANNER. THEY DID NOT DUMP THEM 

10:57:14.288 --> 10:57:16.288
WITHIN 48 HOURS OF THE HEARING. 
I DIGRESS. THE ADMINISTRATION 

10:57:16.365 --> 10:57:17.853
ALSO ENGAGED IN THE 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY 

10:57:17.854 --> 10:57:20.235
DISAGREE WITH. THE HOUSE 
OVERSIGHT DEMOCRATS INITIATE A 

10:57:20.451 --> 10:57:22.494
SWEEPING INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
WHITE HOUSE SECURITY CLEARANCE 

10:57:22.634 --> 10:57:24.634
PRACTICES.

10:57:35.454 --> 10:57:37.120
DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S BROAD 
AUTHORITY TO GRANT SECURITY 

10:57:37.121 --> 10:57:38.816
CLEARANCES TO WHOMEVER THE 
ADMINISTRATION WISHES. IN THAT 

10:57:38.817 --> 10:57:40.513
INVESTIGATION THE ADMINISTRATION
PROVIDED THE CURRENT WHITE HOUSE

10:57:40.514 --> 10:57:42.684
CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER TO BRIEF 
BOTH MEMBERS AND STAFF THE WHITE

10:57:42.901 --> 10:57:44.901
HOUSE SECURITY CLEARANCE 
PROCESS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS 

10:57:44.928 --> 10:57:49.414
ALSO PROVIDING REVIEWS OF OVER 
500 PAGES WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS.

10:57:53.154 --> 10:57:55.043
RELATED TO THE SECURITY 
CLEARANCE PROCESS. THE FBI HAS 

10:57:55.044 --> 10:57:56.756
ALLOWED COMMUNITY STAFF TO 
REVIEW HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS 

10:57:56.757 --> 10:58:01.425
PERTAINING TO THE ROLE THE WHITE
HOUSE SECURITY CLEARANCE PLAYED 

10:58:01.836 --> 10:58:03.836
AND BRIEFED BOTH MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMUNITY STAFF

10:58:08.004 --> 10:58:10.004
, AND PROVIDED COMMUNITY STAFF 
WITH MULTIPLE FALL OUT BRIEFINGS

10:58:10.136 --> 10:58:15.005
REGARDING THEIR OWN INTERNAL 
SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS. 

10:58:15.414 --> 10:58:17.594
WE'VE HEARD DEMOCRATS TALK THIS 
EVENING ABOUT THE BORDER.

10:58:28.114 --> 10:58:31.825
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED 
MORE THAN 9600 DOCUMENTS.

10:59:17.669 --> 10:59:21.252
LET'S JUST CONTRAST THAT WITH 
THE DEMOCRATS' COMBATIVE 

10:59:21.466 --> 10:59:25.422
POSTURE. IN LETTERS TO THE STATE
DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES, THE 

10:59:30.424 --> 10:59:33.076
COMMITTEE THREATENED WITNESSES 
THAT AND I, QUOTE, ANY FAILURE 

10:59:33.221 --> 10:59:35.565
TO APPEAR, ANY FAILURE TO APPEAR
IN RESPONSE TO A MERE LETTER 

10:59:35.803 --> 10:59:40.461
REQUESTING THEIR PRESENTS FOR 
DEPOSITION SHALL AND I, QUOTE, 

10:59:40.597 --> 10:59:42.597
CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF 
OBSTRUCTION. THIS IS JUST 

10:59:45.683 --> 10:59:47.212
LETTERS NOT SUBPOENAS. IN 
LETTERS THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

10:59:47.213 --> 10:59:49.213
EMPLOYEES AND LETTERS TO THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES THE 

10:59:49.407 --> 10:59:51.609
COMMITTEE THREATENED WITNESSES 
THAT IF THEY INSIST ON HAVING 

10:59:51.859 --> 10:59:53.859
AGENCY COUNSEL PRESENT TO 
PROTECT 

10:59:58.206 --> 11:00:02.819
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IN A 
CONFIDENTIALITY INTEREST OR IF 

11:00:03.043 --> 11:00:05.071
THEY MAKE ANY EFFORT TO PROTECT 
CONFIDENTIALITY INTERESTS AT 

11:00:05.295 --> 11:00:08.448
ALL, THESE OFFICIALS WILL HAVE 
THEIR SALARIES WITHHELD. 

11:00:08.589 --> 11:00:10.589
WITHHOLDING 

11:00:13.453 --> 11:00:15.453
OF SALARIES. THE COMMITTEE

11:00:21.655 --> 11:00:23.628
S HAVE NOT AFFORDED THE 
PRESIDENT BASIC PROTECTIONS SUCH

11:00:23.629 --> 11:00:25.823
AS THE RIGHT TO SEE ALL 
EVIDENCE, THE RIGHT TO PRESENT 

11:00:26.041 --> 11:00:28.041
EVIDENCE, THE RIGHT TO CALL 
WITNESSES, THE RIGHT TO HAVE 

11:00:28.265 --> 11:00:30.265
COUNSEL PRESENT AT HEARINGS, THE
RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE ALL 

11:00:30.275 --> 11:00:32.076
WITNESSES, THE RIGHT TO MAKE 
OBJECTIONS RELATING TO 

11:00:32.077 --> 11:00:34.077
EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES, OR THE
ADMISSIBILITY OF TESTIMONY AND 

11:00:34.095 --> 11:00:36.575
EVIDENCE AND DID NOT AFFORD THE 
PRESIDENT THE RIGHT TO RESPOND 

11:00:37.256 --> 11:00:39.963
TO EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY 
PRESENTED. THANK YOU. I'LL YIELD

11:00:40.107 --> 11:00:44.759
THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 

11:00:44.935 --> 11:00:46.981
WHAT PURPOSE DOES MR. SWALWELL 
SEEK RECOGNITION? 

11:00:46.982 --> 11:00:50.557
&gt;&gt; TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT IS

11:00:50.777 --> 11:00:54.155
THE GRAVE RISK THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL AGAIN ABUSE HIS 

11:00:55.463 --> 11:00:57.463
POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO TRY 
AND 

11:01:00.427 --> 11:01:02.427
SECURE HIS REELECTION. WE HAVE 
REASON TO BE CONCERNED. THE 

11:01:02.675 --> 11:01:07.120
PRESIDENCY GIVES HIM GREAT 
POWERS TO CAUSE OTHERS TO 

11:01:07.261 --> 11:01:09.913
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. AND 
THE ONLY PROTECTION WE HAVE IS 

11:01:10.242 --> 11:01:16.456
TO ACT NOW. BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT IS CHEATING RIGHT NOW.

11:01:16.602 --> 11:01:20.185
AND TO ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO 
ASK WHY MOVE ON THIS RIGHT NOW, 

11:01:20.400 --> 11:01:22.400
IT'S A CRIME 

11:01:24.475 --> 11:01:26.215
SPREE IN PROGRESS. AND AS 
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF SAID EARLIER 

11:01:26.216 --> 11:01:31.488
THIS WEEK, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED 
TO DO? JUST LET HIM CHEAT ONE 

11:01:31.710 --> 11:01:34.841
MORE TIME? EXPECT HIM TO 
EVENTUALLY DO THE RIGHT THING? 

11:01:34.984 --> 11:01:39.401
AND HERE'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUES' 
LOGIC AMOUNTS TO IF WE WAIT. IT 

11:01:40.791 --> 11:01:45.262
AMOUNTS TO THIS. ALLOW THE 
BUILDING TO BURN, COLLAPSE, FALL

11:01:45.946 --> 11:01:50.872
TO THE GROUND AND THEN YOU 
SHOULD CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

11:01:51.016 --> 11:01:53.016
THIS PRESIDENT HAS SET OUR 

11:01:57.467 --> 11:02:00.166
DEMOCRACY ON FIRE. AND WE MUST 
ACT TO SAVE IT. AND THERE'S AN 

11:02:02.789 --> 11:02:04.744
URGENCY TO ACT. AND THIS 
PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY BEING 

11:02:04.745 --> 11:02:09.175
IMPEACHED BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAS
DONE. IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT HE 

11:02:14.187 --> 11:02:16.187
CONTINUES TO DO.

11:02:20.773 --> 11:02:22.666
WE KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE. NOT 
REALLY DISPUTED. ABUSED HIS 

11:02:22.667 --> 11:02:24.368
POWER. ASKED A FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT TO HELP HIM CHEAT. 

11:02:24.369 --> 11:02:25.750
JEOPARDIZING OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY, INTEGRITY OF OUR 

11:02:25.751 --> 11:02:30.288
ELECTIONS FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL 
GAIN. BUT THIS WAS NOT A ONE 

11:02:30.506 --> 11:02:32.506
OFF. WE'VE COME TO LEARN AS MS. 
DEMINGS JUST EXPLAINED, THIS IS 

11:02:32.753 --> 11:02:37.473
WHAT HE DOES. AND THIS IS WHAT 
HE WILL KEEP  DOING. IN 2016 AS 

11:02:37.693 --> 11:02:39.693
HE SAID, RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE 
LISTENING, PACK MY OPPONENTS 

11:02:39.752 --> 11:02:43.384
E-MAILS. YOU'LL BE REWARDED. 
TURNS OUT, RUSSIA WAS LISTENING.

11:02:43.526 --> 11:02:45.526
TURNS OUT, RUSSIA HACKED 

11:02:48.618 --> 11:02:50.618
HIS OPPONENTS E-MAILS. THAT DAY 
THEY SOUGHT TO PACK 

11:02:53.809 --> 11:02:55.679
HIS OPPONENTS E-MAILS. IN THAT 
INVESTIGATION HE WENT TO GREAT 

11:02:55.680 --> 11:02:59.972
LENGTHS TO OBSTRUCT IT. SO WHY 
IS IT SO URGENT THAT WE ACT 

11:03:00.190 --> 11:03:05.553
RIGHT NOW? THE PRESIDENT'S 
LAWYER WAS JUST IN UKRAINE. THE 

11:03:05.694 --> 11:03:10.586
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER SAID IN MAY, 
I'M NOT MEDDLING IN AN ELECTION.

11:03:10.750 --> 11:03:15.217
WE, NOT I, WE DONALD TRUMP AND 
I, OR MEDDLING IN AN 

11:03:15.898 --> 11:03:20.026
INVESTIGATION. AND THAT MEDDLING
CONTINUES TODAY. BUT THE 

11:03:20.175 --> 11:03:23.742
PRESIDENT'S OWN WORDS TELL US 
ABOUT HIS CURRENT INTENT. ON 

11:03:23.884 --> 11:03:25.884
OCTOBER 2nd, 

11:03:29.502 --> 11:03:31.502
THE PRESIDENT SAID,

11:03:39.916 --> 11:03:41.916
AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN 
INVESTIGATING ON A PERSONAL 

11:03:42.318 --> 11:03:44.318
BASIS THROUGH RUDY AND OTHERS 
CORRUPTION IN THE 2016 ELECTION.

11:03:44.441 --> 11:03:47.137
I THINK THAT IF WE ARE HONEST 
ABOUT IT THEY SHOULD START A 

11:03:47.371 --> 11:03:48.906
MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
BIDENS. THAT SIMPLE. ON OCTOBER 

11:03:48.907 --> 11:03:51.202
3rd, THE PRESIDENT STOOD ON THE 
WHITE HOUSE LAWN AND CONFIRMED 

11:03:51.425 --> 11:03:55.146
THAT HE WANTED UKRAINE TO 
INVESTIGATE THE BIDENS. BUT THEN

11:03:55.297 --> 11:03:57.297
HE ADDED A COUNTRY BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. RUSSIA, 

11:03:57.387 --> 11:04:02.009
UKRAINE, HE SAID CHINA SHOULD 
ALSO INVESTIGATE THE BIDENS. MY 

11:04:02.160 --> 11:04:04.456
COLLEAGUES, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE 
TO HOPE OR PRAY THAT CHINA 

11:04:04.710 --> 11:04:08.088
WASN'T LISTENING WHEN HE SAID 
THAT. BUT FORTUNATELY, PEOPLE ON

11:04:08.772 --> 11:04:10.772
THIS 

11:04:13.373 --> 11:04:14.575
COMMITTEE ARE LISTENING. 
AMERICANS ARE LISTENING. PEOPLE 

11:04:14.576 --> 11:04:19.610
WHO KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG, OUR 
CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. ARE YOU 

11:04:20.922 --> 11:04:22.922
LISTENING? AND 

11:04:24.955 --> 11:04:27.408
WHAT WE HEAR DEEPLY CONCERNS US 
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL DO

11:04:27.623 --> 11:04:31.068
NEXT. AND WE ARE NOT HELPLESS. 
IN FACT, WE KNOW THAT THE 

11:04:35.202 --> 11:04:37.657
COURAGE TO ACT IS THE ONLY THING
THAT HAS STOPPED THIS PRESIDENT.

11:04:37.798 --> 11:04:40.422
THAT'S NOT A LEAP OF FAITH. YOU 
SEE, IT WAS THE COURAGE OF DR. 

11:04:40.644 --> 11:04:44.069
FIONA HILL AND LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL VINDMAN TO, QUOTE, GO TO

11:04:45.205 --> 11:04:48.487
THE LAWYERS, WHEN THEY HEARD 
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

11:04:48.708 --> 11:04:50.708
CONDITIONING A WHITE HOUSE VISIT
FOR INVESTIGATIONS. IT WAS THE 

11:04:50.735 --> 11:04:55.725
COURAGE OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER TO 
COME FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT GOT 

11:04:55.942 --> 11:04:57.942
UKRAINE THE AIDE. THE PRESIDENT 
GOT CAUGHT. THEN UKRAINE GOT THE

11:04:57.988 --> 11:05:01.591
AIDE. IF THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOT  
COURAGEOUS, AND ACTED, UKRAINE 

11:05:01.807 --> 11:05:07.398
WOULD NOT HAVE THE AIDE TODAY. 
SO WE MUST FOLLOW THEIR 

11:05:10.796 --> 11:05:13.650
PATTERN CONDUCT. AND ACT. WE 
HAVE PATTERN EVIDENCE THAT NOT 

11:05:16.356 --> 11:05:18.327
ONLY DONALD TRUMP ASKED 
CORRUPTLY, BUT THAT WHEN YOU 

11:05:18.328 --> 11:05:20.975
SHOW COURAGE AND ACT AGAINST 
HIM, YOU CAN STOP HIM. IT'S 

11:05:21.670 --> 11:05:24.240
ACTUALLY THE ONLY WAY TO 
EXTINGUISH HIS 

11:05:28.920 --> 11:05:30.696
CORRUPT WAYS. IF UNCHECKED, MY 
COLLEAGUES, DONALD TRUMP DOES 

11:05:30.697 --> 11:05:32.697
NOT GET 

11:05:34.986 --> 11:05:36.979
BETTER. HE GETS WORSE. HE GETS 
MORE CORRUPT. AND WE CAN'T WAIT 

11:05:36.980 --> 11:05:42.128
TILL THE NEXT ELECTION TO HOLD 
HIM ACCOUNTABLE. NOT WHEN HE IS 

11:05:42.345 --> 11:05:44.821
TRYING TO RIG THE NEXT ELECTION.
SO WE MUST ACT. TO PROTECT 

11:05:49.832 --> 11:05:53.740
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, THE 
INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS AND 

11:05:53.962 --> 11:05:55.552
HONOR OUR OATH TO THE 
CONSTITUTION. YIELD BACK. 

11:05:55.553 --> 11:05:57.553
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS ON THE 
AMENDMENT. THOSE IN FAVOR SAY 

11:05:57.588 --> 11:05:58.917
HI. 
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE SOMEONE ASKING FOR 

11:05:58.918 --> 11:06:00.663
TIME. 
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SEE A REQUEST. 

11:06:00.664 --> 11:06:02.664
&gt;&gt; YOU 

11:06:06.829 --> 11:06:08.831
STOPPED. NOW RECOGNIZING IT. 
YOU'VE NOW RECOGNIZED IT. 

11:06:08.832 --> 11:06:10.832
&gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE MR. GATES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. MOVE TO STRIKE THE

11:06:10.841 --> 11:06:12.841
LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THE 

11:06:16.764 --> 11:06:19.012
GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED.
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE RIGHT. THEY CAN'T 

11:06:19.211 --> 11:06:21.468
WAIT BUT IT'S NOT THE REASON 
THEY SAY. THE REASON THEY CAN'T 

11:06:21.684 --> 11:06:24.028
WAIT TILL THE NEXT ELECTION IS 
BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT 

11:06:24.245 --> 11:06:26.240
THEIR CANDIDATE FIELD AND THEY 
HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED EVERY

11:06:26.241 --> 11:06:29.927
STANDARD THAT THEY'VE SET FOR 
THEMSELVES FOR IMPEACHMENT FOR 

11:06:30.140 --> 11:06:31.893
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHETHER YOU
LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP OR DON'T 

11:06:31.894 --> 11:06:34.868
LIKE TRUMP, IT WOULD AT LEAST BE
WORTH ACKNOWLEDGING THE 

11:06:35.088 --> 11:06:37.949
DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED THE 
GOALPOST ON WHAT IT WOULD 

11:06:38.168 --> 11:06:40.819
REQUIRE TO BRING US TO THIS 
POINT. AND TO HARM OUR NATION 

11:06:41.120 --> 11:06:44.171
AND TO DISTRACT US SO MUCH FROM 
THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF AMERICAN 

11:06:44.604 --> 11:06:47.284
PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY WONDER WHY 
WE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON THEM RIGHT

11:06:47.929 --> 11:06:49.929
NOW. FIRST THEY TOLD US IT HAS 

11:06:54.485 --> 11:06:56.485
TO BE BIPARTISAN.

11:07:03.286 --> 11:07:05.404
I GET FOLKS WATCHING AT HOME 
MIGHT THINK THAT I'M SOMEBODY 

11:07:05.617 --> 11:07:07.927
WHO REALLY LIKES THE PRESIDENT 
AND I WOULD PROBABLY BE A HARD 

11:07:08.132 --> 11:07:10.132
VOTE FOR HIM TO GET FOR 
IMPEACHMENT. BUT IT'S NOT JUST 

11:07:10.263 --> 11:07:12.007
THEY CAN'T CONVINCE THE 
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS NOT TO 

11:07:12.008 --> 11:07:13.738
ABANDON HIM. THEY CAN'T EVEN 
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT'S CRITICS

11:07:13.739 --> 11:07:17.413
TO ABANDON HIM. JEFF BEN TRUE, 
COLLIN PETERSON, TWO MEMBERS OF 

11:07:17.720 --> 11:07:19.911
CONGRESS, TWO DEMOCRATS, THEY 
ARE NOT FANS OF THE PRESIDENT. 

11:07:20.055 --> 11:07:22.336
THERE CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT. 
YET THEY DIDN'T VOTE WITH 

11:07:23.644 --> 11:07:27.748
DEMOCRATS. THEY VOTED WITH 
REPUBLICANS. WE'VE EVEN GOT SOME

11:07:27.976 --> 11:07:29.844
REPUBLICANS. MY COLLEAGUE WILL 
HURD FROM TEXAS DOESN'T MIND 

11:07:29.845 --> 11:07:32.186
BEING A CRITIC OF THE PRESIDENT.
HE WAS HONEST WITH DEMOCRATS. HE

11:07:32.332 --> 11:07:36.215
TOLD THEM THIS IS NOT 
IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT. THEY TOLD 

11:07:36.394 --> 11:07:40.114
US THAT THE PROCESS WOULD BE 
FAIR. AND YET WHEN EVEN MEMBERS 

11:07:42.606 --> 11:07:44.724
OF THIS COMMITTEE SOUGHT THE 
OPPORTUNITY NOT TO READ A 

11:07:44.976 --> 11:07:47.697
TRANSCRIPT OR SEE SOMEONE'S 
SECOND PERFORMANCE OF 

11:07:52.706 --> 11:07:55.821
THEIR TESTIMONY BUT TO SEE THEIR
FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT, HOW THEY 

11:07:56.054 --> 11:07:58.054
REACTED, HOW THEY WERE 
BREATHING, DID THEY FIDGET WHEN 

11:07:58.205 --> 11:08:00.598
THEY RESPONDED, WE WANTED TO SEE
THOSE THINGS AND WE WERE 

11:08:00.897 --> 11:08:02.567
EXCLUDED BY THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE. DEMOCRATS SAID THAT 

11:08:02.568 --> 11:08:04.885
TO PUT OUR COUNTRY THROUGH THIS 
WOULD REQUIRE COMPELLING 

11:08:09.892 --> 11:08:11.892
AND OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE.

11:08:14.003 --> 11:08:16.589
AND EACH AND EVERY TIME THEY 
TRIED TO CAST DOUBT ON THE 

11:08:16.824 --> 11:08:19.230
PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT, WE ARE ABLE
TO SHOW A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THE

11:08:19.375 --> 11:08:21.533
PRESIDENT HAD IN CORRUPTION. WE 
ARE ABLE TO CITE THE TRANSCRIPT 

11:08:21.763 --> 11:08:23.572
THAT DEMONSTRATES NO 
CONDITIONALITY AND TIME AND 

11:08:23.573 --> 11:08:25.324
AGAIN DEMOCRATS' SAY THERE'S 
JUST NO FACTUAL DEBATE ABOUT 

11:08:25.325 --> 11:08:29.696
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID. THE 
FACTUAL DEBATE COMES FROM 

11:08:29.922 --> 11:08:31.560
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY SAID I WASN'T PRESSURED

11:08:31.561 --> 11:08:35.887
AND THEY SAID ZELENSKY MIGHT NOT
HAVE KNOWN. SONDLAND TALKED AND 

11:08:36.336 --> 11:08:38.336
CONVEYED THIS 

11:08:40.265 --> 11:08:42.047
SHAKEDOWN. AND THE VERY DAY THEY
INTRODUCED ARTICLES OF 

11:08:42.048 --> 11:08:46.174
IMPEACHMENT, HE GIVES AN 
INTERVIEW AND SAYS WE NEVER 

11:08:48.339 --> 11:08:50.790
REALLY PERCEIVED THIS AS AN 
EXCHANGE OF MILITARY FOR AID FOR

11:08:55.803 --> 11:08:57.803
ANY ONE THING.

11:09:01.443 --> 11:09:04.216
TIME AND AGAIN THEY LET US DOWN 
IN THEIR CLAIMS BUT ONE THING WE

11:09:04.436 --> 11:09:06.923
KNOW FOR CERTAIN, IS THAT THIS 
WAS A SAD INEVITABILITY. I HAD 

11:09:07.072 --> 11:09:09.502
SOMEONE ASKED ME RECENTLY DO YOU
FEEL SOME SENSE OF HISTORY, SOME

11:09:09.718 --> 11:09:11.781
SENSE OF MOMENT THAT YOU'RE 
ABOUT TO VOTE ON IMPEACHMENT? 

11:09:11.927 --> 11:09:13.973
SADLY I KNEW THIS TIME WAS 
COMING SINCE THE DEMOCRATS TOOK 

11:09:14.194 --> 11:09:15.983
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE THEY 

11:09:15.984 --> 11:09:18.294
DIDN'T LAY OUT A PLAN TO 
APPROPRIATE FOR THE BUDGET, WORK

11:09:18.523 --> 11:09:21.860
WITH US ON CRITICAL GENERATIONAL
ISSUES, THEY SET OUT A PLAN FOR 

11:09:22.092 --> 11:09:24.092
IMPEACHMENT. HOW DO 

11:09:27.035 --> 11:09:29.110
WE KNOW THAT? WHEN THE CHAIRMAN 
HIMSELF CAMPAIGNED FOR THE LEAD 

11:09:29.330 --> 11:09:31.661
DEMOCRAT ROLE ON THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, HE DIDN'T SAY PICK ME

11:09:31.804 --> 11:09:33.804
BECAUSE I'M A GREAT LEGISLATOR 
AROUND SOME PARTICULAR ISSUE 

11:09:34.191 --> 11:09:38.603
SET. HE SAID PICK ME BECAUSE I 
WILL BE THE PERSON THAT CAN BEST

11:09:38.817 --> 11:09:40.484
LEAD OUR CAUCUS THROUGH A 
POTENTIAL IMPEACHMENT. THEY'VE 

11:09:40.485 --> 11:09:42.485
HAD A BLOODLUST FOR IMPEACHMENT.
IT HAS 

11:09:46.610 --> 11:09:48.606
BEEN THEIR OBSESSION. AND IT'S 
DEEPLY SADDENING TO US. WE TAKE 

11:09:48.607 --> 11:09:51.083
ABSOLUTELY NO JOY IN THE FACT 
THAT IT IS SO CONSUMING. BUT 

11:09:51.224 --> 11:09:54.589
HERE WE STAND ON THE VERGE OF 
IT. AND MY EXPECTATION IS THAT 

11:09:54.805 --> 11:10:02.104
THIS NEW STANDARD IN THE SECOND 
ARTICLE WITH JUST THE NOTION OF 

11:10:02.320 --> 11:10:04.320
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS IS THEIR
EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO 

11:10:04.940 --> 11:10:08.326
PROVE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. 
PUBLIC REPORTING HAS BEEN THE 

11:10:08.542 --> 11:10:11.262
CHAIRMAN WENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC 
CAUCUS AND SOUGHT SUPPORT TO 

11:10:11.698 --> 11:10:14.952
BRING AN ARTICLE FOR OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE AND COULDN'T GET 

11:10:15.169 --> 11:10:17.083
THEIR SUPPORT. NOW HERE WE ARE 
WITH OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. 

11:10:17.084 --> 11:10:19.241
THE LOW-ENERGY VERSION OF THE 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CLAIM 

11:10:24.243 --> 11:10:26.608
THAT THEY WANTED.
THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO BE

11:10:26.769 --> 11:10:30.077
ABLE TO CONVICT AND ACCUSE AND 
EVIDENCE SOME CLAIM ON BRIBERY. 

11:10:30.220 --> 11:10:32.269
THAT'S WHAT THEIR POLLSTERS AND 
PUNDITS TOLD THEM WOULD BE BEST 

11:10:32.487 --> 11:10:36.351
AS THEY SOLEMNLY TELL US THIS IS
SAID TO THEM. THEY 

11:10:41.079 --> 11:10:45.449
WERE OUT PULLING WHAT LEXICON, 
WHAT WORD CHOICE WOULD HELP THEM

11:10:45.667 --> 11:10:48.066
MAKE THE CASE TO THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC AND SO THEY SET ON 

11:10:48.282 --> 11:10:50.505
BRIBERY, YOU ALL IN THE MEDIA 
HEARD IT. YOU HEARD THEM ON 

11:10:50.723 --> 11:10:54.625
EVERY SHOW TALKING ABOUT THIS IS
THE NEW STANDARD. SPEAKER PELOSI

11:10:54.803 --> 11:10:56.953
SPEAKING THIS LANGUAGE AND WE 
ASKED THE WITNESSES DID YOU SEE 

11:10:57.164 --> 11:10:58.959
BRIBERY? AND THE EVIDENCE WASN'T
THERE. SO INSTEAD OF BRIBERY, 

11:10:58.960 --> 11:11:00.960
INSTEAD OF TREASON, 

11:11:05.941 --> 11:11:09.493
EXTORTION, YOU HAVE ABUSE OF 
POWER. THE LOW-ENERGY VERSION. 

11:11:09.632 --> 11:11:11.046
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MY 
COLLEAGUES. BUT PROBABLY EVEN 

11:11:11.047 --> 11:11:12.999
THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD SHARE THAT 

11:11:13.000 --> 11:11:14.657
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS VERY 
MOMENT. AND I YIELD BACK. 

11:11:14.658 --> 11:11:16.658
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMEN YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A UNANIMOUS CONSENT 

11:11:17.069 --> 11:11:19.069
REQUEST. 
&gt;&gt; I 

11:11:22.066 --> 11:11:26.117
RECOGNIZE MR. RESCHENTHALER FOR 
THE PURPOSE. 

11:11:26.118 --> 11:11:28.052
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I

ENGEL SAYS OFFICIALS WHO INSIST 

11:11:33.815 --> 11:11:36.696
ON COUNSEL WILL HAVE THEIR 
SALARY -- 

11:11:36.697 --> 11:11:37.553
&gt;&gt; OBJECTION. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

11:11:37.554 --> 11:11:41.515
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION NOW OCCURS ON 
THE AMENDMENT. THOSE IN FAVOR, 

11:11:41.656 --> 11:11:44.227
SAY AYE. THOSE OPPOSED, NO. IN 
THE OPINION 

11:11:48.908 --> 11:11:51.564

DIDN'T KNOW AID WAS HELD UP AT 
THE TIME OF THE CALL BY THE 

11:15:00.798 --> 11:15:02.798
DEMOCRATS ASSERT THAT 

11:15:06.246 --> 11:15:09.005
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRESSURING 
ZELENSKY ON THE CALL TO 

11:15:09.221 --> 11:15:11.850
INVESTIGATE THE BUTTONS IN ORDER
TO GET THE AID THAT HE DIDN'T 

11:15:11.989 --> 11:15:14.464
EVEN KNOW WAS ON HOLD. THAT'S 
THEIR ARGUMENT. AND BY THE WAY, 

11:15:14.678 --> 11:15:17.370
DOWN THE ROAD PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
SAID THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ON 

11:15:21.870 --> 11:15:23.644
THE CALL. NO PUSHING. NO LINKAGE
WHATSOEVER. BUT YOU HAVE A 

11:15:23.645 --> 11:15:25.773
RIGGED AND RUSHED PROCESS WHEN 
YOU DON'T HAVE THE FACTS. YOU 

11:15:25.918 --> 11:15:28.228
HAVE A RIGGED AND RUSHED PROCESS
WHEN YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THE WILL 

11:15:28.369 --> 11:15:30.705
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SPEAKER 
OF 

11:15:35.721 --> 11:15:40.141
THE HOUSE PELOSI, NANCY PELOSI 
CALLED THE PRESIDENT AN IMPOSTER

11:15:40.281 --> 11:15:42.259
JUST THREE WEEKS AGO. THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED 

11:15:42.260 --> 11:15:44.850
THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'VE BEEN UP 

11:15:45.320 --> 11:15:47.549
TO GET THIS PRESIDENT SINCE EVEN
BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED. AND OF 

11:15:47.738 --> 11:15:49.836
COURSE YOU HAVE A RIGGED AND 
RUSHED PROCESS WHEN YOU'RE 

11:15:50.067 --> 11:15:52.500
AFRAID THAT YOU CAN'T BEAT THE 
PRESIDENT AT THE BALLOT BOX. 

11:15:52.640 --> 11:15:54.640
WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT 

11:15:58.609 --> 11:16:00.609
NEXT FALL'S ELECTION.

11:16:06.579 --> 11:16:08.984
YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF PROCESS. A
RIGGED AND RUSHED PROCESS. THIS 

11:16:09.129 --> 11:16:11.251
IS NOT ABOUT THE CONCERN. THIS 
IS NOT ABOUT THE CONCERN MR. 

11:16:11.486 --> 11:16:13.486
SWALWELL TALKED ABOUT THAT 
SOMEHOW THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING 

11:16:13.863 --> 11:16:16.102
TO DO SOMETHING WRONG AND TRY TO
INFLUENCE THE ELECTION. THIS IS 

11:16:16.294 --> 11:16:18.605
ABOUT THEIR CONCERN THAT THEY 
CAN'T WIN NEXT YEAR BASED ON 

11:16:18.837 --> 11:16:20.837
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED IN 

11:16:25.678 --> 11:16:27.678
THE PAST THREE YEARS.

11:16:31.678 --> 11:16:33.742
IT'S AN AMAZING RECORD IN SPITE 
OF THE DEMOCRATS BEING 

11:16:33.974 --> 11:16:35.976
COMPLETELY AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
AND DESPITE OF THE MAINSTREAM 

11:16:36.120 --> 11:16:38.627
PRESS BEING AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT, IN IN SPITE OF A FEW 

11:16:38.865 --> 11:16:40.650
REPUBLICANS IT'S AMAZING WHAT'S 
BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. TAXES HAVE 

11:16:40.651 --> 11:16:42.651
BEEN CUT, REGULATIONS REDUCED, 
THE ECONOMY GROWING AT AN 

11:16:42.680 --> 11:16:44.010
UNBELIEVABLE RATE. LOWEST 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN 50 YEARS. 

11:16:44.011 --> 11:16:45.720
266,000 JOBS ADDED LAST MONTH 
ALONE. 54,000 IN THE 

11:16:45.721 --> 11:16:47.665
MANUFACTURING SECTOR. MR. 
GORSUCH, MR. KAVANAUGH ON THE 

11:16:47.666 --> 11:16:49.666
COURT. A LOT 

11:16:52.042 --> 11:16:54.119
OF OTHER JUDGES CONFIRMED. OUT 
OF THE IRAN DEAL, EMPATHY 

11:16:54.354 --> 11:16:56.354
JERUSALEM, HOSTAGES HOME FROM 
NORTH KOREA, NEW NAFTA 

11:16:59.002 --> 11:17:01.002
AGREEMENT NEXT WEEK. YOU GUYS, 
IT'S A RIGGED, RUSHED PROCESS 

11:17:01.117 --> 11:17:05.422
BECAUSE YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT 
NEXT NOVEMBER. MR. GREEN SAYS WE

11:17:05.665 --> 11:17:08.145
HAVE TO IMPEACH HIM BECAUSE HE'S
GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION. WE 

11:17:08.287 --> 11:17:10.287
KNOW WHAT 

11:17:12.006 --> 11:17:14.006
THIS IS ABOUT. THINK 

11:17:17.936 --> 11:17:20.094
ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT. THINK 
ABOUT THIS IS WHY THE AMERICAN 

11:17:20.329 --> 11:17:22.856
PEOPLE LIKE HIM SO MUCH IS 
BECAUSE HE'S DOING WHAT HE SAID 

11:17:23.249 --> 11:17:25.249
HE WOULD DO. EVERY PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION I'VE BEEN ABLE TO 

11:17:25.383 --> 11:17:28.432
PARTICIPATE IN BOTH CANDIDATES, 
REPUBLICAN AND 

11:17:28.579 --> 11:17:31.163
DEMOCRAT, CANDIDATES WHEN THEY 
CAMPAIGN FOR THE 

11:17:35.075 --> 11:17:38.209
JOB THEY TELL THE COUNTRY IF YOU
ELECT ME I'M GOING TO MOVE THE 

11:17:38.456 --> 11:17:39.725
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. THEY 

11:17:39.726 --> 11:17:42.300
CAMPAIGN ON IT. THEN THEY GET 
ELECTED AND THEY COME UP WITH A 

11:17:42.535 --> 11:17:45.165
MILLION REASONS WHY THEY CAN'T 
DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE 

11:17:45.398 --> 11:17:47.436
GOING TO DO. WHAT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ELECTED THEM TO DO. AND 

11:17:47.594 --> 11:17:51.626
THEY NEVER GET IT DONE BY THIS 
PRESIDENT SAID I'M GOING TO DO 

11:17:53.028 --> 11:17:55.238
IT EVEN THOUGH THE SAME PEOPLE, 
THE SAME INTERAGENCY CONSENSUS 

11:17:55.408 --> 11:17:58.785
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT OVER 
THE LAST THREE 

11:18:02.264 --> 11:18:04.264
MONTHS IN THIS IMPEACHMENT 
INQUIRY, EVEN THOUGH THAT SAME 

11:18:04.391 --> 11:18:06.277
INTERAGENCY CONSENSUS WAS 
PROBABLY AGAINST HIM ON THAT 

11:18:06.278 --> 11:18:08.981
MOVE, THIS PRESIDENT SAID I'M 
GOING TO DO IT. AND IT'S BEEN A 

11:18:09.211 --> 11:18:12.111
GOOD THING. AND THAT'S WHAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE APPRECIATE. AND 

11:18:12.250 --> 11:18:14.503
THAT'S WHY WE GOT THIS RIGGED 
AND RUSHED PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S 

11:18:15.196 --> 11:18:17.196
REALLY 

11:18:20.207 --> 11:18:22.207
ABOUT NEXT NOVEMBER.

11:18:24.021 --> 11:18:26.402
THEY ARE ALL AFRAID. SOME OF 
THEIR COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID IT 

11:18:26.542 --> 11:18:28.787
STRAIGHT UP. THEY'RE ALL AFRAID.
THAT THEY CAN'T BEAT HIM AT THE 

11:18:29.015 --> 11:18:31.154
BALLOT BOX. THEY'RE GOING TO DO 
THIS RIGGED, RUSHED AND WRONG 

11:18:31.384 --> 11:18:33.812
EACH PROCESS. I WOULD URGE A YES
VOTE ON THE INVESTMENT. I WOULD 

11:18:33.994 --> 11:18:38.422
YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt; I WANTED TO ASK THE GENTLEMAN

11:18:38.566 --> 11:18:40.633
FROM OHIO A QUESTION. BASED ON 
THE STANDARDS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

11:18:40.852 --> 11:18:44.749
ASSERTING HERE, IF SOMEBODY IS 
IN THE HOUSE OR SENATE, RUNNING 

11:18:44.970 --> 11:18:50.457
FOR PRESIDENT, AND THEY SUPPORT 
OR PUSH THEM EACH OF THE 

11:18:50.672 --> 11:18:55.395
PRESIDENT, WOULD THEY BE SUBJECT
TO BEING EXPELLED 

11:18:58.401 --> 11:18:59.488
FOR ABUSING THEIR POSITION? JUST
CURIOUS. 

11:18:59.489 --> 11:19:01.874
&gt;&gt; I THINK I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT WHAT I 

11:19:02.547 --> 11:19:06.792
DO KNOW IS I THINK MY COLLEAGUES
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

11:19:07.009 --> 11:19:09.009
ARE AS I 

11:19:12.590 --> 11:19:14.338
SAID NERVOUS ABOUT THEIR 
PROSPECTS FOR NEXT NOVEMBER 

11:19:14.339 --> 11:19:16.339
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP BASED ON
HIS AMAZING RECORD OF LEADERSHIP

11:19:16.527 --> 11:19:19.032
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. I WOULD
YIELD BACK. THANK YOU. 

11:19:19.033 --> 11:19:21.608
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YELLED BACK. I 
RECOGNIZE MYSELF TO SPEAK IN 

11:19:21.755 --> 11:19:28.839
OPPOSITION TO THE AMENDMENT. I 
THINK THAT THE FACTS APTLY 

11:19:29.055 --> 11:19:32.584
DEMONSTRATE THE CHARGES IN THESE
TWO ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. 

11:19:32.725 --> 11:19:36.138
NAMELY THAT THE PRESIDENT PUT 
HIS OWN INTERESTS IN FRONT OF 

11:19:36.355 --> 11:19:38.613
THE INTEREST OF THE 

11:19:42.423 --> 11:19:44.602
COUNTRY. THAT HE SOUGHT TO USE 
THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO 

11:19:44.817 --> 11:19:47.913
WITHHOLD AID, MILITARY AID FROM 
AN ALLY. AND TO 

11:19:52.926 --> 11:19:56.953
EXTORT THAT ALLY INTO MAKING AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BOGUS 

11:19:57.173 --> 11:19:59.173
INVESTIGATION OF A POLITICAL 
OPPONENT OF HIS. FOR HIS OWN 

11:19:59.176 --> 11:20:02.221
PERSONAL BENEFIT AND THAT HE 
OBSTRUCTED CONGRESS BY REFUSING 

11:20:02.444 --> 11:20:04.749
ALL COOPERATION AND INSTRUCTING 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH NOT TO 

11:20:04.968 --> 11:20:07.175
COOPERATE WITH CONGRESS IN THE 

11:20:10.439 --> 11:20:11.940
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. THIS 
AMENDMENT, SIMPLY TAKE THE LAST 

11:20:11.941 --> 11:20:16.112
TWO PARAGRAPHS OF EACH  ARTICLE.
IT TAKES THE PARAGRAPH THAT SAYS

11:20:16.326 --> 11:20:21.815
WHEREFORE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 
BE IMPEACHED. IT RENDERS THE TWO

11:20:22.032 --> 11:20:25.833
ARTICLES SIMPLY A CATALOG OF 
VARIOUS BAD AXE BY THE PRESIDENT

11:20:26.048 --> 11:20:28.807
BUT TAKES THE FORCE AND EFFECT 
OF THE ARTICLES ENTIRELY AWAY. 

11:20:28.947 --> 11:20:31.221
IT IS SILLY IF YOU BELIEVE 

11:20:36.220 --> 11:20:40.274
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GUILTY OF 
WHAT THE ARTICLES CHARGE HIM 

11:20:40.489 --> 11:20:42.582
WITH, YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. IF YOU 

11:20:42.741 --> 11:20:44.956
BELIEVE HE IS NOT, YOU SHOULD 
VOTE AGAINST THE ARTICLES OF 

11:20:45.172 --> 11:20:47.353
IMPEACHMENT. BUT TO TRY TO HAVE 
THIS AMENDMENT THAT SIMPLY 

11:20:47.571 --> 11:20:50.826
RENDERS THE ARTICLES, CATALOGS 
OF BAD AXE AND TAKES OUT THE 

11:20:50.975 --> 11:20:56.598
EFFECT OF SENTENCES IS SILLY. SO
I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS 

11:20:57.276 --> 11:21:00.653
AMENDMENT. AND I WILL URGE OF 
COURSE THAT WE ADOPT THE 

11:21:01.460 --> 11:21:05.910
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. I YIELD
BACK THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. 

11:21:06.052 --> 11:21:08.052
&gt;&gt; MR. 

11:21:11.170 --> 11:21:11.468
CHAIR? 
&gt;&gt; 

11:21:11.469 --> 11:21:12.646
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE? 
&gt;&gt; MOVED TO STRIKE LEFTWARD. 

11:21:12.647 --> 11:21:14.492
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY INTERESTING HOW 

11:21:14.493 --> 11:21:16.591
YOU JUST DESCRIBED THIS BECAUSE 
REALLY THIS IS WHAT WE THINK 

11:21:18.647 --> 11:21:20.647
THIS 

11:21:23.661 --> 11:21:28.586
ENTIRE TIME. THE FACTS IS REALLY
ALL THAT YOU HAVE. YOU KEEP 

11:21:28.733 --> 11:21:30.733
THROWING AROUND THESE BAD FACTS 
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE. IT'S 

11:21:30.772 --> 11:21:33.289
INTERESTING TO ME ALSO THAT THE 
CATALOGING AND YOU GOT TO IT. IT

11:21:33.432 --> 11:21:35.744
TOOK A LITTLE BIT BUT THE 
CATALOG OF BAD AXE THAT YOU 

11:21:35.960 --> 11:21:38.381
DON'T LIKE AND SIMPLY TAKES AWAY
THE PUNISHMENT IF YOU WOULD OR 

11:21:38.600 --> 11:21:40.600
WHAT THE END RESULT WILL BE. IT 
SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYONE 

11:21:40.795 --> 11:21:42.800
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE DONE ALL 

11:21:42.991 --> 11:21:45.586
YEAR. THEY DID IT ONE TIME ON 
THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WHEN THE 

11:21:45.808 --> 11:21:48.534
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BROKE THE 
RULES OF THE HOUSE ON THE FLOOR 

11:21:48.686 --> 11:21:51.084
AND INSTEAD OF OWNING UP TO 
BREAKING THE RULES OF DECORUM ON

11:21:51.304 --> 11:21:53.201
THE FLOOR SHE HAD EVERYBODY 
COMEBACK DOWN ON -- 

11:21:53.202 --> 11:21:58.409
&gt;&gt; THE CATALOG OF BAD AXE THAT 
YOU DON'T LIKE AND SIMPLY TAKES 

11:21:58.625 --> 11:22:01.059
AWAY THE PUNISHMENT IF YOU WOULD
OR WHAT THE ACTUAL END RESULT 

11:22:01.275 --> 11:22:03.464
WILL BE. IT SHOULD NOT SURPRISE 
ANYONE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT

11:22:03.681 --> 11:22:06.403
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE DONE 
ALL YEAR. THEY DID IT ONE TIME 

11:22:06.618 --> 11:22:09.236
ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WHEN 
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BROKE 

11:22:09.455 --> 11:22:11.659
THE RULES OF THE 

11:22:16.678 --> 11:22:20.189
HOUSE ON THE FLOOR AND INSTEAD 
OF OWNING UP TO BREAKING THE 

11:22:20.411 --> 11:22:22.747
RULES OF DECORUM ON THE FLOOR 
SHE HAD EVERYBODY COMEBACK DOWN 

11:22:22.891 --> 11:22:25.506
ON THE MAJORITY SIDE AND VOTE TO
RESTORE HER RIGHT TO SPEAK EVEN 

11:22:25.730 --> 11:22:27.759
THOUGH SHE BLATANTLY BROKE THE 
RULES. SO DON'T GIVE ME THIS 

11:22:27.979 --> 11:22:30.527
HIGH AND MIGHTY WE ARE TAKING 
AWAY THE RULES AND HAVING A LIST

11:22:30.882 --> 11:22:36.481
OF IDEAS HERE. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE
BEEN DOING ALL YEAR. I TOLD THE 

11:22:36.622 --> 11:22:38.688
AUDIENCE THE OTHER DAY. THE 
GROUP JUST THE OTHER DAY THAT 

11:22:38.906 --> 11:22:41.722
YOU CAN ALWAYS JUDGE MANY THINGS
BY WHAT YOU SPEND TIME ON AND 

11:22:41.863 --> 11:22:43.863
WHAT YOU SPEND MONEY ON. SPENT 
TIME AND MONEY ON. I'VE SAID 

11:22:44.460 --> 11:22:47.266
ALREADY THAT THIS IS AN 
IMPEACHMENT OF CLOCK AND 

11:22:47.482 --> 11:22:51.163
CALENDAR AND I BELIEVE THAT TO 
BE TRUE BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING IT

11:22:51.517 --> 11:22:53.517
TONIGHT. THIS WHOLE PROCESS. 
THREE HEARINGS, TWO 

11:22:57.828 --> 11:23:00.713
HEARINGS I'M SORRY, AND A 
MARKUP, THAT'S ALL WE ARE DOING.

11:23:00.854 --> 11:23:03.088
THE RUBBER STEP IN THIS 
COMMITTEE IS OUT SO IT'S A TIME 

11:23:03.306 --> 11:23:05.542
YOU SHOULD BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN 
TOLD AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS 

11:23:05.690 --> 11:23:08.469
THE LEADERSHIP WANTS THIS TO 
HAPPEN, THIS IS WHY IT'S 

11:23:08.626 --> 11:23:10.453
HAPPENING. THEY'VE GOT NO 
CHOICE. I FEEL FOR THE CHAIRMAN 

11:23:10.454 --> 11:23:15.209
IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE HE 
DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE. THE 

11:23:15.348 --> 11:23:17.686
SPEAKER AND OTHERS HAVE TOLD HIM
THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 

11:23:17.904 --> 11:23:20.332
AND WE SEE HOW IT'S PLAYING OUT.
IT GOES BACK FURTHER TO THE 

11:23:20.471 --> 11:23:23.029
FIRST OF THE YEAR. THIS IS A 
TIME AND MONEY ISSUE. THIS IS A 

11:23:23.244 --> 11:23:25.209
CALENDAR AND CLOCK ISSUE BECAUSE
THE COMMITTEE, THE INTELLIGENCE 

11:23:25.210 --> 11:23:27.210
COMMITTEE 

11:23:30.218 --> 11:23:34.291
AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
DECIDED EARLY ON TO SPEND MONEY 

11:23:34.512 --> 11:23:36.841
TO BRING OUTSIDE HELP IN HOW TO 
PREPARE FOR TONIGHT. THEY DIDN'T

11:23:36.985 --> 11:23:39.587
KNOW EXACTLY IT WAS GOING TO BE 
LIKE THIS IN JANUARY OR NOVEMBER

11:23:39.805 --> 11:23:42.213
AND DECEMBER WHEN THEY DID HIRE 
THE EXTRA HELP BUT THEY KNEW 

11:23:42.432 --> 11:23:44.697
THEY WERE GOING TO GET TO IT 
SOMEHOW. THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW. 

11:23:44.841 --> 11:23:48.659
AND THEY KEPT WAITING AND 
WAITING SO THEY HIRED EXTRA 

11:23:49.110 --> 11:23:51.110
OUTSIDE  COUNSEL. THEY DID IT ON
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND 

11:23:51.280 --> 11:23:56.272
THEY WANTED IT BECAUSE ALL THEY 
WERE GOING TO DO WAS INVESTIGATE

11:23:56.423 --> 11:23:58.423
THE PRESIDENT. AND THEY DID. THE
ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS 

11:23:58.610 --> 11:24:00.610
CONGRATULATIONS. THEY FINALLY 
MADE IT TO WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS 

11:24:03.107 --> 11:24:05.075
WANTED TO DO. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING RIGHT HERE. TO DESCRIBE 

11:24:05.076 --> 11:24:09.984
THIS TONIGHT AND DESCRIBE IT AS 
IT WAS DESCRIBED IS SIMPLY 

11:24:10.208 --> 11:24:12.594
TAKING AWAY THE PUNISHMENT AND 
LISTING A LOT OF BAD AXE. I 

11:24:12.735 --> 11:24:15.054
COULD DO THAT ABOUT THE MAJORITY
ALL YEAR IN THESE 

11:24:20.068 --> 11:24:22.503
CAVITIES AND INVESTIGATIONS.
WE HAVE HAD MORE HEARINGS IN 

11:24:22.720 --> 11:24:24.465
WHICH THEY GOT TO BASICALLY 
SCREAM AT ADMINISTRATION 

11:24:24.466 --> 11:24:26.466
WITNESSES BUT YET OFFER NO 
SOLUTIONS. IT IS MIND BOGGLING. 

11:24:26.469 --> 11:24:28.312
IT'S DEHUMANIZING. ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES SAID. AND I CALL THEM

11:24:28.313 --> 11:24:30.778
OUT WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION. NOW TODAY, TO AGAIN

11:24:31.867 --> 11:24:34.495
COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO 
TAKE ALL OF THIS AND NEVER HAVE 

11:24:34.840 --> 11:24:37.035
A FACT WITNESS. I THINK IT 

11:24:40.192 --> 11:24:42.193
WAS INTERESTING WHAT MY FRIEND 
FROM FLORIDA SAID. THERE IS A 

11:24:42.407 --> 11:24:44.796
PURPOSE TO SEE PEOPLE AT WITNESS
EVEN IF THEY'VE TESTIFIED TO SEE

11:24:45.015 --> 11:24:47.015
HOW THEY WOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS.
IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT WOULD 

11:24:47.019 --> 11:24:50.599
HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING. BUT WE 
DON'T HAVE THAT. BUT TO SAY WITH

11:24:50.814 --> 11:24:56.811
A STRAIGHT FACE AND I APPRECIATE
THIS, TO SAY AT THE END OF THE 

11:24:57.030 --> 11:24:59.445
DAY ALL WE ARE DOING IS TAKING 
AWAY THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE YOU 

11:24:59.665 --> 11:25:02.617
HAVE A LIST OF BAD ACTORS, WHEN 
THE MAJORITY HAVE DONE THAT ALL 

11:25:02.842 --> 11:25:05.073
YEAR AND ESPECIALLY THE CLASSIC 
CASE OF THE SPEAKER ON THE FLOOR

11:25:05.295 --> 11:25:08.541
OF THE HOUSE BREAKING THE LAW OF
THE RULES OF THE FLOOR AND THEN 

11:25:08.764 --> 11:25:11.254
HAVING THE MAJORITY COME DOWN 
AND RESTORE HER RIGHT SIMPLY 

11:25:12.104 --> 11:25:14.862
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE 
FACT THAT SHE HAD BROKE THE 

11:25:15.079 --> 11:25:17.079
RULES. THIS IS WHERE 

11:25:20.975 --> 11:25:24.453
WE ARE AT.
IT'S A MONEY AND TIME ISSUE. IT 

11:25:24.591 --> 11:25:27.257
WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS HIGH AND
NOBLE. WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF 

11:25:27.472 --> 11:25:32.187
IT WAS EXCEPT FOR ALL THE CRIMES
THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT, EXTORTION,

11:25:32.625 --> 11:25:34.625
BRIBERY, WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF
THEY COULD HAVE FOUND ACTUAL 

11:25:34.824 --> 11:25:36.824
FACTS TO PUT THAT INTO AN 
ARTICLE. THEY COULDN'T. THEY 

11:25:36.869 --> 11:25:40.232
WON'T. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. MAYBE
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING 

11:25:40.456 --> 11:25:42.023
TROUBLE EXPLAINING THOSE BECAUSE
THEY COULDN'T. PAUL TESTING 

11:25:42.024 --> 11:25:45.938
WASN'T GOOD AND THEY GET MEMBERS
WHO NEED TO GO BACK AND SAY I 

11:25:46.157 --> 11:25:49.007
WAS FORCED TO DO THIS BUT REALLY
THE PRESIDENT IS A BAD GUY AND 

11:25:49.199 --> 11:25:51.199
THIS WAS AN ABUSE OF POWER. 
AGAIN, SAY IT LONG ENOUGH 

11:25:51.637 --> 11:25:55.752
SOMEBODY MIGHT BELIEVE IT. BUT 
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT. AND IT'S

11:25:59.926 --> 11:26:01.667
REALLY INTERESTING AGAIN. FROM 
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS TO WATCH

11:26:01.668 --> 11:26:04.879
THIS CONGRESS, THIS MAJORITY 
WORK IS JUST TRULY AMAZING. AND 

11:26:05.018 --> 11:26:11.152
TO SAY THIS, WHEN NO FACTS 
TOGETHER, ABUSE OF POWER, 

11:26:11.372 --> 11:26:13.488
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS THIS IS 
ALL THEY'VE GOT? THIS IS ALL 

11:26:13.711 --> 11:26:15.829
THEY HAVE? TO MAKE 

11:26:20.833 --> 11:26:23.269
THIS EXCUSE? GOOD LUCK.
THAT DOG AIN'T HUNTING ANYMORE. 

11:26:23.411 --> 11:26:25.899
NOBODY IS. JUST AIN'T WORKING. I
YIELD BACK. 

11:26:25.900 --> 11:26:29.753
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. 

11:26:34.769 --> 11:26:35.383
CHAIR? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE? 

11:26:35.384 --> 11:26:37.666
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I THINK
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME OR I 

11:26:37.885 --> 11:26:43.411
MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; AGONIZED. 

11:26:43.412 --> 11:26:45.367
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I THINK
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO 

11:26:45.368 --> 11:26:47.844
REMIND YOU AGAIN OF YOUR OWN 
WORDS THAT WERE STATED JUST A 

11:26:49.837 --> 11:26:51.837
FEW 

11:26:53.459 --> 11:26:55.378
MONTHS AGO LAST YEAR. DURING AN 
INTERVIEW ON MSNBC THIS MORNING 

11:26:55.379 --> 11:26:59.574
JOE, ON NOVEMBER 26,  2018, 
CHAIRMAN NADLER OUTLINED THE 

11:26:59.722 --> 11:27:03.229
THREE-PRONGED TEST THAT HE SAID 
WOULD ALLOW FOR A LEGITIMATE 

11:27:03.909 --> 11:27:06.617
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING. AND NOW 
I, QUOTE, 

11:27:11.630 --> 11:27:15.264
CHAIRMAN NADLER'S REMARKS.
THEIR REALLY ARE THREE QUESTIONS

11:27:15.483 --> 11:27:17.483
I THINK. FIRST, HAS THE 
PRESIDENT 

11:27:19.414 --> 11:27:20.923
COMMITTED IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES? 
SECOND, DO THOSE OFFENSES RISE 

11:27:20.924 --> 11:27:23.606
TO THE GRAVITY THAT'S WORTH 
PUTTING THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE 

11:27:23.821 --> 11:27:25.989
DRAMA OF IMPEACHMENT? NUMBER 3, 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO TEAR 

11:27:27.161 --> 11:27:30.221
THE COUNTRY APART, YOU DON'T 
WANT HALF OF THE COUNTRY TO SAY 

11:27:32.501 --> 11:27:34.901
TO THE OTHER HALF, FOR THE NEXT 
30 YEARS, WE WON THE ELECTION, 

11:27:35.120 --> 11:27:37.120
YOU STOLE 

11:27:40.817 --> 11:27:42.817
IT FROM US.

11:27:44.230 --> 11:27:46.851
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO THINK AT 
THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPEACHMENT

11:27:47.071 --> 11:27:49.490
PROCESS THAT THE EVIDENCE IS SO 
CLEAR OF OFFENSES SO GRAVE THAT 

11:27:49.683 --> 11:27:52.079
ONCE YOU'VE LAID OUT ALL THE 
EVIDENCE A GOOD FRACTION OF THE 

11:27:52.525 --> 11:27:53.847
OPPOSITION VOTERS WILL 
RELUCTANTLY ADMIT TO THEMSELVES 

11:27:53.848 --> 11:27:55.894
THEY HAD TO DO IT. OTHERWISE YOU
HAVE A PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT. 

11:27:56.038 --> 11:28:00.483
WHICH WILL TEAR THE COUNTRY 
APART. IF YOU MEET THESE THREE 

11:28:00.700 --> 11:28:02.700
TESTS, THEN I THINK YOU 

11:28:07.031 --> 11:28:09.031
DO THE IMPEACHMENT.
NOW, LET'S SEE IF CHAIRMAN 

11:28:09.037 --> 11:28:10.842
NADLER'S THREE-PRONGED TEST HAS 
BEEN MET. FIRST, HAS THE 

11:28:10.843 --> 11:28:15.507
PRESIDENT COMMITTED AN 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE? NO. THERE 

11:28:15.647 --> 11:28:18.491
HAS BEEN NO WITNESS, NO DEMOCRAT
WITNESS, FACT WITNESS, THAT CAN 

11:28:23.499 --> 11:28:25.600
PROVE THAT FACT. SECOND, DO 
THOSE OFFENSES RISE TO THE 

11:28:25.820 --> 11:28:28.024
GRAVITY THAT'S WORTH PUTTING THE
COUNTRY THROUGH THE 

11:28:32.297 --> 11:28:33.659
DRAMA OF IMPEACHMENT? ABSOLUTELY
NOT. THIRD, HAVE THE DEMOCRATS 

11:28:33.660 --> 11:28:36.577
LAID OUT A CASE SO CLEAR THAT 
EVEN THE OPPOSITION HAS TO 

11:28:37.257 --> 11:28:40.446
AGREE? NO. YOU AND HOUSE 
DEMOCRATS LEADERSHIP ARE TEARING

11:28:45.452 --> 11:28:47.617
THE COUNTRY APART.
HE SAID THE EVIDENCE NEEDS TO BE

11:28:47.948 --> 11:28:50.442
CLEAR. IT IS NOT. YOU SAID 
OFFENSES NEED TO BE GRAVE. THEY 

11:28:50.587 --> 11:28:52.690
ARE NOT. YOU SAID ONCE THE 
EVIDENCE IS LAID OUT, THAT THE 

11:28:52.905 --> 11:28:54.905
OPPOSITION WILL ADMIT THEY HAD 
TO DO 

11:28:58.128 --> 11:29:00.065
IT. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. IN 
FACT POLLING ON THE FACT THAT 

11:29:00.066 --> 11:29:04.002
NOT ONE SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTED 
ON THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 

11:29:04.447 --> 11:29:07.060
RESOLUTION OR THE SHIFT REPORT 
AND I DOUBT THAT ONE SINGLE 

11:29:07.279 --> 11:29:11.678
REPUBLICAN WILL VOTE ON THESE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TONIGHT 

11:29:11.901 --> 11:29:15.002
OR ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES REVEALS 

11:29:20.001 --> 11:29:22.468
THAT THE OPPOSITE IS IN FACT 
TRUE. IN FACT, WHAT YOU AND YOUR

11:29:22.687 --> 11:29:24.883
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE 
IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SAID

11:29:25.025 --> 11:29:29.574
HAD TO BE DONE. THIS IS A 
PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT. ENTITIES 

11:29:30.116 --> 11:29:36.522
TEARING THE COUNTRY APART. AND 
WITH THAT I YIELD BACK. 

11:29:36.523 --> 11:29:39.224
&gt;&gt; GENTLE LADY YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; 

11:29:44.097 --> 11:29:46.643
MR. CHAIRMAN? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE DOES MR. JOHNSON

11:29:46.863 --> 11:29:48.050
SEEK RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

11:29:48.051 --> 11:29:50.375
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I AM JUST RISING 

11:29:50.592 --> 11:29:52.592
TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT 

11:29:56.530 --> 11:29:58.520
OF THIS AMENDMENT. FOR MR. 
JORDAN AND I THINK IT'S REALLY 

11:29:58.521 --> 11:30:00.521
APPROPRIATE. I DON'T THINK WE 
ARE ASKING FOR ANYTHING 

11:30:01.585 --> 11:30:03.585
EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE I'M 
READING THIS RESOLUTION AS IT'S 

11:30:03.638 --> 11:30:06.999
DRAFTED AND THE LANGUAGE JUMPS 
OFF THE PAGE. THIS IS REALLY 

11:30:07.223 --> 11:30:09.473
PERSONAL. THE LINES THAT HE IS 
SEEKING TO STRIKE WITH THIS 

11:30:10.145 --> 11:30:12.145
AMENDMENT 

11:30:14.762 --> 11:30:16.770
SHOULD BE STRUCK. THE VITRIOLIC,
THE HATRED JUST DRIPS FROM THE 

11:30:16.988 --> 11:30:21.013
PLEADING HERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT
CAME RIGHT OUT OF THE PETER 

11:30:21.231 --> 11:30:24.310
STRZOK, LISA PAGE EXCHANGE IS. 
LISTEN TO WHAT IT SAYS. RIGHT 

11:30:24.459 --> 11:30:28.270
HERE, ON THE PAGE, THE LINES 
THAT WE WANT TO STRIKE. IN PART 

11:30:28.412 --> 11:30:31.273
PRESIDENT TRUMP WARRANTS 
IMPEACHMENT AND TRIAL, REMOVAL 

11:30:33.873 --> 11:30:37.156
FROM OFFICE AND DISQUALIFICATION
TO HOLD AND ENJOY ANY OFFICE OF 

11:30:37.372 --> 11:30:41.272
HONOR OR TRUST OR PROFIT UNDER 
THE UNITED STATES. LOOK. THEY 

11:30:41.414 --> 11:30:43.414
DON'T JUST WANT TO REMOVE HIM 
FROM 

11:30:47.067 --> 11:30:49.067
THE OVAL OFFICE. THEY WANT TO 
CRUSH HIM. THEY WANT TO DESTROY 

11:30:49.229 --> 11:30:51.165
DONALD TRUMP. THEY WANT TO 
BANISH HIM FROM THE MARKETPLACE.

11:30:51.166 --> 11:30:55.477
IT'S SO OVER THE TOP. PROFESSOR 
TURLEY AGAIN THE ONLY WITNESS, 

11:30:55.704 --> 11:30:57.704
THE ONLY WITNESS WE'VE BEEN 
ALLOWED IN 

11:31:02.487 --> 11:31:04.487
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

11:31:06.422 --> 11:31:08.372
, THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS 
JURISDICTION OVER THIS ISSUE, WE

11:31:08.373 --> 11:31:10.861
GOT ONE WITNESS IN THE PROCESS. 
AND HE WAS NOT A DONALD TRUMP 

11:31:11.076 --> 11:31:13.463
SUPPORTER. HE CAME IN AND SAID I
DON'T EVEN, I'D DIDN'T VOTE FOR 

11:31:13.683 --> 11:31:15.940
HIM BUT I CAME TO GIVE OBJECTIVE
ANALYSIS BECAUSE MY ALLEGIANCES 

11:31:16.137 --> 11:31:18.137
TO THE CONSTITUTION. YOU KNOW 
WHAT HE GOT FOR THAT OBJECTIVE 

11:31:18.754 --> 11:31:22.288
ANALYSIS THAT HE DELIVERED? SO 
ARTICULATELY. HE GOT DEATH 

11:31:22.462 --> 11:31:26.936
THREATS. HE HAD TO PUBLISH AN 
OP-ED EXPLAINING THAT THERE WAS 

11:31:27.153 --> 11:31:30.368
THIS OUTCRY AND A CALL FOR HIM 
TO BE REMOVED FROM HIS POSITION 

11:31:32.316 --> 11:31:34.179
AT HIS UNIVERSITY. DEATH THREATS
BECAUSE HE GAVE AN OBJECTIVE 

11:31:34.180 --> 11:31:39.105
VIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE 
VITRIOLIC, THE DEFCON LEVEL, THE

11:31:39.326 --> 11:31:42.089
POLITICAL SCALE IS AT ONE RIGHT 
NOW AND IT'S SO CRAZY AND IT'S 

11:31:42.307 --> 11:31:44.307
BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE LIKE THIS 

11:31:48.423 --> 11:31:50.423
IN THE RESOLUTION.

11:31:57.237 --> 11:31:59.388
THAT IS PUSHING THIS. TELL YOU 
WHAT PROFESSOR TURLEY SAID. A 

11:31:59.533 --> 11:32:01.677
COUPLE EXCERPTS IN HIS SUMMARY. 
AS I HAVE STRESSED, THIS IS IN 

11:32:01.892 --> 11:32:03.892
HIS WRITTEN REPORT THAT HE 
SUBMITTED, AS I HAVE STRESSED, 

11:32:04.099 --> 11:32:06.278
IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A 
CASE FOR IMPEACHMENT BASED ON 

11:32:06.472 --> 11:32:08.036
NONCRIMINAL ALLEGATION OF ABUSE 
OF POWER. BUT ALTHOUGH 

11:32:08.037 --> 11:32:09.813
CRIMINALITY IS NOT REQUIRED, 
CLARITY IS NECESSARY. THAT COMES

11:32:09.814 --> 11:32:11.348
FROM A COMPLETE AND 
COMPREHENSIVE RECORD THAT 

11:32:11.349 --> 11:32:12.558
ELIMINATES EXCULPATORY 
MOTIVATIONS OR EXPLANATIONS. THE

11:32:12.559 --> 11:32:15.964
PROBLEM IS THAT THIS IS AN 
EXCEPTIONALLY NARROW IMPEACHMENT

11:32:16.181 --> 11:32:19.062
RESTING ON THE THINNEST POSSIBLE
EVIDENTIARY RECORD. EVEN UNDER 

11:32:19.279 --> 11:32:21.354
THE MOST FLEXIBLE MODEL THERE 
REMAINED AN EXPECTATION THAT 

11:32:21.571 --> 11:32:25.336
IMPEACHMENT COULD BE USED OR 
BASED ON PRESUMPTION OR 

11:32:25.473 --> 11:32:29.045
SPECULATION ON KEY ELEMENTS. THE
UNDERLYING ALLEGATION COULD  

11:32:29.257 --> 11:32:34.284
NOT, COULD BE NONCRIMINAL THE 
EARLY ENGLISH IMPEACHMENT 

11:32:34.717 --> 11:32:36.468
FOLLOWED A FORMAT SIMILAR TO 
CRIMINAL CHARGE TRIAL INCLUDING 

11:32:36.469 --> 11:32:41.750
CALLING OF WITNESSES AND ALL THE
REST. HE SAID THE HISTORY OF 

11:32:41.965 --> 11:32:43.266
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL 
IMPEACHMENT SHOWS RESTRAINT EVEN

11:32:43.267 --> 11:32:45.267
WHEN THERE ARE SUBSTANTIVE 
COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE CONDUCT 

11:32:45.381 --> 11:32:47.381
OF PRESIDENTS. SOME 

11:32:51.064 --> 11:32:55.093
OF OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS COULD
HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED FOR ACTS IN 

11:32:55.314 --> 11:32:56.835
VIOLATION OF THEIR 
CONSTITUTIONAL OATH OF OFFICE 

11:32:56.836 --> 11:33:00.147
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE 
COOLER HEADS PREVAILED 

11:33:04.940 --> 11:33:06.464
UNDER CONGRESS. THIS MISUSE 
PROFESSOR TURLEY CONTINUES, THIS

11:33:06.465 --> 11:33:08.163
MISUSE HAS BEEN PLAYING DURING 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

11:33:08.164 --> 11:33:10.190
MEMBERS HAVE CALLED FOR REMOVAL 
BASED ON A MYRIAD OF OBJECTIONS 

11:33:10.405 --> 11:33:12.586
AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT, AL GREEN
OF TEXAS FILED A RESOLUTION FOR 

11:33:13.261 --> 11:33:15.261
IMPEACHMENT AFTER 

11:33:19.358 --> 11:33:21.358
TRUMP CALLED FOR

11:33:25.826 --> 11:33:27.826
PLAYERS KNEELING DURING THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM TO BE FIRED. 

11:33:27.957 --> 11:33:29.626
COME ON. YOU DON'T LIKE HIS 
POLITICAL POSITIONS, GREAT BUT 

11:33:29.627 --> 11:33:31.627
YOU CAN'T IMPEACH A PRESIDENT 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HIM. 

11:33:31.767 --> 11:33:33.579
THAT'S NOT HOW THIS SYSTEM 
WORKS. WE ARE IN A 

11:33:33.580 --> 11:33:35.000
CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. THERE 
ARE RULES. THERE ARE STANDARDS. 

11:33:35.001 --> 11:33:37.001
YOU DON'T GET TO MAKE THAT 

11:33:41.427 --> 11:33:43.427
DECISION. THE VOTERS DO.

11:33:48.132 --> 11:33:50.597
WE HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP IN
ABOUT 11 MONTHS. LET THE PEOPLE 

11:33:50.789 --> 11:33:52.696
DECIDE. DON'T PUT YOURSELVES IN 
THEIR PLACE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE 

11:33:52.697 --> 11:33:54.697
RIGHT TO DO IT. YOU'RE NOT 
FOLLOWING THE PROPER PROCEDURE. 

11:33:54.737 --> 11:33:56.745
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS THE RIGHT 
WAY. IT'S A RARELY USED DEVICE 

11:33:57.076 --> 11:33:59.076
IN OUR HISTORY. IT IS SUPPOSED 
TO BE. PROFESSOR TURLEY ENDED 

11:33:59.093 --> 11:34:00.823
THIS WAY. HE SAID, QUOTE, 
DESPITE MY DISAGREEMENT WITH 

11:34:00.824 --> 11:34:02.570
MANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
POLICIES AND STATEMENTS, 

11:34:02.571 --> 11:34:04.522
IMPEACHMENT WAS NEVER INTENDED 
TO BE USED AS A MIDTERM 

11:34:04.523 --> 11:34:07.019
CORRECTIVE OPTION FOR A DIVISIVE
OR UNPOPULAR LEADER. WE GET IT. 

11:34:07.159 --> 11:34:09.159
YOU 

11:34:12.030 --> 11:34:15.664
DON'T LIKE HIM.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN BANISH

11:34:15.804 --> 11:34:17.845
HIM FROM THE MARKETPLACE. YOU 
CAN'T SEND HIM OUT OF HIS 

11:34:18.061 --> 11:34:20.511
BUSINESSES AND SAY HE CAN'T HOLD
A POSITION OF HONOR OR TRUST. 

11:34:20.650 --> 11:34:22.983
YOU DON'T GET THE RIGHT TO DO 
THAT. THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

11:34:23.200 --> 11:34:25.463
DO. WE LIVE IN A REPUBLIC. I'M 
JUST SICK OF THIS. I GOT BACK 

11:34:25.671 --> 11:34:27.616
FORGET I DON'T YIELD BACK. I 
YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN, MR. 

11:34:27.617 --> 11:34:29.493
JORDAN. I'VE GOT 30 SECONDS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IN 2016 THE 

11:34:29.494 --> 11:34:30.730
DEMOCRATS HAD THE INSURANCE 
POLICY. PETR. 

11:34:30.731 --> 11:34:34.881
&gt;&gt;&gt; LISA PAGE WAS THEIR DEAL IN 
2016. THE FBI. 2020, IT IS 

11:34:35.097 --> 11:34:37.097
IMPEACHMENT. 2020 THEY'RE GOING 

11:34:40.919 --> 11:34:42.676
TO USE IMPEACHMENT. INSURANCE 
POLICY DIDN'T WORK IN 2016. 

11:34:42.677 --> 11:34:48.922
IMPEACHMENT IS NOT GOING TO WORK
IN 2020 BECAUSE THE AMERICAN 

11:34:49.142 --> 11:34:51.095
PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT THIS 
PRESIDENT IS GETTING DONE ON 

11:34:51.096 --> 11:34:53.370
THEIR BEHALF. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 

11:34:53.545 --> 11:34:54.393
ANYBODY ELSE? 
&gt;&gt; DETERMINE? 

11:34:54.394 --> 11:34:56.394
&gt;&gt; WHAT PURPOSE? 
&gt;&gt; MOTION TO STRIKE 

11:34:59.391 --> 11:35:05.215
THE LAST WORDS. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

11:35:05.394 --> 11:35:10.167
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IT TRULY IS 
AMAZING. WE'VE HEARD OVER AND 

11:35:10.386 --> 11:35:14.781
OVER THAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT THE
BIDENS. ALL ABOUT GETTING 

11:35:15.005 --> 11:35:17.005
INFORMATION ON PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT 

11:35:17.400 --> 11:35:19.400
WHAT 

11:35:22.297 --> 11:35:24.297
THE PRESIDENT SAID, HE'S TALKING
ABOUT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS 

11:35:24.494 --> 11:35:26.529
COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN 
THROUGH A LOT. AND UKRAINE KNOWS

11:35:27.181 --> 11:35:31.657
A LOT ABOUT IT. I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH 

11:35:31.875 --> 11:35:33.961
THIS WHOLE SITUATION WITH 
UKRAINE. THEY SAY CRAP STRIKE. 

11:35:34.110 --> 11:35:38.534
IT'S NEWS TO ME BUT MY DEMOCRAT 
FRIENDS WILL KNOW BETTER, I 

11:35:38.751 --> 11:35:42.848
DIDN'T KNOW BIDEN WAS INVOLVED 
WITH CROWD STRIKE. I DIDN'T KNOW

11:35:43.943 --> 11:35:48.281
HE WAS INVOLVED WITH THE DNC 
SERVER BEING HACKED. I DIDN'T 

11:35:48.428 --> 11:35:51.268
KNOW THAT WAS PART OF HIS THING 
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

11:35:56.282 --> 11:35:58.282
IS ASKING ABOUT. BECAUSE

11:36:01.202 --> 11:36:03.202
THERE HAS BEEN INFORMATION THAT 
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN UKRAINE 

11:36:03.371 --> 11:36:05.371
THAT KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. 
AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S ASKING 

11:36:05.412 --> 11:36:07.152
ABOUT. SO I APPRECIATE THE 
REVELATION FROM OUR FRIENDS 

11:36:07.153 --> 11:36:09.655
ACROSS THE AISLE BIDEN WAS IN 
THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT. AND THEN

11:36:09.801 --> 11:36:12.188
SAID I GUESS YOU HAVE ONE OF 
YOUR WEALTHY PEOPLE, THE SERVER 

11:36:12.404 --> 11:36:16.044
THEY SAY UKRAINE HAS IT. AGAIN, 
I DIDN'T KNOW BIDEN WAS ALL IN 

11:36:16.259 --> 11:36:21.403
UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN THAT. BUT 
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT 

11:36:22.082 --> 11:36:24.082
WENT 

11:36:25.704 --> 11:36:27.432
ON. THE WHOLE SITUATION. AND I 
THINK YOUR SURROUNDING YOURSELF 

11:36:27.433 --> 11:36:29.863
WITH SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE. I 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ATTORNEY 

11:36:30.084 --> 11:36:32.960
GENERAL CALL YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
AND I COULD GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

11:36:33.175 --> 11:36:36.251
IT. SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE THING 
ABOUT 

11:36:40.314 --> 11:36:42.497
THE 2016 ELECTION. BUT ACCORDING
TO OUR FRIENDS, BIDEN WAS IN THE

11:36:42.718 --> 11:36:47.460
MIDDLE OF ALL OF THIS MESS. SO 
ANYWAY IT'S INTERESTING. BUT MY 

11:36:48.774 --> 11:36:54.135
FRIEND FROM OHIO HAS A BRILLIANT
AMENDMENT. THEY SAY IT'S NOT 

11:36:54.348 --> 11:36:59.096
PERSONAL. THAT THIS ISN'T JUST 
ABOUT AN ELECTION. THAT THIS IS 

11:37:00.943 --> 11:37:04.156
TRYING TO UNDO THE UNFAIRNESS OF
THE PRIOR ELECTION. EVEN THOUGH 

11:37:04.371 --> 11:37:10.189
IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS NO RUSH 
AND COLLUSION. AND IT SOUNDS 

11:37:10.404 --> 11:37:16.297
LIKE THAT THERE WAS DESPITE WHAT
THE MEDIA IS SAYING THAT WE KNOW

11:37:16.512 --> 11:37:18.755
THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR CAME 
OUT LAMBASTING TRUMP. CLEARLY 

11:37:18.900 --> 11:37:21.243
THAT THE WOULD NOT HAVE 

11:37:26.255 --> 11:37:28.255
BEEN DONE WITHOUT

11:37:33.513 --> 11:37:35.512
OFFICIAL OKAY. THEY WERE ALL IN 
FOR HILLARY CLINTON. THAT'S WHY 

11:37:35.513 --> 11:37:37.693
IT WAS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE 
FIGURING AFTER THE ELECTION THAT

11:37:37.907 --> 11:37:40.395
TRUMP WON MAYBE WE BETTER TRY TO
WARM UP TO TRUMP. BUT THERE'S 

11:37:40.566 --> 11:37:43.129
BEEN SO MUCH MADE OF THE FACT 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT ASK

11:37:43.342 --> 11:37:45.342
THE FORMER CORRUPT 
ADMINISTRATION FOR HELP IN 

11:37:50.095 --> 11:37:52.095
ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION. THAT IS 
JUST ALMOST UNFATHOMABLE THAT 

11:37:52.185 --> 11:37:54.956
THAT POINT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE 
MADE ALL DAY TODAY. IN 2019, YOU

11:37:55.168 --> 11:37:59.948
HAD THE ELECTION OF A MAN IN 
UKRAINE, ZELENSKY, THAT SAID HE 

11:38:00.166 --> 11:38:02.166
WAS GOING 

11:38:05.108 --> 11:38:06.848
TO FIGHT CORRUPTION. AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HEARD FROM OUR 

11:38:06.849 --> 11:38:08.856
OWN PEOPLE WE THINK HE IS 
SINCERE. WE REALLY THINK HE'S 

11:38:09.073 --> 11:38:11.073
GOING TO TRY TO FIGHT 
CORRUPTION. SO OF COURSE THIS IS

11:38:11.280 --> 11:38:16.653
THE FIRST TIME THAT HE TALKS TO 
UKRAINIAN LEADER BECAUSE HE KNEW

11:38:16.874 --> 11:38:18.664
HE COULDN'T TRUST THE OTHER 
ONES. THEY WERE SUPPORTING 

11:38:18.665 --> 11:38:20.490
HILLARY CLINTON. THEY WERE 
CORRUPT. WHY WOULD HE TALK TO 

11:38:20.491 --> 11:38:25.619
THEM ABOUT HELPING ROOT OUT THE 
CORRUPTION? SO TO SAY THIS WAS 

11:38:25.837 --> 11:38:27.837
ALL ABOUT BIDEN FOR 

11:38:30.892 --> 11:38:32.417
HEAVEN SAKE? THAT'S RIDICULOUS. 
BUT MY FRIEND FROM OHIO'S 

11:38:32.418 --> 11:38:34.451
AMENDMENT PUTS OUR FRIENDS TO 
THE TEST. IS IT REALLY ABOUT 

11:38:34.667 --> 11:38:37.833
TRYING TO CORRECT WHAT YOU SAY 
WAS AN UNFAIR ELECTION WHICH WE 

11:38:38.048 --> 11:38:40.048
KNOW NOW 

11:38:43.721 --> 11:38:45.721
FROM THE HOROWITZ REPORT

11:38:50.295 --> 11:38:52.584
IT WAS UNFAIR BUT IT WAS FROM 
THE DEMOCRATS' SIDE? FROM THE 

11:38:52.784 --> 11:38:54.784
TRUMP HATER SIDE. IF THAT'S 
REALLY THE CASE, THEN LET'S JUST

11:38:54.941 --> 11:38:57.321
STRIKE THE PART THAT SAYS HE 
CAN'T EVER RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN 

11:38:57.821 --> 11:38:59.528
OR BE REELECTED AGAIN. RIGHT? 
WOULDN'T THAT HELP SOME OF YOUR 

11:38:59.529 --> 11:39:01.662
VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS IF YOU MADE
IT MORE REASONABLE LIKE THAT? OR

11:39:01.805 --> 11:39:06.094
DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO 
PERSIST IN MAKING IT SO PERSONAL

11:39:06.310 --> 11:39:08.944
THAT IT IS WALK OFF THE PLANK 
TIME FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO 

11:39:09.163 --> 11:39:15.445
TRY TO BE REASONABLE ABOUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? SO WE WILL

11:39:15.658 --> 11:39:17.658
SEE. BUT IT'S A GOOD AMENDMENT. 
I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES 

11:39:17.749 --> 11:39:22.281
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. HELP
SOME OF YOUR VULNERABLE PEOPLE 

11:39:22.425 --> 11:39:24.518
OUT. VOTE FOR MR. JORDAN'S 
AMENDMENT. YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF.

11:39:24.664 --> 11:39:30.291
THE COUNTRY WILL BE BETTER OFF. 
I FEEL SURE HE WILL BE 

11:39:30.526 --> 11:39:37.449
REELECTED. AND THE SCARY PART 
FOR ME IS THAT BAR HAS BEEN SET 

11:39:37.683 --> 11:39:43.487
SO LOW I AM REALLY AFRAID NO 
MATTER WHAT PARTY IS IN THE 

11:39:43.626 --> 11:39:46.199
WHITE HOUSE IF THERE'S AN 
OPPOSING PARTY IN CONGRESS ARE 

11:39:46.436 --> 11:39:53.430
GOING TO USE THIS TACTIC TO TRY 
TO TAKE THEM DOWN. ONE SILVER 

11:39:53.608 --> 11:39:56.206
LINING, IT'S BEEN HARD TO KNOW 
WHO ARE THE DEEP STATE PEOPLE 

11:39:56.446 --> 11:39:58.588
WERE ESPECIALLY IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. BY FRIENDS GOING 

11:39:58.735 --> 11:40:02.149
THROUGH THIS, WE NOW KNOW WHO 
THE PEOPLE ARE 

11:40:05.848 --> 11:40:08.302
THAT DON'T WANT THE SWAMP 
DRAINED AND WE CAN DEAL WITH 

11:40:08.550 --> 11:40:10.550
THAT. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. I 

11:40:10.772 --> 11:40:15.179
RECOGNIZE MYSELF. I RECOGNIZE 
MYSELF. I'M SORRY. I RECOGNIZE 

11:40:15.702 --> 11:40:18.087
-- 
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES MR. 

11:40:21.958 --> 11:40:23.833
SWALWELL YIELD RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO THE CHAIRMAN. 

11:40:23.834 --> 11:40:25.834
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IMPEACHMENT WAS 
PUT INTO THE CONSTITUTION 

11:40:26.157 --> 11:40:31.362
BECAUSE THE FRAMERS RECOGNIZED 
THAT A PRESIDENT MIGHT ARISE WHO

11:40:31.512 --> 11:40:33.512
POSED SUCH A THREAT 

11:40:38.189 --> 11:40:40.594
TO THE COUNTRY TO OUR DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM AND OUR FREE ELECTIONS 

11:40:40.828 --> 11:40:43.416
THAT WE COULDN'T WAIT TILL THE 
NEXT ELECTION TO CURE IT. THAT'S

11:40:43.557 --> 11:40:46.610
WHY IMPEACHMENT WAS PUT INTO THE
CONSTITUTION. LET'S LOOK AT, 

11:40:46.838 --> 11:40:49.119
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF VERY 

11:40:52.702 --> 11:40:55.321
DISTRACTING FACTS ABOUT WHAT 
HUNTER BIDEN MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

11:40:55.559 --> 11:40:57.912
DONE ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
OF WHAT OUR MEMBERS MAY HAVE 

11:40:58.104 --> 11:41:01.896
SAID THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. 
ALL OF THAT IS IRRELEVANT. 

11:41:02.048 --> 11:41:04.085
WHAT'S RELEVANT IS THAT THERE 
ARE AMPLE FACTS DEMONSTRATING 

11:41:04.300 --> 11:41:06.300
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT 

11:41:10.439 --> 11:41:12.439
HIS PERSONAL INTERESTS ABOVE THE
INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY AND 

11:41:12.537 --> 11:41:14.498
CITIZENS IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
THIS IS THE HIGHEST OF 

11:41:14.499 --> 11:41:16.499
CONSTITUTIONAL CRIMES. AND 

11:41:19.788 --> 11:41:21.860
ABUSE OF POWER. ABUSE OF POWER 
IS THE PREEMINENT CRIME WHICH 

11:41:22.084 --> 11:41:24.110
THE FRAMERS EVEN IN THE 
FEDERALIST PAPERS TALKED ABOUT 

11:41:24.336 --> 11:41:26.344
AS HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
FOR THE CONSTITUTION, FOR THE 

11:41:26.824 --> 11:41:28.383
PURPOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. IN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ABUSE OF 

11:41:28.384 --> 11:41:33.001
POWER, HE DID IT IN TWO WAYS. 
NUMBER 1, HE ENDANGERED OUR FREE

11:41:33.233 --> 11:41:36.190
ELECTIONS. BY INVITING FOREIGN 
POWERS TO INTERFERE TO INFLUENCE

11:41:38.838 --> 11:41:41.818
OUR ELECTIONS TWICE. HE INVITED 
THE RUSSIANS IN 2016. REMEMBER 

11:41:46.639 --> 11:41:48.988
IF YOU'RE LISTENING, PLEASE FIND
THE E-MAILS. THAT WAS A DIRECT 

11:41:49.231 --> 11:41:51.519
SOLICITATION AND THE FACT THEY 
TRIED TO HACK INTO THE E-MAILS 

11:41:51.758 --> 11:41:55.027
OF THE DEMOCRATS THAT VERY 
NIGHT. AND THEN HE TRIED TO 

11:41:57.065 --> 11:42:04.921
COVER IT UP. AND THEN FOR 2020, 
HE INVITED IN, HE ASKED THE 

11:42:05.154 --> 11:42:07.154
UKRAINIANS TO ANNOUNCE 

11:42:10.021 --> 11:42:12.417
THE BOGUS INVESTIGATION OF THE 
PERSON HE PERCEIVED AS HIS MAJOR

11:42:12.655 --> 11:42:16.626
POLITICAL OPPONENT IN THE 2020 
ELECTION. AND BASICALLY 

11:42:16.794 --> 11:42:18.794
ADMITTED, MICK MULVANEY SAID 

11:42:22.958 --> 11:42:24.958
WE DID IT.

11:42:28.359 --> 11:42:30.261
THE PRESIDENT IS ON THE 
TRANSCRIPT, SHOWS VERY CLEARLY 

11:42:30.262 --> 11:42:32.109
THAT HE DID IT. THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WITHHELD 

11:42:32.110 --> 11:42:35.462
AIDE SHOWS VERY CLEARLY IT WAS A
QUID PRO 

11:42:39.480 --> 11:42:41.454
QUO. YES, WE KNOW THAT 
EVENTUALLY THE AIDE WAS RELEASED

11:42:41.455 --> 11:42:44.024
AND HE SAID, THE PRESIDENT SAID 
THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO. BOTH 

11:42:44.166 --> 11:42:46.531
OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENED AFTER 
HE WAS CAUGHT AND IT WAS PUBLIC.

11:42:46.676 --> 11:42:48.497
OBVIOUSLY, THE BANK ROBBER 
CAUGHT IN THE ACT AFTERWARDS 

11:42:48.498 --> 11:42:51.074
SAYS I DIDN'T MEAN TO ROB THE 
BANK. BUT HE WAS IN FACT CAUGHT 

11:42:51.413 --> 11:42:55.285
IN THE ACT. HE TRIED TO COVER IT
UP AGAIN. HE OBSTRUCTED CONGRESS

11:42:55.502 --> 11:42:57.502
BY DIRECTING 

11:43:01.187 --> 11:43:03.187
THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION

11:43:05.336 --> 11:43:07.421
, EVERYBODY IN THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH, DO NOT ANSWER ANY 

11:43:07.621 --> 11:43:09.115
QUESTIONS. DO NOT TESTIFY. DO 
NOT GET ANY DOCUMENTS. 

11:43:09.116 --> 11:43:11.116
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM 
WHAT OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE DONE 

11:43:11.121 --> 11:43:13.121
ON OCCASION WHICH IS 

11:43:18.130 --> 11:43:21.183
TO OPPOSE CERTAIN SUBPOENAS AND 
GROUNDS OF PRIVILEGE. HE DIDN'T 

11:43:21.377 --> 11:43:23.214
ASSERT ANY PRIVILEGE. HE JUST 
SAID NOBODY SHOULD COOPERATE. I 

11:43:23.215 --> 11:43:25.215
WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT'S A VALID
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. I WILL TAKE

11:43:25.368 --> 11:43:27.368
THE FUNCTION OF 

11:43:29.876 --> 11:43:31.578
CONGRESS TO MYSELF. BECAUSE I 
DON'T RECOGNIZE CONGRESS' RIGHT.

11:43:31.579 --> 11:43:33.601
THAT IS A THREAT TO THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS AND A 

11:43:33.752 --> 11:43:35.801
THREAT TO OUR LIBERTY. IT'S 
NOTEWORTHY THAT MEMBERS OF THE 

11:43:36.019 --> 11:43:38.861
MINORITY SPEAK ABOUT EVERY OTHER
SUBJECT BUT HARDLY BOTHER TO 

11:43:39.534 --> 11:43:42.131
DISPUTE THE FACTS OF THE CASE 
WHICH ARE CLEAR. THAT'S WHY 

11:43:42.741 --> 11:43:48.321
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH TODAY WITH 
DISTRACTING AND IRRELEVANT 

11:43:48.539 --> 11:43:51.005
ISSUES. EVEN I WOULD SAY OTHER 

11:43:55.246 --> 11:43:57.586
THINGS. IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS 
AN ABUSE OF POWER FOR THE 

11:43:57.802 --> 11:44:00.310
PRESIDENT OR ANY MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS FOR THAT MATTER TO 

11:44:00.456 --> 11:44:05.387
CONDITION OFFICIAL ACTIONS ON 
THEIR OWN PERSONAL GAIN. AND I 

11:44:05.607 --> 11:44:11.713
WAS STARTLED, I WAS STARTLED TO 
HEAR MR. RATCLIFFE SAY, I WAS 

11:44:11.929 --> 11:44:14.314
IMPRESSED BY HIS HONESTY BUT 
STARTLED TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT IT

11:44:14.530 --> 11:44:16.761
IS OKAY FOR A PRESIDENT TO 
INVITE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

11:44:20.484 --> 11:44:23.002
IN OUR ELECTIONS. IT IS OKAY FOR
A PRESIDENT TO CHEAT AND TRY TO 

11:44:23.336 --> 11:44:25.336
RIG THE ELECTION. THE URGENCY OF
THIS IMPEACHMENT, THE REASON WHY

11:44:25.506 --> 11:44:28.908
WE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT 
ELECTION, IS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

11:44:29.048 --> 11:44:31.048
HAS 

11:44:33.921 --> 11:44:36.799
TRIED TO RIGOLETS, LAST ELECTION
AND THIS ONE TOO AND HE'S 

11:44:36.990 --> 11:44:39.389
REPEATING IT. HE GOES OUT ON THE
FLOOR AND HE SAYS CHINA WANTED 

11:44:39.614 --> 11:44:42.084
TO COME IN AND TRY TO RIG THE 
ELECTION. HE HAD MR. GIULIANI IN

11:44:42.299 --> 11:44:46.127
THE UKRAINE PAST WEEK TRYING TO 
ENLIST ASSISTANCE TO 

11:44:51.138 --> 11:44:53.741
RIG THE ELECTION.
THE PRESIDENT MUST BE IMPEACHED.

11:44:53.888 --> 11:44:55.888
TO SAFEGUARD THE SECURITY OF OUR
ELECTIONS, TO SAFEGUARD THE 

11:44:55.931 --> 11:44:57.931
SEPARATIONS OF POWERS, BOTH 

11:45:00.200 --> 11:45:01.992
OF WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO 
SAFEGUARD OUR LIBERTIES. I THINK

11:45:01.993 --> 11:45:04.186
THE GENTLEMAN FOR GILDING. I 
YIELD MY TIME BACK TO HIM. 

11:45:04.187 --> 11:45:08.914
&gt;&gt; SINCE I'VE BEEN REFERENCED, 
MAY I RESPOND? 

11:45:08.915 --> 11:45:10.731
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT YIELD MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt; MR. SWALWELL'S TIME. 

11:45:10.732 --> 11:45:12.732
&gt;&gt; I 

11:45:15.222 --> 11:45:16.664
DO NOT YIELD. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 

11:45:16.665 --> 11:45:18.239
&gt;&gt; DON'T WANT TO CORRECT A FALSE
STATEMENT? 

11:45:18.240 --> 11:45:21.876
&gt;&gt; WHO ELSE SEEKS RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE -- 

11:45:21.877 --> 11:45:23.422
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

11:45:23.423 --> 11:45:27.378
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM

11:45:27.595 --> 11:45:29.603
TEXAS. 
&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE. 

11:45:29.747 --> 11:45:31.821
YIELDING TO CORRECT THE RECORD 
WHERE THE CHAIRMAN JUST MADE A 

11:45:32.592 --> 11:45:38.823
FALSE STATEMENT. SAID THAT I 
SAID THAT IT WAS OKAY TO SOLICIT

11:45:39.038 --> 11:45:43.444
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN AN 
ELECTION. I NEVER USED THE WORD 

11:45:44.967 --> 11:45:45.738
INTERFERENCE. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

11:45:45.739 --> 11:45:51.397
&gt;&gt; I SAID FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN
INVESTIGATIONS. AND I USED AS AN

11:45:51.613 --> 11:45:55.561
EXAMPLE FOR THAT CAR THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. JUST A FEW HOURS

11:45:55.778 --> 11:45:57.778
AGO YOU 

11:46:00.699 --> 11:46:03.512
MAY NOT REMEMBER, I CAN'T 
BELIEVE WE ARE SITTING HERE AT 

11:46:04.176 --> 11:46:06.176
THE END 

11:46:08.542 --> 11:46:10.311
OF THIS, IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IN 
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 

11:46:10.312 --> 11:46:12.312
AND I LOOK AT HOW ALL 

11:46:15.375 --> 11:46:19.116
OF THIS STARTED. STARTED WITH A 
PHONE CALL, A CONGRATULATORY 

11:46:20.180 --> 11:46:24.738
PHONE CALL BETWEEN TWO 
PRESIDENTS. AND THE 

11:46:29.746 --> 11:46:35.817
VERY NEXT DAY, SOMEONE CONTACTED
SOMEONE AND A WEEK LATER, 

11:46:36.082 --> 11:46:39.070
SOMEONE WALKED INTO THE OFFICE 
OF CHAIRMAN SCHIFF. AND THAT 

11:46:39.209 --> 11:46:45.654
PERSON WALKED OUT A WEEK LATER, 
A WHISTLEBLOWER, WENT TO THE 

11:46:45.873 --> 11:46:49.289
INSPECTOR GENERAL, AND FILED A 
COMPLAINT WHERE THEY FALSELY 

11:46:49.512 --> 11:46:51.734
CLAIMED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD

11:46:54.998 --> 11:46:56.998
MADE A DEMAND OF PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY. THEY MADE A FALSE 

11:46:57.038 --> 11:47:02.054
STATEMENT IN WRITING AND THEN 
THEY MADE A FALSE STATEMENT 

11:47:02.273 --> 11:47:04.725
VERBALLY. IN THE COURSE OF WHAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN 

11:47:04.918 --> 11:47:06.918
INVESTIGATION. WE SIT HERE TODAY
ABOUT TO VOTE ON IMPEACHING A 

11:47:07.111 --> 11:47:10.966
PRESIDENT WHERE NEITHER THE 
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THE 

11:47:11.109 --> 11:47:14.220
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE OR 
ANY HOUSE COMMITTEE WHERE THE 

11:47:14.442 --> 11:47:18.673
DEMOCRATS ARE IN CHARGE HAS 
ASKED A SINGLE QUESTION OF A 

11:47:20.199 --> 11:47:24.060
SINGLE WITNESS ABOUT HOW THIS 
STARTED. BECAUSE YOU GO BACK TO 

11:47:26.262 --> 11:47:29.393
THAT PHONE CALL. AND THE TWO 
PEOPLE THAT WERE ON IT, THE ONLY

11:47:29.606 --> 11:47:34.084
TWO PEOPLE THAT KNOW NOT JUST 
WHAT THEY SAID BUT WHAT THEY 

11:47:34.761 --> 11:47:39.797
MEANT, WHEN THEY SAID IT, AND 
THEY BOTH SAID IT WAS 

11:47:42.838 --> 11:47:49.001
A GREAT CALL. SO FIRST LET ME 
SAY I'M SORRY. LET ME SAY I'M 

11:47:49.218 --> 11:47:51.218
SORRY TO THE PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE. I'M SORRY THAT AS A 

11:47:51.888 --> 11:47:56.223
RESULT OF ALL OF THIS YOU'VE 
BEEN LABELED A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR

11:47:56.711 --> 11:48:00.848
BY MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. AND
I'M SORRY THAT THEY PRETEND TO 

11:48:01.072 --> 11:48:04.006
CARE ABOUT THE UKRAINE BUT 
THEY'VE JUST MADE IT INCREDIBLY 

11:48:04.443 --> 11:48:11.166
HARD AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR
COUNTRY EVER TO GET MILITARY 

11:48:12.899 --> 11:48:17.365
ASSISTANCE. I'M ALSO SORRY TO 
THE OTHER PERSON THAT WAS ON 

11:48:17.587 --> 11:48:21.641
THAT CALL, WHO KNEW WHAT HE SAID
WHEN HE MEANT 

11:48:26.654 --> 11:48:28.654
IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP. I'M SORRY

11:48:30.905 --> 11:48:32.905
, PRESIDENT TRUMP, THAT YOU'VE 
TRIED TO KEEP EVERY PROMISE, 

11:48:33.096 --> 11:48:35.281
YOU'VE GIVEN US A GREAT ECONOMY,
AND YOU DID IT AGAINST 

11:48:35.501 --> 11:48:37.488
INCREDIBLE HEADWINDS WHERE YOU 
WERE FALSELY ACCUSED OF TREASON,

11:48:37.489 --> 11:48:39.768
YOU WERE ACCUSED OF BEING A 
RUSSIAN AGENT. BY THE FOLKS IN 

11:48:39.985 --> 11:48:44.247
THIS ROOM. AND WHEN THAT FAILED,
WE SIT HERE TODAY, BECAUSE NOW 

11:48:44.466 --> 11:48:52.133
THEY ARE FRAMING YOU BECAUSE YOU
SAID I'D LIKE YOU TO DO US A 

11:48:52.346 --> 11:48:54.346
FAVOR. BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS 
BEEN 

11:48:58.684 --> 11:49:02.658
THROUGH A LOT.
MY LAST APOLOGY IS TO THE 

11:49:02.874 --> 11:49:06.738
AMERICAN PEOPLE. I'M SORRY THAT 
YOU'VE HAD TO VIEW THIS 

11:49:06.972 --> 11:49:11.749
SPECTACLE. I'M SORRY TO THE 63 
MILLION OF YOU THAT ARE SO 

11:49:11.963 --> 11:49:15.072
DEPLORABLE THAT AS A RESULT OF 
THIS YOU'RE BEING TOLD YOUR 

11:49:15.214 --> 11:49:17.214
VOTES DON'T 

11:49:20.352 --> 11:49:22.062
COUNT. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK AS WELL. 

11:49:22.063 --> 11:49:25.545
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
DOES ANYONE ELSE SEEK 

11:49:26.527 --> 11:49:27.339
RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; RECOGNITION. 

11:49:27.340 --> 11:49:28.709
&gt;&gt; MR. RESCHENTHALER. 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

11:49:28.710 --> 11:49:33.342
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN HERE A WHILE. AND 

11:49:33.484 --> 11:49:36.208
I DO WANT IT TO BE NOTED I HAVE 
SEVERAL OTHER AMENDMENTS FOR 

11:49:36.424 --> 11:49:39.911
TONIGHT BUT SPEAKING ON THIS 
AMENDMENT, SPEAKING IN SUPPORT 

11:49:40.128 --> 11:49:44.070
OF MY COLLEAGUE JIM JORDAN'S  
AMENDMENT, I THINK THAT WE ARE 

11:49:45.054 --> 11:49:47.681
GETTING WAY TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE
WEEDS IN PARTICULAR. WE'VE GOT 

11:49:47.827 --> 11:49:52.499
TO ZOOM OUT AND THINK ABOUT WHY 
WE ARE HERE. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE

11:49:53.187 --> 11:49:58.054
THE DEMOCRATS AGAIN ARE 
TERRIFIED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 

11:49:58.206 --> 11:50:02.242
GOING TO WIN REELECTION. LET'S 
GO THROUGH A LIST OF HIS 

11:50:02.458 --> 11:50:03.753
ACCOMPLISHMENTS. DONALD TRUMP 
SIGNED THE LARGEST SCALE 

11:50:03.754 --> 11:50:07.885
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM 
LEGISLATION IN DECADES. AND I 

11:50:08.029 --> 11:50:13.165
SHOULD ADD IF IT WEREN'T FOR 
THIS WASTE OF TIME WITH 

11:50:13.383 --> 11:50:16.388
IMPEACHMENT, WE COULD BE WORKING
ON MORE BIPARTISAN CRIMINAL 

11:50:18.627 --> 11:50:20.627
JUSTICE REFORM PARTICULARLY 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL CALLED 

11:50:21.296 --> 11:50:28.061
CLEAN SLATE THAT WOULD EXPUNGE 
NONVIOLENT FELONY OFFENSES FOR 

11:50:28.743 --> 11:50:32.367
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
INDIVIDUALS, 

11:50:37.369 --> 11:50:39.941
LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER IS WORKING 
WITH ME ON THAT. SHE'S A 

11:50:40.080 --> 11:50:42.367
DEMOCRAT AS YOU KNOW. I DIGRESS 
AGAIN. DONALD TRUMP IS ALSO 

11:50:42.681 --> 11:50:44.883
ENSURING OUR WAR FIGHTERS TO BE 
WAR FIGHTERS. I WAS A DEFENSE 

11:50:45.024 --> 11:50:48.003
ATTORNEY IN THE NAVY. I DEFENDED
A NAVY S.E.A.L. WHO WAS FALSELY 

11:50:48.224 --> 11:50:50.224
ACCUSED OF COVERING UP ABUSE 

11:50:52.842 --> 11:50:55.304
ON A WELL-KNOWN TERRORIST. I CAN
TELL YOU THAT WHEN OUR WAR 

11:50:55.523 --> 11:50:57.523
FIGHTERS ARE DRAGGED INTO 

11:51:01.408 --> 11:51:03.220
THE COURT-MARTIAL PROCESS, THEY 
HAVE TO CONSTANTLY SECOND-GUESS 

11:51:03.221 --> 11:51:05.897
THEMSELVES ON THE BATTLEFIELD 
AND FINALLY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT 

11:51:06.115 --> 11:51:09.430
THAT IS RECOGNIZING THE WAR 
FIGHTERS SHOULD BE WAR FIGHTERS 

11:51:12.150 --> 11:51:14.185
AND THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON 
CAPTURING AND KILLING TARGETS. 

11:51:14.329 --> 11:51:17.564
NOT WORRYING ABOUT WRONGFUL 
PROSECUTION BACK AT HOME. 

11:51:17.706 --> 11:51:19.393
ADDITIONALLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
PLACED TWO CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES

11:51:19.394 --> 11:51:23.317
ON THE SUPREME COURT WILL UPHOLD
THE CONSTITUTION. ADDITIONALLY 

11:51:23.458 --> 11:51:29.727
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WE ARE
SEEING THE NATURAL GAS 

11:51:29.941 --> 11:51:33.016
RENAISSANCE. COME TO WESTERN 
PENNSYLVANIA AND SEE HOW THE 

11:51:33.219 --> 11:51:35.379
ECONOMY IS ROARING BECAUSE WE 
ARE FINALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 

11:51:35.619 --> 11:51:40.999
THE NATURAL RESOURCES WE HAVE. 
WE CAN USE THIS NATURAL GAS FOR 

11:51:41.220 --> 11:51:43.220
ENERGY, FOR MANUFACTURING, WE 
CAN USE 

11:51:46.033 --> 11:51:47.996
IT FOR PETROCHEMICALS. IT IS 
FANTASTIC WE ARE FINALLY TAKING 

11:51:47.997 --> 11:51:50.423
ADVANTAGE OF THE NATURAL 
RESOURCES WE HAVE. ADDITIONALLY 

11:51:50.574 --> 11:51:52.574
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE A 

11:51:56.161 --> 11:51:57.763
LOT FOR MANUFACTURING. 
PARTICULARLY THE STEEL INDUSTRY 

11:51:57.764 --> 11:51:59.764
WHICH IS COMING BACK AND COME TO
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. STEAL 

11:51:59.834 --> 11:52:04.049
MANUFACTURING IS COMING BACK. 
DONALD TRUMP IS ALSO INVESTING 

11:52:04.263 --> 11:52:06.263
AND FOCUSED IN OUR BORDER 
SECURITY AND 

11:52:09.328 --> 11:52:12.145
BUILDING A WALL. UNDER THIS 
PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE ARE 

11:52:12.363 --> 11:52:14.774
ENHANCING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 
AND GOING AFTER TERRORISTS AND 

11:52:14.914 --> 11:52:19.157
OTHERS WHO WISH TO DO US HARM. 
BUT AGAIN WE ARE HERE BECAUSE 

11:52:19.352 --> 11:52:23.807
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE RED-HOT TRUMP ECONOMY.

11:52:23.964 --> 11:52:26.019
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 

11:52:26.696 --> 11:52:30.456
50 YEARS. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE 
DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO TALK 

11:52:30.671 --> 11:52:36.702
ABOUT HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
FINALLY HOLDING CHINA 

11:52:36.843 --> 11:52:38.843
ACCOUNTABLE FOR CURRENCY MILLER 
CREATION, DUMPING STEAL AND 

11:52:38.917 --> 11:52:42.085
ALUMINUM IN AMERICAN MARKETS, 
SOMEONE IS 

11:52:45.891 --> 11:52:47.504
FINALLY HOLDING CHINA 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR IP THEFT AND 

11:52:47.505 --> 11:52:49.505
FORCED IP TRANSFER. THAT'S 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO 

11:52:52.117 --> 11:52:53.859
IS DOING THAT. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS ALSO RENEGOTIATING TRADE 

11:52:53.860 --> 11:52:55.860
DEALS TO BENEFIT AMERICAN 
WORKERS AND FARMERS. WE 

11:52:59.803 --> 11:53:02.165
SHOULD HAVE PASSED USMCA MONTHS 
AGO BUT AGAIN WE HAVEN'T DONE IT

11:53:02.383 --> 11:53:06.787
BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH 
IMPEACHMENT. THE PRESIDENT HAS 

11:53:07.001 --> 11:53:09.001
WORKED ON FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS 
WITH JAPAN. HE WORKED ON FREE 

11:53:09.215 --> 11:53:13.732
TRADE AGREEMENTS ACROSS SOUTH 
AMERICA. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

11:53:14.960 --> 11:53:18.980
ALSO REDUCED REGULATION. THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO INCREASE REVENUE

11:53:20.295 --> 11:53:22.295
AND 

11:53:23.468 --> 11:53:25.691
THAT'S TO INCREASE GDP. THERE'S 
ONLY TWO WAYS TO INCREASE GDP. 

11:53:25.842 --> 11:53:29.950
YOU CUT TAXES OR REDUCE  
REGULATIONS. YOU CAN DO BOTH. 

11:53:30.090 --> 11:53:32.090
THIS PRESIDENT SUPPORTS BOTH. 
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE SUCH 

11:53:36.562 --> 11:53:38.483
A STRONG ECONOMY. BUT THE 
DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO TALK 

11:53:38.484 --> 11:53:40.173
ABOUT THIS. SO INSTEAD WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. 

11:53:40.174 --> 11:53:41.830
BECAUSE IT DISTRACTS FROM THE 
AGENDA. WHICH INCLUDES SUCH 

11:53:41.831 --> 11:53:43.831
LUDICROUS IDEAS AS 

11:53:48.281 --> 11:53:49.605
BANNING AIRPLANES, GETTING 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 

11:53:49.606 --> 11:53:51.163
TAXPAYER-FUNDED HEALTHCARE, 
ABOLISHING OR DEFUNDING I.C.E., 

11:53:51.164 --> 11:53:55.647
BANNING FRACKING, BANNING FOSSIL
FUELS, GOOD LUCK MAKING A 

11:53:58.843 --> 11:53:59.914
CELL PHONE WITHOUT 
PETROCHEMICALS. THEY ALSO DON'T 

11:53:59.915 --> 11:54:01.939
WANT TO TALK ABOUT TAKING 
PRIVATE HEALTHCARE AWAY FROM 

11:54:02.166 --> 11:54:07.220
AMERICAN CITIZENS. SO AGAIN 
THAT'S REALLY WHY WE ARE HERE. 

11:54:07.362 --> 11:54:09.219
THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS A 
DISTRACTION. IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO 

11:54:09.220 --> 11:54:13.227
HIDE A RADICAL FAR LEFT AGENDA. 
IT'S ALSO AN ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE

11:54:13.449 --> 11:54:17.663
FACTS. THE FACTS INDICATE THAT 
THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO AND 

11:54:17.885 --> 11:54:20.685
THERE WAS NO OBSTRUCTION OF 
CONGRESS. WITH THAT I YIELD. 

11:54:20.838 --> 11:54:22.838
&gt;&gt; THE 

11:54:26.367 --> 11:54:28.281
GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.
MR. CICILLINE? 

11:54:28.282 --> 11:54:30.009
&gt;&gt; I MOVE TO STRIKE. 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

11:54:30.010 --> 11:54:33.719
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS IMPORTANT TO REMIND 
MY COLLEAGUES WHY WE ARE HERE. 

11:54:33.860 --> 11:54:37.429
OF COURSE WE HAVE POLICY 
DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE 

11:54:37.644 --> 11:54:39.898
PRESIDENT, THIS IS NOT ABOUT A 
POLICY DISAGREEMENTS. THIS IS 

11:54:40.751 --> 11:54:43.368
ABOUT AN OBLIGATION WE HAVE TO 
PROTECT AND DEFEND THE 

11:54:43.584 --> 11:54:45.907
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. WE ALL BEGAN OUR TERM OF

11:54:46.585 --> 11:54:51.153
OFFICE BY RAISING HER RIGHT HAND
AND PROMISING TO PROTECT AND 

11:54:51.596 --> 11:54:53.596
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AND WE 
ARE HERE BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT 

11:54:53.598 --> 11:54:57.993
OF THE UNITED STATES ENGAGED IN 
A SCHEME TO DRAG A FOREIGN POWER

11:54:58.219 --> 11:55:03.165
INTO OUR ELECTIONS TO CORRUPT 
OUR ELECTIONS FOR HIS OWN 

11:55:03.389 --> 11:55:06.520
PERSONAL BENEFIT AND HE USED 
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

11:55:06.677 --> 11:55:11.801
OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO ATTEMPT TO 
ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE. THINK 

11:55:11.943 --> 11:55:14.624
ABOUT THIS. THERE IS NOTHING 
MORE SACRED THAN PROTECTING THE 

11:55:14.845 --> 11:55:17.676
RIGHT TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS
IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S THE HEART 

11:55:17.887 --> 11:55:19.887
AND SOUL 

11:55:23.581 --> 11:55:25.581
OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

11:55:34.226 --> 11:55:36.407
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES REACHED OUT TO A FOREIGN 

11:55:36.630 --> 11:55:39.040
POWER IN AN ATTEMPT TO DRAG THEM
INTO CORRUPTING OUR ELECTIONS TO

11:55:39.256 --> 11:55:41.901
HELP HIM CHEAT AND WIN IN THE 
ELECTION IN 2020. AND SO WHEN MY

11:55:42.115 --> 11:55:44.109
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SAY PEOPLE
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE ELECTION 

11:55:44.110 --> 11:55:46.272
WE ARE WORRIED. BUT THE PERSON 
WHO IS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE 

11:55:46.490 --> 11:55:48.265
OUTCOME IS CLEARLY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. BECAUSE HE IS REACHING 

11:55:48.266 --> 11:55:50.913
OUT TO A FOREIGN POWER ASKING 
THEM TO HELP HIM CHEAT IN THE 

11:55:51.129 --> 11:55:53.129
2020 ELECTION. WE HAVE A SOLEMN 
RESPONSIBILITY TO STAND UP AND 

11:55:53.302 --> 11:55:55.302
PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY AND 
PREVENT THIS 

11:55:58.110 --> 11:55:59.910
PRESIDENT OR ANY PRESIDENT FROM 
ATTEMPTING TO CORRUPT OUR 

11:55:59.911 --> 11:56:02.088
ELECTIONS. SO IF WE DON'T DO 
THAT, IF WE ALLOW PRESIDENT 

11:56:02.304 --> 11:56:05.905
TRUMP TO GET AWAY WITH TRYING TO
CHEAT IN 2020, PARTICULARLY IN 

11:56:06.053 --> 11:56:10.159
LIGHT OF WHAT HE DID IN 2016, WE
WON'T HAVE A DEMOCRACY. WE'LL 

11:56:10.301 --> 11:56:12.301
HAVE A KING 

11:56:14.948 --> 11:56:16.948
OR A MONARCH. THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR VOICE AND

11:56:17.080 --> 11:56:18.810
THEIR RIGHT TO 
SELF-DETERMINATION AND TO ELECT 

11:56:18.811 --> 11:56:23.844
THEIR OWN LEADERS. SO MY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SHOULD 

11:56:24.059 --> 11:56:25.378
REMEMBER THAT TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, MANY 

11:56:25.379 --> 11:56:29.266
OF THEM SAW THIS SCHEME AND 
BECAME ALARMED. THE PRESIDENT'S 

11:56:29.484 --> 11:56:32.335
OWN AMBASSADOR ESTHER BOLTON 
CALLED IT A 

11:56:35.739 --> 11:56:37.505
DRUG  DEAL. DR. FIONA HILL, 
ANOTHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

11:56:37.506 --> 11:56:40.191
OFFICIAL, CALLED IT A DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL 

11:56:44.878 --> 11:56:46.349
ERRANDS. THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN
BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. 

11:56:46.350 --> 11:56:49.797
17 WITNESSES, 100 HOURS OF 
TESTIMONY, 260 TEXT MESSAGES. 

11:56:49.947 --> 11:56:51.862
TRANSCRIPTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
OWN WORDS ON THE CALL. E-MAILS 

11:56:51.863 --> 11:56:56.293
EXCHANGED BETWEEN HIGH-LEVEL 
TRUMP OFFICIALS. AND WE KNOW THE

11:56:56.810 --> 11:56:59.022
DIRECT EVIDENCE. THE PRESIDENT 
PUT 

11:57:04.020 --> 11:57:07.047
THE THREE AMIGOS, SONDLAND, 
PERRY AND VOLKER CHARGE OF THIS.

11:57:07.190 --> 11:57:09.431
THE PRESIDENT REFUSED TO HAVE A 
MEETING OR TO RELEASE THE FUNDS 

11:57:09.648 --> 11:57:14.482
PUT ON HOLD UNTIL A PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BOGUS 

11:57:14.622 --> 11:57:16.360
INVESTIGATION AGAINST HIS CHIEF 
POLITICAL RIVAL. HE TOLD THE 

11:57:16.361 --> 11:57:20.051
VICE PRESIDENT DON'T GO TO THE 
INAUGURATION. SPOKE TO 

11:57:20.205 --> 11:57:22.420
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND SONDLAND
TESTIFIED IT WAS A QUID PRO QUO.

11:57:22.565 --> 11:57:25.474
THE PRESIDENT HIRED HIS PERSONAL
LAWYER 

11:57:30.472 --> 11:57:35.125
RUDY GIULIANI TO LEAD THIS 
EFFORT. HE SMEARED AMBASSADOR 

11:57:35.329 --> 11:57:37.329
YOVANOVITCH AND FIRED HER 
BECAUSE SHE STOOD IN THE WAY. 

11:57:37.462 --> 11:57:39.462
SHE WAS AN ANTICORRUPTION 
CHAMPION AND SHE STOOD IN THE 

11:57:39.493 --> 11:57:41.493
WAY OF THE PRESIDENT'S SCHEMES. 
AND THE PRESIDENT AND THOSE 

11:57:41.498 --> 11:57:45.100
ACTING ON HIS BEHALF DEMANDED 
THAT ZELENSKY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE 

11:57:45.318 --> 11:57:48.731
INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS CHIEF 
POLITICAL RIVAL. IT SHOULD BE 

11:57:48.948 --> 11:57:53.424
REMEMBERED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
SHOULD KNOW THAT PRESIDENT 

11:57:53.638 --> 11:57:57.243
ZELENSKY, THE EVIDENCE IS FILLED
WITH EXAMPLES OF TRUMP 

11:57:57.460 --> 11:57:59.460
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WHO 

11:58:04.444 --> 11:58:07.012
SAY THINGS LIKE PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY IS SENSITIVE ABOUT 

11:58:07.361 --> 11:58:09.031
UKRAINE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY. 
NOT MERELY AS AN INSTRUMENT IN 

11:58:09.032 --> 11:58:10.446
WASHINGTON DOMESTIC REELECTION 
POLITICS. BUT AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

11:58:10.447 --> 11:58:14.147
HAS A CALL WITH SONDLAND SAYING 
DURING OUR CALL SONDLAND TRIED 

11:58:14.369 --> 11:58:17.567
TO EXPLAIN TO ME THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS A BUSINESSMAN AND ABOUT

11:58:18.885 --> 11:58:21.833
TO SIGN A CHECK AS SOMEONE WHO 
OWES HIM SOMETHING THE 

11:58:22.049 --> 11:58:25.569
BUSINESSMAN ASKED THAT PERSON TO
PAY UP BEFORE SIGNING THE CHECK 

11:58:25.796 --> 11:58:28.475
AND I ARGUE TO VOLKER AND 

11:58:33.050 --> 11:58:35.060
TAYLOR, DONALD TRUMP ISN'T OUT 
ANYTHING BY THE UKRAINIANS. AND 

11:58:35.204 --> 11:58:37.204
I, QUOTE, IN HOLDING UP SECURITY
ASSISTANCE FOR DOMESTIC 

11:58:37.567 --> 11:58:41.085
POLITICAL GAIN, IS CRAZY. SO 
THERE IS TREMENDOUS EVIDENCE IN 

11:58:41.303 --> 11:58:44.677
THE RECORD. THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES ATTEMPTED TO 

11:58:44.897 --> 11:58:48.738
LEVERAGE FOREIGN MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE TO DRAG A 

11:58:48.882 --> 11:58:52.107
FOREIGN POWER TO CORRUPT OUR 
ELECTIONS AND ALLOW HIM TO CHEAT

11:58:52.251 --> 11:58:54.251
IN 2020. 

11:59:35.556 --> 11:59:42.326
C1 
&gt;&gt; ANYONE ELSE SEEK RECOGNITION 

11:59:42.636 --> 11:59:45.415
ON THE AMENDMENT? 
&gt;&gt; MR. ARMSTRONG 

11:59:45.416 --> 11:59:46.825

11:59:50.246 --> 11:59:53.316

TRUST, OR PROFIT UNDER THE 
UNITED STATES. AT NUMEROUS TIMES

12:00:06.336 --> 12:00:09.816
DURING TODAY'S DEBATE MY FRIENDS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

12:00:10.116 --> 12:00:17.346
HELD UP A POCKET CONSTITUTION 
AND WAVED IT AROUND. I THINK 

12:00:17.656 --> 12:00:20.646
IT'S INTERESTING THAT NOBODY 
READ FROM THAT, AND I WILL READ 

12:00:20.976 --> 12:00:24.116
FROM IT ARTICLE 1 SECTION 2 
CLAUSE 5. THE HOUSE OF 

12:00:24.426 --> 12:00:26.536
REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CHOOSE 
THEIR SPEAKER AND OTHER OFFICERS

12:00:26.836 --> 12:00:30.516
AND SHALL HAVE THE SOLE POWER OF
IMPEACHMENT. ARTICLE 1, SECTION 

12:00:30.816 --> 12:00:35.616
2 DEALS WITH THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES. ARTICLE 1 

12:00:35.916 --> 12:00:42.406
SECTION 3 DEALS WITH THE SENATE.
THE SENATE SHALL HAVE THE SOLE 

12:00:43.826 --> 12:00:47.036
POWER TO TRIAL IMPEACHMENTS. 
ARTICLE 1 SECTION 3 CLAUSE 6, 

12:00:47.336 --> 12:00:52.016
IMPEACHMENT WILL NOT EXTEND 
FURTHER FROM REMOVAL FROM OFFICE

AND DISQUALIFICATION TO ENJOY

ARTICLE 1, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 7. 

12:01:01.526 --> 12:01:05.036
THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS 
OVERBROAD, GIVES THE U.S. HOUSE 

12:01:05.336 --> 12:01:08.366
OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THIS 
IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE MORE POWER 

12:01:09.316 --> 12:01:12.726
THAN THE INSTITUTION ALLOWS. WE 
HAVE HEARD THROUGH THE COURSE OF

12:01:13.106 --> 12:01:17.026
THIS INVESTIGATION WHEN WE HAVE 
COMPLAIN BODY PROCESS, WHEN WE 

12:01:17.326 --> 12:01:20.716
HAVE TALKED ABOUT SECRECY, NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO USE MINORITY RIGHT 

12:01:21.016 --> 12:01:23.316
THIS IS IS 

12:01:27.226 --> 12:01:30.526
AKIN TO A SPECIAL COUNSEL. ADAM 
SCHIFF HAS REFERRED TO HIMSELF 

12:01:30.836 --> 12:01:32.836
AS 

12:01:34.526 --> 12:01:39.626
SPECIAL COUNSEL. WE ARE BECOMING
THE JUDGE, JURY, AND 

12:01:39.926 --> 12:01:42.716
EXECUTIONER. OFFICIALLY, WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE SENATE IS THERE 

12:01:43.016 --> 12:01:47.536
IS A 2/3 VOTE IF AN IMPEACHMENT 
IS GRANTED. THEN A SIMPLE 

12:01:47.836 --> 12:01:52.696
MAJORITY IN WHICH TO SAY WHETHER
THEY WILL HOLD ANOTHER OFFICE. 

12:01:52.996 --> 12:01:57.736
WHILE THE HOUSE HAS THE SOLE 
POWER OF IMPEACH, THE SENATE 

12:01:58.036 --> 12:02:00.526
PROVIDES, THE INSTITUTIONS 
PROVIDES THAT THEY WILL HAVE A 

12:02:00.826 --> 12:02:08.226
-- 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO -- 

12:02:08.536 --> 12:02:11.146
&gt;&gt; THE CONSTITUTION DESCRIBES 
THE SENATE'S'S POWER, AND THE 

12:02:11.446 --> 12:02:14.246
DEMOCRAT ARTICLE WAS IMPEACHMENT
STATE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 

12:02:14.736 --> 12:02:18.416
REMOVED FROM OFFICE AND 
DISQUALIFIED TO HOLD FUTURE 

12:02:18.906 --> 12:02:21.146
OFFICE. THE HOUSE HAS NO 
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO 

12:02:21.436 --> 12:02:27.916
INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE TO SUGGEST 
THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 

12:02:28.226 --> 12:02:31.236
REMOVED FROM OFFICE. AT BEST 
IT'S UNNECESSARY AND AT WORST 

12:02:31.746 --> 12:02:34.836
IT'S OVERBROAD. TO INCLUDE THE 
LANGUAGE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

12:02:35.136 --> 12:02:38.126
SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM 
OFFICE IS PREJUDICIAL TO THE 

12:02:38.426 --> 12:02:40.426
CONSTITUTIONALLY DESCRIBED 
PROCESS THAT THE SENATE WILL 

12:02:40.706 --> 12:02:44.456
TAKE UP. I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND 
FROM OHIO AND OTHERS FROM MY 

12:02:44.746 --> 12:02:49.746
SIDE T SHOWS THE TRUE MOTIVES OF
THE SEPTEMBER. IT'S CIRCUMSTANCE

12:02:50.236 --> 12:02:58.026
HOW THIS HAS GONE. IT STARTED IN
2016 AND NOW IN 2020 WE HAVE 

12:02:58.326 --> 12:03:01.626
COLLUSION, CONSPIRACY, 
OBSTRUCTION, QUID PRO QUO, 

12:03:01.936 --> 12:03:04.836
BRIBERY, EXTORTION, ALL THESE 
CRIMES AND WE COME TO THE 

12:03:05.136 --> 12:03:08.466
NEBULAS PART OF THIS. THERE ARE 
SMART LAWYERS ON THE OTHER SIDE 

12:03:08.766 --> 12:03:12.876
OF THE CASE SO I DON'T IMAGINE 
THIS IS AN OMISSION. WHAT WE ARE

12:03:13.186 --> 12:03:16.496
TRULY DOING IS TAKING POWER AWAY
FROM THE UNITED STATES SENATE AT

12:03:16.796 --> 12:03:19.786
THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. YOU HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH THIS. 

12:03:20.086 --> 12:03:23.916
WE KNOW THIS. WE HAVE SEEN HOW 
THIS HAS GONE. IT'S BEEN FAST 

12:03:24.216 --> 12:03:27.206
TRACKED AND RAILROADED SINCE DAY
ONE. AND YOU CAN EQUATE YOURSELF

12:03:27.516 --> 12:03:30.736
TO A GRAND JURY, A SPECIAL 
COUNSEL, AND AN INVESTIGATION 

12:03:31.046 --> 12:03:34.566
BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT AS THE 
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO

12:03:35.226 --> 12:03:38.266
BE JUDGE, JURY, AND EXECUTIONER.
YOU MAY SAY THIS LANGUAGE IS 

12:03:38.576 --> 12:03:40.576
RIDICULOUS BUT 

12:03:42.726 --> 12:03:44.726
I 

12:03:46.116 --> 12:03:49.225
THINK IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL. WITH 
THAT, I YIELD BACK. 

12:03:49.226 --> 12:03:53.456
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
ANYONE ELSE SEEK TO BE 

12:03:53.766 --> 12:03:54.985
RECOGNIZED? 
&gt;&gt; LAST WORD? 

12:03:54.986 --> 12:03:58.126
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

12:03:58.426 --> 12:04:02.746
THERE WAS MUCH SAID THIS EVENING
FROM MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES, 

12:04:03.046 --> 12:04:06.816
OPINING FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 
MOTIVE RATHER THAN LOOKING AT 

12:04:07.126 --> 12:04:10.736
HIS OPEN WORDS THEY SEEK TO 
OPINE HIS MOTIVE RATHER THAN 

12:04:11.036 --> 12:04:15.936
LISTENING TO THE DIRECT 
STATEMENTS FROM PRESIDENT 

12:04:16.246 --> 12:04:18.946
ZELENSKY THAT HE FELT NO 
CONDITIONALITY AND NO PRESSURE. 

12:04:19.246 --> 12:04:21.726
BUT THIS AMENDMENT, THIS 
AMENDMENT SHOWS THE TRUE MOTIVE 

12:04:22.026 --> 12:04:26.426
OF THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IT'S 
NOT ABOUT SOME CLEANSING OF THE 

12:04:26.726 --> 12:04:29.036
OFFICE. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOME 
RESTORATION OF NATIONAL 

12:04:29.326 --> 12:04:32.026
SECURITY. IF IT'S ABOUT NATIONAL
SECURITY, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 

12:04:32.336 --> 12:04:36.626
UP IN ARM WHEN IS PRESIDENT 
OBAMA WITHHELD MILITARY AID TO 

12:04:36.926 --> 12:04:40.316
THE UKRANIANS BUT THEY WEREN'T. 
IT'S ALL JUST A SHOW TO 

12:04:40.616 --> 12:04:42.616
DEMONSTRATE AN ATTACK 

12:04:45.926 --> 12:04:49.736
ON THE PRESIDENT. FOUR FACTS 
NEVER CHANGED. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

12:04:51.026 --> 12:04:53.026
AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKY DENY 
CONDITIONALITY. THE TRANSCRIPTS 

12:04:53.136 --> 12:04:58.126
SHOW NO QUID PRO QUO. UKRAINE 
WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY DELAY IN 

12:04:58.426 --> 12:05:01.736
MILITARY AID AT THE OF THE CALL,
AND IT WAS DELIVERED. NOTHING 

12:05:02.026 --> 12:05:05.946
HAS CHANGED THOSE FOUR FACTS BUT
I DO WONDER IF WE HAD HAD THE 

12:05:06.266 --> 12:05:09.216
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WITNESSES 
WHAT MORE WOULD WE HAVE LEARNED 

12:05:09.536 --> 12:05:15.026
BEYOND THAT? IF WE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO CALL CHAIRMAN  

12:05:15.336 --> 12:05:18.836
SCHIFF AS WAY WITNESS MAYBE WE 
WOULD HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HIS 

12:05:19.326 --> 12:05:23.246
CONTACT WITH THE WHISTLEBLOWER. 
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE ASKED 

12:05:24.026 --> 12:05:29.166
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF WHY HE ENGAGED 
IN A WEIRD THEATRICAL 

12:05:29.666 --> 12:05:32.386
PERFORMANCE ABOUT A TRANSCRIPT 
THAT NEVER EXISTED. IT WAS JUST 

12:05:32.696 --> 12:05:38.726
A FAKE THING HE DID IN THE 
INTELLIGENT COMMITTEE. MAYBE WE 

12:05:39.026 --> 12:05:42.726
COULD HAVE ASKED ABOUT HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

12:05:43.026 --> 12:05:51.126
WHISTLEBLOWER. WE COULD HAVE 
ASKED CHAIRMAN SCHIFF HIS REASON

12:05:51.416 --> 12:05:53.726
FOR ADMITTING EXCULPATORY 
EVIDENCE, WHETHER IT WAS HIS 

12:05:54.026 --> 12:05:57.326
DECISION OR SOMEONE ELSE'S 
DECISION TO PUBLISH 

12:05:57.626 --> 12:05:59.626
CORRESPONDENCE AND 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE 

12:05:59.736 --> 12:06:02.326
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER, 
JOURNALISTS, AND EVEN A MEMBER 

12:06:02.626 --> 12:06:05.626
OF CONGRESS. WE COULD HAVE ALSO 
LEARNED A LOT FROM THE 

12:06:05.936 --> 12:06:08.926
WHISTLEBLOWER. WE COULD HAVE 
LEARNED ABOUT WHO THE MULTIPLE 

12:06:09.236 --> 12:06:13.026
SOURCES THAT WERE THEY SPOKE TO 
AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS 

12:06:13.326 --> 12:06:17.046
ACCURATE, WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS 
RELIABLE AND VERIFIABLE. WE 

12:06:17.346 --> 12:06:21.006
COULD HAVE ASKED THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER WHY THE OUTREACH 

12:06:21.306 --> 12:06:24.856
TO CHAIRMAN SCHIFF'S STAFF, 
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A TRULY A 

12:06:25.156 --> 12:06:28.426
SINCERE CONCERN OR A RESULT OF A
POLITICAL BIAS. WE COULD HAVE 

12:06:28.726 --> 12:06:31.326
ASKED THE WHISTLEBLOWER ABOUT 
THE CONTACT WITH THE 

12:06:32.226 --> 12:06:35.416
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. WE COULD 
HAVE ASKED NELLY ORR A LOT OF 

12:06:35.816 --> 12:06:41.126
QUESTIONS, TOO. SHE WAS ON THE 
WITNESS LIST. WE PROBABLY WANTED

12:06:41.426 --> 12:06:46.296
TO KNOW FROM NELLY ORR HOW IS IT
ONE OF THE TOP PEOPLE FROM THE 

12:06:46.596 --> 12:06:49.936
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS A 
SPOUSE TO MOONLIGHT TO TRY AND 

12:06:50.236 --> 12:06:54.206
DIG UP DIRT ON A PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGN AND SEE THE VERY DIRT 

12:06:54.506 --> 12:06:58.646
SHUTTLED INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE AND 

12:07:02.346 --> 12:07:08.336
INJECTED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM OF
THEINTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND 

12:07:08.636 --> 12:07:12.426
ASKED NELLY ORR WHAT WAS ON THE 
THUMB SHE GAVE TO HER HUSBAND. 

12:07:12.726 --> 12:07:17.476
WE WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT 

12:07:21.766 --> 12:07:23.766
OF 

12:07:25.776 --> 12:07:31.946
QUESTIONS FOR ALEXANDRA CHALUPA.
SHE WAS THE INTERMETIARY. WE 

12:07:32.246 --> 12:07:36.016
COULD ASKED WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO
ASSIGN TO THE UKRAINE TO REPAIR 

12:07:37.126 --> 12:07:42.126
OUR ELECTIONS? WHOSE IDEA? WHO 
FUNDED IT? IT WAS A DONOR, AN 

12:07:42.446 --> 12:07:45.226
ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT WAS TRYING
TO BRING UKRAINE INTO OUR 

12:07:45.536 --> 12:07:50.926
ELECTION? WE COULD ASKED WHAT 
WERE YOU TALKING TO? WHAT LET 

12:07:51.236 --> 12:07:53.236
MES WERE 

12:07:55.026 --> 12:07:57.026
ENGAGED 

12:07:59.026 --> 12:08:07.226
IN TRYING TO  GET TRUMP 
DEFEATED? WE HAD OP-EDS 

12:08:08.026 --> 12:08:12.436
ANIMATING THE PRESIDENT, 
LEGITIMIZING HIS CONCERN THAT WE

12:08:12.736 --> 12:08:16.546
OUGHT TO VERIFY ZELENSKY THAT HE
IS THE REAL DEAL THAT HE TURNED 

12:08:16.846 --> 12:08:20.456
OUT TO BE. I DON'T THINK WHAT WE
HAVE LEARNED FROM THESE HEARINGS

12:08:20.756 --> 12:08:22.756
OTHER THAN THE 

12:08:25.436 --> 12:08:31.736
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN UNFAIR IN 
THEIR PROSE, THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

12:08:32.226 --> 12:08:34.226
UNABLE 

12:08:35.826 --> 12:08:38.876
TO EVIDENCE ANYTHING OTHER THAN 
HEARSAY AND CONJECTURE. THAT'S 

12:08:39.176 --> 12:08:44.426
WHY THE HOUSE SAYS BRING  
FORWARD ALL WITNESSES AND 

12:08:44.726 --> 12:08:48.226
EVIDENCE. IT'S CLEAR TO THE 
PRESIDENT DID NOT DO SOMETHING 

12:08:48.536 --> 12:08:52.126
TO JUSTIFY THE IMPEACHMENT BUT I
THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE A LOT 

12:08:52.426 --> 12:08:54.426
MORE 

12:08:55.826 --> 12:09:02.256
TO FULFILL THE PRESIDENT'S  
PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP IF WE

12:09:02.556 --> 12:09:07.926
HAD CONTINUED. 
&gt;&gt; I MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST 

12:09:08.616 --> 12:09:10.115
WORD. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

12:09:10.116 --> 12:09:14.526
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I START BY 
YIELDING TIME TO MY COLLEAGUE OF

12:09:14.826 --> 12:09:16.826
CALIFORNIA. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. THERE IS A 

12:09:16.926 --> 12:09:22.636
DOCTRINE IF YOU CAN'T ARGUE THE 
FACTS, YOU CAN'T ARGUE A LAW, 

12:09:22.926 --> 12:09:26.426
ARGUE A LOT. IN THE CONSTITUTION
IT HAS THE LANGUAGE IN THE 

12:09:26.726 --> 12:09:29.726
ARTICLES, AND I WOULD 

12:09:33.226 --> 12:09:39.426
LIKE TO READ THIS. WHERE 
TZFOREWILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON 

12:09:39.726 --> 12:09:42.926
WAS FOUND TO BE REMOVED FROM 
OFFICE, THE EXACT SAME LANGUAGE 

12:09:43.426 --> 12:09:47.846
THAT IS BEING COMPLAINED ABOUT 
THIS EVENING WITH MR. TRUMP WAS 

12:09:48.146 --> 12:09:51.926
PUT INTO THE ARTICLES BY THE 
REPUBLICANS RELATIVE TO MR. 

12:09:53.816 --> 12:09:55.925
CLINTON, AND I YIELD BACK WITH 
THANKS. 

12:09:55.926 --> 12:09:59.546
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE 
FROM CALIFORNIA. I JUST REMIND 

12:09:59.836 --> 12:10:03.536
YOU, IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY 
COLLEAGUE FROM LOUISIANA THAT 

12:10:05.616 --> 12:10:10.726
THIS WAS EXTRAORDINARY LANGUAGE 
TO GO AFTER DONALD TRUMP. THIS 

12:10:11.016 --> 12:10:13.126
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, WHEN AN 
IMPEACHED JUDGE FROM LOUISIANA 

12:10:13.416 --> 12:10:17.836
WHICH MY COLLEAGUE IS VERY AWARE
OF, WENT OVER TO THE SENATE AND 

12:10:18.626 --> 12:10:22.756
WAS VOTED ON UNANIMOUSLY 96-0 
HAD THE SAME EXACT LANGUAGE IN 

12:10:23.056 --> 12:10:27.126
IT. THERE IS NOTHING 
EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THE LANGUAGE

12:10:27.626 --> 12:10:31.226
IN THIS. WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY 
IS THE GYMNASTICS AND HURDLES 

12:10:31.536 --> 12:10:34.806
THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE ARE GOING THROUGH TO MAKE 

12:10:35.106 --> 12:10:38.676
SURE THAT THEY THROW A WHOLE 
BUNCH OF STUFF AT THE WALL AND 

12:10:38.976 --> 12:10:43.636
HOPE THEY CONFUSE THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, HOPE THAT SOMETHING 

12:10:43.936 --> 12:10:47.936
STICKS. MY FRIEND ON THE OTHER 
SIDE JUST MENTIONED THIS 

12:10:48.246 --> 12:10:51.826
PRESIDENT WANTED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THIS NEW UKRANIAN 

12:10:52.126 --> 12:11:00.656
ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT CORRUPT 
LIKE THE LAST ONE. WELL, HE GAVE

12:11:00.956 --> 12:11:03.346
THE LAST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION 
$550 MILLION. AGAIN, WHAT A 

12:11:03.646 --> 12:11:08.026
JUDGE WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU ARE
ON A JURY IS YOU GET TO APPLY 

12:11:08.326 --> 12:11:13.726
COMMON SENSE. IF IT DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE

12:11:14.016 --> 12:11:18.526
IT. IF YOU GAVE $550 MILLION TO 
AN ADMINISTRATION YOU KNEW WAS 

12:11:18.826 --> 12:11:21.706
CORRUPT, WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN 
2018 AND 2019 BESIDES YOU BEING 

12:11:22.016 --> 12:11:25.426
SCARED TO DEATH OF YOUR NEXT 
POLITICAL OPPONENT? WHAT THE 

12:11:25.716 --> 12:11:28.126
JUDGE WILL ALSO TELL YOU IS THAT

12:11:32.266 --> 12:11:36.126
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE 
EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY SAYS 

12:11:36.516 --> 12:11:42.716
AS FACT. BUT IN THIS CASE, LET'S
LOOK AT THE 

12:11:46.726 --> 12:11:52.116
3 WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED UNDER
OATH, VINDMAN, PURPLE HEART, 

12:11:52.406 --> 12:11:57.016
LIEUTENANT COLONEL. HE SAID IT 
WAS AN INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN.

12:11:57.316 --> 12:12:01.316
TRUMP SUPPORTER SAID IT WAS QUID
PRO QUO. BILL TAYLOR, WEST POINT

12:12:01.826 --> 12:12:05.696
SAID THAT IT WAS CRAZY TO 
WITHHOLD MILITARY AID FOR AN 

12:12:06.426 --> 12:12:11.536
INVESTIGATION ALL UNDER OATH, 
ALL WITH THE PENALTY OF PERJURY.

12:12:11.826 --> 12:12:14.586
WHO DO THEY OFFER 

12:12:18.626 --> 12:12:23.796
ON THE OTHER SIDE? PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 14435 LIES TO DATE SINCE 

12:12:24.106 --> 12:12:28.346
HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT, NOT UNDER
OATH BUT WE SHOULD TAKE HIS WORD

12:12:28.656 --> 12:12:36.596
FOR IT, SO ABSURD BECAUSE IN A 
CALL, WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S 

12:12:36.896 --> 12:12:40.496
VOCABULARY. HE MAY SAY BIGLY OR 
GREAT OR HE MIGHT SAY WINNING A 

12:12:40.796 --> 12:12:42.796
LOT 

12:12:44.026 --> 12:12:48.006
BUT IN THE ORDER  OF AN ORDINARY
CONVERSATION HE DOES NOT SAY 

12:12:51.026 --> 12:12:54.816
QUID PRO QUO. AFTER THE  
WHISTLEBLOWER IS KNOWN TO 

12:12:55.116 --> 12:12:58.906
EVERYBODY HE GETS A CALL, AND 
HEY, I DON'T WANT A QUID PRO 

12:12:59.206 --> 12:13:08.816
QUO. WHY DOES THAT COME FROM? IT
CAME FROM THE FACT THAT YOU ARE 

12:13:09.126 --> 12:13:14.746
GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED LIKE
A KID WITH HIS HAPPENED IN THE 

12:13:15.046 --> 12:13:21.346
COOKIE JAR WITH HIS CRUMBS ON 
HIS MOUTH AND HE SAID I DIDN'T 

12:13:21.646 --> 12:13:25.856
HAVE A COOKIE. HE SAYS I DON'T 
WANT A QUID PRO QUO. I WANT THEM

12:13:26.156 --> 12:13:29.916
TO DO THE RIGHT THING. NO. YOU 
WOULD NOT HAVE HELD UP THEIR 

12:13:30.206 --> 12:13:33.846
VITAL MILITARY AID. THIS IS A 
COUNTRY THAT IS BEING OCCUPIED 

12:13:34.136 --> 12:13:39.226
BY HIS FRIEND PUTIN. HE IS 
HOLDING UP THE VITAL AID FOR 

12:13:39.526 --> 12:13:42.736
THEM TO PROTECT THEIR COUNTRY 
BECAUSE HE SAID IT'S ABOUT 

12:13:43.026 --> 12:13:48.416
CORRUPTION. BUT WE KNOW FROM THE
FACTS IN THE CASE, FROM THE 3 

12:13:48.706 --> 12:13:52.346
PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED UNDER OATH 
THAT ALL THIS WAS ABOUT WAS 

12:13:52.726 --> 12:13:58.426
MAKING SURE THAT HE GETS AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO JOE BIDEN. 

12:13:59.126 --> 12:14:02.406
WHY WAS THAT IMPORTANT? WHEN YOU
PANIC, YOU GO BACK TO WHAT 

12:14:02.706 --> 12:14:07.426
WORKED THE FIRST TIME. AN 
INVESTIGATION WHERE HE GOT TO 

12:14:08.336 --> 12:14:11.836
RUN AROUND THE COUNTRY SAYING 
LOCK HER UP, AND HE FIGURED HE 

12:14:12.126 --> 12:14:18.426
COULD RUN AROUND THE COUNTRY 
SAYING LOCK HIM UP AND IT MIGHT 

12:14:19.126 --> 12:14:21.126
WORK 

12:14:22.316 --> 12:14:27.635
AGAIN. WITH THAT, I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; YIELDED BACK. 

12:14:27.636 --> 12:14:31.416
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU DIDN'T GIVE
US A LOT OF WITNESSES IN THE 

12:14:31.706 --> 12:14:35.346
COMMITTEE AND ONE FACT WITNESS, 
AND WE GOT ONE PROFESSOR, 

12:14:35.646 --> 12:14:39.116
PROFESSOR CURLEY WHO EARLY ON IN
HIS TALKS MENTIONED HE DIDN'T 

12:14:39.416 --> 12:14:42.576
VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT, AND NONE
OF THE OTHER WITNESSES, EITHER. 

12:14:42.876 --> 12:14:45.846
AND ONE THING HE SAID THE 
EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE AGAINST 

12:14:46.146 --> 12:14:48.146
HIM THAT YOU 

12:14:52.726 --> 12:14:56.226
ARE BRINGING THE IMPEACHMENT 
CHARGES ARE ON WAFER THIN 

12:14:56.526 --> 12:15:00.716
EVIDENCE. AND WHAT IS NOT WAFER 
THIN IS THE EFFORTS BY THIS 

12:15:01.026 --> 12:15:04.016
COMMITTEE TO GET RID OF THIS 
PRESIDENT. THEY HAVE BEEN 

12:15:04.316 --> 12:15:07.626
LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO IMPEACH
THE PRESIDENT FOR A LONG TIME, 

12:15:07.926 --> 12:15:11.816
AND NOW THEY HAVE ONE, AND THEY 
KNOW HE WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM

12:15:12.116 --> 12:15:15.916
OFFICE BUT IT'S EMBARRASSING, 
AND IT'S A MARK, AND  

12:15:16.216 --> 12:15:18.616
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE COUNTRY 
SHOULDN'T BE PUT THROUGH THIS. 

12:15:18.916 --> 12:15:23.176
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE
OUGHT TO DO IS LOOK AT THE 

12:15:23.466 --> 12:15:26.046
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED THAT THEY ARE 

12:15:26.386 --> 12:15:29.386
TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF. 
THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT HAS 

12:15:29.686 --> 12:15:33.926
SUCCESSFULLY GROWN THIS ECONOMY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAVINGS 

12:15:34.426 --> 12:15:38.826
ACCOUNTS AND 401K ACCOUNTS OF SO
MANY AMERICANS AND SO MANY 

12:15:39.126 --> 12:15:42.426
RETIREES, THEY ARE UP AS THE 
STOCK MARKET IS, AND THAT WILL 

12:15:42.726 --> 12:15:45.916
NOT GO ON FOREVER BUT THAT IS 
SOMETHING POSITIVE THAT MOST 

12:15:46.216 --> 12:15:50.436
PERSONS TO BE PLEASE BODY, AND 
THERE ARE MORE AMERICANS 

12:15:50.736 --> 12:15:55.846
EMPLOYED THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE
NATION'S HISTORY. MANUFACTURING 

12:15:56.146 --> 12:16:01.826
JOBS WHICH WE USED TO BE HURTING
IN THE COUNTRY AND WAS IN 

12:16:02.136 --> 12:16:04.136
DECLINE FOR A  

12:16:06.946 --> 12:16:10.046
LONG TIME ARE COMING BACK. 
UNEMPLOYMENT, 50-YEAR LOW. 4 

12:16:10.926 --> 12:16:15.256
MILLION AMERICANS NO LONGER NEED
TO RELY  FOOD STAMPS. THAT'S A 

12:16:15.556 --> 12:16:20.446
POSITIVE THING. RETAIL SALES ARE
UP. WE ARE FINALLY BECOMING 

12:16:20.746 --> 12:16:24.126
ENERGY INDEPENDENT. THE U.S. IS 
NOW A NET NATURAL GAS EXPORTER 

12:16:24.426 --> 12:16:29.326
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 60 YEARS, 
60 YEARS. WE ARE NOW AN EXPORTER

12:16:29.646 --> 12:16:34.036
OF NATURAL GAS. RIGHT TO TRY. I 
REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT AND I'M 

12:16:34.346 --> 12:16:36.566
SURE MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES 
REMEMBER THIS, TOO, THE 

12:16:37.026 --> 12:16:41.646
PRESIDENT WAS ENCOURAGED TO PASS
THE RIGHT TO TRY LAW WHICH 

12:16:43.246 --> 12:16:48.146
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO OFTENTIMES HAVE
A -- THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF 

12:16:48.446 --> 12:16:51.326
CHANCE. THEY HAVE A DISEASE 
CONSIDERED FATAL, AND THEY WOULD

12:16:51.616 --> 12:16:55.506
LIKE TO TRY SOME DRUG THAT MAY 
BE COMES OUT SOME YEARS DOWN THE

12:16:55.796 --> 12:16:59.396
ROAD BUT ARE WILLING TO TRY IT 
NOW, AND BECAUSE OF THIS, IT'S 

12:16:59.906 --> 12:17:02.726
GIVING SOME PEOPLE HOPE AND 
HOPEFULLY SAVING LIVES. THAT'S 

12:17:03.026 --> 12:17:05.616
THE PRESIDENT'S IDEA. THE 
MILITARY IS STRONGER THAN IT'S 

12:17:05.916 --> 12:17:10.526
BEEN IN A LONG, LONG TIME, AND 
THANK GOD, WE ARE INCREASING PAY

12:17:10.836 --> 12:17:14.836
FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, 
AND THEY DESERVE EVEN MORE. 

12:17:15.126 --> 12:17:18.236
THERE ARE TWO GREAT JUDGES, I 
ARGUE, FROM MY DEMOCRATIC 

12:17:18.546 --> 12:17:22.036
COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD PROBABLY 
DISAGREE WITH ME HERE BUT TWO 

12:17:22.336 --> 12:17:26.356
GREAT JUDGES ON THE SUPREME 
COURT NOW. AND ELECTIONS HAVE 

12:17:26.746 --> 12:17:29.986
CONSEQUENCES. THEY WOULD HAVE 
BEEN VERY, VERY DIFFERENT HAD 

12:17:30.286 --> 12:17:33.536
HILLARY CLINTON BEEN ELECTED 
LAST TIME. ELECTIONS HAVE 

12:17:33.826 --> 12:17:36.906
CONSEQUENCES. AND THERE ARE MANY
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES THAT THEY 

12:17:37.206 --> 12:17:41.336
ARE FILLING IN THE SENATE, AND 
THANK GOD FOR THAT. THE 

12:17:41.636 --> 12:17:43.636
PRESIDENT 

12:17:45.146 --> 12:17:53.136
WITHDREW US FROM THAT AWFUL IRAN
DEAL WHICH ALLOWED 

12:17:56.836 --> 12:18:01.646
MONEY, BILLIONS TO GO TO 
TERRORISTS TOO BE USED AGAINST 

12:18:02.146 --> 12:18:04.836
US. AND WE HAVE SEEN -- FINALLY,
WE ARE 

12:18:08.536 --> 12:18:10.536
STRENGTHENING OUR SOUTHERN 

12:18:12.936 --> 12:18:17.826
BORDERS THOUGH WE HAVE A LONG 
WAY WAY TO GO. WHEN THE 

12:18:18.126 --> 12:18:21.446
DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER, THE FIRST 
THING THEY DID, THE ARTICLES OF 

12:18:21.846 --> 12:18:23.846
IMPEACHMENT WERE INTRODUCED, AND
THE VERY SAME 

12:18:27.056 --> 12:18:29.056
DAY, ONE 

12:18:32.466 --> 12:18:34.466
OF 

12:18:35.946 --> 12:18:38.236
THEIR MEMBERS IN A 
PROFANITY-FILLED SPEECH SAID WE 

12:18:38.536 --> 12:18:45.026
WILL IMPEACH THE [BLEEP] BUT DID
NOT SAY BLEEP. IS THAT A REASON 

12:18:45.316 --> 12:18:49.736
TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE
HE MIGHT GET REELECTED? IT WAS 

12:18:51.636 --> 12:18:56.026
TO THEM. IT GOES BACK TWO YEARS 
TO THE INAUGURATION. A LOT OF 

12:18:56.326 --> 12:19:01.436
PEOPLE CAME UP TO PROTEST, AND 
THAT'S FINE. WE SAW A LOT OF 

12:19:01.756 --> 12:19:04.436
WINDOWS BROKEN. WE HAD ONE 
PERSON SAYING SHE WAS DREAMING 

12:19:04.726 --> 12:19:08.306
ABOUT BLOWING UP THE WHITE HOUSE
AND THAT SORT OF THING. IT 

12:19:08.606 --> 12:19:11.876
REALLY DID GET UGLY. THE BOTTOM 
LINE IS THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING 

12:19:12.176 --> 12:19:15.746
FOR AN EXCUSE FOR YEARS NOW TO 
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. THEY ARE 

12:19:16.046 --> 12:19:21.836
WAFER THIN. WE SHOULD NOT BE 
MOVING FORWARD ON SOMETHING LIKE

12:19:22.126 --> 12:19:25.416
THIS. THE COUNTRY DESERVES A LOT
BETTER THAN THEY ARE GETTING IN 

12:19:25.716 --> 12:19:29.176
THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. I WILL 
BE GLAD WHEN WE GET BEYOND THIS.

12:19:29.476 --> 12:19:34.405
IT'S BAD FOR THE COUNTRY AND 
DIVISIVE. I YIELD BACK. 

12:19:34.406 --> 12:19:37.926
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD.

12:19:38.426 --> 12:19:42.946
&gt;&gt; MOVE IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I 

12:19:43.236 --> 12:19:46.216
HEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM RHODE 
ISLAND SAY THIS ISN'T ABOUT 

12:19:46.516 --> 12:19:49.966
POLICY DIFFERENCES BUT THE 
OBLIGATION TO PROTECT AND DEFEND

12:19:50.636 --> 12:19:53.436
OUR CONSTITUTION. IT'S ABOUT 
COURAGE. OF COURSE IT'S ABOUT 

12:19:53.736 --> 12:19:57.926
POLICY DIFFERENCES. YOU SAID 
NOTHING ON YOUR SIDE WHEN 

12:19:58.436 --> 12:20:02.436
PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT SURROGATES 
OUT TO LIE ABOUT BENGHAZI. YOU 

12:20:02.736 --> 12:20:06.046
SAID NOTHING WHEN PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION ENTERED 

12:20:06.436 --> 12:20:13.146
INTO A GUN-RUNNING DEAL WITH 
MEXICAN CARTELS AND THE FAST AND

12:20:14.336 --> 12:20:18.526
FURIOUS PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED. 
YOU SAID NOTHING ABOUT 

12:20:18.836 --> 12:20:22.446
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS. THIS IS 
ABOUT A POLICY DIFFERENCE. IT'S 

12:20:22.736 --> 12:20:25.726
NOT ABOUT COURAGE. I DON'T 
QUESTION ANYONE'S COURAGE ON THE

12:20:27.076 --> 12:20:31.036
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. I 
QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT. I DON'T 

12:20:31.536 --> 12:20:34.336
QUESTION YOUR COURAGE. I THINK 
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE 

12:20:34.626 --> 12:20:38.216
GETTING TIRED, AND I SAY THAT 
BECAUSE I HAVE A FRIEND FROM 

12:20:38.516 --> 12:20:42.576
COLLEGE, JIM. AND JIM SENT ME A 
TEXT. JUST SO YOU KNOW A LITTLE 

12:20:42.866 --> 12:20:46.126
BIT ABOUT JIM, HIS DAD WAS A 
PASTOR SOUTH OF THE MASON-DIXON 

12:20:46.426 --> 12:20:51.026
LINE IN THE 60s AND 70s AND A 
LEADER IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS 

12:20:51.326 --> 12:20:53.326
MOVEMENT. HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR 
DONALD TRUMP, 

12:20:56.846 --> 12:20:58.846
HE 

12:21:01.856 --> 12:21:06.436
DIDN'T VOTE FOR MITT 
MITT ROMNEY, AND HE DIDN'T VOTE 

12:21:07.056 --> 12:21:11.326
FOR JOHN McCAIN BUT HE SENDS ME 
A TEXT AND SAID I WILL BE VOTING

12:21:11.626 --> 12:21:14.526
FOR DONALD TRUMP THIS TIME 
AROUND BECAUSE HE BELIEVES YOUR 

12:21:14.836 --> 12:21:18.136
PARTY IS OVER REACHING THIS 
TIME, OVER REACHING. THE LAST 

12:21:18.426 --> 12:21:22.026
TEXT HE WENT ME WAS INTERESTING.
HE SAID THE STOCK MARKET IS 

12:21:22.566 --> 12:21:26.586
CLOSED AT A RECORD HIGH. THEY'RE
LOSING. BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT THE 

12:21:26.876 --> 12:21:32.346
OVER REACH COMMENT, AND I 
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT WAS MY -- THE

12:21:32.636 --> 12:21:36.366
MOST LUDICROUS OF THE WAYS THAT 
THE GROUP OF DEMOCRATS IN THE 

12:21:36.666 --> 12:21:41.526
HOUSE TRIED TO TAKE OUT THIS 
PRESIDENT? THERE ARE A LOT TO 

12:21:42.036 --> 12:21:45.746
CHOOSE FROM. MY FAVORITE HAPPENS
TO BE THE 25th AMENDMENT. I 

12:21:46.036 --> 12:21:49.616
THOUGHT WHEN YA'LL CAME UP WITH 
THE 25th AMENDMENT, IT WAS RIGHT

12:21:49.916 --> 12:21:56.646
AT THE TOP. YOU CALL IN A 
PROFESSOR FROM YALE AND THAT 

12:21:56.946 --> 12:22:03.426
PROFESSOR FROM YALE COULD HAVE 
BEEN RIGHT OUT OF A MOVIE ABOUT 

12:22:03.736 --> 12:22:09.426
THE OLD SOVIET UNION. SHE SAID, 
TESTIFYING IN CONGRESS, WELL, IT

12:22:09.726 --> 12:22:15.036
TAKES A MAJORITY OF THE CABINET 
TO INVOKE THE 25th AMENDMENT BUT

12:22:15.336 --> 12:22:20.836
THIS PRESIDENT MIGHT BE -- HE 
WOULD NEED AN EXAMINATION. WHEN 

12:22:21.126 --> 12:22:25.716
ASKED BY A MEMBER COULD HE BE 
DETAINED? COULD THE PRESIDENT OF

12:22:26.016 --> 12:22:32.616
THE UNITED STATES BE DETAINED 
FOR PURPOSES OF A EXAMINATION? 

12:22:32.926 --> 12:22:37.526
SHE SAID YES, RIGHT OUT OF THE 
OLD SOVIET UNION. THAT WAS MY 

12:22:40.626 --> 12:22:44.926
FAVORITE, AND THE SECOND 
FAVORITE WAS THE EMOLUMENTS 

12:22:45.226 --> 12:22:48.606
CLAUSE. I SAYS ANYONE THAT IS 
SUCCESSFUL AND HAS WORLD WIDE 

12:22:48.906 --> 12:22:55.946
BUSINESSES IS GOING TO BE 
SUBJECT TO AN EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE 

12:22:56.236 --> 12:22:59.226
ARGUMENT. THANKFULLY DID YOU NOT
INCLUDE THIS IN THE SET OF 

12:22:59.526 --> 12:23:04.136
ARTICLES. YOU HAVE HAD 4 ON THE 
HOUSE, AND YOU THINK THAT 

12:23:04.446 --> 12:23:08.646
SOMEHOW WE'RE NOT SHOWING 
COURAGE WHEN WE STAND HERE AND 

12:23:08.946 --> 12:23:16.136
TELL YOU DON'T HAVE THE FACTS TO
CONVICT THIS PRESIDENT ON THESE 

12:23:16.446 --> 12:23:19.406
CHARGES. AND YOU DON'T. THE 
THING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE IS 

12:23:19.706 --> 12:23:21.706
WHEN 

12:23:23.046 --> 12:23:28.286
THIS MOVES OVER TO THE SENATE, 
YOU LOSE THE NARRATIVE BECAUSE 

12:23:28.586 --> 12:23:31.536
THE REPUBLICANS WILL CALL HUNTER
BIDEN. THEY WILL CALL THE 

12:23:31.836 --> 12:23:34.826
WHISTLEBLOWER, AND YOU BETTER 
WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE AMERICAN 

12:23:35.136 --> 12:23:39.026
BELIEVE DOES WHEN ALL THE FACTS 
ARE OUT. YOU DON'T GET TO HIDE 

12:23:39.326 --> 12:23:41.346
THE FACTS IN THE BASEMENT ANY. 
ALL 

12:23:44.886 --> 12:23:51.046
THE FACTS WILL BE COMING OUT. I 
ASKED A FEW OF MY FRIENDS IF 

12:23:51.346 --> 12:23:56.026
THEY HAD ANY FAVORITES, AND I 
WILL YIELD TO MY FRIEND 

12:24:00.036 --> 12:24:04.335
TO ASK IF THEY HAD MORE 
OUTRAGEOUS SCENARIOS. 

12:24:04.336 --> 12:24:07.836
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU ANSWER YIELDING AND
THE 25th AMENDMENT WAS RIGHT AT 

12:24:08.136 --> 12:24:12.436
THE TOP OF THE HEAP THERE. BUT 
VIRTUALLY EVERY TIME THAT THE 

12:24:12.736 --> 12:24:19.146
PRESIDENT TWEETS SOMETHING, I 
HEAR CRITICISM HE SHOULD BE 

12:24:19.446 --> 12:24:22.146
IMPEACHED FOR TWEETING. IN FACT,
THE HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR THAT 

12:24:22.446 --> 12:24:28.036
WAS IN HERE LAST WEEK WROTE A 
PIECE HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED FOR

12:24:28.336 --> 12:24:30.866
TWEETING IN 2017. THAT WAS FUN. 
THE 

12:24:34.386 --> 12:24:38.796
OTHER WAS BROIBRY. THAT WAS FUN.
THE PROFESSOR TOOK HER 5 MINUTES

12:24:39.086 --> 12:24:44.326
TO TRY AND EXPLAIN WHAT BRIBERY 
WAS. WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING 

12:24:44.866 --> 12:24:48.876
MORE ABOUT WHAT BRIBERY WAS 
&gt;&gt; 

12:24:52.236 --> 12:24:55.835
YIELD THAT. GENTLEMAN YIELDED 
BACK. 

12:24:55.836 --> 12:24:57.836
&gt;&gt; CHAIRMAN? CHAIRMAN? 
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN SEEK 

12:24:59.146 --> 12:25:03.535
RECOGNITION? 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

12:25:03.536 --> 12:25:05.916
&gt;&gt; SO RECOGNIZED 
&gt;&gt; MY COLLEAGUE SUGGESTS THAT WE

12:25:06.206 --> 12:25:09.516
HAVE POLICY DISAGREEMENTS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT. WE DO HAVE POLICY

12:25:10.006 --> 12:25:15.126
DISAGREEMENTS WE HAVE A 
DISAGREEMENT THAT YOU PASSED 

12:25:15.426 --> 12:25:18.336
YOUR SIGNATURE LEGISLATIVE 
PACKAGE A GOP TAX SCAM WHERE 83%

12:25:19.046 --> 12:25:24.256
OF THE BENEFITS WENT TO THE 
WEALTHIEST ONE%. YOU EXPLODED 

12:25:24.556 --> 12:25:29.946
THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT. WE 
DISAGREE WITH THAT. WE DISAGREE 

12:25:30.236 --> 12:25:34.426
WITH THE POLICY OF SEPARATING 
GOD'S CHILDREN FROM THEIR 

12:25:37.836 --> 12:25:42.326
PARENTS AND CAGING THOSE 
CONCERN. THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE, 

12:25:43.136 --> 12:25:46.026
UNCONSCIONABLE AND UNAMERICAN. 
WE DISAGREE WITH THAT. WE 

12:25:46.326 --> 12:25:50.326
DISAGREE WITH YOUR EFFORT, 
ONGOING TO STRIP AWAY HEALTHCARE

12:25:50.626 --> 12:25:53.536
PROTECTION FROM MORE THAN 100 
MILLION AMERICANS WITH 

12:25:54.016 --> 12:25:57.726
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE 
DISAGREE WITH THAT AS WELL. BUT 

12:25:58.016 --> 12:26:03.116
WE ARE NOT HERE AT THIS MOMENT 
UNDERTAKING THIS SOLEMN 

12:26:03.426 --> 12:26:08.076
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE 
DISAGREE WITH HIS POLICY 

12:26:08.376 --> 12:26:11.836
POSITIONS. WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT 
NEXT ON NOVEMBER. WE'RE HERE 

12:26:12.146 --> 12:26:16.426
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT PRESSURED 
A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO TARGET 

12:26:19.326 --> 12:26:21.626
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN FOR 
POLITICAL GAIN THEREBY 

12:26:21.936 --> 12:26:26.646
SOLICITING FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 
IN THE 2020 ELECTION BY 

12:26:27.166 --> 12:26:29.876
WITHHOLDING $391 MILLION IN 
MILITARY AID WITHOUT 

12:26:30.186 --> 12:26:32.276
JUSTIFICATION. THE PRESIDENT 
SAID THAT WAS PERFECT. HERE'S 

12:26:32.676 --> 12:26:39.416
WHAT OTHERS HAVE HAD TO SAY 
ABOUT THAT. AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

12:26:39.706 --> 12:26:42.086
WHO GAVE THE PRESIDENT $1 
MILLION FOR THE INAUGURATION 

12:26:42.396 --> 12:26:49.646
SAID IT WAS A QUID PRO QUO. 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN, IRAQ

12:26:50.026 --> 12:26:52.136
WAR VETERAN 

12:26:56.146 --> 12:27:00.026
SAID IT WAS IMPROPER. DR. FIONA 

12:27:03.026 --> 12:27:06.426
HILL, TRUMP APPOINTEE, POLITICAL
ERRAND. AMBASSADOR HALER, WEST 

12:27:07.146 --> 12:27:12.286
POINT GRADUATE, APPOINTED BY 
REAGAN, BUSH, AND TRUMP, VIETNAM

12:27:12.586 --> 12:27:14.586
WAR HERO. HE 

12:27:17.536 --> 12:27:21.126
SAID IT WAS CRAZY. JOHN BOLTON, 
A SUPER CONSERVATIVE TRUMP 

12:27:21.416 --> 12:27:26.776
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR SAID 
IT WAS A DRUG DEAL. WHAT WAS THE

12:27:27.076 --> 12:27:34.746
FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION HAVE
SAID? IMPEACHABLE. I YIELD TO MY

12:27:35.046 --> 12:27:38.336
COLLEAGUE FROM CALIFORNIA. 
&gt;&gt; I THANK THE GENTLEMEN. IN MY 

12:27:38.646 --> 12:27:43.526
COLLEAGUE'S EFFORTS TO DEFEND 
THIS PRESIDENT, YOU WANT HIM TO 

12:27:43.816 --> 12:27:49.636
BE SOMEONE HE IS NOT. YOU WANT 
HIM TO BE SOMEONE HE IS TELLING 

12:27:50.636 --> 12:27:55.016
YOU  HE IS NOT. YOU ARE TRYING 
TO DEFEND THE CALL, AND HE IS 

12:27:55.316 --> 12:27:58.936
SAYING, GUYS, IT WAS A PERFECT 
CALL. HE'S NOT WHO YOU WANT HIM 

12:27:59.236 --> 12:28:04.136
TO BE. LET ME SELL YOU HOW 
SELFISH HIS ACTS WERE. YOU CAN 

12:28:04.446 --> 12:28:09.836
DENY THIS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. 
PEOPLE DIED IN UKRAINE AT THE 

12:28:10.136 --> 12:28:13.566
HANDS OF RUSSIA. AND UKRAINE 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2018 WHEN IT WAS

12:28:13.866 --> 12:28:17.946
VOTED ON BY CONGRESS WAS 
COUNTING ON OUR SUPPORT. ONE 

12:28:18.246 --> 12:28:22.126
YEAR PAST AND PEOPLE DIED. YOU 
MAY NOT WANT TO THINK ABOUT 

12:28:22.426 --> 12:28:27.046
THAT. IT MAY BE HARD TO THINK 
ABOUT THAT. BUT THEY DIED WHEN 

12:28:27.446 --> 12:28:31.226
THIS SELFISH, SELFISH PRESIDENT 
WITHHELD THE AID FOR HIS OWN 

12:28:31.746 --> 12:28:37.236
PERSONAL GAIN. I GET IT. OH, 
OBAMA, YOU KNOW, HE ONLY GAVE 

12:28:37.536 --> 12:28:42.226
THEM XYZ. WE PROVE THAT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE THEM NOT 

12:28:42.526 --> 12:28:46.016
ONLY MILITARY IS CAPABILITY, 
MILITARY TRAINING, AND MEDICAL 

12:28:46.316 --> 12:28:50.946
EQUIPMENT. SO DON'T TELL 
YOURSELF UKRANIANS DIDN'T DIE. 

12:28:51.246 --> 12:28:56.846
THEY DIED. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR HE 
SAID THESE ARE WEAPONS AND 

12:28:57.146 --> 12:29:03.136
ASSISTANCE TO ALLOW THEM TO 
DETER FURTHER INCURSION BY 

12:29:03.626 --> 12:29:06.856
RUSSIANS. IF THAT FURTHER 
INCURSION AND AGGRESSION WERE TO

12:29:07.156 --> 12:29:14.446
HAVE TAKEN PLACE, MORE WOULD 
HAVE DIED. BUT YOU DIDN'T ONLY 

12:29:14.746 --> 12:29:17.836
HURT UKRAINE, MR. PRESIDENT BY 
DOING THIS, YOU HELPED RUSSIA, 

12:29:18.436 --> 12:29:22.336
AND TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO BELIEVE
WE HAVE AN ANTI-CORRUPTION 

12:29:22.626 --> 12:29:29.836
PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I 
ASK YOU THIS. HOW MANY TIMES DID

12:29:30.346 --> 12:29:34.976
THIS ANTI-CORRUPTION PRESIDENT 
MEET WITH THE MOST CORRUPT 

12:29:35.746 --> 12:29:39.336
LEADER IN THE WORLD, VLADIMIR 
PUTIN? HOW MANY TIMES DID HE 

12:29:39.836 --> 12:29:43.746
TALK TO HIM? 16 TIMES BETWEEN 
MEETING AND PHONE CONVERSATIONS 

12:29:44.346 --> 12:29:48.826
AND HOW MANY CONDITIONS DID THE 
PRESIDENT PUT ON VLADIMIR PUTIN 

12:29:49.226 --> 12:29:52.526
TO GET AN AUDIENCE WITH THE MOST
POWERFUL BETTER THAN IN THE 

12:29:52.856 --> 12:29:56.236
WORLD WITH THE HIGHEST OFFICE? 
ZERO CONDITIONS. THAT'S WHO YOU 

12:29:56.826 --> 12:30:00.846
ARE DEFENDING. KEEP DEFENDING 
HIM. WE WILL DEFEND THE 

12:30:01.136 --> 12:30:03.136
INSTITUTION 

12:30:05.046 --> 12:30:07.046
AND 

12:30:09.256 --> 12:30:12.116
NATIONAL SECURITY. I YIELD BACK.
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 

12:30:12.426 --> 12:30:15.385
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN I MOVE TO STRIKE
THE LAST WORD 

12:30:15.386 --> 12:30:18.086
&gt;&gt; SO RECOGNIZED 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE 

12:30:18.536 --> 12:30:21.936
MR. JEFFERIES FOR LAYING BARE 
WHAT WE ALL HAVE KNOWN. THEY 

12:30:22.226 --> 12:30:26.036
HAVE POLICY DIFFERENCES, AND AS 
HE SAID, THEY WILL DEAL WITH IT 

12:30:26.446 --> 12:30:29.116
NEXT NOVEMBER. THEY ARE NOT 
REALLY INTERESTED IN REMOVING 

12:30:29.426 --> 12:30:32.436
THIS PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE. THEY
DON'T THINK THE SENATE WILL 

12:30:32.826 --> 12:30:36.936
REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE. THEY GET
IT. THIS IS A POLITICAL EXERCISE

12:30:37.246 --> 12:30:40.836
TO HELP THEM IN NEXT NOVEMBER'S 
ELECTION. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL 

12:30:41.156 --> 12:30:44.236
ABOUT FOR THEM, AND IT'S 
INFURIATING TO ME THAT THEY PUT 

12:30:44.826 --> 12:30:47.816
ON THIS SHOW AND WAVE WEATHER 
CONSTITUTION WHICH THEY MUST 

12:30:48.116 --> 12:30:51.576
HAVE JUST FOUND BECAUSE, YOU 
KNOW, I'VE BEEN AT THIS A LONG 

12:30:51.876 --> 12:30:57.726
TIME, AND I DON'T SEE FOLKS ON 
THEIR SIDE OF THE AISLE WAVING 

12:30:58.026 --> 12:31:01.526
THE CONSTITUTION MUCH  LESS 
READING FROM IT VERY OFTEN. BUT 

12:31:01.836 --> 12:31:04.916
IT'S GOOD TO SEE WHAT THEIR REAL
MOTIVES ARE, TO USE 

12:31:08.336 --> 12:31:12.226
THIS FOR A POLITE  POLITICAL 
MANEUVER FOR THE ELECTION. I 

12:31:12.526 --> 12:31:15.816
YIELD TO THE MEMBER. 
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT SURE IF THE HEARING 

12:31:16.116 --> 12:31:21.536
IS BAD ON THAT END. UNDOUBTEDLY 
IT IS. I DID NOT SAY NO ONE 

12:31:22.026 --> 12:31:25.526
DIED. UNDOUBTEDLY YOU CAN HAVE 
TROUBLE READING AN ARTICLE 

12:31:25.826 --> 12:31:30.946
SAYING THAT NO ONE DIED. NO ONE 
SAID THAT YOU ARE JUST SITTING 

12:31:31.246 --> 12:31:34.236
THERE TELLING UNTRUTH BECAUSE 
YOU DON'T GET IT BECAUSE YOU 

12:31:35.226 --> 12:31:38.926
HAVE A PERSONAL AGENDA AND MAYBE
ARE AUDITIONING TO BE AN 

12:31:39.626 --> 12:31:42.226
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER. THAT'S 
GREAT. BUT YOU CAN'T GET INTO 

12:31:42.726 --> 12:31:46.056
THIS ONE. AS SOMEONE WHO WATCHED
PEOPLE DIE ON THE BATTLE FIELD, 

12:31:46.356 --> 12:31:49.946
I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE DIE. I KNOW 
WHEN THEY COME INTO THE HOSPITAL

12:31:50.236 --> 12:31:54.646
AND THEY WERE SHOT UP AND WHIT 
AN IED. TO COME IN AND TAKE A 

12:31:54.936 --> 12:31:57.356
SHOT AND SAY, MR. COLLINS 
DOESN'T THINK PEOPLE DIED, 

12:31:57.646 --> 12:32:01.256
THAT'S A LOAD OF HOGWASH. AND 
IT'S SO WRONG TO GET A CHEAP 

12:32:02.026 --> 12:32:06.856
SHOT WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN READ 
YOUR OWN ARTICLE THAT YOU PUT IN

12:32:07.146 --> 12:32:10.926
SUBMISSION. MAYBE WE CAN GO BY 
IT WORD BY WORD ALTHOUGH THERE 

12:32:12.536 --> 12:32:18.236
IS NO WAY TO LINK THE DEATHS 
DIRECTLY TO LACK OF AID. UNDER 

12:32:18.536 --> 12:32:21.506
SECRETARY HALE SAID THIS WAS 
PROSPECTIVE, NOT AT THE TIME. I 

12:32:21.796 --> 12:32:25.606
AM NOT SURE WHAT PARTY -- I 
COULD MAYBE DRAW A PICTURE AND 

12:32:25.896 --> 12:32:29.016
PUT IT ON A CHART FOR YOU. 
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS 

12:32:29.316 --> 12:32:35.446
COMMENT, AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT 
OF THEM HERE. THAT IS THE MOST 

12:32:36.136 --> 12:32:40.126
AMAZING, AMAZING LACK OF HONESTY
AND INTEGRITY I'VE SEEN SO FAR. 

12:32:40.426 --> 12:32:46.176
LOOKING AT YOUR OWN ARTICLE. TO 
SAY THAT I NEVER SAID NO ONE 

12:32:46.476 --> 12:32:49.786
DIED. WE KNOW PEOPLE DIED. LET 
ME EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. WAR, 

12:32:50.086 --> 12:32:53.076
PEOPLE DIE. IS THAT DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND? MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU

12:32:53.366 --> 12:33:00.036
ARE BACK HERE WITH US TONIGHT? 
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND. AND

12:33:00.336 --> 12:33:04.826
TO SAY THAT TO -- AGAIN, TWO 
THINGS, THE MOST AMAZING THING 

12:33:07.226 --> 12:33:10.126
TODAY, TEARING DOWN THE UKRANIAN
-- MR. ZELENSKY AND BESMIRCHING 

12:33:10.416 --> 12:33:16.056
THE FOLKS WHO DIED, THAT'S 
AMAZING TO ME, AND EVEN FOR THIS

12:33:16.356 --> 12:33:20.926
MAJORITY. TO SIT THERE AND KEEP 
REPEATING THE LIE AFTER LIE 

12:33:21.226 --> 12:33:25.636
AFTER LIE. THEY DIED. MR. HALE 
UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE SAID IT

12:33:26.026 --> 12:33:29.036
WAS PROSPECTIVE MONEY, NOT 
CURRENT MONEY. PEOPLE DIED WHEN 

12:33:29.336 --> 12:33:32.676
THE MONEY WAS RELEASED EARLIER. 
ARE WE GOING TO CLAIM THAT WAS 

12:33:32.976 --> 12:33:37.426
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM 
ENOUGH MONEY? I DON'T KNOW. I 

12:33:37.766 --> 12:33:41.656
GET. IT YA'LL GOT AN AGENDA TO 
PUSH. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. BUT 

12:33:41.956 --> 12:33:46.766
TO SIT AND COME BACK WITH THAT 
ONE AND ACCUSE ME THAT I SAID 

12:33:47.146 --> 12:33:51.326
NOBODY DIED? I NEVER SAID NOBODY
DIED. UNDOUBTEDLY, YOU DON'T 

12:33:51.616 --> 12:33:55.726
UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE YOUR OWN
ARTICLE THAT YOU WANTED TO GET 

12:33:56.026 --> 12:34:03.836
IN SO QUICKLY SAID THERE IS NO 
WAY TO ACTUALLY TELL -- THIS WAS

12:34:04.146 --> 12:34:08.736
AN ARTICLE THAT WAS SLANTED 
AGAINST THE POSITION THAT THE 

12:34:09.236 --> 12:34:14.446
PRESIDENT HAD. SO IF YOU WANT TO
CHANGE THIS DEBATE, GO RIGHT 

12:34:14.746 --> 12:34:18.546
AHEAD. FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
SERVED IN THE MILITARY AND 

12:34:18.836 --> 12:34:22.426
WATCHED AND BEEN OVERSEAS AND 
WATCHED THIS AROUND THE WORLD, 

12:34:22.716 --> 12:34:29.136
FIGHTING IN UKRAINE AND OTHERS 
RIGHT NOW, FOR YOU TO SAY THAT, 

12:34:29.446 --> 12:34:33.526
THAT'S JUST WRONG. AND I'M NOT 
YIELDING TO ANYONE. MAKE LIKE I 

12:34:33.876 --> 12:34:37.076
SAID, MAYBE IT'S A READING 
COMPREHENSION PROBLEM. MAYBE WE 

12:34:37.826 --> 12:34:41.336
JUST DON'T HAVE IT. MAYBE IT'S 
JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE 

12:34:41.636 --> 12:34:45.436
FACTS TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT. I'LL
GO BACK TO THE FACTS THAT YOU 

12:34:45.736 --> 12:34:48.126
COULDN'T HAVE MADE THE CASE. 
OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD HAVE 

12:34:48.436 --> 12:34:51.786
ROASTED HIM IN THE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. YOU CAN'T DO IT. SO

12:34:52.086 --> 12:34:57.756
WHAT DO WE DO? TODAY WE TAKE THE
TACT OF TEARING DOWN MR. 

12:34:58.236 --> 12:35:02.836
ZELENSKY, JUST TEARING HIM DOWN 
AND CONTINUING THE UNFORTUNATE 

12:35:03.326 --> 12:35:06.226
MISREPRESENTATIVE OF MONEY AND 
DEATH OF SOLDIERS FIGHTING FOR 

12:35:06.526 --> 12:35:13.746
THEIR COUNTRY. THAT IS THE DARK 
THING THAT WE SEE TODAY. I YIELD

12:35:14.046 --> 12:35:16.025
BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN? 

12:35:16.026 --> 12:35:23.836
&gt;&gt; THE TIME HAS NOW EXPIRED. AND
NOW WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU SEEK? 

12:35:24.336 --> 12:35:26.525
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD, MR. 
CHAIRMAN 

12:35:26.526 --> 12:35:30.345
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE LADY IS 
RECOGNIZED. 

12:35:30.346 --> 12:35:35.456
&gt;&gt; I WILL TAKE A DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVE FROM MY GOOD FRIEND 

12:35:35.746 --> 12:35:39.436
DOUG COLLINS. THE CONSTITUTION 
IS A GUIDE WHICH I WILL NEVER 

12:35:39.736 --> 12:35:44.026
ABANDON. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO
WATCH THIS DEBATE, WHO, MEN AND 

12:35:44.326 --> 12:35:47.196
WOMEN WEARING UNIFORM AROUND THE
NATION, I HOPE THAT YOU'LL 

12:35:48.446 --> 12:35:52.826
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL NEVER 
ABANDON THE CONSTITUTION. THAT 

12:35:53.126 --> 12:35:56.516
IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY, TO 
DISCUSS THE ARTICLE WAS 

12:35:56.816 --> 12:35:59.836
IMPEACHMENT. WHEN I BEGAN MY 
WORDS YESTERDAY, I SAID WE THE 

12:36:00.156 --> 12:36:05.826
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AS 
EVIDENCED BY JAMES MADISON TO 

12:36:06.626 --> 12:36:09.236
PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE AND 
ESTABLISH THE CONSTITUTION OF 

12:36:09.526 --> 12:36:12.936
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
LET ME SPEAK BRIEFLY TO SAY THAT

12:36:13.236 --> 12:36:16.426
THE LANGUAGE THAT THE GENTLEMAN 
IS TRYING TO STRIKE IS ALREADY 

12:36:16.726 --> 12:36:21.116
ESTABLISHED, AND IT WAS IN THE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT IN 1998.

12:36:21.416 --> 12:36:24.826
LET ME ALSO SAY THAT MY GOOD 
FRIENDS ARE SPEAKING TO AN 

12:36:25.116 --> 12:36:29.336
AUDIENCE OF 1, THE PERSON WHO 
NOW IS ABSORBING THE ACCOLADES 

12:36:29.636 --> 12:36:34.646
AND ALL THE GREAT WORK HE HAS 
DONE. AND I 

12:36:38.026 --> 12:36:40.536
HAVE NO QUARREL OF THE 
REPRESENTATION OF THEIR 

12:36:40.826 --> 12:36:44.956
PRESIDENT. I DON'T WANT SERVE A 
MAN OR A PRESIDENT. BENJAMIN 

12:36:45.346 --> 12:36:49.116
FRANKLIN ANSWERED THE QUESTION 
WHEN THEY SHOUTED OUT, MR. 

12:36:49.406 --> 12:36:53.206
FRANKLIN, WHAT DO WE HAVE A 
MONARCHY OR A REPUBLIC? HE SAID 

12:36:53.506 --> 12:36:57.246
A REPUBLIC IF WE CAN KEEP IT. 
TODAY, THE MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS

12:36:57.726 --> 12:37:00.596
ARE ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THIS 
REPUBLIC AND MAINTAIN THAT THE 

12:37:00.896 --> 12:37:06.036
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
CANNOT ABUSE HIS POWER AND 

12:37:06.336 --> 12:37:09.436
CANNOT USURP CONGRESS. THE 
CHAIRMAN MADE IT VERY CLEAR. HE 

12:37:09.736 --> 12:37:13.016
MADE IT VERY CLEAR BY STATING 
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

12:37:13.306 --> 12:37:17.476
STATES AT THAT TIME IN THE NIXON
PROCEEDINGS COULD NOT DESIGN FOR

12:37:17.936 --> 12:37:20.026
HIMSELF HOW THE IMPEACHMENT 

12:37:23.536 --> 12:37:31.446
INQUIRY WOULD WORK. AND THEN, TO
TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S USE 

12:37:31.746 --> 12:37:41.238
OF HIS PUBLIC OFFICE TO USE 
FOREIGN FUNDS TO GET A FOREIGN 

12:37:41.728 --> 12:37:43.728
ENTITY 

12:37:46.048 --> 12:37:48.048
TO 

12:37:49.848 --> 12:37:55.838
HELP WITH HIS CAMPAIGN. I 
DISAGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT FOR 

12:37:57.578 --> 12:38:01.058
CUTTING SNAP FOR POOR PEOPLE OR 
SEPARATING CHILDREN. A NEWLY 

12:38:01.358 --> 12:38:03.358
ELECTED PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT
WHO HAD 

12:38:06.948 --> 12:38:14.838
RUN ON THE GET CORRUPTION OUT 
CAMPAIGN LITERALLY, HE 

12:38:15.138 --> 12:38:17.548
CAMPAIGNED. HIS PARTY WAS AN 
ANTICORRUPTION PARTY AND COMES 

12:38:17.848 --> 12:38:21.748
HAT IN HAND BECAUSE HE MISSED 
THE INAUGURATION. HE DID NOT GO.

12:38:22.038 --> 12:38:29.738
HE SENT SONDLAND, AND HE SENT 
PERRY. MR. PENCE DID NOT GO. HE 

12:38:30.028 --> 12:38:33.598
WANTED TO SAY ANYTHING THAT HE 
COULD TO MAKE SURE HE WOULD GET 

12:38:33.888 --> 12:38:37.058
THESE DOLLARS AND CALLING FOR AN
INVESTIGATION ON AN OPPONENT, IT

12:38:37.638 --> 12:38:41.208
WAS NOT BENEATH HIM. HOW DO YOU 
THINK THAT HE WOULD ADMIT NOW 

12:38:42.068 --> 12:38:47.238
PUBLICALLY THAT HE IS WILLING TO
DO IT? LET ME SHOW YOU THE 

12:38:51.128 --> 12:38:53.438
ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH UKRAINE 
LIVED. PUTIN RELATIONS RECLAIMS 

12:38:54.048 --> 12:38:58.338
CRIMEA RIGHT ON THE BORDER, 
ARROGANTLY WITHOUT, IN ANY 

12:38:59.538 --> 12:39:03.438
DEFENSE BY UKRAINE. THEY LOST. 
CRIMEA WAS TAKEN. JUST LIKE WE 

12:39:03.828 --> 12:39:07.838
WOULD HAVE LOST MISSISSIPPI OR 
TEXAS OR NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA.

12:39:08.128 --> 12:39:13.748
AND THEN THEY LIVED IN THE 
ATMOSPHERE OF A JETLINER 

12:39:14.058 --> 12:39:19.238
EXPLODES OVER UKRAINE, SHOT DOWN
BY RUSSIAN WEAPONS, BY 

12:39:19.648 --> 12:39:24.738
SEPARATISTS SUPPORTED BY 
UKRAINE. OR BY RUSSIA. AND THEN 

12:39:25.138 --> 12:39:29.838
UKRAINE, IN UKRAINE, THE U.S. 
TRAINED AN ARMY IN THE WEST TO 

12:39:30.868 --> 12:39:35.538
FIGHT THE EAST, IMPACTING OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY. SO LET ME SAY

12:39:35.858 --> 12:39:41.228
TO MY COLLEAGUES, I READ THE 
INSTITUTION REGULARLY. MY 

12:39:41.518 --> 12:39:45.538
PREDECESSOR ALWAYS SAID, KEEP A 
CONSTITUTION IN YOUR HAND. 

12:39:45.828 --> 12:39:49.418
BARBARA JORDAN SAID WE THE 
PEOPLE BUT I'M CLEAR THAT THE 

12:39:49.718 --> 12:39:52.108
IMBALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN 
UKRAINE AND THE UNITED STATES 

12:39:52.408 --> 12:39:57.438
AND 2 HEADS OF STATE WOULD HAVE 
CAUSED THAT PRESIDENT TO DO 

12:39:57.738 --> 12:40:00.438
ALMOST ANYTHING. AND AS 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID, HE 

12:40:00.828 --> 12:40:05.628
WILL DO ANYTHING YOU DESIRE HIM 
TO DO, AND HE WILL CALL FOR 

12:40:05.928 --> 12:40:11.748
INVESTIGATION. AND SO HE WAS 
WILLING TO GO ON CNN AND 

12:40:12.058 --> 12:40:14.928
ANNOUNCE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ABUSED HIS 

12:40:15.348 --> 12:40:20.318
POWER. THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED 
TO OBSTRUCT CONGRESS IN TRYING 

12:40:20.618 --> 12:40:24.858
TO CREATE HIS OWN WAY OF US 
DOING OUR IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. I

12:40:25.158 --> 12:40:27.528
BELIEVE WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT 
THING. I SUPPORT 

12:40:31.028 --> 12:40:33.507
THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. I 
YIELD BACK. 

12:40:33.508 --> 12:40:35.528
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE 

12:40:38.648 --> 12:40:42.028
LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; THE  GENTLEMEN IS RECOGNIZED 

12:40:42.328 --> 12:40:46.248
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, DARE I STATE 
THE OBVIOUS? I HAVE NOT HEARD A 

12:40:47.348 --> 12:40:51.528
NEW POINT OR AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT
FROM EITHER SIDE IN THE LAST 3 

12:40:51.938 --> 12:40:53.938
HOURS. THE SAME TALKING POINTS 

12:40:57.438 --> 12:41:04.938
REPORTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AD 
NASEUM BY BOTH SIDES. DENYING A 

12:41:05.248 --> 12:41:09.128
FACT DOESN'T MAKE IT FALSE AND 
REPEATING IT OVER AND OVER 

12:41:11.028 --> 12:41:15.648
DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE. WE ALL 
KNOW THAT WITHOUT PUTTING IT ON 

12:41:16.048 --> 12:41:18.048
AND 

12:41:19.238 --> 12:41:22.218
ENDLESS LOOP. I WILL OFFER A 
MODERATE SUGGESTION IF NO ONE 

12:41:23.038 --> 12:41:26.528
HAS ANYTHING NEW TO ADD THEY 
RESIST THE TEMPTATION, AND WITH 

12:41:26.938 --> 12:41:29.968
THAT, I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE 

12:41:34.578 --> 12:41:41.028
POINT IS WELL TAKEN. WHO ELSE 
SEEKS RECOGNITION? FOR WHAT 

12:41:41.338 --> 12:41:43.527
PURPOSE? 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD. 

12:41:43.528 --> 12:41:48.938
&gt;&gt; GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; I THANK THE GENTLELADY FOR 

12:41:49.338 --> 12:41:52.008
YIELDING. I HEARD THE LAST 
SPEAKER FROM TEXAS TALKING ABOUT

12:41:52.308 --> 12:41:54.308
THE CAMPAIGN, AND HOW ABOUT 

12:41:57.138 --> 12:42:01.378
THE FBI SPYING ON FOUR AMERICAN 
CITIZENS WITH THE CAMPAIGN IN 

12:42:01.688 --> 12:42:05.428
2016? THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE 
INVESTIGATION WERE THE ONES WHO 

12:42:05.718 --> 12:42:10.298
SAID WE'LL STOP TRUMP AND TRUMP 
SHOULD LOSE 100 MILLION TO 0. 

12:42:10.598 --> 12:42:15.258
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SAID WE 
HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY AND RAN

12:42:15.558 --> 12:42:19.948
THE INVESTIGATION WHERE THEY 
WENT TO THE COURT AND LIED TO 

12:42:20.278 --> 12:42:23.878
THE COURT. WE JUST LEARNED THIS,
LIED TO THE COURT 17 TIMES AND 

12:42:24.168 --> 12:42:27.928
DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT THE 
GUY WHO WROTE THE DOSSIER WAS, 

12:42:28.218 --> 12:42:33.968
QUOTE, DESPERATE TO STOP TRUMP 
AND THE DOSSIER TO FURTHER SPY, 

12:42:34.268 --> 12:42:37.668
DOESN'T TELL THE SOUTHER THAT 
THE GUY WHO WROTE THE DOSSIER 

12:42:37.968 --> 12:42:41.538
WAS WORKING FOR THE CLINT ONLY 
CAMPAIGN. DIDN'T DO THAT. DIDN'T

12:42:41.838 --> 12:42:46.338
TELL THE COURT THAT THE GUY THAT
WROTE THE DOSSIER, CHRISTOPHER 

12:42:46.638 --> 12:42:51.548
STEEL, WAS FIRED BECAUSE HE WAS 
TALKING TO THE  PRESS. WE ARE 

12:42:51.848 --> 12:42:57.638
TALKING ABOUT THAT FACT, AND NOW
IN 2020, NOW IN 2020 WE DON'T 

12:42:57.928 --> 12:43:01.238
HAVE THE FBI SPYING ON PEOPLE 
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN YET. 

12:43:01.528 --> 12:43:06.018
WE'VE DON'T HAVE THEM GOING TO 
DEFY THE COURT AND LYING. WHAT 

12:43:06.318 --> 12:43:08.698
WE HAVE INSTEAD, AN INSURANCE 
POLICY INSTEAD NOW IS 

12:43:08.998 --> 12:43:11.858
IMPEACHMENT. THAT'S WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING. THAT'S HOW THEY WILL 

12:43:12.168 --> 12:43:15.218
MAKE IT TOUGHER ON THE PRESIDENT
TO WIN RE-ELECTION. THAT'S WHAT 

12:43:15.528 --> 12:43:19.038
THIS IS ABOUT, AND THAT'S WHY 
IT'S SO WRONG. LET THE AMERICAN 

12:43:19.738 --> 12:43:23.548
PEOPLE DECIDE. WE ARE 11 MONTHS 
AWAY, LESS THAN 11 MONTHS AWAY 

12:43:23.848 --> 12:43:27.058
FROM THE NEXT ELECTION. LET THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE. WE 

12:43:27.358 --> 12:43:32.528
ALREADY HAD THE FBI TRY AND 
WEIGH IN 2016 AND DO ALL THE 

12:43:32.818 --> 12:43:36.408
THINGS THAT MR. HOROWITZ TOLD US
ABOUT THIS WEEK AND NOW IN 2020,

12:43:36.708 --> 12:43:40.138
THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE 
TRYING TO CREATE AN INSURANCE 

12:43:40.638 --> 12:43:43.428
POLICY WITH THE IMPEACHMENT 
EFFORT. LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

12:43:43.718 --> 12:43:47.827
DECIDE. I YIELD BACK TO THE 
GENTLE LADY FROM ALABAMA. 

12:43:47.828 --> 12:43:53.248
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. I WILL 
YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME 

12:43:58.248 --> 12:44:00.248
TO MR. WRECKEN  WRECK 

12:44:02.338 --> 12:44:04.938
RECKENTHALER 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO DRAW

12:44:05.248 --> 12:44:07.248
ATTENTION TO SOME OF 

12:44:09.248 --> 12:44:15.218
WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC WITNESSES 
JUST  SAID. I HAVE TO FIND IT. I

12:44:17.438 --> 12:44:22.538
HEARD IT BE SAID WHEN THE FACTS 
NOT ON YOUR SIDE OR THE LAW IS 

12:44:22.838 --> 12:44:26.928
NOT ON YOUR SIDE, ARGUE FOR A 
LONG TIME. THE FACTS AND THE LAW

12:44:27.228 --> 12:44:33.438
ARE ON OUR SIDE. IT'S VERY CLEAR
THAT THE DEMOCRATS CANNOT MAKE 

12:44:34.828 --> 12:44:37.928
OUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE. THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME 

12:44:38.238 --> 12:44:44.248
ORIGINALISTS ALL OF A SUDDEN. 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE STATUE. THE

12:44:44.538 --> 12:44:47.918
FEDERAL BRIBERY STATUTE CONTAINS
WHOEVER BEING A PUBLIC OFFICIAL,

12:44:48.338 --> 12:44:51.338
COMMANDS AND RECEIVES PERSONALLY
ANYTHING OF VALUE IN RETURN FOR 

12:44:51.648 --> 12:44:54.428
BEING INFLUENCED IN THE 
PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICIAL ACT. 

12:44:54.728 --> 12:45:00.278
SO WE CAN TAKE ANY ONE OF THOSE 
ELEMENTS AND DECONSTRUCT IT. 

12:45:00.578 --> 12:45:03.578
LET'S START WITH OFFICIAL ACTS. 
WE HAVEN'T HIT THAT. A MEETING 

12:45:03.878 --> 12:45:08.378
OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT, A 
QUOTE, UNQUOTE, OFFICIAL ACT 

12:45:09.228 --> 12:45:12.278
UNDER THE SUPREME COURT'S 
McDONALD PRECEDENT. SETTING UP A

12:45:12.578 --> 12:45:16.948
MEETING, TALKING TO ANOTHER 
OFFICIAL OR ORGANIZING AN EVENT 

12:45:17.438 --> 12:45:21.228
DOES NOT FIT THE DEFINITION OF 
AN OFFICIAL ACT. SO RIGHT THERE 

12:45:21.538 --> 12:45:25.238
UNDER THE SUPREME COURT 
PRECEDENT, YOU DON'T HAVE AN 

12:45:25.538 --> 12:45:31.928
OFFICIAL ACT. YOU CAN ALSO LOOK 
AT THE ELEMENT, ANYTHING OF 

12:45:32.938 --> 12:45:36.838
VALUE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
CRIMINAL DIVISION, PUBLIC 

12:45:37.128 --> 12:45:39.838
INTEGRITY SECTION, OPINED IN 
ACCEPT THAT SOMETHING AS NEBULAS

12:45:40.548 --> 12:45:45.948
AS AN INVESTIGATION IS NOT OF 

12:45:49.958 --> 12:45:52.588
SUFFICIENT CONCRETE VALUE TO  
CONSTITUTE SOMETHING OF VALUE 

12:45:52.888 --> 12:45:56.148
UNDER THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS.
IF WE ARE ARGUING THE LAW, I 

12:45:56.438 --> 12:46:00.748
WILL ARGUE IT ALL NIGHT. THE LAW
IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE. YOU CANNOT 

12:46:01.048 --> 12:46:04.938
MAKE THE PRIMA FACIE CASE. I WAS
A DISTRICT JUDGE IN 

12:46:05.228 --> 12:46:07.918
PENNSYLVANIA. I WOULD HAVE 
DISMISSED THIS EVERY TIME IF IT 

12:46:08.218 --> 12:46:11.438
CAME BEFORE ME BECAUSE THERE ARE
NOT THE ELEMENTS NEEDED TO 

12:46:11.738 --> 12:46:15.948
SUPPORT THE PRIMA FACIE CASE. I 
ONLY HAVE 30 SECONDS LEFT. IF 

12:46:16.238 --> 12:46:19.318
SOMEONE WOULD YIELD ME MORE 
TIME, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. BUT

12:46:19.618 --> 12:46:23.838
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT HAVE 
CORRUPT INTENT. AGAIN, THE 

12:46:24.938 --> 12:46:27.458
DEMOCRATS ARE USING A PARODY 
VERSION OF CHAIRMAN SCHIFF 

12:46:31.438 --> 12:46:35.728
TALKING ABOUT THE WHEN  -- HE 
SAID -- THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T 

12:46:36.448 --> 12:46:38.448
SAY THAT AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
IT'S 

12:46:41.848 --> 12:46:43.848
USED 

12:46:46.848 --> 12:46:48.848
TO SUPPORT THE 

12:46:51.878 --> 12:46:53.878
ELEMENT.

12:46:55.838 --> 12:46:58.138
IF ANYONE HAS MORE TIME, I 

12:47:02.838 --> 12:47:04.838
WOULD APPRECIATE IT BEING 

12:47:08.078 --> 12:47:10.078
YIELDED TO ME. 
&gt;&gt; 

12:47:12.748 --> 12:47:15.147
IT'S NOT ALREADY DONE. YOU ARE 
INCORRECT, SIR. 

12:47:15.148 --> 12:47:17.547
&gt;&gt; I AM TOLD YOU HAVE ALREADY 
SPOKEN. 

12:47:17.548 --> 12:47:21.567
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE IN ERROR, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY? 

12:47:21.568 --> 12:47:25.228
&gt;&gt; NOT ON JORDAN? 
&gt;&gt; NO. YOU HAVE SPOKEN ON THE 

12:47:27.238 --> 12:47:30.027
AMENDMENT ALREADY. 
&gt;&gt; NO, NOT ON JORDAN. 

12:47:30.028 --> 12:47:32.728
&gt;&gt; ON THIS AMENDMENT. 
&gt;&gt; I 

12:47:36.348 --> 12:47:38.938
DON'T THINK SO. 
&gt;&gt; ANYONE 

12:47:41.938 --> 12:47:45.557
ELSE SEEK RECOGNITION? NO ONE 
ELSE SEEKS RECOGNITION? 

12:47:45.558 --> 12:47:51.938
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN? 
&gt;&gt; MR. BUCK YIELDED IT TO ME. 

12:47:52.238 --> 12:47:55.127
&gt;&gt; MR. RATCLIFFE SEEKS -- MR. 
RATCLIFFE SEEK RECOGNITION? 

12:47:55.128 --> 12:47:59.747
&gt;&gt; MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD.
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 

12:47:59.748 --> 12:48:04.108
&gt;&gt; MY FRIEND FROM ARIZONA. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. I GUESS IT

12:48:04.418 --> 12:48:09.638
MEANS WE ARE NOT DOING THE 
MINORITY HEARING TODAY. I WOULD 

12:48:09.938 --> 12:48:13.618
SAY THAT JAMES MADISON -- WE 
HEARD PEOPLE INTONE JAMES 

12:48:13.908 --> 12:48:17.638
MADISON. HE SAID IN 1787 THAT 
IMPEACHMENT WAS FOR, QUOTE, 

12:48:17.928 --> 12:48:22.948
REMOVAL OF AN OFFICER WHO HAD 
RENDERED HIMSELF AS UNJUSTLY 

12:48:23.238 --> 12:48:27.268
CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE 
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, CLOSED 

12:48:27.568 --> 12:48:31.728
QUOTE. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. WHAT
YOU HAVE HERE IS A SLOP BUCKET 

12:48:32.138 --> 12:48:36.548
YOU ARE CALLING ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. SO WHAT WE HAVE 

12:48:36.848 --> 12:48:40.128
HEARD OVER THE 

12:48:44.228 --> 12:48:49.558
LAST TWO DAYS IS BASICALLY EVERY
GRIEVANCE THAT THE DEMOCRATS 

12:48:49.868 --> 12:48:54.638
HAVE, LADLING IT IN THE SLOP 
BUCKET AND THROWING IT OUT THERE

12:48:55.128 --> 12:48:58.258
AND TRIED TO PIGEON HOLE THE 
REASON INTO OBSTRUCTION OF 

12:48:58.638 --> 12:49:02.518
CONGRESS OR ABUSE OF POWER. THAT
-- THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT YOU 

12:49:02.818 --> 12:49:09.828
HAVE HERE, THAT YOU ARE ALL OVER
THE MAP BECAUSE YOU CAN'T 

12:49:10.128 --> 12:49:14.838
DELIVER A CRIME. THERE IS NO 
HIGH CRIME. THERE IS NO 

12:49:16.238 --> 12:49:18.828
MISDEMEANOR. THERE IS NO 
BRIBERY. REMEMBER THEY TRIED TO 

12:49:19.118 --> 12:49:22.138
EXPLAIN BRIBERY, AND IT TOOK 
ALMOST A FULL 5 MINUTES. AFTER 

12:49:22.538 --> 12:49:27.938
SHE WAS DONE, WE DIDN'T HEAR 
ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT BRIBERY 

12:49:28.748 --> 12:49:31.408
ANYMORE AS AN IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSE. WE TALK ABOUT QUID PRO 

12:49:31.708 --> 12:49:34.538
QUO. THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH OFF 
THE TABLE 

12:49:38.548 --> 12:49:41.738
UNTIL TONIGHT IT'S KIND OF 
REVVED BACK UP AGAIN. BUT YOU 

12:49:42.458 --> 12:49:44.458
DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC CHARGE 

12:49:48.358 --> 12:49:55.328
AND YOU USED THE TWO  AMORPHUS 
WEAK AREAS. AND YOU HAVE TRIED 

12:49:55.618 --> 12:49:59.248
DEFINITE AVENUES FOR THREE YEARS
NOW. I AM REMINDED THAT ONE OF 

12:49:59.558 --> 12:50:03.738
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
SAID YOU WANT TRUMP TO BE 

12:50:04.818 --> 12:50:07.218
SOMETHING HE ISN'T. IN REALITY 
IS, THAT'S PROJECTION. THE 

12:50:07.518 --> 12:50:13.738
REALITY IS YOU WANT HIM TO BE 
SOMETHING HE ISN'T. THAT'S WHY 

12:50:14.038 --> 12:50:17.738
YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPEACH HIM 
AND WHY YOU TRIED ALL KINDS OF 

12:50:18.238 --> 12:50:22.788
THEORIES THAT HAVE ALL FALLEN 
FLAT. THE BIG ONE WAS THE 

12:50:23.108 --> 12:50:25.238
MUELLER -- THE MUELLER 
IMPEACHMENT. YOU REALLY WANTED 

12:50:25.528 --> 12:50:28.808
THAT ONE. IT DIDN'T WORK SO 
WELL. IT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL 

12:50:30.838 --> 12:50:34.728
BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.
I WILL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 

12:50:37.778 --> 12:50:42.858
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND THIS 
DISCUSSION WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

12:50:43.358 --> 12:50:48.528
HE, HIMSELF, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
WITHOUT INSTIGATION IN THIS 

12:50:48.838 --> 12:50:51.338
CONVERSATION AT ALL, ABOUT 
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH AFTER SHE

12:50:51.638 --> 12:50:55.128
WAS RECALLED SAID HER ATTITUDE 
TOWARDS ME WAS FAR FROM THE 

12:50:55.418 --> 12:51:00.048
BEST. SHE ADMIRED THE PREVIOUS 
PRESIDENT AND SHE WAS ON HIS 

12:51:00.358 --> 12:51:02.358
SIDE. THIS IS THE 
ANTI-CORRUPTION CRUSADER 

12:51:05.738 --> 12:51:11.148
THAT YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT. 
THEN YOU TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT 

12:51:11.448 --> 12:51:15.038
PORASCHENKO BEING CORRUPT. I AM 
NOT SAYING HE WASN'T. BUT 

12:51:15.338 --> 12:51:19.528
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SAID THAT 
YOVANOVITCH WAS ON HIS SIDE. SHE

12:51:19.828 --> 12:51:23.228
WOULD NOT ACCEPT ME AS THE NEW 
PRESIDENT WELL ENOUGH. THE 

12:51:23.518 --> 12:51:28.528
REASON I BRING THAT UP IS 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID

12:51:28.928 --> 12:51:32.818
THERE IS NOTHING CONTESTED HERE.
THE FACTS ARE NOT CONTESTED. I 

12:51:33.108 --> 12:51:37.938
GO BACK TO SOMETHING I THINK IS 
VERY IMPORTANT. ALL THE 

12:51:38.428 --> 12:51:42.758
INTERFERENCES YOU'VE DRAWN HAVE 
BEEN DESIGNED TO GO AGAINST THIS

12:51:43.328 --> 12:51:49.838
PRESIDENT AND PAINT HIM IN THE 
LIGHT LEAST  FAVORABLE, AND 

12:51:50.148 --> 12:51:52.828
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO 
PROJECT HIM INTO BEING SOMETHING

12:51:53.118 --> 12:51:57.008
YOU WANT HIM TO BE. BUT WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE FACTS AND DIRECT 

12:51:57.308 --> 12:52:00.808
EVIDENCE, THE DIRECT EVIDENCE IS
REAL CLEAR. UKRAINE RECEIVED THE

12:52:01.108 --> 12:52:08.338
AID, PROVIDED NOTHING IN TURN. 
AND THEY STATED -- PRESIDENT 

12:52:08.648 --> 12:52:11.228
ZELENSKY AND THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER SAID THEY FELT NO 

12:52:12.548 --> 12:52:14.548
PRESSURE. THERE WAS NO 

12:52:17.248 --> 12:52:24.628
PRESSURE THERE. EVEN AMBASSADOR 
SOUND  SONDLAND WHO YOU RELIED 

12:52:25.128 --> 12:52:29.148
ON 600 TIMES IN YOUR EFFORT 
SAID, HEY, NOBODY TOLD ME. I 

12:52:29.458 --> 12:52:33.838
JUST PRESUMED IT. YOU DON'T HAVE
A CASE. YOU NEVER HAD A CASE. 

12:52:34.138 --> 12:52:39.128
YOU JUST WANTED TO HAVE A CASE. 
AND THAT'S THE SADNESS ABOUT IT.

12:52:39.428 --> 12:52:43.368
YOU'RE IMPEACHING HIM BECAUSE 
YOU WANTED TO FOR THREE YEARS. 

12:52:43.668 --> 12:52:47.058
YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM IN A 
REELECTION. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

12:52:47.358 --> 12:52:50.468
BEAT HIM IN A RE-ELECTION AND 
YOU ARE GOING TO IMPEACHMENT. 

12:52:50.788 --> 12:52:57.737
THAT IS A TRAGEDY FOR AMERICA. I
YIELD 

12:52:57.738 --> 12:53:04.128
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MOVE TO STRIKE THE LAST WORD.

12:53:04.438 --> 12:53:09.158
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. WITH 

12:53:09.458 --> 12:53:14.138
MUCH RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO
QUOTED JAMES MADISON, THERE 

12:53:17.838 --> 12:53:24.938
WAS A DESCRIPTION OF ABUSIVE 
POWER AMORPHOUS BY SOMEONE AND 

12:53:25.238 --> 12:53:29.428
NEBULAS USED BY A COLLEAGUE, AND
I OFFER YOU THE FOLLOWING QUOTE.

12:53:29.728 --> 12:53:35.138
THAT IS LIBERTY MAY BE 
ENDANGERED BY THE ABUSE OF 

12:53:35.628 --> 12:53:38.338
LIBERTY BUT ALSO BY THE ABUSE 

12:53:42.348 --> 12:53:47.448
OF POWER. THAT QUOTE IS FROM 
JAMES MADISON. THE PART OF THE 

12:53:47.748 --> 12:53:56.428
DEBATE THAT IS SO FRUSTRATING 
FOR ME, AND I THINK A LOT OF 

12:53:56.918 --> 12:53:59.938
AMERICANS WATCHING TONIGHT IS 
THE DIMINISHMENT OF THE PUBLIC 

12:54:00.228 --> 12:54:05.648
SERVICE PATRIOTS WHO STEPPED 
FORWARD AND PROVIDED THE 

12:54:05.938 --> 12:54:10.738
EVIDENCE THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT 
THE PRESIDENT ABUSED HIS POWER. 

12:54:11.048 --> 12:54:14.828
PEOPLE LIKE COLONEL VINDMAN WHO 
SERVED HIS COUNTRY BRAVELY 

12:54:15.118 --> 12:54:19.428
OVERSEES, PEOPLE LIKE AMBASSADOR
BILL TAYLOR, A WEST POINT 

12:54:20.438 --> 12:54:26.238
GRADUATE, A VIETNAM VETERAN. 
PEOPLE LIKE DR. FIONA HILL, 

12:54:26.638 --> 12:54:28.638
PEOPLE LIKE LAURA COOPER, 
OFFICIAL AFTER 

12:54:32.128 --> 12:54:36.868
OFFICIAL AFTER OFFICIAL FROM THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THESE 

12:54:37.228 --> 12:54:41.648
INDIVIDUALS SERVED IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION. 

12:54:41.948 --> 12:54:47.328
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WAS NOT 
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE

12:54:47.628 --> 12:54:52.038
WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT MY 

12:54:54.638 --> 12:54:57.738
COLLEAGUES, AS WE PROCEED WITH 
THE SOLEMN DUTY THAT THIS 

12:54:58.048 --> 12:55:02.238
COMMITTEE IS CHARGED WITH, THAT 
WE RESPECT THE PEOPLE WHO CAME 

12:55:02.538 --> 12:55:08.938
FORWARD WHO HAVE SERVED UNDER 
THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 

12:55:09.238 --> 12:55:14.548
ADMINISTRATION TO TELL THE TRUTH
UNDER OATH AND TO HELP THIS 

12:55:14.848 --> 12:55:20.938
COMMITTEE AS IT SEEKS TO HOLD 
THIS ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE.

12:55:21.248 --> 12:55:23.638
AND WITH THAT, I YIELD TO MS. 

12:55:27.648 --> 12:55:34.578
LAUGHLIN FROM CALIFORNIA. 
&gt;&gt; I THANK YOU, MR.NEGUSE. I WAS

12:55:34.868 --> 12:55:38.538
&gt;&gt;&gt; WILLING  TO LISTEN TO THE 
DEBATE AND MOST OF US ARE 

12:55:38.838 --> 12:55:42.948
LAWYERS BUT OUR FOUNDING 
FATHERS, CONSIDERING THE CODE 

12:55:43.238 --> 12:55:45.238
PRECEDENT IN THE McCONNELL CASE 
AND 

12:55:49.158 --> 12:55:55.218
THE SUPREME COURT CASE AS  
PRECEDENT IN 1789 IS RIDICULOUS.

12:55:55.518 --> 12:55:57.518
MR. NEG USE 

12:55:59.438 --> 12:56:03.828
IS POINTING OUT WHAT  FOUNDING 
FATHER HIS IN MIND AND THAT HIGH

12:56:04.138 --> 12:56:07.238
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS WERE THE
ACTIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT USE 

12:56:07.528 --> 12:56:13.828
WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY POWER HE 
WAS GIVEN UNDER THE INSTITUTION 

12:56:14.128 --> 12:56:17.048
TO SUBVERT THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
ORDER, PREVENT THE 

12:56:17.348 --> 12:56:19.778
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM FROM 
WORKING, AND THAT IS THE CONCERN

12:56:20.068 --> 12:56:25.678
THAT WE HAVE HERE, NOT ONLY THAT
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE THAT BUT 

12:56:27.638 --> 12:56:32.478
THAT HE IS NOT CONTRITE. HE IS 
NOT CORRECTING HIS BEHAVIOR. HE 

12:56:32.778 --> 12:56:37.838
IS CONTINUING TO DO IT. HE IS 
PRESENTING AN ONGOING THREAT. HE

12:56:38.138 --> 12:56:44.238
WILL CONTINUE TO SUBVERT THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. SO I THANK

12:56:44.538 --> 12:56:50.978
MR. NEGUSE FOR YIELDING TO ME ON
THE IDEA THAT THIS COURT DATE 

12:56:51.278 --> 12:56:53.278
WOULD HAVE 

12:56:55.538 --> 12:56:57.847
BEEN PRECEDENT IN 1789. I YIELD 
BACK. 

12:56:57.848 --> 12:57:00.568
&gt;&gt; MR. NEGUSE? 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD THE BALANCE OF MY 

12:57:00.858 --> 12:57:02.928
TIME. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, AND I WANT TO 

12:57:03.228 --> 12:57:06.038
REMIND MY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE 
INTRODUCED INTO THE RECORD A 

12:57:07.348 --> 12:57:12.638
LETTER FROM 500 LEGAL SCHOLARS 
THAT REALLY REINFORCED THE POINT

12:57:12.938 --> 12:57:20.038
MR. NEGUSE JUST MADE, AND 
IMPEACHMENT IS CONDUCT THAT 

12:57:20.348 --> 12:57:23.418
CORRUPTS  ELECTIONS. IF A 
PRESIDENT BEHAVES POORLY, HE CAN

12:57:23.718 --> 12:57:27.748
BE PUNISHED BY HIS PARTY OR AT 
THE POLLS. BUT THE PRESIDENT 

12:57:28.038 --> 12:57:34.138
LOOKS TO PLACE HIMSELF BEYOND 
THE REACH OF THE POLITICAL 

12:57:34.448 --> 12:57:38.018
CHECK. GEORGE MASON DECIDES 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES AS ATTEMPTS

12:57:38.318 --> 12:57:43.118
TO SUBVERT THE CONSTITUTION BY 
WHICH CONSTITUTION MAKES THE 

12:57:43.838 --> 12:57:48.438
DEMOCRAT ACCOUNTABLE, AND IF THE
PRESIDENT CHEATS IN HISSISTS OF 

12:57:48.738 --> 12:57:52.118
REELECTION IS NO REMEDY AT ALL. 
THIS IS WHAT IMPEACHMENT IS FOR.

12:57:52.418 --> 12:57:57.548
I ASK MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, 
HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD ALLOW OR 

12:57:57.858 --> 12:58:03.858
SOLICIT A FOREIGN POWER TO HELP 
WITH AN ELECTION? PLEASE RAISE 

12:58:04.248 --> 12:58:07.508
YOUR HAND? NOT ONE OF YOU. YOU 
KNOW IT WOULD CORRUPT THE 

12:58:07.808 --> 12:58:10.698
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE WHO 
WOULD REPRESENT THEM IN THE 

12:58:10.998 --> 12:58:13.428
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. I WAS MAYOR OF 

12:58:13.718 --> 12:58:19.668
PROVIDENCE, LIKE IF I GOT A 
FEDERAL GRANT 

12:58:23.378 --> 12:58:25.378
OF $1 

12:58:29.248 --> 12:58:31.538
MILLION -- 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMAN, GENTLEMAN? 

12:58:31.838 --> 12:58:33.037
GENTLEMAN? 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN? 

12:58:33.038 --> 12:58:36.708
&gt;&gt; THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE MOVE TO STRIKE THE 

12:58:37.008 --> 12:58:39.098
LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt; NO. YOU HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN. 

12:58:39.388 --> 12:58:45.758
THE QUESTION IS NOW ON THE 
AMENDMENT. THOSE IN FAVOR SAY 

12:58:46.528 --> 12:58:48.437
AYE. OPPOSED NO? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

12:58:48.438 --> 12:58:52.837
&gt;&gt; THE NAYS HAVE IT. 
&gt;&gt; ROLL CALL? 

12:58:52.838 --> 12:59:00.327
&gt;&gt; THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL.

13:45:36.098 --> 13:45:42.536
PENDING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS 
IN NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE.

13:45:46.266 --> 13:45:48.295
STRIKE THE LAST WORD ON THE 
AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF 

13:45:49.063 --> 13:45:51.063
SUBSIDY. 
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMEN IS A RECOGNIZE. 

13:45:51.289 --> 13:45:57.040
&gt;&gt; CHAIRMAN. THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE LAST OF A VERY LONG DAY THAT

13:45:57.240 --> 13:46:02.941
WE HAVE HAD. I WOULD LIKE TO 
COMMEND THE CHAIRMAN FOR 

13:46:03.254 --> 13:46:08.861
FOLLOWING THE RULES. THIS MARKUP
HAS BEEN A LOT BETTER THAN IT 

13:46:09.116 --> 13:46:14.897
COULD HAVE BEEN. AND I THINK THE
CHAIRMAN HAS BEEN VERY EVEN 

13:46:15.509 --> 13:46:20.406
HANDED. THE CHAIRMAN

13:46:26.545 --> 13:46:29.210
AND THOSE ON HIS SIDE OF THE 
AISLE ARE DEAD WRONG. NOT ALL OF

13:46:29.415 --> 13:46:35.413
THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
DEBATING. THE

13:46:40.967 --> 13:46:42.967
PRESIDENT CAN BE IMPEACHED FOR 
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. 

13:46:43.198 --> 13:46:45.198
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS NO

13:46:52.336 --> 13:46:54.336
PRISONER BRIBERY ALLEGED. IT 
GOES DOWN TO WHAT HAS BEEN 

13:46:54.368 --> 13:46:56.403
ALLEGED IN THESE TWO ARTICLES. 
WHETHER THEY ARE HIGH CRIMES AND

13:46:56.616 --> 13:46:58.973
MISDEMEANORS. I WOULD SUBMIT THE
ANSWER ON BOTH IS EMPHATICALLY 

13:46:59.171 --> 13:47:08.185
NO. WHAT IS ACCUSED OF BEING AN 
ABUSE OF POWER? IN MY OPINION A 

13:47:08.946 --> 13:47:10.946
POLICY DISAGREEMENT

13:47:13.457 --> 13:47:15.305
ON HOW THE PRESIDENT SHOULD'VE 
APPROACHED THE ISSUES OUTLINED 

13:47:15.306 --> 13:47:17.306
THERE. LET ME SAY

13:47:22.811 --> 13:47:25.531
AS FAR AS FOREIGN AID GOES. AND 
THE ISSUE OF THE $391 MILLION OF

13:47:25.735 --> 13:47:30.115
FOREIGN AID TO UKRAINE IS WHAT 
IS IN THE CENTER. PRACTICALLY 

13:47:30.315 --> 13:47:33.980
EVERY BIT OF FOREIGN AID THAT 
THE UNITED STATES DISBURSES 

13:47:34.383 --> 13:47:37.587
FOLLOWING AN APPROPRIATION IS 
CONTINGENT UPON SOMETHING

13:47:42.307 --> 13:47:48.756
ONE OF THE COMMON THREADS IS 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY TYPE

13:47:48.955 --> 13:47:50.955
OF CORRUPTION INVOLVED.

13:47:54.292 --> 13:47:56.292
WE HAVE ALL CONCEDED THAT 
UKRAINE HAS BEEN A PRETTY 

13:47:56.526 --> 13:47:59.719
CORRUPT COUNTRY. AND THAT 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY WAS

13:48:02.614 --> 13:48:04.614
ELECTED ON AN ANTICORRUPTION 
PLATFORM.

13:48:09.465 --> 13:48:15.625
THE PRESENT WOULD BE DERELICT IN
HIS DUTY IF HE HAD GIVEN FOREIGN

13:48:16.386 --> 13:48:18.386
AID WITHOUT CHECKING ON 
CORRUPTION

13:48:23.544 --> 13:48:26.060
. THAT IS WHAT WAS GOING ON. AS 
FAR AS OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. 

13:48:26.255 --> 13:48:28.255
EARLIER TODAY I

13:48:32.680 --> 13:48:34.801
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT THIS ARTICLE IS 

13:48:34.997 --> 13:48:37.176
DRAFTED SO LOOSELY AND SO WEAKLY
THAT IT TURNS THE UNITED STATES 

13:48:37.912 --> 13:48:42.029
INTO A PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF 
GOVERNMENT. THE CONSEQUENCE OF 

13:48:42.230 --> 13:48:45.884
THAT. WHENEVER WE HAVE A PRESENT
IN THE MAJORITY HOUSE CONTROLLED

13:48:46.091 --> 13:48:51.972
BY OPPOSITE PARTIES. YOU WILL 
ATTEMPT TO SEE THE MAJORITY TRY 

13:48:52.202 --> 13:49:01.528
TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. WHAT I
WOULD LIKE TO SAY. WE HAVE HEARD

13:49:01.727 --> 13:49:03.727
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT
IF

13:49:07.816 --> 13:49:09.816
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT 
IMPEACHED. THAT HE WILL STILL 

13:49:09.879 --> 13:49:13.918
THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT IS ONE 
OF THE MOST OUTLANDISH 

13:49:14.146 --> 13:49:18.063
PREDICTIONS I HAVE EVER HEARD. 
THE 2020 ELECTION IS GOING TO 

13:49:18.259 --> 13:49:23.269
LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY. BY 
REPRESENTING THE BOTH OF THE 

13:49:23.475 --> 13:49:27.727
CANDIDATES. THE NEWS MEDIA AND 
BY A LOT OF CITIZENS. WHETHER 

13:49:28.016 --> 13:49:33.857
THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH THE 
CAMPAIGN OR NOT. AND THAT'S 

13:49:34.059 --> 13:49:39.751
GOING TO BE HARD TO STEAL THE 
2020 ELECTION AFTER ALL OF THIS 

13:49:40.504 --> 13:49:47.062
HAS HAPPENED. WHAT HAPPENING 
HERE. IS THERE IS ANY ATTEMPT TO

13:49:47.262 --> 13:49:53.548
STEAL THE 2016 ELECTION THREE 
YEARS AFTER THE FACT. IF 

13:49:53.762 --> 13:49:55.762
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS 
IMPEACHED AND REMOVED FROM 

13:49:55.941 --> 13:50:02.084
OFFICE BASED ON THIS FLIMSY 
RECORD. ALL THE PROBLEMS OF 

13:50:02.498 --> 13:50:04.498
EXTINGUISHING MINORITY RIGHTS.

13:50:11.433 --> 13:50:14.684
THAT WILL END UP STEALING THE 
2016 ELECTION. AND AVOIDING THAT

13:50:14.885 --> 13:50:16.885
THE VOTES OF THE

13:50:20.371 --> 13:50:22.371
63 MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR 

13:50:22.588 --> 13:50:24.779
PRESENT UNITED STATES. I THINK

13:50:28.496 --> 13:50:30.574
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL
HAUNT THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES 

13:50:31.290 --> 13:50:36.543
TO COME. THE TIME TO STAND UP 
FOR THE CONSTITUTION IS NOW.

13:50:40.678 --> 13:50:43.056
THE TIME TO DETERMINE HOW YOU 
STAND UP TO THE CONSTITUTION IS 

13:50:43.253 --> 13:50:47.592
BY VOTING NO ON BOTH ARTICLES OF
IMPEACHMENT. AND I YIELD BACK 

13:50:47.794 --> 13:50:52.530
THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt; STRIKE THE LAST WORD.

13:50:58.970 --> 13:51:00.742
BUT THE GENTLEMAN IS A 
RECOGNIZE. 

13:51:00.743 --> 13:51:07.519
&gt;&gt; I JOIN IN COMMENDING THE 
CHAIRMAN ON HIS RUNNING OF THE 

13:51:07.720 --> 13:51:09.720
COMMITTEE TONIGHT. IT'S BEEN 
VERY DIFFICULT. IT'S BEEN A VERY

13:51:09.955 --> 13:51:14.023
LONG DAY. WE ARE ALL TIRED. AT 
LEAST I AM. THE CHAIRMAN HAS 

13:51:14.234 --> 13:51:19.715
DONE A GREAT JOB. I TOTALLY 
DISAGREE WITH THE SUMMATION OF 

13:51:19.917 --> 13:51:23.872
WHAT WE HAD BEFORE US. I THINK 
THEY ARE DEAD WRONG IN THEIR 

13:51:24.103 --> 13:51:26.756
OPINION ON THE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THERE ARE TWO 

13:51:26.956 --> 13:51:31.048
ARTICLES. THIS IS NOT STEALING 
AN ELECTION. IF

13:51:34.962 --> 13:51:36.608
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS 
REMOVED FROM OFFICE. THE 

13:51:36.609 --> 13:51:38.609
ELECTION OF 2016 IS NOT 
NULLIFIED.

13:51:42.266 --> 13:51:44.506
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL 
BE THE PRESIDENT AND THAT IS NO 

13:51:44.715 --> 13:51:46.870
WALK IN THE PARK. THE SAME 
POLICIES, SOME MAY BE WORSE. 

13:51:47.068 --> 13:51:49.934
MAYBE A LITTLE BETTER ETHICS, 
MORALS, AND CIVILITY.

13:51:54.456 --> 13:51:57.457
AS FOR POLITICS IT WILL BE THE 
SAME. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 

13:51:57.658 --> 13:52:01.784
DISCUSSION. BASICALLY THIS IS AN
ISSUE ABOUT ABUSE OF POWER BASED

13:52:02.532 --> 13:52:04.766
ON TESTIMONY OF

13:52:13.547 --> 13:52:17.617
FOUR INDEPENDENT WITNESSES. 
PEOPLE WE SHOULD LOOK TOO.  WE 

13:52:17.823 --> 13:52:23.502
TALK ABOUT THEM AS PATRIOTS. 
THEY ARE CAREER FOREIGN SERVICE 

13:52:23.796 --> 13:52:26.724
EMPLOYEES WHO'VE DONE A GREAT 
JOB. IN THE

13:52:38.752 --> 13:52:41.202
CAME FORWARD OUT OF A SENSE OF 
DUTY TO TESTIFY. AND WHAT THEY 

13:52:41.401 --> 13:52:43.401
TESTIFIED TO IS WHAT HAPPENED 
WITH THAT UKRAINE WAS WRONG. 

13:52:43.461 --> 13:52:45.461
THAT THERE WAS AN ABUSE OF 
POWER. THAT'S WHY THEY CAME 

13:52:45.667 --> 13:52:47.903
FORWARD. TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE 
PROCESS IS CORRUPT IS AN AFFRONT

13:52:48.125 --> 13:52:51.556
TO THOSE FOUR PATRIOTS THAT CAME
FOR. THOSE OF FOUR CAREER 

13:52:51.959 --> 13:52:56.626
FOREIGN SERVICE PEOPLE. THEY DID
A SERVICE TO THIS COUNTRY.  THE 

13:52:56.840 --> 13:53:06.416
FACTS ARE INDISPUTABLE. WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS CALLED 

13:53:07.376 --> 13:53:09.376
A FAVOR. AND

13:53:15.551 --> 13:53:18.221
THEY SAID THEY WERE ALL IN ON. 
IT WAS A REQUIREMENT TO GET THE 

13:53:18.603 --> 13:53:21.853
MILITARY AID YOU HAVE TO 
ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATION. THERE IS

13:53:22.055 --> 13:53:28.142
NOTHING OTHER THAN THAT. WE HAVE
BEEN HERE THE LAST FEW HOURS. 

13:53:28.557 --> 13:53:31.129
THEY USE IT AS A CAMPAIGN AD FOR
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

13:53:34.844 --> 13:53:38.454
SNAP PAYMENTS ARE BEING CUT 
DRASTICALLY AND POOR PEOPLE ARE 

13:53:38.653 --> 13:53:40.653
BEING HURT.

13:53:45.210 --> 13:53:48.015
BOB CORKER SAID THE TWO BIGGEST 
MISTAKES HE MADE WERE VOTING FOR

13:53:48.221 --> 13:53:50.221
THE

13:53:53.141 --> 13:53:55.213
TAX SCAM AND THE BUDGET THAT 
CAME AFTERWARDS. SOMEBODY ON THE

13:53:55.415 --> 13:53:58.839
OTHER SIDE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE 
NEED TO BE UP HERE. THEY HAVE 

13:53:59.049 --> 13:54:02.625
EXPLODED THE DEBT. THEY HAVE NO 
TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHY 

13:54:02.822 --> 13:54:04.822
WHATSOEVER.

13:54:07.358 --> 13:54:15.088
THE KURDS HAVE RUINED US IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST FOREVER. WE GAVE 

13:54:15.290 --> 13:54:18.711
ASSYRIA TO THE RUSSIANS. AND 
YESTERDAY

13:54:23.211 --> 13:54:25.056
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP MET WITH 
THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. NO 

13:54:25.057 --> 13:54:27.057
REPORT OF WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT

13:54:32.754 --> 13:54:36.003
HE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO 
INFLUENCE THE NEXT ELECTIONS. 

13:54:36.216 --> 13:54:41.287
THEY SAID WE DID DISCUSS THE 
ELECTIONS. IT'S HARD TO FIGURE 

13:54:41.489 --> 13:54:45.100
OUT WHO IS LYING? MADE OF THEM 
HAVE A GOOD TRACK RECORD.

13:54:49.004 --> 13:54:51.041
I HOPE WE CAN PASS THESE 
ARTICLES AND DO WHAT IS 

13:54:51.239 --> 13:54:53.239
IMPORTANT TO PROTECT

13:54:57.337 --> 13:54:59.577
OUR DEMOCRACY, SUPPORT OUR OATH.
ABIDE BY OUR OATH. SUPPORT THE 

13:54:59.779 --> 13:55:01.779
CONSTITUTION AND OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY. ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

13:55:01.869 --> 13:55:03.869
JEOPARDIZED BY PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP

13:55:09.522 --> 13:55:11.560
AND HIS DEALINGS WITH UKRAINE. I
SAID EARLIER TODAY THAT THE 

13:55:11.764 --> 13:55:13.937
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE WAS AN 
ACTOR AND A POLITICIAN.

13:55:17.643 --> 13:55:19.968
A LOT OF ACTORS ARE GREAT. I 
LOVE ACTORS AND POLITICIANS. I 

13:55:20.168 --> 13:55:26.175
AM A POLITICIAN. THAT IS WHY HE 
COULD NOT SAY HE WAS UNDER ANY 

13:55:26.374 --> 13:55:31.057
DURESS OR INFLUENCE. HE COULDN'T
SAY THAT BECAUSE HE'S IN AN 

13:55:31.821 --> 13:55:41.043
INFERIOR POSITION. HE CAN'T SAY 
HE BEAT ME UP. BECAUSE HE'S 

13:55:41.238 --> 13:55:43.826
THERE. AND WHEN THE POLICE LEAVE
HE WILL DO IT AGAIN.

13:55:47.947 --> 13:55:50.419
HE WAS IN A TERRIBLE POSITION. I
LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING HIM. I 

13:55:50.616 --> 13:55:53.143
WILL BE IN UKRAINE IN FEBRUARY. 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO DO A 

13:55:53.337 --> 13:55:57.483
WONDERFUL JOB. FOR SOME PEOPLE 
WHO SAY THAT UKRAINE WAS THE 

13:55:57.897 --> 13:56:00.266
THIRD WORST COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD. IT'S 120th IN THE 

13:56:00.468 --> 13:56:02.468
RANKINGS.

13:56:03.987 --> 13:56:06.281
NOT GOOD BUT NOT THE THIRD 
WORST. I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE 

13:56:06.488 --> 13:56:09.197
OF MY TIME. GOD BLESS THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. BUT GENTLEMEN

13:56:09.884 --> 13:56:12.316
YIELD THE BACK. WE ALL SHARE 
THOSE SENTIMENTS. WHO ELSE SEEKS

13:56:12.522 --> 13:56:18.619
RECOGNITION? WHAT PURPOSE? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. MR. CHAIRMAN. I 

13:56:18.818 --> 13:56:23.484
HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE GENTLEMAN
FROM TENNESSEE. I WOULD START 

13:56:23.699 --> 13:56:30.144
OFF BY SAYING THAT I REALLY LIKE
MR. ON. WE'VE WORKED ON A NUMBER

13:56:30.348 --> 13:56:32.348
OF

13:56:34.057 --> 13:56:39.139
BILLS. BUT HE'S FLAT-OUT WRONG 
ABOUT THE TAXES. THEY REALLY 

13:56:39.341 --> 13:56:41.593
HELP THIS COUNTRY. ONE OF THE 
MAIN REASONS WE SEE THE ECONOMY 

13:56:42.326 --> 13:56:44.326
TAKE OFF.

13:56:47.248 --> 13:56:49.648
THE PRESIDENT AND A REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESS PASS THOSE

13:57:02.088 --> 13:57:06.553
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. RELATIVE 
TO IMPEACHMENT. BACK IN THE 

13:57:06.754 --> 13:57:11.422
EARLY 1970S. I WAS A COLLEGE 
STUDENT. THE NATION WAS GOING 

13:57:11.622 --> 13:57:13.622
THROUGH ANOTHER IMPEACHMENT. I 
VOTED FOR

13:57:17.522 --> 13:57:20.993
HIM IN 1972. OBVIOUSLY HE GOT IN
TROUBLE AND WAS GOING TO BE 

13:57:21.193 --> 13:57:23.193
IMPEACHED. HE RESIGNED

13:57:31.126 --> 13:57:34.584
BEFORE THE HOUSE TO GET UP. 
LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT AT 25 

13:57:34.790 --> 13:57:38.659
YEARS LATER THAT THE NATION 
WOULD BE GOING THROUGH ANOTHER 

13:57:38.859 --> 13:57:41.895
IMPEACHMENT. AND THAT WAS BILL 
CLINTON. AND THAT I WOULD BE 

13:57:42.123 --> 13:57:47.532
CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THAT. OF THE
41 PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT 

13:57:47.735 --> 13:57:50.376
COMMITTEE. FIVE OF US WERE HERE 
IN THOSE DAYS.

13:58:05.864 --> 13:58:08.111
SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THE OTHER 
SIDE WILL GET THE OPPORTUNITY. 

13:58:08.312 --> 13:58:10.312
AND GOOD LUCK.

13:58:16.216 --> 13:58:19.224
HE SAID WERE NOT GOING TO BE 
VERY WELCOME OVER THERE. AND WE 

13:58:19.426 --> 13:58:21.426
WEREN'T.

13:58:26.988 --> 13:58:29.634
BILL CLINTON WAS IMPEACHED BY 
THE HOUSE. IN THE SENATE DID NOT

13:58:29.836 --> 13:58:31.836
REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE.

13:58:46.646 --> 13:58:48.675
BILL CLINTON COMMITTED PERJURY.

13:58:56.239 --> 13:58:58.616
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT 
SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW.

13:59:22.581 --> 13:59:27.249
THE MEMBERS FILED ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT.

13:59:33.000 --> 13:59:37.265
THIS IN MY VIEW IS ALL ABOUT 
POLITICS. ALL ABOUT HURTING THE 

13:59:37.469 --> 13:59:41.265
PRESIDENT AND HIS REPUTATION. 
THEY DISLIKE HIM INTENTIONALLY. 

13:59:41.467 --> 13:59:43.467
THEY

13:59:48.848 --> 13:59:50.928
LOATHE THIS PRESIDENT AND THEY 
ARE HURTING HIS CHANCES IN THE 

13:59:51.129 --> 13:59:53.566
NEXT ELECTION AND IT MAY DO JUST
THE OPPOSITE. ONE OF MY REAL 

13:59:53.771 --> 13:59:58.183
CONCERNS. I MENTION THIS EARLIER
TODAY. I'M VERY CONCERNED. 

13:59:58.598 --> 14:00:00.598
DEMOCRATS ARE LOWERING THE BAR 
FOR IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT IN 

14:00:00.830 --> 14:00:02.830
THE FUTURE. IT'S BECOMING

14:00:06.256 --> 14:00:08.289
TOO ROUTINE. WE'VE HAD

14:00:12.815 --> 14:00:14.815
ONE IMPEACHMENT INTO HUNDRED 
YEARS. ANDREW JOHNSON. AND IN 50

14:00:14.857 --> 14:00:21.293
YEARS RUN A THIRD ONE. I AM 
CONCERNED FROM NOW ON IN ALL 

14:00:21.487 --> 14:00:26.430
LIKELIHOOD WHEN YOU HAVE THE 
PRESENT UNITED STATES AND THE 

14:00:26.652 --> 14:00:29.006
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 
THEIR OPPOSITE PARTIES. YOU WILL

14:00:29.206 --> 14:00:36.398
END UP WITH THE BASE PUSHING 
VERY HARD TO IMPEACH THAT 

14:00:36.600 --> 14:00:41.053
PRESIDENT. IT IS A VERY DIVISIVE
FOR THE NATION. SO MANY OTHER 

14:00:41.253 --> 14:00:48.156
THINGS DON'T GET DONE. OPIOIDS 
ARE OVER 70,000. WE'VE DONE VERY

14:00:48.356 --> 14:00:50.356
LITTLE ABOUT OPIOIDS.

14:00:54.054 --> 14:00:56.054
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER. FAR TOO MANY 

14:00:56.086 --> 14:01:04.405
PEOPLE COME IN. OVERALL IN 
CONGRESS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS 

14:01:04.820 --> 14:01:06.820
CRUMBLING. WE DO VERY LITTLE 
ABOUT THAT.

14:01:10.091 --> 14:01:12.129
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
DESERVE A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT 

14:01:12.333 --> 14:01:14.517
THEY ARE GETTING FROM THIS 
COMMITTEE AND THIS CONGRESS.

14:01:20.856 --> 14:01:23.100
I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS OUT 
THERE, GOD BLESS AMERICA PICS 

14:01:23.304 --> 14:01:25.304
BUT GENTLEMEN YOUR TIME IS 
EXPIRED.

14:01:31.623 --> 14:01:33.264
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

14:01:33.265 --> 14:01:35.604
&gt;&gt; GENTLEMEN IS A WRECK NICE. 
BUT MR. CHAIRMAN. I WANT TO 

14:01:35.806 --> 14:01:41.308
START BY AGREEING THAT IT IS THE
RIGHT TIME TO DEFEND THE 

14:01:41.506 --> 14:01:45.543
CONSTITUTION. THAT'S THE VERY 
REASON WE ARE HERE. THERE ARE 

14:01:45.744 --> 14:01:50.939
TWO ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. 
ABUSE OF POWER. THE PRESIDENT 

14:01:51.156 --> 14:01:53.156
ABUSED HIS POWER BY

14:01:56.206 --> 14:02:00.670
CHEATING THE AMERICAN VOTERS. 
HOW DID HE DO IT? HE LEVERAGED 

14:02:01.622 --> 14:02:03.622
LIFE SAVING

14:02:05.138 --> 14:02:08.950
, TAXPAYER-FUNDED MILITARY AID 
THAT UKRAINE DESPERATELY NEEDED.

14:02:12.456 --> 14:02:16.921
HE LEVERAGED A WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING THAT HE PROMISED TO THE 

14:02:17.337 --> 14:02:21.803
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. THAT 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY 

14:02:22.561 --> 14:02:24.561
DESPERATELY NEEDED TO SHOW 
VLADIMIR

14:02:30.536 --> 14:02:32.691
PUTIN THAT THE UNITED STATES IS 
WILLING TO STAND WITH UKRAINE. 

14:02:32.901 --> 14:02:34.901
HE LEVERAGED THAT MEETING FOR 
ASSISTANCE IN HIS REELECTION 

14:02:35.061 --> 14:02:39.746
CAMPAIGN. THAT IS ABUSE OF POWER
. MY COLLEAGUES SUGGESTED THAT 

14:02:39.953 --> 14:02:43.288
ABUSE OF POWER IS NOT A SERIOUS 
OFFENSE.

14:02:49.836 --> 14:02:51.836
NOT TREATED LIKE THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION THAT IT

14:02:52.119 --> 14:02:57.554
IS. THE ABUSE OF POWER WAS 
PRINCIPAL CONCERN TO THE FRAMERS

14:02:57.764 --> 14:03:01.817
OF THE CONSTITUTION. IT WAS 
CLEAR WHAT IT MEANT. OBTAINING A

14:03:02.026 --> 14:03:08.515
PERSONAL BENEFIT WHILE IGNORING 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST. THAT'S 

14:03:08.917 --> 14:03:14.411
ABUSE OF POWER. IT IS ROOTED IN 
THE PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL 

14:03:14.613 --> 14:03:19.486
DUTY TO FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE 
LAW. TO PUT SERVICE OVER SELF, 

14:03:20.248 --> 14:03:26.019
THE COUNTRY OVER PERSONAL 
INTEREST. I NOTE THAT ALL FOUR 

14:03:26.746 --> 14:03:34.108
OF THE CONSTITUTION SCHOLARS WHO
TESTIFIED. HAVE CONFIRMED THAT 

14:03:34.520 --> 14:03:36.880
ABUSE OF POWER IS IN IMPEACHABLE
OFFENSE. PRESIDENT DONALD 

14:03:37.510 --> 14:03:43.859
TRUMP'S ACTIONS EXEMPLIFY THE 
FRAMERS FEARS AND THE VERY 

14:03:44.074 --> 14:03:48.326
REASON ABUSE OF POWER IS A HIGH 
CRIME.

14:03:52.643 --> 14:03:56.854
WORSENED THE NIXON. PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP PRESSURED A FEDERAL

14:03:57.056 --> 14:04:02.536
GOVERNMENT. THAT IS ABUSE OF 
POWER. THERE IS A SECOND ARTICLE

14:04:02.793 --> 14:04:08.240
. OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. WE 
KNOW THAT NO PRESIDENT IN 

14:04:08.444 --> 14:04:12.905
HISTORY HAS DIRECTED THE ENTIRE 
EXECUTIVE

14:04:17.218 --> 14:04:19.218
BRANCH TO NOT COOPERATE. HAS 
TOLD EVERY MEMBER OF THE 

14:04:19.268 --> 14:04:27.321
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO NOT SPEAK TO
ANY OF THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 

14:04:27.620 --> 14:04:29.620
ISSUES.

14:04:33.266 --> 14:04:35.763
THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE ABUSE OF POWER WHICH THE 

14:04:36.045 --> 14:04:38.045
CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION. AND 
YOU LOOK AT THE PRESENCE

14:04:41.797 --> 14:04:43.797
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. IT 
LEADS TO QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD 

14:04:43.839 --> 14:04:47.489
LIKE MY COLLEAGUES TO THINK 
ABOUT AS WE HEAD TOWARDS IS 

14:04:48.229 --> 14:04:51.373
IMPORTANT BOAT. THINK ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

14:04:51.573 --> 14:04:58.808
BLOCKED FROM SPEAKING. MICK 
MULVANEY THE ACTING CHIEF OF 

14:04:59.111 --> 14:05:01.111
STAFF ACKNOWLEDGED

14:05:08.428 --> 14:05:10.560
THE QUID PRO QUO. THEN THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD NOT LET HIM 

14:05:10.774 --> 14:05:12.774
SPEAK. THAT'S OBSTRUCTION OF 
CONGRESS. WHY WON'T HE LET HIM 

14:05:12.855 --> 14:05:19.783
SPEAK? WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO HIDE
THINK ABOUT SECRETARY.. LED BY 

14:05:20.745 --> 14:05:22.745
RUDY GIULIANI.

14:05:26.484 --> 14:05:28.556
THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE ABUSE OF
POWER, IT HIGHLIGHTS THE ABUSE 

14:05:28.918 --> 14:05:32.930
OF POWER. IT IS ALSO OBSTRUCTION
OF CONGRESS. WHY WON'T THE 

14:05:33.134 --> 14:05:39.433
PRESIDENT ALLOW HIM TO SPEAK? 
WHAT IS HE AFRAID OF? THINK 

14:05:39.631 --> 14:05:41.631
ABOUT

14:05:43.337 --> 14:05:45.572
JOHN BOLTON. FIONA HILL SAID 
THAT BOLTON TOLD HER TO NOTIFY 

14:05:45.786 --> 14:05:54.316
HIM ABOUT THE ROGUE EFFORT. FAIN
I'M NOT PART OF ANY DRUG DEAL. 

14:05:54.715 --> 14:05:56.715
HE CALLED RUDY GIULIANI

14:06:04.062 --> 14:06:06.414
TO HANG GRENADE THAT'S GOING TO 
BLOW EVERYBODY UP. THAT IS THE 

14:06:06.613 --> 14:06:08.654
ABUSE OF POWER. OBSTRUCTION OF 
CONGRESS IS CLEAR. WHY WON'T THE

14:06:08.853 --> 14:06:13.352
PRESIDENT LET HIM TESTIFY. AND 
FINALLY JOHN EISENBERG. IT WAS 

14:06:13.558 --> 14:06:18.481
REPORTED AND NOW HE CANNOT 
SPEAK. WHAT IS IT THAT THE 

14:06:18.683 --> 14:06:20.683
PRESIDENT IS AFRAID HE WILL SAY.

14:06:25.808 --> 14:06:27.808
ABUSE OF POWER AND OBSTRUCTION 
OF CONGRESS TOGETHER. THAT IS 

14:06:27.967 --> 14:06:29.967
WHAT THESE ARTICLES ARE ABOUT. 
WE ARE PROTECTING THE AMERICAN 

14:06:30.005 --> 14:06:32.450
PEOPLE IN OUR ELECTIONS. THAT IS
WHY WE NEED TO

14:06:36.802 --> 14:06:38.423
PROCEED WITH ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. I YIELD BACK. 

14:06:38.424 --> 14:06:44.068
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 

14:06:44.271 --> 14:06:50.406
WORD. 
&gt;&gt; I BEEN A PROSECUTOR, I 

14:06:51.169 --> 14:06:57.305
PROSECUTED TERRORISTS IN THE 
NAVY. I WAS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY. 

14:06:57.720 --> 14:07:01.991
I DEFENDED A NAVY SEAL AGAINST 
TRUMPED UP CHARGES FROM THE 

14:07:02.194 --> 14:07:05.993
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND I HAD 
THE HONOR OF SERVING IN MY 

14:07:06.202 --> 14:07:13.769
HOMETOWN I'VE BEEN IN ALL SIDES 
OF THE COURTROOM. AND I WOULD 

14:07:13.971 --> 14:07:19.357
DEFEND THIS CASE EVERY SINGLE 
DAY. BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE NOT 

14:07:19.584 --> 14:07:21.904
THERE. LET'S GO THROUGH EACH 
ARTICLE. ABUSE OF POWER OR QUID 

14:07:22.103 --> 14:07:24.103
PRO QUO, BRIBERY.

14:07:27.785 --> 14:07:30.115
CALL IT WHATEVER YOUR FOCUS 
GROUP WANTS TO CALL. AT THE END 

14:07:30.319 --> 14:07:32.972
OF THE DAY YOU DO NOT HAVE THE 
FACTS TO MAKE THE CASE. YOU 

14:07:33.171 --> 14:07:37.134
DON'T HAVE THE FAX BECAUSE THE 
OTHER PARTY IN YOUR LEGEND QUID 

14:07:37.336 --> 14:07:39.336
PRO QUO NEVER FELT

14:07:45.454 --> 14:07:47.283
PRESSURE. WE HAVE A PRIMARY 
SOURCE DOCUMENT. THE PRIMARY 

14:07:47.284 --> 14:07:49.284
SOURCE OF INFORMATION. THE 
TRANSCRIPT OF THE CALL. IT SHOWS

14:07:49.321 --> 14:07:51.781
THERE IS NO CONNECTION. WE ALSO 
HAVE THE OTHER PARTY WHO SAID AT

14:07:52.512 --> 14:07:57.647
NO TIME DID THE UKRAINIANS FEEL 
ANY PRESSURE TO HAVE AN 

14:07:57.850 --> 14:08:03.944
INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW THAT NO 
INVESTIGATION OF BIDEN EVER TOOK

14:08:04.145 --> 14:08:06.738
PLACE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE 
AIDE WAS GIVEN TO UKRAINE.

14:08:11.252 --> 14:08:13.712
THEY NEVER KNEW IT WAS UNDER 
REVIEW. AID THE CAME IN THE FORM

14:08:13.908 --> 14:08:15.908
OF A JAVELIN THE MISSILES. NOT 
WHAT THE

14:08:19.979 --> 14:08:21.820
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GAVE WHICH 
WERE WELL WISHES AND BLANKETS. 

14:08:21.821 --> 14:08:24.392
THERE IS NO CASE FOR ABUSE OF 
POWER. OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS.

14:08:31.561 --> 14:08:33.810
THIS IS NOT RIGHT. ONLY WILL 
LENDERS HAVE BEEN SENT. THERE IS

14:08:34.558 --> 14:08:37.672
NO SUBPOENA. HOW THIS WORKS IS A
SUBPOENA IS ISSUED. THE 

14:08:37.874 --> 14:08:42.744
EXECUTIVE BRANCH EXERCISES THEIR
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. JUST LIKE 

14:08:42.947 --> 14:08:46.395
OBAMA DID. AND IN THE COURT 
DECIDES. THE COURTS HAVE NEVER 

14:08:46.796 --> 14:08:50.585
DECIDE THIS. WHERE IS 
OBSTRUCTION? IT DOESN'T EXIST

14:08:55.117 --> 14:08:57.615
. I WOULD DEFEND THIS EVERY 
SINGLE DAY. AS A JUDGE I WOULD 

14:08:57.817 --> 14:09:03.596
DO MISS IT DISMISSIVE FOR LACK 
OF MERIT. YOU CANNOT MAKE OUT 

14:09:03.798 --> 14:09:05.798
WHAT WE CALL

14:09:08.534 --> 14:09:11.329
A PRIME CASE. IT WOULD BE 
DISMISSED ON DAY ONE IN A 

14:09:11.531 --> 14:09:14.577
COURTROOM. I WILL TELL YOU WHICH
CASE I WOULD PROSECUTE. I WOULD 

14:09:14.784 --> 14:09:16.784
PROSECUTE

14:09:21.120 --> 14:09:23.186
SHIFT FOR ABUSE OF POWER. HOW 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU 

14:09:23.385 --> 14:09:25.385
SUBPOENAED PHONE RECORDS FROM A 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS. THAT HE 

14:09:25.477 --> 14:09:31.284
SINGLED OUT NUNEZ PHONE NUMBER 
AND LEAK THAT. THAT HE DUMPED 

14:09:31.686 --> 14:09:33.686
8000 PAGES ON THE

14:09:40.417 --> 14:09:42.550
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 48 HOURS 
BEFORE WE HAD A HEARING. THAT IS

14:09:42.748 --> 14:09:45.158
ABUSE OF POWER. AND THAT IS WHAT
I WOULD PROSECUTE EVERY DAY OF 

14:09:45.364 --> 14:09:48.345
THE WEEK. OBSTRUCTION. I WOULD 
PROSECUTE THE DEMOCRATS FOR 

14:09:48.551 --> 14:09:51.543
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. I HAD A
MOTION TO SUBPOENA THE 

14:09:51.835 --> 14:09:53.835
WHISTLEBLOWER.

14:09:56.466 --> 14:09:58.706
YOU CANNOT POINT TO ANY STATUTE.
THERE IS NO STATUTE GIVING THAT 

14:09:58.905 --> 14:10:04.085
WHISTLEBLOWER THE RIGHT TO BE 
ANONYMOUS. IT DOES NOT EXIST. NO

14:10:04.283 --> 14:10:06.780
MATTER WHAT YOU SAY. I HAD A 
MOTION TO SUBPOENA THE 

14:10:06.984 --> 14:10:10.294
WHISTLEBLOWER TWO WEEKS AGO. 
THAT WAS DENIED. I NEVER GOT MY 

14:10:10.494 --> 14:10:14.348
SUBPOENA. IT WAS DONE IN 
PARTISAN FASHION. THAT IS THE 

14:10:14.551 --> 14:10:17.788
OBSTRUCTION THAT I WOULD 
PROSECUTE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT

14:10:18.002 --> 14:10:22.804
IS A LEGAL ANALYSIS. THIS IS 
NOTHING MORE THAN A POLITICAL 

14:10:23.632 --> 14:10:25.632
HIT

14:10:27.137 --> 14:10:29.515
JOB. THANKS. I YIELD THE 
REMAINDER MY TIME. GENTLEMAN 

14:10:29.729 --> 14:10:31.729
YIELD THE BACK.

14:10:40.133 --> 14:10:41.765
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

14:10:41.766 --> 14:10:44.210
&gt;&gt; THE LADY IS WRECK NICE. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS

14:10:44.410 --> 14:10:46.410
IS NOT ABOUT DISAGREEMENTS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT

14:10:49.885 --> 14:10:51.885
POLICIES, PERSONALITIES , OR 
TWEETS. WE ARE NOT JUDGING THE 

14:10:52.032 --> 14:10:53.951
PRESIDENT HIMSELF. WE ARE 
JUDGING HIS ACTIONS. I 

14:10:53.952 --> 14:10:55.952
UNDERSTAND THAT HE

14:11:02.885 --> 14:11:04.930
RAN TO DISRUPT THE GOVERNMENT. 
MY PROBLEM IS THAT HE WENT 

14:11:05.133 --> 14:11:07.205
FURTHER BY ABUSING HIS POWER. HE
ENDANGERED OUR ELECTIONS IN OUR 

14:11:07.913 --> 14:11:12.707
NATIONAL SECURITY. HE REMAINS AN
ONGOING THREAT TO BOTH. HE IS 

14:11:13.005 --> 14:11:14.858
SHOWN A PATTERN OF INVITING 
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE AND TRYING 

14:11:14.859 --> 14:11:19.324
TO COVER IT UP. HE IS 
THREATENING TO DO IT AGAIN.

14:11:26.900 --> 14:11:29.401
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF LOOSE 
TALK ABOUT WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE

14:11:29.608 --> 14:11:31.868
OR DO NOT HAVE. THERE IS PLENTY 
OF DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THE 

14:11:32.068 --> 14:11:34.068
PRESENCE OF WRONGDOING. HIS JULY
25 CALL

14:11:39.298 --> 14:11:42.210
WHERE HE SAID TO THE PRESIDENT 
OF UKRAINE I WANT YOU TO DO US A

14:11:42.406 --> 14:11:43.804
FAVOR AND THEN REQUESTED 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIS 

14:11:43.805 --> 14:11:45.805
POLITICAL RIVAL IN A DEBUNKED 
CONSPIRACY THEORY.

14:11:49.453 --> 14:11:51.641
WE HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF HIS 
EMPLOYEES.

14:11:59.200 --> 14:12:01.530
ABOUT THE MAY 23 MEETING WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT SAID TALK TO RUDY 

14:12:01.728 --> 14:12:04.484
GIULIANI. WE HAVE TESTIMONY OF 
THREE FIRST-HAND WITNESSES TO 

14:12:04.684 --> 14:12:11.384
THE JULY 25 CALL.  THEY REPORTED
THE CALL TO THEIR SUPERIORS AND 

14:12:11.799 --> 14:12:13.665
LEGAL CANCEL. WE HAD THE 
TESTIMONY OF DAVID HOLMES 

14:12:13.666 --> 14:12:18.112
OVERHEAR THE PRESIDENT ASK IF 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY WAS

14:12:18.311 --> 14:12:21.951
GOING TO DO THE INVESTIGATION. 
WE HAVE THE PRESENCE OF MANY 

14:12:22.710 --> 14:12:28.196
PUBLIC STATEMENTS. INCLUDING THE
ONE WHERE UKRAINE AND CHINA 

14:12:29.007 --> 14:12:31.007
SHOULD INVESTIGATE.

14:12:33.754 --> 14:12:38.759
THEY SAID THAT WE HAD SOME 
DIRECT EVIDENCE ON THE MAY 23 

14:12:38.966 --> 14:12:40.966
MEETING.

14:12:44.255 --> 14:12:49.181
THE SECONDHAND ACCOUNT IS ALSO 
EXTENSIVELY CORROBORATED. THEY 

14:12:49.943 --> 14:12:53.177
BOTH TESTIFIED THAT

14:12:57.711 --> 14:13:00.204
TRUMPS HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO
QUID PRO QUO. BUT THAT PRESIDENT

14:13:00.406 --> 14:13:02.945
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY HAD TO GO TO 
THE MICROPHONE AND ANNOUNCE 

14:13:03.201 --> 14:13:06.452
INVESTIGATIONS. THAT IS GIVING 
WITH ONE HAND AND TAKEN AWAY 

14:13:06.853 --> 14:13:09.654
WITH THE OTHER. HE TESTIFIED 
THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO DISPUTE

14:13:10.516 --> 14:13:14.576
TAYLOR'S AND MORRISON'S 
TESTIMONY. THERE IS A 

14:13:14.783 --> 14:13:19.664
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. THERE 
WAS NO EXPLANATION GIVEN FOR THE

14:13:19.865 --> 14:13:24.531
PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO WITHHOLD
MILITARY AID THAT HAD BIPARTISAN

14:13:24.732 --> 14:13:26.732
SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS. THAT DID 
NOT COME UNTIL AFTER THE 

14:13:26.790 --> 14:13:30.830
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WERE 
FILED. THE UNIFORM CONSENSUS OF 

14:13:31.581 --> 14:13:35.241
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND WHITE 
HOUSE

14:13:38.953 --> 14:13:40.876
WITNESSES IS THAT THE AGE 
SHOULD'VE BEEN RELEASED. GIVEN 

14:13:40.877 --> 14:13:45.250
THESE FACTS THE ONLY LOGICAL 
EXPLANATION AS WAS CONCLUDED IS 

14:13:45.650 --> 14:13:48.316
THE AIDE WAS BEING USED TO 
LEVERAGE PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT 

14:13:49.059 --> 14:13:55.020
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. AT THE END 
OF THE DAY. THE EVIDENCE IS 

14:13:55.222 --> 14:13:57.222
OVERWHELMING AND INDISPUTABLE.

14:14:03.533 --> 14:14:05.361
RUDY GIULIANI PUSHED UKRAINE TO 
INVESTIGATE HIS POLITICAL RIVAL 

14:14:05.362 --> 14:14:07.362
IN A DEBUNKED CONSPIRACY THEORY.

14:14:12.466 --> 14:14:14.787
HIS EFFORTS HAD NOTHING TO DO 
WITH U.S. POLICY AND WERE TAKEN 

14:14:14.992 --> 14:14:16.815
ON THE PRESIDENT'S BEHALF AND 
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE. 

14:14:16.816 --> 14:14:18.461
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DIRECTED 
U.S. OFFICIALS AND PRESIDENT 

14:14:18.462 --> 14:14:20.739
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY TO WORK WITH 
RUDY GIULIANI. HE ORDERED THE 

14:14:20.972 --> 14:14:25.872
CRITICAL MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE
BE WITHHELD. UKRAINE OFFICIALS 

14:14:26.074 --> 14:14:28.114
WERE INFORMED THAT THE AID WOULD
NOT BE RELEASED UNLESS PRESIDENT

14:14:28.323 --> 14:14:32.184
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY ANNOUNCED A 
INVESTIGATION. PRESIDENT DONALD 

14:14:32.386 --> 14:14:36.098
TRUMP REFUSED TO RELEASE THE 
AIDE UNTIL PRESSURE WAS EXPOSED.

14:14:36.638 --> 14:14:40.224
TRUMPS HE REFUSED TO ARRANGE A 
MEETING

14:14:43.539 --> 14:14:45.539
. AND THEY ADVISED UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS THAT IT WOULD BE 

14:14:45.615 --> 14:14:49.638
SCHEDULED AFTER PRESIDENT 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY COMMITTED TO 

14:14:50.387 --> 14:14:54.355
THE INVESTIGATIONS. PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP IGNORED THE 

14:14:54.565 --> 14:14:56.565
ANTICORRUPTION TALKING POINTS. 
AND ASKED PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 

14:14:56.798 --> 14:14:59.725
ZELENSKY TO INVESTIGATE

14:15:03.992 --> 14:15:10.302
JOE BIDEN. AND IT STONEWALLED 
CONGRESS AND THEIR 

14:15:10.506 --> 14:15:12.736
INVESTIGATION. WHAT MORE

14:15:16.273 --> 14:15:19.122
CAN YOU ASK FOR? WE HAVE A 
MISSION FROM THE PRESIDENT, 

14:15:19.523 --> 14:15:21.523
CORROBORATION FROM PEOPLE HE HAS
APPOINTED.

14:15:24.607 --> 14:15:27.267
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS 
STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND IF 

14:15:27.565 --> 14:15:29.591
YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENED HERE. WITHOUT I YIELD 

14:15:29.790 --> 14:15:35.174
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FLORIDA. IS
SHE HERE? 

14:15:35.175 --> 14:15:42.423
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. TWO SECONDS. 
&gt;&gt; THE TIME HAS EXPIRED.

14:15:49.794 --> 14:15:51.794
FOR WEEKS MY

14:15:54.460 --> 14:15:56.850
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES TALKED 
ABOUT QUID PRO QUO.  AND THEN 

14:15:57.056 --> 14:16:01.318
BRIBERY. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. 
BOTH

14:16:04.826 --> 14:16:06.692
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY AND
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT

14:16:06.693 --> 14:16:11.860
THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. NO VICTIM
. THE AIDE WAS RELEASED AND 

14:16:12.071 --> 14:16:14.071
THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION

14:16:19.247 --> 14:16:21.771
. THERE WAS NO WHISTLEBLOWER AND
THERE WAS NO ADAM SCHIFF. WE ARE

14:16:21.971 --> 14:16:26.562
LEFT WITH ABUSE OF POWER AND 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. WHATEVER

14:16:26.763 --> 14:16:33.874
THE MAJORITY WANTS IT TO BE. IF 
YOU CANNOT PROVE IT I GUESS YOU 

14:16:34.078 --> 14:16:36.927
WILL USE ALL OF IT. SO WHY NOT 
EXPAND IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO 

14:16:37.144 --> 14:16:39.144
WHERE IT ALL STARTED.

14:16:46.465 --> 14:16:48.465
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.

14:16:53.779 --> 14:16:58.599
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A 
LEGISLATIVE A DRIVE-BY. MORE 

14:16:58.800 --> 14:17:00.800
ACCURATELY

14:17:07.383 --> 14:17:09.507
THE MAJORITY'S ATTEMPT TO RETURN
TO THE SCENE OF A NON-CRIME. 

14:17:09.705 --> 14:17:12.085
AFTER TWO YEARS, 19 LAWYERS, 40 
AGENTS , 500 WARNS, 2200 

14:17:12.302 --> 14:17:16.318
SUBPOENAS, AND $30 MILLION. 
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN 

14:17:16.731 --> 14:17:19.504
LET AGO. HERE IS A REMINDER. THE
INVESTIGATION DID NOT ESTABLISH 

14:17:19.782 --> 14:17:23.654
THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
COORDINATED WITH THE RUSSIAN 

14:17:23.852 --> 14:17:31.562
GOVERNMENT IN THEIR ELECTION 
ACTIVITIES. MUELLER REPORT PAGE 

14:17:31.964 --> 14:17:35.971
2. THIS HAS BEEN A FOREGONE 
CONCLUSION SINCE THE DEMOCRATS

14:17:42.732 --> 14:17:44.783
WON THE MAJORITY. THIS IS NEVER 
BEEN ABOUT FACTS OR FAIRNESS. 

14:17:44.987 --> 14:17:47.436
HERE IS WHERE WE ARE, WHERE WE 
WERE ALWAYS GOING TO BE. A 

14:17:47.640 --> 14:17:49.640
PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT THAT WILL 
FAIL IN THE SENATE. WITHOUT I 

14:17:50.194 --> 14:17:52.194
YIELD BACK. BUT THE GENTLEMAN 
YIELD BACK.

14:17:59.389 --> 14:18:04.837
&gt;&gt; I HAVE LISTENED CAREFULLY TO 
THIS VERY LONG DEBATE THIS 

14:18:05.037 --> 14:18:12.807
EVENING AND THROUGHOUT THE LAST 
TWO WEEKS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

14:18:13.209 --> 14:18:15.209
LOOK AT THE

14:18:18.694 --> 14:18:23.373
FOUNDATION OF WHAT IT IS WE ARE 
DOING HERE. THE FOUNDERS OF NEW 

14:18:23.774 --> 14:18:29.790
THAT THE POWER GIVEN TO THE 
PRESIDENT NEEDED TO HAVE THE 

14:18:30.001 --> 14:18:35.359
CAPACITY TO BE CURVED IN THE 
CASE OF ABUSE. THE FRAMERS OF 

14:18:35.760 --> 14:18:41.649
THE CONSTITUTION CONSCIOUSLY 
ADOPTED A PARTICULAR PHRASE TO 

14:18:42.397 --> 14:18:46.050
HELP DEFINE THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL.

14:18:49.980 --> 14:18:54.457
THE CONTENT OF THE PHRASE HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS IS 

14:18:54.659 --> 14:18:59.732
RELATED TO WHAT THE FRAMERS KNEW
ABOUT THE ENGLISH PROJECT. A 

14:19:00.132 --> 14:19:04.756
BROAD SWEEP OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
HISTORY. AND THE VITAL ROLE THAT

14:19:06.366 --> 14:19:14.498
IMPEACHMENT PLAYED IN THE 
CONTROL OF ABUSES OF JUDICIAL 

14:19:14.701 --> 14:19:16.701
POWER.

14:19:19.232 --> 14:19:23.905
WHEN YOU'RE COMING TO PRIVATE 
AFFAIRS IN CRIMINAL LAW. IT'S 

14:19:24.125 --> 14:19:28.786
POSSIBLE IN ADVANCE TO DEFINE 
WHAT YOU CANNOT DO. YOU CANNOT 

14:19:29.529 --> 14:19:34.018
STEAL MONEY, YOU CANNOT HIT THAT
PERSON.

14:19:45.231 --> 14:19:47.231
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER. YOU

14:19:47.308 --> 14:19:49.559
CANNOT DEFINE WHAT A BAD ACTOR 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE MIGHT DO. 

14:19:49.764 --> 14:19:51.872
THEREFORE YOU HAVE THE TERM HIGH
CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR.

14:20:00.459 --> 14:20:02.459
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IN THE 
SECOND ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT 

14:20:02.490 --> 14:20:06.362
AGAINST RICHARD NIXON WAS AN 
ARTICLE OF ABUSE OF POWER. 

14:20:06.573 --> 14:20:11.789
INCLUDING THE POWER VESTED 
SOLELY IN THE PRESIDENT TO AID 

14:20:12.010 --> 14:20:21.536
HIS POLITICAL ALLY, GAIN 
ADVANTAGES. HE USED HIS POWER

14:20:25.854 --> 14:20:30.924
. IT WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR HIS 
PERSONAL POLITICAL ADVANTAGE. 

14:20:31.338 --> 14:20:33.931
AND NOT A VALID POLITICAL 
OBJECTIVE. AGAIN

14:20:37.437 --> 14:20:41.700
THE POWERS WERE INCOMPATIBLE 
WITH OUR SYSTEM OF 

14:20:41.905 --> 14:20:43.905
CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND 
WARRANTED REMOVAL FROM OFFICE. 

14:20:44.140 --> 14:20:48.554
WE HAD A SITUATION SIMILAR HERE.
I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE 

14:20:48.781 --> 14:20:54.512
RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE IN OHIO. 
I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS A 

14:20:54.714 --> 14:20:58.955
TENDENCY IN THE COUNTRY THESE 
DAYS TO IMMEDIATELY THINK I DO 

14:20:59.170 --> 14:21:02.028
NOT LIKE THAT. LET'S GO TO 
IMPEACHMENT. THAT FRANKLY HAS 

14:21:02.785 --> 14:21:09.345
BEEN PREVALENT SINCE THE CLINTON
IMPEACHMENT. LYING UNDER OATH IS

14:21:10.097 --> 14:21:17.672
A CRIME. LYING ABOUT SEX IS A 
SHAME. NEITHER ONE INVOLVES THE 

14:21:17.881 --> 14:21:22.700
USE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS. THE 
USE OF IMPEACHMENT IN THAT 

14:21:22.995 --> 14:21:24.995
INSTANCE

14:21:27.622 --> 14:21:30.207
IN THE PROPER WAY WAS NEVER THE 
ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER.

14:21:34.156 --> 14:21:37.153
PUT IN THE MIND THAT THIS IS A 
TOOL TO BE USED ABOUT 

14:21:37.358 --> 14:21:40.990
DISAGREEMENTS OF POLITICAL 
POLICY. I VOTED AGAINST THE IRAQ

14:21:41.188 --> 14:21:45.746
WAR. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT WE 
SHOULD HAVE ARTICLES OF 

14:21:45.948 --> 14:21:49.951
IMPEACHMENT ABOUT THAT. THAT DID
NOT UNDERCUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

14:21:50.150 --> 14:21:55.885
ORDER. CONGRESS VOTED. IT WAS A 
MISTAKE. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND 

14:21:56.086 --> 14:21:59.952
THE CONGRESS TOGETHER. IT WAS 
NOT THE PRESIDENT USURPING THE 

14:22:00.171 --> 14:22:03.548
POWERS OF ANOTHER BRANCH OF 
GOVERNMENT. HERE WE HAVE A 

14:22:03.748 --> 14:22:05.748
SITUATION THAT IS SO OBVIOUS.

14:22:14.572 --> 14:22:16.711
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACTS. IT'S 
INCONCEIVABLE. THE THINGS I'VE 

14:22:16.912 --> 14:22:19.396
HEARD TODAY ARE STUNNING TO ME. 
THAT YOU COULD REACH A 

14:22:19.601 --> 14:22:21.835
CONCLUSION AS A DEFENSE COUNSEL.
GRASPING AT STRAWS. THE 

14:22:22.041 --> 14:22:27.394
PRESIDENT MISUSED HIS 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO GAIN A 

14:22:28.113 --> 14:22:33.881
PERSONAL BENEFIT TO THE 
DETRIMENT OF THE INTEREST OF THE

14:22:34.092 --> 14:22:37.527
UNITED STATES. IT WAS AN ABUSE 
OF POWER THAT HARMED US, AND IT 

14:22:37.736 --> 14:22:41.178
IS ONGOING. IT IS A THREAT TO 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. IT 

14:22:41.381 --> 14:22:46.286
MEETS THE DEFINITION OF HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. IT IS 

14:22:46.481 --> 14:22:48.481
ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER

14:22:54.186 --> 14:22:56.421
. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO 
USE THE TOOL THAT OUR FOUNDERS 

14:22:56.622 --> 14:22:58.799
GAVE US IN THE CONSTITUTION TO 
PRESERVE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL 

14:22:58.999 --> 14:23:03.455
ORDER. WE MUST IMPEACH. I YIELD 
BACK. BUT THE GENTLE LADY YIELD 

14:23:03.659 --> 14:23:05.693
BACK. WHO SEEKS RECOGNITION?

14:23:09.204 --> 14:23:12.203
FOR WHAT PURPOSE? BUT TO STRIKE 
THE LAST WORD. 

14:23:12.204 --> 14:23:19.772
&gt;&gt; COMMENTS ABOUT PRESIDENT 
CLINTON'S ACTIONS. HE LIED UNDER

14:23:19.985 --> 14:23:24.662
OATH, THAT'S PERJURY AND A 
CRIME. I UNDERSTAND THE COMMENT 

14:23:24.863 --> 14:23:29.852
THAT HE WAS NOT ACTING IN HIS 
OFFICIAL CAPACITY. THAT WOULD 

14:23:30.061 --> 14:23:39.501
SET BACK THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. 
HAVING SEX WITH AN EMPLOYEE THAT

14:23:39.705 --> 14:23:42.303
IS AT MUCH YOUNGER WHEN YOU'RE 
PRESENT A NINE STATES. THAT

14:23:47.014 --> 14:23:49.076
WAS NOT IN HIS OFFICIAL 
CAPACITY? NO MATTER HOW LONG WE 

14:23:49.281 --> 14:23:51.428
SPENT TODAY, TONIGHT, TOMORROW. 
IT DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR THE FACT 

14:23:51.626 --> 14:23:55.690
THAT WE DID NOT HAVE FACT 
WITNESSES. THIS REMINDS ME 

14:23:55.894 --> 14:24:03.467
HISTORICALLY OF THE TRIAL OF 
SOCRATES. HE WAS CONVICTED OF A 

14:24:03.670 --> 14:24:07.950
JURY OF 501 PEOPLE BECAUSE HE 
WAS ARROGANT. IF YOU WANT TO TRY

14:24:08.152 --> 14:24:10.152
DONALD TRUMP FOR BEING

14:24:14.228 --> 14:24:16.296
ARROGANT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS VOTE WITH YOU ON 

14:24:16.496 --> 14:24:18.957
THAT. HE IS ARROGANT AND HAS A 
LOT TO BE ARROGANT ABOUT. THAT 

14:24:19.163 --> 14:24:23.097
IS NOT A CRIME, IT'S NOT A HIGH 
CRIME, AND IT CERTAINLY IS NOT A

14:24:23.306 --> 14:24:29.259
MISDEMEANOR. IT'S BOTHERSOME TO 
PEOPLE. SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT. 

14:24:29.660 --> 14:24:34.693
THAT IS NOT WHAT IMPEACHMENT IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. TO HAVE A 

14:24:34.996 --> 14:24:37.329
TRIAL WITH

14:24:41.845 --> 14:24:43.845
FEW HEARSAY GOSSIP MONGERING 
WITNESSES COMING INTO A

14:24:47.743 --> 14:24:49.743
STAR CHAMBER AND SECRETE THEIR 
TESTIMONIES OF THE PEOPLE CAN'T 

14:24:49.867 --> 14:24:52.558
SEE OR HEAR THEM. BUT WE HAVE 
ADAM SCHIFF PUT IT TOGETHER

14:24:57.696 --> 14:25:00.264
IN A BIG REPORT AND WE RECEIVED 
THE REPORT. DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME

14:25:00.893 --> 14:25:02.893
TO REPUTED

14:25:04.745 --> 14:25:07.995
. THIS IS

14:25:12.337 --> 14:25:14.706
A STALL IN PROCEEDING. THAT'S 
HOW WORKED UNDER STALIN. YOU 

14:25:14.909 --> 14:25:16.909
DIDN'T

14:25:18.425 --> 14:25:22.715
GET TO FIND OUT WHO THE 
WITNESSES WERE. YOU HAVE PEOPLE 

14:25:22.918 --> 14:25:24.918
COMING IN AND GIVING APPEARANCE.

14:25:33.072 --> 14:25:35.072
WE ARE WELL EDUCATED, AND THAT 
IS FINE.

14:25:40.385 --> 14:25:44.652
GO TO LAW SCHOOL. WHEN YOU HATE 
A PERSON LIKE THOSE WITNESSES DO

14:25:44.862 --> 14:25:47.911
WITH THE TRUMP. YOU CAN COME IN 
AND MISREPRESENT FACTS AND USE 

14:25:48.128 --> 14:25:50.128
THOSE TO BASE YOUR OPINIONS ON.

14:25:53.174 --> 14:25:55.174
THIS IS STARTED BEFORE MUELLER.

14:25:58.460 --> 14:26:02.932
IT STARTED WITH CARTER PAGE. HE 
WORKED FOR THE CIA TO HELP THEM 

14:26:03.134 --> 14:26:05.134
AGAINST THE RUSSIANS.

14:26:13.898 --> 14:26:16.246
THEY LIED TO THE COURT AND SAY 
OH HE WORKED WITH RUSSIANS. 

14:26:16.445 --> 14:26:18.933
MISREPRESENTED WHO HE IS, WHAT 
HE DID AND WHAT A PATRIOT WAS IN

14:26:19.136 --> 14:26:21.136
THE GET A WARRANT.

14:26:24.454 --> 14:26:26.981
AND THEN AS TIME GOES ON THEY 
LIE ABOUT. WHERE DOES THIS COME 

14:26:27.180 --> 14:26:32.136
FROM? IT CAME FROM HILLARY 
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. THEY HIRED

14:26:36.652 --> 14:26:39.236
A FOREIGNER TO AFFECT OUR 
ELECTIONS. AND THEY WORKED WITH 

14:26:39.440 --> 14:26:41.440
AN AUSTRALIAN, ITALIAN

14:26:46.410 --> 14:26:48.410
. CHRISTOPHER STEELE ADMITTED 
THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO GET ME 

14:26:48.568 --> 14:26:51.693
THAT INFORMATION MAY HAVE BEEN 
RUSSIAN. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN 

14:26:52.105 --> 14:26:54.321
UKRAINIAN. THE MAJORITY DOESN'T 
WANT US TO GET THERE.

14:27:03.071 --> 14:27:05.120
THE TOP PEOPLE IN THE FBI AND 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

14:27:05.863 --> 14:27:10.190
PERVERTED JUSTICE BECAUSE THEY 
DID NOT LIKE THE GUY THAT MADE 

14:27:10.403 --> 14:27:12.463
GET ELECTED. THEY DID EVERYTHING
THEY COULD. THEY USED ALL THE 

14:27:13.156 --> 14:27:16.885
FOREIGN RESOURCES TO CHANGE THE 
OUTCOME OF THE 2016 ELECTION. 

14:27:17.092 --> 14:27:20.901
WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK THEY CAME 
FORWARD WITH IMPEACHMENT.

14:27:24.811 --> 14:27:27.322
IT WASN'T LET'S PROJECT WHAT WE 
DID ON THE TRUMP. IT TURNED OUT 

14:27:27.545 --> 14:27:32.468
HE DIDN'T DO THAT. AND AS MUCH 
AS MUELLER AND WISEMAN HATED 

14:27:32.668 --> 14:27:34.668
TRUMP

14:27:37.194 --> 14:27:39.194
THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING TO 
USE AGAINST PRESIDENT DONALD 

14:27:39.229 --> 14:27:41.595
TRUMP. SO WE HAD TO DROP THE 
RUSSIAN COLLUSION, TREASON, 

14:27:41.798 --> 14:27:43.798
OBSTRUCTION

14:27:49.793 --> 14:27:51.917
. IT'S NOT OBSTRUCTION OF 
JUSTICE WHEN YOU KNOW YOU ARE 

14:27:52.120 --> 14:27:54.350
INNOCENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE IS TRYING TO SET YOU UP.

14:27:54.548 --> 14:27:56.762
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPOSE THE 
TRUTH. IT WAS OTHERS THAT WERE 

14:27:56.966 --> 14:27:58.966
OBSTRUCTING THE TRUE JUSTICE.

14:28:03.799 --> 14:28:05.799
DENMAN WAS NO HERO.

14:28:09.695 --> 14:28:15.579
PRAY FOR MERCY. WE CANNOT AFFORD
JUSTICE OR THE COUNTRY ENDS. 

14:28:16.531 --> 14:28:21.878
&gt;&gt; DENMAN YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt; THE LADY IS RECKLESS. 

14:28:21.879 --> 14:28:29.600
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN. FIVE MORE 
MINUTES IN A VERY LONG DAY. WHEN

14:28:29.808 --> 14:28:33.686
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER SIDE 
PRESENTED IN DEFENSE OF THE 

14:28:33.893 --> 14:28:39.162
PRESENT. WHAT WE GET? NOTHING. 
NONE OF YOU WILL DEFEND THE 

14:28:39.921 --> 14:28:44.243
PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS. BECAUSE YOU
CANNOT DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE. 

14:28:44.456 --> 14:28:49.472
YOU JUST CANNOT. EVEN IF YOU 
LIKE HIM AND SUPPORT HIS ACTIONS

14:28:49.880 --> 14:28:56.728
, YOU WILL NOT DEFEND WHAT HE 
DID. IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE. IT'S 

14:28:56.939 --> 14:29:01.296
NOT COMPLICATED AT ALL. HE 
OFFERED OFFICIAL ACTS IN 

14:29:01.510 --> 14:29:03.510
EXCHANGE FOR POLITICAL

14:29:08.009 --> 14:29:10.450
FAVOR. HE IS A CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER TO DO IT AGAIN. IGNORE 

14:29:10.652 --> 14:29:13.145
THE POWER THE PEOPLE AND HE WILL
DO IT AGAIN. IT'S REALLY JUST 

14:29:13.829 --> 14:29:21.417
THAT SIMPLE. THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SHOWN AS HIS PATTERN OF CONDUCT.

14:29:21.622 --> 14:29:23.622
HE WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT HE WILL

14:29:28.312 --> 14:29:30.454
CONTINUE TO CORRUPT THE 2020 
ELECTION BY ABUSE OF POWER. WE 

14:29:30.655 --> 14:29:33.813
MUST ACT WITH A SENSE OF 
EMERGENCY TO PROTECT OUR 

14:29:34.021 --> 14:29:36.860
DEMOCRACY AND DEFEND OUR 
CONSTITUTION. THE HOUSE OF VOTED

14:29:37.594 --> 14:29:42.952
TO IMPEACH 72 DAYS AFTER 
AUTHORIZING AN INQUIRY. IT HAS 

14:29:43.159 --> 14:29:47.413
BEEN 94 DAYS SINCE CONGRESS 
LAUNCHED THE INVESTIGATION INTO 

14:29:47.616 --> 14:29:49.616
THE PRESIDENT'S DEALINGS WITH 
UKRAINE.

14:29:54.313 --> 14:29:56.703
IMPEACHMENT IS A CHARGING 
DECISION. LIKE A GRAND JURY OR 

14:29:56.901 --> 14:29:58.937
PROSECUTOR. WE HAVE SEEN MORE 
THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE

14:30:06.717 --> 14:30:09.485
IT IS THE PRESIDENT WHO IS 
ABUSING HIS POWER. WHAT IS NOT 

14:30:09.696 --> 14:30:11.696
FAIR

14:30:13.419 --> 14:30:15.261
IS THE PRESIDENTS BLANKET 
REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS 

14:30:15.262 --> 14:30:18.946
INQUIRY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF 
HIDING THE FACTS FROM THE 

14:30:19.662 --> 14:30:23.906
AMERICAN PEOPLE. FEDERAL COURTS 
HAVE RULED THAT

14:30:28.640 --> 14:30:30.558
CONGRESS HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHT TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS AND 

14:30:30.559 --> 14:30:31.990
TESTIMONY FROM THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. ONE FEDERAL 

14:30:31.991 --> 14:30:37.577
COURT SAID THAT THE PRESENCE 
OBSTRUCTION IS A FARCE AND HE IS

14:30:38.327 --> 14:30:40.327
OPENLY STONEWALLING

14:30:43.877 --> 14:30:45.877
. HE IS A FIRST PRESENT IS 
ENGAGED IN WALL-TO-WALL 

14:30:45.929 --> 14:30:51.207
STONEWALLING. AN OUT RIGHT 
COVER-UP OF HIS OWN BEHAVIOR. HE

14:30:51.407 --> 14:30:54.041
HAS REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH ALL 
OF THE CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS 

14:30:54.443 --> 14:31:00.958
THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO UNCOVER
THE TRUTH OF HIS MISCONDUCT. 

14:31:01.359 --> 14:31:03.955
ENACTED NO OTHER CITIZEN CAN DO 
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. AS STATED 

14:31:04.165 --> 14:31:11.725
BEFORE , EVEN PRESIDENT NIXON 
SHARED DOCUMENTS AND ALLOWED 

14:31:12.126 --> 14:31:14.126
CURRENT AND FORMER AIDES TO 
TESTIFY AS PART OF THE 

14:31:14.719 --> 14:31:16.719
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

14:31:18.427 --> 14:31:21.063
THE COMMITTEE STILL RECOMMENDED 
AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT FOR 

14:31:21.275 --> 14:31:23.275
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

14:31:25.947 --> 14:31:27.994
LAST NIGHT I REMINDED US THAT 
THIS IS ABOUT PRESERVING AND 

14:31:28.198 --> 14:31:30.750
PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY FOR THE
LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS ACROSS THE

14:31:30.954 --> 14:31:36.890
NATION. THE DAY WILL KNOW WHAT 
IT MEANS TO MAKE A PROMISE, A 

14:31:37.097 --> 14:31:46.305
PLEDGE AND TO KEEP IT. DEMOCRACY
IS A GIFT THAT EACH GENERATION 

14:31:46.507 --> 14:31:51.801
GIVES TO THE NEXT. THAT IS WHY 
WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION, WE HAVE 

14:31:52.000 --> 14:31:56.997
TO MOVE FORWARD, AND WE MUST 
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. WITH THAT

14:31:57.211 --> 14:32:02.346
MR. CHAIRMAN I YIELD THE 
REMAINDER OF MY TIME TO MY 

14:32:02.542 --> 14:32:04.731
COLLEAGUE FROM FLORIDA. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.. I WANT TO

14:32:08.225 --> 14:32:11.219
ANSWER WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER. I 
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I WITH MY 

14:32:11.435 --> 14:32:13.435
COLLEAGUES THAT YOU SEE

14:32:16.556 --> 14:32:18.556
SYDNEY HERE. WE CAN COME TO

14:32:23.258 --> 14:32:25.258
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. WE CAME 
TO LOWER HEALTHCARE COST. WE 

14:32:25.826 --> 14:32:27.888
VOTED ON HR3

14:32:35.442 --> 14:32:37.886
TODAY. WE VOTED ON THE VOTING 
RIGHTS AMENDMENT ACT. WHICH MY 

14:32:38.089 --> 14:32:40.089
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES VOTED 
AGAINST.

14:32:43.972 --> 14:32:46.349
WE DO NOT WANT RUSSIA, UKRAINE ,
OR CHINA MAKING

14:32:50.473 --> 14:32:52.109
DECISIONS FOR US AND OUR 
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. THIS 

14:32:52.110 --> 14:32:56.987
PRESENT HAS COMMITTED THE 
HIGHEST CRIME BY ABUSING THE 

14:32:57.203 --> 14:33:00.624
POWER OF HIS OFFICE. AND 
INVITING FOR AN APPEARANCE IN 

14:33:00.838 --> 14:33:03.092
THE ELECTION. THAT IS WHY WE ARE
HERE TODAY. DO NOT CONFUSE 

14:33:03.330 --> 14:33:06.270
AMERICANS WITH FALSE CLAIMS.  
AND PUSHING DEBUNKED

14:33:10.375 --> 14:33:12.426
CONSPIRACY THEORIES. WE ARE HERE
TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE 

14:33:12.630 --> 14:33:17.692
TRUTH. I YIELD BACK. BUT GENTLE 
LADY YIELD BACK. WHO SEEKS 

14:33:18.094 --> 14:33:19.929
RECOGNITION ? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE THE 

14:33:19.930 --> 14:33:21.930
LAST WORD. 
&gt;&gt;

14:33:25.209 --> 14:33:27.246
MR. CHAIRMAN I HAVE LOST TRACK 
OF THE NUMBER OF NEWSPAPER 

14:33:27.459 --> 14:33:29.826
ARTICLES THAT HAVE BEEN ENTERED 
INTO THE RECORD IN THESE

14:33:36.790 --> 14:33:38.944
PROCEEDINGS. IT IS A TELLING 
COMMENTARY ON THE QUALITY OF THE

14:33:39.153 --> 14:33:41.153
CASE THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS 
RELYING ON. TO SUPPORT THE 

14:33:41.227 --> 14:33:43.227
EXERCISE OF ONE OF THE MOST 
PROFOUND ACTIONS WE CAN 

14:33:43.260 --> 14:33:44.911
UNDERTAKE. IT UNDERSCORES THE 
DERELICTION OF DUTY DRAFTING 

14:33:44.912 --> 14:33:46.912
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WITHOUT 
A

14:33:51.009 --> 14:33:52.854
SINGLE FACT OR HEARING. 
VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE RECORD IS 

14:33:52.855 --> 14:33:54.855
THE SHIFT REPORT AND NEWSPAPER 
CLIPPINGS. AS I REMINDED THE 

14:33:54.900 --> 14:33:58.114
COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. THE REPORT 
WAS CONTRADICTED BY THE 

14:33:58.317 --> 14:34:00.317
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT.

14:34:02.779 --> 14:34:05.283
MR. SHIFTS AT WORK IS NOT WHAT 
YOU CAN CALL THE GOLD STANDARD 

14:34:05.981 --> 14:34:13.144
OF ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR 
PRECISE ANALYSIS. NEWSPAPER 

14:34:13.354 --> 14:34:15.544
CLIPPINGS ARE NOT THE SOLID 
FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS 

14:34:16.327 --> 14:34:21.424
WIELDING SUCH POWER. IMPEACHMENT
SHOULD BE MADE OF STERN STUFF.

14:34:33.473 --> 14:34:35.473
BY NULLIFYING A NATIONAL 
ELECTION IS AWAITING MATTER.

14:34:39.361 --> 14:34:41.805
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU 
SHOULD HAVE A RECORD THE FACT 

14:34:42.009 --> 14:34:46.077
THAT NO REASONABLE PERSON CAN 
DENY. A ONE-SIDED REPORT FROM 

14:34:46.280 --> 14:34:48.280
ADAM SCHIFF AND A NEWSPAPER 
SCRAPBOOK IS

14:34:51.960 --> 14:34:53.635
THE FOUNDATION OF IMPEACHMENT 
THAT WILL CRUMBLE AND 

14:34:53.636 --> 14:34:55.636
DISINTEGRATE BEFORE THE SENATE 
FINISHES THE CONSIDERATION. 

14:34:55.829 --> 14:35:01.518
ABUSE OF POWER IS THE VAGUE AND 
EXPANSIVE GROUND THAT THE 

14:35:02.266 --> 14:35:04.266
FOUNDERS CONSIDERED

14:35:09.425 --> 14:35:11.467
AND REJECTED IN FAVOR OF THE 
NARROW GROUND OF TREASON , 

14:35:11.670 --> 14:35:13.291
BRIBERY, OR OTHER HIGH CRIMES 
AND MISDEMEANORS. UNLAWFUL 

14:35:13.292 --> 14:35:17.301
EXERCISE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL'S 
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY IS NOT 

14:35:17.499 --> 14:35:21.151
IMPEACHABLE. THE MOMENT WE MAKE 
IT SO THE PRESENT BECOMES A

14:35:24.657 --> 14:35:26.657
SERVANT OF CONGRESS AND THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS THAT IS 

14:35:26.739 --> 14:35:31.506
PROTECTED OUR FREEDOM WILL BE 
GREATLY DIMINISHED. THE PRESENCE

14:35:31.712 --> 14:35:36.258
ASSERTION OF THE 
LONG-ESTABLISHED BOUNDARIES IS 

14:35:36.464 --> 14:35:41.748
ALSO NOT IMPEACHABLE. ONCE WE 
MAKE IT SO WE CLEARLY DIMINISHED

14:35:41.948 --> 14:35:45.144
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE 
OVERWRITE

14:35:52.508 --> 14:35:54.508
HYPERBOLE SHOULD WARN US THAT WE
ARE STRAYING INTO PARTISAN 

14:35:54.572 --> 14:35:56.463
MOTIVES THAT SHOULD NOT ANIMATE 
THE IMPEACHMENT POWER OF 

14:35:56.464 --> 14:36:03.200
CONGRESS. OPINION HAS NOT 
COALESCED AROUND THIS ACT.

14:36:07.334 --> 14:36:09.716
THAT WE WOULD FURTHER DIVIDE AND
ALIENATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

14:36:18.101 --> 14:36:22.570
YOU SHOULD CLEARLY ARTICULATE 
AND SUPPORT IT WITH ADMISSIBLE 

14:36:22.776 --> 14:36:26.779
EVIDENCE AND PUT IT IN THE 
ARTICLES OTHERWISE

14:36:36.783 --> 14:36:38.783
THIS IS A MATTER THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION RESERVES TO THE 

14:36:38.865 --> 14:36:41.865
VOTERS AND NOT THE CONGRESS. BY 
DENYING THE WITNESSES REQUESTED 

14:36:42.086 --> 14:36:46.833
BY THE MINORITY YOU BLIGHTED THE
COMMITTEE FROM GETTING THE WHOLE

14:36:47.039 --> 14:36:49.039
STORY. IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT OF 
YOUR CASE YOU SHOULD HAVE 

14:36:49.097 --> 14:36:51.563
NOTHING TO FEAR FROM WHAT A FULL
HEARING OF TESTIMONY WOULD 

14:36:51.762 --> 14:36:56.989
OFFER. THE MOST CHILLING 
OBSERVATION I HAVE HEARD IS THAT

14:36:57.198 --> 14:36:59.450
WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE WE ARE 
NOT RESTRICTED BY THE DEPARTMENT

14:37:00.092 --> 14:37:05.024
OF JUSTICE. THE SAME RIGHTS OF 
DUE PROCESS IN THE SAME FIDELITY

14:37:05.225 --> 14:37:08.114
OF THE CONSTITUTION IS REQUIRED 
OF US. THE IMPEACHMENT OF ANDREW

14:37:08.318 --> 14:37:11.365
JOHNSON, CONGRESS MADE MANY OF 
THE SAME MISTAKES THAT WE ARE 

14:37:11.963 --> 14:37:13.963
MAKING TONIGHT. I URGE MY 
COLLEAGUES TO

14:37:18.248 --> 14:37:20.248
CAREFULLY CONSIDER HOW HISTORY 
HAS ADJUDGED THEM AND HOW IT 

14:37:20.317 --> 14:37:22.317
WILL JUDGE US. I YIELD BACK.

14:37:32.266 --> 14:37:34.266
STRIKE THAT GENTLE LADY IS WRECK
NICE.

14:37:39.380 --> 14:37:41.951
BUT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SAME
EXCUSES FOR THE PRESIDENTS 

14:37:42.270 --> 14:37:46.898
BEHAVIOR. THIS IS SUCH A GRAVE A
MOMENT THAT WE ARE IN. WE ARE 

14:37:47.099 --> 14:37:50.347
TALKING ABOUT THE HIGHEST 
CONSTITUTIONAL CRIMES, ABUSE OF 

14:37:50.548 --> 14:37:53.949
POWER AND OBSTRUCTION OF 
JUSTICE. LET'S REVIEW THE FACTS.

14:37:56.435 --> 14:37:58.470
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SAID 
THAT THIS IS ABOUT CORRUPTION. 

14:37:59.217 --> 14:38:05.178
ALL OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
AGENCIES ADVISORS, EVERYONE TOLD

14:38:05.380 --> 14:38:07.380
HIM THAT UKRAINE HAD

14:38:11.881 --> 14:38:13.621
PASSED ALL THE ANTICORRUPTION 
BENCHMARK. THE DEPARTMENT OF 

14:38:13.622 --> 14:38:17.164
DEFENSE SAID THAT UKRAINE PASSED
THEIR REVIEW ON ANTICORRUPTION 

14:38:17.565 --> 14:38:21.192
BENCHMARKS. AND THAT NO FURTHER 
POLICIES WERE NEEDED.

14:38:28.132 --> 14:38:30.366
TRUMPS HE WAS GIVEN TALKING 
POINTS BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

14:38:31.125 --> 14:38:35.981
COUNCIL. THAT SPECIFICALLY SAID 
TO SAY THESE THINGS ABOUT 

14:38:36.184 --> 14:38:38.184
CORRUPTION.

14:38:42.950 --> 14:38:45.074
TRUMPS HE DID NOT MENTION 
CORRUPTION. HE DID NOT USE THE 

14:38:45.298 --> 14:38:50.066
TALKING POINTS THAT HE WAS GIVEN
THE ONLY NAMES THAT HE MENTIONED

14:38:50.265 --> 14:38:52.265
WERE JOE AND HUNTER BIDEN.

14:38:59.816 --> 14:39:02.409
IT WAS ALL ABOUT TRUMPS CONCERNS
ABOUT BURDEN SHARING WITH OUR 

14:39:02.614 --> 14:39:04.614
ALLIES.

14:39:16.667 --> 14:39:18.707
THE INVESTOR TESTIFIED THAT HE 
WAS NEVER ASKED TO GO TO 

14:39:19.449 --> 14:39:21.449
EUROPEAN UNION

14:39:25.814 --> 14:39:33.267
. WHAT WAS GORDON SONDLAND TOLD 
TO CONVEY?

14:39:37.799 --> 14:39:39.799
THAT IT WOULD NOT INCUR UNLESS 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY 

14:39:40.183 --> 14:39:45.116
ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATION. HE SAID 
UNLESS PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 

14:39:45.324 --> 14:39:47.324
ZELENSKY ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATION 
THERE WOULD BE A STALEMATE OVER 

14:39:47.698 --> 14:39:50.544
THE AGE. WHAT WERE THOSE 
INVESTIGATIONS? THE 2016 

14:39:50.742 --> 14:39:54.415
ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND 
BURISMA. MEANING THE BIDENS.

14:40:03.609 --> 14:40:09.103
TRUMPS HE HAD A LEGITIMATE 
REASON TO INVESTIGATE JOE BIDEN.

14:40:09.322 --> 14:40:17.360
IT MAKES NO SENSE. THE FACTS ARE
THAT THAT INVESTIGATION OF

14:40:20.260 --> 14:40:22.260
BIDEN AND BURISMA WENT BACK TO 
2015.

14:40:27.375 --> 14:40:32.878
HE CLEARLY DID NOT HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH THE ISSUES OF 2015.

14:40:33.083 --> 14:40:36.921
HE HAD TWO OPPORTUNITIES TO 
RELEASE EIGHT AND HE DID. 

14:40:37.323 --> 14:40:39.915
SOMETHING CHANGE IN 2019. THE 
ONLY THING THAT CHANGED IS THAT

14:40:46.057 --> 14:40:48.010
JOE BIDEN STARTED BEATING 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE 

14:40:48.011 --> 14:40:50.011
POLLS. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID IT 

14:40:50.038 --> 14:40:55.404
DO US A FAVOR. WHO WAS THE S? HE
TOLD US EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT. 

14:40:55.618 --> 14:40:59.824
HE TOLD PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKY MEANT DEAL WITH RUDY 

14:41:00.025 --> 14:41:04.763
GIULIANI. TRUMPS PERSONAL 
ATTORNEY. WHO KNOWS WHAT IS 

14:41:05.516 --> 14:41:12.150
GOING ON. HE COULD'VE GONE 
THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS IF THE

14:41:12.354 --> 14:41:16.759
INVESTIGATION WASN'T LEGITIMATE.
HE COULD'VE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT

14:41:16.963 --> 14:41:19.647
OF JUSTICE TO INITIATE THE 
BIDENS. HE DIDN'T DO THAT

14:41:38.688 --> 14:41:43.573
THIS WAS IN ABOUT OFFICIAL 
POLICY. IT WASN'T ABOUT WHAT IS 

14:41:43.781 --> 14:41:45.781
RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

14:41:49.856 --> 14:41:53.521
EVERY WITNESS TESTIFIED TO THAT 
AS WELL. THIS WAS PERSONAL. IT 

14:41:53.721 --> 14:42:00.580
WAS ALL FOR PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP AND HIS POLITICAL GAIN. TO

14:42:00.779 --> 14:42:02.779
BENEFIT

14:42:12.406 --> 14:42:14.459
HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN. AND 
THAT IS WHY HE HAD HIS PERSONAL 

14:42:14.663 --> 14:42:16.703
ATTORNEY TO. HE ABUSED HIS 
POWER, HE ABUSE THE POWER THAT 

14:42:16.918 --> 14:42:19.132
THE PEOPLE ENTRUSTED IT TO HIM. 
HE ABUSED THE OFFICE. HE PLACED 

14:42:19.333 --> 14:42:21.333
OUR SAFETY, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
OF TAXPAYER MONEY

14:42:25.005 --> 14:42:32.520
AT RISK. HE CANNOT USE THE POWER
OF THE OFFICE. HE CANNOT USE IT 

14:42:32.923 --> 14:42:37.029
FOR HIMSELF. THAT IS THE 
GREATEST ABUSE OF POWER. HE HAS 

14:42:37.746 --> 14:42:42.422
LEFT US NO CHOICE BUT TO IMPEACH
HIM. I YIELD BACK.

14:42:50.191 --> 14:42:52.191
BUT THIS MORNING I BEGAN

14:42:55.673 --> 14:42:57.780
OUTLINING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF 
THE DAY. MOST OF US ARE 

14:42:57.978 --> 14:43:03.218
ATTORNEYS. IN THIS CASE WE ARE 
ALL CALLED TO SERVICE FINDERS ON

14:43:03.434 --> 14:43:05.478
THE FACT. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO 
CAREFULLY ANALYZE THE CLAIMS NOT

14:43:06.190 --> 14:43:08.190
AGAINST OUR PERSONAL 
PREFERENCES.

14:43:10.912 --> 14:43:14.963
WE'VE DONE THAT FOR THE PAST 12 
HOURS. IT IS TIME TO SUMMARIZE 

14:43:15.380 --> 14:43:20.662
OUR CASE. LITERALLY AT THE END 
OF THE DAY. THERE TWO SHORT 

14:43:20.863 --> 14:43:22.817
ARTICLES TO THE RESOLUTION 
BROUGHT BEFORE US. ABUSE OF 

14:43:22.818 --> 14:43:24.818
POWER AND OBSTRUCTION OF 
JUSTICE. LET'S REVIEW BOTH.

14:43:31.014 --> 14:43:33.321
SHOWING THAT PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP ENGAGED IN ANY SCHEME.

14:43:42.997 --> 14:43:45.092
OR HE INTENDED TO INFLUENCE THE 
2020 ELECTION. ALL THEY HAVE 

14:43:45.336 --> 14:43:47.198
ARGUED IS BASED ON HEARSAY, 
SPECULATION, AND CONJECTURE. THE

14:43:47.199 --> 14:43:49.199
TRUTH IS THERE'S NOT A SINGLE 
FACT WITNESS IT CAN PROVIDE 

14:43:49.393 --> 14:43:51.001
TESTIMONY TO SUPPORT THEIR 
PAPERTHIN CASE. WHICH IS 

14:43:51.002 --> 14:43:53.002
PRECISELY WHY WE BEEN GIVEN NO

14:43:57.034 --> 14:43:59.034
OPPORTUNITY FOR A FACT WITNESS 
OR MINORITY. THE EVIDENCE DOES 

14:43:59.075 --> 14:44:00.901
SHOW THAT TRUMPS HE HOLDS A 
DEEP-SEATED SKEPTICISM OF 

14:44:00.902 --> 14:44:02.902
UKRAINE DUE TO ITS

14:44:07.389 --> 14:44:09.022
HISTORY OF PERVASIVE CORRUPTION.
HIS ADMINISTRATION SOUGHT PROOF 

14:44:09.023 --> 14:44:10.698
THAT PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKY WAS A TRUE REFORMER. 

14:44:10.699 --> 14:44:13.288
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO
ENSURE THAT AMERICAN TAXPAYER 

14:44:13.688 --> 14:44:15.688
SECURITY WOULD NOT BE SQUANDERED
OVERSEAS

14:44:23.246 --> 14:44:25.246
BY THE THIRD MOST CORRUPTED 
NATION IN THE WORLD. THE 

14:44:25.270 --> 14:44:27.270
DISCUSSIONS WERE NEVER ABOUT 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN 2020. BUT 

14:44:27.320 --> 14:44:31.974
WHAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED IN 
2016. THE DEMOCRATS A SECOND 

14:44:32.178 --> 14:44:34.198
CLAIM IS THAT PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE BY 

14:44:34.412 --> 14:44:38.401
DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT
IN THE MODERN ERA HAS DONE.

14:44:48.015 --> 14:44:50.015
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF AN 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.

14:44:55.363 --> 14:44:57.371
THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE GONE 
TO FEDERAL COURT

14:45:07.949 --> 14:45:09.949
TO GET A SIMPLE ORDER COMPELLING
THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY 

14:45:10.057 --> 14:45:12.520
SUBPOENA. THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN 
DONE IN THE PAST. THEY DID NOT 

14:45:12.729 --> 14:45:14.950
HAVE TIME FOR THAT HERE. BECAUSE
THEY ARE TRYING TO MEET THEIR 

14:45:15.163 --> 14:45:17.231
OWN RECKLESS TIMELINE TO TAKE 
DOWN A PRESIDENT THAT THEY LOAD.

14:45:17.427 --> 14:45:19.771
THE REAL ABUSE OF POWER IS ON 
THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS. AS THEY 

14:45:20.292 --> 14:45:22.292
FEVERISHLY PURSUED THIS 
IMPEACHMENT 20 TIMES FASTER THAN

14:45:22.398 --> 14:45:24.398
THE IMPEACHMENT OF BILL CLINTON

14:45:26.845 --> 14:45:29.895
. ALONG THE WAY THEY HAVE 
STEAMROLLED OVER DUE PROCESS, 

14:45:30.100 --> 14:45:33.703
HOUSE RULES, AND THE FEDERAL 
RULES OF PROCEDURE. THEY HAVE

14:45:39.648 --> 14:45:40.968
IGNORED OR BLOCKED EVIDENCE, 
INTIMIDATED WITNESSES, 

14:45:40.969 --> 14:45:44.312
RESTRICTED REPUBLICAN LINES OF 
QUESTIONING, DENY WITNESSES , 

14:45:44.513 --> 14:45:49.594
RESTRICTED REPUBLICAN REVIEW OF 
EVIDENCE, AND VIOLATED PROPER 

14:45:49.996 --> 14:45:54.280
NOTICE THAT EVERY SINGLE STAGE. 
THE FOUNDERS WARNED AGAINST A 

14:45:54.479 --> 14:45:57.356
SINGLE PARTY IMPEACHMENT FOR 
GOOD REASON. THEY FEARED THAT IT

14:45:57.573 --> 14:45:59.573
WOULD BITTERLY DIVIDE OUR 
NATION.

14:46:05.449 --> 14:46:07.486
OUR CHAIRMAN NADLER GAVE A 
SPEECH ABOUT THAT 20 YEARS AGO 

14:46:07.695 --> 14:46:09.857
WHEN HE WAS DEPOSING BILL 
CLINTON. THE OBVIOUS TRUTH

14:46:15.402 --> 14:46:17.402
THAT LIBERAL COLLEAGUES HAVE 
BOWED TO IMPEACH THEM SINCE THE 

14:46:17.537 --> 14:46:19.538
DAY OF HIS ELECTION. THERE 
REASON THE DAY HAS CHANGED HALF 

14:46:19.752 --> 14:46:22.335
A DOZEN TIMES BUT THEY CAN NEVER
GET ANY TRACTION OR FAXED TO 

14:46:22.537 --> 14:46:24.537
JUSTIFY THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
AS THE NEXT ELECTION 2020 IS 

14:46:24.598 --> 14:46:26.598
DRAWING CLOSE. THEY MET

14:46:30.637 --> 14:46:32.492
SOMEWHERE AND CONVINCED THE 
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI THAT 

14:46:32.493 --> 14:46:34.743
THEY HAD TO PULL THE TRIGGER. 
THE PROBLEM IS THEY HAVE DONE 

14:46:34.937 --> 14:46:37.696
THAT , AND IN ALL THOSE HEARINGS
THEY COULDN'T UNCOVER A SINGLE

14:46:42.555 --> 14:46:49.081
REASON. THE RESULT IS WHAT THE 
EXPERT WITNESS TESTIFIED.

14:46:53.590 --> 14:46:55.590
I AM A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

14:46:59.691 --> 14:47:01.691
ATTORNEY BY PROFESSION. AND I'VE
ENJOYED THE DEBATE THAT WE'VE 

14:47:01.733 --> 14:47:05.122
HAD ON ARTICLE 2 SECTION 4. 
EVERYBODY CAN READ THE

14:47:10.660 --> 14:47:12.476
EXPRESS LANGUAGE. YOU NEED 
TREASON, BRIBERY, OR HIGH CRIME 

14:47:12.477 --> 14:47:14.477
OR MISDEMEANOR. NONE OF THAT 
EXISTS HERE.

14:47:18.779 --> 14:47:20.779
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. THOSE 
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT HOME 

14:47:20.915 --> 14:47:23.375
KNOW IT, OUR CONSTITUENTS OF 
NOTE , AND EVEN OUR FRIENDS ON 

14:47:23.577 --> 14:47:28.336
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM KNOW 
IT. MY GOOD FRIEND MR. COHEN 

14:47:28.537 --> 14:47:31.322
SAID HE'S PROUD TO BE A 
POLITICIAN. THIS IS A CALL FOR 

14:47:31.530 --> 14:47:33.530
POLITICIANS. THIS MOMENT CALLS 
FOR STATESMEN. THIS IMPEACHMENT 

14:47:33.642 --> 14:47:36.002
IS GOING TO FAIL AND THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO

14:47:42.143 --> 14:47:44.191
PAY A HEAVY POLITICAL PRICE FOR 
IT. THE PANDORA BOX THEY'VE 

14:47:44.390 --> 14:47:46.390
OPENED WILL DO IRREPARABLE 
DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT 

14:47:46.470 --> 14:47:49.336
IS A REAL TRAGEDY OF THE VOTE WE
ARE ABOUT TO TAKE. GOD HELP US. 

14:47:49.543 --> 14:47:51.543
I YIELD BACK.  

14:47:58.793 --> 14:48:01.498
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE WHILE AGO ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

14:48:01.696 --> 14:48:05.308
THE AISLE SAID THAT THE REASON 
WHY AID WAS WITHHELD WAS BECAUSE

14:48:05.511 --> 14:48:07.149
THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO 
INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION. THE IDEA

14:48:07.150 --> 14:48:09.150
THAT THE MOST

14:48:14.843 --> 14:48:16.680
CORRUPT PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE 
SEEN IN RECENT. WITHHELD 

14:48:16.681 --> 14:48:19.060
MILITARY AID BECAUSE HE WAS 
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION IS A 

14:48:19.265 --> 14:48:21.265
LUDICROUS.

14:48:25.612 --> 14:48:27.612
AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED 
OUT, BOTH CALLS THE PRESIDENT 

14:48:27.677 --> 14:48:29.517
DONALD TRUMP HAD WITH PRESIDENT 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. HE NEVER 

14:48:29.518 --> 14:48:30.964
MENTIONED CORRUPTION. THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEDDED 

14:48:30.965 --> 14:48:33.185
GIVING AID AND SAID IT WAS OKAY.
ONCE UPON A TIME PRESIDENT 

14:48:33.886 --> 14:48:37.191
DONALD TRUMP LOVED HIS A 
GENERALS. THIS TIME HE IGNORED 

14:48:37.401 --> 14:48:39.215
THEM. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
AUTHORIZED THE AID AND LOBBIED 

14:48:39.216 --> 14:48:41.216
THE WHITE HOUSE TO RELEASE THE 
EIGHT.

14:48:47.944 --> 14:48:49.776
STAFF AND THE OFFICE OF 
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET RESIGNED 

14:48:49.777 --> 14:48:52.049
BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT 
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WHY THE 

14:48:52.249 --> 14:48:54.249
AIDE WAS WITHHELD. THEY WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

14:48:54.805 --> 14:48:59.425
WAS DOING. SOME OF THEM CUT 
FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS TO DEAL 

14:48:59.622 --> 14:49:04.205
WITH CORRUPTION IN COMPANIES 
LIKE UKRAINE. THE MAN THAT IS SO

14:49:04.416 --> 14:49:08.462
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION HAS 
INTERESTING FRIENDS. AND HE HAS 

14:49:09.413 --> 14:49:11.413
ROMANCE

14:49:14.161 --> 14:49:20.463
WITH LEADERS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, 
TURKEY. WE KNOW HIS NUMBER ONE 

14:49:21.196 --> 14:49:23.196
PAL IS

14:49:25.530 --> 14:49:27.170
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN, 

14:49:27.171 --> 14:49:29.338
AND THE MEN AROUND HIM THAT WERE
INDICTED ,

14:49:35.679 --> 14:49:37.679
ARRESTED, INCARCERATED. MY 
MOTHER SAID IF YOU LAY DOWN WITH

14:49:37.741 --> 14:49:40.696
DOGS DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU 
GET UP WITH FLEAS. THE MAN WHO 

14:49:40.892 --> 14:49:42.892
CLAIMED

14:49:44.426 --> 14:49:46.860
HE WANTED TO CLEAN UP THE SWAN 
CREATED HIS OWN SWAB AND IS 

14:49:47.061 --> 14:49:50.040
DROWNING IN IT NOW. I DO HAVE TO
SAY THAT I HAVE EMPATHY FOR MY 

14:49:50.519 --> 14:49:52.519
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. THEY HAVE
TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT AND THEY

14:49:53.100 --> 14:49:55.100
DARE NIGHT

14:49:57.223 --> 14:50:01.892
NOT STEP OUT OF LINE. IF YOU OF 
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES DID TRY

14:50:02.093 --> 14:50:04.322
TO SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE 
THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT WAS 

14:50:04.526 --> 14:50:07.523
APPROPRIATE. THEY GOT SLAPPED 
QUICKLY. THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS 

14:50:07.734 --> 14:50:11.892
CONDUCT. THAT THE CALL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

14:50:37.030 --> 14:50:39.512
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A MEETING 
THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE IN NORTH 

14:50:39.716 --> 14:50:43.274
KOREA WHERE YOU HAVE TO PRAISE 
THE LEADER. YOU HAVE TO FALL IN 

14:50:43.475 --> 14:50:50.050
LINE BECAUSE THE ENTIRE REASON 
WAS CORRUPTION. YOU HAVE TO SAY 

14:50:50.272 --> 14:50:56.129
THAT HE DID NOTHING WRONG. ONE 
OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID THAT WE 

14:50:56.329 --> 14:50:58.421
ARE LOWERING THE BAR ON 
IMPEACHMENT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE 

14:50:58.625 --> 14:51:01.154
LOWERED THE BAR ON THE 
PRESIDENCY. IT IS SAD TO SEE MY 

14:51:01.353 --> 14:51:06.454
COLLEAGUES WHO KNOW WHAT IS 
BETTER. THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO SAY

14:51:06.668 --> 14:51:09.282
IT. THEY KNOW THE MAN IS 
CORRUPT.

14:51:17.614 --> 14:51:23.359
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
POWER IN HIS OFFICE TO CORRUPT 

14:51:23.759 --> 14:51:25.614
ELECTIONS. WILL MOVE TO IMPEACH 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE 

14:51:25.615 --> 14:51:29.804
OF THE ABUSE OF POWERS, THE 
BETRAYAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

14:51:37.579 --> 14:51:39.969
IF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE AISLE

14:51:45.308 --> 14:51:47.391
CANNOT BRING THEMSELVES TO DO 
WHAT IS RIGHT AND IMPEACH THE 

14:51:47.751 --> 14:51:50.132
PRESIDENT THAT THEY KNOW IS A 
THREAT TO TO OUR ELECTION

14:51:54.242 --> 14:51:56.915
. THAT THEY KNOW IS A THREAT TO 
OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. WE 

14:51:57.126 --> 14:52:00.164
WILL HAVE TO DO IT. AND WE WILL 
HAVE TO MOVE TO IMPEACH. I YIELD

14:52:00.369 --> 14:52:02.369
TO REPRESENTATIVE JACKSON LEE. 
LIKE I THINK

14:52:07.659 --> 14:52:09.659
THE GENTLE LADY FOR YIELDING. MY
CONCLUDING REMARKS. TO MY 

14:52:09.817 --> 14:52:12.288
FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
AISLE. TO THE SOLDIERS WHO WEAR 

14:52:12.491 --> 14:52:18.709
UNIFORMS. I HAVE NO ANGST, NO 
DISLIKE OF ANYONE WHO VOTED FOR 

14:52:18.907 --> 14:52:20.907
ANYONE IN 2016. I TAKE ISSUE

14:52:24.712 --> 14:52:26.956
THAT ONE WOULD SUGGEST THE WORK 
OF THIS COMMITTEE IS ABOUT A 

14:52:27.158 --> 14:52:29.094
DISLIKE FOR THOSE WHO VOTED FOR 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 

14:52:29.095 --> 14:52:31.095
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS BEFORE
THIS

14:52:36.908 --> 14:52:39.276
COMMITTEE FOR HIS OWN BEHAVIOR. 
FOR HIS OWN DESIRE TO DO WITH 

14:52:39.491 --> 14:52:42.992
PUBLIC MONIES IN A PUBLIC 
POSITION TO DO A PRIVATE MATTER,

14:52:43.205 --> 14:52:45.974
A POLITICAL MATTER. THAT IS TO 
GET THE DIRT ON HIS 2020 

14:52:46.178 --> 14:52:50.194
POTENTIAL OPPONENT. IN HONORING 
AND DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION 

14:52:50.408 --> 14:52:54.114
WE DEFEND AND HONOR OURSELVES. 
FOR THAT REASON AS AN INDICTING 

14:52:54.317 --> 14:52:57.458
BODY WE WILL GIVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CONGRESS TO 

14:52:58.178 --> 14:53:00.178
DECIDE ON

14:53:02.702 --> 14:53:04.702
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
ULTIMATE RESULTS. I STAND WITH 

14:53:04.881 --> 14:53:06.881
THE CONSTITUTION

14:53:12.657 --> 14:53:14.187
AND STAND FOR JUSTICE. I YIELD 
BACK. 

14:53:14.188 --> 14:53:15.649
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLE LADIES TIME IS 
EXPIRED. 

14:53:15.650 --> 14:53:17.473
&gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU SEEK 
RECOGNITION ? 

14:53:17.474 --> 14:53:19.070
&gt;&gt; I MOVED TO STRIKE THE LAST 
WORD. 

14:53:19.071 --> 14:53:21.926
&gt;&gt; FULL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU, 
FULL ME TWICE SHAME ON ME

14:53:25.874 --> 14:53:28.228
. WE ALLOWED THE PRESENT UNITED 
STATES TO ABUSE HIS OFFICE FOR 

14:53:28.432 --> 14:53:30.432
HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN

14:53:33.190 --> 14:53:35.649
. SHAME ON ALL OF US. AND SHAME 
ON OUR CONSTITUTION. WE KNOW 

14:53:35.855 --> 14:53:38.621
HE'S GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. ON 
JUNE 12 HE TOLD GEORGE 

14:53:38.827 --> 14:53:40.827
STEPHANOPOULOS

14:53:42.326 --> 14:53:44.988
THAT IF HE COULD RECEIVE HELP 
FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AS HE 

14:53:45.196 --> 14:53:50.179
DID FROM RUSSIA HE WOULD DO IT 
AGAIN. ON JULY 24 MUELLER 

14:53:50.391 --> 14:53:54.048
TESTIFIED AND SAID THAT THE 
PRESIDENT COULD BE

14:53:58.998 --> 14:54:00.998
CHARGED WITH 10 CRIMES OF 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. BUT THE 

14:54:01.049 --> 14:54:03.413
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PREVENTS 
HIM FROM DOING THAT. THE NEXT 

14:54:03.622 --> 14:54:05.622
DAY

14:54:08.336 --> 14:54:10.493
THE PRESIDENT IT DID IT AGAIN. 
EVERY PROSECUTOR WHEN THEY ARE 

14:54:10.690 --> 14:54:13.337
ASSIGNED A CASE WILL OPEN UP A 
FILE. THE FIRST THING WE DO IS 

14:54:13.541 --> 14:54:16.063
LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET. WAS THIS 
AN ABERRATION OR A PATTERN OF 

14:54:16.270 --> 14:54:18.270
CONDUCT THAT THE PERSON ENGAGES 
IN.

14:54:21.949 --> 14:54:24.593
IT'S NOT JUST PROSECUTORS THAT 
USE A RAP SHEET. WE ALL DO IT IN

14:54:24.798 --> 14:54:26.798
OUR EVERYDAY LIVES. IF YOUR 
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND YOU'RE 

14:54:26.840 --> 14:54:30.289
HIRING AN EMPLOYEE AND YOU FIND 
OUT THAT THEY HAVE MULTIPLE 

14:54:30.495 --> 14:54:33.896
THEFT FROM A PREVIOUS EMPLOYER ,
YOU WOULD PROBABLY NOT

14:54:42.689 --> 14:54:44.689
HIRE THEM. IF YOUR PARENT 
LOOKING FOR A BABYSITTER AND 

14:54:44.752 --> 14:54:46.624
MULTIPLE REFERENCES SAY THE 
BABYSITTER IS ALWAYS LATE. YOU 

14:54:46.625 --> 14:54:49.095
WERE NOT OFTEN TO WATCH YOUR 
KIDS. IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT 

14:54:49.295 --> 14:54:51.961
AND YOU SAW MULTIPLE BAD YELP 
REVIEWS. YOU WOULDN'T GO TO THAT

14:54:52.168 --> 14:55:00.358
RESTAURANT. THE PRESIDENT DOES 
NOT JUST HAVE BAD REVIEWS. HE 

14:55:00.559 --> 14:55:07.207
HAS REALLY BAD PRIOR CONDUCT. 
SERIOUS PRAYERS. HE IS A REPEAT 

14:55:07.408 --> 14:55:11.684
OFFENDER. CRIMES AGAINST OUR 
CONSTITUTION, CRIMES THAT

14:55:18.435 --> 14:55:20.681
ONE DAY MAY BE PROSECUTED. HE 
HAS ABUSED HIS POWER IN THE 

14:55:20.886 --> 14:55:23.852
PAST. HE IS ABUSING HIS POWER 
RIGHT NOW AND HE WILL ABUSE IT 

14:55:24.073 --> 14:55:26.073
TOMORROW

14:55:28.189 --> 14:55:30.356
. WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE IT WILL CONTINUE TO 

14:55:30.554 --> 14:55:32.419
PROTECT HIM. FORTUNATELY THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CONGRESS 

14:55:32.420 --> 14:55:37.729
THEY CAN SAY HE'S NOT ABOVE THE 
LAW AND WE ARE NOT HELPLESS AND 

14:55:37.937 --> 14:55:40.171
HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE. I YIELD
TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE 

14:55:40.402 --> 14:55:43.369
ISLAND. SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF 
EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WE ARE 

14:55:43.572 --> 14:55:45.572
HERE.

14:55:49.308 --> 14:55:51.588
WE DON'T LIKE THE POLICIES OF 
THE PRESIDENT. THE ONE THING WE 

14:55:51.793 --> 14:55:54.218
HAVE NOT HEARD , THE REAL REASON
WE ARE HERE TONIGHT IS THE 

14:55:54.412 --> 14:55:56.412
CONDUCT OF THE PRESIDENT. THE 
GRAVE MISCONDUCT. I WANT TO 

14:55:56.431 --> 14:55:59.095
RECOUNT QUICKLY THE EVIDENCE 
THAT WAS PRESENTED IN TEXT 

14:55:59.386 --> 14:56:01.386
MESSAGES, CALLS, EMAILS

14:56:03.937 --> 14:56:05.570
AND PRESS STATEMENTS AND TWEETS.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

14:56:05.571 --> 14:56:09.225
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE WAS 
ENGAGED THROUGH RUDY GIULIANI 

14:56:09.531 --> 14:56:12.873
AND INVESTIGATING UKRAINE. THAT 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY IS 

14:56:13.637 --> 14:56:16.880
SENSITIVE ABOUT UKRAINE BEING 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

14:56:22.427 --> 14:56:24.801
THE DAVID HOLMES TESTIFIED THAT 
THE REQUIREMENT WAS SO CONCRETE.

14:56:33.591 --> 14:56:42.324
AND THE EVIDENCE GOES ON AND ON 
OF THE PRESIDENTS EFFORT TO 

14:56:42.726 --> 14:56:48.781
CHEAT IN THE ELECTION AND USE 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYERS

14:56:49.185 --> 14:56:51.821
MONEY TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE.
THEY

14:56:55.724 --> 14:56:58.113
TALKED ABOUT ABUSE BECAUSE THEY 
UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS ENORMOUS.

14:56:58.315 --> 14:57:02.180
THE PRESIDENT WOULD USE THAT 
POWER NOT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD 

14:57:02.380 --> 14:57:07.961
BUT FOR HIS OWN ADVANTAGE. THEY 
CREATED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 

14:57:08.170 --> 14:57:12.405
TO GIVE A FINAL CHECK AGAINST 
THAT ABUSE OF POWER. NO ONE IS 

14:57:12.628 --> 14:57:16.810
HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO THIS 
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE NO 

14:57:17.119 --> 14:57:24.175
CHOICE WE ARE NOT ACTING OUT OF 
HATE BUT OUT OF THE LOVE FOR OUR

14:57:24.378 --> 14:57:29.445
COUNTRY AND OUR DEMOCRACY. AND 
WHEN GENERATIONS LOOK BACK THEY 

14:57:29.646 --> 14:57:31.650
WILL ASK WHAT DO WE DO TO 
PRESERVE

14:57:35.342 --> 14:57:37.701
OUR DEMOCRACY. THE ONLY THING WE
CAN DO IS HOLD THE PRESIDENT 

14:57:37.916 --> 14:57:40.827
ACCOUNTABLE.  IF WE DON'T THEY 
WILL ASK WHY WE FAILED TO 

14:57:41.034 --> 14:57:46.109
PRESERVE THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY 
ON EARTH THAT IS BEEN EXAMPLE TO

14:57:46.874 --> 14:57:52.405
THE WORLD IN THIS MOMENT WE HAVE
TO FIND THE COURAGE TO ANSWER 

14:57:52.606 --> 14:58:00.122
THAT QUESTION FOR ALL FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. I URGE MY 

14:58:01.084 --> 14:58:06.252
COLLEAGUES TONIGHT. WE MUST 
APPROVE THESE ARTICLES OF 

14:58:06.451 --> 14:58:12.106
IMPEACHMENT. TO MAKE IT CLEAR 
THAT NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY IS 

14:58:12.305 --> 14:58:17.810
ABOVE THE LAW. EVEN THE MOST 
POWERFUL PERSON IN THE PRESIDENT

14:58:18.012 --> 14:58:20.164
OF THE UNITED STATES. WITH THAT 
I YIELD BACK.

14:58:25.106 --> 14:58:28.956
BUT THE RECORD IS CLEAR. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ABUSED 

14:58:29.707 --> 14:58:32.363
HIS POWER BY SOLICITING FOREIGN

14:58:38.923 --> 14:58:40.795
INTERFERENCE AND UNDERMINING THE
INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND 

14:58:40.796 --> 14:58:43.387
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. MY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE SPENT

14:58:43.989 --> 14:58:52.123
ALL DAY ARGUING PROCESS. THAT IS
WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU CANNOT 

14:58:52.524 --> 14:58:54.524
DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE. YOU 
ARGUE PROCESS

14:58:58.014 --> 14:59:01.052
. HERE IS A PROCESS CONCERNED 
THAT YOU MIGHT REFLECT UPON. 

14:59:01.800 --> 14:59:10.774
EARLIER TODAY, MITCH McCONNELL 
GAVE SOME INDICATION AS TO HOW A

14:59:13.058 --> 14:59:19.177
POSSIBLE TRIAL IN THE SENATE MAY
RUN. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. I'M 

14:59:19.379 --> 14:59:22.206
GOING TO COORDINATE WITH THE 
PRESIDENTS OF LAWYERS SO THERE 

14:59:22.406 --> 14:59:28.867
WILL NOT BE ANY DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN US ON HOW TO DO THIS.

14:59:37.223 --> 14:59:39.613
THE SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING
TO COORDINATE WITH THE DEFENDANT

14:59:42.706 --> 14:59:50.032
ON HOW THE KANGAROO COURT IS 
GOING TO BE RUN. THAT IS A 

14:59:50.782 --> 14:59:54.289
PROCESS CONCERNED. THAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE 

14:59:55.048 --> 15:00:03.247
WORRIED ABOUT. AMERICA IS A 
RESILIENT NATION AND WE HAVE 

15:00:03.445 --> 15:00:07.035
BEEN THROUGH MOMENTS OF TURMOIL 
BEFORE. WE HAVE ALWAYS COME 

15:00:07.243 --> 15:00:16.034
THROUGH. WE ARE A RESILIENT 
NATION. LINCOLN SAID DURING THE 

15:00:16.231 --> 15:00:25.772
HEIGHT OF THE CIVIL WAR. AMERICA
IS THE LAST HOPE ON EARTH. FDR 

15:00:25.973 --> 15:00:31.191
SAID ON THE EVE OF THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR, DEMOCRACY IS NOT 

15:00:31.390 --> 15:00:33.390
DYING.

15:00:39.993 --> 15:00:42.841
REAGAN SAID IN THE MIDST OF THE 
COLD WAR. THAT AMERICA IS A 

15:00:43.048 --> 15:00:49.487
SHINING CITY ON A HILL. WHAT 
EXACTLY WILL HISTORY SAY ABOUT 

15:00:49.713 --> 15:00:59.289
US? WILL WE PUT PRINCIPLE OVER 
PARTY? WILL WE PUT 

15:01:00.050 --> 15:01:05.330
THE CONSTITUTION ABOVE 
CORRUPTION? WILL WE PUT 

15:01:05.525 --> 15:01:08.571
DEMOCRACY OVER DEMIGOD.

15:01:14.323 --> 15:01:18.723
WHAT WILL HISTORY SAY ABOUT US. 
I YIELD TO MY DISTINGUISHED 

15:01:18.924 --> 15:01:21.400
COLLEAGUE FROM THE GREAT STATE 
OF TEXAS.

15:01:37.683 --> 15:01:40.253
&gt;&gt; FOR ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE 
BEEN LISTENING AND WATCHING ALL 

15:01:40.464 --> 15:01:46.361
DAY. GO TO THE EVIDENCE. OVER 
100 HOURS OF TESTIMONY BY SOME 

15:01:46.568 --> 15:01:56.114
OF AMERICA'S GREATEST PATRIOTS. 
MICK MULVANEY'S OWN WORDS. HE IS

15:01:56.321 --> 15:02:01.038
THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF. 
AND FINALLY THE PRESENCE OWN 

15:02:01.802 --> 15:02:03.802
WORDS INVITING

15:02:05.507 --> 15:02:07.507
RUSSIA, UKRAINE, AND CHINA INTO 
OUR ELECTION.

15:02:11.805 --> 15:02:13.972
THE REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES CLAIM 
THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 

15:02:14.186 --> 15:02:16.186
EVIDENCE.

15:02:23.791 --> 15:02:25.824
WE HAVE A LIVING EXAMPLE THAT 
WAS RELEASED JUST TONIGHT. 

15:02:26.029 --> 15:02:31.334
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THAT EXAMPLE
, IF MY COLLEAGUES THINK THAT 

15:02:32.076 --> 15:02:38.048
THE PRESIDENT IS FREE FROM 
WRONGDOING , I WOULD ASK THEM TO

15:02:38.283 --> 15:02:42.708
JOIN US IN CALLING ON PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE AT ALL. 

15:02:42.908 --> 15:02:46.772
RELEASE THE WITNESSES, RELEASE 
THE DOCUMENTS, LET THE AMERICAN 

15:02:47.722 --> 15:02:50.373
PUBLIC MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.

15:02:56.870 --> 15:02:58.870
THE

15:03:00.987 --> 15:03:02.987
OBSTRUCTION IS CAN BE IN. 
TONIGHT WAS A VICTORY. THE 

15:03:03.029 --> 15:03:08.303
CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY SUED
IN FEDERAL COURT. FOR DOCUMENTS 

15:03:08.704 --> 15:03:12.512
RELATED TO THE UKRAINE SCANDAL 
AND THIS IS WHAT THEY GOT.

15:03:19.670 --> 15:03:21.541
WHAT THEY GOT WERE HEAVILY 
REDACTED DOCUMENTS. WHY? BECAUSE

15:03:21.542 --> 15:03:23.542
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT
