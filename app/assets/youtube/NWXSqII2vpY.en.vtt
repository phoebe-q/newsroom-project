00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.834
-House Resolution 24 resolved

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.567 position:86%
that Donald John Trump, President of the United States,

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.767 position:72%
is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.834 position:59%
Article 1, incitement of insurrection.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.934 position:92%
The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.167 position:63%
shall have the sole power of impeachment

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.934 position:80%
and that the President shall be removed from office

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.868 position:70%
on impeachment for and conviction of treason,

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:24.868 position:66%
bribery, or other crimes and misdemeanors.

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:27.367 position:63%
Further, section 3 of the 14th Amendment

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.701
to the Constitution

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.067 position:81%
prohibits any person who has engaged in insurrection

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:34.734 position:59%
or rebellion against the United States

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.567
from holding any office.

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:39.234 position:59%
-We are debating this historic measure

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:41.367
at an actual crime scene.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.033
And we wouldn't be here

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.901 position:83%
if it weren't for the President of the United States.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.501 position:77%
This was not a protest. This was an insurrection.

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.267 position:73%
This was a well-organized attack on our country

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:55.167
that was incited by Donald Trump.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:58.033 position:81%
-And we know that the President of the United States

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.334
incited this insurrection,

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:04.100 position:75%
this armed rebellion against our common country.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.834
He must go.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:10.601 position:97%
He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.734 position:91%
-Those who stormed the Capitol will be brought to justice.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:17.133 position:91%
And some members have proposed an alternative procedure --

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.834
censoring the President --

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.434 position:98%
which could garner significant bipartisan support in the House.

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:25.400
-I believe impeaching the President

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.534
in such a short timeframe

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:29.200
would be a mistake.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.234 position:80%
That doesn't mean the President is free from fault.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.601
The President bears responsibility

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:36.601
for Wednesday's attack on Congress

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.434
by mob rioters.

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:41.033 position:84%
-The President took an oath to defend the Constitution

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.667 position:66%
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.167 position:59%
Last week, there was a domestic threat

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.334
at the door of the Capitol,

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:51.968
and he did nothing to stop it.

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:56.133 position:78%
That is why, with a heavy heart and clear resolve,

00:01:56.133 --> 00:02:00.334 position:77%
I will vote yes on these articles of impeachment.

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:03.234 position:66%
-Today, we don't need a long investigation

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:07.033 position:80%
to know the President incited right-wing terrorists

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.801
to attack the Congress

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:12.334 position:70%
to try to overturn Constitutional government.

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:15.434 position:64%
The actions were in public, plain as day.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.300 position:63%
His actions are the most serious offense

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.267 position:64%
against our Constitution and our country.

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.133
They are impeachable acts.

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:26.100 position:63%
-I rise in opposition to the resolution.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.934 position:61%
At a time when our country needs unity,

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:31.767 position:72%
it is concerning that my Democratic colleagues

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.734 position:69%
have chosen to begin impeachment proceedings

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:40.434 position:88%
against a President with just seven days left in office.

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.067
-The ayes are 232.

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.901
The nays are 197.

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:48.634
The resolution is adopted.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.734 position:67%
Without objection, the motion to reconsider

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:52.767
is laid upon the table.
