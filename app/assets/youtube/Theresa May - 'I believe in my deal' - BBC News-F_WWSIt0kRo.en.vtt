00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.120
serving in high office is an honor and
privilege it is also a heavy

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.730
responsibility that is true at any time
but especially when the stakes are so

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.960
high and negotiating the UK's withdraw
from the EU after 40 years and building

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
from the ground up a new and enduring
relationship for the good of our

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.309
children and grandchildren is a matter
of the highest consequence it touches

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.600
almost every area of our national life a
whole economy and virtually every job

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.149
the livelihoods of our fellow citizens
our integrity as United Kingdom of Four

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.170
Nations our safety and security all of
these are at stake my approach

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.949
throughout has been to put the national
interest first not a partisan interest

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.610
and certainly not my own political
interest I do not judge harshly those of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.830
my colleagues who seek to do the same
but who reach a different conclusion

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.450
they must do what they believe to be
right just as I do I'm sorry that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.759
they've chosen to leave the government
and I thank them for their service but I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.900
believe with every fiber of my being
that the course I have set out is the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.720
right one for our country and all our
people from the very beginning I have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.310
known what I wanted to deliver for the
British people to honor their vote in

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
the referendum full control of our
borders by bringing an end to the free

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.619
movement of people once and for all
 full control of our money so we decide

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.680
ourselves how to spend it on priorities
like our NHS full control of our laws by

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.810
ending the jurisdiction of the European
Court of Justice in the United Kingdom

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.420
getting us out of the Common
Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.540
Policy for good that is exactly what
this agreement will deliver free

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.110
movement ended vast annual payments
stopped the jurisdiction of the ECJ

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.700
over out of the c.a.p out of the CFP
this is a brexit that delivers on the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.890
priorities of the British people
 in achieving these objectives

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.630
I'm also determined to protect the
things that are important to us protect

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.410
the hundreds of thousands of
manufacturing jobs that put food on the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.110
tables of working families right across
the UK those jobs rely on cross-border

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.810
trade in goods with parts flowing easily
in and out of the UK allowing for

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.720
integrated supply chains this Agreement
protects that protect the close security

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.480
cooperation that helps keep us safe this
Agreement does that protect the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.470
integrity of the United Kingdom and
peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.530
by leaving the EU as one United Kingdom
and having no hard border between

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.740
Northern Ireland and Ireland this
agreement does that as well yes

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.350
difficult and sometimes uncomfortable
decisions have had to be made I

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.700
understand fully that there are some who
are unhappy with those compromises but

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.340
this deal delivers what people voted for
and it is in the national interest and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.780
we can only secure it if we unite behind
the agreement reached in cabinet

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.459
yesterday if we do not move forward with
that agreement nobody can know for sure

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.440
the consequences that will follow it
would be to take a path of deep and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.709
grave uncertainty when the British
people just want us to get on with it

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.120
they are looking to the Conservative
Party to deliver to deliver a brexit

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.310
that works for the whole UK a strong
economy that keeps jobs safe and wages

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.430
rising and first-class public services
we can rely on, an NHS there for all of us

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.340
great schools for every child and for
homes that families need that is what

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.620
the people we serve expect and that is
what we owe it to them to deliver

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.400
goodness me you normally put your hands
straight up after they hear

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.480
Laura..

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.680
thank you very much Prime Minister Laura Kuenssberg BBC News

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.040
it's very clear you want to stick to your
plan isn't it the case though that

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.810
others are seeking to take that decision
out of your hands and Prime Minister is

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.940
it not the case now that you are in
office but you're not really in power

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.420
when we bring the deal back what is
going to happen now is that there'll be

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.950
negotiations particularly focusing on
the future framework and filling their

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.060
details of that out and an EU Council
meeting and that will then be brought

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.370
back to the House of Commons and to a
vote in the House of Commons I'm going

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.050
to do my job of getting the best deal
for Britain I'm going to do my job of

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.890
getting a deal that is in the national
interest when the vote comes before the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.570
House of Commons MPs will be doing their
job they will need to look at that a

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.260
deal they will need to consider the vote
of the British people to leave the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.970
European Union and our duty to deliver
on that vote and of course they will be

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.850
held to account by their constituents
for the decisions that they take
