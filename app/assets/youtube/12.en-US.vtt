The message I have for people who donâ€™t think Covid is real: grow up.

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:11.064 position:63%
Grow up and mask up, because it is real.

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.020
Oh, I love you so much.

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.004 position:64%
Thank you for taking the time and coming.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.004 position:59%
I didn't think I was going to make it.

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:28.072 position:59%
I kind of said 'goodbye' to my family.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.064 position:64%
After weeks of treatment for coronavirus,

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:36.068 position:97%
Duane Severson is finally able to see his daughter, Diana, safely.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.032 position:89%
Every day when I would call dad he didn't sound like dad.

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:41.068
He was so weak.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:47.000
And his voice sounded so helpless.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.012 position:58%
And I just wanted to run and hug him.

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:53.072 position:78%
I had Covid as well, so I was quarantined at home.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:56.008
In North Dakota, it has taken time

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:59.028 position:70%
to convince residents of Covid's seriousness.

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:04.084 position:98%
I maybe was a little careless, but we were golfing every Wednesday.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.080
And when the weather turned ickier,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.012 position:98%
instead of golfing, we started playing cards, and that was not smart.

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:17.036
It goes through your system.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.088 position:67%
And it'll pick out any weak spots you have.

00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:26.088
Tell them it is very serious.

00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:29.068
I mean, it's life and death.

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:32.092 position:88%
For weeks, the state has had the highest number of cases

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.032 position:61%
and deaths, per capita, in the country.

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:37.008
Things are not slowing down.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.096 position:91%
So obviously as a physician, this makes me very concerned.

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:44.080 position:75%
I anticipate that our numbers will likely go up,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.032 position:97%
which reflects on the fact that people are going to be sicker.

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.076 position:61%
We should focus on the problem at hand.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:54.064
That means by mitigating risk,

00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:59.012 position:92%
by wearing masks, by hand hygiene and by social distancing.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.068
I myself, I'm not too afraid of it.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:07.036 position:92%
I think there are a lot of people who are just tired of it.

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:15.028 position:97%
And unfortunately, that means it's not going to get better with that sort of attitude.

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:20.008 position:97%
I'm just not a believer in it. I think it was manmade, honestly.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:27.000 position:97%
It's not so hard to put on a mask, it's not so hard to brush your teeth or whatever.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.012 position:92%
You know it can be simple but some people made it an issue.

00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:35.000 position:67%
I just don't think it's necessary for that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.092 position:97%
I understand for everybody else's safety. But that's just my take on it.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:45.008
But I'm 22, I'm young and dumb.

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.020 position:63%
For the healthcare workers in the state,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.008 position:83%
the coronavirus cycle shows no signs of slowing down.

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:52.068
This is your day every day?

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:54.068
Every day in the last few weeks,

00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:56.096
this is what it's been, yes.

00:02:56.096 --> 00:02:59.040
I've had to recently tell my staff

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.016 position:58%
I may not be able to honour vacation.

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:05.036
As a manager, that is really tough.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:08.028
My staff deserve their time off,

00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:11.092 position:66%
and to not allow that, it's heartbreaking.
