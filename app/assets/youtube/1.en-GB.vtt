00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:06.807 position:66%
The White House has described the hearings

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.276 position:61%
as an epic embarrassment for Democrats.

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.811 position:61%
And certainly there were times when his

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.813 position:59%
performance did seem a little halting.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.015
I'm sorry. What was the question?

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.186
I... leave it with the report.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.587
I take your question.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.824 position:89%
He appeared a little confused about some of the questions

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.059 position:66%
and some of the content of his own report.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.896 position:73%
But he did what the Department of Justice asked

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.331 position:67%
he stayed well within the script, venturing

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.767
very rarely outside the parameters

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.536
of the 448-page report.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.839 position:61%
That's what it says in the report, yes.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.474
And I go... I stand by the report.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.911 position:69%
Democrats looking for a performance in which

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:47.781 position:92%
Mr Mueller would read dramatic excerpts from his own report

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.449
failed to materialise.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.118
He said very little.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.220
They did most of the talking.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.423 position:97%
Did the president refuse a request to be interviewed by you and your team?

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.224
Yes.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.091
Yes.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.962 position:98%
Is it true that you tried for more than a year to secure an interview with the president?

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:02.562
Yes.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.132
No real new revelations came out.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:09.603 position:97%
The best that could be said from Democrats' point of view, was that they got

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.072 position:67%
Robert Mueller to sit there and say: 'Yes.'

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.843 position:97%
He did not have a real conclusion on whether Donald Trump obstructed justice or not,

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.645
but he would have said, if he did.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:24.151 position:98%
What's he's doing is not obstructing justice, he is pursuing justice.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.120
You perpetuated injustice.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.123 position:95%
Republicans and conservatives who are defending Donald Trump,

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:34.394 position:98%
they firmly believe that this still was, essentially, an exoneration.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:39.866 position:98%
This may close Robert Mueller's segment of the investigation of Donald Trump.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.336 position:67%
It's not going to end the politics of this.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:46.773 position:98%
I don't think anybody could have done a good performance. He had no material.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.209 position:75%
People who think Donald Trump committed a crime,

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.044 position:61%
people who think he should be impeached

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.646 position:58%
probably still think that after this.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:57.884 position:98%
The president wanted to fire you because you were investigating him

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.354 position:73%
for obstruction of justice, isn't that correct?

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.489 position:61%
That's what it says in the report, yes.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.159 position:98%
It is exceptionally unlikely that the president would be indicted

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.629 position:69%
for a conspiracy linked to Russian collusion

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.264
or obstruction of justice.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.267 position:98%
This hearing has certainly not increased the risk for Donald Trump.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.770 position:59%
If anything, it may have decreased it.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.206 position:59%
The Democrats had to move this needle.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.342 position:67%
The public, so far, is against impeachment.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.044
This didn't make that more likely.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:27.114 position:77%
To the contrary, the hearing sort of piddled out.

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:30.751 position:77%
After 6 hours, even the members seemed exhausted.
