00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.040
The internet revolutionised democracy,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.780
by giving every phone, every computer, a more

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.180
equal chance to speak and share information.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.600
And during any big event whether in celebration
or in a crisis, many of us look to social

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380
media as our primary source of news.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.360
However, this network, which was built to
bring us closer together, is now under threat….

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.000
Human rights groups say turning off the internet
is now becoming a defining tool of government

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.660
repression around the world.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.800
Using the very latest data, this video will
reveal the true scale of the internet black

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.060
outs around the world. And show how and when
the plug is pulled.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.290
Take a look at this map, as we move through
2019, watch as the internet is turned off

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.780
more than 200 times, in more than 30 countries.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.460
Sometimes an entire nation will be switched
off, but often it’s localised to a city

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.520
or region.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.640
And our analysis shows these blackouts
often occur during times of political instability

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.880
or civil unrest.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.740
Governments often say it’s to help ensure
public safety and stop the spread of fake

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.860
news.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.720
But critics say the shutdowns stifle the flow
of information online and crack down on any

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.900
potential descent offline.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.220
The data shows that in 2019 the internet was
switched off during more than 60 protests

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.700
and during a dozen elections.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.810
So just how do governments shutdown the internet?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.270
When authorities order a “blackout”, internet
service providers are told to pull the plug

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.900
on all social platforms such as Whatsapp,
Twitter and Telegram.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.900
Last year, the central African nation of Chad
endured one of the longest shutdowns on record,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.020
after the President ordered a nationwide blackout
for more than 15 months.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.700
Much harder to monitor though, is when governments
‘throttle’ the connection

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.450
By slowing it down from 3, 4, or 5G down to
2G

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.360
It becomes impossible to share videos or live
stream.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.450
Last May, the President of Tajikistan admitted
to throttling all Google platforms, as well

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.400
as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, saying
they were “vulnerable to terrorist activity”.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.700
However, nowhere experiences more shutdowns
than India. In 2019, Indians experienced over

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.420
100 blackouts.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.260
Hardest hit by far, was Kashmir, where mobile
internet services were suspended for more

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.739
than half of the year.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.430
With millions of people affected, forced off
social media, deprived of news and restricted

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.480
in their means to contact their loved ones,
Kashmiris say the shutdown has been devastating.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.109
India says the move was necessary to maintain
law and order

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.180
but economically it has been crippling, with
many local businesses being run into the ground.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.260
Around the world, the most common reason for
governments to shut down the internet is in

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.280
the interest of public safety. Then they pull
the plug.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.779
So where is this all heading?

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.499
What happened in Iran last year, points to
a trend that could change the future of the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.620
internet.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.540
Iran, along with Russia and Cuba, are the
only countries in the world that are currently

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.940
testing their own national “internal internet”.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.180
Under such a setup, Iranian government says their systems would be protected from foreign attacks

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.140
But critics say it would cut the country off from the rest of the world

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.640
Last November, amid flash demonstrations over
rising fuel costs, Iran did reportedly did

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.290
a trial run of its national “intranet”.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.189
It backfired.

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.969
Millions of people were plunged into an information
blackout and violence erupted. Hundreds of

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.279
civilians lost their lives.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.080
With state-ordered shutdowns on the rise,
the internet, a revolution which was built

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:06.889
to bring us closer together is under threat.
