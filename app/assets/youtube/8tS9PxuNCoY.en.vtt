00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.360
-Our Founders' vision
of a republic is under threat

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.280
from actions
from the White House.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.670
-By the way, it doesn't really
feel like we're being impeached.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.190
-[chanting] Donald Trump
has got to go!

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.800
-Hey, hey; ho, ho.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.030
Donald Trump has got to go.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.320
-The people of America
see through this.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.840
-Article 1 charges the president
of the United States

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.370
with abusing
the power of his office.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.850
-The second article
of impeachment:

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.420
obstruction of Congress.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.020
-The people of America
understand

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.770
due process and they understand

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.360
when it is being trampled
in the people's House.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.580
-The House Intelligence
and Judiciary Committees

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.360
are done holding hearings.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.600
And, as soon as
the Rules Committee

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.080
settles on terms of debate,
two articles of impeachment

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.130
are headed
to the House floor.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.950
President Donald Trump is set
to become the third president

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.280
in American history
to be impeached.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.810
-[chanting] Four more years!

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.260
Four more years!
Four more years!

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.280
-What do we want?
-Impeach trump!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.380
-When do we want it?
-Now!

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.760
-On the day of and the hours
of debate, so,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.610
come in at 9:00, 10:00,
vote on the rule,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.460
six hours of debate,
equally divided, perhaps.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.930
-Is that a Wednesday night
rally?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.230
-Correct.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.480
That says
"impeachment victory tour".

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.440
-First vote:
article 1, 15 minutes.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.250
Second vote: 15 minutes.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.800
-On the House side,
how many impeachment managers?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.750
There's no limit.
-There's no guidance.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.180
Historically, they always go to
the Judiciary Committee

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.800
'cause that's the one
that's handled it.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.510
I think everybody expects Schiff
to be, you know, the lead.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.830
The final thing would then be
the Senate passing [indistinct].

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.550
-And then, some sort of UC
or some sort of resolution

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.920
on when the impeachment trial
actually starts.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.810
Oh, and probably judges
before they expire, yeah.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.460
-With both sides acknowledging
President Trump's impeachment

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.980
seems inevitable, Senate leaders
are starting to discuss

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.490
what a trial might look like.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.000
-This is a political process.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.650
There's not anything judicial
about it.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.750
Impeachment
is a political decision.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.370
The House made a partisan
political decision to impeach.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.430
I'm not impartial
about this at all.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.750
-Senator McConnell,
you've been withholding.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.210
-That's the weekly Tuesday
press conferences.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.730
Mitch McConnell and Chuck
Schumer

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.080
come out with their
leadership teams right here.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.680
It's called the Ohio
Clock corridor

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.350
because right behind me
is a clock.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.600
It is not from Ohio.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.010
It is actually from my hometown,
of Philadelphia,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.530
but it's called the Ohio Clock.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.560
Don't ask the question.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.800
I don't have the answer.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.660
But they come here every Tuesday

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.430
and they lay out
the weekly agenda.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.850
-It's clear that
Senator McConnell

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.640
wants to use the Senate

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.960
to help participate
in a cover-up.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.040
We have not heard a single
argument from Leader McConnell

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.600
as to why the witnesses
we have requested

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.210
should not come forward.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.800
-Right now, they're on track
for what would be

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.150
a very partisan
beginning to the trial.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.430
-The Rules Committee
will come to order.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.000
A resolution impeaching
Donald John Trump,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.460
president of the United States,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.260
for high crimes
and misdemeanors.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.390
-The House Rules Committee
holds the last hearing

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.690
before the impeachment articles
go to the House floor.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.140
-We've listened to the hearings.
We read the transcripts.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.060
-This committee sets the rules
of floor debate,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.940
but, first, they have
a debate of their own,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.000
echoing the arguments set forth
in the Intelligence

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.190
and Judiciary Committees.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.400
-It's clear this this president
acted in a way

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.100
that not only violates
the public trust.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.210
He jeopardized
our national security.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.060
-At the end of the day,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.850
it's simply last-minute
Christmas shoppin'.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.940
They ran and found something
and said, "We can do it"!

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.100
-Personally, I believe
the articles themselves

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.200
are unwarranted.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.210
-The Rules Committee
ultimately votes in favor

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.590
of holding six hours
of debate on Wednesday,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.540
setting up a House floor
vote that night.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.430
-All those in favor
will say aye.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.190
-Aye!

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.330
-All those opposed, no.
-No!

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.970
-In the opinion of the chair,
the ayes have it

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.570
and the motion is agreed to.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.050
-We look forward to getting
on to the Senate.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.430
We're not entitled to lawyers.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.280
We're not entitled to witnesses.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.650
We're not entitled
to anything in the House.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.220
It's a total sham.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.630
-President Trump, meeting
with the president of Guatemala

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.310
at the White House, hits out
at the impeachment charges.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.910
-Unless they do something
about this,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.480
other presidents are gonna
have to live with this and,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.510
every time they do something
that's a little bit unpopular,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.010
a little bit strong,
even if they're 100% right.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.160
-And, soon afterwards,
sends a letter to House Speaker

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.480
Nancy Pelosi,
protesting the whole process.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.400
-President Trump released
a fiery letter

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.010
to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.110
-He says, "You have cheapened
the importance

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.450
of the very
ugly word impeachment".

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.740
-"You are violating
your oaths of office".

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.000
-"You are offending Americans
of faith by continually saying,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.320
'I pray for the president,'

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.670
when you know
this statement is not true".

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.390
-"You are breaking your
allegiance to the Constitution,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.010
and you are declaring open war
on American Democracy".

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.310
-He claims that there was
"more due process"

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.990
in the Salem with trials.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.410
All this underneath
White House letterhead.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.420
-The upcoming House votes have
galvanized people

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.850
in various cities to march
in favor of impeachment.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.820
-The justice that he deserves.
We find Trump.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.250
-Guilty, guilty, guilty!
-Including in Detroit.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.210
-This is what
democracy looks like!

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.450
-Just two hours away
from Battle Creek, Michigan,

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.000
where President Trump will hold
a rally at about the same time

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the House is voting
on whether to impeach him.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.460
-This is not about that guy
that's in office,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.780
but it's about
protecting our democracy.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.460
'Cause we do not have a king.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.480
He is not above the law
and that needs to be addressed.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.360
-Ho, ho.
Donald Trump has got to go.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.960
Hey, hey; ho, ho.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.280
-After weeks of intense
partisan rancor,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.890
it all comes down to today:

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.820
a vote on the floor
of the United States House

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.470
on whether to impeach
President Donald Trump.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.670
Trump would only be
the third president

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.030
in American history
to be impeached.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.720
-Washington is waking up for
a key day of impeachment today

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.920
and the final vote
on the House floor.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.390
Meanwhile, more demonstrators

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.880
have gathered
outside the Capitol.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.590
-Alright.
Alright, here we go.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.080
It's Wednesday, December 18th.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.130
It is Impeachment Day.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.710
Just exactly one week
before Christmas.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.630
At 9:00, the chamber's gonna
open up and, right away,

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.400
you're gonna see
procedural fights.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.830
Republicans are gonna start
offering motions to adjourn.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.500
-I move that the House
do now adjourn.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.670
-Privilege resolutions.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.940
-The privilege resolution.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.720
-They're gonna do some
protest motions.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.980
-I raise a point of order
against H Res 767.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.110
-Opposed, say no.
-No!

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.300
-Once they approve the debate,
then,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.150
you're gonna have six hours
of real back-and-forth debate

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.670
about whether or not Trump

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.200
should be the third president
ever to be impeached.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.720
-When the president's wrongdoing
was revealed,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.540
he launched an unprecedented,
indiscriminate,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.810
and categorical campaign
of defiance and obstruction.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.960
-But this notion, but, I mean,
they're talking about holding it

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.340
in months
and continuing investigations

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.510
and potentially adding
in articles and all this stuff.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.320
-Never before, in the history
of our nation,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.930
have we seen a president declare

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.460
and act
as if he is above the law.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.800
-The fight isn't over.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.230
I think that's what I put
at the end.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.410
Impeachment might be done,
but the fight against Trump

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.200
isn't over.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.690
-Will we let impeachment
become an exercise

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.720
of raw political power,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.830
regardless if it damages
our country?

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.740
-This is an outrage.
I yield back.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.490
-Gentleman from New York.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.550
-Am deeply concerned
that any member of the House

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.010
could spout Russian propaganda
on the floor of the House.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.690
-The gentleman from New York
is recognized for

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.510
[pounds gavel].
The House will come to order.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.650
The gentleman from New York
is recognized for one minute.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.760
-Thank you, Mr Chairman.
-Russian propaganda.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.340
-[pounds gavel] The House
will come to order.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.900
The House will come to order.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.810
The gentleman from.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.900
-Here we go, Mares.
-Yeah.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.030
Nadler chided him and he tried
to defend himself,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.879
but they cut off his mic
and so he just yelled at Nadler.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.810
-Everything, so far,
is proceeding

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.700
pretty ridiculously
close to plan.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.760
The votes on the articles of
impeachment early this evening.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.950
-Only the president has
that power,

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.200
to corrupt our foreign policy
for political gain.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.610
And, the moment
he chose to do so,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.080
the moment he undermined
our security

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.490
in a scheme
to undermine our democracy,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.980
whether he succeeded or not,
and thank God he did not,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.630
at that moment.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.210
-Start before the rally.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.010
-No, the media,
look, look, I know.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.910
You know, it's hard
for somebody to know

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.920
if you're not the subject

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.650
'cause how do you know
The New York Times

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.620
is totally dishonest,
The Washington Post?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.700
ABC is so bad.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.750
CNN and MSNBC, their ratings
are down the tubes.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.720
It's great.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.050
I like it.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.250
-President Trump takes the stage
in Battle Creek

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.450
just four minutes before the
first impeachment vote begins.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.400
-They think the Washington swamp
should be able

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.630
to veto the results
of an election.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.050
-No way!
-That's what they think.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.610
-The question now occurs
on the adoption of article 1.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.430
-It's perversion.
-All in favor, say aye.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.070
-We did nothing wrong.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.320
-[bellowing] Aye!

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.230
-They don't even have any crime!
-Opposed, no.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.560
-[bellowing] No!

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.720
-This is the first impeachment
where there's no crime.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.600
-The yeas are 230.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.190
The nays are 197.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.790
Present is one.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.740
Article 1 is adopted
[bangs gavel].

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.010
-So we had 198.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.700
229-198.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.060
We didn't lose one
Republican vote.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.370
And, and, three Democrats
voted for us.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.940
Haley!
Haley!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.270
I say, "Tell me
what I did, Pelosi".

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.730
"Well, we don't know!
You violated the Constitution".

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.490
Democrat lawmakers do not
believe you have the right

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.350
to select your own president.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.140
-Article 2 [bangs gavel]
is adopted.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.740
-Crazy Nancy Pelosi's House
Democrats

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.760
have branded themselves
with an eternal mark of shame,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.110
and it really is.
It's a disgrace.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.590
Yesterday, I sent Pelosi
a letter,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.130
denouncing and condemning

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.380
her party's outrageous
abuse of power.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.540
That's what it is.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.180
They have nothing.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.970
They're the ones that should
be impeached,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.570
every one of 'em.
