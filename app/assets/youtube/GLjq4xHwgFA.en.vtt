00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.140
-The President has
a very different role.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.810
The President of
the United States

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.570
has a noble and unique role
to unite the country

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.070
and to draw on all people,
regardless of their race,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.530
their color,
their national origin.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.040
And in that regard,
the President, I think,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.600
failed with his comments

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.530
yesterday and again
with the comments today.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.390
I believe it's really incumbent
upon the President

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.280
to bring us together,
and that's a responsibility

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.510
that I think he should
take very seriously.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.980
-Chuck Schumer's calling the
tweets and the comments racist.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.160
Would you agree with Chuck
Schumer on that point?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.230
-I think Senator Tim Scott
indicated that he believed

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.760
that the comments
were racially offensive.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.840
I think that's an appropriate
characterization.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350
-How do we move past this
as a country?

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.480
-I wish we had moved past it,
but I'm afraid that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450
with the comments that have
been hurled back and forth,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.550
we're back into
the kind of divisiveness

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.000
that is so destructive
to our national spirit.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.380
Look, what you've seen
by the comments

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.850
that have been made
is destructive.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.980
It's dangerous.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.020
It's demeaning to our fellow
Americans,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.470
and that's simply wrong.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.610
-It was a poor choice of words.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.960
I don't know why the President
had to say anything at all.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240
When you argue with a fool,
it just proves there are two.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.040
Also, there's a rule in politics
and also in government

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.040
that you should never
interrupt your opponent

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.620
when he's screwing up.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.670
Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez
and Congresswoman Omar

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210
and their colleagues

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.360
are destroying
the Democratic Party,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
just in my judgment.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090
If I didn't know any better,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.710
I'd think they were
Republican plants.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.920
And that's all I'm gonna say.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.560
-He's the one
who made the statement.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.150
I'm sure that he's qualified
his statement in some way.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.360
The one I heard was on Somalia,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.550
and I can understand
why he might say that,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.440
but I can't stand up
for the words that he used.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.830
-You can't stand up
for the words he used?

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.180
-Well, no, and I didn't say them
.
