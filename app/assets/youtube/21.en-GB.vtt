00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.720
This is the story of the Delta
variant, of how it came to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.600
the UK, of how it delayed
Boris Johnson's Covid plans.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.360
- I cannot say that we have met all
our four tests for proceeding with

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.840
step four on June 21st. I think it is sensible
to wait just a little longer.
&nbsp;

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.280
- Let's go back to the start. In October,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.800
a new variant was detected in India.
Six months on, in April, India's cases

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.440
were surging and several mutations
of the variant were causing concern.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.440
One was called B.1.617.2. This was Delta.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.600
It was gaining
international attention.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.640
The World Health Organization
designated it a variant of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.160
interest on 4th April.
On 9th April,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.360
Boris Johnson's government
expanded its red list of countries,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
the ones facing the
strictest travel restrictions.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.920
Here's the press release:
The Philippines, Pakistan,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.080
Kenya and Bangladesh to be
added to England's red list,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.360
we were told. It went on: 'The
additional restrictions will help

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.160
to reduce the risk of new variants

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.640
such as those first identified in
South Africa and Brazil, entering

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.720
England.' The Delta variant was
not mentioned nor was India.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.680
Which begs the question, why?
Well, one possible explanation

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.560
was politics -  that Boris
Johnson had a trip to India

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.360
in late April that he did
not want to cancel.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.440
Weeks later, the Sunday Times
reported: 'It is alleged that Boris

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.880
Johnson wanted to keep relations
with India smooth before key

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.080
post-Brexit trade talks.' The theory goes
the trip would have helped.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.720
The government's never accepted that
but pressure to cancel was building.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.280
One leading public health academic
said India being off the red list

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.000
was 'frankly insane'. And we got
more detail on the government's

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.280
thinking when Health Secretary
Matt Hancock said this in May:

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.920
- When we put Pakistan on the red
list and indeed Bangladesh

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.880
the positivity of those arriving
from Pakistan and Bangladesh was

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.560
three times higher that from India.
That's why we took those decisions.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.960
- But publicly available government
data does not back that up.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440
These are the Covid infection rates
for arrivals in late March and early April,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.080
India is above Bangladesh
and close to Pakistan. Mr Hancock

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.840
has also argued that the government
did not have the full picture.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.720
- We didn't have that data because
there is a long lag from the cases,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.080
the date on which the case occurs,
to the date when the sequencing

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.200
result comes back. So you have to
act on the data that you have.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.960
- His argument there is about sequencing,
which identifies individual variants.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.920
But even without that information

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.640
the headline data from India needed
little interpretation. By mid-April,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.000
even after factoring in population
size, India was recording far more

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.920
new cases a day than Bangladesh
or Pakistan. Though the UK government

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.760
says that was in part
because India was testing more.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.360
What the UK definitely knew was that
India had outbreaks of what were then

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.920
called the Kent, South Africa and
Brazil variants, and Covid in India

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.280
was a huge and rapidly escalating
crisis. And within days, the government

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.120
had changed tack. This press release
on 19th April announced

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.360
India was being added to the red
list from the 23rd. It noted:

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.920
'There is a high volume of travel
between India and the UK.' Certainly

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.960
there was a high volume in April. The
Sunday Times estimates that 20,000 people

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.240
arrived in the UK from India in the
first three weeks of the month.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.680
Again, though, this week, Boris Johnson
has defended his government.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.920
- We put India on the red list,
Mr Speaker, on April 23rd

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.560
and the Delta variant was not identified
until April 28th.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.360
- This is all true,
but it is also true that the role

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.360
of variants in the India crisis
was known earlier in April and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.720
that people in mid-April were
urging the prime minister to act

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.760
and, whatever the rights and wrongs
of the government's decision here,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.080
Boris Johnson was following a pattern.
At the start of the pandemic,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.640
he locked down England later than
many European countries.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.280
In the autumn, he locked down later than
his scientific advisers suggested.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.600
In December, he resisted calls for
more restrictions at Christmas,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.680
then changed his mind. And again
here, he acted later than he

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.320
might have. The question is, what
was the impact of doing that?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.840
By mid-May the opposition
was making these accusations.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.800
- They should have put India on the
red list at the same time as Pakistan

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.680
and as Bangladesh. Since then we've
had this three-week period in which

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.600
thousands of people have returned
from India and that probably includes

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.720
hundreds of new variant Covid cases.
&nbsp;

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.640
- But does this add up? Can April's decisions
be connected with what's happening now?

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.440
Well, Delta does account for
more than 90% of

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.320
new cases in England. This is
one former government adviser.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.560
- We are in the grip of the early stages of a third wave
of the virus and it is this Delta variant.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.800
We've got 7,000 cases on
average a day at the moment and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.360
a doubling time which is
somewhere around a week.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.840
- And then this is a current UK government
adviser on whether the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.920
red list decision mattered.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.560
- This India Delta variant is now
quite common around the globe.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.480
So it would have ended up in the
United Kingdom at some point.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.600
But perhaps it would have been
delayed and

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.320
it's really the competition between the
between the virus and the vaccine.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.440
So had the variant arrived in the country
when we'd had more people vaccinated

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.480
then it may well not have grown
in the same way that it has.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.000
- In other words, to some extent,
timing did matter.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.720
But it's not the whole story.
Look at these dates.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.080
The UAE brought in extra restrictions
on travel from India on 22nd April

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.960
France was the 24th,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.240
the US 4th May.
And remember the UK was 23rd April.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.000
It wasn't out of sync
with these countries.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.400
More broadly, the WHO says
Delta is in over 60 countries.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.640
So why is the UK
particularly affected?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.760
This is helpful from Dr Jeffrey
Barrett, a leading geneticist.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.600
He is quoted in the Independent and
says: 'If you get one introduction,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.440
even of a transmissible variant,
there is a decent chance

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.480
it fizzles out and doesn't
create a big outbreak.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.200
If you get 100, 500
or 1,000 introductions,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.560
it's very hard to avoid that some
of them will go on to seed big outbreaks.'

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.400
All of which feeds into
the ongoing arguments over the

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.720
timing of the red list decision.
Arguments that have an urgency,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.560
because Delta's becoming more
and more of an issue and the

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.800
message from scientists is
it won't be the only one.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.840
- There's no question
that when we have this

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.880
conversation in six months' time

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.120
we'll be talking about different
variants.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.160
- And how governments manage variants will have a
huge bearing on how much Covid disrupts our lives.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.920
We've seen that with Delta.
It would have reached the UK anyway.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.760
But decisions in April
do help to explain why England's

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.040
Covid restrictions will not be
eased on June 21st.
