00:29:51.064 --> 00:29:54.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  WE ARE GOING TO THE 
CAPITOL. WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:58.141
GIVE THEM  THE KIND OF PRIDE AND
BOLDNESS THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE 

00:29:58.364 --> 00:30:00.849
BACK OUR COUNTRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT 

00:30:01.077 --> 00:30:03.977
OF THE UNITED STATES, IS 
IMPEACHED FOR HIGH CRIMES AND 

00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:06.203
MISDEMEANORS. ARTICLE 1

00:30:08.423 --> 00:30:10.534
, INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MOST REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO

00:30:11.035 --> 00:30:13.035
BE --

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.200
AND THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR IS 
NOT EXCITEMENT UNDER THE LAW. 

00:30:18.434 --> 00:30:20.986
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS WILL DECIDE ON THE 
ONE, TRUE QUESTION AT STAKE IN 

00:30:21.214 --> 00:30:26.423
THIS TRIAL. IS DONALD TRUMP 
GUILTY OF INCITING A VIOLENT MOB

00:30:26.777 --> 00:30:29.329
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.

00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:40.659
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE LOOKING AT LIVE 
PICTURES OF THE U.S. CAPITOL 

00:30:40.897 --> 00:30:46.418
WHICH HOUSES BOTH THE COURT OF 
IMPEACHMENT AND  THE SCENE OF 

00:30:46.646 --> 00:30:48.646
THE CHARGE AT HAND. INCITEMENT 
OF AN INSTRUCTION. PROSECUTORS 

00:30:48.866 --> 00:30:51.164
HAVE EIGHT MORE HOURS TODAY TO 
MAKE THEIR CASE CHARGING DONALD 

00:30:51.395 --> 00:30:53.531
J TRUMP WITH HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS. THIS IS A 

00:30:53.763 --> 00:30:57.354
WASHINGTON POST SPECIAL REPORT. 
I'M LIBBY CASEY. HOUSE MANAGERS 

00:30:57.595 --> 00:30:59.595
HAVE ARGUED THE ATTACK WAS 
PREDICTABLE AND FORESEEABLE

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.725
BECAUSE OF THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT'S PROVOCATIONS. TODAY 

00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:11.808
THEY WILL CONCLUDE THEIR CASE BY
FOCUSING ON JOHN'S WORDS, 

00:31:12.035 --> 00:31:14.109
ACTIONS AND LACK OF REMORSE. 
WITH ME NOW, CAPITOL HILL 

00:31:14.338 --> 00:31:16.202
REPORTER RHONDA COLEMAN, JOYCE 
CO., POLITICAL REPORTER AND 

00:31:16.203 --> 00:31:18.203
JAMES COLEMAN

00:31:20.989 --> 00:31:23.222
, WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST. 
RHONDA, THE SENATE NEEDS A TWO 

00:31:23.451 --> 00:31:25.554
THIRDS MAJORITY TO CONVICT 
DONALD TRUMP. THIS TRIAL IS TO 

00:31:25.792 --> 00:31:29.259
BUILD A CASE TO SHOW THE 
EVIDENCE BUT ALSO TO BUILD 

00:31:29.673 --> 00:31:32.125
PUBLIC PRESSURE TO FORCE THE 
SENATE TO ACT. WHAT ARE YOU 

00:31:32.362 --> 00:31:35.233
HEARING ON CAPITOL HILL AFTER 
YESTERDAY'S REALLY HARROWING 

00:31:35.664 --> 00:31:37.676
RETELLING OF THE EVENTS OF 
JANUARY 6? 

00:31:37.677 --> 00:31:39.677
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:44.149
A LOT OF SENATORS, WHAT THEY 
WITNESSED BY LOOKING AT THE 

00:31:44.408 --> 00:31:50.534
VIDEOS, THAN EVER BEFORE SEEN 
SECURITY VIDEOS REALLY TOOK A 

00:31:50.768 --> 00:31:52.768
LOT OF SENATORS BACK TO JANUARY 
6.

00:31:56.667 --> 00:31:59.675
AND WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS THAT 
YES, THEY WERE SHAKEN AND YES IT

00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:02.829
WAS DIFFICULT TO WATCH. BUT YET 
WE ARE NOT SEEING SIGNS YET THAT

00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:05.349
TO THE 17 NEEDED TO JOIN 
DEMOCRATS IN A CONVICTION VOTE 

00:32:05.582 --> 00:32:07.582
WILL HAPPEN. THAT HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN AN UPHILL BATTLE

00:32:11.952 --> 00:32:14.174
IN THIS IMPEACHMENT. ARGUMENT, A
LOT OF REPUBLICANS STARTED OFF 

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.777
IN THE WEEKS AHEAD OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT SAYING THIS WAS NOT 

00:32:17.005 --> 00:32:19.005
CONSTITUTIONAL. THAT IS WHAT 
EARLIER THIS WEEK, WHEN THEY 

00:32:19.117 --> 00:32:21.954
TOOK A DAY TO EXAMINE IT, THEY 
WERE CONTINUING TO SAY THAT. 

00:32:22.177 --> 00:32:24.177
THAT THIS IS NOT A CASE THAT HAS

00:32:34.117 --> 00:32:36.196
ANY MERIT BECAUSE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT. SO

00:32:36.428 --> 00:32:39.422
A LOT OF THEM ARE STILL STICKING
TO THAT, SAYING THAT SORT OF THE

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.963
OFFRAMP RIGHT NOW THAT THEY 
DON'T THINK THIS CASE HAS MERIT 

00:32:42.214 --> 00:32:44.662
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT IS NOT 
CONSTITUTIONAL. BUT THERE IS NO 

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.900
DENYING THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS
YESTERDAY HAD A VERY STRONG 

00:32:46.974 --> 00:32:48.974
CASE. THEY SPENT THE WHOLE DAY

00:32:55.555 --> 00:32:57.650
DISSECTING THE WORDS OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS IN 

00:32:57.878 --> 00:33:00.976
FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE TELLING
THE CROWD TO GO DOWN TO THE 

00:33:01.208 --> 00:33:03.880
CAPITOL, TELLING THE CROWD THAT 
HE WOULD BE WITH THEM, WE WILL 

00:33:04.108 --> 00:33:06.879
BE WITH YOU. EVEN THOUGH THAT 
DID NOT ACCORD. AND THEY WERE 

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:09.119
ABLE, THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS WERE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT 

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:11.817
THE TIMELINE  USING THE FOOTAGE 
WE HAVE SEEN AND ALSO THE 

00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:14.379
FOOTAGE WE HAVE NOT SEEN FROM 
SECURITY CAMERAS. AND WE WERE 

00:33:14.609 --> 00:33:17.343
ABLE TO SEE SORT OF ALL THE 
PUZZLE PIECES COME TOGETHER, HOW

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.883
THE INSURRECTIONIST HAD A LOT OF
PLANNING. THEY WERE IN TACTICAL 

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:22.679
GEAR, THEY HAD STUN GUNS, THEY 
HAD ZIP TIES, THEY HAD MATERIALS

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:25.057
THAT SHOWED THIS WAS SOMETHING 
THAT WAS MORE PLANNED THAN 

00:33:25.296 --> 00:33:27.296
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. THAN THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS BROUGHT ALL

00:33:27.312 --> 00:33:29.381
OF THE ARGUMENTS TOGETHER LAST 
NIGHT. ALSO POINTING OUT THAT 

00:33:29.614 --> 00:33:31.936
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS IN VERY
CRITICAL DANGER. THEY SHOWED 

00:33:32.168 --> 00:33:34.985
SCENES OF HIM BEING USHERED OFF 
TO A SAFE ROOM AND REALLY WANTED

00:33:35.218 --> 00:33:39.844
TO USE THE PRESENCE OF MIKE 
PENCE HERE ON THE HILL THAT DAY 

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:43.062
AS A WAY TO TELL REPUBLICANS IN 
THE SENATE THAT THIS IS -- THE 

00:33:43.292 --> 00:33:45.393
VICE PRESIDENT FROM YOUR PARTY 
AND HIS RUNNING MATE, SOMEONE

00:33:56.696 --> 00:33:59.534
HE STOOD BY FOR 4 YEARS DID NOT 
ACT TO PROTECT THEM. INSTEAD, 

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:02.122
RAMPED UP THE CROWD, TALKING 
ABOUT HOW MIKE PENCE SHOULD HELP

00:34:02.357 --> 00:34:04.512
THEM OUT. AND INTERRUPT THE 
PROCEEDINGS ON JANUARY 6 TO 

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:07.235
CERTIFY BIDEN AS THE ELECTION 
WINNER. SO ALL OF THESE THINGS 

00:34:07.465 --> 00:34:09.643
WERE BROUGHT BACK OUT IN VIVID 
DETAIL BY THE IMPEACHMENT 

00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:12.174
MANAGERS YESTERDAY. SO THEY LAID
OUT THEIR CASE ACCORDING -- THEY

00:34:12.402 --> 00:34:14.752
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND 
SHOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.461
NOT SHOWN ANY REMORSE OR 
CONTRITION FOR THE ACTIONS AND 

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:20.735
THAT IS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO 
LEAVE IT TODAY. THIS IS THE LAST

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.290
DAY WE WILL SEE THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS. THEY CLOSE OUT THEIR 

00:34:23.537 --> 00:34:25.537
ARGUMENT AND WE WILL SEE

00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:29.993
THE DEFENSE TEAM OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, THEY COULD POSSIBLY START

00:34:30.221 --> 00:34:32.325
TODAY BUT THEY WILL LIKELY START
IN EARNEST TOMORROW. 

00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:34.861
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE SEEING IN ONE BOK 
CENTER SCREEN IMAGES OF NATIONAL

00:34:35.096 --> 00:34:37.674
GUARD TROOPS STILL IN THE 
HOLLOWS OF THE CAPITOL.  WHAT IS

00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:41.275
IT LIKE THIS MORNING? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE STILL HERE. THAT IS 

00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:43.516
SOMETHING WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT 
DURING THE

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:50.863
INAUGURATION OF JOE BIDEN. THAT 
THERE WAS A HEAVY PRESENCE OF 

00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:53.190
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND WOMEN. 
BUT THEY ARE STILL VERY MUCH 

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.508
THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL. YOU 
CANNOT  BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE 

00:34:55.738 --> 00:34:58.046
CAPITOL OR THE OFFICE BUILDINGS 
FOR SENATE AND HOUSE MEMBERS 

00:34:58.273 --> 00:35:02.289
VERY EASILY. THEIR SKATES ALL 
AROUND THE PERIMETER THAT EXTEND

00:35:02.518 --> 00:35:04.608
BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE CAPITOL. 
THERE'S EXITS AND ENTRANCES THAT

00:35:04.915 --> 00:35:06.915
ONLY 

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.862
YOU CAN COME THROUGH IF YOU HAVE
A BADGE. LIKE WE DO AS MEMBERS 

00:35:12.102 --> 00:35:14.196
OF THE PRESS. AND OF COURSE, 
STAFFERS AND MEMBERS OF 

00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:16.936
CONGRESS. BUT IT IS JUST A 
REMINDER THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH 

00:35:17.171 --> 00:35:19.378
A CRIME SCENE. IT IS AN 
IMPEACHMENT THAT IS HAPPENING 

00:35:19.628 --> 00:35:21.918
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A VERY 
OPEN INVESTIGATION. THE FBI IS 

00:35:22.143 --> 00:35:25.148
INVESTIGATING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
HERE. SO THERE ARE MORE DETAILS 

00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:27.667
EMERGING BECAUSE OF WHAT 
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6. BUT IF 

00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:29.891
YOU

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.940
WANT TO HAVE ANY SORT OF 
REMINDER, PHYSICAL REMINDERS OF 

00:35:34.163 --> 00:35:36.945
JANUARY 6, THEY ARE VERY MUCH 
HERE ON THE HILL. IT IS VERY 

00:35:37.173 --> 00:35:39.247
HEAVILY PROTECTED AND WE HAVE 
HEARD D.C. OFFICIALS HAVE ASKED 

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.510
THAT WE

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:45.819
HAVE GATES BROUGHT DOWN 
EVENTUALLY. WE KNOW THE ACTING 

00:35:45.905 --> 00:35:48.469
CHIEF OF POLICE, THE CHIEF OF 
THE CAPITOL POLICE HAS SAID THEY

00:35:48.704 --> 00:35:50.704
NEED TO STAY UP.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.380
THE DISTURBING MATERIALS THEY 
SEE FROM FBI REPORTS, THEY WANT 

00:35:56.609 --> 00:35:59.171
TO KEEP SECURITY IN THE 
STRUCTURE UP FOR A A WHILE. 

00:35:59.172 --> 00:36:01.748
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LET'S GO TO YOU. ARE 
WE SENSING MOVEMENT OR HEARING 

00:36:01.974 --> 00:36:03.974
OF ANY MOVEMENT

00:36:13.244 --> 00:36:15.530
ON BEHALF OF REPUBLICANS, AS 
THEY WEIGH THE EVIDENCE AND HAVE

00:36:15.763 --> 00:36:17.874
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO 
CONVICT DONALD TRUMP? 

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:20.200
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, IT WAS DEFINITELY A 
POWERFUL MOMENT THAT REPUBLICANS

00:36:20.433 --> 00:36:22.995
COULD NOT LOOK AWAY FROM. THE 
HOURS OF VIDEO, THE NEVER BEFORE

00:36:23.358 --> 00:36:25.429
SEEN VIDEO THAT FEATURED THEM. 
THE PEOPLE WHO SEEMED MOST 

00:36:25.658 --> 00:36:28.013
MOVED, WHERE THE ONES MOST 
WILLING TO CONVICT. WE SAW LISA 

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.336
MURKOWSKI, THE REPUBLICAN FROM 
ALASKA LAST NIGHT, SAY THAT THE 

00:36:30.576 --> 00:36:32.908
CASE IS QUITE COMPELLING. MITT 
ROMNEY, WE SAW VIDEO OF HIM 

00:36:33.145 --> 00:36:35.398
WALKING TOWARD THE MOB AND 
OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN TURNING 

00:36:35.624 --> 00:36:37.624
HIM AROUND AND

00:36:43.241 --> 00:36:45.963
MET ROMNEY RUNNING AWAY. A LOT 
OF THE VIDEOS OF CLOSE CALLS, 

00:36:46.187 --> 00:36:48.267
FEATURED CHUCK SCHUMER WHO 
OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO END UP 

00:36:48.502 --> 00:36:50.828
CONVICTING AS DEMOCRATIC LEADER.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE IN

00:36:51.054 --> 00:36:53.054
THE LAST 12 HOURS THAT 
REPUBLICANS, WHO ARE INCLINED 

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.835
NOT TO CONVICT HAVE MOVED. WE 
HAVE HEARD A COUPLE OF 

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.154
REPUBLICANS SAY IT WAS DEEPLY 
MOVING AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO

00:36:58.384 --> 00:37:01.207
EMPHASIZE PROCEDURAL OBJECTIONS 
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY 

00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:05.265
GRAPPLE WITH THE UNDERLYING 
BEHAVIOR BY THE PRESIDENT. WE 

00:37:05.496 --> 00:37:07.496
ARE ALSO SEEING

00:37:10.363 --> 00:37:12.453
AN INCREASING EMPHASIS BY 
REPUBLICANS, LED BY TED CRUZ TO 

00:37:12.686 --> 00:37:14.686
SAY THAT WHAT HAPPENED DOESN'T

00:37:18.425 --> 00:37:20.425
MEET THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF 
INSURRECTION. THIS IS SOMETHING 

00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.314
WE ARE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT 
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, 

00:37:23.582 --> 00:37:25.886
ESPECIALLY FROM THE PRESIDENT 
DEFENSE TEAM. TO SAY BY ANY KIND

00:37:26.118 --> 00:37:31.265
OF LEGAL STANDARD -- BRANDENBURG
V OHIO, WHAT THE PRESIDENT IT 

00:37:31.496 --> 00:37:33.496
DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD OF

00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:44.621
INSTRUCTION. YOU SAW JAMIE 
RASKIN TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT 

00:37:44.734 --> 00:37:47.406
WITH HIS REP ABOUT FIRE IN A 
CROWDED THEATER. THIS IS WORSE 

00:37:47.648 --> 00:37:50.548
THAN YELLING FIRE IN A CROWDED 
THEATER. IT IS LIKE A FIRE CHIEF

00:37:50.784 --> 00:37:53.041
SETTING FIRE TO A CROWDED 
THEATER AND NOT SENDING HELP. 

00:37:53.274 --> 00:37:55.274
YOU SEE REPUBLICANS KIND OF 
SQUIRMING. YOU SEE SOME 

00:37:55.388 --> 00:37:57.032
CERTAINLY UNCOMFORTABLE PEOPLE 
LIKE JAMES LANKFORD FROM 

00:37:57.033 --> 00:37:59.190
OKLAHOMA. USE THE BILL CASSIDY 
FROM LOUISIANA MOVE ON THE 

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.430
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION, HIS 
VOTE SEEMS

00:38:05.387 --> 00:38:07.523
AN IMPLANT FINAL CONVECTION. 
RIGHT NOW IT DOES SEEM LIKE 

00:38:07.758 --> 00:38:09.881
THERE IS NO MORE THAN SEVEN 
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOOKING 

00:38:10.115 --> 00:38:12.239
SERIOUSLY AT CONVICTION, EVEN 
AFTER THAT DAY OF HUNTING VIDEO 

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:16.520
EVIDENCE. THAT THESE JURORS WERE
WATCHING AT THE SCENE OF THE 

00:38:16.754 --> 00:38:18.716
CRIME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT 

00:38:18.717 --> 00:38:22.537
LINDSEY GRAHAM, THERE IS NO 
ANTICIPATION THAT HE WOULD MOVE 

00:38:22.763 --> 00:38:24.903
AWAY FROM SUPPORTING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AT THIS POINT. BUT HE'S 

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.636
ACTUALLY GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY 
OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. 

00:38:28.194 --> 00:38:31.175
IS DOUBLING DOWN AND WAS ON 
TELEVISION LAST NIGHT AND 

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:33.409
TWEETING AND SAYING THAT HE 
THINKS MORE REPUBLICANS ARE 

00:38:33.512 --> 00:38:38.216
MOVING TOWARD NOT GUILTY BECAUSE
HE CALLED THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

00:38:38.442 --> 00:38:40.749
PRESENTATION OFFENSIVE AND 
ABSURD. 

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.057
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS AN EFFORT BY PEOPLE 
LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM TO HOLD ON 

00:38:44.296 --> 00:38:48.741
TO THE SWING VOTES. BECAUSE THEY
DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE MOST 

00:38:48.979 --> 00:38:52.143
BIPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY. AND YOU ARE 

00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:54.997
SEEING PRESSURE FROM 
CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.876
. HUGH HEWITT THIS MORNING, RICK
SCOTT FROM FLORIDA WAS SAYING 

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:04.056
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO PULL 
PEOPLE AWAY FROM VOTING FOR 

00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:08.156
CONVICTION BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM
LOOK BAD. IF SOME OF THE 

00:39:08.395 --> 00:39:11.655
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ARE VOTING
TO CONVICT. SO YOU'RE DEFINITELY

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.462
SEEING SORT OF A WHIPPING EFFORT
UNDERWAY. ONE OF THE PEOPLE

00:39:19.235 --> 00:39:21.674
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 
WATCHING AFTER JANUARY 6, IS 

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:23.821
MITCH McCONNELL, REPUBLICAN 
LEADER WHO HAD SIGNALED OPENNESS

00:39:23.822 --> 00:39:28.574
TO POTENTIALLY VOTING TO REMOVE 
TRUMP FROM OFFICE AND HAS BACKED

00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:31.543
AWAY FROM THAT. I HEARD FROM A 
CLOSE TRUMP ALLY THAT THEY 

00:39:31.775 --> 00:39:33.775
EXPECT McCONNELL WILL ULTIMATELY
VOTE TO NOT CONVICT THE 

00:39:33.921 --> 00:39:36.471
PRESIDENT BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE 
THE BASE OF THE PARTY IS AND 

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.710
WHERE THE MEMBERS ARE. YOU ARE 
SEEING

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.567
-- MIKE LEE, THE WEIRD EPISODE 
AT THE END OF THE EVENING WHERE 

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.367
THE SENATOR FROM UTAH STOOD UP 
AND OBJECTED TO HIS NAME BEING 

00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:50.601
CITED

00:39:53.102 --> 00:39:55.738
BY THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. I 
THINK THAT IS PART OF AN EFFORT 

00:39:55.974 --> 00:39:57.847
TO LASER THE PROCEDURAL 
GROUNDWORK TO COMPLAIN THAT 

00:39:57.848 --> 00:40:00.294
THERE WASN'T -- THERE WEREN'T'S 
DEPOSITION, THERE WEREN'T 

00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:04.352
HEARINGS, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR 
EXCUSES TO BE ABLE TO GO VOTE TO

00:40:04.587 --> 00:40:07.863
ACQUIT TRUMP BECAUSE THE 
EVIDENCE THAT WAS LAID OUT 

00:40:08.091 --> 00:40:10.432
YESTERDAY WAS QUITE DAMNING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVEN AS SEMINARS ARE

00:40:15.252 --> 00:40:17.617
PROCESSING WHAT THEY WITNESSED 
YESTERDAY IN THE TRIAL, SOME ARE

00:40:17.845 --> 00:40:20.708
AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THAT IS 
WHERE WE CAN FIND OUR COLLEAGUE 

00:40:20.944 --> 00:40:22.944
JOYCE.

00:40:25.806 --> 00:40:28.498
TELL US, WHAT ARE SENATORS DOING
AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY? WHAT 

00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:30.733
IS ON THE AGENDA? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT BIDEN AND VICE 

00:40:30.854 --> 00:40:32.941
PRESIDENT HARRIS HAVE HAD A BUSY
SCHEDULE AS THE IMPEACHMENT 

00:40:33.176 --> 00:40:35.271
TRIAL CONTINUES. THIS MORNING 
THEY WERE IN THE OVAL OFFICE 

00:40:35.503 --> 00:40:37.519
WITH A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF 
SENATORS, SENATOR KAPPEL, 

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.750
IMHOFF,

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.405
CARPER WERE IN THE ROOM WITH THE
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT TO 

00:40:46.654 --> 00:40:48.302
DISCUSS INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CALLS 

00:40:48.303 --> 00:40:50.213
CRITICAL NEED TO ADDRESS BOTH 
MODERN AND SUSTAINABLE 

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:52.082
INFRASTRUCTURE. BEFORE THAT 
MEETING PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE 

00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:57.229
WAS ON THE PHONE WITH XI JINPING
WITH CHINA YESTERDAY AND HE SAID

00:40:57.468 --> 00:41:00.684
CHINA IS ALREADY INVESTING 
WILLIAMS OF DOLLARS INTO 

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:05.418
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRANSPORTATION
ALL MEASURES. AND HE SAYS IT IS 

00:41:05.658 --> 00:41:09.726
WHAT HE WANTS TO BE DOING IN HIS
ADMINISTRATION AND HIS

00:41:17.851 --> 00:41:19.937
ADMINISTRATION HAS PRIORITY TO 
BE DOING. AND TALKING ABOUT THE 

00:41:20.183 --> 00:41:22.183
COMPETITION WITH CHINA. HE WAS 
ASKED ABOUT OF COURSE 

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.827
IMPEACHMENT BY REPORTERS IN THAT
ROOM. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE 

00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:28.159
HAD TO SAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I TOLD YOU, I'M FOCUSED ON MY

00:41:28.398 --> 00:41:32.376
JOB, TO DEAL WITH THE PROMISES I
MADE. WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TO 

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:37.677
MOVE ON. TODAY IT IS ABOUT JOBS 
AND INFRASTRUCTURE. I, LIKE 

00:41:37.907 --> 00:41:42.740
OTHER AMERICANS WATCHED THE 
NEWS. I DIDN'T WATCH ANY OF THE 

00:41:42.973 --> 00:41:47.292
HEARING BECAUSE I WAS GOING 
STRAIGHT THROUGH LAST NIGHT TO A

00:41:47.531 --> 00:41:50.134
LITTLE AFTER 9:00. I WATCHED 
THIS MORNING. I THINK THE SENATE

00:41:50.368 --> 00:41:57.645
HAS A VERY IMPORTANT JOB TO 
COMPLETE. AND I THINK THAT MY 

00:41:57.877 --> 00:42:00.679
GUESS IS THAT SOME MINDS MAY 
HAVE BEEN CHANGED BUT I DON'T 

00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:04.393
KNOW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE ADMINISTRATION, THE BIDEN

00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:06.625
ADMINISTRATION'S

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.873
'S MAIN POINT ON IMPEACHMENT, AS
THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED THE 

00:42:11.108 --> 00:42:15.209
QUESTIONS OF WHETHER HE'S 
WATCHING THE TRIAL, AND 

00:42:15.443 --> 00:42:17.810
RESPONDING TO THE DAY TODAY NEWS
THAT IS COMING OUT ON 

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.808
IMPEACHMENT HAS BEEN TO LARGELY 
STAY OUT OF THE STORY LINE. THEY

00:42:21.037 --> 00:42:23.734
ARE SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT JOE
BIDEN IS FOCUSED ON HIS AGENDA, 

00:42:23.968 --> 00:42:26.124
MAINLY CORONAVIRUS. AND AS YOU 
CAN SEE, INFRASTRUCTURE. THE 

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.586
ADMINISTRATION DID SEND OUT A 
COPY OF THE LETTER THAT BIDEN 

00:42:31.827 --> 00:42:34.400
HAD SENT OVER TO CONGRESS THIS 
MORNING. THAT WAS ALL ABOUT THE 

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.079
U.S./MEXICO BORDER WALL. JOE 
BIDEN SAYS HE WILL BE 

00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:41.979
TERMINATING THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

00:42:42.223 --> 00:42:44.967
HAD SET IN PLACE ON THAT 
SOUTHERN BORDER WALL, CALLING IT

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.264
UNWARRANTED AND SAYING NO MORE 
AMERICAN TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD

00:42:48.495 --> 00:42:51.915
BE SPENT ON THE BORDER WALL, 
THERE. LIBBY. 

00:42:51.916 --> 00:42:53.916
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.220
JOYCE KOH OUTSIDE THE WHITE 
HOUSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S 

00:43:00.448 --> 00:43:03.378
GO BACK TO ROUND AT THE CAPITOL.
IF THE SENATE  COULD SOMEHOW 

00:43:03.615 --> 00:43:05.717
MANAGE TO GET TO THAT 67 VOTE 
THRESHOLD TO CONVICT

00:43:15.548 --> 00:43:17.548
DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS LOOKING 
UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF WHERE 

00:43:17.699 --> 00:43:19.820
REPUBLICANS ARE STANDING AT THIS
POINT, AFTER THAT THEY COULD 

00:43:20.051 --> 00:43:22.659
THEN VOTE ON WHETHER TO BAR HIM 
FROM HOLDING OFFICE IN THE 

00:43:22.895 --> 00:43:25.692
FUTURE. IT TURNS OUT THAT WOULD 
REQUIRE A SIMPLE MAJORITY. IF IT

00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:28.127
CAME DOWN TO PARTY LINES, 
DEMOCRATS COULD PREVAIL WITH THE

00:43:28.358 --> 00:43:30.796
HELP OF VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA 
HARRIS. IF THAT IS THE DECISION 

00:43:31.029 --> 00:43:33.659
THE WAY HAS MADE, THAT SHE WOULD
CAST THAT TIE-BREAKING VOTE. SO 

00:43:33.906 --> 00:43:36.395
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REALITY OF 
DONALD TRUMP'S ROLE IN THE 

00:43:36.644 --> 00:43:38.644
REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW AND 
HOW REPUBLICANS ARE THINKING 

00:43:38.768 --> 00:43:41.994
ABOUT HIM AS A STANDARDBEARER OR
SOMEONE FROM THE PAST. 

00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:44.369
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, REPUBLICANS ARE
KIND OF TAKING THEIR TIME, STILL

00:43:44.604 --> 00:43:47.609
TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS 
POST TRUMP ERA IS FOR THEM. DO 

00:43:47.851 --> 00:43:51.449
THEY STAY CLOSELY LOYAL TO HIM 
IN ORDER TO WIN SEATS IN 2020 OR

00:43:51.819 --> 00:43:53.819
DO THEY

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.808
START NOT ATTACHING ANY MORE TO 
THAT LOYALTY AND HIS AGENDA AND 

00:44:05.039 --> 00:44:07.381
TRUMPISM, OVER ALL. AND THIS IS 
WHY THIS IMPEACHMENT AND THE 

00:44:07.616 --> 00:44:09.975
TIMING OF IT IS SO IMPORTANT. 
BECAUSE EVEN WITHOUT IT, SENATE 

00:44:10.229 --> 00:44:12.229
REPUBLICANS WOULD STILL BE 
TASKED WITH FIGURING OUT THE 

00:44:12.484 --> 00:44:15.343
FUTURE OF THEIR PARTY. DROUGHT 
THE LAST 4 YEARS, AND ALL OF THE

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:17.692
HEARINGS I HAVE COVERED, ON THE 
HILL AND SEEING REPUBLICAN 

00:44:17.929 --> 00:44:21.018
STANDBY THE PRESIDENT, THIS TIME
WHERE HE IS NO LONGER IN THE 

00:44:21.252 --> 00:44:23.455
WHITE HOUSE COULD BE A TIME 
WHERE SENATE REPUBLICANS

00:44:28.058 --> 00:44:30.220
AND REPUBLICANS OVERALL COULD 
ADJUST THEIR PARTY A LITTLE BIT.

00:44:30.447 --> 00:44:33.218
AND FIGURE OUT THE NEW WAY 
FORWARD. BUT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE 

00:44:33.452 --> 00:44:35.813
PUT IN A VERY WEIRD POSITION 
WHERE THEY ARE FACED WITH 

00:44:36.057 --> 00:44:38.733
TRUMPISM, FACED WITH THESE 
FOOTAGES FROM THE SCENES OF 

00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:42.421
JANUARY 6. THEY ARE FACED WITH 
SEEING THE RHETORIC PLAY OVER 

00:44:42.656 --> 00:44:45.854
AND OVER AGAIN OF WHAT HE SAID 
ABOUT MIKE PENCE. THAT LED UP TO

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.090
THE EVENTS, HERE.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.569
SO THIS IS ADDING TO SOMETHING 
THAT WAS ALREADY UNDERWAY, THAT 

00:44:56.804 --> 00:44:59.176
THE REPUBLICANS WERE TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO FROM 

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.833
HERE. WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP. AND 
WHAT THE CALCULATION THAT MIGHT 

00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:05.055
BE AND HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT THEM 
AND THEIR ODDS IN 2022. 

00:45:05.056 --> 00:45:11.032
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, THE WHITE HOUSE, AS WE
HEARD FROM JOYCE HAS NO APPETITE

00:45:11.264 --> 00:45:14.087
TO GET INVOLVED. THEY WILL LET 
THE TRAIN ROLL AHEAD AND TRY TO 

00:45:14.325 --> 00:45:16.391
SORT OF KEEP THE BIDEN/HARRIS 
TEAM PROTECTED FROM THIS 

00:45:16.642 --> 00:45:18.642
POLITICALLY. BUT WHAT WE KNOW 
ABOUT ANY INVOLVEMENT THAT 

00:45:18.789 --> 00:45:22.184
KAMALA HARRIS MIGHT TAKE IN A 
TIEBREAKER SITUATION. THAT 

00:45:22.413 --> 00:45:25.354
CERTAINLY HAS BEEN FLOATED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS NOT A NORMAL LIKE 

00:45:25.675 --> 00:45:29.204
SENATE PROCEDURE. LIKE WE SAW 
LAST NIGHT WHEN MIKE LEE STOOD 

00:45:29.618 --> 00:45:33.975
UP AND SENATORS CAN'T REALLY 
OBJECT DURING AN IMPEACHMENT 

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.504
TRIAL THAT THE WAY THEY CAN 
DURING A NORMAL SESSION

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.678
OF THE SENATE. THAT SAID, IF 
THERE IS A TIE SHE CAN BREAK THE

00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:47.616
TIE. SHE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
SENATE AND PAT LEAHY AS 

00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:51.706
PRESIDENT PRO TEM, IS ACTING AS 
THE PRESIDING OFFICER. BUT 

00:45:51.937 --> 00:45:53.937
HARRIS COULD CERTAINLY BE CALLED
UPON BY

00:46:01.367 --> 00:46:04.196
-- HYPOTHETICALLY IF THERE IS A 
VOTE TO HAVE WITNESSES, IT IS A 

00:46:04.426 --> 00:46:06.833
SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE AND IF ALL 
THE REPUBLICANS -- ALL THE 

00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:09.081
DEMOCRATS DECIDED TO HAVE 
WITNESSES, HARRIS COULD END UP 

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.205
NEEDING TO BREAK THE TIE. ON THE
OTHER HAND IT IS LIKELY YOU 

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.546
WOULD HAVE A COUPLE OF 
REPUBLICANS WHO ALSO WERE OPEN 

00:46:14.779 --> 00:46:17.154
TO HAVING WITNESSES, SOMEONE 
LIKE MITT ROMNEY. SO SHE MAY NOT

00:46:21.635 --> 00:46:24.130
BE CALLED UPON. THE WAREHOUSE IS
TRYING TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE. 

00:46:24.362 --> 00:46:26.984
OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN'T PRETEND IT 
IS NOT HAPPENING AT ALL. HE SAW 

00:46:27.214 --> 00:46:30.042
PRESIDENT BIDEN TRY TO THREAD 
THE NEEDLE IN THE CLIP WE SAW A 

00:46:30.286 --> 00:46:32.286
MOMENT AGO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING IN MATTEO GOLD, 

00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:34.311
INVESTIGATION EDITOR AT THE WILL
WASHINGTON POST. GOOD MORNING 

00:46:34.422 --> 00:46:36.737
AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS MY PLEASURE. 

00:46:36.738 --> 00:46:39.334
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO HELLO UP ON 
REPUBLICANS AND WHERE TRUMPETS 

00:46:39.566 --> 00:46:42.142
IN. OUR COLLEAGUE, IN HER 
NEWSLETTER REPORTED THAT SENATOR

00:46:46.905 --> 00:46:49.037
MARCO RUBIO HAS SAID THIS, TRUMP
REMAINS THE MOST POPULAR 

00:46:49.271 --> 00:46:51.271
REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY.

00:46:53.724 --> 00:46:55.598
WE ALSO HEARD SENATOR LISA 
MURKOWSKI, REPUBLICAN, TALKING 

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:58.240
TO REPORTERS LAST NIGHT AND SHE 
SAID SHE DOESN'T SEE HOW AMERICA

00:46:58.469 --> 00:47:00.469
WOULD HAVE THE APPETITE

00:47:02.185 --> 00:47:04.455
, PARAPHRASING, TO RE-ELECT 
TRUMP AFTER WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN 

00:47:04.703 --> 00:47:07.529
OF THIS JANUARY 6 ATTACK AND THE
EVIDENCE THAT HAS COME OUT THIS 

00:47:07.763 --> 00:47:10.397
WEEK. SO WHAT IS THE ROLE AND 
RESPONSIBILITY OF REPUBLICANS, 

00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:12.729
VERSUS THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE 
AT THIS MOMENT IN FIGURING OUT 

00:47:12.962 --> 00:47:14.962
THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY?

00:47:18.456 --> 00:47:21.278
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THE REALITY IS ALWAYS
THAT POLITICS IS GOING TO GOVERN

00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:23.843
DECISIONS IN THIS AND THE 
REALITY IS THAT THE BASE IS 

00:47:24.076 --> 00:47:26.312
STILL VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT. WE HAVE SEEN 

00:47:26.546 --> 00:47:29.651
THIS PLAY OUT IN HOUSE DAY AND 
EVEN COUNTY PARTIES HAVE REACTED

00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:32.297
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, AS 
SOME STATE AND NATIONAL LEADERS 

00:47:32.535 --> 00:47:35.136
HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST 
TRANSACTIONS. REALLY THREATENING

00:47:35.366 --> 00:47:38.470
RETRIBUTION FOR THOSE WHO 
SUGGEST THEY MIGHT TRY TO HOLD 

00:47:38.698 --> 00:47:42.753
THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR 
HIS ACTIONS THAT LED TO THE 

00:47:42.981 --> 00:47:48.407
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL.  THAT IS 
JUST THE WORLD IN WHICH THESE 

00:47:48.639 --> 00:47:50.639
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE 
CONSIDERING THIS DECISION RIGHT 

00:47:50.811 --> 00:47:55.304
NOW AND I THINK EVEN SEE PEOPLE 
LIKE SENATOR ROB PORTMAN WHO IS 

00:47:55.544 --> 00:48:00.722
RETIRING, WHO IS JUST NOT 
WILLING TO SAY THAT THIS IS A 

00:48:00.957 --> 00:48:02.833
PROCEEDING IN WHICH HE COULD 
ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD 

00:48:02.834 --> 00:48:05.580
NECESSARILY WITH CONVICTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 

00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:11.182
THE VICE PRESIDENT. AND WHAT WE 
WITNESSED YESTERDAY.

00:48:14.974 --> 00:48:17.120
IN TERMS OF THE POLITICS OF 
THIS, THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:19.349
TRIED TO PRESENT A VERY CLEAR 
CHOICE

00:48:24.813 --> 00:48:27.437
FOR THE JURORS, THE SENATORS. 
ARE YOU ON THE SIDE OF DONALD 

00:48:27.682 --> 00:48:30.536
TRUMP OR ARE ON THE SIDE OF MIKE
PENCE. THEY TALKED ABOUT MIKE 

00:48:30.766 --> 00:48:32.892
PENCE BEING A PATRIOT, DOING HIS
DUTY. AND ALSO THOUGH, 

00:48:33.133 --> 00:48:35.407
OBJECTIVELY SEPARATE FROM THE 
POLITICS OF THIS, WERE ABLE TO 

00:48:35.659 --> 00:48:40.464
SHOW HOW TRULY DANGEROUS THE 
SITUATION WAS FOR THE VICE 

00:48:40.694 --> 00:48:42.789
PRESIDENT. SO LET'S WATCH SOME 
OF THAT NEW EVIDENCE YESTERDAY 

00:48:43.021 --> 00:48:44.883
AND IT STARTS OFF WITH 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER STACEY 

00:48:44.884 --> 00:48:46.492
PLASKETT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS 

00:48:46.493 --> 00:48:49.077
STILL IN THE ROOM, NEAR THE 
SENATE CHAMBER. IT WAS NOT UNTIL

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:56.455
2:26 THAT HE WAS EVACUATED TO A 
SECURE LOCATION. THIS NEXT 

00:48:56.684 --> 00:49:00.185
SECURITY VIDEO SHOWS THAT 
EVACUATION. HIS MOVEMENTS ARE 

00:49:00.417 --> 00:49:05.771
DEPICT DEAD BY THE ORANGE DOT IN
OUR MODEL. THE RED AND BLUE DOTS

00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:10.227
REPRESENT THE LOCATION WHERE THE
MOB AND OFFICER GOODMAN WERE AND

00:49:11.721 --> 00:49:14.106
ARE OFFICER GOODMAN LED THE MOB 
AWAY FROM THE CHAMBER, JUST 

00:49:14.564 --> 00:49:21.654
MOMENTS AGO. YOU CAN SEE 

00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:25.734
QUICKLY MOVE DOWN THE STAIRS. 
THE VICE PRESIDENT TURNS AROUND 

00:49:25.967 --> 00:49:27.967
BRIEFLY AS HE'S HEADED DOWN.

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:36.309
AS PENCE WAS BEING EVACUATED  
WRITERS STARTED TO SPREAD 

00:49:36.547 --> 00:49:43.794
THROUGH OUT THE CAPITOL.  THOSE 
INSIDE HELPED OTHER RIOTERS 

00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:46.199
BREAK IN THROUGH DOORS IN 
SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THIS 

00:49:46.636 --> 00:49:52.424
ENTIRE BUILDING. AND THE MOB WAS
LOOKING FOR VICE PRESIDENT PENCE

00:49:52.655 --> 00:49:57.594
BECAUSE OF HIS PATRIOTISM. 
BECAUSE THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD 

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:01.649
REFUSED TO DO WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S DEMAND AND OVERTURN 

00:50:02.597 --> 00:50:08.515
ELECTION RESULTS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MATEA, WALK US THROUGH THE 

00:50:08.745 --> 00:50:12.066
DANGER THAT MIKE  PENCE WAS IN 
AND WHAT WE REALLY LEARNED 

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.533
YESTERDAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAD ACTUALLY DONE A 

00:50:14.764 --> 00:50:17.581
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PERIL 
FACING THE VICE PRESIDENT 

00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:21.743
SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK. THE 
VIDEO THAT WAS RELEASED 

00:50:21.975 --> 00:50:23.975
YESTERDAY, AS PART OF THE 
PROCEEDINGS AUGMENTED OUR 

00:50:24.458 --> 00:50:30.358
UNDERSTANDING OF THE REALLY 
IMMENSE DANGER FACING MIKE PENCE

00:50:30.598 --> 00:50:33.849
IN THAT MOMENT. THE TIMELINE IS 
AS FOLLOWS. AT 2:12 PM, WE FIRST

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.080
HAVE EVIDENCE ON VIDEO

00:50:40.373 --> 00:50:42.742
OF THE RIOTERS CRASHING THROUGH 
AND BREAKING A WINDOW. A MINUTE 

00:50:42.972 --> 00:50:45.334
LATER, THEY ARE INSIDE THE 
CAPITOL.  AT THAT MOMENT, 2:13, 

00:50:45.578 --> 00:50:48.990
SECRET SERVICE QUICKLY HUSTLES 
MIKE PENCE FROM THE HALL OF THE 

00:50:49.225 --> 00:50:55.608
SENATE CHAMBER AND HE REMAINS 
INSIDE THAT ROOM WITH KEY 

00:50:56.079 --> 00:51:00.122
AND FAMILY MEMBERS GUARDED BY 
SECRET SERVICE AT THE DOOR PEAK

00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:08.379
. EVEN AS WRITERS ARE CHARGING 
TOWARD THE SENATE CHAMBER. THEY 

00:51:08.615 --> 00:51:11.698
COME WITHIN WE THINK 100 FEET OR
LESS OF THE ROOM IN WHICH THE 

00:51:11.934 --> 00:51:14.428
VICE PRESIDENT IS HIDING. AND 
THAT IS WHEN EUGENE GOODMAN, THE

00:51:14.668 --> 00:51:18.680
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER  VERY 
KEENLY STEERS THEM AWAY FROM THE

00:51:18.914 --> 00:51:21.543
SENATE CHAMBER AND AWAY FROM THE
ROOM WHERE THE VICE PRESIDENT IS

00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:25.080
SHELTERING. WHAT WE LEARNED 
YESTERDAY FROM THE VIDEO IS THE 

00:51:25.317 --> 00:51:27.317
EXACT TIME THAT THE VICE 
PRESIDENT

00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:36.258
EVACUATED THE ROOM. 2:26, 
CROSSING THROUGH A RECEPTION 

00:51:36.289 --> 00:51:38.680
AREA AND DOWN A FLIGHT OF 
STAIRS, COMING WITHIN PACES OF 

00:51:38.912 --> 00:51:41.045
WHERE THE RIOTERS HAD BEEN 
MINUTES EARLIER. IT REALLY IS 

00:51:41.286 --> 00:51:43.286
REMARKABLE THAT THERE HADN'T 
BEEN AN ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THE 

00:51:43.421 --> 00:51:45.421
INSURRECTIONIST AND THE VICE 
PRESIDENT.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800
BY SOMEWAY, SURE LOT. 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TRIED TO 

00:51:50.027 --> 00:51:52.623
DRIVE DOWN THE DANGER BY 
EMPHASIZING THE TIMELINE IN THE 

00:51:52.851 --> 00:51:54.851
NEW SECURITY FOOTAGE OF

00:51:58.136 --> 00:51:59.791
HOW EXACTLY THE VICE PRESIDENT 
WAS EVACUATED. 

00:51:59.792 --> 00:52:03.531
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MATEA, ONE OF THE BIG 
QUESTIONS LET'S  LEFT RESOLVED 

00:52:03.762 --> 00:52:06.613
WITH THIS. WAS DONALD TRUMP 
AWARE IN REAL TIME OF THAT 

00:52:07.032 --> 00:52:11.741
DIRECT THREAT TO HIS OWN VICE 
PRESIDENT? SO DO WE GET ANY MORE

00:52:11.971 --> 00:52:17.444
INSIGHT INTO THAT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION 

00:52:17.673 --> 00:52:20.168
AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
QUESTIONS HANGING OVER THIS 

00:52:20.405 --> 00:52:23.521
TRIAL AND ARGUABLY WITHOUT 
WITNESSES WE WON'T GET A 

00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:26.101
DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THAT, BUT 
WE DO HAVE A LITTLE MORE 

00:52:26.336 --> 00:52:31.651
INFORMATION. YESTERDAY SOME OF 
THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED ABOUT A 

00:52:31.893 --> 00:52:34.019
PHONE CALL THE PRESIDENT MADE 
THAT MIKE LEE, WHICH ERRONEOUSLY

00:52:34.256 --> 00:52:37.931
WAS TRYING TO CALL SENATOR TOMMY
TUBERVILLE.

00:52:42.924 --> 00:52:45.064
THAT WAS WHILE THE SENATORS WERE
SHELTERING INSIDE THE CHAMBER, 

00:52:45.302 --> 00:52:47.970
SHORTLY AFTER THE VICE PRESIDENT
HAD BEEN MOVED OFF THE FLOOR. WE

00:52:48.202 --> 00:52:50.544
HANDED THE PHONE TO HIM AND 
ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTING THE 

00:52:50.772 --> 00:52:52.772
PRESIDENT IS URGING

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.620
TOMMY TUBERVILLE TO CONTINUE TO 
OBJECT TO THE COUNTING OF THE 

00:52:57.859 --> 00:52:59.750
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. NOW 
SOMEWHERE RIGHT AROUND THAT 

00:52:59.751 --> 00:53:03.730
TIME, THE PRESIDENT AT 2:24 
ISSUES A TWEET

00:53:07.345 --> 00:53:09.994
ACCUSING THE VICE PRESIDENT OF 
BEING A COWARD. AND YESTERDAY 

00:53:10.226 --> 00:53:15.201
TUBERVILLE GAVE AN INTERVIEW IN 
WHICH HE SAID  THE VICE 

00:53:15.433 --> 00:53:21.276
PRESIDENT HAD BEEN MOVED OFF THE
FLOOR. THERE IS A SUGGESTION 

00:53:21.515 --> 00:53:23.770
THAT AROUND THAT PERIOD OF TIME,
THE PRESIDENT DID UNDERSTAND 

00:53:24.001 --> 00:53:26.001
THAT

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.412
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN 
EVACUATED AND THERE WAS ENOUGH 

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.872
DANGER TO ACTUALLY MOVE HIM OFF 
THE CHAMBER. SO I DO THINK THERE

00:53:35.134 --> 00:53:39.089
IS A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
THE LEVEL OF THE THREAT BUT THE 

00:53:39.355 --> 00:53:42.297
TIMING SUGGESTS HE WAS AWARE 
THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF CHAOS 

00:53:42.561 --> 00:53:44.436
AND POTENTIAL PERIL HAPPENING AT
THAT MOMENT. 

00:53:44.437 --> 00:53:47.371
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LETS YOU BRING INTO 
THE CONVERSATION. IS SIGNIFICANT

00:53:47.917 --> 00:53:50.995
BECAUSE IT DOES GIVE A SENSE OF 
THE POTENTIAL TIMELINE. LET'S 

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.294
PICK THIS UP ARE A LITTLE MORE. 
IF THE CONVERSATION IS THAT 

00:53:55.697 --> 00:53:58.580
TOMMY TUBERVILLE HAS SAID IN THE
TIMELINE IS ACCURATE, THAT MEANS

00:54:00.254 --> 00:54:02.901
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE KNOWN 
HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT WAS BEING

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:06.065
EVACUATED FOR SAFETY. AT THE 
PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

00:54:09.783 --> 00:54:13.671
AS FAR AS WE KNOW TO TRY AND 
SAVE THE VICE PRESIDENT'S LIFE 

00:54:13.937 --> 00:54:16.082
AND IN THAT MOMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, LIBBY. DAVID AXELROD,

00:54:20.345 --> 00:54:23.138
CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR PRESIDENT 
OBAMA SAID LAST NIGHT IT IS 

00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:25.783
INCONCEIVABLE THAT IF THE VICE 
PRESIDENT WAS BEING EVACUATED 

00:54:26.052 --> 00:54:28.990
THAT THE SECRET SERVICE WOULDN'T
ALSO ELECT THE PRESIDENT. THE 

00:54:29.538 --> 00:54:33.100
SECRET SERVICE IS IN TOUCH WITH 
THE OTHER DETAIL, THEY ARE VERY 

00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:34.976
MINDFUL OF THE WHOLE THREAT 
MATRIX. 

00:54:34.977 --> 00:54:40.336
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A VERY GOOD REALITY 
CHECK. IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON A 

00:54:40.602 --> 00:54:43.725
CALL TO A FRESHMAN PRESIDENT TO 
LET THE PRESIDENT KNOW WHERE THE

00:54:43.993 --> 00:54:46.650
VICE PRESIDENT IS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT 

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.344
OF COURSE TRUMP KNEW THAT PENCE 
WAS IN DANGER AND WAS IN  A 

00:54:50.609 --> 00:54:53.400
HIDEAWAY. AND IT IS IMPORTANT 
FOR THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:57.123
MANAGERS, TO ESTABLISH JUMP OFF 
A STATE OF MIND. THE ANALOGY 

00:54:57.385 --> 00:55:02.366
THAT JAMIE RASKIN USED, WHICH 
WAS TRUMP IS NOT JUST YELLING 

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.834
FIRE IN A CROWDED MOVIE THEATER 
BUT HE HAS THE FIRE CHIEF, WHO 

00:55:06.097 --> 00:55:09.332
HAS SOMEWHAT SET THE MOVIE 
THEATER ON FIRE AND THEN DOESN'T

00:55:09.594 --> 00:55:14.023
SEND A FIRE TRUCK TO PUT THE 
FIRE OUT. IT IS THAT LAST PART 

00:55:14.286 --> 00:55:17.443
OF WHY THIS IS SO SIGNIFICANT. 
THAT TRUMP KNEW HIS OWN VICE 

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:20.875
PRESIDENT WAS THERE. TRUMP NEVER
CALLED TO CHECK ON PENCE. HE 

00:55:21.119 --> 00:55:25.592
DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO HIM THE NEXT
DAY. AND INSTEAD, WAS CONTINUING

00:55:25.821 --> 00:55:28.549
TO TRY TO GET ALLEGEDLY, THESE 
SENATORS TO DELAY CERTIFICATION

00:55:31.904 --> 00:55:33.904
, TO INTERFERE WITH THE 
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED 

00:55:33.914 --> 00:55:38.387
PROCEEDING. THAT, I THINK IS 
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE 

00:55:38.622 --> 00:55:40.781
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TRY 
TO UNPACK MORE DETAIL. THEY 

00:55:41.018 --> 00:55:45.168
DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING
ALL THE INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE 

00:55:45.433 --> 00:55:48.841
RECORDS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
WITNESSES THAT I THINK THEY 

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:51.957
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HAD FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE, WHO WERE WITH THE 

00:55:52.203 --> 00:55:54.203
PRESIDENT. OBVIOUSLY OUR 
REPORTING FROM OUR COLLEAGUES, 

00:55:54.340 --> 00:56:01.491
HIS -- HE WAS DISENGAGE. THE 
PRESIDENT WAS EAGER TO 

00:56:01.956 --> 00:56:04.940
HELP. HE WAS RELISHING AND 
ENJOYING THE SHOW. AND THAT IS 

00:56:05.175 --> 00:56:07.422
VERY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF 
MAKING THE CASE THAT

00:56:10.944 --> 00:56:12.944
ESSENTIALLY THERE WAS A 
DERELICTION OF DUTY BY THE 

00:56:13.347 --> 00:56:15.001
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, THE IMPEACHMENT 

00:56:15.002 --> 00:56:19.183
MANAGERS YESTERDAY WERE TRYING 
TO ILLUSTRATE THAT THE RIOTERS

00:56:22.932 --> 00:56:25.400
WERE FOCUS ON WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS SAYING IN HIS TWEETS 

00:56:25.629 --> 00:56:30.019
WERE NOT SAYING. WHEN HE WAS 
CRITICIZING MIKE PENCE, WHOSE 

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.301
LIFE WAS IN DANGER OF THE 
CAPITOL, WE SAW FOOTAGE  ON THAT

00:56:33.535 --> 00:56:35.535
SAME TIMELINE OF THE RIOTERS

00:56:38.434 --> 00:56:40.631
SHARING WITH EACH OTHER WHAT 
TRUMP WAS TWEETING, CRITICIZING,

00:56:40.863 --> 00:56:44.479
ANGRILY CRITICIZING THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT 

00:56:44.709 --> 00:56:48.249
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SHOWS THE RIOTERS AND 

00:56:48.621 --> 00:56:50.621
THOSE

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.682
ANTICIPATING IN THE INSURRECTION
WERE LISTENING TO TRUMP. THAT IS

00:56:57.925 --> 00:57:00.164
WHAT THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS, THAT IS THE CORE OF 

00:57:00.391 --> 00:57:03.185
THEIR ARGUMENT. THEY DID LAY OUT
SOME VIDEO THAT SHOWS ONE OF THE

00:57:03.421 --> 00:57:05.762
MEN WHO IS FAMILIAR PERSON AND 
FACE IN ALL THE INSTRUCTION 

00:57:05.994 --> 00:57:07.994
VIDEOS

00:57:12.065 --> 00:57:14.763
, HE HAD THE WARRANTS AND IS 
CALLED THE QANON SHAMAN. WHERE 

00:57:14.991 --> 00:57:17.811
HE TOLD PEOPLE, TRUMP SAID GO 
HOME. WE CAN GO HOME NOW, WE 

00:57:18.048 --> 00:57:20.392
WON. THAT VIDEO WAS PLAYED. THAT
AGAIN, IT BOLSTERS THE ARGUMENT 

00:57:20.627 --> 00:57:23.136
OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WHO 
ARE TRYING TO CONNECT THE DOTS 

00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:25.715
AND SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP 
POPPED HIS EXACT WORDS LED TO 

00:57:25.948 --> 00:57:27.948
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED.

00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:35.490
AND THAT IS IN CONNECTION THAT 
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE 

00:57:35.729 --> 00:57:38.076
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THEY ARE 
ALSO GOING TO TALK TODAY ABOUT 

00:57:38.308 --> 00:57:41.122
SOME OF THE HARMS THAT CAME FROM
THE EVENT, THE AFTERMATH AND THE

00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:44.120
FACT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID 
NOT SHOW ANY SORT OF REMORSE. 

00:57:44.351 --> 00:57:46.916
DID NOT SHOW ANY CONTRITION. WE 
DID SEE THE VIDEO YESTERDAY THAT

00:57:47.158 --> 00:57:49.736
HE PUT OUT AT 4:00 P.M. WHICH 
WAS HOURS AFTER EVERYTHING SORT 

00:57:49.963 --> 00:57:53.025
OF TOOK PLACE ON THE SIXTH, HE 
SAID WE LOVE YOU, GO HOME. THIS 

00:57:53.277 --> 00:57:55.277
WAS AN UNFAIR ELECTION. IT WAS 
ALMOST

00:57:58.906 --> 00:58:01.727
TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF HIS
MOUTH ON THAT ONE. THEY WANTED 

00:58:01.962 --> 00:58:04.242
TO SHOW THOSE CONTRADICTIONS, 
THAT HE REALLY IS NOT SHOWING 

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:07.039
ANY SORT OF REMORSE FOR WHAT 
HE'S DONE. AND THE DESIGN OF 

00:58:07.275 --> 00:58:09.275
THAT, THE INTENT OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS IN DOING 

00:58:09.377 --> 00:58:11.726
THAT IS KIND OF ALSO PUTTING THE
DEFENSE IN A CORNER.

00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:21.635
THEY ARE EXPECTED WHEN THEY COME
WITH THEIR OPENING ARGUMENTS TO 

00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:23.873
TALK ABOUT FREE SPEECH, THAT THE
PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT 

00:58:23.976 --> 00:58:26.092
TRUMP WAS A VERY PASSIONATE 
SPEAKER. THIS WAS A FIERY 

00:58:26.332 --> 00:58:28.940
SPEECH, MUCH LIKE HIS OTHER 
RALLIES. AND HE WAS NOT PART OF 

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.509
THE ACTUAL EVENTS THAT TOOK 
PLACE. WHEN THEY CLOSEOUT TODAY,

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.750
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 
GOING TO TRY TO PRE-EMPTIVELY 

00:58:33.909 --> 00:58:36.521
SET UP THE TRUMP LAWYERS' 
ARGUMENT AND TRY TO ATTACK IT 

00:58:36.752 --> 00:58:39.346
ALREADY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT 
IS AT THE CORE OF WHAT THE 

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:44.611
DEFENSE TEAM IS GOING TO BRING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO MATEA, THIS TRIAL THAT  

00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:48.252
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING THROUGH IN
THE SENATE, IS THIS POLITICAL 

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:54.591
EXERCISE THAT CONGRESS IS GOING 
THROUGH. BUT WHAT IS THE 

00:58:54.823 --> 00:58:57.375
EXPECTATION OR CONSIDERATION, 
THE POSSIBILITY OF DONALD TRUMP 

00:58:57.954 --> 00:58:59.954
BEING CHARGED

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:04.911
IN A CRIMINAL COURT FOR THESE 
SAME ACTIVITIES, THAT WE ARE 

00:59:05.148 --> 00:59:07.496
HEARING ABOUT THIS WEEK? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION 

00:59:08.042 --> 00:59:10.042
HANGING OVER

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.020
THE ONGOING CHARGES BEING FILED 
AGAINST THE RIOTERS AND WHAT IS 

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:18.578
INTERESTING, WE ARE SEEING A LOT
OF THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS FOR 

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:20.960
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE 
PARTICIPATED IN THE VIOLENCE 

00:59:21.195 --> 00:59:23.195
ACTUALLY SIDING TRUMP OFFICE 
WORDS AS A DEFENSE AND

00:59:27.246 --> 00:59:29.642
SAYING THE PRESIDENT INSPIRED 
THEM. SO THIS COULD COME UP IN 

00:59:29.874 --> 00:59:32.934
THE ACTUAL PROSECUTION OF THOSE 
RIOTERS. AND NOW WE LEARNED 

00:59:33.161 --> 00:59:36.372
YESTERDAY, THERE ACTUALLY COULD 
BE ANOTHER LEGAL PART THE PLACE 

00:59:36.599 --> 00:59:38.948
OUT, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN 
FULTON COUNTY, IN GEORGIA IS 

00:59:39.187 --> 00:59:42.251
LAUNCHING A CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION INTO EFFORTS BY 

00:59:42.537 --> 00:59:45.501
THE PRESIDENT THAT PRECEDED THE 
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. THAT WERE

00:59:45.732 --> 00:59:48.259
VERY MUCH  ARGUABLY TIED TO IT.

00:59:52.203 --> 00:59:54.324
HIS ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE STATE 
OFFICIALS IN GEORGIA TO SUBVERT 

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.560
THE VOTE, THEIR. THERE COULD BE 
A CRIMINAL

01:00:06.647 --> 01:00:08.866
PROSECUTION RELATED TO THE 
ACTIONS HE WAS INVOLVED IN, IN 

01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:11.111
GEORGIA. AND WE ALSO STARTED 
HEARING TALK ABOUT MORE 

01:00:11.239 --> 01:00:13.239
OVERSIGHT BY CONGRESS AND A 
DEEPER EXAMINATION OF EXACTLY 

01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:16.019
WHAT HAPPENED THAT LED TO THE 
BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPITOL . 

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.544
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MATEA GOLD, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME IS

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.644
MONEY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT THE SENATE WERE TO FIND 

01:00:23.645 --> 01:00:25.815
DONALD TRUMP GUILTY, HE WOULD 
BECOME THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 

01:00:26.046 --> 01:00:28.642
U.S. HISTORY TO BE CONVICTED  IN
AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. BUT EVEN 

01:00:28.877 --> 01:00:32.068
THOUGH THAT WOULD BE A FIRST, WE
CAN LEARN FROM A LOOK BACK FROM 

01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:34.180
HISTORICAL CONTEXT WITH MY 
COLLEAGUE LILLIAN CUNNINGHAM. 

01:00:34.181 --> 01:00:36.181
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M LILLIAN CUNNINGHAM, 
CREATOR AND HOST OF THE 

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.291
PRESIDENTIAL PODCAST. MOST 
PRESIDENTS LEAVE OFFICE AND FIND

01:00:38.487 --> 01:00:43.015
OTHER PURSUITS TO OCCUPY THEIR 
TIME. CHARITIES, OTHER CAUSES 

01:00:43.256 --> 01:00:47.114
THAT THEY DECIDE TO GET INVOLVED
IN. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, 

01:00:47.346 --> 01:00:50.315
THERE IS A FORMER PRESIDENT WHO 
JUST CAN'T LET GO OF THE I

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.771
IDEA OF RETURNING TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. THAT WAS THE CASE WITH 

01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:05.007
THEODORE ROOSEVELT. ROOSEVELT IN
1912 ATTEMPTED TO GET THE 

01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:07.021
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR 
PRESIDENT AGAIN. BY THAT POINT 

01:01:07.022 --> 01:01:09.344
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD MOVED 
ON TO SUPPORTING WILLIAM HOWARD 

01:01:09.575 --> 01:01:12.079
TAFT. ROOSEVELT WAS SO UPSET 
THAT HE DIDN'T GET HIS PARTY'S 

01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:17.553
NOMINATION AND HE SPLIT OFF AND 
HELPED FORM A THIRD PARTY, THE 

01:01:17.786 --> 01:01:20.346
BULL MOOSE PARTY. HE RAN IN THE 
1912 ELECTION AS A THIRD-PARTY 

01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:24.140
CANDIDATE BUT HE DIDN'T WIN. 
REPUBLICANS, WHO ARE NOW TORN 

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:26.370
BETWEEN

01:01:28.763 --> 01:01:30.913
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND BULL 
MOOSE PARTY, SPLIT THEIR VOTES 

01:01:31.148 --> 01:01:33.148
BETWEEN ROOSEVELT AND TAFT, 
WHICH ALLOWED DEMOCRAT WOODROW 

01:01:33.186 --> 01:01:35.186
WILSON TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE 
THAT YEAR.

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:41.739
 7

01:01:44.359 --> 01:01:46.721
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SEE TO
BELIEVE. SOMETIMES WAITING IS 

01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:48.954
NOT AN OPTION. WHEN THE NEWS IS 
BREAKING, WATCH

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:31.328
A LIVE SHOT OF THE U.S. CAPITOL 
WHERE IN A HALF HOUR THE HOUSE 

01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:33.561
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WILL 
CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR CASE  

01:02:33.663 --> 01:02:35.663
AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP.

01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:41.242
WITH ME NOW, TO DISCUSS WHAT TO 
EXPECT AND WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY 

01:02:41.613 --> 01:02:43.468
BEEN SEEING THIS WEEK, AMY 
GARDNER, NATIONAL POLITICAL 

01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:45.363
REPORTER ALONG WITH RHONDA 
COLEMAN, CAPITOL HILL REPORTER, 

01:02:45.364 --> 01:02:48.869
JAMES HOMAN. AMY, THANK YOU FOR 
JOINING US. YESTERDAY WE REALLY 

01:02:49.102 --> 01:02:55.075
HEARD ABOUT THE DANGER THAT MIKE
PENCE WAS UNDER. BUT ALSO, 

01:02:55.299 --> 01:02:58.315
SPEAKER PELOSI. AND WE ALSO SAW 
FOOTAGE OF SOME OF THE SENATORS 

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.829
AND JUST HOW CLOSE THEY CAME

01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:08.331
. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NEWS TO 
SOME OF THEM FRANKLY, HOW CLOSE 

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:10.559
THEY CAME TO MEMBERS OF THE MOB.

01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:19.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NEWS TO 
SOME OF THEM. THERE WAS AN 

01:03:19.409 --> 01:03:21.011
INCREDIBLE INTERVIEW WITH 
SENATOR MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN 

01:03:21.012 --> 01:03:23.358
FROM UTAH AFTER -- DURING A 
RECESS RIGHT AFTER WE WATCHED 

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.701
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO THAT HAD 
NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE OF HIM 

01:03:25.938 --> 01:03:28.170
BEING URGED BACK INTO THE SENATE
CHAMBER BY OFFICER EUGENE 

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:31.267
GOODMAN. THE ALREADY HELD, 
HEROIC MEMBER OF THE CAPITOL 

01:03:31.777 --> 01:03:35.723
POLICE FORCE. IT TURNS OUT THAT 
WAS SECONDS BEFORE

01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:43.902
THAT OFFICER FENDED OFF AND 
REDIRECTED THE MOB THAT HAD JUST

01:03:44.126 --> 01:03:46.261
BROKEN INTO THE WINDOWS, ONE 
FLOOR BELOW WHERE THAT ROMNEY 

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.332
CAN BE SEEN IN THE VIDEO. AND 
ROMNEY SAID CAN TO THE PRESS 

01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:51.561
CORPS, I HAD NO IDEA

01:03:57.671 --> 01:04:01.012
IT WAS OFFICER GOODMAN. I HAD NO
IDEA HOW CLOSE I WAS TO THE MOB.

01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:03.339
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE MOMENT FOR 
EVERYBODY WHO WAS WATCHING. 

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.168
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHY DON'T WE WATCH THAT AMY. 
THIS WAS A PEACH MANAGER STACEY 

01:04:06.395 --> 01:04:08.376
PLASKETT PRESENTING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN THE SECURITY FOOTAGE YOU 

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.490
CAN SEE OFFICER GOODMAN RUNNING 
TO RESPOND TO THE INITIAL 

01:04:10.742 --> 01:04:15.664
BREECH. OFFICER GOODMAN PASSES 
SENATOR MITT ROMNEY AND DIRECTS 

01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:21.614
HIM TO TURN AROUND IN ORDER TO 
GET TO SAFETY. 

01:04:21.615 --> 01:04:27.253
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO AMY, YOU KNOW, THAT IS THE
EXPERIENCE OF MITT ROMNEY. WE 

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:30.122
ALSO SAW THE EXPERIENCE OF 
MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER. 

01:04:30.363 --> 01:04:34.707
BUT WE ALSO SAW WHAT STAFFERS 
WENT THROUGH. IN PARTICULAR, THE

01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:38.136
STAFFERS OF NANCY PELOSI. SO 
LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:04:49.582 --> 01:04:51.437
THE STRATEGY HERE OF THESE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, SHOWING 

01:04:51.438 --> 01:04:53.772
THE PERIL THAT NOT ONLY MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS FACED BUT STAFFERS 

01:04:53.997 --> 01:04:56.067
FACED, CAPITOL POLICE PHASED. 
WHAT DO THEY WANT TO COMMUNICATE

01:04:56.299 --> 01:04:58.374
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHO ARE 
WATCHING THIS TRIAL? 

01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:01.125
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THEY DON'T WANT THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC OR MEMBERS OF 

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:03.953
THE SENATE, WHO WILL RENDER A 
VERDICT IN THIS TRIAL, TO FORGET

01:05:04.187 --> 01:05:06.509
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. AND IN 
FACT THEY ARE LETTING THE PUBLIC

01:05:06.732 --> 01:05:10.114
SEE THAT IT WAS FAR WORSE THAN 
EVEN WE KNEW THAT DAY. AS 

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:15.035
HORRIFYING AS IT WAS TO THOSE OF
US WATCHING IT UNFOLD ON TV THAT

01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:17.274
DAY OR FOR SOME OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES

01:05:20.476 --> 01:05:23.162
, LIVE IN PERSON IN THE HOUSE 
AND SENATE CHAMBERS. IT WAS 

01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:25.392
WORSE EVEN THAN WHAT WE 
REALIZED. THERE WAS VIDEO 

01:05:25.465 --> 01:05:27.465
YESTERDAY

01:05:32.669 --> 01:05:36.069
, OR AUDIO OF A MEMBER OF THE 
RIOTERS, A MEMBER OF THE MOB ON 

01:05:36.298 --> 01:05:38.640
THE HOUSE SIDE, SAYING IN AN 
ALMOST LIKE SLASHER FILM, CREEPY

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.884
WAY, NANCY! NANCY, WHERE ARE 
YOU? AND A MOB OF PEOPLE GOING 

01:05:42.113 --> 01:05:46.838
DOWN THE HALLWAY AND BANGING ON 
DOORS. AND WE KNOW FROM OUR 

01:05:47.071 --> 01:05:49.385
REPORTING, FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO 
THAT AT THAT VERY MOMENT, 

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:52.997
SPEAKER PELOSI STAFF WAS HIDING 
UNDER A TABLE WITHIN EARSHOT OF 

01:05:53.766 --> 01:05:59.483
THAT SCENE. AND I THINK THE 
STRATEGY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT 

01:05:59.731 --> 01:06:02.459
PEOPLE DON'T FORGET. THEY KNOW 
THAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS KNOW THE

01:06:02.705 --> 01:06:07.385
DIRECTION THIS IS HADDAD. IT IS 
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THEY WILL 

01:06:07.627 --> 01:06:10.402
PERSUADE 17 REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
TO IMPEACH. -- TO CONVICT. BUT 

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:12.741
EVEN IF THEY GET A FEW PEOPLE TO

01:06:16.266 --> 01:06:18.357
CHANGE THEIR MINDS, I THINK IT 
SIGNAL SOMETHING FROM THE 

01:06:18.586 --> 01:06:24.629
HISTORY BOOKS AND I THINK THIS, 
AS MATEA SAID A MOMENT AGO, SETS

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.860
THE TABLE FOR FURTHER, MORE 
IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATIONS TO 

01:06:26.868 --> 01:06:28.868
COMMENT.  BOTH IN CONGRESS AND 
IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.

01:06:33.762 --> 01:06:35.762
AROUND THE COUNTRY, REALLY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AMY, THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:37.838
MANAGERS CONTINUE THEIR 
ARGUMENTS TODAY

01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:42.631
, THEIR PRESENTATION AND WE HAVE
AN INDICATION THEY WILL FOCUS 

01:06:42.857 --> 01:06:46.205
MORE ON DONALD TRANSACTIONS. WE 
SAW MUCH OF THE MOB YESTERDAY 

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.909
AND WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT 
DONALD TRUMP. YOU HAVE BEEN 

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:51.474
REPORTING FOR MONTHS ON TRUMP'S 
DESIRE TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION 

01:06:51.705 --> 01:06:54.465
RESULTS AND NOT JUST A DESIRE 
BUT THE ACTIONS HE TOOK TO TRY 

01:06:54.701 --> 01:06:56.701
TO THWART DEMOCRACY FROM 
HAPPENING.

01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:05.030
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR FOR OUR 
VIEWERS. HAVE YOU FOUND IN YOUR 

01:07:05.263 --> 01:07:07.263
REPORTING, EVIDENCE AT DONALD 
TRUMP'S CLAIMS THAT THE 2020 

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:11.171
ELECTION WAS IN ANY WAY A FRAUD?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE FOUND IN MY REPORTING 

01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:16.201
THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF 
FRAUD AT A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY 

01:07:16.427 --> 01:07:22.670
TO HAVE CHANGED ANY OUTCOME IN 
ANY STATE OR PRECINCT IN THAT 

01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:26.552
MANNER. IT IS INTERESTING. 
SECRETARY OF STATE BRAD 

01:07:26.786 --> 01:07:30.697
RAFFENSPERGER OF GEORGIA GOT A 
LITTLE RUNDOWN ON THAT FAMOUS 

01:07:30.954 --> 01:07:33.634
CALL WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN AN 
EARLY JANUARY PUT OUT A PRESS 

01:07:33.866 --> 01:07:37.413
RELEASE THIS MORNING, ADVANCING 
INVESTIGATIONS AND -- INTO 

01:07:37.647 --> 01:07:43.996
VARIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD. 
AND IT IS ONE PERSON WHO VOTED 

01:07:44.267 --> 01:07:48.190
AS A FELONY, AS A FELON 
ALLEGEDLY. ONE PERSON WHO 

01:07:48.425 --> 01:07:51.002
ALLEGEDLY YOU KNOW PUT IN

01:07:59.723 --> 01:08:02.080
A BELL APPLICATION LATER THAN 
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. THIS IS 

01:08:02.315 --> 01:08:04.315
WHAT HAPPENS. FRAUD HAPPENS, 
MISTAKES HAPPEN. AND THEY RARELY

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:07.780
HAPPEN AT A LEVEL THAT CAN 
CHANGE THE OUTCOME. IF THERE IS 

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.010
ONE ARGUMENT THAT

01:08:12.508 --> 01:08:14.567
REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE THAT HAS 
LEGITIMACY IN AND ALL THEIR 

01:08:14.803 --> 01:08:17.619
CLAIMS OF FRAUD, IT IS THAT IT 
IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SAID 

01:08:17.846 --> 01:08:19.674
ELECTION OFFICIALS WERE WITHIN 
THEIR RIGHTS TO UNILATERALLY 

01:08:19.675 --> 01:08:21.675
CHANGE

01:08:23.653 --> 01:08:25.653
TO ACCOMMODATE THE PANDEMIC. 
PENNSYLVANIA WAS A GROUND ZERO 

01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:30.915
FOR THAT DEBATE. THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE IN THAT STATE DID A LOT

01:08:31.143 --> 01:08:35.268
OF UNILATERAL DECISION-MAKING. 
AND THERE CERTAINLY A VIGOROUS 

01:08:35.503 --> 01:08:38.559
DEBATE THAT CAN BE HAD ABOUT 
WHETHER SHE WAS IN POWER TO DO 

01:08:38.787 --> 01:08:41.550
SO OR WHETHER SHE WAS DISTURBING
THE POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE. IT

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:44.717
AGAIN, EVEN IF YOU GOT RID OF 
ALL THE VOTES THAT WERE ENABLED 

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:46.950
BY THE RULE CHANGES THAT

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.070
SHE UNILATERALLY MADE, IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED THE 

01:08:58.071 --> 01:08:59.947
OUTCOME OF PENNSYLVANIA. JOE 
BIDEN WOULD'VE WON PENNSYLVANIA.

01:08:59.948 --> 01:09:01.353
THAT IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT 
THING. 

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:03.413
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ROGER COLEMAN, ONE OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS IS A 

01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:05.299
DEMOCRAT FROM PENNSYLVANIA. 
MEDDLING DEAN, CERTAINLY USEFUL 

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.300
TO THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
CASE, AS THEY HAVE A 

01:09:07.522 --> 01:09:11.674
PENNSYLVANIAN TALKING ABOUT THE 
HISTORY AND WHAT LED UP TO THE 

01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:13.903
ATTACK AS PART OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER TEAM. HOW 

01:09:14.026 --> 01:09:16.562
PUT INTO THEIR CASE IS THE 
BUILDUP? IS THE GROUNDWORK THAT 

01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:21.541
TRUMP LAID FOR MONTHS, TRYING TO
DELEGITIMIZE THE ELECTION TO 

01:09:21.775 --> 01:09:23.897
THEIR CASE, NOT JUST FOCUSING 
ONLY ON JANUARY 6.

01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:32.526
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I REALLY THINK THAT IS PART 
OF REALLY THE KEY ARGUMENT COME 

01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:34.765
HERE. F HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS ARE TASKED WITH SHOWING

01:09:34.847 --> 01:09:37.991
THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED 
INCIDENT, IT WAS PART OF A 

01:09:38.222 --> 01:09:40.678
LONGER STRETCH OF BEHAVIOR AND 
CONDUCT BY THE RESIDENT, THAT IS

01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:44.269
THE KEY ARGUMENT. AND I BELIEVE 
I SAID YESTERDAY IN OUR CLOSING 

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:46.529
SHOW,

01:09:49.278 --> 01:09:51.278
A NEW SECURITY FOOTAGE, THE 
DETAILS THAT WE LEARNED 

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:53.490
YESTERDAY, THAT WAS CERTAINLY 
IMPORTANT. IT WAS A CRITICAL 

01:09:53.563 --> 01:09:57.332
MOMENT IN THE ARGUMENTS 
YESTERDAY. BUT EVEN MORE SO, THE

01:09:57.647 --> 01:10:01.803
EARLIER PART OF THE DAY WHEN THE
HOUSE MANAGERS WENT OVER ALL OF 

01:10:02.027 --> 01:10:04.335
THE TWEETS, ALL THE THINGS THAT 
WERE SAID. THE ACTIVITIES THAT 

01:10:04.562 --> 01:10:06.670
WERE LEADING UP TO THE SIXTH. 
THE TWEETS WHERE FORMER 

01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:11.846
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT PLAN 
FOR THE SIXTH. MORE DETAILS TO 

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.106
COME. IN FACT THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS CALLED A A SAVE THE 

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:19.937
DATE. HE WAS SENDING SAVE THE 
DATE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW JANUARY 

01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:24.247
6 WITH HER LEFT HAND. AND IS ONE
OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER SAID,

01:10:24.475 --> 01:10:30.253
HE RAN OUT OF NONVIOLENT OPTIONS
TO STOP ELECTION. SO I REALLY 

01:10:30.487 --> 01:10:33.034
THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE 
SHOULD NOT MISS. THEY ARE PART 

01:10:33.277 --> 01:10:37.803
OF THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE WAS 
INTENT BY DONALD TRUMP, AND THEY

01:10:38.051 --> 01:10:40.591
HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY FEEL 
FROM HIS TWEETS AND SOME OF THE 

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:43.060
THINGS HE SAID WAY BEFORE 
JANUARY 6. THAT IS REALLY 

01:10:43.295 --> 01:10:45.875
CRITICAL PART OF THE ARGUMENT. 
AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET TO 

01:10:46.099 --> 01:10:48.099
THAT

01:10:50.895 --> 01:10:52.918
TWO THIRDS SUPERMAJORITY TO 
CONVICT DONALD TRUMP, THEY AT 

01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:55.839
LEAST HAVE IN THE RECORD, THEY 
HAVE PUT FORTH THE RECORD THAT 

01:10:56.116 --> 01:10:58.247
THIS WAS PART OF LONG-STANDING 
BEHAVIOR WEEKS, IF NOT MONTHS 

01:10:58.476 --> 01:11:01.574
AHEAD OF THE 2020 ELECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO AMY, ONE OF THE THINGS I 

01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:05.673
WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM. WE

01:11:05.902 --> 01:11:08.340
HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM 
YESTERDAY. WE DON'T ANTICIPATE 

01:11:08.566 --> 01:11:13.862
HEARING FROM THEM TODAY. BUT IT 
WILL BE THERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT 

01:11:14.279 --> 01:11:18.044
THE LEGAL TEAM BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
BEEN REPORTING ON A RELATIVELY 

01:11:18.293 --> 01:11:22.147
NEW MEMBER OF THE TEAM, WHO IN A
FASCINATING TURN OF EVENTS WAS 

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:27.275
ACTUALLY PART OF A LAWSUIT LAST 
YEAR AGAINST TRUMP FOR FRAUD 

01:11:27.507 --> 01:11:30.853
CLAIMS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. HE HAD A CLIENT

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.401
LAST YEAR WHO WAS A WOULD-BE 
CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. HOUSE. HE

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.640
WANTED

01:11:39.366 --> 01:11:42.650
TO CHALLENGE, AS AN INDEPENDENT,
DWIGHT EVANS, WHO IS THE 

01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:45.404
DEMOCRAT FROM PHILADELPHIA. AND 
IS NOT ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE 

01:11:45.632 --> 01:11:50.447
BALLOT WITH SIGNATURES. SO 
MICHAEL VANDER WIEN, WHO IS 

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:53.070
BRUCE CASTOR'S

01:11:55.434 --> 01:11:57.316
PARTNER IN PHILADELPHIA, 
REPRESENTED HIM IN THAT EFFORT 

01:11:57.317 --> 01:12:01.520
TO WEIGHT SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS
AND HE ALSO SUED IN FEDERAL 

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.751
COURT,

01:12:11.367 --> 01:12:13.456
THE PRESIDENT, THE POSTMASTER 
GENERAL LOUIS DEJOY AND THE U.S.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.560
POSTAL SERVICE ARGUING THAT 
THEIR OPERATIONAL CHANGES THAT 

01:12:15.561 --> 01:12:17.665
WERE IN THE HEADLINES LAST 
SUMMER HAD THWARTED THE ABILITY 

01:12:17.913 --> 01:12:19.913
OF

01:12:22.326 --> 01:12:24.440
AMERICAN VOTERS TO CAST THEIR 
BALLOTS LAST YEAR, WHICH IS 

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.793
AMAZING. THIS LANGUAGE IN THAT 
LAWSUIT THAT IS JUST POLAR 

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:29.041
OPPOSITE TO WHAT TRUMP'S LAWYERS
ARGUED. AGAINST IN THOSE

01:12:34.978 --> 01:12:37.061
CIVIL PROCEDURES LAST YEAR. IT 
IS FASCINATING. HE CAME UPON 

01:12:37.299 --> 01:12:39.299
THIS ROLE IN A SOMEWHAT 
HAPPENSTANCE WAY, BRUCE CASTOR 

01:12:39.413 --> 01:12:41.924
JOINED HIS LAW FIRM IN DECEMBER 
AND THEN IN JANUARY WAS TAPPED 

01:12:42.145 --> 01:12:46.565
TO JOIN TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM. 
AND MR. CASTOR BROUGHT MR. VAN 

01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:52.947
DER VEEN ALONG.  HIS WEBPAGE FOR
HIS LAW FIRM IS FASCINATING. IT 

01:12:53.179 --> 01:12:55.179
IS VERY SWAGGERING, LIKE

01:12:57.949 --> 01:13:00.282
A LOT OF PERSONAL INJURY LAW 
PRACTICES CAN BE. HE ADVERTISES 

01:13:00.508 --> 01:13:03.790
ON A LOCAL A.M. TALK RADIO SHOW.
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF YOUTUBE 

01:13:04.029 --> 01:13:08.868
VIDEOS LINKED TO -- FROM HIS 
WEBPAGE. HE EVEN BRAGS ABOUT 

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:12.662
THIS CASE INVOLVING THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION, ON HIS WEBPAGE

01:13:15.838 --> 01:13:19.044
, OF HIS LAW FIRM, WHICH IS SORT
OF FASCINATING. AND NOW HERE HE 

01:13:19.289 --> 01:13:21.289
IS NEXT TO BRUCE CASTOR

01:13:27.993 --> 01:13:29.970
IN THE SENATE CHAMBER EVERY DAY 
THIS WEEK. 

01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:32.568
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AMY, IN ONE RESPECT, THAT IS 
WHAT LAWYERS DO. THEY TAKE 

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.608
CASES, THEY FILE CASES. BUT IT 
IS JUST -- IT JUST SHOWS YOU 

01:13:35.837 --> 01:13:38.295
THAT HOW QUICKLY THIS TEAM WAS 
GATHERED. ESPECIALLY FOR A 

01:13:38.518 --> 01:13:41.427
POLITICAL TRIAL BECAUSE WE ALL 
KNOW IT IS NOT LIKE A JURY TRIAL

01:13:41.652 --> 01:13:46.465
WHERE THE JURY IS SEQUESTERED 
AND ISN'T CONSUMING OTHER NEWS 

01:13:46.695 --> 01:13:49.595
AND INFORMATION. LIKE SENATORS 
KNOW THAT ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS 

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:52.138
WAS JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THIS ARGUMENT, REALLY MOMENTS 

01:13:52.364 --> 01:13:53.993
AGO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SURE, THAT DOES HAPPEN. AND 

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:58.755
IN SOME CASES IT IS A BADGE OF 
HONOR OR A BACKDOOR COMPLEMENT 

01:13:59.457 --> 01:14:03.800
TO BE HIRED BY YOUR FORMER 
OPPONENT IN A CIVIL CASE. IT 

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:10.148
MEANS THAT THEY SOMETIMES LIKED 
THE JOB YOU DID FOR THE OTHER 

01:14:10.386 --> 01:14:12.386
SIDE. THERE CAN BE ETHICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS IS THERE AN 

01:14:12.512 --> 01:14:17.313
ADVERSE INTEREST IN TWO CLIENTS 
YOU'RE REPRESENTING. BUT IN THIS

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:20.543
CASE, THAT PREVIOUS LAWSUIT WAS 
DISMISSED IN NOVEMBER. SO IT IS 

01:14:20.772 --> 01:14:23.940
NOT AN ETHICAL ISSUE ACCORDING 
TO SCHOLARS I SPOKE TO FOR THAT 

01:14:24.179 --> 01:14:26.179
STORY. I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:14:30.186 --> 01:14:32.179
WORTH SAYING, THESE ARE 
SUCCESSFUL LAWYERS. BRUCE CASTOR

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.531
IS A WELL-KNOWN, SUCCESSFUL 
FORMER PROSECUTOR FROM THE 

01:14:34.757 --> 01:14:39.119
SUBURBS OF PHILADELPHIA TO PUT 
AWAY NUMEROUS MURDERERS AND WAS 

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:45.159
ON THE EVENING NEWS DURING THE 
EARLY 2000'S, LIKE ALL THE TIME.

01:14:45.402 --> 01:14:50.252
HE BECAME SORT OF LOCALLY 
WELL-KNOWN FOR THAT ROLL. 

01:14:50.676 --> 01:14:53.150
MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN IS ALSO A 
VERY SUCCESSFUL PERSONAL INJURY 

01:14:53.374 --> 01:14:57.034
LAWYER WHO HAS HAD  -- DO THE 
MATH, A TWO DIGIT SETTLEMENTS 

01:14:57.269 --> 01:14:59.287
AND JUDGMENTS ON BEHALF OF 
CLIENTS OVER THE YEARS.

01:15:04.293 --> 01:15:07.092
BUT THEY ARE THE THIRD OR FOURTH
STRING AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A 

01:15:07.317 --> 01:15:09.849
LOT OF TIME TO PREPARE. AND I 
THINK THE CONSENSUS IS THAT 

01:15:10.081 --> 01:15:14.107
SHOWED WITH MR. CASTOR'S OPENING
ARGUMENTS ON TUESDAY, THE 

01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:19.991
PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT IS 
NOT HAPPY WITH HOW MUCH MR. 

01:15:20.226 --> 01:15:22.226
CASTOR DID, PORTING TO 
REPORTING. IT IS INTERESTING TO 

01:15:22.637 --> 01:15:28.092
SEE HOW THINGS WILL GO FOR THEM 
TOMORROW. AND HOW LONG THEY 

01:15:28.322 --> 01:15:31.139
TAKE. THEY HAVE 16 HOURS AND WE 
ARE HEARING THEY MAY NOT TAKE 

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.628
ALL OF THAT, OR EVEN HALF OF IT.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

01:15:34.874 --> 01:15:36.889
HOW IT UNFOLDS TOMORROW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER 

01:15:37.128 --> 01:15:39.467
AMY GARDNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
LET'S GO TO POLITICAL VIDEO 

01:15:39.704 --> 01:15:44.375
REPORTER JOYCE KOH FROM OUTSIDE 
THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU BEEN 

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:46.855
TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ATTORNEYS , WHAT IS THE LATEST 

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.567
RESPONSE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM 
THOSE ATTORNEYS FOLLOWING THE 

01:15:49.802 --> 01:15:51.802
ARGUMENTS THAT THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

01:15:55.153 --> 01:15:57.153
MADE YESTERDAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, WE SAW ONE OF FORMER 

01:15:57.371 --> 01:16:00.594
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS, 
DAVID SCHOEN ON  FOX NEWS LAST 

01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:02.834
NIGHT FOLLOWING THE WRAPPING UP 
OF THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.745
MANAGERS PATH ARGUMENTS OF DAY 
ONE. AND HE REALLY HAD THE SAME 

01:16:07.976 --> 01:16:10.526
TONE THAT WE SAW THROUGH THAT 
LEGAL BRIEF THAT WAS FILED ON 

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:12.687
MONDAY. HE ATTACKED HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAYING THAT

01:16:12.688 --> 01:16:18.101
THEY WERE WANTING SCREEN TIME. 
THAT REALLY CONTRASTS, THE TONE 

01:16:18.328 --> 01:16:21.775
CONTRASTS WITH WHAT WE SAW ON 
THE FLOOR WITH THE HOUSE 

01:16:22.002 --> 01:16:24.047
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. THEY WERE 
NOT TAKING JABS AT TRUMP. THEY 

01:16:24.562 --> 01:16:28.490
WERE NOT NAME-CALLING. THEY WANT
SENATORS TO THIS VERY METHODICAL

01:16:28.897 --> 01:16:30.897
AND METICULOUS

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.094
CHRONOLOGY OF THE EVENTS THAT 
LED TO JANUARY 6, AS WELL AS THE

01:16:37.329 --> 01:16:39.569
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED AT THE 
CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6, PRESENTING

01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:43.119
A MODEL OF THE CAPITOL SHOWING 
THE PATH OF THE INSURRECTIONIST 

01:16:43.351 --> 01:16:47.174
AS WELL AS  VIDEO FOOTAGE. A LOT
OF THAT VIDEO FOOTAGE YOU HAVE 

01:16:47.398 --> 01:16:49.813
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT MORNING 
THAT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN BY 

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:52.038
THE PUBLIC. OR SENATORS UNTIL 
THIS

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:57.515
ARGUMENT YESTERDAY ON THE FLOOR 
OF THE SENATE. DAVID SCHOEN ON 

01:16:57.742 --> 01:17:01.216
FOX NEWS ALSO TALKING ABOUT 
THOSE VIDEOS, ATTACKING HOUSE 

01:17:01.444 --> 01:17:03.619
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS FOR SHOWING
THEM. AND REALLY GOING AFTER 

01:17:04.269 --> 01:17:09.694
THAT, DESPITE FIVE LIVES BEING 
LOST. THE POINT OF TRUMP'S 

01:17:09.923 --> 01:17:12.341
ATTORNEYS, WAS TO TAKE ISSUE 
WITH

01:17:16.904 --> 01:17:19.438
WERE SHOWN AND OF COURSE THAT 
VIOLENCE THAT WE HAS

01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:25.924
SOUGHT WAS AT THE CENTER OF THIS
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF DONALD 

01:17:26.163 --> 01:17:29.239
TRUMP. TAKE A LISTEN TO A BIT OF
WHAT DAVID SCHOEN HAD TO SAY 

01:17:29.605 --> 01:17:33.884
YESTERDAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHOWING THAT TAPE OVER AND 

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:36.704
OVER AGAIN, THE SAME SLIDES AND 
SO ON, AND MANIPULATED BY THEM 

01:17:37.012 --> 01:17:39.881
DOES NOTHING FOR HEALING. IT IS 
THE EXACT OPPOSITE. IT IS 

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:42.113
CONTINUING TO OPEN WOUNDS FOR 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

01:17:47.623 --> 01:17:49.710
AND IT IS SOMETHING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS CONDEMNED IN NO 

01:17:50.073 --> 01:17:52.073
UNCERTAIN TERMS. THE TERRIBLE 
VIOLENCE THAT WENT ON THERE. 

01:17:52.163 --> 01:17:54.951
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE LAST TIME WE HEARD DAVID 
SCHOEN AND IT COMES OTHER 

01:17:55.183 --> 01:17:57.781
ATTORNEY, BRUCE CASTOR ON THE 
FLOOR OF THE SENATE, WAS BACK ON

01:17:58.008 --> 01:18:00.008
TUESDAY WHEN THEY WERE ARGUING 
OVER THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 

01:18:00.286 --> 01:18:03.549
THE CASE. I JUST WANTED TO RECAP
THAT A LITTLE BIT FOR THOSE WHO 

01:18:03.778 --> 01:18:05.831
DIDN'T SEE THAT DAY. THERE WAS A
LOT OF BACKLASH

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.888
AFTER DAYS ESPECIALLY BRUCE 
CASTOR HAD GIVEN HIS ARGUMENTS 

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:14.635
BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF 
RAMBLING. AND A LOT OF POINTS 

01:18:14.863 --> 01:18:18.611
THAT WERE REALLY CONNECTING BACK
TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY POINT 

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.892
THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 
ARGUING. SO WE SAW ACTION FROM 

01:18:22.126 --> 01:18:24.126
PUMP -- TRUMP

01:18:28.677 --> 01:18:30.962
REPORTEDLY FURIOUS OVER THAT AS 
WELL AS LAWMAKERS ON REPUBLICAN 

01:18:31.197 --> 01:18:33.197
AND DEMOCRATIC SIDE SAYING IT 
WAS NONEFFECTIVE ARGUMENT THAT 

01:18:33.328 --> 01:18:35.328
WAS PRESENTED TO SENATORS A DAY.

01:18:39.642 --> 01:18:42.375
ONE THING WE WILL BE WATCHING 
FOR TOMORROW, WHEN WE EXPECT TO 

01:18:42.611 --> 01:18:44.690
SEE TRUMP SLAYERS BACK ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR SPEAKING, IS 

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.920
WHETHER OR NOT THEY PROVIDE 
SUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS IN DEFENSE

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:49.812
OF TRUMP OR WHETHER OR NOT IT 
CONTINUES TO BE THIS ATTACK ON 

01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:52.588
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND YOU 

01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:57.869
CAN SEE RICK MITT ROMNEY ON YOUR
SCREEN BARELY INSIDE THE DOORS 

01:18:58.281 --> 01:19:02.012
AND GETTING SURROUNDED BY 
REPORTERS. JAMES, THAT IS WHAT A

01:19:02.242 --> 01:19:04.242
REPORTER GAGGLE LOOKS LIKE THESE
DAYS WITH

01:19:08.798 --> 01:19:11.124
COVERED RESTRICTIONS. THAT IS A 
LOT OF PEOPLE AT ONCE. USUALLY 

01:19:11.348 --> 01:19:14.492
THERE WOULD BE SO MANY MORE IF 
IT WEREN'T FOR COVID AS WELL AS 

01:19:14.725 --> 01:19:16.725
THE HEALTH MEASURES AND ALSO 
COURSE SECURITY MEASURES THAT 

01:19:16.821 --> 01:19:18.821
ARE

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.623
TAKING PLACE. JOURNALISTS ARE 
THANKFULLY STILL ABLE TO ROAM 

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:26.373
THE HALLS, TALK TO SENATORS, GET
THEM ON THE RECORD AND ON 

01:19:26.608 --> 01:19:29.151
BACKGROUND. THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE
RIGHT THERE. JAMES, PART OF THE 

01:19:29.379 --> 01:19:31.702
JOB OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
TODAY IS TO DO A PRE-REBUTTAL.

01:19:35.277 --> 01:19:37.393
TO ANTICIPATE THE ARGUMENTS OF 
TRUMP SLAYERS. WE ARE HEARING 

01:19:37.621 --> 01:19:41.576
RHONDA AND JOYCE SUGGEST SOME OF
THESE LINES LIKE FAMOUS SPEECH, 

01:19:41.807 --> 01:19:45.874
ETC. HOW TO IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS
NEED TO THINK ABOUT AND PREPARE 

01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:50.443
THE JURY FOR WHAT THEY WILL HEAR
WHEN TRUMP SLAYERS FINALLY TAKE 

01:19:50.674 --> 01:19:56.339
THE FLOOR? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE GOT A GOOD LITTLE TASTE OF

01:19:56.809 --> 01:20:04.430
THAT FOX CLIP AND ON THE OPENING
DAY, THE PRESIDENT DEFENSE 

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:07.731
LAWYERS CRITICIZE THE 
PROSECUTION FOR PLAYING THE 

01:20:07.956 --> 01:20:10.271
VIDEO AND THEN THEY PLAYED A 
VIDEO OF DEMOCRATS SAYING TRUMP 

01:20:10.496 --> 01:20:12.496
SHOULD BE IMPEACHED.

01:20:15.342 --> 01:20:18.032
AND YOU SHOULD FIGHT, FIGHT, 
FIGHT. I THINK THERE WILL BE A 

01:20:18.264 --> 01:20:20.834
LOT OF FALSE EQUIVALENCY AND IT 
IS GOING TO BE INCUMBENT UPON 

01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:23.533
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, IN 
THEIR PRE-REBUTTAL TODAY TO 

01:20:24.242 --> 01:20:28.069
ESSENTIALLY SAY, THAT DIDN'T 
LEAD TO THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE. 

01:20:28.298 --> 01:20:32.400
THAT THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN 
THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST LANE OLD 

01:20:32.642 --> 01:20:38.159
REGULAR SPEECH OR A FIERY 
CAMPAIGN RALLY. THERE'S BEEN 

01:20:38.399 --> 01:20:42.972
YEARS AND YEARS OF LAYING THE 
GROUNDWORK FOR WHAT HAPPENED 

01:20:43.597 --> 01:20:45.597
JANUARY 6.

01:20:50.437 --> 01:20:52.777
TED CRUZ, WHOSE OUT THERE SAYING
IT DOESN'T MEET THE LEGAL 

01:20:53.016 --> 01:20:55.118
DEFINITION OF INCITEMENT, IN 
2016 HE WAS SAYING DONALD TRUMP 

01:20:55.347 --> 01:20:57.905
IS INCITING A MOB. HE IS 
INCITING WRITERS. HE IS CAUSING 

01:20:58.129 --> 01:21:00.911
VIOLENCE AT HIS RALLIES BY 
RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE 

01:21:01.142 --> 01:21:03.142
COMMENTS.

01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:09.147
CRUZ COMPARED TRUMP TO A MOB 
BOSS WHEN HE AND ROGER STONE AND

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:11.437
OTHER TRUMP ALLIES WERE 
HARASSING CRUZ

01:21:18.787 --> 01:21:20.787
DELEGATES AT THE REPUBLICAN 
CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND 4 YEARS 

01:21:20.883 --> 01:21:23.320
AGO. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, ALL 
THE JURORS HAVE BEEN WATCHING 

01:21:23.547 --> 01:21:28.565
THIS PLAY OUT FOR YEARS. THEY 
KNOW THAT TRUMP'S RHETORIC OFTEN

01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:30.939
TIMES IS NOT A STANDARD 
POLITICAL PIECE SPEECH AND IT'S 

01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:35.014
GOING TO BE KIND OF -- THEY ALL 
KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. BUT THE 

01:21:35.239 --> 01:21:37.573
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE GOING 
TO HAVE TO EXPLICITLY MAKE THAT 

01:21:37.799 --> 01:21:42.538
POINT. TO GET OUT FRONT OF WHAT 
WE EXPECT TOMORROW. 

01:21:42.539 --> 01:21:48.473
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT
WE ANTICIPATE TODAY. IN TERMS OF

01:21:48.712 --> 01:21:51.247
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, TRYING
TO SHOW TRUMP STATE OF MIND AND 

01:21:51.478 --> 01:21:55.080
ACTIONS AND THE LACK OF REMORSE 
THAT HE HAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE 

01:21:55.782 --> 01:22:02.448
AFTERMATH OF THE CAPITOL ATTACK.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, HIS 

01:22:03.194 --> 01:22:07.212
UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE 
ELECTION RESULTS, WHICH IS OF 

01:22:07.437 --> 01:22:10.664
COURSE ROLLED INTO THE REASON 
WHY PEOPLE SAY THEY STORMED THE 

01:22:11.248 --> 01:22:13.248
CAPITOL. 

01:22:16.939 --> 01:22:19.777
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 
PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST

01:22:20.014 --> 01:22:22.800
NIGHT IN SHOWING THAT HE DID NOT
SHOW ANY REMORSE. THEY ARE ALSO 

01:22:23.022 --> 01:22:26.114
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HARM 
DONE AFTER THE INSTRUCTION AND 

01:22:26.369 --> 01:22:31.987
HOW HE ACTED ON THOSE, TOO. I'M 
NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING TO BE 

01:22:32.217 --> 01:22:35.071
PART OF THAT EXACT PART OF THE 
ARGUMENT TODAY. BUT IT COULD 

01:22:35.324 --> 01:22:38.515
INVOLVE DISCUSSING THE OFFICER, 
WHO WAS KILLED. IN FACT THREE 

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:41.154
OFFICERS DIED

01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:48.368
IN RELATION TO THE EVENTS OF 
JANUARY 6. BUT ONE DIED FROM 

01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:51.081
INJURIES HERE ON THE HILL. AND 
OF COURSE, THERE WERE TRUMP 

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:53.341
SUPPORTERS WHO ALSO PASSED AWAY 
BECAUSE OF THE INSURRECTION. 

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:56.005
THEY ARE LIKELY GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT SOME OF THE AFTERMATH AND 

01:22:56.242 --> 01:22:58.352
THE EFFECTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
WORDS. THIS IS SOMETHING AGAIN 

01:22:58.583 --> 01:23:00.617
THAT IS GOING TO LAY THE 
GROUNDWORK FOR THAT

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:07.672
PRE-BUTTAL OF WHAT HIS TEAM IS 
GOING TO COME TALK ABOUT 

01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:10.974
TOMORROW. YOU MIGHT HEAR FROM  
HIS TEAM, TOO, THAT HE DID NOT 

01:23:11.211 --> 01:23:14.927
DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN OTHER
POLITICIANS. I AM HEARING THAT 

01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:18.191
THEY ARE CONSIDERING BRINGING UP
THAT SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT 

01:23:18.783 --> 01:23:21.661
CONCEDED. ELECTIONS QUICKLY. 
THAT IS SOMETHING I HEARD OTHER 

01:23:22.074 --> 01:23:25.187
REPUBLICANS SAY THAT STACEY 
ABRAMS, FOR INSTANCE DID NOT 

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:30.693
CONCEDE HER RACE, THE 
GUBERNATORIAL RACE IN 2018. AND 

01:23:30.951 --> 01:23:34.960
JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOVERNOR 
KEMP OF GEORGIA WON INSTEAD OF 

01:23:35.188 --> 01:23:37.766
ACTUALLY CONCEDING. SO THEY MAY 
TRY TO USE THAT UP AGAINST THE 

01:23:38.192 --> 01:23:40.192
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

01:23:42.766 --> 01:23:44.591
ARGUMENT THAT HE HAD 
LONG-STANDING BEHAVIOR OF SAYING

01:23:44.592 --> 01:23:47.954
THAT THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED. SO
THAT IS SORT OF THE PLAN FOR 

01:23:48.418 --> 01:23:53.765
TODAY. BUT I THINK WE ALL SHOULD
STAY TUNED BECAUSE I THINK THE 

01:23:54.013 --> 01:23:57.929
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE REALLY 
GOING TO TRY TO HAVE A VERY 

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.622
STRONG ARGUMENT TO AND ON TODAY.
I THINK OUT OF ALL

01:24:06.181 --> 01:24:09.068
OF THE HOURS WE HAVE SPENT IN 
THE LAST FEW DAYS, LOOKING AT 

01:24:09.309 --> 01:24:10.982
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS' 
PREPARATION, YOU'RE SAYING THAT 

01:24:10.983 --> 01:24:14.299
THEY DID NOT GO INTO THIS IN ANY
SORT OF LIGHT WAY. THIS IS NOT 

01:24:14.535 --> 01:24:16.563
IMPEACHMENT LIGHT. THEY ARE 
DOING ALL THE WORK THAT 

01:24:16.797 --> 01:24:18.797
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS USUALLY DO.
AND EVEN IT IS SAID

01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:25.750
WE ALREADY KNOW THE OUTCOME THAT
IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO GET 

01:24:25.983 --> 01:24:28.575
THE TWO THIRDS VOTE TO CONVICT 
HIM, YOU MIGHT SUSPECT THEY 

01:24:28.817 --> 01:24:31.019
MIGHT BE TAKING THINGS, YOU 
KNOW, A LITTLE LESS SERIOUSLY. 

01:24:31.261 --> 01:24:33.664
BUT THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE VERY 
PASSIONATE, THEY ARE INVOKING 

01:24:33.899 --> 01:24:35.899
THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES 
IN THIS.

01:24:41.595 --> 01:24:44.451
YOU SEE THAT A LOT IN THEIR 
ARGUMENTS. SO I SUSPECT IT IS 

01:24:44.685 --> 01:24:47.043
GOING TO REMAIN PASSIONATE AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:50.181
BRING HOME THE FACT THAT ALL OF 
THOSE IN THE ROOM WERE VICTIMS 

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:52.418
OF JANUARY 6. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SEYMOUR SENATORS COMING INTO 

01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:54.607
THE BUILDING. IT LOOKS LIKE -- 
TAMMY BALDWIN OF WISCONSIN. 

01:24:54.846 --> 01:24:57.237
JAMES, RHONDA BROUGHT UP AN 
IMPORTANT POINT OF THE 

01:24:57.468 --> 01:24:59.468
DEVASTATING REPERCUSSIONS OF 
THIS ATTACK ON

01:25:05.263 --> 01:25:07.445
OFFICER SICKNICK WHO DIED, HIS 
FAMILY, AND THEN THESE TWO 

01:25:07.687 --> 01:25:09.826
POLICE OFFICERS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY
HAVE TAKEN THEIR OWN LIVES AFTER

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.672
THE ATTACK. WE DID GET A SENSE 
YESTERDAY OF THE BRUTALITY IN 

01:25:12.918 --> 01:25:15.037
THAT FOOTAGE. BUT ONE OF THE 
JOBS OF THESE IMPEACHMENT 

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.435
MANAGERS IS TO SHOW THE LASTING 
REPERCUSSIONS AND THE DAMAGE 

01:25:18.676 --> 01:25:20.676
DONE

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.830
BY THIS ATTACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE 

01:25:25.058 --> 01:25:27.977
PART OF TODAY. IT WILL BE -- 
OBVIOUSLY WE SAW THE IMMEDIATE 

01:25:28.213 --> 01:25:31.650
HARM. EVEN CONGRESSIONAL 
STAFFERS NEEDING THERAPY AND 

01:25:32.353 --> 01:25:37.801
BEING TRAUMATIZED. THE EFFECT 
KIND OF ON THE NATIONAL PSYCHE, 

01:25:38.039 --> 01:25:43.316
THE FEELING OF FRAGILITY, THE 
LONG-TERM REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS.

01:25:43.798 --> 01:25:48.674
THE WAY THAT THE WORLD WATCHED 
WHAT HAPPENED AND RESPONDED TO 

01:25:48.909 --> 01:25:54.595
IT. BOTH OUR ALLIES AND 
ADVERSARIES OF AMERICA, IT MADE 

01:25:54.827 --> 01:26:02.001
US LOOK WEAK. SO THAT IS ONE OF 
THE REASONS YOU 

01:26:02.697 --> 01:26:05.450
THERE WAS TANGIBLE HARM FROM 
WHAT HAPPENED.

01:26:10.978 --> 01:26:13.115
THIS WASN'T JUST AN ISOLATED 
INCIDENT. THAT THIS WASN'T JUST 

01:26:13.353 --> 01:26:15.898
200 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
CHARGED. THIS KIND OF SHOOK 

01:26:16.132 --> 01:26:19.187
DEMOCRACY TO ITS CORE. AND IT IS
-- IT IS REMARKABLE

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.655
HOW CLOSE THE MOB CAME TO 
STOPPING CERTIFICATION OF THE 

01:26:25.888 --> 01:26:32.191
RESULTS ON JANUARY 6. IT WASN'T 
A SURE THING, THAT THE SENATE 

01:26:32.432 --> 01:26:34.952
AND HOUSE WOULD COME BACK INTO 
SESSION LATE THAT NIGHT. IT 

01:26:35.185 --> 01:26:39.453
COULD'VE GOTTEN PUSHED OFF. I 
THINK THE 75 DAYS BETWEEN THE 

01:26:39.687 --> 01:26:44.866
ELECTION AND THE INAUGURATION 
WAS A STRESS TEST FOR DEMOCRACY.

01:26:45.102 --> 01:26:47.255
ONE OF THE THINGS THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE TRYING 

01:26:47.496 --> 01:26:49.975
TO SHOW IS THAT DEMOCRACY WAS 
MORE FRAGILE THAN WE REALIZED. 

01:26:50.212 --> 01:26:53.602
AND THAT IT CAME CLOSER TO 
FALLING APART. 

01:26:53.603 --> 01:26:58.751
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, AS WE LEFT YESTERDAY, 
WE HEARD SENATOR MIKE LEE 

01:26:59.001 --> 01:27:03.965
OBJECTING, -- LIKE THE PROTOCOL.
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY SAYING, THE 

01:27:04.217 --> 01:27:09.216
EVIDENCE WAS A -- INTRODUCED 
ABOUT THE PHONE CALL HE TOOK WAS

01:27:09.946 --> 01:27:11.946
NOT FACTUAL.

01:27:15.385 --> 01:27:18.614
HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT TODAY TO 
CLEAN THAT UP AND DEAL WITH IT? 

01:27:18.857 --> 01:27:21.468
AND AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
EARLIER, DOES IT ACTUALLY OFFER 

01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:25.021
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO 
DIG MORE INTO THE DETAIL OF THE 

01:27:25.497 --> 01:27:29.209
TIMELINE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP 
WAS DOING, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO

01:27:33.346 --> 01:27:35.348
STOP THE RIOT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, A LOT OF REPUBLICAN 

01:27:35.594 --> 01:27:38.272
SENATORS WERE MENTIONED BY NAME.
AND WERE FEATURED IN 

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.713
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE. SO IT IS 
INTERESTING, IF YOU OPEN THAT 

01:27:40.945 --> 01:27:46.617
DOOR THIS IS ONE OF THE CLASSIC 
CONGRESSIONAL THINGS. NO ONE IS 

01:27:46.865 --> 01:27:48.650
REALLY SCOURING THROUGH THE 
ACTUAL CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 

01:27:48.651 --> 01:27:51.122
MIKE LEE WAS DEMANDING THAT THE 
REFERENCE TO HIM AND BASICALLY 

01:27:51.375 --> 01:27:55.320
THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE FORMAL 
TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRIAL BE 

01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:58.588
STRICKEN, DELETED. IN DOING SO 
HE BRINGS FAR MORE ATTENTION

01:28:02.776 --> 01:28:05.505
TO THE UNDERLYING CLAIM WHICH 
WAS BASED ON THE CNN REPORT. BUT

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:08.969
THERE WAS ALSO AN INTERVIEW THAT
MIKE LEE GAVE IN SALT LAKE CITY 

01:28:09.209 --> 01:28:11.817
WHERE HE BASICALLY SAID THE SAME
THING. THAT HE WAS THEN DENYING 

01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:14.050
LAST NIGHT.

01:28:19.921 --> 01:28:22.530
I DO THINK HE OPENED THE DOOR TO
THAT. BUT ULTIMATELY HOUSE 

01:28:22.767 --> 01:28:24.767
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS DON'T WANT 
TO LOOK HOSTILE AND ANTAGONISTIC

01:28:24.868 --> 01:28:26.868
TOWARD REPUBLICAN SENATORS. THEY
ARE NOT PRESENTING THEM AS 

01:28:26.984 --> 01:28:28.984
ACCOMPLICES. THEY ARE PUTTING 
THIS ENTIRELY ON DONALD TRUMP. 

01:28:29.116 --> 01:28:31.832
SO I THINK YOU SAW WITH JAMIE 
RASKIN LAST NIGHT SAYING OKAY, 

01:28:32.061 --> 01:28:35.087
WHAT MIKE LEE SAID ISN'T CENTRAL
TO OUR CASE AT ALL. SO WE ARE 

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.997
FINE GETTING RID OF IT WITH THE 
STIPULATION THAT THEY MIGHT COME

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:42.388
BACK TODAY AND TRY TO RELITIGATE
IT OR ARGUE IT SOMEHOW. IT WAS A

01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:44.625
TACTICAL RETREAT IN SOME WAYS 
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T 

01:28:44.724 --> 01:28:47.473
MATTER WHAT MIKE LEE SAID. WHAT 
MATTERS IS WHAT TRUMP SAID.

01:28:51.023 --> 01:28:53.714
AND DEMOCRATS, I THINK THIS 
COULD END UP FORCING SOME OF THE

01:28:53.945 --> 01:28:56.905
OTHER SENATORS TO COMMENT 
PUBLICLY ON WHAT TRUMP DID OR 

01:28:57.148 --> 01:29:00.064
DIDN'T DO. BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM 
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF 

01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:02.293
JANUARY 6 THAT

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:09.682
TRUMP WAS MAKING TONS OF CALLS. 
WE ALSO KNOW BY THE WAY FROM 

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.001
REPORTING THAT TRUMP CONTINUES 
TO MAKE CALLS. THIS ISN'T 

01:29:12.231 --> 01:29:14.231
IMPROPER BUT

01:29:17.927 --> 01:29:20.362
TRUMP IS WORKING THE JURY. TRUMP
IS TALKING TO LINDSEY GRAHAM 

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:22.693
YESTERDAY. TRUMP IS CALLING UP 
THE SENATORS AND CLOSELY 

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:25.296
FOLLOWING THE PROCEEDINGS. SO IF
YOU OPEN THE DOOR OF TRUMP 

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:27.922
COMMUNICATIONS, I THINK YOU 
WOULD DISCOVER THAT TRUMP IS FAR

01:29:28.165 --> 01:29:30.521
MORE HANDS-ON AND INVOLVED WITH 
THIS PROCESS AS IT IS PLAYING 

01:29:30.766 --> 01:29:32.766
OUT, EVEN

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.687
IN THE MONTH AFTER JANUARY 6, 
THAT IS PUBLICLY KNOWN. 

01:29:37.688 --> 01:29:39.326
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;JAMES, THE PLAN TODAY IS TO  

01:29:39.327 --> 01:29:40.497
HEAR JAMES, THE THE IMPEACHMENT 
PLAN MANAGERS TODAY AND IS 

01:29:40.498 --> 01:29:41.496
TOMORROW THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT 
LEGAL MANAGERS TEAM AND HAS 

01:29:41.497 --> 01:29:42.911
TOMORROW THEIR TRUMPS TURN. 
LEGAL THIS TEAM COULD HAS WRAP 

01:29:42.912 --> 01:29:44.538
UP POSSIBLY BY THEIR SATURDAY?
TURN. COULD  WRAP UP 

01:29:44.539 --> 01:29:46.070
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BY YEAH, SATURDAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT YEAH, REALLY IT COULD. AND

01:29:46.071 --> 01:29:49.142
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE 
DEMOCRATS COVERED MORE GROUND 

01:29:49.374 --> 01:29:51.320
THAN I EXPECTED REALLY TO COULD.
YESTERDAY.  AND ONE OF THOSE 

01:29:51.321 --> 01:29:53.007
THINGS WHERE DEMOCRATS COVERED 
MORE GROUND THAN I EXPECTED 

01:29:53.008 --> 01:29:55.451
YESTERDAY WITH JUST UNDER EIGHT 
HOURS. THEY REALLY DID COVER THE

01:29:55.633 --> 01:29:57.633
WHOLE LINE UP TO 

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:02.937
JANUARY 6th

01:30:05.094 --> 01:30:07.147
AND JANUARY 6. IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY USE 

01:30:07.343 --> 01:30:09.619
THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS THEY 
DID YESTERDAY. NOT SURE HOW YOU 

01:30:09.801 --> 01:30:12.148
END UP DOING THAT BASED ON THE 
WAY THEY PARSED OUT THEIR CASE 

01:30:12.331 --> 01:30:13.982
YESTERDAY. COULD BE SOME 
REPETITION. CERTAINLY, WE COULD 

01:30:13.983 --> 01:30:16.146
SEE NEW ADDITIONAL VIDEO WE 
DIDN'T SEE END COULD HEAR MORE 

01:30:17.644 --> 01:30:19.644
ABOUT GEORGIA AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S 

01:30:23.197 --> 01:30:25.197
INTERFERENCE THERE

01:30:28.198 --> 01:30:29.750
OR THE PRESIDENT'S INTERFERENCE 
IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN 

01:30:29.751 --> 01:30:31.694
WHERE HE WAS CALLING STATE 
LEGISLATORS AND GETTING THEM TO 

01:30:31.695 --> 01:30:33.680
TRY TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF 
THEIR ELECTION. I DON'T 

01:30:33.681 --> 01:30:35.681
ANTICIPATE USING ALL 

01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:39.979
EIGHT HOURS -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF BECAUSE

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.530
CHAPLAIN JERRY BLACK IS 
DELIVERING THE MORNING PRAYER. 

01:30:43.866 --> 01:30:49.905
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GIVE OUR SENATE JURORS 
DISCERNMENT THAT WILL RESCUE 

01:30:51.733 --> 01:30:56.934
NATION FROM RUIN. ILLUMINATE 
THEIR MINDS WITH 

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:04.101
YOUR TRUTH. AS YOU SPEAK THROUGH
THE WHISPERS OF CONSCIENCE. 

01:31:08.283 --> 01:31:14.744
REMIND THEM THAT THE SEEDS THEY 
PLANT NOW WILL BRING A HARVEST 

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:20.280
MADE THE CHOICES THEY MAKE BRING
BLESSINGS, HEALING, 

01:31:22.671 --> 01:31:24.671
PROSPERITY. TO 

01:31:26.706 --> 01:31:28.706
OUR LAND. WE PRAY IN YOUR 

01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:34.416

01:31:40.582 --> 01:31:42.582
FLAG, TO  OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA.

AND TO THE NATION THAT IT 

01:31:53.086 --> 01:31:55.086
STANDS --

01:32:06.916 --> 01:32:08.916

ARE NO OBJECTIONS,

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEAR YE HEAR YE 

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:23.542
HEAR YE, ALL PERSONS ARE 
COMMANDED TO KEEP SILENT ON PAIN

AND IMPRISONMENT WHILE THE 
SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS 

01:32:26.532 --> 01:32:30.387
SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED

01:32:30.568 --> 01:32:33.274
BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
AGAINST DONALD JOHN TRUMP, 

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:37.378
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 

01:32:37.379 --> 01:32:41.477
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE WILL BE IN ORDER. 
AND THE MAJORITY LEADER IS 

01:32:46.013 --> 01:32:48.013
RECOGNIZED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS 

01:32:51.447 --> 01:32:53.447
MY UNDERSTANDING

01:32:58.809 --> 01:33:00.348
THAT SCHEDULED TODAY WILL BE

01:33:32.339 --> 01:33:33.749
OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU. 

01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:37.583
SENATOR, TO GET COLORADO WILL 
SHOW HOW THE INSURRECTIONIST 

01:33:37.768 --> 01:33:40.595
STEM CELLS BELIEVED THEY WERE 
FOLLOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

01:33:45.309 --> 01:33:47.309
MARCHING ORDERS.

01:34:09.685 --> 01:34:11.685
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, 
YESTERDAY WAS AN EMOTIONALLY 

01:34:12.496 --> 01:34:14.536
WRENCHING DAY. AS I WATCHED THE 
FOOTAGE OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE 

01:34:14.721 --> 01:34:17.406
CAPITOL BUILDING,  MY OWN 
EXPERIENCE FLOODED BACK 

01:34:21.498 --> 01:34:24.024
TO ME. I WAS ONE OF THE UNLUCKY 
MEMBERS WHO WAS STUCK IN THE 

01:34:24.594 --> 01:34:26.594
HOUSE GALLERY ALONG WITH 

01:34:29.235 --> 01:34:31.235
CONGRESSWOMAN DEAN. AS THE HOUSE
FLOOR WAS CLEARED BENEATH US OF 

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:33.486
MEMBERS AND STAFF, WE COULD SEE 
THE MOB POUNDING ON 

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.854
THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE CHAMBER. 
WE COULD SEE THE CAPITOL POLICE 

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:42.593
OFFICERS INSIDE THE CHAMBER 
PULLED THEIR GUNS AND POINT THEM

01:34:42.775 --> 01:34:45.445
AT THE INTRUDERS. THEN WE HEARD 
GUNSHOTS ON THE 

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.920
OTHER SIDE AND WE FLUNG 
OURSELVES DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND 

01:34:51.028 --> 01:34:55.676
REMOVED OUR MEMBER PINS. THEN WE
HEARD POUNDING ON THE VERY 

01:34:55.859 --> 01:34:57.859
FLIMSY GALLERY DOORS RIGHT ABOVE

01:35:00.454 --> 01:35:02.696
US. FINALLY, AFTER THAT 
SITUATION FOR SOME TIME, WE WERE

01:35:02.887 --> 01:35:08.328
TOLD TO RUN OUT OF A DOOR AT THE
END OF THE GALLERY. AS WE RAN 

01:35:08.513 --> 01:35:12.742
THROUGH A LINE OF POLICE TOWARD 
A STAIRCASE, THIS IS WHAT I SAW.

01:35:12.927 --> 01:35:14.927
THE 

01:35:16.764 --> 01:35:19.999
S.W.A.T. TEAM POINTING AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS AT MORE RODDERS ON THE 

01:35:20.188 --> 01:35:22.188
FLOOR LOOKING AT THESE PEOPLE 

01:35:24.081 --> 01:35:26.841
MAKES YOU WONDER WHO SENT THEM 
HERE? IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES I 

01:35:27.127 --> 01:35:29.127
WANT TO 

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.304
STEP BACK FROM THE HORRORS OF 
THE ATTACK ITSELF AND LOOK AT 

01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:36.490
JANUARY 6 FROM A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. THE 

01:35:36.496 --> 01:35:38.496
PERSPECTIVE OF 

01:35:41.604 --> 01:35:43.604
THE INSURRECTIONIST'S

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:52.715
THEMSELVES. THEIR OWN STATEMENTS
BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE 

01:35:52.716 --> 01:35:54.764
ATTACK MAY CLEAR THE ATTACK WAS 
DONE FOR DONALD TRUMP AT HIS 

01:35:54.961 --> 01:35:56.961
INSTRUCTIONS AND TO FULFILL HIS 
WISHES. DONALD TRUMP HAD SENT 

01:35:57.971 --> 01:35:59.971
THEM THERE. THEY TRULY BELIEVED 
THAT THE 

01:36:03.739 --> 01:36:05.693
WHOLE INTRUSION WAS AT THE 
PRESIDENT'S ORDERS AND WE KNOW 

01:36:05.694 --> 01:36:08.799
THAT BECAUSE THEY SAID SO. MANY 
OF THEM ACTUALLY POSED FOR 

01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:10.990
PICTURES, BRAGGING ABOUT IT ON 

01:36:13.013 --> 01:36:16.204
SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THEY TAGGED 
MR. TRUMP IN TWEETS. FOLKS, THIS

01:36:16.389 --> 01:36:18.389
WAS NOT A HIDDEN CRIME. 

01:36:20.746 --> 01:36:22.867
THE PRESIDENT TOLD THEM TO BE 
THERE, AND SO THEY ACTUALLY 

01:36:23.063 --> 01:36:25.063
BELIEVED THEY WOULD FACE NO 
PUNISHMENT. 

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:30.199
THE DEFENSE ARGUED IN THEIR 
BRIEFS AND ARGUED AGAIN HERE 

01:36:34.483 --> 01:36:36.336
ON TUESDAY THAT THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS WERE ACTING ON 

01:36:36.337 --> 01:36:38.337
THEIR OWN, THAT THEY WERE NOT 
INCITED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP OR 

01:36:38.373 --> 01:36:40.373
ACTING  AT HIS DIRECTION. THIS 
IS IN THEIR 

01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.026
BRIEF, QUOTE, THEY DID SO OF 
THEIR OWN ACCORD AND FOR THEIR 

01:36:48.216 --> 01:36:50.046
OWN REASONS AND ARE BEING 
CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. BUT THAT 

01:36:50.047 --> 01:36:54.431
IS JUST NOT THE CASE.  IT IS NOT
WHAT THE INSURRECTIONISTS 

01:36:54.618 --> 01:36:56.618
ACTUALLY SAID.  

01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:01.212
THEY SAID, THEY CAME HERE 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT INSTRUCTED

01:37:01.213 --> 01:37:03.314
THEM TO DO SO. LEADING UP TO THE

01:37:08.089 --> 01:37:10.098
ATTACK, THE INSURRECTIONISTS 
SAID THEY WERE COMING TO D.C. 

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.678
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE INVITED 
THEM  WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS 

01:37:12.859 --> 01:37:18.546
FOR A SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE 
AND WITH CLEAR ORDERS. STOP THE 

01:37:18.812 --> 01:37:20.812
FIGHT 

01:37:23.329 --> 01:37:25.184
-- TO FIGHT TO STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION IN CONGRESS, BY 

01:37:25.185 --> 01:37:27.185
ANY MEANS NECESSARY. THE 

01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:33.912
CROWD HAD DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH 
ECHOED AND CHANTED HIS WORDS, 

01:37:34.097 --> 01:37:35.997
AND WHEN PEOPLE IN THE CROWD 
FOLLOWED HIS DIRECTION AND 

01:37:35.998 --> 01:37:37.998
MARCHED TO THE CAPITOL, THEY 
CHANTED  THE 

01:37:41.138 --> 01:37:43.606
SAME WORDS AS THEY BREACHED THIS
BUILDING. LET'S RETURN TO THE 

01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:47.237
SPEECH FOR A MOMENT. DURING THE 
RALLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP LED THE 

01:37:47.427 --> 01:37:52.550
CROWD IN A STOP THE STEEL CHANT.
HERE IS WHAT THE CHANT SOUNDED 

01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:55.537
LIKE FROM THE CROWDS'S 

01:38:00.544 --> 01:38:03.071
PERSPECTIVE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF YOU PEOPLE CAME UP 

01:38:03.252 --> 01:38:05.252
WITH, WE WILL STOP 

01:38:08.403 --> 01:38:12.127
THE STEEL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; STOP THUS STEEL! STOP THE 

01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:15.390
STEEL! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

01:38:18.547 --> 01:38:21.920
SOON AFTER THE PRESIDENT BASKED 
AS THE CROWD CHANTED FIGHT FOR 

01:38:22.101 --> 01:38:24.101
TRUMP, AND 

01:38:26.843 --> 01:38:28.843
WHEN HE

01:38:33.387 --> 01:38:34.945
INCITED THE CROWD TO SHOW 
STRENGTH, PEOPLE RESPONDED, 

01:38:34.946 --> 01:38:36.842
STORM THE CAPITOL, INVADE THE 
CAPITOL, HERE ARE THOSE MOMENTS 

01:38:36.843 --> 01:38:38.843
FROM THE CROWD'S PERSPECTIVE 

01:38:41.329 --> 01:38:43.907
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT FOR TRUMP! FIGHT FOR 

01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:46.116
TRUMP! FIGHT FOR TRUMP! FIGHT 

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:51.465
FOR TRUMP!

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:59.660
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE TO SHOW STRENGTH! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

01:39:04.302 --> 01:39:05.528
YEAH! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER 

01:39:05.529 --> 01:39:07.529
PERSPECTIVE FROM 

01:39:10.298 --> 01:39:12.857
THIS MOMENT. ONLINE EXTREMIST 
CHEDDAR. AT THE SAME TIME AS THE

01:39:13.051 --> 01:39:15.345
PEOPLE IN THE CROWD SHOUTED,  
TAKE THE CAPITOL 

01:39:19.997 --> 01:39:21.997
BUILDING 

01:39:26.513 --> 01:39:28.513
, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID SHOW 
STRENGTH, THE PERSON POST ON 

01:39:28.654 --> 01:39:30.654
PARLER SAYING, QUOTE, TIME TO 
FIGHT, CIVIL WAR IS UPON US. 

01:39:30.743 --> 01:39:34.246
ANOTHER USER SAID, QUOTE, WE ARE
GOING TO HAVE A CIVIL WAR. GET 

01:39:34.445 --> 01:39:36.445
READY. AN ANALYSIS FOUND MEMBERS
OF 

01:39:38.473 --> 01:39:41.281
CIVIL WAR QUADRUPLED ON PARLER 
IN THE HOUR AFTER DONALD TRUMP 

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.475
SAID, SHOW STRENGTH. 

01:39:45.781 --> 01:39:47.480
WHEN THE INSURRECTIONISTS GOT TO
THE CAPITOL, THEY CONTINUED 

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:49.481
THOSE RALLY 

01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:53.277
CRIES .  INSURRECTIONISTS 
HOLDING CONFEDERATE FLAGS AND 

01:39:53.278 --> 01:39:55.278
BRANDISHING WEAPONS CHEERED  THE
PRESIDENT'S 

01:40:00.074 --> 01:40:02.074
VERY WORDS.

01:40:14.048 --> 01:40:20.799
STOP THE STEEL! STOP THE STEEL! 
STOP THE STEEL! STOP THE 

01:40:23.892 --> 01:40:25.100
STEEL! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HEARD THEM CHANTING 

01:40:25.101 --> 01:40:27.101
STOPPED THE  

01:40:28.961 --> 01:40:31.410
STEAL ,  AND AS THEY CHANTED AT 
THE RALLY, THE CROWD AT THE 

01:40:31.598 --> 01:40:37.818
CAPITOL  MADE CLEAR WHO THEY 
WERE DOING THIS FOR. THEY ALSO 

01:40:38.002 --> 01:40:40.002
CHANTED, FIGHT 

01:40:41.333 --> 01:40:44.515
FOR TRUMP! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT 

01:40:48.786 --> 01:40:50.786
FOR TRUMP! FIGHT FOR TRUMP! 
FIGHT FOR 

01:40:52.999 --> 01:40:54.480
TRUMP! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND IT WASN'T JUST THEY WERE 

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.481
DOING THIS FOR 

01:40:58.202 --> 01:41:00.150
MR. TRUMP, THEY WERE FOLLOWING 
HIS INSTRUCTIONS. THEY SAID HE 

01:41:00.151 --> 01:41:04.678
HAD INVITED THEM, AND IN FACT, 
AS WE HEARD, HE HAD INVITED 

01:41:04.857 --> 01:41:06.857
THEM. AS 

01:41:09.965 --> 01:41:13.975
ONE MAN EXPLAINED ON A 
LIVESTREAM HE TAPED FROM INSIDE 

01:41:14.154 --> 01:41:16.154
THE CAPITOL, QUOTE, OUR 
PRESIDENT WANTS US YEAR.  

01:41:19.796 --> 01:41:21.796
WE WAIT,

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.026
AND TAKE ORDERS, FROM OUR 
PRESIDENT. FOOTAGE FROM INSIDE 

01:41:26.027 --> 01:41:27.721
THE CAPITOL SHOWS WHEN THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS FIRST GOT IN 

01:41:27.722 --> 01:41:29.722
THE BUILDING AND CONFRONTED 
POLICE,  THE MOB SCREAMED AT THE

01:41:29.791 --> 01:41:35.753
OFFICERS THAT THEY WERE 
LISTENING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

01:41:36.028 --> 01:41:38.028
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE ARE 1 MILLION OF US 

01:41:41.734 --> 01:41:43.734
OUT THERE! 

01:41:47.217 --> 01:41:50.010
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE INSURRECTIONISTS ARGUED 
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY 

01:41:50.187 --> 01:41:53.960
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE FIGHTING THEM 
BECAUSE  THEY BELIEVED THAT THE 

01:41:54.139 --> 01:41:56.139
COMMANDER IN CHIEF WAS 

01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:01.730
ORDERING THIS. THIS WAS THE 
PERSON'S UNDERSTANDING. WHEN 

01:42:01.912 --> 01:42:04.289
PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN WENT ON 
TELEVISION THAT DAY TO DEMAND AN

01:42:04.466 --> 01:42:06.466
END TO THE SEAS, ONE WOMAN ASKED

01:42:10.156 --> 01:42:11.685
THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOES HE NOT REALIZE PRESIDENT

01:42:11.686 --> 01:42:13.686
TRUMP 

01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:20.950
CALLED US TO SIEGE THE PLACE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE EXAMPLES OF THESE TYPES 

01:42:21.132 --> 01:42:23.315
OF COMMENTS. DON'T WORRY, I 
WON'T PLAY ALL OF THEM.  BUT IT 

01:42:23.493 --> 01:42:25.493
WASN'T JUST THE WORDS OF THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS THAT PROVED 

01:42:25.553 --> 01:42:29.195
THAT THEY DID THIS IN RESPONSE  
TO ORDERS FROM THEIR 

01:42:29.374 --> 01:42:33.394
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WE CAN SEE 
THIS IN THE FACT THAT THEY WERE 

01:42:38.058 --> 01:42:40.347
NOT HIDING. ONE IN A LIVESTREAM 
AT THE CAPITOL SAID, QUOTE, HE 

01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:43.955
WILL BE HAPPY , WE ARE FIGHTING 
FOR 

01:42:47.474 --> 01:42:49.474
TRUMP. 

01:42:51.544 --> 01:42:53.544
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DUDE! TRUMP WOULD BE 

01:42:57.121 --> 01:42:59.211
VERY UPSET! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JUST SAY WE LOVE HIM. WE LOVE

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.400
YOU, BRO. HE WILL 

01:43:03.363 --> 01:43:05.424
BE HAPPY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE 
ARE FIGHTING FOR TRUMP! 

01:43:05.425 --> 01:43:07.425
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THIS WAS NOT AN 

01:43:10.394 --> 01:43:12.137
ISOLATED INSULIN. -- INCIDENT. 
THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE SLIDE 

01:43:12.138 --> 01:43:13.653
POSTED PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES 
COMMITTING THESE CRIMES. TRUMP 

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.683
SUPPORTERS WHO HAD BROKEN INTO 
THE CAPITOL  WERE 

01:43:19.676 --> 01:43:21.740
TAKING SELFIES, STREAMING LIVE 
VIDEOS AND POSING. IN FACT, THEY

01:43:21.921 --> 01:43:23.921
WANTED THE PRESIDENT 

01:43:28.046 --> 01:43:30.976
TO KNOW THIS IS ME, IN FACT THAT
YOU CAN SEE THE PERSON WROTE ON 

01:43:31.159 --> 01:43:35.251
HIS OWN POSTING, THIS IS ME! AND
IF THERE WERE ANY 

01:43:38.804 --> 01:43:40.632
REMAINING DOUBT, AFTER HOURS OF 
PROMPTING, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:43:40.633 --> 01:43:43.928
FINALLY TOLD THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS TO GO HOME , 

01:43:44.115 --> 01:43:46.533
ONLY THEN DID SOME OF THEM BEGIN
TO LISTEN. AS YOU 

01:43:49.626 --> 01:43:53.427
PREVIOUSLY SAW, AT 4:17 P.M., 
MR. TRUMP RELEASED A PRERECORDED

01:43:53.608 --> 01:43:56.197
VIDEO SAYING TO THE MOB, GO 
HOME. WE 

01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:05.601
LOVE YOU.  YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL.
SHORTLY AFTER HE TREATED THIS 

01:44:05.779 --> 01:44:07.779
VIDEO, A FEW OF THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS WHO HAD SEEN IT

01:44:07.801 --> 01:44:09.801
COULD 

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.387
BE CLAIMING -- COULD BE HEARD 
CLAIMING VICTORY AND HER TELLING

01:44:15.569 --> 01:44:17.413
PEOPLE TO GO HOME BECAUSE OF 
DONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE AND 

01:44:17.414 --> 01:44:18.874
INSTRUCTIONS. YOU SAW EARLIER 
THE INSURRECTIONISTS , JACOB 

01:44:18.875 --> 01:44:22.833
CHANSLEY WHO TOLD SOMEONE, 
QUOTE, WE WON THE DAY. A LITTLE 

01:44:23.019 --> 01:44:26.990
BEFORE THAT VIDEO OF JACOB 
CHANSLEY, HE SAID THE SAME THING

01:44:27.175 --> 01:44:32.149
TO THE CROWD THROUGH A BULLHORN 
AND INSTRUCTED THEM TO GO HOME 

01:44:32.341 --> 01:44:36.365
BECAUSE OF THE VIDEO THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TWEETED. 

01:44:41.034 --> 01:44:43.034
LET'S WATCH.

01:44:46.867 --> 01:44:49.957
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WON THE DAY! EVERYONE JUST

01:44:54.815 --> 01:44:56.815
GO HOME! EVERYONE GO 

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.300
HOME! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVEN AFTER THE ATTACK, THE 

01:45:03.448 --> 01:45:06.858
INSURRECTIONISTS MADE CLEAR TO 
LAW ENFORCEMENT  THAT THEY WERE 

01:45:07.047 --> 01:45:10.155
JUST FOLLOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
ORDERS. THEY DIDN'T SHY AWAY 

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:14.761
FROM THEIR CRIMES BECAUSE THEY 
THOUGHT THEY WERE FOLLOWING 

01:45:14.959 --> 01:45:16.959
ORDERS FROM THE 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AND SO THEY 

01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:18.970
WOULD NOT BE PUNISHED. THEY 

01:45:21.465 --> 01:45:23.465
WERE WRONG. AFTER THE ATTACK, 
THERE WERE DOZENS OF ARRESTS. 

01:45:26.102 --> 01:45:28.102
THESE WERE FEDERAL OFFENSES 
INCLUDING ASSAULTING 

01:45:31.817 --> 01:45:33.817
THE POLICE. WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT
INTERVIEWED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE 

01:45:33.935 --> 01:45:38.479
AT THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th , 
THEY ONCE AGAIN SAID IT WAS 

01:45:38.667 --> 01:45:40.667
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TOLD THEM 
TO 

01:45:42.839 --> 01:45:44.839
BE THERE. ROBERT SANFORD WAS 
SEEN IN THIS WIDELY 

01:45:47.475 --> 01:45:51.322
CIRCULATED VIDEO THROWING A FIRE
EXTINGUISHER THAT STRUCK A 

01:45:51.501 --> 01:45:53.501
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER OUTSIDE 
THE 

01:45:56.993 --> 01:45:58.993
BUILDING. 

01:46:06.179 --> 01:46:08.179
A WITNESS TOLD THE 

01:46:12.458 --> 01:46:15.125
FBI THAT SANFORD SAID HE 
TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. ON 

01:46:15.391 --> 01:46:17.391
A BUS WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE. 

01:46:19.827 --> 01:46:22.045
THE GROUP HAD GONE TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND LISTEN TO DONALD J. 

01:46:22.224 --> 01:46:24.224
TRUMP'S SPEECH AND THEN 

01:46:27.085 --> 01:46:28.999
HAD FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT'S 
INSTRUCTIONS AND GONE TO THE 

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.105
CAPITOL. FOLKS, THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS DIDN'T JUST 

01:46:30.106 --> 01:46:36.276
MAKE THIS UP.  AS A SANFORD'S 
LAWYER EXPLAINED, YOU ARE BEING 

01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:38.460
TOLD YOU HAVE TO FIGHT LIKE 

01:46:40.917 --> 01:46:43.110
HELL .  DOES FIGHT LIKE HELL 
MEAN YOU THROW THINGS AT PEOPLE?

01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:47.876
MAYBE.  THE LAWYER ADDED THAT 
HIS CLIENT, QUOTE, WOULDN'T HAVE

01:46:48.064 --> 01:46:52.326
BEEN THERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE
PRESIDENT. NOW SANFORD WASN'T 

01:46:52.512 --> 01:46:58.213
THE EXCEPTION. HE WAS THE RULE. 
IN THEIR STATEMENTS AFTER THE 

01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.763
ATTACK, INSURRECTIONISTS 
ROUTINELY ECHOED WHAT THEY HAD 

01:46:59.764 --> 01:47:01.764
SAID BEFORE  AND DURING 

01:47:04.539 --> 01:47:06.539
THE ATTACK. THEY WERE THERE 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TOLD THEM 

01:47:10.459 --> 01:47:12.574
TO BE. NOW LOOK, THE LAWYERS WHO
ARE SAYING THAT THEIR CLIENTS 

01:47:12.752 --> 01:47:15.831
WERE TOLD TO COMMIT THESE ACTS 
BY MR. TRUMP, WELL, THEY KNOW 

01:47:16.015 --> 01:47:18.015
THAT PUTTING THE BLAME ON 

01:47:21.507 --> 01:47:23.507
THE PRESIDENT

01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:34.742
DOESN'T EXONERATE THEIR CLIENTS.
THEY ARE JUST SAYING IT, 

01:47:34.743 --> 01:47:36.412
FRANKLY, BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED. ANOTHER TRUMP 

01:47:36.413 --> 01:47:38.230
SUPPORTER WHO HAS BEEN FEDERALLY
CHARGED IS TEXAS REAL ESTATE 

01:47:38.231 --> 01:47:40.218
AGENT JENNIFER RYAN. MS. RYAN 
HAS GIVEN MANY TV INTERVIEWS IN 

01:47:40.219 --> 01:47:42.219
WHICH SHE SAID SHE 

01:47:43.916 --> 01:47:45.807
WAS ONLY DOING WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT ASKED HER AND OTHERS 

01:47:45.808 --> 01:47:47.808
TO DO. SHE ALSO RECORDED VIDEO 
BEFORE 

01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:55.382
THE RALLY TALKING ABOUT THE 
MOB'S PLANS FOR VIOLENCE AND 

01:47:55.572 --> 01:47:57.585
HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PERSONALLY I DO NOT FEEL A 

01:47:57.766 --> 01:48:01.340
SENSE OF SHAME OR GUILT FOR MY 
HEART FOR WHAT I WAS DOING. I 

01:48:01.517 --> 01:48:03.345
THOUGHT IT WAS FOLLOWING MY 
PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT IT WAS 

01:48:03.346 --> 01:48:06.640
FOLLOWING BUT WE WERE CALLED TO 
DO. HE ASKED US TO FLY MAC THERE

01:48:06.816 --> 01:48:08.816
AND I WAS ASKING WHAT HE ASKED 
US 

01:48:12.696 --> 01:48:15.695
TO DO. ULTIMATELY, YES, WE WERE 
GOING IN SOLIDARITY WITH 

01:48:15.884 --> 01:48:17.884
PRESIDENT TRUMP. PRESIDENT TRUMP
REQUESTED THAT 

01:48:21.136 --> 01:48:23.136
WE BE

01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:28.456
IN D.C. ON THE SIXTH. SO THIS 
WAS OUR WAY OF GOING AND 

01:48:28.632 --> 01:48:30.422
STOPPING THE STEAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF IT COMES DOWN TO WAR, 

01:48:30.423 --> 01:48:32.423
GUESS WHAT, I WILL BE THERE. WE 
WILL ALL BE THERE 

01:48:35.539 --> 01:48:36.715
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YET ANOTHER TRUMP SUPPORTER 

01:48:36.716 --> 01:48:38.716

SAID HEY, I NEED MY DIGITAL 
SOLDIERS TO SHOW UP ON JANUARY 

01:48:51.184 --> 01:48:55.945
6th AND WE ALL DID. SOME OF 
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO JOINED IN 

01:48:56.123 --> 01:49:00.532
THE ATTACK ON OUR CAPITAL DID SO
AS PART OF OF VIOLENT RACIST 

01:49:00.711 --> 01:49:05.099
GROUP WHICH HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY 
CONDEMNED BY OUR GOVERNMENT 

01:49:05.281 --> 01:49:07.281

01:49:32.068 --> 01:49:34.068
AN IMAGE OF GOODWIN'S 

01:49:36.563 --> 01:49:38.563
OWN TWEET. HE WAS SUCH A LOYAL 
FOLLOWER OF 

01:49:42.482 --> 01:49:44.482
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT HE USED THE
PRESIDENT'S PHOTO AS HIS OWN 

01:49:44.562 --> 01:49:46.562
PROFILE PICTURE 

01:49:49.172 --> 01:49:52.702
ON TWITTER. NOW REMEMBER, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THEM TO 

01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:55.317
STAND BACK AND STAND BY AT THE 
DEBATE. THEY TOOK IT AS A CALL 

01:49:55.497 --> 01:49:57.497
TO ARMS. AND WHEN HE CALLED THEM
TO ARMS, THEY 

01:50:01.407 --> 01:50:04.436
WERE ALL READY TO ACT. THEY WERE
WAITING FOR THEIR ORDERS WHICH 

01:50:04.615 --> 01:50:06.615

HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL. BUT, 
AS I SAID EARLIER, 

01:56:36.199 --> 01:56:38.216
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD

ACTING IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT WITH

01:59:29.696 --> 01:59:31.415
HIS POLITICAL INSTRUCTIONS AND 
HIS EXPLICIT STRATEGY TO RETAIN 

01:59:31.416 --> 01:59:33.416
POWER. 

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.123
THEY DID WHAT HE TOLD THEM TO 
DO. THIS PRO-TRUMP INSURRECTION 

01:59:38.309 --> 01:59:41.720
DID NOT SPRING INTO LIFE OUT OF 
THIN AIR. WE SAW HOW TRUMP SPENT

01:59:41.908 --> 01:59:43.908
MONTHS CULTIVATING AMERICA'S 

01:59:47.090 --> 01:59:51.439
MOST DANGEROUS EXTREMIST GROUPS.
WE SAW HOW HE RILED THEM UP WITH

01:59:51.635 --> 01:59:53.514
CORROSIVE LIES AND VIOLENT 
RHETORIC, SO MUCH SO THEY WERE 

01:59:53.515 --> 01:59:55.218
READY AND EAGER FOR THE MOST 
DANGEROUS MISSION, INVALIDATING 

01:59:55.219 --> 01:59:59.816
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP 
DONALD TRUMP IN OFFICE. WE MUST 

02:00:00.014 --> 02:00:03.598
REMEMBER THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD 

02:00:03.789 --> 02:00:05.789
INFLAMED AND INCITED 

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.780
A MOB.

02:00:12.625 --> 02:00:14.506
TRUMP KNEW HIS INCITEMENT WOULD 
RESULT IN VIOLENCE NOT ONLY 

02:00:14.507 --> 02:00:16.203
BECAUSE OF THE THOUSANDS OF 
VIOLENT MESSAGES THAT WERE 

02:00:16.204 --> 02:00:18.097
POSTED ALL OVER THE FORUMS AND 
THE WIDESPREAD NEWS AND 

02:00:18.098 --> 02:00:20.788
PREPARATIONS FOR VIOLENCE AMONG 
EXTREMIST GROUPS AND HIS 

02:00:20.975 --> 02:00:22.299
COMMUNICATIONS ON TWITTER WITH 
THE INSURRECTIONISTS THEMSELVES 

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:29.125
. HE KNEW IT ALSO BECAUSE HE HAD
SEEN MANY OF THE EXACT SAME 

02:00:29.313 --> 02:00:34.476
GROUPS HE WAS MOBILIZING 
PARTICIPATE IN EXTREMIST 

02:00:39.436 --> 02:00:41.614
VIOLENCE BEFORE. MOREOVER, HE 
HAD SEEN CLEARLY HOW HIS OWN 

02:00:41.804 --> 02:00:44.950
INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE AND 
PRAISE AFTER THE VIOLENCE TOOK 

02:00:47.081 --> 02:00:49.738
PLACE GALVANIZED, ENCOURAGED AND
ELECTRIFIED THESE 

02:00:54.655 --> 02:00:57.409
EXTREMIST FOLLOWERS. THESE 
TACTICS WERE ROAD TESTED. 

02:00:57.594 --> 02:01:02.166
JANUARY 6th WAS A CULMINATION OF
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS, NOT AN 

02:01:02.353 --> 02:01:05.536
ABERRATION FROM THEM. THE 
INSURRECTION WAS THE MOST 

02:01:05.812 --> 02:01:07.812
VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS EPISODE 

02:01:10.069 --> 02:01:12.069
SO FAR IN DONALD TRUMP'S 
CONTINUING PATTERN 

02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:18.270
AND PRACTICE OF INCITING 
VIOLENCE. I EMPHASIZE 

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:24.108
SO FAR.

02:01:29.499 --> 02:01:30.797
EARLIER CONGRESSWOMAN DEGETTE 
SHOWED SEVERAL EPISODES OF 

02:01:30.798 --> 02:01:32.282
TRUMPS INCITEMENT THAT TOOK 
PLACE DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL 

02:01:32.283 --> 02:01:33.744
ELECTION. HIS ENCOURAGEMENT OF 
VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER PUBLIC 

02:01:33.745 --> 02:01:35.935
OFFICIALS  WHO HE THOUGHT HAD 
CROSSED HIM LONG PREDATES THE 

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:42.840
2020 CAMPAIGN.

02:01:44.555 --> 02:01:46.226
THE INCITEMENT OF VIOLENCE IS 
ALWAYS DANGEROUS BUT UNIQUELY 

02:01:46.227 --> 02:01:48.099
INTOLERABLE WHEN DONE BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:50.100
OF AMERICA. BUT THAT BECAME 

02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:56.506
THE NORM. ON PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SWATCH WHITE SUPREMACIST AND 

02:01:56.686 --> 02:01:58.686
EXTREMIST GROUPS HAVE SPREAD 
LIKE WILDFIRE ACROSS 

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:04.160
THE LAND, HIS OWN DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY CALLED 

02:02:04.161 --> 02:02:06.422
HOMEGROWN TERRORISM THE NUMBER 1
THREAT FACING AMERICANS TODAY. 

02:02:06.605 --> 02:02:08.669
BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE 
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT 

02:02:08.855 --> 02:02:10.855
BEGGED HIM 

02:02:13.554 --> 02:02:15.109
TO CONDEMN EXTREME ELEMENTS, 
PROMOTING VIOLENCE AND INDEED 

02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:17.110
CIVIL WAR 

02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:22.250
IN AMERICA

02:02:24.799 --> 02:02:27.257
, AND RACE WAR IN AMERICA, HE 
JUST WOULDN'T DO IT. AND THAT IS

02:02:27.439 --> 02:02:29.438
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO INCITE AND 
PROVOKE THEIR VIOLENCE FOR HIS 

02:02:29.439 --> 02:02:32.791
OWN POLITICAL GAIN AND FOR HIS 
OWN STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. EVER 

02:02:32.968 --> 02:02:34.968
SINCE HE BECAME PRESIDENT, TRUMP
REVEALED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF 

02:02:39.092 --> 02:02:41.092
POLITICAL VIOLENCE

02:02:46.741 --> 02:02:48.744
FOR HIS SIDE. HE PRAISED IT AND 
ENCOURAGED IT. RIGHT NOW I'M 

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:51.408
GOING TO PLAY FOR YOU JUST A FEW
CLIPS FROM OVER THE YEARS WHEN 

02:02:51.587 --> 02:02:52.661
THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS 
SUCCESSFULLY INCITED HIS 

02:02:52.662 --> 02:02:54.662
SUPPORTERS INTO ASSAULTING HIS 

02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:59.500
OPPONENTS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:07.782
USA! USA! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FIRST GROUP, I WAS NICE, 

02:03:07.972 --> 02:03:09.972
TAKE YOUR TIME. THE SECOND 
GROUP, I WAS 

02:03:13.673 --> 02:03:16.353
PRETTY NICE. THE THIRD GROUP, I 
WILL BE A LITTLE MORE VIOLENT. 

02:03:16.533 --> 02:03:18.536
AND THE FOURTH GROUP, I WILL SAY
GET THE HELL OUT OF 

02:03:22.689 --> 02:03:24.689
HERE! 

02:03:27.241 --> 02:03:31.264
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GET HIM THE HELL BACK OUT OF 
HERE  GET HIM OUT OF HERE. THROW

02:03:34.277 --> 02:03:36.088
HIM OUT! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I GOT A LITTLE NOTICE IN CASE

02:03:36.089 --> 02:03:38.089
YOU 

02:03:40.701 --> 02:03:42.701
SEE IT

02:03:48.055 --> 02:03:49.855
, THE SECURITY GUYS, WE HAVE 
WONDERFUL SECURITY GUYS WHO 

02:03:49.856 --> 02:03:51.856
SAID, MR. TRUMP, THERE MAY BE 
SOMEONE WITH TOMATOES IN THE 

02:03:51.964 --> 02:03:53.967
AUDIENCE. SO IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY
GETTING READY TO THROW A TOMATO,

02:03:54.145 --> 02:03:56.123
KNOCK THE CRAB OUT OF THEM, 
WOULD YOU? SERIOUSLY. JUST NOT 

02:03:56.124 --> 02:03:58.832
THE HELL OUT OF THEM.  I PROMISE
I WILL PAY FOR THE LEGAL FEES I 

02:04:03.385 --> 02:04:04.743
PROMISE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, WE HAVE SEEN THESE 

02:04:04.744 --> 02:04:06.744
CLIPS AND MANY MORE LIKE THEM 
BEFORE, BUT 

02:04:10.363 --> 02:04:12.363
THINK ABOUT

02:04:14.625 --> 02:04:16.253
THE BRUTAL POWER AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF HIS WORDS. YOU 

02:04:16.254 --> 02:04:18.253
HEARD HIM. HE TOLD HIS 
SUPPORTERS TO BE A LITTLE MORE 

02:04:18.254 --> 02:04:19.916
VIOLENT AND THEY RESPONDED TO 
HIS COMMAND BY LITERALLY 

02:04:19.917 --> 02:04:21.917
DRAGGING A PROTESTER ACROSS THE 
FLOOR AT ONE OF HIS 

02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:26.970
CAMPAIGN RALLIES.

02:04:31.368 --> 02:04:33.555
HE CRIED, GET HIM THE HELL OUT 
OF HERE, THROW HIM OUT. THE 

02:04:33.735 --> 02:04:35.450
SUPPORTERS PUNCHED AND KICKED 
ANOTHER PROTESTER AS HE WAS 

02:04:35.451 --> 02:04:37.470
ESCORTED FROM THE HALL AND TOLD 
SUPPORTERS TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT

02:04:37.651 --> 02:04:39.855
OF PEOPLE  WHO OPPOSED HIM AND 
PROMISED TO PAY TIME AFTER TIME 

02:04:40.032 --> 02:04:41.949
HE ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE AND 
SUPPORTERS LISTENED AND GOT THE 

02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:43.950
MESSAGE AND WASN'T JUST TRUMPS 
ENCOURAGEMENT 

02:04:47.626 --> 02:04:50.764
OF VIOLENCE THAT CONDITIONED HIS
SUPPORTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN 

02:04:50.953 --> 02:04:52.816
THIS INSURRECTION ON JANUARY 
6th. IT WAS ALSO HIS EXPLICIT 

02:04:52.817 --> 02:04:54.817
SANCTIONING OF THE VIOLENCE 
AFTER IT 

02:04:57.810 --> 02:04:59.810
TOOK PLACE. LET'S WATCH SOME 
INCIDENTS 

02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:04.161
BEGINNING WITH THOSE WHO 
ASSAULTED A BLACK 

02:05:08.859 --> 02:05:10.859
PROTESTER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:05:14.816 --> 02:05:16.877
WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE THAT WERE 
REALLY VIOLENT IN THE PARTICULAR

02:05:17.061 --> 02:05:19.061
ONE WHEN I SAID LIKE THAT WAS 

02:05:23.487 --> 02:05:25.487
A VERY

02:05:29.449 --> 02:05:31.480
-- A GUY WHO WAS SWINGING AND 
VERY LOUD AND STARTED SWINGING 

02:05:31.667 --> 02:05:33.706
AT THE AUDIENCE, AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT, THE AUDIENCE SWUNG BACK. I

02:05:33.973 --> 02:05:35.818
THOUGHT IT WAS VERY, VERY 
APPROPRIATE. HE WAS SWINGING, HE

02:05:35.819 --> 02:05:37.657
WAS HITTING PEOPLE IN THE 
AUDIENCE HIT BACK. AND THAT'S 

02:05:37.658 --> 02:05:39.658
WHAT WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE 

02:05:44.579 --> 02:05:46.579
OF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:05:49.276 --> 02:05:54.378
YOU DID THE SAME THING! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT THE  

02:05:59.204 --> 02:06:03.188
-- YOU JUST BROKE MY GLASSES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE LAST GUY DID THE SAME 

02:06:03.391 --> 02:06:05.586
THING! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU JUST BROKE MY GLASSES! 

02:06:05.768 --> 02:06:08.404
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GREG IS SMART, NEVER WRESTLE 

02:06:11.493 --> 02:06:14.112
HIM. NEVER! ANY GUY THAT CAN DO 
A BODY-SLAM IS 

02:06:19.036 --> 02:06:24.647
MY GUY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WILL NOT REPLACE US! YOU 

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:26.840
WILL NOT 

02:06:29.864 --> 02:06:34.822
REPLACE US! JEWS WILL NOT 
REPLACE US!  JEWS WILL NOT 

02:06:35.004 --> 02:06:37.004
REPLACE US!  

02:06:40.409 --> 02:06:42.409
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:06:52.276 --> 02:06:54.276
I'M NOT EVEN SAYING WE ARE 
NONVIOLENT. WE DID NOT INITIATE 

02:06:54.287 --> 02:06:56.135
FORCE AGAINST ANYBODY. WE ARE 
NOT NONVIOLENT. WE WILL KILL 

02:06:56.136 --> 02:06:58.136
THESE PEOPLE IF WE HAVE 

02:07:02.258 --> 02:07:03.829
TO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THERE IS BLAME ON 

02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:07.649
BOTH SIDES. YOU LOOK AT BOTH 
SIDES, I THINK THERE IS BLAME ON

02:07:07.859 --> 02:07:11.940
BOTH SIDES. YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE 
THAT WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE, ON 

02:07:16.693 --> 02:07:19.787
BOTH SIDES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T CATCH

02:07:19.966 --> 02:07:21.966
ALL OF THAT, 

02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:27.869
THE PRESIDENT PRAISED THE 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO 

02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:30.091
ASSAULTED A JOURNALIST AS MY 
KIND OF GUY, HE SAID THERE WERE,

02:07:30.278 --> 02:07:32.308
QUOTE, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH 
SIDES WHEN THE NEO NAZIS , 

02:07:32.495 --> 02:07:34.495
KLANSMAN AND PROUD BOYS INVADED 

02:07:37.272 --> 02:07:39.272
THE CITY, THE GREAT CITY OF 
CHARLOTTESVILLE AND KILLED 

02:07:43.411 --> 02:07:45.411
HEATHER HEYER

02:07:47.395 --> 02:07:49.890
, AND SAID AN ATTACK ON A BLACK 
PROTESTER AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES 

02:07:50.072 --> 02:07:51.929
WAS VERY, VERY APPROPRIATE. DOES
THAT SOUND FAMILIAR? LISTEN TO 

02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:53.821
HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS OWN CONDUCT

02:07:53.822 --> 02:07:55.822
ON JANUARY 

02:07:57.316 --> 02:07:59.316
6th. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:08:02.869 --> 02:08:04.869
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU READ MY SPEECH AND 

02:08:04.901 --> 02:08:06.918
MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT IN AND 
HAS BEEN ANALYZED AND PEOPLE 

02:08:07.098 --> 02:08:09.098
THOUGHT WHAT I SAID WAS TOTALLY 

02:08:12.661 --> 02:08:14.661
APPROPRIATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:08:16.929 --> 02:08:18.978
SO THERE THE PATTERN IS STARING 
US IN THE FACE. VERY, VERY 

02:08:19.161 --> 02:08:21.161
APPROPRIATE AFTER A MAN WAS 
ASSAULTED AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES.

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:23.753
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE WAS HOW HE 
CHARACTERIZED HIS INCITEMENT OF 

02:08:23.754 --> 02:08:25.754
JANUARY 

02:08:28.271 --> 02:08:30.655
6th. MEANING THAT OF COURSE, IF 
GIVEN THE CHANCE, HE WOULD 

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:32.860
GLADLY DO IT AGAIN, BECAUSE WHY 
WOULD HE NOT ENGAGE IN TOTALLY 

02:08:33.245 --> 02:08:34.985
APPROPRIATE CONDUCT LACKS AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE PAST EIGHT 

02:08:34.986 --> 02:08:37.083
MONTHS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT WHEN 
DONALD TRUMP TELLS THE CROWD AS 

02:08:37.263 --> 02:08:42.167
HE DID ON JANUARY 6,  FIGHT LIKE
HELL OR YOU WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY

02:08:42.355 --> 02:08:44.355
ANYMORE, HE MEANT FOR THEM  TO 
FIGHT LIKE 

02:08:48.238 --> 02:08:50.238
HELL. 

02:08:56.164 --> 02:08:58.164
ON JANUARY 6th THAT BECAME CLEAR
TO ALL OF AMERICA. LET'S 

02:08:58.173 --> 02:09:00.173
CONSIDER THE INVENTS, SENATORS, 
THAT TOOK PLACE IN LAST YEAR IN 

02:09:00.211 --> 02:09:01.675
MICHIGAN WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DEMONSTRATED HIS WILLINGNESS AND

02:09:01.676 --> 02:09:03.141
ABILITY TO INCITE VIOLENCE 
AGAINST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO

02:09:03.142 --> 02:09:10.574
HE THOUGHT WERE GETTING IN HIS 
WAY. WHEN RESPONDING TO 

02:09:10.747 --> 02:09:12.251
EXTREMIST PLOTS IN MICHIGAN, 
TRUMP SHOWED RENEWED THE POWER 

02:09:12.252 --> 02:09:13.972
THE MOB TO ADVANCE HIS POLITICAL
OBJECTIVES. BEGINNING IN MARCH, 

02:09:13.973 --> 02:09:15.989
TRUMP LEVELED ATTACKS ON 
MICHIGAN GOVERNOR GRETCHEN 

02:09:16.155 --> 02:09:18.155
WHITMER FOR THE CORONAVIRUS 

02:09:21.566 --> 02:09:23.566
POLICIES INTERSTATE

02:09:26.539 --> 02:09:28.404
. ON MARCH 17th, THE DAY AFTER 
GOVERNOR WHITMER PUSHED THE 

02:09:28.405 --> 02:09:29.913
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BETTER 
SUPPORT THE STATES ON COVID-19, 

02:09:29.914 --> 02:09:31.914
TRUMP CRITICIZED HER HANDLING OF
THE 

02:09:35.068 --> 02:09:37.068
PANDEMIC TWEETING,

02:09:42.150 --> 02:09:43.732
FAILING MICHIGAN GOVERNOR MUST 
WORK HARDER AND BE MORE 

02:09:43.733 --> 02:09:45.918
PROACTIVE. WE ARE PUSHING HER TO
GET THE JOB DONE. I STAND WITH 

02:09:46.094 --> 02:09:47.982
MICHIGAN. MARCH 27th HE ADDED, I
LOVE MICHIGAN. ONE OF THE 

02:09:47.983 --> 02:09:49.983
REASONS WE ARE DOING SUCH A 
GREAT JOB FOR THEM DURING THIS 

02:09:50.072 --> 02:09:54.055
HORRIBLE PANDEMIC, YET YOUR 
GOVERNOR, GRETCHEN HALF WITMER 

02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:56.232
IS IN OVER HER HEAD, DOESN'T 
HAVE A CLUE, LIKES BLAMING 

02:09:56.233 --> 02:09:58.233
EVERYONE FOR HER 

02:09:59.595 --> 02:10:02.123
OWN INEPTITUDE. HASHTAG MAGA. BY
APRIL HIS NAME-CALLING TURNED TO

02:10:02.297 --> 02:10:04.806
CALLS FOR MASS MOBILIZATION OF 
HIS SUPPORTERS. THIS WAS A SIGN 

02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:11.437
OF THINGS TO COME. ON APRIL 
17th, 2020, EQUATOR, QUOTE, 

02:10:16.412 --> 02:10:19.122
LIBERATE MICHIGAN. NOT EVEN TWO 
WEEKS LATER AND APRIL 30th HIS 

02:10:19.288 --> 02:10:20.933
SUPPORTERS MARCHED ON THE 
MICHIGAN STATE CAPITAL IN 

02:10:20.934 --> 02:10:24.879
LANSING AND STORMED THE 
BUILDING. TRUMPS MARCHING ORDERS

02:10:26.732 --> 02:10:28.732
WERE FOLLOWED BY AGGRESSIVE 
ACTION ON 

02:10:32.446 --> 02:10:35.898
THE GROUND. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE A WHITE! LET US IN! 

02:10:36.068 --> 02:10:39.732
LET US IN LET US IN LET 

02:10:44.661 --> 02:10:46.661
US IN

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE VIDEO SHOWS THE MILITARY 

02:11:16.409 --> 02:11:18.409
PROTESTER SHOWED UP TO TAKE 

02:11:21.572 --> 02:11:23.428
A VIOLENCE THAN AND CAME ARMED 
AND TIGHTLY PACKED THEMSELVES IN

02:11:23.429 --> 02:11:25.429
THE BUILDING FOR NO REGARD FOR 
SOCIAL DISTANCING. THIS TRUMP 

02:11:25.787 --> 02:11:28.100
INSPIRED MOB MAY INDEED LOOK 
FAMILIAR TO YOU. CONFEDERATE 

02:11:30.999 --> 02:11:34.064
BATTLE FLAGS, MAGA HATS, 
WEAPONS, CAMOUFLAGE ARMY GEAR, 

02:11:34.238 --> 02:11:38.165
JUST LIKE THE INSURRECTIONISTS 
WHO SHOWED UP AND INVADED  THIS 

02:11:38.337 --> 02:11:40.337
CHAMBER ON 

02:11:43.458 --> 02:11:47.134
JANUARY 6th.  THE SIEGE OF THE 
MICHIGAN STATE HOUSE WAS A 

02:11:47.306 --> 02:11:51.531
STATE-LEVEL DRESS REHEARSAL  FOR
THE SIEGE OF THE  U.S. CAPITOL 

02:11:51.698 --> 02:11:54.257
THAT TRUMP INCITED ON JANUARY 
6th . IT WAS A PREVIEW OF THE 

02:11:56.725 --> 02:12:01.233
COMING INSURRECTION. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S RESPONSE TO THESE TWO 

02:12:01.422 --> 02:12:03.422
EVENTS WAS STRIKINGLY 

02:12:05.587 --> 02:12:08.283
SIMILAR. FOLLOWING THE ARMED 
SIEGE IN LANSING , PRESIDENT 

02:12:08.453 --> 02:12:10.453
TRUMP REFUSED TO CONDEMN THE 
ATTACKS ON 

02:12:15.085 --> 02:12:17.840
THE MICHIGAN CAPITOL OR DENOUNCE
THE VIOLENT LAWBREAKERS BUT 

02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:19.788
INSTEAD DID JUST THE OPPOSITE. 
HE UPHELD THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF 

02:12:19.789 --> 02:12:22.187
HIS  VIOLENT FOLLOWERS CAUSE AND
PUT PRESSURE ON THE VICTIM OF 

02:12:24.147 --> 02:12:26.147
THE ATTACK TO LISTEN TO 

02:12:29.728 --> 02:12:31.728
HIS SUPPORTERS.

02:12:33.857 --> 02:12:35.702
THE DAY AFTER THE MOB ATTACK IN 
LANSING, TRUMP TOLD GOVERNOR 

02:12:35.703 --> 02:12:37.069
WHITMER TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
EXTREMIST TWEETING THAT THE 

02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:39.627
GOVERNOR SHOULD JUST, QUOTE, 
GIVE A LITTLE TO THE VIOLENT MEN

02:12:39.796 --> 02:12:41.796
WHO HAD STORMED THE 

02:12:45.039 --> 02:12:47.171
CAPITOL , THREATENING NOT ONLY 
THE STABILITY OF THE MICHIGAN 

02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:50.303
GOVERNMENT, BUT HER OWN LIFE. AS
YOU CAN SEE, HE TWEETED, THE 

02:12:50.479 --> 02:12:52.479
GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN SHOULD GIVE
A LITTLE AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. 

02:12:52.555 --> 02:12:54.555
THESE ARE VERY 

02:12:56.639 --> 02:12:58.639
GOOD PEOPLE, BUT THEY ARE ANGRY.
THEY WANT THEIR LIVES BACK AGAIN

02:12:58.704 --> 02:13:01.823
SAFELY. SEE THEM! TALK TO THEM! 
MAKE 

02:13:05.075 --> 02:13:09.048
A DEAL. THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
HEAVILY ARMED EXTREMIST CARING 

02:13:09.219 --> 02:13:11.219
CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAGS AND 
PUSHING PAST POLICE 

02:13:13.938 --> 02:13:15.728
TO OVERTAKE THE MICHIGAN STATE 
HOUSE CHAMBER ARE VERY GOOD 

02:13:15.729 --> 02:13:19.484
PEOPLE AND JUST NEGOTIATE WITH 
THEM. IT IS CLEAR HE DOESN'T 

02:13:19.659 --> 02:13:21.659
THINK THEY ARE AT FAULT IN ANY 
WAY 

02:13:24.483 --> 02:13:26.470
AT ALL. BUT APRIL 30th WASN'T 
THE ONLY TIME TRUMP SUPPORTERS 

02:13:26.471 --> 02:13:28.471
STORMED THE MICHIGAN 

02:13:30.242 --> 02:13:31.980
CAPITOL . EMBOLDENED BY HIS 
PRAISE AND HIS ENCOURAGEMENT AND

02:13:31.981 --> 02:13:33.981
SUPPORT, THEY ESCALATED AGAIN. 

02:13:37.086 --> 02:13:39.086
GOVERNOR WHITMER REFUSED TO 
CAPITULATE TO THE PRESIDENT'S 

02:13:39.113 --> 02:13:41.113
DEMAND TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM IN
TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 14th 

02:13:41.285 --> 02:13:45.077
TRUMPS MOB AGAIN STORMED THE 
STATE CAPITOL.  THIS TIME, AS 

02:13:45.246 --> 02:13:48.447
YOU CAN SEE HERE, ONE MAN 
BROUGHT A DOLL WITH A NOOSE 

02:13:48.626 --> 02:13:52.879
AROUND THE NECK. FORESHADOWING 
THE APPEARANCE OF THE LARGE 

02:13:53.055 --> 02:13:55.055
GALLOWS ERECTED OUTSIDE OF 

02:13:56.821 --> 02:13:58.821
THIS BUILDING DOWNSTAIRS FROM 
HERE IN JANUARY 6th AS THE 

02:14:03.103 --> 02:14:05.726
CROWD CHANTED, AND I STILL CAN 
HEAR THE WORDS RINGING IN MY 

02:14:05.897 --> 02:14:08.249
EAR, HANG MIKE PENCE! HANG MIKE 
PENCE! HANG MIKE PENCE! OVER THE

02:14:08.419 --> 02:14:10.419
COMING MONTHS EVEN AFTER THE 
CROWD THREATENING 

02:14:14.632 --> 02:14:16.220
GOVERNOR WHITNER STORMED THE 
CAPITOL HE ASSAILED THE 

02:14:16.221 --> 02:14:18.221
REPUBLIC. IN A RALLY IN MICHIGAN
ON SEPTEMBER 10th  

02:14:20.874 --> 02:14:22.767
CROWD WHIPPED UP THE CROWD 
SAYING SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE 

02:14:22.768 --> 02:14:24.475
ABOUT REOPENING HER OWN STATE 
ECONOMY. THE CROWD CHEERED AND 

02:14:24.476 --> 02:14:26.476
THEN ON 

02:14:29.118 --> 02:14:30.963
OCTOBER 8th, THE PRECISE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

02:14:30.964 --> 02:14:32.526
INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE WERE 
REVEALED TO THE WHOLE WORLD. 

02:14:32.527 --> 02:14:34.527
LOOK 

02:14:36.977 --> 02:14:39.827
AT THIS. 13 MEN WERE ARRESTED BY
THE FBI FOR PLOTTING TO STORM 

02:14:39.992 --> 02:14:41.992
THE MICHIGAN STATE CAPITAL

02:14:45.337 --> 02:14:46.882
WAR, KIDNAP GOVERNOR WHITMER, 
TRANSFER HER TO WISCONSIN, AND

THEN TRY AND EXECUTOR. THIS WAS 
AN 

02:14:54.570 --> 02:14:56.570
ASSASSINATION CONSPIRACY

02:15:04.608 --> 02:15:06.577
,  KIDNAPPING AND CONSPIRACY. 
LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE THEY USED. 

02:15:06.578 --> 02:15:08.360
IN THE CHARGING DOCUMENT, THE 
FBI REPORTED ONE OF THE 

02:15:08.361 --> 02:15:10.136
CONSPIRATORS THAT HE NEEDED, 
QUOTE, 200 MEN TO STORM THE 

02:15:10.137 --> 02:15:11.634
CAPITOL BUILDING A TAKE 
POLITICAL HOSTAGES INCLUDING THE

02:15:16.365 --> 02:15:18.365
GOVERNOR. ONE MAN IS PLED GUILTY
TO THE CONSPIRACY AND THE PLOT 

02:15:19.655 --> 02:15:21.655
WAS WELL-ORGANIZED, JUST LIKE 
THE ONE THAT WAS COMING ON 

02:15:25.932 --> 02:15:27.932
JANUARY 6th.

02:15:32.454 --> 02:15:33.866
THE MEN IN MICHIGAN EVEN 
CONSIDERED BUILDING MOLOTOV 

02:15:33.867 --> 02:15:35.268
COCKTAILS TO DISCERN POLICE 
VEHICLES AND ATTEMPTED TO 

02:15:35.269 --> 02:15:36.770
CONSTRUCT THEIR OWN IED'S, 
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

02:15:36.771 --> 02:15:38.914
HERE ON JANUARY 6th. POLICE 
AUTHORITIES ARRESTED EXTREMIST 

02:15:39.091 --> 02:15:43.043
WITH WEAPONS AND MATERIALS TO 
BUILD EXPLOSIVE DEVICES 

02:15:43.210 --> 02:15:44.989
INCLUDING ONE MAN FOUND WITH AN 
ASSAULT RIFLE AND ENOUGH 

02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:46.990
MATERIALS TO MAKE 11 

02:15:50.116 --> 02:15:53.375
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. ON SEPTEMBER 
17th, 2020, ONE OF THE MICHIGAN 

02:15:54.666 --> 02:15:58.327
CONSPIRATORS POSTED, WHEN THE 
TIME COMES, THERE WILL BE NO 

02:15:58.503 --> 02:16:00.503
NEED TO STRIKE FEAR 

02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:04.689
THROUGH PRESENCE. THE FEAR WILL 
BE MANIFESTED 

02:16:08.538 --> 02:16:10.538
THROUGH BULLETS.

02:16:15.339 --> 02:16:17.339
AND WHAT DID DONALD TRUMP DO AS 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

02:16:17.458 --> 02:16:19.216
TO DEFEND ONE OF OUR NATION'S 
GOVERNORS AGAINST THE PLOTTED 

02:16:19.217 --> 02:16:20.306
KIDNAPPING BY VIOLET 
INSURRECTIONIST? THAT HE 

02:16:20.307 --> 02:16:21.708
PUBLICLY CONDEMN VIOLENT 
DOMESTIC EXTREMIST WHO HOPED AND

02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:23.709
PLANNED TO LAUNCH A CIVIL WAR? 
NOT 

02:16:28.087 --> 02:16:31.958
AT ALL. HE FURTHER INFLAMED THEM
BY CONTINUING TO ATTACK THE 

02:16:32.164 --> 02:16:34.164
GOVERNOR WHO WAS THE OBJECT OF 
THEIR HATRED IN THIS 

02:16:37.422 --> 02:16:39.422
KIDNAPPING CONSPIRACY. THE VERY 
NIGHT THIS CONSPIRACY 

02:16:43.275 --> 02:16:46.140
BECAME PUBLIC, AND THAT GOVERNOR
WHITMER LEARNED THAT THERE WERE 

02:16:46.323 --> 02:16:48.323
13 MEN PLANNING TO KIDNAP AND 
LIKELY KILL HER, TRUMP DID NOT 

02:16:48.462 --> 02:16:50.506
CONDEMN THE VIOLENCE. HE DID NOT

02:16:55.368 --> 02:16:58.009
CRITICIZE THE EXTREMISTS AND 
DIDN'T EVEN CHECK ON GOVERNOR 

02:16:58.176 --> 02:16:59.825
WHITMER SAFETY. HE CHOSE TO 
VILIFY GOVERNOR WHITMER AGAIN 

02:16:59.826 --> 02:17:03.857
AND THEN AMAZINGLY TOOK CREDIT 
FOR FOILING THE PLOT AGAINST 

02:17:04.033 --> 02:17:06.033
HER. DEMANDING 

02:17:09.151 --> 02:17:11.151
HER GRATITUDE

02:17:13.422 --> 02:17:15.331
, AND THEN HE QUICKLY, OF 
COURSE, CHANGE THE SUBJECT TO 

02:17:15.332 --> 02:17:17.088
ANTIFA. HE TWEETED, GOVERNOR 
WHITMER HAS DONE A TERRIBLE JOB.

02:17:17.089 --> 02:17:19.089
HE DEMANDED THAT SHE 

02:17:21.015 --> 02:17:22.699
THANKED HIM FOR THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OPERATION THAT HAD 

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:26.216
FOILED THE KIDNAPPING CONSPIRACY
THAT HAD BEEN ENCOURAGED BY HIS 

02:17:26.384 --> 02:17:28.384
RHETORIC. ON 

02:17:30.012 --> 02:17:32.012
OCTOBER 17th, A LITTLE OVER A 
WEEK AFTER THESE PEOPLE WERE 

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:34.077
ARRESTED 

02:17:36.573 --> 02:17:38.573
FOR PREPARING

02:17:41.273 --> 02:17:42.952
TO KIDNAP GRETCHEN WHITMER, 
TRUMP RILED UP A BOISTEROUS 

02:17:42.953 --> 02:17:44.747
CROWD IN MUSKEGON WITH MORE 
SLASHING PERSONAL ATTACKS ON 

02:17:44.748 --> 02:17:49.126
GOVERNOR WHITMER, DRIVING THE 
CROWD TO CHANT, LOCK HER UP! 

02:17:49.305 --> 02:17:51.416
LOCK HER UP! HE HAD NOW SEEN 
THAT SOME OF HIS FOLLOWERS WERE 

02:17:51.591 --> 02:17:53.058
PREPARED TO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL 
VIOLENCE WITH ORCHESTRATED 

02:17:53.059 --> 02:17:55.639
ATTACKS, DEADLY WEAPONS, AND 
WILLING BODIES TO STORM A STATE 

02:17:55.810 --> 02:17:57.810
CAPITOL BUILDING  AND TO ATTACK 

02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:06.836
HIS PERCEIVED LYRICAL ENEMIES. 
AND SO IS THE CROWD CHANTED, 

02:18:07.016 --> 02:18:09.016
LOCK HER UP! HE PIVOTED TO HIS 
NEXT GOAL. HE 

02:18:12.061 --> 02:18:13.915
TOLD THEM, THEY COULDN'T TRUST 
THE GOVERNOR TO ADMINISTER FAIR 

02:18:13.916 --> 02:18:15.916
ELECTIONS IN MICHIGAN. HE USED A
CROWD THAT HE KNEW WOULD READILY

02:18:15.987 --> 02:18:17.987
ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE TO PREPARE 
HIS FOLLOWERS FOR 

02:18:21.996 --> 02:18:24.211
HIS NEXT AND OF COURSE HIS 
PARAMOUNT POLITICAL OBJECTIVE, 

02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:26.390
CLAIMING THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN
AND INCITING 

02:18:28.658 --> 02:18:30.658
INSURRECTIONARY ACTION. AND HE 
DID IT AGAIN ON 

02:18:34.651 --> 02:18:38.285
OCTOBER 27th DURING A 
PRE-ELECTION RALLY SPEECH IN 

02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:40.061
LANSING, MICHIGAN. WHERE THE 
CAPITOL HAVE BEEN STORMED AND 

02:18:40.062 --> 02:18:42.062
TRUMP OPENLY JOKED WITH THE 
CROWD  ABOUT CRITICS SAYING HIS 

02:18:42.170 --> 02:18:46.940
WORDS HAD PROVOKED THE VIOLENT 
PLOT AGAINST GOVERNOR WHITMER. 

02:18:47.111 --> 02:18:49.473
CHECK IT OUT. IT IS TELLING. 

02:18:53.119 --> 02:18:55.376
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE GOT TO GET HER GOING.
I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES ME 

02:18:59.961 --> 02:19:01.771
TOO MUCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! 

02:19:01.772 --> 02:19:06.832
LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK 
HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK 

02:19:11.761 --> 02:19:14.039
HER UP! 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SEE, I DON'T COMMENT ON THAT 

02:19:14.211 --> 02:19:17.878
BECAUSE EVERY TIME IF I MAKE 
JUST A LITTLE NOD, THEY SAY, THE

02:19:18.050 --> 02:19:21.620
PRESIDENT LED THEM ON. I DON'T 
HAVE TO LEAD YOU ON. EVEN A 

02:19:21.794 --> 02:19:23.794
LITTLE NOD, THEY SAY THE 

02:19:27.244 --> 02:19:29.244
PRESIDENT SAID

02:19:32.634 --> 02:19:34.634
-- YOUR GOVERNOR AT THE URGING 
OF HER HUSBAND WHO ABUSED OUR 

02:19:34.721 --> 02:19:36.663
SYSTEM VERY BADLY, THE ONLY MAN 
ALLOWED IN THE STATE OF 

02:19:36.664 --> 02:19:38.583
MICHIGAN, THE ONLY MAN ALLOWED 
TO GO SAILING IS HER HUSBAND. 

02:19:38.584 --> 02:19:43.331
YOUR GOVERNOR, I DON'T THINK SHE
LIKES ME TOO MUCH. HEY! I AM THE

02:19:43.601 --> 02:19:45.601
ONE, IT WAS OUR PEOPLE THAT 
HELPED HER OUT WITH HER 

02:19:49.884 --> 02:19:51.884
PROBLEM AND

02:19:54.013 --> 02:19:56.013
YOU SEE A PROBLEM. PEOPLE ARE 
ENTITLED TO SAY MAYBE IT'S A 

02:19:56.118 --> 02:19:58.118
PROBLEM -- IT WAS OUR PEOPLE, MY
PEOPLE, OUR PEOPLE, THAT HELPED 

02:19:58.377 --> 02:20:01.777
HER OUT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:20:05.967 --> 02:20:07.802
OFFERED THEM A LITTLE WINKING 
INSIDE JOKE ABOUT HIS CONSTANT 

02:20:07.803 --> 02:20:11.704
INCITEMENT OF THE MOB AND HOW 
MUCH CAN ACTUALLY BE 

02:20:11.877 --> 02:20:15.560
COMMUNICATED BY HIM WITH JUST A 
LITTLE NOD. JUST A LITTLE NOD. 

02:20:15.733 --> 02:20:17.733
HE PRESIDED 

02:20:20.031 --> 02:20:21.525
OVER ANOTHER POUNDING, RHYTHMIC 
RENDITION OF HIS TRADEMARK 

02:20:21.526 --> 02:20:23.526
CHANT, LOCK HER UP! LOCK 

02:20:27.430 --> 02:20:29.895
HER UP! THEN REFERRING TO THE 
FBI FOILING OF THE KIDNAPPING 

02:20:30.071 --> 02:20:32.071
CONSPIRACY WHICH WAS DEADLY 
SERIOUS. 

02:20:35.081 --> 02:20:37.392
HE SAID HE HELPED HER OUT WITH A
PROBLEM. MAYBE IT WAS A PROBLEM 

02:20:37.569 --> 02:20:39.887
OR MAYBE IT WASN'T. WE HAVE TO 
SEE. MAYBE A PROBLEM OR MAYBE IT

02:20:40.063 --> 02:20:42.063
WASN'T. THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. HE COULD NOT 

02:20:42.145 --> 02:20:46.275
BRING HIMSELF TO PUBLICLY OPPOSE
A KIDNAPPING AND 

02:20:50.971 --> 02:20:52.130
POTENTIAL ASSASSINATION 
CONSPIRACY PLOT AGAINST A 

02:20:52.131 --> 02:20:55.938
SITTING GOVERNOR OF ONE OF OUR 
50 STATES? TRUMP KNEW EXACTLY 

02:20:56.129 --> 02:20:58.129
WHAT HE 

02:20:59.547 --> 02:21:01.547
WAS DOING IN INCITING THE 
JANUARY 6th 

02:21:05.686 --> 02:21:09.397
MOB. EXACTLY. HE HAD JUST SEEN 
HOW EASILY HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS

02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:11.910
INSPIRE VIOLENCE IN MICHIGAN. HE
SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO HIS 

02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:14.100
SUPPORTERS. HE 

02:21:16.930 --> 02:21:19.813
ENCOURAGED PLANNING,  AND 
CONSPIRACIES TO TAKE OVER 

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.704
CAPITOL BUILDINGS AND THREATEN 
PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO REFUSE TO 

02:21:21.705 --> 02:21:26.193
BOW DOWN TO HIS POLITICAL WILL. 
IS THERE ANY CHANCE DONALD TRUMP

02:21:26.377 --> 02:21:28.377
WAS SURPRISED BY THE RESULTS OF 
HIS 

02:21:31.823 --> 02:21:35.173
OWN INCITEMENT? LET'S DO WHAT 
TOM PAINE TOLD US TO DO AND USE 

02:21:35.363 --> 02:21:38.348
OUR COMMON SENSE. THE SENSE WE 
HAVE IN COMMON. 

02:21:43.229 --> 02:21:46.569
AS CITIZENS. IF WE DON'T DRAW 
THE LINE YOUR, WHAT IS NEXT? 

02:21:46.752 --> 02:21:48.702
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THE 
NIGHTMARE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND 

02:21:48.703 --> 02:21:55.183
IS VIOLENT MOBS IS OVER? IF WE 
LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT AND 

02:21:55.372 --> 02:21:57.372
THEN IT COMES TO YOUR STATE 
CAPITAL OR COMES BACK HERE 

02:21:57.433 --> 02:22:01.083
AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY?
THESE PRIOR ACTS OF INCITEMENT 

02:22:01.271 --> 02:22:03.271
CAST A HARSH LIGHT ON TRUMP'S 

02:22:07.417 --> 02:22:10.298
OBVIOUS INTENT. OBVIOUS INTENT! 
HIS UNAVOIDABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE

02:22:10.498 --> 02:22:13.929
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS INCITEMENT. 
THE UNAVOIDABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE

02:22:14.119 --> 02:22:17.693
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS INCITEMENT 
AND THE CLEAR FORESEEABILITY OF 

02:22:17.895 --> 02:22:23.648
THE VIOLENT HARM THAT HE 
UNLEASHED ON OUR PEOPLE. AND OUR

02:22:23.834 --> 02:22:25.834
REPUBLIC. JANUARY 6th 

02:22:28.919 --> 02:22:30.919
WAS NOT

02:22:33.205 --> 02:22:34.958
SOME UNEXPECTED RADICAL BREAK 
FROM HIS NORMAL, LAW-ABIDING A 

02:22:34.959 --> 02:22:36.959
PEACEFUL DISPOSITION. THIS WAS 
HIS STATE OF MIND. THIS WAS HIS 

02:22:39.957 --> 02:22:42.113
ESSENTIAL M.O. HE KNEW THAT 
EGGED ON BY HIS TWEETS, HIS LIES

02:22:42.312 --> 02:22:44.312
AND PROMISE OF A WILD TIME 

02:22:47.356 --> 02:22:49.356
IN WASHINGTON

02:22:51.765 --> 02:22:53.915
,  TO GUARANTEE HIS GRIP ON 
POWER, IS MOST EXTREME FOLLOWERS

02:22:54.099 --> 02:22:56.178
WOULD SHOW UP BRIGHT AND EARLY, 
READY TO ATTACK, READY TO ENGAGE

02:22:56.372 --> 02:22:58.372
IN VIOLENCE, READY TO FIGHT LIKE
HELL  FOR THEIR 

02:23:01.416 --> 02:23:03.416
HERO. JUST

02:23:05.409 --> 02:23:07.290
LIKE THEY ANSWERED HIS CALL IN 
MICHIGAN. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

02:23:07.291 --> 02:23:09.291
SAID OVER AND OVER HIS 
SUPPORTERS ARE LOYAL AND IN HIS 

02:23:09.376 --> 02:23:11.427
OWN WORDS HIS SUPPORTERS ARE THE
MOST LOYAL WE SEEN IN OUR 

02:23:11.635 --> 02:23:13.357
COUNTRY'S HISTORY. AND HE KNOWS 
HIS MOST HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS 

02:23:13.358 --> 02:23:16.654
ARE WILLING TO DIRECT VIOLENCE 
AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. INDEED TO

02:23:17.637 --> 02:23:19.637
ATTACK 

02:23:22.639 --> 02:23:24.859
AND LAY SIEGE TO WEIGH CAPITOL 
BUILDING AND KNEW THEY WOULD BE 

02:23:25.043 --> 02:23:28.261
READY TO HEED HIS CALL  ON 
JANUARY 6th TWO STOP THE SEAL BY

02:23:31.278 --> 02:23:33.213
USING VIOLENCE TO BLOCK THE 
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER IN 

02:23:33.214 --> 02:23:40.618
THE UNITED STATES. HE KNEW THEY 
WERE COMING. HE BROUGHT THEM 

02:23:40.804 --> 02:23:42.804
HERE AND WELCOME THEM WITH OPEN 
ARMS. WE 

02:23:46.705 --> 02:23:49.907
HEAR YOU, AND LOVE YOU FROM THE 
OVAL OFFICE. MY DEAR COLLEAGUES,

02:23:50.099 --> 02:23:54.837
IS THERE ANY POLITICAL LEADER IN
THIS ROOM WHO BELIEVES IF HE IS 

02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:57.342
EVER LOVED BY THE SENATE TO GET 
BACK IN THE OVAL OFFICE, DONALD 

02:23:57.532 --> 02:23:59.429
TRUMP WOULD STOP INCITING 
VIOLENCE? TO GET HIS WAY? WOULD 

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:03.248
YOU BET THE LIVES OF MORE POLICE
OFFICERS ON THE? WOULD YOU BET 

02:24:03.442 --> 02:24:08.386
THE SAFETY OF YOUR FAMILY ON 
THAT? WITH THE BET THE FUTURE OF

02:24:08.572 --> 02:24:13.372
YOUR DEMOCRACY ON THE? PRESIDENT
TRUMP DECLARED HIS CONDUCT 

02:24:18.338 --> 02:24:21.946
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. SO HE GETS 
BACK INTO OFFICE AND IT HAPPENS 

02:24:22.126 --> 02:24:24.126
AGAIN, WE WILL HAVE NO ONE TO 
BLAME 

02:24:27.626 --> 02:24:29.626
BUT OURSELVES.

02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:43.880
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL RETURN TO TELL YOU 
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TOTAL 

02:24:43.947 --> 02:24:45.947
LACK OF REMORSE AFTER 

02:24:48.999 --> 02:24:50.999
THE INSURRECTION.

02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:59.910
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

02:25:02.918 --> 02:25:04.918
GOOD AFTERNOON. MY COLLEAGUES 
WALKED YOU THROUGH PRESIDENT 

02:25:04.941 --> 02:25:06.941
TRUMP'S ACTIONS LEADING UP TO 
JANUARY 6th AND THEN 

02:25:10.781 --> 02:25:13.918
THE HORRIFIC EVENTS ON JANUARY 
6th. AND WE SAW BOTH DURING THE 

02:25:14.099 --> 02:25:16.355
ATTACK AS WELL AS AN DAYS AFTER 
THE ATTACK THAT THIS WAS A 

02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:20.227
PRESIDENT WHO SHOWED NO REMORSE 
AND TOOK NO ACCOUNTABILITY. IN 

02:25:20.414 --> 02:25:22.414
FACT, QUITE THE 

02:25:25.045 --> 02:25:26.449
OPPOSITE. AS REPRESENTATIVE 
RASKIN SHOWED YOU PRESIDENT 

02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:28.450
TRUMP  

02:25:29.686 --> 02:25:31.382
CLAIMED AS THEY WERE QUOTE 
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. THE 

02:25:31.383 --> 02:25:35.527
ASSERTION THAT EVERYONE THOUGHT 
DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIONS WERE 

02:25:35.719 --> 02:25:37.719
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE INCLUDING 
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM IS 

02:25:40.377 --> 02:25:42.899
OF COURSE, UNTRUE. IT IS ALSO 
DANGEROUS. AND THAT 

02:25:47.775 --> 02:25:51.301
IS WHY, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND 
U.S. SENATORS, FORMER AND 

02:25:51.494 --> 02:25:53.494
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS, STATE AND 

02:25:56.551 --> 02:25:57.850
LOCAL OFFICIALS, ALL 
UNEQUIVOCALLY CONFIRM WHAT WE 

02:25:57.851 --> 02:26:01.887
WITNESSED WITH OUR OWN EYES, 
THAT DONALD TRUMP'S CONDUCT WAS 

02:26:02.078 --> 02:26:04.470
WRONG, IT WAS DESTRUCTIVE, 
DISHONORABLE AND UN-AMERICAN. 

02:26:08.641 --> 02:26:10.414
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LACK OF 
REMORSE AND REFUSAL TO TAKE 

02:26:10.415 --> 02:26:14.515
ACCOUNTABILITY DURING THE ATTACK
SHOWS HIS STATE OF MIND. IT 

02:26:14.704 --> 02:26:16.704
SHOWS THAT HE INTENDED THE 
EVENTS OF 

02:26:19.053 --> 02:26:22.185
JANUARY 6th TWO HAPPEN. AND WHEN
IT DID, HE DELIGHTED IN IT. 

02:26:22.367 --> 02:26:25.938
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LACK OF 
REMORSE AND REFUSAL TO TAKE 

02:26:26.125 --> 02:26:28.125
ACCOUNTABILITY AFTER 

02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:35.541
THE ATTACK POSES ITS OWN UNIQUE 
AND CONTINUING DANGER. IT SENDS 

02:26:35.729 --> 02:26:37.729
THE MESSAGE THAT IT 

02:26:39.719 --> 02:26:41.292
IS ACCEPTABLE TO INCITE A 
VIOLENT INSURRECTION TO 

02:26:41.293 --> 02:26:45.697
OVERTHROW THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
AND THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

02:26:45.884 --> 02:26:48.986
UNITED STATES CAN DO THAT AND 
GET AWAY WITH IT. THAT IS WHY WE

02:26:49.174 --> 02:26:52.987
HAVE TO HOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ACCOUNTABLE. TO SEND A MESSAGE 

02:26:53.177 --> 02:26:57.248
THAT IS NEVER PATRIOTIC TO 
INCITE A VIOLENT ATTACK AGAINST 

02:26:57.434 --> 02:27:00.867
OUR NATION'S CAPITOL.  AND THAT 
FUTURE PRESIDENT'S WILL KNOW 

02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:05.304
THAT THEY CANNOT FOLLOW IN 
DONALD TRUMP'S FOOTSTEPS AND GET

02:27:05.491 --> 02:27:09.338
AWAY WITH IT. SO LET'S START 
WITH THE DAY OF 

02:27:12.629 --> 02:27:14.629
THE ATTACK. ON INSURRECTION DAY,
JANUARY 6, 

02:27:17.829 --> 02:27:19.829
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT ONCE 
CONDEMN THE ATTACK. NOT 

02:27:22.473 --> 02:27:25.941
EVEN ONCE. EVEN WHEN HE FINALLY 
ASKED THE VIOLENT EXTREMISTS TO 

02:27:26.691 --> 02:27:31.597
GO HOME, WHICH WAS THREE HOURS 
AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN, HE SENDS

02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:37.327
THIS VIDEO, AND HE ENDS IT WITH,
YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL. WE 

02:27:40.889 --> 02:27:42.889
LOVE YOU. THAT WAS HIS MESSAGE 
TO 

02:27:46.373 --> 02:27:48.373
PEOPLE WHO PERPETRATED THIS 
VIOLENT, GRUESOME ATTACK. WE 

02:27:48.771 --> 02:27:53.549
LOVE YOU. AND THEN TWO OUR SEAT 
LATER HE TWEETS REMEMBER THIS 

02:27:55.936 --> 02:27:57.936
DAY FOREVER. THIS IS NOT A MAN 
WHO 

02:28:01.137 --> 02:28:05.454
SHOWS REMORSE. BUT IT'S WORSE 
THAN THAT. AFTER THAT TWEET, IT 

02:28:05.645 --> 02:28:10.187
TOOK HIM ANOTHER FULL DAY TO 
EVEN CONDEMN THE ATTACK ITSELF. 

02:28:10.367 --> 02:28:12.367
THE VERY 

02:28:15.434 --> 02:28:17.434
NEXT DAY,

02:28:19.421 --> 02:28:21.421
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS EERILY 
SILENT AND THEN AT 7:01 P.M., HE

02:28:21.481 --> 02:28:23.481
RELEASES A PRERECORDED VIDEO AND
THERE PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE 

02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:30.022
FIRST TIME NEARLY 30 HOURS AFTER
THE ATTACK BEGAN, ACKNOWLEDGES 

02:28:30.208 --> 02:28:32.521
AND CONDEMNS THE VIOLENCE AND 
MAYHEM THAT OCCURRED. HE SAID 

02:28:37.371 --> 02:28:39.383
THE DEMONSTRATORS DEFILED THE 
SEAT OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. HE 

02:28:39.567 --> 02:28:41.230
SAID THAT THESE DEMONSTRATORS 
DIDN'T REPRESENT THIS COUNTRY 

02:28:41.231 --> 02:28:43.231
AND THEY BROKE THE LAW, THEY 

02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:47.738
WOULD PAY. BUT EVEN IN THAT 
VIDEO, HE SAYS MORE LIES. 

02:28:51.624 --> 02:28:53.624
HE SAYS IN THE VERY SAME VIDEO 
THAT HE IMMEDIATELY DEPLOYED 

02:28:53.879 --> 02:28:55.944
NATIONAL GUARD. THAT AGAIN IS 

02:28:59.079 --> 02:29:03.704
NOT TRUE. THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS
NOT DEPLOYED UNTIL OVER TWO 

02:29:03.886 --> 02:29:05.967
HOURS AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN AT 
AROUND 

02:29:10.332 --> 02:29:12.201
3:00 P.M. BECAUSE OF THIS LATE 
DEPLOYMENT, THE NATIONAL GUARD 

02:29:12.202 --> 02:29:16.971
DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL AFTER 5:00 
P.M. AND WHEN THE GUARD WAS 

02:29:17.159 --> 02:29:21.111
DEPLOYED, THE PENTAGON HAD 
RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT SHOWED

02:29:21.297 --> 02:29:25.663
THE LIST OF PEOPLE, AND YOU SAW 
THAT LIST OF FOLKS THAT WERE 

02:29:25.854 --> 02:29:29.866
CONSULTED BEFORE DEPLOYING THE 
NATIONAL GUARD. SEVERAL PEOPLE 

02:29:30.052 --> 02:29:32.271
WERE ON THE LIST INCLUDING THE 
VICE PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:29:32.454 --> 02:29:36.526
WAS NOT ON THAT LIST. AND YOU 
KNOW, AS 

02:29:40.283 --> 02:29:41.968
A VETERAN, I FIND IT DEEPLY 
DISHONORABLE THAT OUR 

02:29:41.969 --> 02:29:44.462
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF DID NOT 
PROTECT US AND THEN LATER TRIES 

02:29:46.468 --> 02:29:51.951
TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SOMETHING HE 
FAILED TO DO. SHAMEFUL. ALSO ON 

02:29:54.350 --> 02:29:57.702
THAT VIDEO, YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT
IT DID NOT SAY. ABSENT FROM THAT

02:30:00.957 --> 02:30:02.957
ENTIRE VIDEO WAS ANY ACTUAL 
ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR

02:30:05.599 --> 02:30:07.775
HIS ACTIONS. ABSENT FROM THAT 
VIDEO WAS A CALL TO HIS MOST 

02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:11.882
FERVENT SUPPORTERS TO NEVER DO 
THIS AGAIN. AND HERE WAS HIS 

02:30:12.068 --> 02:30:14.068
FINAL MESSAGE 

02:30:16.425 --> 02:30:18.621
IN THAT SO-CALLED CONDEMNATION 
OF ATTACK VIDEO. HERE IS WHAT HE

02:30:20.923 --> 02:30:22.590
ACTUALLY SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND TO ALL OF MY WONDERFUL 

02:30:22.591 --> 02:30:24.463
SUPPORTERS, I KNOW YOU ARE 
DISAPPOINTED. BUT I ALSO WANT 

02:30:24.464 --> 02:30:28.183
YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR INCREDIBLE 
JOURNEY IS ONLY 

02:30:32.965 --> 02:30:34.950
JUST BEGINNING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY 

02:30:34.951 --> 02:30:37.469
FAILED TO SHOW REMORSE OR TAKE 
ACCOUNTABILITY, HE MADE CLEAR HE

02:30:37.653 --> 02:30:39.653
IS 

02:30:42.162 --> 02:30:44.162
JUST BEGINNING. FOUR DAYS HE DID
NOT ADDRESS THE NATION AFTER 

02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:47.365
THIS ATTACK. WE NEEDED OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO LEAD, TO 

02:30:47.551 --> 02:30:52.763
UNITE A GRIEVING COUNTRY. TO 
COMFORT US. BUT WHAT DID 

02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:55.376
PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? 

02:30:59.314 --> 02:31:01.334
NOTHING. SILENCE. WE ARE ALL 
AWARE THAT A VIOLENT MOB 

02:31:01.525 --> 02:31:08.231
MURDERED A POLICE OFFICER. IT 
TOOK PRESIDENT TRUMP THREE DAYS 

02:31:08.421 --> 02:31:13.107
BEFORE HE LOWERED THE FLAG OF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

02:31:15.909 --> 02:31:17.909
THREE DAYS. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP,
WHO HAS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AT 

02:31:18.017 --> 02:31:20.017
THE TIME, DID 

02:31:23.296 --> 02:31:25.965
NOT ATTEND AND PAY RESPECTS TO 
THE OFFICER WHO LAY IN STATE IN 

02:31:26.149 --> 02:31:31.441
THE VERY BUILDING THAT HE DIED 
DEFENDING. 

02:31:31.442 --> 02:31:38.339
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SOME PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A MISTAKE. 

02:31:38.541 --> 02:31:43.633
AND HE GETS A BALL AGAIN. AND WE
KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T MAKE

02:31:46.582 --> 02:31:48.992
A MISTAKE. YOU SEE WHEN YOU OR I
MAKE A MISTAKE AND SOMETHING 

02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:51.180
VERY BAD HAPPENS, WE WOULD SHOW 

02:31:55.157 --> 02:31:56.454
REMORSE. WE WOULD SHOW 
RESPONSIBILITY. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:31:56.455 --> 02:32:01.859
DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT. WHY NOT? 
BECAUSE HE INTENDED WHAT 

02:32:02.046 --> 02:32:06.525
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6th. AND HOW
DO WE KNOW THAT? HE 

02:32:11.423 --> 02:32:13.423
TOLD US.

02:32:21.441 --> 02:32:23.685
ON JANUARY 12th, AS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS BOARDING AIR FORCE ONE

02:32:23.866 --> 02:32:26.469
TO GO TO TEXAS, AND YOU SAW THE 
VIDEO BEFORE AND I WILL SHOW IT 

02:32:26.652 --> 02:32:28.652
AGAIN, HE WAS ASKED BY A 
REPORTER, QUOTE, WHAT IS YOUR 

02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:31.036
ROLE IN WHAT HAPPENED AT THE 
CAPITOL?  WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL 

02:32:31.222 --> 02:32:32.489
RESPONSIBILITY? AND THIS WAS HIS
RESPONSE. 

02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:34.814
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY SPEECH AND MY WORDS AND MY
FINAL PARAGRAPH IN MY FINAL 

02:32:35.009 --> 02:32:37.581
SENTENCE AND EVERYBODY TO THE T 
THOUGHT IT WAS TOTALLY 

02:32:38.474 --> 02:32:40.474
APPROPRIATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ON 

02:32:43.766 --> 02:32:46.590
JANUARY 12, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 
SEEN THE VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE 

02:32:46.775 --> 02:32:50.795
CAPITOL AND KNEW THE PEOPLE THAT
DIED. HIS MESSAGE  TO ALL OF US 

02:32:50.981 --> 02:32:55.350
WAS THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS TOTALLY
APPROPRIATE. I AM A FORMER 

02:32:55.636 --> 02:32:58.673
PROSECUTOR, AND WE ARE TRAINED 
TO RECOGNIZE LACK OF REMORSE. IT

02:32:58.860 --> 02:33:02.153
DOESN'T TAKE A PROSECUTOR TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:33:02.336 --> 02:33:08.844
WAS NOT SHOWING REMORSE. HE WAS 
SHOWING DEFIANCE. HE WAS TELLING

02:33:09.031 --> 02:33:12.483
US THAT HE WOULD DO THIS AGAIN, 
THAT HE COULD DO 

02:33:17.231 --> 02:33:19.442
THIS AGAIN, THAT HE AND FUTURE 
PRESIDENT'S CAN RUN FOR A 

02:33:19.631 --> 02:33:21.631
NATIONAL 

02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:26.122
ELECTION, LOSE AN COLLECTION, 
AND FLAME SUPPORTERS FOR MONTHS 

02:33:26.312 --> 02:33:28.811
AND THEN INCITE AN INSURRECTION 
AND THAT WOULD BE TOTALLY 

02:33:29.023 --> 02:33:31.023
APPROPRIATE. 

02:33:32.328 --> 02:33:34.328
ONE WEEK AFTER THE ATTACK ON 
JANUARY 13th, 

02:33:36.975 --> 02:33:38.593
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN RESPONSE TO 
CONTINUING BIPARTISAN CRITICISM,

02:33:38.594 --> 02:33:44.066
RELEASES ANOTHER VIDEO. HERE IS 
PART OF WHAT HE SAID. I WILL BE 

02:33:45.124 --> 02:33:47.124
VERY CLEAR, 

02:33:48.808 --> 02:33:50.808
CLEAR THAT I UNEQUIVOCALLY 
CONDEMNED I THE VIOLENCE 

02:33:50.810 --> 02:33:51.394
UNEQUIVOCALLYTHAT  WE CONDEMNED 
SAW THE LAST VIOLENCE WEEK. WE 

02:33:51.395 --> 02:33:52.848
THERE SAW IS LAST NO WEEK, PLACE
THE IN VIOLENCE AND VANDALISM 

02:33:52.849 --> 02:33:55.309
OUR HAVE COUNTRYNO PLACE IN OUR 
COUNTRY AND NO PLACE IN 

02:33:58.719 --> 02:34:00.731
OUR MOVEMENT.. PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
OF COURSE, HAD TO MAKE THAT 

02:34:00.935 --> 02:34:02.563
STATEMENT. HE NEEDED TO 
UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN. HE ALSO 

02:34:02.564 --> 02:34:06.855
NEEDED TO MEAN THOSE WORDS. YOU 
SAW DONALD TRUMP TWEET IN THESE 

02:34:06.995 --> 02:34:12.749
ATTACKS. THERE ARE SOMETIMES 100
TWEETS IN A DAY.

02:34:20.107 --> 02:34:22.356
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO 

02:34:22.571 --> 02:34:25.237
CONVEY A MESSAGE. FORCEFULLY, 
LOUDLY AND REPEATEDLY HE DOES 

02:34:25.439 --> 02:34:30.905
THAT. THIS VIDEO WAS NOT THAT. 
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE IN THIS 

02:34:31.046 --> 02:34:36.233
VIDEO, HE, AGAIN DOES NOT SHOW 
REMORSE AND DOES NOT TAKE 

02:34:36.374 --> 02:34:38.374
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:34:41.393 --> 02:34:45.498
THERE OF COURSE WAS NO VOTE OR 
INSURRECTION. HE DOES NOT SAY IN

02:34:45.716 --> 02:34:48.713
THE VIDEO, FOR EXAMPLE, 
EVERYTHING I SAID IN THE MONTHS 

02:34:48.874 --> 02:34:54.081
PRIOR. HE DOES NOT SAY THE ONE 
SENTENCE THAT MATTERS. HE DOES 

02:34:54.281 --> 02:34:58.119
NOT SAY THE ONE SENTENCE WHO 
WOULD STOP THE POLITICAL 

02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:00.964
VIOLENCE THAT THE ELECTION WAS 
NOT STOLEN.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
HE STILL HAS NOT SAID

02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:13.404
THAT SENTENCE. THAT IS WHY THE 
NATIONAL GUARD IN FULL PARTY 

02:35:13.622 --> 02:35:18.412
ARMOR STILL PATROL OUTSIDE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPORTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 

02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:24.031
ALSO CONFIRM THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP BELIEVED HE WAS FORCED TO 

02:35:24.244 --> 02:35:27.729
ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEW 
ADMINISTRATION. 

02:35:27.730 --> 02:35:31.641
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE KNOW HE DID NOT STAND 
BECAUSE THOSE AROUND HIM 

02:35:32.396 --> 02:35:34.396
CONFIRMED IT

02:35:39.433 --> 02:35:41.267
. BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SOURCES 
CONFIRM THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:35:41.268 --> 02:35:44.759
REFUSED TO DIRECTLY ACKNOWLEDGE 
HIS ELECTION LOSS TO JOE BIDEN. 

02:35:44.973 --> 02:35:46.973
HE REFUSED TO EVEN ATTEND THE 
PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER, 

02:35:47.045 --> 02:35:52.110
THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN 
HISTORY. PRESIDENT TRUMP EVEN, 

02:35:52.249 --> 02:35:57.118
REPORTEDLY, WAS WATCHING THE 
IMPEACHMENT AND FOCUSED HIS IRE 

02:35:57.288 --> 02:36:01.053
ON REPUBLICANS WHO FOLK VOTED 
FOR HIS IMPEACHMENT.

02:36:04.725 --> 02:36:06.725
PREDATES WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT HE COULD DO TO EXACT 

02:36:06.823 --> 02:36:11.119
REVENGE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 
MADE CLEAR THAT IF HE IS NOT 

02:36:11.874 --> 02:36:16.056
HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT HE WILL 
NOT BE ACCOUNTABLE AND HE WILL 

02:36:16.257 --> 02:36:20.227
NOT STOP. NOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WOULD HAVE HIS BASE IN THE WORLD

02:36:21.584 --> 02:36:25.122
BELIEVE HIS CONDUCT WAS TOTALLY 
APPROPRIATE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

02:36:25.338 --> 02:36:27.338
IMPEACH THAT FALSEHOOD

02:36:29.432 --> 02:36:31.837
. TO MAKE CLEAR TO HIS 
SUPPORTERS AND TO EVERYONE 

02:36:32.017 --> 02:36:36.408
WATCHING THAT WHAT DONALD TRUMP 
DID WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IN FACT,

02:36:36.623 --> 02:36:42.030
QUITE THE OPPOSITE. PEOPLE IN 
HIS OWN PARTY INCLUDING STATE 

02:36:42.235 --> 02:36:45.125
OFFICIALS AND FORMER OFFICIALS 
AND CURRENT OFFICIALS AND 

02:36:45.328 --> 02:36:47.328
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE

02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:52.575
UNAMBIGUOUSLY AND IN 
PASSIONATELY SAID THAT WHAT 

02:36:52.576 --> 02:36:56.355
DONALD TRUMP DID WAS QUOTE, 
DISGRACEFUL, SHAMEFUL

02:37:00.155 --> 02:37:02.757
. THEY CALLED HIS BEHAVIOR 
EXISTENTIAL AND WRONG.

02:37:06.959 --> 02:37:09.248
THEY SAID HIS ACTIONS GAVE RISE 
TO ONE OF THE DARKEST CHAPTERS 

02:37:09.463 --> 02:37:14.826
IN UNITED STATES HISTORY. LET'S 
HEAR WITH SOME OF THESE 

02:37:15.043 --> 02:37:20.541
OFFICIALS HAD TO SAY. HERE IS 
GOVERNOR SPENCER COX, CHARLIE 

02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:23.293
BAKER, MIKE DeWINE, LARRY HOGAN 
AND PHIL SCOTT.

02:37:27.551 --> 02:37:29.551
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE AND YES, THAT 

02:37:29.682 --> 02:37:34.143
INCLUDES THE PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REMEMBER, IT WAS A 

02:37:34.343 --> 02:37:35.979
CULMINATION OF MONTHS OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REPEATING OVER 

02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:38.893
AND OVER AGAIN THAT THE AMERICAN
ELECTORAL SYSTEM IS A FRAUD. 

02:37:39.093 --> 02:37:41.093
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER HE

02:37:44.609 --> 02:37:47.236
STOKES THE FLAMES FOR WEEKS 
LEADING UP TO THE EVENTS OF 

02:37:47.376 --> 02:37:49.376
YESTERDAY

02:37:51.976 --> 02:37:54.056
, HE REFUSED TO ADEQUATELY 
PREPARE THE U.S. CAPITOL FOR THE

02:37:54.258 --> 02:37:57.757
POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE AND LEFT
IT NEARLY DEFENSELESS. HIS 

02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:00.016
REMARKS DURING AND AFTER THE 
TRAVESTY OF THE ATTACK ON THE 

02:38:00.217 --> 02:38:03.279
CAPITAL WERE DISGRACEFUL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CONTINUED 

02:38:03.496 --> 02:38:05.541
REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE ELECTION 
RESULTS WITHOUT PRODUCING 

02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:08.300
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE

02:38:10.643 --> 02:38:13.247
HAVE STARTED A FIRE THAT HAS 
THREATENED TO BURN DOWN OUR 

02:38:13.379 --> 02:38:16.712
DEMOCRACY. THIS INCENDIARY 
SPEECH, YESTERDAY, WHEN HE GAVE

02:38:19.966 --> 02:38:24.876
IT PRECEDING THE MARCH THAT HE 
GAVE THE PROTESTERS. IT SERVED 

02:38:25.629 --> 02:38:27.629
ONLY TO FAN THOSE FLAMES

02:38:33.596 --> 02:38:35.039
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I PROUDLY STOOD BY MY 

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.510
FATHER'S CITED THE AGE OF 12 ON 
THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE CHAMBER, 

02:38:37.710 --> 02:38:41.197
AS WE BOTH TOOK THE OATH OF 
OFFICE. AN OATH TO SUPPORT AND 

02:38:41.331 --> 02:38:43.331
DEFEND

02:38:49.115 --> 02:38:53.643
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT 

02:38:53.845 --> 02:38:55.845
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ABANDONED 
THIS SACRED OATH.

02:39:00.253 --> 02:39:05.471
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SEE IN OUR CAPITAL, A SYMBOL 
OF DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD 

02:39:05.679 --> 02:39:08.581
STORMED BY AN ANGRY MOB WAS 
HEARTBREAKING. LET ME BE CLEAR, 

02:39:08.796 --> 02:39:13.476
THESE ACTIONS WERE NOT PATRIOTIC
. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT PATRIOTS.

02:39:15.803 --> 02:39:21.182
THE FACT THAT THESE FLAMES OF 
HATE AND INSURRECTION WERE LIT I

02:39:21.389 --> 02:39:23.447
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES WILL BE REMEMBERED AS ONE

02:39:23.663 --> 02:39:27.548
OF THE DARKEST CHAPTERS IN OUR 
NATION 'S'S HISTORY. 

02:39:27.549 --> 02:39:33.308
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE OF THE DARKEST CHAPTERS 
IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. FORMER 

02:39:33.509 --> 02:39:36.530
MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION, LONG-STANDING 

02:39:36.678 --> 02:39:40.927
REPUBLICANS, ALSO MADE CLEAR 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP INCITED 

02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:44.914
THIS INSURRECTION AND IT WENT 
AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY

02:39:48.381 --> 02:39:51.695
. THE PRESENT'S FORMER SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE, JAMES MATTIS 

02:39:52.118 --> 02:39:54.118
DECLARED THAT TODAY'S WAS AN 
ASSAULT ON OUR CAPITAL WASN'T 

02:39:54.203 --> 02:39:59.492
EFFORT TO SUBJUGATE AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY BY MOB RULE WAS FORMED

02:39:59.624 --> 02:40:01.624
BY

02:40:10.896 --> 02:40:12.791
PRESIDENT TRUMP. FORMER WHITE 
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN 

02:40:12.792 --> 02:40:15.479
KELLY, SPOKE ON THIS AS WELL. I 
WOULD LIKE TO PLAY AN AUDIO CLIP

02:40:15.693 --> 02:40:17.693
OF WHAT HE SAID. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT HAPPENED ON CAPITOL HILL

02:40:17.794 --> 02:40:19.850
YESTERDAY WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF
HIS POISONING THE MINDS OF 

02:40:20.065 --> 02:40:22.932
PEOPLE WITH THE LIES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU CANNOT HEAR THAT, WHAT

02:40:23.133 --> 02:40:25.190
JOHN KELLY SAID ABOUT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS THAT WHAT HAPPENED ON 

02:40:25.407 --> 02:40:29.354
CAPITOL HILL WAS A DIRECT RESULT
OF HIM POISONING THE MINDS OF 

02:40:29.555 --> 02:40:31.555
PEOPLE WITH LIES AND FRAUD

02:40:34.082 --> 02:40:35.540
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE 

02:40:35.541 --> 02:40:38.834
HOUSE, JOHN WEINER DECLARED THAT
QUOTE, THE INVASION OF OUR 

02:40:39.033 --> 02:40:44.224
CAPITAL BY A MOB INCITED BY LIES
FROM SOMEONE ENTRUSTED WITH 

02:40:44.441 --> 02:40:46.441
POWER IS A DISGRACE

02:40:49.347 --> 02:40:52.441
TO BUILD OUR REPUBLIC. THIS WAS 
ECHOED BY A FORMER TRUMP 

02:40:52.656 --> 02:40:55.841
OFFICIAL AFTER FORMER TRUMP 
OFFICIAL. HERE IS

02:41:00.646 --> 02:41:02.646
JOHN BOLTON AND H. R. McMASTER 
AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE 

02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:04.751
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND 
FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF MICK 

02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:07.993
MULVANEY, HERE IS WHAT THEY SAID

02:41:13.089 --> 02:41:14.939
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET ME JUST ASK YOU, DO YOU 

02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:16.591
THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BLOOD 
ON HIS HANDS? 

02:41:16.592 --> 02:41:21.875
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK HE DOES. LOOK, I 
AGREE WITH BILL BARR. I THINK HE

02:41:22.015 --> 02:41:24.046
DID INCITE THE MOB WITH THE 
CLEAR INTENTION OF HAVING THEM 

02:41:24.264 --> 02:41:26.264
DISRUPT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
CERTIFICATION AND DELAY IT TO 

02:41:26.355 --> 02:41:29.289
GIVE HIM MORE TIME. I DON'T 
THINK THERE IS ANY QUESTION 

02:41:30.048 --> 02:41:33.878
ABOUT IT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR 

02:41:34.094 --> 02:41:37.582
THE ASSAULT ON THE CAPITAL BUT 
FOREMOST AMONG THEM WAS THE 

02:41:37.783 --> 02:41:40.474
PRESIDENT'S SUSTAINED THIS 
INFORMATION. WE HAVE SEEN A 

02:41:40.673 --> 02:41:44.590
PRESIDENT STOKING FEARS AMIDST A
CRISIS. 

02:41:44.591 --> 02:41:47.054
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO
SAY WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAPITAL

02:41:47.252 --> 02:41:49.252
WAS UNACCEPTABLE, UN-AMERICAN 
AND UNDEMOCRATIC

02:41:52.606 --> 02:41:53.830
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES 

02:41:53.831 --> 02:41:55.831
THAT WHAT HAPPENED ON WEDNESDAY 
IS DIFFERENT

02:42:01.268 --> 02:42:03.551
. YOU CAN GO DOWN THE LONG 
LITANY OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE 

02:42:03.744 --> 02:42:05.744
COMPLAIN ABOUT WITH DONALD 
TRUMP. I COULD DEFEND ALMOST ANY

02:42:05.855 --> 02:42:07.892
OF THEM INCLUDING POLICY 
DIFFERENCES. MANY WERE STYLISTIC

02:42:08.031 --> 02:42:10.031
DIFFERENCES

02:42:11.693 --> 02:42:13.693
, BUT WEDNESDAY WAS DIFFERENT. 
WEDNESDAY WAS EXISTENTIAL AND IT

02:42:13.734 --> 02:42:16.463
STRUCK TO THE VERY HEART OF WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN AND 

02:42:16.665 --> 02:42:21.572
IT WAS WRONG. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MICK MULVANEY, THE 

02:42:21.770 --> 02:42:24.545
PRESIDENT'S FORMER CHIEF OF 
STAFF IS SAYING WHAT WE ALL FELT

02:42:25.492 --> 02:42:30.154
. THAT JANUARY 6 WAS DIFFERENT. 
IT WAS EXISTENTIAL. IT WAS WRONG

02:42:30.852 --> 02:42:32.852
. IT WAS UN-AMERICAN

02:42:35.991 --> 02:42:37.991
. THIS SENTIMENT WAS ECHOED

02:42:41.185 --> 02:42:43.185
NOT JUST FROM PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE
ADMINISTRATION, BUT FROM PEOPLE 

02:42:43.255 --> 02:42:47.783
INSIDE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
PERHAPS MOST TELLING WAS THE 

02:42:47.982 --> 02:42:52.664
FLOOD OF RESIGNATIONS FROM 
PEOPLE INSIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

02:42:52.799 --> 02:42:57.183
ADMINISTRATION WHO HAD ACCESS TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP. HIS OWN 

02:42:57.366 --> 02:43:01.987
OFFICIALS ALSO BETRAYED BY HIS 
CONDUCT THAT NUMEROUS OFFICIALS 

02:43:02.189 --> 02:43:07.802
RESIGNED IN PROTEST DAYS BEFORE 
THE END PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TERM. 

02:43:08.016 --> 02:43:12.745
16 OFFICIALS RESIGNED IN 
PROTEST. 16. THEY ALL TOOK THIS 

02:43:13.501 --> 02:43:18.912
DRAMATIC ACTION OF RESIGNING 
BECAUSE THEY SAW THE CLEAR LINK 

02:43:19.315 --> 02:43:22.951
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
CONDUCT AND THE VIOLENT 

02:43:23.092 --> 02:43:28.375
INSURRECTION. HERE IS SOME OF 
WHAT THEY SAID. SECRETARY 

02:43:28.552 --> 02:43:32.863
DIVORCE WHO WAS IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION THE ENTIRE TERM.

02:43:39.563 --> 02:43:41.563
SHE GAVE HER RESIGNATION LETTER 
AND TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP, THERE 

02:43:41.619 --> 02:43:44.165
IS NO MISTAKING THE IMPACT YOUR 
RHETORIC HAD ON THIS. IT IS AN 

02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:48.933
INFLECTION POINT FOR ME. AND 
SECRETARY CHAO WHO WAS IN THE 

02:43:49.149 --> 02:43:52.056
ADMINISTRATION THE ENTIRE TERM 
EXPLAINED, YESTERDAY AT, OUR 

02:43:52.257 --> 02:43:57.034
COUNTRY EXPERIENCED A TRAUMATIC 
AND ENTIRELY AVOIDABLE EVENT AS 

02:43:57.237 --> 02:44:00.249
SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT 
STORMED THE CAPITAL WITH A RALLY

02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:02.560
THAT HE ADDRESSED

02:44:04.889 --> 02:44:07.788
. AS IS THE CASE WITH YOU, IT 
HAS DEEPLY TROUBLED ME IN A WAY 

02:44:07.992 --> 02:44:12.723
I SIMPLY CANNOT SET ASIDE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND HE SAID IT WAS HIS 

02:44:13.354 --> 02:44:18.190
BREAKING POINT AND HE WAS HOPING
IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL

02:44:22.021 --> 02:44:23.062
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THESE REBUKES AND 

02:44:23.063 --> 02:44:25.063
RESIGNATIONS FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S OWN ADMINISTRATION MAKE 

02:44:25.074 --> 02:44:28.565
CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
CONDUCT WAS ANYTHING BUT TOTALLY

02:44:28.702 --> 02:44:34.189
APPROPRIATE. THEY ALSO REMIND US
THAT THIS CAN AND MUST BE A 

02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:36.950
WAKE-UP CALL

02:44:38.715 --> 02:44:42.414
. AS REPRESENTATIVE FRED UPTON 
ELOQUENTLY PUT IT, PRESIDENT 

02:44:42.617 --> 02:44:45.681
TRUMP EXPRESSED NO REGRETS FOR 
LAST WEEK'S VIOLENT INDISCRETION

02:44:45.882 --> 02:44:52.249
AT THE U.S. CAPITOL. THIS SENDS 
EXACTLY THE WRONG SIGNAL TO 

02:44:52.467 --> 02:44:55.106
THOSE OF US WHO SUPPORT THE VERY
CORE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC 

02:44:55.244 --> 02:44:58.289
PRINCIPLES AND TOOK A SOLEMN 
OATH TO THE CONSTITUTION. IT IS 

02:44:58.492 --> 02:45:00.853
TIME TO SAY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

02:45:05.485 --> 02:45:07.547
NOW, NO ONE IS SAYING HERE THE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CANNOT CONTEST 

02:45:08.308 --> 02:45:10.308
THE ELECTION. OF COURSE HE CAN

02:45:14.937 --> 02:45:17.250
. BUT, WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID,
AS IS FORMER CHIEF FIXED STAFF 

02:45:17.453 --> 02:45:19.669
EXPLAINED, WAS DIFFERENT. IT WAS
DISHONORABLE AND IT WAS 

02:45:19.810 --> 02:45:22.072
UN-AMERICAN AND IT RESULTED IN 
FATALITIES.

02:45:25.529 --> 02:45:27.529
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPENT MONTHS 
INFLAMING HIS SUPPORTERS. HE 

02:45:27.673 --> 02:45:33.767
SPREAD LIES TO INCITE A VIOLENT 
ATTACK ON OUR CAPITAL AND ON LAW

02:45:33.974 --> 02:45:38.506
ENFORCEMENT ON ON ALL OF US. 
THEN HE LIED AGAIN TO HIS BASE 

02:45:38.923 --> 02:45:43.240
TELLING THEM THAT THIS WAS ALL 
OKAY UNACCEPTABLE. THAT IS WHY 

02:45:43.441 --> 02:45:45.441
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SO DANGEROUS.

02:45:49.236 --> 02:45:51.094
BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE ALL 
AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT ANY 

02:45:51.095 --> 02:45:53.640
PRESIDENT WHO COMES AFTER HIM 
CAN DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

02:45:58.896 --> 02:46:00.932
THAT IS WHY LACK OF REMORSE IS 
AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN 

02:46:01.148 --> 02:46:03.148
IMPEACHMENT. BECAUSE 
IMPEACHMENT, CONVICTION

02:46:05.698 --> 02:46:08.185
, AND DISQUALIFICATION IS NOT 
JUST ABOUT THE PAST. IT IS ABOUT

02:46:08.946 --> 02:46:15.753
THE FUTURE. IT IS MAKING SURE 
THAT NO FUTURE OFFICIAL OR 

02:46:15.890 --> 02:46:21.612
PRESIDENT DOES THE SAME EXACT 
THING PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES. 

02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:26.772
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LACK OF 
REMORSE SHOWS THAT HE WILL 

02:46:26.969 --> 02:46:28.867
UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE FUTURE HARM, 
IF ALLOWED. HE REFUSES TO 

02:46:28.868 --> 02:46:33.489
ACCOUNT FOR HIS PREVIOUS CRIME 
AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT

02:46:37.338 --> 02:46:39.638
. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AFRAID OF 
DONALD TRUMP RUNNING AGAIN IN 

02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:41.898
FOUR YEARS, I'M AFRAID HE'S 
GOING TO RUN AGAIN AND LOSE, 

02:46:42.112 --> 02:46:49.544
BECAUSE HE CAN DO THIS AGAIN. WE
ARE IN AN UNUSUAL SITUATION. 

02:46:49.747 --> 02:46:52.625
DESPITE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLAIM 
THAT EVERYONE THINKS THAT WHAT 

02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:58.456
HE DID WAS FINE. SOME OF COME 
OUT AND SPOKEN SO STRONGLY AND 

02:46:58.655 --> 02:47:01.388
PASSIONATELY ABOUT WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO 

02:47:01.605 --> 02:47:03.686
HIGHLIGHT A STATEMENT FROM 
REPRESENTATIVE ANTHONY GONZALEZ 

02:47:04.444 --> 02:47:06.444
WHO SAID

02:47:11.464 --> 02:47:13.549
, THE VICE PRESIDENT AND BOTH 
CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE THEIR 

02:47:13.762 --> 02:47:16.044
LIVES PUT IN DANGER AS RESULT OF
THE PRESENT'S ACTIONS IN THE 

02:47:16.254 --> 02:47:18.254
EVENTS LEADING UP TO AND ON

02:47:21.621 --> 02:47:23.475
JANUARY 6. DURING THE ATTACK 
ITSELF, THE PRESIDENT ABANDON 

02:47:23.476 --> 02:47:25.549
HIS POST WELL MANY MEMBERS ASKED
FOR HELP AND FURTHER LEE 

02:47:25.753 --> 02:47:27.753
ENDANGERED ALL THOSE PRESENT

02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:33.370
. THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL THREATS 
NOT JUST TO LIVES, BUT TO THE 

02:47:33.567 --> 02:47:37.125
VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR REPUBLIC.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW 

02:47:37.339 --> 02:47:39.802
WHAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAID 
LEADING UP TO THE MOST BY THE 

02:47:40.006 --> 02:47:43.860
PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT VOTE IN 
U.S. HISTORY. I DO WANT EVERYONE

02:47:43.993 --> 02:47:45.993
WATCHING,

02:47:47.867 --> 02:47:49.554
ESPECIALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
SUPPORTERS TO SEE FIRSTHAND WHAT

02:47:49.555 --> 02:47:51.555
I BELIEVE WE ALL FEEL

02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:57.561
. THAT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID 
WAS NOT APPROPRIATE AND THAT IT 

02:47:57.755 --> 02:48:00.650
WAS NOT AMERICAN AND THAT IT 
ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND. 

02:48:00.651 --> 02:48:04.374
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT HE HAS DONE AND WHAT HE 
HAS CAUSED HERE IS SOMETHING WE 

02:48:04.578 --> 02:48:07.246
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN OUR 
HISTORY. 

02:48:07.247 --> 02:48:13.419
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BECOME [ 

02:48:13.623 --> 02:48:17.788
INDISCERNIBLE ] FROM HIS DUTY 
AND REALITY ITSELF. 

02:48:17.789 --> 02:48:19.789
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:48:21.633 --> 02:48:24.122
WHAT HAPPENED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ON
JANUARY 6 AND IN HIS SPEECH THAT

02:48:24.483 --> 02:48:27.175
DAY, HE PROMOTED BASELESS 
THEORIES PROMOTING A ENVIRONMENT

02:48:27.377 --> 02:48:29.377
OF

02:48:34.980 --> 02:48:37.055
DIVISION. TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES TO INCITE 

02:48:37.256 --> 02:48:39.337
THIS ATTACK WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES
IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE FUTURE

02:48:39.539 --> 02:48:42.250
OF THIS DEMOCRACY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER THIS TRIAL, I HOPE YOU 

02:48:42.467 --> 02:48:47.390
WILL COME TOGETHER AND CAST YOUR
VOTE AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR 

02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:52.706
HOW WE, AS A CONGRESS, AND AS A 
NATION, FEEL ABOUT ONE DONALD 

02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:57.893
TRUMP DID BY CONVICTING HIM. AND
PREVENT THIS FROM BEING ONLY THE

02:48:58.095 --> 02:49:00.095
BEGINNING, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID

02:49:03.273 --> 02:49:05.936
, AND IT SURE FUTURE PRESIDENTS 
WHO DO NOT LIKE THE OUTCOME OF A

02:49:06.136 --> 02:49:08.003
NATIONAL ELECTION FROM BELIEVING
THEY CAN FOLLOW IN PRESIDENT 

02:49:08.004 --> 02:49:12.103
TRUMP'S FOOTSTEPS. IT IS WHAT 
OUR CONSTITUTION REQUIRES AND IT

02:49:12.306 --> 02:49:14.306
IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY DESERVES.

02:49:21.674 --> 02:49:27.897
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPRESENTATIVE TO GET WILL 
SHOW HOW EXTREMISTS WERE 

02:49:28.272 --> 02:49:31.058
EMBOLDENED AND PLANNED TO ATTACK
THE INAUGURATION

02:49:55.242 --> 02:49:59.360
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHOWED YOU
THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF HOW

02:49:59.576 --> 02:50:03.522
PRESIDENT TRUMP OPUS CONDUCT 
ASSEMBLED, INCITED, AND INFLAMED

02:50:06.137 --> 02:50:09.221
THE MOB. WE HAVE SHOWN HOW AND 
WHY THIS ATTACK AND THIS 

02:50:09.424 --> 02:50:12.112
VIOLENCE WAS NOT ONLY 
FORESEEABLE, BUT PREVENTABLE. WE

02:50:12.872 --> 02:50:17.617
SHOWED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW
HIS CONDUCT COULD AND WOULD 

02:50:17.833 --> 02:50:23.237
RESULT IN VIOLENCE. AND, WHEN 
THE ATTACK OCCURRED, HE DID NOT

02:50:25.628 --> 02:50:27.628
FULFILL HIS DUTY AS 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND DEFEND 

02:50:27.675 --> 02:50:33.714
US. INSTEAD, HE WAS DELIGHTED. 
DONALD TRUMP INCITED A VIOLENT 

02:50:34.476 --> 02:50:36.476
INSURRECTION.

02:50:38.418 --> 02:50:43.421
HE FAILED TO DEFEND OUR NATION, 
OUR CAPITAL, THIS CONGRESS, AND 

02:50:43.622 --> 02:50:47.781
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM THE 
ATTACK INSIDE IT. NOW I WANT TO 

02:50:47.998 --> 02:50:52.126
TURN TO THE IMPACT. THE 
LONG-TERM HARM OF THIS CONDUCT. 

02:50:52.341 --> 02:50:57.079
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL WALK 
THROUGH THE BREADTH AND GRAVITY 

02:50:57.294 --> 02:51:02.250
OF THIS HARM. I WOULD LIKE TO 
START WITH THE EFFECT THAT 

02:51:02.464 --> 02:51:05.992
PRESIDENT TRUMP OPUS CONDUCT HAD
ON OUR DOMESTIC SECURITY. WE 

02:51:06.758 --> 02:51:08.758
SAW, FIRSTHAND

02:51:11.732 --> 02:51:13.732
, HOW DONALD TRUMP'S CONDUCT IN 
BOLDED AND ESCALATED DOMESTIC 

02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:18.341
VIOLENCE AND EXTREMISM. THIS IS 
KNOWN IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

02:51:18.557 --> 02:51:24.783
COMMUNITY AS DV ES. THESE PEOPLE
WERE AND ARE MADE WORSE BY

02:51:28.019 --> 02:51:30.019
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REFUSAL TO 
TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY AND HIS 

02:51:30.082 --> 02:51:32.082
REFUSAL BULL TO

02:51:37.064 --> 02:51:39.163
DENOUNCE WHAT THE FBI IDENTIFIED
AS SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS 

02:51:39.365 --> 02:51:41.643
ELEMENTS OF OUR COUNTRY. EVEN AS
THE ATTACK WAS UNDERWAY, HE 

02:51:41.849 --> 02:51:48.206
TWEETED WORDS OF SUPPORT TO HIS 
VIOLENT SUPPORTERS. AND THAT, IN

02:51:48.420 --> 02:51:52.085
THE AFTERMATH OF JANUARY 7, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR 

02:51:52.491 --> 02:51:54.491
THAT THIS WAS ONLY THE 
BEGINNING.

02:52:00.312 --> 02:52:02.334
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; UNTO ALL OF MY WONDERFUL 
SUPPORTERS, I KNOW YOU ARE 

02:52:02.537 --> 02:52:05.149
DISAPPOINTED, BUT I ALSO WANT 
YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR INCREDIBLE 

02:52:05.296 --> 02:52:07.296
JOURNEY IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING

02:52:10.113 --> 02:52:13.128
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE WAS RIGHT. UNLESS WE TAKE 

02:52:13.264 --> 02:52:20.410
ACTION, THE VIOLENCE IS ONLY 
JUST BEGINNING. IN THE AFTERMATH

02:52:20.624 --> 02:52:24.369
OF THE ATTACK, WE SAW A HUGE 
RISE IN THREATS FROM DOMESTIC 

02:52:25.145 --> 02:52:29.855
VIOLENT EXTREMISTS. INCLUDING 
SPECIFIC THREATS TO THE 

02:52:29.998 --> 02:52:31.998
INAUGURATION

02:52:35.652 --> 02:52:37.713
IN D.C. MAC AND DO ALL 50 STATE 
CAPITALS. OUR INTELLIGENCE 

02:52:37.915 --> 02:52:39.915
AGENCIES CONFIRMED THAT IN 
ADDITION

02:52:43.647 --> 02:52:45.063
TO THE SPECIFIC THREATS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CONDUCT 

02:52:45.064 --> 02:52:47.064
EMBOLDENED THE VERY SAME VIOLENT
GROUPS WHO INITIATED THE ATTACK 

02:52:47.147 --> 02:52:50.586
AND SPARKED NEW VIOLENT 
COALITIONS. THESE GROUPS 

02:52:50.747 --> 02:52:56.196
BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE 
FOLLOWING HIS ORDERS. THEY 

02:52:56.398 --> 02:52:58.423
BELIEVE THEIR ACTS OF 
INSURRECTION AND VIOLENCE ARE 

02:52:58.557 --> 02:53:00.557
PATRIOTIC.

02:53:02.802 --> 02:53:06.915
VIOLENCE IS NEVER PATRIOTIC AND 
IT'S NEVER AMERICAN. IT'S NOT 

02:53:07.119 --> 02:53:09.741
THE DEMOCRATIC WAY AND IT'S NOT 
THE REPUBLICAN WAY. AFTER THE 

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:16.162
ATTACK, THE NATION'S TOP DEFENSE
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 

02:53:16.565 --> 02:53:18.565
REPORTED AN INCREASE IN CREDIBLE
THREATS TO THE INAUGURATION FROM

02:53:19.157 --> 02:53:21.157
DONALD TRUMP

02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:30.298
'S SUPPORTERS. ON JANUARY 13, 
2021, A JOINT INTELLIGENCE 

02:53:30.299 --> 02:53:31.968
BULLETIN ISSUED BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,

02:53:31.969 --> 02:53:36.460
THE FBI, AND THE NATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM ORGANIZATION 

02:53:36.664 --> 02:53:39.483
FOUND THAT QUOTE SINCE THE 
JANUARY 6 EVENT, VIOLENT ONLINE 

02:53:39.618 --> 02:53:44.086
RHETORIC CONCERNING THE 
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION HAS 

02:53:44.287 --> 02:53:48.988
INCREASED WITH SOME CALLING FOR 
UNSPECIFIED, QUOTE, 

02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:55.341
THE JANUARY 6 FATAL SHOOTING BY 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OF A PARTICIPANT

02:53:55.542 --> 02:53:57.542
WHO ILLEGALLY ENTERED THE 
CAPITOL BUILDING . AND ANOTHER 

02:53:57.833 --> 02:54:02.969
POSTING THAT SAID THAT MANY 
ARMED INDIVIDUALS WOULD RETURN 

02:54:03.172 --> 02:54:08.670
ON 19 JANUARY. THE AGENCIES ALSO
MADE CLEAR WHY THE THREATS WERE 

02:54:08.809 --> 02:54:11.567
ESCALATING, ESPECIALLY REGARDING
THE INAUGURATION. THE REPORT 

02:54:11.701 --> 02:54:17.596
EXPLAINED THAT A PRIMARY 
MOTIVATING FACTOR WAS, QUOTE, 

02:54:17.799 --> 02:54:21.203
THE SHARED FALSE NARRATIVE OF A 
STOLEN ELECTION.

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:27.443
AND, OPPOSITION TO THE CHANGE IN
CONTROL OF THE EXECUTIVE AND 

02:54:27.645 --> 02:54:31.360
LEGISLATIVE WRENCHES OF THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT MAY NEED 

02:54:31.561 --> 02:54:34.645
SOME INDIVIDUALS TO ADOPT THE 
BELIEF THAT THERE IS NO 

02:54:34.848 --> 02:54:38.127
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS 
THEIR GRIEVANCES AND THAT 

02:54:38.544 --> 02:54:42.558
VIOLENT ACTION IS NECESSARY. IN 
OTHER WORDS, PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:54:49.261 --> 02:54:50.710
'S SPREADING OF INFLAMMATORY 
DISINFORMATION ABOUT THE 

02:54:50.711 --> 02:54:52.551
ELECTION AND CITED THE 
INSURRECTION ON JANUARY 6 AND 

02:54:52.552 --> 02:54:54.552
MAY LEADS TO FURTHER VIOLENCE. 
ONLINE

02:54:57.301 --> 02:55:00.016
, JUST AS THEY DID PRIOR TO THE 
JANUARY 6 ATTACK, TRUMP 

02:55:00.232 --> 02:55:04.981
SUPPORTERS TOOK TO THE INTERNET 
TO ORGANIZE AND DOCUMENT THEIR 

02:55:05.185 --> 02:55:08.824
DESIRE AND PLANS FOR FUTURE 
VIOLENCE AT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 

02:55:08.958 --> 02:55:10.958
INAUGURATION.

02:55:12.546 --> 02:55:14.712
AND, INDEED, IN THE DAYS SHORTLY
AFTER THE ATTACK

02:55:18.553 --> 02:55:20.402
, SEVERAL POSTERS ON EXTREME 
SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES MADE 

02:55:20.403 --> 02:55:24.123
FURTHER PLANS FOR VIOLENCE. THEY
POSTED, QUOTE, MANY OF US WILL 

02:55:24.324 --> 02:55:26.449
RETURN ON JANUARY 9 TEEN, 2021

02:55:32.108 --> 02:55:34.108
, CARRYING OUR WEAPONS IN 
SUPPORT OF OUR NATION'S RESOLVED

02:55:34.154 --> 02:55:39.350
TO WHICH THE WORLD WILL NEVER 
FORGET. WE WILL COME IN NUMBERS.

02:55:39.555 --> 02:55:44.080
NO STANDING ARMY OR POLICE 
AGENCY CAN MATCH. QUOTE, WE TOOK

02:55:44.282 --> 02:55:48.211
THE BUILDING ONCE AND WE CAN 
TAKE IT AGAIN. OTHER USERS, 

02:55:48.632 --> 02:55:53.116
EAGER TO PARTICIPATE IN 
ADDITIONAL ATTACKS CONFIRMED 

02:55:53.511 --> 02:55:55.372
THEY WERE WAITING ON PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT 

02:55:55.373 --> 02:55:59.692
TO DO NEXT. REFERRING TO A 
FUTURE PLANNED ATTACK, A USER ON

02:56:00.455 --> 02:56:02.455
THE UNKNOWN

02:56:04.195 --> 02:56:08.473
-- ON THE PLATFORM KNOWN AS GAP 
SAID, DOES OUR PRESIDENT WANT US

02:56:08.611 --> 02:56:10.611
THERE

02:56:12.843 --> 02:56:14.843
? AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN FACT, IN THE DAYS LEADING 

02:56:14.915 --> 02:56:20.486
UP TO THE INAUGURATION, MULTIPLE
INDIVIDUALS, MANY POTENTIALLY IN

02:56:20.691 --> 02:56:22.939
AN ATTEMPT TO CARRY OUT THE 
PLOTS THAT I JUST PREVIEWED, 

02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:27.043
WERE ARRESTED IN WASHINGTON, 
D.C., INCLUDING ON SERIOUS 

02:56:27.818 --> 02:56:33.016
WEAPONS CHARGES. ONE OF THOSE 
MEN WAS GRIFFIN, THE FOUNDER OF 

02:56:33.231 --> 02:56:41.060
COWBOYS FOR TRUMP. HE WAS ALSO 
ARRESTED ON JANUARY 17. 

02:56:41.884 --> 02:56:43.884
WHAT HE SAID

02:56:47.406 --> 02:56:49.871
ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR VIOLENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WANT TO SAY THAT WAS MOB 

02:56:50.074 --> 02:56:54.614
AND VIOLENCE. NO, SIR, NO, MA'AM
. WE COULD HAVE A SECOND 

02:56:54.829 --> 02:56:56.944
AMENDMENT RALLY ON THE SAME 
STEPS WHERE WE HAD THE RALLY 

02:56:57.146 --> 02:57:01.292
YESTERDAY. IF WE DO, THEN IT 
WILL BE A SAD DAY BECAUSE THERE 

02:57:01.494 --> 02:57:04.140
WILL BE BLOOD RUNNING OUT OF 
THAT BUILDING. AT THE END OF THE

02:57:04.357 --> 02:57:10.032
DAY, YOU WILL MARK MY WORD THAT 
WE WILL PLANT A FLAG ON THE DESK

02:57:10.235 --> 02:57:11.891
OF NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK 
SCHUMER. 

02:57:11.892 --> 02:57:15.955
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BLOOD RUNNING OUT OF THE 
BUILDING. THIS BUILDING. THE 

02:57:16.712 --> 02:57:19.925
CAPITOL  WHERE ALL OF US ARE 
RIGHT NOW.

02:57:24.201 --> 02:57:29.746
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW, THE NAME COUY GRIFFIN 
MAY SOUND FAMILIAR BECAUSE HE 

02:57:29.950 --> 02:57:34.543
PREVIOUSLY  FACED CONTROVERSY 
WHEN HE SAID

02:57:37.967 --> 02:57:42.289
QUOTE, THE ONLY GOOD DEMOCRAT IS
A DEAD DEMOCRAT. 

02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:44.788
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION 
THAT THE ONLY GOOD DEMOCRAT IS A

02:57:45.004 --> 02:57:47.004
DEAD DEMOCRAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ].

02:57:51.609 --> 02:57:54.002
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW, WHEN HE SAID THIS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY TWEETED

02:57:54.137 --> 02:57:56.389
GRIFFIN AND THANKED HIM FOR THAT
SENTIMENT.

02:58:00.634 --> 02:58:06.698
WHEN DONALD TRUMP RETWEETED 
THIS, HE WAS NO STRANGER TO 

02:58:06.834 --> 02:58:10.146
GRIFFIN. IN FACT, IN MARCH 2019

02:58:14.014 --> 02:58:16.289
, OVER A YEAR EARLIER, GRIFFIN 
AND TRUMP SPOKE ON THE PHONE 

02:58:16.493 --> 02:58:19.878
NEARLY 30 MINUTES. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S CONDUCT, WITHOUT A DOUBT

02:58:20.822 --> 02:58:24.299
, MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE 
SUPPORTED GRIFFIN. IN FACT, 

02:58:24.501 --> 02:58:26.501
GRIFFIN EVEN SAID SO HIMSELF

02:58:31.253 --> 02:58:33.253
. AS GRIFFIN LATER SAID ABOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REITs WEEDING 

02:58:33.325 --> 02:58:35.199
HIS INFLAMMATORY COMMENT ABOUT 
THE DEAD DEMOCRATS, QUOTE, IT 

02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:38.954
REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME BECAUSE
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

02:58:39.155 --> 02:58:44.783
UNITED STATES HAS MY BACK. 
REMEMBER, THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS 

02:58:44.985 --> 02:58:49.892
HERE ON JANUARY 6. HE WAS 
ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING TO 

02:58:50.094 --> 02:58:53.134
COME BACK HERE TO MAKE BLOOD 
COME RUNNING OUT OF THIS 

02:58:53.273 --> 02:58:55.554
BUILDING. THREATS LIKE GRIFFIN'S
HAVE

02:58:59.172 --> 02:59:01.172
TRIGGERED A DEPLOYMENT OF 
FORCES, THE LIKES OF WHICH WE 

02:59:01.234 --> 02:59:05.604
HAVE NEVER SEEN. THERE WERE 
APPROXIMATELY 25,000 NATIONAL 

02:59:05.817 --> 02:59:08.491
GUARD TROOPS BROUGHT IN FROM 
AROUND THE COUNTRY TO PROTECT 

02:59:09.453 --> 02:59:14.337
D.C. LEADING UP TO AND ON 
INAUGURATION DAY. AS YOU KNOW

02:59:16.725 --> 02:59:19.697
MANY OF THOSE TROOPS ARE STILL 
HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

02:59:28.225 --> 02:59:30.225
THESE

02:59:32.418 --> 02:59:34.488
WERE SCENES THAT PLAYED OUT ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE 

02:59:34.690 --> 02:59:39.077
SIEGE ON THE CAPITOL  ON JANUARY
11, 2021 THE FBI SAID THAT ARMED

02:59:39.277 --> 02:59:44.839
PROTESTS ARE BEING PLANNED IT 
ALL 50 STATE CAPITALS FROM 16 

02:59:45.039 --> 02:59:49.743
JANUARY THROUGH 20 JANUARY AND 
AT THE U.S. CAPITOL FROM 17 

02:59:49.942 --> 02:59:54.097
JANUARY THROUGH 20 JANUARY. AS A
RESULT, AT LEAST 21 STATES 

02:59:54.518 --> 02:59:57.201
ACTIVATED THEIR NATIONAL GUARD 
SENT PREPARATION FOR THE 

02:59:58.174 --> 03:00:00.174
POTENTIAL ATTACKS.

03:00:02.385 --> 03:00:04.404
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INCITEMENT HAS
REVERBERATED AROUND THE COUNTRY.

03:00:04.542 --> 03:00:06.542
PROMPTING

03:00:09.173 --> 03:00:10.638
MASSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
MOBILIZATION IN SEVERAL STATE 

03:00:10.639 --> 03:00:14.273
CAPITALS, INCLUDING WASHINGTON, 
ILLINOIS, MICHIGAN, AND GEORGIA.

03:00:17.089 --> 03:00:22.565
LOOK AT THESE PHOTOS. THIS IS 
WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE TO 

03:00:22.695 --> 03:00:27.760
AMERICA. THIS MASSIVE DEPLOYMENT
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS COST THE 

03:00:28.399 --> 03:00:30.399
TAXPAYERS DEARLY. THE NATIONAL 
GUARD DEPLOYMENT

03:00:34.403 --> 03:00:36.680
TO D.C. ALONE IS EXPECTED TO 
COST AT LEAST $480 MILLION. THE 

03:00:36.893 --> 03:00:42.578
BILLS ARE ALSO RACKING UP IN THE
STATES. NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH 

03:00:42.718 --> 03:00:44.718
CAROLINA

03:00:47.746 --> 03:00:49.576
, PENNSYLVANIA, UTAH, AND 
WISCONSIN HAVE EACH SPENT ABOUT 

03:00:49.577 --> 03:00:52.888
HALF $1 MILLION TO SAFEGUARD 
THEIR CAPITALS IN THE RUNOFF TO 

03:00:53.491 --> 03:01:00.246
THE INAUGURATION. OHIO SPENT 
$1.2 MILLION OVER THE SAME TWO 

03:01:00.448 --> 03:01:06.209
WEEK PERIOD. REMEMBER THAT THIS 
IS AT A TIME WHEN STATE BUDGETS 

03:01:06.614 --> 03:01:09.513
ARE ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER THE 
WEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. OUR 

03:01:09.716 --> 03:01:13.207
BRAVE SERVICEMEMBERS SHOWED UP 
AND THANKS TO THEIR DEDICATION 

03:01:13.963 --> 03:01:18.750
AND VIGILANCE, THE INAUGURATION 
IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO IT 

03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:25.015
PROCEEDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. IN 
FACT, AFTER NEWS BROKE OF LAW 

03:01:25.155 --> 03:01:27.155
ENFORCEMENT

03:01:28.178 --> 03:01:30.178
'S PREPAREDNESS FOR FURTHER 
ATTACKS, LEADERS OF THE PROUD 

03:01:30.227 --> 03:01:35.351
BOYS AND ORGANIZERS OF THE MEGA 
MAN MARCH TOLD FOLLOWERS TO 

03:01:35.552 --> 03:01:40.952
AVOID PROTESTS UP TO OR LEADING 
UP TO THE INAUGURATION FOR FEAR 

03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:44.447
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD CRUSH
THEM AND ARREST THE WRITERS WHO 

03:01:45.206 --> 03:01:49.583
SHOWED UP. THANK GOD THERE WAS 
NOT AN INSURRECTION HERE ON 

03:01:50.348 --> 03:01:52.348
JANUARY 20.

03:01:55.097 --> 03:01:57.785
BUT, LOOK AT THE PRICE WE HAVE 
PAID AND THE PRICE WE ARE STILL 

03:01:57.986 --> 03:02:00.881
PAYING. IT IS NOT JUST DOLLARS 
AND CENTS. THIS CAPITOL HAS 

03:02:01.098 --> 03:02:06.175
BECOME A FORTRESS  AS STATE 
CAPITOLS HAVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:02:07.276 --> 03:02:11.139
. OUR CONSTITUENTS NO LONGER 
HAVE HAVE HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTED

03:02:11.281 --> 03:02:13.281
REPRESENTATIVES. EVERY DEMOCRAT 
AND REPUBLICAN

03:02:17.035 --> 03:02:19.098
, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE
ON JANUARY 6, PEACEFULLY, ARE 

03:02:19.314 --> 03:02:24.896
PAYING THE PRICE. IT IS NOT JUST
A LACK OF ACCESS, IT IS A 

03:02:25.097 --> 03:02:29.231
DIMMING OF FREEDOM AND IT'S A 
DIMMING OF ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS. 

03:02:29.436 --> 03:02:31.436
WE MUST UPHOLD OUR OATH

03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:37.043
AS THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE DONE 

03:02:37.238 --> 03:02:40.942
IN THE WAKE OF JANUARY 6. 
BECAUSE, IF WE DO NOT, PRESIDENT

03:02:41.146 --> 03:02:43.146
TRUMP'S MOB STANDS READY FOR 
MORE ATTACKS.

03:02:49.797 --> 03:02:52.269
NOW, THIS SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE.
HAD HE BEEN A COMMANDER IN CHIEF

03:02:52.483 --> 03:02:54.483
WHO INCITES VIOLENCE HAS GIVEN 
LIFE TO THE EXISTING VIOLENT 

03:02:54.548 --> 03:02:57.108
GROUPS THAT HE SPENT YEARS 
CULTIVATING AND HE HAS INSPIRED

03:03:08.284 --> 03:03:10.284
NEW COALITIONS AMONG EXTREMIST 
GROUPS WHO VIEW JANUARY AS A 

03:03:10.372 --> 03:03:12.228
SUCCESS. ACCORDING TO THE FBI, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ASSEMBLAGE OF 

03:03:12.229 --> 03:03:15.929
HIS MOB WAS PARTICULARLY 
DANGEROUS BECAUSE QUOTE,  IN 

03:03:16.131 --> 03:03:17.792
PERSON ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN DVES 
OF DIFFERENT ETIOLOGICAL GOALS 

03:03:17.793 --> 03:03:20.879
DURING THE CAPITOL BREACH  
LIKELY SERVE TO, FOSTER 

03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:25.784
CONNECTIONS WHICH MAY INCREASE 
WILLINGNESS, CAPABILITY AND 

03:03:25.988 --> 03:03:28.855
MOTIVATION TO ATTACK AND 
UNDERMINE THE GOVERNMENT THAT 

03:03:29.057 --> 03:03:33.957
THEY VIEW AS ILLEGITIMATE. IN 
OTHER WORDS, THEY ALL GOT TO 

03:03:34.158 --> 03:03:36.158
TALKING TO EACH OTHER. THIS 
BULLETIN

03:03:39.271 --> 03:03:41.271
BY OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE WAS ALSO CONFIRMED BY 

03:03:41.706 --> 03:03:43.706
CONCRETE EVIDENCE

03:03:45.856 --> 03:03:48.715
. RIOTERS CELEBRATED THEIR ROLES
IN A JANUARY 6 ATTACK ON SOCIAL 

03:03:48.854 --> 03:03:53.503
MEDIA.  THEY BOASTED ABOUT THEIR
SUCCESS IN BREACHING THE CAPITOL

03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:55.766
AND FORCING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
AND THE VICE PRESIDENT TO 

03:03:55.982 --> 03:04:05.004
EVACUATE. TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, A 
RIGHT WING PROVOCATEUR. THE 

03:04:05.404 --> 03:04:09.757
BEFORE THE INSURRECTION, HE SAID
ON HIS INTERNET SHOW, WHAT YOU 

03:04:09.959 --> 03:04:15.694
AND I DO WITH THE STATE 
LEGISLATURE. I AM NOT 

03:04:16.592 --> 03:04:20.628
THAT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE WAS AT THE CAPITOL ON 

03:04:20.828 --> 03:04:25.140
JANUARY 6  AND PRAISED THE 
INSURRECTION AS GLORIOUS AND 

03:04:25.339 --> 03:04:27.339
AWE-INSPIRING. HE LATER SAID, 
QUOTE

03:04:31.266 --> 03:04:33.544
, WE FORCED A JOINT SESSION OF 
CONGRESS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT 

03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:36.309
TO EVACUATE

03:04:42.354 --> 03:04:43.994
BECAUSE TRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE 
BANGING DOWN AND SUCCESSFULLY 

03:04:43.995 --> 03:04:46.119
BURST THROUGH THE DOORS. HE WAS 
NOT THE ONLY PROVOCATEUR TO 

03:04:46.335 --> 03:04:50.279
REVEL IN THE VIOLENCE. ACCORDING
TO MIKE DUNN, AN ANTIGOVERNMENT 

03:04:50.683 --> 03:04:52.683
MOVEMENT WHO HAD MULTIPLE GROUPS

03:04:59.930 --> 03:05:01.763
STORMING THE CAPITOL. THEY WILL 
BE WORKING OVERTIME TO 

03:05:01.764 --> 03:05:04.037
CAPITALIZE ON THE JANUARY 6 
RIOTS AND HOPE IT WILL LEAD TO 

03:05:04.239 --> 03:05:08.361
MORE ACTION . THEY SAID, QUOTE, 
JUST KNOW THERE IS MORE TO COME.

03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:10.825
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PROUD BOYS MEMBERS WERE 
BRAGGING ABOUT THE ATTACK ON THE

03:05:11.039 --> 03:05:16.209
CAPITOL.  ONE POST ON THE PROUD 
BOYS CHANNEL SAID THAT PEOPLE 

03:05:16.410 --> 03:05:22.652
SAW WHAT WE CAN DO AND THEY KNOW
WHAT WE ARE UP TO AND THEY WANT 

03:05:22.869 --> 03:05:24.989
IN. THE LEADER OF THE PROUD 
BOYS, HIMSELF, SENT THE SAME 

03:05:25.189 --> 03:05:27.189
MESSAGE. HE SAID

03:05:29.486 --> 03:05:31.486
, THAT THE PROUD BOYS WOULD BE 
ACTIVE DURING BIDEN'S 

03:05:31.530 --> 03:05:37.738
PRESIDENCY. HE SAID YOU WILL 
DEFINITELY SEE MORE OF US. AND 

03:05:37.939 --> 03:05:40.840
EXTREMIST GROUPS ARE BOASTING 
THAT THE ATTACK ON OUR CAPITOL  

03:05:41.259 --> 03:05:44.521
IS A BOON FOR THEIR RECRUITMENT 
EFFORTS. SECURITY FORCE LEADER, 

03:05:45.282 --> 03:05:47.282
CHRIS HILL

03:05:50.065 --> 03:05:52.124
, SAID HE HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY 
SEVERAL PEOPLE INTERESTED IN 

03:05:52.327 --> 03:05:56.835
JOINING SINCE THEY INSURRECTION.
AND FOCUSING ON DOMESTIC 

03:05:57.052 --> 03:05:59.052
EXTREMISM, GERRIT HOLT STATED 
THAT BY

03:06:02.762 --> 03:06:04.813
ALL MEASURABLE EFFECTS, THIS IT 
WAS FAR RIGHT EXTREMISTS AND ONE

03:06:05.230 --> 03:06:10.562
OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS 
THEY HAVE WATCHED. THEY ARE 

03:06:10.765 --> 03:06:12.809
TALKING ABOUT THIS AS A FIRST 
STAB AT A GREATER RESOLUTION. 

03:06:13.011 --> 03:06:15.011
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS INDICATED BY MR. HOLT

03:06:19.546 --> 03:06:21.368
, THE PERCEIVED SUCCESS HAS 
GIVEN ENCOURAGEMENT TO CONTINUE 

03:06:21.369 --> 03:06:23.738
AND TO ESCALATE ATTACKS. 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE NOTED

03:06:30.155 --> 03:06:31.816
THAT THESE EXTREMIST GROUPS WILL
UNFORTUNATELY BE TARGETING 

03:06:31.817 --> 03:06:34.889
VULNERABLE MINORITY COMMUNITIES 
IN THE U.S.. 

03:06:34.890 --> 03:06:39.763
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ON JANUARY 27, 2021, DHS 
SAID THAT QUOTE, LONG-STANDING 

03:06:39.907 --> 03:06:41.907
AND

03:06:46.781 --> 03:06:49.250
ETHNIC TENSION THAT LED TO THE 
SORT OF A MAN KILLING 23 PEOPLE 

03:06:49.466 --> 03:06:51.526
AT AN EL PASO WALMART WILL 
CONTINUE TO GROW AND MOTIVATE 

03:06:52.295 --> 03:06:56.273
FURTHER ATTACKS. THE JANUARY 13 
JOINT INTELLIGENCE REPORT STATED

03:06:56.475 --> 03:06:58.834
THAT IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER 
TYPES OF VIOLENCE LISTED,

03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:07.720
DVE'S MAY BE INCITED TO CARRY 
OUT MORE VIOLENCE, INCLUDING 

03:07:07.783 --> 03:07:12.323
VIOLENCE AGAINST RACIAL, ETHNIC 
AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES  AND 

03:07:12.527 --> 03:07:13.778
ASSOCIATED INSTITUTIONS, 
JOURNALISTS, MEMBERS OF THE 

03:07:13.779 --> 03:07:18.251
LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY AND OTHER 
TARGETS COMMON AMONG SOME DVE'S 

03:07:20.582 --> 03:07:22.993
. THESE PREJUDICED ELEMENTS 
COULD BE SEEN VISIBLY IN THE 

03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:27.823
ATTACK AND IN THE CROWD THAT 
ATTACKED THE CAPITOL . PICTURED 

03:07:28.025 --> 03:07:32.673
HERE IS ROBERT PACKER. ROBERT 
PACKER IS AN AVOWED WHITE 

03:07:32.815 --> 03:07:34.815
SUPREMACIST

03:07:36.252 --> 03:07:39.947
AND AVOWED HOLOCAUST DENIER. HE 
WORE A SHOW SHIRT THAT SAID 

03:07:40.367 --> 03:07:44.751
QUOTE, CAMP AUSCHWITZ. AS YOU 
HAVE HEARD,

03:07:50.796 --> 03:07:52.449
THE INSURRECTIONIST THAT 
ATTACKED THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 

03:07:52.450 --> 03:07:54.450
6 HURLED RACIAL SLUR'S 

03:07:59.796 --> 03:08:01.451
INCLUDING AT BLACK POLICE 
OFFICERS. ONE OFFICER DESCRIBED 

03:08:01.452 --> 03:08:03.527
THE TRAUMA HE EXPERIENCED WHEN 
THE RIOTERS SEIZED THE CAPITOL .

03:08:04.286 --> 03:08:07.428
HE SAID QUOTE, I'M A BLACK 
OFFICER AND THERE WAS A LOT OF 

03:08:07.631 --> 03:08:10.379
RACISM THAT DAY. I WAS CALLED 
RACIAL SLUR'S AND IN THE MOMENT

03:08:13.563 --> 03:08:16.597
, I DID NOT PROCESS THIS AS 
TRAUMATIC. I WAS JUST TRYING TO 

03:08:16.734 --> 03:08:18.734
SURVIVE

03:08:23.212 --> 03:08:25.869
. I JUST WANTED TO GET HOME TO 
SEE MY DAUGHTER AGAIN. I COULD 

03:08:26.083 --> 03:08:28.083
NOT SHOW WEAKNESS. I FINALLY 
REACHED A SAFE PLACE SURROUNDED 

03:08:28.191 --> 03:08:30.868
BY OFFICERS AND I WAS ABLE TO 
CRY AND TO LET IT OUT. TO 

03:08:31.069 --> 03:08:33.069
ATTEMPT TO PROCESS IT.

03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:39.877
THESE EXTREMIST GROUPS WERE 
EMBOLDENED BECAUSE PRESIDENT 

03:08:39.878 --> 03:08:43.126
TRUMP TOLD THEM, REPEATEDLY, 
THAT THE INSURRECTIONIST 

03:08:43.267 --> 03:08:48.423
ACTIVITIES WERE THE PINNACLE OF 
PATRIOTISM. WELL, LET TODAY BE 

03:08:48.627 --> 03:08:53.844
THE DAY THAT WE RECLAIM THE 
DEFINITION OF PATRIOTISM

03:08:57.019 --> 03:09:00.947
IMPEACHMENT IS NOT TO PUNISH, 
BUT TO PREVENT. WE ARE NOT HERE 

03:09:01.148 --> 03:09:07.154
TO PUNISH DONALD TRUMP, WE ARE 
HERE TO PREVENT THE SEEDS OF 

03:09:07.356 --> 03:09:09.417
HATRED THAT HE PLANTED FROM 
BEARING ANY MORE FRUIT. AS MY 

03:09:10.195 --> 03:09:12.195
COLLEAGUES SHOWED

03:09:14.353 --> 03:09:16.946
, THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP INSPIRED 

03:09:17.095 --> 03:09:21.533
VIOLENCE. BUT, IT MUST BE THE 
LAST TIME THAT HE IS GIVEN A 

03:09:21.736 --> 03:09:28.713
PLATFORM TO DO SO. THIS MUST BE 
OUR WAKE-UP CALL. WE MUST 

03:09:28.930 --> 03:09:30.930
CONDEMN IT BECAUSE THE THREAT IS
NOT OVER

03:09:37.517 --> 03:09:39.517
. PRESIDENT TRUMP REFUSED TO 
CONDEMN THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE. 

03:09:39.627 --> 03:09:44.331
INSTEAD, OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE 
HAS ENCOURAGED IT. OUR RESPONSE 

03:09:44.535 --> 03:09:46.571
MUST BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME. WE 
SIMPLY CANNOT SWEEP THIS UNDER 

03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:51.522
THE RUG. WE MUST TAKE A UNITED 
STAND, ALL OF US THAT THIS IS 

03:09:52.128 --> 03:09:58.441
NOT AMERICAN. THE BACK TO AUGUST
2017 WHEN A YOUNG WOMAN WAS 

03:09:58.579 --> 03:10:01.800
MURDERED DURING A WHITE 
SUPREMACIST RALLY IN 

03:10:02.015 --> 03:10:04.115
CHARLOTTESVILLE, WEST VIRGINIA. 
HER NAME WAS HEATHER HEYER AND 

03:10:04.879 --> 03:10:06.879
HERNE MOTHER WAS SUSAN.

03:10:10.503 --> 03:10:12.942
HER MOTHER HAS BEEN A STEADFAST 
ADVOCATE FOR HER DAUGHTER'S 

03:10:13.083 --> 03:10:17.344
MEMORY. IN THE 2018 INTERVIEW, 
SHE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT 

03:10:17.557 --> 03:10:20.579
PEOPLE HAD RUSHED TOO QUICKLY TO
RECONCILIATION WITHOUT 

03:10:20.755 --> 03:10:22.755
ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:10:28.509 --> 03:10:34.843
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU RUSH TO HEAL AND IF 
YOU RUSH TO EVERYBODY GRAB EACH 

03:10:35.045 --> 03:10:38.529
OTHER AND SING KUMBAYA, WE'VE 
ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING AND WE WILL

03:10:38.731 --> 03:10:43.333
BE BACK HERE IN A FEW YEARS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK HERE IN

03:10:43.542 --> 03:10:47.637
A FEW YEARS. THOSE WERE HER 
WORDS AND 2018. THAT WAS THREE 

03:10:48.395 --> 03:10:52.620
YEARS AGO. HER DAUGHTER'S 
MURDERER WAS HELD TO ACCOUNT, 

03:10:52.837 --> 03:10:57.968
BUT OUR NATION DID NOT IMPOSE 
ANY MEANINGFUL ACCOUNTABILITY ON

03:10:58.733 --> 03:11:04.084
THE PRESIDENT WHO, AT THE TIME 
SAID, THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE

03:11:04.293 --> 03:11:08.702
ON BOTH SIDES. NOW, WHERE ARE WE
THREE YEARS LATER? I WOULD ARGUE

03:11:09.869 --> 03:11:13.369
THAT WE ARE NOT JUST BACK WHERE 
WE WERE. I WOULD ARGUE THAT 

03:11:13.573 --> 03:11:20.990
THINGS ARE WORSE. IN 2017, IT 
WAS THAT UNFATHOMABLE TO MOST OF

03:11:21.193 --> 03:11:23.193
US TO THINK THAT CHARLOTTESVILLE
COULD HAPPEN

03:11:28.774 --> 03:11:31.467
.  JUST AS IT WAS UNFATHOMABLE 
TO MOST OF US THAT THE CAPITOL 

03:11:31.668 --> 03:11:34.145
COULD HAVE BEEN BREACHED ON 
JANUARY 6. FRANKLY , WHAT 

03:11:34.285 --> 03:11:37.780
UNFATHOMABLE OARS AWAIT US IF WE
DO NOT STAND UP NOW AND SAY NO, 

03:11:37.994 --> 03:11:43.029
THIS IS NOT AMERICA. WE WILL NOT
JUST EXPRESS CONDOLENCES AND 

03:11:43.169 --> 03:11:46.652
DENUNCIATIONS. WE WILL NOT JUST 
CLOSE THE BOOK AND TRY TO MOVE 

03:11:46.854 --> 03:11:52.317
ON. WE WILL ACT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

03:12:08.376 --> 03:12:13.783
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPRESENTATIVES WILL NOW COME
TO SHOW THE DAMAGE DONE TO 

03:12:13.985 --> 03:12:15.985
CONGRESS AND OUR DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS.

03:12:20.824 --> 03:12:22.824
MR. CICILLINE .

03:12:35.580 --> 03:12:39.020
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT AND DISTINGUISH
SENATORS, WE JUST HEARD FROM MY 

03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:41.160
COLLEAGUE

03:12:45.274 --> 03:12:47.477
,  REP DEGETTE TALK ABOUT HOW 
DONALD TRUMP 

03:12:51.231 --> 03:12:53.235
INCREASED THREATS TO OUR 
SECURITY AND EMBOLDENED DOMESTIC

03:12:53.377 --> 03:12:56.810
EXTREMISTS. I WOULD LIKE TO NOW 
TURN TO THE HARM THAT WAS CAUSED

03:12:57.012 --> 03:13:01.334
HERE, INSIDE THESE WALLS, AS A 
RESULT OF THE CONDUCT ON JANUARY

03:13:01.537 --> 03:13:04.429
6. THE HARM TO US AND TO 
CONGRESS AND TO THOSE WHO SERVE 

03:13:05.196 --> 03:13:08.594
OUR COUNTRY. TO THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES AS 

03:13:09.189 --> 03:13:14.749
TRUMP MOB TRIED TO STOP THE 
ELECTION CERTIFICATION PROCESS. 

03:13:14.953 --> 03:13:20.336
THE ATTACK ON JANUARY 6 IS ONE 
OF THE BLOODIEST INTRUSIONS OF 

03:13:20.541 --> 03:13:22.541
THE CAPITOL SINCE THE 

03:13:25.251 --> 03:13:27.725
BRITISH INVASION IN THE WAR OF 
1812 AND THEY BURNED IT TO THE 

03:13:27.928 --> 03:13:30.073
GROUND. YOU HAVE HEARD IN 
PAINSTAKING DETAIL

03:13:37.628 --> 03:13:39.628
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S MOB POSED 
AN IMMEDIATE AND SERIOUS THREAT 

03:13:39.701 --> 03:13:41.323
TO THE CONTINUITY AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL SUCCESSION OF THE

03:13:41.324 --> 03:13:44.623
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THE 
FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD IN LINE 

03:13:44.837 --> 03:13:46.884
TO THE PRESIDENCY. THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE,

03:13:47.086 --> 03:13:49.086
PRESIDENT PRO TEM

03:13:53.219 --> 03:13:55.307
, ALTOGETHER FACED A COMMON 
THREAT IN THE SAME LOCATION. WE 

03:13:55.521 --> 03:13:57.521
HAVE SEEN THE FIRST AND THE 
SECOND WERE PURPOSELY TARGETED 

03:13:57.581 --> 03:14:00.435
BY THESE ATTACKERS. THESE WERE 
NOT IDLE THREATS. THE MOB, AS 

03:14:00.637 --> 03:14:05.364
YOU HAVE HEARD, CHANTED, HANG 
MIKE PENCE. 

03:14:05.365 --> 03:14:13.960
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [ CROWD CHANTING ]. HANG MIKE

03:14:13.961 --> 03:14:15.961
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:14:18.350 --> 03:14:20.350
THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD'VE 
KILLED VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE

03:14:20.424 --> 03:14:24.461
AND SPEAKER PELOSI, IF THEY HAD 
FOUND THEM. DON BANCROFT AND 

03:14:24.597 --> 03:14:27.090
DIANE SANTOS SMITH WERE TWO OF 
THE WRITERS

03:14:32.971 --> 03:14:34.971
CAUGHT ON TAPE DISCUSSING THE 
BRUTAL VIOLENCE THEY HOPE TO 

03:14:35.054 --> 03:14:37.677
INFLICT ON SPEAKER PELOSI HAD 
SHE NOT BEEN RUSHED OUT TO 

03:14:37.816 --> 03:14:40.212
SAFETY.  THEY SAID QUOTE, WE 
BROKE INTO THE CAPITOL AND WE 

03:14:40.413 --> 03:14:43.092
GOT INSIDE AND WE DID OUR PART .
WE WERE LOOKING FOR NANCY TO 

03:14:43.294 --> 03:14:46.920
SHOOT HER IN THE FREAKING BRAIN,
BUT WE DIDN'T FIND HER,". 

03:14:47.052 --> 03:14:52.889
SENATORS, SIMPLY PUT, THIS MOB 
WAS TRYING TO OVERTHROW OUR 

03:14:53.068 --> 03:14:57.269
GOVERNMENT. THEY CAME PERILOUSLY
CLOSE TO REACHING THE FIRST 

03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:59.957
THREE PEOPLE IN LINE TO THE 
PRESIDENCY. IT WASN'T JUST THE 

03:15:00.172 --> 03:15:02.172
VICE PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER

03:15:05.124 --> 03:15:07.227
, THE RIOTERS WERE PREPARED TO 
ATTACK ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS 

03:15:07.441 --> 03:15:12.383
THEY FOUND. THOMAS EDWARD 
CALDWELL AND DONNA BURKE KROLL 

03:15:12.587 --> 03:15:16.087
AND JESSICA MARIE WATKINS, 
COALITION MEMBERS WERE ALSO 

03:15:16.287 --> 03:15:20.379
CHARGED IN THE ROLE OF THE 
ATTACK. THEY TALKED ABOUT 

03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:24.513
TRAPPING US IN THE UNDERGROUND 
TUNNELS. THERE WAS SOCIAL MEDIA 

03:15:25.263 --> 03:15:27.263
CHATTER WITH

03:15:30.877 --> 03:15:32.954
QUOTE, ALL MEMBERS ARE IN THE 
TUNNEL UNDER THE CAPITOL. SEAL 

03:15:33.170 --> 03:15:37.897
THEM IN AND TURN ON THE GAS . 
ALL LEGISLATORS ARE IN THE 

03:15:38.111 --> 03:15:40.597
TUNNELS THREE FLOORS DOWN. DO 
WHAT WE DID WHEN I WAS IN THE 

03:15:40.799 --> 03:15:43.251
CORPS AND START TEARING OUT THE 
FLOORS AND GO FROM TOP TO 

03:15:43.456 --> 03:15:48.176
BOTTOM,". NEVER DID ANY OF US 
IMAGINE THAT WE OR OUR 

03:15:48.391 --> 03:15:51.940
COLLEAGUES WOULD FACE MORTAL 
PERIL BY A MOB RILED UP BY THE 

03:15:52.153 --> 03:15:55.614
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. 

03:15:55.815 --> 03:16:02.185
BUT, WE DID. ALL BECAUSE DONALD 
TRUMP COULD NOT ACCEPT ELECTION 

03:16:02.321 --> 03:16:10.004
DEFEAT. TRUMP CHOSE HIMSELF 
ABOVE THE PEOPLE AND ABOVE OUR 

03:16:10.148 --> 03:16:14.075
INSTITUTIONS AND ABOVE OUR 
DEMOCRACY. ABOVE ALL OF YOU

03:16:20.365 --> 03:16:23.059
. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HEARD TRUMP 
A SPOUSE FOR TWO YEARS NOW THIS 

03:16:23.263 --> 03:16:26.266
AMERICA FIRST POLICY. BUT, HIS 
TRUE NORTH STAR IS NOT AMERICA'S

03:16:26.414 --> 03:16:31.459
WELL-BEING. IT IS NOT COUNTRY 
FIRST LIKE OUR DEAR DEPARTED 

03:16:31.659 --> 03:16:37.366
COLLEAGUE, JOHN McCAIN. HIS IS 
TRUMP FIRST. NO MATTER THE COST 

03:16:37.785 --> 03:16:42.093
AND NO MATTER THE THREAT TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY. BUT, EACH AND EVERY 

03:16:42.299 --> 03:16:48.380
ONE OF US IN THIS ROOM MUST 
AGREE ON ONE THING. WE CAN NEVER

03:16:48.529 --> 03:16:54.830
ALLOW THE KIND OF VIOLENT ATTACK
THAT OCCURRED ON JANUARY 6 TO 

03:16:55.031 --> 03:16:58.483
EVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN THIS 
COUNTRY. IN THE IMMEDIATE 

03:16:58.623 --> 03:17:00.623
AFTERMATH

03:17:03.263 --> 03:17:05.135
, WE HEARD REALLY DISTURBING 
ACCOUNTS FROM MEMBERS OF 

03:17:05.136 --> 03:17:07.018
CONGRESS ABOUT WHAT THEY 
EXPERIENCED THAT DAY. HERE ARE 

03:17:07.019 --> 03:17:09.019
SOME OF THOSE REACTIONS

03:17:17.069 --> 03:17:18.517
. FOLLOWING THE ATTACK, 
REPRESENTATIVE DUSTY JOHNSON 

03:17:18.518 --> 03:17:20.570
EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT WE HAD 
GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE SO 

03:17:20.772 --> 03:17:23.066
MANY OF US HAD SOWN THE SEEDS OF
ANGER AND DIVISION. 

03:17:23.067 --> 03:17:25.964
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WERE BARRICADED AND THERE 
WAS SOME FEAR, TO BE SURE. 

03:17:26.147 --> 03:17:28.609
OVERWHELMINGLY, THE EMOTION I 
EXPERIENCED WAS ONE OF ANGER. I 

03:17:28.810 --> 03:17:32.084
CANNOT BELIEVE THIS WAS 
HAPPENING. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE 

03:17:32.294 --> 03:17:36.829
HAD GOTTEN TO THIS POINT WHERE 
SO MANY OF US HAD SOWN THE SEEDS

03:17:37.045 --> 03:17:41.390
OF ANGER AND OF DIVISION AND WE 
HAD BUILT A POWDER CAKE. REALLY,

03:17:41.591 --> 03:17:45.933
WE WERE STARTING TO SEE THE 
POWDER KEG LIGHT UP. FRANKLY, I 

03:17:46.694 --> 03:17:48.694
WAS FURIOUS.

03:17:51.659 --> 03:17:54.149
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REP JASON CROW COMPARED THE 
EVENTS OF THIS DAY TO HIS TIME 

03:17:54.561 --> 03:17:58.081
AND HAVE ANNA STAN AS AN ARMY 
RANGER, SOMETHING SENATOR REID 

03:17:58.297 --> 03:18:00.297
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT

03:18:04.499 --> 03:18:06.351
.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT I FELT IN THE CAPITOL 

03:18:06.352 --> 03:18:08.634
BEHIND US IS SOMETHING I HAVE 
NOT FELT SINCE I WAS IN 

03:18:08.848 --> 03:18:11.880
AFGHANISTAN AS AN ARMY RANGER . 
TO THINK THAT IS A MEMBER OF 

03:18:12.015 --> 03:18:15.694
CONGRESS IN 2021 IN THE U.S. 
CAPITOL AND ON THE HOUSE FLOOR, 

03:18:15.895 --> 03:18:18.335
I WAS PREPARING TO FIGHT MY WAY 
OUT OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE 

03:18:18.478 --> 03:18:21.616
AGAINST A MOB IS BEYOND 
TROUBLING. 

03:18:21.617 --> 03:18:23.617
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:18:29.087 --> 03:18:30.928
REPRESENTATIVE PAT FALLON WAS 
HUMBLED BY HIS EXPERIENCE ON 

03:18:30.929 --> 03:18:32.929
JANUARY 6 AND DESCRIBED THE 
EVENTS AS SURREAL AS THEY 

03:18:32.978 --> 03:18:36.293
UNFOLDED IN THE CAPITOL . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

03:18:36.294 --> 03:18:39.756
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS SOMETHING I NEVER 
THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IN THE 

03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:41.889
NATION'S CAPITOL 

03:18:52.928 --> 03:18:55.421
. IT WAS THE BRAVERY AND COURAGE
OF FELLOW MEMBERS. WITH THE MOB 

03:18:55.624 --> 03:18:57.894
BANGING ON THE DOORS AND ALL 
THAT KEPT THEM FROM REACHING THE

03:18:58.097 --> 03:19:03.814
CHAMBER ITSELF WAS THE DOORS AND
THEN SOME FURNITURE WE HAD MOVED

03:19:05.505 --> 03:19:09.411
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO TONY GONZALEZ, THE 

03:19:09.616 --> 03:19:12.286
FRESHMAN REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
TEXAS AND MARKWAYNE MULLIN 

03:19:13.045 --> 03:19:17.858
STEPPED IN. WE BROKE OFF 
FURNITURE. SOME OF THE HAND 

03:19:18.060 --> 03:19:20.060
SANITIZER STATIONS ARE ON THESE

03:19:23.424 --> 03:19:25.876
BIG WOODEN POLES. WE TURNED THEM
UPSIDE DOWN AND WE WERE READY TO

03:19:26.091 --> 03:19:28.894
ACTUALLY HAVE TO STREET FIGHT IN
THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND IT WAS 

03:19:29.037 --> 03:19:31.037
UNBELIEVABLE.

03:19:35.963 --> 03:19:38.051
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MANY MEMBERS, THAT DAY, 
WONDERED IF THEY WOULD SEE THEIR

03:19:38.251 --> 03:19:41.121
FAMILIES AGAIN. THEY WERE 
OUTNUMBERED AND TRAPPED INSIDE. 

03:19:41.336 --> 03:19:43.336
THEY WERE CALLING LOVED ONES TO 
SAY GOODBYE.

03:19:47.569 --> 03:19:49.569
LISTEN TO HOW ONE REPRESENTATIVE
DESCRIBED THE IMPACT OF THE 

03:19:49.635 --> 03:19:51.283
RIOT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR 

03:19:51.284 --> 03:19:56.004
TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, PROTECT 
MYSELF BEHIND THIS LITTLE WALL. 

03:19:56.182 --> 03:19:58.745
WE ALL TOOK OUR PINS OFF BECAUSE

03:20:03.980 --> 03:20:05.980
WE WERE CERTAIN THAT

03:20:09.593 --> 03:20:12.078
IF THE MOB CAME IN THAT THEY 
WOULD IDENTIFY US AS MEMBERS OF 

03:20:12.294 --> 03:20:16.388
CONGRESS. I CALLED MY WIFE AND, 
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T UNTIL I 

03:20:16.590 --> 03:20:20.742
HEARD HER VOICE THAT I THOUGHT, 
WOW, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CALLS 

03:20:20.955 --> 03:20:26.182
THAT PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE MOST COVERAGE

03:20:29.984 --> 03:20:32.084
FOCUSED ON THE EXTREME DANGER 
POSED TO THE MEMBERS AND THE 

03:20:32.283 --> 03:20:34.283
CAPITOL POLICE 

03:20:37.231 --> 03:20:39.465
,  WHO WERE TARGETS OF THIS 
ATTACK, THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE 

03:20:39.666 --> 03:20:44.569
IN THE CAPITOL WORKING ON 
JANUARY 6 AS WELL . PERSONAL AID

03:20:44.784 --> 03:20:46.784
AND EMPLOYEES AND FOOD SERVICE 
WORKERS. WE CANNOT FORGET ALL 

03:20:46.871 --> 03:20:48.952
THE PEOPLE IN HARMS WAY THAT 
DAY. THESE EMPLOYEES EXPERIENCED

03:20:49.575 --> 03:20:55.514
TRAUMA. SOME COWARD HIDING IN 
PLACES FEET AWAY FROM WHERE THIS

03:20:55.719 --> 03:20:58.246
CROWD HAD ASSEMBLED. MANY WOULD 
JUST

03:21:05.105 --> 03:21:07.105
KIDS THAT WERE TWENTYSOMETHING 
WHO CAME TO WORK BECAUSE THEY 

03:21:07.168 --> 03:21:09.264
BELIEVED IN THEIR COUNTRY AND 
THEY BELIEVED IN WORKING TO MAKE

03:21:09.466 --> 03:21:11.466
IT BETTER. OTHERS WERE DEDICATED
FOOD SERVICE WORKERS WHO WERE 

03:21:12.098 --> 03:21:15.892
WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE WE CAN
COME HERE AND DO OUR JOBS. THESE

03:21:16.107 --> 03:21:20.006
WORKERS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THEY 

03:21:20.761 --> 03:21:27.197
DESERVED BETTER. YOU HAVE HEARD 
FROM SPEAKER PELOSI'S STAFF THAT

03:21:27.402 --> 03:21:29.669
WAS HIDING UNDER THE CONFERENCE 
TABLE AND COWERING IN THE DARK, 

03:21:29.872 --> 03:21:33.793
MAKING SURE THE ATTACKERS COULD 
NOT HEAR THEM. I WOULD LIKE TO 

03:21:33.994 --> 03:21:38.305
SHARE WITH OTHER STAFFERS WENT 
THROUGH. LISTEN AS TWO STAFFERS 

03:21:38.507 --> 03:21:41.359
RECALL WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED 
THAT DAY. 

03:21:41.360 --> 03:21:43.360
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:21:46.592 --> 03:21:49.087
WE WERE SEEN ON TWITTER AND ON 
OUR PHONES AND HEARING FROM SOME

03:21:49.289 --> 03:21:52.163
OF THE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE 
FLOOR THAT THE BUILDING HAD BEEN

03:21:52.300 --> 03:21:57.361
BREACHED. BUILDING BREACHED WERE
TWO WORDS I HAD NEVER HEARD. 

03:21:57.577 --> 03:22:02.698
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS PARTICULARLY 
STRESSFUL. BEING IN A ROOM THAT 

03:22:02.898 --> 03:22:07.425
WAS CLOSE TO WHERE THINGS WERE 
HAPPENING AND NOT REALLY KNOWING

03:22:07.625 --> 03:22:13.383
WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND SEEING 
IT COME IN LIVE AND GETTING 

03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:19.914
TEXTS FROM PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, ARE
YOU OKAY? TRUTHFULLY, I DIDN'T 

03:22:20.049 --> 03:22:23.769
KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I HEARD
SHOTS FIRED

03:22:27.438 --> 03:22:30.207
, SHOTS FIRED, SHOW ME YOUR 
HANDS, SHOW ME YOUR HANDS. THEN,

03:22:31.367 --> 03:22:36.893
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE RIGHT
OUTSIDE OR IF THEY WERE LOTS OF 

03:22:37.093 --> 03:22:40.281
PEOPLE WITH WEAPONS. IF THERE 
WAS ONE SHOOTER OR

03:22:47.195 --> 03:22:49.646
-- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKED 
LIKE. I JUST KNOW THAT SHOTS 

03:22:49.848 --> 03:22:51.299
WERE FIRED OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE 
CHAMBER. 

03:22:51.300 --> 03:22:56.437
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ACCORDING TO REPORTS, ONE 
REPUBLICAN SENATE STAFFER WHOSE 

03:22:56.637 --> 03:23:00.369
OFFICE WAS NOT FAR FROM THE 
FLOOR, QUOTE, TOOK A STEEL ROD 

03:23:00.572 --> 03:23:03.658
AND BARRICADED HIS DOOR AS 
WRITERS BANGED ON THE DOOR, 

03:23:03.861 --> 03:23:05.861
TRYING TO BREAK IN. THE NEW YORK

03:23:12.271 --> 03:23:14.271
TIMES REPORTED A SENIOR BLACK 
STAFFER WAS LOCKED DOWN DURING 

03:23:14.354 --> 03:23:16.007
SIX HOURS DURING THE 
INSURRECTION AND WAS SO 

03:23:16.008 --> 03:23:18.008
DISTURBED ABOUT THESE EVENTS 
THAT SHE QUIT HER JOB. ANOTHER 

03:23:18.066 --> 03:23:20.535
STAFFER WHO WAS ON THE FLOOR OF 
THE HOUSE THAT DAY DESCRIBED 

03:23:20.748 --> 03:23:26.968
WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6 STILL
ECHOES IN HIS MIND. LISTEN TO 

03:23:27.183 --> 03:23:29.327
HIM DESCRIBE THE MOMENTS JUST 
BEFORE THIS INDELIBLE IMAGE.

03:23:32.908 --> 03:23:39.311
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HEARD GLASS BREAK AND I 
COULD SEE THE WINDOWPANES ON THE

03:23:39.529 --> 03:23:41.529
MAIN DOOR START TO POP.

03:23:45.077 --> 03:23:47.317
I FIGURED THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY 
WERE AT THE DOOR AND IT FIGURED 

03:23:47.521 --> 03:23:49.811
OUT A WAY TO BREAK THE GLASS. 
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER, 

03:23:50.014 --> 03:23:54.797
BEFORE I WALKED OFF THE FLOOR, 
WAS SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS HAD 

03:23:55.015 --> 03:23:57.625
DRAWN THEIR GUNS AND HAD THEIR 
GUNS TRAINED ON THE DOOR. 

03:23:57.767 --> 03:24:01.604
CLEARLY, I DIDN'T THINK THERE 
WAS ANYTHING ELSE I COULD DO AND

03:24:01.805 --> 03:24:05.892
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE FOR 
WHATEVER WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR. SO,

03:24:06.108 --> 03:24:09.115
I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS 
AND THE STAIRWAY WAS PRETTY 

03:24:09.256 --> 03:24:11.256
PACKED

03:24:12.659 --> 03:24:15.334
. AT THAT POINT, I DON'T KNOW IF
IT WAS A POLICE OFFICER OR 

03:24:15.534 --> 03:24:18.063
SOMEBODY ELSE WHO SAID, THEY ARE
RIGHT BEHIND US, RUN. 

03:24:18.064 --> 03:24:22.104
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT I THINK ABOUT AND THERE 
IS IN A DAY THAT HASN'T GONE BY 

03:24:22.306 --> 03:24:24.561
SINCE JANUARY 6 THAT AT SOME 
POINT I HAVEN'T GONE BACK AND 

03:24:24.774 --> 03:24:26.774
PICKED AT SOME LITTLE THING. 
BUT, THE SOUND OF THOSE 

03:24:27.410 --> 03:24:32.476
WINDOWPANES POPPING. YOU KNOW, I
WON'T FORGET THAT SOUND.

03:24:35.909 --> 03:24:37.909
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WON'T FORGET THAT SOUND.

03:24:41.266 --> 03:24:45.188
HOW LONG WILL THE SOUND OF 
WINDOWPANES BREAKING HOT THIS 

03:24:45.389 --> 03:24:49.713
STAFFER? HE IS NOT ALONE. THERE 
ARE COUNTLESS PEOPLE LIVING WITH

03:24:49.914 --> 03:24:55.647
THE TRAUMA OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT
DAY.  THIS INCLUDES, BY THE WAY,

03:24:55.849 --> 03:25:01.218
ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH US 
IN THE CAPITOL THAT DAY . THAT 

03:25:01.436 --> 03:25:03.436
IS THE PRESS. THEY WERE IN 
DANGER, PARTICULARLY AFTER YEARS

03:25:03.484 --> 03:25:05.484
OF BEING DERIDED BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AS FAKE NEWS. KRISTEN 

03:25:05.542 --> 03:25:07.542
WILSON, REPORTER FOR CNN

03:25:11.115 --> 03:25:13.176
, RECENTLY TWEETED ABOUT HER 
EXPERIENCE. SHE SAID, I HAVE 14 

03:25:13.379 --> 03:25:15.430
PEOPLE ON MY TEAM AND WE WERE 
SCATTERED EVERYWHERE. TWO OF 

03:25:15.633 --> 03:25:18.309
THEM WERE ON CRUTCHES AND COULD 
NOT HAVE RUN IF THEY HAD TO. THE

03:25:18.524 --> 03:25:20.524
HAD TO ANYWAY

03:25:24.690 --> 03:25:27.380
. ONE WAS TRAPPED IN THE HOUSE 
CHAMBER AND HAD TO CRAWL OUT TO 

03:25:27.582 --> 03:25:29.637
HIDE. FOUR OF US BARRICADED 
OURSELVES IN A ROOM OFF THE 

03:25:29.992 --> 03:25:32.073
SENATE CHAMBER. EVERY BANG ON 
THE DOOR OF THEM TRYING TO COME 

03:25:32.274 --> 03:25:34.589
THROUGH, I CAN STILL HEAR IN MY 
HEAD.  THE JANITORIAL AND 

03:25:34.791 --> 03:25:39.550
CUSTODIAL STAFF AT THE CAPITOL ,
THE PEOPLE WHO DAY AFTER DAY 

03:25:39.766 --> 03:25:41.836
ATTEND TO OUR HOME AWAY FROM 
HOME WERE ALSO TRAUMATIZED. WE 

03:25:42.048 --> 03:25:44.612
DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM AND THE 
HARM THEY SUFFERED OFTEN ENOUGH

03:25:48.856 --> 03:25:50.856
. ONE JANITORIAL WORKER 
RECOUNTED THAT HE WAS SO SCARED 

03:25:50.942 --> 03:25:53.203
THAT HE HAD TO HIDE IN THE 
CLOSET DURING THE ATTACK. HE 

03:25:53.404 --> 03:25:56.495
SAID, I WAS ALL BY MYSELF AND I 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON,".

03:25:56.702 --> 03:26:01.046
ANOTHER EMPLOYEE, A MOTHER OF 
THREE, SAID THE INSURRECTION 

03:26:01.248 --> 03:26:03.411
SHATTERED ALL MY A SENSE OF 
SECURITY AT WORK

03:26:06.606 --> 03:26:08.920
.  AN EMPLOYEE AT THE CAPITOL 
SAID, I HOPE NOTHING ELSE 

03:26:09.124 --> 03:26:11.124
HAPPENS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT  KILLING US. 

03:26:11.223 --> 03:26:13.223
KILLING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND 
KILLING POLICE

03:26:16.172 --> 03:26:17.397
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WAS AFRAID 

03:26:17.398 --> 03:26:21.340
TO WORK ON INAUGURATION DAY AND 
SAID, I HONESTLY FEAR FOR MY 

03:26:21.540 --> 03:26:23.540
LIFE. I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AT 
HOME."

03:26:29.345 --> 03:26:31.030
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FOR MANY OF THE BLACK AND 

03:26:31.031 --> 03:26:33.102
BROWN STAFF, THE TRAUMA WAS MADE
WORSE BY THE MANY PAINFUL 

03:26:33.316 --> 03:26:35.363
SYMBOLS OF HATE THAT WERE ON 
FULL DISPLAY THAT DAY. THE 

03:26:35.578 --> 03:26:40.488
INSURRECTIONIST WAIVED 
CONFEDERATE FLAGS AND HURLED 

03:26:40.691 --> 03:26:42.550
DISGUSTING RACIAL SLUR'S A 
DEDICATED CAPITOL WORKERS . 

03:26:42.551 --> 03:26:48.339
THEN, AFTER ALL OF THAT, THE 
SAME WORKERS, MANY OF THEM 

03:26:48.745 --> 03:26:52.484
PEOPLE OF COLOR, WERE FORCED TO 
CLEAN UP THE MAST LEFT BY MOBS 

03:26:52.699 --> 03:26:56.854
OF WHITE NATIONALISTS. ONE 
MEMBER OF THE JANITORIAL STAFF 

03:26:57.260 --> 03:27:00.346
EXPRESSED HOW TERRIBLE HE FELT 
WHEN HE HAD TO CLEAN UP PCs THAT

03:27:00.547 --> 03:27:04.246
HAD BEEN SMEARED ON THE WALL. 
THE BLOOD OF A RIDER WHO HAD 

03:27:04.449 --> 03:27:08.406
DIED AND BROKEN GLASS AND OTHER 
OBJECTS STREWN ALL OVER THE 

03:27:08.619 --> 03:27:11.658
FLOOR. HE SAID, I FELT BAD AND 
DEGRADED.

03:27:16.388 --> 03:27:21.306
LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT THIS 
VIOLENT ATTACK HAPPENED IN THE 

03:27:21.521 --> 03:27:23.521
MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC

03:27:28.312 --> 03:27:29.951
. SOCIAL DISTANCING WAS 
IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE WERE 

03:27:29.952 --> 03:27:32.551
HIDING FOR OUR LIVES IN CRAMPED 
QUARTERS FOR LONG PERIODS OF 

03:27:32.694 --> 03:27:34.694
TIME

03:27:35.892 --> 03:27:38.138

03:27:40.905 --> 03:27:42.905
38 CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS HAVE 
TESTED POSITIVE OR HAVE BEEN 

03:27:43.045 --> 03:27:48.540

03:27:48.743 --> 03:27:53.298
NATION'S CAPITOL PROVIDE ALL OF 
US PROTECTION, HAVE TESTED 

03:27:53.499 --> 03:27:55.561
POSITIVE. THE CAPITOL POLICE AND
NATIONAL GUARD  CAME HERE TO 

03:27:55.762 --> 03:27:59.317
KEEP US SAFE AND TO SERVE. THEY 
PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER AND 

03:27:59.518 --> 03:28:06.019
THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS, 
WE ALL DO. THAT BRINGS ME TO THE

03:28:06.163 --> 03:28:08.163
NEXT ARM.

03:28:12.254 --> 03:28:14.902
ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM MADE IT 
OUT ALIVE, BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS 

03:28:15.658 --> 03:28:18.241
SO LUCKY. THREE LAW-ENFORCEMENT

THE ATTACK ON JANUARY 6. THE 
FORMER CAPITAL POLICE CHIEF SON

03:30:41.181 --> 03:30:43.411
DESCRIBES IT AS VIOLENT UNLIKE 
ANYTHING HE HAD SEEN IN HIS 30 

03:30:43.626 --> 03:30:48.696
YEAR CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
DC POLICE CHIEF HAD SPOKEN TO AN

03:30:48.896 --> 03:30:52.913
OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN BEATEN AND 
INJURED WITH A STUN GUN SAID 

03:30:53.060 --> 03:30:56.211
QUOTE, I HAVE TALKED WITH 
OFFICERS WHO HAVE DONE TWO TOURS

03:30:56.973 --> 03:31:00.558
IN IRAQ SAID THIS WAS SCARY TO 
THEM AND THEIR TIME IN COMBAT.

03:31:04.743 --> 03:31:07.741
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS NOT 
THE ONLY THING THEY WILL HAVE A 

03:31:07.947 --> 03:31:09.947
LASTING EFFECT ON OUR BRAVE 
OFFICERS.

03:31:14.093 --> 03:31:18.307

LOYALTY AND CALL THEM TRADER, , 
UN-AMERICAN FOR PROTECTING US.  

03:31:26.477 --> 03:31:32.177
I WRITER WEARING A HUNTING 
JACKET A COSTS A POLICE OFFICER.

03:31:57.776 --> 03:32:02.332
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LISTEN TO HOW THE TRUMP MOB 
SPOKE TO THESE OFFICERS.

03:32:06.508 --> 03:32:09.757
YOU HEARD THAT WITH YOUR OWN 
EARS. 

03:32:40.182 --> 03:32:48.553
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EFFING TRADER. SO MUCH FOR 
BACKING THE BLUE APPEARED HERE 

03:32:48.753 --> 03:32:50.753
ARE A COUPLE MORE EXAMPLES.

03:33:33.650 --> 03:33:39.335
THEY CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS TRADERS TRAITORS. YOU 

03:33:39.535 --> 03:33:45.582
HAVE TO WONDER WHO THESE RIDERS 
ARE SWORN TO, WHO DO THEY 

03:33:45.736 --> 03:33:49.083
BELIEVE THE POLICE OWE THEIR 
LOYALTY, THE PEOPLE OR 

03:33:49.498 --> 03:33:52.024
CONSTITUTION OR DEMOCRACY OR TO 
DONALD TRUMP?

03:33:58.020 --> 03:34:00.054
EVEN THOSE WHO ARE NOT OUTWARDLY
INJURED, THE MENTAL TOLL HAS 

03:34:00.816 --> 03:34:02.816
BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

03:34:04.934 --> 03:34:06.350
SEVERAL CAPITAL POLICE OFFICERS 
HAVE REPORTEDLY THREATENED 

03:34:06.351 --> 03:34:08.351
SELF-HARM IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING 
THE RIGHT.

03:34:12.035 --> 03:34:14.483
IN ONE CASE AN OFFICER TURNED IN
HER GUN BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID 

03:34:14.683 --> 03:34:16.683
OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. BLACK 
POLICE OFFICERS WERE MET WITH 

03:34:17.277 --> 03:34:22.283
BRACES VITRIOL. YOU HEARD REP. 
JAMIE RASKIN, REFERENCES A  

03:34:22.601 --> 03:34:28.286
BLACK POLICE OFFICER, WEARY FROM
RACIALIZED VIOLENCE, TEARS JUST 

03:34:28.487 --> 03:34:34.127
STARTED STREAMING DOWN MY FACE, 
I SAID WHAT IS THIS, IS THIS 

03:34:34.272 --> 03:34:36.272
AMERICA?

03:34:38.034 --> 03:34:43.680
IS THIS AMERICA? WHAT IS YOUR 
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, IS THIS 

03:34:43.826 --> 03:34:49.819
OKAY? IF NOT, WHAT ARE WE GOING 
TO DO ABOUT APPEARED THESE 

03:34:50.586 --> 03:34:56.934
PEOPLE MATTER. THESE PEOPLE 
RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR US. SO I 

03:34:57.135 --> 03:35:02.216
ASK YOU RESPECTFULLY TO CONSIDER
THEM, THE POLICE OFFICERS, THE 

03:35:02.417 --> 03:35:04.650
STAFF OF THIS BUILDING WHEN YOU 
CAST YOUR VOTE. THESE PEOPLE ARE

03:35:05.411 --> 03:35:11.551
IN DEEP PAIN BECAUSE A SHORT 
APPEAR TO SERVE THE AMERICAN 

03:35:11.765 --> 03:35:14.084
PEOPLE AND SERVE THEIR 
GOVERNMENT AND SERVE ALL OF US.

03:35:20.083 --> 03:35:22.530
CAST YOUR VOTE AND WE HONOR THEM
AND REMEMBER THEM AND ACT IN 

03:35:22.731 --> 03:35:27.800
SERVICE OF THEM AS THEY DESERVE.
I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FOR

03:35:28.014 --> 03:35:31.265
INSURRECTIONIST WHO ALSO LOST 
THEIR LIVES DURING THE ATTACK. 

03:35:31.668 --> 03:35:33.901
THESE PEOPLE WERE LED HERE BY 
THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF AN 

03:35:34.101 --> 03:35:37.765
INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE THEM BELIEVE
THAT THEY WERE PATRIOTS. 

03:35:43.244 --> 03:35:46.903
THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE IS OF 
COURSE THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL. 

03:35:47.305 --> 03:35:51.771
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY DAMAGE
BROUGHT THAT DAY. THE TRUMP MOB 

03:35:51.972 --> 03:35:57.613
ALSO DAMAGED THIS BUILDING. THEY
DEFILED SOME OF THE MOST SACRED 

03:35:57.753 --> 03:36:03.082
PLACES, STATUARY HALL, THE 
ROTUNDA, SOME OF THE AMERICA'S 

03:36:03.230 --> 03:36:05.230
GREATEST

03:36:06.812 --> 03:36:08.629
CHAMPIONS, CIVIL RIGHTS HEROES 
AND OTHER DEFENDERS WERE HONORED

03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:12.495
AFTER THEIR DEATH. TRUMPS A 
VIOLENT MOB HAD LITTLE RESPECT 

03:36:12.696 --> 03:36:18.378
FOR THIS PLACE. THIS VIDEO SHOWS
THE WRECKAGE LEFT IN THE SENATE 

03:36:19.351 --> 03:36:22.443
PARLIAMENTARIAN'S OFFICE BY THE 
INSURRECTIONIST. 

03:36:47.386 --> 03:36:50.979
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A BUST OF PRESIDENT ZACHARY

03:36:56.976 --> 03:36:59.009
TAYLOR WAS SMEARED WITH WHAT 
APPEARED TO BE BLOOD. AN EMPTY 

03:36:59.209 --> 03:37:01.245
PICTURE FRAME ROBBED OF ITS 
CONTENTS WAS FOUND ON THE FLOOR.

03:37:01.451 --> 03:37:03.451
IT IS OF THE INSURRECTION 
CAPTURED ONE MAN STEALING A 

03:37:04.035 --> 03:37:07.949
FRAMED PHOTO AND ANOTHER ONE 
TEARING A SCROLL FROM THE WALL 

03:37:08.145 --> 03:37:10.178
AND RIPPING IT UP AND THROWING 
THOSE PIECES ON THE FLOOR. 

03:37:10.378 --> 03:37:12.378
ASSIGN PAYING TRIBUTE TO

03:37:15.259 --> 03:37:17.259
JOHN LEWIS WAS ALSO SHAMEFULLY 
DESTROYED AND ONLY A BROKEN 

03:37:17.293 --> 03:37:21.559
PIECE OF THE MEMORIAL WAS FOUND 
ON THE GROUND NEXT TO A TRASH 

03:37:21.759 --> 03:37:27.860
CAN. THE PHOTO OF MR. LEWIS WAS 
GONE. THE DAMAGE DONE TO THIS 

03:37:28.060 --> 03:37:30.693
BUILDING IS A STAIN ON ALL OF US
AND ON THE DIGNITY OF OUR 

03:37:30.895 --> 03:37:36.180
DEMOCRACY. THE ATTACK WE SAW HAD
A PURPOSE, STOP THE 

03:37:36.380 --> 03:37:38.827
CERTIFICATION, STOP THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. FORTUNATELY 

03:37:39.026 --> 03:37:46.543
THEY DID NOT PREVAIL. NEWSPAPERS
ACROSS AMERICA, JANUARY 21, THE 

03:37:46.744 --> 03:37:50.555
DAY AFTER THE INAUGURATION, 
PROCLAIMED DEMOCRACY HAS 

03:37:50.701 --> 03:37:52.701
PREVAILED.

03:37:54.875 --> 03:37:56.692
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THAT IN HIS
INAUGURATION SPEECH. THE 

03:37:56.693 --> 03:38:01.977
HEADLINE WAS IN SO MANY PLACES 
BECAUSE THE WORLD'S OLDEST 

03:38:02.178 --> 03:38:03.808
CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND THE
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING IT HAD 

03:38:03.809 --> 03:38:06.646
BEEN ATTACKED AND CHALLENGED. 
THIS WASN'T JUST AN ATTACK ON 

03:38:06.847 --> 03:38:08.847
THE CAPITOL BUILDING

03:38:12.744 --> 03:38:15.178
, THE DEDICATED PEOPLE INSIDE, 
IT WAS AN ATTACK ON WHAT WE WERE

03:38:15.380 --> 03:38:18.642
ELECTED TO PRESERVE, OUR 
DEMOCRACY. THIS ATTACK ON OUR 

03:38:18.843 --> 03:38:21.074
ELECTIONS, THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER
OF POWER FROM ONE PRESIDENT TO 

03:38:21.834 --> 03:38:26.759
THE NEXT DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN 
DURING THE CIVIL WAR. BUT IT DID

03:38:27.522 --> 03:38:33.002
JUST HAPPEN. BECAUSE OF THE COLD
, CALCULATED AND CONSPIRATORIAL 

03:38:33.166 --> 03:38:36.253
ACCESS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP.

03:38:41.793 --> 03:38:43.793
WE SHOW THE INSURRECTIONIST WERE
DELIBERATE THEY CAME LOOKING FOR

03:38:43.826 --> 03:38:46.765
THE VICE PRESIDENT AND SPEAKER 
PELOSI, READY TO KILL.

03:38:52.559 --> 03:38:54.559
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
INCITED A LAWLESS MOB, HE WAS 

03:38:54.599 --> 03:39:00.076
ATTACKING OUR DEMOCRACY. HE WAS 
TRYING TO BECOME KING AND RULE 

03:39:00.275 --> 03:39:05.359
OVER US AGAINST THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE AND THE VALID RESULTS OF 

03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:08.354
THE ELECTION. FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVER IN OUR HISTORY A SITTING 

03:39:08.498 --> 03:39:12.051
PRESIDENT ACTIVELY INSTIGATED 
HIS SUPPORTERS TO VIOLENTLY 

03:39:12.267 --> 03:39:16.924
DISRUPT THE PROCESS THE PROVIDES
FOR THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF 

03:39:17.138 --> 03:39:20.390
POWER FROM ONE PRESIDENT TO THE 
NEXT. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A 

03:39:20.591 --> 03:39:22.591
MOMENT. WHAT IF

03:39:26.474 --> 03:39:28.474
TRUMP HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL? WHAT 
IF HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN 

03:39:28.510 --> 03:39:30.542
OVERTURNING THE WILL OF OUR 
PEOPLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL 

03:39:30.743 --> 03:39:33.681
PROCESSES. WHO AMONG US IS 
WILLING TO RISK THAT OUTCOME

03:39:38.662 --> 03:39:40.662
BY LETTING TRUMPS CONSTITUTIONAL
CRIMES GO UNANSWERED.

03:39:47.623 --> 03:39:52.492
WE HAVE TO PREVENT EVERY 
PRESIDENT, TODAY, TOMORROW, OR 

03:39:52.693 --> 03:39:58.339
ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE FROM 
BELIEVING THAT THIS CONDUCT IS 

03:39:58.481 --> 03:40:03.662
ACCEPTABLE. TODAY WE HAVE TO 
STAND UP FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND 

03:40:03.863 --> 03:40:06.659
ENSURE WE REMAIN A COUNTRY 
GOVERNED BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE 

03:40:06.802 --> 03:40:08.802
PEOPLE BY TELLING

03:40:12.609 --> 03:40:14.427
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS 

03:40:14.428 --> 03:40:19.098
COUNTRY AND ALL ACROSS THE WORLD
THAT HIS CRIMES WILL NOT AND 

03:40:19.512 --> 03:40:21.512
CANNOT STAND. 

03:40:34.128 --> 03:40:36.128
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASK

03:40:38.597 --> 03:40:40.989
UNANIMOUS CONSENT THE HOUSE 
STAND IN RECESS FOR 15 MINUTES. 

03:40:41.136 --> 03:40:43.136
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:40:45.308 --> 03:40:48.956
NO OBJECTIONS, THE SENATE WILL 
STAND IN RECESS. 

03:40:48.957 --> 03:40:54.656
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITH THAT GAVEL WE ARE NOW 
ON A BREAK WITH THE DAY DESIGNED

03:40:54.855 --> 03:40:56.855
BY THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS TO PUT THE FOCUS 

03:40:57.240 --> 03:41:02.158
SQUARELY ON TRUMP. ALSO WITH A 
FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE

03:41:02.373 --> 03:41:07.441
PAINTING AND SHOWING AS THE 
VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK AS WELL AS

03:41:07.655 --> 03:41:10.849
OTHER DANGEROUS EPISODES THAT 
LED UP TO APPEARED THERE IS 

03:41:10.998 --> 03:41:16.792
MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL,
LET'S GO TO JAMES, CALM THIS 

03:41:17.552 --> 03:41:22.630
WITH THE WASHINGTON POST. I WANT
TO START WHERE WE LEFT OFF. THIS

03:41:22.770 --> 03:41:24.770
ILLUSTRATION BY

03:41:28.976 --> 03:41:31.011
REP. DAVID CICILLINE OF THE 
PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE CAPITAL,

03:41:31.210 --> 03:41:35.891
INCLUDING THE JANITORIAL STAFF  
AND THE POLICE AND THE ABUSE OF 

03:41:36.091 --> 03:41:39.142
THE POLICE SUFFERED BOTH VERBAL 
AND PHYSICAL AT THE HANDS OF 

03:41:39.342 --> 03:41:41.440
THAT MOB, LET'S START THERE, 
JAMES. 

03:41:41.441 --> 03:41:46.743
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS A TEMPLE OF DEMOCRACY BUT 
IT'S ALSO A WORK PACE

03:41:53.560 --> 03:41:55.560
WORKPLACE. SOME 10,000 PEOPLE 
WORK THERE. IT IS COMPLICATED, A

03:41:55.594 --> 03:41:57.612
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING HOME 
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS 

03:41:57.828 --> 03:42:01.476
WAS A TREAT DEEPLY TRAUMATIZING 
EVENT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 

03:42:01.678 --> 03:42:05.549
SCARED FOR THEIR LIVES. WE HEARD
ABOUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

03:42:05.945 --> 03:42:07.945
POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE BEING 
CALLED RACIAL EPITHETS AND HAD 

03:42:07.977 --> 03:42:12.645
TO HOLD IT TOGETHER AS THEY WERE
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT AND WEREN'T 

03:42:12.859 --> 03:42:15.295
ABLE TO RELEASE UNTIL THEY WERE 
IN A SAFE PLACE LATER. WE HEARD 

03:42:15.496 --> 03:42:17.496
FROM PEOPLE WHO

03:42:20.571 --> 03:42:26.263
SAID THEIR SENSE OF SECURITY WAS
SHATTERED. PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO

03:42:26.464 --> 03:42:29.712
COME TO WORK ON THE DAY OF THE 
INAUGURATION BECAUSE THEY WERE 

03:42:29.913 --> 03:42:31.913
AFRAID IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE.

03:42:35.198 --> 03:42:41.495
THAT WAS THE CRESCENDO OF TWO 
SOLID HOURS, LAYING OUT HOW THIS

03:42:41.696 --> 03:42:47.594
WAS NOT AN ABERRATION. WE HEARD 
THE BEGINNING FROM REP. JAMIE 

03:42:47.795 --> 03:42:54.294
RASKIN THERE'S REALLY A SIX-YEAR
TRACK  RECORD OF TRUMP GIVING 

03:42:54.695 --> 03:42:56.823
WINKS AND NODS OF VIOLENCE OR 
CREATING IT AFTER-THE-FACT.

03:43:01.396 --> 03:43:03.629
USE THE SIEGE OF THE MICHIGAN 
STATE CAPITAL LAST SPRING ON THE

03:43:03.844 --> 03:43:05.844
PLOT AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC

03:43:08.711 --> 03:43:10.743
GOVERNOR, HE CALLED IT A DRESS 
REHEARSAL FOR WHAT HAPPENED ON 

03:43:11.509 --> 03:43:13.509
JANUARY 6. HE PRAISED

03:43:19.277 --> 03:43:21.277
A PERSON THAT ASSAULTED A 
REPORTER. SAID THERE WERE THE 

03:43:21.309 --> 03:43:23.309
GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES IN 
CHARLOTTESVILLE. THIS WAS IN 

03:43:23.343 --> 03:43:26.993
SOME ISOLATED INCIDENT I THINK 
IS THE CORE TAKE AWAY FROM THE 

03:43:27.198 --> 03:43:29.629
LAST TWO HOURS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S PLAY AN EXAMPLE OF 

03:43:30.024 --> 03:43:32.024
THAT. THIS IS FROM

03:43:34.715 --> 03:43:36.715
REP. JAMIE RASKIN, LEAD HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER APPEARED  HE

03:43:36.745 --> 03:43:41.615
MADE THE CASE THAT TRUMP AD 
ALONG LONG ESTABLISHED PATTERN 

03:43:41.815 --> 03:43:43.815
OF INCITING VIOLENCE.

03:43:46.831 --> 03:43:48.831
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:43:52.183 --> 03:43:54.359
THESE TACTICS WERE ROAD TESTED. 
JANUARY 6 WAS A CULMINATION OF 

03:43:54.497 --> 03:43:57.016
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS. NOT AN 
ABERRATION FROM THEM. THE 

03:43:57.164 --> 03:44:00.661
INSURRECTION WAS THE MOST 
VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS EPISODE SO

03:44:00.798 --> 03:44:08.378
FAR IN TRUMPS CONTINUING PATTERN
AND PRACTICE OF INCITING BIKES 

03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:13.515
VIOLENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO RHONDA, YOU CAN 

03:44:13.715 --> 03:44:17.769
HEAR THE CONGRESSMAN PUT NOT 
JUST JANUARY 6 ON THE CONSCIENCE

03:44:17.981 --> 03:44:23.885
OF THE SENATE BUT ANYTHING THAT 
CAN HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IF THEY

03:44:24.070 --> 03:44:27.417
DO NOT ACT. WHAT POSITION DOES 
IS PUT THE SENATORS IN? 

03:44:27.418 --> 03:44:35.238
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT, REP. JAMIE RASKIN SAID
IN A CLIP , SO FAR. HE 

03:44:35.853 --> 03:44:38.448
THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. HE IS 
INDICATING, IF THEY DON'T ACT 

03:44:38.591 --> 03:44:41.336
NOW YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAPPEN 
AGAIN. HE ALSO LATER ON PLAYED A

03:44:41.537 --> 03:44:46.821
CLIP FOR I BELIEVE IT WAS REP. 
DAVID CICILLINE  WHO SAID AFTER 

03:44:47.784 --> 03:44:53.521
THE CHARLOTTESVILLE INCIDENT 
WHERE HER DAUGHTER WAS KILLED 

03:44:53.935 --> 03:44:55.969
THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. SO THAT
WAS NEARLY PROPHETIC WHEN YOU 

03:44:56.168 --> 03:44:59.620
WATCH IT THROUGH THE LENS ON 
KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY

03:44:59.821 --> 03:45:05.304
6. THIS IS A PART OF THE 
STRATEGY VERY THEY REMIND 

03:45:05.505 --> 03:45:07.505
SENATORS THAT THIS HAPPENED TO 
THEM.

03:45:10.786 --> 03:45:13.586
IF THEY DON'T ACT NOW THIS IS A 
LIKELIHOOD THIS COULD HAPPEN 

03:45:13.729 --> 03:45:18.506
AGAIN. HE SPENT THE FIRST 
PORTION OF THE DAY GOING THROUGH

03:45:18.706 --> 03:45:20.706
EARLY TRUMP EVENTS

03:45:23.175 --> 03:45:25.622
DURING THE PRIMARY SEASON BACK 
IN 2015 WHEN HE WAS FIRST ON THE

03:45:25.822 --> 03:45:27.822
SCENE AS A CANDIDATE FOR 
PRESIDENT WHERE HE WOULD NOT 

03:45:27.854 --> 03:45:31.718
DECRY ANY OF THE VIOLENT ATTACKS
AND ASSAULTS THAT HAPPENED AT 

03:45:31.919 --> 03:45:34.244
HIS OWN RALLIES AND INSTEAD 
ENCOURAGED HIS PEOPLE TO FIGHT.

03:45:41.672 --> 03:45:43.489
REP. JAMIE RASKIN AND THE OTHER 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 

03:45:43.490 --> 03:45:45.723
ESTABLISHING THAT THIS IS PART 
OF AMO AND IT IS CHARACTERISTIC 

03:45:46.136 --> 03:45:48.136
OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
TO SAY THINGS ABOUT HURTING 

03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:52.021
PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST ANY OF 
HIS WISHES OUR THOUGHTS AND TO 

03:45:52.235 --> 03:45:54.468
DO HARM TO THEM IN HIS 
SUPPORTERS WILL PICK UP ON THAT 

03:45:54.669 --> 03:45:59.949
AND ACTUALLY DO HARM. THAT WAS A
KEY PART OF THIS FIRST HALF 

03:46:00.851 --> 03:46:02.851
TODAY

03:46:04.418 --> 03:46:06.852
, NOT ONLY THE THINGS THAT LED 
UP TO JANUARY 6 BE SHOWING 

03:46:07.052 --> 03:46:11.937
THROUGHOUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS 
THIS IS BEEN PART OF A BIGGER 

03:46:12.144 --> 03:46:13.151
CULTURE ASSOCIATED WITH DONALD 
TRUMP. 

03:46:13.152 --> 03:46:15.328
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, TO GIVE IT FROM 
THERE. WE HEARD

03:46:18.838 --> 03:46:20.873
REP. DIANA DEGETTE SAYING THAT 
THIS PROCESS IS NOT TO PUNISH 

03:46:21.074 --> 03:46:26.146
BUT TO PREVENT.  SHE DID TALK 
ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE AND THE 

03:46:26.359 --> 03:46:28.679
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY
6 AS SEEMINGLY UNFATHOMABLE

03:46:32.444 --> 03:46:34.678
UNTIL THEY HAPPEN. US LIKE THAT 
IDEA OF HAVING A LACK OF 

03:46:34.879 --> 03:46:39.147
IMAGINATION TO PICTURE THESE 
THINGS HAPPENING. SO TURN YOUR 

03:46:39.347 --> 03:46:43.612
GAZE INTO THE FUTURE AND WHAT 
RESPONSIBILITY IS PLACED ON THIS

03:46:44.362 --> 03:46:46.362
JURY TODAY?

03:46:50.529 --> 03:46:52.760
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS RIGHT, THAT IS ALSO 
SOMETHING THEY HOPE WILL APPEAL 

03:46:52.961 --> 03:46:54.995
TO SENATORS WHO MAY FEEL LIKE 
THEY HAVE A HARD TIME 

03:46:55.196 --> 03:46:57.307
POLITICALLY MAKING THIS DECISION
WHETHER TO CONVICT OR ACQUIT

03:47:02.108 --> 03:47:04.108
, IF ANYTHING THIS IS NOT 
PARTISAN. THIS IS FROM 

03:47:04.128 --> 03:47:07.994
PREVENTING HARM FROM HAPPENING 
AGAIN, NOT ONLY IF HE WAS TO RUN

03:47:08.194 --> 03:47:10.428
AND WIN AN ELECTION LATER ON BUT
ANYBODY ELSE WHO MAY BE 

03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:12.662
CONSIDERING TO HAVE A SIMILAR 
CANDIDACY YOUR PRESIDENCY WHERE 

03:47:12.863 --> 03:47:16.727
THEY CAN CALL SUPPORTERS TO 
ATTACK AND THEY DO. THIS IS 

03:47:16.928 --> 03:47:22.412
SOMETHING THAT IS A WAY TO 
APPEAL AND TAKE THE POLITICS OUT

03:47:22.612 --> 03:47:25.208
OF THIS DECISION. THIS IS ABOUT 
PROTECTING THE DEMOCRACY IN THE 

03:47:25.357 --> 03:47:30.544
FUTURE. THEY ARE ALSO LETTING 
PEOPLE KNOW IF YOU LET HIM OFF 

03:47:30.744 --> 03:47:35.009
THE HOOK FOR THIS YOU ARE 
LETTING THE RIOTERS OFF THE HOOK

03:47:35.211 --> 03:47:38.400
AS WELL. THEY WILL SEE THIS AS A
VICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP AND BE 

03:47:38.539 --> 03:47:41.310
EMBOLDENED NOT ONLY DO THIS 
AGAIN IN DC BUT LOCALLY WHERE 

03:47:41.512 --> 03:47:43.745
THEY LIVE, THEIR STATE CAPITALS 
OR PLACES OF LOCAL LEGISLATURE 

03:47:43.946 --> 03:47:49.028
THAT THEY WILL KEEP DOING THIS 
IF THEY DON'T SEE IT AS AN 

03:47:49.228 --> 03:47:51.228
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE IF HE IS 
IMPEACHED AND CONVICTED THROUGH 

03:47:51.597 --> 03:47:56.128
THIS TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FOLLOW FROM JANUARY 6 

03:47:56.343 --> 03:47:59.592
EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE CAPITAL 
COMPOUND. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

03:47:59.794 --> 03:48:03.802
HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RECKON WITH 
THEIR ROLE IN RADICALIZING THE 

03:48:03.944 --> 03:48:05.983
RIOTERS. OUR NATIONAL REPORTER 
HAS MORE.

03:48:09.944 --> 03:48:13.396
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS ARE ARGUING TODAY,  

03:48:13.809 --> 03:48:18.077
INVITED THE FOLLOWERS TO STORM 
THE CAPITAL. THAT INVITATION 

03:48:18.277 --> 03:48:21.124
CAME OVER THE PRESIDENT SOCIAL 
MEDIA ACCOUNTS. WE HEARD AGAIN 

03:48:21.325 --> 03:48:23.325
TODAY FROM REP. DIANA DEGETTE 

03:48:26.193 --> 03:48:28.227
WHO LAID OUT THE RIOTERS AND THE
SUPPORTERS ECHOED THE LANGUAGE 

03:48:28.427 --> 03:48:30.821
ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AND PEOPLE 
SHARED LIVE STREAMS OF THE 

03:48:30.968 --> 03:48:35.128
ATTACK ON THE SUM WHICH IS BEING
USED AS EVIDENCE AGAINST 

03:48:35.342 --> 03:48:37.342
APPEARANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS 
INSEPARABLE FROM THIS ATTACK ON 

03:48:37.913 --> 03:48:42.189
THIS TRIAL. ONE OF THE PLATFORMS
MENTIONED TODAY, QUITE A FEW 

03:48:42.331 --> 03:48:52.197
TIMES IS A  PARLERPLATFORM, 
MENTIONS CIVIL WAR, 

03:48:52.397 --> 03:48:58.094
QUADRUPLES AFTER TRUMP SAID ON 
HIS SPEECH AFTER THE RIGHT WAS 

03:48:58.294 --> 03:49:00.111
KICKING OFF THAT HIS SUPPORTERS 
SHOULD SHOW STRENGTH. THEY 

03:49:00.112 --> 03:49:05.396
STREAMED THEIR ATTACK ON PARLER 
AND CONTINUE TO USE THE PLATFORM

03:49:05.597 --> 03:49:07.597
TO CALL FOR FURTHER VIOLENCE.

03:49:12.912 --> 03:49:14.912
THEY HAVE TO FACE THEIR 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS ROLE IN 

03:49:15.506 --> 03:49:22.861
THE ATTACK. THERE IS CALL TO 
ACTION ON JANUARY 6. READERS OF 

03:49:23.076 --> 03:49:31.810
FAR RIGHT GROUPS. IN THE WAKE OF
THE ATTACK. THE APPLE APP STORE 

03:49:32.211 --> 03:49:37.629
THEY REMOVE THE PLATFORM FROM 
ITS OFFERINGS AND WHEN AMAZON 

03:49:37.776 --> 03:49:43.384
STOPPED HOSTING IT WAS 
EFFECTIVELY SHUTTERED. THERE'S A

03:49:43.581 --> 03:49:48.666
FEW CONSERVATIVE CELEBRITIES 
PLEDGED TO RETURN, QUOTES IS ON 

03:49:48.864 --> 03:49:51.997
THE PAGE RIGHT NOW, WE WON'T LET
CIVIL DISCOURSE PARISH

03:49:56.390 --> 03:49:58.411
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO GET 
BACK ONLINE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

03:49:59.161 --> 03:50:04.107
TO REMEMBER, THEY ONLY HAD A 
FRACTION OF THE DAILY USERS OF 

03:50:04.311 --> 03:50:06.771
FACEBOOK AND TWITTER GETS. 
TWITTER HAS ABOUT 350 MILLION 

03:50:07.146 --> 03:50:12.843
USERS PER MONTH AND FACEBOOK HAS
BILLIONS WELL PARLER HAS ABOUT 

03:50:13.043 --> 03:50:17.605
15 MILLION  TOTAL USERS AND 2 
MILLION ACTIVE USERS.

03:50:21.374 --> 03:50:23.374
BARILLA TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE 
OF SOCIAL MEDIA

03:50:27.459 --> 03:50:29.895
IN THE CAPITAL ATTACK WE HAVE TO
LOOK BACK OVER YEARS OF TRUMP'S 

03:50:30.097 --> 03:50:33.144
STATEMENTS ON TWITTER AND 
ELSEWHERE AS IMPEACHMENT 

03:50:33.358 --> 03:50:35.358
MANAGERS HAVE DONE TODAY. SOME 
OF THE MOST UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE 

03:50:35.383 --> 03:50:38.120
THEY HAVE SEEN TODAY SHOWING HIS
LACK OF REMORSE OVER THE ATTACKS

03:50:40.874 --> 03:50:43.309
COME FROM TWITTER WHICH FOR SO 
MANY YEARS OF GIVEN US A DIRECT 

03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:45.744
LINE TO THE FORMER PRESIDENTS 
THINKING. SOMETHING THAT HAS 

03:50:45.945 --> 03:50:49.554
BEEN MISSING IS THE REAL-TIME 
REACTION FROM TRUMP.

03:50:53.661 --> 03:50:55.694
SINCE TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED HIS 
ACCOUNT WE NO LONGER HEAR FROM 

03:50:55.894 --> 03:50:59.246
HIM. FACE BACK FACEBOOK IS ALSO 
SUSPENDED HIS

03:51:03.011 --> 03:51:04.840
ACCOUNT AND HAS AN INDEPENDENT 
OVERSIGHT BOARD WHETHER TO 

03:51:04.841 --> 03:51:09.712
DECIDE TO LET HIM BACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, AS THE 

03:51:10.112 --> 03:51:14.994
MANAGERS JOB HERE IS TO HAVE 
DONALD TRUMP ON TRIAL, HOW DO 

03:51:15.195 --> 03:51:17.195
THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE 
LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 

03:51:17.228 --> 03:51:19.660
OTHER PARTIES? SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANIES, THE ACTUAL ATTACKERS 

03:51:19.875 --> 03:51:24.690
OF THE CAPITAL? THERE WERE 
MOMENTS WHERE REP. DIANA DEGETTE

03:51:26.119 --> 03:51:28.119
WAS

03:51:32.264 --> 03:51:34.495
RELIEVING SOME OF THE BURDEN OFF
OF PEOPLE WHO WENT TO WASHINGTON

03:51:34.696 --> 03:51:37.548
TO RALLY AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SHE TALKED ABOUT THEM FOLLOWING 

03:51:38.310 --> 03:51:42.415
THE CALL THAT THEIR PRESIDENT 
ISSUED. I'M WONDERING WHAT THAT 

03:51:43.179 --> 03:51:45.353
MIGHT THEN MEAN FOR LEGAL CASES,
ETC.?

03:51:51.147 --> 03:51:53.381
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  IT WILL CERTAINLY 
BE ADMISSIBLE. WE ARE SEEING THE

03:51:53.584 --> 03:51:56.428
TRUMP DEFENSE BEING TROTTED OUT 
BY SOME DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.  REP.

03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:58.661
DIANA DEGETTE CITED ONE OF THE 
LAWYERS FILINGS IN WHICH THEY 

03:51:59.428 --> 03:52:03.744
SAID  THIS PERSON THOUGHT THEY 
WERE BEING DIRECTED TO DO THIS 

03:52:03.945 --> 03:52:07.194
BY THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. 
ULTIMATELY SHE DID HAVE A LINE 

03:52:07.394 --> 03:52:10.244
SAYING I'M NOT CONDONING WHAT 
THEY DID AND THEY COMMITTED 

03:52:10.444 --> 03:52:13.097
CRIMES BUT THEY DID SO AT 
TRUMP'S DIRECTION. THIS FOLLOWS 

03:52:13.294 --> 03:52:18.672
WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY. THE 
CONDOS ALMOST PRESENTED

03:52:22.427 --> 03:52:27.097
WHAT THEY CALL, MARAUDERS, 
PEOPLE WHO WERE DUPED BY TRUMP, 

03:52:27.311 --> 03:52:30.911
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, 
THESE PEOPLE WERE LIED TO BY 

03:52:31.061 --> 03:52:36.405
TRUMP. TODAY IN HER PRESENTATION
SHE CITED A LOT OF THREAT 

03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:39.494
ASSESSMENTS FROM THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, 

03:52:39.693 --> 03:52:43.757
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,
FBI ABOUT HOW THESE DOMESTIC AND

03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:46.520
VIOLENT EXTREMISTS,

03:52:55.341 --> 03:52:57.977
THEY SAID THE WHOLE JANUARY 6 
EPISODE HAS BEEN A BOON FOR 

03:52:58.176 --> 03:53:02.243
RECRUITMENT TO BRING IN MORE 
PEOPLE TO THEIR CAUSE WHEN SHE 

03:53:02.444 --> 03:53:06.708
CITED A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING, WE
ARE WAITING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM

03:53:06.909 --> 03:53:12.394
TRUMP ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT. TO 
TIE TRUMPED ALL OF THIS CRIMINAL

03:53:12.608 --> 03:53:18.896
ACTIVITY. ULTIMATELY HE IS THE 
ONE ON TRIAL AND THEY HAVE BEEN 

03:53:19.097 --> 03:53:21.290
PRETTY CAREFUL NOT TO SUGGEST 
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE ACCOMPLICES

03:53:21.435 --> 03:53:30.075
OR THE TECH COMPANIES BEAR 
LIABILITY. IT IS INTERESTING, 

03:53:30.477 --> 03:53:32.477
REP. DAVID CICILLINE IS THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY 

03:53:32.511 --> 03:53:36.320
COMMITTEE ON  ANTITRUST. HE'S 
THE LEADING DEMOCRATIC CRITICAL 

03:53:36.461 --> 03:53:38.461
OF

03:53:40.043 --> 03:53:42.277
TECH BIG TECH AND SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANIES IN THE HOUSE BUT THIS 

03:53:42.478 --> 03:53:44.478
IS JUST NOT PART OF THE 
PRESENTATION BECAUSE IT IS 

03:53:44.512 --> 03:53:50.197
DONALD TRUMP ON TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF REP. 

03:53:50.398 --> 03:53:54.862
DAVID CICILLINE'S PRESENTATION 
FROM TODAY.  HE TOOK TIME TO 

03:53:55.076 --> 03:53:57.076
SHOW THE DAMAGE AND ATTACKS IN 
THE VIOLENCE SUSTAINED BY 

03:53:57.097 --> 03:53:59.945
CAPITOL POLICE AND ASKED WHERE 
WAS THE SUPPORT FOR LAW AND 

03:54:00.145 --> 03:54:04.213
ORDER? AT ONE POINT HE 
COMMENTED, SO MUCH FOR BACK THE 

03:54:04.412 --> 03:54:10.709
BLUE WHICH IS SUPPORTING BLUE, 
POLICE OFFICERS. LET'S LISTEN 

03:54:11.124 --> 03:54:15.993
HIM DRIVE HOME THE FACT THAT THE
MOB WAS NOT SUPPORTING WHAT 

03:54:16.195 --> 03:54:19.243
REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID IS THEIR 
POLITICAL AGENDA. LET'S WATCH. 

03:54:24.473 --> 03:54:26.473
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:54:28.379 --> 03:54:32.245
THEY CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS TRAITORS. YOU HAVE TO 

03:54:32.446 --> 03:54:34.446
WONDER, WHO HAVE THESE RIOTERS 
SWORN TO

03:54:40.576 --> 03:54:42.811
? TO WHOM DO THEY BELIEVE THEY 
OWE THEIR LOYALTY? TO THE 

03:54:43.012 --> 03:54:45.380
PEOPLE, THE CONSTITUTION, TO OUR
DEMOCRACY? OR TO DONALD TRUMP? 

03:54:45.526 --> 03:54:47.526
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:54:51.945 --> 03:54:56.612
RHONDA, WE KNEW THE TESTIMONY 
AND VIDEO WOULD BE HARD TO BE 

03:54:56.825 --> 03:54:58.825
WITNESS TO WE

03:55:03.526 --> 03:55:05.558
KNEW THEY WOULD SHOW HOW TRULY 
DANGEROUS THE SITUATION WAS FOR 

03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:08.128
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND STAFFERS
BUT TODAY WAS ALSO VERY 

03:55:08.274 --> 03:55:11.646
DISTURBING TO SEE SUCH ANGER AND
VITRIOL AND PHYSICAL ATTACKS 

03:55:11.858 --> 03:55:13.858
AIMED AT LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:55:16.728 --> 03:55:18.728
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  THAT'S RIGHT, 
IMAGINE THE TRAUMA THAT MANY 

03:55:18.761 --> 03:55:23.843
LAW-ENFORCEMENT WORKERS  HERE ON
THE HILL FELT BECAUSE THEY ARE 

03:55:24.043 --> 03:55:26.639
BEING TOLD THEY ARE TRAITORS AND
VERY AWARE THEY WILL BE 

03:55:26.815 --> 03:55:31.961
OVERWHELMED. I GO BACK TO MY 
EXPERIENCES ON JANUARY 6 AND A 

03:55:32.162 --> 03:55:37.847
REMEMBER WHEN WE ARE EVACUATED, 
AS STAFFERS SAID, SHE JUST 

03:55:38.059 --> 03:55:40.059
LOOKED OUTSIDE AND I THINK THE 
CAPITOL POLICE

03:55:43.745 --> 03:55:45.778
HAVE YOU ALL IN THE BASEMENT 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T 

03:55:45.979 --> 03:55:48.613
PROTECT EVERYONE TODAY THEY ARE 
BEING OVERRUN. SHE HAS SO MUCH 

03:55:48.827 --> 03:55:51.060
FEAR IN HER EYES, SAYING THAT 
EVENTUALLY THIS MOB IS GOING TO 

03:55:51.260 --> 03:55:55.618
GET IN AND DO HARM AND IS JUST A
MATTER OF TIME. SO WE ARE

03:55:59.994 --> 03:56:02.226
ABLE TO SEE THIS VIDEO HOW THE 
OFFICERS ARE TREATED AND OVERRUN

03:56:02.427 --> 03:56:04.874
AND COULD NOT GO UP AGAINST THIS
MOB EVENTUALLY AND I DID THAT 

03:56:05.075 --> 03:56:09.742
ALL THEY COULD WHEN WE KNOW THE 
MOB USE SOME OF THEIR GEAR AND 

03:56:09.943 --> 03:56:14.010
THEIR OFFICERS THERE ARE FINDING
OUT THEY HAD HAIRSPRAY AND MASON

03:56:14.211 --> 03:56:19.081
OTHER THINGS TO FIGHT THEIR WAY 
IN. SO THE CAPITOL POLICE IN THE

03:56:19.296 --> 03:56:24.777
DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER, LAP OF 
INSECURITY ABOUT THE CAPITAL AND

03:56:24.978 --> 03:56:30.260
THE OFFICERS WEREN'T PREPARED. 
ALSO SEEN WHAT THEY WERE UP 

03:56:30.461 --> 03:56:32.091
AGAINST, INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE 
MORE HIGHLY CHOREOGRAPHED AND 

03:56:32.092 --> 03:56:35.943
PLANNED THAN WE INITIALLY 
THOUGHT. 

03:56:35.944 --> 03:56:40.209
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW
HOW SENATORS ARE INTERPRETING 

03:56:40.411 --> 03:56:43.661
THIS BUT CONSUMING LITERALLY 
TAKING ON THIS INFORMATION. WE 

03:56:43.874 --> 03:56:49.461
DO HEAR FROM THE POOL THAT 
SENATOR RICK SCOTT, REPUBLICAN 

03:56:49.602 --> 03:56:55.243
OF FLORIDA HAS NOT BEEN WATCHING
THE VIDEOS AND INSTEAD HAS BEEN 

03:56:55.445 --> 03:56:57.878
LOOKING DOWN AT A BLANK MAP OF 
ASIA WHICH HE APPEARS TO BE 

03:56:58.628 --> 03:57:03.162
FILLING IN. WHICH I REMEMBER 
DOING THAT IN THE EIGHTH GRADE 

03:57:03.363 --> 03:57:08.443
BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
DOING IT. WHAT IS GOING ON? 

03:57:08.444 --> 03:57:10.677
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE IS ONE OF THE SEVEN 
SENATORS WHO VOTED TO OVERTURN 

03:57:10.878 --> 03:57:14.128
THE ELECTION. HE HAS BEEN ONE OF
THE MOST OUTSPOKEN. HE SAID THIS

03:57:14.344 --> 03:57:18.809
IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME EVEN 
IMMEDIATELY, WATCHING THOSE 

03:57:19.011 --> 03:57:24.493
VIDEOS WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THOUGHT WAS KIND OF INSENSITIVE,

03:57:24.694 --> 03:57:31.194
HE CALLED INTO MULTIPLE TALK 
RADIO AND SAID THIS IS A SHAM. 

03:57:31.609 --> 03:57:34.042
HE SOME OF THE WANTS TO RUN FOR 
PRESIDENT. I THINK HE'S TRYING 

03:57:34.244 --> 03:57:37.494
TO GET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN 
THE TRUMP LANE, HE SHARES THE 

03:57:37.694 --> 03:57:42.776
SAME POLITICAL AND STRATEGISTS 
AS JOSH HAWLEY. I THINK SOME OF 

03:57:42.980 --> 03:57:44.980
IT IS A SHOW.

03:57:49.678 --> 03:57:53.744
THIS IS TAKING A TOLL, SITTING 
AND WATCHING ALL OF THIS IS 

03:57:53.947 --> 03:57:55.947
TIRING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 
USED TO

03:58:01.659 --> 03:58:03.659
SITTING FOR SO LONG. BECAUSE A 
SOCIAL DISTANCING THEY ARE 

03:58:03.693 --> 03:58:05.726
ALLOWED TO BE IN THE CLOAKROOM 
OR THE CHAMBER APPEARED SOME 

03:58:05.927 --> 03:58:08.375
HAVE GONE IN THERE WE HAVEN'T 
SEEN, SOME HAVE BEEN SPOTTED, 

03:58:08.576 --> 03:58:12.831
MAKING CELL PHONE CALLS IN THE 
BASEMENT RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE 

03:58:13.581 --> 03:58:15.581
SENATE CHAMBER.

03:58:17.311 --> 03:58:21.778
SUMMER SITTING UP IN THE GALLERY
WHICH WOULD NORMALLY BE RESERVED

03:58:21.979 --> 03:58:25.228
FOR PARTICIPANTS, THAT'S WHERE 
JOSH HAWLEY WAS YESTERDAY, 

03:58:25.989 --> 03:58:27.989
SPREADING OUT

03:58:30.711 --> 03:58:32.711
AND READING PAPERS THAT HIS 
STAFFERS CLAIM WAS TRIAL BRIEFS 

03:58:32.745 --> 03:58:34.745
FOR THIS TRIAL.

03:58:37.613 --> 03:58:39.613
REPUBLICANS AREN'T ABLE TO 
RESPOND OR OBJECT, WE SAW THAT 

03:58:39.644 --> 03:58:42.292
MOMENT FROM MIKE LEE LAST NIGHT 
AND THEY DO WANT TO LOOK AWAY. I

03:58:42.492 --> 03:58:44.409
HAVE MENTIONED THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT CHALLENGERS HAVE 

03:58:44.410 --> 03:58:46.410
SAID

03:58:48.592 --> 03:58:50.826
BEEN CAREFUL NOT NOT TO SAY 
REPUBLICANS ALL ON TRIAL BUT IT 

03:58:51.027 --> 03:58:55.694
IS A CLEAR SUBTEXT OF THE CASE. 
THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THIS IS 

03:58:55.894 --> 03:58:57.928
GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN WHICH IS A
CENTRAL ARGUMENT, THE TRUMP 

03:58:58.128 --> 03:59:04.629
DIDN'T SHOW ANY REMORSE. JANUARY
6 WAS A WORSE EPISODE OF 

03:59:05.046 --> 03:59:07.175
VIOLENCE SO FAR ACCORDING TO 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN.  REP. TED 

03:59:07.314 --> 03:59:13.162
LIEU SAID  TRUMP'S TOTAL LACK OF
REMORSE IS GOING TO MEAN IT 

03:59:13.363 --> 03:59:17.428
COULD HAPPEN AGAIN IF HE'S NOT 
CONVICTED. THE SUBTEXT OF THOSE 

03:59:17.629 --> 03:59:19.661
KINDS OF COMMENTS IS THAT 
REPUBLICANS WILL BE TO BLAME IF 

03:59:19.875 --> 03:59:22.713
THEY VOTE TO ACQUIT TRUMP HERE 
AND THERE IS MORE MOB VIOLENCE 

03:59:22.912 --> 03:59:27.177
IN THE FUTURE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO POLITICAL 

03:59:28.132 --> 03:59:30.132
REPORTER JOYCE.

03:59:31.846 --> 03:59:37.944
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT STRUCK ME SO FAR HOW 
MUCH BROADER THE GUN WITH THEIR 

03:59:38.144 --> 03:59:42.010
ARGUMENTS. THEY ARE NOT JUST 
TALKING ABOUT THE U.S. CAPITAL. 

03:59:42.411 --> 03:59:44.444
THEY ARE GOING DOWN THERE, 
TALKING ABOUT THE STATE 

03:59:44.645 --> 03:59:49.529
CAPITALS, REP. DIANA DEGETTE  
TALKED ABOUT THE 21 STATES HOW 

03:59:49.728 --> 03:59:51.728
TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS 
BECAUSE

03:59:55.012 --> 03:59:57.012
THERE WAS POTENTIAL ATTACKS 
THREATENING THE STATE CAPITAL.

04:00:00.696 --> 04:00:03.544
SHE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THESE FOUR
STATES, WASHINGTON, ILLINOIS, 

04:00:03.946 --> 04:00:10.447
MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND WASHINGTON
DC PROMPTING MASSIVE DEPLOYMENT.

04:00:10.647 --> 04:00:13.986
BECAUSE OF THE THREAT. THERE WAS
A SON AT

04:00:17.553 --> 04:00:19.786
RUNOFF IN GEORGIA WE ARE AT THE 
STATE CAPITOL IN GEORGIA WHERE 

04:00:19.988 --> 04:00:22.835
WE WERE PREPARING TO DO A LIVE 
SHOT IN THE GRIP OF TRUMP 

04:00:23.036 --> 04:00:27.917
SUPPORTERS HAD GATHERED AROUND 
US IN THIS PARKING LOT, PREPARED

04:00:28.116 --> 04:00:32.382
TO GO UP TO THE GEORGIA STATE 
CAPITAL AND CONFRONT THE 

04:00:32.582 --> 04:00:34.582
REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE 
THERE BECAUSE THEY SAID

04:00:39.086 --> 04:00:41.318
THAT THE ELECTION WAS A SHAM AND
THAT IS DIRECTLY REFLECTIVE OF 

04:00:41.518 --> 04:00:43.150
TRUMP'S RHETORIC AROUND THAT 
TIME, FALSELY CLAIMING THE 

04:00:43.151 --> 04:00:48.234
ELECTION WAS RIGGED. TALKING TO 
MEMBERS OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN 

04:00:48.433 --> 04:00:54.320
THAT LOT THAT THEY WHO SAID THEY
WERE INSTRUCTED TO GO TO THE 

04:00:54.522 --> 04:00:56.754
STATE CAPITALS IF THEY COULDN'T 
MAKE IT TO WASHINGTON DC FOR HIS

04:00:57.503 --> 04:01:03.869
TRUMP RALLY. THERE WAS ALSO A 
FORMER MEMBER OF THE  MADE SOME 

04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:06.070
HEADLINES BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY 
WENT UP TO THE SECRETARY OF 

04:01:06.101 --> 04:01:11.183
STATE'S OFFICE TO PRESENT HIS 
THOUGHTS ON THIS AND IT JUST 

04:01:11.384 --> 04:01:15.190
REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW BROAD 
THIS REALLY WAS. IT WASN'T JUST 

04:01:15.325 --> 04:01:21.062
ABOUT THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. 
CAPITAL WHICH WAS HORRIFYING AND

04:01:23.772 --> 04:01:25.602
DEADLY BUT HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS ARE DRIVING HOME THIS 

04:01:25.603 --> 04:01:28.988
POINT THAT THE STRETCHES BEYOND.
AS REP. JAMIE RASKIN SAID, 

04:01:35.754 --> 04:01:38.403
IF WE LET TRUMP GET AWAY WITH IT
AND THEN COME TO YOUR STATE 

04:01:38.603 --> 04:01:41.037
CAPITAL LAURA FOR COMES BACK 
HERE AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO

04:01:41.238 --> 04:01:42.868
SAY? REALLY OFFERING THIS 
QUESTION THAT THE THREAT 

04:01:42.869 --> 04:01:46.320
STRETCHES BEYOND JUST THIS EVENT
ON JANUARY 6 THAT THEY ARE 

04:01:46.520 --> 04:01:48.753
LOOKING AT THAT IT REALLY 
EXTENDS TO THE STATE CAPITALS IN

04:01:48.967 --> 04:01:52.898
THE THREAT HASN'T DISAPPEARED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES,

04:01:56.684 --> 04:02:03.184
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CASTING
THE NET TO WIDE? THESE ARE ALL 

04:02:03.384 --> 04:02:07.450
OF THE EPISODES THEY HAVE 
DESCRIBED, CONFEDERATE FLAGS AT 

04:02:07.650 --> 04:02:13.134
THE MICHIGAN STATE CAPITAL ARE 
TERRIBLE BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE 

04:02:13.335 --> 04:02:15.570
THE LINK BETWEEN ALL OF THESE 
THINGS THAN TRUMP AND HIS STATE 

04:02:15.771 --> 04:02:17.930
OF MIND AND HIS INTENTION ON 
JANUARY 6. 

04:02:17.931 --> 04:02:23.979
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY, THERE IS SOME 
RISK THERE WITH DEBATE YOU

04:02:26.951 --> 04:02:30.604
IS CALLED THE SPREAD YOU PUT A 
BUNCH OF STUFF OUT THERE AND SEE

04:02:30.805 --> 04:02:33.133
WHAT PEOPLE RESPOND TO. BUT THE 
CONVERSE CAN BE TRUE.

04:02:37.504 --> 04:02:39.951
WHEN YOU THROW A BUNCH OF STUFF 
OUT THERE THE DEFENSE TEAM CAN 

04:02:40.152 --> 04:02:42.587
PICK ON THE WEAKEST PART OF WHAT
YOU THROUGHOUT THERE AND SAY IT 

04:02:42.788 --> 04:02:45.771
IS PREPOSTEROUS TO CONNECT THEM 
TO THE PLOT TO KILL GRETCHEN 

04:02:45.912 --> 04:02:51.118
WHITMER, THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A 
STRETCH AND THE FACT THAT THE 

04:02:51.320 --> 04:02:53.910
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS DID 
SO COULD HURT THEIR CASE. I 

04:02:54.059 --> 04:02:56.059
THOUGHT

04:02:57.619 --> 04:02:59.651
REP. JAMIE RASKIN WORKED REALLY 
HARD TO TRY AND MAKE THAT 

04:02:59.853 --> 04:03:03.663
LINKAGE , THAT CLIP ESPECIALLY 
FROM THE RALLY THE TRUMP AD IN 

04:03:03.814 --> 04:03:08.676
MUSKEGON, CALLED A WINK AND A 
NOD.

04:03:12.451 --> 04:03:15.086
HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO SAY 
LOCK HER UP BUT THEN THEY WILL 

04:03:15.285 --> 04:03:17.616
SAY I WAS ENCOURAGING YOU BUT 
YOU GET THE PICTURE,

04:03:22.199 --> 04:03:24.433
REP. JAMIE RASKIN TRY TO ADDRESS
THAT SO DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THEY 

04:03:24.634 --> 04:03:26.870
WERE JUST THROWING A LOT OF 
STUFF OUT THERE,  THROWING THE 

04:03:27.069 --> 04:03:29.069
KITCHEN SINK TO SEE WHAT STUCK. 
I'M SURPRISED THEY HAVEN'T 

04:03:29.102 --> 04:03:31.102
TALKED MORE ABOUT GEORGIA

04:03:33.571 --> 04:03:35.571
, OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AN ONGOING 
OPEN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO

04:03:36.160 --> 04:03:38.160
TRUMP'S EFFORTS

04:03:40.067 --> 04:03:42.102
TO GET ELECTION OFFICIALS, IN 
HIS WORDS, FIND JUST ONE MORE 

04:03:42.303 --> 04:03:47.184
VOTE TO BE DECLARED THE VICTOR 
IN GEORGIA. SUCH AS CALLING THE 

04:03:47.384 --> 04:03:51.037
SECRETARY OF STATE BUT DEPUTIES 
IN THE OFFICE, OUSTING THE U.S. 

04:03:51.239 --> 04:03:54.901
ATTORNEY WHO WOULDN'T CLAIM THAT
THERE WAS FRAUD, REPLACING HIM 

04:03:55.101 --> 04:03:58.551
WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS MORE 
PLIABLE. THAT SEEMS VERY 

04:03:58.766 --> 04:04:00.766
RELEVANT TO THE CHARGE AT HAND.

04:04:04.236 --> 04:04:06.684
I WAS SORT OF SURPRISE, THEY DID
TALK ABOUT GEORGIA A LITTLE BIT 

04:04:06.883 --> 04:04:09.327
YESTERDAY BUT INSTEAD THEY 
FOCUSED ON THESE EPISODES FROM 

04:04:09.465 --> 04:04:11.911
THE 2016 CAMPAIGN WHICH WERE 
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. THOSE 

04:04:12.062 --> 04:04:16.132
IRRELEVANT IN SHOWING THAT THIS 
IS A PART OF PATTERN

04:04:20.492 --> 04:04:23.421
. BUT I WONDER FOR GOING TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN

04:04:28.007 --> 04:04:29.640
GEORGIA, MICHIGAN, TRYING TO 
OVERTURN THE ELECTIONS DURING 

04:04:29.641 --> 04:04:35.122
THESE PROCEEDINGS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO GO TO YOU MORE ON 

04:04:35.323 --> 04:04:37.556
THIS, HOW TRUMP RESPONDED TO 
SOME OF THOSE EPISODES, HOW HE 

04:04:37.757 --> 04:04:39.757
REACTED TO THEM AS JAMES WAS 
TALKING ABOUT,

04:04:43.239 --> 04:04:45.239
IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

04:04:49.951 --> 04:04:52.185
THE RESPONSE HE GAVE TO THOSE, 
HOW DOES THAT FACTOR IN THE 

04:04:52.383 --> 04:04:56.854
STATE OF MIND ON JANUARY 6? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  OF FACTORS IN 

04:04:57.054 --> 04:04:59.289
BECAUSE IT'S VERY SIMILAR. IF 
YOU LOOK AT THE CASE  OF 

04:04:59.490 --> 04:05:04.974
GOVERNOR WHITMER AND HOW AFTER 
THE PIG KIDNAPPING PLOT WAS 

04:05:05.175 --> 04:05:08.224
FOILED HE TWEETED OUT THAT SHE 
SHOULD THANK HIM AND HE ALSO 

04:05:08.424 --> 04:05:12.292
EARLIER HAD TOLD HER SHE SHOULD 
MEET WITH ANGRY PEOPLE WHO ARE 

04:05:12.493 --> 04:05:17.776
SO ANGRY WITH HER. HE NEVER 
QUITE BRINGS HIMSELF TO GIVE ANY

04:05:17.976 --> 04:05:23.060
SORT OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IN ANY OF THE LEAD UP TO THESE 

04:05:23.261 --> 04:05:26.311
EVENTS OF VIOLENCE AND HE SORT 
OF TAKES A BACKSEAT WHEN THEY DO

04:05:27.074 --> 04:05:31.377
HAPPEN. SO THAT WAS ONE INSTANCE
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WANTED 

04:05:31.593 --> 04:05:34.842
TO PUT OUT THERE. LOOK AT THE 
ATTACKER POTENTIAL ATTACK ON 

04:05:35.244 --> 04:05:37.244
GOVERNOR WHITMER AND SEE HOW

04:05:40.927 --> 04:05:43.374
YOU RESPONDED TO THAT. IT'S THE 
SAME WITH THE SIX WHEN HE WAS 

04:05:43.574 --> 04:05:46.211
ABSENT FOR MANY OF THOSE 
CRITICAL HOURS WHERE HELP NEEDED

04:05:46.413 --> 04:05:51.495
TO BE ON THE WAY HERE AND NO ONE
HEARD FROM HIM AND THEN HE PUTS 

04:05:51.694 --> 04:05:56.187
OUT A VIDEO WITH MIXED MESSAGES,
TELLING PEOPLE TO GO HOME BUT 

04:05:56.387 --> 04:05:58.387
CLAIMING THE ELECTION IS 
FRAUDULENT.

04:06:05.320 --> 04:06:08.169
IF WE LOOK AT RESPONSES IN OTHER
WAYS IT IS ALL THE SAME MO IN 

04:06:08.370 --> 04:06:13.854
THE SAME STORY. YOU CAN LOOK 
BACK EARLIER AND HOW HE REACTED 

04:06:14.254 --> 04:06:18.933
SOME OF HIS REPORTERS DRAGGING A
MAN WHO THEY DEEMED NOT A PART 

04:06:19.134 --> 04:06:22.659
OF THEIR GROUP OR AGAINST TRUMP 
AND HE ENCOURAGED IT APPEARED

04:06:26.239 --> 04:06:28.475
HE HAS NEVER EXPLICITLY DECRIED 
ANY OF THESE ACTIONS AND HE DID 

04:06:28.675 --> 04:06:30.910
THE SAME ON THE SIXTH. SO THEY 
ARE ESTABLISHING THIS AT LEAST 

04:06:31.124 --> 04:06:35.177
NOT JUST THE ONE TIME THING IS 
SOMETHING THAT HE DOES AN 

04:06:35.391 --> 04:06:38.975
ONGOING TREND WITH THEM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:06:43.711 --> 04:06:46.146
WITH THE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT 
ONE THING BUILDS ON ANOTHER. AND

04:06:46.346 --> 04:06:48.797
IF YOU GIVE A WINK AND A NOD 
WHEN AN ATTACK HAPPENS WHEN 

04:06:48.995 --> 04:06:52.243
SOMEONE IS PUNCHED AT YOUR RALLY
, WHEN THERE'S A KIDNAPPING PLOT

04:06:52.444 --> 04:06:56.912
OF A GOVERNOR, IF YOU SHRUG YOUR
SHOULDERS THAT IT OR EVEN 

04:06:57.125 --> 04:06:59.961
APPLAUD IT THEN YOU'RE JUST 
KICKING OPEN THE DOOR MORE AND 

04:07:00.162 --> 04:07:04.228
MORE FOR VIOLENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT, 100% AND THE FLIPSIDE, 

04:07:04.631 --> 04:07:11.545
TRUMP SAW WHEN HE SAID CERTAIN 
THINGS HOW PEOPLE WOULD REACT. 

04:07:11.946 --> 04:07:16.411
THAT HE SAW THAT HIS SUPPORTERS 
WERE WILLING TO ACT VIOLENTLY. 

04:07:16.831 --> 04:07:18.831
THIS IS A HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGER ARGUMENT THAT OVER SIX 

04:07:18.858 --> 04:07:21.441
YEARS WHEN HE WOULD SAY THINGS 
THAT WERE PROVOCATIVE THEY WOULD

04:07:21.585 --> 04:07:26.977
PROVOKE. AND THE ARGUMENT THAT 
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER SAYS, 

04:07:27.738 --> 04:07:29.738
THAT'S WHY

04:07:32.261 --> 04:07:36.015
TRUMP EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING 
STOP THE STEEL RALLY.

04:07:42.409 --> 04:07:46.074
THEN HAVE TO FIGHT LIKE AND GO 
TO CAPITOL HILL.  A SIX YEAR 

04:07:46.275 --> 04:07:51.758
TRACK RECORD MEANT THAT TRUMP 
KNEW THAT VIOLENCE HE HAD 

04:07:51.958 --> 04:07:56.026
VIOLENT SUPPORTERS AND THAT COME
TO WASHINGTON AFTER HE URGED 

04:07:56.226 --> 04:07:58.874
THEM TO. HE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE 
CAPABLE OF AND HE STILL GAVE 

04:07:59.074 --> 04:08:01.866
THEM THAT WINK AND THE KNOB THAT
RHONDA WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. 

04:08:02.007 --> 04:08:08.823
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, THE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO HAS TOLD

04:08:09.582 --> 04:08:11.582
OUR COLLEAGUE

04:08:14.709 --> 04:08:16.709
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER,

04:08:19.994 --> 04:08:22.228
THE SENATOR TOLD HIM HE WOULD 
LOVE TO HEAR TRUMP TESTIFY EVEN 

04:08:22.428 --> 04:08:27.934
THOUGH HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IT 
WOULD EVER HAPPEN. INTERESTING 

04:08:28.135 --> 04:08:30.570
TO HEAR THE APPETITE OF SENATORS
WANTED TO HEAR HIM TRY TO DEFEND

04:08:30.771 --> 04:08:34.233
HIMSELF IN HIS OWN WORDS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WOULD CERTAINLY ADD A 

04:08:34.434 --> 04:08:36.434
DIFFERENT TWIST TO THIS.

04:08:41.951 --> 04:08:43.951
WHERE HEARING THEY WOULD HAPPEN.
AFTER THE DEFENSE OF THEIR 

04:08:44.535 --> 04:08:46.535
ARGUMENTS TOMORROW.

04:08:48.853 --> 04:08:50.886
THEY ARE GOING TO SHORTER 
ARGUMENTS. THERE IS GOING TO BE 

04:08:51.085 --> 04:08:55.350
A VOTE LATER ABOUT SUBPOENA AND 
WITNESSES PEERS SO THAT IS 

04:08:55.552 --> 04:08:57.182
SOMETHING THAT COULD COURSE 
FORESEEABLY HAPPEN WE AREN'T 

04:08:57.183 --> 04:08:59.183
HEARING THAT THEY WILL

04:09:04.084 --> 04:09:06.317
THAT IT WILL HAPPEN. THEY DID 
EXTEND AN OFFER TO HIM TO 

04:09:06.522 --> 04:09:08.651
PROVIDE TESTIMONY LAST FRIDAY 
AND HE DECLINED THAT APPEARED

04:09:13.024 --> 04:09:15.024
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT 
THAT SENATOR SAYING HE WOULD 

04:09:15.054 --> 04:09:17.287
LIKE TO HEAR FROM TRUMP. THERE 
ALSO SHOWS THERE IS AN APPETITE 

04:09:17.488 --> 04:09:19.118
FOR WITNESSES WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR IMPEACHMENT, WHERE IS

04:09:19.119 --> 04:09:22.371
THE LAST ONE, NOT SO MUCH. THERE
WAS A LENGTHY PERIOD OF 

04:09:22.571 --> 04:09:26.222
DEPOSITIONS AND OPEN HEARINGS 
AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED 

04:09:26.435 --> 04:09:28.435
WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE UKRAINE 
CALL.

04:09:33.749 --> 04:09:35.781
A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM PEOPLE, 
SORT OF THE HORSES MOUTH, 

04:09:35.981 --> 04:09:38.159
WHETHER IT BE CAPITAL OFFICERS,

04:09:41.866 --> 04:09:46.334
WHETHER SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO
WERE GIVEN AFFIDAVITS SAY THEY 

04:09:46.536 --> 04:09:48.926
ARE WORKING UNDER THE DIRECTION 
OF DONALD TRUMP OR TRUMP 

04:09:49.068 --> 04:09:51.068
HIMSELF.

04:09:55.885 --> 04:09:57.885
APPETITE OR WONDER, ADDING 
WITNESSES, HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT

04:09:58.254 --> 04:10:00.254
THE CASE?

04:10:03.802 --> 04:10:05.636
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LET'S TALK ABOUT 
WHAT'S ANTICIPATED INTO THE 

04:10:05.637 --> 04:10:07.550
AFTERNOON AND INTO TOMORROW AND 
WE CAN. 

04:10:07.551 --> 04:10:09.551
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:10:11.722 --> 04:10:13.967
WHEN THEY PUT UP THE GRAPHIC 
WITH THE PICTURE OF ALL THE 

04:10:14.168 --> 04:10:16.168
PEOPLE WHO RESIGNED IN PROTEST

04:10:21.472 --> 04:10:23.101
AFTER TRUMP'S RESPONSE TO 
JANUARY 6. OBVIOUSLY THOSE 

04:10:23.102 --> 04:10:25.616
PEOPLE WOULD BE STAR WITNESSES 
IF THEY WERE WILLING TO TESTIFY.

04:10:26.153 --> 04:10:28.946
THAT WOULD TAKE MORE TIME THAN 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPEND ON THIS.

04:10:29.089 --> 04:10:31.089
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:10:32.649 --> 04:10:34.883
BUT THAT'S MAKING A DIRECT LINK 
LIKE THEY THOUGHT TRUMP WAS AT 

04:10:35.084 --> 04:10:37.934
FAULT OR DID THEY, WHY DID THEY 
RESIGN? WHAT WAS HER ACTUAL 

04:10:38.137 --> 04:10:40.137
REASONING, GOING ON THE RECORD 
AND EXPLAINED THAT MORE COURT 

04:10:40.731 --> 04:10:44.381
CLEARLY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HEARD THE RESIGNATION 

04:10:44.517 --> 04:10:48.901
LETTERS. BUT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT
WHAT TO EXPECT THIS AFTERNOON 

04:10:49.101 --> 04:10:52.553
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING 
IT HOME NOW. HAVE A COUPLE HOURS

04:10:52.753 --> 04:10:57.233
LEFT TO TIE THE BOW AROUND THIS.
I DO THINK WERE GOING TO HEAR 

04:10:57.434 --> 04:11:01.492
MORE ABOUT THE OTHER EPISODES. I
THINK THEY HIT PRETTY HARD ON 

04:11:01.692 --> 04:11:05.756
THE FALLOUT ELEMENT OF IT 
APPEARED THE FEAR THAT IS STILL 

04:11:05.958 --> 04:11:11.239
OUT THERE. THE FACT THAT WE 
STILL HAVE A SENSE AND TROOPS 

04:11:11.441 --> 04:11:14.090
PATROLLING THE CAPITAL BECAUSE 
IN THEIR ARGUMENT, ALLEGEDLY, 

04:11:14.492 --> 04:11:16.492
TRUMP'S CONDUCT ON JANUARY 6. 
THEY HAVE FOUR

04:11:20.793 --> 04:11:22.824
SORT OF COVERED THE CORE OF THE 
ARGUMENT INCLUDING THE AFTERMATH

04:11:23.025 --> 04:11:25.025
OF JANUARY 6.

04:11:28.109 --> 04:11:30.343
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOME 
KIND OF SUMMATION OR HOW THEY 

04:11:30.544 --> 04:11:32.979
ARE GOING TO TIE IT ALL 
TOGETHER. I DO THINK IT IS 

04:11:33.178 --> 04:11:35.973
INCUMBENT ON THEM TO TIE ALL OF 
THIS TO TRUMP AS POSSIBLE. 

04:11:36.109 --> 04:11:38.109
PERHAPS

04:11:42.528 --> 04:11:44.760
WHAT WE WILL SEE THIS AFTERNOON 
IS MORE OF A PREEMPTION WHAT 

04:11:44.961 --> 04:11:46.993
THEY EXPECT TO BE SOME OF THE 
DEFENSES ARGUMENTS THAT WILL 

04:11:47.195 --> 04:11:49.426
BEGIN IN EARNEST TOMORROW. THEY 
TECHNICALLY HAVE EIGHT HOURS. I 

04:11:49.641 --> 04:11:52.164
GUESS THEY GOT ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS
IN ALREADY. IN THEORY

04:11:57.792 --> 04:12:00.426
THEY COULD STILL GO ON QUITE A 
LOT IF THEY WANTED. BUT IT DOES 

04:12:00.640 --> 04:12:03.408
HAVE THE FEELING THAT THEY HAVE 
COVERED MOST OF THE BASES. 

04:12:03.409 --> 04:12:05.793
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOMORROW A HEAR FROM TRUMP'S 
LEGAL TEAM.

04:12:11.436 --> 04:12:13.436
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WILL BE FASCINATING.

04:12:19.300 --> 04:12:23.753
THEY SAID THAT BRUCE CASTOR 

04:12:29.102 --> 04:12:30.934
CALLED INAUDIBLE AFTER THE 
OPENING ARGUMENT WITH THE HOUSE 

04:12:30.935 --> 04:12:32.552
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. WHAT'S 
INTERESTING IS THESE GUYS HAVE 

04:12:32.553 --> 04:12:37.838
ONLY BEEN ON THE CASE FOR 10 
DAYS. DURING THE PROCEEDING. 

04:12:38.038 --> 04:12:43.525
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE LONG DAYS. 
IT'S INTERESTING TO KIND OF 

04:12:43.724 --> 04:12:47.176
WONDER HOW PREPARED WILL THEY BE
, HOW MUCH PRACTICE TIME ARE 

04:12:47.391 --> 04:12:53.077
THEY GOING TO HAVE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THESE TWO GUYS, THEY DON'T 

04:12:53.274 --> 04:12:55.274
HAVE A PRE-EXISTING RELATIONSHIP
WITH EACH OTHER,

04:13:05.869 --> 04:13:08.103
IF THEY MAKE ANY UNSURPRISING 
ARGUMENTS OR IF IT'S SORT OF THE

04:13:08.303 --> 04:13:12.371
FIRST OPENING PRESENTATION WHICH
DISAPPOINTED TRUMP HIMSELF, A 

04:13:12.574 --> 04:13:17.452
LOT OF THE SENATE REPUBLICANS 
WHO ARE DOING EVERYTHING 

04:13:17.652 --> 04:13:19.652
POSSIBLE TO SIDE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO ACQUIT 

04:13:20.237 --> 04:13:23.558
HIM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA AFTER THE TRUMP 

04:13:23.759 --> 04:13:26.094
LAWYERS MADE THEIR CASE TO 
DEFEND THE FORMER PRESIDENT

04:13:30.260 --> 04:13:34.123
, WE COULD SEE THIS WRAP UP ON 
SATURDAY. NOT TAKING WEEKEND 

04:13:34.325 --> 04:13:38.416
BRAKES AT THIS POINT. LIKE THE 
PRESIDENTIAL WEEKEND, PRESIDENT 

04:13:38.794 --> 04:13:44.223
THEY WEEKEND ON MONDAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE HERE IN, WE HAVE FIRST

04:13:44.364 --> 04:13:46.364
HEARD

04:13:49.144 --> 04:13:51.381
THEY WERE GOING TO BREAK ON 
SATURDAY AND THEN PICK BACK UP 

04:13:51.594 --> 04:13:54.843
ON SUNDAY BUT IT IS EXPECTED 
THEY ARE JUST GOING TO PLOW 

04:13:55.042 --> 04:13:57.078
RIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND IN 
ORDER TO FINISH THIS UP. SO 

04:13:57.277 --> 04:14:01.976
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE HEARING NOW. 
I'M NOT SURE IF ANYTHING WILL 

04:14:02.176 --> 04:14:05.228
CHANGE ONCE THE DEFENSE STARTS 
THEIR OPENING ARGUMENTS. AFTER 

04:14:05.430 --> 04:14:07.430
THEY CONCLUDE THOSE OPENING 
ARGUMENTS THERE WILL HAVE A FOUR

04:14:08.022 --> 04:14:11.831
HOUR Q&amp;amp;A WHERE SENATORS WILL BE 
ABLE TO QUESTION BOTH SIDES.

04:14:15.994 --> 04:14:18.437
THEY WILL BE OF THE DO IT 
VERBALLY, THEY WILL HAVE TO FILL

04:14:18.629 --> 04:14:20.875
OUT THE FORM AND WRITE OUT A 
QUESTION AND MULTIPLE SENATORS 

04:14:21.076 --> 04:14:23.109
CAN JOIN A QUESTION CARD. SO 
THAT PERIOD WILL BE INTERESTING 

04:14:23.873 --> 04:14:25.873
TO WATCH,

04:14:29.194 --> 04:14:31.027
ABLE TO SEE ESPECIALLY THE 
REPUBLICANS, SEE WHERE THEIR 

04:14:31.028 --> 04:14:35.094
THINKING IS, WHAT QUESTIONS ARE 
THEY GOING TO ASK REX WHAT ARE 

04:14:35.294 --> 04:14:37.294
SOME OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS 
THEY FOUND IN THE IMPEACHMENT 

04:14:37.877 --> 04:14:39.877
MANAGERS ARGUMENT.

04:14:42.603 --> 04:14:44.836
YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE 
WINDOW AND WHAT THEY ARE FEELING

04:14:45.036 --> 04:14:47.484
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WERE NOT ABLE
TO HEAR TOO MUCH FROM THEM. THEY

04:14:47.685 --> 04:14:50.482
CAN'T DEBATE OR ASK QUESTIONS. 
MOST OF WHAT WE ARE GETTING FROM

04:14:50.620 --> 04:14:55.938
THEM. OUT OF THE CHAMBER OR ON 
THEIR WAY IN EACH DAY.

04:14:59.870 --> 04:15:01.870
AFTER THEY DEFENSE WRAPS UP 
THERE

04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:15.302
I THINK THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ON THIS 

04:15:15.516 --> 04:15:19.770
THREAD ABOUT THE HARMS THAT WERE
DONE AFTER THE ATTACK. 

04:15:19.771 --> 04:15:22.221
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK TO THE SENATE 
FLOOR THEY ARE GAMBLING BACK IN 

04:15:22.435 --> 04:15:24.435
TO GET STARTED AGAIN. 

04:15:27.877 --> 04:15:29.877
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:15:31.381 --> 04:15:34.631
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT, MR. 
CASTRO WILL NOW RETURN TO 

04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:40.434
ADDRESS ABOUT THE HARM PUT ON 
AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND 

04:15:40.577 --> 04:15:43.770
THE DAMAGE TO OUR INTERNATIONAL 
REPUTATION. 

04:15:55.558 --> 04:15:59.824
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY COLLEAGUES DISCUSS WITH 
YOU MANY HARMS TARNATION AS A 

04:16:00.586 --> 04:16:02.817
RESULT OF TRUMPS CONDUCT.

04:16:07.946 --> 04:16:10.195
NOW I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME 
TALKING ABOUT THE HARM TO 

04:16:10.396 --> 04:16:12.226
NATIONAL SECURITY AND ARE 
STANDING IN THE WORLD. WHEN 

04:16:12.227 --> 04:16:14.227
TRUMP INCITED A MOB

04:16:20.360 --> 04:16:22.593
HE LED TO NEW BUILDING THAT 
HOUSES SOME OF OUR NATION'S MOST

04:16:22.994 --> 04:16:27.260
SENSITIVE INFORMATION. CONSIDER 
WHO WAS PART OF THAT MOB? SOME 

04:16:27.464 --> 04:16:31.726
OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ON THE 
FBI WATCHLIST. THE PAST BEHAVIOR

04:16:31.927 --> 04:16:35.995
OF SOME INDIVIDUALS LED HERE BY 
TRUMP SO ALARMED INVESTIGATORS 

04:16:36.197 --> 04:16:40.059
THAT THEIR NAMES HAVE BEEN ADDED
TO THE NATIONAL TERRORIST 

04:16:40.819 --> 04:16:46.983
SCREENING DATABASE. IN AT LEAST 
ONE OF THE INSURRECTIONIST MAY 

04:16:47.185 --> 04:16:49.185
HAVE INTENDED TO STEAL 
INFORMATION AND GIVE IT TO A 

04:16:49.755 --> 04:16:54.287
FOREIGN ADVERSARY. ACCORDING TO 
CHARGING DOCUMENTS, RILEY 

04:16:54.487 --> 04:16:57.536
WILLIAMS ALLEGEDLY HELPED STEAL 
A LAPTOP FROM SPEAKER PELOSI'S 

04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:59.750
OFFICE TO QUOTE

04:17:02.619 --> 04:17:04.851
SEND THE COMPUTER DEVICE TO A 
FRIEND IN RUSSIA WHO THEN PLAN 

04:17:05.052 --> 04:17:07.052
TO SELL THE DEVICE TO SVR

04:17:12.978 --> 04:17:13.988
, RUSSIA'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE. 

04:17:13.989 --> 04:17:16.424
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN HOW
MANY FOREIGN SPIES INFILTRATED 

04:17:16.639 --> 04:17:18.955
THE CROWD OR AT LEAST 
COORDINATED WITH THOSE WHO DID

04:17:24.154 --> 04:17:26.791
, WE CAN BE SURE THAT ANY ALLEN 
ENEMY WHO HAD WANTED ACCESS TO 

04:17:26.992 --> 04:17:29.425
OUR SEEKERS WOULD HAVE WANTED TO
BE PART OF THAT MOB INSIDE THESE

04:17:29.640 --> 04:17:31.640
HALLS. AND THE POINT IS THIS.

04:17:35.926 --> 04:17:37.926
MANY OF THE INSURRECTIONIST THAT
TRUMP INCITED TO INVADE THIS 

04:17:37.956 --> 04:17:41.567
CHAMBER WERE DANGEROUS. PEOPLE 
IN THE FBI WATCHLIST, VIOLENT 

04:17:41.707 --> 04:17:43.707
EXTREMISTS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS

04:17:45.891 --> 04:17:49.602
, THESE INSURRECTIONIST INCITED 
BY TRUMP THREATENED OUR NATURAL 

04:17:50.300 --> 04:17:52.300
SECURITY.

04:17:54.823 --> 04:17:56.823
STEALING LAPTOPS AGAIN FROM 
SPEAKER PELOSI'S OFFICE, TAKING 

04:17:57.002 --> 04:18:01.727
DOCUMENTS FROM LEADER 
McCONNELL'S DESK. SNAPPING 

04:18:01.927 --> 04:18:03.927
PHOTOGRAPHS AS YOU SAW ON THE 
VIDEOS EARLIER

04:18:07.624 --> 04:18:11.275
IN SENSITIVE AREAS. RANSACKING 
OFFICES, RIFLING THROUGH DESKS. 

04:18:11.679 --> 04:18:13.679
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, 

04:18:13.712 --> 04:18:20.011
KNEW THE RISK OF ANYONE 
BREACHING THE CAPITAL. HE SWORE 

04:18:20.407 --> 04:18:25.494
AN OATH TO PRESERVE, PROTECT AND
DEFEND THIS COUNTRY. AND YET, HE

04:18:25.695 --> 04:18:31.592
INCITED THEM HERE. HE INCITED 
THEM TO BREAK INTO THE CAPITAL. 

04:18:31.993 --> 04:18:36.396
SENATORS, AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE 
HAVE SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

04:18:36.540 --> 04:18:43.777
BUILDING THE STRONGEST MILITARY 
IN THE WORLD. AND BILLIONS OF 

04:18:43.978 --> 04:18:45.978
DOLLARS ON THE MOST 
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY ON THE 

04:18:46.093 --> 04:18:51.895
PLANET. TO PREVENT THE KIND OF 
ATTACK THAT OCCURRED AT THIS 

04:18:52.109 --> 04:18:54.109
CAPITAL ON JANUARY 6.

04:18:57.994 --> 04:19:00.176
AND HERE IS WHAT THE 
INSURRECTIONIST INCITED BY TRUMP

04:19:00.330 --> 04:19:02.330
DID. 

04:19:27.846 --> 04:19:32.327
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN MANY WAYS, THIS ROOM IS 
SACRED AND SO ARE THE TRADITIONS

04:19:32.527 --> 04:19:36.248
THAT IT REPRESENTS. THEY HAVE 
BEEN CARRIED ON FOR CENTURIES

04:19:40.042 --> 04:19:44.508
. CONGRESS HAS DECLARED WAR 11 
TIMES ON THIS FLOOR, INCLUDING 

04:19:44.709 --> 04:19:46.709
ENTERING WORLD WAR II

04:19:49.390 --> 04:19:51.623
. WHEN CONGRESS PASSES THE CIVIL
RIGHTS ACT AND EXPANDS THE RIGHT

04:19:52.388 --> 04:19:56.694
TO VOTE TO ENSURE NO MATTER YOUR
RACE OR YOUR GENDER YOU HAVE A 

04:19:56.895 --> 04:20:00.958
VOICE IN OUR NATION. THIS FLOOR 
IS WHERE HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE. 

04:20:01.721 --> 04:20:03.721
AND NOW

04:20:05.425 --> 04:20:07.614
OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE THE 

04:20:07.755 --> 04:20:11.937
BURDEN TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY 
WHAT WAS STOLEN, TAKEN, 

04:20:12.137 --> 04:20:14.137
RANSACKED AND COMPROMISED.

04:20:16.602 --> 04:20:21.269
AS ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY 
EXPLAINED, MATERIALS WERE STOLEN

04:20:21.483 --> 04:20:23.483
AND WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT WAS
DONE

04:20:26.966 --> 04:20:29.346
, MITIGATE THAT AND IT COULD 
HAVE POTENTIAL NATIONAL SECURITY

04:20:29.485 --> 04:20:34.482
EQUITIES. THESE INVESTIGATIONS 
ARE NECESSARY NOW BECAUSE OF THE

04:20:34.683 --> 04:20:40.167
ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND 
IT WASN'T JUST THE PEOPLE THAT 

04:20:40.367 --> 04:20:42.367
HE LED HERE

04:20:45.034 --> 04:20:48.283
THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE 
TO LOOK INTO. IT IS ALSO WHAT 

04:20:48.498 --> 04:20:53.534
THEY TOOK AND WHAT THEY 
GATHERED? IT IS THE VERY FACT 

04:20:53.683 --> 04:20:55.683
THAT THIS BUILDING WAS SO MUCH 
SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND SOME 

04:20:56.158 --> 04:21:00.478
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THAT THIS
CAPITAL WAS BREACHED. AND THINK 

04:21:01.240 --> 04:21:05.559
ABOUT IT. EVERY FOREIGN 
ADVERSARY CONSIDERING ATTACKING 

04:21:06.317 --> 04:21:11.443
THIS BUILDING GOT TO WATCH A 
DRESS REHEARSAL AND THEY SAW 

04:21:11.646 --> 04:21:14.852
THAT THIS CAPITAL COULD BE 
OVERTAKEN.

04:21:19.161 --> 04:21:21.195
AS ELIZABETH NEWMAN, A FORMER 
TRUMPET AND OFFICIAL AS STATED. 

04:21:21.395 --> 04:21:25.207
QUOTE, YOU HAVE TERRORIST WHO 
WOULD LOVE TO DESTROY THE 

04:21:25.348 --> 04:21:30.284
CAPITAL. THEY JUST SAW HOW EASY 
IT WAS TO PENETRATE. WE JUST 

04:21:30.427 --> 04:21:36.737
EXPOSED A HUGE VULNERABILITY. 
AND AS SUCH IS THE CAPITAL.

04:21:40.294 --> 04:21:42.352
THIS ATTACK HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR
ALL GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS. 

04:21:42.727 --> 04:21:45.777
SENATOR RUBIO MADE THIS POINT 
WELL. 

04:21:52.877 --> 04:21:54.910
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU'RE AT TERRIERS RIGHT 
NOW SITTING OUT THERE AND 

04:21:55.125 --> 04:21:58.776
WATCHING IS NOT SO HARD TO GET 
INTO THE CAPITAL. MAYBE IT'S NOT

04:21:58.977 --> 04:22:01.286
THAT HARD TO GET INTO THE WHITE 
HOUSE OR THE SUPREME COURT 

04:22:01.527 --> 04:22:04.260
BUILDING OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR GOVERNMENT, OUR 

04:22:04.459 --> 04:22:08.526
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, A LAW 
ENFORCEMENT HAVE IMPLEMENTED 

04:22:08.726 --> 04:22:13.812
ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES SINCE
THE ATTACK ON JANUARY 6. BUT 

04:22:14.008 --> 04:22:16.042
WHAT WE SECURE HIS PHYSICAL 
SPACE WHAT MESSAGE WILL BE SEND 

04:22:16.244 --> 04:22:21.724
THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE 
ALREADY KNOW THAT THE MESSAGE 

04:22:21.925 --> 04:22:26.808
THE OTHER SERIES TOOK FROM 
JANUARY 6 IS HOW SOME OF THEM 

04:22:27.010 --> 04:22:29.010
RESPONDED AFTER THE ATTACK.

04:22:32.494 --> 04:22:37.160
QUOTE, FOR AMERICA'S ADVERSARIES
IS NO GREATER PROOF OF 

04:22:37.374 --> 04:22:39.374
FALLIBILITY OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY
THAN THE SIDE OF THE CAPITAL 

04:22:39.393 --> 04:22:43.762
SHROUDED IN SMOKE AND BESIEGED 
BY A MOB WHIPPED UP BY THEIR OWN

04:22:44.891 --> 04:22:46.891
UNWILLINGLY OUTGOING PRESIDENT.

04:22:50.976 --> 04:22:53.507
AND TO MAKE THAT MATTERS WORSE, 
ADVERSARIES ARE USING THE EVENTS

04:22:54.842 --> 04:22:56.886
OF JANUARY 6 NOT ONLY TO 
DENIGRATE AMERICA BUT TO JUSTIFY

04:22:57.644 --> 04:23:01.088
THEIR OWN ANTI-DEMOCRATIC 
BEHAVIOR CALLING AMERICA 

04:23:01.231 --> 04:23:06.102
HYPOCRITICAL. HERE'S WHAT THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING.

04:23:10.891 --> 04:23:12.891
CHINESE MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS OF THE CAPITAL RIOTS 

04:23:13.270 --> 04:23:15.311
SHOULD SPARK DEEP REFLECTION 
AMONG U.S.

04:23:19.623 --> 04:23:21.241
LAWMAKERS HOW THEY DISCUSS 
PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT IN HONG 

04:23:21.242 --> 04:23:24.493
KONG SUGGESTING THAT THE U.S. IS
HYPOCRITICAL IN ANNOUNCING 

04:23:24.694 --> 04:23:26.694
BEIJING'S CRACKDOWN IN THE CITY.

04:23:30.180 --> 04:23:32.180
OWN UNREST AT HOME. GLOBAL 
TIMES.

04:23:36.677 --> 04:23:38.309
OUTLET AFFILIATED WITH THE 
CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, EVEN 

04:23:38.310 --> 04:23:42.575
TWEETED A SERIES OF SIDE-BY-SIDE
PHOTOS OF TWO EVENTS, THE SIEGE 

04:23:42.778 --> 04:23:48.460
OF THE U.S. CAPITAL AND A JULY 
2019 INCIDENT IN WHICH 

04:23:48.662 --> 04:23:50.894
PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTERS IN HONG
KONG BROKE INTO THE CITY'S 

04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:53.422
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL BUILDING. 
THINK ABOUT THAT.

04:24:01.058 --> 04:24:03.093
PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT AN OPENING TO CREATE 

04:24:03.291 --> 04:24:05.291
A FALSE EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN

04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:11.207
HONG KONG IS PROTESTING FOR 
DEMOCRACY AND VIOLENT 

04:24:11.208 --> 04:24:14.056
INSURRECTIONIST TRYING TO 
OVERTHROW DEMOCRACY. AS 

04:24:14.257 --> 04:24:15.977
REPRESENTATIVE GALLAGHER 
DESCRIBED IN REAL TIME. 

04:24:15.978 --> 04:24:20.155
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE DON'T THINK OTHER 
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE 

04:24:20.355 --> 04:24:22.355
WATCHING THIS HAPPEN RIGHT NOW, 
WE DON'T THINK THE CHINESE 

04:24:22.590 --> 04:24:24.708
COMMUNIST PARTY IS SITTING BACK 
AND LAUGHING, WE ARE

04:24:28.890 --> 04:24:30.909
DELUDING OURSELVES. SO CALL IT 
OFF, MR. PRESIDENT, WE NEED YOU 

04:24:31.123 --> 04:24:33.123
TO CALL THIS OFF. 

04:24:36.606 --> 04:24:38.640
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RUSSIA HAS ALSO SEIZED ON THE
FILING ATTACK AGAINST OUR 

04:24:38.842 --> 04:24:41.019
GOVERNMENT DECRYING THE 
DEMOCRACY IS OVER.

04:24:49.604 --> 04:24:51.604
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE RUSSIAN 
UPPER HOUSE AT THE PARLIAMENT'S 

04:24:51.639 --> 04:24:53.672
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE 
SAID QUOTE, THE CELEBRATION OF 

04:24:53.873 --> 04:24:55.873
DEMOCRACY IS OVER.

04:24:58.941 --> 04:25:01.177
THIS IS OUR LAST, ACTUALLY THE 
BOTTOM. I SAY THIS WITHOUT A 

04:25:01.391 --> 04:25:06.058
HINT OF GLOATING. AMERICA IS NO 
LONGER CHARTING THE COURSE AND 

04:25:06.257 --> 04:25:10.725
THEREFORE HAS LOST ALL ITS 
RIGHTS TO SET IT. AND ALSO 

04:25:10.925 --> 04:25:16.144
WRITES TO IMPOSE IT ON OTHERS. 
THEY ARE USING TRUMPS 

04:25:16.276 --> 04:25:18.276
INCITEMENTS

04:25:22.510 --> 04:25:24.510
OF INSURRECTION TO DECLARE THAT 
DEMOCRACY IS OVER.

04:25:28.809 --> 04:25:30.809
IN IRAN, THE SUPREME LEADER IS 
USING TRUMPS INCITEMENT OF 

04:25:30.842 --> 04:25:32.842
INSURRECTION TO MOCK AMERICA.

04:25:35.509 --> 04:25:37.544
HE SAID THE SITUATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES, QUOTE, THIS IS 

04:25:37.744 --> 04:25:40.726
THEIR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS? THIS IS THEIR ELECTION 

04:25:40.865 --> 04:25:45.874
SCANDAL, THESE ARE THEIR VALUES.
THESE VALUES ARE BEING MOCKED BY

04:25:46.075 --> 04:25:49.727
THE WHOLE WORLD. EVEN THEIR 
FRIENDS. EVEN THEIR FRIENDS ARE 

04:25:49.945 --> 04:25:51.945
LAUGHING AT THEM.

04:25:54.609 --> 04:25:59.879
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE STATEMENTS ARE SERIOUS 
AND PERVASIVE. ACCORDING TO A 

04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:03.945
JOINT THREAT ASSESSMENT BULLETIN
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 

04:26:04.145 --> 04:26:06.884
SECURITY, FBI AND EIGHT OTHER 
LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES

04:26:10.857 --> 04:26:15.726
, QUOTE, SINCE THE CAPITAL ON 
JANUARY 6, RUSSIA, IRANIAN, 

04:26:15.928 --> 04:26:18.035
CHINESE INFLUENCE DOCTORS THAT 
SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMPLIFY

04:26:19.592 --> 04:26:21.592
NARRATIVES IN FURTHERANCE OF 
THEIR POLICY INTEREST AMID THE 

04:26:21.973 --> 04:26:23.973
RESIDENTIAL TRANSITION. 

04:26:27.708 --> 04:26:32.925
WE CANNOT LET THEM USE WHAT 
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6 TWO DEFINE

04:26:33.069 --> 04:26:36.243
US, WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND
FOR. 

04:26:39.894 --> 04:26:43.144
WE GET TO DEFINE OURSELVES BY 
HOW WE RESPOND TO THE ATTACK OF 

04:26:43.895 --> 04:26:45.895
JANUARY 6.

04:26:48.024 --> 04:26:50.177
SOME MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SAY AND
POINT OUT

04:26:53.923 --> 04:26:55.942
THAT HER ADVERSARIES ARE ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE CRITICAL OF THE 

04:26:56.693 --> 04:26:58.693
UNITED STATES.

04:27:00.624 --> 04:27:02.624
BEFORE AND INSURRECTION ON 
JANUARY 6, EVEN OUR ALLIES ARE 

04:27:03.207 --> 04:27:06.194
SPEAKING UP. CANADIAN PRIME 
MINISTER SAYS QUOTE

04:27:10.577 --> 04:27:13.154
, WHAT WE WITNESSED WAS AN 
ASSAULT ON DEMOCRACY BY VIOLENT 

04:27:13.292 --> 04:27:17.613
RIOTERS, INCITED BY THE CURRENT 
PRESIDENT AND OTHER POLITICIANS,

04:27:21.743 --> 04:27:23.574
SHOCKING, DEEPLY DISTURBING AND 
SADDENING AS THAT EVENT REMAINS 

04:27:23.575 --> 04:27:28.859
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THIS WEEK THAT
DEMOCRACY IS RESILIENT IN 

04:27:29.059 --> 04:27:33.125
AMERICA, OUR CLOSEST ALLY AND 
NEIGHBOR. THE GERMAN FOREIGN 

04:27:33.888 --> 04:27:35.888
MINISTER SAID

04:27:40.026 --> 04:27:41.846
QUOTE, THIS CLOSING OF RANKS 
BEGINS WITH HOLDING THOSE 

04:27:41.847 --> 04:27:47.127
ACCOUNTABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SUCH A GALATIANS. THAT INCLUDES 

04:27:47.342 --> 04:27:52.826
THE VIOLENT RIOTERS AND INCLUDES
THEIR INSTIGATORS. THE WORLD IS 

04:27:53.027 --> 04:28:00.544
WATCHING AND WONDERING WHETHER 
WE ARE WHO WE SAY WE ARE? 

04:28:01.503 --> 04:28:06.026
BECAUSE WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES 
HAVE KNOWN CHAOS, OUR 

04:28:06.228 --> 04:28:12.327
CONSTITUTION HAS HELPED KEEP 
ORDER IN AMERICA. THIS IS WHY WE

04:28:12.527 --> 04:28:14.527
HAVE A CONSTITUTION.

04:28:19.428 --> 04:28:22.076
WE MUST STAND UP FOR THE RULE OF
LAW BECAUSE THE RULE OF LAW 

04:28:22.277 --> 04:28:24.277
DOESN'T JUST STAND UP BY ITSELF.

04:28:30.808 --> 04:28:32.627
AFTER THE INSURRECTION MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THE HOUSE AFFAIRS 

04:28:32.628 --> 04:28:34.264
COMMITTEE, CHAIRMAN AND THE 
RANKING MEMBER ISSUED A 

04:28:34.265 --> 04:28:39.142
BIPARTISAN STATEMENT THAT SAID 
QUOTE, AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

04:28:39.342 --> 04:28:41.574
BEACON OF FREEDOM TO THE WORLD. 
PROOF THAT FREE AND FAIR 

04:28:42.333 --> 04:28:44.749
ELECTIONS ARE ACHIEVABLE AND 
DEMOCRACY WORKS.

04:28:50.107 --> 04:28:52.107
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAPITAL HAS
SCARRED HER REPUTATION AND 

04:28:52.128 --> 04:28:54.162
DAMAGED OUR STANDING IN THE 
WORLD. TODAY'S VIOLENCE, 

04:28:54.912 --> 04:28:59.190
INEVITABLE RESULT WHEN LEADERS 
AND POSITION OF POWER MISLED THE

04:28:59.351 --> 04:29:03.509
PUBLIC WILL CERTAINLY EMPOWER 
DICTATORS AND DAMAGE STRUGGLING 

04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:05.710
DEMOCRACIES. 

04:29:24.223 --> 04:29:29.403
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GIVES HOPE TO PEOPLE 
STRUGGLING FOR DEMOCRACY AND 

04:29:30.167 --> 04:29:33.692
AUTOCRATIC SHOULD CAME IT 
INSPIRES PEOPLE FIGHTING ACROSS 

04:29:33.893 --> 04:29:37.558
THE WORLD FOR FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS ELECTED INSPIRES US TO 

04:29:37.773 --> 04:29:43.902
BELIEVE IN SOMETHING LARGER THAN
OURSELVES. THIS TRIAL IS AN 

04:29:44.137 --> 04:29:48.743
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AND TO 
SEND A MESSAGE BACK TO THE 

04:29:48.945 --> 04:29:56.157
WORLD. I SAY THIS IS CELLULOSE 
MY COUNTRY OUR COUNTRY, JUST 

04:29:56.577 --> 04:30:03.417
ALL OF YOU DO. THERE IS A LOT OF
COURAGE IN THIS ROOM. A LOT OF 

04:30:03.626 --> 04:30:07.285
COURAGE THAT HAS BEEN 
DEMONSTRATED IN THE LIVES OF 

04:30:07.491 --> 04:30:15.908
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. SOME FOLKS 
HAVE STOOD UP FOR THE CIVIL 

04:30:16.213 --> 04:30:21.253
RIGHTS AND RISK CAREERS AND 
REPUTATIONS LIVELIHOODS AND 

04:30:21.451 --> 04:30:29.019
SAFETY STANDING UP FOR CIVIL 
RIGHTS. MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

04:30:29.826 --> 04:30:34.964
RISKED THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO
OUR COUNTRY. IN UNIFORM,

04:30:37.659 --> 04:30:41.645
AND JUNGLES OF VIETNAM 
PATROLLING MOUNTAINS OF 

04:30:41.847 --> 04:30:43.847
AFGHANISTAN.

04:30:45.617 --> 04:30:48.359
YOU SERVED OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE 
YOU WERE WILLING TO SACRIFICE 

04:30:48.555 --> 04:30:53.180
AND DEFEND OUR NATION AS WE KNOW
IT. AS THE WORLD KNOWS IT. 

04:30:54.146 --> 04:30:59.150
ALTHOUGH, MOST OF YOU HAVE 
TRADED IN YOUR UNIFORM FOR 

04:30:59.911 --> 04:31:01.911
PUBLIC SERVICE,

04:31:04.074 --> 04:31:06.074
YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU ONE MORE 
TIME.

04:31:11.462 --> 04:31:17.531
THE WORLD WATCHED RESIDENT TRUMP
TELL HIS BIG LIE. THE WORLD 

04:31:17.935 --> 04:31:23.851
WATCHED SUPPORTERS COME TO 
WASHINGTON AT HIS INVITATION THE

04:31:24.073 --> 04:31:27.510
WORLD WATCHED AS HE TOLD HIS 
SUPPORTERS, TO MARCH YEAR AT THE

04:31:27.709 --> 04:31:33.654
CAPITAL. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP OUR
COMMANDER IN CHIEF AT THE TIME 

04:31:33.970 --> 04:31:39.070
FAILED TO TAKE ANY ACTION TO 
DEFEND US. I THINK ACTUALLY 

04:31:39.283 --> 04:31:45.517
FAILED IN HIS DUTY TO PRESERVE 
PROTECT AND DEFEND NOW,

04:31:48.248 --> 04:31:50.248
WORLD IS WATCHING US WONDERING,

04:31:53.967 --> 04:31:56.595
WHAT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC
IS GOING TO RESPOND THE WAY IT 

04:31:56.887 --> 04:32:01.781
SHOULD. THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED 
TO. WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW WILL

04:32:02.025 --> 04:32:09.078
PREVAIL OVER MONGREL BECAUSE THE
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION HAS 

04:32:09.291 --> 04:32:11.683
CONSEQUENCES FAR BEYOND OUR OWN 
BORDERS

04:32:17.693 --> 04:32:19.910
. THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES TO 
OUR DIPLOMATS AND NEGOTIATORS AS

04:32:20.110 --> 04:32:22.416
THEY SIT AT TABLES AROUND THE 
WORLD TO ENFORCE OUR AGENDA ON 

04:32:22.617 --> 04:32:24.617
TRADE, THE ECONOMY, AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS.

04:32:28.081 --> 04:32:30.489
TWO FAILED TO CONVICT A 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

04:32:30.693 --> 04:32:34.050
WHO INCITED A DEADLY INTERACTION
WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH A 

04:32:34.811 --> 04:32:39.464
VIOLENT MOB INTERFERED WITH THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTORAL 

04:32:39.672 --> 04:32:41.672
COLLEGE VOTES WHO ADVOCATED

04:32:44.268 --> 04:32:46.342
HIS DUTY AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
WOULD BE TO FORFEIT THE POWER OF

04:32:46.539 --> 04:32:49.651
OUR EXAMPLE IS A NORTHSTAR ON 
FREEDOM DEMOCRACY HUMAN RIGHTS 

04:32:49.853 --> 04:32:55.093
AT THE MOST OF ALL, ON THE RULE 
OF LAW. TO CONVICT DONALD TRUMP 

04:32:55.710 --> 04:33:02.064
WOULD MEAN AMERICA STANDS FOR 
THE RULE OF LAW. NO MATTER WHO 

04:33:02.825 --> 04:33:07.955
VIOLATES IT. WHAT A SHOW THE 
WORLD JANUARY 6th WAS NOT 

04:33:08.271 --> 04:33:13.498
AMERICA. LET US REMIND THE WORLD
WE ARE TRULY THEIR NORTHSTAR.

04:33:24.782 --> 04:33:31.978
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPRESENTATIVE NICKERSON I 
WILL ADDRESS THE FIRST AMENDMENT

04:33:32.216 --> 04:33:36.554
ARGUMENT THAT IS OFFERED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LETTERS TO 

04:33:36.985 --> 04:33:42.267
EXCUSE HIS INCITEMENT TO THIS 
INSTRUCTION. 

04:33:42.268 --> 04:33:44.268
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:33:55.178 --> 04:34:00.063
WAS THE PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED
SENATORS, GOOD AFTERNOON. YOU 

04:34:00.277 --> 04:34:04.802
HAVE HEARD OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, THE 

04:34:05.023 --> 04:34:08.295
ROAMING EVIDENCE THAT RESIDENT 
TRUMP INCITED AN INSURRECTION. 

04:34:09.045 --> 04:34:13.749
AS RASKIN MENTIONED AS WE 
PREPARED TO CLOSE WE WOULD BE 

04:34:13.950 --> 04:34:18.957
REMISS BRIEFLY IF WE ADDRESS 
CURRENTLY THE PRINCIPAL DEFENSE 

04:34:19.158 --> 04:34:25.286
THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL OFFER TO
EXCUSE HIS CONDUCT THAT IS THIS 

04:34:26.043 --> 04:34:29.773
NOTION THAT HE CANNOT BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED ON

04:34:29.977 --> 04:34:35.510
JANUARY 6th THE CAUSE'S ACTIONS 
ARE SOMEHOW PROTECTED BY THE 

04:34:35.723 --> 04:34:40.471
FIRST AMENDMENT. NOW, LET'S STOP
A MOMENT AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND 

04:34:41.227 --> 04:34:43.227
THE ARGUMENT

04:34:45.402 --> 04:34:47.944
THAT THEY ARE MAKING. ACCORDING 
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, EVERYTHING 

04:34:48.651 --> 04:34:56.450
HE DID, EVERYTHING WE SHOWED YOU
HE DID, WAS PERFECTLY OKAY FOR 

04:34:56.651 --> 04:35:03.204
HIM TO DO. FOR A FUTURE 
PRESIDENT TO DO AGAIN. THE 

04:35:03.963 --> 04:35:10.194
CONSTITUTION APPARENTLY, IN 
THEIR VIEW FORBIDS YOU, FROM 

04:35:10.410 --> 04:35:12.410
DOING ANYTHING TO STOP IT.

04:35:16.536 --> 04:35:22.262
THAT CANNOT BE RIGHT. IT CANNOT 
BE. IT IS NOT RIGHT THEIR 

04:35:22.462 --> 04:35:27.780
ARGUMENT IS MEANT AS A 
DISTRACTION. THEY ARE CONCERNED 

04:35:28.188 --> 04:35:35.428
NOT WITH THE FACT THAT OCCURRED.
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PROVEN. 

04:35:35.842 --> 04:35:39.415
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP DID 
NOTHING BUT DELIVER IT 

04:35:40.117 --> 04:35:46.885
CONTROVERSIAL SPEECH AT A RALLY.
OF COURSE THAT IS NOT WHAT WE 

04:35:47.090 --> 04:35:49.313
HAVE CHARGED IN THE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT IT IS NOT WHAT 

04:35:49.525 --> 04:35:54.762
HAPPENED. YOU WILL HEAR FROM MY 
COLLEAGUE RASKIN THE MANY MYRIAD

04:35:55.337 --> 04:36:03.524
REASONS WHY THIS ARGUMENT THEY 
MAKE IS WRONG COMPLETELY. NOT 

04:36:03.941 --> 04:36:10.286
AROUND THE EDGES. MAJOR, 
FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKES OF 

04:36:10.503 --> 04:36:14.189
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, THE KIND 
RASKIN TELLS ME WOULD NOT CUT IT

04:36:14.388 --> 04:36:20.696
IN HIS FIRST YEAR LAW COURSE OF 
COURSE HE WOULD KNOW SINCE HE 

04:36:20.904 --> 04:36:27.631
HAS TAUGHT THE SUBJECT FOR 
DECADES. THAT EXPLAINS WHY SO 

04:36:28.411 --> 04:36:32.768
MANY LAWYERS WHO HAVE DEDICATED 
THEIR LIVES TO PROTECTING FREE 

04:36:33.268 --> 04:36:36.549
SPEECH INCLUDING MANY OF THE 
NATIONS MOST PROMINENT 

04:36:36.772 --> 04:36:40.069
CONSERVATIVE FREE-SPEECH LAWYERS
HAVE DESCRIBED PRESIDENT

04:36:43.807 --> 04:36:48.502
TRUMP'S FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIMS 
AS QUOTE, LEGALLY FRIVOLOUS. 

04:36:48.741 --> 04:36:50.895
JULIE ANOTHER QUOTE FROM RECENT 
LETTER PROMINENT FREE-SPEECH 

04:36:51.136 --> 04:36:55.384
LAWYERS THEY QUOTE THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT IS NO BAR TO THE 

04:36:55.593 --> 04:36:59.378
SENATE CONVICTING FORMER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

04:36:59.584 --> 04:37:01.584
DISQUALIFYING HIM FROM HOLDING

04:37:04.699 --> 04:37:08.956
DUE DILIGENCE. THERE ARGUMENT IS
WRONG ON FACTS, WRONG ON THE LAW

04:37:10.036 --> 04:37:15.570
AND WOULD FLIP THE CONSTITUTION 
UPSIDE DOWN. LET'S START WITH 

04:37:16.308 --> 04:37:21.922
THE FACTS. BECAUSE AS YOU WILL 
SEE, HIS FREE-SPEECH CLAIM 

04:37:22.124 --> 04:37:27.773
DEPEND ON AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE 
DID THAT HAS NO BASIS IN THE 

04:37:27.994 --> 04:37:33.494
EVIDENCE TO HEAR HIS LAWYER TELL
IT, HE WAS SOME GUY AT A RALLY 

04:37:34.126 --> 04:37:40.325
EXPRESSING UNPOPULAR OPINIONS 
THEY WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THIS

04:37:40.559 --> 04:37:44.882
IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE HE SAID 
THINGS THAT ONE MAY DISAGREE 

04:37:45.393 --> 04:37:52.459
WITH. REALLY? MAKE NO MISTAKE. 
THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO AVOID 

04:37:52.883 --> 04:37:58.409
TALKING ABOUT THE FACTS OF THIS 
CASE THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU

04:38:02.061 --> 04:38:04.588
INSTEAD WE EXPECT THEY WILL TALK
ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER SPEECHES 

04:38:04.790 --> 04:38:08.522
INCLUDING SOME GIVEN BY 
DEMOCRATIC OFFICIALS THEY WILL 

04:38:08.833 --> 04:38:13.497
INSIST FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTS 
ALL OF THIS AS THOUGH IT WERE 

04:38:13.700 --> 04:38:19.622
EXACTLY THE SAME. WE TRUST YOU 
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE 

04:38:19.826 --> 04:38:24.943
YOU HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE THAT 
WE HAVE SEEN. 

04:38:26.201 --> 04:38:29.539
WE HAVE PROVEN OVER THE LAST 
THREE DAYS, HIS ARGUMENTS 

04:38:30.037 --> 04:38:33.962
COMPLETELY DO NOT DESCRIBE THE 
REALITY WHAT HAPPENED

04:38:38.291 --> 04:38:40.291
ON JANUARY 6th. THEY LEAVE OUT 
EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS ABOUT 

04:38:40.497 --> 04:38:45.487
WHY WE ARE HERE AND WHAT HE DID.
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT 

04:38:45.695 --> 04:38:49.471
JUST SOME GUY POLITICAL OPINIONS
WHO SHOWED UP AT A RALLY ON 

04:38:49.997 --> 04:38:56.168
JANUARY 6th AND DELIVERED 
CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS. HE WAS 

04:38:56.374 --> 04:39:00.798
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. HE HAD SPENT MONTHS, 

04:39:01.019 --> 04:39:09.027
MONTHS, USING UNIQUE POWER OF 
THAT OFFICE. HIS BULLY PULPIT TO

04:39:09.232 --> 04:39:14.056
SPREAD THAT BIG LIE AT THE 
ELECTION IT HAD BEEN STOLEN TO 

04:39:14.262 --> 04:39:17.920
CONVINCE HIS FOLLOWERS TO STOP 
THE STEEL TO ASSEMBLE THEM 

04:39:18.529 --> 04:39:24.922
BLOCKS AWAY FROM HERE ON JANUARY
6 AT THE VERY MOMENT WE WERE 

04:39:25.130 --> 04:39:31.175
MEETING TO COUNT THE ELECTRICAL 
COLLEGE VOTES WORKING NEW IT HAD

04:39:31.404 --> 04:39:34.713
BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THEY WERE 
PRIMED AND EAGER AND READY FOR 

04:39:34.929 --> 04:39:42.242
VIOLENCE AT HIS SIGNAL. AND MEN,
STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT 

04:39:42.898 --> 04:39:44.898
EXPLOSIVE SITUATION, AND THAT 
POWDER CAKE

04:39:49.247 --> 04:39:51.371
THAT HE HAD CREATED OVER THE 
COURSE OF MONTHS, BEFORE A 

04:39:51.591 --> 04:39:54.961
CROWD, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
POSED FOR VIOLENCE, AT HIS 

04:39:55.165 --> 04:39:58.650
SIGNAL, HE STRUCK A MATCH.

04:40:02.169 --> 04:40:06.116
HE AIMED IT STRAIGHT AT THIS 
BUILDING. AT US. YOU HAVE SEEN 

04:40:06.853 --> 04:40:11.881
ALL THAT EVIDENCE. THERE IS NO 
DENYING. THAT'S WHY HOUSE 

04:40:12.657 --> 04:40:15.310
IMPEACHED HIM. THAT'S WHY HE'S 
ON TRIAL.

04:40:18.845 --> 04:40:24.762
NO PRESIDENT, NO MATTER 
POLITICS, THE POLITICS OF THEIR 

04:40:25.194 --> 04:40:28.048
ALWAYS CONSERVATIVE, LIBERAL, OR
ANYTHING ELSE, NO PRESIDENT CAN 

04:40:28.254 --> 04:40:32.771
DO WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP DID. 
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ABOUT 

04:40:32.971 --> 04:40:37.642
POLITICS. IT'S ABOUT HIS REFUSAL
TO ACCEPT THE OUTCOME OF THE 

04:40:37.861 --> 04:40:41.350
ELECTION AND HIS DECISION TO 
INCITE AN INSTRUCTION. THERE'S 

04:40:41.747 --> 04:40:44.798
NO SERIOUS ADAMANT THAT THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTS THAT. 

04:40:45.202 --> 04:40:50.470
IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY 
DANGEROUS FOR THE UNITED STATES 

04:40:50.675 --> 04:40:56.654
SENATE TO CONCLUDE OTHERWISE. TO
TELL FUTURE PRESIDENTS

04:41:01.226 --> 04:41:03.539
THAT THEY CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AND GET AWAY

04:41:04.241 --> 04:41:11.004
WITH IT. TO SET THE PRECEDENT 
THAT THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE NOW 

04:41:11.608 --> 04:41:15.619
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED 
WEIGHT TO RESPOND TO LOSING AN 

04:41:15.844 --> 04:41:18.701
ELECTION. YOU WILL NOTE 
SOMETHING.

04:41:23.649 --> 04:41:29.755
BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR COMES LAWYERS DISAGREE. 

04:41:30.359 --> 04:41:33.172
THEY DON'T INSIST THE FACTS WE 
HAVE CHARGED, THE FACTS WE HAVE 

04:41:33.375 --> 04:41:38.173
PROVEN, THE FACTS SUPPORTED BY 
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE ARE TRUE. 

04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:45.404
OF COURSE YOU NOW KNOW THEY ARE.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. THEY

04:41:45.603 --> 04:41:50.051
ARE NOT ARGUING IT IS OKAY OR A 
PERSON TO INCITE A MOB VIOLENCE.

04:41:50.897 --> 04:41:54.994
I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE ARGUING 
THAT. INSTEAD WHAT THEY ARE 

04:41:55.215 --> 04:41:57.605
DOING IS OFFERING A RADICALLY 
DIFFERENT VERSION OF WHAT 

04:41:57.803 --> 04:42:03.142
HAPPENED THAT DAY. TOTALLY 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE EVIDENCE. 

04:42:03.545 --> 04:42:08.261
THEN, THEY INSIST THAT FICTIONAL
VERSION OF EVENTS THAT ALTERNATE

04:42:08.468 --> 04:42:11.068
REALITY IS TRUE, WELL THEN,

04:42:14.797 --> 04:42:16.881
IT MAY BE PROTECTED BY THE FIRST
AMENDMENT. THAT'S THE ARGUMENT. 

04:42:17.084 --> 04:42:23.205
YOU ARE HERE TO ADJUDICATE REAL 
EVIDENCE. REAL FACTS. NOT 

04:42:23.964 --> 04:42:29.510
HYPOTHETICAL ONES. FOR THAT 
REASON ALONE, YOU SHOULD REJECT 

04:42:29.915 --> 04:42:35.172
THEIR ARGUMENT BECAUSE HE'S 
ADVANCED TO DEFEND THE SITUATION

04:42:36.249 --> 04:42:40.272
THERE IS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE 
ACTUAL FACT OF THIS CASE. WITH 

04:42:40.476 --> 04:42:45.110
THAT, WHAT TO TURN IT OVER TO MY
COLLEAGUE AT RASKIN TO ADDRESS 

04:42:45.324 --> 04:42:50.629
THE MANY LEGAL FLAWS A MENTION 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POSITION. 

04:42:51.592 --> 04:43:00.595
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO MR. NEGUSE  EXPLAINED HIS 
LAST DITCH FIRST AMENDMENT 

04:43:01.008 --> 04:43:03.461
ARGUMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
THE FACTS OF THE CASE. HE HAS 

04:43:03.657 --> 04:43:06.536
BEEN IMPEACHED FOR INCITING 
VIOLENCE AGAINST GOVERNMENT 

04:43:07.139 --> 04:43:11.568
INCITEMENT TO PILOT INSTRUCTION 
IS NOT PROTECTED BY

04:43:17.821 --> 04:43:19.821
FREE SPEECH AND THERE'S NO FIRST
AMENDMENT DEFENSE TO IMPEACHMENT

04:43:19.983 --> 04:43:21.983
FOR HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS. THE IDEA IS 

04:43:22.077 --> 04:43:24.137
ABSURD. THE WHOLE FIRST 
AMENDMENT SMOKESCREEN IS 

04:43:24.348 --> 04:43:29.305
IRRELEVANT A DISTRACTION FROM A 
STANDARD OF HIGH CRIMES AND 

04:43:29.520 --> 04:43:33.617
MISDEMEANORS GOVERNING A 
PRESIDENT WHO IS VIOLATED HIS 

04:43:33.819 --> 04:43:37.296
OFFICE YET, PRESIDENT TRUMP WE 
KNOW, IS A GOOD WAY OF SAYING 

04:43:37.502 --> 04:43:40.241
RON IS RIGHT AND UP IS DOWN. 
HE'S TRYING TO PULL OFF THE 

04:43:40.900 --> 04:43:43.368
BIGGEST ELECTION FRAUD IN THE 
HISTORY OF AMERICAN BY

04:43:47.097 --> 04:43:49.097
OVERTURNING THE RESULTS OF THE 
ELECTION. EVEN AS HE INSISTED 

04:43:49.288 --> 04:43:51.781
HIS OWN FRAUD WAS IN FACT AN 
EFFORT TO STOP THE STEEL. TO 

04:43:51.985 --> 04:43:57.734
STOP A FRAUD. A VAST CONSPIRACY 
HE BLAMED ON LOCAL AND STATE

04:44:03.101 --> 04:44:04.800
OFFICIALS, THE MEDIA, ELECTION 
OFFICIALS FEDERAL, STATE MEMBERS

04:44:04.801 --> 04:44:09.251
OF CONGRESS AND ANYBODY WHO GOT 
ALONG WITH HIM IS PART OF THE 

04:44:09.451 --> 04:44:13.683
CONSPIRACY. HE VIOLATED OFFICE 
BY INCITING MOB VIOLENCE FROM 

04:44:13.894 --> 04:44:20.938
COUNTING ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES
BY THE 12th AMENDMENT COUNT ACT.

04:44:21.140 --> 04:44:26.050
EVEN AS HE ATTACKED VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE AT A RALLY FOR 

04:44:26.457 --> 04:44:31.133
VIOLATING HIS OATH OF OFFICE. 
GOING ALONG WITH AN EGREGIOUS 

04:44:31.333 --> 04:44:36.849
ASSAULT ON DEMOCRACY. NOW HE 
ARGUES CONGRESS IS VIOLATING HIS

04:44:37.597 --> 04:44:42.798
FREE-SPEECH RIGHTS, WHEN IT WAS 
DONALD TRUMP WHO INCITED THE 

04:44:43.001 --> 04:44:46.489
INSURRECTION AS AN ATTACK 
AGAINST US IN HALTED SPEECH AND 

04:44:46.696 --> 04:44:48.987
DEBATE ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE
AND SENATE DURING THE PEACEFUL 

04:44:49.194 --> 04:44:52.353
TRANSFER OF POWER AND IT 
IMPERILED THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

04:44:52.576 --> 04:44:58.775
ORDER THAT PROTECTS FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH IN THE FIRST PLACE ALONG 

04:44:58.977 --> 04:45:02.922
WITH ALL OUR OTHER FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHTS. AS A MATTER OF LAW, IT'S

04:45:03.136 --> 04:45:10.341
A MATTER OF LOGIC HIS BRAZEN 
ATTEMPT TO NOTE THE FIRST MEMO 

04:45:10.543 --> 04:45:16.306
THAT I WILL NOT HOLD UP IN ANY 
WAY. IT COMPLETELY IGNORES THE 

04:45:17.022 --> 04:45:24.311
FACT THAT HE WAS THE PRESIDENT A
PUBLIC OFFICIAL. HE SWEARS AN 

04:45:24.527 --> 04:45:29.192
OATH AS THE PRESIDENT. NOBODY 
ELSE SWEARS AND IN EXCHANGE HE'S

04:45:29.393 --> 04:45:34.080
GIVEN GREATER POWER THAN ANYBODY
IN THE COUNTRY. HE OR SHE 

04:45:34.292 --> 04:45:40.033
PROMISES TO PRESERVE, PROTECT 
AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AND 

04:45:40.241 --> 04:45:45.816
OUR GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND 
PEOPLE. AS WE KNOW, THE POWER TO

04:45:46.022 --> 04:45:48.418
ADDRESS PEOPLE IN PUBLIC 
GOVERNMENT OFFICE ESPECIALLY

04:45:52.998 --> 04:45:55.265
COMES WITH SPECIAL OBLIGATION TO
UPHOLD LAWS AND INTEGRITY OF OUR

04:45:55.471 --> 04:45:59.553
REPUBLIC. WE ALL SWEAR THAT. 
WHAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 

04:46:00.516 --> 04:46:02.516
PUBLICLY

04:46:04.860 --> 04:46:07.041
ON A DAILY BASIS ADVOCATED 
REPLACING THE CONSTITUTION WITH 

04:46:07.342 --> 04:46:13.468
A TOTALITARIAN FORM OF 
GOVERNMENT? HE SWORE AND OATH OF

04:46:13.669 --> 04:46:17.863
LOYALTY TO US WARREN FOREIGN 
LEADER? AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN YOU

04:46:18.177 --> 04:46:20.177
GOT

04:46:25.477 --> 04:46:27.477
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT PEOPLE 
USING THOSE WORDS TO ADVOCATE 

04:46:27.549 --> 04:46:29.299
TOTALITARIANISM. TO ADVOCATE 
SECESSION FROM THE UNION. TO 

04:46:29.300 --> 04:46:34.484
SWEAR AN OATH OF PERSONAL 
LOYALTY TO A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 

04:46:34.687 --> 04:46:36.535
OR COUNTRY THAT'S TOTALLY 
PROTECTED. IF YOU TRIED TO 

04:46:36.536 --> 04:46:38.923
PROSECUTE SOMEBODY FOR THAT, YOU
WOULD LOSE. IT IS SIMPLY 

04:46:39.229 --> 04:46:41.229
INCONCEIVABLE

04:46:42.460 --> 04:46:44.854
, UNTHINKABLE, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT COULD DO ANY OF THESE 

04:46:45.056 --> 04:46:47.951
THINGS GET UP AND SWEAR AN OATH 
TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR LEADERS

04:46:51.067 --> 04:46:54.485
ADVOCATE TOTALITARIANISM NOT BE 
IMPEACHED FOR IT. IT'S 

04:46:54.690 --> 04:47:00.491
UNTHINKABLE. THAT WOULD VIOLATE 
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS? THE 

04:47:01.256 --> 04:47:06.672
OPPOSITE VIEW BY TRUMP'S 
COUNSEL, WOULD LEAVE THE NATION 

04:47:06.879 --> 04:47:09.507
POWERLESS TO RESPOND TO A 
PRESIDENT WHO USES THE UNMATCHED

04:47:09.717 --> 04:47:15.264
POWER, PRIVILEGE, AND PRESTIGE 
OF HIS OR HER OFFICE BULLY OPEN 

04:47:15.675 --> 04:47:23.333
IN WAYS THAT RISK THE RUIN OF 
THE REPUBLIC. ALL FOR HIS OR HER

04:47:23.958 --> 04:47:29.762
OWN AMBITION. LUST FOR POWER. 
EVERYONE SHOULD BE CLEAR. IT IS 

04:47:30.494 --> 04:47:35.180
NOT THE REMOTELY EXOTIC ABOUT 
WHAT WE SAY. IT SHOULD BE COMMON

04:47:35.419 --> 04:47:39.138
SENSE TO EVERYBODY. COMMON 
SENSE. ABOUT THIS UNDERSTANDING 

04:47:39.342 --> 04:47:43.990
OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT APPLIES 
TO COPS, FIREFIGHTERS EVERYBODY.

04:47:46.629 --> 04:47:50.919
MY DAUGHTER WAS MENTIONED AS A 
TEACHER IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL.

04:47:56.076 --> 04:47:57.990
TEACHERS TEACH BUT THINK OFF 
SCRIPT AND ADVOCATING 

04:47:57.991 --> 04:47:59.991
TOTALITARIANISM, TREASON OR WHAT
HAVE YOU,

04:48:05.683 --> 04:48:08.018
THEY ARE NOT LIVING UP TO THE 
DUTIES OF THEIR OFFICE TO 

04:48:08.222 --> 04:48:10.798
TEACHERS, THEY CAN BE FIRED. 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. IT HAPPENS

04:48:11.007 --> 04:48:15.275
ALL THE TIME. INCLUDING TWO COPS
AND

04:48:22.290 --> 04:48:24.603
FIREFIGHTERS AND PEOPLE IN THE 
FRONT LINES. IN FACT IT HAPPENED

04:48:24.807 --> 04:48:26.807
COUNTLESS TIMES TWO PEOPLE FIRED
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 

04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:29.649
STATEMENTS ARE THERE OWN IDEAS 
ABOUT THINGS INCLUDING ON 

04:48:29.853 --> 04:48:34.257
ELECTION FRAUD. NOT LONG AGO. 
PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO 

04:48:34.454 --> 04:48:36.454
LOST

04:48:38.398 --> 04:48:41.010
THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT
DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY SAID. NOW,

04:48:42.274 --> 04:48:48.190
AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY, I 
CANNOT HELP BUT REPEAT, SCALIA 

04:48:48.404 --> 04:48:53.103
WAS RIGHT. SHE WROTE ON THESE 
CASES ABOUT HOW THE FIRST 

04:48:53.311 --> 04:48:55.696
AMENDMENT AFFECTS PEOPLE WHO 
TAKE ON PUBLIC OFFICE. THEY TAKE

04:48:55.921 --> 04:49:00.273
ON PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. HE SUMMED 
IT UP LIKE THIS. HE SAID CANNOT 

04:49:00.491 --> 04:49:02.491
WRITE WITH COMPS BUT

04:49:12.909 --> 04:49:15.245
ROOT FOR THE ROBBERS. YOU CANNOT
WRITE WITH COMPS BUT ROOT FOR 

04:49:15.444 --> 04:49:17.476
THE ROBBERS. THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE
SCALIA SAID. WHEN IT COMES TO 

04:49:17.671 --> 04:49:19.737
PEACEFUL TRANSFER POWER TO THE 
RULE OF LAW, TO RESPECT AND 

04:49:19.942 --> 04:49:23.016
ELECTION OUTCOME, OUR PRESIDENT 
WEBER HE OR SHE IS, MUST CHOOSE 

04:49:23.230 --> 04:49:26.593
THE SIDE OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
PLUS, NOT THE SIDE OF THE 

04:49:27.336 --> 04:49:29.609
INSURRECTION OR TO OR ANYBODY 
COMING AGAINST US

04:49:32.715 --> 04:49:35.343
. IF HE OR SHE CHOOSES THE WRONG
SIDE, I'M SORRY.

04:49:39.710 --> 04:49:41.710
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT OR ANYWHERE ELSE, THAT

04:49:41.753 --> 04:49:44.745
CAN EXCUSE YOUR BETRAYAL OF YOUR
OFFICE. IT'S NOT A FREE-SPEECH 

04:49:44.945 --> 04:49:46.945
QUESTION.

04:49:50.138 --> 04:49:54.320
LET'S PLAY MAKE-BELIEVE AND 
PRETEND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A 

04:49:54.968 --> 04:49:59.939
PRIVATE CITIZEN. JUST ANOTHER 
GUY AT THE RALLY. HE'S 

04:50:00.140 --> 04:50:02.140
EXPRESSING A DEEPLY UNPOPULAR 
OPINION BECAUSE SHOULD NOT 

04:50:02.377 --> 04:50:04.377
OVERLOOK

04:50:09.896 --> 04:50:12.159
WHILE THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE IN THE VIOLENT MOB THEY 

04:50:12.363 --> 04:50:14.589
REPRESENT A TINY, TINY, TINY 
PART OF LESS THAN 1% OF THE 

04:50:14.787 --> 04:50:16.955
POPULATION OF THE VAST MAJORITY 
OF AMERICANS WHO REJECT THE 

04:50:17.159 --> 04:50:19.159
SEDITIOUS MOB VIOLENCE THAT WE 
SAW DINNER SIX.

04:50:23.078 --> 04:50:26.764
BUT, LET'S SAY, YOU ARE ANOTHER 
GUY IN THE CROWD. IT IS A 

04:50:27.732 --> 04:50:29.732
BEDROCK PRINCIPLE THAT NOBODY

04:50:33.869 --> 04:50:36.723
NOBODY CAN INCITE A RIOT. FIRST 
AMENDMENT DOES NOT PROTECT IT. 

04:50:36.918 --> 04:50:42.882
BRANDENBURG VERSUS OHIO. NO 
FIRST AMENDMENT FOR SPEECH FOR 

04:50:43.862 --> 04:50:45.862
PRODUCING

04:50:48.184 --> 04:50:50.184
IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION. FOR ALL
THE REASONS YOU HAVE HEARD, 

04:50:50.278 --> 04:50:53.416
BASED ON THE COMPREHENSIVE, 
TOTALLY

04:51:01.413 --> 04:51:03.279
UNREPEATABLE IRREFUTABLE BASED 
ON ALL EVIDENCE YOU HAVE HEARD, 

04:51:03.280 --> 04:51:05.280
AND ALL THE REASONS YOU EVER 
HEARD, THAT DEFINITION OF 

04:51:05.325 --> 04:51:07.325
PRESCRIBED MOBILE SPEECH FITS

04:51:10.001 --> 04:51:12.001
THE CONDUCT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 
PERFECTLY. THIS IS A CLASSIC 

04:51:12.136 --> 04:51:16.690
CASE OF INCITEMENT. YOU DO NOT 
HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD. THE 144

04:51:20.186 --> 04:51:22.186
FREE-SPEECH LAWYERS THAT INCLUDE
MANY OF THE NATION'S MOST 

04:51:22.592 --> 04:51:24.592
DEDICATED, MOST

04:51:27.571 --> 04:51:29.494
UNCOMPROMISING FREE-SPEECH 
ADVOCATES, UNLIKE MR. TRUMP, OF 

04:51:29.495 --> 04:51:31.495
COURSE, THESE PEOPLE AGREE, 
THERE IS A POWERFUL CASE FOR 

04:51:31.638 --> 04:51:33.638
CONVICTION

04:51:40.500 --> 04:51:42.625
UNDER THE BRANDENBURG STANDARD. 
EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT WERE TO BE

04:51:42.826 --> 04:51:44.870
TREATED LIKE SOME GUY IN THE 
CROWD. THEY ADD, THE FIRST 

04:51:45.093 --> 04:51:47.093
AMENDMENT IS NO DEFENSE TO THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT LEVELED 

04:51:47.114 --> 04:51:50.732
AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT. I 
MENTIONED THE BRANDENBURG 

04:51:50.931 --> 04:51:53.102
STANDARD NOT BECAUSE THE PIPE 
BUT IT IS AN

04:51:56.836 --> 04:51:58.836
IMPEACHMENT NOT A CRIMINAL 
TRIAL. THERE IS NO JAIL TIME 

04:51:58.880 --> 04:52:01.717
RISK. THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT GO 
TO JAIL FOR ONE HOUR OR ONE DAY 

04:52:01.918 --> 04:52:05.531
OR ONE MINUTE BASED ON 
IMPEACHMENT AND CONVICTION. IT 

04:52:05.748 --> 04:52:12.531
IS DISQUALIFICATION OR I 
MENTIONED IT TO EMPHASIZE NOBODY

04:52:12.735 --> 04:52:16.845
IN AMERICA WOULD BE PROTECTED BY
THE FIRST AMENDMENT IF THEY DID 

04:52:17.252 --> 04:52:21.753
ALL THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP DID.
NOBODY MADE HIM RUN FOR 

04:52:22.517 --> 04:52:28.248
PRESIDENT OR SWEAR AN OATH IN 
2017 BUT WHEN HE DID BY SWEARING

04:52:28.459 --> 04:52:30.459
THAT

04:52:34.032 --> 04:52:36.579
OATH AND ENTERING THIS HIGH 
OFFICE, HE TOOK A DUTY ON 

04:52:36.796 --> 04:52:39.106
HIMSELF TO AFFIRM AND TAKE CARE 
THAT OUR LAWS WOULD BE 

04:52:39.316 --> 04:52:43.175
FAITHFULLY EXECUTED UNDER HIS 
LEADERSHIP. ALL OF THE LAWS. THE

04:52:43.376 --> 04:52:48.305
LAWS AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF 
PROPERTY. ALL OF THE LAWS.

04:52:52.211 --> 04:52:54.664
WE EXPECTED HIM IN EVERY THING 
HE SAID AND DID TO PROTECT AND 

04:52:54.867 --> 04:52:56.867
PRESERVE AND DEFEND

04:52:59.563 --> 04:53:01.183
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. THAT 
INCLUDES THE SEPARATION OF 

04:53:01.184 --> 04:53:05.768
POWER. INSTEAD, HE BETRAYED US. 
IT WAS THE GREATEST BETRAYAL OF 

04:53:05.964 --> 04:53:09.911
A PRESIDENTIAL OATH IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF 

04:53:10.108 --> 04:53:16.370
AMERICA. THE GREATEST. AS I 
MENTIONED YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT 

04:53:16.776 --> 04:53:21.938
TRUMP IS NOT CLOSE TO THE 
PROVERBIAL CITIZEN THAT SHOUTS 

04:53:22.342 --> 04:53:24.992
FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER. HE'S 
LIKE THE NOW PROVERBIAL 

04:53:25.394 --> 04:53:29.427
MUNICIPAL FIRE CHIEF WHO INCITES
A MOB TO SET THE THEATER ON FIRE

04:53:29.632 --> 04:53:31.632
AND

04:53:33.146 --> 04:53:35.616
NOT ONLY REFUSES TO PUT THE FIRE
OUT BUT ENCOURAGES THE MOB TO 

04:53:36.009 --> 04:53:41.285
KEEP GOING AS THE BLAZE SPREADS.
WE WOULD HOLD THAT FIRE CHIEF 

04:53:41.484 --> 04:53:44.839
ACCOUNTABLE. WE WOULD FOR 
VICTIMS FROM MY JOB EVER AGAIN 

04:53:45.035 --> 04:53:49.716
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MUST 
HAPPEN HERE. THERE ARE HUNDREDS 

04:53:49.937 --> 04:53:54.096
OF MILLIONS OF CITIZENS AND 
DONALD TRUMP HAS DISQUALIFIED 

04:53:54.299 --> 04:53:59.104
HIMSELF AND YOU MUST DISQUALIFY 
HIM TOO. JUST LIKE THE FIRE 

04:53:59.864 --> 04:54:04.619
CHIEF, SENDS THE MOB TRUMP 
PERVERTED HIS OFFICE BY TACKING

04:54:09.597 --> 04:54:11.640
THE VERY CONSTITUTION HE WAS 
SWORN TO UPHOLD. IN FACT THAT'S 

04:54:12.121 --> 04:54:14.712
ONE REASON WHY THIS FREE-SPEECH 
RHETORIC IS INSIDIOUS. HIS 

04:54:14.917 --> 04:54:19.759
CONTACT REPRESENTED THE MOST 
DANGEROUS ASSAULT BY GOVERNMENT 

04:54:19.976 --> 04:54:25.490
OFFICIAL ON OUR CONSTITUTION 
INCLUDING THE FIRST AMENDMENT IN

04:54:25.709 --> 04:54:29.175
LIVING MEMORY. WE WOULDN'T HAVE 
FREE-SPEECH OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS 

04:54:29.389 --> 04:54:32.656
IF WE DID NOT HAVE THE RULE OF 
LAW PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER 

04:54:33.081 --> 04:54:35.081
IN A DEMOCRACY

04:54:37.540 --> 04:54:39.540
WHERE THE OUTCOME OF THE 
ELECTION IS ACCEPTED BY THE 

04:54:39.589 --> 04:54:45.948
CANDIDATE WHO LOST. WE HAD IT UP
UNTIL 2020. THE ESSENTIAL 

04:54:46.144 --> 04:54:51.245
PURPOSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT  
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND CIVIC 

04:54:52.003 --> 04:54:56.778
TRUTH SEEKING. TWO PURPOSES THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SOUGHT TO 

04:54:57.186 --> 04:54:59.186
UNDERMINE NOT ADVANCE.

04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:06.910
AS HE DEMONSTRATED AND THE 
VIOLENCE INSIDE THE THREATENED 

04:55:07.300 --> 04:55:10.792
DOLLAR FREEDOMS. HE THREATENED 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER THAT 

04:55:10.997 --> 04:55:14.681
PROTECTS FREE SPEECH, DUE 
PROCESS RELIGIOUS FREE EXERCISE,

04:55:14.875 --> 04:55:17.524
THE RIGHT TO VOTE, AND MANY 
OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WE 

04:55:17.728 --> 04:55:19.728
TREASURE AND CHERISH.

04:55:25.055 --> 04:55:26.888
THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT 
CREATE SOME SUPERPOWER IMMUNITY 

04:55:26.889 --> 04:55:31.184
FROM IMPEACHMENT FOR PRESIDENT 
WHO ATTACKS THE CONSTITUTION IN 

04:55:31.386 --> 04:55:35.482
WORD AND DEED WHILE REJECTING 
THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. IF 

04:55:35.690 --> 04:55:41.402
ANYTHING, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
CONDUCT WAS AN ASSAULT ON THE 

04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:43.692
FIRST AMENDMENT THAT MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS EXERCISE WHEN THEY 

04:55:43.693 --> 04:55:48.206
VOTED LAST YEAR.  OFTEN UNDER 
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT AND 

04:55:48.422 --> 04:55:53.706
ARDUOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. REMEMBER.
IT RESPECTS THE RIGHT OF THE 

04:55:53.912 --> 04:55:56.338
PEOPLE TO SPEAK ABOUT ISSUES OF 
OUR DAY. TO DEBATE

04:56:00.291 --> 04:56:02.291
AND THEN TO PARTICIPATE IN 
POLITICS BY SELECTING THE PEOPLE

04:56:02.357 --> 04:56:04.426
WHO WILL BE OUR LEADERS. 
REMEMBER, THOSE OF US WHO ASPIRE

04:56:04.618 --> 04:56:07.643
AND ATTAIN PUBLIC OFFICE ARE 
NOTHING BUT THE SERVANTS OF THE 

04:56:08.414 --> 04:56:12.927
PEOPLE. NOTHING. NOTHING NOT 
MASTERS. THERE ARE NO KINGS 

04:56:13.144 --> 04:56:15.736
HERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CZARS. 
THE PEOPLE.

04:56:20.469 --> 04:56:22.469
MOST IMPORTANT WORDS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE FIRST THREE.

04:56:22.518 --> 04:56:30.309
WE, THE PEOPLE. ALL THIS, ALL 
THIS MEANS LITTLE FOR PRESIDENT 

04:56:30.515 --> 04:56:32.515
WHO DISLIKES THE ELECTION 
RESULTS CAN INCITE VIOLENCE TO 

04:56:32.571 --> 04:56:34.571
TRY TO REPLACE

04:56:38.095 --> 04:56:40.339
AND USURP THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE. IS EXPRESSED IN THE 

04:56:40.549 --> 04:56:42.923
STATES. IGNORED THE JUDICIAL 
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND THEN 

04:56:43.175 --> 04:56:47.620
RUN OVER THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH 
OF GOVERNMENT WITH A MOB. 

04:56:47.833 --> 04:56:51.537
PRESIDENT TRUMPS CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS SOUGHT TO NULLIFY 

04:56:51.740 --> 04:56:55.797
THE POLITICAL RIGHTS AND 
SOVEREIGNTY OF THE AMERICAN 

04:56:56.021 --> 04:56:58.021
PEOPLE.

04:57:01.129 --> 04:57:02.950
OUR RIGHTIST PEOPLE TO 
DELIBERATE TO FORM OPINIONS TO 

04:57:02.951 --> 04:57:06.963
PERSUADE EACH OTHER TO BOTH AND 
DECIDE WHO OUR PRESIDENT WILL 

04:57:07.163 --> 04:57:12.547
BE. THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE 
PEOPLE THAT IS AN ATTACK ON THE 

04:57:12.745 --> 04:57:16.792
FIRST AMENDMENT I WOULD SAY. IN 
ADDITION, PRESIDENT TRUMPS 

04:57:17.005 --> 04:57:19.005
ACTIONS

04:57:22.011 --> 04:57:24.494
WERE A DIRECT ATTACK ON HER OWN 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH HERE IN THE 

04:57:24.695 --> 04:57:27.561
CAPITAL. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO 
SPEAK FOR CONSTITUENTS. THAT IS 

04:57:27.767 --> 04:57:30.622
WHY WE HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE MINI 
FREE-SPEECH CLAUSE SPEECH AND 

04:57:31.384 --> 04:57:36.494
DEBATE CLAUSE. THAT IS LITERALLY
OUR JOB. WE COME HERE

04:57:40.041 --> 04:57:42.099
AND REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF OUR 
PEOPLE. HE INCITED MEMBERS OF 

04:57:42.298 --> 04:57:45.742
CONGRESS TO STOP SPEAKING UNTIL 
WE TRULY BELIEVE OUR LIVES AND 

04:57:45.951 --> 04:57:50.234
THE LIVES OF OUR STAFF AND 
FAMILIES. THE STATEMENTS AND 

04:57:50.639 --> 04:57:52.639
ACTIONS TO SPEECH IN CONGRESS. 
SPEECH RELATED TO THE PEACEFUL 

04:57:52.681 --> 04:57:58.552
TRANSFER POWER HE HAS NO RIGHT. 
HE HAS NO RIGHT TO CLAIM 

04:57:58.751 --> 04:58:01.451
FREE-SPEECH PRINCIPLE TO PREVENT
THIS BODY FROM EXERCISING ITS 

04:58:02.218 --> 04:58:06.306
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS TO HOLD 
HIM ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS OFFENSE 

04:58:06.900 --> 04:58:16.768
AGAINST US. YOU KNOW, VOLTAIRE 
SAID FAMOUSLY, IN OUR FOUNDERS 

04:58:17.536 --> 04:58:19.536
KNEW IT.

04:58:23.328 --> 04:58:25.799
I MAY DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING YOU
STAY BUT I WILL DEFEND WITH MY 

04:58:26.017 --> 04:58:28.136
LIFE RIGHT TO SAY IT. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAY BECAUSE I DISAGREE 

04:58:28.336 --> 04:58:30.522
WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAY I WILL 
OVERTURN YOUR POPULAR ELECTION 

04:58:30.728 --> 04:58:35.411
AND DESPITE INSIGHT INSURRECTION
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. WE MIGHT

04:58:35.615 --> 04:58:38.580
TAKE A MOMENT TO CONSIDER 
ANOTHER VOLTAIRE INSIGHT, WITH A

04:58:38.779 --> 04:58:42.536
HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER MINE TOLD ME
WHEN THE STUDENT ASKED, ONE WAS 

04:58:42.751 --> 04:58:44.751
THE BEGINNING OF THE 
ENLIGHTENMENT? SHE SAID I THINK 

04:58:44.827 --> 04:58:50.348
IT WAS WHEN WILL PIERCE IT 
ANYBODY THAT CAN MAKE YOU 

04:58:50.547 --> 04:58:54.466
BELIEVE ABSURDITIES CAN MAKE YOU
COMMIT ATROCITIES. THERE IS NO 

04:58:55.199 --> 04:58:58.538
MERIT WHATSOEVER TO ANY OF THE 
FREE-SPEECH RHETORIC EMPTY THE 

04:58:59.307 --> 04:59:01.307
SPEECH CREDITED

04:59:03.655 --> 04:59:05.272
RHETORIC HE ATTACKED THE 
CONSTITUTION. HE BETRAYED HIS 

04:59:05.273 --> 04:59:09.085
OATH OF OFFICE. PRESIDENTS DO 
NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO DO THAT IS

04:59:09.285 --> 04:59:11.424
FORBIDDEN. THE PUBLIC MAY 
SURVIVE. PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE 

04:59:11.641 --> 04:59:15.534
IMPORTANT THAN THAT. THE 
PRESIDENT ACTING TO CREATE WERE 

04:59:15.733 --> 04:59:19.934
LEFT ANY FUTURE PRESIDENT TO DO 
WHAT HE DID HIS SELF EVIDENTLY 

04:59:20.233 --> 04:59:22.233
DANGEROUS.

04:59:28.177 --> 04:59:30.532
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT. NONE AT 
ALL. THE PRESIDENT LACKS ANY 

04:59:30.736 --> 04:59:32.568
FIRST AMENDMENT EXCUSE OR 
DEFENSE OR ANNUITY OR IMMUNITY. 

04:59:32.569 --> 04:59:38.132
HE INCITED AND HE INCITED A 
VIOLENT INSURRECTION YOU MUST BE

04:59:38.335 --> 04:59:40.335
CONVICTED.

04:59:43.022 --> 04:59:45.022
NOW

04:59:46.551 --> 04:59:48.602
I WILL CALL UP REPRESENTATIVE 
DEAN WHO WILL EXPLAIN WHY 

04:59:48.837 --> 04:59:54.141
CONTRARY TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
CLAIM THAT HE PROVIDED ALL THE 

04:59:54.338 --> 04:59:56.338
PROCESS DUE TO HIM. I'M SORRY 
MR. LOU.

05:00:00.398 --> 05:00:02.398
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:11.096
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR
ATTENTION WILL HURT TRUMP'S 

05:00:11.727 --> 05:00:13.727
ATTORNEYS BROUGHT

05:00:16.275 --> 05:00:18.400
PART OF TRUMPS EFFORTS TO AVOID 
TALKING ABOUT HIS OWN CONDUCT 

05:00:18.602 --> 05:00:23.235
TOWARD TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING 
RELATED TO HIS CRIME, WE EXPECT 

05:00:23.659 --> 05:00:27.339
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL RAISE 
PROCESS OBJECTION. DUE PROCESS 

05:00:27.667 --> 05:00:32.982
CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT. UNDER 
THE CONSTITUTION THE HOUSE HAS 

05:00:33.184 --> 05:00:37.510
QUOTE THE SOLE POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THAT PROVISION 

05:00:38.271 --> 05:00:40.271
CONFIRMS THAT

05:00:45.065 --> 05:00:47.149
HAS FUNCTIONS AS A GRAND JURY OR
PROSECUTOR. THE HOUSE DECIDES 

05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:49.350
WHETHER TO BRING CHARGES. NOW 
ANOTHER

05:00:53.252 --> 05:00:55.252
IMPEACHMENT CASE AT THE HOUSE TO
SAY TO CERTAIN PROCEDURAL 

05:00:55.289 --> 05:00:59.727
PRIVILEGES TO THE PERSON BEING 
IMPEACHED. THOSE ARE THAT. 

05:00:59.944 --> 05:01:03.892
PRIVILEGES. THEY ARE 
DISCRETIONARY. THE HOUSE HAS 

05:01:04.095 --> 05:01:09.187
POWER TO DECIDE ITS OWN RULES. 
HOW WANTS TO PAST ARTICLE

05:01:12.596 --> 05:01:14.666
OF IMPEACHMENT. IN THIS CASE THE
HOUSE DEBATED THE ARTICLE OF 

05:01:14.862 --> 05:01:20.347
IMPEACHMENT AND PASSED IT ON A 
BIPARTISAN VOTE. I AM A FORMER 

05:01:20.767 --> 05:01:28.670
PERSECUTOR I WANT TO ADD, I 
DECIDED WE SHOULD

05:01:34.407 --> 05:01:36.088
BRING CHARGES PROSECUTORS DON'T 
HAVE TO SPEND MONTHS 

05:01:36.089 --> 05:01:41.396
INVESTIGATING BEFORE THEY BRING 
CHARGES. I KNOW IN THIS CASE WE 

05:01:41.603 --> 05:01:43.662
HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED 

05:01:44.411 --> 05:01:49.625
BY PROSECUTORS FOR THE VIOLENCE 
ON JANUARY 6th. THERE WAS NO 

05:01:49.831 --> 05:01:53.226
REASON FOR THE HOUSE TO WAIT TO 
IMPEACH THE MAN AT THE VERY TOP 

05:01:53.475 --> 05:02:00.288
THAT INCITED THE VIOLENCE. I 
WOULD LIKE EMPHASIZE THE HOUSE 

05:02:00.520 --> 05:02:03.059
AND DID REASON TO MOVE QUICKLY. 
THIS WAS BECAUSE OF EXIGENT

05:02:12.805 --> 05:02:14.805
CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NOT A CASE 
WHERE THERE WAS HIDDEN CONDUCT 

05:02:14.873 --> 05:02:16.725
OR SOME CONSPIRACY THAT REQUIRES
MONTHS OR YEARS OF 

05:02:16.726 --> 05:02:18.397
INVESTIGATION. THIS CASE DOES 
NOT RAISE COMPLICATED LEGAL 

05:02:18.398 --> 05:02:20.765
ISSUES. THE GRAVITY OF THE 
RESIDENTS CONDUCT

05:02:25.942 --> 05:02:27.604
PROVIDED CLEARS RESPONSE FROM 
LEGISLATURE. GIVEN THAT THE 

05:02:27.605 --> 05:02:33.337
PRESIDENT WAS STILL IN OFFICE AT
THE TIME THE HOUSE APPROVED THIS

05:02:33.534 --> 05:02:35.149
ARTICLE. RUMORS OF FURTHER 
VIOLENCE ECHOED AROUND THE 

05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:39.907
COUNTRY. THEY STILL DO. THERE 
MUST BE NO DOUBT CONGRESS WILL 

05:02:40.181 --> 05:02:42.521
ACT DECISIVELY AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT THAT

05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:50.328
INCITES VIOLENCE AGAINST US. 
THAT IS WHY THE HOUSE MOVED 

05:02:50.786 --> 05:02:52.786
QUICKLY. PRESIDENT

05:02:54.760 --> 05:02:56.811
TRUMP WHO CREATED AN EMERGENCY 
CANNOT BE HEARD TO COMPLAIN THAT

05:02:57.572 --> 05:03:02.725
THE HOUSE IMPEACHED HIM TOO 
QUICKLY. ANOTHER POINT ON THE 

05:03:03.133 --> 05:03:08.021
DUE PROCESS QUESTION. EARLIER IN
THIS TRIAL, RESIDENT TRUMP'S 

05:03:08.221 --> 05:03:10.894
ATTORNEY SUGGESTED THE HOUSE 
SOMEHOW DELIBERATELY DELAYED THE

05:03:11.108 --> 05:03:15.348
TRANSMISSION OF THIS ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THAT IS NOT 

05:03:15.556 --> 05:03:22.794
ACCURATE. WHEN THE HOUSE ADOPTED
THIS ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT WE 

05:03:23.032 --> 05:03:27.086
WERE READY TO BEGIN TRIAL. BUT 
THE SENATE IS NOT CONSENTED AT 

05:03:27.854 --> 05:03:33.974
THE TIME. WHEN WE INQUIRED AS TO
OUR OPTIONS, OFFICIALS TOLD US, 

05:03:34.174 --> 05:03:36.637
CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS, 
THAT

05:03:45.864 --> 05:03:47.909
AS A CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
ATTEMPTED TO DELIVER THE ARTICLE

05:03:48.117 --> 05:03:50.172
OF IMPEACHMENT TO THE SECRETARY 
OF THE SENATE BEFORE THE SENATE 

05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:52.652
RECONVENED THAT THE CLERK OF THE
HOUSE  WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED 

05:03:52.851 --> 05:03:55.519
BACK AT THE DOOR. THAT'S WHY THE
CHILD DID NOT BEGIN THEN. THAT'S

05:03:55.720 --> 05:03:59.807
ANOTHER REASON WHY THE 
OBJECTIONS OF DUE PROCESS ARE 

05:04:00.032 --> 05:04:02.032
MERITLESS. FINALLY, LET ME 
CONCLUDE, THAT

05:04:09.630 --> 05:04:12.146
WE WILL SEE AND HAVE SEEN A FULL
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE BY THE 

05:04:12.341 --> 05:04:14.148
HOUSE, AND YOU'LL HEAR A FULL 
PRESENTATION BY PRESIDENT'S 

05:04:14.149 --> 05:04:18.585
ATTORNEYS WILL ASK QUESTIONS. 
THE SENATE HAS THE SOLE POWER TO

05:04:18.781 --> 05:04:26.203
TRY ALL IMPEACHMENTS. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS RECEIVING ANY AND ALL 

05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:28.809
PROCESS HE IS DUE RIGHT HERE IN 
THIS CHAMBER.

05:04:39.966 --> 05:04:41.966
THE 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN JUST A MOMENT  MARK HOLLEY

05:04:46.053 --> 05:04:48.256
MR. NEGUSE. IS THAT HE  ENGAGED 
IN

05:04:55.885 --> 05:04:57.932
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS AND
BEFORE MR. NEGUSE COMES UP I 

05:04:58.148 --> 05:04:59.981
WILL EMPHASIZE WHICH SHOULD BE 
AN NONCONTROVERSIAL POINT BUT 

05:04:59.982 --> 05:05:02.241
IS? UNDERSTAND.  IF WE HAVE 
PROVEN TO THE CONDUCT WE HAVE 

05:05:02.445 --> 05:05:04.445
ALLEGED IN THIS ARTICLE, THEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INDEED 

05:05:04.845 --> 05:05:08.313
COMMITTED A HIGH CRIME AND 
MISDEMEANOR UNDER THE 

05:05:08.515 --> 05:05:12.275
CONSTITUTION. UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S UNDOUBTEDLY 

05:05:12.484 --> 05:05:14.357
IN THE WORDS OF GEORGE MASON 
FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

05:05:14.358 --> 05:05:20.419
CONVENTION, A GREAT AND 
DANGEROUS OFFENSE AGAINST THE 

05:05:20.631 --> 05:05:23.640
REPUBLIC. INDEED IT IS HARD TO 
THINK OF A GREATER OR MORE 

05:05:24.282 --> 05:05:30.444
DANGEROUS OFFENSE AGAINST THE 
REPUBLIC THAN THIS ONE. SO, TO 

05:05:30.676 --> 05:05:34.092
BE VERY PRECISE ABOUT THIS I 
HOPE WE ALL CAN AGREE TODAY, 

05:05:34.286 --> 05:05:39.015
THAT IF A PRESIDENT DOES NOT 
DOES INCITED VIOLENT

05:05:43.544 --> 05:05:45.181
INSURRECTION AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT, HE CAN BE IMPEACHED 

05:05:45.182 --> 05:05:50.092
FOR IT. I HOPE WE ALL CAN AGREE 
THAT IS A CRIME. ANOTHER KEY 

05:05:50.857 --> 05:05:55.613
POINT, WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
LETTERS MIGHT BE DOING 

05:05:55.816 --> 05:05:59.250
OTHERWISE, THE QUESTION IS NOT 
WHETHER TRUMP COMMITTED A CRIME 

05:05:59.451 --> 05:06:01.451
UNDER

05:06:08.141 --> 05:06:10.704
FEDERAL CODE OR DC LAW OR LAW OF
ANY STATE, IMPEACHMENT DOES NOT 

05:06:10.909 --> 05:06:14.885
RESULT IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES. AS
WE KEEP EMPHASIZING. NO ONE 

05:06:15.087 --> 05:06:17.891
SPENT A DAY IN JAIL. THERE ARE 
NOT EVEN CRIMINAL OR CIVIL 

05:06:18.095 --> 05:06:23.275
FINES. CENTURIES OF HISTORY NOT 
TO MENTION THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

05:06:24.049 --> 05:06:27.741
TEXT, STRUCTURE ORIGINAL INTENT 
AND UNDERSTANDING ALL CONFIRMED,

05:06:27.985 --> 05:06:29.985
TEACHING OF JAMES

05:06:32.483 --> 05:06:34.660
WILSON ANOTHER FRAMER THAT WROTE
IMPEACHMENTS AND OFFENSES COME 

05:06:34.861 --> 05:06:36.861
NOT

05:06:44.963 --> 05:06:46.664
WITHIN THE SPHERE OF ORDINARY 
JURISPRUDENCE. SIMPLY PUT 

05:06:46.665 --> 05:06:48.665
IMPEACHMENT IS CREATED FOR A 
PURPOSE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT 

05:06:48.853 --> 05:06:50.877
FROM CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT. IT WAS
CREATED TO PREVENT AND DETER 

05:06:51.099 --> 05:06:54.053
ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO REPRESENT 
AMERICA AND SWORE AN OATH BUT 

05:06:54.280 --> 05:06:56.280
COMMIT DANGEROUS OFFENSES 
AGAINST

05:07:00.546 --> 05:07:04.848
OUR REPUBLIC THAT'S A 
CONSTITUTIONAL CRIME. SENATORS 

05:07:05.257 --> 05:07:07.867
WITH GREATER OFFENSE COULD ONE 
COMMIT THAN TO INCITE A VIOLENT 

05:07:08.074 --> 05:07:11.838
INSURRECTION AT OUR SEAT OF 
GOVERNMENT DURING THE USEFUL 

05:07:12.039 --> 05:07:14.437
TRANSFER OF POWER? CIRCUMSTANCES

05:07:25.126 --> 05:07:27.126
WHERE VIOLENCE IS FORESEEABLE 
AND THE CROWD IS POISED FOR 

05:07:27.184 --> 05:07:29.227
VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE A MOB OF 
THOUSAND TO ATTACK US, WITH 

05:07:29.427 --> 05:07:31.696
WEAPONS AND OF STICKS AND POLLS,
TO BLUDGEON, AND BE  LAW 

05:07:31.898 --> 05:07:33.749
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND DEFACE 
SACRED WALLS AND TRASHED THE 

05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:36.760
PLACE, AND TO DO SO WHILE 
SEEKING TO STOP US FROM

05:07:40.305 --> 05:07:42.305
REVEALING OUR OWN DUTIES AND 
OATH TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION 

05:07:42.406 --> 05:07:47.856
BY COUNTING VOTES OUR ELECTIONS?
THEN TO SIT BACK AND WATCH IN 

05:07:48.602 --> 05:07:53.151
DELIGHT AS INSURRECTIONIST 
ATTACK US? VIOLATING THESE 

05:07:53.556 --> 05:08:00.559
SACRED OATH AND DERELICTION AND 
DESERTION OF DUTY? HOW CAN 

05:08:01.532 --> 05:08:03.532
ASSURE

05:08:05.268 --> 05:08:07.306
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WILL 
DEFEND US IN THE CONSTITUTION IF

05:08:07.511 --> 05:08:09.742
WE DO NOT HOLD THE PRESIDENT 
ACCOUNTABLE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE 

05:08:10.509 --> 05:08:17.728
LIKE THIS? WHAT IS IMPEACHABLE 
CONDUCT IF NOT THIS? I CHALLENGE

05:08:18.037 --> 05:08:20.286
YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IF YOU 
THINK THIS IS IMPEACHABLE, WHAT 

05:08:20.489 --> 05:08:26.934
IS? WHAT WOULD BE? TRUMP LAWYERS
ENFORCE BREATHTAKING ASSERTION 

05:08:27.135 --> 05:08:29.135
THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS TOTALLY 
APPROPRIATE

05:08:32.454 --> 05:08:34.454
AND THE SENATE ACQUITS DONALD 
TRUMP THAN ANY PRESIDENT COULD 

05:08:34.549 --> 05:08:38.906
INCITE AND PROVOKE INSURRECTION 
OR VIOLENCE AGAINST US AGAIN. IF

05:08:39.124 --> 05:08:44.527
YOU DO NOT FIND THIS A HIGH 
CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR TODAY, YOU

05:08:44.728 --> 05:08:46.916
HAVE SET A NEW TERRIBLE STANDARD
FOR PRESIDENTIAL

05:08:53.286 --> 05:08:55.286
MISCONDUCT IN THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA. THE ONLY QUESTION 

05:08:55.375 --> 05:08:58.221
HERE IS FACTUAL. THE WEEPER OF 
DONALD TRUMP WHILE PRESIDENT 

05:08:58.655 --> 05:09:00.655
INCITED A VIOLENT RESURRECTION 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT? 

05:09:00.668 --> 05:09:04.323
INCITEMENT IS IN FACT BASED AND 
FACT INTENSIVE

05:09:13.242 --> 05:09:15.242
DIRECTIVE. WE COMMEND YOU FOR 
YOUR SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION TO 

05:09:15.537 --> 05:09:17.537
EVERYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE. WE 
BELIEVE WE HAVE SHOWN YOU 

05:09:17.605 --> 05:09:19.349
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT WOULD
CONVINCE ANYONE USING COMMON 

05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:21.350
SENSE

05:09:23.902 --> 05:09:25.902
THAT THIS WAS INDEED INCITEMENT.
MEANING, DONALD TRUMP'S CONDUCT 

05:09:26.315 --> 05:09:31.094
ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE. VIOLENCE 
WAS STABLE AND HE ACTED 

05:09:31.300 --> 05:09:34.281
WILLFULLY IN THE ACTIONS THAT 
ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE.

05:09:42.324 --> 05:09:44.896
MR. NEGUSE WILL TAKE YOU TO THAT
AGAIN. NOT THE WHOLE THING WHERE

05:09:45.108 --> 05:09:47.837
ALMOST DONE. WHERE ALMOST DONE 
BUT  WE DO NOT WANT TO BE SAID 

05:09:48.049 --> 05:09:50.049
THEY NEVER APPROVED THIS OR 
THAT. BECAUSE, MY

05:09:55.424 --> 05:09:57.424
MAGNIFICENT TEAM OF MANAGERS 
HAVE STAYED AT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

05:09:57.500 --> 05:09:59.785
AFTER NIGHT FOR WEEKS TO COMPILE
ALL OF THE FACTUAL EVIDENCE. WE 

05:10:00.542 --> 05:10:06.286
PUT IT BEFORE YOU. WE HAVE PUT 
IT BEFORE ALL OF YOU IN THIS 

05:10:06.501 --> 05:10:12.517
PUBLIC TRIAL. BECAUSE WE LOVE 
OUR COUNTRY. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY

05:10:13.256 --> 05:10:15.256
THAT MUCH.

05:10:18.432 --> 05:10:20.901
MR. NEGUSE WILL SHOW YOU WE HAVE
PROVEN OUR CASE. PRESIDENT TRUMP

05:10:21.311 --> 05:10:25.255
COMMITTED THIS IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSE THAT WE IMPEACH HIM FOR 

05:10:25.953 --> 05:10:32.165
JANUARY 13th. YOU SHOULD CONVICT
HIM. WHEN HE IS FINISHED I WILL 

05:10:32.366 --> 05:10:37.870
RETURN AND EXPLAIN WHY IT IS 
DANGEROUS FOR US TO IGNORE THIS.

05:10:38.076 --> 05:10:42.935
WHY YOU MUST CONVICT AND THEN WE
WILL REST. 

05:10:42.936 --> 05:10:44.936
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:11:02.144 --> 05:11:05.618
MR. PRESIDENT AND DISTINGUISH 
SENATORS GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN. I

05:11:05.834 --> 05:11:11.367
KNOW IT HAS BEEN A LONG FEW 
DAYS. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU WE

05:11:11.566 --> 05:11:15.857
ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR 
PATIENCE AND YOUR ATTENTION AND 

05:11:16.259 --> 05:11:19.329
THE ATTENTION YOU PAID YOU EVERY
ONE OF OUR MANAGERS THAT HAVE 

05:11:19.530 --> 05:11:23.975
PRESENTED OUR CASE. AS LEAD 
MANAGER RASKIN MENTIONED, I HOPE

05:11:25.444 --> 05:11:30.932
AND TRUST WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT 
THE PRESIDENT THAT INCITED 

05:11:31.153 --> 05:11:35.084
VIOLENT INSURRECTION AGAINST OUR
GOVERNMENT THAT THAT IS 

05:11:35.303 --> 05:11:40.697
IMPEACHABLE. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO
DO IS AS WE CLOSE OUR CASE, IS 

05:11:40.928 --> 05:11:47.521
WALK YOU THROUGH WIRE EVIDENT 
OVERWHELMINGLY ESTABLISHES THAT 

05:11:47.746 --> 05:11:51.558
PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMITTED THAT 
OFFENSE. AS YOU CONSIDER THAT 

05:11:51.755 --> 05:11:57.357
QUESTION, THAT QUESTION OF 
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT INCITED AN

05:11:57.566 --> 05:11:59.566
INSTRUCTION THERE ARE THREE 
QUESTIONS THAT REASONABLY COME 

05:11:59.755 --> 05:12:05.885
TO MIND. WAS VIOLENCE 
PERCEIVABLE? DID HE ENCOURAGE 

05:12:06.101 --> 05:12:13.111
VIOLENCE? DID HE ACT WILLFULLY? 
I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU WHY THE 

05:12:13.319 --> 05:12:19.464
ANSWER TO EVERY ONE OF THOSE 
QUESTION HAS TO BE, YES. FIRST, 

05:12:19.869 --> 05:12:21.869
LET'S START WITH FORESEEABILITY.

05:12:25.421 --> 05:12:27.421
WAS IT FORESEEABLE THAT THE 
VIOLENCE WOULD ARRIVE ON JANUARY

05:12:27.581 --> 05:12:32.415
6th IF PRESIDENT TRUMP LIT A 
SPARK? WAS IT PREDICTABLE THAT 

05:12:33.176 --> 05:12:37.900
THE CROWD AT THE SAME AMERICA 
RALLY WAS POISED ON A 

05:12:38.125 --> 05:12:43.402
HAIRTRIGGER FOR VIOLENCE, THAT 
THEY WOULD FIGHT, LITERALLY IF 

05:12:43.671 --> 05:12:49.797
PROVOKED TO DO SO? OF COURSE IT 
WAS. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP STOOD 

05:12:50.013 --> 05:12:55.342
UP TO THAT PODIUM ON JANUARY 6, 
HE KNEW THAT MANY IN THE CROWD 

05:12:56.085 --> 05:13:01.177
WERE INFLAMED AND WERE ARMED AND
WERE READY FOR VIOLENCE.

05:13:04.911 --> 05:13:09.796
IT WAS AN EXPLOSIVE SITUATION. 
HE KNEW IT. WE HAVE SHOWN YOU 

05:13:10.206 --> 05:13:14.121
THE EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT. YOU 
HAVE SEEN IT. THE IMAGES, THEY 

05:13:14.328 --> 05:13:18.599
HAVE VIDEOED THE ARTICLES AND 
PATTERN THAT SHOW THE VIOLENCE 

05:13:18.816 --> 05:13:23.146
ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY WAS 
ENTIRELY PERCEIVABLE. WE HAVE 

05:13:23.347 --> 05:13:27.775
SHOWED YOU HOW THIS ALL BEGAN 
WITH THE BIG LIE, THE CLAIMED 

05:13:28.003 --> 05:13:31.709
ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 

05:13:31.915 --> 05:13:35.945
SUPPORTERS WERE THE VICTIMS OF 
THE MASSIVE FRAUD. MASSIVE 

05:13:36.157 --> 05:13:40.699
CONSPIRACY TO RIP AWAY THEIR 
VOTES. WE HAVE SHOWED YOU HOW 

05:13:41.453 --> 05:13:46.013
RESIDENT TRUMP SPREAD THAT LIE. 
AND OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS 

05:13:46.214 --> 05:13:53.804
WITH HIS SUPPORT AND 
ENCOURAGEMENT, IT INFLAMED HIS 

05:13:54.769 --> 05:13:59.757
MOP RESULTING IN REAL-WORLD 
VIOLENCE, DEATH THREATS AND 

05:13:59.955 --> 05:14:05.817
INCREASINGLY EXTREME CALLS TO 
STOP THE STEEL. WE ESTABLISHED

05:14:06.689 --> 05:14:11.795
AFTER HE LOST THE ELECTION, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS WILLING TO DO JUST

05:14:12.398 --> 05:14:18.459
ABOUT ANYTHING TO PREVENT THE 
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. HE 

05:14:18.667 --> 05:14:23.627
TRIED EVERYTHING HE COULD DO TO 
STOP IT. YOU'LL RECALL THE 

05:14:23.844 --> 05:14:30.047
EVIDENCE ON THE SCREEN. HIM 
PRESSURING AND CREDITING STATE 

05:14:30.791 --> 05:14:38.204
ELECTION OFFICIALS. ATTACKING 
THEM, TO THE POINT OF CALLING 

05:14:38.611 --> 05:14:41.223
THEM ENEMIES OF THE STATE 
THREATENING AT LEAST ONE OF THEM

05:14:41.428 --> 05:14:45.714
WITH CRIMINAL PENALTIES. THEN, 
ATTACKING SENATORS, MEMBERS OF 

05:14:46.328 --> 05:14:54.534
CONGRESS. PRESSURING THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT PROMPTING OUTCRIES 

05:14:54.941 --> 05:14:56.966
FROM ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS, 
NOT TO MENTION HIS OWN ATTORNEY 

05:14:57.171 --> 05:15:00.331
GENERAL. REPORTEDLY TELLING HIM 
THE STONE ELECTION CLAIMS WERE 

05:15:01.204 --> 05:15:03.204
BS.

05:15:08.238 --> 05:15:10.636
NOT MY PHRASE, HIS. AND THEN, AS
JANUARY 6th APPROACHED, HE MOVED

05:15:10.850 --> 05:15:17.219
ON TO ATTACKING ZONE VICE 
PRESIDENT AND OPENLY AND 

05:15:17.418 --> 05:15:23.615
SAVAGELY. WE WERE COUNTED 
THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE PERIOD, 

05:15:24.023 --> 05:15:26.023
ALL THE WAY THROUGH WHICH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP INFLAMED HIS 

05:15:26.073 --> 05:15:30.145
SUPPORTERS WITH LIES THAT THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN. AS EVERY 

05:15:30.349 --> 05:15:34.087
SINGLE ONE OF US KNOWS, NOTHING 
IN THIS COUNTRY IS MORE SACRED 

05:15:35.059 --> 05:15:44.721
NOTHING, THEN OUR RIGHT TO VOTE.
OUR VOICE AND HERE YOU HAVE 

05:15:45.135 --> 05:15:48.818
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS 

05:15:49.220 --> 05:15:52.180
THAT THEIR VOICE, THEIR RIGHTS 
AS AMERICANS WERE BEING STOLEN 

05:15:52.840 --> 05:16:00.982
FROM THEM. WHIPPED AWAY. THAT 
MADE THEM ANGRY. ANGRY AND A TO 

05:16:01.186 --> 05:16:03.862
STOP THE STEAL . TO FIGHT LIKE

05:16:22.119 --> 05:16:27.984
HELL TO STOP THE STEAL.  YOU SAW
THIS. SO HE DO THIS OVER AND 

05:16:28.189 --> 05:16:32.414
OVER AGAIN WITH THE SAME MESSAGE
EACH TIME. YOU MUST FIGHT TO WIN

05:16:33.075 --> 05:16:38.059
IT BACK. YOU MUST NEVER 
SURRENDER. NO MATTER WHAT. 

05:16:39.028 --> 05:16:45.581
REMEMBER, EACH TIME HIS 
SUPPORTERS ALONG THE WAY SHOWED 

05:16:45.784 --> 05:16:54.963
VIOLENCE, HE ENDORSED IT. HE 
ENCOURAGED IT. HE PRAISED IT.

05:16:57.945 --> 05:17:02.233
ALL PART OF THAT SAME DEMAND TO 
STOP THE STEAL AND FIGHT LIKE 

05:17:02.461 --> 05:17:06.961
HELL. REMEMBER?  YOU REMEMBER 
THE VIDEO THAT WE SHOWED YOU 

05:17:07.166 --> 05:17:12.292
FROM TEXAS? SOME OF THE 
SUPPORTERS SUPPORTING A BUS OF 

05:17:12.499 --> 05:17:16.340
CAMPAIGN WORKERS ON HIGHWAY? 
PEOPLE EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN 

05:17:16.939 --> 05:17:18.975
KILLED. EASILY. WHAT DID HE DO?

05:17:22.887 --> 05:17:26.108
HE TWEETED IT AND MADE A JOKE 
ABOUT IT AT A RALLY. HE CALLED 

05:17:26.729 --> 05:17:30.624
THEM PATRIOTS. HE HELD THEM OUT 
AS AN EXAMPLE.

05:17:34.347 --> 05:17:37.153
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO STOP 
THE STEAL. WHEN HE TOLD  THE 

05:17:37.359 --> 05:17:41.104
SUPPORTERS TO STOP THE STEAL 
THEY TOOK UP ARMS  TO LITERALLY 

05:17:41.532 --> 05:17:45.565
INTIMIDATE OFFICIALS TO OVERTURN
ELECTION RESULTS YOU SAW THE 

05:17:45.772 --> 05:17:52.501
EVIDENCE. SO DID HE. HE WELCOMED
IT. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

05:17:52.704 --> 05:17:57.150
ATTACKED GEORGIA SECRETARY OF 
STATE FOR CERTIFYING THE 

05:17:57.354 --> 05:18:04.794
RESULTS, HIS SUPPORTERS SENT 
DEATH THREATS. YOU SAW THOSE IN 

05:18:05.006 --> 05:18:11.920
GREAT DETAIL FROM MANAGER DEAN. 
WHAT DID HE DO? HE ATTACKED THE 

05:18:12.136 --> 05:18:17.378
ELECTION OFFICIALS FURTHER. WHEN
HIS SUPPORTERS GATHERED TOGETHER

05:18:18.051 --> 05:18:21.056
TO HAVE A SECOND MILLION

05:18:25.201 --> 05:18:30.074
MEGA RALLY THAT'S THE RALLY 
ABOUT THE STOLEN ELECTION HE 

05:18:30.298 --> 05:18:38.745
TWEETED THE FIGHT HAD JUST 
BEGUN. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? IT 

05:18:38.957 --> 05:18:43.573
ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE. FIGHTS 
BROKE OUT. STABBINGS AND SERIES 

05:18:43.777 --> 05:18:45.777
VIOLENCE.

05:18:48.907 --> 05:18:54.852
NOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKE ALL OF
US, HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT

05:18:55.059 --> 05:18:57.611
RALLY. HE SAW ALL OF THE 
VIOLENCE AND THE BURNINGS AND 

05:18:57.809 --> 05:19:00.267
CHAOS. HOW DID HE RESPOND? HE 
TREATED

05:19:05.653 --> 05:19:08.127
PRAISE OF THE EVENTS AND THEN 
YOU SEE IT ON THE SCREEN HE 

05:19:08.341 --> 05:19:13.225
BOUGHT $50 MILLION. $50 MILLION 
WORTH OF ADS TO FURTHER PROMOTE 

05:19:13.991 --> 05:19:20.633
HIS MESSAGE TO THOSE EXACT SAME 
THINGS. HE IMMEDIATELY 

05:19:21.918 --> 05:19:24.653
FORCES WITH THE VERY SAME GROUP

05:19:28.196 --> 05:19:30.492
. HE JOINED FORCES WITH THE SAME
PEOPLE THAT HAD JUST ERUPTED 

05:19:31.219 --> 05:19:33.219
INTO VIOLENCE.

05:19:40.088 --> 05:19:42.923
WAS VIOLENCE PERCEIVABLE AND 
PREDICTABLE?

05:19:47.006 --> 05:19:53.433
ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS NOT JUST 
CLEAR LOOKING BACK IN TIME IT 

05:19:53.638 --> 05:20:00.162
WAS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AT THE 
TIME. IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO 

05:20:00.360 --> 05:20:04.407
JANUARY 6th, THERE WERE DOZENS, 
HUNDREDS OF WARNINGS. HE KNEW 

05:20:04.613 --> 05:20:08.141
IT. HE KNEW THE RALLY WOULD 
EXPLODE.

05:20:12.068 --> 05:20:16.750
PROVOKED. HE KNEW ALL IT WOULD 
TAKE IS A SLIGHT PUSH. REMEMBER,

05:20:16.972 --> 05:20:21.250
YOU HEARD FROM MANAGER PLASKETT,
THE CHATTER ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:23.670
WEBSITES, THE TRUMP CONNORS

05:20:29.222 --> 05:20:31.222
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IT 
SHOWED THE PEOPLE HE INVITED TO 

05:20:31.314 --> 05:20:34.312
THE GENERAL SIX I TOOK THIS AS A
SERIOUS CALL TO ARMS

05:20:38.437 --> 05:20:40.903
. THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST ANY 
ATTACK. IT WAS TO STORM THE 

05:20:41.105 --> 05:20:43.105
CAPITAL IF NECESSARY. STOP THE

05:20:51.987 --> 05:20:53.939
STEAL WAS NOT JUST CLEAR THE 
WEBSITES. THE TRUMP 

05:20:53.940 --> 05:20:55.569
ADMINISTRATION WAS MONITORING 
THE FBI ISSUED REPORTS ABOUT 

05:20:55.570 --> 05:20:58.051
THIS IS A CREDIBLE THREAT. A 
THREAT TO TARGET US.  LAW 

05:20:58.258 --> 05:21:00.978
ENFORCEMENT MADE SIX ARRESTS 
THAT NIGHT. SIX ARRESTS. 

05:21:01.382 --> 05:21:06.278
NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE CITY 
WARNED OF THE RISK OF VIOLENCE. 

05:21:06.686 --> 05:21:13.165
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE 
RISK OF VIOLENCE WAS 

05:21:13.371 --> 05:21:21.204
FORESEEABLE. WHAT DID HE DO IN 
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO 

05:21:22.171 --> 05:21:25.716
RALLY? DID HE CALL ME SITUATION?
ASK YOURSELF. DID HE CALL FOR 

05:21:26.475 --> 05:21:28.475
PEACE? NO.

05:21:30.208 --> 05:21:34.246
HE DID NOT DO THAT. HE SPREAD 
HIS BIG LIE MORE. THE MOST 

05:21:34.862 --> 05:21:39.665
DANGEROUS LIE, AS I MENTIONED 
AMERICA'S VOTES WERE STOLEN IN 

05:21:39.873 --> 05:21:44.730
THE FINAL ACT OF THEFT WOULD 
OCCUR HERE IN THE CAPITAL. THEN 

05:21:45.485 --> 05:21:50.147
HE ASSEMBLED THOSE SUPPORTERS. 
HE INVITED THEM

05:21:54.718 --> 05:21:57.555
TO AN ORGANIZED EVENT ON A 
SPECIFIC DAY AT A SPECIFIC TIME 

05:21:57.758 --> 05:22:02.344
MATCHED PERFECTLY TO COINCIDE 
WITH THE JOINT SESSION OF 

05:22:02.558 --> 05:22:07.009
CONGRESS TO COINCIDE WITH THE 
STEAL THAT HE HAD TOLD THEM TO 

05:22:07.717 --> 05:22:16.506
STOP.  AGAIN, HE WAS TOLD BY LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND ALL OVER THE 

05:22:16.710 --> 05:22:23.530
NEWS THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE 
ARMED AND READY FOR REAL 

05:22:23.735 --> 05:22:27.909
VIOLENCE. HE KNEW IT. HE KNEW IT
PERFECTLY WELL. HE HAD CREATED 

05:22:28.161 --> 05:22:35.197
THIS POWDER CAKE AT HIS RALLY. 
HE KNEW HOW COMBUSTIBLE THAT 

05:22:35.402 --> 05:22:38.594
SITUATION WAS. HE KNEW THERE 
WERE PEOPLE BEFORE HIM WHO HAD 

05:22:38.794 --> 05:22:43.837
PREPARED OR ARMED AND ARMORED. 
SHE KNEW THEY WOULD JUMP TO 

05:22:44.040 --> 05:22:50.087
VIOLENCE AT ANY SIGNAL, AT ANY 
SIGN FROM HIM THAT HE NEEDED 

05:22:50.361 --> 05:22:57.035
THEM TO FIGHT. HE NEEDED THEM TO
STOP THE STEAL. WE ALL KNOW WHAT

05:22:57.254 --> 05:23:01.099
HAPPENED THEN.  SECOND QUESTION.

05:23:05.856 --> 05:23:10.798
DID HE ENCOURAGED TO VIOLENCE? 
STANDING IN THAT POWDER CANE, 

05:23:11.539 --> 05:23:18.078
DID HE LIGHT A MATCH? EVERYONE 
KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THAT 

05:23:18.291 --> 05:23:24.617
QUESTION. THE HOURS OF VIDEO YOU
HAVE WATCHED LEAVE NO DOUBT. 

05:23:24.817 --> 05:23:29.543
REMEMBER, WHAT HE SAID ON 
JANUARY 6th.

05:23:38.189 --> 05:23:41.217
PAYMENT ALL OF US HERE TODAY DO 
NOT WANT TO SEE THE ELECTION 

05:23:41.434 --> 05:23:43.434
VICTORY

05:23:47.641 --> 05:23:49.641
DALEN. IT IS PURE THEFT IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY. EVERYBODY 

05:23:49.772 --> 05:23:51.855
KNOWS IT. MAKE NO MISTAKE THE 
SELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM YOU, 

05:23:52.066 --> 05:23:54.147
FROM ME FROM THE COUNTRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT THE OPENING, 

05:23:54.148 --> 05:23:56.148
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:23:59.330 --> 05:24:01.593
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. WE WILL 
NEVER CONCEDE. YOU DO NOT 

05:24:01.796 --> 05:24:05.479
CONCEDE WHAT IS A THEFT. TO USE 
A FAVORITE TERM THAT ALL OF YOU 

05:24:05.685 --> 05:24:10.181
PEOPLE CAME UP WITH, WE WILL 
STOP THE STEAL  WE WILL STOP THE

05:24:10.935 --> 05:24:20.463
STEAL . WE WILL NOT LET THEM 
SILENCE YOUR VOICES WE WILL NOT 

05:24:20.665 --> 05:24:25.838
LET IT HAPPEN. NOT GOING TO LET 
IT HAPPEN.

05:24:35.399 --> 05:24:40.964
THANK YOU. YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR 
PEOPLE TO FIGHT. BECAUSE YOU 

05:24:41.729 --> 05:24:47.280
WILL NEVER TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY
WITH WEAKNESS. YOU HAVE TO SHOW 

05:24:47.498 --> 05:24:51.875
STRENGTH AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
STRONG. WE FIGHT WE FIGHT LIKE 

05:24:52.126 --> 05:24:54.819
HELL. IF YOU DO NOT FIGHT LIKE 
HELL, YOU WILL NOT HAVE A 

05:24:55.223 --> 05:24:57.223
COUNTRY ANYMORE.

05:24:58.970 --> 05:25:04.926
YOU MAY REMEMBER AT THE OUTSET 
OF THIS TRIAL. I TOLD YOU YOU 

05:25:05.656 --> 05:25:10.164
WOULD HEAR THREE PHRASES OVER 
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE BIG

05:25:10.362 --> 05:25:14.943
LIE, THAT THE ELECTION HAD BEEN 
STOLEN, AND STOP THE STEAL  AND 

05:25:15.706 --> 05:25:17.974
NEVER CONCEDE. FIGHT LIKE HELL.

05:25:22.329 --> 05:25:24.788
FIGHT LIKE HELL TO STOP THAT 
STEAL. YOU HEARD THOSE PHRASES  

05:25:25.002 --> 05:25:27.002
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE

05:25:30.302 --> 05:25:31.957
TRIAL AND STATEMENT AFTER 
STATEMENT TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS

05:25:31.958 --> 05:25:37.171
THEY SHOULD BE PATRIOTS. FIGHT 
HARD TO STOP THE STEAL . ON THAT

05:25:37.375 --> 05:25:44.823
DAY, THAT DAY, WHERE THE KEY 
DIRECT THE CROWDS IRE? HE 

05:25:45.026 --> 05:25:53.594
DIRECTED THEM HERE TO CONGRESS. 
HE QUITE LITERALLY AT ONE PART 

05:25:53.822 --> 05:25:59.472
OF THAT SPEECH POINTED AT US. HE
TOLD THEM TO

05:26:03.507 --> 05:26:06.195
AND IF YOU DO NOT FIGHT LIKE 
HELL YOU WILL NOT HAVE A COUNTRY

05:26:06.403 --> 05:26:13.487
ANYMORE. HERE'S THE THING, IT 
WAS NOT RHETORICAL. HE HAD 

05:26:13.906 --> 05:26:19.217
ALREADY MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR.
HE MEANT IT. THAT WHEN FOLLOWERS

05:26:19.435 --> 05:26:24.937
IN FACT THOUGHT, WHEN ENGAGED IN
VIOLENCE AND HE HONORED THEM, 

05:26:26.116 --> 05:26:32.729
PATRIOTS. HE IMPLIED, IT WAS 
OKAY TO BREAK THE LAW BECAUSE 

05:26:32.933 --> 05:26:39.428
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN. YOU 
HEARD IT. YOU REMEMBER THE CLIP 

05:26:40.236 --> 05:26:44.731
THAT DEAN SHOWED YOU EARLIER IN 
THE TRIAL. HE TOLD THEM, THE 

05:26:44.935 --> 05:26:49.899
QUOTE IS ON-SCREEN. WHEN YOU 
CATCH SOMEBODY IN A FRAUD, YOU 

05:26:50.100 --> 05:26:54.393
ARE ALLOWED TO GO BY VERY 
DIFFERENT RULES. REMEMBER HOW 

05:26:54.597 --> 05:26:58.061
ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS

05:27:02.618 --> 05:27:04.618
SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS ACROSS 
SOCIAL MEDIA WERE TWEETING THIS 

05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:06.948
AS A WAR TALK ABOUT  BRINGING IN
THE CALVARY? PRESIDENT TRUMP 

05:27:07.689 --> 05:27:12.440
MADE CLEAR, WHAT THOSE DIFFERENT
RULES WERE. HE HAD BEEN MAKING 

05:27:13.203 --> 05:27:21.606
IT CLEAR FOR MONTHS, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, LET'S HAVE TRIAL 

05:27:22.576 --> 05:27:24.576
COMBAT.

05:27:26.309 --> 05:27:30.540
RUDY, YOU DID A GREAT JOB HE HAS
GOT GOT

05:27:37.327 --> 05:27:40.129
. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE HAS GOT 
GUTS. LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 

05:27:40.335 --> 05:27:42.504
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HE HAS GOT 
GUTS. HE FIGHTS. 

05:27:42.505 --> 05:27:48.966
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS MESSAGE WAS CRYSTAL 
CLEAR. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD 

05:27:49.179 --> 05:27:56.431
IMMEDIATELY. INSTANTLY. BY HIS 
FOLLOWERS. 

05:27:58.426 --> 05:28:03.563
GUESS. WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS AS
TO HOW THEY REACTED. WE CAN LOOK

05:28:04.415 --> 05:28:10.890
AT HOW PEOPLE REACTED TO WHAT HE
SAID. YOU SAW. YOU SAW THE 

05:28:11.088 --> 05:28:20.973
VIOLENCE. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. HE
SAID IT AND THEY DID IT. 

05:28:21.392 --> 05:28:29.922
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE, HE TOLD 
US. THEY TOLD US IN REAL TIME

05:28:32.599 --> 05:28:34.599
DURING THE ATTACK. YOU SAW THE 
UPDATED

05:28:38.119 --> 05:28:40.289
, THE INTERVIEWS ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA, LIVE TV. THEY WERE DOING 

05:28:40.490 --> 05:28:45.852
THIS FOR HIM. BECAUSE HE ASKED 
THEM. THE WAS NOT JUST 

05:28:46.053 --> 05:28:48.917
INSURRECTIONIST WHO CONFIRMED 
THIS. MANY, MANY PEOPLE 

05:28:49.218 --> 05:28:53.500
INCLUDING CURRENT AND FORMER 
OFFICIALS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED

05:28:55.347 --> 05:29:00.661
THE PRESIDENT HAD INCITED THE 
CROWD. HE ALONE WAS CAPABLE OF 

05:29:00.869 --> 05:29:04.723
STOPPING THE VIOLENCE. HE DID 
THIS AND HE HAD TO CALL IT OFF, 

05:29:04.941 --> 05:29:10.656
BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO 
COULD. LET'S SEE WHAT 

05:29:11.626 --> 05:29:14.884
REPRESENTATIVE McCARTHY, 
REPRESENTATIVE GALLAGHER, CHRIS 

05:29:15.092 --> 05:29:18.573
CRISTI, REPRESENTATIVE CAN 
FIGURE,

05:29:23.755 --> 05:29:25.755
HAD TO SAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:29:29.097 --> 05:29:32.525
PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT. ANYBODY
INVOLVED IN THIS

05:29:36.667 --> 05:29:40.759
HIM A LOT AND CLEAR. THIS IS NOT
THE AMERICAN WAY. MR. PRESIDENT 

05:29:41.025 --> 05:29:43.489
YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP THIS. 
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN 

05:29:43.715 --> 05:29:49.830
CALL THIS OFF. CALL IT OFF. IT'S
PRETTY SIMPLE. THE PRESIDENTTHE 

05:29:50.447 --> 05:29:54.192
PRESIDENT CAUSED THIS PROTEST TO
OCCUR.,  HE'S THE HE'S ONLY 

05:29:54.239 --> 05:29:56.239
FEELING ONE WANTED THAT TO CAN 
MAKE MAKE A IT STOP.STOP.

05:30:00.447 --> 05:30:02.899
THE MAC WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH, HE HAS TO 

05:30:03.112 --> 05:30:05.173
COME OUT AND TELL HIS SUPPORTERS
TO LEAVE THE CAPITAL GROUNDS, 

05:30:05.373 --> 05:30:09.688
AND TO ALLOW THE CONGRESS TO DO 
THEIR BUSINESS PEACEFULLY AND 

05:30:09.889 --> 05:30:11.889
ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT IS

05:30:16.038 --> 05:30:17.077
A NAVIGATION OF HIS 
RESPONSIBILITY. 

05:30:17.078 --> 05:30:22.166
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A GUY THAT KNOWS HOW TO TREAT
TWEET. AGGRESSIVELY ON TWITTER 

05:30:22.567 --> 05:30:28.066
-- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PRESENCE, ON SOCIAL MEDIA

05:30:28.214 --> 05:30:35.248
AND IN HIS SPEECH THAT DAY. HE 
DELIBERATELY PROMOTED FACELESS 

05:30:35.451 --> 05:30:37.433
THEORIES CREATING A COMBUSTIBLE 
ENVIRONMENT OF MISINFORMATION 

05:30:37.434 --> 05:30:39.434
AND DIVISION

05:30:43.693 --> 05:30:45.709
TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TO INCITE THIS 

05:30:45.913 --> 05:30:47.989
ATTACK WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES IS A
DIRECT THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF 

05:30:48.749 --> 05:30:50.749
THIS DEMOCRACY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DID THE PRESIDENT ENCOURAGE 

05:30:51.185 --> 05:30:55.473
VIOLENCE? YES. NO DOUBT THAT HE 
DID. FINAL QUESTION

05:30:59.040 --> 05:31:02.927
. DID THE PRESIDENT ACT 
WILLFULLY IN HIS ACTIONS THAT 

05:31:03.679 --> 05:31:05.679
ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE?

05:31:08.964 --> 05:31:13.809
WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS. 
HE STOOD BEFORE AN ARMED, ANGRY 

05:31:13.970 --> 05:31:21.687
CROWD, KNOWN TO BE READY FOR 
VIOLENCE AT HIS PROVOCATION, AND

05:31:21.889 --> 05:31:27.199
WHAT DID HE DO? HE PROVOKES 
THEM. HE AIMED THEM HERE AND 

05:31:27.400 --> 05:31:34.120
TOLD THEM TO FIGHT LIKE  AND 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. 

05:31:34.271 --> 05:31:38.885
AND HIS CONDUCT THROUGHOUT THE 
REST OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY REALLY

05:31:39.648 --> 05:31:44.041
ONLY CONFIRMS THAT HE ACTED 
WILLFULLY. THAT HE INCITED THE 

05:31:44.815 --> 05:31:49.578
CROWD AND ENGAGED IN A 
DERELICTION OF DUTY WHILE HE 

05:31:49.784 --> 05:31:53.811
CONTINUED INFLAMING THE VIOLENCE
. AND AGAIN, WE DON'T HAVE TO 

05:31:53.956 --> 05:32:00.609
GUESS WHAT HE THOUGHT BECAUSE HE
TOLD US. REMEMBER THE VIDEO HE 

05:32:00.777 --> 05:32:04.038
RELEASED AT 4:17 P.M., LEAD 
MANAGER RASKIN

05:32:09.880 --> 05:32:12.369
SHOWED THAT TO YOU YESTERDAY, 
THE ONE WHERE HE SAID, WE HAD AN

05:32:12.573 --> 05:32:14.639
ELECTION THAT WAS STOLEN FROM 
US, REMEMBER THE TWEET THAT HE 

05:32:14.840 --> 05:32:17.923
PUT OUT, JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS 
LATER, 6:01 P.M., YOU'VE SEEN IT

05:32:18.680 --> 05:32:22.896
MANY TIMES. YOU COULD SEE IT ON 
THE SLIDE, THAT THESE ARE THE 

05:32:23.095 --> 05:32:28.835
THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN A SACRED
LANDSLIDE ELECTION VICTORY IS SO

05:32:29.051 --> 05:32:31.051
VICIOUSLY STRIPPED AWAY

05:32:33.788 --> 05:32:41.074
. THAT IS WHAT HE WAS FOCUSED 
ON. SPREADING THE BIG LIE, AND 

05:32:41.275 --> 05:32:45.256
PRAISING THE MOB THAT ATTACKED 
US AND OUR GOVERNMENT. YOU HEARD

05:32:46.736 --> 05:32:48.736
MANAGER SICILY

05:32:52.100 --> 05:32:54.057
DESCRIBE REPORTS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS DELIGHTED, 

05:32:54.058 --> 05:32:59.601
ENTHUSIASTIC THAT OTHERS DIDN'T 
SHARE HIS EXCITEMENT AS HE 

05:32:59.756 --> 05:33:04.289
WATCHED IT UNFOLD ON TV? HE 
CARED MORE ABOUT

05:33:08.086 --> 05:33:10.086
PRESSING HIS EFFORTS TO OVERTURN
THE ELECTION ABOUT

05:33:13.423 --> 05:33:17.312
THEN HE DID ABOUT SAVING LIVES, 
OUR LIVES. LOOK AT WHAT 

05:33:17.514 --> 05:33:22.328
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID THAT DAY 
AFTER THE RALLY. IT'S IMPORTANT.

05:33:24.931 --> 05:33:26.931
HE DID VIRTUALLY NOTHING.

05:33:34.776 --> 05:33:36.607
MANAGER CASTRO MENTIONED THIS, 
THAT WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS 

05:33:36.608 --> 05:33:44.282
TO STOP SOMETHING HE DOES SO, 
SIMPLY, EASILY, QUICKLY. THAT 

05:33:44.687 --> 05:33:46.687
ASIDE FROM FOUR TWEETS

05:33:49.425 --> 05:33:52.231
AND A SHORT CLIP DURING THE OVER
FIVE HOUR-LONG ATTACK, HE DID 

05:33:52.374 --> 05:33:54.374
NOTHING.

05:33:56.842 --> 05:34:01.146
ON JANUARY 6, HE DIDN'T CONDEMN 
THE ATTACK, HE DIDN'T CONDEMN 

05:34:01.905 --> 05:34:09.349
THE ATTACKERS, DIDN'T SAY THAT 
HE WOULD SEND HELP TO DEFEND US,

05:34:09.552 --> 05:34:11.552
OR DEFEND LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:34:13.878 --> 05:34:18.745
. HE DIDN'T REACT TO THE 
VIOLENCE WITH SHOCK OR OR HOLDER

05:34:23.597 --> 05:34:25.862
AS WE DID, HE DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY
RUSH TO TWITTER AND DEMAND IN 

05:34:26.619 --> 05:34:28.619
THE CLEAREST

05:34:30.793 --> 05:34:32.793
POSSIBLE TERMS THAT THE MOB 
DISPERSED, THAT THEY STOP IT, 

05:34:32.882 --> 05:34:34.882
THAT THEY RETREAT, INSTEAD, HE 
ISSUED MESSAGES IN THE AFTERNOON

05:34:34.954 --> 05:34:40.119
THAT SIDED WITH THEM. THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS WHO HAD LEFT 

05:34:40.333 --> 05:34:43.886
POLICE OFFICERS BATTERED AND 
BLOODIED

05:34:47.891 --> 05:34:52.982
. HE REACTED EXACTLY THE WAY 
SOMEONE WOULD REACT IF THEY WERE

05:34:53.129 --> 05:34:58.755
DELIGHTED. AND EXACTLY UNLIKE 
HOW A PERSON WOULD REACT IF THEY

05:34:58.907 --> 05:35:02.071
WERE ANGRY AT HOW THEIR 
FOLLOWERS WERE ACTING

05:35:11.523 --> 05:35:13.790
. AGAIN, ASK YOURSELF HOW MANY 
LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED, HOW

05:35:13.991 --> 05:35:16.266
MUCH PAIN AND TRAUMA WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AVOIDED, IF HE HAD REACTED 

05:35:16.468 --> 05:35:19.425
THE WAY THAT A PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES IS SUPPOSED TO ACT

05:35:20.387 --> 05:35:25.893
. THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAILURE HERE, 

05:35:26.097 --> 05:35:29.745
HIS DERELICTION OF DUTY, THAT I 
JUST HAVE TO EMPHASIZE FOR A 

05:35:29.884 --> 05:35:36.699
MOMENT. FIRST, IS WHAT HE DID TO
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE

05:35:41.764 --> 05:35:43.798
, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HIS 

05:35:44.018 --> 05:35:46.669
OWN VICE PRESIDENT. HE WAS IN 
THIS BUILDING, WITH AN ARMED MOB

05:35:47.287 --> 05:35:50.855
SHOUTING, HANG HIM. THE SAME 
ARMED BOB

05:35:54.897 --> 05:35:58.201
THAT SET OUT GALLOWS OUTSIDE, 
YOU SAW THOSE PICTURES. AND WHAT

05:35:58.404 --> 05:36:05.351
DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? HE 
ATTACKS THE MORE, HE SINGLED HIM

05:36:05.552 --> 05:36:10.760
OUT BY NAME. IT'S HONESTLY HARD 
TO FATHOM

05:36:15.186 --> 05:36:19.985
. SECOND, OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
THE BRAVE OFFICERS

05:36:30.161 --> 05:36:32.234
WHO WERE SACRIFICING THEIR LIVES
TO DEFEND US, WHO COULD NOT 

05:36:32.432 --> 05:36:34.463
EVACUATE OR SEEK COVER BECAUSE 
THEY WERE PROTECTING US, I'M NOT

05:36:34.664 --> 05:36:36.712
GOING TO GO THROUGH AGAIN WHAT 
MY FELLOW MANAGER SHOWED YOU 

05:36:36.913 --> 05:36:38.913
YESTERDAY. LET ME JUST SAY THIS.
THOSE OFFICERS SERVE US 

05:36:38.961 --> 05:36:41.470
FAITHFULLY AND DUTIFULLY, AND 
THEY FOLLOW THEIR OATH'S. THEY 

05:36:41.673 --> 05:36:45.510
DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO UPHOLD 
HIS, WHO WOULD NOT RISK THEIR 

05:36:45.654 --> 05:36:51.957
LIVES AND SAFETY TO RETAIN 
POWER, A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD 

05:36:52.373 --> 05:36:56.381
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND 
THEM. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE DID.

05:37:00.008 --> 05:37:02.875
WHEN THEY, THE POLICE, STILL 
BARRICADED AND BEING ATTACKED 

05:37:03.630 --> 05:37:05.630
WITH POLLS

05:37:09.451 --> 05:37:12.691
, HE SAID IN HIS VIDEO, TO THE 
PEOPLE ATTACKING THEM, WE LOVE 

05:37:12.840 --> 05:37:21.141
YOU. YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL. WHAT 
MORE COULD 

05:37:22.944 --> 05:37:26.580
TO KNOW ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
STATE OF MIND?

05:37:30.936 --> 05:37:34.128
SENATORS, THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR

05:37:37.779 --> 05:37:42.542
, WE'VE SHOWN YOU STATEMENTS, 
VIDEOS, AFFIDAVITS, THAT PROVE 

05:37:42.949 --> 05:37:46.862
PRESIDENT TRUMP INCITED AN 
INSURRECTION. AN INSURRECTION 

05:37:47.063 --> 05:37:49.403
THAT HE ALONE HAD THE POWER TO 
STOP

05:37:53.192 --> 05:37:56.409
. IN THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T 
STOP IT, THE FACT THAT HE 

05:37:56.555 --> 05:38:00.729
INCITED A LAWLESS ATTACK AND 
ABDICATED HIS DUTY TO DEFEND US 

05:38:01.502 --> 05:38:05.409
FROM IT, THE FACT THAT HE 
ACTUALLY FURTHER INFLAMED THE 

05:38:05.553 --> 05:38:08.917
MOB, FURTHER INFLAMED THAT 
MODEL, ATTACKING HIS VICE 

05:38:09.056 --> 05:38:14.118
PRESIDENT WHILE ASSASSINS WERE 
PURSUING HIM, IN THIS CAPITAL 

05:38:14.521 --> 05:38:21.963
MORE THAN REQUIRES CONVICTION 
AND DISQUALIFICATION. WE HUMBLY

05:38:23.932 --> 05:38:29.442
HUMBLY ASK YOU TO CONVICT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE CRIME 

05:38:29.659 --> 05:38:31.811
FOR WHICH HE IS OVERWHELMINGLY 
GUILTY OF

05:38:35.059 --> 05:38:42.579
, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, IF WE 
ATTEND THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN OR 

05:38:42.725 --> 05:38:51.096
WORSE, IF WE LET IT GO 
UNANSWERED, WHO IS TO SAY IT 

05:38:51.297 --> 05:38:54.930
WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

05:39:10.584 --> 05:39:12.861
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU 

05:39:13.062 --> 05:39:16.545
FOR YOUR CLOSE ATTENTION AND 
SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE THAT YOU 

05:39:16.746 --> 05:39:20.023
HAVE DEMONSTRATED OVER THE LAST 
FEW DAYS, THANK YOU ALSO FOR 

05:39:20.239 --> 05:39:23.316
YOUR COURTESY TO THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS, AS WE HAVE COME OVER 

05:39:23.530 --> 05:39:26.155
HERE, STRANGERS IN A STRANGE 
LAND, TO MAKE HER CASE BEFORE 

05:39:26.288 --> 05:39:32.290
THIS DISTINGUISHED BODY. WE ARE 
ABOUT TO CLOSE AND I AM PROUD 

05:39:32.440 --> 05:39:37.645
THAT OUR MANAGERS HAVE BEEN SO 
DISCIPLINED AND SO FOCUSED, I 

05:39:37.849 --> 05:39:39.849
THINK WE ARE CLOSING SOMEWHERE 
BETWEEN

05:39:46.476 --> 05:39:49.339
5 TO 6 HOURS UNDER THE TIME THAT
YOU HAVE ALLOTTED TO US. BUT WE 

05:39:49.544 --> 05:39:52.032
THINK WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL 
YOU EVERYTHING WE NEED TO SAY, 

05:39:52.235 --> 05:39:54.235
HE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE 

05:39:54.625 --> 05:39:58.380
QUESTIONS AND TO DO A FINAL 
CLOSING, WHEN WE GET THERE. I 

05:39:58.592 --> 05:40:04.704
JUST WANTED TO LEAVE YOU WITH A 
FEW THOUGHTS AND AGAIN, I'M NOT 

05:40:04.905 --> 05:40:06.967
GOING TO READ TRAUMATIZED YOU BY
GOING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE ONCE 

05:40:07.168 --> 05:40:09.436
AGAIN, I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE 
YOU WITH A FEW THOUGHTS TO 

05:40:09.637 --> 05:40:13.129
CONSIDER, AS YOU ENTER UPON THIS
VERY HIGH AND DIFFICULT DUTY 

05:40:13.342 --> 05:40:18.878
THAT YOU HAVE TO RENDER 
IMPARTIAL JUSTICE IN THIS CASE, 

05:40:19.081 --> 05:40:23.752
AS YOU OF ALL SWORN TO DO. AND I
WANTED TO START SIMPLY BY 

05:40:23.890 --> 05:40:28.296
SAYING, THAT IN THE HISTORY OF 
HUMANITY, DEMOCRACY IS AN 

05:40:29.056 --> 05:40:32.802
EXTREMELY RARE AND FRAGILE AND 
PRECARIOUS AND TRANSITORY THING.

05:40:33.234 --> 05:40:36.696
ABRAHAM LINCOLN KNEW THAT WHEN 
HE SPOKE FROM THE BATTLEFIELD 

05:40:37.111 --> 05:40:45.693
AND VOWED THAT GOVERNMENT OF THE
PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE SHALL 

05:40:45.898 --> 05:40:48.154
NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH, BUT 
HE WAS SPEAKING NOT LONG AFTER 

05:40:48.355 --> 05:40:50.355
THE REPUBLIC WAS CREATED

05:40:55.893 --> 05:40:58.400
AND HE WAS TRYING TO PROVE THAT 
POINT, THAT WE WOULD NOT ALLOW 

05:40:58.603 --> 05:41:01.072
IT TO PERISH FROM THE EARTH. FOR
MOST OF HISTORY, THE NORM HAS 

05:41:01.276 --> 05:41:07.646
BEEN DICTATORS, AUTOCRATS, 
BULLIES, DESPOTS, TYRANTS, 

05:41:08.053 --> 05:41:11.929
COWARDS, WHO TAKE OVER OUR 
GOVERNMENT. FOR MOST OF THE 

05:41:12.143 --> 05:41:16.569
HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND THAT 
IS WHY AMERICA IS SUCH A 

05:41:16.725 --> 05:41:18.725
MIRACLE.

05:41:20.720 --> 05:41:23.003
WE WERE FOUNDED ON THE 
EXTRAORDINARY PRINCIPLES OF 

05:41:23.409 --> 05:41:29.129
INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE
AND THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED,

05:41:29.333 --> 05:41:31.921
AND THE FUNDAMENTAL EQUALITY OF 
ALL OF US.

05:41:35.538 --> 05:41:39.105
YOU KNOW, WHEN LINCOLN SAID, 
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE,

05:41:42.923 --> 05:41:45.414
BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE
AND HE HARKENS BACK TO THE 

05:41:46.191 --> 05:41:48.681
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHEN
HE SAID FOURSCORE AND SEVEN 

05:41:48.882 --> 05:41:52.954
YEARS AGO, HE KNEW THAT WASN'T 
HOW WE STARTED, WE STARTED HIM 

05:41:53.155 --> 05:41:56.407
PERFECTLY, WE STARTED AS A SLAVE
REPUBLIC, LINCOLN KNEW THAT, BUT

05:41:56.608 --> 05:42:00.901
HE WAS STRUGGLING TO MAKE THE 
COUNTRY BETTER. AND HOWEVER 

05:42:01.103 --> 05:42:06.614
FLAWED THE FATHERS WERE AS MEN 
IN THEIR TIMES, THEY INSCRIBED 

05:42:06.832 --> 05:42:09.073
IN THE DECLARATION OF 
INDEPENDENCE AND THE 

05:42:09.273 --> 05:42:12.334
CONSTITUTION, ALL OF THE 
BEAUTIFUL PRINCIPLES THAT WE 

05:42:12.512 --> 05:42:17.437
NEEDED TO OPEN AMERICA UP, TWO 
SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF POLITICAL 

05:42:17.639 --> 05:42:19.639
STRUGGLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
CHANGE

05:42:22.570 --> 05:42:24.412
AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE 
COUNTRY, SO WE REALLY WOULD 

05:42:24.413 --> 05:42:26.643
BECOME SOMETHING MUCH MORE LIKE 
LINCOLN'S BEAUTIFUL VISION OF 

05:42:26.799 --> 05:42:30.550
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE
PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE, THE 

05:42:30.698 --> 05:42:38.487
WORLD'S GREATEST MULTIRACIAL, 
MULTI-RELIGIOUS, MULTIETHNIC 

05:42:38.898 --> 05:42:40.898
CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, THE 
ENVY OF THE WORLD

05:42:44.847 --> 05:42:51.047
AS TOM PAINE SAID, AN ASYLUM FOR
HUMANITY, WHERE PEOPLE WOULD 

05:42:51.263 --> 05:42:54.222
COME. THINK ABOUT THE PREAMBLE, 
THE FIRST

05:42:58.244 --> 05:43:00.850
THREE WORDS PREGNANT WITH SO 
MUCH MEANING. WE THE PEOPLE. AND

05:43:00.989 --> 05:43:05.581
THEN, ALL OF THE PURPOSES OF OUR
GOVERNMENT PUT INTO THAT ONE 

05:43:05.727 --> 05:43:13.571
ACTION-PACKED SENTENCED. WE THE 
PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE 

05:43:13.718 --> 05:43:15.718
PERFECT

05:43:20.561 --> 05:43:22.205
UNION, ESTABLISH JUSTICE, 
PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE, 

05:43:22.206 --> 05:43:23.855
PROMOTE THE GENERAL WHERE 
WELFARE AND PRESERVE TO 

05:43:23.856 --> 05:43:28.985
OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY THE 
BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY. AND THEN, 

05:43:29.198 --> 05:43:32.614
RIGHT AFTER THAT FIRST SENTENCE,
THE MISSION STATEMENT IN THE 

05:43:32.758 --> 05:43:34.758
CONSTITUTION

05:43:40.249 --> 05:43:42.249
, WHAT HAPPENS? ARTICLE 1, THE 
CONGRESS IS CREATED. ALL 

05:43:42.305 --> 05:43:46.184
LEGISLATIVE POWERS HEREIN, ARE 
RESERVED TO THE CONGRESS OF THE 

05:43:46.387 --> 05:43:48.387
UNITED STATES. DO YOU SEE WHAT 
JUST HAPPENED? THE SOVEREIGN 

05:43:48.441 --> 05:43:52.980
POWER OF THE PEOPLE, TO LAUNCH 
THE COUNTRY AND CREATE THE 

05:43:53.182 --> 05:43:55.182
CONSTITUTION, FLOWED RIGHT INTO 
CONGRESS AND THEN, YOU GET AN 

05:43:55.228 --> 05:43:59.371
ARTICLE 1 SECTION 8, 
COMPREHENSIVE VAST POWERS THAT 

05:43:59.585 --> 05:44:01.585
ALL OF YOU KNOW

05:44:07.564 --> 05:44:09.410
SO WELL. THE POWER TO REGULATE, 
CONGRESS, DOMESTICALLY AND 

05:44:09.411 --> 05:44:11.411
INTERNATIONALLY, THE POWER TO 
DECLARE WAR, THE POWER TO RAISE 

05:44:11.445 --> 05:44:13.445
BUDGETS AND TAXES AND

05:44:16.346 --> 05:44:18.393
TO SPEND MONEY, THE POWER TO 
GOVERN THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT 

05:44:18.609 --> 05:44:20.609
AND ON AND ON AND ON AND

05:44:27.015 --> 05:44:29.056
IN CLAUSE 18, ALL OTHER POWERS 
NECESSARY AND PROPER TO THE 

05:44:29.255 --> 05:44:31.255
EXECUTION OF THE FOREGOING 
POWERS, THAT'S ALL OF US, AND 

05:44:31.294 --> 05:44:33.351
THEN YOU GET TO ARTICLE 2, THE 
PRESIDENT, FOR SHORT PARAGRAPHS.

05:44:33.553 --> 05:44:35.598
IN THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH IS ALL 
ABOUT WHAT? IMPEACHMENT, HOW YOU

05:44:35.800 --> 05:44:37.800
GET RID OF THE PRESIDENT WHO 
COMMITS

05:44:42.152 --> 05:44:44.375
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS BUT
WHAT IS THE CORE JOB OF THE 

05:44:44.576 --> 05:44:46.613
PRESIDENT? TO TAKE CARE THAT THE
LAWS ARE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED. 

05:44:46.817 --> 05:44:48.817
OUR FRAMERS WERE SO FEARFUL

05:44:52.144 --> 05:44:54.144
OF PRESIDENTS BECOMING TYRANTS 
AND WANTING TO BECOME KINGS AND 

05:44:54.208 --> 05:44:58.550
DESPOTS THAT THEY PUT THE OATH 
OF OFFICE RIGHT INTO THE 

05:44:58.765 --> 05:45:01.840
CONSTITUTION, THEY INSCRIBED IT 
INTO THE CONSTITUTION TO 

05:45:02.058 --> 05:45:04.619
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION.

05:45:11.306 --> 05:45:15.795
WE'VE GOT THE POWER TO IMPEACH 
THE PRESIDENT, THE POWER DOESN'T

05:45:15.998 --> 05:45:18.131
HAVE THE POWER TO IMPEACH US, 
THINK ABOUT THAT.

05:45:24.188 --> 05:45:26.232
THE POPULAR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT
HAS THE POWER TO IMPEACH THE 

05:45:26.437 --> 05:45:28.437
PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT DOES 
NOT HAVE THE POWER TO IMPEACH 

05:45:28.485 --> 05:45:32.996
US. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, ALL OF
US WHO ASPIRE TO PUBLIC OFFICE 

05:45:33.197 --> 05:45:38.169
ARE NOTHING BUT THE SERVANTS OF 
THE PEOPLE IN THE MOMENT THAT WE

05:45:38.386 --> 05:45:41.038
NO LONGER ACT AS SERVANTS OF THE
PEOPLE BUT AS MASTERS OF THE 

05:45:41.241 --> 05:45:43.241
PEOPLE, THAT WAS THE TIME

05:45:51.317 --> 05:45:52.963
TO IMPEACH, REMOVE, CONVICT, 
DISQUALIFY, START ALL OVER 

05:45:52.964 --> 05:45:55.649
AGAIN, BECAUSE, THE INTEREST OF 
THE PEOPLE ARE SO MUCH GREATER 

05:45:56.016 --> 05:45:58.079
THAN THE INTEREST OF ONE PERSON,
ANY ONE PERSON, EVEN THE 

05:45:58.279 --> 05:46:00.328
GREATEST PERSON IN THE COUNTRY, 
THE INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE ARE 

05:46:01.091 --> 05:46:07.368
WHAT COUNTS. NOW, WHEN WE SIT 
DOWN AND WE CLOSE

05:46:10.981 --> 05:46:14.920
, OUR DISTINGUISHED 
COUNTERPARTS, THE COUNSEL WHO 

05:46:15.136 --> 05:46:17.182
HAVE WAITED VERY PATIENTLY, AND 
THANK YOU, WILL STAND UP AND 

05:46:17.383 --> 05:46:20.369
SEEK TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONDUCT ON THE FACT.

05:46:24.537 --> 05:46:26.596
AS I THINK THEY WILL, IT'S 
ALREADY BEEN DECIDED BY THE 

05:46:26.798 --> 05:46:29.407
SENATE, ON TUESDAY, THAT THE 
SENATE HAS CONSTITUTIONAL 

05:46:29.569 --> 05:46:31.569
JURISDICTION

05:46:33.759 --> 05:46:35.759
OVER THIS IMPEACHMENT CASE 
BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE UNITED 

05:46:35.808 --> 05:46:40.536
STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
SO, WE HAVE PUT THAT 

05:46:40.738 --> 05:46:43.222
JURISDICTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL 
ISSUE TO BED. IT'S OVER, IT'S 

05:46:43.423 --> 05:46:48.707
ALREADY BEEN VOTED ON THE STATE 
TRIAL IN THE FACTS OF WHAT 

05:46:48.860 --> 05:46:50.860
HAPPENED.

05:46:55.065 --> 05:46:57.065
INCITEMENT, AS WE SAID, IS A 
FACT INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION AND

05:46:57.109 --> 05:46:59.253
JUDGMENT THAT EACH OF YOU WILL 
HAVE TO MAKE.

05:47:03.861 --> 05:47:05.897
WE'VE MADE OUR VERY BEST EFFORT 
TO SET FORTH EVERY SINGLE 

05:47:06.098 --> 05:47:08.170
RELEVANT FACTS THAT WE KNOW IN 
THE MOST OBJECTIVE AND HONEST 

05:47:08.386 --> 05:47:10.464
LIGHT. THE TRUST AND WE HOPE 
THAT THE DEFENSE WILL UNDERSTAND

05:47:10.678 --> 05:47:13.666
THE CONSTITUTIONAL GRAVITY AND 
SALINITY OF THIS

05:47:18.896 --> 05:47:20.926
TRIAL BY FOCUSING LIKE A 
LASERBEAM ON THE FACTS AND NOT 

05:47:21.127 --> 05:47:23.127
RETURN TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
ARGUMENT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN 

05:47:23.246 --> 05:47:28.268
DECIDED BY THE SENATE. JUST AS A
DEFENSE LAWYER WHO MOVES LOSES A

05:47:28.471 --> 05:47:30.471
MOTION TO DISMISS, ON A 
CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS

05:47:35.626 --> 05:47:38.266
IN A CRIMINAL CASE MUST LET THAT
GO AND FOCUS ON THE FACTS WHICH 

05:47:38.468 --> 05:47:40.468
ARE BEING PRESENTED BY THE 
PROSECUTORS IN DETAIL, THEY MUST

05:47:40.498 --> 05:47:41.932
LET THIS CONSTITUTIONAL 
JURISDICTIONAL ARGUMENT GO, NOT 

05:47:41.933 --> 05:47:44.479
JUST BECAUSE IT'S FRIVOLOUS AND 
WRONG AS NEARLY EVER EVERY SPURT

05:47:44.989 --> 05:47:49.478
SCHOLAR OPINED BUT BECAUSE IT'S 
NOT RELEVANT TO THE JURY'S 

05:47:45.006 --> 05:47:49.495
SCHOLAR OPINED BUT BECAUSE IT'S 
NOT RELEVANT TO THE JURY'S 

05:47:49.699 --> 05:47:53.765
CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTS OF 
THE CASE. SO OUR FRIENDS MUST 

05:47:53.968 --> 05:47:58.137
WORK TO ANSWER ALL OF THE 
OVERWHELMING DETAILED, SPECIFIC

05:48:04.604 --> 05:48:06.430
, FACTUAL AND DOCUMENTARY 
EVIDENCE WE HAVE INTRODUCED OF 

05:48:06.431 --> 05:48:08.069
THE PRESIDENTS CLEAR AND 
OVERWHELMING GUILT IN INCITING 

05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:10.070
VIOLENCE INSURRECTION AGAINST 
THE UNION

05:48:12.961 --> 05:48:15.133
. DONALD TRUMP LAST WEEK TURNED 
DOWN OUR INVITATION

05:48:22.350 --> 05:48:24.350
TO COME TESTIFY ABOUT HIS 
ACTIONS, AND THEREFORE, WE HAVE 

05:48:24.384 --> 05:48:26.613
NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASK HIM ANY 
QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AS OF THIS 

05:48:26.817 --> 05:48:29.205
POINT, THEREFORE, DURING THE 
COURSE OF THEIR 16 HOUR ALLOTTED

05:48:29.349 --> 05:48:31.349
PRESENTATION, WE WOULD POST 
THESE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS TO 

05:48:31.634 --> 05:48:37.016
HIS LAWYERS WHICH I THINK ARE ON
EVERYONE'S MINDS RIGHT NOW, IN 

05:48:37.220 --> 05:48:42.334
WHICH WE WOULD HAVE ASKED MR. 
TRUMP HIMSELF, IF HE HAD CHOSEN 

05:48:42.540 --> 05:48:44.575
TO COME AND TESTIFY ABOUT HIS 
ACTIONS AND INACTIONS WHEN WE 

05:48:44.777 --> 05:48:48.646
INVITED HIM LAST WEEK. NUMBER 1,
WHY DID PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT TELL

05:48:49.403 --> 05:48:53.769
HIS SUPPORTERS TO STOP THE 
ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL AS SOON AS

05:48:53.973 --> 05:48:57.427
HE LEARNED OF IT? WHY DID 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DO NOTHING TO 

05:48:57.643 --> 05:49:02.907
STOP THE ATTACK FOR AT LEAST TWO
HOURS AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN?

05:49:09.544 --> 05:49:11.400
IS THERE CONSTITUTIONAL 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF, WHY DID HE 

05:49:11.401 --> 05:49:15.267
DO NOTHING TO SEND HELP TO OUR 
OVERWHELMED AND BESIEGED LAW 

05:49:15.472 --> 05:49:19.133
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR AT 
LEAST TWO HOURS ON JANUARY 16, 

05:49:19.334 --> 05:49:24.643
AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN? ON 
JANUARY 6, WHY DID PRESIDENT 

05:49:24.849 --> 05:49:28.661
TRUMP NOT IT ANY POINT THAT DAY 
CONDEMNED THE VIOLENCE 

05:49:28.816 --> 05:49:33.655
INSURRECTION AND THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS AND I WILL ADD 

05:49:33.872 --> 05:49:37.947
A LEGAL QUESTION THAT I HOPE HIS
DISTINGUISHED COUNSEL WILL 

05:49:38.148 --> 05:49:40.796
ADDRESS. IF A PRESIDENT DID 
INVITE A VIOLENT INSURRECTION 

05:49:41.013 --> 05:49:43.013
AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT, AS OF 
COURSE

05:49:51.052 --> 05:49:53.317
WE ALLEGE AND THINK THAT WE'VE 
PROVEN BUT JUST IN GENERAL, IF 

05:49:53.519 --> 05:49:55.142
THE PRESIDENT CITED A VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION AGAINST OUR 

05:49:55.143 --> 05:49:57.178
GOVERNMENT, WOULD THAT BE A HIGH
CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR, COULD WE 

05:49:57.381 --> 05:50:01.254
ALL AGREE AT LEAST ON THAT? 
SENATORS, I'VE TALKED A LOT 

05:50:01.454 --> 05:50:08.606
ABOUT COMMON SENSE IN THIS TRIAL
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ALL YOU 

05:50:08.808 --> 05:50:14.536
NEED TO ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT 
ANSWER HERE YOU KNOW, WHEN TOM 

05:50:14.738 --> 05:50:19.837
PAINE WROTE COMMON SENSE, THE 
PAMPHLET THAT LAUNCHED THE 

05:50:20.040 --> 05:50:24.714
AMERICAN REVOLUTION, HE SAID 
COMMON SENSE REALLY MEANT TWO 

05:50:24.918 --> 05:50:28.390
DIFFERENT THINGS. ONE, COMMON 
SENSE IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT 

05:50:28.593 --> 05:50:33.666
WE ALL HAVE WITHOUT ADVANCED 
LEARNING AND EDUCATION, COMMON 

05:50:33.822 --> 05:50:35.822
SENSE IS THE SENSE

05:50:39.442 --> 05:50:41.442
ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY BUT 
COMMON SENSE IS ALSO THE SENSE 

05:50:41.471 --> 05:50:43.606
THAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON, AS A
COMMUNITY.

05:50:47.192 --> 05:50:51.069
SENATORS, AMERICA, WE NEED TO 
EXERCISE OUR COMMON SENSE ABOUT 

05:50:51.833 --> 05:50:53.833
WHAT HAPPENED

05:50:55.762 --> 05:50:58.302
. LET'S NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN A 
LOT OF OUTLANDISH

05:51:01.895 --> 05:51:03.895
LAWYERS THEORIES HERE. EXERCISE 
YOUR COMMON SENSE ABOUT WHAT 

05:51:04.295 --> 05:51:07.565
JUST TOOK PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY. 
TOM PAINE

05:51:11.313 --> 05:51:16.008
WASN'T AN AMERICAN, AS YOU KNOW,
BUT HE CAME OVER TO HELP US, IN 

05:51:16.211 --> 05:51:18.211
OUR GREAT REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE KINGS AND QUEENS AND

05:51:18.813 --> 05:51:26.053
THE TYRANTS, AND IN 1776, IN THE
CRISIS, HE WROTE, THESE 

05:51:26.258 --> 05:51:31.419
BEAUTIFUL WORDS, IT WAS A VERY 
TOUGH TIME FOR THE COUNTRY. 

05:51:31.634 --> 05:51:33.895
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY 
THINGS WERE GOING TO GO, WERE WE

05:51:34.114 --> 05:51:36.114
GOING TO WIN AGAINST

05:51:40.454 --> 05:51:42.701
ALL HOPE, BECAUSE FOR MOST OF 
THE REST OF HUMAN HISTORY, IT 

05:51:42.905 --> 05:51:44.952
HAD BEEN THE KINGS AND QUEENS 
AND TYRANTS AND NOBLES, LORDING 

05:51:45.155 --> 05:51:47.208
IT OVER THE COMMON PEOPLE, GOOD 
POLITICAL SELF-GOVERNMENT WORK 

05:51:47.414 --> 05:51:49.523
IN AMERICA, THAT WAS THE 
QUESTION. AND PAINE WROTE

05:51:54.184 --> 05:51:56.239
THIS PAMPHLET CALLED THE CRISIS,
AND IN IT, HE SAID THESE 

05:51:56.454 --> 05:51:58.454
BEAUTIFUL WORDS AND WITH YOUR 
PERMISSION I WILL UPDATE THE 

05:51:58.500 --> 05:52:01.547
LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT PURSUANT 
TO A SUGGESTION OF SPEAKER 

05:52:01.698 --> 05:52:03.656
PELOSI, SO AS NOT TO OFFEND 
MODERN SENSIBILITIES. BUT HE 

05:52:03.657 --> 05:52:08.599
SAID THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT 
TRY MEN AND WOMEN'S SOULS, THESE

05:52:08.802 --> 05:52:12.713
ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN AND 
WOMEN'S SOULS, THE SUMMER 

05:52:12.914 --> 05:52:14.914
SOLDIER AND THE SUNSHINE PATRIOT
WILL

05:52:18.016 --> 05:52:20.285
SHRINK AT THIS MOMENT FROM THE 
SERVICE OF THE CAUSE AND COUNTRY

05:52:20.488 --> 05:52:23.581
BUT EVERYONE WHO STANDS WITH US 
NOW WILL WIN THE LOVE AND THE 

05:52:23.797 --> 05:52:26.792
FAVOR AND THE AFFECTION OF EVERY
MAN AND EVERY WOMAN FOR ALL TIME

05:52:28.347 --> 05:52:32.042
,  TYRANNY, LIKE , IS NOT EASILY
CONQUERED BUT  WE HAVE THIS 

05:52:32.243 --> 05:52:34.893
SEEMING CONSOLATION THROUGH MORE
DIFFICULT THE STRUGGLE, THE MORE

05:52:35.095 --> 05:52:40.144
GLORIOUS IN THE END WILL BE OUR 
VICTORY. GOOD LUCK IN YOUR 

05:52:40.286 --> 05:52:42.286
DELIBERATIONS.

05:52:50.094 --> 05:52:57.175

. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO I HEAR ANY OBJECTION, IT'S

05:54:25.746 --> 05:54:27.187
ORDERED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND FINALLY MR. PRESIDENT, I 

05:54:27.188 --> 05:54:29.048
ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THE TRIAL

AND IT'S ALSO CONSTITUTE THE 

05:54:30.894 --> 05:54:37.032
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE IS ADJOURNED. 

05:54:37.033 --> 05:54:39.033
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITH THAT

05:54:57.507 --> 05:54:58.949
GAVEL, HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS HAVE CONCLUDED THEIR 

05:54:58.950 --> 05:55:00.790
OPENING ARGUMENTS, CHARGING 
DONALD TRUMP WITH A HIGH CRIME 

05:55:00.791 --> 05:55:02.638
AND MISDEMEANOR. THE LEAD 
MANAGER RASKIN LAID ON HIS 

05:55:02.639 --> 05:55:04.639
CAREER AS A TEACHER OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, TO DETAIL A 

05:55:04.691 --> 05:55:06.533
CASE ALLEGING A PATTERN OF 
INCITING VIOLENCE BY DONALD 

05:55:06.534 --> 05:55:08.774
TRUMP. HE TOLD THE SENATE, IN NO
UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT HE FELT 

05:55:08.972 --> 05:55:11.043
DONALD TRUMP REMAINS A THREAT TO
DEMOCRACY, AND TO THEIR SAFETY 

05:55:11.256 --> 05:55:13.320
AND HE SAID FAILURE TO CONVICT 
TRUMP WOULD ENDANGER ANY FUTURE 

05:55:13.536 --> 05:55:15.206
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS WILL 

05:55:15.207 --> 05:55:17.207
GET THEIR TURN

05:55:21.377 --> 05:55:23.377
TOMORROW. LET'S GO NOW TO RHONDA
COLEMAN, CAPITOL HILL REPORTER 

05:55:23.422 --> 05:55:25.422
JAMES HOLMAN, WASHINGTON POST 
COLUMNIST, WE WILL KEEP AN EYE 

05:55:25.480 --> 05:55:27.735
TO SEE IF ANY SENATORS GO TO THE
MICROPHONES, TALK TO REPORTERS, 

05:55:27.950 --> 05:55:30.205
TO GIVE THEIR IMPRESSIONS OF THE
CASE SO FAR, BUT RHONDA, LET'S 

05:55:30.409 --> 05:55:32.682
START WITH YOU, TO GIVE US THE 
BIG PICTURE TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 

05:55:32.883 --> 05:55:34.883
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CASE

05:55:38.223 --> 05:55:39.678
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, THE BULK OF TODAY'S 

05:55:39.679 --> 05:55:41.679
ARGUMENT WAS LOOKING AT THE 
PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS, HIS ROLE 

05:55:42.059 --> 05:55:44.059
AND ALSO

05:55:47.903 --> 05:55:49.903
THE AFTERMATH, THE HARM DONE AS 
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER SAID, 

05:55:49.948 --> 05:55:51.948
WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WAS THE 
FALLOUT, IN THIS LAST PORTION, 

05:55:51.974 --> 05:55:54.234
WHAT WE SAW IS THE A DETAILED 
WITH THE FALLOUT WAS GLOBALLY, 

05:55:54.434 --> 05:55:56.434
THAT SOME OF OUR ALLIES

05:56:06.668 --> 05:56:08.919
, THIS WAS AN EVENT WHERE THEY 
COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE 

05:56:09.120 --> 05:56:11.170
UNITED STATES, AND OUR ENEMIES 
COULD SEE THAT THE CAPITAL WAS 

05:56:11.373 --> 05:56:13.625
VULNERABLE TO AN ATTACK LIKE 
THIS. SO I'M THINKING BACK TO AN

05:56:13.827 --> 05:56:15.827
INTERVIEW THAT I DID WITH 
REPRESENTATIVE WILD, JUST A DAY 

05:56:15.897 --> 05:56:17.897
AFTER THE INSURRECTION, SHE SITS
ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE

05:56:17.969 --> 05:56:20.041
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT WAS 
FOREMOST CONCERN. SHE SAID THAT 

05:56:20.243 --> 05:56:22.499
THAT EVENT OF JANUARY 6, IF THE 
HOUSE AND SENATE DON'T DO 

05:56:22.700 --> 05:56:25.369
ANYTHING TO HOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACCOUNTABLE, THAT IT WOULD LOOK 

05:56:25.583 --> 05:56:28.904
VERY BAD TO BOTH ALLIES AND ALSO
ENEMIES, WHO MAY THINK OF 

05:56:29.105 --> 05:56:31.867
FURTHER ATTACKS TO DO ON THE 
HOMELAND, SO, THAT WAS PART OF

05:56:41.004 --> 05:56:43.455
THIS LAST HALF, THEY WANTED TO 
SHOW WHAT THIS HAS DONE TO US 

05:56:43.656 --> 05:56:45.524
GLOBALLY, AND THAT'S ALSO GIVING
SENATORS JUST ANOTHER OPTION, 

05:56:45.525 --> 05:56:48.565
THEY GAVE A MARRIED OF OPTIONS 
TO SENATORS AS TO WHY THIS FITS 

05:56:48.737 --> 05:56:53.527
A CONVICTION, AND THE FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS ARGUMENT IS A PRETTY 

05:56:53.731 --> 05:56:55.980
STRONG ONE, NOT SURE IF THAT 
WILL CHANGE MINDS OF COURSE OR 

05:56:56.181 --> 05:56:58.436
GET US TO THAT TWO THIRDS, 
THOUGH THAT HE WOULD NEED TO 

05:56:58.651 --> 05:57:03.953
CONVICT HIM BUT THE PATIENT 
MANAGERS, ENDED ON A NOTE 

05:57:04.170 --> 05:57:06.449
SHOWING THAT HARM WAS DONE, THEY
ALSO USED THIS TIME TO SUMMARIZE

05:57:06.651 --> 05:57:08.651
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THEY SAID
YESTERDAY, SHOWING THAT DONALD 

05:57:09.036 --> 05:57:11.036
TRUMP PROVOKED

05:57:13.021 --> 05:57:15.525
IN THE OF TECH ATTACK HAPPENED 
AND HE WAS ABSENT AS IT WAS 

05:57:15.729 --> 05:57:17.779
HAPPENING, SO THAT'S WHAT WE 
JUST SAW IT RIGHT THERE, AND 

05:57:17.980 --> 05:57:19.980
THEY LEFT THAT

05:57:25.765 --> 05:57:27.765
AS THEIR ARGUMENT, PRECEDING THE
ARGUMENT TO COME, FROM TRUMP'S 

05:57:27.848 --> 05:57:29.490
DEFENSE TEAM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU SEE SENATOR HOLLY LIVING 

05:57:29.491 --> 05:57:31.322
THERE, SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN OF 
INTEREST, JAMES, YOU WERE 

05:57:31.323 --> 05:57:33.323
REMINDING US EARLIER

05:57:36.416 --> 05:57:38.466
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STRATEGY 
AND HOW SOME OF THESE 

05:57:38.669 --> 05:57:40.527
REPUBLICANS LIKE HIM, SENATOR 
SCOTT OF FLORIDA ARE REACTING 

05:57:40.528 --> 05:57:41.992
AND TREATING THIS TRIAL AT THIS 
POINT. 

05:57:41.993 --> 05:57:46.305
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY, I GOT A DOZEN 
FUNDRAISING EMAIL SOLICITATION 

05:57:46.507 --> 05:57:48.507
SIGNED BY HOLLY DURING THE 
TRIAL, THEY ARE VERY MUCH 

05:57:48.596 --> 05:57:53.310
PLAYING THE 2024 GAME, AND 
THINKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN 

05:57:53.513 --> 05:57:56.329
BASE, EVERYONE TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT HOW ON THEIR SITE, HOW DO 

05:57:56.514 --> 05:58:01.501
YOU KEEP TRUMP LOYALISTS, BUT 
WHAT IF TRUMP RUNS AGAIN, SO 

05:58:01.911 --> 05:58:04.313
THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME 
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO VOTE TO

05:58:04.452 --> 05:58:06.452
ACQUIT

05:58:09.664 --> 05:58:11.965
THE PRESIDENT, AND WE REALLY DO 
HOPE THAT THIS SIDELINED HIM AND

05:58:12.168 --> 05:58:14.168
PREVENT HIM FROM BEING A FORCE 
GOING FORWARD.

05:58:23.594 --> 05:58:25.847
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I 
THINK THAT THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT

05:58:26.048 --> 05:58:28.103
MANAGERS WERE TRYING TO GET AT, 
WHEN THEY REALLY EMPHASIZED THIS

05:58:28.302 --> 05:58:30.556
AFTERNOON THAT THIS IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN AGAIN, IF THE SENATE DOES

05:58:30.756 --> 05:58:32.823
NOT CONVICT TRUMP, THAT THIS WAS
JUST THE LATEST EPISODE OF 

05:58:33.024 --> 05:58:35.066
VIOLENCE AND THAT IT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN AGAIN UNLESS THE SENATE 

05:58:35.270 --> 05:58:37.270
HOLDS TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE. THAT 
WAS A THEME THAT WAS HAMMERED 

05:58:37.318 --> 05:58:40.812
REALLY HARD, AND IT SORT OF 
SHOWED THE, WHY THIS MATTERS, 

05:58:41.028 --> 05:58:43.028
TRUMP IS AS MUCH A PROBLEM FOR 
REPUBLICANS,

05:58:46.946 --> 05:58:49.648
IF NOT MORE SO, THEN HE IS FOR 
DEMOCRATS, IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

05:58:49.862 --> 05:58:51.506
YEARS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, THE LEADING PATIENT 

05:58:51.507 --> 05:58:53.990
MANAGER JAMIE RASKIN ENDED WITH 
A HANDFUL OF QUESTIONS THAT HE 

05:58:54.192 --> 05:58:56.192
WOULD LOVE TO POSE, PRESIDENT

05:59:00.132 --> 05:59:02.132
TRUMP'S LAWYERS DON'T HAVE TO 
TOUCH THOSE QUESTIONS AT ALL, 

05:59:02.167 --> 05:59:04.865
BUT THEY WERE, INTERESTING TO 
HEAR BECAUSE IT GETS AT THE 

05:59:05.626 --> 05:59:07.626
QUESTION OF

05:59:10.395 --> 05:59:12.858
WHY DID PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ACT,
WHY DID HE NOT DO MORE TO 

05:59:13.062 --> 05:59:15.062
INTERVENE IN THE IMMEDIATE 
AFTERMATH OF THE ATTACK ON THE 

05:59:15.117 --> 05:59:18.197
CAPITAL, TALK TO US ABOUT THAT 
SIGNIFICANCE? 

05:59:18.198 --> 05:59:21.484
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION 
THAT PREVENTATIVE RASKIN SAID 

05:59:21.683 --> 05:59:25.041
WAS ON THEIR LIST THAT THEY 
WANTED THE DEFENSE

05:59:30.863 --> 05:59:33.518
TO ANSWER FOR TRUMP, WHY DID HE 
NOT ACT IF HE WAS NOT SUPPORTING

05:59:33.720 --> 05:59:35.954
THIS RIGHT AND INSURRECTION, 
THEN WHY DID IT TAKE HIM SO LONG

05:59:36.172 --> 05:59:38.727
TO CALL IT OFF AND SEND THE 
HELP? SO THAT AGAIN,

05:59:43.125 --> 05:59:45.587
WAS PART OF THAT, TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE 

05:59:45.789 --> 05:59:47.789
THAT THE DEFENSE STARTS OUT 
EXPLAINING THEIR SIDE OF THE 

05:59:47.844 --> 05:59:50.508
STORY, AND ALSO, HE ASKED THEM 
TO ABANDON ANY SORT OF ARGUMENTS

05:59:51.265 --> 05:59:53.393
THEY MIGHT TAKE ABOUT THE 
UNCONSTITUTIONALITY, THEY SAID 

05:59:53.597 --> 05:59:55.597
THAT THEY ALREADY

06:00:01.200 --> 06:00:03.248
DEALT WITH THAT, THEY VOTED THAT
THEY HAVE THE JURISDICTION AND 

06:00:03.450 --> 06:00:05.701
THAT SHOULD NOT BE A CENTRAL 
PART OF THE ARGUMENTS WHEN THEY 

06:00:05.901 --> 06:00:07.901
START TOMORROW, SO

06:00:12.861 --> 06:00:15.320
HE DID THAT, HE ALSO CHIPPED 
AWAY AT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS

06:00:15.522 --> 06:00:17.594
THEY MAY TRY TO ARGUE, THE FREE 
SPEECH ARGUMENT IS SOMETHING 

06:00:17.797 --> 06:00:20.059
THAT WE KNOW THE DEFENSE HAS 
SAID WOULD BE CORE TO THEIR 

06:00:20.260 --> 06:00:22.260
ARGUMENTS, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SOME 

06:00:22.322 --> 06:00:24.178
SOMEONE WHO JUST SPEAKS 
PASSIONATELY, AND THAT DID NOT 

06:00:24.179 --> 06:00:26.838
MEAN THAT HE WAS A PART OF THE 
RIOT OR CONDONED IT BUT THEY 

06:00:27.043 --> 06:00:29.315
WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND SHIP AWAY
AT THAT BEFORE THE DEFENSE 

06:00:29.516 --> 06:00:31.980
STARTS TOMORROW, AND THEY ALSO 
WANTED TO CHIP AWAY AT THE IDEA 

06:00:32.187 --> 06:00:34.576
THAT THIS IS HIGHLY PARTISAN, 
THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THAT, 

06:00:34.713 --> 06:00:39.740
THAT WE HEARD, WHEN WE COVERED 
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT VOTE, A 

06:00:39.953 --> 06:00:43.878
LOT OF REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING 
THAT THIS WAS A RUSHED PROCESS, 

06:00:44.091 --> 06:00:46.228
THAT IS PARTISAN, THE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO

06:00:52.701 --> 06:00:54.949
DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP SINCE HE WAS
ELECTED, AND THIS IS JUST PART 

06:00:55.152 --> 06:00:57.597
OF IT, AND WE KNOW THAT THE 
DEFENSE IS PLANNING TO USE THAT,

06:00:57.799 --> 06:01:00.475
TOO, SO HE CHIPPED AWAY AT THAT 
THING THAT TED LIEU, ONE OF THE 

06:01:00.675 --> 06:01:02.748
PATIENT MANAGER SAID THAT WE 
WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WE

06:01:02.950 --> 06:01:05.186
WERE SUPPOSED TO, AND IN 
ADDITION, THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 

06:01:05.404 --> 06:01:07.641
6 IS UNDER CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION ALREADY, PEOPLE 

06:01:08.400 --> 06:01:13.356
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND WE FELT 
THAT WE HAD ALL WE NEEDED TO GO 

06:01:13.559 --> 06:01:17.298
TO THE PERSON AT THE TOP WHO IS 
DONALD TRUMP, SO THE LAST PERSON

06:01:17.499 --> 06:01:19.499
WE SAW RIGHT HERE WAS TRYING TO

06:01:24.706 --> 06:01:26.535
ATTACK WHAT THE DEFENSE IS 
EXPECTED TO SAY TOMORROW. 

06:01:26.536 --> 06:01:28.359
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GREAT POINTS, RHONDA, THOSE 
QUESTIONS THAT LEADING PATIENT 

06:01:28.360 --> 06:01:30.908
MANAGER RASKIN WAS POSING ARE 
ALSO

06:01:41.313 --> 06:01:43.364
QUESTIONS THAT HE WANTS TO 
RESONATE IN THE MINDS OF THESE 

06:01:43.578 --> 06:01:45.650
JURORS, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING 
TO ARGUE A LOT ABOUT TRUMP'S 

06:01:45.851 --> 06:01:47.930
INTENTION, LEADING UP TO THE 
ATTACK OF JANUARY 6, BUT THERE 

06:01:48.130 --> 06:01:50.262
IS THIS UNDENIABLE VACUUM OF 
LEADERSHIP IN THE IMMEDIATE

06:01:59.633 --> 06:02:01.633
AFTERMATH, AND FRANKLY THE HOURS
AFTER THE ATTACK. WE HEARD 

06:02:01.676 --> 06:02:03.533
PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN COME 
OUT AND CONDEMN WHAT WAS 

06:02:03.534 --> 06:02:06.390
HAPPENING AND HE DID IT RUSH TO 
DO IT, HE GAVE TRUMP TIME BUT HE

06:02:06.592 --> 06:02:08.592
DID IT MORE QUICKLY THAN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID, AND THEY 

06:02:08.655 --> 06:02:10.655
PLAY THESE VERY COMPELLING OF 
THE MOMENT CLIPS FROM TELEVISION

06:02:10.722 --> 06:02:12.351
OF REPUBLICANS, CALLING INTO 
TELEVISION OR FILMING VIDEOS 

06:02:12.352 --> 06:02:14.352
THEMSELVES, BAKING TRUMP TO DO 
SOMETHING.

06:02:20.969 --> 06:02:22.969
OR AT LEAST SAY SOMETHING 
DIRECTLY TO HIS SUPPORTERS WHO 

06:02:23.014 --> 06:02:24.441
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS 
ATTACK. 

06:02:24.442 --> 06:02:26.787
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND ONE OF THOSE CLIPS CAME 
FROM MIKE GALLAGHER,

06:02:38.984 --> 06:02:40.984
FROM WISCONSIN, WE HEARD THE 
SAME CLIP YESTERDAY WHERE HE 

06:02:41.036 --> 06:02:43.328
RECORDED THE VIDEO AT HIS OFFICE
AND SAID ONLY YOU MR. PRESIDENT 

06:02:43.529 --> 06:02:45.564
CAN STOP THIS. THESE PEOPLE CAME
HERE BECAUSE OF YOU. NOTABLY, 

06:02:45.765 --> 06:02:47.596
GALLAGHER VOTED AGAINST 
IMPEACHMENT IN THE HOUSE, HE WAS

06:02:47.597 --> 06:02:50.076
NOT ONE OF THE 10 REPUBLICANS, 
THAT'S A REFLECTION OF A LOT OF 

06:02:50.277 --> 06:02:52.111
THESE SENATE REPUBLICANS THEY 
BLAME TRUMP FOR WHAT HAPPENED 

06:02:52.112 --> 06:02:54.399
BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT PLANNING 
TO CONVICT. SO THREE OF THE FOUR

06:02:54.601 --> 06:02:56.442
QUESTIONS THAT CONGRESSMAN 
RASKIN POST WERE RELATED TO WHAT

06:02:56.443 --> 06:02:58.887
YOU SAID. THE FOURTH WAS THE 
MOST STRIKING TO ME BECAUSE IF A

06:02:59.088 --> 06:03:00.746
PRESIDENT INCITES AND 
INSURRECTION, DO WE ALL AGREE 

06:03:00.747 --> 06:03:07.052
THAT WOULD COUNT AS A HIGH CREAM
AND MISDEMEANOR? HE ACTUALLY 

06:03:07.201 --> 06:03:11.797
SAID TRUMP DOES SATISFY THE 
LEGAL STANDARD FOR INSURRECTION 

06:03:12.013 --> 06:03:14.013
IN A COURT OF LAW, HE SAID THAT

06:03:17.755 --> 06:03:19.755
MORE THAN 150 FREE SPEECH 
ADVOCATES WOULD AGREE AND SIGN 

06:03:19.802 --> 06:03:25.333
ONTO THIS LETTER SAYING UNDER 
THE 1969 SUPREME COURT STANDARD,

06:03:25.548 --> 06:03:28.243
IF TRUMP WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, 
HE COULD BE CHARGED WITH 

06:03:28.441 --> 06:03:32.501
INCITING A RIOT, BUT, RASKIN 
ARGUED THAT THERE ARE 

06:03:32.702 --> 06:03:34.702
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE GREATER 
THAN THAT, HE SAID THEY WOULD 

06:03:35.348 --> 06:03:39.305
MEET THAT WORD AND IF THEY 
NEEDED TO, BUT HE SAID, HE NOTED

06:03:39.520 --> 06:03:43.842
THAT HIS OWN DAUGHTER IS A 
TEACHER, THE DAUGHTER WHO NO 

06:03:44.044 --> 06:03:46.331
LONGER FEEL SAFE COMING TO THE 
CAPITAL AFTER SHE WAS THERE ON 

06:03:46.532 --> 06:03:50.823
JANUARY 6 AND HE SAID A TEACHER 
CAN GET FIRED FOR SAYING THINGS 

06:03:51.038 --> 06:03:55.772
THAT ARE AT ODDS WITH THE 
MISSION OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

06:03:55.975 --> 06:03:58.244
BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE ON A 
PUBLIC OFFICE, EVEN THE ROLE OF 

06:03:58.459 --> 06:04:00.718
TEACHER, YOU ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR
THINGS THAT YOU SAY IN YOUR 

06:04:00.936 --> 06:04:02.790
OFFICIAL CAPACITY. SIMILARLY 
WITH THE PRESIDENT, HE SAID, IF 

06:04:02.791 --> 06:04:04.791
A PRIVATE CITIZEN SAID

06:04:11.347 --> 06:04:12.991
THAT WE SHOULD BECOME A 
TOTALITARIAN STATE, THERE'S 

06:04:12.992 --> 06:04:15.055
NOTHING ANYONE COULD DO TO THAT 
PERSON, THAT'S FREE SPEECH, BUT 

06:04:15.817 --> 06:04:20.976
THAT SAME FREE SPEECH PROTECTION
DOESN'T APPLY TO A PRESIDENT, SO

06:04:21.177 --> 06:04:23.476
HE GAVE THREE OTHER EXAMPLES OF 
WHERE THE STANDARD, THE BAR, THE

06:04:23.692 --> 06:04:27.173
THRESHOLD IS HIGHER FOR SOMEONE 
WHO HOLDS A PUBLIC OFFICE LET 

06:04:27.376 --> 06:04:29.424
ALONE A PRESIDENT, AND AGAIN, HE
SPENT DECADES TEACHING 

06:04:30.185 --> 06:04:35.980
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HE TALKED 
ABOUT THOMAS PAINE A BUNCH OF 

06:04:36.181 --> 06:04:38.228
COMMON SENSE BUT HE TALKED ABOUT
EVERYTHING IN ARTICLE ONE WHICH 

06:04:38.442 --> 06:04:40.442
IS WHAT CREATED

06:04:45.668 --> 06:04:47.668
CONGRESS AND THEN ARTICLE 2, 
WHICH IS ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY, 

06:04:47.714 --> 06:04:49.963
RASKIN NOTED THERE ARE ONLY FOUR
PARAGRAPHS IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE 

06:04:50.176 --> 06:04:52.176
FOURTH PARAGRAPH IS ALL ABOUT 
IMPEACHMENT, SO, THIS IS THAT 

06:04:52.244 --> 06:04:54.087
FOURTH QUESTION, IT'S ABOUT 
UNDERCUTTING WHAT'S GOING TO BE 

06:04:54.088 --> 06:04:56.356
A CENTRAL PART OF THE PRESIDENTS
DEFENSE ARGUMENT AND WE KNOW 

06:04:56.570 --> 06:04:58.989
FROM READING THEIR BRIEFS THAT 
THEY'VE ALREADY FILED WHICH IS 

06:04:59.126 --> 06:05:02.595
THAT TRUMP WAS ENGAGING IN FREE 
SPEECH

06:05:11.471 --> 06:05:13.471
AND UNDER THE LEGAL DEFINITION, 
UNDER THE SUPREME COURT CASE, 

06:05:13.538 --> 06:05:15.538
WHAT TRUMP DID WHAT CONSTITUTE 
INCITEMENT, SO I THOUGHT THE 

06:05:15.575 --> 06:05:17.628
FOURTH QUESTION REALLY LAID OUT 
DOUBT ABOUT FOR ANYONE WHO IS 

06:05:17.831 --> 06:05:20.095
INTELLECTUALLY WATCHING THIS 
TRIAL IN THE SENATE CHAMBER AND 

06:05:20.853 --> 06:05:27.452
ENGAGING IT IN A SERIOUS WAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND RASKIN POINTED OUT IT'S 

06:05:27.646 --> 06:05:30.342
THE CONGRESS THAT HAS THE POWER 
TO IMPEACH AND CONVICT THE 

06:05:30.544 --> 06:05:35.048
PRESIDENT, IT'S NOT THE POWER 
PRESIDENT WHO HAS POWER OVER 

06:05:35.457 --> 06:05:37.993
CONGRESS BUT IT'S ALSO A 
METAPHOR, RIGHT? THE MAC AND 

06:05:38.175 --> 06:05:40.175
THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH MOVED

06:05:48.194 --> 06:05:50.194
TOWARD THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY, 
THAT'S A NARRATIVE OF THE LAST 

06:05:50.249 --> 06:05:52.249
CENTURY, THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BECOME MORE AND MORE POWERFUL, 

06:05:52.294 --> 06:05:55.159
AND IF THE PRESIDENT CAN GET 
AWAY WITH DOING SOMETHING I CAN 

06:05:55.362 --> 06:05:57.631
ALLEGEDLY DID ON JANUARY 6, THEN
IT MEANS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

06:05:57.833 --> 06:06:01.730
ALL THE MORE POWER, THAT THE 
BALANCE BALANCE OF POWER, THE 

06:06:01.933 --> 06:06:04.221
CHECKS AND BALANCES, THIS IS ONE
OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL CHECKS AND

06:06:04.422 --> 06:06:08.320
BALANCES, THAT WHEN YOU FUNCTION
ON THAT BY NOT CONVICTING TRUMP,

06:06:08.520 --> 06:06:10.654
THEN NUMBER 1, IT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE

06:06:15.305 --> 06:06:17.551
YOU WILL REMOVE DISINCENTIVES TO
STOP IT BUT NUMBER 2, IT WILL 

06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:19.750
WARP OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT. THAT IS WHAT WAS 

06:06:19.819 --> 06:06:21.819
GETTING AT, BY ESSENTIALLY 
APPEALING

06:06:25.738 --> 06:06:27.974
TO THE SENATORS OWN SENSE OF 
IMPORTANCE, WHICH IS A VOTE TO 

06:06:28.738 --> 06:06:31.681
ACQUIT TRUMP IS A VOTE AGAINST 
THE POWER OF THE LEGISLATIVE 

06:06:32.442 --> 06:06:34.442
BRANCH ITSELF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A LOT OF TODAY'S ARGUMENT WAS

06:06:34.544 --> 06:06:36.544
SHOWING UP PATTERN OF DONALD 
TRUMP'S WHICH

06:06:42.538 --> 06:06:43.973
ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE AND 
EMBOLDENING THE MOB, WHICH 

06:06:43.974 --> 06:06:45.407
INCLUDED MANY WHITE 
NATIONALISTS. LET'S BRING IN 

06:06:45.408 --> 06:06:50.325
NATIONAL REPORTER THE CORAL 
NICOLE ELLIS HAS BEEN REPORTING 

06:06:50.527 --> 06:06:52.586
ON WHAT THOSE MOMENTS WERE LIKE 
FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OF 

06:06:53.349 --> 06:06:55.349
COLOR, NICOLE?

06:07:01.595 --> 06:07:05.489
I THINK WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH
YOUR AUDIO, NICOLE 

06:07:05.490 --> 06:07:07.637
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: I'M SORRY, CAN YOU 
HEAR ME? 

06:07:07.638 --> 06:07:09.638
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:07:14.059 --> 06:07:16.059
ONE AGAIN, YOU'VE BEEN DOING 
THESE INTERVIEWS WITH MEMBERS OF

06:07:16.124 --> 06:07:18.124
CONGRESS, TO SORT OF CAPTURE AND
DOCUMENT THEIR EXPERIENCES, TELL

06:07:18.166 --> 06:07:19.594
US MORE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IN TODAY'S HEARING 

06:07:19.595 --> 06:07:21.595
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN IMPEACHMENT

06:07:24.321 --> 06:07:26.587
MANAGER TO GET MENTIONED THAT 
ONE OF THE FIRST THING SHE DID 

06:07:26.790 --> 06:07:28.790
WHEN SHE REALIZED WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING WAS TAKEOFF HER MEMBER

06:07:28.812 --> 06:07:31.350
PAIN, THAT WAS AN EXTREMELY 
NOTABLE STICKING POINT. FOR THE

06:07:36.584 --> 06:07:38.584
VEIL MENTIONED THAT TAKING OFF 
THEIR PARENTS WOULD DO LITTLE 

06:07:38.661 --> 06:07:41.319
FOR THEIR SAFETY. HERE'S A BRIEF
CLIPS OF WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. 

06:07:41.519 --> 06:07:46.980
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY WHITE COLLEAGUES CAN TAKE 
OFF THEIR COATS AND REMOVE THEIR

06:07:47.122 --> 06:07:52.040
PENS AND TRY TO BLEND IN THE 
CROWD. I CAN'T DO THAT

06:07:55.635 --> 06:07:57.461
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAD ONE FRIEND TEXT ME AND 

06:07:57.462 --> 06:08:00.340
SHE SAID JUST GO OUT, JUST FIGHT
FIND IT TRUMP SCARF AND PUT IT 

06:08:00.541 --> 06:08:06.677
ON. I SAID, I DID NOT FEEL THAT 
I COULD COMFORTABLY WALK OUT AS 

06:08:06.881 --> 06:08:12.408
A WOMAN OF COLOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IF, WHAT IF I HAD BEEN 

06:08:12.815 --> 06:08:15.571
VISIBLE ENOUGH FOR THESE FOLKS 
TO SEE, THEN YEAH

06:08:19.198 --> 06:08:21.526
ALL OF OUR LIVES WERE THREATENED
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

06:08:25.334 --> 06:08:27.611
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS YOU MENTIONED, WE ARE NOT 
GOING TO HEAR FROM WITNESSES, 

06:08:27.813 --> 06:08:29.813
AND WE MAY NOT

06:08:44.190 --> 06:08:46.190
HEAR SOME OF THESE FIRST-HAND 
ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE OF VIDEOS BUT 

06:08:46.265 --> 06:08:48.265
IT'S CLEAR THAT AMONG STAFFERS 
AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OF 

06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:51.025
COLOR, THAT RACE WAS A BIG ISSUE
AND A BIG FACTOR IN HOW THEY 

06:08:51.225 --> 06:08:53.225
THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR LIKELIHOOD 
OF SURVIVAL, IF THEY WERE FOUND 

06:08:53.288 --> 06:08:55.522
ON JANUARY 6. SO, IT'LL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THIS IS 

06:08:55.724 --> 06:08:57.787
ADDRESSED IN THE COMING DAYS AS 
WELL BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT 

06:08:57.989 --> 06:09:00.238
RACE WAS A FACTOR HERE AND THAT 
RACISM WAS A HUGE CONSIDERATION 

06:09:00.439 --> 06:09:02.718
FOR PEOPLE THAT FELT THEIR LIVES
WERE AT RISK WHILE IN THE 

06:09:02.921 --> 06:09:04.567
CAPITAL, BOTH MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, STAFFERS, AND LIKELY 

06:09:04.568 --> 06:09:07.827
JOURNALISTS AND SO MANY OTHERS 
THAT WERE THERE. 

06:09:07.828 --> 06:09:10.064
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NICOLE ELLIS, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. RHONDA, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN

06:09:10.279 --> 06:09:13.571
CHECKING IN WITH MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, AND THEIR EXPERIENCES,

06:09:13.772 --> 06:09:18.161
BOTH ON THAT DAY BUT ALSO, JUST 
IN THE AFTERMATH,

06:09:24.187 --> 06:09:26.187
I'M WONDERING WHERE THINGS GO 
FROM HERE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 

06:09:26.234 --> 06:09:29.318
EXCLUSIVE TO THIS TRIAL PROCESS.
HOW ARE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

06:09:29.700 --> 06:09:31.700
DEALING WITH YOU KNOW, JUST

06:09:36.266 --> 06:09:38.266
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH, IN 
EVERY SENSE, THINKING ABOUT HOW 

06:09:38.747 --> 06:09:43.265
THEY COMBAT DISINFORMATION, TO 
MAKING SURE THAT THE STAFFS ARE 

06:09:43.682 --> 06:09:48.858
COPING WITH THIS FUNDAMENTALLY 
HEALTHY WAY, WHAT IS ON THEIR 

06:09:49.279 --> 06:09:53.162
PLATES? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE DEALING WITH A 

06:09:53.568 --> 06:09:55.213
TRAUMA SIMULTANEOUSLY, WORKING 
ON EITHER THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

06:09:55.214 --> 06:09:57.214
ON THE SENATE SIDE

06:10:01.151 --> 06:10:03.226
OR OVER ON THE HOUSE SIDE, 
WORKING ON THE NEXT BIG 

06:10:03.441 --> 06:10:05.506
CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE, BUT WHILE 
THEY ARE DOING ALL OF THESE VERY

06:10:05.710 --> 06:10:07.710
WEIGHTY, LEGISLATIVE ISSUES, 
THEY ARE ALSO VERY OPEN ABOUT 

06:10:08.097 --> 06:10:11.008
THE FACT THAT THIS IS STILL AN 
OPEN TRAUMA, THIS IS STILL 

06:10:11.224 --> 06:10:13.224
SOMETHING THEY ARE DEALING WITH

06:10:16.014 --> 06:10:18.077
DAILY. I'VE TALKED TO STAFFERS 
WHO SAID, EVERY DAY WHEN YOU 

06:10:18.278 --> 06:10:21.040
COME IN HERE, IT'S A REMINDER OF
WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6

06:10:25.037 --> 06:10:27.291
. I'VE TALKED TO STAFFERS WHO 
WORK HERE BECAUSE MANY OF THEM 

06:10:27.503 --> 06:10:29.969
ARE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME AND 
THEY SAID JUST EVEN WATCHING THE

06:10:30.174 --> 06:10:32.231
SCENES AND SEEING THESE RIDERS 
GO PAST VERY FAMILIAR PLACES 

06:10:32.370 --> 06:10:34.901
FELT LIKE AN INVASION AND THEY 
ARE HAVING -- 

06:10:34.902 --> 06:10:37.358
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S PAUSE A MOMENT AND 
LISTEN TO SENATOR WARREN. 

06:10:37.359 --> 06:10:40.887
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: ALSO TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY PUT US ON 

06:10:41.293 --> 06:10:46.856
RECORD FOR ALL OF HISTORY, ABOUT
WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID TO SUBVERT

06:10:47.058 --> 06:10:52.578
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. THE MAC AND 

06:10:52.795 --> 06:10:55.034
COULD YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT 
OF THE MOOD YESTERDAY DURING THE

06:10:55.238 --> 06:10:57.196
PRESENTATION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: I THINK PEOPLE ARE 

06:10:57.197 --> 06:11:02.164
NOT HAPPY HAVING TO SEE THE 
VIDEOS ALTOGETHER, TO SEE 

06:11:02.346 --> 06:11:05.164
EXACTLY HOW CLOSE WE CAME

06:11:10.189 --> 06:11:12.506
TO EVEN MORE DEATH AND 
DESTRUCTION. I ACTUALLY HEARD 

06:11:13.216 --> 06:11:18.550
OTHER SENATORS MATTER, IT'S A 
MIRACLE THAT MORE PEOPLE WEREN'T

06:11:18.697 --> 06:11:20.697
KILLED

06:11:24.133 --> 06:11:25.783
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK YOU NOTED THAT YOU 

06:11:25.784 --> 06:11:27.865
ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF YOUR 
COLLEAGUES, YOU LOOKED AT THEM 

06:11:28.637 --> 06:11:30.637
DURING THE

06:11:32.964 --> 06:11:34.849
PRESENTATION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I LOOK ACROSS THE ISLE AT THE

06:11:34.850 --> 06:11:36.850
REPUBLICANS, AS WE SEE VIDEO 
AFTER VIDEO AFTER VIDEO, DONALD 

06:11:36.900 --> 06:11:40.314
TRUMP, LAYING IN THE FOUNDATION,
MONTHS AGO FOR BEING ABLE TO 

06:11:40.454 --> 06:11:42.454
TURN

06:11:47.779 --> 06:11:50.009
AN ELECTION THAT DIDN'T GO HIS 
WAY AND THEN WHIPPING A CROWD 

06:11:50.212 --> 06:11:52.735
INTO A FRENZY TO COME LAUNCH AN 
ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL, AND I 

06:11:52.927 --> 06:11:55.237
LOOKED ACROSS AT THE REPUBLICANS
AND THEY JUST ACT LIKE THEY ARE 

06:11:55.451 --> 06:11:59.740
NOT HEARING ANYTHING AT ALL. AND
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. 

06:11:59.741 --> 06:12:01.741
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALSO, DO YOU THINK ANY 
REPUBLICANS WILL CHANGE THEIR 

06:12:01.834 --> 06:12:04.692
MIND AND IF NOT, SHOULD THERE BE
A CONSIDERATION OF CENSURING 

06:12:05.095 --> 06:12:07.032
TRUMP? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY 

06:12:07.033 --> 06:12:11.892
CANNOT TREAT THAT AS AN 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. IF WE HAVE 

06:12:12.106 --> 06:12:14.758
SEEN OF THE LAST TWO DAYS IS NOT
AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE, THEN IN 

06:12:14.960 --> 06:12:19.299
EFFECT THE REPUBLICANS ARE 
SAYING THERE IS NOTHING AND I 

06:12:19.503 --> 06:12:21.503
THINK THAT'S WRONG. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO

06:12:27.956 --> 06:12:29.791
IF HE'S ACQUITTED -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT'S WRONG. 

06:12:29.792 --> 06:12:31.434
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR ELIZABETH FORAN 
TALKING TO REPORTERS THERE. 

06:12:31.435 --> 06:12:35.708
LET'S GO BACK TO YOU. WE HEARD 
SENATOR WARREN AT THE BEGINNING 

06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:38.149
OF THAT, TALK ABOUT, THIS IS 
GETTING US ON THE RECORD, THIS 

06:12:38.351 --> 06:12:40.408
IS DOCUMENTING WHAT HAS HAPPENED
OVER, NOT JUST JANUARY 6 BUT 

06:12:41.166 --> 06:12:43.166
OVER THE

06:12:47.148 --> 06:12:49.195
COURSE OF YEARS IN TERMS OF THE 
MISINFORMATION COMING FROM THE 

06:12:49.397 --> 06:12:51.435
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
COMING UP TO IMPEACH A MANAGER 

06:12:51.640 --> 06:12:53.685
SAYING, THE ATTACK ON THE 
CAPITAL, SO FULL THAT INTO WHAT 

06:12:53.877 --> 06:12:56.131
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, ABOUT HOW
THESE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND 

06:12:56.333 --> 06:12:58.333
SENATE ARE PROCESSING THIS 
MOMENT

06:13:04.905 --> 06:13:06.333
? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE STILL PROCESSING IT AND

06:13:06.334 --> 06:13:08.412
I THINK IT'S VERY TELLING THAT 
ELIZABETH WARREN HAS BEEN THE 

06:13:08.617 --> 06:13:11.050
FIRST PERSON THAT WE'VE SEEN 
TALK AFTER TAPE TODAY'S EVENTS 

06:13:11.193 --> 06:13:15.827
CONCLUDED, USUALLY, IF ONE SIDE 
OR THE OTHER HERE ON THE HILL 

06:13:16.036 --> 06:13:18.125
FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE SOMETHING 
TO ATTACK, THEY WILL FIND A 

06:13:18.330 --> 06:13:20.617
REPORTER, FIND A MIC STAND AND 
GO AND SAY SOMETHING. WE HAVE 

06:13:20.832 --> 06:13:22.832
NOT SEEN SENATE REPUBLICANS 
COMMENT

06:13:25.776 --> 06:13:27.845
AND COME AND TALK TO ANY OF 
THESE JOURNALISTS WERE WAITING 

06:13:28.049 --> 06:13:30.049
OUTSIDE, TO GIVE COMMENTS AND 
THAT COULD BE TELLING, THAT 

06:13:30.125 --> 06:13:32.203
COULD SHOW THAT THESE IMAGES 
THAT THEY'VE HAD TO SIT THROUGH 

06:13:32.405 --> 06:13:34.872
AND WATCH FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS 
DID HIT HOME. AGAIN, I'M NOT 

06:13:35.634 --> 06:13:38.189
SAYING THAT MEANS THAT TWO 
THIRDS OF THE SENATE WILL VOTE 

06:13:38.599 --> 06:13:43.090
TO CONVICT DONALD TRUMP BUT 
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT THEY ARE

06:13:43.291 --> 06:13:45.722
LIKELY GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN 
TRAUMAS JUST BY HAVING TO BE 

06:13:45.925 --> 06:13:49.500
JURORS IN THIS TRIAL. I THINK 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

06:14:02.083 --> 06:14:04.083
SENATOR WARREN JUST MENTIONED 
ABOUT LOOKING OVER AT THE ISLE 

06:14:04.143 --> 06:14:05.986
TO HER SENATE REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES, AND THERE SEEMS TO 

06:14:05.987 --> 06:14:08.049
BE A BIT OF DISMAY AMONG 
DEMOCRATS SAYING, IF THIS ISN'T 

06:14:08.250 --> 06:14:10.700
IMPEACHABLE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
IS, AND I KNOW A FEW OF THE 

06:14:10.903 --> 06:14:12.744
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER SAID THAT 
SENTENCE, TOO, THAT THIS FITS 

06:14:12.745 --> 06:14:14.795
THE VERY DEFINITION OF WHAT THE 
FRAMERS WERE SAYING, YOU CANNOT 

06:14:14.998 --> 06:14:17.047
HAVE SOMEONE IN OFFICE WHO WILL 
DO ANYTHING TO MAINTAIN THAT 

06:14:17.807 --> 06:14:22.936
OFFICE, SO, I JUST WANTED TO 
POINT THAT OUT, FOR PEOPLE AT 

06:14:23.138 --> 06:14:25.436
HOME THAT WHEN YOU COVER THE 
HILL AND ARE WAITING IN THE 

06:14:26.196 --> 06:14:28.921
HALLWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO STOP AND 
TALK TO YOU, USUALLY IF IT'S A 

06:14:29.139 --> 06:14:32.028
GOOD DAY FOR YOUR TEAM, YOU WILL
FIND A REPORTER TO TELL THAT TO.

06:14:32.233 --> 06:14:34.685
IF YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE OTHER 
SIDE, YOU WILL FIND A MICROPHONE

06:14:34.886 --> 06:14:36.886
TO TALK TO

06:14:41.402 --> 06:14:43.873
YOU BUT WHEN YOU SEE EVERYBODY 
LEAVE AND GET OUT OF THERE, YOU 

06:14:44.076 --> 06:14:46.076
CAN TELL THAT WHAT THEY 
WITNESSED AND GONE THROUGH IS 

06:14:46.116 --> 06:14:48.177
PROBABLY PRETTY HEAVY FOR THEM. 
AND I JUST KNOW FROM THE 

06:14:48.393 --> 06:14:53.294
CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD A DAY 
AFTER THE INSURRECTION AND 

06:14:53.496 --> 06:14:55.496
STAFFERS, THIS IS SOMETHING THEY
ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH, AND 

06:14:55.547 --> 06:14:57.656
IT WILL BE PROBABLY FOR A LONG 
TIME ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE 

06:14:57.872 --> 06:14:59.872
ARE SO MANY PHYSICAL REMINDERS 
OF FROM

06:15:10.359 --> 06:15:12.613
JANUARY 6, THE NATIONAL GUARD IS
STILL VERY MUCH HERE, THEY ARE 

06:15:12.813 --> 06:15:14.863
AT MOST OF THE ENTRANCES AND THE
GATES COMING AROUND THE 

06:15:15.066 --> 06:15:17.066
PERIMETER OF THE ENTIRE COMPLEX,
WITH GUNS, THEY ARE STANDING, 

06:15:17.103 --> 06:15:19.365
WATCHING EVERYONE, AND AND GO, 
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW A BADGE TO 

06:15:19.567 --> 06:15:21.605
GET ANYWHERE NEAR A SENATE OR 
HOUSE BUILDING RIGHT NOW SO 

06:15:21.807 --> 06:15:23.869
THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE NOT 
YET BECOME ROUTINE TO ANYBODY 

06:15:24.071 --> 06:15:27.977
WHO COMES TO THE HILL. THEY ARE 
REMINDERS OF WHAT HAPPENED. 

06:15:27.978 --> 06:15:29.978
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO NOW TO SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT PAUL

06:15:30.374 --> 06:15:34.235
KANE. PAUL, RHONDA WAS 
REFLECTING ON HOW THESE

06:15:39.857 --> 06:15:41.918
SENATORS WERE DIGESTING ALL THIS
TODAY. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT 

06:15:42.119 --> 06:15:44.579
WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE 
CHAMBER, AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE 

06:15:44.782 --> 06:15:46.882
TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T 
HAVE CONTROL OVER THE CAMERAS, 

06:15:47.084 --> 06:15:50.361
NEITHER THE C-SPAN, ONLY 
CONGRESS CONTROLS THOSE CAMERAS,

06:15:50.577 --> 06:15:54.100
AND SOMETIMES THE 
MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHO CAN 

06:15:54.299 --> 06:15:56.385
ACTUALLY MAKE THAT LENS GO 
AROUND THE ROOM, IT IS JUST 

06:15:57.144 --> 06:15:59.144
CONGRESS, SO

06:16:07.276 --> 06:16:09.723
WE CAN'T SEE WHAT MOST OF THOSE 
JURORS ARE DOING. TELL US WHAT 

06:16:09.924 --> 06:16:11.970
WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON 
INSIDE THE CHAMBER? 

06:16:11.971 --> 06:16:14.030
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: WE HAVE SORT OF A 
ROTATING POOL SYSTEM OF 

06:16:14.233 --> 06:16:16.482
REPORTERS THAT ARE IN CHAMBER 
AND GIVE US FEEDS ABOUT WHAT WAS

06:16:16.686 --> 06:16:23.228
GOING ON, AND TODAY WAS A DAY 
THAT FELT A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE

06:16:23.431 --> 06:16:27.508
THE UKRAINE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, 
OF A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR 

06:16:28.268 --> 06:16:31.541
AGO, WHERE, SENATORS WERE 
GETTING SORT OF TIRED MORE 

06:16:31.680 --> 06:16:38.753
QUICKLY AND WERE NOWHERE NEAR AS
SORT OF RIVETED AND ENTHRALLED 

06:16:38.956 --> 06:16:40.956
FOR BETTER OR WORSE REASONS

06:16:43.884 --> 06:16:45.743
THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY, 
YESTERDAY'S TESTIMONY WAS, I WAS

06:16:45.744 --> 06:16:51.686
IN THE ROOM FOR THE MOST 
POWERFUL PARTS OF IT, IT WAS 

06:16:51.889 --> 06:16:54.140
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS ON THE 
EDGE OF THEIR SEAT WATCHING AS 

06:16:54.355 --> 06:16:56.408
THE VIDEOS WERE UNFOLDING. THE 
ATTACK WAS SORT OF PLAYED OUT 

06:16:57.172 --> 06:17:03.610
FOR THEM. THIS TIME AROUND, IT 
WAS CLEAR THAT TODAY'S TESTIMONY

06:17:04.742 --> 06:17:06.742
WAS MORE

06:17:12.203 --> 06:17:14.203
, FELT TO REPUBLICANS, THEY 
WOULD COME OUT UNTIL REPORTERS 

06:17:14.237 --> 06:17:16.512
THAT THEY FELT IT WAS GETTING A 
LITTLE REPETITIVE, AND THAT THEY

06:17:16.727 --> 06:17:18.981
WERE REALLY LEARNING ANYTHING 
NEW. AND THERE WOULD BE POINTS 

06:17:19.184 --> 06:17:23.849
WHERE ANYWHERE FROM 10 TO 15 
SENATORS MOSTLY REPUBLICAN, 

06:17:23.991 --> 06:17:29.240
WOULD NOT BE IN THEIR CHAIRS, 
THEY ARE PROBABLY IN WHAT THEY 

06:17:29.454 --> 06:17:34.188
CALL THE CLOAKROOM WHICH IS JUST
THE ROOM ATTACHED TO THE SENATE 

06:17:34.397 --> 06:17:37.542
FLOOR THERE, WHERE THEY CAN SORT
OF GO STRETCH OUT AND RELAX

06:17:44.031 --> 06:17:46.522
IN A MORE COMFORTABLE SETTING, 
THE TVS ARE ON IN THERE, ON THE 

06:17:46.726 --> 06:17:49.857
TRIAL, SO THEY WOULD BE FOCUSING
ON THE BUT CLEARLY, THERE'S NOT 

06:17:50.059 --> 06:17:55.015
AS MUCH OF THE FOCUS OF YOU ARE 
LOUNGING ON A SOFA AS OPPOSED TO

06:17:55.215 --> 06:18:03.218
A CHAIR. SO, TODAY BROUGHT LESS 
OF THE INTENSITY THEN YESTERDAY 

06:18:03.974 --> 06:18:05.974
AFTERNOON, ESPECIALLY,

06:18:11.185 --> 06:18:15.080
AND, OVERALL, YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
ONLY ABOUT 10 HOURS OR SO OF THE

06:18:15.283 --> 06:18:20.401
TESTIMONY BEING USED BY THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. THEY WERE 

06:18:20.603 --> 06:18:22.603
TOLD THEY COULD HAVE UP TO 16 
HOURS

06:18:27.971 --> 06:18:30.237
AND YOU KNOW, TO PUT THIS ALL 
INTO PERSPECTIVE, THIS GROUP OF 

06:18:30.437 --> 06:18:32.797
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, NINE OF 
THEM, SPOKE FOR ABOUT 10 HOURS

06:18:35.820 --> 06:18:37.868
. LAST YEAR, IN THE IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL, BY HIMSELF, IN THE 

06:18:38.618 --> 06:18:42.144
OPENING PRESENTATION BY THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS, BY HIMSELF, ADAM

06:18:42.348 --> 06:18:46.754
SHIFF SPOKE FOR NINE HOURS. THEY
WENT LIKE 20 TO 22 HOURS

06:18:51.133 --> 06:18:54.168
, A YEAR AGO, AND THE REALITY 
IS, THAT GROUP OF DEMOCRATS LAST

06:18:54.315 --> 06:18:58.508
YEAR, LOST TO REPUBLICANS 
BECAUSE THEY WENT SO LONG AND 

06:18:58.711 --> 06:19:01.587
DID SO MUCH STUFF THAT 
REPUBLICANS, AND TO BE QUITE 

06:19:01.798 --> 06:19:06.300
HONEST, DEMOCRATS AS WELL 
DEMOCRATS WERE IMPRESSED WITH 

06:19:07.064 --> 06:19:12.474
THE GROUP LAST YEAR BUT THEY 
DIDN'T FEEL, THERE WERE POINTS 

06:19:12.682 --> 06:19:15.322
WHERE THEY COULD GET UP AND WALK
AROUND AND PASTE. A MUCH 

06:19:15.524 --> 06:19:18.943
DIFFERENT PRESENTATION OVERALL 
THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR,

06:19:19.086 --> 06:19:23.801
AND YESTERDAY COMPARED TO TODAY.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR

06:19:26.840 --> 06:19:29.085
KNOW, SORT OF AND RESPONSES THAT
WE MADE HERE OVERNIGHT, AND THEN

06:19:29.301 --> 06:19:34.597
INTO TOMORROW AS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S TEAM TAKES CENTER STAGE?

06:19:34.801 --> 06:19:36.854
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THE MOST CRITICAL 
QUESTION IN THE TRIAL WAS, 

06:19:37.084 --> 06:19:43.896
TOWARDS THE VERY END OF 
CONGRESSMAN RASKIN'S CLOSING 

06:19:44.653 --> 06:19:48.668
REMARKS, HE LOOKED TO HIS 
COMPETING

06:19:51.434 --> 06:19:55.079
THE TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM WAS AND 
RATTLED OFF A SERIES OF 

06:19:55.231 --> 06:20:00.483
QUESTIONS TO THEM, NOW THEY WILL
PROBABLY JUST IGNORE THIS, THEY 

06:20:00.686 --> 06:20:05.613
WILL IGNORE THE BAIT, SO TO 
SPEAK BUT HE SAID, I HOPE WHEN 

06:20:05.818 --> 06:20:10.480
YOU DELIVER YOUR REMARKS, YOU 
WILL ADDRESS SEVERAL THINGS. WHY

06:20:10.621 --> 06:20:13.298
DID DONALD TRUMP ON JANUARY 6,

06:20:17.515 --> 06:20:19.515
NEVER, EVER CRITICIZE THE GROUP 
OF PEOPLE THAT ATTACKED THE 

06:20:19.551 --> 06:20:24.729
CAPITAL? SHE SAID, THE FIRST 
THING THAT TRUMP DID

06:20:28.540 --> 06:20:31.501
TO TRY TO GET THE RIGHT UNDER 
CONTROL WAS A TWEET AFTER 4:00

06:20:36.969 --> 06:20:39.222
AND FRANKLY, IT WAS A TWEETED 
VIDEO IN WHICH HE PRAISED THE 

06:20:39.424 --> 06:20:42.286
RIOTERS AND RASKIN SAID, IF YOU 
ACCEPT THAT THIS WAS ACTUALLY, 

06:20:42.489 --> 06:20:47.428
TRYING TO TELL THEM TO CALM DOWN
AND LEAVE THE CAPITAL, WHICH YOU

06:20:48.185 --> 06:20:51.102
ACCEPT THAT IT CAME MORE THAN 
TWO HOURS AFTER THEY HAVE 

06:20:51.247 --> 06:20:55.045
BREACHED THE CAPITAL GROUNDS, 
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR HIM 

06:20:55.248 --> 06:20:57.248
TO ISSUE THIS TEPID TWEET

06:21:01.785 --> 06:21:03.785
AND ESSENTIALLY SAID, WHAT DID 
TRUMP DO THE AFTERNOON OF 

06:21:04.445 --> 06:21:07.810
JANUARY 6, TELL US WHAT HE DID, 
BECAUSE THAT GOES TO THE CORE 

06:21:08.567 --> 06:21:11.711
QUESTIONS THAT REALLY HAVE NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO BE MET, AND IT'S, 

06:21:12.472 --> 06:21:15.424
YOU KNOW, WHAT DID TRUMP KNOW 
AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT AND WHAT

06:21:15.640 --> 06:21:23.014
WAS THE MOTIVE BEHIND THE THINGS
THAT HE WAS DOING? AND THOSE ARE

06:21:23.230 --> 06:21:28.585
THE REMAINING QUESTIONS THAT YOU
KNOW, CANNOT BE ANSWERED UNLESS 

06:21:28.988 --> 06:21:32.279
THEY CALL A WHOLE BUNCH OF 
WITNESSES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE 

06:21:32.482 --> 06:21:37.606
AROUND TRUMP THAT DAY. WHICH IS,
AT THIS STAGE, NOT LIKELY TO 

06:21:38.369 --> 06:21:41.844
HAPPEN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

06:21:41.986 --> 06:21:44.409
US. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANYTIME. 

06:21:44.410 --> 06:21:46.410
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO POLITICAL

06:21:49.716 --> 06:21:51.748
REPORTER JOYCE CO., SO JOYCE, 
WHAT WILL WE HEAR FROM TRUMP'S 

06:21:51.950 --> 06:21:54.848
DEFENSE TEAM TOMORROW, AS THEY 
DID BEGIN THEIR ARGUMENTS? 

06:21:54.849 --> 06:21:59.974
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, TOMORROW WILL 
BE THE FIRST DAY THAT WE HEAR, 

06:22:00.175 --> 06:22:02.175
THE BEGINNING OF THE ARGUMENTS 
OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

06:22:02.631 --> 06:22:05.957
ATTORNEYS, AND MUCH OF WHAT WE 
EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THEM CAN BE 

06:22:06.172 --> 06:22:08.172
FOUND IN THIS

06:22:11.307 --> 06:22:13.567
76 PAGE LEGAL BRIEF THAT THEY 
FILED ON MONDAY, AND ONE OF 

06:22:13.782 --> 06:22:15.846
THEIR MAIN DEFENSES OF TRUMP 
WILL BE, FREE SPEECH. THE FACT 

06:22:16.060 --> 06:22:18.410
THAT HE HAS THE RIGHT TO HIS 
FIRST AMENDMENT, AND

06:22:23.822 --> 06:22:26.289
THEY WILL DEFEND THE WORDS THAT 
HE USED, BOTH IN HIS SPEECH ON 

06:22:26.490 --> 06:22:28.763
JANUARY 6 AS WELL AS SOME OF 
THOSE TWEETS AND SPEECHES THAT 

06:22:28.966 --> 06:22:30.966
WE HEARD THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS TALK ABOUT OVER THE 

06:22:31.002 --> 06:22:35.937
COURSE OF THE LAST TWO DAYS. ONE
OF THE PIECES OF THIS LEGAL 

06:22:36.142 --> 06:22:38.573
BRIEF THAT I WANTED TO MENTION, 
AS IT RELATES TO FREE SPEECH IS 

06:22:38.776 --> 06:22:41.621
WHEN DAVID SHOW IN AND BRUCE 
CASTOR TALK ABOUT THE WORD 

06:22:42.380 --> 06:22:47.348
FIGHT, AND TRUMP'S USE OF THE 
WORD FIGHT IN HIS SPEECH, WHERE 

06:22:47.551 --> 06:22:49.551
HE SAID THAT

06:22:53.498 --> 06:22:55.558
WORD NUMEROUS TIMES BUT THEY 
DEFEND THAT AS HIM USING IT 

06:22:55.773 --> 06:22:57.821
FIGURATIVELY, AND I THINK WE 
WILL SEE SEVERAL OF THOSE TYPES 

06:22:58.025 --> 06:23:00.624
OF ARGUMENTS TOMORROW WHEN WE 
HEAR OF THE ATTORNEYS OF TRUMP 

06:23:00.763 --> 06:23:04.390
BEGIN TO DEFEND HIM. IN ADDITION
TO THAT, I THINK WE CAN EXPECT 

06:23:04.606 --> 06:23:06.606
TO SEE A LOT OF

06:23:11.357 --> 06:23:12.799
ATTEMPTED PARALLELS DRAWN 
BETWEEN THE INSURRECTIONISTS AS 

06:23:12.800 --> 06:23:15.069
WELL AS THE BLACK LIVES MATTER 
PROTESTS THAT WENT ON OVER THE 

06:23:15.274 --> 06:23:21.447
COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. THAT IS
ONE OF THE POINTS THAT TRUMP'S 

06:23:21.649 --> 06:23:23.892
ATTORNEYS MAKE IN THIS LEGAL 
BRIEF, AND I THINK WE CAN EXPECT

06:23:24.091 --> 06:23:26.711
THEM TO TRY TO DRAW SOME 
PARALLELS BETWEEN THAT AS WELL 

06:23:26.895 --> 06:23:30.236
AS AGAINST THE INSURRECTION THAT
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6. IN 

06:23:30.440 --> 06:23:32.440
ADDITION TO THIS, THEY WILL 
DEFINITELY BE AN

06:23:36.390 --> 06:23:37.828
ATTACKING THE INPATIENT 
MANAGERS, GOING AFTER THE 

06:23:37.829 --> 06:23:39.696
DEMOCRATS. WE KNOW THAT TRUMP 
LAWYERS HAVE ALREADY ACCUSED 

06:23:39.697 --> 06:23:41.697
INPATIENT MANAGERS OF

06:23:48.748 --> 06:23:50.607
GLORIFYING VIOLENCE, WHEN THEY 
DRAW OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 

06:23:50.608 --> 06:23:52.608
ON JANUARY 6, AS WELL AS 
ACCUSING DEMOCRATS OF POLITICAL 

06:23:52.664 --> 06:23:54.824
OPPORTUNISM, THEY TRIED TO PAINT
THIS AS POLITICAL THEATER,

06:24:02.561 --> 06:24:04.561
AS OF COURSE WE NOTED ON 
TUESDAY'S COVERAGE, THEY DIDN'T 

06:24:04.604 --> 06:24:06.854
WANT THIS TRIAL TO BEGIN WITH. 
AND ANOTHER THING TO NOTE, IS 

06:24:07.055 --> 06:24:09.113
THAT DAVID SHOWN, ONE OF TRUMP'S
ATTORNEYS, SAID TODAY THAT TRUMP

06:24:09.329 --> 06:24:11.629
DOESN'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE ATTACK ON JANUARY 6, SO

06:24:11.843 --> 06:24:13.912
WE WILL SEE JUST HOW HIS 
ATTORNEYS MAKE THAT CASE, AFTER 

06:24:14.114 --> 06:24:19.078
THE MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE 
MANAGERS PRESENTED TODAY, AND IN

06:24:19.281 --> 06:24:21.281
ADDITION TO THE

06:24:23.785 --> 06:24:25.251
INSURRECTIONISTS, THE TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS THAT SET THEMSELVES, 

06:24:25.252 --> 06:24:27.252
AND POINTED BACK TO THEIR 
ALLEGIANCE OF

06:24:32.447 --> 06:24:34.749
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS A REASON FOR 
WHY THEY WERE THERE THAT DAY, 

06:24:34.951 --> 06:24:36.619
LIBBY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT KIND OF TONE DO WE 

06:24:36.620 --> 06:24:37.665
ANTICIPATE HEARING FROM TRUMP'S 
ATTORNEYS? 

06:24:37.666 --> 06:24:41.776
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THOSE TWO ATTORNEYS I 
TALKED ABOUT, HE IS THE ONE THAT

06:24:41.982 --> 06:24:46.992
HAS THE MORE TRUMP IN AND 
AGGRESSIVE TONE, HE'S DEFENDED 

06:24:47.154 --> 06:24:49.154
TRUMP

06:24:52.187 --> 06:24:54.428
ON FOX NEWS, HE MADE A CASE 
ATTACKING THE MANAGERS, CALLING 

06:24:55.188 --> 06:24:57.188
THEIR PRESENTATION

06:25:01.452 --> 06:25:03.452
AND ENTERTAINMENT PACKAGE, HE 
SAID THAT WHEN THEY WERE SHOWING

06:25:03.531 --> 06:25:05.600
VIDEOS OF THE VIOLENCE, THAT IT 
WAS OFFENSIVE, WE CAN ALSO 

06:25:05.801 --> 06:25:10.750
EXPECT HIS TONE TO BE FOCUSED ON
SORT OF THE, WHAT HE CALLS, THE 

06:25:10.952 --> 06:25:12.952
HYPOCRISY OF THE DEMOCRATS, HE 
ALLUDED TO YESTERDAY, THAT THERE

06:25:13.545 --> 06:25:15.545
COULD BE

06:25:19.367 --> 06:25:21.367
A POTENTIAL PRESENTATION OF 
VIDEOS, OF THE DEMOCRATS, AND HE

06:25:21.424 --> 06:25:23.442
DOES OUTLINE SOME OF THAT IN THE
LEGAL BRIEFING AS WELL, 

06:25:23.645 --> 06:25:25.645
COMPARING AND CONTRASTING

06:25:33.104 --> 06:25:34.934
THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS 
FOR EXAMPLE, TO PRESIDENT 

06:25:34.935 --> 06:25:36.576
TRUMP'S WORDS ON THE 
INSURRECTIONISTS, IT IS A 

06:25:36.577 --> 06:25:39.462
PARALLEL THAT THEY WILL ATTEMPT 
TO MAKE, BUT HIS TONE IS MORE 

06:25:39.664 --> 06:25:42.613
AGGRESSIVE THAN WHAT WE SAW FROM
BRUCE CASTOR ON TUESDAY, AND 

06:25:43.373 --> 06:25:45.373
CASTOR WAS

06:25:52.236 --> 06:25:53.876
CRITICIZED FOR HAVING A 
PERPLEXING ARGUMENT BECAUSE HE 

06:25:53.877 --> 06:25:56.116
REALLY RAMBLED A LOT, HE GAVE AN
ARGUMENT THAT MADE POINTS THAT 

06:25:56.332 --> 06:25:58.623
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY
WERE ARGUING ABOUT IT WAS 

06:25:58.824 --> 06:26:00.824
CONSTITUTIONALITY, AND HE

06:26:10.359 --> 06:26:12.213
DREW PRETTY HARSH CRITICISM FROM
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AS 

06:26:12.214 --> 06:26:14.080
WELL AS TRUMP HIMSELF, WHO WAS 
FURIOUS, REPORTEDLY, WATCHING 

06:26:14.081 --> 06:26:16.333
BRUCE CASTOR'S DEFENSE OF HIM. 
SO I THINK IN CONTRAST TO WHAT 

06:26:16.535 --> 06:26:18.584
WE SAW TUESDAY, WE WILL BE 
LOOKING TO SEE TOMORROW, WHAT 

06:26:18.786 --> 06:26:21.254
WHETHER OR NOT CASTOR AND DAVID 
SCHOEN  ARE GOING TO BE MORE 

06:26:22.012 --> 06:26:28.674
SIMILAR OR ONE ATTORNEY WHO'S 
MORE RAMBLING, THE STRATEGY

06:26:35.952 --> 06:26:38.225
WITH HIM AND CALLING IT, THAT 
THIS IS INTENTIONAL, AND HE WAS 

06:26:38.426 --> 06:26:40.697
ASKED WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS 
PLANNING ON CHANGING IT, AND HE 

06:26:40.911 --> 06:26:43.175
HAS SAID NUMEROUS TIMES, THAT HE
HAS NO PLANS ON CHANGING THEIR 

06:26:43.390 --> 06:26:48.302
STRATEGY, SO THAT'S ONE THING WE
WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING FOR 

06:26:48.507 --> 06:26:50.157
TOMORROW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAMES, YOU

06:26:50.158 --> 06:26:52.158
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT 
WHEN YOUR STRATEGY HASN'T WORKED

06:26:52.205 --> 06:26:54.438
SO FAR. SO 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR STRATEGY IS TO RAMBLE. 

06:26:54.583 --> 06:26:56.583
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:26:59.394 --> 06:27:01.437
WILL HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IN MY
PERFORMANCE REVIEW. IT'S ALL 

06:27:01.641 --> 06:27:04.127
ABOUT MY STRATEGY. JAMES, I WANT
TO TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT WE MAY 

06:27:04.328 --> 06:27:08.784
HEAR, AND JUMPING OFF OF WHERE 
JOYCE LEFT US, OUR COLLEAGUES 

06:27:08.924 --> 06:27:10.924
ARE

06:27:20.556 --> 06:27:22.395
FILING PULL REPORTS, GETTING 
SOME FEEDBACK FROM CAPITOL HILL,

06:27:22.396 --> 06:27:24.452
AND I WANT TO SHARE YOU WHAT 
SENATOR TURBERVILLE HAS SAID, 

06:27:24.653 --> 06:27:26.914
THIS IS FRESHMAN, BRAND-NEW TO 
THIS ALL, HE SAID HE WANTS TO 

06:27:27.118 --> 06:27:29.192
HEAR FROM THE DEFENSE TEAM, WHY 
THIS IS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL AND 

06:27:29.395 --> 06:27:31.662
THEN GO FROM THERE. OF COURSE 
THIS GETS US BACK TO THE 

06:27:32.440 --> 06:27:36.597
ARGUMENT THAT JAMIE RASKIN WAS 
MAKING TODAY, TRYING TO SAY THAT

06:27:36.795 --> 06:27:39.125
WE ARE DONE WITH THAT, THE BOOK 
IS CLOSED, AND RASKIN COMPARED 

06:27:39.885 --> 06:27:41.885
IT TO

06:27:46.886 --> 06:27:49.132
YOU KNOW, IN A TRIAL, A DEFENSE 
LAWYER LOSING EMOTION AND HAVING

06:27:49.337 --> 06:27:51.337
TO MOVE ON. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU MAKE A MOTION TO 

06:27:51.363 --> 06:27:53.601
DISMISS AND THE JUDGE REJECTS 
IT, THEN YOU HAVE TO ARGUE THE 

06:27:53.803 --> 06:27:56.290
FACTS OF THE CASE. AND THAT'S 
WHERE WE ARE AT, BUT THAT DOES 

06:27:56.505 --> 06:27:58.782
NOT MEAN THAT THE DEFENSE DID 
NOT MAKE THE ARGUMENT, IT'S NOT 

06:27:58.987 --> 06:28:01.897
A COURT OF LAW, IT IS A COURT, 
BUT IT IS ULTIMATELY A COURT OF 

06:28:02.659 --> 06:28:06.609
PUBLIC OPINION. NOW, EVERY 
SENATOR, ALL 100 OF THEM, SWORE 

06:28:06.813 --> 06:28:08.851
AN OATH AT THE START OF THE 
TRIAL TO RENDER IMPARTIAL 

06:28:09.066 --> 06:28:14.379
JUSTICE. OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE ALL
BIASED, THEY ARE ALL PARTISANS, 

06:28:14.594 --> 06:28:16.594
TRIBALISM IS THE BEST THING 
WORKING AND TRUMP'S FAVOR RIGHT 

06:28:16.627 --> 06:28:18.627
NOW BUT THEY HAVE SWORN A

06:28:22.342 --> 06:28:27.693
SACRED OATH ON THE BIBLE TO 
RENDER IMPARTIAL JUSTICE, AND I 

06:28:27.908 --> 06:28:30.159
THINK A LOT OF THE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING

06:28:30.378 --> 06:28:33.280
FOR PROCEDURAL OFF RAMPS AND 
ESSENTIALLY LEGAL LOOPHOLES, SO 

06:28:33.481 --> 06:28:37.344
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THE 
PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE TEAM MAKE 

06:28:37.545 --> 06:28:39.545
THAT CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT 
AGAIN

06:28:45.814 --> 06:28:47.833
, EVEN IF THEY DON'T LEAN 
HEAVILY INTO IT. YOU WILL 

06:28:48.049 --> 06:28:50.275
CERTAINLY HEAR A LOT OF SENATORS
USE THAT AS A JUSTIFICATION TO 

06:28:50.476 --> 06:28:53.003
VOTE NOT TO CONVICT. AND, YOU 
WILL HEAR A LOT OF THE THINGS 

06:28:53.220 --> 06:28:55.841
THAT THE DEMOCRATS ADDRESS IN 
THEIR PRE-BATTLE,

06:29:03.652 --> 06:29:05.914
THERE WAS THE 75 PAGE BRIEF, AND
THEY KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S 

06:29:06.116 --> 06:29:08.329
DEFENSE TEAM HAS SAID THAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO ARGUE, 

06:29:08.468 --> 06:29:12.137
ULTIMATELY, WE DO HAVE THIS 
OATH, AND ONE OF THE THINGS 

06:29:12.340 --> 06:29:15.689
THAT'S BEEN INTERESTING, IS HOW 
MANY PEOPLE

06:29:29.145 --> 06:29:31.184
TALK ABOUT OUR TEAM, OUR SIDE, 
JOHN CORNYN, THE REPUBLICAN FROM

06:29:31.387 --> 06:29:33.633
TEXAS SAID OUR SIDE GOES UP 
TOMORROW AND WE WILL SEE WHAT 

06:29:33.835 --> 06:29:36.073
OUR SITE DOES. AND A YEAR AGO, 
MITCH McCONNELL SAID LOOK, I'M 

06:29:36.273 --> 06:29:38.302
NOT IMPARTIAL JUROR, I WANT THE 
PRESIDENT TO GET ACQUITTED, HE 

06:29:38.515 --> 06:29:40.552
DIDN'T SAY THAT THIS TIME, HE'S 
BEEN MORE CIRCUMSPECT BUT THAT 

06:29:40.767 --> 06:29:46.678
IS VERY AT ODDS WITH WHAT IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT EVERYONE ON 

06:29:46.881 --> 06:29:52.920
THE SITE IS NOT IMPARTIAL HERE
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS SOMETHING, A LOT OF 

06:29:53.669 --> 06:29:58.361
THESE MEMBERS ARE NOT EVEN 
MAKING AN EFFORT TO PUT ON THE 

06:29:58.551 --> 06:30:01.717
ILLUSION OF IMPARTIALITY PICK 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH

06:30:06.051 --> 06:30:08.295
