00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.480
- I'm really rich.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.280
I'll show you that in a sec.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.040
- So, Trump is
no longer president,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.510
but he is still
the dominant fundraiser

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.820
in the Republican Party.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.020
He has immense name recognition.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.600
And for anyone who has signed up

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.800
to receive his committee's
text messages or e-mails,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.570
you will know that many of them
come rapidly each day.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.350
And it appears
that his supporters

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.570
are susceptible to that,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.070
that it's a vehicle
for them to give,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.820
largely in small increments.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.630
When his operation announced
recently that they had raised

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.980
about $51 million
in the last 6 months of 2021,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.370
they said that 98% of donations
were under $200.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.130
So, it really does show the kind
of grassroots support

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.180
that still exists out there
for him in the country.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.220
I would say everything
about this is rare.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.690
We have an ex-president
who has been kicked off

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.140
major social-media platforms.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
Those platforms were once
his mechanism

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.380
of connecting
directly to his base.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.170
And so, it is quite rare for him

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
to still be bringing
in this kind of money.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.630
- This November, you have to
throw these raving lunatics

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.950
the hell out of power
and elect strong,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.020
smart, tough Republicans.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.060
- So, he's got about $122
million in the bank

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.340
across a couple of committees
that he's using to fundraise.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.000
And one kind of interesting
point

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.270
is that one of these is
what's called a leadership PAC.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.140
And he has really
broad discretion

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.230
on how to use
this money --

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.600
travel, political events,
really, you name it.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.040
One of the things
that he can't do

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.740
is use it to finance
his own candidacy.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.950
So, he has not yet announced
a campaign for 2024,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.170
and if he were to do so,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.590
that would complicate
some of this.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.360
It would trigger campaign-
finance requirements

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.430
that could potentially
snarl the discretion

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030
that he currently
has to use these funds

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.870
basically as he pleases

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.170
and in ways that essentially
amount to a campaign lite.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.660
One other notable transfer
from his committees

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.460
other than to some of these
candidates and other causes

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.880
was to a conservative nonprofit

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.390
that recently brought
on Mark Meadows,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.420
Trump's former chief of staff,
as a senior partner.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120
So, we're seeing ways in which
he's using

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.040
some of these resources
to funnel money to allies

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.220
and to reward people
who remain loyal to him.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.080
- I also want to thank
President Trump for his support.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.310
He is a critical part
of our Republican team.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.820
- And one key question will be
how this money is spent.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.680
We saw in the most recent
filing,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.760
which came out
at the end of January,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.850
that there were some transfers
to state

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.960
and federal candidates
and committees,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.720
like-minded candidates
and state parties and so on.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.380
But those ultimately accounted

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.310
for just a fraction of the money
that he's bringing in.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.490
So, I've talked to some people
in the party

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.530
who think that he has brought

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.070
so many of these supporters
into the fold

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.900
that it doesn't
necessarily trade off

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.050
with the traditional avenues
of GOP fundraising,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.340
party fundraising,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.580
and that it can
only benefit the party.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.060
But I think that there will be
mounting questions

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.810
about how this money
is being spent

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.750
and whether it's really
being spent in a way

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.510
that is an asset
to the Republican Party

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.180
or to Donald Trump.
