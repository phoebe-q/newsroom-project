00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.110
the cars that you're unlikely to see in
a showroom near you anytime soon

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.719
Iranian vehicles, yes! the country does
produce them, are sold across the Middle

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.090
East including here in Lebanon but with
a fresh round of sanctions hitting Iran

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.500
it's gonna get harder to get behind the
wheel of one of these

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.120
world powers cut a deal with Tehran

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300
curb your nuclear program they said, in return for a lifting of sanctions

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.880
may be seen as a big win for
international diplomacy

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.640
But Donald Trump didn't agree

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.620
frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.860
don't think you've heard the last of it
believe me

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.920
so what's caviar face cream got to do
with all of this well it comes from Iran

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.260
and companies wanting to sell this stuff
could face stiff penalties from the US so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.670
they don't want to touch it and that's
the reason it's been sold for knock-down

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.200
prices at trade fair.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.360
but the sanctions are
really designed to target Iran's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.320
all-important oil sector already the
country's economy is struggling

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.220
America warns Tehran that it must stop sowing chaos in the region many believe

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.159
Washington is trying to drive a wedge
between the government and the people

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.590
but this Iranian carpet seller in Beirut says it's not going to work.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.480
The Sanctions is very bad maybe make make many problems for Iranian for medicine

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.360
transportation for insurance for for
example for for commerce is very bad but

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.799
you know Iranian there is this is 40
years they are in sanction and they know

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.247
how to deal with the sanction

00:01:58.247 --> 00:02:02.299
Iran sees sanctions as the latest example of

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.760
American bullying, its vowed to break them

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.390
but it's also playing the long game

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.780
Europe China and Russia all think
America's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.970
decision is wrong and they're trying to
find ways around the sanctions although

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.480
it's tricky so for now Iran is being patient
hopeful that all see the back of

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.620
President Trump
