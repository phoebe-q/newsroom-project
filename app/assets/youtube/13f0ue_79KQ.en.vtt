00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.360
Hi I’m Senator Frank Wagner I’m also a
candidate for governor of Virginia.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.250
We're here with Senator Frank Wagner, State
Senator from Virginia Beach a longtime legislator

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.849
he actually served in the House of Delegates
in the early 90s maybe you can tell us a little

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.210
bit about your career in the general assembly.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.210
Sure.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.990
After I sold my first company I had a non-compete
on me for four years and I think like most

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.470
everybody I was very concerned about what
I saw going on in government and said I really

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.690
have the opportunity to to run for office
when will I take that opportunity?

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.690
That was 1991 and I won that election and
I've been in the legislature ever since.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.690
That's right.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.800
And in that time you see a lot of changes
in Richmond I guess.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.130
Well I when I first started serving it was
25 years ago Governor Wilder was the governor.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.719
I've been through Democrat governors Republican
governors Democrat controlled legislature

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.020
with Democrat governor Republican controlled
legislature.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.780
So virtually every combination that you could
possibly come up Republican control with the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.619
Republican governor and it's been just tremendous
opportunity to to work all sides.

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.840
But I've tried to focus on issues that I believe
my constituents and really all of Virginia

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.590
does based on my background which is going
to the Naval Academy heavily involved in Navy

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.590
engineering plans.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.159
I was a hardhat diver in the Navy but I was
also an engineer and duty officer.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.140
So I try to bring the expertise and the skill
sets that I learned in the Navy along with

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.049
my private sector business experience to bear
as I take a look at issues up in Richmond

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.560
and try to move forward on those issues that
actually help promote the economy grow the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.200
economy and diversify the economy in Virginia.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.249
And tell us about your business background.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.459
You're in ship building right?

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.459
Ship repair ship repair.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.469
When I left naval service it was 1982.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.179
I worked for yard for one year and decided
this is a great opportunity why don't I get

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.329
into business myself.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.709
So I started up a business by myself worked
primarily as a consultant.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.700
I was then able to start get industrial work
and started hiring some of the people that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.270
I work with welders, ship fitters, pipefitters,
really the people that make Virginia run.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.569
Brought a crew around that had worked for
me in a previous yard and we built that company

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.239
from scratch up to 100 people and sold that
in 1989.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.469
But I think more importantly it draws on a
lot of what I want to talk about during the

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:15.469
campaign.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.489
Of course you've got deep roots in Hampton
roads you're very well known in that area

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.530
and.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.680
You also have roots in northern Virginia.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680
Absolutely.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.930
I went to Woodmont Elementary in Arlington
Stratford junior high.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.780
I graduated from Washington and Lee High School
so I grew up in northern Virginia with the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.099
exception of my my dad's one year military
service out in Fort Hood, Texas before he

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.099
retired.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.099
I've been in Virginia all my life.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.750
So what's your window into how the economy
is doing these days.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.690
Virginia of course its very dependent on government
spending and defense contracting in particular.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.560
We have to produce a balanced budget so revenues
are very much driven in our Commonwealth by

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.280
sales taxes and income taxes which is directly
relevant to the State of the economy really

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.349
shows up and government spending is a huge
part of Virginia's economy.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.859
Obviously my area defense spending is very
very important.

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.530
The thing that's concerned me an entire time
that I've been there 25 years we've never

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.439
taken the good times.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.670
We just kind of relax and that's not the time
to relax that's the time we should have focused

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.980
on diversifying Virginia's economy because
the more diverse your economy is the better

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.079
you're able to weather these turn downs and
recessions when they come or a Washington

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.549
developed recession if you will by curtailing
government spending.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.940
So we have got to build up our industrial
base in Virginia diversify our economy build

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.859
up our manufacturing base and attract more
and more high tech industry not use use what

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.330
the high tech brings us from the government
to be able to commercialize a lot of that

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.569
high tech capture that business in Virginia
continue to grow our economy.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.470
You know it's interesting that the economy
is an issue is in this campaign Governor McAuliffe

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.170
would argue the unemployment rate is coming
down 3.9 percent.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.719
Why is the economy an issue in Virginia when
on the surface appears to be doing pretty

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.719
well?

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.719
Numbers don't lie.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:05.719
OK.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.840
And remember what I just told you are our
revenues are based on income taxes and sales

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840
taxes.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.120
We walked into this session a $1.2 billion
deficit directly related to income taxes and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.859
sales tax collections in Virginia.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.709
The economy is sputtering.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.160
In Virginia at best you can say yes we're
at 3.9 percent.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.120
That leaves out the fact that a lot of people
gave up looking for work and a lot of people

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.349
are working at low paying jobs and those type
so leaves out that fact but those numbers

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.220
those revenue collections don't lie.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.740
The $1.2 billion deficit was very very real
and that's a reflection of the economy.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.669
We do not have a transportation system adequate
for the economy today.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.880
So how can one talk about growing the economy
or diversify an economy without an investment

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.280
in transportation.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.180
Now those in Northern Virginia in my neck
of the woods we feel it every day and congestion

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.340
so they will with what's going on in Southside
Virginia?

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.169
You know that you know there's no traffic
there.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.830
Why do they have a transportation problem.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.900
Well they do because the economy is is not
sputtering.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.349
If you drive down through there is basically
it looks like a recession perhaps depression

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.669
yet you cross the border in North Carolina
in Winston-Salem and Greensboro and the economy

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:15.670
is on fire.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.770
Just 30, 40 miles away and you ask yourself
why?

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.330
You know why is that going on.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.940
Well North Carolina has made the investment
in an interstate highway system in North Carolina

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.710
has made an investment in broadband and consequently
their economies.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.430
You know it's the same people 30, 40 miles
apart.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.430
Their economy is on fire.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.430
Our is not.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.430
that's just a classic example.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.009
Now why should people in Northern Virginia
care.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.449
I'll tell you why.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.180
$800 for every man woman and child in Fairfax
County goes to Richmond and doesn't come back

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.180
to northern Virginia.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.750
It goes to treat symptoms of a bad economy.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.530
More social programs more more.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.039
You know money for education because it reduce
class sizes because people are leaving are.

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.310
More money that would otherwise be coming
to northern Virginia.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.630
It's going down there to treat symptoms not
the cause of the disease but the symptoms.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.320
I'm here to cure the disease.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.810
Let's make those investments in broadband
let's make those investments in interstate

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.330
highway and transportation network and let's
return Southside back to the manufacturing

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.860
base that it was -it used to sustain Northern
Virginia with textiles, with furniture, with

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.860
tobacco.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.860
Well those are gone.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.400
One of your rivals for the republican nomination,
Ed Gillespie, has put out down tax plan that

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.770
calls for a 10 percent cut in the income tax.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.590
Can you talk about that, do you have thoughts
on the tax policy in Virginia?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.710
Well let's let's first of all just review
what I just said.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.080
I think our tax policy is extremely competitive
with the rest of the states.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.810
Go look and compare state by state by state.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.400
I pay a lot of taxes.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.000
I would love to have a tax cut.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.510
But the reality of what I just told you is
we just closed a $1.2 billion deficit.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.800
We're not the federal government.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.009
We can't print money.

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.990
We can't go out and borrow money.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.639
We have to have a balanced budget.

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:04.620
And so that $1.2 billion we can talk about
an income tax cut which I would love.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.789
Flies in the face of that.

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:11.009
We have a $6 billion imbalance in our Virginia
retirement system.

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:12.539
I don't want us to be like Illinois.

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.810
I don't want us to be like New Jersey.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.861
I want to make sure that we have the money
available to fund that so we don't lay off

00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:23.569
a huge huge problem on the next generation.

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.229
I've dealt with this for 25 years.

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.430
I understand the structural balance of what
goes on in the state government.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.039
I understand just how much that we have cut
out of agencies how much we cut and it shows

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:36.180
up it shows up in higher tuitions.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.259
It shows up in many things shows up in the
fact that we can't keep state police on the

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.830
police force until we just address the pay
issue there.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.560
These are real problems that we face day in
and day out.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.630
I can't mislead people.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.069
Now I think it either shows a lack of understanding
of what's going on which is to be expected.

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:57.979
He doesn't know anything about what's going
on in state government or it or he doesn't

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:03.229
you know or he understands but he but he's
going out there and saying well I'll say anything

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:04.849
do anything to try to get elected.

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:06.349
I can't do that.

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:10.599
It's just not in my makeup to go out there
and say anything or try anything to get elected.

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:14.560
I want to talk about the real problems and
my ideas for real solutions.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.289
But I can sit here and look at Virginia now
and say if we're truly going to turn the economy

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:25.910
around I don't think a proposed tax cut on
down the road -you know two three years if

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.150
it hits certain revenue if you read the fine
print of this thing is going to achieve it.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.150
I do think making a bigger investment in transportation.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.510
And I'll tell you one more thing and you see
it every day and the more I travel around

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.780
the state and talk to people this is a problem
we have in our education system that I believe

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.110
is nationwide.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.580
We have put together a system in Virginia
called the standards of learning which is

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.920
wonderful if you want to go to college.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.000
And we've done it at the expense of career
technical education.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.790
And so what I'm proposing and made a major
part of my campaign is around sixth grade

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.860
seventh grade.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.200
We make parents and the students aware of
the opportunities and career technical education

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.560
and we provide the resources and the instructors.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.450
So if a student wants to pursue career technical
education as opposed to a traditional college

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.450
bound.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.710
We have the groundwork we have the basis for
them to start down that road to pursue a career

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.130
technical education.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.020
We make that fundamental change in education
in Virginia.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.850
We're going to grow like you've never believe
Now you've got a skill set.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.090
But I'll tell you another secret.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.250
Those with a good career technical education
are making more money than a college graduate

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.480
is today.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.580
And one more thing.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.270
They have jobs and a lot of college graduates
can't find jobs right now and they don't carry

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.650
student loans that the college graduates have.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.700
And that's going to be a huge national problem.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.870
The fact the amount of student loans on the
books and the amount of non-performing student

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.440
loans is an issue that Washington D.C. is
going to have to deal with.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.170
But I want to see Virginia start making and
recognizing where the jobs are.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:55.140
It seems like a centerpiece of your case for
running for governor is your experience 25

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.130
years in the legislature.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.640
You know how Richmond works.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.140
It seems a little at odds with what we saw
last year where there was a real you know

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:13.310
there was this success of the outsider on
both for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump who

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.690
course won.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:22.400
Do you feel that that's your case of experiences
is out of step at all with what Virginia's

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.510
for now.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:29.010
Is there groundswell of wanting to elect an
outsider to come in and shake things up?

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.850
Well I'll compare this.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.710
You know I think obviously a whole lot of
people around the country thought Washington

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.910
D.C. was heading in the wrong direction.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.910
OK.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.840
I think people in Virginia think Virginia
is OK.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.250
But needs to be set in the right direction.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.120
And let me say one more thing my principal
opponent Ed Gillespie is a D.C. lobbyist.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.070
I mean he is the ultimate Washington insider.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:00.390
His record of lobbying for Enron and doing
those things and using his power in relation

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.980
with the White House to profit and make money
on the outside.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.640
You know Donald Trump talked about draining
the swamp.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:14.630
You know that is the swamp and that's what
a lot of people rebelled against.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.070
Just quickly your other opponent for the Republican
nomination, Corey Stewart said that the fate

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.630
of confederate statues in cities in Virginia
is one of the central issues of the campaign.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.850
Do you agree with that?

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.840
I think our heritage and our history is very
important and I don't you can't rewrite history.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:35.190
In fact you learn from history and I think
was Santana said those who fail to learn from

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.360
history are doomed to repeat the mistakes
in the future.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.590
So I think our heritage is very important
and certainly Virginia has a heritage and

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.990
I think the more people learn you know we've
had some great leaders.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:51.100
But like most great leaders they have had
flaws and we need to learn from that.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.700
But I think an attempt to do away with these
things to pretend they never happened to hide

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.250
them is a mistake.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.040
I really truly believe that's a mistake.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.610
And I can understand the sensitivity issue.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:08.320
I understand the sensitivity but if we learn
from history then maybe we won't make the

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.250
same mistakes that were made before.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.269
And we have to recognize that great leaders
have flaws they have flaws.

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:18.070
Stewart of course was affiliated with the
Trump in Virginia for much of the race last

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.520
year.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.390
What's your feeling about the Trump administration
and its start so far and what that means for

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.390
Virginia.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:32.050
Would you be looking as Governor to work with
the ministry to further somethings that have

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:40.020
already started such as You know the immigration
tightening, looking at federal spending cuts

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.020
that kind of thing?

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.260
Let me just say a few things.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.420
First of all jobs and the economy let's focus
on that if the defense spending comes through.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:55.240
Obviously it will be a boon for my area down
in Hampton Roads but it'll be a boon for northern

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.100
Virginia as well.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.680
Will the boon be big enough to offset perhaps
some of the lay offs in some of the other

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.500
agencies that that represent many folks in
Northern Virginia?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.580
Until Congress passes a budget I don't think
we'll have those answers.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.830
There's some things in there that he propose
obviously I don't agree with him.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.220
I'm on the Chesapeake Bay Commission.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.940
We've made huge strides in cleaning up the
bay.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.420
We need to keep the momentum going.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.780
We are really turning the corner in Chesapeake
Bay.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.920
I feel very strongly about the efforts we
made.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.170
Virginia has contributed literally billions
of dollars over the years in terms of upgrading

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.690
our sewage treatment plants.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:34.500
In terms of working with our farmers to keep
livestock out of our streams and working with

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.260
our farmers to put in buffer zones around
the field so that the fields don't run right

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.490
into the stream.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.490
Many things.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.490
And we're seeing the results of that.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.050
We need to keep that momentum going.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.970
So there's certainly things in every budget
I can pick apart.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.040
In terms of the policy...

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:56.180
look those immigrants that commit crimes and
they're here illegally need to go.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.210
Period.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.240
OK.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.140
Illegal immigration means you're here illegally.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:09.570
Now I believe that a vibrant guest worker
program where we invite people I'm not just

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:14.890
talking guest Mexican I'm talking guest Indian
guest Filipino guest Korean guests all over

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:21.700
the world come to our country do the things
that perhaps Americans are not there or are

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.280
you know we need your help to fill in that
workload whether it's whether it's you know

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.130
harvesting crops or you know finishing cement
or so many of the things that the immigrants

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.480
do making money go home.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.860
If you do that you're welcome back another
trip to come back and do work you know back.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.610
I think a vibrant guest worker program would
solve a lot of the problems of people wanting

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.960
to come here illegally if they knew they could
come here work and go back home again and

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960
bring their money with them.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.260
It's the best foreign aid that I can ever
think of.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.940
Before we wrap up let me just throw out a
couple off speed pitches.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.940
Sure.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.420
When you were growing up other than become
governor one day, what was your dream job?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.260
I had my dream job I was a Navy hard diver.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.910
It was it was fascinating.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:11.930
I got a chance to go underwater some not so
nice.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.550
You know a lot of work underneath ships a
lot of cold water a lot of dirty water.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.790
Naples harbor a few other places that strike
my mind.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:27.580
But just just the opportunity to go under
water serve your country but work around some

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.040
of the best professionals I've ever worked
around the other divers I worked around.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.680
Is that your preferred way to unwind when
you're not in Richmond?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.880
Oh I'm probably my my preferred way of unwinding
is playing golf.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.570
I mean I'm not sure I unwind when I play it.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:45.280
You know I certainly am frustrated but but
every once in a while you make that good shot

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.440
and you think I'll be on the Seniors golf
tour.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.860
You know they're going to be calling me any
minute now any minute now to put me on the

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.800
Seniors and then back to reality on the next
hole.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.910
But it's fun and I enjoy the camaraderie with
the other golfers and it's a chance to not

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.100
feel like you're on stage as a senator but
it's a chance to relax

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.030
Well thank you very much for talking with
us today.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.550
Really appreciate.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.820
It's been wonderful.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.850
Thank you so much.
