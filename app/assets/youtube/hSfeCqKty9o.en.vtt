00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.200
- Remember, you know,
we took care of a lot of people

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.360
including, I guess,
on December 21st,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.020
we took care of Joe Biden

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.740
'cause he got his shot,
he got his vaccine.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.800
He forgot.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.240
It shows you how unpainful
that vaccine shot

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.290
is so everybody
go get your shot.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.700
It works incredibly well.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.700
95%, maybe even more than that,
it works incredibly well

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.440
and I would recommend it
a lot of people

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.850
that don't wanna get it

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.830
and a lot of those people
voted for me,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.870
frankly, but, you know, again,
we have our freedoms

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.420
and we have to live by that
and I agree with that also.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.210
But it's a great vaccine,
it's a safe vaccine,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.390
and it's something that works.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.640
I recommend you take it,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.220
but I also believe
in your freedoms 100%.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.110
When you have the vaccine,
people that do,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.480
and it's a very small number
relatively,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810
but people that do get
it get better much quicker

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.190
and it's a very important
thing to know.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.030
They don't get nearly as sick
and they get better,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.430
Lindsey Graham's an example.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.810
He said if I didn't have
this vaccine, I would've died.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.530
And you know what?

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.190
I believe totally
in your freedoms,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130
I do, you gotta do
what you have to do,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.110
but I recommend
taking the vaccines,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.180
I did it, it's good,
take the vaccines.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.520
But you got -- no, that's okay.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.050
That's all right.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.280
You got your freedoms.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.100
But I happen to take
the vaccine.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.990
The vaccines do work
and they are effective.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.150
And here's my -- my thing.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.090
So I'm -- I am,
I think I've saved many --

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.160
I don't think, I know,
I saved millions

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.960
and millions of lives
throughout the world.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.260
We could've had another
Spanish flu,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.540
we could've had, you know,
in 1917,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.210
close to a hundred million
people die they said,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.840
but it was really bad.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.430
And now other countries
are using our vaccines

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.110
and, you know, tremendous.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.270
They're tremendously successful.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.400
You're playing right
into their hands

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.300
when you're sort of like,
oh, the vaccine.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.250
If you don't want to take it,
you shouldn't be forced

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.140
to take it,
no mandates,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.580
but take credit because we saved
tens of millions of lives.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.370
Take credit.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.390
Don't let them take
that away from you.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.150
- Okay, so the president
made news --

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.680
-Do you agree with that?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.280
Right?

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.450
- Both the president
and I are vaxxed

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.640
and did you get the booster?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280
- Yes.
- I got it, too.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.790
Okay, so.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.010
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.
