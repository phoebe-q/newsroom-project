00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960 position:98%
It's estimated that 1 in 20 women in the European Union has been raped.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.160
That's around nine million.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.600 position:98%
So how a country defines and punishes this crime matters a lot.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.080 position:73%
Rape has a huge impact on an individual's life.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160 position:97%
Today, I almost feel: 'Yes I have to still sleep with my lights on.'

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.680 position:89%
The problem is Europe's rape laws are all over the place.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.680
We need massive legal changes

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.000 position:61%
and we need a discussion about consent.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.280 position:75%
Judges have upheld the decision of a lower court

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.320 position:84%
to clear five men of gang-raping an 18-year-old woman.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.920 position:63%
This case sent shockwaves through Spain.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.480
Then came another.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.040 position:98%
Five men who had sex with an unconscious 14-year-old were also cleared of rape.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.440 position:91%
In Spain the law says that for something to count as rape,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.800 position:61%
there must be violence or intimidation.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.280 position:98%
So really different from the UK where rape is sex without consent

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.480 position:97%
and if somebody can't consent, so say they're unconscious, then it's still rape.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.120 position:97%
The world was outraged by the cases in Spain, but Spain is far from alone.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.680 position:98%
Of all the countries in the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Switzerland,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.600 position:67%
only nine treat non-consensual sex as rape,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.440 position:98%
in the other 22, there has to be some sort of violence or threat.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.840 position:94%
We all know that you can actually be raped without violence.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.280 position:80%
A lot of victims become so scared that they freeze.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.320 position:64%
In my case I was asleep when it happened,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680 position:97%
and he didn't hurt me physically, so I didn't have any bruises on me at all.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.160 position:67%
Despite its reputation for gender equality,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.760 position:81%
Denmark has some of the weakest rape laws in Europe.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.840 position:94%
To be guilty of rape here you must have threatened violence.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200 position:86%
I think I was like: 'Wait this is not happening to me.'

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.280 position:98%
And it took me a while before I was like: 'OK this is happening to me.'

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.600 position:98%
Emilie woke up at a friend's house to find a man she didn't know having sex with her.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.880 position:61%
I woke up while it was happening, yeah.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.040 position:97%
I just froze totally. Then I asked him to stop and pulled my clothes back on

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.440 position:56%
and just went straight out the door.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.560 position:97%
But because her attacker hadn't used violence, he was cleared of rape.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.160 position:98%
I was in court, they were questioning me about if I said no, did I push him back?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.400 position:70%
'Did you do anything to stop him?'
I was like: 'Well first of all, I was asleep.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.440 position:98%
And then when I woke up, I was shocked, I was totally shocked.'

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.440 position:98%
Perpetrators are not punished, victims are not receiving justice.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.480 position:97%
We are calling all states to change their definitions of rape,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.040 position:97%
in order to base them on absence of consent and not on use of force.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.000 position:70%
Convictions in Denmark are astonishingly low.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.040 position:83%
The government estimates more than 5,000 women a year

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.240 position:59%
are victims of rape or attempted rape,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.360 position:67%
but in 2018 there were only 77 convictions.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560 position:83%
So countries are under pressure to change their laws.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.040 position:98%
Greece, Iceland and Sweden have changed theirs in the last two years.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.920 position:59%
Here, sex without consent is now rape.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.640 position:98%
It used to be the woman who had to prove that she had not given consent

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640
or that she was raped.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.520 position:94%
And today it's the perpetrator who actually has more or less

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.080
to explain how he got a consent.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.960
So what difference has this made?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.400 position:92%
You have I think at least six or seven cases now in Sweden,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.840 position:84%
cases that would not have been considered rape before.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.920 position:73%
We talk a lot more about rape as a criminal act

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.640 position:86%
and it's easier to explain today what rape actually is.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.320 position:97%
Now Denmark, Spain and Finland are thinking about changing their laws,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.240 position:98%
but that still leaves 19 countries with no plans to change, which is a problem.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.800 position:97%
In 2014, a new European treaty came into force, designed to protect women from violence.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.040 position:56%
It's called the Istanbul Convention,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.120 position:97%
and it says that countries must have laws that make sex without consent a crime.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.760 position:63%
And most countries in Europe signed up .

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.760 position:97%
Countries who are not changing their definition in line with the Istanbul Convention

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.800
are breaching international law.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.000 position:95%
In Poland, rape is only rape if there's violence or coercion.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.600 position:64%
And rape within a marriage isn't a crime.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.400 position:72%
We still teach our girls how not to get raped,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.600 position:94%
instead of teaching the boys not to rape in the first place.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.760 position:95%
Here, rape carries one of the lightest punishments in Europe.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.840 position:91%
30, 40% of men who commit rape are sentenced to two years,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.840 position:91%
and from this 30 or 40, 60% have their sentence suspended,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.600
so they don't even go to jail.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.880 position:59%
I'm from Amnesty International Poland.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.640 position:88%
Amnesty International are concerned about Poland's laws.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.720 position:58%
We're doing a campaign about consent.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.880 position:97%
They've started visiting bars and clubs to teach young people about consent.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.880
So we have some tattoos...

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.760
The tattoo says 'tak to miłość'.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.480
It means 'yes is love' in English.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.960 position:88%
But it could get even harder to talk about consent here.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.080 position:98%
The government's proposing a new law dubbed 'the paedophile law'.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.240 position:78%
It makes it a crime to talk to children about sex.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.960
Effectively, it bans sex education.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.160 position:97%
Lack of education is resulting in stigma attached to victims of rape and violence.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.680 position:91%
They are not knowing their rights, they are not reporting.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.480 position:97%
I was called a paedophile several times, I was also called a murderer.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.240 position:88%
I was threatened on the streets verbally and physically.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.520
For teaching children about sex?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.040
Yeah.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.520 position:98%
Across Europe women are increasingly angry with their governments

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.800 position:77%
for failing to protect them from sexual violence.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.080 position:81%
Women in this country are getting a little bit weary

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.240 position:86%
at the routine victim-blaming going on in Irish courts,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.240 position:98%
and the failure of lawmakers in this house to do anything about it.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.960 position:98%
If it happens again and we haven't changed the law, I wouldn't report it.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.520 position:98%
Going to court again and all the questions, it's not worth it, I think.
