00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.410
-Come on inside, folks.
-Did he say "come inside"?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.300
-Hold on, not yet.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's--
-Oh.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040
-What a nice picture that is.
Look at that.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.270
I'd love to watch
that guy speak.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.300
Oh, boy.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.530
That's...

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.750
I'll get that little piece
of dandruff off.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.300
-And important for all peoples.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.490
Thank you.
-Thanks you.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.490
Thank you.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.860
-I like him a lot.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.160
Getting a good picture,
everybody,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.900
so we look nice
and handsome and thin?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.650
-Beautiful.
-Perfect.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.730
-Nice and young.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.410
-This is a tough hurricane.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.310
One of the wettest
we've ever seen

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.720
from the standpoint of water.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.440
At least you got a nice boat
out of it.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.010
China has total respect
for Donald Trump

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.010
and for Donald Trump's
very, very large brain.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.500
And then we fell in love.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.470
Okay?
No, really.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.310
He wrote me beautiful letters.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:12.280
-I love this guy right here.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.840
Let me give this guy
a hug right here.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.240
I love this guy right here.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.700
-That's really nice.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.220
Come here.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.200
That's -- that's really nice.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.710
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.790
Trying to sneak out.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.390
And they spend a lot of time
on raking and cleaning

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.620
and doing things.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.610
And they don't have
any problems.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.790
I think I understood you better
in your language

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:21.500
then I did on this.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.750
But that's okay.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.450
-It is tails.
