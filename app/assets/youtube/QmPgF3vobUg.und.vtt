00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:26.223
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO THE CAPITAL,
TRY AND GIVE THEM THE KIND OF 

00:29:26.637 --> 00:29:31.306
PRIDE AND BOLDNESS THEY NEED TO 
TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. 

00:29:31.307 --> 00:29:33.307
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD TRUMP IS

00:29:37.806 --> 00:29:39.422
IMPEACHED FOR HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS, ARTICLE 1, 

00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:45.323
INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MOST REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO

00:29:45.524 --> 00:29:47.524
SAY THIS IS NOT INCITEMENT

00:29:51.209 --> 00:29:53.040
UNDER THE LAW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS WILL DECIDE ON THE 

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.074
ONE TRUE QUESTION AT STAKE IN 
THIS TRIAL. IS DONALD TRUMP 

00:29:55.275 --> 00:29:58.950
GUILTY OF INCITING A VIOLENT MOB
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES? 

00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:10.597
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TODAY, DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS
DEFEND HIM AGAINST THE CHARGE OF

00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:18.027
INCITING INSURRECTION AND HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. OVER 

00:30:18.226 --> 00:30:20.335
THE LAST FEW DAYS, HOUSE 
DEMOCRATS MADE THEIR CASE

00:30:24.325 --> 00:30:26.325
THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOP THAT 

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:31.024
ATTACKED THE U.S. CAPITOL IN 
JANUARY 6. THEY WARNED IF LEFT 

00:30:31.226 --> 00:30:33.056
UNPUNISHED TRUMP COULD INCITE 
MORE VIOLENCE. NOW THE FOCUS 

00:30:33.057 --> 00:30:35.057
TURNS TO THE DEFENSE.

00:30:37.726 --> 00:30:39.762
TRUMP'S LAWYERS HAVE EIGHT HOURS
AND EIGHT MORE TOMORROW TO MOUNT

00:30:39.961 --> 00:30:42.193
THEIR DEFENSE BUT BECKY DID TAKE
FAR LESS TIME THAN IT APPEARED 

00:30:42.394 --> 00:30:49.031
FOR MORE LET'S GO TO RHONDA 
COLVIN, CAPITAL  HILL REPORTER.

00:30:54.793 --> 00:30:56.793
RHONDA, THIS CAN BE A SHORT 
DEFENSE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

00:30:57.379 --> 00:30:59.379
TEAM TODAY?

00:31:01.294 --> 00:31:03.294
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A VERY SHORT DEFENSE, THEY 
ARE ONLY

00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:11.211
INTERESTED IN FILLING A QUARTER 
OF THE TIME. THE DEMOCRATS 

00:31:11.245 --> 00:31:13.568
DIDN'T USE ALL OF THEIR TIME BUT
THEY CAME CLOSE.

00:31:18.146 --> 00:31:20.146
THEY STRETCHED OUT THEIR 
ARGUMENTS OVER A PERIOD OF TWO 

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.827
DAYS BUT THE DEFENSE SAY THE 
ONLY GOING TO USE MAYBE 3 TO 4 

00:31:23.027 --> 00:31:25.027
HOURS TODAY OF THAT TIME. AT 
THAT HAPPENS THEY COULD 

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:30.341
FORESEEABLY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT 
PART OF THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

00:31:30.745 --> 00:31:33.534
WHICH WILL BE THE QUESTIONS THE 
SENATORS CAN WRITE AND ASK BOTH 

00:31:33.676 --> 00:31:38.662
SIDES. TODAY WERE LIKELY TO HELP
THE TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM GO AFTER 

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:40.989
THIS WAS A FIRST AMENDMENT 
PROTECTION

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:57.147
THAT TRUMP WAS VERY PASSIONATE 
HIS WORDS WERE NOT PART OF THE 

00:31:57.358 --> 00:31:59.593
ACTUAL ACTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE 
HERE ON THE HILL HE WAS JUST 

00:31:59.794 --> 00:32:02.029
GIVING A ROUSING SPEECH MUCH 
LIKE HE DID AT HIS RALLIES. SO 

00:32:02.228 --> 00:32:04.262
THERE'S STILL GOING TO CHIP AWAY
THIS IDEA THAT HE'S PROTECTED 

00:32:04.463 --> 00:32:06.463
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

00:32:09.347 --> 00:32:11.777
CLOSE GO TO JOYCE MORE OF THAT, 
SHE CAN GIVE US INSIGHT INTO 

00:32:11.978 --> 00:32:14.148
EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARGUMENTS 
MIGHT LOOK LIKE TODAY? JOYCE. 

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:18.880
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WILL BE A MUCH SHORTER 
ARGUMENT THAN WE SAW. OVER THE 

00:32:19.094 --> 00:32:23.148
COURSE OF THE PAST TWO DAYS. 
IT'S REP. DAVID CICILLINE, HE 

00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:25.359
SAID THEY WOULD ONLY BE 

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:31.247
SPEAKING FOR FOUR HOURS MAKING 
THOSE ARGUMENTS IN DEFENSE OF 

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.134
TRUMPS CHARGE OF INCITEMENT OF 
INSURRECTION. WE SAW YESTERDAY 

00:32:35.335 --> 00:32:40.217
AS WELL, SOME OF TRUMPS ALLIES 
IN THE SENATE, LINDSEY GRAHAM, 

00:32:40.622 --> 00:32:42.622
TED CRUZ AND MIKE LEE MEETING 
WITH TRUMPS ATTORNEYS BEHIND 

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.516
CLOSED DOORS. FOLLOWING THAT, 
DAVID SCHOEN SAID THEY WERE 

00:32:46.717 --> 00:32:52.402
TALKING  PROCEDURE, HE WASN'T 
TIPPED OFF TO ANY QUESTIONS THEY

00:32:53.163 --> 00:32:55.163
COULD POTENTIALLY

00:32:56.866 --> 00:33:01.349
ASK FOLLOWING THE ARGUMENT. WE 
KNOW THAT READING THAT LEGAL 

00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:05.601
BRIEF THEY FILED BACK ON MONDAY 
AS RHONDA WAS MENTIONING THEY 

00:33:05.814 --> 00:33:11.297
EXPECT THE FRAME TRUMPS WORDS AS
BEING FIGURATIVE AND DEFENDING 

00:33:11.497 --> 00:33:16.981
HIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH YEAR PEER 
THEY ALSO ARE EXPECTED TO 

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.229
SHARPLY CRITICIZE THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AS WELL AS 

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:25.511
OTHER DEMOCRATS, USING THEIR 
WORDS TO DRAW COMPARISON 

00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:28.253
BASICALLY IN THAT LEGAL BRIEF 
THEY TALK ABOUT LAWMAKERS LIKE

00:33:32.628 --> 00:33:34.804
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI AND WHAT 
THEY SAID ABOUT UPRISING, 

00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:41.359
DAVID SCHOEN HAS ALLUDED TO, 
EARLIER THIS WEEK, POTENTIALLY 

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.210
USING VIDEOS OF DEMOCRATS  AND 
THEIR POLITICAL SPEECH ON THE 

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.476
FLOOR OF THE SENATE DURING THEIR
ARGUMENTS. WE KNOW THEY 

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.507
SIGNIFICANTLY CUT BACK THEIR 
ARGUMENT SO THAT COULD HAVE 

00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:55.575
CHANGE. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THAT
WILL BE ONE OF THEIR MAIN 

00:33:55.776 --> 00:33:57.807
PILLARS TO THEIR ARGUMENT IN 
DEFENSE OF TRUMP EARED THE BIG 

00:33:58.021 --> 00:34:02.689
WILDCARD HERE IS BRUCE CASTOR, 
WHO IS TRUMPS OTHER ATTORNEY AND

00:34:02.891 --> 00:34:06.541
MADE HEADLINES ON TUESDAY  AND 
WEDNESDAY MORNING AFTER BACKLASH

00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:08.755
OF CRITICISM FOLLOWING HIS 
DEFENSE

00:34:14.259 --> 00:34:16.291
OF TRUMP WHERE HE RAMBLED AND 
MEANDERED THROUGH A LOT OF 

00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:20.972
POINTS THAT WERE NOT CONNECTED 
BACK TO A STRAIGHT DEFENSE OF 

00:34:21.172 --> 00:34:23.205
TRUMP. SO TODAY WE WILL BE 
SEEING HOW THEIR STRATEGY HAS 

00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:25.405
CHANGED, IF AT ALL,

00:34:28.688 --> 00:34:31.885
HOW MUCH HE GETS A PLATFORM TO 
TALK IF HE SPEAKS JUST AS MUCH 

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:36.406
AS DAVID SCHOEN, WE WILL REALLY 
BE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY 

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.607
HE HAS TO SAY TODAY 

00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:44.708
AND IF HE GIVES SUBSTANTIAL 
ARGUMENTS AS OPPOSED TO RAMBLING

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.740
DEFENSE OF TRUMP. OF COURSE, 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS A VERY 

00:34:47.321 --> 00:34:50.826
POLITICAL PROCESS WILL CERTAINLY
BE LOOKING TO HEAR FROM TRUMPS 

00:34:51.026 --> 00:34:53.556
ATTORNEYS HOW EXACTLY THEY 
DEFEND TRUMP ON HIS USE OF WORDS

00:34:58.756 --> 00:34:59.973
BEFORE THIS JANUARY 6 
INSURRECTION, ESPECIALLY 

00:34:59.974 --> 00:35:01.790
FOLLOWING THE LAST TWO DAYS OF 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:03.791
PRESENTING THIS EVIDENCE-BASED 
DEFENSE

00:35:06.877 --> 00:35:10.730
, ARGUMENT OF TRUMP AND HOW HE 
INCITED VIOLENCE AND HOW THE 

00:35:10.948 --> 00:35:12.948
INSURRECTION US, HIS SUPPORTERS

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:19.259
, HAVE TALKED ABOUT THEIR 
ALLEGIANCE TO TRUMP AS BEING ONE

00:35:19.474 --> 00:35:21.493
OF THEIR MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR 
BEING AT THE CAPITAL THAT THEY. 

00:35:21.707 --> 00:35:24.229
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO JAMES, I'M SO 
GLAD

00:35:29.009 --> 00:35:30.934
JOYCE BROUGHT UP THESE 
REPUBLICANS AND THEIR 

00:35:30.935 --> 00:35:32.935
INVOLVEMENT

00:35:35.308 --> 00:35:38.974
OR COORDINATION OR ADVICE GIVING
TO TRUMP'S LAWYERS. LAST NIGHT 

00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:44.456
WE DID SEE A TRIO OF REPUBLICANS
GO INTO THAT ROOM WHERE TRUMPS 

00:35:44.658 --> 00:35:46.658
ATTORNEYS ARE PREPARING AND 
WORKING, RIGHT?

00:35:51.761 --> 00:35:53.593
TED CRUZ, MIKE LEE, LINDSEY 
GRAHAM. I'M EMPHASIZING THOSE 

00:35:53.594 --> 00:35:55.425
NAMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN 
STAUNCH DEFENDERS OF DONALD 

00:35:55.426 --> 00:35:58.418
TRUMP, THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF 
LEGAL BACKGROUND AND KNOWLEDGE 

00:35:58.562 --> 00:36:00.562
AND

00:36:02.127 --> 00:36:06.193
YOU CAN THINK, WAIT A MINUTE, 
THE JURORS ARE COORDINATING WITH

00:36:06.952 --> 00:36:08.952
THE DEFENSE?

00:36:11.677 --> 00:36:13.910
BUT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 
TRIAL. SO HOW WAS THIS JUSTIFIED

00:36:14.111 --> 00:36:17.560
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, WE SAW THIS A YEAR AGO

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.760
DURING THE LAST TRIAL WHEN

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:25.491
TED CRUZ, WHO WAS NO FRIEND OF 
TRUMP DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN 

00:36:25.693 --> 00:36:28.527
WAS ALSO OFFERING LEGAL ADVICE. 
THIS TIME THE PRESIDENT HIRED 

00:36:28.942 --> 00:36:33.809
FIRST ROUND OF ATTORNEYS BECAUSE
THEY WERE FRIENDS AND ALLIES OF 

00:36:34.023 --> 00:36:37.675
LINDSEY GRAHAM. THESE NEW 
LAWYERS ALSO RECOMMENDED BY SOME

00:36:37.878 --> 00:36:44.248
OF THE SENATORS. THE JURORS HAVE
TAKEN A SACRED OATH TO BE 

00:36:44.385 --> 00:36:49.459
IMPARTIAL IN RENDERING JUSTICE. 
BUT THIS ISN'T OUT OF THE NORM 

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:54.331
DURING THE 90s DEMOCRATS WERE 
GIVING LEGAL ADVICE TO BILL 

00:36:54.531 --> 00:36:56.531
CLINTON'S DEFENSE TEAM

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.059
DURING THAT IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. 
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS WEIRD. WE'RE 

00:37:03.273 --> 00:37:05.273
TOLD THAT TRUMP HIMSELF HAS BEEN
VERY HANDS-ON.

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:11.949
HE PLAYED A ROUND OF GOLF 
YESTERDAY. HE IS FRUSTRATED 

00:37:12.088 --> 00:37:16.060
ABOUT BRUCE CASTOR'S INITIAL 
PERFORMANCE AND HE HAS BEEN 

00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:19.728
CALLING IN  AND BEEN ON THE 
SPEAKER PHONE DURING THESE 

00:37:19.927 --> 00:37:25.545
CONVERSATION REPUBLICAN SENATORS
AND THE LAWYERS AND

00:37:27.442 --> 00:37:29.442
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF.

00:37:34.344 --> 00:37:36.984
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT IS 
THE POINT OF THIS EXERCISE IF WE

00:37:37.195 --> 00:37:39.012
ALREADY KNOW SOME OF THESE 
REPUBLICANS ARE DECIDED THEY 

00:37:39.013 --> 00:37:42.881
DON'T HAVE AN OPEN MIND. THEY 
ARE NOT TAKING THAT CHARGE OF 

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:45.875
COMING OUT THIS AND HEARING ALL 
THE ARGUMENTS AND THEN MAKING A 

00:37:46.053 --> 00:37:48.561
DECISION SERIOUSLY. THIS IS A 
POLITICAL ENDEAVOR. THAT IS THE 

00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:53.556
WAY THIS GOES. BUT WHAT IS THE 
POINT OF THIS PROCESS? 

00:37:53.557 --> 00:37:58.527
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS ABOUT THE COURT OF 
PUBLIC OPINION. THIS IS ABOUT 

00:37:58.725 --> 00:38:00.725
ULTIMATELY HOLDING TRUMP 
ACCOUNTABLE EVEN THOUGH HE IS 

00:38:00.838 --> 00:38:04.085
NOT CONVICTED IN THE EYES OF 
HISTORY. IN THEORY,

00:38:08.062 --> 00:38:10.297
A LOT OF THE REVELATIONS THAT 
HAVE COME OUT ABOUT HIS INACTION

00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:15.381
IN EVERYTHING HE DID TO FOMENT 
WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6 COULD

00:38:15.582 --> 00:38:21.883
MAKE IT HARDER FOR HIM TO RUN IN
2024. THE IRONY IS TED CRUZ HAS 

00:38:22.084 --> 00:38:24.600
ALREADY SAID PUBLICLY HE'S GOING
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024.

00:38:29.601 --> 00:38:32.123
IT IS IRONIC, ONE OF THE UP 
SHOTS OF THIS TRIAL,

00:38:36.305 --> 00:38:38.122
ONE OF THE REASONS DEMOCRATS 
HAVE JUSTIFIED MOVING FORWARD 

00:38:38.123 --> 00:38:40.770
AFTER HE HAS LEFT OFFICE IS THAT
THEY WANT TO MAKE IT SO TRUMP 

00:38:40.971 --> 00:38:45.852
CANNOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN 
IN 2020 4M CAN'T EVEN THREATEN 

00:38:46.053 --> 00:38:49.703
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN A WAY TO
KEEP REPUBLICANS IN LINE AND 

00:38:49.904 --> 00:38:51.904
KEEP THEM MORE TRUMP HE THEN 
CONSERVATIVE.

00:38:55.802 --> 00:38:57.802
THERE IS SOME IRONY THERE 
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT'S GOING TO 

00:38:57.835 --> 00:39:01.086
HAPPEN. BUT REMEMBER THERE ARE 
SIX REPUBLICANS WHO WILL BE 

00:39:01.286 --> 00:39:03.609
VOTING FOR THE TRIAL AND WHO 
SAID IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.621
IF THOSE SIX OR EVEN A HANDFUL 
OF THEM VOTE TO CONVICT THIS 

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.997
WILL BE THE MOST BIPARTISAN 
IMPEACHMENT BOAT IN AMERICAN 

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.140
HISTORY.

00:39:23.019 --> 00:39:25.867
ONE TO WATCH IS A REPUBLICAN WHO
DID SITE, THAT'S A SWITCH. HOW 

00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:33.786
WE VOTED WEEKS AGO. HE TOLD 
REPORTERS HE WANTS ANSWERED BY 

00:39:34.547 --> 00:39:36.547
TRUMP'S LAWYERS.

00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:42.926
WHY DID TRUMP NOT TELL THE 
RIOTERS TO STOP OR CONDEMN THE 

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.125
ACCOUNT ATTACKS ON POLICE?

00:39:48.007 --> 00:39:50.239
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HEAR THE POLICE OFFICERS 
AND SAY RIGHT FLANK. LET'S GO 

00:39:50.439 --> 00:39:54.505
BACK, OFFICER 50. PANIC STRICKEN
VOICE. THEY ARE USING WEAPONS ON

00:39:54.705 --> 00:40:00.401
US, BEAR SPRAY. THE PRESIDENT 
WAS CALLING TO TRY AND GET MORE 

00:40:00.602 --> 00:40:02.602
SENATORS TO DECERTIFY THE 
ELECTION.

00:40:05.673 --> 00:40:07.709
NOW PRESUMABLY SINCE WE WERE AT 
THAT POINT BEING EVACUATED. I 

00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:12.328
THINK HE WAS TOLD THAT, THERE 
WAS SOME AWARENESS OF THE 

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:18.270
EVENTS. I HOPE THE DEFENSE 
EXPLAINS THAT. 

00:40:18.271 --> 00:40:21.407
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT SENATOR CASSIDY SPEAKING
TO REPORTERS YESTERDAY.

00:40:28.624 --> 00:40:30.624
RHONDA COLVIN, WHAT DOES THE 
DEFENSE TEAM DO WITH THE 

00:40:30.655 --> 00:40:33.505
QUESTION LIKE THAT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  THE IMPEACHMENT 

00:40:33.706 --> 00:40:36.358
MANAGER, REP. JAMIE RASKIN SAID 
HE HAS A SET OF  OPTIONS FOR THE

00:40:36.555 --> 00:40:38.555
DEFENSE GO AFTER TODAY.

00:40:41.421 --> 00:40:43.656
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHY TRUMP 
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR A SERIES 

00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:47.723
OF HOURS THAT HE WAS AWARE THERE
WAS DANGER AT THE CAPITAL WHEN 

00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:50.367
HE WAS AWARE OF THE INSURRECTION
US HAD COME IN AND LICE RED 

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.422
DANGER AND HE DID NOT DO 
ANYTHING. REP. JAMIE RASKIN SAID

00:40:54.636 --> 00:40:57.270
THAT IS THE TOP OF THIS LIST THE
THINGS HE WANTS THE DEFENSE GO 

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.456
AFTER.  THAT ARGUMENT ANNA PEELS
SEEMS TO BE WORKING WITH 

00:41:00.596 --> 00:41:04.788
SOMEBODY LIKE BILL CASSIDY 
THERE. FINDING OUT WHY THE 

00:41:04.987 --> 00:41:07.836
PRESIDENT HAD KNOWLEDGE, AFTER 
THERE IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION 

00:41:08.037 --> 00:41:10.037
HE DID NOT CALL THINGS OUT.

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:16.939
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN 

00:41:16.971 --> 00:41:19.005
YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE. 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WANTED TO 

00:41:19.205 --> 00:41:21.205
PRESENT. IF ANYTHING AFTER THINK
ABOUT PERSONAL SAFETY HE COULD 

00:41:21.238 --> 00:41:25.709
DO IT AGAIN. HE DID NOT ACT WHEN
HE KNEW ABOUT THESE THINGS AND 

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:30.940
HE LATER ON OUT OF VIDEO SAYING 
TO GO HOME SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN

00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:33.084
THE

00:41:34.843 --> 00:41:37.496
RIOTS SITE THE VIDEO SAID OKAY 
WE WON LET'S GO HOME. A LOT OF 

00:41:37.693 --> 00:41:40.288
PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF THE 
DEFENSE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AT 

00:41:40.428 --> 00:41:46.430
ALL. OR IF THEY WON'T DO THAT AT
ALL AND WHAT THEY WILL ADDRESS 

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.350
TODAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE OTHER QUESTION THAT 

00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:52.005
SENATOR CASSIDY ASKED IS HE 
CONTINUED TO

00:41:57.798 --> 00:41:59.798
PUT FORWARD THE LIEN HE WASN'T 
ACCEPTING THE RESULTS. HIS 

00:41:59.832 --> 00:42:01.662
CONSTITUENTS BACK IN LOUISIANA 
STILL DON'T BELIEVE THE ELECTION

00:42:01.663 --> 00:42:06.332
WAS FREE AND THERE BECAUSE IN 
PART, TRUMP IS PERPETUATING THAT

00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:09.180
LIE AND HE TIED IT IN WITH THOSE
VOTING MACHINES AND WE KNOW THAT

00:42:09.386 --> 00:42:11.616
IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE RIGHT 
NOW BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT 

00:42:11.816 --> 00:42:13.816
OWNED THE VOTING MACHINES ARE 
FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST

00:42:18.114 --> 00:42:20.114
FOX NEWS, SOME OF THE NEWS 
ANCHORS BECAUSE OF THE 

00:42:20.147 --> 00:42:25.230
FALSEHOODS THEY CONTINUE TO 
PERPETUATE. SO CASSIDY WANTS TO 

00:42:25.431 --> 00:42:28.681
KNOW THAT ANSWER ALSO. I WOULD 
LOVE TO HEAR YOUR ANALYSIS OF 

00:42:29.083 --> 00:42:31.877
HOW THE DEFENSE DEALS WITH THIS 
QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE 

00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:34.980
ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SHOWS YOU THAT 

00:42:35.582 --> 00:42:37.582
MISINFORMATION IS ENDURING.

00:42:41.882 --> 00:42:44.115
EVEN AFTER THE COURT SYSTEM HAS 
ADDRESSED THIS WAS A VERY FAIR 

00:42:44.317 --> 00:42:47.366
AND EQUAL ELECTION THERE IS 
STILL BELIEF THAT BECAUSE OF 

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.689
WHAT TRUMP HAS SAID IN HIS 
SUPPORTERS AND WHOLE

00:42:53.464 --> 00:42:55.496
STOP THE STEEL MOVEMENT IT 
WASN'T A FAIR ELECTION. SO BILL 

00:42:55.697 --> 00:42:57.697
CASSIDY IS BRINGING UP AN 
EXCELLENT POINT IN TALKING ABOUT

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:03.815
WHAT WAS CORE OF THIS CASE IS 
THAT THE RHETORIC ON JANUARY 6 

00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:06.409
WAS A PART OF LONG-STANDING 
RHETORIC THAT ACTUALLY WAS TEED 

00:43:06.554 --> 00:43:08.554
UP

00:43:12.145 --> 00:43:14.377
WEEKS, IF NOT MONTHS BEFORE THE 
EVENTS OF JANUARY 6. SO THE 

00:43:14.578 --> 00:43:16.612
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SHOWED A 
LOT OF EVIDENCE. HOW WE 

00:43:16.826 --> 00:43:22.308
CONTINUOUSLY SAID THE ELECTION 
WAS A FRAUD AND HOW THAT LED TO 

00:43:22.508 --> 00:43:24.942
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6. IT IS A
CORE PART OF THIS WHOLE 

00:43:25.706 --> 00:43:27.991
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THIS 
INFORMATION MISINFORMATION THAT 

00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:31.858
JUST KEEPS GETTING PADDLE AND 
NOT ADDRESS AND CULMINATED IN 

00:43:32.058 --> 00:43:34.490
WHAT WE SAW ON THE SIX. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LIKE TO HEAR YOUR WAY 

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.690
IN ON THIS TOO.

00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:48.309
TO HAVE HIM NOT ONLY SAY THAT 
THE ELECTION WAS LOST BY DONALD 

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:54.607
TRUMP BUT HE IS REALLY BATTLING 
THIS BACK HOME IN LOUISIANA. WE 

00:43:54.808 --> 00:43:58.258
KNOW THAT BASED ON POLLING 
INFORMATION, A LOT OF 

00:43:58.461 --> 00:44:00.461
REPUBLICANS STILL DON'T BELIEVE 
THAT

00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:05.541
JOE BIDEN WON THE ELECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION, 

00:44:05.572 --> 00:44:09.026
LIBBY, THAT'S THE OTHER REASON 
TO HOLD THIS TRIAL TO ESTABLISH 

00:44:09.784 --> 00:44:11.784
THAT CLEARLY.

00:44:14.097 --> 00:44:15.926
ONE OF THE THINGS, DEMOCRATS 
WARNED ABOUT YESTERDAY, BECAUSE 

00:44:15.927 --> 00:44:17.927
A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS

00:44:21.008 --> 00:44:25.879
ON SO MANY AMERICANS, DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE EXTREMISTS BELIEVE THAT

00:44:26.091 --> 00:44:28.925
BIDEN IS THE LEGITIMATE BECAUSE 
TRUMP SPENT SO MANY MONTHS 

00:44:29.341 --> 00:44:31.927
SOWING THOSE DOUBTS THEY ARE 
MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE ON VIOLENT

00:44:32.067 --> 00:44:34.346
CONDUCT. AND

00:44:38.277 --> 00:44:40.308
REP. JAMIE RASKIN CLOSE WITH 
FOUR QUESTIONS HE HAD FOR THE 

00:44:40.509 --> 00:44:45.676
DEFENSE TEAMS.  WHAT WAS TRUMP 
DOING DURING THESE HOURS.

00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:55.139
DOZENS OF PEOPLE RESIGNED 
BECAUSE THEY WERE UPSET ABOUT 

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.140
THE TRUMP RESPONSE

00:45:04.475 --> 00:45:07.007
THE LINE IT FALLEN IN THE 
CAPITAL HAVE BEEN BREACHED. 

00:45:07.008 --> 00:45:13.164
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; INVESTIGATOR REPORTER, 
ROSLYN. WE KNOW THAT TRUMPS 

00:45:13.303 --> 00:45:15.303
DEFENSE

00:45:17.682 --> 00:45:20.317
TEAM WILL ARGUE THAT THE PRESENT
HAS A RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. SO I

00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:22.754
LIKE TO PLAY FOR YOU A CLIP, 
THIS IS REP. JAMIE RASKIN 

00:45:22.966 --> 00:45:26.689
REJECTING THAT LINE  LET'S 
WATCH. 

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.690
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:45:32.515 --> 00:45:34.639
TRUMPS BRAZEN EVENT WON'T HOLD 
UP IN ANY WAY.

00:45:41.248 --> 00:45:43.268
OF COURSE IT COMPLETELY IGNORES 
THE FACT THAT HE WAS THE 

00:45:43.481 --> 00:45:45.514
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. HE SWEARS AN 

00:45:45.713 --> 00:45:47.713
OATH AS PRESIDENT THAT NOBODY 
ELSE SWEARS

00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:53.832
IN EXCHANGE SHE'S GIVEN GREATER 
POWERS THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE 

00:45:54.045 --> 00:45:59.518
ENTIRE COUNTRY OR OWNER APPEARED
HERE SHE PROMISES TO PRESERVE, 

00:45:59.732 --> 00:46:01.732
PROTECT AND DEFEND THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 

00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:03.851
STATES

00:46:05.415 --> 00:46:08.413
AND AS WE ALL KNOW, THE POWER WE
ENTRUST. PEOPLE IN PUBLIC 

00:46:08.555 --> 00:46:13.133
OFFICE. ESPECIALLY PRESIDENTS 
COME WITH SPECIAL OBLIGATIONS TO

00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:15.474
UPHOLD THE LAWS OF THE INTEGRITY
OF OUR REPUBLIC.

00:46:20.035 --> 00:46:22.035
THERE'S NOTHING REMOTELY EXOTIC 
ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING, SHOULD

00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:24.069
BE COMMON SENSE TO EVERYBODY.

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:31.586
ABOUT THIS UNDERSTANDING THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT AS IT APPLIES TO

00:46:31.625 --> 00:46:32.636
PUBLIC SERVANTS, COPS, 
FIREFIGHTERS, TEACHERS, 

00:46:32.637 --> 00:46:35.375
EVERYBODY ACROSS THE LAND. MY 
DAUGHTER WHO I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:46:35.886 --> 00:46:40.753
, SHE IS A TEACHER IN PUBLIC 
SCHOOL, SHE SAID TEACHERS TEACH 

00:46:40.966 --> 00:46:46.401
BUT IF THEY GO OFF SPEECH AND 
START ADVOCATING TOTALITARIANISM

00:46:46.544 --> 00:46:52.334
TREASON OR WHAT HAVE YOU THEY 
ARE NOT LIVING UP TO THEIR 

00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:54.863
OFFICES TEACHER THEY CAN BE 
FIRED, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

00:47:02.499 --> 00:47:04.518
SO ROSLYN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH ARGUMENT. 

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:07.035
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  THAT WAS A REALLY 
INTERESTING ARGUMENT THAT

00:47:12.651 --> 00:47:14.651
REP. JAMIE RASKIN MADE, HE'S 
MAKING IT REAL AND VISCERAL 

00:47:14.683 --> 00:47:16.299
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRIMINAL 
TRIAL AN IMPEACHMENT  

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.633
ESSENTIALLY LIKENING IMPEACHMENT
KIND OF YOUR JOB PERFORMANCE

00:47:22.194 --> 00:47:24.194
YOUR EMPLOYMENT SITUATION WHEN 
YOU ARE A TEACHER

00:47:30.325 --> 00:47:32.762
NOBODY'S GOING TO PUT A TEACHER 
WHO GOES OFF SCRIPT IN JAIL FOR 

00:47:32.959 --> 00:47:35.607
THAT. BUT THERE IS AN AGREEMENT 
THAT HE OR SHE DOES NOT HAVE A 

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.040
RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT 
TO IN THE CLASSROOM AND THEY 

00:47:38.241 --> 00:47:40.241
COULD BE FIRED FOR IT.

00:47:43.524 --> 00:47:45.524
THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM CRIMINAL 
INSURRECTION AND CRIME

00:47:50.427 --> 00:47:52.427
WHICH THERE MIGHT BE A FIRST 
AMENDMENT DEFENSE. WHAT IS 

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.290
HAPPENING HERE IN THE 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, I WOULD BE 

00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:58.358
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE 
DEFENSE DOES WITH THAT LINE OF 

00:47:58.564 --> 00:48:00.591
ARGUMENT. MY BEST EXPECTATION AS
THEY WILL LARGELY JUST IGNORE IT

00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:05.874
AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE 
THE ARGUMENT THAT LOOK, THE 

00:48:06.078 --> 00:48:08.458
SUPREME COURT HAS PUT A VERY 
HIGH STANDARD OF WHAT 

00:48:08.596 --> 00:48:10.596
INSURRECTION

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.792
, FREE-SPEECH PROTECTIONS AND 
WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROVE IN 

00:48:13.993 --> 00:48:15.993
A COURT OF LAW

00:48:18.876 --> 00:48:21.110
TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE INSIDE IT 
VIOLENCE. IF YOU LOOK AT TRUMPS 

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.744
SPEECH THAT DAY IT DOESN'T MEET 
THAT BAR. THAT IS SORT OF WHAT 

00:48:23.944 --> 00:48:25.944
I'M EXPECTING TO HEAR.

00:48:30.043 --> 00:48:32.613
IT'S BESIDE THE POINT, THAT'S 
NOT THE STANDARD WE USE IN 

00:48:32.756 --> 00:48:35.219
IMPEACHMENT WERE NOT TRYING TO 
PUT HIM IN JAIL,

00:48:39.181 --> 00:48:42.122
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET HIM 
CONVICTED BY THE SENATE IN A WAY

00:48:43.449 --> 00:48:45.684
YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD 
PUBLIC OFFICE IN THE FUTURE 

00:48:45.885 --> 00:48:47.885
THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING.

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:55.637
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK TO RHONDA, WE 
HEARD THE PRE-A BOTTLE YESTERDAY

00:48:55.837 --> 00:48:58.485
AND WE ARE WATCHING THE TRUMP 
ATTORNEYS ARRIVED THERE RIGHT 

00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:03.915
NOW AND GET PHOTOGRAPH. IS 
ROSALYN POINTS OUT IT'S NOT LIKE

00:49:04.061 --> 00:49:08.715
THE TEAM HAS TO TACKLE EVERY 
POINT THAT WAS RAISED.

00:49:11.884 --> 00:49:14.280
REALLY HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
THAT SENATOR CASSIDY IS BROUGHT 

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.460
UP. WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE 
TO DO TODAY

00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:26.102
THERE IS WINNING THE ARGUMENT 
BUT THEN THERE IS WINNING THE 

00:49:26.303 --> 00:49:29.553
JURY. HAPPENS IN THIS CASE THERE
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. 

00:49:29.554 --> 00:49:32.401
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  WHAT THEY HAVE TO 
DO AND WHAT THEY WILL DO ARE TWO

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:36.052
DIFFERENT THINGS.  I THINK TO 
THE POINT JUST RAISED, YOU MIGHT

00:49:36.268 --> 00:49:38.268
SUSPECT IF YOU HAVE READ THEIR 
BRIEF THAT

00:49:42.152 --> 00:49:44.586
THEY ARE GOING TO STICK TO WHAT 
THEY BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG THIS 

00:49:44.787 --> 00:49:46.787
IS A FREE-SPEECH CASE. EVEN 
THOUGH

00:49:49.868 --> 00:49:51.903
REP. JAMIE RASKIN AND THE OTHER 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS THAT HE IS 

00:49:52.104 --> 00:49:56.168
NOT PROTECTED UNDER FREE SPEECH.
ON TOP OF THAT  HE ALSO TAKES A 

00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:58.404
SEPARATE OATH FROM AN EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER WHERE HE IS SUPPOSED TO 

00:49:58.602 --> 00:50:02.541
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION. IF YOU 
LOOK WHAT JANUARY 6 WAS, THAT 

00:50:02.682 --> 00:50:07.337
WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL ACT. THEY 
HAD TO CERTIFY THE ELECTION IT 

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.537
HAPPENS EVERY PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION

00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:14.657
CYCLE SO THAT WAS AN ACT OF THE 
CONSTITUTION HE DID NOT DEFEND 

00:50:14.859 --> 00:50:18.513
AND INSTEAD TRY TO INTERRUPT. SO
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS BY 

00:50:18.713 --> 00:50:23.179
LEAVING THAT ALL ON THE TABLE 
THERE YESTERDAY. THEY REALLY 

00:50:23.392 --> 00:50:25.826
WANTED TO PUT THE DEFENSE TEAM 
IN A CORNER SAYING YOU NEED TO 

00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:28.026
ADDRESS THESE THINGS

00:50:30.693 --> 00:50:32.728
AND NOT JUST ARGUING THAT IS 
FREE SPEECH OR THE OTHER 

00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:38.020
ARGUMENT THEY MAY BE BRINGING UP
THAT THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 

00:50:38.444 --> 00:50:40.468
REP. JAMIE RASKIN SAID DON'T 
BRING THAT UP BECAUSE WE ALREADY

00:50:40.669 --> 00:50:43.307
VOTED AND PASSED THAT THIS IS 
CONSTITUTIONAL.  THE SENATE HAS 

00:50:43.508 --> 00:50:46.101
JURISDICTION TO GO FORWARD WITH 
THIS SO YOU CAN'T BRING THAT 

00:50:46.238 --> 00:50:51.437
APPEARED THEY WANT THE DEFENSE 
TO BRING UP THINGS THAT ARE 

00:50:51.638 --> 00:50:53.638
CONNECTED TO MATERIALS THAT HAVE
BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE 

00:50:54.071 --> 00:50:56.104
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. WE DON'T 
KNOW YET IF THEY WILL DO THOSE 

00:50:56.304 --> 00:50:58.749
THINGS BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS 
THEY SHOULD DO IF THEY WANT TO 

00:50:58.949 --> 00:51:03.820
MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 

00:51:04.034 --> 00:51:06.344
SAYING HE DID AND WHAT THEY ARE 
DEFENDING HIM AGAINST.

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:12.151
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES HOHMANN, IT'S ALMOST 
THE CHARGE WITH THE ATTORNEYS DO

00:51:12.354 --> 00:51:16.422
NO HARM  BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
ALREADY WON THE JURY AS FAR WE 

00:51:16.622 --> 00:51:19.260
CAN TELL. WE ARE NOT SEEING IT 
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH NUMBER OF 

00:51:19.463 --> 00:51:21.463
REPUBLICANS TO CHANGE THE 
OUTCOME HERE.

00:51:27.795 --> 00:51:29.625
AS WE ARE WATCHING 
PHOTOGRAPHERS, HAD A LITTLE BIT 

00:51:29.626 --> 00:51:31.860
OF I WAS AFRAID FOR A MOMENT 
FRANKLY. I COULD SEE PEOPLE 

00:51:32.062 --> 00:51:34.496
RUNNING OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY 
EYE AT THE CAPITOL. I WASN'T 

00:51:34.696 --> 00:51:37.143
EVEN THERE AT THE CAPITOL ON 
THAT DAY. BUT WE ARE ALL STILL 

00:51:37.905 --> 00:51:41.396
REALLY JUMPY. WE'RE ALL RELIVING
WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW HORRIBLE 

00:51:42.148 --> 00:51:46.679
THAT WAS. WHEN I CAUGHT A 
GLIMPSE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY 

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.629
EYE, PEOPLE WITH GEAR SPRINTING 
IT HAS A NEW MEANING FOR ME

00:51:54.396 --> 00:51:57.043
THAN IT DID A MONTH AND A HALF 
AGO, JAMES. I JUST WANTED TO 

00:51:57.245 --> 00:52:02.728
POINT THAT OUT. BECAUSE THE 
BAGGAGE EVERYONE IS DEALING WITH

00:52:02.928 --> 00:52:05.376
THE STILL FRONT AND CENTER EVEN 
IF WE TALK ABOUT AND ARGUE THESE

00:52:05.576 --> 00:52:07.409
FINER POINTS OF WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT X 

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.410
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AMERICA CERTAINLY LOST SOME 
OF THEIR

00:52:13.295 --> 00:52:15.928
INNOCENCE ON JANUARY 6. THIS IS 
OUR TEMPLE OF DEMOCRACY THAT WAS

00:52:16.144 --> 00:52:21.014
DESECRATED. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT 
WAS UNNERVING. BUT ONCE CASTOR 

00:52:21.215 --> 00:52:23.803
REALIZED PHOTOGRAPHERS HAD RUN 
TO GET IN FRONT OF THEM, HE 

00:52:23.939 --> 00:52:25.939
STOPPED

00:52:29.144 --> 00:52:31.165
AND THEN MADE A SHOW OF 
MARVELING THE CAPITOL DOME AND 

00:52:31.365 --> 00:52:33.613
THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND KIND OF 
CHANGE HIS POSTURE TO FINISH 

00:52:33.814 --> 00:52:35.633
WALKING INTO THE BUILDING 
KNOWING THAT HE WAS BEING 

00:52:35.634 --> 00:52:40.113
PHOTOGRAPH WHICH IS KIND OF A 
FUNNY THING, THIS IS A LAWYER 

00:52:40.314 --> 00:52:43.147
WHO IS KNOWN IN THE PHILADELPHIA
MEDIA MARKET BUT WORKS IN A FIRM

00:52:43.897 --> 00:52:50.265
OF TRIAL LAWYERS, SLIP AND FALL 
ACCIDENT TYPE 

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.196
REPRESENTING THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

00:52:59.197 --> 00:53:01.689
HE'S NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE BUT 
HE WAS ALSO HAMMING IT UP FOR 

00:53:01.889 --> 00:53:03.889
ONE OF THE CAMERAS.

00:53:07.775 --> 00:53:09.405
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THEY 

00:53:09.406 --> 00:53:11.911
REALLY BUILT THIS CASE. TO SHOW 
A PATTERN OF SPEECH,

00:53:16.314 --> 00:53:18.314
NOT ONLY CONDONING BUT INCITING 
AND REVELING IN VIOLENCE LEADING

00:53:18.356 --> 00:53:20.356
UP TO JANUARY 6.

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:26.071
THAT IS A DEFENSE TEAM TACKLE 
THAT? DO THEY JUST FOCUS ON 

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:29.950
JANUARY 6 AND TRY TO MAKE A 
DIRECT DEFENSE OF HIS LANGUAGE 

00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:32.293
ON THAT DAY AND THE ATTACK ON 
THE CAPITAL?

00:53:36.874 --> 00:53:39.105
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  I DON'T KNOW THE 
ANSWER TO THAT. I'M INTERESTED 

00:53:39.306 --> 00:53:42.971
TO SEE IT. I DO THINK  THEY ARE 
GOING TO FOCUS MUCH MORE OF 

00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:48.039
THEIR CASE ON THE SPEECH THAT 
DAY. RATHER ON THE REST OF THE 

00:53:48.253 --> 00:53:52.720
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CASE 
EVERYTHING THAT LED UP TO IT. I 

00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.491
THINK THAT THE PROBLEM WITH 
THEIR OWN CLIENT IN HOW YOU 

00:53:55.633 --> 00:53:59.420
ADDRESS THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT
WAS SAYING PRIOR TO JANUARY 6 

00:53:59.622 --> 00:54:05.109
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT TRUMP 
STILL BELIEVES TO THIS DAY THAT 

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:07.743
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN. HE 
STILL BELIEVES IN HIS OWN LIE. 

00:54:07.956 --> 00:54:10.072
THERE'VE BEEN SOME REPORTING 
THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO

00:54:14.858 --> 00:54:17.293
HEAR HIS LAWYERS PRESS THAT CASE
ON THE FLOOR SO THAT'S A TRICKY 

00:54:17.494 --> 00:54:21.368
SITUATION FOR THEM. THE ONE 
THOUGHT I DID HAVE YESTERDAY IN 

00:54:21.566 --> 00:54:25.151
WATCHING THE PRESENTATION THAT 
WAS GIVEN, WENT BACK TO THE 2016

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.290
CAMPAIGN.

00:54:31.719 --> 00:54:32.935
COMMENTS, THROUGH 
CHARLOTTESVILLE UP UNTIL THE 

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.936
PRESENT IS THAT

00:54:39.036 --> 00:54:41.264
PERHAPS THE DEFENSE TEAM WILL 
USE SOME OF THAT FOR AN ARGUMENT

00:54:41.466 --> 00:54:43.466
WE DID HERE IN THE OPENING 
REMARKS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY 

00:54:43.497 --> 00:54:45.807
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO 
TRUMP FROM THE START AND

00:54:50.197 --> 00:54:52.433
LOOK AT THEM, THEY ARE REACHING 
BACK TO THE 2016 CAMPAIGN AND 

00:54:52.633 --> 00:54:54.465
THEIR REVISITING THINGS THEY 
TALKED ABOUT 1 MILLION TIMES 

00:54:54.466 --> 00:54:57.397
BEFORE AS PART OF THIS CASE. AS 
A LOGICAL MATTER I'M NOT SURE

00:55:01.166 --> 00:55:02.995
THAT IS A SUPER EFFECTIVE 
ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE HOUSE 

00:55:02.996 --> 00:55:07.263
MANAGERS DID PRESENT A TIGHT 
CASE FOR WHY THEY WERE BRINGING 

00:55:07.464 --> 00:55:09.700
THOSE THINGS UP, WHY THEY 
MATTERED NOW BUT I COULD SEE A 

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.172
LITTLE BIT OF THIS ARGUMENT THAT
THEY HAVE WANTED TO IMPEACH 

00:55:14.379 --> 00:55:16.379
TRUMP SINCE THE DAY HE TOOK 
OFFICE.

00:55:19.878 --> 00:55:22.112
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
YOUR STORY AND THE MOUNTING 

00:55:22.313 --> 00:55:24.313
EVIDENCE EMERGING INDICATING 
THAT TRUMP MAY HAVE AND 

00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:28.813
PERSONALLY INFORMED THAT VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS IN 

00:55:29.015 --> 00:55:30.632
PHYSICAL DANGER DURING THE 
CAPITAL SIEGE. JUST MOMENTS 

00:55:30.633 --> 00:55:34.698
BEFORE DENIGRATING HIM ON 
TWITTER. CAN YOU WALKER VIEWERS 

00:55:34.901 --> 00:55:36.901
THROUGH THE TIMELINE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:55:42.628 --> 00:55:44.863
I THINK TO THE CASSIDY COMMENT 
YOU PLAYED EARLIER ONE OF THE 

00:55:45.063 --> 00:55:47.063
BIGGEST VULNERABILITIES, WE HAVE
HEARD THIS FROM REPUBLICANS ON 

00:55:47.431 --> 00:55:50.546
THE HILL, DESPITE THE FACT WE 
DON'T THINK THE OUTCOME IS IN 

00:55:50.748 --> 00:55:52.378
DOUBT THERE IS GRAVE CONCERN 
AMONGST REPUBLICANS ABOUT 

00:55:52.379 --> 00:55:54.379
TRUMP'S ACTIONS ON THAT DAY.

00:55:57.661 --> 00:55:59.895
WE DID A STORY EARLIER IN THE 
WEEK ABOUT HOW HIS DEFENSE 

00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:01.915
ATTORNEYS ARE NOW TRYING TO 
CLAIM HE WAS IMMEDIATELY 

00:56:01.916 --> 00:56:04.566
HORRIFIED BY THE VIOLENCE AND 
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF PUBLIC 

00:56:04.766 --> 00:56:10.047
EVIDENCE AND PRIVATE REPORTING 
THAT SHOWS THAT JUST ISN'T TRUE.

00:56:10.248 --> 00:56:13.298
THIS MORNING WE FOCUSED ON THIS 
KEY MOMENT THAT HAPPENS AS THE 

00:56:13.497 --> 00:56:15.497
RIOTERS ARE BREAKING INTO THE 
BUILDING,

00:56:21.014 --> 00:56:23.047
THE HOUSE AND SENATE SESSIONS TO
COUNT THE VOTES ARE HALTED 

00:56:23.247 --> 00:56:26.497
BECAUSE THERE ARE NOW RIOTERS IN
THE BUILDING AND VICE PRESIDENT 

00:56:26.697 --> 00:56:31.377
MIKE PENCE IS SPIRITED OFF BY 
SECURITY. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, 

00:56:31.578 --> 00:56:33.578
THAT HAPPENS IT 2:13 PM.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.714
AT 2:24 PM, DONALD TRUMP TWEETS 
THE PENCE LACKED COURAGE AND USA

00:56:41.478 --> 00:56:43.478
DEMANDS TRUTH.

00:56:49.447 --> 00:56:51.894
SO THE MORE HE KNEW IN THAT 
MOMENT ABOUT THE PERIL HIS OWN 

00:56:52.094 --> 00:56:54.328
VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN AT THAT 
VERY MOMENT, THE WORSE IT LOOKS 

00:56:54.528 --> 00:56:56.961
FOR HIM IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS 
TWEETING, POTENTIALLY TRYING TO 

00:56:57.176 --> 00:57:00.425
INFLAME THE MOB FORWARD. OUR 
REPORTING SHOWS THAT HE 

00:57:01.185 --> 00:57:04.837
CERTAINLY KNEW THAT THE VICE 
PRESIDENT HAD JUST BEEN 

00:57:04.974 --> 00:57:06.974
EVACUATED

00:57:09.358 --> 00:57:12.205
FROM THE FLOOR. FIRST OF ALL, WE
ALL KIND OF KNEW THAT, IT WAS ON

00:57:12.406 --> 00:57:14.522
TELEVISION. WE ALSO BELIEVE IT 
IS HIGHLY LIKELY GIVING

00:57:21.755 --> 00:57:23.572
TYPICAL PRACTICE HE WOULD'VE 
BEEN INFORMED BY THE SECRET 

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.573
SERVICE. MIKE PENCE HAD SECRET 
SERVICE AROUND HIM. THEY WERE 

00:57:25.606 --> 00:57:28.455
INVOLVED IN THAT MOMENT AND THEY
WOULD'VE TOLD THEIR COUNTER 

00:57:28.856 --> 00:57:30.890
PARTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT 
THAT. AND THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE 

00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:36.992
IN A PHONE CALL THAT TRUMP 
INTENDED TO REACH A SENATOR FROM

00:57:37.192 --> 00:57:40.182
ALABAMA, HE CALLED MIKE LEE OF 
UTAH. HE SAID HE HANDED OVER HIS

00:57:40.321 --> 00:57:47.138
PHONE, WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT 
TIME OF THE CALL. BUT THE 

00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:52.221
SENATOR FROM ALABAMA ENDED WITH 
TELLING DONALD TRUMP, MIKE PENCE

00:57:52.422 --> 00:57:55.672
WAS JUST PULLED OUT OF FEAR, 
I'VE GOT TO GO. AND SO WE KNOW, 

00:57:55.873 --> 00:58:00.540
IN A PHONE CALL THAT EITHER 
HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE OR MAYBE 

00:58:00.755 --> 00:58:06.438
RIGHT AFTER HE TWEETS, HE IS 
TOLD BY THE SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.569
WHY THEY ARE ON THE SCENE OF 
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MIKE PENCE.

00:58:13.696 --> 00:58:15.696
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MIGHT

00:58:20.456 --> 00:58:22.491
PENCE HAS TALKED MULTIPLE TIMES 
TO DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVEN'T SEEN

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.543
THE TWO OF THEM PUBLICLY 
INTERACT. HE HAS NO PLANS TO 

00:58:26.744 --> 00:58:28.744
CONDEMN TRUMP IN ANY WAY.

00:58:31.823 --> 00:58:34.148
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FOR A LOT OF REPUBLICANS, THE
WAY THAT TRUMP

00:58:37.723 --> 00:58:39.961
TREATED MIKE PENCE IS THE THING 
THAT'S HARDEST FOR THEM TO GET 

00:58:40.157 --> 00:58:42.593
PAST TO JUST LOOK OVER. THERE IS
A NEW ARTICLE OUT THIS MORNING 

00:58:42.794 --> 00:58:46.042
WITH A LONG INTERVIEW WITH NIKKI
HALEY TALKING ABOUT HOW UPSET 

00:58:46.255 --> 00:58:48.255
SHE WAS ABOUT THAT.

00:58:55.252 --> 00:58:57.422
THE FACT THAT HE PUT HIS OWN 
VICE PRESIDENT, WHO HAD BEEN 

00:58:57.622 --> 00:58:59.622
INCREDIBLY LOYAL, AND PHYSICAL 
DANGER AND THEN DID VERY LITTLE 

00:58:59.655 --> 00:59:01.689
TO TRY TO HELP THEM, NEVER 
CALLED HIM IN THOSE MOMENTS. 

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:06.973
THAT IS HARD TO LOOK PAST. OUR 
REPORTING, PARKER AND OUR 

00:59:07.178 --> 00:59:09.178
COLLEAGUES, JOSH AND OTHERS,

00:59:13.674 --> 00:59:15.503
THEIR REPORTING WAS THAT PEOPLE 
AROUND MIKE PENCE WERE 

00:59:15.504 --> 00:59:17.504
INFURIATED, VERY ANGRY WITH 
TRUMP AROUND THE APPEARED AND 

00:59:17.885 --> 00:59:21.794
THAT MIKE PENCE WAS VERY ANGRY 
AT THE START. WE SAW THAT NEW 

00:59:21.995 --> 00:59:24.240
VIDEO THIS WEEK OF HIM BEING 
PULLED OUT OF THE HIDEAWAY JUST 

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:29.309
OFF THE SENATE FLOOR WITH HIS 
FAMILY. YOU HAVE A REAL VISCERAL

00:59:29.522 --> 00:59:35.207
SENSE OF THE DANGER THEY WERE IN
THAT DAY. OUR REPORTING IS HE 

00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:37.840
WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN IT HAPPENED.
THE TWO OF THEM WENT FIVE DAYS 

00:59:38.043 --> 00:59:40.043
WITHOUT SPEAKING AFTER THE 
INSURRECTION WHICH IS QUITE 

00:59:40.177 --> 00:59:42.177
SURPRISING.

00:59:46.572 --> 00:59:48.604
THERE WAS A MEETING, LET'S CLEAR
THE AIR MEETING THAT WAS 

00:59:48.819 --> 00:59:52.871
SCHEDULED IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
BEFORE DONALD TRUMP LEFT OFFICE 

00:59:53.287 --> 00:59:55.320
THE SOME DESCRIBE AS STILTED AND
DIFFICULT BUT LENGTHY WHERE THEY

00:59:55.519 --> 00:59:59.573
SORT OF CLEAR THE AIR. AND THAT 
MIKE PENCE HAS NOW SPOKEN TO 

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:04.053
TRUMP SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THE 
INSURRECTION. WE KNOW THAT MIKE 

01:00:04.255 --> 01:00:06.255
PENCE IS INTERESTED IN HAVING A 
POLITICAL FUTURE.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.375
HE MAY WELL LIKELY WANT TO RUN 
FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024. SO LIKE 

01:00:12.578 --> 01:00:15.224
THE REST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
IS GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE OF 

01:00:15.423 --> 01:00:20.709
HOW CLOSE TO REMAIN TO TRUMP. HE
HAS A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT 

01:00:20.911 --> 01:00:25.777
OTHERS IN THE PARTY DON'T HAVE, 
BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH 

01:00:25.991 --> 01:00:28.011
HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TRUMP 
OVER THESE LAST FOUR YEARS. HE 

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:32.276
APPEARS TO BE MAKING A 
CALCULATION THAT HE CAN NEVER BE

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:34.490
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS AN ANTI-TRUMP
FIGURE

01:00:38.575 --> 01:00:40.809
AND SO HE HAS NO INTEREST IN 
PUBLICLY SPEAKING AGAINST HIM AT

01:00:41.561 --> 01:00:46.293
THIS POINT. IT ALSO SEEMS HE MAY
GENUINELY IN HIS HEART HAVE 

01:00:46.506 --> 01:00:48.506
FORGIVEN DONALD TRUMP FOR WHAT 
HAPPENED THAT DAY EVEN THOUGH 

01:00:48.528 --> 01:00:50.494
PLENTY OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM HAVE
NOT. 

01:00:50.495 --> 01:00:54.305
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, ROZ MENTIONED, THIS 
INTERVIEW WITH

01:00:58.277 --> 01:01:02.143
POLITICO. LET'S TALK ABOUT, THIS
IS A 2024 HOPEFUL. LET'S TALK 

01:01:02.342 --> 01:01:04.342
ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS OUTSIDE 
THE SENATE

01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:09.457
ARE NOW POSITIONING THEMSELVES 
AND TALKING ABOUT IN CONDEMNING 

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:13.525
OR NOT CONDEMNING DONALD TRUMP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY. 

01:01:13.725 --> 01:01:19.226
THE FACT THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH 
ANGER AFTER JANUARY 6 AND THE 

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:21.425
DEGREE TO WHICH THAT ANGER HAS 
SUBSIDED AMONG REPUBLICANS AND 

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:23.276
THE DEGREE TO WHICH KEVIN 
McCARTHY AND MITCH McCONNELL 

01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:25.277
HAVE BACKED OFF

01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:29.958
THEIR DIRECTLY EXPLICITLY 
BLAMING TRUMP FOR INCITING TO 

01:01:30.078 --> 01:01:34.545
RIOT. THEY SENSE WALKED IT BACK.

01:01:40.746 --> 01:01:43.341
EVERY REPUBLICAN WANTS TO RUN 
THE 2024 HAS RIGHT NOW A 

01:01:43.513 --> 01:01:45.513
STRUGGLE.

01:01:49.277 --> 01:01:54.565
LIKE MIKE PENCE, CRITICIZED 
TRUMP AND SAID IS NOT WHO THE 

01:01:54.773 --> 01:02:00.047
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ABOUT HE'S 
NOT A REAL CONSERVATIVE. BOTH 

01:02:00.248 --> 01:02:02.248
NIKKI HALEY AND MICHAEL PENCE 
CRITICIZED HIM WHEN HE CALLED 

01:02:02.284 --> 01:02:06.549
FOR MUSLIM BEEN ON DECEMBER 7, 
2015. SUBSEQUENTLY THEY BOTH 

01:02:06.751 --> 01:02:08.751
WENT INTO THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.132
NIKKI HALEY LEFT MIDWAY THROUGH 
THE TERM AND SHE'S TRIED TO 

01:02:18.332 --> 01:02:20.332
TRIANGULATE SHE CONTINUES TO TRY
TO DO.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:29.901
TRUMP SHOULDN'T HAVE FOLLOWED 
HIM, IT WAS WRONG TO SEE IF THE 

01:02:30.117 --> 01:02:32.263
ELECTION WAS STOLEN. DAMNING 
CRITICISM OF TRUMP

01:02:37.639 --> 01:02:41.087
HE GENERALLY BELIEVES THIS BIG 
LIE THAT HE ACTUALLY THINKS THAT

01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:46.175
THE SKY IS IN BLUE IS HOW SHE 
PUT IT. HE THINKS THE ELECTION 

01:02:46.372 --> 01:02:51.456
WAS STOLEN, EVEN THOUGH IT 
WASN'T. AND THEN SHE USES THAT 

01:02:51.656 --> 01:02:54.026
TO JUSTIFY DEFENDING HIM AND 
DEFENDING SOME OF HIS OTHER 

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.157
CONDUCT. THIS IS SOMETHING WE 
WILL SEE REPEATEDLY, REPUBLICANS

01:02:58.361 --> 01:03:03.842
WHO WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
TWISTING THEMSELVES IN PRETZELS.

01:03:04.043 --> 01:03:05.674
THE REALITY IS IT'S ALMOST 
INCONCEIVABLE BASED ON 

01:03:05.675 --> 01:03:08.923
EVERYTHING WE KNOW, IT'S THOMAS 
INCONCEIVABLE TO IMAGINE 

01:03:09.683 --> 01:03:11.683
ANTI-TRUMP REPUBLICAN

01:03:13.605 --> 01:03:15.605
BEING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR
REPUBLICAN IN 2024.

01:03:20.107 --> 01:03:22.139
THE APPROVAL RATING FOR HIM WITH
REPUBLICANS ARE STILL OVER 80%. 

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.987
THE BALANCING ACT IS TRYING TO 
APPEAL TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS BUT 

01:03:25.188 --> 01:03:27.976
ALSO APPEAL TO A LOT OF 
AMERICANS, TRUMP LOST THE 

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:30.119
ELECTION.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.753
A LOT OF AMERICANS WERE REPULSED
BY TRUMP AND TRUMP-ISM. SO 

01:03:35.953 --> 01:03:39.806
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE
FOR NIKKI HALEY AND ALSO THE 

01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:44.889
SENATORS WHO ARE JURORS, MARCO 
RUBIO SAYS HE'S GOING TO ACQUIT 

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:49.557
SAYING THIS PROCEEDING IS DUMB. 
TED CRUZ AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS

01:03:49.756 --> 01:03:54.023
MORNING GIVING TRIAL ADVICE TO 
TRUMP'S LAWYERS. JOSH HAWLEY, 

01:03:54.437 --> 01:03:56.437
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WAS 
ENCOURAGING

01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:02.970
TRYING TO OVERTURN AND DECERTIFY
THE RESULTS. REALLY THIS A BUNCH

01:04:03.171 --> 01:04:07.838
OF PEOPLE IN THE SENATE WHO WANT
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT BUT THOSE 

01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:10.775
ARE THE THREE BIG ONES. TOM 
COTTON, ANOTHER ONE WHO'S HAD TO

01:04:11.702 --> 01:04:14.696
FIGURE OUT THESE BALANCING ACTS 
OF PRAISING TRUMP BUT DISTANCING

01:04:14.877 --> 01:04:19.216
HIMSELF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REMEMBER BACK TO THE FIRST 

01:04:19.975 --> 01:04:23.484
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, DEMOCRATS 
ARGUED AT THAT TIME FOR 

01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:29.169
WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS AND 
THOSE CALLS FELL ON DEAF EARS AT

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:34.037
THE TIME BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WERE 
IN THE MINORITY. BUT NOW SENATOR

01:04:34.239 --> 01:04:36.068
SCHUMER AND THE DEMOCRATS 
CONTROL BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS.

01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:38.660
SO HERE'S THE QUESTION, WHY ARE 
THEY NOT CALLING WITNESSES AND 

01:04:38.801 --> 01:04:42.369
INSTEAD ELECTING TO MOVE AT A 
FASTER CLIP? IT'S SOMETHING THEY

01:04:42.569 --> 01:04:45.617
HAVE HAD TO WRESTLE WITH. WHAT 
IS THE CALCULATION THEY ARE 

01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:50.500
MAKING AND WHY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  IMPEACHMENT IS A 

01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:52.881
POLITICAL PROCESS IT IS OF 
COURSE ALL ABOUT  POLITICS.

01:04:57.804 --> 01:05:00.251
FRANKLY IT WAS THEN ALSO. I DO 
THINK THEY THOUGHT IN THE FIRST 

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.627
IMPEACHMENT HEARING FROM JOHN 
BOLTON WOULD BE A POWERFUL 

01:05:02.762 --> 01:05:06.536
MOMENT. BUT IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT 
TRYING TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC 

01:05:06.749 --> 01:05:08.769
THAT REPUBLICANS WERE NOT TAKING
THE PROCESS SERIOUSLY ENOUGH AND

01:05:08.984 --> 01:05:11.552
WERE NOT WILLING TO HEAR FROM 
PEOPLE THEY SHOULD BE HEARING 

01:05:11.697 --> 01:05:15.484
FROM BEFORE VOTING TO ACQUIT. 
THIS TIME AROUND, THINGS ARE 

01:05:15.683 --> 01:05:19.949
DIFFERENT. WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENT WHO HAS A BIG AND 

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:25.018
IMPORTANT AGENDA APPEARED HE 
STILL HAS KEY CABINET NOMINEES 

01:05:25.232 --> 01:05:29.084
WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.
HE HAS A COVID RELIEF PACKAGE 

01:05:29.285 --> 01:05:31.285
SHE WOULD LIKE TO GET THROUGH 
CONGRESS.

01:05:34.568 --> 01:05:36.601
WITNESSES ULTIMATELY AT THE END 
OF THE DAY MIGHT BRING FORWARD 

01:05:36.801 --> 01:05:40.815
NEW FACTS. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR 
SOME WITNESSES. BUT THEY MIGHT 

01:05:40.956 --> 01:05:43.795
NOT. THEY WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE 
TIME.

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.846
IF CALLS MIGHT RESIST APPEARING,
FORCING LITIGATION. I THINK THE 

01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:57.967
DEMOCRATS FEEL THAT SINCE THEIR 
AUDIENCE IS NOT NECESSARILY THE 

01:05:58.166 --> 01:06:00.166
SENATE, THE VOTE IN THE SENATE,

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:06.283
THE OUTCOME IS NOT MUCH IN 
DOUBT. IT IS LARGELY FOR THE 

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.516
AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK THEY 
FEEL VERY PLEASED WITH THE CASES

01:06:08.729 --> 01:06:11.296
THEY HAVE PUT ON FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THIS PAST 

01:06:11.452 --> 01:06:13.452
WEEK.

01:06:15.428 --> 01:06:17.862
IT IS BEEN TIGHT, IT IS BEEN 
EMOTIONAL. THEY HAVE LAID OUT A 

01:06:18.063 --> 01:06:21.729
CASE I THINK EVEN REPUBLICANS 
HAVE AGREED WAS A STRONGER AND 

01:06:21.932 --> 01:06:23.932
MORE CONTROLLED AND PERSUASIVE 
CASE THAN THEY MIGHT'VE 

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.041
EXPECTED.

01:06:28.831 --> 01:06:30.863
I DON'T THINK THEY FEEL LIKE 
THEY NEED WITNESSES TO PRESS 

01:06:31.063 --> 01:06:33.297
THAT CASE. IN FACT IT MIGHT 
UNDERCUT THE POWER OF WHAT THEY 

01:06:33.498 --> 01:06:37.977
HAVE DONE SO FAR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ROSALIND HELDERMAN, THANK YOU

01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:40.559
FOR JOINING US. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. 

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.479
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  THIS WEEK IS HISTORIC, IS 
THE FIRST TIME AN AMERICAN 

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.875
PRESIDENT HAS FACED TWO 
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS. BUT AS MY 

01:06:48.014 --> 01:06:53.211
COLLEAGUE POINTS OUT, LILLIAN 
CUNNINGHAM, WE CAN STILL LEARN A

01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:59.094
LOT FROM HISTORY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM THE CREATOR AND HOST OF 

01:06:59.857 --> 01:07:01.857
PRESIDENTIAL PODCASTS.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440
WHEN RICHARD NIXON WAS FACING 
IMPEACHMENT IN 1974 HE RESIGNED 

01:07:10.475 --> 01:07:12.909
THE PRESIDENCY. ON HIS FINAL DAY
HE LEFT IN A HELICOPTER FROM THE

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:15.140
WHITE HOUSE LAWN AND HE 
RETREATED TO HIS HOME ESTATE ON 

01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:20.220
THE CALIFORNIA COAST. NOW MOST 
PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO 

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.867
GO INTO HIDING THAT HE WOULD 
NEVER WANT TO SHOW HIS FACE IN 

01:07:23.068 --> 01:07:25.101
POLITICS AGAIN BUT THEY WERE 
WRONG. HE ACTUALLY SPENT A GOOD 

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.769
DEAL OF TIME CRAFTING A PLAN FOR
HOW TO REHABILITATE HIS IMAGE 

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:32.003
ALONG WITH A FEW STAFFERS WHO 
WENT WITH THEM. THIS PLAN 

01:07:32.204 --> 01:07:34.204
ACTUALLY HAD AN OFFICIAL NAME,

01:07:37.084 --> 01:07:39.084
THEY CALLED IT WIZARD. IT WAS A 
LONG-TERM STRATEGY TO 

01:07:39.117 --> 01:07:41.117
REHABILITATE HIS IMAGE

01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:49.667
THAT INVOLVED TRAVELING THE 
WORLD, GIVING SPEECHES ON 

01:07:49.668 --> 01:07:51.099
FOREIGN-POLICY, HOSTING 
EXCLUSIVE DINNER PARTIES AND IN 

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.100
SOME CASES EVEN SHOWING UP TO 
ATTEND

01:07:59.236 --> 01:08:01.236
THE FUNERALS OF OTHER ELDER 
STATESMAN EVEN WHEN HE WASN'T 

01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:03.269
INVITED. AT FIRST, ESPECIALLY IN
THE BEGINNING, NIXON WAS NOT 

01:08:03.302 --> 01:08:05.534
VERY WARMLY WELCOMED AT THESE 
EVENTS. BUT AS THE YEARS WENT 

01:08:05.734 --> 01:08:11.634
ON, THE PLAN DID SEEM TO HAVE 
SOME POSITIVE EFFECT IN HIS 

01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:14.012
POST-PRESIDENCY. HE WAS ABLE TO 
SOME EXTENT REHABILITATE HIS 

01:08:14.151 --> 01:08:16.151
IMAGE.

01:08:17.918 --> 01:08:20.367
IN FACT, IN 1979 THEY RELEASED A
LIST OF THE 10 MOST ADMIRED 

01:08:20.566 --> 01:08:22.566
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND ON IT 
WAS RICHARD NIXON. 

01:09:15.407 --> 01:09:17.441
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S ABOUT 20 MINUTES UNTIL 
THIS FOURTH DAY OF THE 

01:09:17.642 --> 01:09:22.723
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL BEGINS. AS 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE WILL

01:09:22.924 --> 01:09:27.191
HEAR FROM TRUMP'S LAWYERS AS 
THEY TRIED TO MOUNT A DEFENSE 

01:09:27.593 --> 01:09:29.759
AFTER TWO DAYS OF STRONG 
ARGUMENTS BY HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:34.449
MANAGERS. RHONDA COLVIN, LET'S 
GO TO YOU FOR THIS QUESTION 

01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:37.511
TRUMP'S POWER IN THE FUTURE?

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.593
WE HEARD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT 
ARGUMENTS FROM HOUSE IMPEACHMENT

01:09:43.187 --> 01:09:47.908
MANAGERS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IN 
THEIR MINDS, DANGER, THAT TRUMP,

01:09:48.108 --> 01:09:52.737
NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE HERE 
POSES TO THE REPUBLIC EVEN THEIR

01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:54.875
COLLEAGUES SITTING IN THAT 
SENATE CHAMBER.

01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:02.125
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  THAT'S RIGHT AND 
IT'S ALSO WRITTEN IN THE 

01:10:02.326 --> 01:10:04.326
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT HE 
SHOULD BE BANNED FROM OFFICE  

01:10:04.358 --> 01:10:06.791
AND EVER SERVING IN ANY 
SUPPORTIVE ELECTED OFFICE NOT 

01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:09.121
ONLY PRESIDENT BUT ANY ELECTED 
OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY.

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:16.753
IF YOU KNOW THE SENATE GETS TO 
THAT TWO THIRD MAJORITY WHERE 

01:10:16.956 --> 01:10:19.388
THEY DID VOTE TO CONVICT HIM WE 
ARE NOT SEEING SIGNS OF THAT 

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:22.638
MIGHT HAPPEN IF THEY DID DO THAT
THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A 

01:10:22.838 --> 01:10:24.838
SEPARATE VOTE AFTER THAT THEY 
WOULD ONLY REQUIRE A SIMPLE 

01:10:25.433 --> 01:10:27.924
MAJORITY OF SENATORS TO AGREE TO
BAN HIM FROM HOLDING OFFICE. SO 

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:32.590
THAT HAS BEEN A PART OF THE 
EARLY CRIES FROM HOUSE DEMOCRATS

01:10:32.791 --> 01:10:34.791
WHO WANTED TO PUT TOGETHER AN 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL QUICKLY AFTER 

01:10:34.826 --> 01:10:37.401
THE SIXTH IS THAT HE SHOULD NOT 
BE ABLE TO HOLD OFFICE AGAIN 

01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:39.588
BECAUSE HE WILL REPEAT THE SAME 
ACTIONS AGAIN.

01:10:45.192 --> 01:10:47.009
REMEMBER YESTERDAY THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SPENT A LOT

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.994
OF THEIR TIME IN THE EARLY PART 
SHOWING HOW HIS ACTIONS ON THE 

01:10:50.132 --> 01:10:52.906
SIXTH ARE PART OF A LARGER MO 
THAT YOU CAN TRACE IT ALL THE 

01:10:53.108 --> 01:10:58.197
WAY BACK TO THE PRIMARY SEASON 
OF 2015 WHERE HE DID NOT DECRY 

01:10:58.393 --> 01:11:00.826
THE VIOLENCE OR ASSAULT THAT 
HAPPENED AT HIS OWN RALLIES AND 

01:11:01.026 --> 01:11:03.874
INSTEAD ENCOURAGE THEM AND EVEN 
AFTER THEY HAPPEN HE SHOWED NO 

01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:06.277
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY OR 
CONTRITION.

01:11:09.558 --> 01:11:11.592
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED SURROUNDING
JANUARY 6 SO THEY SHOWED THIS IS

01:11:11.793 --> 01:11:13.793
A PART OF HIS BEHAVIOR

01:11:17.277 --> 01:11:19.508
AND HE WILL LIKELY DO IT AGAIN. 
WE WILL ALSO REMEMBER EARLIER 

01:11:19.722 --> 01:11:22.718
THIS WEEK WE HEARD FROM LISA 
MURKOWSKI WHEN SHE WAS AT ONE OF

01:11:22.859 --> 01:11:25.207
THE MICROPHONES NEAR THE SENATE 
CHAMBER SHE WAS ASKED IF HE 

01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:27.407
SHOULD BE BANNED FOR OFFICE, I 
AM

01:11:31.493 --> 01:11:33.323
PARAPHRASING. SHE SAID I CAN'T 
IMAGINE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

01:11:33.324 --> 01:11:35.919
WOULD EVER VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN 
AFTER SAYING WHAT WE JUST 

01:11:36.068 --> 01:11:40.442
WITNESSED. BUT THE THOUGHT THERE
IS THERE IS SOMETIME BETWEEN NOW

01:11:40.641 --> 01:11:43.075
AND 2024 OR WHEN HE MIGHT EVEN 
WANT TO SEEK OFFICE AGAIN. HE 

01:11:43.276 --> 01:11:48.971
SAID IN HIS LAST STATEMENT ON 
HER OPERATION DAY, HE SAID HE 

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:51.811
WOULD BE BACK IN SOME FASHION SO
HE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT HIS 

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.445
POLITICAL CAREER IS NOT OVER IF 
HE HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT 

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:58.512
AND THAT IS AT THE CORE OF THAT 
THESE DEMOCRATS ARGUMENT YOU CAN

01:11:58.713 --> 01:12:02.915
FORESEEABLY DO THIS AGAIN AND 
OFTEN TIMES SOFTENS PUBLIC 

01:12:03.055 --> 01:12:05.055
OPINION

01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:11.103
ON POLITICIAN SO HE DOES HAVE 
THAT BENEFIT ALSO. EVEN THOUGH 

01:12:11.316 --> 01:12:14.981
THESE IMAGES ARE VERY WRONG 
RIGHT NOW. IN 3 TO 4 YEARS IF HE

01:12:15.182 --> 01:12:20.464
RUNS AGAIN, WILL IT BE THE SAME 
CASE? 

01:12:20.465 --> 01:12:23.916
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WE JUST SAW DAVID 
SCHOEN, THE LAWYER FOR TRUMP  

01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:26.564
COMING INTO THE BUILDING. ONE OF
THE TWO MAIN LAWYERS. LET'S PLAY

01:12:26.765 --> 01:12:28.765
IT CLIP FROM YESTERDAY'S 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER

01:12:33.664 --> 01:12:35.912
,  THIS IS REP. TED LIEU WARNING
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL 

01:12:36.112 --> 01:12:40.579
FUTURE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  TRUMP SHOWS HE WILL 

01:12:40.779 --> 01:12:42.779
UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE FUTURE HARM IF
ALLOWED BECAUSE HE STILL REFUSES

01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:47.227
TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS PREVIOUS HIGH
GRADE OF CRIME AGAINST THE 

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.380
GOVERNMENT.

01:12:52.351 --> 01:12:54.596
I'M NOT AFRAID OF TRUMP RUNNING 
AGAIN IN FOUR YEARS, I'M AFRAID 

01:12:54.797 --> 01:12:57.731
HE'S GOING TO RUN AGAIN AND LOSE
BECAUSE HE CAN DO THIS AGAIN.

01:13:01.096 --> 01:13:03.530
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, THAT SEEM TO BE A LINE
OF ARGUMENT THE RESNICK NATIVE 

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:08.603
WITH REPUBLICANS YESTERDAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE THIS 

01:13:08.804 --> 01:13:10.804
MISTAKE NOW FOR SIX YEARS

01:13:14.702 --> 01:13:16.534
WITH THE THING THAT LISA 
MURKOWSKI SAID, REMEMBER HEARING

01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:21.602
1 MILLION TIMES IN 2015 FROM 
PEOPLE, LIKE MIKE PENCE, WHO I 

01:13:21.804 --> 01:13:23.804
INTERVIEWED AT A NATIONAL 
GOVERNORS IN 2015 AND HE SAID 

01:13:23.837 --> 01:13:29.121
TRUMP COULD NEVER WIN THE 
NOMINATION. SO THE IDEA HE'S 

01:13:29.321 --> 01:13:31.321
SOMEHOW NOT ABLE TO WIN AFTER

01:13:36.236 --> 01:13:37.854
DOING SCANDALOUS OR SAYING 
OUTRAGEOUS THINGS OR SOMETHING 

01:13:37.855 --> 01:13:41.922
REPUBLICANS OF FALLEN BACK ON 
REPEATEDLY OVER THE YEARS. IN 

01:13:42.122 --> 01:13:44.556
FACT, I COVERED A RALLY IN 2015 
OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL RIGHT BY THE

01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:49.226
ENTRANCE WHERE TED CRUZ APPEARED
WITH TRUMP TO OPPOSE THE IRANIAN

01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:52.475
NUCLEAR DEAL AND TED CRUZ TIED 
HIMSELF AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE 

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:58.975
TO TRUMP IN 2015 BECAUSE THEY 
ALL ASSUMED, HIS TEAM, INCLUDING

01:13:59.725 --> 01:14:01.725
JASON MILLER

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.090
, THEY ASSUMED TRUMP WOULD FLAME
OUT AND PEOPLE WOULDN'T VOTE FOR

01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:08.291
HIM SO THEY ARE TRYING TO UP 
HEAL

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:16.624
TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS BY TYING 
THEMSELVES TO HIM AND REFUSING 

01:14:16.655 --> 01:14:18.655
TO CRITICIZE HIM. ULTIMATELY THE
REFUSAL TO CRITICIZE HIM MEANT 

01:14:18.686 --> 01:14:20.719
HE NEVER DID FLAMEOUT. THEY 
DIDN'T ATTACK HIM UNTIL IT WAS 

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.003
TOO LATE AND HE STARTED WINNING 
IN A WAY THAT THE NOMINATION 

01:14:26.206 --> 01:14:28.440
COULDN'T BE DENIED ANYMORE. SO 
IT DOES FEEL LIKE WE HAVE SEEN 

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.292
THIS MOVIE BEFORE. I DO THINK 
THAT ARGUMENT FROM REP. TED LIEU

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.944
WAS DIRECTLY AIMED AT RESPONDING
TO THAT.  IN SOME WAYS, HE HAS 

01:14:35.696 --> 01:14:37.696
MADE CLEAR

01:14:39.407 --> 01:14:41.842
NOT ONLY THAT HE WANTS TO RUN 
AGAIN OR HAVE HIS SON OR 

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:44.476
DAUGHTER RUN AGAIN HE WANTS TO 
GET BACK OUT THERE. HE WANTS TO 

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.690
CONTINUE TO BE A FORCE IN THE 
GOP.

01:14:50.574 --> 01:14:52.606
ARE YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE 
WHO VERY MUCH REPUBLICANS WHO 

01:14:52.807 --> 01:14:55.540
WANT TO TURN THE PAGE AND MOVE 
ON FROM THE TRUMP ERA.

01:14:59.722 --> 01:15:01.540
BUT THERE IS THIS COLLECTIVE 
PROBLEM WHERE PRIVATELY THEY 

01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:04.187
DON'T WANT HIM TO RUN AGAIN BUT 
THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO WALK THE

01:15:04.388 --> 01:15:07.236
PLANK AND TAKE THE TOUGH BOAT 
THAT WOULD DRAW THE IRE OF TRUMP

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:09.356
SUPPORTERS. THIS COLLECTIVE 
ACTION PROBLEM ULTIMATELY MEANS 

01:15:09.357 --> 01:15:11.357
THAT

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.174
TRUMP IS ALL CERTAIN TO BE 
ACQUITTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO 

01:15:16.374 --> 01:15:20.437
BE THE DOMINATING FORCE IN THE 
GOP THROUGH AT LEAST 2024. 

01:15:20.438 --> 01:15:22.471
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS TRIAL IS HAPPENING IN 
THE SAME BUILDING THAT ATTACKERS

01:15:22.672 --> 01:15:24.672
RANSACKED ON JANUARY 6.

01:15:29.987 --> 01:15:31.804
OUR NATIONAL REPORTER, NICOLE 
ELLIS HAS BEEN SPEAKING WITH 

01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:33.805
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO DOCUMENT 
THEIR FIRST PERSON ACCOUNTS OF 

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.635
WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH THAT DAY.
THE CALL, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? 

01:15:36.772 --> 01:15:38.772
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:15:42.976 --> 01:15:45.211
NOT ONLY AS LAWMAKERS BUT WOMEN,
WOMEN OF COLOR AND MOTHERS WHICH

01:15:45.426 --> 01:15:47.426
WAS THE CASE FOR NORMA TORRES OF
CALIFORNIA.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.595
SHE IS A FORMER 911 CALL CENTER 
DISPATCHER AND MOTHER OF THREE. 

01:15:56.797 --> 01:15:59.231
SHE WAS ON THE BALCONY OF THE 
ROTUNDA, ONE OF THE LAST PLACES 

01:15:59.431 --> 01:16:01.662
TO BE EVACUATED. HERE'S WHAT SHE
HAD TO SAY IT WAS LIKE. 

01:16:06.345 --> 01:16:09.795
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY
WERE, WE COULD HEAR THEM, WE 

01:16:09.994 --> 01:16:13.866
COULD HEAR THE BANGING AND THE 
SHOUTING, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW 

01:16:14.282 --> 01:16:19.584
THAT THEY WERE JUST OUTSIDE. ONE
OF OUR MEMBERS SITTING ON THE 

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:26.079
OTHER SIDE BY HIMSELF. SO I RAN 
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALCONY

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:28.714
TO BE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE WAS 
SITTING BY HIMSELF AND I WALKED 

01:16:28.914 --> 01:16:32.163
OVER TO HIM AND GRABBED BOTH OF 
HIS HAM'S HANDS AND THEN I SAID 

01:16:32.377 --> 01:16:35.515
GAVE HIM SOME ALCOHOL BECAUSE WE
OF THE

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.931
COVID. SO WE JUST SAT THERE, 
SOME OF THE OFFICERS SAID WHEN I

01:16:43.135 --> 01:16:48.627
TELL YOU TO RUN YOU'RE GOING TO 
RUN OUT THAT DOOR. HE SAID RUN, 

01:16:49.028 --> 01:16:51.461
AT THAT TIME MY MIDDLE SON 
CALLED. ALL I SAID TO HIM WAS 

01:16:51.676 --> 01:16:53.676
SWEETER, I'M OKAY,

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:58.779
I'M LITERALLY RUNNING FOR MY 
LIFE RIGHT NOW I CAN'T TALK. HE 

01:16:58.977 --> 01:17:04.336
HAD JUST BEEN TOLD THAT THE U.S.
CAPITAL WAS UNDER SIEGE

01:17:09.547 --> 01:17:12.342
BY PEOPLE THAT WERE LOOKING FOR 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. YOU CAN 

01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:20.112
IMAGINE HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS 
GOING TO SEE ME AGAIN. WHAT 

01:17:20.874 --> 01:17:24.982
DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IN FOUR 
YEARS HE'S ALLOWED THESE PEOPLE 

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:31.080
TO REMOVE THEIR CLAN HOODS AND 
BE VERY OPEN AND PATENT BLATANT 

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.280
ABOUT THE RACISM.

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:43.030
CLEARLY THIS WAS IN AN EMOTIONAL
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR THE 

01:17:43.062 --> 01:17:45.097
CONGRESSMAN. I SPOKE TO HER 
AGAIN ABOUT A WEEK AFTER OUR 

01:17:45.857 --> 01:17:50.979
ORIGINAL INTERVIEW. SHE TOLD ME 
SHE WORE A BULLETPROOF VEST OF 

01:17:51.181 --> 01:17:53.181
EGGNOG INAUGURATION SHE STILL 
DOESN'T FEEL SAFE AND IS STILL 

01:17:53.214 --> 01:17:55.047
DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA WHAT 
HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIX. 

01:17:55.048 --> 01:17:57.048
YESTERDAY I PLAYED A TAPE OF 
FIRST SAYING

01:18:01.133 --> 01:18:03.578
HER WHITE PEERS CAN TAKE OFF 
MEMBER PIN AND TRY AND BLEND IN 

01:18:03.778 --> 01:18:05.810
THE CROWD IT'S A SENTIMENT THAT 
REP. DIANA DEGETTE OPEN  

01:18:06.011 --> 01:18:08.245
REMARKS. CONGRESS ONE WOMAN OF 
COLOR DIDN'T FEEL LIKE LENDING 

01:18:08.444 --> 01:18:13.730
AND WAS AN OPTION FOR THEM AS 
THE CROWDS MANY OF WHOM WERE 

01:18:14.495 --> 01:18:18.613
WHITE NATIONALIST SHOUTED RACIST
EPITHETS AT THEM. TODAY'S 

01:18:18.813 --> 01:18:20.813
MEETING MAY NOT FOCUS ON 
EXPERIENCES LIKE CONGRESSMAN

01:18:24.898 --> 01:18:26.931
TORRES. BUT STORIES LIKE ARE 
GOING TO PLAY A ROLE IN 

01:18:27.133 --> 01:18:29.326
CONTEXTUALIZING WHAT WE HEAR 
TODAY. BECAUSE THE TRAUMA WHAT 

01:18:29.465 --> 01:18:33.031
HAPPENED WON'T JUST HEAL WHEN 
THIS TRIAL IS OVER REGARDLESS OF

01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:36.369
HOW THE SENATE DECIDES TO VOTE. 
BACK TO YOU, LIBBY.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:43.343
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU NICOLE, HEARING 
THOSE STORIES BRINGS IT ALL 

01:18:43.476 --> 01:18:48.879
HOME. IN THIS NEXT STORY DOES AS
WELL. WE HAD A REALLY TOUGH 

01:18:49.078 --> 01:18:51.715
REPORT BY OUR COLLEAGUE, PETER 
HERMAN ABOUT ONE OF THE POLICE 

01:18:51.915 --> 01:18:55.981
OFFICERS WHO TOOK HIS OWN LIFE 
AFTER THE ATTACK. DC POLICE 

01:18:56.181 --> 01:18:58.573
OFFICER JEFFREY SMITH WAS 
ORDERED BACK TO WORK AFTER BEING

01:18:58.714 --> 01:19:00.714
BADLY

01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:07.769
INJURED IN THE C JEN INSTEAD HE 
SHOT AND KILLED HIMSELF ON THE 

01:19:07.965 --> 01:19:10.402
WAY IN. HE WAS JUST 35 YEARS 
OLD. POLICE FOUND HIM IN HIS 

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.431
FORD MUSTANG ALONG THE GEORGE 
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL PARKWAY. HE 

01:19:12.432 --> 01:19:15.681
WAS THE SECOND POLICE OFFICER 
WHO HAD BEEN AT THE RIOTS WHO 

01:19:15.882 --> 01:19:17.882
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. JAMES,

01:19:20.765 --> 01:19:25.847
STORIES LIKE THAT REALLY HIT 
HOME WITH THIS. LET'S GO TO A 

01:19:26.049 --> 01:19:28.049
SENATOR WHO IS AT THE 
MICROPHONE.

01:19:32.348 --> 01:19:37.217
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ASK SOME VERY INTRIGUING
QUESTIONS IF THIS IS NOT 

01:19:37.417 --> 01:19:39.417
IMPEACHABLE, WHAT IS?

01:19:42.499 --> 01:19:44.732
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY 
COMING BACK AND LOSING IF THIS 

01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:47.371
IS WHAT THEY DID WHEN THEY LOST 
THIS TIME. THOSE A QUESTION THE 

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.418
DEFENSE TEAM MUST ANSWER. I HOPE
THEY DON'T REST ENTIRELY ON 

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:53.180
PROCESS BECAUSE

01:19:55.096 --> 01:19:57.096
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY HAS BEEN 
SETTLED. IF WE DEBATE THAT ONCE 

01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:00.053
MORE IT WILL BE A WASTE OF TIME.
I DO HOPE THEY ADDRESS

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.465
, THE TIMELINE ISSUE. I WAS 
MENTIONING TO SOME OF YOUR 

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:10.530
COLLEAGUES, THE WASHINGTON 
EXAMINER, HE'S A VERY 

01:20:11.295 --> 01:20:13.295
CONSERVATIVE FELLER

01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:18.247
WRITING ABOUT SEN. TOMMY 
TUBERVILLE'S PHONE CONVERSATION 

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:21.097
AT 2:15 PM, HE INFORMED THE 
PRESIDENT  THAT THE VICE 

01:20:21.298 --> 01:20:26.367
PRESIDENT HAD JUST BEEN 
EVACUATED. SO THE PRESIDENT KNEW

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.397
THE PEOPLE HAD INVADED, THEY 
WERE APPROACHING THE SENATE 

01:20:28.398 --> 01:20:31.138
CHAMBER AND THE SECRET SERVICE 
FELT LIKE THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS

01:20:32.265 --> 01:20:36.931
IN TROUBLE. AND THEN A FEW 
MINUTES LATER TO TRUMP TWEETED 

01:20:37.694 --> 01:20:41.556
OUT ANOTHER TWEET NEGATIVELY 
AGAINST THE VICE PRESIDENT. 

01:20:41.557 --> 01:20:43.557
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE

01:20:47.298 --> 01:20:49.298
PRESIDENT CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGES 
AT THAT POINT AND THEN THE TWEET

01:20:49.331 --> 01:20:51.367
WENT OUT. THERE IS A LONG 
TIMELINE AND SOME FOLKS DON'T 

01:20:51.565 --> 01:20:53.796
BELIEVE THAT TIMELINE BECAUSE OF
SO LONG. BUT THAT IS A SENATOR 

01:20:53.998 --> 01:20:55.998
IS PROBABLY GOING TO VOTE FOR 
EQUITABLE

01:21:00.098 --> 01:21:01.915
WRITTEN BY THE CONSERVATIVE 
COMMONNESS. YOU PUT ALL THAT 

01:21:01.916 --> 01:21:04.148
TOGETHER GIVES IT SPECIAL 
CREDIBILITY, NO OFFENSE TO SOME 

01:21:04.362 --> 01:21:06.362
LIBERAL MAGAZINES, JUST TEASING.

01:21:09.032 --> 01:21:11.062
THE POINT BEING, I WOULD LIKE 
BOTH SIDES TO ADDRESS THIS, 

01:21:11.262 --> 01:21:14.314
CERTAINLY THE DEFENSE TEAM. HOW 
WOULD THEY EXPLAIN THAT AWAY IF 

01:21:14.515 --> 01:21:16.515
THEY ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT 
AWAY? 

01:21:26.901 --> 01:21:29.347
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT ARE SOME QUESTIONS YOU 
HAVE FOR THE DEFENSE TEAM AT HER

01:21:29.547 --> 01:21:31.379
IMPEACHMENT TODAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER THEY MAKE THEIR 

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:35.636
PRESENTATION. I WOULD LIKE THEM 
TO ADDRESS THAT LITTLE 

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:38.617
CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE ENTIRE 
TIMELINE. 

01:21:38.618 --> 01:21:46.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ABOUT IF 
YOU WOULD FURTHER VOTE FOR TRUMP

01:21:47.164 --> 01:21:51.481
AGAIN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WILL BE DETERMINED IF WE

01:21:51.683 --> 01:21:53.683
DECIDE HE IS GUILTY OR NOT. 

01:22:10.172 --> 01:22:12.172
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID

01:22:17.488 --> 01:22:19.507
THE NIGHT OF THE CERTIFICATION 
OF THE ELECTION THAT THE JURY 

01:22:19.722 --> 01:22:22.159
HAS SPOKEN I DIDN'T LIKE THE 
VERDICT BUT I WILL GO WITH THE 

01:22:22.356 --> 01:22:24.356
VERDICT. I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO, YOU 

01:22:24.389 --> 01:22:26.824
RESOLVE AN ISSUE AND THEN GO 
FORWARD. I DO KNOW THAT TED CRUZ

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:30.480
JUST POSTED SOMETHING ON FOX 
WEBSITE SAYING IT IS 

01:22:30.682 --> 01:22:32.682
CONSTITUTIONAL. SO I HAVE SOME

01:22:37.396 --> 01:22:39.630
CAVEAT, MAY NOT BE WISE BUT IT 
IS CONSTITUTIONAL. SO I CAN'T 

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:42.111
SPEAK TO WHY PEOPLE DECIDE WHAT 
THEY DO. I'M JUST TRYING TO 

01:22:42.263 --> 01:22:44.263
FIGURE IT OUT ON MY OWN. 

01:22:49.379 --> 01:22:51.379
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MANY RESPECT THE FACT I'M 
TRYING TO APPROACH IT 

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:53.399
OBJECTIVELY. THANK YOU.

01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:58.313
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO RHONDA COLVIN 
WITH THE TAKEAWAYS FROM SENATOR 

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.515
CASSIDY'S COMMENTS. 

01:23:05.216 --> 01:23:07.451
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  HE LOOKS LIKE HE 
IS STILL VERY INTERESTED IN 

01:23:07.652 --> 01:23:09.884
HEARING THE DEFENSE ARGUE WHY 
TRUMP TOOK SO LONG TO REACT AND 

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.420
WHY  HE SEEMED TO BE MORE 
PREOCCUPIED WITH CALLING

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.618
SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE TO 
CONTINUE TO INTERRUPT THE 

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:20.610
PROCEEDINGS AND THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTORAL 

01:23:20.611 --> 01:23:23.299
WENT  FOR PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. 
HE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.500
THAN SENDING ANY HELP

01:23:28.582 --> 01:23:30.615
OR TELLING PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO 
WERE COMING TO THE CAPITAL TO 

01:23:30.814 --> 01:23:33.049
STOP. SO THAT SEEMS TO BE A PART
OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

01:23:33.249 --> 01:23:35.249
ARGUMENT. THE REALLY WORKS ON 
SOMEBODY LIKE BILL CASSIDY WHO 

01:23:35.282 --> 01:23:39.132
IS SAYING RIGHT THERE HE IS 
STILL OPEN TO ACQUITTAL OR 

01:23:39.349 --> 01:23:42.395
CONVICTION. HE HAS NOT MADE UP 
HIS MIND. AT LAST CHECK THERE 

01:23:42.595 --> 01:23:48.013
ARE 40 SENATORS WHO WILL VOTE TO
CONVICT THEIR 21 IN THE MAYBE 

01:23:48.152 --> 01:23:51.529
COLUMN THEY HAVE NOT SAID ONE 
WAY OR THE OTHER, 37 HE SAID 

01:23:52.292 --> 01:23:54.292
THEY WON'T

01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:59.629
VOTE TO CONVICT. YOU NEED 
EVERYBODY IN THE MAYBE COLUMN 

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:01.685
AND SOME EXTRA REPUBLICANS WE 
ARE ANTICIPATING TO JOIN THEM 

01:24:01.884 --> 01:24:03.992
THAT THE SUPER MAJORITY BUT IT 
DOES SEEM LIKE

01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:12.630
THE ONE PART OF THE ANTIDOTES 
THAT IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TOLD 

01:24:12.661 --> 01:24:14.681
US ON WEDNESDAY ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS MORE 

01:24:14.896 --> 01:24:20.166
INTERESTED IN GIVING A CALL TO 
SENATOR TURBERVILLE THAN SENDING

01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:22.400
ANY HELP TO THE SENATORS AND 
VICE PRESIDENT WHO WERE UNDER 

01:24:22.602 --> 01:24:28.300
SIEGE. AND JUST FOR ANYBODY FROM
HOME, HE'S A FRESHMAN SENATOR IN

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.500
ALABAMA HE RAN ON A VERY

01:24:33.981 --> 01:24:36.012
PRO-TRUMP PLATFORM AND MOST OF 
HIS CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT TRUMP. HE

01:24:36.212 --> 01:24:40.280
TOLD THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA, ONE 
OF THE STATE THAT HAS A HIGH 

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480
MARGIN IN OF SUPPORT FOR

01:24:46.379 --> 01:24:48.400
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 
HE TOLD THEM HE WOULD GO THROUGH

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:50.617
TO WASHINGTON AND PUT THROUGH 
TRUMP'S AGENDA AND THAT WORKED 

01:24:51.197 --> 01:24:54.700
FOR HIM. SO HE IS A KEY PERSON 
THE TRUMP TEAM WANTED TO GET 

01:24:54.901 --> 01:24:57.433
INTO CONTACT WITH. WE ALSO HEARD
THAT RUDY GIULIANI CALLED

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:04.652
SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE, WE NEEDED
TO SLOW THINGS DOWN. THAT'S WHY 

01:25:04.865 --> 01:25:07.100
HE WAS A MEMBER THAT WAS 
TARGETED.  HE IS A FRESHMAN 

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.931
MEMBER AND ALLY OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 

01:25:09.932 --> 01:25:13.881
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; APPRECIATE THE CONTEXT IS 
ALSO ONE OF THE ONES TO FLIRT

01:25:17.453 --> 01:25:19.482
WITH NOT VOTING TO CERTIFY THE 
ELECTION. HE WASN'T BEHOLDEN TO 

01:25:20.243 --> 01:25:24.364
MITCH McCONNELL AS OTHER 
REPUBLICANS WERE. HE WAS SEEN AS

01:25:24.563 --> 01:25:27.813
A VULNERABLE REPUBLICAN FOR 
TRUMP TO ALLY HIMSELF WITH. 

01:25:28.214 --> 01:25:30.598
THANK YOU RHONDA. I WANT TO GO 
TO JAMES HOHMANN, 

01:25:36.351 --> 01:25:38.571
ANYONE WHO IS JUST LISTENING TO 
THIS AND DIDN'T HAVE A POLITICAL

01:25:38.784 --> 01:25:40.784
AGENDA MIGHT BE ASKING SOME 
GENUINE AND AUTHENTIC QUESTIONS 

01:25:40.821 --> 01:25:42.821
HERE WHICH IS WHAT

01:25:45.886 --> 01:25:48.276
SENATOR CASSIDY IS COMMUNICATING
SOME OF THIS IS ABOUT POLITICAL 

01:25:48.463 --> 01:25:50.463
THEATER.

01:25:51.983 --> 01:25:54.017
SIGNIFICANT TO HEAR THOSE. I'M 
INTERESTED TO HEAR IF YOU HAVE 

01:25:54.218 --> 01:25:56.218
REMARKS ON THERE.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.133
WASHINGTON DC POLICE OFFICERS 
WHAT THEY DEALT WITH ON JANUARY 

01:26:05.269 --> 01:26:07.269
6.

01:26:09.853 --> 01:26:11.885
THAT WAS ALSO WHY WASN'T THE 
PRESIDENT SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE

01:26:12.101 --> 01:26:17.172
VIOLENCE AGAINST POLICE 
OFFICERS. ABOUT TWO OFFICERS WHO

01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:20.421
KILLED THEMSELVES IN THE 
AFTERMATH. 

01:26:20.422 --> 01:26:23.218
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, THAT WAS SOME OF THE 
MOST COMPELLING EFFORTS GIVEN BY

01:26:23.393 --> 01:26:25.393
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT

01:26:28.544 --> 01:26:30.576
, THE LINE HAS BEEN BREACHED, 
THIS WAS DEEPLY TRAUMATIZING FOR

01:26:30.778 --> 01:26:36.627
A LOT OF OFFICERS NOT JUST THE 
TWO WHO HAVE TAKEN THEIR OWN 

01:26:36.765 --> 01:26:41.544
LIVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET WITH 

01:26:41.748 --> 01:26:44.184
JOYCE KOH BRIEFLY BEFORE WE HEAD
TO THE TRIAL.  SHE IS BEEN 

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:47.321
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND SHE 
IS WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:26:51.859 --> 01:26:53.859
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:26:58.001 --> 01:27:00.184
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CUTTING 
THROUGH SOME OF THAT IMPEACHMENT

01:27:00.324 --> 01:27:06.332
NEWS WITH THE LARGE BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS OWN HIS 

01:27:06.533 --> 01:27:08.152
ADMINISTRATION HAS SECURED 200 
MILLION CORONAVIRUS VACCINES 

01:27:08.153 --> 01:27:10.153
THEY HAD PROMISED.

01:27:13.034 --> 01:27:16.485
SAYING THERE ARE 300 MILLION 
VACCINES THAT SHOULD BE READY 

01:27:16.886 --> 01:27:19.735
AND AVAILABLE TO AMERICANS BY 
JULY DISTRIBUTION COULD CHANGE 

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:24.817
THAT DATE AS TO WHEN AMERICANS 
ACTUALLY GET THOSE VACCINES. 

01:27:25.018 --> 01:27:29.285
TOTAL OF 300 MILLION VACCINES TO
BE READY BY JULY. DURING THOSE 

01:27:30.046 --> 01:27:33.951
REMARKS YESTERDAY HE ALSO 
CRITICIZED THE TRUMP 

01:27:34.151 --> 01:27:36.151
ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT HE CALLS

01:27:41.667 --> 01:27:43.702
A GIANT LOGISTICAL ISSUE WITH 
THE VACCINE SUPPLY. HE SAID WHEN

01:27:43.903 --> 01:27:45.903
HE TOOK OFFICE THERE WAS AN 
IMPRESSION BY THE TRUMP 

01:27:45.934 --> 01:27:47.968
ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE WAS 
SOME SORT OF DISTRIBUTION HOLD 

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:52.434
UP. HE SAID YESTERDAY THERE WAS 
AN ISSUE WITH QUOTE, SUPPLIED BY

01:27:53.199 --> 01:27:59.886
THE TIME WE WERE ELECTED IN THE 
TIME SOMEONE REALIZE WE ARE 

01:28:00.024 --> 01:28:03.000
ELECTED. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS 
WALKING AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE 

01:28:03.762 --> 01:28:05.762
GROUNDS WITH

01:28:09.499 --> 01:28:11.499
DR. JILL BIDEN. HE WAS ASKED 
ABOUT THE IMPEACHMENT THIS 

01:28:11.533 --> 01:28:13.367
MORNING, TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT 
HE SAID TODAY? 

01:28:13.368 --> 01:28:15.368
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE

01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:22.499
WHAT OUR REPUBLICANS FRIENDS DO,
IF THEY STAND UP. 

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.331
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING WITH ANY
OF THEM? 

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:27.381
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, NO I AM NOT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter:  IS IMPEACHMENT 

01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:29.401
TRIAL LIKELY CONTINUES INTO THE 
WEEKEND, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 

01:28:29.402 --> 01:28:31.849
WILL BE GETTING ON A PLANE 
TONIGHT  TO HEAD TO CAMP DAVID 

01:28:32.049 --> 01:28:36.315
AND HE WILL BE THERE THROUGH 
PRESIDENTS' DAY WEEKEND. 

01:28:36.316 --> 01:28:38.902
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU, JOYCE KOH,  JAMES 
HOHMANN, 

01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:45.051
IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS SAYING IN

01:28:45.251 --> 01:28:46.882
TERMS OF REPUBLICANS AND THE 
ROLE RIGHT NOW. 

01:28:46.883 --> 01:28:49.717
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CLEARLY PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 
WANTS TO ENGAGE. HE'S TRYING TO 

01:28:49.917 --> 01:28:55.003
SHOW THAT HE'S FOCUSED ON WHAT 
AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. 

01:28:55.202 --> 01:28:57.202
THIS IS REALLY A TEST

01:29:04.553 --> 01:29:07.186
IF HALF A DOZEN REPUBLICANS VOTE
TO CONVICT TRUMP, THAT IS AN 

01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:10.730
EARLY SIGN EVEN THOUGH THEY 
DON'T

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:18.368
VOTE FOR RELIEF PACKAGE THEY 
MIGHT BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE 

01:29:18.565 --> 01:29:20.184
ELEMENTS OF BIDEN'S AGENDA THIS 
YEAR. 

01:29:20.185 --> 01:29:22.982
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVERYONE IS GETTING READY AND
THE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE HERE 

01:29:23.117 --> 01:29:25.117
AT

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:29.936
WE WILL HEAR FROM THE SENATE 
CHAPLAIN, BARRY BLACK AS HE 

01:29:30.138 --> 01:29:32.138
DELIVERS THE OPENING PRAYER 
WHICH

01:29:36.234 --> 01:29:38.669
RINGS IN THE EARS MANY OF THE 
JURORS AS THEY PREPARE FOR THE 

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:42.133
DAY. AND THEN IT IS UP TO FORMER
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S TEAM. 

01:33:35.723 --> 01:33:38.119
THE ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT NOW 
BEFORE THE SENATE

01:33:42.009 --> 01:33:44.009
IS AN UNJUST AND BLATANTLY 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF 

01:33:44.042 --> 01:33:46.042
POLITICAL VENGEANCE. THIS

01:33:48.922 --> 01:33:50.922
APPALLING ABUSE OF THE 
CONSTITUTION FURTHER DIVIDES OUR

01:33:51.112 --> 01:33:54.747
NATION WHEN WE SHOULD BE TRYING 
TO COME TOGETHER AROUND SHARED 

01:33:54.969 --> 01:34:01.711
PRIORITIES. LIKE EVERY OTHER 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED WITCHHUNT 

01:34:02.126 --> 01:34:07.727
THAT THE LEFT HAS ENGAGED IN 
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THIS 

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:10.860
IMPEACHMENT IS COMPLETELY 
DIVORCED FROM THE FACTS, 

01:34:11.082 --> 01:34:15.079
EVIDENCE, AND THE INTEREST OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE SENATE 

01:34:15.298 --> 01:34:19.157
SHOULD PROMPTLY AND DECISIVELY 
VOTE TO REJECT IT.

01:34:25.492 --> 01:34:27.250
NO THINKING PERSON COULD 
SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE 

01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:31.780
PRESIDENT'S JANUARY 6 THE SPEECH
WAS IN ANY WAY AN ASSIGNMENT TO 

01:34:32.194 --> 01:34:41.125
VIOLENCE OR INSURRECTION. THE 
SUGGESTION IS ABSURD. NOTHING 

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:46.560
COULD EVER BE CONSTRUED AS 
ENCOURAGING CONDONING, OR 

01:34:46.797 --> 01:34:50.435
ENTICING UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY OF 
ANY KIND

01:34:54.537 --> 01:34:56.537
. FAR FROM

01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:02.267
PROVOKING INSURRECTION. THE 
PRESENTS REMARKS ENCOURAGE THOSE

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:07.078
IN ATTENTION TO EXERCISE THEIR 
RIGHTS PEACEFULLY AND 

01:35:07.299 --> 01:35:10.751
PATRIOTICALLY. PEACEFUL AND 
PATRIOTIC

01:35:16.065 --> 01:35:18.712
PROTEST IS THE ANTITHESIS OF A 
VIOLENT ASSAULT ON THE NATIONS

01:35:25.977 --> 01:35:33.540
CAPITOL.  THE SLANDER SAYS THAT 
THEY EXPECTED THE CROWD TO 

01:35:33.942 --> 01:35:36.043
INTERFERE WITH THE CERTIFICATION
OF THE RESULTS OF THE 2020 

01:35:36.534 --> 01:35:38.534
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

01:35:42.275 --> 01:35:44.719
THIS HAS BEEN DISPROVEN BY THE 
PLAIN TEXT OF THE REMARKS. THE 

01:35:44.936 --> 01:35:49.022
PRESIDENT DEVOTED HIS ENTIRE 
SPEECH TO AN EXTENDED DISCUSSION

01:35:49.238 --> 01:35:51.238
OF HOW LEGISLATORS

01:35:57.306 --> 01:35:59.506
SHOULD VOTE ON THE QUESTION AT 
HAND. INSTEAD OF EXPRESSING THE 

01:35:59.723 --> 01:36:01.920
DESIRE THAT THE JOINT SESSION BE
PREVENTED FROM CONDUCTING ITS 

01:36:02.134 --> 01:36:04.537
BUSINESS, THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF 
ITS REMARKS IS THAT THE 

01:36:04.749 --> 01:36:08.293
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WOULD AND 
SHOULD PLAY OUT ACCORDING TO THE

01:36:08.509 --> 01:36:14.978
LETTER OF THE LAW. INCLUDING THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE ELECTRICAL 

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.920
ELECTORIAL

01:36:21.885 --> 01:36:24.289
COUNT ACT. HE THEN LAID OUT A 
SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE STEPS THAT

01:36:24.503 --> 01:36:26.707
SHOULD BE TAKEN TO IMPROVE 
DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY GOING 

01:36:26.923 --> 01:36:28.923
FORWARD

01:36:30.615 --> 01:36:32.622
. SUCH AS PASSING UNIVERSAL 
VOTER I.D. LEGISLATION

01:36:42.193 --> 01:36:45.404
. AND TURNING OUT STRONG IN THE 
NEXT PRIMARY. NOT ONLY

01:36:55.188 --> 01:37:01.286
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SPEECH ON
JANUARY 6th, HIS ENTIRE  

01:37:01.687 --> 01:37:03.687
CHALLENGE TO THE ELECTION 
RESULTS WERE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON

01:37:04.078 --> 01:37:06.078
HOW THE

01:37:07.985 --> 01:37:10.018
PROPER CIVIC PROCESS COULD 
ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THROUGH THE

01:37:10.238 --> 01:37:12.220
ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. THE 

01:37:12.221 --> 01:37:16.705
PRESIDENT BROUGHT HIS CASE 
BEFORE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:22.378
, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, THE 
STATE LEGISLATURE, THE ELECTORAL

01:37:23.632 --> 01:37:29.514
COLLEGE AND THE U.S. CONGRESS. 
IN THE PAST NUMEROUS CANDIDATES 

01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:33.225
FOR PRESIDENT HAVE USE THE SAME 
PROCESS TO PURSUE THEIR OWN 

01:37:33.938 --> 01:37:41.193
ELECTION CHALLENGES. AS RECENTLY
AS 2016 THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:46.605
BROUGHT MULTIPLE POST ELECTION 
COURT CASES AND DEMANDED 

01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:54.058
RECOUNTS AND DECLARED THE 
ELECTION STOLEN BY RUSSIA. MANY 

01:37:54.284 --> 01:37:56.284
DEMOCRATS PERSUADED TO

01:38:01.621 --> 01:38:05.875
ENCOURAGE THE RESULTS TO BE 
OVERTURNED IN 2016. HOUSE 

01:38:06.102 --> 01:38:08.096
MANAGER RASKIN OBJECTED TO THE 
CERTIFICATION OF  PRESIDENT 

01:38:08.097 --> 01:38:10.097
DONALD TRUMP'S A VICTORY

01:38:13.805 --> 01:38:19.290
. YOU REMEMBER IT WAS A JOE 
BIDEN WHO HAD A GAVEL HIM DOWN 

01:38:20.252 --> 01:38:26.340
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OBJECTION. 10 OF THE 29 
ELECTORIAL VOTES WERE CAST BY

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.763
NONCERTIFIED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I OBJECT TO THE CERTIFICATE 

01:38:36.001 --> 01:38:40.461
FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SUBJECT TO THE CERTIFICATE 

01:38:40.823 --> 01:38:42.823
FROM GEORGIA 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I OBJECT

01:38:46.305 --> 01:38:48.510
TO THE 15 VOTES FROM THE STATE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA. 

01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:51.989
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I OBJECT TO THE CERTIFICATE 
FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA. THE 

01:38:52.403 --> 01:38:55.712
ELECTORIAL'S WERE NOT SIGNED BY 
THE SENATOR. 

01:38:55.713 --> 01:38:58.254
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE OBJECTION CANNOT BE 
ENTERTAINED.

01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:09.870
BUT THERE IS NO DEBATE BY THE 
JOINT SESSION. 

01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:11.871
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE

01:39:14.538 --> 01:39:16.072
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE. PLEASE 

01:39:16.073 --> 01:39:21.006
COME TO ORDER. YOUR OBJECTION 
CANNOT BE RECEIVED. IT PROHIBITS

01:39:28.752 --> 01:39:31.362
DEBATE IN THE JOINT SESSION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DO NOT WISH TO DEBATE. 

01:39:31.363 --> 01:39:33.974
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WISH TO ASK IF THERE'S ONE 
THAT UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO 

01:39:34.192 --> 01:39:36.192
WILL JOIN ME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE.

01:39:42.769 --> 01:39:44.769
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN 2000 THE DISPUTE

01:39:48.051 --> 01:39:50.265
OVER THE OUTCOME WAS TAKEN TO 
THE SUPREME COURT THAT RENDERED 

01:39:50.846 --> 01:39:53.187
A DECISION TO LITIGATE QUESTIONS
OF AN ELECTION INTEGRITY WITHIN 

01:39:53.693 --> 01:39:55.693
THE SYSTEM

01:39:58.008 --> 01:39:59.751
IS NOT INCITEMENT TO 
RESURRECTION. IT IS THE 

01:39:59.752 --> 01:40:02.019
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WORKING AS THE
FOUNDERS AND THE LAWMAKERS HAVE 

01:40:02.231 --> 01:40:08.371
DESIGNED. TO CLAIM THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IN ANY WAY WISH, 

01:40:08.603 --> 01:40:10.603
DESIRED, OR ENCOURAGED

01:40:14.468 --> 01:40:16.647
LAWLESS OR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR WAS 
A PREPOSTEROUS AND MONSTROUS 

01:40:16.865 --> 01:40:21.921
LIE. IN FACT THE FIRST TWO 
MESSAGES THAT THE PRESIDENT SENT

01:40:22.136 --> 01:40:28.291
VIA TWITTER WERE "STAY PEACEFUL,
NO VIOLENCE, WE ARE THE PARTY OF

01:40:28.509 --> 01:40:35.130
LAW AND ORDER". THE GATHERING ON
JANUARY 6th WAS POST TO BE UP 

01:40:36.401 --> 01:40:39.849
PEACEFUL EVENT. MAKE NO MISTAKE 
ABOUT THAT. AND THE OVERWHELMING

01:40:40.065 --> 01:40:44.989
MAJORITY OF THOSE IN ATTENDANCE 
REMAINED PEACEFUL. AS EVERYBODY 

01:40:45.206 --> 01:40:50.900
KNOWS THE PRESIDENT HAD A SPOKEN
AT HUNDREDS OF LARGE RALLIES 

01:40:51.115 --> 01:40:54.938
ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST
FIVE YEARS. THERE HAD NEVER BEEN

01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:57.649
ANY MOB

01:40:59.765 --> 01:41:02.197
LIKE BEHAVIOR. A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF EACH EVENT WAS 

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.428
DEVOTED TO CELEBRATING THE RULE 
OF LAW. PROTECTING OUR 

01:41:07.647 --> 01:41:12.910
CONSTITUTION, AND HONORING THE 
MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW 

01:41:13.126 --> 01:41:19.263
ENFORCEMENT. CONTRASTS THE 
PRESIDENT'S REPEATED 

01:41:19.664 --> 01:41:24.547
CONDEMNATIONS OF VIOLENCE WITH 
THE RHETORIC OF HIS OPPONENTS. 

01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:29.325
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM A PRESIDENT OF LAW AND 
ORDER. AND AN OUTLAY OF ALL 

01:41:29.542 --> 01:41:34.149
PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MASS MAJORITY OF THE 

01:41:34.365 --> 01:41:38.705
PROTESTS HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPUBLICANS STAND FOR LAW AND

01:41:38.934 --> 01:41:43.257
ORDER AND JUSTICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY'RE NOT

01:41:43.599 --> 01:41:48.642
UPRISINGS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY? 
MAYBE THERE WILL BE ? 

01:41:48.643 --> 01:41:55.626
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I STAND AGAINST VIOLENCE, 
MAYHEM, AND ORDER. I STAND WITH 

01:41:56.028 --> 01:41:58.028
THE HEROES OF LAW AND ORDER.

01:42:05.162 --> 01:42:10.208
WE WILL NEVER DEFUND OUR POLICE.

01:42:17.359 --> 01:42:21.422
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK 
AND PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE. 

01:42:21.423 --> 01:42:23.423
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVERYBODY WANTS LAW AND 
ORDER.

01:42:27.306 --> 01:42:31.570
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE RELEASED THE 
WHIRLWIND, KAVANAUGH, AND YOU 

01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:33.791
WILL PAY THE

01:42:36.652 --> 01:42:38.652
PRICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE TO HAVE A LAW AND 

01:42:38.781 --> 01:42:40.325
ORDER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHOW ME WHERE PROTESTERS HAVE

01:42:40.326 --> 01:42:46.402
TO BE POLITE AND PEACEFUL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER. 

01:42:59.211 --> 01:43:01.974
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TRAGICALLY ON A JANUARY 6th A
SMALL GROUP WHO CAME TO ENGAGE 

01:43:02.187 --> 01:43:05.059
IN VIOLENT  BEHAVIOR HIJACKED 
THE EVENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES

01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:10.915
. ACCORDING TO PUBLICLY 
AVAILABLE REPORTING AND APPARENT

01:43:11.132 --> 01:43:13.132
THAT EXTREMISTS

01:43:16.061 --> 01:43:19.917
HAVE A VERY STRIPES AND 
POLITICAL PERSUASION PREPLANNED 

01:43:20.139 --> 01:43:22.139
AND PREMEDITATED PLAN ON THE 
CAPITAL

01:43:27.429 --> 01:43:30.779
CAPITOL. ONE OF THE FIRST ARREST
WAS A LEADER OF ANTIFA.  HE WAS 

01:43:31.007 --> 01:43:35.816
AMONG THE FIRST TO BE RELEASED 
FROM THE BEGINNING THE PRESIDENT

01:43:36.033 --> 01:43:38.033
HAS BEEN CLEAR THE CRIMINALS WHO

01:43:44.898 --> 01:43:47.158
INFILTRATED THE CAPITAL MUST BE 
PUNISHED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF 

01:43:47.377 --> 01:43:50.212
THE LAW. AND SHOULD BE IN PRISON
AS LONG AS THE LAW ALLOWS. THE 

01:43:50.432 --> 01:43:56.280
FACT THAT THE ATTACKS WERE 
PREMEDITATED AS ALLEGED 

01:43:57.242 --> 01:44:02.131
DEMONSTRATES THE LUDICROUSNESS. 
YOU CANNOT

01:44:08.058 --> 01:44:10.270
INCITE WHAT WAS ALREADY GOING TO
HAPPEN. LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:14.961
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES HEROICALLY,
COURAGEOUSLY, AND ARE COUNTRY 

01:44:15.185 --> 01:44:21.255
OWES THEM A NET ETERNAL DEBT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE MUST BE A DISCUSSION OF

01:44:21.475 --> 01:44:23.447
THE DECISION BY POLITICAL 
LEADERSHIP REGARDING FORCED 

01:44:23.448 --> 01:44:28.506
POSTURE AND SECURITY IN ADVANCE 
OF THE EVENT. AS MANY WILL 

01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:34.016
RECALL, LAST SUMMER THE WHITE 
HOUSE WAS FACED WITH VIOLENT

01:44:36.851 --> 01:44:38.851
RIOTERS 

01:44:41.163 --> 01:44:44.012
, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. THEY ATTACK
SECRET SERVICE OFFICERS AND 

01:44:44.413 --> 01:44:46.413
PIERCED IS SECURITY WALL.

01:44:50.915 --> 01:44:53.033
AND THAT CAUSE THE CLEARING OF 
LAFAYETTE SQUARE. SINCE THAT 

01:44:53.265 --> 01:44:57.079
TIME THERE HAS BEEN A SUSTAINED 
NEGATIVE NARRATIVE IN THE MEDIA 

01:44:57.292 --> 01:44:59.821
REGARDING THE NECESSITY OF THOSE
SECURITY MEASURES ON THAT NIGHT.

01:45:00.262 --> 01:45:05.963
EVEN THOUGH THEY PREVENTED MANY 
CALAMITIES FROM OCCURRING. IN 

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:11.393
THE WAKE OF THE CAPITOL ATTACK. 

01:45:22.555 --> 01:45:24.555
CONSIDER THIS.

01:45:27.081 --> 01:45:29.678
ON JANUARY 5th. THE MAYOR OF THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DISCOURAGED

01:45:30.934 --> 01:45:33.330
THE NATIONAL GUARD AND FEDERAL 
AUTHORITIES FROM DOING MORE TO 

01:45:33.545 --> 01:45:39.211
PROTECT THE CAPITOL. AND SAYING 
"THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IS NOT

01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:42.915
REQUESTING OTHER FEDERAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, AND 

01:45:43.667 --> 01:45:51.008
DISCOURAGES ANY ADDITIONAL 
DEPLOYMENT". BUT THIS

01:45:53.156 --> 01:45:56.679
SERIOUS THREAT TO LEADERS OF

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:03.191
BOTH PARTIES AT EVERY LEVEL OF 
GOVERNMENT. THE SENATE SHOULD BE

01:46:03.534 --> 01:46:10.698
CAREFUL OF THE PRESIDENT 
PRECEDENT THAT THIS CASE WILL 

01:46:10.915 --> 01:46:12.915
SET

01:46:17.402 --> 01:46:22.719
UP. IF YOU DO NOT FIGHT LIKE 
HELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

01:46:23.275 --> 01:46:25.275
COUNTRY ANYMORE.

01:46:27.027 --> 01:46:29.891
THIS IS ORDINARY POLITICAL 
RHETORIC THAT IS 

01:46:30.107 --> 01:46:34.594
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE 
LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN USED FROM

01:46:34.810 --> 01:46:37.590
PEOPLE ACROSS THE POLITICAL 
SPECTRUM FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. 

01:46:38.554 --> 01:46:43.429
COUNTLESS POLITICIANS HAVE 
SPOKEN OF FIGHTING FOR OUR 

01:46:43.646 --> 01:46:48.505
PRINCIPLES. JOE BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN
SLOGAN WAS

01:46:52.623 --> 01:46:54.589
"BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF 
AMERICA". NO HUMAN BEING 

01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:59.196
BELIEVES THAT SUCH USE OF 
METAPHORICAL TERMINOLOGY IS 

01:46:59.409 --> 01:47:05.861
INCITEMENT TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE
. WHILE THE PRESIDENT DID NOT 

01:47:06.072 --> 01:47:10.122
ENGAGE IN ANY LANGUAGE OF 
INCITEMENT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS 

01:47:10.333 --> 01:47:15.175
OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE
INDEED USED PROFOUNDLY RECKLESS,

01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:21.272
DANGEROUS, AND INFLAMMATORY 
RHETORIC IN RECENT YEARS. THE 

01:47:21.490 --> 01:47:26.559
ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND 
NATIONAL NEWS MEDIA SPENT THE 

01:47:26.775 --> 01:47:29.149
LAST FOUR YEARS REPEATING 
WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE

01:47:34.674 --> 01:47:40.158
THAT THE 2016 ELECTION HAD BEEN 
HACKED. AND FALSELY CLAIMED THAT

01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:45.683
THE PRESENT UNITED STATES WAS A 
RUSSIAN SPY. HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY

01:47:45.894 --> 01:47:50.926
PELOSI SAID THAT THE 2016 
ELECTION WAS HIJACKED AND THAT 

01:47:51.328 --> 01:47:55.190
CONGRESS HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT 
OUR DEMOCRACY. SHE ALSO CALLED 

01:47:55.956 --> 01:48:01.910
THE PRESIDENT AN IMPOSTER AND A 
TRAITOR AND REFERRED TO HER 

01:48:02.125 --> 01:48:09.807
COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE AS THE 
ENEMY WITHIN MANY DEMOCRATS 

01:48:10.222 --> 01:48:16.126
POLITICIANS ENDORSE THE RIOTS 
THAT DESTROYED VAST SWATHS OF 

01:48:16.344 --> 01:48:22.344
AMERICAN CITIES LAST SUMMER. 
WHEN VIOLENT ANARCHISTS 

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:30.339
CONTAINED A FEDERAL COURTHOUSE 
IN 

01:48:32.774 --> 01:48:34.774
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI DID 
NOT CALL IT AN INSURRECTION, 

01:48:34.932 --> 01:48:40.624
INSTEAD SHE CALLED THE OFFICERS 
PROTECTING THE BUILDING STORM 

01:48:40.843 --> 01:48:42.843
TROOPERS

01:48:43.902 --> 01:48:50.284
. WHEN VIOLENT MOBS DESTROYED 
PUBLIC PROPERTY SHE SAID PEOPLE 

01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:55.896
WILL DO WHAT THEY DO. THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF

01:48:56.116 --> 01:49:01.572
MASSACHUSETTS STATED THAT 
AMERICA IS BURNING, BUT THAT IS 

01:49:01.789 --> 01:49:05.841
HOW FORESTS GROW.

01:49:10.367 --> 01:49:13.855
DECLARING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE
UNREST IN THE STREETS FOR AS 

01:49:14.076 --> 01:49:16.076
LONG AS THERE IS UNREST IN OUR 
LIVES

01:49:20.917 --> 01:49:24.237
. THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT 
URGED SUPPORTERS TO DONATE TO A 

01:49:24.453 --> 01:49:31.122
FUND THAT BAILED OUT VIOLENT 
RIOTERS  OUT OF JAIL. 

01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:38.937
RELEASED AND WENT OUT AND 
COMMITTED AN ASSAULT. HE BEAT 

01:49:39.159 --> 01:49:41.159
SOMEBODY.

01:49:43.064 --> 01:49:49.765
SHE SAID OF THE VIOLENT 
DEMONSTRATIONS. EVERYONE BEWARE.

01:49:49.984 --> 01:49:56.513
THEY WILL NOT STOP BEFORE 
ELECTION DAY AND THEY WILL NOT 

01:49:56.725 --> 01:50:00.479
STOP AFTER ELECTION DAY. THEY 
WILL NOT LET UP. AND THE SHOULD 

01:50:00.723 --> 01:50:08.688
NOT. SUCH RHETORIC CONTINUED 
EVEN AS HUNDREDS OF POLICE 

01:50:08.904 --> 01:50:11.533
OFFICERS ACROSS THE NATION WORK 
SUBJECTED TO VIOLENT ASSAULTS AT

01:50:11.753 --> 01:50:17.933
THE HANDS OF ANGRY MOBS. A MAN 
CLAIMING TO BE INSPIRED BY THE 

01:50:18.150 --> 01:50:20.150
JUNIOR

01:50:22.467 --> 01:50:24.467
SENATOR TO VERMONT CAME DOWN 
HERE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. TO 

01:50:25.059 --> 01:50:28.874
WATCH A SOFTBALL GAME AND KILL 
AS MANY SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN

01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:34.046
AS HE COULD. THAT CANNOT BE 
FORGOTTEN THAT TRUMP DID NOT 

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:39.795
BLAME THE JUNIOR SENATOR. THE 
SENIOR SENATOR FROM MAINE HAS 

01:50:40.007 --> 01:50:44.443
HAD HER HOUSE SURROUNDED BY 
ANGRY MOBS AND PROTESTERS. WHEN 

01:50:44.663 --> 01:50:50.073
IT HAPPENED IT UNNERVED HER. ONE
OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS TWEETED 

01:50:50.859 --> 01:50:53.099
CRIMEA RIVER.

01:51:03.904 --> 01:51:10.560
EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD
BE RETROACTIVELY CENSORED, 

01:51:10.777 --> 01:51:16.435
EXPELLED, PUNISHED, OR IMPEACHED
FOR INCITING VIOLENCE BY THEIR 

01:51:16.654 --> 01:51:19.708
SUPPORTERS. UNLIKE THE LEFT

01:51:23.414 --> 01:51:25.414
, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS 
BEEN CONSISTENT IN HIS 

01:51:25.791 --> 01:51:29.396
OPPOSITION TO MOB VIOLENCE. HE 
OPPOSES IT IN ALL FORMS AND IN 

01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.060
ALL PLACES.

01:51:37.635 --> 01:51:39.836
JUST AS HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT 
THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD SHOULD 

01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:41.803
BE DEPLOYED TO PROTECT AMERICAN 
COMMITTEES OR WHEREVER 

01:51:41.804 --> 01:51:45.752
PROTECTION IS NEEDED. FOR 
DEMOCRATS THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED

01:51:45.967 --> 01:51:53.485
THAT THERE ARE PETITIONS TO MOBS
AND USING THE NATIONAL GUARD 

01:51:53.701 --> 01:51:58.549
DEPENDS ON THE MOBS POLITICAL 
VIEWS NOT ONLY IS THIS CASE 

01:51:59.512 --> 01:52:04.882
WRONG ON THE FACTS. NO 

01:52:09.717 --> 01:52:11.717
OBJECTED. IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL

01:52:16.834 --> 01:52:18.984
. CONGRESS WOULD BE CLAIMING 
THAT THE RIGHT TO DISQUALIFY A 

01:52:19.195 --> 01:52:23.554
PRIVATE CITIZEN NO LONGER A 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, FROM 

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:26.140
RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE WOULD 
TRANSFORM THE SOLEMN IMPEACHMENT

01:52:27.399 --> 01:52:33.713
PROCESS INTO A MECHANISM FOR 
INSERTING CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL 

01:52:33.935 --> 01:52:37.279
OVER WHICH PRIVATE CITIZENS ARE 
AND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RUN FOR 

01:52:37.521 --> 01:52:42.227
PRESIDENT. IN SHORT THIS 
UNPRECEDENTED EFFORT IS NOT 

01:52:42.991 --> 01:52:47.911
ABOUT DEMOCRATS OPPOSING 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE. IT IS ABOUT 

01:52:48.121 --> 01:52:52.147
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO DISQUALIFY 
POLITICAL OPPOSITION

01:52:55.827 --> 01:53:02.796
. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL CANCEL 
CULTURE. IN HISTORY WILL RECORD 

01:53:03.507 --> 01:53:09.397
THIS SHAMEFUL EFFORT TO SMEAR,

01:53:12.273 --> 01:53:16.058
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THAT THE 
75 MILLION AMERICANS WHO VOTED 

01:53:16.705 --> 01:53:24.479
FOR HIM. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR
SUCH A CAMPAIGN OF RETRIBUTION. 

01:53:24.878 --> 01:53:28.483
IT IS TIME FOR UNITY AND 
HEALING.

01:53:31.983 --> 01:53:37.697
AND FOCUSING ON THE INTEREST OF 
THE NATION AS A WHOLE. WE SHOULD

01:53:37.916 --> 01:53:42.345
ALL BE SEEKING TO COOL 
TEMPERATURES, CALM PASSIONS, 

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:48.810
RISE ABOVE PARTISAN LINES. THE 
SENATE SHOULD REJECT

01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:55.497
THE DEVICE OF AN 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL EFFORT AND 

01:53:55.498 --> 01:54:00.889
ALLOW THE NATION TO MOVE FORWARD
. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 

01:54:01.103 --> 01:54:07.808
THREE HOURS OR SO YOU WILL HEAR 
FROM DAVID SCHOEN WHO WILL BE 

01:54:08.021 --> 01:54:13.804
TALKING ABOUT  DUE PROCESS. I 
WILL RETURN WITH AN ANALYSIS OF 

01:54:14.019 --> 01:54:19.899
WHY THE FIRST AMENDMENT MUST BE 
PROPERLY APPLIED. AND THEN

01:54:24.799 --> 01:54:27.172
BRUCE CASTOR WILL DISCUSS THE 
LAW AS IT APPLIES TO THE SPEECH 

01:54:27.797 --> 01:54:32.623
OF  JANUARY 6th. AND THEN WE 
WILL BE PLEASED TO ANSWER YOUR 

01:54:32.837 --> 01:54:35.764
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.  

01:55:25.888 --> 01:55:27.888
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:55:29.396 --> 01:55:31.396
GOOD AFTERNOON, SENATORS

01:55:34.479 --> 01:55:36.974
. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE 
DAY MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL 

01:55:37.193 --> 01:55:39.392
EXPLAIN THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THE
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT 

01:55:39.606 --> 01:55:42.618
INCITE THE TERRIBLE RIOTS ON A 
JANUARY 6th.  THEY WILL 

01:55:43.363 --> 01:55:47.926
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE VIOLENCE 
AND LOOTING GOES AGAINST THE LAW

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:51.602
AND ORDER MESSAGE THAT HE 
CONVEYS TO EVERY CITIZEN OF THE 

01:55:51.818 --> 01:55:55.535
UNITED STATES THROUGHOUT HIS 
PRESIDENCY. INCLUDING ON THE 

01:55:55.754 --> 01:56:01.910
TRAN41. FIRST WE WOULD LIKE TO 
DISCUSS THE HATRED, THE 

01:56:02.656 --> 01:56:05.103
POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM THAT HAS 
BROUGHT US HERE TODAY

01:56:09.609 --> 01:56:12.102
. THE HATRED THAT THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS AND OTHERS ON THE LEFT 

01:56:12.315 --> 01:56:14.487
HAVE FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
HAS DRIVEN THEM TO SKIP THE 

01:56:14.697 --> 01:56:19.823
BASIC ELEMENTS OF DUE PROCESS 
AND FAIRNESS. AND TO RUSH AN 

01:56:20.151 --> 01:56:22.151
IMPEACHMENT THROUGH THE HOUSE 
CLAIMING URGENCY.

01:56:26.886 --> 01:56:29.285
THE HOUSE WAITED TO DELIVER THE 
ARTICLES TO THE SENATE FOR TWO 

01:56:29.503 --> 01:56:32.857
WEEKS. ONLY AFTER DEMOCRATS HAD 
SECURED CONTROL OVER THE SENATE.

01:56:33.071 --> 01:56:36.136
CONTRARY TO THEIR CLAIM THAT THE
ONLY REASON THAT THEY HELD IT 

01:56:36.626 --> 01:56:41.934
WAS BECAUSE SENATOR McCONNELL 
WILL NOT ACCEPT THE ARTICLE. IT 

01:56:42.155 --> 01:56:44.155
WAS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY HAD 
CONSIDERED HOLDING THE ARTICLES 

01:56:44.309 --> 01:56:50.057
FOR 100 DAYS, TO PROVIDE 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 

01:56:50.708 --> 01:56:57.749
PATHWAY TO IMPLEMENT HIS AGENDA.
OUR CONSTITUTION AND ANY BASIC 

01:56:58.163 --> 01:57:01.013
FAIRNESS REQUIRES THAT EVERY 
LEGAL PROCESS WITH SIGNIFICANT 

01:57:01.232 --> 01:57:05.683
CONSEQUENCES FOR A PERSON'S LIFE
, INCLUDING IMPEACHMENT REQUIRES

01:57:05.909 --> 01:57:11.035
DUE PROCESS UNDER THE LAW WHICH 
INCLUDES FACT-FINDING AND THE 

01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:13.291
ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEGITIMATE 
RECORD WITHIN

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:20.715
A APPROPRIATE FOUNDATION. EVEN 
LAST YEAR'S IMPEACHMENT HEARING 

01:57:21.116 --> 01:57:23.116
FOLLOWED MONTHS OF INVESTIGATION

01:57:28.433 --> 01:57:30.403
AND EXAMINATION. HERE PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS COUNSEL 

01:57:30.404 --> 01:57:32.404
WERE GIVEN NO OPPORTUNITY TO 
REVIEW EVIDENCE OR QUESTION THE 

01:57:32.581 --> 01:57:36.244
PROPRIETY. THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT 
FOR A SNAP IMPEACHMENT IN THIS 

01:57:36.762 --> 01:57:43.663
CASE WAS ONE EXAMPLE OF THE 
DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS. MORE 

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:51.181
VITALLY SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLE WAS 
THE DENIAL OF ANY OPPORTUNITY 

01:57:51.582 --> 01:57:53.992
EVER TO TEST THE INTEGRITY OF 
THE EVIDENCE OFFERED AGAINST

01:57:57.679 --> 01:57:59.679
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND A 
PROCEEDING SEEKING TO BAR HIM 

01:57:59.836 --> 01:58:03.108
FROM EVER HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE 
AGAIN, THAT SEEKS TO 

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:09.661
DISENFRANCHISE 75 MILLION 
AMERICAN VOTERS. 

01:58:10.715 --> 01:58:13.113
THIS WEEK COUNTLESS NEWS OUTLETS
REPEATED THAT THE DEMOCRAT 

01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:19.213
TALKING POINT ABOUT THE POWER OF
NEVER BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGE. LET 

01:58:19.428 --> 01:58:25.098
ME ASK YOU THIS, WHY WAS THIS 
FOOTAGE NEVER SEEN BEFORE? 

01:58:25.437 --> 01:58:31.016
SHOULDN'T THE SUBJECT OF AN 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL HAVE THE RIGHT

01:58:31.230 --> 01:58:37.139
TO SEE THE NEW EVIDENCE AGAINST 
HIM? AND THE RIOT AN ATTACK ON 

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:39.844
THIS VERY

01:58:42.166 --> 01:58:44.166
BUILDING WAS A MAJOR EVENT THAT 
SHOCKED AND IMPACTED ALL 

01:58:44.314 --> 01:58:46.165
AMERICANS. SHOULDN'T THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THIS 

01:58:46.166 --> 01:58:48.484
FOOTAGE AS SOON AS IT WAS 
AVAILABLE? FOR WHAT POSSIBLE 

01:58:48.708 --> 01:58:53.332
REASON DID THEY WITHHOLD IT FROM
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 

01:58:53.552 --> 01:58:55.552
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
LAWYERS? FOR POLITICAL GAIN?

01:59:00.043 --> 01:59:02.478
HOW DID THEY GET IT? HOW ARE 
THEY RELEASING IT? IT'S EVIDENT 

01:59:02.697 --> 01:59:08.808
IN HUNDREDS OF CASES AGAINST THE
RIOTERS. WHY WASN'T REALLY 

01:59:09.022 --> 01:59:11.089
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT  IS 

01:59:11.352 --> 01:59:14.919
IT THE RESULT OF A RUSHED SNAP 
IMPEACHMENT FOR POLITICAL GAIN 

01:59:15.137 --> 01:59:19.644
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS? HOUSE 
MANAGER RASKIN TOLD US THAT YOUR

01:59:20.304 --> 01:59:25.614
JOB  AS A JUROR IS A FACT 
INTENSIVE JOB.

01:59:29.492 --> 01:59:32.027
OF COURSE OF SEVERAL OF THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE TOLD YOU WE 

01:59:32.237 --> 01:59:34.450
STILL DO NOT HAVE THE FACTS. 
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI ON 

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:39.851
FEBRUARY 2nd CALLED FOR A 9/11 
STYLE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE 

01:59:40.066 --> 01:59:46.150
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6th.  
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI SAID 

01:59:46.398 --> 01:59:49.346
THAT THE COMMISSION IS NEEDED TO
DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF THE 

01:59:49.562 --> 01:59:51.562
EVENTS.

01:59:53.049 --> 01:59:55.204
SHE SAYS IT HERSELF. IF AN 
INQUIRY OF THAT MAGNITUDE IS 

01:59:55.444 --> 01:59:58.563
NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES 
OF THE RIOT, AND IT MAY VERY 

01:59:59.297 --> 02:00:04.259
WELL BE. HOW CAN THE SAME 
DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CERTAINTY 

02:00:04.474 --> 02:00:09.757
NEEDED TO BRING ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT, AND BLAME THE RIOTS

02:00:09.982 --> 02:00:11.982
ON PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THEY 
DO NOT. THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

02:00:12.168 --> 02:00:16.419
FACING A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF 
EVIDENCE TURNED TO PRESS REPORTS

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:19.176
AND RUMORS.

02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:23.270
CLAIMS IT WOULD NEVER MEET THE 
EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS OF ANY 

02:00:23.486 --> 02:00:26.125
COURT. THEY RELIED ON THE

02:00:29.817 --> 02:00:31.817
WORDS OF ANDREW FEINBERG. 
REPORTER WHO WORKED FOR SPUTNIK,

02:00:32.218 --> 02:00:39.945
THE RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA OUTLET. 
THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH

02:00:45.866 --> 02:00:48.282
HOUSE MANAGERS RELY ON MEDIA 
REPORTS SHOCKED ME AS I SAT IN 

02:00:48.501 --> 02:00:52.253
THIS CHAMBER AND LISTEN TO THIS.
BUT THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW 

02:00:52.469 --> 02:00:54.469
YET ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

02:01:01.716 --> 02:01:04.964
EXPECT MAJOR NEWS NETWORKS 
INCLUDING FOX NEWS. 

02:01:04.965 --> 02:01:06.965
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPORTED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:01:17.552 --> 02:01:20.628
MEDIA REPORTS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ACCORDING TO REPORTS. 

02:01:23.650 --> 02:01:29.144
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS ANY TRIAL LAWYER WILL TELL
YOU REPORTING IS A USE IT IS HIM

02:01:29.372 --> 02:01:31.372
FOR I HAVE NO REAL EVIDENCE

02:01:35.426 --> 02:01:38.379
. IS NOT THE STANDARD IN ANY 
AMERICAN SETTING WHERE ANY 

02:01:38.597 --> 02:01:43.518
SEMBLANCE OF DUE PROCESS OF THE 
ACCUSE.

02:01:46.942 --> 02:01:51.574
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. IT IS 
AS RELIABLE AS I GOOGLED THIS 

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.240
FOR YOU.

02:01:58.591 --> 02:02:02.197
YOU GET MORE DUE PROCESS WHEN 
YOU FIGHT A PARKING TICKET

02:02:08.688 --> 02:02:10.688
.

02:02:12.193 --> 02:02:14.244
IT REQUIRES AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
TEST THE INTEGRITY, THE 

02:02:14.455 --> 02:02:20.751
CREDIBILITY, THE RELIABILITY OF 
THE EVIDENCE. HERE OF COURSE 

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:23.539
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
WAS DENIED ANY SUCH OPPORTUNITY

02:02:26.611 --> 02:02:29.213
. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS
SIGNIFICANT REASON TO DOUBT THE 

02:02:29.822 --> 02:02:34.084
EVIDENCE THAT HOUSE MANAGERS 
HAVE PUT BEFORE US. WHEN HE SAY 

02:02:34.299 --> 02:02:39.665
THIS CLEARLY. WE HAVE REASON TO 
BELIEVE THAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

02:02:39.893 --> 02:02:44.895
MANIPULATED EVIDENCE AND 
SELECTIVELY EDITED FOOTAGE. IF 

02:02:45.117 --> 02:02:47.716
THEY DID AND THIS WAS A COURT OF
LAW THEY WOULD FACE SANCTIONS 

02:02:48.301 --> 02:02:50.301
FROM THE

02:02:52.008 --> 02:02:54.964
JUDGE. I DO NOT RAISE THIS ISSUE
LIGHTLY. IT IS A PRODUCT OF WHAT

02:02:55.177 --> 02:02:58.045
WE HAVE FOUND IN JUST A LIMITED 
TIME THAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE WE 

02:02:58.261 --> 02:03:03.519
FIRST SAW THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED
HERE WITH YOU THIS WEEK. WE HAVE

02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:06.031
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE HOUSE
MANAGERS CRATED FALSE 

02:03:06.247 --> 02:03:10.374
REPRESENTATIONS OF TWEETS, AND 
THE LACK OF DUE PROCESS THAT 

02:03:10.587 --> 02:03:12.587
MEANS THAT THERE WAS NO 
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW OR VERIFY 

02:03:13.084 --> 02:03:19.630
THE ACCURACY. CONSIDER THESE 
FACTS. THE HOUSE MANAGERS PROUD 

02:03:19.873 --> 02:03:22.880
OF THEIR WORK ON THE SNAP 
IMPEACHMENT STAGED NUMEROUS 

02:03:23.097 --> 02:03:25.097
PHOTO SHOOTS OF THEIR 
PREPARATIONS. 

02:03:27.563 --> 02:03:30.975
IN ONE OF THOSE MANAGER RASKIN 
IS SEEN  REVIEWING TWO

02:03:36.899 --> 02:03:39.045
TWEETS SIDE BY SIDE. THE IMAGE 
ON HIS SCREEN SHOWS THAT 

02:03:39.256 --> 02:03:41.161
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD 
RETWEETED ONE OF THOSE TWEETS. 

02:03:41.162 --> 02:03:43.753
NOW MEMBERS OF THE SENATE LET'S 
LOOK CLOSELY AT THE SCREEN. 

02:03:43.962 --> 02:03:47.803
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MANAGER RASKIN
CONSIDERED IT  IMPORTANT

02:03:51.733 --> 02:03:54.088
ENOUGH THAT HE INVITED THE NEW 
YORK TIMES TO WATCH HIM WATCH 

02:03:54.309 --> 02:03:56.309
IT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS 
IMAGE?

02:03:59.451 --> 02:04:01.903
THERE ARE THREE THINGS VERY 
WRONG WITH IT. LOOK AT THE DATE 

02:04:02.116 --> 02:04:06.152
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN ON 
THE BOTTOM OF MANAGER RASKIN 

02:04:06.369 --> 02:04:14.935
SCREEN. IT IS  JANUARY 3rd, 
2020. NOT 2021. WHY IS 

02:04:16.059 --> 02:04:18.059
WRONG?

02:04:21.586 --> 02:04:23.747
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A REAL 
SCREENSHOT THAT HE IS WORKING 

02:04:23.969 --> 02:04:26.807
WITH. THIS IS A RE-CREATION OF A
TWEET AND YOU GOT THE DATE WRONG

02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:29.303
WHEN YOU MANUFACTURED THE 
GRAPHIC. YOU DID NOT DISCLOSE 

02:04:29.519 --> 02:04:31.519
THAT THIS WAS A MANUFACTURED 
GRAPHIC.

02:04:34.786 --> 02:04:37.037
AND THE HOUSE MANAGERS COPIER 
BEFORE SHOWING IT ON THE SENATE 

02:04:37.259 --> 02:04:39.020
FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU NEVER SOUGHT WHEN IT WAS 

02:04:39.021 --> 02:04:42.272
PRESENTED TO YOU. THAT IS NOT 
ALL

02:04:45.755 --> 02:04:48.740
. THEY DID NOT FIX THIS ONE. 
LOOK AT THE BLUE CHECK MARK NEXT

02:04:48.956 --> 02:04:53.107
TO THE TWITTER USERNAME OF THE 
ACCOUNT RETWEETED BY THE 

02:04:53.324 --> 02:04:55.324
PRESIDENT THAT INDICATES OF THIS
IS A VERIFIED ACCOUNT. GIVEN 

02:04:55.516 --> 02:04:59.661
THAT BLUE CHECK BY TWITTER 
SHOWING THAT IS RUN BY A PUBLIC 

02:04:59.883 --> 02:05:04.240
FIGURE. THE PROBLEM? THE USERS 
REAL ACCOUNT IS NOT 

02:05:05.094 --> 02:05:08.184
HAS NO BLUE CHECK MARK AS YOU 
CAN SEE. WERE YOU TRYING TO MAKE

02:05:08.401 --> 02:05:13.228
HER ACCOUNT SEE MORE SIGNIFICANT
OR YOU JUST SLOPPY? WE HAD DUE 

02:05:13.444 --> 02:05:18.905
PROCESS WE WOULD KNOW THE TRUTH.
THAT IS NOT ALL THAT IS WRONG 

02:05:19.117 --> 02:05:24.487
WITH THIS ONE TWEET. THE HOUSE 
MANAGER SHOWED THIS TWEET AND 

02:05:24.706 --> 02:05:29.131
EMPHASIZED THAT THIS TWEET 
REFLECTED A CALL TO ARMS. AND 

02:05:29.348 --> 02:05:32.426
TOLD YOU REPEATEDLY THAT THIS 
WAS A PROMISE TO CALL IN THE 

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:38.604
CALVARY ON JANUARY 6th. AND LEAD
YOU TO BELIEVE THAT A TRUMP 

02:05:38.825 --> 02:05:40.750
SUPPORTER  BELIEVE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED ARMED 

02:05:40.751 --> 02:05:47.918
SUPPORTERS AT THE SPEECH ON 
JANUARY 6th. THE CALVARY  READY 

02:05:48.141 --> 02:05:50.950
FOR PHYSICAL COMBAT. THE PROBLEM
IS THE ACTUAL TEXT IS THE 

02:05:51.507 --> 02:05:53.566
OPPOSITE. THE TWEET PROMISE TO 
BRING

02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:04.423
CALVARY. A SYMBOL OF HER 
CHRISTIAN FAITH WITH HER TO THE 

02:06:05.131 --> 02:06:08.556
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. A SYMBOL OF 
FAITH, LOVE, AND PEACE. THEY DO 

02:06:08.769 --> 02:06:14.954
NOT WANT TO READ THE TEXT AND 
BELIEVE WHAT THE TEXT MEANS. YOU

02:06:15.172 --> 02:06:19.025
WILL SEE THIS REPORTED IN THE 
MEDIA LAST NIGHT. WORDS MATTER. 

02:06:19.355 --> 02:06:23.197
BUT THEY SELECTIVELY EDITED THE 
PRESIDENTS WORDS OVER AND OVER 

02:06:23.415 --> 02:06:28.608
AGAIN. THEY MANIPULATED VIDEO 
AND MADE IT APPEAR THAT THE 

02:06:29.304 --> 02:06:32.347
PRESIDENTS WORDS WERE PLAYING TO
A CROWD WHEN THEY WERE NOT. 

02:06:32.591 --> 02:06:37.766
LET'S TAKE A LOOK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER THIS WE ARE GOING TO 

02:06:37.992 --> 02:06:42.504
WALK DOWN, I WILL BE THERE WITH 
YOU. WERE GOING TO WALK DOWN TO 

02:06:42.730 --> 02:06:45.555
THE CAPITOL 

02:06:49.662 --> 02:06:54.957
, AND WE ARE GOING TO CHEER ON 
OUR BRAVE SENATORS AND 

02:06:55.184 --> 02:07:01.290
CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN. AND THEY 
WERE WILL NOT BE CHEERING SO 

02:07:01.504 --> 02:07:05.669
MUCH FOR SOME OF THEM. YOU WILL 
NEVER TAKE BACK OUR

02:07:09.777 --> 02:07:12.297
COUNTRY WITH WEAKNESS. YOU HAVE 
TO SHOW STRENGTH AND YOU HAVE TO

02:07:12.518 --> 02:07:16.761
BE STRONG. WE HAVE COME TO 
DEMAND THAT CONGRESS DO THE 

02:07:17.444 --> 02:07:21.912
RIGHT THING AND ONLY COUNT THE 
ELECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN LAWFULLY

02:07:22.139 --> 02:07:24.139
SLATED.

02:07:27.037 --> 02:07:29.440
I KNOW THAT EVERYONE WILL SOON 
BE MARCHING OVER TO THE CAPITAL 

02:07:30.043 --> 02:07:33.290
BUILDING TO PEACEFULLY AND 
PATRIOTICALLY MAKE YOUR VOICES 

02:07:33.515 --> 02:07:35.515
HEARD.

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:41.808
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND WE ARE GOING TO WALK DOWN
TO THE CAPITOL. THEY SHOWED YOU 

02:07:42.031 --> 02:07:46.197
THAT PART. WHY ARE WE WALKING TO
THE CAPITAL? THEY CUT THAT OFF. 

02:07:46.414 --> 02:07:49.393
BUT TO CHEER ON MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS OF OTHERS PEACEFULLY 

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:54.576
AND PATRIOTICALLY. THE SUPREME 
COURT RULED THAT THERE IS A 

02:07:54.793 --> 02:08:00.921
STANDARD FOR INCITEMENT. WHETHER
IT WAS INTENDED TO PROVOKE ON 

02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:03.149
LAWLESS

02:08:06.046 --> 02:08:08.234
ACTION. GO TO THE CAPITAL AND 
CHEER ON SOME MEMBERS OF 

02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:11.419
CONGRESS BUT NOT OTHERS. THE 
DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARD FOR 

02:08:11.635 --> 02:08:17.624
INCITEMENT SO THEY EDITED IT. WE
HEARD A LOT THIS WEEK ABOUT 

02:08:18.027 --> 02:08:20.027
FIGHT LIKE HELL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY CUT OFF THE VIDEO BEFORE

02:08:20.221 --> 02:08:23.775
THEY SHOWED YOU THE PRESENCE 
OPTIMISTIC AND PATRIOTIC WORDS 

02:08:24.477 --> 02:08:30.378
THAT FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY AFTER.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT LIKE HELL, IF YOU DON'T

02:08:31.432 --> 02:08:34.025
FIGHT LIKE HELL YOU WILL NOT 
HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE. ARE 

02:08:34.242 --> 02:08:36.242
EXCITING

02:08:37.730 --> 02:08:40.322
ADVENTURES AND BOLDEST ENDEAVORS
HAVE NOT YET BEGUN. MY FELLOW 

02:08:40.537 --> 02:08:48.016
AMERICANS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND 
FOR OUR BELOVED COUNTRY. I SAY 

02:08:48.236 --> 02:08:51.084
THIS DESPITE ALL THAT HAS 
HAPPENED. THE BEST IS YET TO 

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:53.320
COME.

02:08:56.627 --> 02:09:02.608
BUT THERE IS A FAMOUS QUOTE LIKE
ONE OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS SET. A

02:09:02.832 --> 02:09:05.764
LIE WILL TRAVEL HALFWAY AROUND 
THE WORLD BEFORE THE TRUTH HAS A

02:09:05.978 --> 02:09:09.490
CHANCE TO PUT ITS SHOES ON. THIS
LIE TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD A 

02:09:10.035 --> 02:09:18.165
FEW TIMES, INTO BITING TALKING 
POINTS. THE THE CHARLOTTESVILLE 

02:09:18.384 --> 02:09:20.384
LIE. FIND PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.

02:09:24.242 --> 02:09:27.164
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THAT HE SAID.
THEY KNEW IT THEN, AND THEY KNOW

02:09:27.379 --> 02:09:30.355
IT NOW. WATCH THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:09:30.571 --> 02:09:35.868
VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. 
PEOPLE IN THAT GROUP, EXCUSE ME.

02:09:36.081 --> 02:09:39.651
I SAW THE SAME PICTURES AS YOU 
DID. YOU HAD PEOPLE IN THAT 

02:09:39.864 --> 02:09:44.997
GROUP THAT WERE THERE TO 
PROTEST. TAKING DOWN A VERY 

02:09:45.214 --> 02:09:48.864
IMPORTANT STATUE AND THE 
RENAMING OF A PART FROM ROBERT E

02:09:49.082 --> 02:09:53.466
LEE TO ANOTHER NAME. GEORGE 
WASHINGTON WAS A SLAVE OWNER

02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:01.836
WILL GEORGE WASHINGTON NOW LOSE 
HIS STATUS? ARE WE GOING TO TAKE

02:10:02.590 --> 02:10:06.850
DOWN STATUES OF GEORGE 
WASHINGTON, HOW ABOUT THOMAS 

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:12.201
JEFFERSON? WHAT YOU THINK OF 
THOMAS JEFFERSON? ARE WE GOING 

02:10:12.419 --> 02:10:14.419
TO TAKE DOWN HIS STATUES

02:10:16.866 --> 02:10:19.647
? DO YOU LIKE HIM? IT'S FINE. 
YOU ARE CHANGING HISTORY AND 

02:10:19.863 --> 02:10:24.555
CULTURE. YOU HAD PEOPLE. I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT WHITE

02:10:26.634 --> 02:10:28.634
THEY SHOULD BE CONDEMNED 
TOTALLY. YOU HAD MANY PEOPLE 

02:10:29.011 --> 02:10:31.647
OTHER THAN WHITE NATIONALISTS 
AND

02:10:37.796 --> 02:10:42.138
NEO NAZIS. YOU ALSO HAD  FIVE 
PEOPLE IN THE OTHER GROUP. JOE 

02:10:42.354 --> 02:10:47.231
ALSO HAD TROUBLEMAKERS, AND YOU 
SEE THEM COME IN THEIR BLACK 

02:10:47.454 --> 02:10:50.766
OUTFITS AND WITH HELMETS AND 
BASEBALL BATS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF

02:10:51.817 --> 02:10:54.045
BAD PEOPLE IN THE OTHER GROUP 
TOO 

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:59.929
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU SAID THAT PRESS HAS 
TREATED A WHITE NATIONALISTS 

02:11:00.345 --> 02:11:01.914
UNFAIRLY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THAT 

02:11:01.915 --> 02:11:08.061
RALLY, IF YOU LOOK, THERE WERE 
PEOPLE PROTESTING VERY QUIETLY. 

02:11:08.462 --> 02:11:10.462
TAKING DOWN THE

02:11:13.344 --> 02:11:16.162
STATUE OF ROBERT E LEE. I'M SURE
THERE WAS SOME BAD ONES IN THAT 

02:11:16.379 --> 02:11:18.979
GROUP THE FOLLOWING DAY IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY HAD SOME ROUGH BAD 

02:11:19.197 --> 02:11:21.197
PEOPLE.

02:11:24.914 --> 02:11:26.914
WHITE NATIONALIST, NEO NAZIS, 
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM. 

02:11:27.116 --> 02:11:31.012
YOU HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
WERE THERE TO INNOCENTLY  

02:11:31.417 --> 02:11:33.790
PROTEST AND LEGALLY PROTEST. I 
DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW, THEY HAD

02:11:34.002 --> 02:11:36.618
A PERMIT, THE OTHER GROUP DID 
NOT. I ONLY TELL YOU THIS. THERE

02:11:37.055 --> 02:11:41.319
ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY. I 
THOUGHT WHAT TOOK PLACE WAS A 

02:11:41.548 --> 02:11:49.694
HORRIBLE MOMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
DOES ANYONE HAVE A FINAL 

02:11:50.658 --> 02:11:54.484
QUESTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS MAY BE THE FIRST TIME 

02:11:54.702 --> 02:11:59.040
THAT THE NEWS NETWORKS PLAYED 
THE FULL REMARKS IN THE CONTEXT 

02:11:59.454 --> 02:12:04.388
COMING TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THAT
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER

02:12:04.606 --> 02:12:06.607
DENOUNCED WHITE SUPREMACY. NOW 
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH. HERE IS 

02:12:07.307 --> 02:12:12.113
ANOTHER EXAMPLE. ONE OF THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS MADE MUCH OF THE 

02:12:12.344 --> 02:12:15.376
PRESIDENTS OMINOUS WORDS THAT 
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PEOPLE TO 

02:12:15.601 --> 02:12:20.338
FIGHT. YOU KNEW WHAT HE MEANT. 
HE MEANT THAT THE CROWD SHOULD 

02:12:20.552 --> 02:12:23.579
DEMAND ACTION FROM CONGRESS AND 
SUPPORT PRIMARY CHALLENGES TO 

02:12:23.797 --> 02:12:28.253
THOSE WHO DO NOT DO WHAT HE 
CONSIDERS TO BE RIGHT.

02:12:31.567 --> 02:12:34.797
PRIMARY CHALLENGES, NOT VIOLENT 
ACTION. I KNOW WHAT HE MEANT 

02:12:35.199 --> 02:12:37.629
BECAUSE I WATCH THE FULL VIDEO. 
AND SO DID THE HOUSE MANAGERS. 

02:12:37.857 --> 02:12:43.009
THEY MANIPULATED HIS WORDS. YOU 
WILL SEE WHERE THEY STOPPED. AND

02:12:43.226 --> 02:12:45.722
TO GIVE IT A VERY DIFFERENT 
MEANING FROM THAT MEANING IT HAS

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.320
IN FULL

02:12:50.031 --> 02:12:52.031
CONTEXT. LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PEOPLE 

02:12:52.624 --> 02:12:57.756
TO FIGHT. HE TOLD THEM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PEOPLE 

02:12:57.968 --> 02:13:04.071
TO FIGHT. IF THEY DON'T FIGHT WE
HAVE TO PRIMARY THE HELL OF THE 

02:13:04.303 --> 02:13:08.697
ONES WHO DON'T FIGHT. WE WILL 
LET YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE. I CAN

02:13:08.916 --> 02:13:14.219
ALREADY TELL YOU FRANKLY. BUT 
THE PEOPLE WHO NEED FIGHT ARE 

02:13:14.436 --> 02:13:16.436
THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:24.487
IT COULDN'T OF BEEN THE URGENCY 
TO GET PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

02:13:24.897 --> 02:13:27.748
OUT OF OFFICE. HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
HELD THE ARTICLES UNTIL HE WAS 

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:29.960
NO LONGER PRESIDENT.

02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:40.157
HATRED ANIMOSITY DIVISION AND 
POLITICAL GAIN. AND FOR HOUSE 

02:13:40.375 --> 02:13:44.210
DEMOCRATS TRUMP SKI IS THE BEST 
TO ATTACK 

02:13:44.211 --> 02:13:49.350
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M TO SAY THIS FOR PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP WHO I WILL BE 

02:13:49.572 --> 02:13:53.906
VOTING TO IMPEACH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T RESPECT THIS 

02:13:54.122 --> 02:13:58.831
PRESIDENT AND I WILL FIGHT EVERY
DAY UNTIL HE IS IMPEACHED

02:14:01.951 --> 02:14:04.321
ARE GROUNDS TO START IMPEACHMENT
PROCEEDINGS

02:14:12.704 --> 02:14:15.728
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I RISE TO CALL FOR THE 
IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF 

02:14:15.942 --> 02:14:20.422
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I CONTINUE TO SAY IMPEACH 

02:14:21.377 --> 02:14:23.377
HIM.

02:14:25.905 --> 02:14:29.713
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE CALLING THE POUND THE 
HOUSE TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT 

02:14:29.932 --> 02:14:33.365
HEARINGS IMMEDIATELY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD VOTE YES FOR 

02:14:33.591 --> 02:14:38.017
IMPEACHMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE'RE GOING GO IN THERE AND 

02:14:38.237 --> 02:14:40.237
IMPEACH HIM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I INTRODUCED

02:14:44.186 --> 02:14:45.495
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT IN JULY 
2017. 

02:14:45.496 --> 02:14:48.196
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE DON'T IMPEACH THIS 
PRESIDENT HE WILL GET 

02:14:48.412 --> 02:14:50.412
RE-ELECTED.

02:14:54.094 --> 02:14:59.794
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS TIME TO BRING 
IMPEACHMENT CHARGES AGAINST HIM.

02:15:02.062 --> 02:15:05.243
BUT MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT HE 
DESERVES IMPEACHMENT.

02:15:10.795 --> 02:15:16.228
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CAN IMPEACH HIM EVERY DAY 
OF THE WEEK FOR ANYTHING HE 

02:15:16.448 --> 02:15:19.150
DOES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT SAME HATRED AND ANGER 

02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:24.980
HAS LED HOUSE MANAGERS TO IGNORE
THEIR OWN WORDS AND ACTIONS AND

02:15:27.657 --> 02:15:29.657
SET A DANGEROUS DOUBLE STANDARD.
THEY SPOKE ABOUT RHETORIC AND 

02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:34.511
THE DRUMBEAT OF HEATED LANGUAGE.
I'M SURE EVERYONE WATCHING 

02:15:34.736 --> 02:15:41.873

02:27:43.584 --> 02:27:47.217
UPRISINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, 
MAYBE THERE WILL BE?

02:27:52.349 --> 02:27:56.781

02:29:38.954 --> 02:29:43.007
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-OBJECTION. 10 OF THE 29 
ELECTORAL VOTES CAST BY FLORIDA 

02:29:43.208 --> 02:29:46.466
WERE CAST BY ELECTORS THAT FULLY
CERTIFIED. 

02:29:46.467 --> 02:29:52.358
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THE CORRECTION IN WRITING?
AND SIGNED ONLY BY THE MEMBER OF

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:54.197
THE THE PURPOSE OF THE DIPS AND 
SENATOR? 

02:29:54.198 --> 02:29:56.198
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN THAT CASE, THE

02:30:02.913 --> 02:30:04.913
OBJECTION TO THAT." 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I AM BACK TO 

02:30:04.943 --> 02:30:06.943
THE CERTIFICATE FROM SIGNATURE 
ON THE GROUNDS OF THE ELECTORAL 

02:30:06.979 --> 02:30:08.191
VOTE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE. 

02:30:08.192 --> 02:30:10.640
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MAY I OBJECT TO THIS TICKET 
FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

02:30:10.841 --> 02:30:12.841
BASED ON VIOLATIONS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE IN THE 

02:30:12.945 --> 02:30:14.292
JOINT SESSION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I OBJECT? PEOPLE ARE 

02:30:14.293 --> 02:30:18.961
HORRIFIED BY THE OVERWHELMING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SECTION 18 OF THE UNITED 

02:30:19.723 --> 02:30:21.723
STATES CODE

02:30:27.905 --> 02:30:29.728
PROHIBITS DEBATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I OBJECT TO THE COUNTING OF 

02:30:29.729 --> 02:30:31.346
THE ELECTORAL VOTES OF THE STATE
OF OHIO. 

02:30:31.347 --> 02:30:33.742
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EFFECT TO THE CERTIFICATE TO 
GOVERNMENT. THE ELECTORS WERE 

02:30:33.929 --> 02:30:35.929
NOT

02:30:39.475 --> 02:30:41.309
LAWFULLY CERTIFIED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO ¬15 FROM THE STATE OF 

02:30:41.310 --> 02:30:42.726
NORTH CAROLINA TO THE MASSIVE 
VOTER SUPPRESSION. 

02:30:42.727 --> 02:30:45.790
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO DEBATE. 

02:30:45.791 --> 02:30:47.350
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;-OBJECTION TO THE ELECTORAL 
VOTES. 

02:30:47.351 --> 02:30:49.351
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:30:51.952 --> 02:30:55.196
THE EVICTION IS IN WRITING AND I
DON'T CARE THAT IT IS NOT SIGNED

02:30:55.439 --> 02:30:58.688
BY A MEMBER OF THE SENATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DO NOT WISH TO DEBATE, IT 

02:30:58.937 --> 02:31:02.294
WAS TO ASK IS THERE ONE UNITED 
STATES SENATOR WHO WILL JOIN ME 

02:31:02.490 --> 02:31:07.108
IN THE SUBJECT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE OBJECTION IS SIGNED BY A 

02:31:07.310 --> 02:31:10.486
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE BUT NOT YET 
A MEMBER OF THE SENATE. 

02:31:10.487 --> 02:31:12.487
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS OVER.

02:31:15.845 --> 02:31:17.845
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WENT HOUSE MANAGERS REALIZED 
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTUAL WORDS 

02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:21.502
COULD NOT HAVE INCITED THE RIOT,
AS YOU ALLEGED IN YOUR ARTICLE 

02:31:21.685 --> 02:31:26.418
OF IMPEACHMENT, YOU ATTEMPTED TO
PREVENT. HE SAID THAT RAISING 

02:31:26.676 --> 02:31:28.882
THE ISSUE OF ELECTION SECURITY 
AND CASTING DOUBT ON THE 

02:31:29.138 --> 02:31:31.390
PROPRIETY OF OUR ELECTIONS WAS 
DANGEROUS. ONE OF THE HOUSE 

02:31:31.694 --> 02:31:34.798
MANAGERS TOLD YOU THIS IS NOT 
ABOUT THE WORDS MR. TRUMP USED 

02:31:34.983 --> 02:31:38.927
IN ISOLATION, RATHER IT IS ABOUT
THE BIG LIE.

02:31:42.852 --> 02:31:45.810
PLAN THAT THE ELECTION WAS 
STOLEN. THE HOUSE MANAGERS

02:31:50.197 --> 02:31:55.023
TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS THE BIG LIE
THAT INTO THE RIGHT AND THAT THE

02:31:55.295 --> 02:31:58.155
BIG LIE WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
CLEAN THAT THE ELECTION WAS NOT 

02:31:58.387 --> 02:32:01.437
A FAIR ELECTION THAT THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN. CLAIMING 

02:32:01.705 --> 02:32:07.777
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN, YOU 
WERE TOLD, ARE WORDS THAT ARE 

02:32:08.126 --> 02:32:11.735
INSIGHTFUL TO A FOLLOWERS AND 
CAUSED PEOPLE TO RESPOND 

02:32:12.176 --> 02:32:15.179
VIOLENTLY. CLAIMING THE ELECTION
WAS STOLEN OR NOT LEGITIMATE 

02:32:15.518 --> 02:32:18.603
SOMETHING THAT A CANDIDATE 
SHOULD NEVER DO BECAUSE HE OR 

02:32:18.976 --> 02:32:23.755
SHE KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW THAT 
SUCH A CLAIM AND SUCH WORDS CAN 

02:32:24.012 --> 02:32:27.308
ACTUALLY INCITE VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION, YOU ARE TOLD. IT 

02:32:27.678 --> 02:32:31.778
SEEMS THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
POSITION MUST BE A BIT NARROWER 

02:32:32.166 --> 02:32:35.867
THAN THAT. THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
POSITION REALLY IS THAT WHEN 

02:32:36.292 --> 02:32:38.855
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE
CLAIM AN ELECTION IS STOLEN OR 

02:32:39.153 --> 02:32:41.153
THAT THE ONE IS LEGITIMATE, IT 
CONSTITUTES INCITING 

02:32:41.248 --> 02:32:44.245
INSURRECTION AND THE CANDIDATE 
SHOULD KNOW IT. DEMOCRATIC PARTY

02:32:44.652 --> 02:32:47.205
CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC ELECTIVE 
OFFICE ARE PERFECTLY ENTITLED TO

02:32:47.601 --> 02:32:52.691
CLAIM THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN OR
THAT A WINNER IS LEGITIMATE OR 

02:32:52.905 --> 02:32:56.519
TO MAKE ANY OTHER OUTRAGEOUS 
CLAIMS HE CAN. IT IS THEIR 

02:32:56.849 --> 02:33:01.828
ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DO SO. AND IT 
IS THEIR ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO SELL 

02:33:02.122 --> 02:33:05.541
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THERE IS
ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE 

02:33:05.844 --> 02:33:07.844
CLAIM. DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES CAN
CLAIM AN ELECTION WAS DONE 

02:33:08.079 --> 02:33:11.188
BECAUSE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION OR 
THAT WITHOUT ANY EXPIRATION OF 

02:33:11.585 --> 02:33:15.849
ALL AND THAT IS PERFECTLY OKAY 
AND THAT IN ANY WAY INCITEMENT 

02:33:16.209 --> 02:33:18.748
TO INSURRECTION. SOMEHOW IN 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES PUBLICLY 

02:33:19.102 --> 02:33:23.982
DECRY AN ELECTION AS A STONE OR 
ILLEGITIMATE, IT IS NEVER A BIG 

02:33:24.386 --> 02:33:29.285
LIE. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 
YEARS. CAN YOU IMAGINE TELLING 

02:33:29.657 --> 02:33:33.052
YOUR SUPPORTERS THAT THE ONLY 
WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY LOSE IS 

02:33:33.471 --> 02:33:37.576
IF AN AMERICAN ELECTION WAS A 
REGULAR AND STOLEN FROM YOU? ASK

02:33:37.818 --> 02:33:42.018
YOURSELF WHETHER YOU HAVE EVER 
SEEN ANYONE AT ANY LEVEL OF 

02:33:42.407 --> 02:33:47.630
GOVERNMENT MAKE THE SAME CLAIM 
ABOUT THEIR OWN ELECTION? 

02:33:47.631 --> 02:33:53.465
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF STACEY ABRAMS DIDN'T WIN 
IN GEORGIA, THEY STOLE IT. IT IS

02:33:53.666 --> 02:33:56.915
CLEAR. I SAY THAT PUBLICLY, IT 
IS CLEAR. 

02:33:56.916 --> 02:33:59.569
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN RUN THE BEST 
CAMPAIGN, YOU CAN EVEN BECOME 

02:34:00.062 --> 02:34:03.164
THE NOMINEE. YOU CAN EVEN HAVE 
THE ELECTION STOLEN FROM YOU. 

02:34:03.357 --> 02:34:06.190
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE KNOWS HE IS AN 
ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. HE 

02:34:06.378 --> 02:34:10.934
KNOWS. HE KNOWS THAT THERE WERE 
A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY

02:34:11.178 --> 02:34:13.370
THE ELECTION TURNED OUT THE WAY 
IT DID. 

02:34:13.371 --> 02:34:16.675
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VOTES REMAIN TO BE COUNTED. 
THERE ARE VOICES WAITING TO BE 

02:34:16.863 --> 02:34:18.863
HEARD.

02:34:26.367 --> 02:34:29.223
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WILL NOT CONCEDE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RESPECT WITH WORKING, AND I 

02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:31.581
RESPECT THE ISSUES YOU ARE 
RAISING. YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING 

02:34:31.785 --> 02:34:33.807
THE QUESTION. YOU ARE NOT USING 
THE WORD LEGITIMATE. 

02:34:33.808 --> 02:34:35.937
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE ARE STILL LEGITIMATE 
CONCERNS OVER THE INTEGRITY OF 

02:34:36.179 --> 02:34:38.624
OUR ELECTIONS AND ENSURING THE 
PRINCIPLE OF ONE PERSON, ONE 

02:34:38.915 --> 02:34:40.915
VOTE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AGREE WITH TENS OF MILLIONS

02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:44.014
OF AMERICANS WHO ARE VERY 
WORRIED THAT ONE DAY CAST A 

02:34:44.255 --> 02:34:46.908
BALLOT ON AN ELECTRONIC VOTING 
MACHINE, THAT THERE IS NO PAPER 

02:34:47.170 --> 02:34:49.170
TRAIL

02:34:51.965 --> 02:34:53.922
TO RECORD THAT FOOD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CONSTANTLY SHIFTING VOTE 

02:34:53.923 --> 02:34:59.072
TALLIES IN OHIO AND 
MALFUNCTIONING ELECTRONIC 

02:34:59.268 --> 02:35:03.149
MACHINES, WHICH MAY NOT HAVE 
PAPER RECEIPTS HAVE LED TO 

02:35:03.369 --> 02:35:06.972
ADDITIONAL LOSS OF CONFIDENCE BY
THE PUBLIC. THIS IS THEIR ONLY 

02:35:07.419 --> 02:35:10.649
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DEBATE 
WHILE THE COUNTRY IS LISTENING. 

02:35:11.058 --> 02:35:14.445
AND IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:35:19.781 --> 02:35:22.205
HOUSE MANAGER CASTRO NO LONGER 
HAD TO TRY TO IMAGINE IT THANKS 

02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:24.790
TO THE

02:35:31.580 --> 02:35:33.580
DISTINGUISHED SENATOR AND 
OTHERS. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE 

02:35:33.581 --> 02:35:35.990
THIS WAY. THE DEMOCRATS PROMISED
UNITY. THEY PROMISED TO DELIVER 

02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:38.939
THE VERY COVID-19 RELIEF IN THE 
FORM OF $2000.00 STIMULUS CHECKS

02:35:39.196 --> 02:35:41.525
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED FOR.
THEY SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO 

02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.363
THEIR OWN WORDS OF THE PAST. I 
LEAVE YOU WITH THE WISE WORDS OF

02:35:45.638 --> 02:35:47.755
CONGRESSMAN JERRY NADLER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE EFFECT OF IMPEACHMENT IS 

02:35:48.019 --> 02:35:50.019
TO

02:35:57.976 --> 02:36:00.321
OVERTURN THE POPULAR WILL OF THE
VOTERS. WE MUST NOT OVERTURN AN 

02:36:00.542 --> 02:36:03.448
ELECTION AND REMOVE A PRESIDENT 
FROM OFFICE EXCEPT TO DEFEND OUR

02:36:03.683 --> 02:36:05.546
SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT OR OTHER 
CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES AGAINST

02:36:05.547 --> 02:36:07.842
A TIRED THREAT. WE MUST NOT DO 
SO WITHOUT AN OVERWHELMING 

02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.540
CONSENSUS OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. THERE MUST NEVER BE IN A

02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:12.846
REALLY WANTED IMPEACHMENT OR 
IMPEACHMENT SUPPORTED BY ONE OF 

02:36:13.105 --> 02:36:15.443
OUR MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES AND 
OPPOSED BY THE OTHER. SUCH 

02:36:15.679 --> 02:36:17.679
IMPEACHMENT WILL PRODUCE THE 
DIVISIVENESS AND BITTERNESS IN 

02:36:17.803 --> 02:36:20.554
OUR POLITICS FOR YEARS TO COME 
AND WILL CALL INTO QUESTION THE 

02:36:20.839 --> 02:36:22.870
VERY LEGITIMACY OF OUR POLITICAL
INSTITUTIONS. THE AMERICAN 

02:36:23.069 --> 02:36:24.782
PEOPLE HAVE HEARD THE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE 

02:36:24.783 --> 02:36:27.107
PRESIDENT AND THE OVERWHELMINGLY
OPPOSED IMPEACHING HIM. THEY 

02:36:27.301 --> 02:36:29.560
ELECTED PRESIDENT CLINTON, THEY 
STILL SUPPORT HIM, WE HAVE NO 

02:36:29.776 --> 02:36:32.203
RIGHT TO OVERTURN THE CONSIDERED
JUDGMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

02:36:35.141 --> 02:36:37.141
MR. SPEAKER, THE CASE AGAINST 
THE

02:36:40.225 --> 02:36:42.567
PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN MADE. 
THERE IS FAR FROM SUFFICIENT 

02:36:42.793 --> 02:36:46.325
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE 
ALLEGATIONS AND ALLEGATIONS, 

02:36:46.599 --> 02:36:48.881
EVEN IF PROVEN TRUE, DO NOT RISE
TO THE LEVEL OF IMPEACHABLE 

02:36:49.147 --> 02:36:51.147
OFFENSES. MR. SPEAKER, THIS IS 
CLEARLY A

02:36:56.078 --> 02:36:58.596
ARTISAN RAILROAD JOB. THE SAME 
PEOPLE WHO DID THEY TELL US WE 

02:36:58.875 --> 02:37:02.811
MUST IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT FOR 
LYING UNDER OATH ALMOST TO A 

02:37:03.169 --> 02:37:07.033
PERSON FOR HIS PLEASURE TO 
REELECT THE SPEAKER, WHO HAD 

02:37:07.376 --> 02:37:11.135
JUST ADMITTED LYING TO CONGRESS 
IN AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING. THE 

02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:14.967
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AND
THEY WILL NOT FORGET. YOU MAY 

02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:19.757
HAVE THE VOTES, YOU MAY HAVE THE
MUSCLE, BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE 

02:37:20.145 --> 02:37:22.145
LEGITIMACY OF A

02:37:24.788 --> 02:37:26.788
NATIONAL CONSENSUS OR A 
CONSTITUTIONAL IMPERATIVE. THIS 

02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:31.488
PERSON COULD TALK WILL GO DOWN 
IN INFAMY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

02:37:32.067 --> 02:37:36.104
NATION. THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER, I
YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY 

02:37:36.578 --> 02:37:38.578
TIME.

02:37:58.224 --> 02:38:05.339
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN, 
SENATORS. MR. PRESIDENT. 

02:38:06.346 --> 02:38:10.228
ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS 
FOR PURPOSES OF THIS FREE SPEECH

02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:15.832
ANALYSIS. FIRST, DOES THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION 

02:38:16.165 --> 02:38:19.622
APPLY IN THIS CHAMBER TO THESE 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS? SECOND,

02:38:20.253 --> 02:38:27.724
IF IT DOES, DO THE WORDS SPOKEN 
BY MR. TRUMP AT THEIR LIPS ON 

02:38:27.976 --> 02:38:32.994
JANUARY 6th MEET THE DEFINITION 
OF CONSTITUTIONAL INCITEMENT SO 

02:38:33.379 --> 02:38:35.778
AS TO VOID THE PROTECTIONS 
AFFORDED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT?

02:38:36.611 --> 02:38:40.010
I WILL EXPLAIN WHY THE ANSWERS 
TO BOTH OF THESE QUESTIONS MUST 

02:38:40.253 --> 02:38:42.253
BE A RESOUNDING YES.

02:38:48.821 --> 02:38:50.806
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT MUST CERTAINLY APPLY 

02:38:50.807 --> 02:38:52.873
TO THESE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS
AND MR. TRUMP'S SPEECH DESERVES 

02:38:53.158 --> 02:38:55.158
FULL PROTECTION UNDER THE 
AMENDMENT.

02:38:58.357 --> 02:39:02.621
BEFORE GETTING INTO THE LEGAL 
ANALYSIS ON PRELIMINARY 

02:39:02.849 --> 02:39:06.909
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS CASE, SHOULD BE MADE.

02:39:11.604 --> 02:39:14.803
FIRST, THIS CASE UNFORTUNATELY 
IS ABOUT POLITICAL HATRED. IT 

02:39:15.056 --> 02:39:17.056
HAS BECOME VERY CLEAR THAT THE 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS

02:39:22.119 --> 02:39:24.690
HATE DONALD TRUMP. THIS TYPE OF 
POLITICAL HATRED HAS NO PLACE IN

02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:28.717
OUR LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND 
CERTAINLY NO PLACE IN THE LAW.

02:39:32.274 --> 02:39:35.215
THIS HATRED HAS LED TO THE HOUSE
MANAGERS TO MANIPULATE AND 

02:39:35.452 --> 02:39:38.359
SELECTIVELY EDIT MR. TRUMP'S 
SPEECH TO MAKE IT FALSELY APPEAR

02:39:38.636 --> 02:39:43.884
THAT HE SOUGHT TO INCITE THE 
CROWD TO VIOLENTLY ATTACK THE 

02:39:44.069 --> 02:39:47.202
CAPITOL. HE DIDN'T. WE WILL SHOW
YOU WHY.

02:39:51.362 --> 02:39:54.083
THE HATRED HAS ALSO LED THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS TO MAKE SOME 

02:39:54.317 --> 02:39:58.071
ASTOUNDING LEGAL ARGUMENTS. THE 
ASTOUNDINGLY URGE YOU TO 

02:39:58.354 --> 02:40:01.877
DISREGARD YOUR OATH BY IGNORING 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE 

02:40:02.122 --> 02:40:09.054
CONSTITUTION. THEY ALSO IGNORE 
LANDMARK BINDING UNITED STATES 

02:40:09.287 --> 02:40:12.438
SUPREME COURT CASES, PRECEDENT.

02:40:16.554 --> 02:40:18.554
BOTH OF WHICH HOLD THAT 
UNEQUIVOCALLY

02:40:25.485 --> 02:40:27.485
ELECTED OFFICIALS OF COURSE 
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO ENGAGE

02:40:27.597 --> 02:40:29.981
IN THE EXACT TYPE OF POLITICAL 
SPEECH WHICH MR. TRUMP'S ENGAGED

02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:32.811
IN. I WAS SHOCKED THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS NOT ONLY SPENT A MERE 

02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:38.562
THREE PAGES ON THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT ANALYSIS AND THEIR 

02:40:38.845 --> 02:40:41.060
TRIAL MAN BUT YESTERDAY, THEY 
SPENT A MERE 10 MINUTES AT THE 

02:40:41.246 --> 02:40:47.423
END OF THEIR CASE AS A THROW 
AWAY. WHAT WE HAVE READ AND WHAT

02:40:47.624 --> 02:40:54.539
WE HAVE HEARD IS DEVOID OF ANY 
CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS. FOR 

02:40:54.739 --> 02:40:57.516
LESS THAN I WOULD EXPECT FROM A 
FIRST YEAR LAW STUDENT.

02:41:01.044 --> 02:41:10.189
THEY LEFT OUT LANDMARK CASES, 
TOTAL INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY. 

02:41:10.585 --> 02:41:12.585
FINALLY, HATRED IS AT THE HEART 
OF THE

02:41:16.679 --> 02:41:18.298
HOUSE MANAGERS FRIVOLOUS 
ATTEMPTS TO BLAME DONALD TRUMP 

02:41:18.299 --> 02:41:20.330
FOR THE CRIMINAL ACTS OF THE 
RIOTERS BASED ON DOUBLE HEARSAY 

02:41:20.531 --> 02:41:25.971
STATEMENTS OF FRINGE RIGHT-WING 
GROUPS, BASED ON NO REAL 

02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:28.612
EVIDENCE OTHER THAN RANK 
SPECULATION.

02:41:33.327 --> 02:41:37.592
HATRED IS A DANGEROUS THING. WE 
ALL HAVE TO WORK TO OVERCOME IT.

02:41:37.806 --> 02:41:41.001
HATRED SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE IN 
THIS CHAMBER, IN THESE 

02:41:41.185 --> 02:41:43.185
PROCEEDINGS.

02:41:45.730 --> 02:41:51.207
THE SECOND OBSERVATION. THE 
SENATE IS PRESENTED WITH 

02:41:51.609 --> 02:41:53.798
EXTRAORDINARY TASKS SITTING IN 
JUDGMENT OF A FORMER PRESIDENT 

02:41:53.984 --> 02:41:55.984
WORDS

02:42:00.143 --> 02:42:02.372
IN A SPEECH THAT HE GAVE AT A 
POLITICAL EVENT. THE HOUSE 

02:42:02.586 --> 02:42:06.638
MANAGERS ACCUSE MR. TRUMP OF 
USING HIS WORDS TO INSIGHT THE 

02:42:06.851 --> 02:42:10.305
HORRIFIC EVENTS AT THE CAPITOL 
ON JANUARY 6th. YESTERDAY THEY 

02:42:10.508 --> 02:42:12.673
GIVE YOU A NEW AND NOVEL 
STANDARD OF INCITEMENT

02:42:16.593 --> 02:42:18.422
WITH AN ELEMENT OF 
FORESEEABILITY, A NEGLIGENCE 

02:42:18.423 --> 02:42:22.812
CONCEPT. THEY CITE ZERO CASE LAW
. THEY MADE IT UP.

02:42:29.591 --> 02:42:31.232
THIS TASK OF APPLYING A 
COMPLETELY MADE-UP LEGAL 

02:42:31.233 --> 02:42:33.376
STANDARD OF INCITEMENT TO 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING IS TRULY 

02:42:33.561 --> 02:42:35.561
AN UNPRECEDENTED TASK FOR THE 
SENATE

02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:41.140
. THAT IS SOMETHING THE SENATE 
MUST SERIOUSLY CONSIDER WHEN 

02:42:41.213 --> 02:42:43.213
DECIDING THE ISSUE.

02:42:48.287 --> 02:42:50.320
DO YOU WANT TO CREATE A 
PRECEDENT WHERE THE SENATE WILL 

02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:53.974
BE TASKED WITH SITTING IN 
JUDGMENT AS TO THE MEANING AND 

02:42:54.192 --> 02:42:57.597
IMPLIED INTENT OF A PRESIDENT'S 
WORDS? OR WORDS OF ANY ELECTED 

02:42:57.781 --> 02:42:59.781
OFFICIAL?

02:43:03.323 --> 02:43:05.554
WILL THAT ALLOW AND MAYBE INTO 
IT A MAJORITY PARTY TO WEAPON 

02:43:05.753 --> 02:43:09.004
EYES THE AWESOME POWER OF 
IMPEACHMENT AGAINST THE MINORITY

02:43:09.205 --> 02:43:11.205
TO SUPPRESS A POINT OF VIEW?

02:43:17.132 --> 02:43:19.165
WILL THE SENATE THEN HAVE TO 
DEAL WITH CONSTANT ARTICLES OF 

02:43:19.365 --> 02:43:22.413
IMPEACHMENT BY A MAJORITY PARTY,
ACCUSING MINORITY PRESIDENTS OR 

02:43:22.614 --> 02:43:25.212
OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS OF 
SO-CALLED INSIGHTFUL OR FALSE 

02:43:25.398 --> 02:43:33.328
SPEECHES? YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS
WOULD LEAD. SADLY, WE HAVE ALL 

02:43:33.511 --> 02:43:35.511
SEEN THE

02:43:38.658 --> 02:43:41.948
POLITICAL RHETORIC FOR THE PAST 
FEW YEARS. WE HAVE ALL BEEN 

02:43:42.146 --> 02:43:45.397
WITNESSES TO MANY INCENDIARY 
WORDS BY OUR OFFICIALS AT 

02:43:45.596 --> 02:43:50.136
POLITICAL EVENTS BROADCAST OVER 
THE MEDIA INTERNET AND EACH OF 

02:43:50.813 --> 02:43:54.448
THOSE INCIDENCES, WILL THERE NOW
BE SENATE IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS?

02:43:58.193 --> 02:44:04.079
ONE LAST OBSERVATION. WE AGREE 
WITH THE HOUSE MANAGERS, CONTEXT

02:44:04.843 --> 02:44:09.698
DOES INDEED MATTER. THE 
INFLAMMATORY LETTER FROM OUR

02:44:15.048 --> 02:44:17.081
ELECTED OFFICIALS MUST BE PART 
OF THE LARGER CONTEXT OF MR. 

02:44:17.282 --> 02:44:19.282
TRUMP'S SPEECH AT THEIR LIPS ON 
JANUARY 6th

02:44:23.996 --> 02:44:26.015
THE INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE FROM 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAS BEEN

02:44:26.216 --> 02:44:30.079
ALARMING, FRANKLY. THIS 
POLITICAL DISCOURSE MUST BE 

02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:32.280
CONSIDERED AS PART OF THESE 
PROCEEDINGS TO CONCEPTUALIZE MR.

02:44:32.674 --> 02:44:39.225
TRUMP'S WORDS. WE HAVE SOME 
VIDEO TO PLAY THAT HIGHLIGHTS 

02:44:39.430 --> 02:44:42.206
SOME OF WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.
I PREFACE

02:44:45.727 --> 02:44:50.396
THIS VIDEO BY NOTING I AM NOT 
SHOWING YOU THIS VIDEO AS SOME 

02:44:50.594 --> 02:44:53.243
EXCUSE FOR MR. TRUMP'S SPEECH. 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT, THIS IS NOT 

02:44:53.442 --> 02:44:59.127
WHAT ABOUT IN SOME. I AM SHOWING
YOU THIS TO MAKE THE POINT THAT 

02:44:59.327 --> 02:45:04.358
ALL POLITICAL SPEECH MUST BE 
PROTECTED. 

02:45:04.359 --> 02:45:06.359
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:45:10.709 --> 02:45:12.942
I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THERE
AREN'T UPRISINGS ALL OVER THE 

02:45:13.143 --> 02:45:15.578
COUNTRY AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT NEEDS TO BE UNREST IN 

02:45:15.783 --> 02:45:17.783
THE STREETS AS LONG AS THERE IS

02:45:23.096 --> 02:45:25.128
UNREST IN OUR LIVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD TRUMP, YOU NEED TO GO 

02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:27.763
BACK AND PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE 

02:45:27.977 --> 02:45:30.009
PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FEEL LIKE PUNCHING HIM. 

02:45:30.010 --> 02:45:33.407
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IN 
BEHIND THE GYM IF I WERE IN HIGH

02:45:33.678 --> 02:45:38.541
SCHOOL. I WISH WE WERE IN HIGH 
SCHOOL I COULD TAKE IN BEHIND 

02:45:38.742 --> 02:45:40.364
AGENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WILL GO AND TAKE TRUMP'S 

02:45:40.365 --> 02:45:41.575
OUT TONIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TAKEN OUT NOW. 

02:45:41.576 --> 02:45:45.843
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE WAS THE LAST TIME AN 
ACTOR ASSASSINATED A PRESIDENT? 

02:45:46.056 --> 02:45:48.286
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHOW ME WHERE IT SAYS THAT 
PROTESTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 

02:45:48.487 --> 02:45:55.189
POLITE AND PEACEFUL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE THAT AN AWFUL LOT 

02:45:55.601 --> 02:45:59.669
ABOUT BLOWING UP THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 

02:45:59.670 --> 02:46:03.120
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PLEASE GET UP IN THE FACE OF 
SOME CONGRESSPEOPLE. 

02:46:03.121 --> 02:46:09.204
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PEOPLE WILL DO WHAT THEY DO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO TELL YOU, CAVANAGH,

02:46:09.405 --> 02:46:12.799
YOU HAVE RELEASED THE WHIRLWIND 
AND YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE.

02:46:17.335 --> 02:46:20.717
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS JUST A WARNING TO YOU

02:46:36.633 --> 02:46:38.633
TRUMPERS. BE CAREFUL, WALK 
LIGHTLY. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO 

02:46:38.665 --> 02:46:41.299
ARE SOLDIERS, MAKE THEM PAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU HAD TO BE STUCK AT A 

02:46:41.498 --> 02:46:43.327
LATER WITH EITHER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, MIKE PENCE, OR JEFF 

02:46:43.328 --> 02:46:45.768
SESSIONS, WHO WOULD IT BE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOES ONE OF US HAVE TO COME 

02:46:45.994 --> 02:46:49.989
OUT ALIVE ? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AGAIN. I DID NOT SHOW YOU 

02:46:50.172 --> 02:46:52.172
THERE

02:46:56.325 --> 02:46:58.360
ROBUST SPEECH TO EXCUSE OR 
BALANCE OUT THE SPEECH OF MY 

02:46:58.572 --> 02:47:01.027
CLIENT, FOR I NEED NOT. I SHOWED
YOU THE VIDEO BECAUSE IN THIS 

02:47:01.215 --> 02:47:03.238
POLITICAL FORUM, ALL ROBUST 
SPEECH SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND 

02:47:03.439 --> 02:47:06.215
IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED EVENLY 
FOR ALL OF US.

02:47:10.304 --> 02:47:16.441
AS A BRIEF ASIDE, WE SHOULD ALL 
REFLECT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE 

02:47:16.638 --> 02:47:19.417
RHETORIC HAS GOTTEN TO BE TOO 
MUCH AND OVER THE TOP.

02:47:22.938 --> 02:47:24.985
IT IS GREETING ON THE COLLECTIVE
WELL-BEING OF THE BODY PUBLIC, 

02:47:25.732 --> 02:47:34.931
THE CITIZENS. MOST WOULD LIKE IT
TO STOP. THE POINT IS, WHEN YOU 

02:47:35.539 --> 02:47:41.427
SEE SPEECH SUCH AS THIS, YOU 
HAVE TO APPLY THE FIRST 

02:47:41.829 --> 02:47:48.278
AMENDMENT EVENLY, BLINDLY. SHE 
IS BLIND, LADY JUSTICE.

02:47:53.613 --> 02:47:56.663
QUESTION ONE. DOES THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT APPLY TO THIS CHAMBER 

02:47:57.063 --> 02:48:02.144
IN THESE PROCEEDINGS? THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS POSITION, AS STATED IN 

02:48:02.346 --> 02:48:07.015
THEIR TRIAL BRIEF, IS, AND I 
QUOTE, "THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES

02:48:07.765 --> 02:48:12.036
NOT APPLY AT ALL TO AN 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING

02:48:15.149 --> 02:48:17.339
." THAT IS THEIR POSITION. THIS 
IS PLAINLY WRONG.

02:48:22.046 --> 02:48:23.880
THE TEXT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
EXPRESSLY RESTRICTS CONGRESS 

02:48:23.881 --> 02:48:29.763
FROM REGULATING SPEECH. IT 
SOUNDS CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO 

02:48:30.517 --> 02:48:34.846
LAW RESPECTING AN ESTABLISHMENT 
OF RELIGION OR PROHIBITING THE 

02:48:35.046 --> 02:48:39.934
FREE EXERCISE THEREOF OR 
ABRIDGING THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH 

02:48:40.328 --> 02:48:45.343
OR OF THE PRESS OR THE RIGHT OF 
THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO ASSEMBLE

02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:53.944
AND TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT 
FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. TO 

02:48:54.145 --> 02:48:57.331
IGNORE THE CONSTITUTION WOULD BE
CONTRARY TO THE OATH OF OFFICE 

02:48:57.518 --> 02:49:05.728
OF A UNITED STATES SENATOR. I DO
SOLEMNLY SWEAR OR AFFIRM THAT I 

02:49:05.928 --> 02:49:10.759
WILL SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 

02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:17.510
STATES AGAINST ALL ENEMIES 
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, THAT I 

02:49:17.711 --> 02:49:24.158
WILL BEAR TRUE FAITH AND 
ALLEGIANCE TO THE SAME. YOU ALL 

02:49:24.343 --> 02:49:30.849
KNOW THE REST. THE SENATE CANNOT
IGNORE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

02:49:33.279 --> 02:49:37.560
CONSTITUTION ITSELF LIMITS THE 
ABILITY OF THE HOUSE TO IMPEACH

02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:45.265
SUCH AS HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS. THE POSITION OF 

02:49:45.451 --> 02:49:47.451
THE

02:49:52.847 --> 02:49:54.282
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS IS AN 
UNLIMITED IMPEACHMENT STANDARD 

02:49:54.283 --> 02:49:55.695
WITHOUT CONSTITUTIONAL 
GUARDRAILS, ON BOARD TO THE 

02:49:55.696 --> 02:49:58.687
SPECIFIC LEGAL TEST OTHER THAN 
THE UNBRIDLED DISCRETION OF 

02:49:59.038 --> 02:50:06.194
CONGRESS. THIS IS DISTINCTLY NOT
THE INTENT OF THE FRAMERS.

02:50:07.625 --> 02:50:09.625
FRAMERS WERE

02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:15.796
AWARE OF THE DANGER OF ANY 
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS THAT WOULD 

02:50:15.797 --> 02:50:17.797
MAKE THE PRESIDENT THE MERE 
CREATURE OF THE LEGISLATURE, A 

02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:19.830
QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM THE FRAMERS,
WHILE DEBATING THE IMPEACHMENT 

02:50:19.864 --> 02:50:24.890
PROCESS ON THE FLOOR OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 

02:50:25.073 --> 02:50:30.636
1787. THE FRAMERS WERE FEARFUL 
THAT ANY IMPEACHMENT PROCESS 

02:50:31.392 --> 02:50:37.529
GAVE CONGRESS FULL DISCRETION ON
THE STANDARD FOR IMPEACHMENT 

02:50:37.945 --> 02:50:43.629
WOULD CONSTITUTE NOTHING LESS 
THEN A VIOLATION OF THE 

02:50:44.392 --> 02:50:49.874
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF GOOD 
GOVERNMENT. ONE

02:50:53.997 --> 02:50:55.997
FOUNDING FATHER, JAMES WILSON, 
WROTE EXTENSIVELY ON THE 

02:50:56.171 --> 02:51:00.919
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. MR. WILSON 
WAS A RENOWNED LEGAL SCHOLAR AT 

02:51:01.109 --> 02:51:04.907
THE TIME. A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA IN 

02:51:05.204 --> 02:51:10.224
PHILADELPHIA. HE WAS A MAJOR 
FORCE IN DRAFTING AND ADOPTING 

02:51:10.446 --> 02:51:16.331
THE CONSTITUTION IN 1787. HE 
SERVED AS ONE OF THE FIRST SIX 

02:51:16.753 --> 02:51:18.753
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

02:51:20.797 --> 02:51:27.912
, 1789 TO 1798. HE WAS APPOINTED
BY PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

02:51:28.873 --> 02:51:34.420
IN FACT, WILSON TAUGHT THE FIRST

02:51:36.423 --> 02:51:38.423
TO PRESIDENT WASHINGTON AND HIS 
CABINET. THE FIRST IN THE 

02:51:38.787 --> 02:51:41.312
NATION'S HISTORY. IN 
PHILADELPHIA AT THE UNIVERSITY 

02:51:42.064 --> 02:51:44.064
OF PENNSYLVANIA IN 1789.

02:51:48.016 --> 02:51:51.000
WILSON, IN HIS LECTURES, THE 
FIRST OF THEIR KIND UNDER THE 

02:51:51.193 --> 02:51:56.343
CONSTITUTION, PLAINLY STATES 
THAT THE SENATE MAY NOT IGNORE 

02:51:57.093 --> 02:52:03.869
THE CONSTITUTION IN IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS. HE STATES THAT 

02:52:04.270 --> 02:52:09.101
LAWFUL AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
CONDUCT MAY NOT BE USED AS AN 

02:52:09.292 --> 02:52:14.221
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. HE STATES 
THAT LAWFUL AND CONSTITUTIONAL 

02:52:14.422 --> 02:52:20.262
CONDUCT MAY NOT BE USED AS AN 
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE

02:52:24.135 --> 02:52:26.135
WITH ME.

02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:33.723
THE DOCTRINE OF IMPEACHMENT IS 
OF HIGH IMPORT IN THE 

02:52:33.926 --> 02:52:36.984
CONSTITUTIONS OF FREE STATES. ON
ONE HAND, THE MOST POWERFUL 

02:52:37.290 --> 02:52:41.982
MAGISTRATE SHOULD BE AMENABLE TO
THE LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND

02:52:47.937 --> 02:52:49.937
, ELEVATED CHARACTERS SHOULD NOT
BE SACRIFICED MAINLY ON ACCOUNT 

02:52:49.968 --> 02:52:51.968
OF THEIR ELEVATION. NO ONE 
SHOULD BE

02:52:58.144 --> 02:53:00.239
SECURE WELL HE VIOLATES THE 
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS. 

02:53:00.429 --> 02:53:06.428
EVERYONE SHOULD BE SECURE WELL 
HE OBSERVES THEM. TO BE CLEAR, 

02:53:06.628 --> 02:53:10.079
JAMES WILSON IS SAYING THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION DOES INDEED APPLY 

02:53:10.281 --> 02:53:14.904
WHEN JUDGING WHETHER TO CONVICT 
AN OFFICIAL BY IMPEACHMENT. IF 

02:53:15.094 --> 02:53:19.990
THE COMPLAINED OF CONDUCT IS 
CONSTITUTIONAL, IT CANNOT BE 

02:53:20.265 --> 02:53:22.265
IMPEACHABLE.

02:53:23.895 --> 02:53:28.101
ARE WE TO IGNORE THE WORDS AND 
TEACHINGS OF JAMES WILSON? THE

02:53:34.046 --> 02:53:36.721
HOUSE MANAGERS SURELY WANT YOU 
TO. THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE MADE

02:53:36.981 --> 02:53:39.159
SEVERAL REFERENCES TO THIS 
LETTER. IT WAS SIGNED BY 140 

02:53:39.397 --> 02:53:45.022
PARTISAN LAW PROFESSORS: MR. 
TRUMP'S FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSE 

02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:49.599
LEGALLY FRIVOLOUS. THIS IS 
REALLY AN OUTRAGEOUS ATTEMPT TO 

02:53:49.823 --> 02:53:53.294
INTIMIDATE MR. TRUMP'S LAWYERS.

02:53:57.767 --> 02:53:59.767
TRULY FRIVOLOUS

02:54:02.282 --> 02:54:03.973
ARGUMENT, THEY MAY VIOLATE 
PROFESSIONAL, ETHICAL RULES AND 

02:54:03.974 --> 02:54:06.963
COULD BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE. 
THIS LETTER IS A DIRECT THREAT 

02:54:07.165 --> 02:54:12.799
TO MY LAW LICENSE, MY CAREER, 
AND MY FAMILY'S FINANCIAL 

02:54:12.983 --> 02:54:14.983
WELL-BEING.

02:54:20.769 --> 02:54:22.769
THESE LAW PROFESSORS SHOULD BE 
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES AND SO 

02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:27.266
SHOULD THE HOUSE MANAGERS. HOW 
DO YOU? DO YOU REALLY HATE 

02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:29.498
DONALD TRUMP SO MUCH THAT YOU 
ARE WILLING TO DESTROY GOOD, 

02:54:29.712 --> 02:54:31.712
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE'S LIVES

02:54:37.228 --> 02:54:39.248
, PEOPLE THAT ARE ONLY DOING 
THEIR JOBS AND FRANKLY, AS 

02:54:39.464 --> 02:54:40.951
COUNSEL FOR AN ACCUSED, 
FULFILLING A CONSTITUTIONAL 

02:54:40.952 --> 02:54:45.905
ROLE? IT IS ASTOUNDING, REALLY. 
I AM A CITIZEN, NOT A 

02:54:46.098 --> 02:54:50.627
POLITICIAN. I KNOW THESE FIRST 
AMENDMENT ARGUMENTS ARE NOT 

02:54:50.828 --> 02:54:55.657
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO FRIVOLOUS THEY
ARE COMPLETELY MERITORIOUS. 

02:54:55.843 --> 02:54:58.759
INTERESTINGLY, THE LAW 
PROFESSORS LETTER WAS ISSUED ON 

02:54:59.522 --> 02:55:03.189
FEBRUARY 5th, THREE DAYS BEFORE 
WE EVEN FILED OUR LEGAL BRIEF IN

02:55:03.784 --> 02:55:10.938
THIS MATTER AND THEY IGNORED 
LANDMARK BEDROCK SUPREME 

02:55:12.081 --> 02:55:14.081
CASES DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THIS 
ISSUE.

02:55:17.038 --> 02:55:22.174
IN OUR BRIEF, WE HAVE I DIRECT 
QUOTE FROM JAMES WILSON, THE 

02:55:22.366 --> 02:55:24.755
FOUNDING FATHER, SUPPORTING OUR 
POSITION. THE DIRECT QUOTE WAS 

02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:27.155
COMMITTED IN THE FOUNDING 
FATHERS ORIGINAL LEGAL PAPERS.

02:55:33.691 --> 02:55:39.425
HE WAS A PRIMARY DRAFTSMAN OF 
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE NEW 

02:55:39.614 --> 02:55:41.614
CONSTITUTION TO PRESIDENT 
WASHINGTON. HE SAID

02:55:47.505 --> 02:55:49.618
AS LONG AS ACTS OF ELECTED 
OFFICIALS LIKE MR. TRUMP ARE 

02:55:49.805 --> 02:55:51.568
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED, HE 
SHOULD NOT BE IMPEACHED. WE HAVE

02:55:51.569 --> 02:55:54.629
LANDMARK U.S. SUPREME COURT 
DECISIONS. WOULD IT BONDS, WHICH

02:55:54.819 --> 02:55:56.980
I WILL EXPLAIN IN DETAIL, 
SUPPORTING OUR POSITION. ALL

02:56:00.509 --> 02:56:02.334
OF THIS THE HOUSE MANAGERS AND 
PARTISAN LAW PROFESSORS 

02:56:02.335 --> 02:56:10.867
COMPLETELY AND MISLEADINGLY 
IGNORED. FRIVOLOUS? HARDLY. THE 

02:56:11.066 --> 02:56:16.964
LETTER IS A BULLY TACTIC AND I 
THINK EVIDENCES THE HOUSE 

02:56:17.164 --> 02:56:21.031
MANAGERS KNOW THEY HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH A FIRST AMENDMENT 

02:56:21.227 --> 02:56:25.203
DEFENSE ON THE MERITS SO THEY 
ARE RESORTING TO SUCH TACTICS.

02:56:28.745 --> 02:56:30.745
THE HOUSE MANAGERS SUGGESTION 
THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES 

02:56:30.764 --> 02:56:34.581
NOT APPLY TO THIS IMPEACHMENT 
PROCESS IS COMPLETELY UNTENABLE

02:56:40.313 --> 02:56:42.313
. IGNORING THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE SENATORS

02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:44.379
OATH OF OFFICE. IT WOULD ALSO 
CONFLICT WITH WELL-SETTLED 

02:56:44.380 --> 02:56:48.652
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND 
WHERE THE INTENT OF THE FRAMERS 

02:56:49.048 --> 02:56:54.331
OF THE CONSTITUTION, SUCH AS 
JAMES WILSON DID ABOVE ALL ELSE,

02:56:54.531 --> 02:56:58.395
IGNORING THE THE CONSTITUTION 
WOULD ADOPT A NEW RASKIN COMMON 

02:56:58.796 --> 02:57:03.423
SENSE  DOCTRINE WE HEARD 
YESTERDAY, ERODING HUNDREDS OF 

02:57:03.728 --> 02:57:06.672
YEARS OF FIRST AMENDMENT 
PROTECTIONS.

02:57:14.029 --> 02:57:15.861
WE ARE HERE UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION. IT IS ILLOGICAL 

02:57:15.862 --> 02:57:17.895
WITH THE HOUSE MANAGERS SAY. THE
CONSTITUTION DOES APPLY TO THIS 

02:57:18.099 --> 02:57:23.707
CONSTITUTIONAL IMPEACHMENT 
PROCESS. IT IS DOUBLE TALK.

02:57:28.465 --> 02:57:33.532
IF THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAD THEIR 
WAY, THEY WOULD IGNORE ALL OF 

02:57:33.732 --> 02:57:37.195
THE CONSTITUTION. DOES THAT 
INCLUDE THE SIXTH AMENDMENT? THE

02:57:37.399 --> 02:57:44.499
RIGHT TO COUNSEL? THEY WOULD 
HAVE MR. TRUMP ARE SITTING HERE 

02:57:44.914 --> 02:57:48.302
WITHOUT LAWYERS. WHO WOULD BE 
NEXT? IT COULD BE ANYONE. ONE OF

02:57:48.577 --> 02:57:57.511
YOU OR ONE OF YOU. YOU MUST 
REJECT THIS INVITATION TO 

02:57:57.911 --> 02:58:04.209
THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IT IS 
ANTI-AMERICAN AND WOULD SET A 

02:58:04.972 --> 02:58:09.850
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOREVER. THE
LAW IS 

02:58:13.755 --> 02:58:15.588
TO CLEARLY ESTABLISH ELECTED 
OFFICIALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 

02:58:15.589 --> 02:58:20.656
ENGAGE IN PROTECTED SPEECH AND 
MR. TRUMP IS NOT JUST A GUY ON 

02:58:20.858 --> 02:58:24.647
THE STREET OR A GUY AT A BAR OR 
A FIRE CHIEF OR A POLICE OFFICER

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:30.620
. THERE WERE A FEW OF THEM IN 
THERE. ALL ANALOGIES GIVEN BY 

02:58:30.820 --> 02:58:38.339
THE HOUSE MANAGERS. THESE 
SIDEWAYS ANALOGIES ARE WRONG. 

02:58:38.742 --> 02:58:40.771
MR. TRUMP WAS AN ELECTED 
OFFICIAL AND THERE IS AN ENTIRE 

02:58:40.972 --> 02:58:43.819
BODY OF LAW AND THE SUPREME 
COURT LANDMARK CASES SUPPORTING 

02:58:44.579 --> 02:58:48.094
THE CONCLUSION THAT MR. TRUMP 
ACTUALLY HAS ENHANCED 

02:58:49.050 --> 02:58:55.804
FREE-SPEECH RIGHTS BECAUSE HE IS
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. THESE CASES

02:58:56.004 --> 02:58:59.387
ARE IGNORED BY THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS AND THE LAW PROFESSORS.

02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:04.472
THAT TOO IS TOTAL INTELLECTUAL 
DISHONESTY.

02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:13.071
THE SUPREME COURT HAS LONG HELD 
THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT 

02:59:13.271 --> 02:59:18.498
TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH PROTECTS 
ELECTED OFFICIALS. TWO IMPORTANT

02:59:19.318 --> 02:59:21.318
ON POINT

02:59:24.242 --> 02:59:26.272
DECISIONS FOR THE SUPREME COURT,
WOOD VERSUS GEORGIA AND A BOND 

02:59:26.473 --> 02:59:28.841
VERSUS A FULL WEIGHT ESPECIALLY 
CONTRADICT THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

02:59:29.028 --> 02:59:33.590
POSITION. THE HOUSE MANAGERS DO 
NOT EVEN CITE THOSE CASES IN 

02:59:34.355 --> 02:59:38.617
THEIR BRIEF. THEY BARELY 
ACKNOWLEDGE THEM IN THEIR REPLY 

02:59:38.802 --> 02:59:40.802
AND THEY WERE

02:59:54.510 --> 02:59:56.339
ON THEM YESTERDAY. IN WOOD 
VERSUS GEORGIA, THE SUPREME 

02:59:56.340 --> 02:59:58.314
COURT ADDRESSED A CASE INVOLVING
A SITTING SHERIFF, WHOSE 

02:59:58.315 --> 03:00:00.013
REELECTION WAS BEING 
INVESTIGATED  BY A GRAND JURY 

03:00:00.014 --> 03:00:06.289
INDEPENDENCE BY A JUDGE BASED ON
ALLEGATIONS OF IRREGULAR "NEGRO 

03:00:06.757 --> 03:00:08.757
BLOCK VOTING ."

03:00:11.772 --> 03:00:15.156
THE SERVICE QUOTED IN THE PRESS 
RELEASE: THE ALLEGATIONS

03:00:24.569 --> 03:00:26.395
RACIST, ILLEGITIMATE AND AN 
ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE VOTERS. HE

03:00:26.396 --> 03:00:28.830
EVEN URGED THE GRAND JURORS ON 
HOW TO DECIDE THE ISSUES AND NOT

03:00:29.033 --> 03:00:31.265
LET ITS HIGH OFFICE BE A PARTY 
TO ANY POLITICAL ATTEMPT TO 

03:00:31.479 --> 03:00:33.297
INTIMIDATE VOTERS. THE SHERIFF 
VIEWED THE GRAND JURY AS 

03:00:33.298 --> 03:00:38.179
CHALLENGING THE LEGITIMACY OF 
HIS ELECTION. THE SHERIFF EVEN 

03:00:38.379 --> 03:00:41.627
SENT A LETTER TO THE GRAND 
JURORS WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS, 

03:00:41.829 --> 03:00:46.522
WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STEP 
SINCE LAWS IN MOST STATES, 

03:00:46.722 --> 03:00:48.722
INCLUDING GEORGIA, PROHIBIT 
ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE OR 

03:00:48.893 --> 03:00:53.836
INTIMIDATE JURORS. THE SHERIFF 
WAS CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF 

03:00:54.237 --> 03:00:58.701
CONTEMPT OF COURT AND 
OBSTRUCTION OF THE GRAND JURY. 

03:00:59.116 --> 03:01:01.501
BUT THE SUPREME COURT, IN A 
DECISION WRITTEN BY JUSTICE 

03:01:01.684 --> 03:01:06.219
BRENNAN REVERSED. THE COURT HELD
THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT 

03:01:06.431 --> 03:01:10.179
PROTECTED AND ELECTED PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS SPEECH BECAUSE THE 

03:01:10.842 --> 03:01:14.907
VOTING CONTROVERSY DIRECTLY 
AFFECTED THE SHERIFF'S POLITICAL

03:01:15.093 --> 03:01:17.093
CAREER.

03:01:19.431 --> 03:01:23.240
THE PETITIONER WAS AN ELECTED 
OFFICIAL. READ WITH ME PLEASE, 

03:01:23.428 --> 03:01:29.580
EVERYBODY. THE PETITIONER WAS AN
ELECTED OFFICIAL AND HAD THE 

03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:31.780
RIGHT TO ENTER THE FIELD OF 
POLITICAL CONTROVERSY, 

03:01:31.962 --> 03:01:37.218
PARTICULARLY WHERE HIS POLITICAL
LIFE WAS AT STAKE. THE ROLE THAT

03:01:38.516 --> 03:01:43.197
ELECTED OFFICIALS PLAY IN OUR 
SOCIETY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE 

03:01:43.397 --> 03:01:49.902
IMPERATIVE THAT THEY BE ALLOWED 
FREELY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES ON 

03:01:50.098 --> 03:01:52.098
MATTERS OF CURRENT PUBLIC 
IMPORTANCE.

03:01:55.784 --> 03:01:57.784
WOOD, THIS STANDS FOR THE 
POSITION THAT A DIFFERENCE OF 

03:01:57.816 --> 03:02:04.115
POLITICAL OPINION EXPRESSED IN A
SPEECH ON AN ISSUE OF VOTING 

03:02:04.318 --> 03:02:06.318
IRREGULARITY CANNOT BE 
PUNISHABLE WHERE ALL THAT WAS 

03:02:06.347 --> 03:02:10.816
DONE WAS TO ENCOURAGE 
INVESTIGATION AND PEACEFUL 

03:02:11.577 --> 03:02:16.723
POLITICAL SPEECH. JUST LIKE MR. 
TRUMP HAS DONE HERE. THE LEGAL 

03:02:16.914 --> 03:02:19.904
SCHOLARS CALL THAT DIRECTLY ON 
POINT.

03:02:23.820 --> 03:02:27.586
A SECOND CASE, BOND VERSUS FLUID
INVOLVES A STATE LEGISLATURE 

03:02:27.785 --> 03:02:31.536
PUNISHING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL 
FOR PROTECTED POLITICAL SPEECH. 

03:02:31.948 --> 03:02:33.948
BOND IS PARTICULARLY INSTRUCTIVE
HERE TOO.

03:02:37.218 --> 03:02:39.047
AND BOND, THE SUPREME COURT 
SQUARELY ADDRESSED THE QUESTION 

03:02:39.048 --> 03:02:42.301
OF AN ELECTED OFFICIALS 
PUNISHMENT BY A LEGISLATURE FOR 

03:02:42.501 --> 03:02:44.501
STATEMENTS ALLEGED TO HAVE

03:02:48.396 --> 03:02:51.849
INCITED PUBLIC VIOLATION OF THE 
LAW, THE BURDEN OF DRAFT CARDS. 

03:02:52.066 --> 03:02:54.066
THE QUOTE COURT

03:02:56.720 --> 03:02:58.620
UNEQUIVOCALLY REJECTED THE IDEA 
ADVANCED HERE BY THE HOUSE 

03:02:58.621 --> 03:03:00.621
MANAGERS THAT AN ELECTED 
OFFICIAL IS ENTITLED TO NO 

03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:04.853
PROTECTION UNDER THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT. THE SUPREME COURT 

03:03:05.052 --> 03:03:08.864
HELD THAT THE GEORGIA HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES WAS IN FACT 

03:03:09.134 --> 03:03:14.396
FORBIDDEN BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT
FROM PUNISHING BOND BY NOT 

03:03:15.157 --> 03:03:20.080
CEDING HIM FOR ADVOCATING 
AGAINST THE POLICY OF THE UNITED

03:03:20.299 --> 03:03:25.720
STATES. THERE ARE THREE 
FUNDAMENTAL HOLDINGS IN BOND.

03:03:29.643 --> 03:03:33.491
ONE, THE MANIFEST FUNCTIONS OF 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT IN A 

03:03:33.688 --> 03:03:35.688
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT 
REQUIRES LEGISLATORS

03:03:38.972 --> 03:03:41.758
BE GIVEN THE WIDEST LATITUDE TO 
EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON ISSUES OF

03:03:41.944 --> 03:03:46.901
POLICY. TWO, JUST AS ERRONEOUS 
STATEMENTS MUST BE PROTECTED TO 

03:03:47.102 --> 03:03:49.102
GIVE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

03:03:51.370 --> 03:03:56.035
, THE BREATHING SPACE IT NEEDS 
TO SURVIVE, SO STATEMENTS 

03:03:56.235 --> 03:03:58.235
CRITICIZING PUBLIC POLICY AND 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT MUST BE

03:03:58.828 --> 03:04:04.166
SIMILARLY PROTECTED. THIRD 
HOLDING. LEGISLATORS HAVE AN 

03:04:04.368 --> 03:04:09.381
OBLIGATION TO TAKE DECISIONS ON 
ARTIFICIAL ETHICAL QUESTIONS

03:04:12.354 --> 03:04:14.446
THAT THEIR CONSTITUENTS CAN BE 
FULLY INFORMED BY THEM

03:04:18.182 --> 03:04:20.000
AND BE BETTER ABLE TO ASSESS 
THEIR QUALIFICATIONS. PLEASE, 

03:04:20.001 --> 03:04:22.033
READ ALONG WITH ME. THEIR 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICE. ALSO,

03:04:22.233 --> 03:04:26.712
SO THEY MAY BE PRESENTED IN 
GOVERNMENTAL DEBATES BY THE 

03:04:26.914 --> 03:04:29.889
PERSON THEY HAVE ELECTED TO 
REPRESENT THEM.

03:04:35.045 --> 03:04:37.423
" MR. TRUMP ENJOYS THIS SAME 
FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTION FROM 

03:04:37.610 --> 03:04:40.470
CONGRESS. THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
PROTECTIONS GUARANTEED FREE 

03:04:40.658 --> 03:04:47.447
SPEECH, ADDRESSING THE ELECTORAL
INTEGRITY ISSUES ESSENTIAL TO 

03:04:47.642 --> 03:04:52.643
HIS CAREER THAT MR. TRUMP HAS 
CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATED. THE 

03:04:53.470 --> 03:04:58.603
HOUSE MANAGERS ARGUE THAT THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT, AND I QUOTE, 

03:04:58.805 --> 03:05:04.286
"DOES NOT SHIELD PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS WHO OCCUPY SENSITIVE 

03:05:04.688 --> 03:05:09.366
POLICYMAKING POSITIONS FROM 
ADVERSE ACTIONS WHEN THEIR 

03:05:09.566 --> 03:05:13.139
SPEECH UNDERMINES IMPORTANT FOR 
MENTAL INTEREST." THAT IS FLAT 

03:05:13.785 --> 03:05:18.501
WRONG. THEY ARE IN ESSENCE 
ATTEMPTING TO TREAT MR. TRUMP AS

03:05:19.253 --> 03:05:25.150
THEIR EMPLOYEE. THIS IS NOT THE 
LAW UNDERWOOD AND BOND.

03:05:30.081 --> 03:05:32.123
MR. TRUMP WAS ELECTED BY THE 
PEOPLE. HE IS AN ELECTED 

03:05:32.314 --> 03:05:34.851
OFFICIAL. THE SUPREME COURT SAYS
ELECTED OFFICIALS MUST HAVE THE 

03:05:35.036 --> 03:05:37.946
RIGHT TO FREELY ENGAGE IN PUBLIC
SPEECH.

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:46.391
INDEED, THE SUPREME COURT 
EXPRESSLY REJECTED THE HOUSE 

03:05:46.392 --> 03:05:50.373
MANAGERS ARGUMENT IN WOOD VERSUS
GEORGIA, HOLDING THAT THE 

03:05:51.108 --> 03:05:55.903
SHERIFF WAS NOT A CIVIL SERVANT 
BUT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO HAD 

03:05:56.142 --> 03:06:00.147
CORE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, 
WHICH COULD NOT BE RESTRICTED. 

03:06:01.114 --> 03:06:03.114
THAT IS

03:06:11.078 --> 03:06:13.078
WOOD V. GEORGIA PAGE 95 

03:06:16.397 --> 03:06:18.991
, FOOTNOTE 21. THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS DO NOT MENTION WOOD OR 

03:06:19.181 --> 03:06:21.181
BOND.

03:06:22.898 --> 03:06:25.151
IN THE TRIAL BEFORE ANYWHERE 
ELSE. WHY? WHY NOT? IT DOES NOT 

03:06:25.338 --> 03:06:27.364
FIT THEIR NARRATIVE OR THEIR 
STORY. THEY WANT TO PUNISH MR. 

03:06:27.566 --> 03:06:32.044
TRUMP FOR ENGAGING IN 
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED FREE 

03:06:32.245 --> 03:06:34.812
SPEECH AND THEY DO NOT WANT YOU 
TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE

03:06:39.550 --> 03:06:42.601
, BUT YOU MUST. QUESTION TWO. 
DOES MR. TRUMP'S SPEECH DESERVES

03:06:42.799 --> 03:06:44.799
PROTECTION UNDER THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT?

03:06:49.299 --> 03:06:51.638
THERE IS NO DOUBT MR. TRUMP 
ENGAGED IN CONSTITUTIONALLY 

03:06:52.510 --> 03:06:55.337
PROTECTED SPEECH THAT THE HOUSE 
IS IMPROPERLY

03:07:00.075 --> 03:07:01.893
CHARACTERIZED AS INCITEMENT OF 
INSURRECTION. THE FATAL FLAW OF 

03:07:01.894 --> 03:07:04.346
THE HOUSES ARGUMENT IS THAT IT 
SEEKS TO MEET OUT GOVERNMENTAL 

03:07:05.106 --> 03:07:08.129
PUNISHMENT IMPEACHMENT, BASED ON
FIRST AMENDMENT POLITICAL SPEECH

03:07:08.953 --> 03:07:14.692
. SPEECH FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES 
IS 

03:07:16.123 --> 03:07:18.123
THE FIRST AMENDMENT OFFERS ITS 
STRONGEST PROTECTION

03:07:21.194 --> 03:07:23.661
. THESE ARE BEDROCK PRINCIPLES 
RECOGNIZED BY OUR SUPREME COURT 

03:07:24.406 --> 03:07:26.406
FOR DECADES.

03:07:30.540 --> 03:07:32.540
THE COURT HAS STATED IN NO 
UNCERTAIN TERMS THE IMPORTANCE 

03:07:32.570 --> 03:07:36.218
OF THESE PRINCIPLES TO OUR 
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. THE 

03:07:37.193 --> 03:07:41.238
GENERAL PROPOSITION THAT FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION UPON PUBLIC 

03:07:41.464 --> 03:07:45.978
QUESTIONS IS SECURED BY THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT HAS LONG BEEN 

03:07:46.178 --> 03:07:49.985
SETTLED BY OUR DECISIONS. THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS WE 

03:07:50.189 --> 03:07:54.033
HAVE SAID WAS FASHIONED TO 
ENSURE

03:07:57.757 --> 03:07:59.589
UNFETTERED INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS 
FOR THE BRINGING ABOUT OF 

03:07:59.590 --> 03:08:02.772
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES, 
DESIRED BY THE PEOPLE.

03:08:06.844 --> 03:08:11.723
TIMES THE SULLIVAN. OUR FIRST 
AMENDMENT DECISIONS HAVE CREATED

03:08:11.912 --> 03:08:15.781
A ROUGH ROOKIE IN THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF 

03:08:15.966 --> 03:08:22.671
SPEECH, CORE POLITICAL SPEECHES 
OCCUPY THE HIGHEST, MOST 

03:08:22.859 --> 03:08:24.859
PROTECTED PROVISION.

03:08:28.226 --> 03:08:32.292
EVEN POLITICAL SPEECH THAT MAY 
INCITE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IS 

03:08:32.508 --> 03:08:34.508
PROTECTED FROM THE REACH OF

03:08:38.325 --> 03:08:40.325
GOVERNMENT.

03:08:47.123 --> 03:08:49.558
THE COURT HAS HAD EVERY IDEA IS 
AN INCITEMENT AND IF SPEECH MAY 

03:08:49.758 --> 03:08:51.758
BE SUPPRESSED WHEN IT MIGHT 
INSPIRE SOME TRACT FULLY, THERE 

03:08:51.825 --> 03:08:54.023
IS NO LIMIT TO THE STATES SINCE 
WE'LL POWER. THE GOVERNMENT MAY 

03:08:54.235 --> 03:08:58.491
NOT PROHIBIT SPEECH BECAUSE IT 
INCREASES THE CHANCES OF AN 

03:08:59.250 --> 03:09:03.313
UNLAWFUL ACT WILL BE COMMITTED 
AT SOME INDEFINITE TIME IN THE 

03:09:03.496 --> 03:09:08.371
FUTURE. THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
SHOWED YOU A SERIES OF TWEETS

03:09:12.910 --> 03:09:15.143
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2015 
IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE 

03:09:15.356 --> 03:09:19.418
INCITEMENT. ALL OF THAT EVIDENCE
IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT UNDER THE 

03:09:20.182 --> 03:09:22.813
CONSTITUTIONAL DEFINITION OF 
INCITEMENT.

03:09:27.948 --> 03:09:29.970
BRANDENBURG VERSUS OHIO IS 
REALLY THE LANDMARK CASE ON THE 

03:09:30.186 --> 03:09:35.466
ISSUE OF INCITEMENT SPEECH. HALF
OF THE CASE WAS MENTIONED 

03:09:35.683 --> 03:09:37.683
YESTERDAY. IN THE

03:09:39.933 --> 03:09:42.166
. VERSUS OHIO CASE, ANOTHER 
LANDMARK, THE COURT HELD THAT 

03:09:42.927 --> 03:09:49.633
THE GOVERNMENT MAY ONLY SUPPRESS
SPEECH FOR ADVOCATING THE USE OF

03:09:49.819 --> 03:09:55.777
FORCE OR A VIOLATION OF LAW IF 
SUCH ADVOCACY IS DIRECTED 

03:09:56.592 --> 03:10:01.409
INCITING OR REDUCING IMMINENT 
LAWLESS ACTION AND IS LIKELY TO 

03:10:01.596 --> 03:10:07.961
INCITE OR PRODUCE SUCH ACTION. 
BRANDENBURG HOLDINGS HAS BEEN 

03:10:08.161 --> 03:10:11.768
INTERPRETED AS HAVING THREE 
BASIC PRONGS TO DETERMINE IF 

03:10:11.965 --> 03:10:18.658
SPEECH MEET THE DEFINITION OF 
INCITEMENT. THE BRANDENBURG TEST

03:10:19.492 --> 03:10:23.550
PRECLUDES SPEECH FROM BEING 
SANCTIONED AS INCITEMENT TO A 

03:10:24.006 --> 03:10:26.006
RIOT

03:10:27.407 --> 03:10:33.488
. UNLESS THE SPEECH EXPOSITORY 
OR ENCOURAGED USE OF

03:10:39.242 --> 03:10:41.634
VIOLENT ACTION. TWO, THE SPEAKER
INTENDS HIS SPEECH WILL RESULT 

03:10:41.904 --> 03:10:47.157
IN USE OF VIOLENCE OR LAWLESS 
ACTION. AND THREE, THE IMMINENT 

03:10:47.372 --> 03:10:52.530
USE OF VIOLENCE OR LAWLESS 
ACTION IS LIKELY IS THE LIKELY 

03:10:52.711 --> 03:10:58.538
RESULT OF THE SPEECH. THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS CANNOT GET PAST THE 

03:10:58.753 --> 03:11:05.199
FIRST PRONG OF THE BRANDENBURG 
TEST. THEY HAVE NOT AND CANNOT 

03:11:05.446 --> 03:11:12.178
PROVE MR. TRUMP EXPLICITLY OR 
IMPLICITLY ENCOURAGED USE OF 

03:11:12.912 --> 03:11:15.735
VIOLENCE OR LAWLESS ACTION.

03:11:19.668 --> 03:11:22.863
BRANDENBURG REQUIRES A CLOSE 
EXAMINATION OF THE WORDS 

03:11:23.130 --> 03:11:25.130
THEMSELVES.

03:11:28.401 --> 03:11:30.633
THE WORDS ARE EITHER IMPORTANT 
OR THEY ARE NOT. THE HOUSE AT 

03:11:30.833 --> 03:11:35.102
MANAGERS ADMITTED THE SECOND 
ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT THE WORDS. 

03:11:35.863 --> 03:11:37.863
WHY NOT?

03:11:40.795 --> 03:11:43.095
BECAUSE ON THE FACE OF IT, MR. 
TRUMP'S WORDS ARE NO DIFFERENT 

03:11:43.278 --> 03:11:47.293
THAN THE FIGURATIVE SPEECH USED 
BY EVERY ONE OF THE SENATORS 

03:11:47.694 --> 03:11:55.552
ASSEMBLED HERE TODAY. IF IT IS 
NOT ABOUT THE WORDS ABOUT THE

03:11:58.258 --> 03:12:02.324
BIG LIGHT OF THE STOLEN 
ELECTION, WHITE SENT HOUSE 

03:12:02.524 --> 03:12:06.927
MANAGER RASKIN  GUILTY, SINCE HE
TRIED TO OVERTURN THE 2016 

03:12:07.113 --> 03:12:13.641
ELECTION? THE MORE THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS SPEAK, THE MORE 

03:12:13.832 --> 03:12:18.114
HYPOCRISY GETS REVEALED. 
HYPOCRISY

03:12:21.977 --> 03:12:29.140
. EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY IT IS NOT
ABOUT THE WORDS, THE LAW UNDER 

03:12:29.334 --> 03:12:31.981
BRANDENBURG REQUIRES A CLOSE 
ANALYSIS OF THE WORDS TO 

03:12:32.745 --> 03:12:37.610
DETERMINE INCITEMENT. WE NEED TO
LOOK AT THOSE WORDS.

03:12:41.119 --> 03:12:44.172
MR. TRUMP DID THE OPPOSITE OF 
ADVOCATING FOR LAWLESS ACTION, 

03:12:44.923 --> 03:12:49.190
THE OPPOSITE. HE ESPECIALLY 
ADVOCATED FOR PEACEFUL ACTION AT

03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:54.117
THE SAVE AMERICA RALLY. HE 
SPECIFICALLY STATED, THESE ARE 

03:12:54.877 --> 03:12:56.877
THE WORDS

03:12:58.182 --> 03:13:00.414
, "I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HERE 
WILL SOON BE MARCHING OVER TO 

03:13:00.614 --> 03:13:04.880
THE CAPITOL BUILDING TO 
PEACEFULLY AND PATRIOTICALLY 

03:13:05.295 --> 03:13:07.295
MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD

03:13:12.398 --> 03:13:14.398
." TO PEACEFULLY AND 
PATRIOTICALLY MAKE YOUR VOICES 

03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:19.307
HEARD. THAT IS HOW THIS 
PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN FOR YEARS 

03:13:19.711 --> 03:13:25.406
WHEN HE CONDEMNS VIOLENCE, 
LAWLESSNESS, AND RIOTERS. THE 

03:13:25.604 --> 03:13:30.887
HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE PLAYED 
MANIPULATED, SELECTIVELY EDITED 

03:13:31.288 --> 03:13:37.332
PARTS OF MR. TRUMP'S SPEECH. 
THEY FOCUS HEAVILY ON THE WORD 

03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:44.833
FIGHT. THE PRESIDENT USED THE 
WORD FIGHT 20 TIMES IN HIS 

03:13:45.022 --> 03:13:50.744
SPEECH. THEY PICKED ONLY TWO. 
WHY?

03:13:54.248 --> 03:14:00.131
WHY NOT THE OTHER 18? THEY DON'T
TELL THE STORY THE WAY THEY WANT

03:14:00.332 --> 03:14:10.080
TO TELL IT. HERE ARE ALL OF THEM
. LISTEN TO THE CONTEXT. 

03:14:10.081 --> 03:14:14.962
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RUDY, YOU DID A GREAT JOB. 
HE'S GOT GUTS. YOU KNOW WHAT, 

03:14:15.163 --> 03:14:17.163
HE'S GOT GUTS

03:14:19.841 --> 03:14:22.275
. UNLIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE'S GOT GUTS.

03:14:22.477 --> 03:14:25.454
HE FIGHTS. HE FIGHTS. I WILL 
TELL YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

03:14:33.244 --> 03:14:35.476
JOHN, FANTASTIC JOB. THAT IS A 
TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW, THOSE TWO. 

03:14:35.676 --> 03:14:37.676
THERE ARE SO MANY WEAK 
REPUBLICANS AND WE HAVE GREAT 

03:14:37.712 --> 03:14:41.775
ONES. JIM JORDAN AND SOME OF 
THESE GUYS, THEY ARE OUT THERE 

03:14:42.176 --> 03:14:44.176
FIGHTING, THE HOUSE GUYS ARE 
FIGHTING. IT IS INCREDIBLE. MANY

03:14:44.208 --> 03:14:46.443
OF THE REPUBLICANS, I HELPED 
THEM GET IN, I HELPED THEM GET 

03:14:46.643 --> 03:14:51.325
ELECTED. HOW DO YOU SAY I WANT 
TO GET RID OF AMERICA FIRST? 

03:14:51.525 --> 03:14:54.694
EVEN IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT, 
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, RIGHT? 

03:14:54.976 --> 03:14:57.211
UNBELIEVABLE WHAT WE HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH. BUT WE HAVE TO GO 

03:14:57.418 --> 03:15:03.095
THROUGH AND YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR
PEOPLE TO FIGHT. IF THEY DON'T 

03:15:03.310 --> 03:15:05.743
FIGHT, WE HAVE TO PENURY THE OUT
OF THE ONES THAT DON'T FIGHT. 

03:15:05.943 --> 03:15:08.993
THE PRIMARY THEN. WE GOING TO 
LET YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE. I CAN

03:15:09.194 --> 03:15:11.391
ALREADY TELL YOU, FRANKLY. 
REPUBLICANS ARE CONSTANTLY 

03:15:11.581 --> 03:15:17.928
FIGHTING LIKE A BOXER WITH HIS 
HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK. IT 

03:15:18.129 --> 03:15:23.623
IS LIKE A BOXER AND WE WANT TO 
BE SO NICE. WE WANT TO BE SO 

03:15:23.823 --> 03:15:28.901
RESPECTFUL OF EVERYBODY 
INCLUDING BAD PEOPLE. WE ARE 

03:15:29.109 --> 03:15:33.572
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT MUCH 
HARDER. MIKE PENCE IS GOING TO 

03:15:33.774 --> 03:15:37.853
HAVE TO COME THROUGH FOR US. AND
IF HE DOESN'T, THAT WILL BE A 

03:15:38.037 --> 03:15:44.079
SAD DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE
YOU ARE SWORN TO UPHOLD OUR 

03:15:44.262 --> 03:15:49.817
CONSTITUTION. THE CREDIBILITY 
SAYS IF WE SEE SOMEBODY 

03:15:50.431 --> 03:15:54.899
THAT DOESN'T TREAT OUR AS WELL 
OR THEY STEAL, THEY ROB, THEY DO

03:15:55.099 --> 03:16:00.582
THINGS BADLY, WE SAY JOE, YOU 
ARE FIRED, GET OUT OF HERE. YOU 

03:16:00.793 --> 03:16:02.793
COULDN'T DO THAT BEFORE.

03:16:06.477 --> 03:16:08.912
SO WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THINGS.
WE HAVE DONE THINGS LIKE NOBODY 

03:16:09.112 --> 03:16:12.375
HAS EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. THAT 
IS PART OF THE REASON THAT MANY 

03:16:12.575 --> 03:16:15.009
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE US, BECAUSE WE
HAVE DONE TOO MUCH. BUT WE HAVE 

03:16:15.209 --> 03:16:18.185
DONE IT QUICKLY AND WE WERE 
GOING TO SIT HOME AND WATCH A

03:16:24.144 --> 03:16:26.594
BIG VICTORY AND EVERYONE HAD US 
DOWN FOR A VICTORY. IT WAS GOING

03:16:26.793 --> 03:16:29.435
TO BE GREAT. NOW WE ARE OUT HERE
FIGHTING. I SAID TO SOMEBODY I 

03:16:29.628 --> 03:16:32.076
WAS GOING TO TAKE A FEW DAYS AND
RELAX AFTER OUR BIG ELECTORAL 

03:16:32.277 --> 03:16:34.309
VICTORY. 10:00 IT WAS OVER. THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE 

03:16:34.512 --> 03:16:37.307
THE CORRUPT FAKE NEWS ANYMORE. 
THEY HAVE RUINED THEIR 

03:16:37.580 --> 03:16:42.842
REPUTATION. IT USED TO BE THEY 
WOULD ARGUE WITH ME. I WOULD 

03:16:43.043 --> 03:16:45.489
FIGHT. THEY WOULD FIGHT. I WOULD
FIGHT. YOU BELIEVE ME, TO 

03:16:45.676 --> 03:16:48.926
BELIEVE THEM, SOMEONE COMES OUT,
YOU KNOW. THEY HAVE THEIR POINT 

03:16:49.140 --> 03:16:54.628
OF VIEW, I HAVE MY POINT OF 
VIEW. BUT YOU WOULD HAVE AN 

03:16:54.835 --> 03:16:57.059
ARGUMENT. KNOW WHAT THEY DO IS 
THEY GO SILENT. IT IS CALLED 

03:16:57.259 --> 03:16:59.093
SUPPRESSION. THAT IS WHAT 
HAPPENS IN A COMMUNIST COUNTRY. 

03:16:59.094 --> 03:17:01.123
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. THEY 
SUPPRESS. YOU DON'T FIGHT WITH 

03:17:01.888 --> 03:17:03.888
THEM ANYMORE

03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:16.353
UNLESS IT'S A BAD STORY. THEY 
HAVE A LITTLE BAD STORY ABOUT 

03:17:16.557 --> 03:17:18.987
ME, THEY MAKE IT 10 TIMES WORSE 
AND IS A MAJOR HEADLINE. HUNTER 

03:17:19.202 --> 03:17:21.202
BIDEN, THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT 
HIM. WHAT HAPPENED TO HUNTER, 

03:17:21.236 --> 03:17:23.471
WHERE IS HUNTER. WITH YOUR HELP 
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, WE 

03:17:23.668 --> 03:17:25.668
BUILD THE GREATEST POLITICAL 
MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

03:17:25.701 --> 03:17:27.733
COUNTRY AND NO ONE EVEN 
CHALLENGES FOR THAT. I SAY THAT 

03:17:27.940 --> 03:17:30.374
OVER AND OVER AND I NEVER GET 
CHALLENGED BY THE FAKE NEWS AND 

03:17:30.569 --> 03:17:32.569
THEY CHALLENGE ALMOST EVERYTHING
WE SAY. OUR FIGHT AGAINST THE 

03:17:32.601 --> 03:17:36.254
BIG DONORS, BIG MEDIA, BIG TECH 
AND OTHERS IS JUST GETTING 

03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:38.704
STARTED. THIS IS THE GREATEST IN
HISTORY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A 

03:17:38.903 --> 03:17:40.737
MOVEMENT LIKE THAT. OUR 
BRIGHTEST DAYS ARE BEFORE US. 

03:17:40.738 --> 03:17:42.738
OUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS

03:17:50.691 --> 03:17:52.919
, STILL WAIT. I THINK ONE OF OUR
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS WILL BE 

03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:55.154
ELECTION SECURITY. NOBODY UNTIL 
I CAME ALONG HAD ANY IDEA HOW 

03:17:55.352 --> 03:17:57.182
CORRUPT OUR ELECTIONS WERE. 
AGAIN, MOST PEOPLE WOULD STAND 

03:17:57.183 --> 03:18:01.344
THERE AT 9:00 IN THE EVENING AND
SAY I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY 

03:18:01.529 --> 03:18:06.733
MUCH AND THEY GO OFF TO SOME 
OTHER LIFE BUT I SAID SOMETHING 

03:18:06.933 --> 03:18:08.766
IS WRONG HERE, SOMETHING IS 
REALLY WRONG, CAN'T HAVE 

03:18:08.767 --> 03:18:12.216
HAPPENED. AND WE FIGHT. WE FIGHT
LIKE . IF YOU DON'T FIGHT LIKE ,

03:18:12.417 --> 03:18:14.651
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A 
COUNTRY ANYMORE. OUR EXCITING 

03:18:14.851 --> 03:18:18.864
ADVENTURES AND BOLDEST ENDEAVORS
HAVE NOT YET BEGUN. MY FELLOW 

03:18:19.048 --> 03:18:23.505
AMERICANS, FOR OUR MOVEMENT, FOR
OUR CHILDREN, AND FOR OUR 

03:18:24.134 --> 03:18:29.066
BELOVED COUNTRY, AND I SAY THIS 
DESPITE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED, 

03:18:29.281 --> 03:18:31.281
THE BEST IS YET TO COME.

03:18:38.156 --> 03:18:44.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A BOXER FIGHTING WITH HIS 
HAND TIED BEHIND HIS BACK? 

03:18:45.121 --> 03:18:47.760
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THINKING? 
RUDY BEING RUDY

03:18:51.003 --> 03:18:53.396
? THESE ARE THE METAPHORICAL, 
RHETORICAL USES OF THE WORD 

03:18:53.585 --> 03:18:56.010
FIGHT. WE ALL KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

03:19:00.152 --> 03:19:05.435
SUDDENLY THE WORD FIGHT IS OFF 
LIMITS? SPARE US THE HYPOCRISY 

03:19:05.668 --> 03:19:10.666
AND FALSE INDIGNATION. IT IS A 
TERM USED OVER AND OVER AND OVER

03:19:10.856 --> 03:19:16.603
AGAIN BY POLITICIANS ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE AISLE. OF COURSE, 

03:19:17.365 --> 03:19:21.484
THE DEMOCRAT HOUSE MANAGERS KNOW
THAT THE WORD FIGHT HAS BEEN 

03:19:22.239 --> 03:19:26.353
USED FIGURATIVELY IN POLITICAL 
SPEECH FOREVER. DON'T TAKE IT 

03:19:27.114 --> 03:19:31.377
FROM ME, IT IS BEST TO LISTEN TO
THEM

03:19:40.771 --> 03:19:42.208
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR MISSION IS TO JOB. 

03:19:42.209 --> 03:19:44.634
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR JOB IS TO FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE IN A FIGHT. 

03:19:44.635 --> 03:19:46.685
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE IN A FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING AS 

03:19:46.873 --> 03:19:48.873
HARD AS WE CAN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DEMOCRATS ARE STAYING UP TO 

03:19:48.902 --> 03:19:50.733
FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. WE LIKE

03:19:50.734 --> 03:19:52.554
A GOOD FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO FIGHT 

03:19:52.555 --> 03:19:53.983
LIKE . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE FIGHT LIKE . 

03:19:53.984 --> 03:19:57.369
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WILL FIGHT LIKE . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE . 

03:19:57.555 --> 03:20:00.069
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WILL FIGHT LIKE . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE TO FIGHT LIKE . 

03:20:00.070 --> 03:20:02.070
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW MANY OTHER MEMBERS

03:20:11.851 --> 03:20:14.635
OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE ARE 
GOING TO FIGHT LIKE . 

03:20:14.636 --> 03:20:18.619
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE . 

03:20:18.973 --> 03:20:23.914
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST HAVE TO FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT, WE ARE

03:20:24.137 --> 03:20:26.515
GOING TO FIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO 
FIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT. 

03:20:26.700 --> 03:20:28.309
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; POLITICAL REVOLUTION. THAT 
MEANS THAT MILLIONS. MILLIONS. 

03:20:28.310 --> 03:20:30.820
MILLIONS. HAVE GOT TO STAND UP 
AND FIGHT. AND FIGHT AND FIGHT. 

03:20:31.072 --> 03:20:33.456
STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT. ONCE 

03:20:33.641 --> 03:20:35.641
AGAIN FIGHT BACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE FIGHTING BACK.

03:20:41.713 --> 03:20:43.713
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU DON'T 

03:20:43.814 --> 03:20:45.375
FIGHT FOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL FIGHT HIM AND 

03:20:45.376 --> 03:20:46.993
CHALLENGE HIM IN EVERY WAY THAT 
WE CAN. 

03:20:46.994 --> 03:20:49.027
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGHT IN CONGRESS, FIGHT THE 
COURTS, FIGHT IN THE STREETS. 

03:20:49.228 --> 03:20:51.058
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE CONGRESS, THE COURTS,
AND THE STREET. 

03:20:51.059 --> 03:20:53.569
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS THE FIGHT AND THEN 
THERE IS THE FIGHT TO DEFEND. 

03:20:53.753 --> 03:20:55.580
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE 
SITE. 

03:20:55.581 --> 03:20:57.896
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGHT.

03:21:02.028 --> 03:21:04.174
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GET IN THIS FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AROUND THE CLOCK FIGHTING. 

03:21:04.363 --> 03:21:06.085
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING AND 
KEEP FOCUSED. 

03:21:06.086 --> 03:21:08.056
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL FIGHT WHEN WE MUST 
FIGHT. 

03:21:08.057 --> 03:21:10.057
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:21:16.859 --> 03:21:18.883
WE NEED TO FIGHT BUT WE ALSO 
NEED TO FIGHT. 

03:21:18.884 --> 03:21:21.108
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN 
UPHILL FIGHT. 

03:21:21.109 --> 03:21:23.385
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ALWAYS MUST FIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE IN THE FIGHT OF OUR 

03:21:23.573 --> 03:21:25.380
LIVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THE 

03:21:25.381 --> 03:21:27.381
FIGHT OF OUR LIVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES. 

03:21:27.439 --> 03:21:29.244
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE IN THIS FIGHT FOR OUR 
LIVES. 

03:21:29.245 --> 03:21:30.660
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CANNOT EVER GIVE UP 
FIGHTING. 

03:21:30.661 --> 03:21:38.492
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HYPOCRISY. THE REALITY IS MR.
TRUMP IS NOT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, 

03:21:38.680 --> 03:21:43.005
OR FORM INSTRUCTING THESE PEOPLE
TO FIGHT OR TO USE PHYSICAL 

03:21:43.193 --> 03:21:47.068
VIOLENCE. WHAT HE WAS 
INSTRUCTING THEM TO DO WAS TO 

03:21:47.253 --> 03:21:51.792
CHALLENGE THEIR OPPONENTS IN 
PRIMARY ELECTIONS TO PUSH FOR 

03:21:52.195 --> 03:21:58.092
SWEEPING ELECTION REFORMS, TO 
HOLD BIG TECH RESPONSIBLE, ALL 

03:21:58.493 --> 03:22:03.161
CUSTOMARY AND LEGAL WAYS TO 
PETITION YOUR GOVERNMENT FOR 

03:22:03.915 --> 03:22:09.460
REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES, WHICH OF 
COURSE IS ALSO PROTECTED 

03:22:10.212 --> 03:22:15.358
CONSTITUTIONAL SPEECH. THE HOUSE
MANAGERS DON'T WANT YOU TO FOCUS

03:22:15.559 --> 03:22:20.250
ON THOSE THINGS BECAUSE AGAIN, 
IT DOES NOT FIT THEIR STORY.

03:22:25.709 --> 03:22:31.756
IN THE END, I LEAVE YOU WITH 
THIS QUOTE FROM BENJAMIN 

03:22:31.951 --> 03:22:33.951
FRANKLIN.

03:22:36.276 --> 03:22:40.700
"FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS A 
PRINCIPAL PILLAR OF A FREE 

03:22:40.983 --> 03:22:46.438
GOVERNMENT. WHEN THIS SUPPORT IS
TAKEN AWAY, THE CONSTITUTION OF 

03:22:46.639 --> 03:22:53.884
A FREE SOCIETY IS DISSOLVED AND 
TYRANNY IS ERECTED ON ITS RUINS.

03:22:54.970 --> 03:22:56.970
" THANK YOU.

03:23:11.623 --> 03:23:13.260
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MAJORITY LEADER. 

03:23:13.261 --> 03:23:15.897
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF 
THE SENATE RECESS FOR A 15 

03:23:16.662 --> 03:23:19.293
MINUTE BREAK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO OBJECTIONS.

03:23:38.648 --> 03:23:40.881
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A BRIEF RECESS AS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S LAWYERS LAY OUT THE CASE

03:23:41.097 --> 03:23:43.529
WHY THEY BELIEVE HE SHOULD NOT 
BE FOUND GUILTY BY THIS COURT OF

03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:45.963
SENATORS. LET'S GO TO JAMES 
HOLMAN TO GO OVER THE DETAILS OF

03:23:46.163 --> 03:23:49.029
WHAT WE JUST SAW. JAMES, A 
COUPLE OF TIMES I THOUGHT I

03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:55.540
HIT THE WRONG BUTTON AND WE WERE
GOING BACK AND I BECAUSE THEY 

03:23:55.722 --> 03:23:57.945
REPLAYED THE SAME FOOTAGE OVER 
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHAT IS

03:23:58.146 --> 03:24:00.539
FOR THE UTILITY OF THAT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE UTILITY IS REPETITION. 

03:24:00.727 --> 03:24:02.727
THIS

03:24:06.279 --> 03:24:08.509
CAN ONLY BE, IS FOR AN AUDIENCE 
OF ONE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT 

03:24:08.710 --> 03:24:10.710
PERSUADING PEOPLE. THEY KNOW 
THEY HAVE THE VOTES LOCKED DOWN 

03:24:10.746 --> 03:24:12.981
TO GET AN ACQUITTAL. THEY ARE 
TRYING TO KEEP THEIR CLIENT, THE

03:24:13.180 --> 03:24:15.213
FORMER PRESIDENT, HAPPY. A LOT 
OF THIS SEEMS DESIGNED TO REALLY

03:24:15.414 --> 03:24:17.414
BE TROLLING AS MUCH AS LAWYERING

03:24:26.177 --> 03:24:28.177
. FRANKLY TALKING ABOUT THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY INSTEAD OF THE 

03:24:28.211 --> 03:24:29.849
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, TALKING ABOUT 
HOW THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL 

03:24:29.850 --> 03:24:31.850
CANCEL CULTURE. THESE AREN'T 
LEGAL TERMS OR TURNS OF PHRASES.

03:24:31.876 --> 03:24:34.321
THIS IS ABOUT PLAYING TO THE 
TRUMP BASE AND TRYING TO WIN IN 

03:24:34.515 --> 03:24:38.779
THEIR COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, I WANT TO SHARE WITH 

03:24:38.979 --> 03:24:43.248
YOU SOME OF THE NOTES WE ARE 
GETTING. WE HAVE A POOL OF 

03:24:43.448 --> 03:24:46.035
REPORTERS WHO ARE ABLE TO BE IN 
THAT CALORIE WATCHING OVER

03:24:51.165 --> 03:24:52.995
THE SENATOR'S REACTIONS, WHICH 
IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT 

03:24:52.996 --> 03:24:55.844
GIVES US A SENSE OF THE STATE OF
MIND AND HOW THEY ARE SORT OF 

03:24:56.044 --> 03:24:58.044
PHYSICALLY AND VISUALLY REACTING
TO THINGS. WE ARE GETTING SOME 

03:24:58.076 --> 03:25:00.076
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING 
INSIDE THE CHAMBER. SHE POINTS 

03:25:00.099 --> 03:25:05.388
OUT THAT ALL OF THIS VIDEO 
PLAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN CUT 

03:25:05.594 --> 03:25:09.046
THE HEAVINESS IN THE ROOM. IT IS
LIKE THIS. CLEANSER IN A WAY, A 

03:25:09.247 --> 03:25:12.496
THEME CHANGER FROM THE VERY 
INTENSE FOOTAGE WE SAW DELIVERED

03:25:12.696 --> 03:25:19.195
BY THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS. AND SO THERE IS A WAY 

03:25:19.408 --> 03:25:21.721
THAT THIS ALLOWS REPUBLICANS TO 
SORT OF MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT, 

03:25:21.923 --> 03:25:26.649
YOU KNOW, A DIFFERENT PART HERE.
I AM HEARING FROM STAFFERS OF 

03:25:26.835 --> 03:25:28.835
DEMOCRATS

03:25:33.010 --> 03:25:35.044
, WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE THEIR 
BUSES ARE FEATURED IN THESE 

03:25:35.244 --> 03:25:37.680
VIDEOS BECAUSE IT IS LIKE A 
BADGE OF HONOR TO SOME OF THEM 

03:25:37.882 --> 03:25:40.129
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THIS AS 
BEING IN ANY WAY PARALLEL TO 

03:25:40.328 --> 03:25:43.253
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN FACT, NONE OF THE, THOSE 

03:25:43.523 --> 03:25:46.626
STATEMENTS WERE FOLLOWED BY 
ANGRY MOBS DESCENDING ON THE 

03:25:46.826 --> 03:25:52.507
CAPITOL OR COMMITTING VIOLENT. 
IT IS, FOR A LOT OF THOSE 

03:25:52.721 --> 03:25:55.355
DEMOCRATS, A BADGE OF HONOR. IT 
WAS IRONIC BECAUSE THE TWO 

03:25:55.556 --> 03:25:59.421
EMPLOYERS CHOOSE TO RELITIGATE 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHICH GIVEN A 

03:25:59.622 --> 03:26:02.672
LOT OF THE PRESIDENT BIGGEST 
DEFENDERS AND STRONGEST 

03:26:02.877 --> 03:26:05.104
SUPPORTERS AGREE WAS ONE OF THE 
LOW POINTS. WHEN HE SAID THERE 

03:26:05.305 --> 03:26:07.305
WERE SOME VERY FINE PEOPLE

03:26:11.807 --> 03:26:13.837
ON BOTH SIDES AND THE TRUMP 
DEFENSE LAWYERS. WITH YOU ABOUT 

03:26:14.140 --> 03:26:16.140
WHAT THE MEDIA

03:26:21.356 --> 03:26:23.188
DOESN'T SHOW YOU THE 
THREE-MINUTE FULL CLIP WHERE HE 

03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:25.622
ALSO SAID THE NEO-NAZIS WERE BAD
AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO PLAY 

03:26:25.823 --> 03:26:27.823
THIS WHOLE THREE-MINUTE CLIP 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE 

03:26:27.855 --> 03:26:29.888
WALL CONTACT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
THAT THEY SAID NO WE ARE GOING 

03:26:30.088 --> 03:26:32.122
TO SHOW YOU THIS A FIVE MINUTE 
MONTAGE OF DEMOCRATIC SENATORS 

03:26:32.322 --> 03:26:34.153
AND HOUSE TREATMENT MANAGERS 
SAYING THE WORD FIGHT OVER 

03:26:34.154 --> 03:26:36.589
AGAIN. I WAS AT A LOT OF THOSE 
THINGS, WE COVERED THE CAMPAIGN 

03:26:36.789 --> 03:26:38.945
TOGETHER. A LOT OF THE CONTEXT, 
SOME OF THE

03:26:43.710 --> 03:26:46.324
KAMALA HARRIS AND ONE OF THE 
DEBATES, ONE OF THE SUGAR CLIPS 

03:26:46.546 --> 03:26:48.802
WHERE HE WAS SAYING FIGHT, I 
REMEMBER VERY WELL HE WAS SAYING

03:26:48.987 --> 03:26:51.018
WE HAVE TO FIGHT COVID-19 
BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIGHT THIS 

03:26:51.220 --> 03:26:54.044
PANDEMIC. SO IT WAS KIND OF 
AMUSING TO WATCH THIS LECTURE ON

03:26:54.845 --> 03:26:56.722
NOT TAKING THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT
FOLLOWED BY DIGGING DEMOCRATS 

03:26:56.723 --> 03:26:58.205
OUT OF CONTEXT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ELIZABETH WARREN, YOU KNOW, 

03:26:58.206 --> 03:27:00.206
FIGHTING FOR POLICY CHANGES. 
ELIZABETH WARREN WASN'T 

03:27:00.565 --> 03:27:05.849
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY 
TAKE UP ARMS AND COMMIT VIOLENT 

03:27:06.048 --> 03:27:07.864
ACTS, JAMES. THAT IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

03:27:07.865 --> 03:27:13.148
NEEDS TO HAVE THE CONTEXT WITH 
THESE CLIPS. IF THEY ARE TAKEN 

03:27:13.361 --> 03:27:15.331
OUT OF CONTEXT, IT CAN BE 
MISLEADING. 

03:27:15.332 --> 03:27:17.332
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:27:19.449 --> 03:27:21.895
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE 
SAW THE LAST TWO DAYS, LIBBY. 

03:27:22.094 --> 03:27:23.734
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
WERE TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING 

03:27:23.735 --> 03:27:25.735
LEADING UP TO JANUARY SIXTH. 
WHAT THEY

03:27:29.422 --> 03:27:31.653
THE SAVE THE DATE INVITATION 18 
DAYS OUT, WHERE HE SAID, D.C. 

03:27:31.854 --> 03:27:34.287
JANUARY 6, WE WILL BE WILD. THE 
WHOLE CONTEXT OF THE SPEECH. "IN

03:27:34.502 --> 03:27:37.591
WAS NOTABLE WAS BECAUSE WE HAVE 
SEEN THE CLIPS OF TRUMP AT THAT 

03:27:37.776 --> 03:27:39.776
STOP THE STEEL REALLY

03:27:43.837 --> 03:27:45.878
, ONE OF THE THINGS THE 
DEMOCRATS DID WAS PLAY FOOTAGE 

03:27:46.079 --> 03:27:48.519
FROM THE CROWD SO THAT YOU COULD
SEE HOW THE CROWD WAS REACTING 

03:27:48.720 --> 03:27:51.303
TO TRUMP'S COMMENTS. YOU SAW 
LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD 

03:27:51.486 --> 03:27:53.486
SAYING

03:28:01.106 --> 03:28:03.106
, "LET'S STORM THE CAPITOL. 
STORM THE CAPITOL RIGHT NOW. 

03:28:03.137 --> 03:28:05.170
TAKE THE CAPITOL. HANG MIKE 
PENCE." THAT WAS HOW THEY WERE 

03:28:05.371 --> 03:28:07.371
RESPONDING. TRUMP COULD HEAR 
THAT. TRUMP WAS LISTENING TO THE

03:28:07.409 --> 03:28:09.637
CROWD AS HE WAS SPEAKING. TODAY,
YOU ARE JUST SEEING THE TIGHT 

03:28:09.837 --> 03:28:12.284
SHOT OF TRUMP AND IT IS JUST HIS
MICROPHONE SO YOU ARE NOT 

03:28:12.484 --> 03:28:14.311
HEARING THE CROWDS RESPONSE 
WHERE THEY WERE CLEARLY BEING 

03:28:14.312 --> 03:28:16.752
HELD UP BY THE PRESIDENT AT THE 
TIME AND TRUMP ALSO SPOKE AFTER 

03:28:16.952 --> 03:28:18.952
HOURS OF SIMILARLY INCENDIARY 
SPEECHES

03:28:22.441 --> 03:28:24.055
WHERE RUDY GIULIANI, THE 
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER SAID

03:28:24.056 --> 03:28:26.742
IF YOU HOURS BEFORE TRUMP TOOK 
THE STAGE, TODAY IS GOING TO BE 

03:28:26.939 --> 03:28:28.939
TRIAL BY COMBAT.

03:28:32.388 --> 03:28:34.388
THE CONTEXT THEIR MATTERS AND 
THAT IS WHAT THE IMPEACHMENT 

03:28:34.422 --> 03:28:36.580
MANAGERS WERE TRAINED TO DO BY 
SHARING THOSE VIDEOS AND SHOWING

03:28:36.769 --> 03:28:38.888
THE DISTANCE OF TWEETS LEADING 
UP TO JANUARY 6th TWO SO THIS 

03:28:39.088 --> 03:28:41.121
WASN'T STANDARD FARE A LITTLE 
RHETORIC ABOUT THE NEED TO FIGHT

03:28:41.322 --> 03:28:44.300
HARD, WHICH IS WHAT WAS 
ELIZABETH WARREN'S 2020

03:28:50.270 --> 03:28:51.684
CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, YOUR TOP TAKEAWAYS 

03:28:51.685 --> 03:28:54.121
FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY TOP TAKEAWAYS IS FIRST 

03:28:54.321 --> 03:28:59.954
HALF, WHEN WE HEARD DAVID SCHOEN
SAY  THEIR FINDINGS THAT

03:29:01.238 --> 03:29:06.494
VIDEOS HAVE BEEN EDITED AND 
SHOWED THE TWEET AND CLEANED THE

03:29:09.977 --> 03:29:11.813
DATES DIDN'T MATCH UP. AFTER 
THAT, THEY STARTED SHOWING 

03:29:11.814 --> 03:29:13.849
HEAVILY EDITED VIDEO MONTAGES AS
WELL. AS YOU AND JAMES JUST 

03:29:14.048 --> 03:29:19.530
POINTED OUT, A LOT OF CONTEXT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOST, ESPECIALLY

03:29:19.731 --> 03:29:21.790
IN THE MONTAGE THAT KEPT SHOWING
DEMOCRAT USING THE WORD FIGHT. 

03:29:21.977 --> 03:29:23.977
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

03:29:29.884 --> 03:29:32.118
WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT, 
EVEN IF THEY WERE USING THE WORD

03:29:32.332 --> 03:29:34.332
FIGHT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY
ARE CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATS 

03:29:34.351 --> 03:29:36.801
FOR DOING ONE THING AND KIND OF 
FOLLOWING UP AND DOING THE SAME 

03:29:37.003 --> 03:29:39.035
THING. ON BOTH SIDES, IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT FOR VIEWERS TO 

03:29:39.236 --> 03:29:41.468
UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF THINGS
AND I ONE SIDE IS SAYING THIS 

03:29:41.668 --> 03:29:44.102
ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE AND I HAVE 
REACHED OUT TO THOSE FAMILIAR 

03:29:44.303 --> 03:29:47.771
WITH THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS PRESENTATIONS AND I AM 

03:29:47.969 --> 03:29:49.969
INSPECTING SOME SORT OF COMMENT 
SOON FROM

03:29:57.923 --> 03:29:59.923
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND 
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT THE 

03:29:59.955 --> 03:30:01.773
CLAIMS THAT THEIR PRESENTATIONS 
WERE MANIPULATED. I DON'T KNOW 

03:30:01.774 --> 03:30:04.622
IF THAT IS GOING TO COME BEFORE 
THE END OF THIS WEEK OR LATER IN

03:30:04.823 --> 03:30:07.058
THE DAY BUT I DO SUSPECT THE 
MANAGERS TEAM WILL BE SAYING 

03:30:07.257 --> 03:30:09.348
SOMETHING ABOUT THESE KINDS. I 
AM ALSO STRUCK TOO BY THE 

03:30:09.534 --> 03:30:11.737
LENGTHY PRESENTATION WE WENT 
THROUGH ABOUT THE FIRST 

03:30:11.961 --> 03:30:13.770
AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS UNDER, THE FORMER 

03:30:13.771 --> 03:30:16.430
PRESIDENT IS UNDER. THIS SITE IS
CLAIMING HE IS PROTECTED BY 

03:30:16.614 --> 03:30:18.614
CERTAIN PRECEDENTS LIKE

03:30:21.076 --> 03:30:25.955
BOND VISITS FLORIDA, WHICH SAYS 
STATE LEGISLATORS CAN WEIGH IN 

03:30:26.156 --> 03:30:27.989
ON CONTROVERSIAL POLITICAL 
MATTERS. I AM WONDERING IF LEGAL

03:30:27.990 --> 03:30:32.458
SCHOLARS ARE LOOKING INTO THAT 
AND IT BEING APPLICABLE TO THIS 

03:30:32.656 --> 03:30:34.656
CASE. IT IS FOR STATE 
LEGISLATORS AND THE STATE CANNOT

03:30:34.689 --> 03:30:37.939
UNSEAT A LEGISLATIVE MEMBER 
BECAUSE THAT EXTENDS TO A 

03:30:38.140 --> 03:30:40.372
PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY GAVE, YOU
KNOW, A DATE TO HIS FOLLOWERS TO

03:30:40.573 --> 03:30:42.742
COME TO D.C. AND DO A SPECIFIC 
ACTION. SO

03:30:50.939 --> 03:30:53.173
THOSE ARE THE TOP TWO TAKEAWAYS 
THAT I HAVE. THESE WERE ALL 

03:30:53.374 --> 03:30:55.407
EXPECTED, REALLY. WE KNEW THE 
DEFENSE TEAM WOULD COME IN TODAY

03:30:55.607 --> 03:30:57.607
AND DISCUSSED THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS

03:31:02.722 --> 03:31:04.755
, AS WELL AS RIGHT AT THE 
BEGINNING THEY STARTED TALKING 

03:31:04.955 --> 03:31:06.987
ABOUT HOW THIS IS NO EDWARD 
ANYWAY BECAUSE IT IS NOT 

03:31:07.188 --> 03:31:08.607
CONSTITUTIONAL. THAT SOMETHING 
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ASK 

03:31:08.608 --> 03:31:10.840
THEM TO STAY AWAY FROM BECAUSE 
IT IS NO LONGER GERMANE SINCE 

03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:13.331
THE SENATE VOTED ON TUESDAY THAT
IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND WE WILL

03:31:13.516 --> 03:31:15.516
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO INTO THAT FIRST 

03:31:15.721 --> 03:31:17.955
AMENDMENT POINT THAT YOU ARE IS 
GETTING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN 

03:31:18.156 --> 03:31:21.206
TALKING ABOUT THE SUPERCUTS THAT
THE TRUMP TEAM DID, BECAUSE OF 

03:31:21.406 --> 03:31:23.438
DEMOCRAT USING THE WORD FIGHT. 
THEIR ARGUMENT AFTER THAT WAS 

03:31:23.639 --> 03:31:25.674
THAT TRUMP'S RHETORIC IS NORMAL 
POLITICAL SPEECH. LET'S WATCH. 

03:31:25.874 --> 03:31:29.673
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SHOWED YOU THE VIDEO 
BECAUSE IN THIS POLITICAL FORUM

03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:35.631
, ALTHOUGH BEST SPEECH SHOULD BE
PROTECTED AND IT SHOULD BE 

03:31:35.826 --> 03:31:42.735
PROTECTED EVENLY FOR ALL OF US. 
AS A BRIEF ASIDE, WE SHOULD ALL 

03:31:43.136 --> 03:31:46.742
REFLECT AND A KNOWLEDGE THE 
RHETORIC HAS GOTTEN TO BE TOO 

03:31:46.949 --> 03:31:52.683
MUCH. AND OVER THE TOP. IT IS 
CREATING ON THE COLLECTIVE 

03:31:52.884 --> 03:31:54.884
WELL-BEING OF THE BODY PUBLIC, 
THE CITIZENS

03:31:58.982 --> 03:32:00.982
. MOST WOULD LIKE IT TO STOP.

03:32:04.667 --> 03:32:09.950
THE POINT IS, WHEN YOU SEE 
SPEECH SUCH AS THIS, YOU HAVE TO

03:32:10.151 --> 03:32:12.361
APPLY THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
EVENLY, BLINDLY

03:32:16.249 --> 03:32:24.991
, SHE IS BLIND, LADY JUSTICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES HOMAN, TO HEAR ONE OF 

03:32:25.592 --> 03:32:28.992
THE PRESIDENT LAWYERS TALKING 
ABOUT THE RHETORIC BEING OUT OF 

03:32:29.178 --> 03:32:33.313
CONTROL REMINDED ME OF SEEING 
THE FORMER FIRST LADY MELANIA 

03:32:33.513 --> 03:32:37.593
TRUMP TRYING TO WAGE A CAMPAIGN 
TO STOP BULLYING, EVEN AS

03:32:45.097 --> 03:32:46.921
HER HUSBAND LITERALLY BULLIED 
PEOPLE, INCLUDING NOT JUST THE 

03:32:46.922 --> 03:32:49.149
OPPOSING TEAM BUT MEMBERS OF HIS
OLD TEAM, LIKE THE FIRST, THE 

03:32:49.901 --> 03:32:51.901
VICE PRESIDENT.

03:32:53.832 --> 03:32:55.832
THERE IS THIS HYPOCRISY 
HAPPENING THERE. I WANT TO POINT

03:32:55.864 --> 03:32:57.864
OUT, JAMES, WE ARE SEEING 
SENATOR TED CRUZ LEAVING THE 

03:32:57.949 --> 03:32:59.713
ROOM WHERE TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM 
HAS BEEN PREPARING. SIGNIFICANT 

03:32:59.714 --> 03:33:01.714
BECAUSE WE ARE WATCHING TO SEE 
COORDINATION

03:33:07.026 --> 03:33:08.661
BETWEEN SOME OF THESE 
REPUBLICANS, WHO ARE LISTENING 

03:33:08.662 --> 03:33:10.688
IN THE AUDIENCE, WHO ARE THE 
JURORS, AND THE TRUMP TEAM. 

03:33:10.890 --> 03:33:17.190
LET'S REFLECT ON, AND I AM USING
THE WORD HYPOCRISY CAREFULLY. TO

03:33:17.390 --> 03:33:19.624
HEAR THAT COMING OUT OF AN 
ATTORNEY'S MOUTH ABOUT A MAN WHO

03:33:19.824 --> 03:33:21.824
HAS NOT APOLOGIZED FOR BULLYING 
AND THREATENING SPEECH

03:33:29.375 --> 03:33:31.611
, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU FIND
THEM GUILTY IN THIS MOMENT, HE 

03:33:31.813 --> 03:33:33.813
HAS DONE THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS A GREAT ANALOGY WITH 

03:33:33.847 --> 03:33:35.847
MELANIA TRUMP. IT IS SIGNIFICANT
LEGALLY BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE 

03:33:35.867 --> 03:33:37.867
SAYING ALSO UNDERSCORES ONE OF 
THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE HOUSE 

03:33:37.900 --> 03:33:40.099
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS MADE. TRUMP
HAS SHOWN NO CONTRITION OR 

03:33:40.375 --> 03:33:44.199
REMORSE. IN A PROSECUTION, IN A 
CRIMINAL TRIAL, THAT WOULD BE 

03:33:44.962 --> 03:33:48.418
INCREDIBLY RELEVANT TO NOT JUST 
CONVICTION BUT SENTENCING. DOES 

03:33:48.609 --> 03:33:50.609
HE

03:33:52.531 --> 03:33:54.766
RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT HE DID WAS 
WRONG? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 

03:33:54.964 --> 03:33:57.199
LAWYERS AT ONCE THAT TRUMP'S 
WORDS AT THAT RALLY ON JANUARY 

03:33:57.950 --> 03:34:02.282
6th WERE PATRIOTIC. HE CALLED 
THE LIQUID PATRIOTIC. HE SAID 

03:34:02.575 --> 03:34:05.340
TRUMP HAS NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE 
FOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 

03:34:05.531 --> 03:34:10.407
HEARD YESTERDAY WAS THAT THE A 
COMMENT FROM HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

03:34:10.613 --> 03:34:12.613
MANAGERS THAT THEY NEED TO 
CONTACT TRUMP BECAUSE IT IS 

03:34:12.719 --> 03:34:14.719
GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN IF THEY 
DON'T. AS

03:34:18.531 --> 03:34:21.165
TED LOU PUT IT, TRUMP COULD RUN 
AND WAS IN 2024 AND THERE COULD 

03:34:21.381 --> 03:34:23.557
BE ANOTHER INSURRECTION BECAUSE 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD ONCE 

03:34:23.745 --> 03:34:26.869
AGAIN, FEELING LIKE HE WAS DOING
NOTHING WRONG, FEELING LIKE HE 

03:34:27.064 --> 03:34:29.246
HAD BEEN VALIDATED BY HIS 
ACQUITTAL FROM THE SENATE, 

03:34:29.433 --> 03:34:33.151
ENCOURAGE HIS SUPPORTERS TO GO 
FIGHT LIKE AT CONGRESS. THAT 

03:34:33.365 --> 03:34:38.975
WOULD THEN APPEAR SANCTIONED. 
THAT COMMENT, WHILE RICH

03:34:46.763 --> 03:34:48.763
AND LAUGHABLE TO ANYONE WHO HAS 
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO 

03:34:48.797 --> 03:34:50.827
AMERICAN POLITICS FOR THE PAST 
FIVE YEARS, THE IDEA THAT DONALD

03:34:51.028 --> 03:34:52.657
TRUMP'S LAWYERS LECTURING 
SENATORS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

03:34:52.658 --> 03:34:54.658
THAT POLITICAL RHETORIC HAS 
GOTTEN TOO OUT OF HAND ALSO 

03:34:54.692 --> 03:34:57.939
SPEAKS TO FRANKLY A CENTRAL 
ELEMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CASE 

03:34:58.139 --> 03:35:03.425
AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TRUMP'S DEFENSE LAWYER, HIS 

03:35:03.624 --> 03:35:07.892
DISCUSSION OF THE IMPEACHMENT 
WAS CONSTITUTIONAL CANCEL 

03:35:08.100 --> 03:35:12.768
CULTURE. LET'S WANT THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOT ONLY IS THIS IMPEACHMENT 

03:35:13.527 --> 03:35:16.758
CASE PREPOSTEROUSLY ROMAN 
EFFECTS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH HEAT

03:35:18.449 --> 03:35:22.248
AND EMOTION IS INJECTED BY THE 
POLITICAL OPPOSITION, IT IS ALSO

03:35:24.092 --> 03:35:30.230
PLAINLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IN 
EFFECT, CONGRESS WOULD BE 

03:35:30.431 --> 03:35:33.279
CLAIMING THAT THE RIGHT TO 
DISQUALIFY A PRIVATE CITIZEN NO 

03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:36.257
LONGER A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL 
FROM RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE

03:35:39.782 --> 03:35:42.155
. THIS WOULD TRANSFORM THE SOUL 
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS INTO A 

03:35:42.344 --> 03:35:45.063
MECHANISM FOR ASSERTING 
CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL OVER WHICH

03:35:45.825 --> 03:35:51.301
PRIVATE CITIZENS ARE AND ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

03:35:55.011 --> 03:35:57.458
IN SHORT, THIS UNPRECEDENTED 
EFFORT IS NOT ABOUT DEMOCRATS 

03:35:57.864 --> 03:36:03.089
OPPOSING POLITICAL VIOLENCE. IT 
IS ABOUT DEMOCRATS TRYING TO 

03:36:03.274 --> 03:36:08.369
DISQUALIFY THEIR POLITICAL 
OPPOSITION. IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL

03:36:09.385 --> 03:36:11.385
CANCEL CULTURE

03:36:19.592 --> 03:36:21.221
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT 

03:36:21.222 --> 03:36:23.658
IN A MOMENT. FIRST I WANT TO 
BRING RADICAL AND BACK FOR MORE 

03:36:23.858 --> 03:36:25.688
ON HOW THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS ARE RESPONDING. RHONDA.

03:36:25.689 --> 03:36:28.740
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS I SAID A LITTLE EARLIER, I
DID REACH OUT TO THE DEMOCRATS 

03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:31.513
IMPEACHMENT TEAM AND I JUST 
HEARD FROM A SENIOR AIDE. SHE 

03:36:31.699 --> 03:36:36.658
SAYS THIS TO THE QUESTION OF 
WHAT DO THEY THINK ABOUT TRUMP'S

03:36:36.858 --> 03:36:38.858
LAWYERS CLAIMING THAT THE 
EVIDENCE WAS MUTILATED. THEIR 

03:36:39.040 --> 03:36:41.040
ANSWER IS

03:36:42.745 --> 03:36:44.745
, "AS TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS ARE NO 
DOUBT AWARE, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

03:36:44.788 --> 03:36:46.807
TWITTER ACCOUNT HAS BEEN REMOVED
FROM TWITTER AND IT IS ONLY 

03:36:47.561 --> 03:36:51.276
AVAILABLE IN ARCHIVE INSTEAD OF 
SCREENSHOTS. AS TRUMP'S 

03:36:51.490 --> 03:36:54.123
ATTORNEYS SPOTLIGHTED BY 
UNEXPECTEDLY CONDEMNING THE 

03:36:54.537 --> 03:36:57.122
MANAGERS FOR A DRAFT GRAPHIC OF 
A TWEET

03:37:02.257 --> 03:37:07.126
, IT IS NECESSARY TO FORMAT AND 
BLOW UP THE TEXT OF TWEETS SO 

03:37:07.351 --> 03:37:09.392
THAT SENATORS CAN SEE IT. THE 
TEXT IS ENTIRELY UNCHANGED. ALSO

03:37:09.593 --> 03:37:15.045
AT THAT FINAL GRAPHIC 
ACCIDENTALLY HAD A VERIFICATION 

03:37:15.459 --> 03:37:18.706
TO COMMENT ON IT. THE SUBSTANCE 
OF IT WAS ENTIRELY ACCURATE. 

03:37:19.108 --> 03:37:21.108
WHAT IS TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS POINT,
IF ANYTHING

03:37:28.661 --> 03:37:30.661
, IS A FURTHER EVIDENCE OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTENTION TO 

03:37:30.690 --> 03:37:32.924
AND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS BEING 
OPENLY PLAYED ON JANUARY 6th BY 

03:37:33.125 --> 03:37:34.541
HIS FOLLOWERS. EVEN THOSE 
WITHOUT TWITTER VERIFICATIONS. 

03:37:34.542 --> 03:37:37.010
SO THAT IS WHAT THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER, A SENIOR 

03:37:37.192 --> 03:37:39.371
AIDE WITH THE IMPEACHMENT 
SAYING. THAT IS THEIR RESPONSE 

03:37:39.648 --> 03:37:41.648
TO DAVID SCHOEN'S CRITICISMS 

03:37:47.754 --> 03:37:49.880
THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS USED 
IS MANIPULATED AND EDITED DOWN. 

03:37:50.108 --> 03:37:52.925
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, I WANT TO DWELL ON 
THAT FOR A MOMENT. THERE WAS A 

03:37:53.111 --> 03:37:54.992
FOCUS THAT IT WAS A LITTLE 
STRANGE, FRANKLY, WHERE THEY 

03:37:54.993 --> 03:37:57.902
WERE PICKING APART THE SCREEN 
GRAB. THIS IS WHAT THE HOUSE 

03:37:58.667 --> 03:38:02.584
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER EIGHT IS 
RESPONDING TO AND THEY WERE 

03:38:02.784 --> 03:38:04.784
MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF A

03:38:09.485 --> 03:38:11.485
BLUE TECHNIQUE. BECAUSE THEY 
WERE TRYING TO SHOW THE VERACITY

03:38:11.601 --> 03:38:13.352
OR TESTABILITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS PROCESS. IT

03:38:13.353 --> 03:38:18.632
SEEMED A BIT OFF-TOPIC. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SORT OF DID IT SEEMED LIKE

03:38:18.832 --> 03:38:20.832
A GOTCHA MOMENT. WHEN MR.

03:38:25.936 --> 03:38:27.970
DAVID SCHOEN STARTED TO BRING 
THAT UP AND SAID THEY HAVE 

03:38:28.175 --> 03:38:30.207
EVIDENCE THIS HAS BEEN DELETED, 
IT WAS  SOMETHING WE WERE 

03:38:30.404 --> 03:38:33.051
SITTING ON THE EDGE OF OUR SEATS
WONDERING OKAY, WHAT IS THIS? IT

03:38:33.258 --> 03:38:38.120
SEEMS LIKE IT WAS PERHAPS BLOWN 
OUT OF PROPORTION AND NOT FULLY 

03:38:38.534 --> 03:38:40.769
EXPLAINED. I HAD TO SIT AND 
LISTEN A LITTLE HARDER WHEN HE 

03:38:40.970 --> 03:38:43.604
WAS EXPLAINING IT TO SEE HOW IT 
TOUCHED HIS ARGUMENT A LITTLE 

03:38:43.818 --> 03:38:48.235
BIT. AGAIN, AS WE SAID AND HIS 
TEAM FOLLOWED UP WITH HEAVILY 

03:38:48.417 --> 03:38:53.714
EDITED VIDEOS OF HIMSELF. IT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO SEEK 

03:38:53.904 --> 03:38:58.032
THAT CONTEXT FROM BOTH SIDES TO 
FIND OUT WHAT THESE EVIDENCE AND

03:38:58.232 --> 03:39:02.298
THE VIDEO EDITING USED AND HOW 
THAT EXPLAINS AN ARGUMENT AND 

03:39:02.499 --> 03:39:06.788
WHAT CONTEXT IT IS. I THINK 
THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT

03:39:11.846 --> 03:39:14.077
POINT EARLIER, THE CLIP THE CUP 
USING OF CHUCK SCHUMER. IT WAS 

03:39:14.278 --> 03:39:17.370
REALLY IN RELATION TO COVID-19. 
AGAIN, BOTH SIDES SHOULD ALWAYS 

03:39:17.558 --> 03:39:19.702
EXPLAIN WHERE THEY ARE GETTING 
THEIR VIDEOS FROM AND

03:39:23.427 --> 03:39:25.859
WHY THIS IS GERMANE TO THE POINT
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE. 

03:39:25.860 --> 03:39:28.858
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, THE THING WE ARE 
FOCUSING ON THE WAS A DRAFT OF 

03:39:29.041 --> 03:39:32.376
RETREAT. IT WAS NOT CHANGING THE
SUBSTANCE OF THE TWEET. IT WAS 

03:39:32.574 --> 03:39:36.843
JUST THE THING THE DATE WRONG, 
WHICH WAS CORRECTED BEFORE WE 

03:39:37.041 --> 03:39:39.041
EVEN SAW IT.

03:39:48.626 --> 03:39:54.925
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS TRUMP'S MO. TO USE 
THE TERM YOU USED THE OTHER DAY,

03:39:55.126 --> 03:39:57.157
THEIR DEFENSE STRATEGY, YOU SAID
THIS ON TUESDAY, IS I BELIEVE 

03:39:57.358 --> 03:39:59.431
DENIAL AND DEFIANCE. THIS IS 
KIND OF THE WHAT ABOUTISM. THIS 

03:39:59.612 --> 03:40:02.594
IS SOMETHING WE  SAW THE LAST 
FOUR YEARS, WHICH IS TO KIND OF 

03:40:02.803 --> 03:40:07.126
PICK ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU
KNOW, THE NEW CHECKMARK. ONE OF 

03:40:07.875 --> 03:40:11.328
THE REASONS, I MEAN THAT THE 
STATEMENT ADDRESSED THIS TRUMP'S

03:40:11.515 --> 03:40:13.515
TWEETS

03:40:17.672 --> 03:40:20.002
AREN'T ONLINE ANYMORE SO THEY 
HAVE TO BE RE-CREATED IN A WAY 

03:40:20.184 --> 03:40:22.484
THAT CAN BE BLOWN UP. IT IS NOT 
SURPRISING THEY CONTINUE TO 

03:40:22.667 --> 03:40:24.667
FOCUS ON THESE SORTS OF THINGS 
THAT WOULD PROBABLY PLAY VERY 

03:40:24.784 --> 03:40:27.377
WELL WITH THEIR CLIENT, THE KIND
OF THING TRUMP HIMSELF

03:40:31.483 --> 03:40:33.718
WOULD BE WORKED UP ABOUT. TRUMP 
HAS BEEN WORKED UP FOR YEARS 

03:40:33.918 --> 03:40:35.780
ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE, HAS 
ALWAYS FELT LIKE HE WAS UNFAIRLY

03:40:35.781 --> 03:40:37.781
ACCUSED OF SAYING THERE WERE 
GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. 

03:40:37.785 --> 03:40:39.785
AGAIN, THIS ARGUMENT IS AS MUCH 
ABOUT REACHING TRUMP AND 

03:40:39.818 --> 03:40:41.818
APPEALING TO HIS CORE SUPPORTERS

03:40:54.235 --> 03:40:56.667
AS IT IS PERSUADING PEOPLE WHO 
ARE TRYING TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND 

03:40:56.881 --> 03:40:58.498
ON THE JURY THAT IS THE U.S. 
SENATE. 

03:40:58.499 --> 03:41:02.078
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO HANNAH JEWELL, 
NATIONAL REPORTER WHO HAS BEEN 

03:41:02.643 --> 03:41:06.653
WATCHING TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS. 
HANNAH, WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU 

03:41:06.969 --> 03:41:10.603
IN THE DEFENSE IS HIS INTENTION?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS JAMES JUST SAID, SPEAKING 

03:41:11.004 --> 03:41:16.639
OF APPEALING TO TRUMP'S CORPUS, 
I WAS STRUCK BY THE WAY THE 

03:41:17.001 --> 03:41:20.459
FIRST 20 MINUTES OF HIS 
PRESENTATION, TRUMP'S LAWYER,  

03:41:20.891 --> 03:41:25.360
MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN BROUGHT UP 
SEVERAL  KEY CULTURE WAR TERMS 

03:41:26.004 --> 03:41:29.903
AND IDEAS THAT STUCK OUT TO ME. 
FIRSTLY, HE SUGGESTED THAT 

03:41:30.327 --> 03:41:34.380
ANTIFA AND LEFT WING  ACTIVISTS 
WERE BEHIND THE CAPITOL RIGHT. 

03:41:34.854 --> 03:41:38.726
HE SAID THE LEADER OF ANTIFA WAS
THE FIRST ARRESTED AND FIRST 

03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:42.394
PLACE.  THIS ISN'T TRUE ON A 
NUMBER OF LEVELS. FIRSTLY, THERE

03:41:42.725 --> 03:41:47.584
IS NO SUCH THING AS A LEADER OF 
ANTIFA. THERE HAS BEEN NO 

03:41:48.104 --> 03:41:52.208
EVIDENCE THE RIOTERS  IN THE 
CAPITOL ON THE SIXTH OR ANYTHING

03:41:52.504 --> 03:41:55.944
OTHER THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS. THE
FBI HAS FOUND NO SUCH EVIDENCE. 

03:41:56.329 --> 03:42:01.317
THE ONLY PERSON I THINK HE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO AS I WAS 

03:42:01.562 --> 03:42:05.146
TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AFTER 
HEARING THAT WAS POTENTIALLY A 

03:42:05.578 --> 03:42:09.568
YOUNG MAN CALLED JOHN EARL 
SULLIVAN, WHO WAS ARRESTED OVER 

03:42:10.004 --> 03:42:14.537
HIS ROLE AT THE CAPITOL. THIS IS
ACTUALLY THE MAN WHO TOOK THE 

03:42:14.907 --> 03:42:19.637
VIDEO SHOWING ASHLEY BABBIT'S 
SHOOTING  DEATH BY THE POLICE. 

03:42:20.062 --> 03:42:22.801
HE SAID HE WAS THERE TO DOCUMENT
BUT HE WAS RESTED AND CHARGED 

03:42:22.982 --> 03:42:25.013
WITH TRESPASSING AND MISCONDUCT.
HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF ANTIFA. 

03:42:25.200 --> 03:42:27.230
THE POST HAS REPORTED HE IS A 
STRANGE CHARACTER WHO IS NEITHER

03:42:27.443 --> 03:42:29.582
A DARLING OF THE LEFT OR THE 
RIGHT. HE ORGANIZED  SOCIAL 

03:42:29.766 --> 03:42:31.819
JUSTICE PROTESTS BUT HE HAS BEEN
TOTALLY DISOWNED BY BLACK LIVES 

03:42:32.011 --> 03:42:34.011
MATTER GROUPS IN UTAH, WHERE HE 
IS FROM. HE HAS ORGANIZED 

03:42:34.054 --> 03:42:36.054
PROTESTS IN FAVOR OF GUN RIGHTS 
AND HAS PROTESTED ALONGSIDE THE 

03:42:36.089 --> 03:42:38.089
FAR RIGHT PROUD BOYS. IF A 
REPUBLICAN DID FIGURE. THIS IS 

03:42:38.153 --> 03:42:40.316
INDEED TO MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN 
WAS TALKING ABOUT, IT IS NOT 

03:42:40.499 --> 03:42:42.910
TRUE  THAT HE WAS A SO-CALLED 
LEADER OF ANTIFA  OR WAS SOMEHOW

03:42:43.110 --> 03:42:45.467
DIRECT IN THE AREA. WHAT MATTERS
HERE IS THAT MICHAEL VAN DER 

03:42:45.657 --> 03:42:47.619
VEEN IS USING THIS KEYWORD, 
ANTIFA, MEANT TO DEFLECT BLAME 

03:42:47.620 --> 03:42:51.644
FOR THE CAPITOL RIGHT TO THE 
LEFT AND THIS LINE OF ARGUMENT  

03:42:52.047 --> 03:42:54.047
IS EFFECTIVE WITH TRUMP'S A 
BASE. ABOUT HALF OF REPUBLICANS 

03:42:54.080 --> 03:42:58.144
BELIEVE THE Y IT WAS MOSTLY THE 
FAULT OF ANTIFA AND THE LEFT , 

03:42:58.344 --> 03:43:00.344
AS ""THE WASHINGTON POST"" HAS 
REPORTED. LIBBY, THE OTHER KEY 

03:43:00.578 --> 03:43:03.011
PHASE THAT MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN 
REFERRED TO, AS WE HEARD IN THAT

03:43:03.226 --> 03:43:07.891
CLIP WITH  THE PHRASE CANCEL 
CULTURE. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR

03:43:08.092 --> 03:43:10.529
WITH IT, I AM JEALOUS OF YOU, 
FIRST OF ALL. THE SHORT VERSION 

03:43:10.732 --> 03:43:14.999
OF WHAT THIS PHRASE MEANS IS THE
IDEA THAT IF A PUBLIC FIGURE 

03:43:15.214 --> 03:43:17.214
DOES OR SAYS SOMETHING 
OBJECTIONABLE

03:43:20.289 --> 03:43:22.322
, THE PUBLIC WITHDRAWS OF THEIR 
SUPPORT AND ATTENTION FROM THAT 

03:43:22.520 --> 03:43:25.294
FIGURE. THE PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT 
AND ALSO ON THE LEFT HAVE

03:43:29.626 --> 03:43:31.869
COME TO USE THIS TERM TO REFER 
TO A MORE SINISTER PHENOMENON, 

03:43:32.060 --> 03:43:34.248
AND UNJUST AND OVERBLOWN 
REACTION THAT WOMEN'S LIVES AND 

03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:36.440
CAREERS.

03:43:41.006 --> 03:43:43.354
THIS PHRASE CANCEL CULTURE HAS 
TAKEN A WILD JOURNEY THROUGH 

03:43:43.595 --> 03:43:45.595
POLITICS. THERE IS A UNIVERSITY 
OF REGINA PROFESSOR, MEREDITH 

03:43:45.764 --> 03:43:48.571
CLARK, WHO HAS WRITTEN THIS 
GREAT PAPER THAT TRACES THE 

03:43:48.764 --> 03:43:51.324
ORIGINS OF THIS TERM FROM BLACK 
AMERICAN VERNACULAR LANGUAGE TO 

03:43:51.627 --> 03:43:55.066
BE CO-OPTED BY CONSERVATIVES TO 
WRITE THAT WHEN THIS PHRASE IS 

03:43:55.282 --> 03:43:58.257
USED TODAY, AS WE HAVE SEEN IT, 
IT IS MEANT TO RECAST SOCIAL 

03:43:58.500 --> 03:44:01.983
ACTIVISM AS A BAT AND SCARY 
THING. THIS IS REALLY JUST A NEW

03:44:02.265 --> 03:44:04.421
WORD FOR AN OLD IDEA. ANY 
PREVIOUS DECADE, WE MIGHT'VE 

03:44:04.638 --> 03:44:06.638
HEARD VAN DER VEEN REFERRED TO 
DEMOCRATS AS 

03:44:15.945 --> 03:44:17.812
POLITICALLY CORRECT FOR 
OBJECTING TO TRUMP'S WITH TO 

03:44:17.813 --> 03:44:20.778
DRIVE HOME HOW ABSURD IT IS THAT
THE WAY SYSTEM THAT COMES FROM 

03:44:21.054 --> 03:44:23.774
POP CULTURE AND ACTIVISM HAS 
MADE ITS WAY TO THE SENATE FLOOR

03:44:23.958 --> 03:44:26.215
AND THE ADDED ABSURDITY OF 
SAYING THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHO

03:44:26.448 --> 03:44:28.679
WAS ONCE THE MOST POWERFUL 
PERSON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, 

03:44:28.900 --> 03:44:31.092
COULD BE CANCELED. IT IS NOT A 
CANCELLATION, IT IS AN 

03:44:31.331 --> 03:44:33.844
IMPEACHMENT. SADLY, CULTURE WAR 
ARGUMENTS DON'T HAVE A LOT OF 

03:44:34.089 --> 03:44:36.537
BASIS IN TRUTH A LOT OF THE 
TIMES. LIBBY. 

03:44:36.538 --> 03:44:38.538
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HANNAH JEWELL, NATIONAL 
REPORTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE

03:44:38.606 --> 03:44:40.414
SENIOR SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT,
THIS IS DEMOCRAT RICHARD 

03:44:40.415 --> 03:44:42.415
BLUMENTHAL

03:44:47.012 --> 03:44:49.246
JUST STOPPED TO TALK TO 
REPORTERS A FEW MINUTES AGO. 

03:44:49.460 --> 03:44:51.285
HERE IS HIS TAKE ON THE DEFENSES
PRESENTATION. 

03:44:51.286 --> 03:44:53.559
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE TRYING TO DRAW A 
FALSE, DANGEROUS, AND DISTORTED 

03:44:53.853 --> 03:44:57.684
EQUIVALENTS. I THINK IT IS 
PLAINLY A DISTRACTION FROM 

03:44:58.552 --> 03:45:03.519
DONALD TRUMP'S INVITING THE MOB 
TO WASHINGTON YOU KNOW WHEN IT 

03:45:04.235 --> 03:45:08.769
WAS ARMED. CHANGING THE ROUTE 
AND THE TIMING SO AS TO INCITE 

03:45:09.029 --> 03:45:13.362
THEM TOO MUCH ON THE CAPITOL AND
THEN REVELING WITHOUT REMORSE, 

03:45:13.547 --> 03:45:15.547
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING

03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:21.481
TO PROTECT HIS OWN VICE 
PRESIDENT AND ALL OF US. I THINK

03:45:21.755 --> 03:45:25.006
THAT THE CASE IS EVEN MORE 
POWERFUL AFTER THIS VERY 

03:45:25.410 --> 03:45:27.410
DISTORTED AND FALSE ARGUMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS

03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:42.494
DEMOCRAT FROM CONNECTICUT, 
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. HERE IS WHAT

03:45:42.897 --> 03:45:47.191
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI HAD TO 
SAY. THIS IS PER THE POOL 

03:45:47.629 --> 03:45:51.409
REPORT. SHE SAYS, "I THINK THEY 
ARE PUTTING ON A GOOD DEFENSE 

03:45:51.848 --> 03:45:55.788
TODAY AND THE FIRST TWO HOURS OR
WELL PUT TOGETHER." SHE SAYS 

03:45:56.120 --> 03:46:00.153
THEY ARE MORE ON THEIR GAME 
TODAY, THESE LAWYERS, WHEN THEY 

03:46:00.612 --> 03:46:04.557
WERE EARLIER THIS WEEK WHEN THE 
KICK THINGS OFF ON TUESDAY. 

03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:08.018
JAMES, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US 
ABOUT HOW SENATORS ARE REACTING?

03:46:08.286 --> 03:46:12.002
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE ARE SOME SENATORS WHO 
ARE GENUINELY IN PLAY. THE 

03:46:12.353 --> 03:46:15.642
REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO VOTE 
TO CONVICT TRUMP. THERE REALLY 

03:46:16.040 --> 03:46:19.837
IS NO ONE, EVEN SOMEONE LIKE 
MITT ROMNEY WHO HAS BEEN AN 

03:46:20.222 --> 03:46:24.902
ARDENT CRITIC OF TRUMP, VOTED TO
CONVICT HIM LAST TIME, HE DID IT

03:46:25.270 --> 03:46:27.864
WITH A VERY HEAVY HEART AND 
AFTER A LOT OF PRAYER 

03:46:28.059 --> 03:46:30.940
AUTHENTICALLY. HE REALLY DOESN'T
WANT TO HAVE THIS KIND OF RECORD

03:46:31.283 --> 03:46:36.349
OF BREAKING WITH TRUMP. I EXPECT
ULTIMATELY HE IS GOING TO DO SO 

03:46:36.749 --> 03:46:41.331
BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF OTHERS 
IN THIS GROUP, YOU KNOW, HALF A 

03:46:41.724 --> 03:46:46.961
DOZEN WHO WANT A REASON. THEY 
ARE DESPERATE FOR A REASON TO 

03:46:47.254 --> 03:46:51.039
VOTE NOT TO CONVICT. THEY ARE 
LISTENING CLOSELY AND SQUINTING 

03:46:51.429 --> 03:46:55.204
TO COME UP WITH SOME 
JUSTIFICATION SO THAT THEY CAN 

03:46:55.617 --> 03:46:59.184
NOT VOTE TO CONVICT TRUMP. WE 
SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THOSE 

03:46:59.411 --> 03:47:03.661
HALF A DOZEN SENATORS WHO VOTED 
TO PROCEED WITH THE CONSTITUTION

03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:09.566
AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE 
TRIAL ARE GOING TO VOTE TO 

03:47:10.010 --> 03:47:15.255
CONVICT. THEY ARE VERY MUCH UP 
FOR GRABS. I THINK THAT THERE 

03:47:15.503 --> 03:47:18.703
ARE OTHER REPUBLICANS WHO FELT 
LIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CASE WAS 

03:47:18.974 --> 03:47:22.409
COMPELLING AND ACTUALLY ARE SORT
OF GENUINELY PAYING ATTENTION TO

03:47:22.772 --> 03:47:27.503
SEE WHAT THE RESPONSE IS. WE ARE
PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE 

03:47:27.931 --> 03:47:30.322
FOUR REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO 
ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RETIRING NEXT

03:47:30.728 --> 03:47:35.037
YEAR SO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 
HAVE TO BEAT VOTERS AGAIN. ROB 

03:47:35.351 --> 03:47:38.642
PORTMAN IN OHIO, PAT TOOMEY IN 
PENNSYLVANIA, RICHARD BURR IN 

03:47:38.989 --> 03:47:42.513
NORTH CAROLINA AND DICK SHELBY 
IN ALABAMA. THEY DON'T WANT 

03:47:42.902 --> 03:47:46.737
THEIR LEGACY TO CONVICT TRUMP 
BUT THAT IS WHAT THE SUPREME 

03:47:47.169 --> 03:47:50.562
COURT PRECEDENTS THAT WERE BEING
THROWN OUT, WHICH WE CAN DISSECT

03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:54.524
AND I THINK  IT WAS PRETTY 
SHODDY ANALYSIS IS NOT REALLY 

03:47:54.768 --> 03:47:56.768
APPLICABLE. THOSE KINDS OF 
ARGUMENTS COULD POTENTIALLY 

03:47:56.938 --> 03:48:00.434
OFFER SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR 
SOME OF THESE REPUBLICANS ON THE

03:48:00.793 --> 03:48:04.669
FENCE TO FALL BACK IN LINE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT 

03:48:05.076 --> 03:48:09.060
AS THEY SO OFTEN HAVE OVER THE 
LAST FOUR YEARS. 

03:48:09.061 --> 03:48:12.737
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WE DID SEE MINORITY 
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL HAD BACK 

03:48:13.068 --> 03:48:17.214
IN AND OFTENTIMES WHEN WE SEE 
HIM TAKE THAT WALK FROM HIS 

03:48:17.602 --> 03:48:20.756
OFFICE THERE OUTSIDE THE SENATE 
TAPER DOWN THE HALL, WE KNOW IT 

03:48:21.001 --> 03:48:24.176
IS ABOUT TIME TO HEAD BACK INTO 
THE CHAMBER. LET'S TALK ABOUT 

03:48:24.385 --> 03:48:26.982
WHAT IS YET TO COME. WE DO 
ANTICIPATE HEARING FROM BRUCE 

03:48:27.178 --> 03:48:30.046
CASTOR YET TODAY. WHAT ELSE WILL
YOU BE LISTENING FOR AS THESE 

03:48:30.345 --> 03:48:32.434
ARGUMENTS CONTINUE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE PROBABLY HAD ABOUT AN HOUR

03:48:32.704 --> 03:48:35.297
LEFT, MAYBE TWO OF THE DEFENSE 
ARGUMENTS. THAT IS WHAT THEY 

03:48:35.558 --> 03:48:38.459
SAID, THEY WERE ONLY GOING TO 
TAKE A QUARTER OF THEIR TIME. 

03:48:38.729 --> 03:48:41.798
WHEN WE STARTED TODAY'S SHOW, WE
RAN THAT CLIP OF BILL CASSIDY 

03:48:42.163 --> 03:48:44.443
SAYING HE IS INTERESTED IN THE 
DEFENSE TELLING THE SELLERS 

03:48:44.639 --> 03:48:47.505
WHERE WAS TRUMP AFTER HE LEARNED
THAT SUMMIT AND WAS HAPPENING 

03:48:47.725 --> 03:48:50.468
WITHIN THE CAPITOL? THAT HE WAS 
PREOCCUPIED WITH GETTING TOMMY 

03:48:50.738 --> 03:48:52.912
TURBERVILLE ON THE PHONE AND 
TRYING TO INTERRUPT THE 

03:48:53.194 --> 03:48:55.194
PROCEEDINGS OF JANUARY 6th 
INSTEAD OF HELPING SAVE 

03:48:55.342 --> 03:48:58.585
LAWMAKERS OR MIKE PENCE. BILL 
CASSIDY IS INTERESTED IN THEM 

03:48:58.831 --> 03:49:00.948
ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. THAT 
IS SOMETHING THE IMPACT MANAGERS

03:49:01.277 --> 03:49:04.937
ASK THE DEFENSE TOO. EXPLAIN 
TRUMP'S CONDUCT WHILE THE ATTACK

03:49:05.273 --> 03:49:08.322
ON THE CAPITOL WAS HAPPENING. 
THEY HAVE NOT YET TALKED ABOUT 

03:49:08.608 --> 03:49:11.388
TRUMP'S CONDUCT. I AM INTERESTED
TO SEE IF THEY WILL ADDRESS IT 

03:49:11.692 --> 03:49:14.394
AT ALL AND IF THEY DO, HOW WILL 
THEY ADDRESS THAT? 

03:49:14.395 --> 03:49:17.709
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, WE HEARD THE TEAM, AS 
RHONDA MENTIONED, LAYOUT THEY 

03:49:18.082 --> 03:49:20.920
WOULD ONLY BE TAKING THREE HOURS
OF THIS. THE NEXT PHASE WOULD BE

03:49:21.234 --> 03:49:24.631
GOING INTO THE QUESTION.. WE ARE
TWISTED TO SEE

03:49:28.942 --> 03:49:34.356
WHAT THE FLOW WOULD BE AND IF 
THEY GET INTO THAT TODAY, 

03:49:34.792 --> 03:49:38.699
PICKING UP THE PACE MOVING 
FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEPS OF 

03:49:39.368 --> 03:49:44.771
THIS PROCESS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I THINK SOME OF THAT 

03:49:45.369 --> 03:49:50.246
DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE DEFENSE 
TEAM GOES ANOTHER ONE HOUR OR 

03:49:50.458 --> 03:49:56.028
TWO HOURS. IF THEY ONLY GO AN 
HOUR AND THIS IS GOING TO BE 

03:49:56.821 --> 03:50:03.289
DAVID SCHOEN'S ARGUMENT, THEY 
COULD HAVE ANOTHER RECESS AND GO

03:50:03.891 --> 03:50:08.397
RIGHT INTO QUESTIONS . KAREN 
DOES POINT, IF THE TRUMP DEFENSE

03:50:08.690 --> 03:50:12.965
TEAM DOESN'T USE THEIR TIME TO 
ADDRESS THAT QUESTION OF WHY DID

03:50:13.369 --> 03:50:17.915
TRUMP WAIT SO LONG TO SEND HELP,
WHAT HE REALLY REVELING? IF THEY

03:50:18.177 --> 03:50:21.959
DIDN'T DENY THAT HE WAS 
REVELING, ALL THEY DID WAS SAY 

03:50:22.307 --> 03:50:26.191
THAT WE CAN'T TRUST PRESS 
REPORTS BASED ON SOURCES ABOUT 

03:50:26.581 --> 03:50:29.193
WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S 
MINDSET. THEY DIDN'T SAY IT 

03:50:29.549 --> 03:50:32.406
WASN'T TRUE. YOU WOULD EXPECT 
THAT SOME SENATORS, POTENTIALLY 

03:50:32.793 --> 03:50:36.901
THE PEOPLE ON THE FENCE I WAS 
TALKING ABOUT, BUT ASK WRITTEN 

03:50:37.150 --> 03:50:40.356
QUESTIONS FOR THE DEFENSE 
LAWYERS THAT FOLLOW UP ON THAT, 

03:50:40.639 --> 03:50:44.260
PERHAPS THAT FOLLOW UP ON THOSE 
FOUR QUESTIONS THAT JEANNIE 

03:50:44.628 --> 03:50:48.787
RASKIN POST AT THE END OF THE 
DAY YESTERDAY. IF THERE IS ONLY 

03:50:49.164 --> 03:50:53.531
ONE HOUR OF  DEFENSE ARGUMENT, I
THINK WE WOULD GET INTO THE 

03:50:53.878 --> 03:50:57.676
QUESTIONS. IF IT GOES LONGER, A 
LOT OF TIMES LAWYERS TALK MORE 

03:50:58.093 --> 03:51:04.450
TIME. THE THICK OF IT, THEN THEY
WILL AT 

03:51:07.595 --> 03:51:12.933
UP HAVING AN EARLIER DAY TODAY. 
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND I 

03:51:13.277 --> 03:51:17.805
THINK IN SOME PART, IN LARGE 
PART, IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG 

03:51:18.249 --> 03:51:20.721
DAVID SCHOEN  CHOOSES TO SPEAK 
FOR. 

03:51:20.722 --> 03:51:25.220
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. AS THEY LAID IT OUT, 
THOUGH, THEY TALKED ABOUT BRUCE 

03:51:25.469 --> 03:51:29.915
CASTOR NEXT TALKING ABOUT THE 
LAW AS IT APPLIES TO THE SPEECH 

03:51:30.319 --> 03:51:34.819
ON JANUARY 6th AND WE WILL SEE 
IF THERE IS ANY SUMMATION OR 

03:51:35.169 --> 03:51:39.025
ANYTHING AFTER THAT. WE ARE ALL 
WATCHING AND WONDERING IF BRUCE 

03:51:39.430 --> 03:51:42.148
CASTOR WOULD SPEAK. THE 
REPORTING WAS DONALD TRUMP WAS 

03:51:42.558 --> 03:51:44.950
VERY DISPLEASED WITH HIS 
PERFORMANCE EARLIER THIS WEEK. 

03:51:45.529 --> 03:51:50.716
LET'S ZOOM OUT FOR A MOMENT AND 
LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT 

03:51:50.904 --> 03:51:54.631
IS COMING UP. AFTER WE GET 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS, WE DO HAVE

03:51:54.979 --> 03:51:58.078
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE 
QUESTIONS. AFTER THAT PHASE, 

03:51:58.439 --> 03:52:01.203
THEY CAN CONSIDER AND VOTE 
WHETHER TO CALL WITNESSES. THEN 

03:52:01.532 --> 03:52:04.556
WE WILL HEAR THE CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS, WHICH WILL AGAIN BE 

03:52:04.959 --> 03:52:07.611
EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE 
HAVES IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND 

03:52:07.919 --> 03:52:10.723
TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS. FINALLY, THE 
SENATE WILL DELIBERATE AND VOTE 

03:52:11.041 --> 03:52:14.124
ON CONVICTION. REMINDER, YOU 
NEED THE 67 VOTES TO CONVICT. 

03:52:14.320 --> 03:52:17.034
JAMES, ANY DECISION THIS COULD 
WRAP UP TOMORROW? 

03:52:17.035 --> 03:52:20.741
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BOTH SIDES WANT TO GET THIS 
DONE, FRANKLY. THERE IS A DESIRE

03:52:20.988 --> 03:52:23.599
TO SEE WITNESSES, AS OUR 
COLLEAGUE RUSS HALDEMAN SAID 

03:52:23.997 --> 03:52:26.155
EARLIER. DEMOCRATS WANT TO MOVE 
ON TO ADVANCE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 

03:52:26.341 --> 03:52:28.341
AGENDA, THE BEST ONE AT NINE $20
PACKAGE NEXT WEEK. REPUBLICANS 

03:52:28.490 --> 03:52:30.490
OBVIOUSLY SQUIRMING I DON'T WANT
TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT DONALD

03:52:30.534 --> 03:52:33.154
TRUMP. THEY WANT TO MOVE ON AND 
SO I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO

03:52:33.342 --> 03:52:35.404
GET WITNESSES AND I DON'T KNOW 
HOW MANY QUESTIONS WE ARE GOING 

03:52:35.614 --> 03:52:38.141
TO GET. FEELS LIKE IT MAY NOT BE
THAT MANY. CERTAINLY IT WILL BE 

03:52:38.352 --> 03:52:40.241
FEWER THAN DOING THE UKRAINE 
IMPEACHMENT LAST YEAR. THERE IS 

03:52:40.242 --> 03:52:41.730
TOTALLY A SCENARIO WHERE THIS IS
DONE TOMORROW. 

03:52:41.731 --> 03:52:43.804
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, YOU KNOW, JAMES HAS 
BROUGHT UP WITNESSES. PART OF 

03:52:44.003 --> 03:52:45.681
THE JUSTIFICATION OF GOING 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS TO 

03:52:45.682 --> 03:52:47.728
PRESERVE THIS FOR POSTERITY AND 
TO GET EVERYTHING ON THE RECORD 

03:52:47.922 --> 03:52:50.183
AND DOCUMENTED. I HAVE TO BE 
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AND ASK WHY NOT

03:52:50.371 --> 03:52:52.159
THEN GET WITNESSES AS PART OF 
THIS MOMENT, RHONDA? 

03:52:52.160 --> 03:52:54.257
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE WINE THAT IS REALLY 
POLITICALLY BASED. THIS IS A 

03:52:54.454 --> 03:52:56.574
FUNCTION OF POLITICS HERE ON THE
HILL AND IMPEACHMENT IS. ADDING 

03:52:56.758 --> 03:52:58.565
WITNESSES WITH AT TIME, 
ESSENTIALLY, TO THE SCHEDULE OF 

03:52:58.566 --> 03:53:00.566
SENATORS. AS JAMES JUST POINTED 
OUT, BOTH SIDES REALLY WANT TO 

03:53:00.628 --> 03:53:02.731
MOVE ON. DEMOCRATS WANT TO MOVE 
ON BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE 

03:53:02.916 --> 03:53:07.984
BIDEN'S AGENDA SORT OF WAITING 
IN THE WINGS HERE. THEY HAD TO 

03:53:08.170 --> 03:53:10.571
PUT IT ON PAUSE ON THE SENATE 
SIDE. THE HOST SITE DID MARKUP 

03:53:10.771 --> 03:53:12.805
HIS $1.9 TRILLION COVID-19 PLAN,
THE NEXT RELIEF PACKAGE. THEY 

03:53:13.008 --> 03:53:18.287
ARE WORKING ON THAT AND TRYING 
TO GET TO THE FLOOR. THERE ARE 

03:53:18.487 --> 03:53:20.719
STILL A HANDFUL OF CONFIRMATIONS
THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN 

03:53:20.934 --> 03:53:22.934
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO

03:53:26.615 --> 03:53:28.667
GET SOME OF BIDEN'S CABINET 
ESTABLISHED. SO THERE IS SORT OF

03:53:28.853 --> 03:53:31.081
A LET'S WRAP THIS UP SPIRIT THAT
WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MAIN 

03:53:31.282 --> 03:53:33.114
REASON THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO 
PROLONG THIS BY CALLING 

03:53:33.115 --> 03:53:35.115
WITNESSES. I NEVER SAY ANYTHING 
IS OUT.

03:53:38.800 --> 03:53:41.033
WE VERY WELL COULD SEE THEM 
DECIDE TO VOTE TO ADD WITNESSES.

03:53:41.264 --> 03:53:43.828
IT IS LOOKING UNLIKELY AT THIS 
POINT. HOWEVER, I THINK BOTH 

03:53:44.011 --> 03:53:47.747
SITES KIND OF WANT TO MOVE ON 
WITH THIS AND I THINK WHAT WE 

03:53:47.945 --> 03:53:50.381
ARE ALL WATCHING AFTER THAT IS, 
WHAT DO THEY DO NEXT WITH THIS? 

03:53:50.579 --> 03:53:56.479
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM A VIEWER WHO
IS WONDERING WHAT DID HE DO IF 

03:53:56.680 --> 03:53:58.680
THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO 
CONVICT? IS THERE ANYTHING THEY 

03:53:58.712 --> 03:54:04.193
HAVE PUT FORWARD TO HOLD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR JANUARY 6th? FOR

03:54:04.395 --> 03:54:06.456
MY KNOWLEDGE, NO ONE HAS REALLY 
SET ANY OTHER MEASURES. THERE 

03:54:06.642 --> 03:54:08.642
WAS THE ATTEMPT TO POTENTIALLY 
CENSURE

03:54:11.298 --> 03:54:16.180
, BOTH MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND 
ALSO THE SENATE WHO MADE 

03:54:16.581 --> 03:54:18.773
DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS ABOUT 
JANUARY 6th AND

03:54:23.493 --> 03:54:27.348
TRIED TO CENSOR HIM. THOSE 
MEASURES HAVE REALLY NOT TAKEN 

03:54:27.546 --> 03:54:29.546
OFF. AFTER THIS

03:54:42.791 --> 03:54:45.024
, WE ARE REALLY WONDERING WHAT 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IS THIS 

03:54:45.224 --> 03:54:47.224
COMPLETELY DROPPED? IS JANUARY 
6th TOTALLY LEFT BEHIND AND MOVE

03:54:47.267 --> 03:54:50.105
ON? I AM NOT SURE. I GUESS THAT 
IS WHAT WE WILL BE WAITING FOR 

03:54:50.305 --> 03:54:51.921
AND WATCHING FOR IN THE NEXT FEW
DAYS. 

03:54:51.922 --> 03:54:54.266
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 
JAMES, IS THERE ANY APPETITE AT 

03:54:54.456 --> 03:54:56.605
THIS POINT FOR A CENSURE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS REALLY NOT GET LOST 

03:54:56.814 --> 03:54:59.439
IN, WE SAW A CLIP FROM ELIZABETH
WARREN AS SHE WAS WALKING OUT OF

03:54:59.653 --> 03:55:02.086
THE CAPITOL FOR THE DAY AND ONE 
OF THE REPORTERS ASKED IF SHE 

03:55:02.287 --> 03:55:04.523
WOULD BE OPEN TO CENSURE. IT 
SEEMS LIKE YOU WILL NOT HAVE 

03:55:04.722 --> 03:55:06.756
ENOUGH VOTES TO CONVICT AND SHE 
NOTABLY DID NOT ANSWER THE 

03:55:06.958 --> 03:55:08.958
QUESTION AND CRITICIZED TRUMP. 
TIM KAINE WAS PUSHING FOR IT 

03:55:09.026 --> 03:55:11.026
REALLY HARD. HE HAS PHYSICALLY 
SAID

03:55:14.076 --> 03:55:16.076
, THE 2016 VICE PRESIDENTIAL 
NOMINEE FROM VIRGINIA, HE HAS 

03:55:16.094 --> 03:55:18.188
BASICALLY SAID IT IS NOT GOING 
TO HAPPEN. HE COULDN'T GET 

03:55:18.401 --> 03:55:20.480
ENOUGH OF AN APPETITE. 
INTERESTINGLY, THOUGH, IT COULD 

03:55:20.728 --> 03:55:23.508
BE SOMETHING A COUPLE OF THE 
REPUBLICANS GOT WET. IF WE SEE 

03:55:23.874 --> 03:55:26.423
MOVEMENT FOR SOME SORT OF 
CENSURE VOTE, I EXPECT IT WOULD 

03:55:26.687 --> 03:55:28.795
COME FROM THE USUAL SUSPECTS, 
PROBABLY SOMEONE LIKE SUSAN 

03:55:29.083 --> 03:55:32.287
COLLINS, WHO WOULD SAY, YOU 
KNOW, I WANT TO VOTE TO CENSURE 

03:55:32.556 --> 03:55:34.837
TRUMP. EVEN REMEMBER ON THE HOST
SITE DURING THE IMPEACHMENT 

03:55:35.031 --> 03:55:37.031
PROCEEDINGS A FEW WEEKS AGO, 
KEVIN McCARTHY PUBLICLY FLOATED 

03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:40.549
DURING HIS SPEECH ON THE FLOOR A
CENSURE RESOLUTION. HE SAID HE 

03:55:40.740 --> 03:55:45.982
COULD SUPPORT CENSURING TRUMP 
FOR HIS ROLE ON JANUARY 6th. 

03:55:46.235 --> 03:55:48.235
THEY HAVE SORT OF BACKED AWAY 
FROM THE

03:55:56.749 --> 03:55:59.101
AS THE TROUBLESOME HAS WORKED TO
TRUMP'S ADVANTAGE AND THE PARTY 

03:55:59.325 --> 03:56:02.209
HAS FALLEN IN LINE. ULTIMATELY, 
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE ARE

03:56:02.404 --> 03:56:04.813
GOING TO GO THERE. I WOULD NOT 
BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME 

03:56:05.112 --> 03:56:12.194
REPUBLICANS SORT OF FLOAT THAT 
IN THE COMING HOURS AS A WAY TO 

03:56:12.890 --> 03:56:16.568
GIVE THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF 
AN ART. 

03:56:16.569 --> 03:56:21.049
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT MIGHT TAKE THE PRESSURE OF
THEM, AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT ON

03:56:21.476 --> 03:56:26.042
HOW THEY VOTE OVER THE NEXT 24 
TO 48 HOURS, JAMES.AS WE 

03:56:26.439 --> 03:56:30.302
PREPARED TO HEAD BACK, WE WERE 
GIVEN THE SENSE, JAMES, THERE 

03:56:30.678 --> 03:56:34.867
WOULD BE A COUPLE OF SMALL PICS 
EVERY TWO HOURS OR SO, 

03:56:35.245 --> 03:56:39.070
POTENTIALLY A DINNER BREAK. THE 
POTENTIAL TO PUSH ON TONIGHT 

03:56:39.321 --> 03:56:44.326
WITH THE QUESTIONS ONE WAIT AND 
KICK THAT OFF IN TOMORROW. THE 

03:56:44.737 --> 03:56:49.018
QUESTIONS ARE WRITTEN OUT. THIS 
IS SO UNUSUAL NOT TO BE ABLE TO 

03:56:49.537 --> 03:56:53.279
HEAR THE SENATORS IN THEIR OWN 
FORCES HAVE THE FLOOR. THAT 

03:56:53.667 --> 03:56:56.887
WRITING PROCESS, AS WE REMEMBER 
FROM LAST YEAR, SENATORS CAN 

03:56:57.620 --> 03:57:00.805
TEAM TOGETHER AND YOU WRITE AND 
SUBMIT A QUESTION, ASK A 

03:57:01.148 --> 03:57:10.506
QUESTION ON BEHALF OF A HANDFUL 
OF THEM, WHICH MAKES IT MORE 

03:57:11.354 --> 03:57:17.272
EFFICIENT. IT ALSO GIVES US SOME
INSIGHT INTO WHO IS THINKING 

03:57:17.729 --> 03:57:22.150
ABOUT WHAT, RIGHT? WHAT 
ALLEGIANCES ARE BEING FORMED IN 

03:57:22.574 --> 03:57:24.325
POLITICAL STRIPES AND BANDWIDTH,
JAMES. 

03:57:24.326 --> 03:57:28.172
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT IS EXCITING. IF 

03:57:28.503 --> 03:57:32.780
YOU LET THE SENATORS STAND UP TO
ASK HER QUESTIONS, WHICH WOULD 

03:57:33.184 --> 03:57:35.689
HAVE A LOT OF GRANDSTANDING AND 
THE QUESTION AND ANSWER TIME 

03:57:35.918 --> 03:57:39.144
WOULD LAST A LOT LONGER THAN IT 
IS IF THEY ARE WRITTEN 

03:57:39.446 --> 03:57:41.873
QUESTIONS. TWO, YOU ARE TOTALLY 
RIGHT. WHAT WAS ON LESSER DURING

03:57:42.098 --> 03:57:44.454
THE UKRAINE IMPEACHMENT WAS 
THERE WERE SOME OF THE SENATORS 

03:57:44.751 --> 03:57:47.941
WHO WERE ON THE FENCE THAT YOU 
SAW PEOPLE WHO WERE TRUMP WAIT 

03:57:48.239 --> 03:57:50.720
LISTS SIDLING UP TO THEM AND 
PARTNERING WITH THEM ON 

03:57:50.994 --> 03:57:54.885
QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO DO IT IN
A WAY TO KIND OF BRING THEM HOME

03:57:55.075 --> 03:57:57.665
TO TRUMP. IT WOULD BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF YOU THE 

03:57:57.872 --> 03:58:00.212
QUESTIONS WHERE YOU KIND OF HAVE
SOME MORE CONSERVATIVE SENATORS,

03:58:00.557 --> 03:58:04.450
TO TRUMP THE LIGHT SENATORS AND 
WITH PEOPLE LIKE MURKOWSKI AND 

03:58:04.676 --> 03:58:07.320
JOINTLY OFFER THE QUESTION. 
COULD BE A WINDOW INTO WHERE 

03:58:07.655 --> 03:58:10.373
SOMEONE LIKE BILL CASSIDY IS 
GOING. WE HEARD FROM HIM RIGHT 

03:58:10.645 --> 03:58:14.263
BEFORE THE START OF THE TRIAL 
TODAY WHERE HE SAID HE REALLY 

03:58:14.448 --> 03:58:17.306
DOES STILL HAVE AN OPEN MIND. 
PERHAPS HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND 

03:58:17.501 --> 03:58:20.151
AND HE IS JUST SAYING THAT. A 
QUESTION COULD BE A WINDOW INTO 

03:58:20.376 --> 03:58:22.504
IF HE ACTUALLY THEORIES ABOUT? 
THE OTHER THING THAT COULD 

03:58:22.840 --> 03:58:25.228
HAPPEN, THE B, THERE COULD BE 
SOME REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO 

03:58:25.437 --> 03:58:28.221
GENTLY SHOW THEIR CRITIQUE OF OR
DISDAIN FOR TRUMP BUT DON'T WANT

03:58:28.446 --> 03:58:31.043
TO VOTE TO CONVICT HIM AND SORT 
OF CENSURE, ASKING A TOUGH 

03:58:31.325 --> 03:58:34.786
QUESTION WOULD BE LIKE A WAY FOR
THEM TO SIGNAL THEY ARE UNEASY 

03:58:35.055 --> 03:58:37.942
WITH BUT TRUMPETED ON JANUARY 
6th. YOU COULD ALSO SEE SOME OF 

03:58:38.180 --> 03:58:40.122
THE REPUBLICANS ASKING TOUGH 
QUESTIONS OF THE HOUSE 

03:58:40.123 --> 03:58:42.621
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, YOU KNOW, 
IN A WAY THAT SEEMS DESIGNED TO 

03:58:42.997 --> 03:58:46.071
KIND OF GIVE THEM AN OUT TO LOOK
FOR REASONS TO JUSTIFY VOTING 

03:58:46.258 --> 03:58:48.705
NOT TO CONVICT TRUMP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "THE WASHINGTON POST" TRIGGER

03:58:49.046 --> 03:58:54.616
IS HARD AT WORK FACT CHECKING 
THESE ARGUMENT. JAMES, I WANT 

03:58:55.448 --> 03:59:00.260
POINT OUT ONE THAT THEY ARE 
TACKLING, FOR THAT WE HAVE SEEN 

03:59:00.626 --> 03:59:05.722
PLAYED NUMEROUS TIMES OF CHUCK 
SCHUMER, THE MAJORITY LEADER 

03:59:06.115 --> 03:59:09.742
TALKING ABOUT A WHIRLWIND BEING 
UNLEASHED ON JUSTICES OF THE 

03:59:10.021 --> 03:59:14.238
SUPREME COURT. A POINT THAT THE 
FACT IS MAKE IS THAT SCHUMER 

03:59:14.883 --> 03:59:19.317
APOLOGIZED THE NEXT DAY ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR, IN FACT NOT JUST 

03:59:19.548 --> 03:59:22.700
INFORMALLY OVERDREW BUT DID ON 
THE SENATE FLOOR AND SAID HE 

03:59:22.938 --> 03:59:25.411
SPOKE AND THERE WAS AN 
ADMONISHMENT THAT HAPPENED AFTER

03:59:25.731 --> 03:59:28.343
THAT. WE HAVE SORT OF SEEN 
CONSEQUENCES. LET'S TALK ABOUT 

03:59:28.597 --> 03:59:31.406
THE ISSUE OF INFLAMMATORY SPEECH
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, 

03:59:31.635 --> 03:59:34.990
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS 
REMORSEFUL TRIES TO CHANGE TONE.

03:59:35.367 --> 03:59:37.889
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS STRIKING IN THAT 
VIDEO, AGAIN, WHICH YOU POINTED 

03:59:38.173 --> 03:59:41.522
OUT LIBBY, THEY PLAYED A LOT OF 
THOSE CLIPS SEVEN TIMES. I WAS 

03:59:41.778 --> 03:59:44.446
STRUCK BY HOW MANY THINGS WERE 
DONE THAT WERE WIDELY CONDEMNED 

03:59:44.738 --> 03:59:46.738
AT THE TIME.

03:59:51.948 --> 03:59:54.485
YOU SAW MAXINE WATERS, WHO MADE 
THE COMMENT ABOUT GETTING IN 

03:59:54.787 --> 03:59:57.020
PEOPLE'S FACES. A LOT OF 
DEMOCRATS CRITICIZED THAT WHEN 

03:59:57.242 --> 03:59:59.657
SHE SAID IT. WHAT WAS 
INTERESTING WAS WHEN YOU SAW 

03:59:59.852 --> 04:00:02.024
TRUMP'S DEFENSE LAWYERS 
CRITICIZE JAMIE RASKIN AND OTHER

04:00:02.247 --> 04:00:04.450
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS FOR 
OBJECTING TO THE ELECTION 

04:00:04.702 --> 04:00:07.899
RESULTS FOUR YEARS AGO, THEY ARE
IN THAT VIDEO PLAYING JOE BIDEN,

04:00:08.160 --> 04:00:10.604
WHO WAS THEN VICE PRESIDENT, 
GAVILAN THEM DOWN AND TELLING 

04:00:10.830 --> 04:00:13.491
THEM THEY WERE OUT OF ORDER AND 
NOT LETTING THEM DELIVER 

04:00:13.746 --> 04:00:15.746
LONG-WINDED SPEECHES BECAUSE 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE SENATORS WHO 

04:00:15.847 --> 04:00:19.372
WERE JOINING THEIR OBJECTIONS. 
SEVERAL OF THE CLIPS WERE TV 

04:00:19.606 --> 04:00:22.213
PERSONALITIES. ONE WAS A 
MICHIGAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE. 

04:00:22.616 --> 04:00:25.865
THESE AREN'T EVEN MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, LET ALONE THE SENATE. 

04:00:26.282 --> 04:00:29.861
A LOT OF TIMES, WHEN THEY WERE 
MAKING THESE KINDS OF OUTRAGEOUS

04:00:30.177 --> 04:00:32.712
CLAIMS, THEY DID APOLOGIZE OR 
THEY WERE DISTANCED

04:00:38.266 --> 04:00:40.311
, THEY SAW POLITICIANS DISTANCED
THEMSELVES. SCHUMER, AS YOU 

04:00:40.518 --> 04:00:42.518
NOTE, THAT WAS A BIG DEAL AT THE
TIME

04:00:45.768 --> 04:00:48.464
BUT HE REALLY WAS VERY CONTRITE 
ABOUT IT AND ALSO, IN ADDITION 

04:00:48.786 --> 04:00:51.152
TO THE FLOOR SPEECH, PERSONALLY 
REACHED OUT TO THE JUSTICES TO 

04:00:51.356 --> 04:00:54.717
APOLOGIZE. THAT IS A KEY 
DISTINCTION. IT GETS TO A 

04:00:54.987 --> 04:00:56.987
CENTRAL PART OF THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS CASE

04:01:01.874 --> 04:01:03.874
LAW WHICH IS THE DEFENSE TEAM 
HASN'T ADDRESSED, PERHAPS THEY 

04:01:04.047 --> 04:01:06.536
WILL THIS AFTERNOON, WHICH IS 
WHY HE HASN'T SHOWN ANY 

04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:09.671
CONTRITION AT ALL, ANY REMORSE 
FOR PUTTING HIS SUPPORTERS IN 

04:01:09.903 --> 04:01:12.361
SUCH A SPACE WHERE THEY COULD GO
TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS

04:01:20.711 --> 04:01:22.961
? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WANT TO CALL THEM, I WANT TO 

04:01:23.155 --> 04:01:25.412
SHARE WITH YOU OUR COLLEAGUES 
ARE REPORTING THAT THE POST THAT

04:01:25.645 --> 04:01:27.720
SENATOR MITT ROMNEY IS TELLING 
REPORTERS HE HAS DRAFTED FIVE 

04:01:27.906 --> 04:01:30.158
QUESTIONS. HE PLANS TO POSE AND 
HAS NOT COORDINATED WITH 

04:01:30.361 --> 04:01:32.657
COLLEAGUES ON THEM AT THIS 
POINT. LET'S CIRCLE BACK THOUGH 

04:01:32.898 --> 04:01:35.616
TO AN IMPORTANT CHANGE WAS 
MAKING. THE FOOTAGE WE SAW OF 

04:01:35.861 --> 04:01:40.067
HOUSE DEMOCRATS TRYING TO OBJECT
TO THE CERTIFICATION OF DONALD 

04:01:40.409 --> 04:01:45.320
TRUMP'S ELECTION, SOME OF THEM, 
JAMIE RASKIN, VERY PROMINENT IN 

04:01:45.655 --> 04:01:47.655
THIS PROCESS

04:01:48.939 --> 04:01:52.094
, BUT WE ALSO SAW THE FOOTAGE OF
JOE BIDEN STOPPING IT. JOE 

04:01:52.284 --> 04:01:54.284
BIDEN, THEN VICE PRESIDENT,

04:01:59.768 --> 04:02:01.768
VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 
ELECTION RESULTS BECAUSE HE 

04:02:01.847 --> 04:02:04.058
WANTED HILLARY CLINTON TO WIN, 
JUST SHUTTING IT DOWN, DOING THE

04:02:04.302 --> 04:02:06.302
PROCEDURAL THING EVERYONE 
EXPECTED MIKE PENCE TO DO THIS 

04:02:06.837 --> 04:02:09.524
TIME AROUND AS WELL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ADDED 

04:02:10.089 --> 04:02:12.457
CONTEXT TO THOSE VIDEOS TOO. I 
DID SOME REPORTING ON THE 

04:02:12.652 --> 04:02:17.827
JANUARY 6th PROCESS WILL BEFORE 
THE ACTUAL DATE OF JANUARY 6th 

04:02:18.059 --> 04:02:20.718
TO GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA OF WHAT 
THAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY, WHY IT

04:02:20.957 --> 04:02:25.199
HAPPENS. TYPICALLY IT IS AN 
EVENT THAT A LOT OF SENATORS 

04:02:25.409 --> 04:02:27.836
DON'T EVEN GO TO BECAUSE IT IS 
USUALLY JUST MORE ABOUT CEREMONY

04:02:28.116 --> 04:02:30.435
WHERE THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT
COMES IN, HE OVERSEES THE 

04:02:31.005 --> 04:02:35.152
PROCESS BUT NO HOUSE MANAGERS 
OFTEN DO OBJECT. THEY KNOW THEY 

04:02:35.489 --> 04:02:39.929
DON'T HAVE A SENATOR JOINED THEM
BUT THEY WILL FOR THEIR OWN 

04:02:40.326 --> 04:02:43.447
POLITICS GET UP AND SAY THEY 
OBJECT. 

04:02:43.448 --> 04:02:46.647
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOUSE MEMBERS, RONDO. HOUSE 
MEMBERS OF ALL KINDS. 

04:02:46.648 --> 04:02:50.704
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. YES. THEY USUALLY 
OBJECT. GOING BACK MANY YEARS, 

04:02:50.896 --> 04:02:55.544
MANY JANUARY 6th DATES, THEY 
USUALLY OBJECT AND DON'T HAVE A 

04:02:55.981 --> 04:02:57.981
SENATOR TO SIGN ON TO THAT

04:03:02.935 --> 04:03:05.558
OBJECTION, WHICH WOULD BE THE 
EFFECT THAT STALLS THE 

04:03:05.967 --> 04:03:10.007
CERTIFICATION PROCESS, WHICH IS 
WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME AROUND. 

04:03:10.270 --> 04:03:13.650
THAT HAS ONLY HAPPENED TWICE IN 
HISTORY BEFORE THIS LAST JANUARY

04:03:13.840 --> 04:03:17.869
6th. THIS LAW HAS BEEN, THIS HAS
BEEN A PART OF THE CONSTITUTION 

04:03:18.336 --> 04:03:22.225
SINCE THE LATE 1800S. IT HAS 
ONLY HAPPENED TWICE UNTIL THIS 

04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:25.240
JANUARY 6th. THAT WAS SOMETHING 
THAT THE DEFENSE TEAM DID NOT 

04:03:25.641 --> 04:03:29.445
REALLY POINT OUT IS THAT THESE 
HOUSE MEMBERS WHO DID OBJECT IN 

04:03:29.696 --> 04:03:34.353
THE PAST,  RASKIN, OTHERS , IT 
IS KIND OF COMMON PRACTICE AND 

04:03:34.749 --> 04:03:37.526
IT REALLY NEVER LEADS TO 
ANYTHING. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT 

04:03:37.942 --> 04:03:40.676
ABOUT THIS JANUARY 6th IF YOU 
HAD SENATORS WHO JOINED HOUSE 

04:03:40.946 --> 04:03:42.791
MEMBERS OBJECTIONS MISSPELLED 
THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS 

04:03:42.792 --> 04:03:49.743
MULTIPLE TIMES, AND THAT WAS THE
DIFFERENCE THERE. THEY DID POINT

04:03:50.246 --> 04:03:56.336
OUT THAT JAMIE RASKIN DID THIS 
BEFORE. I AM NOT BLAMING WHY. I 

04:03:56.650 --> 04:03:59.631
THINK WE ARE BACK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS WILL TAKE THEIR 

04:04:00.067 --> 04:04:02.067
SEATS.

04:04:04.031 --> 04:04:06.031
WHO SEEKS RECOGNITION?

04:04:10.052 --> 04:04:12.489
MR. CASTOR IS RECOGNIZED.

04:04:23.937 --> 04:04:29.388
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE, GOOD AFTERNOON. IT HAS 

04:04:29.922 --> 04:04:35.102
BEEN MY GREAT PRIVILEGE OVER THE
PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS TO LEAD 

04:04:35.446 --> 04:04:38.413
THIS OUTSTANDING TEAM OF LAWYERS
AND DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS IN 

04:04:38.827 --> 04:04:43.929
THE DEFENSE OF THE 45th 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

04:04:48.934 --> 04:04:52.971
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS
IN LEADING SUCH A TALENTED GROUP

04:04:53.327 --> 04:04:58.302
IS DECIDING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR WHAT AND THE STRATEGY AND 

04:04:58.690 --> 04:05:03.016
THE ORDER IN WHICH WE WILL 
PRESENT OUR EVIDENCE. YOU HAVE 

04:05:03.449 --> 04:05:08.799
HEARD FROM MR. VAN DER VEEN  AND
MR. SCHOEN  ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

04:05:09.442 --> 04:05:12.612
THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE 
IMPORTANCE OF DUE PROCESS OF 

04:05:12.965 --> 04:05:19.791
LAW. BECAUSE I HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SET UP THE 

04:05:19.990 --> 04:05:24.670
SCHEDULE, I DECIDED I WOULD TAKE
THE LAST SUBSTANTIVE PART OF THE

04:05:24.869 --> 04:05:31.776
CASE FOR MYSELF. YOU CAN TAKE 
THAT TWO WAYS. THE FIRST, 

04:05:31.974 --> 04:05:35.367
PERHAPS, IS THE BEST AND THAT 
WOULD BE THAT IT IS ALMOST OVER.

04:05:36.453 --> 04:05:41.736
THE SECOND IS THAT, PERHAPS YOU 
HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER HOUR FOR IT

04:05:41.934 --> 04:05:43.934
TO BE OVER.

04:05:47.620 --> 04:05:49.856
THE REASON WHY I CHOSE THIS 
SECTION, AND BELIEVE ME, IT WAS 

04:05:50.056 --> 04:05:52.298
A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO 
MAKE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THE 

04:05:52.522 --> 04:05:56.161
OTHER ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY MR.
SCHOEN AND MR. VAN DER VEEN WERE

04:05:56.358 --> 04:05:59.754
OUTSTANDINGLY RESEARCHED, THE 
REALLY  VETTED AND WONDERFULLY 

04:05:59.942 --> 04:06:04.688
AND ARTICULATELY PRESENTED BY 
THEM, BUT 

04:06:06.257 --> 04:06:10.519
THIS CASE IS THE

04:06:16.268 --> 04:06:18.087
VERY NARROW ISSUE THAT IS 
CHARGED AGAINST THE 45th 

04:06:18.088 --> 04:06:21.535
PRESIDENT. THAT ISSUE IS 
COMMITTED TO THE 45th PRESIDENT 

04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:27.378
ENGAGED IN INCITEMENT OF, THEY 
CONTINUE TO SAY, INSURRECTION. 

04:06:27.572 --> 04:06:34.129
CLEARLY THERE WAS NO 
INSURRECTION. INSURRECTION IS A 

04:06:34.342 --> 04:06:37.179
TERM DEFINED IN THE LAW THAT 
INVOLVES TAKING OVER A COUNTRY, 

04:06:37.392 --> 04:06:39.968
A SHADOW GOVERNMENT, TAKING THE

04:06:44.093 --> 04:06:46.726
TV STATIONS OVER AND HAVING SOME
PLAN ON WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO

04:06:46.927 --> 04:06:50.993
WHEN YOU FINALLY TAKE POWER. 
CLEARLY THIS IS NOT THAT. WITH 

04:06:51.194 --> 04:06:53.765
OUR COLLEAGUES HERE ACROSS THE 
AISLE MEANT IS INCITEMENT TO 

04:06:54.604 --> 04:07:00.259
VIOLENCE, TO WRITE IT. THE WORD 
INCITEMENT IS THE CRITICAL CASE

04:07:01.763 --> 04:07:07.244
AND THE CRITICAL ISSUE IN THE 
CASE. THE FIRST TIME YOU HEARD 

04:07:08.008 --> 04:07:14.961
FROM US, I TOLD YOU THAT YOU 
WOULD NEVER HEAR FROM OUR SIDE 

04:07:15.374 --> 04:07:17.742
THAT WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 
6th WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN 

04:07:17.927 --> 04:07:24.305
HORRIFIC. THE 44th PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND HIS 

04:07:24.505 --> 04:07:26.505
LAWYERS AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM

04:07:34.816 --> 04:07:36.816
ADAMANTLY DENIES

04:07:40.152 --> 04:07:42.152
THAT VIOLENCE BY THOSE CRIMINALS
THAT OCCURRED IN THIS VERY 

04:07:42.184 --> 04:07:44.303
CHAMBER, IN THIS VERY BUILDING. 
THERE WAS A REASON WHY WE 

04:07:44.496 --> 04:07:46.788
STARTED OUR PRESENTATION ON 
TUESDAY IN THAT WAY.

04:07:52.138 --> 04:07:54.472
BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT THE 
SENATORS TO CONSIDER THAT THERE 

04:07:54.662 --> 04:08:00.000
WAS ANY CHALLENGE TO THAT 
PARTICULAR FACT.

04:08:04.252 --> 04:08:08.601
MANAGERS, KNOWING IT WAS NOT 
CONTESTED AT ALL, CHOSE 

04:08:12.395 --> 04:08:14.395
14+ HOURS

04:08:18.337 --> 04:08:20.337
SHOWING YOU PICTURES OF HOW 
HORRIFIC THE ATTACK ON THE 

04:08:20.368 --> 04:08:26.210
UNITED STATES CAPITOL WAS. THEY 
SPEND NO TIME AT ALL IN 

04:08:26.400 --> 04:08:34.787
CONNECTING, LEGALLY, THE ATTACK 
ON THE CAPITOL TO 

04:08:35.401 --> 04:08:38.249
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
WHICH IS THE ONLY QUESTION THAT 

04:08:38.449 --> 04:08:42.103
NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED. WAS DONALD
TRUMP RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING 

04:08:42.868 --> 04:08:48.571
THE VIOLENCE THAT CAME TO THIS 
BUILDING ON JANUARY 6th.

04:08:59.984 --> 04:09:05.051
NOW, BY ANY MEASURE, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS THE MOST 

04:09:08.304 --> 04:09:11.968
ANTI-MARTIN WILL PRESIDENT THIS 
COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. HIS REAL 

04:09:12.174 --> 04:09:19.271
SUPPORTERS KNOW THIS. HE MADE IT
CLEAR THROUGHOUT HIS PRESIDENCY.

04:09:19.558 --> 04:09:21.766
HE MADE IT CLEAR DURING THE 
VIOLENCE THIS PAST SUMMER. HE 

04:09:21.958 --> 04:09:31.161
MADE IT CLEAR ON JANUARY 6th. 
BUT POLITICS CHANGES THINGS.

04:09:35.278 --> 04:09:38.842
POLITICS HAS CREATED AND 
INTERPOSED

04:09:45.890 --> 04:09:48.329
ELEMENT THAT SHOULD NOT BE HERE.
IT HAS BEEN TO POST THE ELEMENT 

04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:52.330
OF HATRED. THE POLITICAL WORLD 
CHANGES WHEN HATRED BECOMES PART

04:09:53.200 --> 04:09:55.200
OF THE DYNAMIC.

04:09:57.662 --> 04:10:01.456
AS WE WROTE IN OUR ANSWER TO THE
ORIGINAL CHARGING DOCUMENT

04:10:04.979 --> 04:10:08.382
, AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS A 
PHRASE THAT LIVES ON LONG AFTER 

04:10:08.566 --> 04:10:14.678
WE ARE ALL DEPARTED AND THAT I 
HOPE SOMEDAY THIS BECOMES THE 

04:10:14.892 --> 04:10:20.561
MANTRA BY WHICH ALL OF US 
OPERATE

04:10:23.875 --> 04:10:29.759
OF THE PUBLIC. POLITICAL HATRED 
HAS NO PLACE IN THE AMERICAN 

04:10:30.520 --> 04:10:35.396
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MOST 
CERTAINLY NO PLACE IN THE 

04:10:35.602 --> 04:10:37.602
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.

04:10:45.823 --> 04:10:49.414
TO ILLUSTRATE THE CONTRAST THAT 
I AM SPEAKING OF, WE HAVE A 

04:10:49.602 --> 04:10:53.731
VIDEO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM YOUR PRESIDENT OF LAW 

04:10:54.495 --> 04:10:57.503
AND ORDER AND AN ALLY OF ALL 
PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. 

04:10:57.504 --> 04:11:00.781
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 
PROTEST HAS BEEN PEACEFUL.

04:11:04.898 --> 04:11:08.586
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPUBLICANS STAND FOR LAW AND
ORDER AND WE STAND FOR JUSTICE. 

04:11:08.773 --> 04:11:10.773
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T EVEN KNOW

04:11:22.378 --> 04:11:24.378
WHY THERE AREN'T UPRISINGS ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY. MAYBE THERE 

04:11:24.443 --> 04:11:25.827
WILL BE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY ADMINISTRATOR AND WILL 

04:11:25.828 --> 04:11:27.245
ALWAYS STAND AGAINST VIOLENCE, 
MAYHEM, AND DISORDER. 

04:11:27.246 --> 04:11:29.882
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE NEEDS TO BE UNREST IN 
THE STREET FOR AS LONG AS THERE 

04:11:30.096 --> 04:11:32.642
IS UNREST IN OUR LIVES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I STAND FOR THE HEROES OF LAW

04:11:32.825 --> 04:11:34.825
AND ORDER. WE WILL NEVER

04:11:38.425 --> 04:11:40.444
DEFINED OUR POLICE. TOGETHER, WE
WILL ENSURE AMERICA IS A NATION 

04:11:40.659 --> 04:11:43.697
OF LAW AND ORDER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK 

04:11:43.898 --> 04:11:48.776
AND PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST WANT LAW AND ORDER. 

04:11:48.977 --> 04:11:54.117
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE 

04:11:54.318 --> 04:11:57.861
RELEASED THE WHIRLWIND AND YOU 
WILL PAY THE PRICE.

04:12:02.178 --> 04:12:04.825
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WANT LAW AND ORDER. WE 
HAVE TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER. 

04:12:04.826 --> 04:12:07.262
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHOW ME WHERE IT SAYS PROTEST
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POLITE AND 

04:12:07.463 --> 04:12:11.341
PEACEFUL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE BELIEVE IN SAFE, SECURE 

04:12:11.527 --> 04:12:12.943
COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE IN LAW 
AND ORDER. 

04:12:12.944 --> 04:12:17.624
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THERE TRULY ANYONE IN THIS
CHAMBER WHO DISAGREES WITH THE 

04:12:17.825 --> 04:12:23.027
WORDS AS A SPOKEN BY RESIDENT 
TRUMP ON THAT VIDEO? SURELY NOT.

04:12:24.486 --> 04:12:30.166
SURELY NOT. THIS CONTRAST AND IN
THIS CONTEXT

04:12:33.772 --> 04:12:39.967
IT IN MIND. MY COLLEAGUES HERE, 
ACTUALLY MY 

04:12:42.815 --> 04:12:46.586
RASKIN HOPES THAT YOU DON'T . 
THEY HAVE USED

04:12:50.935 --> 04:12:52.788
SELECTIVE EDITING, MANIPULATED 
VISUALS TO PAINT A PICTURE FAR 

04:12:52.789 --> 04:12:54.789
DIFFERENT FROM THIS TRUTH

04:12:57.234 --> 04:12:59.870
. MAKE NO MISTAKE, AND I WILL 
REPEAT IT NOW AND ANYTIME I AM 

04:13:00.636 --> 04:13:04.954
EVER ASKED FOR JANUARY 6th WAS A
TERRIBLE DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

04:13:05.155 --> 04:13:07.155
THE ATTACK ON THIS BUILDING 
SHOCKED US ALL.

04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:14.469
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT INCITE 
OR CAUSE THE HORRIFIC VIOLENCE 

04:13:14.503 --> 04:13:19.168
THAT OCCURRED ON JANUARY 6th, 
2021. THEY KNOW THAT. 

04:13:24.852 --> 04:13:27.086
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT INCITE A 
RIOT BECAUSE OF HIS PLAIN WORDS 

04:13:27.288 --> 04:13:29.288
THAT DAY, AS MR. VAN DER VEEN 

04:13:34.203 --> 04:13:36.436
ELUCIDATED ON A FEW MOMENTS AGO.
WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT 

04:13:36.637 --> 04:13:38.870
HAVE INCITED THE RIOTS BECAUSE 
OF THE TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS OF

04:13:39.076 --> 04:13:42.884
THAT DAY. WE HEARD A GREAT DEAL 
FROM THE HOUSE MANAGERS ABOUT 

04:13:43.068 --> 04:13:46.953
THEIR PROSECUTORIAL BONA FIDES 
AND THEIR ABILITY TO ANALYZE

04:13:50.854 --> 04:13:52.854
THE EVIDENCE, APPLIED TO 
STATUTES, USE TIMELINES AND TO 

04:13:53.242 --> 04:13:55.393
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED BASED 
ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND 

04:13:55.589 --> 04:13:59.544
DIRECT EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY 
AND FORENSIC ANALYSIS. I CAN'T 

04:13:59.728 --> 04:14:05.279
RECALL ANY OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS
WHO GOT UP THAT DIDN'T MAKE 

04:14:06.250 --> 04:14:11.778
REFERENCE TO PROSECUTORIAL BONA 
FIDES. I SPENT MORE THAN THREE 

04:14:11.980 --> 04:14:13.980
DECADES LOCKING UP KILLERS

04:14:17.664 --> 04:14:22.342
. I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
APPLYING THE FACTS TO THE LAW. 

04:14:22.743 --> 04:14:25.191
WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD
NEVER HAVE WANTED SUCH A RIOT TO

04:14:25.391 --> 04:14:29.656
OCCUR BECAUSE HIS LONG-STANDING 
HATRED FOR VIOLENT PROTESTERS 

04:14:30.058 --> 04:14:34.460
AND HIS LOVE FOR LAW AND ORDER 
IS ON DISPLAY, WORN ON HIS 

04:14:34.656 --> 04:14:39.607
SLEEVE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT HE 
SERVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT 

04:14:39.809 --> 04:14:44.413
IF WE ARE GOING TO APPLY THE 
FACTS TO THE STATUTE

04:14:46.307 --> 04:14:50.183
BE DONE SYSTEMATICALLY. IT HAS 
TO BE DONE WITH PRECISION

04:14:54.437 --> 04:14:59.084
THE WAY A COURT WOULD EXPECT US 
TO DO THAT. LET'S LOOK AT THE 

04:14:59.524 --> 04:15:01.524
LETTER OF THE LAW. AGAIN,

04:15:05.403 --> 04:15:07.637
MR. VAN DER VEEN GIVES YOU AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE BRANDENBURG CASE

04:15:07.851 --> 04:15:10.488
AND SOME OF THE RELATED CASES. 
HE NOTED THAT  WHEN MR. VAN DER 

04:15:10.689 --> 04:15:13.683
VEEN  LIST AT THE ELEMENTS THAT 
HE TOOK VERBATIM OR CLOSE TO 

04:15:13.869 --> 04:15:16.114
VERBATIM OUT OF VANDERBURGH, 
THEY TOOK NO

04:15:20.025 --> 04:15:24.491
RELEVANCE TO WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC
MANAGERS BROUGHT UP REPEATEDLY. 

04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:27.276
HE ACTUALLY USED THE SUPREME 
COURT CASE. HE DIDN'T MAKE IT 

04:15:27.462 --> 04:15:32.622
UP. LET'S LOOK AT THE LETTER OF 
THE LAW. THE SUPREME COURT OF 

04:15:32.822 --> 04:15:37.093
THE UNITED STATES OVER 50 YEARS 
AGO LAID OUT A CLEAR TEST TO 

04:15:37.289 --> 04:15:39.681
DETERMINE WHETHER SPEECH IS 
INCITEMENT.

04:15:45.821 --> 04:15:47.821
UNDER THAT TEST, THE BRANDENBURG
VERSUS OHIO TEST, THERE ARE 

04:15:47.854 --> 04:15:52.671
THREE ELEMENTS THAT MUST BE 
PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT

04:15:57.803 --> 04:15:59.847
, BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE 
EVIDENCE, BUT IF THE SENATE 

04:16:00.047 --> 04:16:01.867
CONSIDERS I SUGGEST BEYOND A 
REASONABLE DOUBT. FIRST, THE 

04:16:01.868 --> 04:16:06.748
SPEECH IN QUESTION MUST 
EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY 

04:16:07.151 --> 04:16:12.386
ENCOURAGE THE USE OF VIOLENCE OR
LAWLESS ACTION. HERE, THE 

04:16:12.578 --> 04:16:16.097
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH CALLED FOR 
PEACEFUL PROTEST. SECOND THE 

04:16:16.296 --> 04:16:22.400
SPEAKER MUST INTEND THAT HIS 
SPEECH WILL RESULT IN THE USE OF

04:16:22.599 --> 04:16:29.491
VIOLENCE OR LAWLESS ACTION. 
AGAIN, AS MR. VAN DER VEEN 

04:16:29.707 --> 04:16:32.540
POINTED OUT, THE PRESIDENT  
CLEARLY DEPLORES RIOTERS AND 

04:16:33.307 --> 04:16:36.606
POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND DID SO 
THROUGHOUT HIS TERM AS PRESIDENT

04:16:36.805 --> 04:16:38.805
AND NEVER HESITATED TO

04:16:42.291 --> 04:16:44.888
EXPRESS HIS ADMIRATION FOR THE 
MEN AND WOMEN THAT PROTECT THIS 

04:16:45.079 --> 04:16:48.946
COUNTRY. FINALLY, THE THIRD 
ELEMENT UNDER THE BRANDENBURG 

04:16:49.134 --> 04:16:53.078
TEST IS THE IMMINENT USE OF 
VIOLENCE, IMMINENT USE OF 

04:16:53.267 --> 04:16:56.720
VIOLENCE, IN OTHER WORDS, RIGHT 
THEN. THE IMMINENT USE OF 

04:16:56.921 --> 04:17:02.151
VIOLENCE OR LAWLESS ACTION MUST 
BE THE LIKELY RESULT OF THE 

04:17:02.422 --> 04:17:10.739
SPEECH. THE LIKELY RESULT OF THE
SPEECH. THAT ARGUMENT IS 

04:17:10.937 --> 04:17:13.203
COMPLETELY EVISCERATED BY THE 
FACT THAT THE VIOLENCE WAS

04:17:17.237 --> 04:17:19.237
PREPLANNED, AS CONFIRMED BY THE 
FBI, THE APARTMENT JUSTICE, AND 

04:17:19.270 --> 04:17:22.227
EVEN THE HOUSE MANAGERS, NOT THE
RESULT OF THE SPEECH AT ALL. 

04:17:22.521 --> 04:17:24.521
SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES

04:17:30.435 --> 04:17:32.467
GOT UP AND SPOKE ABOUT THE 
PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE BEING 

04:17:32.669 --> 04:17:34.669
LIKE A GRAND JURY PROCEEDING.

04:17:41.205 --> 04:17:43.437
WELL, I HAVE BEEN IN GRAND JURY 
PROCEEDINGS. I HAVE RUN GRAND 

04:17:43.637 --> 04:17:45.287
JURIES. IN GRAND JURY 
PROCEEDINGS, TO CALL WITNESSES. 

04:17:45.288 --> 04:17:47.088
YOU HEAR EVIDENCE. YOU MAKE 
TRANSCRIPTS. YOU TAKE AFFIDAVITS

04:17:47.089 --> 04:17:51.771
YOU DEVELOP PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. 
YOU HEAR REPORTS FROM POLICE 

04:17:51.985 --> 04:17:53.790
OFFICERS, TO HEAR FORENSIC 
ANALYSIS FROM SCIENTISTS. IN 

04:17:53.791 --> 04:17:59.487
FACT, YOU INVITE THE TARGET OF 
THE GRAND JURY TO COME IN AND 

04:17:59.688 --> 04:18:06.387
TESTIFY IF HE OR SHE PLACES TO 
BE HEARD BY THE GRAND JURY. 

04:18:06.788 --> 04:18:12.692
WHICH ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE PRIOR TO 

04:18:13.088 --> 04:18:15.088
THE IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE?

04:18:18.173 --> 04:18:22.238
I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THEM 
HAPPENED. THE SUGGESTION THAT 

04:18:22.440 --> 04:18:26.445
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE WAS 
ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE A GRAND 

04:18:26.632 --> 04:18:31.175
JURY INVESTIGATING A CASE AND 
PERFORMING IT FOR PROSECUTION IS

04:18:31.934 --> 04:18:33.934
COMPLETE NONSENSE.

04:18:37.672 --> 04:18:40.103
IF THE HOUSE MANAGERS ARE TRYING
TO FOOL YOU ABOUT THAT, YOU MUST

04:18:40.718 --> 04:18:43.290
ASK YOURSELF, WHAT ELSE ARE THEY
TRYING TO FOOL YOU ABOUT?

04:18:47.365 --> 04:18:49.845
LET'S LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE 
PRESIDENTS SPEECH.

04:18:54.931 --> 04:18:57.166
WE HAVE MENTIONED THIS LINE 
BEFORE BUT IT IS SO CRITICAL WE 

04:18:57.935 --> 04:18:59.935
NEED TO

04:19:04.479 --> 04:19:06.311
TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN. THE 
PRESIDENT ASKED THAT ATTENDEES 

04:19:06.312 --> 04:19:07.941
AT HIS RALLY PEACEABLY MAKE 
THEIR VOICES HEARD. 

04:19:07.942 --> 04:19:10.177
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW EVERYONE HERE WILL 
SOON BE MARCHING OVER TO THE 

04:19:10.573 --> 04:19:14.497
CAPITOL BUILDING TO PEACEFULLY 
AND PATRIOTICALLY MAKE YOUR 

04:19:15.200 --> 04:19:17.200
VOICES HEARD.

04:19:27.638 --> 04:19:29.638
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT THE MANAGERS WOULD HAVE 
YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT'S 

04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:33.932
SUPPORTERS USUALLY FOLLOW HIS 
EVERY WORD. IN THIS CASE 

04:19:34.349 --> 04:19:38.034
INCLUDED SOME IMAGINARY MEANING 
TO THEM WHILE IGNORING HIS

04:19:40.996 --> 04:19:45.649
CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAID PEACEFULLY AND 

04:19:45.836 --> 04:19:48.220
PATRIOTICALLY MAKE YOUR VOICES 
HEARD AND THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

04:19:48.412 --> 04:19:52.340
TOOK FROM THAT, GO DOWN TO THE 
CAPITOL AND RIOT.

04:19:56.687 --> 04:20:01.362
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT 
YOURSELVES IN THE HANDS OF THE 

04:20:01.563 --> 04:20:05.627
PEOPLE WHO HEAR PEACEFULLY AND 
PATRIOTICALLY MAKE YOUR VOICES 

04:20:05.828 --> 04:20:10.294
HEARD AND CONCLUDE THAT THOSE 
WORDS DO NOT MEAN WHAT THE 

04:20:11.058 --> 04:20:17.357
PRESIDENT SAID. MORE THAN THAT, 
THE PRESIDENT CRITICIZED THE 

04:20:17.546 --> 04:20:22.894
DESTRUCTION WROUGHT BY LEFT-WING
ANARCHISTS AND RIOTERS. HE TOLD 

04:20:23.661 --> 04:20:25.661
HIS SUPPORTERS

04:20:27.763 --> 04:20:28.979
THAT THEY BUILD, THEY DON'T 
DESTROY. 

04:20:28.980 --> 04:20:34.265
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF THIS HAPPENED TO THE 
DEMOCRATS, THERE WOULD BE ALL 

04:20:34.465 --> 04:20:36.696
OVER THE COUNTRY GOING ON. THERE
WOULD BE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

04:20:36.911 --> 04:20:39.643
JUST REMEMBER THIS, YOU ARE 
STRONGER YOU ARE SMARTER, YOU'VE

04:20:40.296 --> 04:20:44.980
GOT MORE GOING THAN ANYBODY AND 
THEY TRY AND DO YOU MEAN 

04:20:45.167 --> 04:20:48.482
EVERYBODY HAVING TO DO WITH US 
AND YOU ARE THE REAL PEOPLE, YOU

04:20:48.682 --> 04:20:53.009
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THIS 
NATION. YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE 

04:20:53.194 --> 04:20:58.847
THAT TORE DOWN OUR NATION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS IT POSSIBLE LISTENING TO 

04:20:59.610 --> 04:21:03.451
THOSE WORDS IN THE PROPER 
CADENCE, WITHOUT THEM BEING 

04:21:03.638 --> 04:21:06.699
EDITED OR THE SOUND CHANGED

04:21:13.062 --> 04:21:15.294
SO THAT THEY ARE INDISPENSABLE 
OR SOUNDS AS THOUGH THE CROWD IS

04:21:15.495 --> 04:21:17.934
RIGHT THERE, BUT LISTENING TO IT
AS YOU HAVE HERE AN EDITED US, 

04:21:18.156 --> 04:21:20.779
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S DISDAIN FOR POLITICAL 

04:21:20.979 --> 04:21:26.216
VIOLENCE COULD BE ANY CLEARER TO
THE PERSONS LISTENING AS HE WAS 

04:21:26.401 --> 04:21:28.401
SPEAKING?

04:21:30.926 --> 04:21:33.574
IS IT POSSIBLE HIS WORDS COULD 
HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD. I 

04:21:33.861 --> 04:21:40.476
SUGGEST TO YOU THAT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE. NOW 

04:21:41.492 --> 04:21:45.287
MANAGERS SAID THE PRESIDENT TOLD
THE CROWD

04:21:48.403 --> 04:21:50.957
, QUOTE, YOU HAVE TO GET OUT 
YOUR PEOPLE TO FIGHT

04:21:55.516 --> 04:21:57.787
. THE HOUSE MANAGERS CLAIM IS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:21:57.972 --> 04:22:00.536
STATES WAS TELLING THE AUDIENCE 
TO GET EACH OTHER TO PHYSICALLY 

04:22:00.759 --> 04:22:03.380
FIGHT.

04:22:07.899 --> 04:22:09.934
THAT IS NOT WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
SAID. THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD 

04:22:10.135 --> 04:22:14.602
FIGHT, HE SAID, WHEN MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS. IF THEY DON'T FIGHT, 

04:22:14.801 --> 04:22:20.206
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID, IS WHAT
SHOULD THE RALLY ATTENDEES DO?

04:22:22.938 --> 04:22:28.096
IF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WOULDN'T 
FIGHT FOR THE PRINCIPLES THEY 

04:22:28.333 --> 04:22:34.513
HELD DEAR, WHAT WAS IT THE 
PRESIDENT SPECIFICALLY TOLD HIS 

04:22:34.713 --> 04:22:38.833
SUPPORTERS AT THAT RALLY HE 
WANTED THEM TO DO? HE WANTED 

04:22:39.017 --> 04:22:45.078
THEM TO SUPPORT PRIMARY 
CHALLENGES. NOW, NOBODY IN THIS 

04:22:45.838 --> 04:22:50.762
CHAMBER IS ANXIOUS TO HAVE A 
PRIMARY CHALLENGE. THAT IS ONE 

04:22:51.163 --> 04:22:55.626
TRUISM I THINK I CAN SAY WITH 
SOME CERTAINTY. THAT IS THE WAY 

04:22:55.840 --> 04:22:59.519
WE OPERATE IN THIS COUNTRY. THE 
PEOPLE OF A STATE WANT TO CHANGE

04:23:01.270 --> 04:23:07.168
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR 
SENATORS, THEY USE THE ELECTORAL

04:23:07.358 --> 04:23:10.263
PROCESS. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD 
HIS LISTENERS

04:23:14.320 --> 04:23:16.354
THAT IF THEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
WON'T FIGHT FOR THEIR VIEWS, 

04:23:16.554 --> 04:23:21.837
THEN GO BACK HOME AND FIND 
OTHERS THAT WILL. THAT IS WHAT 

04:23:22.038 --> 04:23:25.287
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SAID. THE 
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD FIGHT FOR THE 

04:23:25.491 --> 04:23:27.877
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

04:23:32.599 --> 04:23:34.599
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PEOPLE TO 
FIGHT.

04:23:38.897 --> 04:23:40.897
HE TOLD THEM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PEOPLE 

04:23:40.931 --> 04:23:43.400
TO FIGHT. IF THEY DON'T FIGHT, 
WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY THE OUT OF 

04:23:43.586 --> 04:23:47.829
THE ONES THAT DON'T FIGHT. YOU 
PRIMARY THEM. WE ARE GOING TO 

04:23:48.031 --> 04:23:50.479
LET YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE, I CAN
ALREADY TELL YOU, FRANKLY. 

04:23:50.480 --> 04:23:57.617
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS PRETTY STARK CONTRAST 
WHEN YOU WATCH THAT VIDEO, ISN'T

04:23:57.805 --> 04:24:04.352
IT? WHEN YOU SEE THE HOUSE 
MANAGER TELL YOU, AND I DON'T 

04:24:05.033 --> 04:24:07.033
KNOW IF

04:24:10.582 --> 04:24:13.310
WE ARE UNDER OATH HERE BUT WHEN 
I WALKED INTO THIS ONE, I SURE 

04:24:13.495 --> 04:24:15.862
FELT LIKE I WAS UNDER OATH AND I
WAS SPEAKING NOT ONLY TO 

04:24:16.063 --> 04:24:18.095
SENATORS OF THE UNITED STATES 
BUT BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD AND 

04:24:18.296 --> 04:24:20.296
WITH GOD WATCHING.

04:24:24.997 --> 04:24:27.230
THE HOUSE MANAGER GOT UP HERE 
AND TOLD YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT 

04:24:27.443 --> 04:24:29.677
OF THE UNITED STATES ON JANUARY 
THE SIXTH, 2021 TOLD THE CROWD 

04:24:29.877 --> 04:24:34.142
THAT THEY HAD TO GO AND FIGHT 
AND THE IMPLICATION THAT THEY 

04:24:34.343 --> 04:24:37.193
WANTED TO DO IT FROM WAS THAT HE
WAS SENDING THEM DOWN TO CAPITOL

04:24:37.391 --> 04:24:41.254
HILL TO GO AND PREACH THE 
BUILDING AND TRASH THE VERY 

04:24:41.455 --> 04:24:48.156
SACRED HALLS OF CONGRESS. WE NOW
KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT AT ALL 

04:24:48.917 --> 04:24:53.595
ANYTHING NEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT
SAID. WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 

04:24:53.781 --> 04:24:55.781
WAS

04:24:56.888 --> 04:24:59.735
, IF YOU CAN'T GET THE NUMBERS 
OF CONGRESS TO DO AS YOU WOULD 

04:24:59.936 --> 04:25:04.401
LIKE HIM TO DO, YOU PRIMARY 
THEM. THAT IS THE AMERICAN WAY. 

04:25:04.614 --> 04:25:10.045
THE FIRST WAY THE HOUSE MANAGERS
PRESENTED AND WANTED YOU TO 

04:25:10.230 --> 04:25:12.230
CONCLUDE

04:25:13.751 --> 04:25:16.184
, THAT IS IT THE CRIMINAL WAY. 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WAS THE 

04:25:16.949 --> 04:25:18.949
AMERICAN WAY.

04:25:23.105 --> 04:25:29.637
AGAIN, THE HOUSE MEMBERS RELATED
RESIDENT TRUMPS WORDS. I CAN'T 

04:25:29.831 --> 04:25:35.682
STAND HERE AND PRETEND TO TELL 
YOU THAT I KNOW EVERY TIME FROM 

04:25:35.896 --> 04:25:38.533
ALL THOSE VIDEOS THAT THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS AND A BELATED WHAT THE 

04:25:39.291 --> 04:25:43.408
PRESIDENT SAID, PUT UP EVIDENCE 
THAT WAS

04:25:49.702 --> 04:25:51.894
NOT WITH THE FOUNDATION OF 
CORRECTNESS AND ADMISSIBILITY WE

04:25:52.089 --> 04:25:54.932
EXPECT. I CAN'T TELL YOU I 
PICKED UP EVERYONE. I DON'T 

04:25:55.118 --> 04:26:00.878
THINK MR. VAN DER VEEN OR MR. 
SCHOEN OR ANY OF THE OTHERS THAT

04:26:01.079 --> 04:26:04.933
WORK WITH US  CAN TELL YOU THAT.
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT 

04:26:05.146 --> 04:26:07.981
THERE WERE AN AWFUL LOT OF 
TIMES. I KNOW AT LEAST SOME OF 

04:26:08.182 --> 04:26:13.461
YOU WERE JUDGES IN PREVIOUS 
LIVES. IF ONE OF THE LAWYERS WAS

04:26:13.676 --> 04:26:19.512
ABLE TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION 
THAT ONE SIDE INTENTIONALLY 

04:26:19.697 --> 04:26:25.245
PRESENTED FALSE OR MISLEADING 
EVIDENCE, THAT JUDGE WOULD GIVE 

04:26:25.448 --> 04:26:27.448
AN INSTRUCTION CALLED

04:26:30.529 --> 04:26:38.446
FALLS IN ONE THING, FALSE IN 
EVERYTHING. IN OTHER WORDS, IF 

04:26:38.659 --> 04:26:44.140
THEY ARE TRYING TO FOOL YOU 
ABOUT ONE THING, NOT ONLY MIGHT 

04:26:44.340 --> 04:26:47.122
THEY BE TRYING TO FOOL YOU AND 
SOMETHING ELSE BUT AFTER THAT

04:26:50.643 --> 04:26:52.872
MAXIM OF THE LAW, YOU MAY 
CONCLUDE THEY ARE TRYING TO FOOL

04:26:53.073 --> 04:26:55.073
YOU IN EVERYTHING ELSE.

04:27:04.038 --> 04:27:06.071
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IMMEDIATE IN
HIS CALLS CALM AND RESPECT FOR 

04:27:06.272 --> 04:27:08.255
LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS EMPHASIZED PRESIDENT 

04:27:08.256 --> 04:27:13.186
TRUMP'S TWEET IN THE 6:00 P.M. 
HOUR, WHERE HE TOLD CROWDS TO 

04:27:13.385 --> 04:27:20.287
QUOTE GO HOME IN LOVE AND PEACE 
AND REMEMBER THIS DAY. WHAT IS 

04:27:20.502 --> 04:27:29.431
IT THAT THEY LEFT OUT? WELL, THE
HOUSE STARTS THERE RECITATION OF

04:27:29.631 --> 04:27:35.190
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SAID AS 
FAR AS THE AFTERMATH OF WHEN THE

04:27:35.392 --> 04:27:40.347
CAPITOL WAS BREACHED AT ROUGHLY 
6:00 P.M. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL 

04:27:40.536 --> 04:27:42.536
YOU

04:27:44.876 --> 04:27:47.136
, AND DIDN'T TELL YOU, AND WHICH
YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE 

04:27:47.322 --> 04:27:50.314
I THINK I AM THE FIRST ONE TO 
SAY IT IN THIS FORM

04:27:53.812 --> 04:27:56.062
, IS THAT 2:38, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
URGED PROTESTERS AT THE U.S. 

04:27:56.808 --> 04:27:59.897
CAPITOL TO, "STAY PEACEFUL, 
PLEASE SUPPORT OUR CAPITOL 

04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:03.334
POLICE, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY ARE TRULY ON THE SIDE OF 

04:28:03.520 --> 04:28:05.520
OUR COUNTRY. STAY PEACEFUL.

04:28:08.632 --> 04:28:11.081
" BEFORE WE ON THE GRAPHIC, I 
WANT TO POINT OUT THE PRESIDENT 

04:28:11.276 --> 04:28:15.944
TRUMP'S SPEECH ENDED AT 1:11 
P.M. AT 2:38 P.M., BY THE TIME 

04:28:16.350 --> 04:28:18.522
WOULD REDUCE THE PRESIDENT THAT 
THERE IS PROBABLY YOUR

04:28:22.644 --> 04:28:25.611
, HE IS URGING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT
THE POLICE, THE PEACEFUL.

04:30:39.892 --> 04:30:41.927
12:49 P.M., THE FIRST BARRIERS 
AT THE US CAPITOL GROUNDS WERE 

04:30:42.128 --> 04:30:45.236
PUSHED OVER AND THE CROWD ENTER 
THE RESTRICTED AREA. AT 11:05 

04:30:45.452 --> 04:30:49.159
P.M., ACTING TO FIT DEFENSE 
SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER MILLER 

04:30:49.375 --> 04:30:53.082
RECEIVED OPEN-SOURCE REPORTS OF 
DEMONSTRATOR MOVEMENTS TO THE 

04:30:53.285 --> 04:30:55.419
U.S. CAPITAL. AT 1:09 P.M., U.S.
CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF

04:31:01.039 --> 04:31:03.039
CALLED THE HOUSE AND SENATE 
SERGEANT AT ARMS, TELLING THEM 

04:31:03.135 --> 04:31:06.166
HE WANTED AN EMERGENCY DECLARED,
AND HE WANTED THE NATIONAL GUARD

04:31:06.308 --> 04:31:08.308
CALLED

04:31:11.177 --> 04:31:13.721
.  THE POINT, GIVEN THE TIMELINE
OF EVENTS, THE CRIMINALS AT THE 

04:31:14.482 --> 04:31:17.461
CAPITOL  WEREN'T THERE AT THE 
ELLIPSE TO EVEN HEAR THE 

04:31:18.225 --> 04:31:21.779
PRESIDENT'S WORDS. THEY WERE 
MORE THAN A MILE AWAY ENGAGED IN

04:31:21.980 --> 04:31:25.374
THEIR PREPLANNED ASSAULT ON THIS
VERY BUILDING. THIS WAS A

04:31:28.978 --> 04:31:30.978
PREPLANNED ASSAULT, MAKE NO 
MISTAKE, AND THAT IS A CRITICAL 

04:31:31.012 --> 04:31:35.359
FACT. WATCH THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOES ANYONE IN THIS CHAMBER 

04:31:35.574 --> 04:31:39.778
HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT BUT FOR 
THE CONDUCT OF THE PRESIDENT

04:31:48.701 --> 04:31:50.701
TRUMP, THAT THE CHARGE OF THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT, THAT 

04:31:50.762 --> 04:31:52.762
THAT ATTACK IN THE CAPITOL WOULD
HAVE OCCURRED? DOES ANYBODY 

04:31:52.811 --> 04:31:54.860
BELIEVE THAT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  IF IT WAS NOT SOME SORT OF 

04:31:55.063 --> 04:31:57.063
SPONTANEOUS DECISION BY

04:32:02.656 --> 04:32:04.711
PROTESTERS TO GO UP TO CAPITOL 
HILL AND STORM CAPITOL HILL, 

04:32:04.913 --> 04:32:07.180
THIS WAS ALL PLANNED OUT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW MUCH OF IT WAS PLANNED? 

04:32:07.380 --> 04:32:09.250
HOW MUCH OF THIS WAS STRATEGIZED
AHEAD OF TIME? 

04:32:09.251 --> 04:32:11.286
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY ARE GETTING SOME 
INDICATION THAT INDICATES THAT 

04:32:11.486 --> 04:32:12.724
THERE WAS SOME LEVEL OF 
PLANNING. 

04:32:12.725 --> 04:32:17.036
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE APPEARS TO BE 
PREMEDITATION. 

04:32:17.037 --> 04:32:19.037
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FBI ISSUED A WARNING OF A

04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:36.550
WAR AT THE CAPITOL PERIOD THE 
FBI WARNED LAW ENFORCEMENT 

04:32:36.587 --> 04:32:37.611
AGENCIES ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC 
ATTACK. 

04:32:37.612 --> 04:32:39.703
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BE READY TO FIGHT. CONGRESS 
NEEDS TO HEAR GLASS BREAKING, 

04:32:39.903 --> 04:32:41.799
DOORS BEING KICKED IN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE DEVELOP SOME INTELLIGENCE 

04:32:41.800 --> 04:32:43.854
THAT A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS 
WERE PLANNING TO TRAVEL TO THE 

04:32:44.056 --> 04:32:46.128
D.C. AREA  WITH INTENTIONS TO 
CAUSE VIOLENCE. WE SHARED THAT 

04:32:46.331 --> 04:32:47.846
INFORMATION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS IMMEDIATELY 

04:32:47.847 --> 04:32:52.056
DISSEMINATED AND BRIEFED TO OUR 
COMMAND POST OPERATIONS TO ALL 

04:32:52.271 --> 04:32:54.271
LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FBI SAYS TO BOMBS 

04:32:54.329 --> 04:32:56.329
DISCOVERED NEAR THE CAPITOL 

04:33:01.142 --> 04:33:02.378
WERE PLACED THERE THE NIGHT 
BEFORE. 

04:33:02.379 --> 04:33:04.455
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NEW VIDEO APPEARS TO SHOW A 
PERSON SUSPECTED OF PLANTING 

04:33:04.656 --> 04:33:06.656
PIPE BOMBS NEAR THE U.S. CAPITOL

04:33:19.203 --> 04:33:21.203
THE NIGHT BEFORE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FBI SAID THE BOMBS WERE 

04:33:21.255 --> 04:33:23.512
PLANTED THE NIGHT BEFORE THE C'S
BETWEEN 7:30 AND 8:30 P.M. 

04:33:23.513 --> 04:33:24.966
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY WERE PLANTED THE DAY 
BEFORE. 

04:33:24.967 --> 04:33:26.819
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS ALL GOES TO THE IDEA OF 
PREMEDITATION. 

04:33:26.820 --> 04:33:29.276
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS WAS A PLANNED ASSAULT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF

04:33:29.490 --> 04:33:31.490
THE HOUSE MANAGER, DOES ANYBODY 
BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HAVE 

04:33:31.549 --> 04:33:34.088
OCCURRED BUT FOR THE SPEECH FROM
DONALD TRUMP, I DO.

04:33:40.759 --> 04:33:42.759
ALL OF THESE FACTS MAKE CLEAR

04:33:48.202 --> 04:33:50.254
THE JANUARY 6 SPEECH DID NOT 
CAUSE OF THE RIOTS, THE 

04:33:50.471 --> 04:33:52.471
PRESIDENT DID NOT CAUSE THE 
RIOTS, HE NEITHER

04:34:05.055 --> 04:34:06.686
EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY 
ENCOURAGED THE USE OF VIOLENCE 

04:34:06.687 --> 04:34:08.733
OR LAWLESS ACTION BUT IN FACT, 
CALLED FOR PEACEFUL EXERCISE OF 

04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:10.563
EVERY AMERICAN'S FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHTS TO PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE 

04:34:10.564 --> 04:34:12.417
AND PETITION THEIR GOVERNMENT 
FOR ADDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. IN 

04:34:12.418 --> 04:34:14.418
OTHER WORDS, THE BRANDENBURG 
STANDARD DOES NOT MEET UP. THE 

04:34:14.462 --> 04:34:16.462
HOUSE MANAGERS ADMITTED MANY 
FACTS ARE UNKNOWN

04:34:22.618 --> 04:34:24.665
EVEN SPEAKER PELOSI ADMITTED NOT
KNOWING THE REAL CAUSE OF THE 

04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:26.933
VIOLENCE WHEN SHE CALLED FOR A 
9/11 STYLE COMMISSION TO EXAMINE

04:34:27.138 --> 04:34:29.291
THE FACTS AND CAUSES THAT LED TO
THE VIOLENCE.

04:34:40.933 --> 04:34:43.360
ON THE SCREEN IS SPEAKER 
PELOSI'S CALL FOR THE 9/11 

04:34:43.505 --> 04:34:45.505
COMMISSION

04:34:50.750 --> 04:34:52.750
.

04:34:57.533 --> 04:35:00.414
LET'S TOUCH NOW ON THE SECOND 
ABSURD AND CONFLATED ALLEGATION 

04:35:00.834 --> 04:35:04.944
IN THE HOUSE MANAGER SINGLE 
ARTICLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PHONE

04:35:05.147 --> 04:35:09.479
CALL TO GEORGIA SECRETARY OF 
STATE BEN ROETHLISBERGER 

04:35:09.909 --> 04:35:13.828
SURREPTITIOUSLY RECORDED BY THE 
WAY, INCLUDED MULTIPLE ATTORNEYS

04:35:14.588 --> 04:35:21.073
AND OTHERS ON THE CALL. LET ME 
POINT OUT THE VERY OBVIOUS FACT 

04:35:21.288 --> 04:35:24.151
THAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS IGNORED.
THE PRIVATE CALL THAT WAS MADE 

04:35:24.368 --> 04:35:27.565
PUBLIC BY OTHERS CANNOT REALLY 
BE THE BASIS TO CLAIM THAT THE 

04:35:27.723 --> 04:35:29.723
PRESIDENT

04:35:32.749 --> 04:35:34.749
INTENDED TO INCITE A RIOT, 
BECAUSE HE DID NOT PUBLICLY 

04:35:34.775 --> 04:35:39.326
DISCLOSE THE CONTENTS OF THE 
CALL. HOW COULD HE HAVE HOPED TO

04:35:39.526 --> 04:35:41.526
USE THIS CALL

04:35:46.516 --> 04:35:48.780
TO INVITE HIS FOLLOWERS, IF HE 
HAD NO INTENT TO MAKE THE 

04:35:48.983 --> 04:35:51.041
CONVERSATION PUBLIC AND INDEED, 
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT INC. 

04:35:51.795 --> 04:35:55.641
SECRETLY RECORDED? THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS TOLD YOU THAT THE 

04:35:55.857 --> 04:35:58.725
PRESIDENT DEMANDED THAT THE 
GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE FIND 

04:35:58.928 --> 04:36:03.452
JUST OVER 11,000 VOTES. THE WORD
FINE, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS THE 

04:36:03.653 --> 04:36:07.617
HOUSE MANAGERS HIGHLIGHTED WAS 
TAKEN COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT

04:36:11.435 --> 04:36:14.168
. AND THE WORD FIND DID NOT COME
OUT OF THIN AIR

04:36:21.490 --> 04:36:23.490
. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF 
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VOTER DATA 

04:36:23.562 --> 04:36:25.562
THAT THE BALLOT REJECTION RATE 
IN GEORGIA IN 2016 WAS 

04:36:25.612 --> 04:36:27.612
APPROXIMATELY 6.42% AND EVEN 
THOUGH

04:36:32.403 --> 04:36:34.061
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
FIRST-TIME MAIL-IN BALLOTS WERE 

04:36:34.062 --> 04:36:36.610
INCLUDED IN THE 2020 COUNT, THE 
GEORGIA REJECTION RATE IN 2020

04:36:42.419 --> 04:36:45.346
WAS A MERE 4/10 OF 1%, A DROP 
OFF FROM 6.42% TO .4%.

04:36:55.309 --> 04:36:57.152
PRESIDENT TRUMP ONE OF THE 
SIGNATURE VERIFICATION TO BE 

04:36:57.153 --> 04:36:59.045
DONE IN PUBLIC. HOW CAN A 
REQUEST FOR SIGNATURE 

04:36:59.046 --> 04:37:01.274
VERIFICATIONS TO BE DONE IN 
PUBLIC, BE A BASIS FOR A CHARGE 

04:37:01.475 --> 04:37:03.475
FOR INCITING A RIDE?

04:37:06.974 --> 04:37:08.824
WITH THAT BACKGROUND, IT IS 
CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

04:37:08.825 --> 04:37:11.069
COMMENTS AND THE USE OF THE 
WORD, FIND, OR SOLELY RELATED TO

04:37:11.283 --> 04:37:14.987
HIS CONCERNS WITH THE 
INEXPLICABLE DRAMATIC DROP IN 

04:37:15.201 --> 04:37:17.201
GEORGIA'S BALLOT REJECTION RATE

04:37:22.625 --> 04:37:25.230
. LET'S EXAMINE HOW THE WORD, 
FIND, WAS USED THROUGHOUT THAT 

04:37:25.400 --> 04:37:30.011
CONVERSATION. MR. TRUMP'S FIRST 
USE OF THE WORD FINE WAS AS 

04:37:30.772 --> 04:37:32.772
FOLLOWS, QUOTE,

04:37:35.978 --> 04:37:38.437
WE THINK THAT IF YOU CHECK THE 
SIGNATURES, A REAL CHECK OF THE 

04:37:38.639 --> 04:37:40.885
SIGNATURES, GOING BACK IN FULTON
COUNTY, YOU WILL FIND AT LEAST A

04:37:41.086 --> 04:37:43.978
COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND FORGED 
SIGNATURES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

04:37:44.737 --> 04:37:46.737
BEEN FORGED

04:37:48.268 --> 04:37:51.400
. AND WE ARE QUITE SURE THAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN.

04:37:55.095 --> 04:37:57.095
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO USED FIND, 
AS FOLLOWS,

04:38:01.018 --> 04:38:03.074
NOW, WHY AREN'T WE DOING 
SIGNATURE AND WHY CAN'T IT BE 

04:38:03.278 --> 04:38:05.278
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

04:38:08.005 --> 04:38:10.060
? AND WHY CAN'T WE HAVE 
PROFESSIONALS DO IT INSTEAD OF 

04:38:10.258 --> 04:38:12.353
RANK AMATEURS WHO WILL NEVER 
FIND ANYTHING AND DON'T WANT TO 

04:38:13.110 --> 04:38:16.898
FIND ANYTHING? THEY DON'T WANT 
TO FIND, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T 

04:38:17.114 --> 04:38:21.137
WANT TO FIND ANYTHING. SOMEDAY, 
YOU WILL TELL ME THE REASON WHY

04:38:24.498 --> 04:38:26.341
. BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
YOUR REASONING. BUT SOMEDAY, 

04:38:26.342 --> 04:38:29.526
YOU'LL TELL ME THE REASON WHY 
BUT WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO FIND

04:38:32.706 --> 04:38:37.235
? PRESIDENT TRUMP ECHOED HIS 
PREVIOUS SENTIMENTS IN THE 

04:38:37.435 --> 04:38:39.435
CONTEXT OF PURSUING

04:38:43.799 --> 04:38:45.466
A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION AND 
THE LACK OF SIGNATURE 

04:38:45.467 --> 04:38:47.467
VERIFICATION FOR MAIL AND AN 
ABSENTEE BALLOTS.

04:38:52.992 --> 04:38:54.992
AND WHY CAN'T WE HAVE 
PROFESSIONALS DO IT INSTEAD OF 

04:38:55.100 --> 04:38:57.135
RANK AMATEURS WHO WILL NEVER 
FIND ANYTHING AND DON'T WANT TO 

04:38:57.339 --> 04:38:59.400
FIND ANYTHING. THEY DON'T WANT 
TO FIND ANYTHING YOU KNOW, THEY 

04:38:59.618 --> 04:39:01.618
DON'T WANT TO FIND ANYTHING

04:39:06.763 --> 04:39:09.214
. THEY DON'T WANT TO FIND, YOU 
KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO FIND 

04:39:09.416 --> 04:39:13.512
ANYTHING, SOMEDAY YOU'LL TELL ME
WHY BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND 

04:39:13.712 --> 04:39:16.015
YOUR REASONING BUT SOMEDAY YOU 
WILL TELL ME WHY. WHY DON'T YOU 

04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:19.325
WANT TO FIND, WE CAN GO THROUGH 
SIGNATURE VERIFICATION AND WE 

04:39:19.527 --> 04:39:22.617
WILL FIND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF SIGNATURES AND YOU CAN LET US

04:39:22.822 --> 04:39:26.553
DO IT, AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN 
DO THAT, AS YOU KNOW, IS TO GO 

04:39:26.755 --> 04:39:32.086
TO THE PAST, BUT YOU DIDN'T DO 
THAT IN COBB COUNTY, YOU JUST 

04:39:32.289 --> 04:39:34.289
LOOKED AT ONE PAGE COMPARED

04:39:37.007 --> 04:39:39.096
TO ANOTHER, THE ONLY WAY THAT 
YOU CAN DO A SIGNATURE 

04:39:39.300 --> 04:39:41.300
VERIFICATION IS TO GO FROM ONE 
THAT'S SIGNED ON NOVEMBER 

04:39:41.745 --> 04:39:46.208
WHATEVER, RECENTLY, AND COMPARE 
IT TO TWO YEARS AGO FOUR YEARS 

04:39:46.347 --> 04:39:49.643
AGO, SIX YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW, OR
EVEN

04:39:54.514 --> 04:39:56.775
ONE. AND YOU WILL FIND YOU HAVE 
MANY DIFFERENT SIGNATURES BUT IN

04:39:56.977 --> 04:39:58.977
FULTON, WHERE THEY DUMPED 
BALLOTS, YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU 

04:39:59.040 --> 04:40:02.295
HAVE MANY THAT AREN'T EVEN 
SIGNED, AND YOU WILL HAVE MANY 

04:40:02.435 --> 04:40:04.435
FORGERIES.

04:40:07.892 --> 04:40:10.270
MR. TRUMP CONTINUE TO USE THE 
WORD FINE THROUGHOUT THE 

04:40:10.417 --> 04:40:13.986
CONVERSATION, EACH AND EVERY 
TIME IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS 

04:40:14.201 --> 04:40:19.301
REQUEST, THAT MR. BRAD 
RAFFENSPERGER REVIEW  SIGNATURE 

04:40:19.503 --> 04:40:21.503
VERIFICATIONS AND HIS CONCERNS

04:40:25.853 --> 04:40:27.709
GENERALLY WITH BALLOT INTEGRITY 
AND HIS REPORT OF ELECTORAL 

04:40:27.710 --> 04:40:33.057
DEFICIT, HERE ARE A FEW 
EXAMPLES. BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU 

04:40:33.257 --> 04:40:37.978
WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER, 
BRAD, INSTEAD OF KEEP SAYING 

04:40:38.178 --> 04:40:42.411
THAT THE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT, 
BECAUSE THOSE NUMBERS ARE SO 

04:40:42.561 --> 04:40:44.982
WRONG IN ANOTHER EXAMPLE

04:40:52.306 --> 04:40:55.007
. WE THINK THAT IF YOU CHECK THE
SIGNATURES, A REAL CHECK OF THE 

04:40:55.208 --> 04:40:57.447
SIGNATURES, GOING BACK IN FULTON
COUNTY, YOU WILL FIND AT LEAST A

04:40:57.663 --> 04:40:59.695
COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF 
FORGED SIGNATURES OF PEOPLE WHO 

04:40:59.897 --> 04:41:03.547
HAVE BEEN FORGED AND WE ARE 
QUITE SURE THAT'S GOING TO 

04:41:03.691 --> 04:41:05.691
HAPPEN

04:41:09.908 --> 04:41:14.029
. MOREOVER, THERE WAS NOTHING 
UNTOWARD WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP OR

04:41:14.229 --> 04:41:18.932
ANY OTHER CANDIDATE FOR THAT 
MATTER, SPEAKING WITH THE LEAD 

04:41:19.133 --> 04:41:21.133
ELECTIONS OFFICER OF A STATE, 
THAT'S WHY THE GEORGIA SECRETARY

04:41:21.181 --> 04:41:24.329
OF STATE TOOK A CALL ALONG WITH 
MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM

04:41:32.202 --> 04:41:34.861
, ONE OF WHOM DECIDED TO RECORD 
AND RELEASE IT TO THE PRESS. THE

04:41:35.062 --> 04:41:37.062
ONLY REASON THIS CONVERSATION IS
BEING DISCUSSED IN THIS CHAMBER 

04:41:37.113 --> 04:41:39.113
IS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THE MEDIA 
AND THEIR DEMOCRATIC ALLIES 

04:41:39.201 --> 04:41:41.586
DISTORTED THE TRUE CONVERSATION 
TO MISLEAD YOU AND THE AMERICAN 

04:41:41.737 --> 04:41:50.741
PUBLIC. SO, WE HAVE A COMPLETE 
LACK OF EVIDENCE

04:41:53.512 --> 04:41:56.799
FOR THE ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT 
PRESENTED BY THE HOUSE MANAGERS.

04:41:57.016 --> 04:41:59.404
SO WHY ARE WE HERE? POLITICS.

04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:06.796
THEIR GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE A 
POLITICAL OPPONENT. TO 

04:42:07.011 --> 04:42:10.802
SUBSTITUTE THEIR JUDGMENT FOR 
THE WILL OF THE VOTERS.

04:42:17.112 --> 04:42:19.395
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHY BOTHER WITH A SENATE 
TRIAL OF DONALD TRUMP, HE'S NO 

04:42:19.611 --> 04:42:22.604
LONGER PRESIDENT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE WILL 

04:42:22.605 --> 04:42:24.605
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:42:30.641 --> 04:42:32.943
DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN. 

04:42:32.944 --> 04:42:34.186
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING 
FROM OFFICE. 

04:42:34.187 --> 04:42:36.043
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DISQUALIFY HIM FROM EVER 
RUNNING FOR OFFICE AGAIN. 

04:42:36.044 --> 04:42:38.044
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S ABOUT

04:42:42.408 --> 04:42:43.831
FOCUSING THAT HE CAN NEVER RUN 
AWAY. 

04:42:43.832 --> 04:42:45.694
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REMOVE HIM FROM EVER RUNNING 
FOR OFFICE AGAIN. 

04:42:45.695 --> 04:42:51.059
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE BAN OF FORMER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP FROM RUNNING AGAIN. 

04:42:51.060 --> 04:42:53.646
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE DON'T IMPEACH THIS 
PRESIDENT HE WILL GET REELECTED.

04:42:59.894 --> 04:43:02.305
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE A 
POLITICAL OPPONENT, TO 

04:43:02.489 --> 04:43:06.468
SUBSTITUTE THEIR JUDGMENT FOR 
THE WILL OF THE VOTERS MEMBERS 

04:43:06.671 --> 04:43:13.869
OF THE SENATE, OUR COUNTRY NEEDS
TO GET BACK TO WORK. I KNOW THAT

04:43:14.069 --> 04:43:19.393
YOU KNOW THAT. AND INSTEAD, WE 
ARE HERE, THE MAJORITY PARTY 

04:43:19.612 --> 04:43:25.968
PROMISED TO UNIFY AND DELIVER 
MORE COVID RELIEF. BUT INSTEAD, 

04:43:26.172 --> 04:43:32.854
THEY DID THIS. WE WILL NOT TAKE 
MOST OF OUR TIME TODAY

04:43:39.506 --> 04:43:41.978
, US, OF THE DEFENSE, IN THE 
HOPES THAT YOU WILL TAKE BACK 

04:43:42.178 --> 04:43:47.905
THESE HOURS, AND USE THEM TO GET
DELIVERY OF COVID RELIEF TO THE 

04:43:48.665 --> 04:43:54.859
AMERICAN PEOPLE. LET US BE CLEAR
, THIS TRIAL IS ABOUT FAR MORE 

04:43:55.279 --> 04:43:57.279
THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP

04:43:59.373 --> 04:44:02.843
. IT IS ABOUT SILENCING AND 
BANNING THE SPEECH THE MAJORITY 

04:44:03.047 --> 04:44:09.321
DOES NOT AGREE WITH. IT IS ABOUT
CANCELING 75 MILLION TRUMP 

04:44:09.462 --> 04:44:15.174
VOTERS, AND CRIMINALIZING 
POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS

04:44:18.375 --> 04:44:25.930
WHAT THIS TRIAL IS REALLY ABOUT.
IT'S THE ONLY EXISTENTIAL ISSUE 

04:44:26.693 --> 04:44:28.693
BEFORE US

04:44:31.611 --> 04:44:39.424
. AND ASKS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL 
COUNSEL CULTURE TO TAKE OVER IN 

04:44:39.641 --> 04:44:43.240
THE UNITED STATES SENATE. ARE WE
GOING TO ALLOW

04:44:47.403 --> 04:44:49.403
CANCELING AND BANNING AND 
SILENCING TO BE SANCTIONED IN 

04:44:49.817 --> 04:44:51.817
THIS BODY?

04:44:53.768 --> 04:44:56.251
TO THE DEMOCRATS WHO VIEW THIS 
AS A MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY, I 

04:44:56.465 --> 04:45:01.594
URGE YOU INSTEAD TO LOOK TO THE 
PRINCIPLES OF FREE EXPRESSION 

04:45:01.809 --> 04:45:04.980
AND FREE SPEECH. I HOPE

04:45:08.784 --> 04:45:11.244
, TRULY, THAT THE NEXT TIME YOU 
ARE IN THE MINORITY, THAT YOU 

04:45:11.448 --> 04:45:16.809
DON'T FIND YOURSELF IN THIS 
POSITION. TO REPUBLICANS IN THIS

04:45:17.024 --> 04:45:22.274
CHAMBER, I ASK, WHEN YOU ARE 
NEXT TO THE MAJORITY, PLEASE 

04:45:22.415 --> 04:45:25.701
RESIST WHAT WILL BE AN 
OVERWHELMING TEMPTATION

04:45:30.502 --> 04:45:34.494
TO DO THIS VERY SAME THING TO 
THE OPPOSING PARTY

04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:48.710
. MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, THIS 
CONCLUDES THE FORMAL DEFENSE OF 

04:45:48.925 --> 04:45:51.191
THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES TO THE IMPEACHMENT 

04:45:51.393 --> 04:45:55.700
ARTICLE FILED BY THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES. I UNDERSTAND 

04:45:55.916 --> 04:45:59.180
THAT THERE IS A PROCEDURE IN 
PLACE FOR QUESTIONS, AND WE 

04:45:59.943 --> 04:46:04.871
AWAIT THEM, THEREAFTER WE WILL 
CLOSE ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT 

04:46:05.010 --> 04:46:13.361
TRUMP. MR. PRESIDENT, WE YIELD 
THE BALANCE. 

04:46:13.362 --> 04:46:19.388
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT, WE 
TAKE A 15 MINUTE RECESS. 

04:46:19.389 --> 04:46:22.218
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE WILL STAY IN 
RECESS. 

04:46:22.219 --> 04:46:24.219
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:46:38.335 --> 04:46:40.188
OKAY, DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS 
HAVE WRAPPED UP THEIR OPENING 

04:46:40.189 --> 04:46:42.189
ARGUMENTS, THEY GILDED THE 
REMAINDER OF THEIR TIME

04:46:48.824 --> 04:46:51.281
AND SO NOW, LET'S GO TO JAMES 
HOLMAN, FOR MORE, WITH WHERE WE 

04:46:51.497 --> 04:46:53.779
ARE AT, SO JAMES, THEY COULD 
HAVE GONE FOR EIGHT HOURS TODAY 

04:46:53.984 --> 04:46:56.217
AND EIGHT HOURS TOMORROW, THEY 
HAVE ELECTED NOT TO DO THAT THEY

04:46:56.412 --> 04:46:58.656
SAY THEY ARE READY TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS. AND THAT MAY BE VERY 

04:46:58.859 --> 04:47:03.997
REVEALING AS TO WHERE SENATORS 
MINDS ARE AT BECAUSE, IN THAT 

04:47:04.198 --> 04:47:06.198
PROCESS, WHILE THEY CAN TRY TO 
AUTHENTICALLY GET AT SOME 

04:47:06.263 --> 04:47:08.532
ANSWERS, THE SENATORS CAN ALSO 
REVEAL WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS 

04:47:08.734 --> 04:47:10.981
ARE ON THEIR MIND. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IN SOME WAYS IS THE MOST

04:47:11.183 --> 04:47:16.091
INTERESTING PART BECAUSE REALLY,
YOU COULD READ THE BRIEFS FROM 

04:47:16.295 --> 04:47:18.558
BOTH SIDES TO KNOW THAT THEY 
WERE GOING TO ARGUE AND FRANKLY 

04:47:18.762 --> 04:47:21.051
WITH SOME VARIATION AND WE HAVE 
THE AUDIO VISUALS, WE SAW THE 

04:47:21.254 --> 04:47:25.163
ARGUMENTS LAST WEEK, THAT THE 
PATIENT MANAGERS AND THE DEFENSE

04:47:25.376 --> 04:47:27.734
WERE GOING TO MAKE, AND THEY 
PRETTY MUCH STUCK WITH

04:47:40.511 --> 04:47:42.738
THOSE. THIS HOWEVER IS THE FIRST
WINDOW INTO WHERE SOME OF THE 

04:47:42.941 --> 04:47:45.017
SENATORS ARE, WE'VE HAD SENATORS
COME TO THE MIKE'S, PULL REPORTS

04:47:45.215 --> 04:47:47.310
WHERE OUR REPORTERS WERE ABLE TO
APPROACH SOME OF THE SENATORS 

04:47:47.513 --> 04:47:49.958
BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE NOT HEARD 
FROM A BUNCH OF THEM, BUNCH OF 

04:47:50.160 --> 04:47:52.603
THE SENATORS WHO REALLY COULD BE
UP FOR GRABS HERE, WHO COULD BE 

04:47:52.804 --> 04:47:54.870
ON THE FENCE, ESPECIALLY AFTER 
THE LAST FOUR DAYS OF ARGUMENTS.

04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:57.535
THIS IS THEIR CHANCE, THIS MIGHT
BE THE FIRST TIME WE HEAR FROM 

04:47:57.752 --> 04:48:00.017
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE, AND WE 
MIGHT GET A SENSE OF WHETHER 

04:48:00.220 --> 04:48:03.282
THIS REALLY IS GOING TO BE THE 
MOST BIPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT 

04:48:03.487 --> 04:48:04.523
CONVICTION VOTE IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY. 

04:48:04.524 --> 04:48:06.775
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WE HEARD THIS AFTERNOON IN TERMS

04:48:06.975 --> 04:48:10.672
OF THE TRUMP DEFENSE. THEY HAVE 
LEFT A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

04:48:10.875 --> 04:48:12.875
UNANSWERED, QUESTIONS THAT WE 
KNOW THAT SOME REPUBLICANS NOT 

04:48:13.305 --> 04:48:15.305
JUST DEMOCRATS

04:48:17.832 --> 04:48:19.261
WANT RESOLVED. WHAT DID THEY 
FOCUS ON? 

04:48:19.262 --> 04:48:21.736
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT THEY DID FOCUS ON WAS 
SAYING THAT WHAT TRUMP DID WAS 

04:48:21.937 --> 04:48:24.013
FREE SPEECH, THE FIRST PART 
BEFORE WE TOOK THIS MOST RECENT 

04:48:24.214 --> 04:48:29.562
BREAK WAS TO FOCUS ON HOW 
POLITICIANS USE MARTIAL RHETORIC

04:48:29.765 --> 04:48:32.010
ALL THE TIME, USING WORDS LIKE 
FIGHT, WE SAW A LOT OF 

04:48:32.226 --> 04:48:35.747
COMPILATIONS, HIGHLIGHTING 
DEMOCRATS, SAYING YOU NEED TO 

04:48:36.153 --> 04:48:40.483
FIGHT, HIGHLIGHTING VIOLENCE AND
MOBS IN THE STREET DURING THE 

04:48:40.684 --> 04:48:46.026
SUMMER WHEN SOME OF THE PROTESTS
GOT OUT OF CONTROL. THEY SAID 

04:48:46.227 --> 04:48:49.810
THAT WHAT TRUMP SAID ON JANUARY 
6 WAS STANDARD FARE

04:48:56.471 --> 04:48:58.537
POLITICAL SPEECH THAT WAS EVEN 
PATRIOTIC, THAT HE WAS TRYING TO

04:48:58.738 --> 04:49:00.812
CALL FOR PEOPLE TO FIGHT TO 
CHANGE ELECTION LAWS IN THE 

04:49:01.573 --> 04:49:03.573
FUTURE AND TO PRIMARY 
REPUBLICANS WHO DIDN'T BACK HIM 

04:49:03.660 --> 04:49:05.912
UP ON TRYING TO OVERTURN THE 
ELECTION BUT THAT HE WAS NOT 

04:49:06.127 --> 04:49:08.275
DIRECTLY TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE 
TO GO ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY

04:49:13.278 --> 04:49:15.521
SIEGE THE CAPITOL, EVEN AS HE 
WAS POINTING AND SAYING, GO TO 

04:49:15.723 --> 04:49:17.346
THE CAPITOL, I'M GOING WITH YOU,
LET'S FIGHT. 

04:49:17.347 --> 04:49:21.445
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  RHONDA COLVIN, LIVE ON 
CAPITOL HILL. RHONDA, THE MOST 

04:49:21.645 --> 04:49:23.710
SALIENT POINTS THEY MADE, AND 
THAT ALSO RHONDA, WHAT HAVE THEY

04:49:23.925 --> 04:49:25.925
LEFT NOT DEALT WITH

04:49:32.371 --> 04:49:33.597
? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY SOMEWHAT ADDRESSED HIS 

04:49:33.598 --> 04:49:35.598
CONDUCT DURING THE INSURRECTION,
WHERE THEY SAID THAT THE PATIENT

04:49:35.639 --> 04:49:40.916
MANAGERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT 
HE DID NOT SUBMIT THAT VIDEOTAPE

04:49:41.129 --> 04:49:42.976
UNTIL ABOUT 4:00, HOURS AFTER 
THE INSURRECTION HAD ALREADY 

04:49:42.977 --> 04:49:44.977
BEEN UNDERWAY BUT HE SAID THAT 
THEY DID

04:49:52.676 --> 04:49:54.967
TWEET OUT AND SAY THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT IS ON OUR SIDE, BUT 

04:49:55.170 --> 04:49:57.170
WHAT IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 
REALLY ARGUING IS THERE WAS NO 

04:49:57.212 --> 04:49:59.275
EMPHATIC STOP NOW, DON'T DO 
THIS. THERE WAS NO ASSISTANCE IN

04:49:59.488 --> 04:50:01.580
SENDING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD, 
NOT THAT THE MANAGERS WERE ABLE 

04:50:01.785 --> 04:50:04.217
TO FIND, THAT HE WAS NOT A PART 
OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. SO FOR 

04:50:04.419 --> 04:50:06.477
SOMEBODY LIKE BILL CASSIDY, WHO 
SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE 

04:50:07.242 --> 04:50:10.574
REPUBLICANS WHO IS UP FOR GRABS,
REALLY, IN DETERMINING WHAT SIDE

04:50:10.776 --> 04:50:12.776
HE'S GOING TO VOTE ON,

04:50:15.889 --> 04:50:17.941
HE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT HE 
WANTED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT AN 

04:50:18.157 --> 04:50:21.879
EXPLANATION OF TRUMP'S CONDUCT, 
SO, TODAY, THEY DID KIND OF 

04:50:22.083 --> 04:50:24.174
ADDRESS THAT BUT THEY DIDN'T GO 
OVERBOARD WITH THAT. HOW THEY 

04:50:24.378 --> 04:50:28.054
DID ADDRESS IT ALSO WAS TALK 
ABOUT HOW HE IS THE MOST LAW AND

04:50:28.256 --> 04:50:30.256
ORDER PRESIDENT, THAT SOMETHING 
WE JUST HEARD MR. CASTOR TALKING

04:50:30.309 --> 04:50:32.309
ABOUT, PLAYING THAT REAL

04:50:36.020 --> 04:50:38.100
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING 
LAW AND ORDER OVER AND OVER 

04:50:38.314 --> 04:50:41.002
AGAIN, YOU SAW THAT REAL EARLIER
IN THE DAY, TOO, AND THAT IS ONE

04:50:41.205 --> 04:50:43.205
THING I THINK STOOD OUT, HE 
SAID,

04:50:55.500 --> 04:50:57.759
TRUMP IS THE MOST LAW AND ORDER 
PRESIDENT THAT WE'VE EVER HAD, 

04:50:57.959 --> 04:51:00.208
HE DID NOT AGREE WITH THIS, AND 
HIS REAL SUPPORTERS KNOW THAT. 

04:51:00.408 --> 04:51:02.657
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, THAT 
SEEMS TO BE DRAWING A LINE 

04:51:02.858 --> 04:51:05.086
BETWEEN THE PEOPLE WHO WERE 
HERE, WHO SAID THEY WERE HERE ON

04:51:05.301 --> 04:51:07.301
BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP, AND 
THESE REAL SUPPORTERS THAT HIS 

04:51:07.374 --> 04:51:09.629
DEFENSE TEAM ONCE THE WORLD TO 
KNOW ARE THE REAL PEOPLE WHO 

04:51:09.832 --> 04:51:11.475
SUPPORT HIM, THEY BELIEVE 
IN-LINE ORDER, THESE OTHER 

04:51:11.476 --> 04:51:13.576
PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT. SO THAT 
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE

04:51:13.775 --> 04:51:16.820
AN EFFECTIVE OFFRAMP FOR SOME OF
THE, THEY ARE THE REAL 

04:51:17.021 --> 04:51:19.021
SUPPORTERS OF DONALD TRUMP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS 

04:51:19.078 --> 04:51:21.777
THAT GOES FORWARD, NOW BECAUSE 
THESE ATTORNEYS FOR DONALD TRUMP

04:51:21.983 --> 04:51:27.487
HAS WRAPPED UP SO QUICKLY, SO, 
BEFORE THEIR TIME IS UP, WE CAN 

04:51:27.686 --> 04:51:29.926
MOVE ON TO THE QUESTION PHASE, 
SO TAKE US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS 

04:51:30.141 --> 04:51:34.661
NEXT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ACCORDING TO THE RULES, THEY 

04:51:34.878 --> 04:51:37.677
CAN TAKE UP TO FOUR HOURS FOR 
THE Q&amp;amp;A PORTION. THIS PORTION 

04:51:37.825 --> 04:51:43.220
THAT WE WILL MAYBE BE SEEING 
SOON, IS GOING TO START OFF 

04:51:43.356 --> 04:51:45.356
WHERE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS,
WHO HAVE QUESTIONS,

04:51:50.646 --> 04:51:52.925
CAN FILL OUT A CARD, THEY CAN'T 
VERBALLY ASK A QUESTION, THAT'S 

04:51:53.127 --> 04:51:56.439
A PART OF THE RULES, TOO, SO 
THEY FILL OUT A CARD, A SINGLE 

04:51:56.655 --> 04:51:59.117
MEMBER CAN FILL OUT THE CARD AND
ASK A LOAN QUESTION OR SEVERAL 

04:51:59.317 --> 04:52:04.470
OF THEM CAN JOIN ONE QUESTION ON
A CARD. AND IT'S ALWAYS AN 

04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:06.528
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS 
PROCEEDING, TO WATCH THIS MOMENT

04:52:06.529 --> 04:52:08.529
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE

04:52:13.278 --> 04:52:15.278
WHAT IS THEIR CURRENT THINKING, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE NOT 

04:52:15.342 --> 04:52:17.606
COMMITTED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ON 
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE, SO 

04:52:17.807 --> 04:52:20.244
THAT IS WHAT WILL BE UNDERWAY IN
THIS NEXT PHASE, AND THEN AFTER 

04:52:20.445 --> 04:52:23.269
THAT, YOU OF COURSE HAVE CLOSING
ARGUMENTS, AND THEN YOU HAVE A 

04:52:23.461 --> 04:52:25.461
BOAT

04:52:30.156 --> 04:52:31.792
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE 

04:52:31.793 --> 04:52:33.868
PROCESS, SORT OF A GRAPHIC, TO 
SEE JUST WHAT RHONDA WAS 

04:52:34.073 --> 04:52:36.073
DESCRIBING, THE FOUR HOURS, TO 
QUESTION BOTH SIDES. THAT LOOKS 

04:52:36.119 --> 04:52:38.119
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO START THAT
AFTERNOON. THEN THERE'S THE 

04:52:38.178 --> 04:52:40.015
QUESTION OF WITNESSES, THE 
CLOSING ARGUMENTS, AND THE VOTE.

04:52:40.016 --> 04:52:42.016
RHONDA, MIKE WAS

04:52:44.959 --> 04:52:47.210
CLOCKING THIS FOR US, TWO HOURS,
32 MINUTES, THAT'S ALL THE TIME 

04:52:47.425 --> 04:52:49.425
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TEAM USED

04:52:51.752 --> 04:52:55.635
, SO, THEY HAVE LEFT A LOT ON 
THE FLOOR, I MEAN, THEY HIT A 

04:52:55.840 --> 04:52:57.840
LITTLE BIT AT PRESIDENT

04:53:01.771 --> 04:53:03.771
TRUMP'S COMMENTS AND ACTIONS 
LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6, BY 

04:53:03.822 --> 04:53:05.822
TRYING TO FOCUS ON THAT GEORGIA 
PHONE CALL

04:53:10.597 --> 04:53:12.635
BUT THAT SUCH A SMALL AND 
LIMITED SLICE, AND OF COURSE 

04:53:12.837 --> 04:53:14.918
IT'S ONE THAT THE WASHINGTON 
POST HAS DEEPLY REPORTED ON. 

04:53:15.115 --> 04:53:17.115
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, THEY DID 
ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT IS 

04:53:17.173 --> 04:53:19.173
WRITTEN IN THE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT, HIS CALL

04:53:24.182 --> 04:53:26.438
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF 
GEORGIA, THE CALL THAT CAME TO 

04:53:26.639 --> 04:53:28.919
LIGHT JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE 
JANUARY 6, AND THAT WAS PROBABLY

04:53:29.121 --> 04:53:31.153
TO ADDRESS THE CLAIMS THAT ALL 
OF THIS DISCUSSION AND RHETORIC 

04:53:31.356 --> 04:53:35.441
OF A FRAUDULENT ELECTION, LED TO
JANUARY 6, AND THEY WERE TRYING 

04:53:35.645 --> 04:53:39.140
TO, IN THEIR TERMS, DESCRIBE HOW
THIS WAS NOT REALLY INVOLVED, 

04:53:39.354 --> 04:53:44.278
AND THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT 
THIS CALL WAS LEAKED, AND WENT 

04:53:44.481 --> 04:53:48.011
THROUGH IT, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T 
A VERY LARGE PART OF WHAT WE 

04:53:48.227 --> 04:53:52.324
THOUGHT WE WOULD HEAR FROM THESE
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, I THINK THEY 

04:53:52.532 --> 04:53:57.752
ADDED THAT IN THEIR JUST TO KIND
OF PUT A PERIOD AT THE END OF 

04:53:57.898 --> 04:53:59.898
THAT,

04:54:12.540 --> 04:54:14.596
THEY'VE ONLY USED A QUARTER OF 
THEIR TIME, THEY COULD HAVE 

04:54:14.796 --> 04:54:16.628
STRETCH THIS OUT LIKE THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS DID OVER 

04:54:16.629 --> 04:54:19.110
THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS, THEY HAD
A FULL 16 HOURS AT THEIR 

04:54:19.312 --> 04:54:21.758
DISPOSAL AND HAVE ONLY USED A 
LITTLE BIT OF IT, AND YOU WONDER

04:54:21.974 --> 04:54:24.252
IF THAT IS SHOWING THAT THEY 
FEEL THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE TO 

04:54:24.453 --> 04:54:26.476
WORK AS HARD TO COMPEL THE 
SENATORS IN THEIR OR THE 

04:54:26.678 --> 04:54:28.727
AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THEY CAME 
IN THIS MORNING SAYING THAT THEY

04:54:28.930 --> 04:54:31.962
WEREN'T GOING TO USE ALL OF THIS
TIME, AND IF YOU HEARD MR. 

04:54:32.099 --> 04:54:34.099
CASTOR

04:54:40.665 --> 04:54:43.327
TOWARD THE END, HE SAID WE WANT 
TO GIVE YOU BACK THIS TIME SO 

04:54:43.530 --> 04:54:45.767
THAT YOU COULD GO TO WORK FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND START 

04:54:45.968 --> 04:54:47.836
PASSING COVID LEGISLATION, WHICH
IS AGAIN, SOMETHING THAT SENATE 

04:54:47.837 --> 04:54:49.837
REPUBLICANS CAN USE, TOO, WHEN 
THEY EXPLAIN THEIR VOTE, WHEN 

04:54:49.871 --> 04:54:52.319
THEY SAY THAT WE JUST WANTED TO 
MOVE THIS ALONG BECAUSE WE HAVE 

04:54:52.534 --> 04:54:53.957
THESE OTHER WEIGHTY ISSUES AHEAD
OF US. 

04:54:53.958 --> 04:54:55.958
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, BRUCE CASTOR THERE, AT
THE END,

04:54:59.709 --> 04:55:02.180
SORT OF TRIED TO SHOW THAT HE'S 
THE GUY IN CHARGE. HE STARTED 

04:55:02.395 --> 04:55:04.636
OFF BY TALKING ABOUT AS THE LEAD
PERSON, I MAKE THE DECISIONS 

04:55:04.833 --> 04:55:07.090
HERE, AND IT DID SEEM LIKE 
TRYING TO CLAIM SOME EGO GROUND 

04:55:07.291 --> 04:55:09.291
BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM WASHINGTON 
POST REPORTING THAT DONALD TRUMP

04:55:09.381 --> 04:55:11.381
WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HIS 
ARGUMENTS,

04:55:15.115 --> 04:55:16.955
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE 
PUBLICLY GONE ON RECORD, 

04:55:16.956 --> 04:55:18.209
EXPRESSING DISMAY AND 
DISAPPOINTMENT AT HIS 

04:55:18.210 --> 04:55:21.066
PERFORMANCE EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
SO HE'S KIND OF TRYING TO CLAIM 

04:55:21.283 --> 04:55:23.769
SOME GROUND, BUT IT DOES SHOW 
YOU HOW NEW THIS IS, TO THESE 

04:55:23.984 --> 04:55:27.902
GENTLEMEN IN THAT YOU KNOW, HE 
WAS MARVELING AND QUESTIONING 

04:55:28.106 --> 04:55:30.845
WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS UNDER 
OATH, HE WAS GETTING NAMES WRONG

04:55:34.097 --> 04:55:36.363
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT FAMILIAR 
TURF FOR THEM AND FRANKLY, YOU 

04:55:37.136 --> 04:55:39.465
CAN TELL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, THAT RIFF AT THE 

04:55:39.669 --> 04:55:42.952
BEGINNING FROM CASTOR WAS SORT 
OF LIKE DWIGHT SAYING I'M THE 

04:55:43.160 --> 04:55:45.160
ASSISTANT REGIONAL MANAGER

04:55:52.205 --> 04:55:54.205
, NOT THE ASSISTANT TO THE 
REGIONAL MANAGER, THESE ARE 

04:55:54.242 --> 04:55:55.875
LAWYERS WHO DON'T HAVE A 
BACKGROUND IN CONSTITUTIONAL 

04:55:55.876 --> 04:55:58.554
LAW, NONE OF THE THREE OF THEM, 
NONE OF THE THREE OF THEM HAVE 

04:55:58.755 --> 04:56:00.582
LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH
DONALD TRUMP. NONE OF THE THREE 

04:56:00.583 --> 04:56:02.223
OF THEM HAVE LONG-STANDING 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER 

04:56:02.224 --> 04:56:06.142
ALTHOUGH CASTOR AND VANDER WIEN 
WORK AT THE SAME FIRM, IT'S A 

04:56:06.751 --> 04:56:08.751
PERSONAL INJURY AMBULANCE

04:56:11.860 --> 04:56:14.883
CHASING SLIP AND FALL KIND OF 
LAW FIRM. SO THE RESULTS OF THAT

04:56:15.057 --> 04:56:17.057
IS

04:56:21.335 --> 04:56:23.198
THEY ARE NOT CONGRESSIONAL 
STAFFERS, THEY ARE NOT LAWYERS 

04:56:23.199 --> 04:56:25.247
WHO HAVE ARGUED BEFORE THE 
SUPREME COURT, AND IT DID SHOW. 

04:56:25.465 --> 04:56:28.087
SOME OF THE GETTING THE NAMES 
WRONG, CONFUSING THE WORD SENSOR

04:56:28.227 --> 04:56:32.640
AND CENSURE, TO TALK ABOUT 
OREGON, SOMETHING THAT THE TWO 

04:56:33.406 --> 04:56:35.406
OREGON SENATORS CRINGED AT.

04:56:42.674 --> 04:56:44.928
IT FELT LIKE AMATEUR HOUR FROM 
THE TRUMP TEAM BUT AGAIN, THEY 

04:56:45.128 --> 04:56:47.013
OBVIOUSLY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT 
THEY HAVE THE VOTES. WHAT'S 

04:56:47.014 --> 04:56:49.014
AMAZING IS THAT

04:56:51.717 --> 04:56:54.193
IT APPEARS THEY HAVE AT LEAST 
ONE FEWER VOTES THAN THEY DID AT

04:56:54.394 --> 04:56:56.684
THE START OF THE WEEK, BILL 
CASSIDY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S 

04:56:56.884 --> 04:57:02.721
GOING TO VOTE ON THE FINAL ISSUE
BUT, HE SAID HE CHANGED HIS MIND

04:57:02.922 --> 04:57:04.758
BECAUSE OF THE POOR QUALITY OF 
THE PRESIDENTS DEFENSE 

04:57:04.759 --> 04:57:06.909
ARGUMENTS. AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING 
DURING THESE BREAKS, LIBBY,

04:57:12.118 --> 04:57:14.578
THIS IS A CASE THAT'S AIMED AT 
THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION AND 

04:57:14.778 --> 04:57:16.778
AIMED AT THE AUDIENCE OF ONE, 
DONALD TRUMP. INTERVIEWER DONALD

04:57:16.870 --> 04:57:18.926
TRUMP WATCHING THE LAST 2 1/2 
HOURS, YOU ARE PROBABLY PRETTY 

04:57:19.142 --> 04:57:21.626
HAPPY WITH HOW IT WENT. YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU SORT OF, THEY CHECKED 

04:57:21.828 --> 04:57:23.828
THE RIGHT BOXES, THEY USED THE 
RIGHT GRIEVANCES,

04:57:28.593 --> 04:57:30.860
THE CANCEL CULTURE LINE, THERE 
IS A FAIR AMOUNT IN THERE THAT 

04:57:31.065 --> 04:57:33.411
HAD TO MAKE TRUMP HAPPY AND 
ULTIMATELY,

04:57:39.709 --> 04:57:42.185
I'M NOT SURE FRANKLY IF THEY HAD
USED ALL 16 HOURS, THAT WOULDN'T

04:57:42.385 --> 04:57:45.248
HAVE POTENTIALLY TURNED OFF SOME
OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE ON 

04:57:45.453 --> 04:57:48.976
THE FENCE MORE. THAT SAID, IT 
REALLY IS STRIKING HOW LITTLE 

04:57:49.178 --> 04:57:51.178
TIME THEY SPENT DEALING WITH 
WHAT DEMOCRATS

04:57:54.934 --> 04:57:57.381
TEED UP AS THE CRITICAL QUESTION
AND I'M SURE THIS IS GOING TO 

04:57:57.585 --> 04:57:59.620
COME UP LATER THIS AFTERNOON 
WHICH IS, WHAT WAS TRUMP DOING 

04:57:59.823 --> 04:58:01.872
DURING THOSE HOURS, HOW MUCH DID
HE ACTUALLY RESIST, WAS TRUMP 

04:58:02.075 --> 04:58:04.075
GLEEFUL AS WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
PLAYED OUT

04:58:16.556 --> 04:58:18.556
. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE THE TRUMP 
DEFENSE LAWYERS SORT OF ASSERT 

04:58:18.617 --> 04:58:20.617
FLATLY THAT TRUMP WAS HORRIFIED 
BY WHAT HAPPENED. HE DIDN'T 

04:58:20.653 --> 04:58:23.114
APPROVE OF IT AT ALL, AND THAT 
HE MOVES QUICKLY. WE KNOW THAT'S

04:58:23.314 --> 04:58:25.569
NOT TRUE, FROM OUR OWN REPORTING
BUT ALSO FROM THE TIMELINE AND 

04:58:25.771 --> 04:58:27.771
FROM WHAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
HAVE SAID TRYING TO GET THROUGH 

04:58:27.805 --> 04:58:30.080
TO TRUMP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO. 
THE QUESTION IS, WILL THEY 

04:58:30.295 --> 04:58:31.937
UNPACK THAT IN THE QUESTION AND 
ANSWER. 

04:58:31.938 --> 04:58:40.589
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE LINE, 
WHERE THEY FOCUSED ON THE 

04:58:41.767 --> 04:58:43.767
PHRASE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

04:58:52.055 --> 04:58:54.097
UTTERED ABOUT FIGHTING AND GOING
AFTER PEOPLE, PUTTING IT IN THE 

04:58:54.313 --> 04:58:56.313
CONTEXT THAT HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT THE PRIMARIES, AND TRYING 

04:58:56.405 --> 04:58:58.466
TO GO AFTER PEOPLE IN A 
POLITICAL PRIMARY. THAT DID SEEM

04:58:58.682 --> 04:59:01.273
TO BE ONE SORT OF COGENT 
ARGUMENTS, TRYING TO GIVE SOME 

04:59:01.412 --> 04:59:07.721
MORE CONTEXT TO A SNIPPETS, THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS USED. AND 

04:59:07.940 --> 04:59:10.223
THEN THEY WERE TRYING TO SHOW 
THAT LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T TRUST 

04:59:10.441 --> 04:59:13.995
HIM ON THIS, WHAT CAN YOU TRUST 
HIM ON? 

04:59:13.996 --> 04:59:16.651
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALSO, EXPLICITLY, THERE ARE 
ARGUMENTS THAT YOU CAN MAKE, TO 

04:59:17.418 --> 04:59:20.892
DEFEND TRUMP. TRUMP DID 
EXPLICITLY SAY DON'T BE 

04:59:21.028 --> 04:59:25.009
VIOLENCE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

04:59:25.210 --> 04:59:29.093
ARE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH 
YESTERDAY AS THEY SAID 

04:59:29.298 --> 04:59:32.573
PREVIOUSLY THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE
WINK AND A NOD. THIS HAS 

04:59:32.777 --> 04:59:36.838
OBVIOUSLY COME UP IN OTHER 
CONTEXTS, WHEN MICHAEL COHEN 

04:59:37.038 --> 04:59:39.038
TESTIFIED, COHEN RECALLED, TRUMP

04:59:42.770 --> 04:59:45.628
POINTING AT A TIE IN SAYING THIS
TIE IS BLUE, AND THEN IT SORT OF

04:59:45.831 --> 04:59:47.878
BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT THE TIE 
WAS RED, TRUMP WANTED TO BE 

04:59:48.095 --> 04:59:50.095
BLUE, WITHOUT HAVING TO TELL YOU
THAT

04:59:55.277 --> 04:59:57.921
YOU HAD TO LIE AND SAY WHAT 
COLOR TIE IT WAS. THAT WAS THE 

04:59:58.123 --> 05:00:00.123
ANALOGY THAT HE HAD USED. AND 
DEMOCRATS WERE MAKING THOSE 

05:00:00.152 --> 05:00:03.236
POINTS, BECAUSE OF, ON A PRIMA 
FACIA READING OF THE TEXT OF THE

05:00:03.435 --> 05:00:05.435
SPEECH, TRUMP WAS

05:00:11.801 --> 05:00:13.801
SORT OF INCLUDING SOME OF THE 
RIGHT THINGS THAT YOU'RE 

05:00:13.869 --> 05:00:16.127
SUPPOSED TO SAY, AND THAT'S ALSO
WHY DEMOCRATS FOCUS SO MUCH ON 

05:00:16.329 --> 05:00:18.329
THE RESPONSE AFTERWARDS, WHEN HE
APPEARED TO RELISH WHAT WAS 

05:00:18.946 --> 05:00:20.946
GOING ON.

05:00:22.870 --> 05:00:24.908
BUT TRUMP POINTED AT THE 
CAPITOL, HE TOLD HIS PEOPLE, GO 

05:00:25.127 --> 05:00:27.787
TO THE CAPITOL, HE TOLD THEM HE 
WAS GOING TO GO WITH THEM, WHICH

05:00:27.991 --> 05:00:30.405
HE DIDN'T DO, AND  HE SAID FIGHT
LIKE HELL. 

05:00:34.351 --> 05:00:39.840
TRUMP COULD HEAR, TRUMP WAS 
SAYING, TALKING ABOUT, FIGHTING 

05:00:40.041 --> 05:00:42.041
SOME OF THESE

05:00:51.559 --> 05:00:53.559
RHINOS AS HE CALLED THEM, 
REPUBLICANS IN NAME ONLY BUT 

05:00:53.621 --> 05:00:55.621
PEOPLE SAYING STORM THE CAPITOL,
PEOPLE SAYING HANG MIKE PENCE, 

05:00:55.645 --> 05:00:57.912
TRUMP COULD HEAR THAT STUFF, AND
WASN'T TELLING THE  CROWD, NO, 

05:00:58.116 --> 05:01:00.169
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT, SO THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A 

05:01:00.373 --> 05:01:02.373
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC ARGUMENT.
BUT THERE CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING

05:01:02.408 --> 05:01:07.184
TO BE SAID THAT TRUMP WAS AND 
CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT PRIMARY

05:01:15.904 --> 05:01:17.568
REPUBLICANS, BUT DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE HERE THAT DIFFERENT WAYS.

05:01:17.569 --> 05:01:19.802
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST SAW SENATOR GRAHAM 
HEAD INTO THE ROOM WHERE TRUMP'S

05:01:20.020 --> 05:01:21.838
LAWYERS ARE GATHERED, RHONDA, 
THE TERM PRIMARY, PRIMARIES CAME

05:01:21.839 --> 05:01:23.964
UP A LOT, AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER
IF

05:01:31.892 --> 05:01:33.952
THIS IS A NOT-SO-SUBTLE REMINDER
TO THE JURY HERE, THAT DONALD 

05:01:34.154 --> 05:01:36.401
TRUMP STILL HAS A LOT OF POWER 
IN THEIR PARTY, AND PRIMARIES 

05:01:36.603 --> 05:01:38.603
ARE A PLACE

05:01:44.197 --> 05:01:45.839
VERY VULNERABLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, AND THAT'S WHAT

05:01:45.840 --> 05:01:48.361
HAS BEEN ON THE MINDS OF A LOT 
OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE 

05:01:48.576 --> 05:01:50.855
REPUBLICANS IS WHERE DO WE GO 
FROM HERE, WHEN THEY KNOW THAT 

05:01:51.056 --> 05:01:53.119
TRUMP IS STILL HIGHLY POPULAR IN
MANY OF THEIR STATES AND 

05:01:53.323 --> 05:01:55.323
DISTRICTS, AND THAT'S REALLY 
PART OF THE POLITICAL 

05:01:55.453 --> 05:01:59.661
CALCULATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON 
IN THE MINDS OF THESE MEMBERS. 

05:01:59.864 --> 05:02:01.917
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THEIR 
OWN ODDS OF WINNING THEIR SEATS 

05:02:02.130 --> 05:02:04.425
OR KEEPING THEIR SEATS, AND WHAT
THIS DOES TO THE PARTY OVERALL. 

05:02:04.641 --> 05:02:07.111
SO THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE
UNDERESTIMATED, TALK OF 

05:02:07.312 --> 05:02:08.925
PRIMARIES, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE 
THINKING. THEY KNOW THEIR 

05:02:08.926 --> 05:02:12.640
CHOICES NOW COULD AFFECT THEM IN
THE LONG RUN WHEN IT COMES TO 

05:02:12.843 --> 05:02:14.843
THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:02:18.602 --> 05:02:20.602
BRUCE CASTOR ARGUED THAT SINCE 
THE CONGRESS AND THE GOVERNMENT 

05:02:20.643 --> 05:02:22.686
REMAINED IN POWER ON JANUARY 6, 
HIS CLIENT CANNOT BE CHARGED 

05:02:22.901 --> 05:02:25.403
WITH INCITEMENT, LET'S LISTEN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DID THE 45th PRESIDENT ENGAGE

05:02:26.155 --> 05:02:30.931
IN INCITEMENT OF, THEY CONTINUE 
TO SAY INSURRECTION, CLEARLY, 

05:02:31.132 --> 05:02:34.074
THERE WAS NO INSURRECTION, 
INSURRECTION IS A

05:02:38.286 --> 05:02:40.843
, DEFINED IN THE LAW THAT 
INVOLVES TAKING OVER A COUNTRY,

05:02:44.658 --> 05:02:46.709
A SHADOW GOVERNMENT, TAKING THE 
TV STATIONS OVER AND HAVING SOME

05:02:46.909 --> 05:02:49.792
PLAN ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO 
WHEN YOU FINALLY TAKE POWER. 

05:02:50.196 --> 05:02:52.196
CLEARLY THIS IS NOT

05:02:55.932 --> 05:02:57.932
THAT. WHAT ARE COLLEAGUES ACROSS
THE AISLE MEANT, IS INCITEMENT 

05:02:58.532 --> 05:03:02.980
TO VIOLENCE. TO RIOT. SO THE 
WORD INCITEMENT IS THE CRITICAL 

05:03:03.124 --> 05:03:09.978
CASE IN THE CRITICAL ISSUE IN 
THE CASE. 

05:03:09.979 --> 05:03:14.272
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO JAMES, LET'S PARSE THAT A 
LITTLE BIT FURTHER. YOU KNOW, 

05:03:15.048 --> 05:03:18.446
ATTEMPTED INSURRECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT,

05:03:23.692 --> 05:03:25.783
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT WAS 
TRUMP'S AIM ON JANUARY 6? WHY 

05:03:26.546 --> 05:03:28.727
DID TRUMP HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE 
ASSEMBLED IN WASHINGTON

05:03:32.946 --> 05:03:35.640
FOR A STOP THE STEEL RALLY? IT 
WAS TO STOP THE STEEL, AS HE 

05:03:35.843 --> 05:03:39.133
THOUGHT IT WAS. IT WAS TO STOP 
THE CERTIFICATION OF THE JANUARY

05:03:39.348 --> 05:03:41.348
6 RESULTS. JANUARY 6

05:03:45.067 --> 05:03:47.067
IS THE DATE SET IN THE 
CONSTITUTION, IT'S BEEN THERE 

05:03:47.100 --> 05:03:49.823
NOW FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS AND 
IT IS THERE THE DAY THAT THE 

05:03:50.024 --> 05:03:54.748
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES ARE 
COUNTED. AND TRUMP'S GOAL WAS TO

05:03:54.947 --> 05:03:56.947
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. HE 
WANTED HIS VICE PRESIDENT, TO 

05:03:57.026 --> 05:03:59.026
REFUSE TO CERTIFY THE ELECTION. 
HE WANTED

05:04:03.171 --> 05:04:05.622
PEOPLE TO GO PROTEST AT THE VERY
LEAST, AT THE CAPITOL, TO STOP 

05:04:05.824 --> 05:04:08.885
IT FROM HAPPENING.  AND, IF THAT
HAD SUCCEEDED, THAT WOULD HAVE 

05:04:09.641 --> 05:04:11.641
BEEN IN

05:04:16.040 --> 05:04:18.040
INSURRECTION, IT WOULD'VE BEEN 
THE END OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS

05:04:18.126 --> 05:04:20.163
WE KNOW IT. IF THEY HAD STOPPED 
THE CERTIFICATION OF THE 

05:04:20.364 --> 05:04:22.421
ELECTION, WHICH THEY DID, FOR 
EIGHT HOURS, IT WOULD MEANT THAT

05:04:22.625 --> 05:04:27.529
TRUMP WOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD 
POWER AND BE PRESIDENT, AND THAT

05:04:27.730 --> 05:04:29.730
WOULD BE IN INSURRECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS 

05:04:29.768 --> 05:04:34.866
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS 
USED WAS THAT THIS WAS BEING 

05:04:35.068 --> 05:04:39.776
PLANNED AHEAD OF TIME, AND SO, 
THE REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP 

05:04:40.184 --> 05:04:42.794
ON THAT DAY, ON THE ELLIPSE, YOU
KNOW, WEREN'T THE DECISIVE 

05:04:42.939 --> 05:04:47.170
FACTOR TO PEOPLE WHO WERE 
PLANNING ON ATTACKING THE U.S. 

05:04:47.372 --> 05:04:53.485
CAPITOL . BUT WHAT DID THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAY TO 

05:04:53.684 --> 05:04:55.684
COUNTER THAT OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS?

05:05:01.837 --> 05:05:04.115
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, THEY FOCUS ON THIS TOO,
THAT IT WAS PREMEDITATED, SO 

05:05:04.329 --> 05:05:06.789
THAT'S AT LEAST ONE THING THAT 
BOTH SIDES AGREED TO WAS THAT IT

05:05:06.990 --> 05:05:08.642
WAS MORE CHOREOGRAPHED THAN 
PREVIOUSLY KNOWN. THE INFUSION 

05:05:08.643 --> 05:05:12.122
MANAGERS POINTED OUT THAT FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A SERIES OF 

05:05:12.881 --> 05:05:14.881
TWEETS AND

05:05:21.137 --> 05:05:23.601
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO JANUARY 
6, THEY CALLED IT A SAVE THE 

05:05:23.807 --> 05:05:25.831
DATE MEMO WHERE HE WAS TELLING 
THEM, STAY TUNED FOR MORE 

05:05:26.047 --> 05:05:28.092
DETAILS ABOUT JANUARY 6 IT WILL 
BE WILD. SO IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

05:05:28.296 --> 05:05:33.276
SHOWED THAT HE WAS ALSO A PART 
OF THE PRE-THINKING ABOUT 

05:05:33.684 --> 05:05:35.684
JANUARY 6, AND THAT WAS THE 
ARGUMENT THEY WERE MAKING, 

05:05:35.738 --> 05:05:39.446
HOWEVER, THE DEFENSE TEAM SAYS 
THAT REALLY THE ONUS IS ON THE 

05:05:39.857 --> 05:05:42.335
PERSONS IN THE GROUPS THAT CAME 
HERE ON THEIR OWN TO DO THIS, 

05:05:42.551 --> 05:05:44.551
AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT 
PREMEDITATED AND NOT PRESIDENT 

05:05:45.153 --> 05:05:47.153
TRUMP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:05:49.128 --> 05:05:51.605
RHONDA MADE SUCH A GOOD POINT, 
THAT MAY BE ONE THING THEY AGREE

05:05:51.805 --> 05:05:53.648
ON BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE VERY 
DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT 

05:05:53.649 --> 05:05:55.649
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INVOLVEMENT 
AND RESPONSIBILITY

05:05:59.639 --> 05:06:01.661
AND ALL THAT TEEING UP THAT 
HAPPENED AHEAD OF TIME? 

05:06:01.662 --> 05:06:03.915
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. AND IF YOU TAKE 
BRUCE CASTOR'S WORD FROM IT FOR 

05:06:04.118 --> 05:06:09.448
IT, HE SAID DONALD TRUMP COULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN CLEARER, THAT HE 

05:06:09.649 --> 05:06:12.389
WAS AGAINST POLITICAL VIOLENCE. 
BY ANY MEASURE THERE WAS

05:06:20.066 --> 05:06:22.105
ABSOLUTE LANGUAGE LIKE THAT, BY 
ANY MEASURE DONALD TRUMP IS THE 

05:06:22.321 --> 05:06:23.564
MOST PRO-LAW-ENFORCEMENT 
PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 

05:06:23.565 --> 05:06:26.850
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT WAS 
LIKE, WELL NOT BUY EVERY 

05:06:27.258 --> 05:06:29.298
MEASURE, CLEARLY BASED ON HIS 
RESPONSE. AND IN MANY WAYS, WHAT

05:06:29.498 --> 05:06:34.840
THE DEFENSE TEAM WAS ASKING 
SENATORS AND US IS TO IGNORE 

05:06:35.044 --> 05:06:39.144
WHAT WE SAW WITH THEIR OWN EYES 
AND EARS, NOT JUST ON JANUARY 6 

05:06:39.358 --> 05:06:43.657
BUT OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, WHEN
WE RELIVED THOSE DRAMATIC 

05:06:43.858 --> 05:06:45.287
EVENTS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT WE MAKE OF SENATOR 

05:06:45.288 --> 05:06:47.288
GRAHAM GOING INTO THE CHAMBER 
WHERE

05:06:50.595 --> 05:06:52.440
TRUMP'S LAWYERS ARE PREPARING 
AND COMING OUT WANDERING DOWN 

05:06:52.441 --> 05:06:53.883
THE HALL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LINDSEY GRAHAM IS AN 

05:06:53.884 --> 05:06:57.334
INTERESTING CHARACTER. THIS IS A
GUY, HE WAS A PRESIDENTIAL 

05:06:57.540 --> 05:06:59.815
CANDIDATE BACK IN 2016, CRITICAL
OF TRUMP BACK THEN AND ON THE 

05:07:00.017 --> 05:07:02.017
NIGHT OF JANUARY 6

05:07:10.459 --> 05:07:12.539
, WHEN THE SENATE RECONVENED 
AFTER THE MOB STORM THE CAPITOL 

05:07:12.740 --> 05:07:15.049
HE SAID THAT'S IT I'M DONE, 
COUNT ME OUT, DONALD TRUMP, YOU 

05:07:15.251 --> 05:07:17.551
WILL NEVER HAVE MY SUPPORT 
AGAIN. AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER

05:07:17.766 --> 05:07:20.841
HE WAS RECOMMENDING LAWYERS TO 
TRUMP, AND WAS BACK IN HIS GOOD 

05:07:21.056 --> 05:07:22.918
GRACES, GRAHAM JUST GOT 
REELECTED IN NOVEMBER IN SOUTH 

05:07:22.919 --> 05:07:24.994
CAROLINA TO ANOTHER SIX YEAR 
TERM SO HE'S SAFE, SO YOU 

05:07:25.195 --> 05:07:28.262
SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PLAYING 
AND ANGLE, AND HAS EVOLVED QUITE

05:07:28.463 --> 05:07:31.504
A LOT OVER TIME. AND, HE IS A 
LAWYER, HE'S A FORMER NAVY 

05:07:31.686 --> 05:07:35.521
RESERVE OFFICER, HE WAS A JAGGED
LAWYER, QUITE EFFECTIVE MILITARY

05:07:39.912 --> 05:07:41.945
LAWYER, JOHN McCAIN'S BEST 
FRIEND IN THE SENATE FOR A LONG 

05:07:42.158 --> 05:07:44.823
PERIOD, HE HAS TIED HIMSELF 
CLOSELY TO TRUMP SINCE McCAIN 

05:07:45.024 --> 05:07:47.024
PASSED AWAY, AND HE UNDERSTANDS 
THE SENATE.

05:07:50.994 --> 05:07:53.240
HE WAS ALSO, IT SHOULD BE SAID, 
ONE OF THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

05:07:53.456 --> 05:07:55.456
MANAGERS AGAINST BILL CLINTON. 
IN 1999.

05:08:00.859 --> 05:08:03.496
AND ONE OF THE THINGS TO WATCH 
FOR IN THIS Q&amp;amp;A PERIOD, IS THAT 

05:08:03.700 --> 05:08:05.700
REPUBLICANS WERE TRUMP ALLIES 
CAN ACTUALLY USE SOME OF THE 

05:08:05.731 --> 05:08:07.775
QUESTIONS TO HELP KIND OF 
CLEANUP THE TRUMP TEAM, THEY CAN

05:08:07.977 --> 05:08:10.105
SORT OF ASK LEADING QUESTIONS IN
A WAY THAT

05:08:15.101 --> 05:08:17.145
GETS REPUBLICANS WERE ON THE 
FENCE, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO 

05:08:17.345 --> 05:08:20.320
ARE NERVOUS AND DON'T KNOW WHAT 
TO DO, TO GIVE THEM MORE REASONS

05:08:21.869 --> 05:08:27.587
TO VOTE TO ACQUIT THE PRESIDENT,
SO LINDSEY GRAHAM IS SOMEONE WHO

05:08:27.791 --> 05:08:29.838
HAS HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF 
THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE. HE 

05:08:30.053 --> 05:08:33.155
KNOWS A LOT OF THESE WAVERING 
SENATORS PRETTY WELL, SO 

05:08:33.357 --> 05:08:37.241
CERTAINLY, HE'S GIVING ADVICE 
ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SAYING

05:08:37.444 --> 05:08:40.174
DURING THE Q&amp;amp;A, TO TRY TO WOO 
SOME OF

05:08:44.582 --> 05:08:46.643
THOSE ON THE FENCE REPUBLICANS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS WITH SENATOR JOHNSON, A 

05:08:47.411 --> 05:08:52.188
REPUBLICAN, HAS TOLD REPORTERS. 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS 

05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:54.449
BLEW THE HOUSE MANAGER CASE OUT 
OF THE WATER, THEY LEGALLY 

05:08:54.651 --> 05:08:56.470
EVISCERATED THEM, AND THEY 
CERTAINLY PROVED THAT THE FIRST 

05:08:56.471 --> 05:08:58.471
AMENDMENT APPLIES TO FIRST 
AMENDMENT

05:09:02.404 --> 05:09:04.404
SPEECH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. 
RHONDA, NOT A SURPRISE, WHERE 

05:09:04.443 --> 05:09:06.814
SONNET SENATOR JOHNSON STANDS ON
THIS, HE WANTS TO ACQUIT

05:09:10.792 --> 05:09:13.029
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THIS ONE BUT,
WHAT CAN WE READ INTO HIS 

05:09:13.236 --> 05:09:14.673
ANALYSIS TODAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: WELL, I THINK 

05:09:14.674 --> 05:09:16.674
REALLY, I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

05:09:20.194 --> 05:09:22.663
HOW IT BLEW THINGS OUT OF THE 
WATER, BUT IT DID CHANGE THE 

05:09:22.863 --> 05:09:24.863
TONE, DEFINITELY, BECAUSE FOR 
THE LAST TWO DAYS, WE'VE SEEN 

05:09:24.931 --> 05:09:26.759
HOW SENATORS HAVE BEEN FINDING 
THE EVIDENCE THAT THE 

05:09:26.760 --> 05:09:28.760
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS BROUGHT 
FORWARD IS REALLY HARD

05:09:36.553 --> 05:09:38.823
TO WATCH, HARD TO DIGEST, AND 
SOME OF THAT SADNESS ABOUT THE 

05:09:39.023 --> 05:09:40.879
DAY KIND OF RETURNED IN 
BIPARTISAN FASHION, WE SELL 

05:09:40.880 --> 05:09:42.880
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS BOTH 
TALK ABOUT HOW

05:09:48.305 --> 05:09:50.331
IT WAS SOMEWHAT DEVASTATING TO 
REWATCH AND RELIVE ALL OF THOSE 

05:09:50.548 --> 05:09:52.416
MOMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE NEVER 
BEFORE SEEN SECURITY FOOTAGE HOW

05:09:52.417 --> 05:09:55.480
WE SAW HOW SO MANY OF THEM WERE 
CLOSE TO THE RIOTERS, BUT THAT 

05:09:55.681 --> 05:09:58.136
WAS THE TONE FOR THE LAST TWO 
DAYS. NOW THE TONE HAS SHIFTED 

05:09:58.337 --> 05:10:00.225
TO AN AREA THAT'S PROBABLY MORE 
COMFORTABLE FOR SENATE 

05:10:00.226 --> 05:10:02.226
REPUBLICANS OR ANYONE WHO CAME 
IN HERE WITH

05:10:07.826 --> 05:10:10.092
A VOTE FOR ACQUITTAL ALREADY, IS
THAT NOW THE DISCUSSION IS ABOUT

05:10:10.297 --> 05:10:12.372
YOU KNOW, FREE SPEECH AND THESE 
OTHER PRECEDENTS THAT HIS TEAM 

05:10:12.575 --> 05:10:14.625
BROUGHT FORWARD IN SAYING THAT 
HE IS PROTECTED BY FREE SPEECH 

05:10:14.826 --> 05:10:16.863
AND THESE REELS THAT WE SAW, 
SEVERAL TIMES, THE SAME ONES, 

05:10:17.065 --> 05:10:19.132
SHOWING DIFFERENT POLITICIANS 
SAYING THE WORD FIGHT, WITHOUT 

05:10:19.321 --> 05:10:21.463
KNOWING THE CONTEXT OF WHY THEY 
WERE SAYING AT

05:10:25.463 --> 05:10:27.736
THAT THESE WERE THE REELS THAT 
WE KEPT SEEING OVER AND OVER 

05:10:27.951 --> 05:10:29.816
AGAIN AND SOME OF THOSE REELS 
INCLUDED CELEBRITIES LIKE 

05:10:29.817 --> 05:10:32.493
MADONNA AND IN ONE OF THEM I SAW
JOHNNY DEPP, AND THEY ARE OF 

05:10:32.709 --> 05:10:36.785
COURSE NOT ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT
IT WAS TO, FOR THE DEFENSE TO 

05:10:37.001 --> 05:10:41.724
SHOW THAT YOU KNOW, THE LIBERAL 
SIDE IN THE MEDIA AS WELL AS 

05:10:41.939 --> 05:10:43.939
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, ALSO USE 
THIS TYPE OF

05:10:52.224 --> 05:10:54.305
TOUGH RHETORIC, SO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SHOULD BE OFF THE HOOK, SO

05:10:54.506 --> 05:10:56.365
REALLY, IT'S THE TONE THAT 
CHANGED, NOT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, 

05:10:56.366 --> 05:10:58.626
THE TONE OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY
CHANGED A LITTLE BIT, AND THAT'S

05:10:58.826 --> 05:11:03.953
PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOMETHING 
THAT A LOT OF THE SENATE 

05:11:04.158 --> 05:11:05.810
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO FEEL 
MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT. 

05:11:05.811 --> 05:11:07.693
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TRUMP'S LAWYERS USED 
REPETITION TO DRIVE HOME THEIR 

05:11:07.694 --> 05:11:10.382
POINTS, AND THEY DID THIS QUITE 
QUICKLY, JUST ABOUT THREE OR SO 

05:11:10.602 --> 05:11:12.781
HOURS OF TIME USED. LET'S LISTEN
TO TRUMP'S LEAD

05:11:16.344 --> 05:11:17.175
ATTORNEY SYNTHESIZE THEIR 
DEFENSE. 

05:11:17.176 --> 05:11:20.853
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS TRIAL IS ABOUT FAR MORE 
THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT IS 

05:11:21.053 --> 05:11:23.745
ABOUT SILENCING AND BANNING THE 
SPEECH THE MAJORITY DOES NOT 

05:11:24.504 --> 05:11:30.038
AGREE WITH. IT IS ABOUT 
CANCELING 75 MILLION TRUMP 

05:11:30.199 --> 05:11:39.303
VOTERS, AND CRIMINALIZING 
POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS. THAT IS 

05:11:39.503 --> 05:11:42.045
WHAT THIS TRIAL IS REALLY ABOUT.

05:11:46.864 --> 05:11:48.864
IT'S THE ONLY EXISTENTIAL ISSUE 
BEFORE US

05:11:53.456 --> 05:11:55.629
AND ASKS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL

05:11:59.542 --> 05:12:03.444
CANCEL CULTURE TO TAKE OVER IN 
THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 

05:12:03.445 --> 05:12:07.511
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, THERE IS SOME IRONY 
HERE FOR A TRUMP LAWYER TO BE 

05:12:08.276 --> 05:12:10.276
TALKING ABOUT

05:12:13.421 --> 05:12:15.241
NULLIFYING OR CANCELING THE 
VOTES OF ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS, 

05:12:15.242 --> 05:12:18.934
WHEN THE GOAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS BEEN TO CANCEL OR NULLIFY 

05:12:19.135 --> 05:12:22.138
THE VOTES, THAT DIDN'T GO TO 
HIM, AND THAT PART OF THE EFFORT

05:12:22.455 --> 05:12:25.738
OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS, A 
HANDFUL OF THEM, WAS TO TRY TO 

05:12:25.956 --> 05:12:29.769
DELEGITIMIZE OR STOP THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTORAL 

05:12:29.912 --> 05:12:35.084
COLLEGE. IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE
HOW THEY TAKE THE FIGHT FROM 

05:12:35.222 --> 05:12:38.432
JUST ONE MAN OR ONE PERSON TO 
ALL TRUMP VOTERS, AND EVERYONE 

05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:40.628
IS EVER SUPPORTED HIM

05:12:45.257 --> 05:12:46.694
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THOSE WORDS ARE VERY IRONIC, 

05:12:46.695 --> 05:12:48.763
AND THE COMPARISON IS IRONIC, 
TOO, THAT NOW WE ARE TALKING 

05:12:48.964 --> 05:12:51.569
ABOUT THIS BEING A FAIR ELECTION
WHERE A NUMBER OF TRUMP 

05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:55.632
SUPPORTERS PUT IN THEIR VOTE 
FAIRLY AND THIS WOULD BE THE 

05:12:55.820 --> 05:12:57.820
CONSTITUTIONAL CANCEL

05:13:11.064 --> 05:13:13.114
CULTURE, THAT MIGHT BE A NEW 
PHRASE THAT SOME SUPPORTERS OF 

05:13:13.330 --> 05:13:15.579
PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT USE BUT I 
THINK THAT LINE, TO IS SOMETHING

05:13:15.780 --> 05:13:17.849
WE SAW MR. CASTOR SPEAKING TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TELLING 

05:13:18.052 --> 05:13:20.519
THEM, IF THE SENATE DOES THIS, 
IF THEY VOTE TO CONVICT OR ANY 

05:13:20.734 --> 05:13:22.734
OF THESE REPUBLICANS VOTE TO 
CONVICT, THAT'S TAKING AWAY YOUR

05:13:22.770 --> 05:13:25.013
VOTE. AND THAT COULD BE A PRETTY
EFFECTIVE MESSAGE, TOO, TOO MANY

05:13:25.213 --> 05:13:27.267
TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO TO FEEL 
THAT THEY HAVE HAD THINGS TAKEN 

05:13:27.468 --> 05:13:29.951
AWAY FROM THEM, SO I THINK THAT 
WAS AN APPEAL OR TECHNIQUE TO 

05:13:30.165 --> 05:13:32.165
TALK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:13:40.195 --> 05:13:42.195
JAMES, HAVE WE GOTTEN ANY 
ANSWERS OR INSIGHTS AS TO 

05:13:42.258 --> 05:13:44.514
PRESIDENT TRUMP STATE OF MIND OR
GOALS, IN THE FIRST HOURS AFTER 

05:13:44.714 --> 05:13:46.560
THE ATTACK? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, WE HAVEN'T, AND THAT IS 

05:13:46.561 --> 05:13:48.561
SUPER IMPORTANT. WHAT WAS TRUMP 
THINKING?

05:13:59.456 --> 05:14:01.456
WHY WASN'T HE QUICKER TO 
RESPOND? WHY WASN'T HE INVOLVED 

05:14:01.511 --> 05:14:03.550
IN DISCUSSIONS, THERE WAS A LOT 
OF FLATLY DENYING ALL MEDIA 

05:14:03.752 --> 05:14:06.060
REPORTS EVER INCLUDING FROM THE 
POST AND THE TIMES AND FOX NEWS,

05:14:06.262 --> 05:14:08.523
SAYING YOU CAN'T TRUST THE MEDIA
AT ONE POINT, THE TRUMP LAWYER 

05:14:08.724 --> 05:14:12.238
SAID, BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH 
REPORTING FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE 

05:14:12.452 --> 05:14:14.712
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, PEOPLE WHO 
WERE WITH TRUMP THAT DAY, THAT 

05:14:14.914 --> 05:14:17.568
HE WAS ENJOYING THE SHOW, THAT 
HE WAS WATCHING IT ALL PLAY OUT 

05:14:17.770 --> 05:14:19.770
ON CABLE NEWS, THAT

05:14:29.851 --> 05:14:32.497
HE DIDN'T WANT TO AND DID NOT 
CALL MIKE PENCE TO CHECK ON HIM 

05:14:32.699 --> 05:14:34.699
OR HIS SAFETY, THAT HE WASN'T 
INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 

05:14:34.746 --> 05:14:36.793
MOBILIZING THE NATIONAL GUARD, 
SO BY TRYING TO GROUP ALL OF 

05:14:36.992 --> 05:14:38.992
THAT REPORTING AND JUST 
DISMISSING IT OUT OF HAND, IS 

05:14:39.068 --> 05:14:41.337
SOMEHOW HEARSAY, HE DID NOT 
RESPOND TO ANY OF THAT, AND THAT

05:14:41.551 --> 05:14:43.551
IS POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN 
TERMS OF TRYING TO WIN OVER 

05:14:43.624 --> 05:14:45.268
THESE WAVERING REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE 

05:14:45.269 --> 05:14:49.605
BILL CASSIDY AND LISA MURKOWSKI 
SAID, THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT 

05:14:49.806 --> 05:14:51.806
TRUMP WAS DOING DURING THAT 
MULTIHOUR WINDOW, AND THAT IS 

05:14:51.876 --> 05:14:53.876
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

05:14:56.998 --> 05:15:01.302
IT HAS SORT OF MADE SENSE, 
PEOPLE ARGUE, TO HAVE THIS 

05:15:01.708 --> 05:15:04.132
TRIAL, IS TO ILLUMINATE WHAT 
EXACTLY TRUMP WAS DOING DURING 

05:15:04.269 --> 05:15:07.667
THOSE CRITICAL HOURS, WHEN HELP 
WAS DESPERATELY NEEDED, WHEN 

05:15:07.871 --> 05:15:12.338
DEMOCRACY ITSELF WAS UNDER 
ATTACK AND THE PRESIDENT DID 

05:15:12.472 --> 05:15:14.472
NOTHING

05:15:16.922 --> 05:15:18.136
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT 

05:15:18.137 --> 05:15:23.075
SPEECH, DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS 
MENTIONED THE BRANDENBURG TEST, 

05:15:23.279 --> 05:15:25.726
AND IN CASE YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR 
WITH THAT, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT A

05:15:25.939 --> 05:15:28.340
LITTLE BIT, THAT TERM WAS 
ESTABLISHED WITH THE COURT CASE 

05:15:28.485 --> 05:15:30.485
BRANDENBURG

05:15:33.913 --> 05:15:35.972
VERSUS OHIO IN 1969, AND IT 
BECAME A LEGAL GUIDELINE TO 

05:15:36.193 --> 05:15:38.034
DETERMINE WHEN INFLAMMATORY 
SPEECH CAN BE RESTRICTED, SO THE

05:15:38.035 --> 05:15:40.035
TEST DETERMINED THAT THE 
GOVERNOR GOVERNOR OF THEM IT MAY

05:15:40.658 --> 05:15:45.421
PROHIBIT SPEECH ADVOCATING THE 
USE OF FORCE IF THE SPEECH MEETS

05:15:45.623 --> 05:15:47.671
THE TEST. NUMBER 1, THE SPEECH 
IS DIRECTED TO INCITING OR 

05:15:47.873 --> 05:15:50.734
PRODUCING IMMINENT LAWLESS 
ACTION AND NUMBER 2, THE SPEECH 

05:15:50.938 --> 05:15:52.938
IS LIKELY TO

05:15:56.663 --> 05:15:58.711
PRODUCE SUCH ACTION. LET'S TALK 
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THAT. 

05:15:58.712 --> 05:16:01.265
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN 1969, OR
MAYBE A YEAR EARLIER,

05:16:06.512 --> 05:16:09.173
THIS GUY IN OHIO, IN CINCINNATI,
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE KU KLUX 

05:16:09.390 --> 05:16:11.862
KLAN AND HE INVITED A LOCAL TV 
REPORTER TO COME TO HIM COME 

05:16:12.067 --> 05:16:14.321
WITH HIM TO A KLAN MEETING, 
WHERE THEY WERE ALL IN HOODS, 

05:16:14.525 --> 05:16:19.456
AND THIS GUY GAVE THIS FIERY 
SPEECH TALKING ABOUT IN A VERY 

05:16:20.213 --> 05:16:25.442
RACIST WAY, TAKING ON THE LOCAL 
BLACK COMMUNITY. AND AS A RESULT

05:16:25.645 --> 05:16:30.196
OF THE TELEVISION FOOTAGE, HE 
WAS CHARGED WITH INCITING 

05:16:30.398 --> 05:16:32.398
VIOLENCE AGAINST 
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

05:16:36.332 --> 05:16:38.382
AND WAS CONVICTED UNDER OHIO 
LAW, AND THEN IT WAS APPEALED, 

05:16:38.597 --> 05:16:40.995
IRONICALLY, HIS LAWYERS WERE 
FROM THE ACLU, A YOUNG ELINOR 

05:16:41.135 --> 05:16:43.135
HOLMES

05:16:50.687 --> 05:16:53.175
, SHE DEFENDED HIM, THEY TOOK IT
TO THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY 

05:16:53.376 --> 05:16:55.855
WON, AND THEY SAID THAT THE BAR 
SHOULD BE REALLY HIGH, THE FIRST

05:16:56.057 --> 05:16:58.057
AMENDMENT IS IMPORTANT AND 
PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY 

05:16:58.126 --> 05:17:00.187
THINGS AND SO THE COURT AGREED, 
THEY ENDED UP VACATING HIS 

05:17:00.388 --> 05:17:02.388
CONVICTION AND THEY CREATED THIS
TWO-PART TEST, THE SECOND PART 

05:17:02.976 --> 05:17:05.500
IS THE HARVEST, THAT IT LEADS TO
IMMINENT VIOLENCE. TRUMP'S 

05:17:05.707 --> 05:17:07.707
LAWYERS BROUGHT UP BRANDENBURG

05:17:13.917 --> 05:17:16.425
TODAY, AND THEY HAD A GRAPHIC ON
THE SCREEN, THAT PUT THOSE TWO 

05:17:16.639 --> 05:17:19.074
PARTS OF THE TEST OUT, AND THE 
LAWYER SAID IT DOESN'T EVEN MEET

05:17:19.279 --> 05:17:22.097
PART ONE OF THE BRANDENBURG 
TEST, WHICH IS, DID HE TRY TO 

05:17:22.233 --> 05:17:27.481
INCITE? WAS HE AIMING TO INCITE?
AND JAMIE RASKIN ARGUED AT SOME 

05:17:27.681 --> 05:17:30.090
LENGTH YESTERDAY THAT TRUMP 
DIDN'T MEET BOTH PARTS OF THE 

05:17:30.232 --> 05:17:34.404
BRANDENBURG TEST. TRUMP'S 
LAWYERS DID UNTIL WITH THE 

05:17:34.608 --> 05:17:36.608
SECOND PART OF THE STANDARD 
BECAUSE

05:17:42.807 --> 05:17:45.066
THEY SAID THE FIRST PART MADE IT
MOOT. RASKIN SAID IT DOESN'T 

05:17:45.269 --> 05:17:47.124
MATTER FROM VIOLATED THE 
BRANDENBURG TEST OR NOT BECAUSE 

05:17:47.125 --> 05:17:49.551
HE'S PRESIDENT AND HE'S A PUBLIC
OFFICIAL. THE STANDARD IS 

05:17:49.698 --> 05:17:53.340
DIFFERENT THAN IF HE IS A 
PRIVATE CITIZEN. HE NOTED HIS 

05:17:53.541 --> 05:17:55.812
OWN DAUGHTER IS A TEACHER AND 
SHE COULD GET FIRED FOR MAKING 

05:17:56.013 --> 05:17:58.069
COMMENTS IN HER ROLE AS A PUBLIC
OFFICIAL AND THAT INTUITIVELY 

05:17:58.284 --> 05:18:00.697
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS HELD TO A DIFFERENT

05:18:00.843 --> 05:18:04.449
STANDARD. SO THERE IS AN OPEN 
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT 

05:18:04.651 --> 05:18:06.651
UNDER THE LAW,

05:18:14.652 --> 05:18:16.694
IF TRUMP WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, 
HE COULD BE CHARGED AND 

05:18:16.906 --> 05:18:18.522
CONVICTED FOR INCITEMENT, AND 
THERE ARE ACTUALLY SERIOUS 

05:18:18.523 --> 05:18:20.564
LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT 
QUESTION. SOME WHO SAY, TO 

05:18:20.767 --> 05:18:22.626
ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT WHILE THEY 
THINK TRUMP SHOULD BE CONVICTED 

05:18:22.627 --> 05:18:25.743
UNDER A COURT, IN A NORMAL COURT
RECEDING, TRUMP WOULD PROBABLY 

05:18:25.945 --> 05:18:30.230
NOT BE CONVICTED UNDER THE 
BRANDENBURG CASE PRESIDENT FOR 

05:18:30.432 --> 05:18:32.432
INCITEMENT, JUST BECAUSE, HE WAS
A

05:18:37.992 --> 05:18:40.232
MEETING BOTH PARTS OF THAT BUT 
THERE ARE SCHOLARS WHO SAY, THE 

05:18:40.439 --> 05:18:42.439
SUPREME COURT VERY CLEARLY WOULD
HAVE INTENDED THERE TWO-PART 

05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:47.319
STANDARD TO APPLY TO THE KIND OF
SPEECH THAT TRUMP OFFERED

05:18:53.595 --> 05:18:56.071
, AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE 
TRUMP DEFENSE HAS GONE WITH THE 

05:18:56.285 --> 05:18:57.713
FREE-SPEECH ARGUMENT, THIS 
PROBABLY IS THE STRONGEST 

05:18:57.714 --> 05:18:59.714
POSSIBLE LEGAL ARGUMENT

05:19:06.519 --> 05:19:08.773
BUT AGAIN, WHAT IS IMPEACHABLE, 
THIS CAME UP A LOT DURING THE 

05:19:08.974 --> 05:19:10.821
WHOLE UKRAINE AFFAIR, WHAT IS 
ILLEGAL AND IMPEACHABLE ARE 

05:19:10.822 --> 05:19:12.863
DIFFERENT. THIS IS NOT TRUMP 
BEING CHARGED IN THE COURT OF 

05:19:13.067 --> 05:19:15.142
LAW WITH INCITEMENT UNDER STATE 
LAW, THIS IS TRUMP BEING CHARGED

05:19:15.346 --> 05:19:17.397
WITH VIOLATING HIS OATH OF 
OFFICE TO TAKE CARE, WHICH IS 

05:19:17.615 --> 05:19:19.615
THE WORDING OF THE CONSTITUTION

05:19:31.441 --> 05:19:33.441
TO FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE LAWS 
OF THE UNITED STATES AND 

05:19:33.483 --> 05:19:35.554
DEMOCRATS THAT HIS SPEECH AND 
CONDUCT THAT DAY MEANT THAT HE 

05:19:35.754 --> 05:19:38.021
FAILED TO UPHOLD HIS OATH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND YET, RHONDA, THERE ARE A 

05:19:38.222 --> 05:19:40.675
LOT OF LAWYERS IN THAT CHAMBER, 
THERE ARE A LOT OF LAWYERS AND 

05:19:40.881 --> 05:19:42.930
LAW DEGREES AMONG SENATORS, AND 
YOU KNOW, WHILE I'M READING OR 

05:19:43.134 --> 05:19:44.967
REPORTING ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT 
AND REALLY LEARNING ABOUT THE 

05:19:44.968 --> 05:19:47.428
HISTORY AND DIGGING INTO IT, A 
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM, THEY

05:19:47.629 --> 05:19:51.548
GET THESE REFERENCES BECAUSE 
THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND HAVE LAW

05:19:51.755 --> 05:19:54.309
DEGREES, SO IT'S INTERESTING TO 
GET THEIR INSIGHT INTO HOW THEY

05:19:59.920 --> 05:20:01.920
WAIVE THESE BARS, THAT THE 
PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE ARE 

05:20:01.986 --> 05:20:04.043
TRYING TO HIT OR SAY THE 
PRESIDENT DID NOT HIT. 

05:20:04.044 --> 05:20:08.209
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT, MOST OF 
CONGRESS, A MAJORITY OF MEMBERS

05:20:14.514 --> 05:20:16.552
HAVE EITHER A LAW DEGREE OR 
PRACTICE LAW BEFORE THEY CAME 

05:20:16.768 --> 05:20:18.821
INTO CONGRESS, SO, I'M SURE MANY
OF THESE TERMS, THESE PRECEDENTS

05:20:19.022 --> 05:20:23.735
ARE FAMILIAR TO THEM BUT IT'S 
INTERESTING, THE COMMENTS THAT 

05:20:23.938 --> 05:20:26.216
MANY OF THEM MAKE TO REPORTERS 
WHO ARE THERE OUTSIDE IN THE 

05:20:26.977 --> 05:20:30.094
HALLWAY, AND WE NEED GO TO THE 
MICROPHONE, NEAR THE SUBWAY 

05:20:30.298 --> 05:20:32.298
AREA, THEY ARE REALLY TALKING 
ABOUT THE LAW.

05:20:39.764 --> 05:20:41.817
AND THAT'S VERY INTERESTING TO 
ME. MANY OF THEM HAVE LEGAL 

05:20:42.021 --> 05:20:43.661
EXPERIENCE, AND LEGAL 
BACKGROUNDS AND YOU DON'T HEAR 

05:20:43.662 --> 05:20:45.662
THEM TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT 
USUALLY HEAR THEM TALKING ABOUT 

05:20:45.747 --> 05:20:47.997
THE POLITICS OF THE ISSUE AND I 
THINK THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S PART 

05:20:48.200 --> 05:20:49.642
OF THAT PARTISANSHIP, THAT 
REALLY INTENSE PARTISANSHIP 

05:20:49.643 --> 05:20:51.928
THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW ON THE
HILL AND THROUGHOUT OUR PUBLIC, 

05:20:52.131 --> 05:20:55.669
WE ARE AT A VERY HIGHLY 
POLARIZED LEVEL AND THEY KNOW 

05:20:55.885 --> 05:21:01.401
THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT THEY 
ARE STICKING TO RIGHT NOW, SO IT

05:21:01.601 --> 05:21:03.636
IS INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT 
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE THINKING WHEN

05:21:03.836 --> 05:21:07.527
THEY ARE HEARING BOTH SIDES 
ARGUE CERTAIN PRECEDENTS IS, 

05:21:07.740 --> 05:21:09.998
WITH JAMIE RASKIN AND WE'VE 
NOTED THIS BEFORE, THAT HE IS A 

05:21:10.213 --> 05:21:12.213
CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER BY TRADE

05:21:23.135 --> 05:21:24.768
AND TAUGHT AT AMERICAN 
UNIVERSITY FOR YEARS BEFORE 

05:21:24.769 --> 05:21:26.652
COMING TO CONGRESS AS A 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT, SO, 

05:21:26.653 --> 05:21:28.909
THAT WAS LIKELY ONE OF THE 
REASONS HE WAS CHOSEN AS THE 

05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:31.348
LEAD IN PIZZA MANAGERS BECAUSE 
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE. AND ALSO, IT'S

05:21:31.550 --> 05:21:33.550
JUST SO INTERESTING TO SEE 
SENATOR CRUZ AND SENATOR GRAHAM 

05:21:33.609 --> 05:21:36.065
GO IN AND OUT OF THAT ROOM WITH 
TRUMP'S LAWYERS, TOO, THOSE TWO 

05:21:36.268 --> 05:21:38.747
MEN ARE ALSO LAWYERS BY TRADE 
AND I'M NOT SURE IF THEY ARE 

05:21:38.950 --> 05:21:41.632
GOING OVER ANY SORT OF LEGAL 
PROCESS IN THAT ROOM BUT IT'S 

05:21:41.833 --> 05:21:44.782
STUNNING TO SEE THAT BECAUSE IF 
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IF IT WAS

05:21:51.663 --> 05:21:53.924
A CRIMINAL CASE, TO SEE JURORS 
MEET WITH THE DEFENSE, AT LENGTH

05:21:54.126 --> 05:21:55.758
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THAT 
CERTAINLY WOULD RAISE EYEBROWS 

05:21:55.759 --> 05:21:58.013
BUT THAT ALSO SHOWS YOU THIS IS 
NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING, THIS 

05:21:58.222 --> 05:22:00.471
IS SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT OF 
OUR POLITICS AND IS IN OUR 

05:22:01.238 --> 05:22:03.238
CONSTITUTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:22:05.006 --> 05:22:07.063
JAMES, YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER 
ABOUT SORT OF THE BACKGROUND OF 

05:22:07.263 --> 05:22:09.317
SOMEONE LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM, AND
WHAT HE'S ABLE TO OFFER THE 

05:22:09.518 --> 05:22:14.047
TRUMP LAWYERS BUT NOT ONLY CAN 
THE SORT OF CONSULT ABOUT PAST 

05:22:14.250 --> 05:22:16.080
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS, THEY KNEW 
THE ROOM, THEY KNOW THE 

05:22:16.081 --> 05:22:18.081
REPUBLICAN BODY, SO THEY CAN BE 
GIVING INSIGHT INTO THESE 

05:22:18.139 --> 05:22:20.139
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE NOT USED TO 
BEING

05:22:27.002 --> 05:22:29.669
IN FRONT OF A JURY LIKE THIS, 
AND NOT USED TO BEING ON THE 

05:22:29.871 --> 05:22:32.125
NATIONAL STAGE LIKE THIS, THEY 
CAN GIVE THEM A SENSE OF HOW 

05:22:32.339 --> 05:22:33.781
REPUBLICANS WILL INTERPRET 
ARGUMENTS, WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE 

05:22:33.782 --> 05:22:36.272
CRAVING TO HEAR OR DON'T WANT TO
HEAR, WHAT MIGHT STICK AND WHAT 

05:22:36.476 --> 05:22:38.476
MIGHT NOT STICK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, AND,

05:22:43.067 --> 05:22:45.067
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT 
ULTIMATELY, THEY JUST NEED TO 

05:22:45.128 --> 05:22:47.199
SECURE 37 VOTES FOR ACQUITTAL, 
AND GRAHAM AND CRUISE WHO HAVE 

05:22:47.399 --> 05:22:53.990
THAT TIME IN AT LOGGERHEADS BOTH
SERVE TOGETHER ON A COUPLE OF 

05:22:54.205 --> 05:22:59.117
THE SAME COMMITTEES ACTUALLY, 
AND THEY BOTH KIND OF UNDERSTAND

05:22:59.318 --> 05:23:01.912
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE 
CONFERENCE AND BOTH OF THEM 

05:23:02.056 --> 05:23:06.349
UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC OF TRYING
TO PLACATE TRUMP BUT ALSO APPEAL

05:23:08.114 --> 05:23:10.114
TO THE SENATORS AND THE BASE AND

05:23:14.065 --> 05:23:16.065
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS 
INTERESTING, IN THE ARGUMENT 

05:23:16.122 --> 05:23:18.195
THAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS MADE AS 
THEY TALKED ABOUT TWO OTHER 

05:23:18.960 --> 05:23:22.882
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS IS, AND
THOSE WERE SURPRISING AND THOSE 

05:23:23.096 --> 05:23:25.145
DIDN'T COME UP IN THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT CASE BECAUSE THEY 

05:23:25.350 --> 05:23:27.743
ARE NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT, 
AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE 

05:23:27.887 --> 05:23:33.306
LIKE GRAHAM OR CRUISE SAYING, 
LAY OFF ON MAKING THAT THE 

05:23:33.508 --> 05:23:35.346
CENTERPIECE OF WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT 

05:23:35.347 --> 05:23:38.421
GOING TO APPEAL TO SOMEONE LIKE 
BILL CASSIDY OR PAT TOOMEY, 

05:23:38.636 --> 05:23:40.636
INSTEAD, FOCUS MORE ON

05:23:48.674 --> 05:23:50.741
X OR Y, SO THAT'S WHAT I ASSUME 
THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE 

05:23:50.944 --> 05:23:52.985
HAPPENING, AND AGAIN, IT'S ALSO 
POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE LINING UP

05:23:53.189 --> 05:23:55.189
SOME QUESTIONS, SOME SOFTBALL 
QUESTIONS, SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST

05:23:55.266 --> 05:23:57.330
KIND OF A LINEUP OF HARD-HITTING
TOUGH THINGS AIMED AT THE 

05:23:57.543 --> 05:24:00.420
PRESIDENTS DEFENSE TEAM BUT I 
ASSUME THERE WILL BE SOME 

05:24:00.623 --> 05:24:02.448
SOFTBALL THAT SOME OF THE 
PRESIDENTS ALLIES THROW INTO 

05:24:02.449 --> 05:24:04.449
SORT OF HELP CHANGE THE

05:24:07.555 --> 05:24:10.218
TONE AND THE TENOR IN THE ROOM 
SO THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT 

05:24:10.421 --> 05:24:12.694
DID THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY 
WHEN A LOT OF EVEN THE PRESENCE 

05:24:12.898 --> 05:24:14.898
MOST ARDENT SUPPORTERS

05:24:18.682 --> 05:24:20.326
WERE SITTING IN A KIND OF 
EMOTIONAL WAY. 

05:24:20.327 --> 05:24:23.028
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE IS BACK IN LET'S 
GO BACK INTO THE CHAMBER FOR THE

05:24:23.232 --> 05:24:27.420
QUESTION PERIOD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PURSUANT TO THE PROVISION

05:24:31.651 --> 05:24:33.925
, THE SENATE HAS PROVIDED UP TO 
FOUR HOURS DURING WHICH SENATORS

05:24:34.684 --> 05:24:37.441
MAY SUBMIT QUESTIONS IN WRITING,
DIRECTED EITHER TO THE MANAGERS 

05:24:38.202 --> 05:24:41.744
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
OR A COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 

05:24:41.946 --> 05:24:43.946
PRESIDENT. THE MAJORITY LEADER

05:24:47.475 --> 05:24:48.920
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT 

05:24:48.921 --> 05:24:50.921
THE ANSWERS WITHIN THE FOUR HOUR
QUESTION PERIOD

05:24:56.728 --> 05:24:58.791
BE LIMITED TO FIVE MINUTES EACH.
AND IF THE QUESTIONS ARE 

05:24:58.996 --> 05:25:00.653
DIRECTED TO BOTH PARTIES, THE 
TIME SPEEDILY DIVIDED, 

05:25:00.654 --> 05:25:04.545
FURTHERMORE, THAT QUESTIONS 
ALTERNATE SIDES FOR POSING 

05:25:04.748 --> 05:25:07.804
QUESTIONS, FOR AS LONG AS BOTH 
SIDES HAVE QUESTIONS? 

05:25:07.805 --> 05:25:09.805
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO ORDERED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:25:15.243 --> 05:25:19.829
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DESK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR WILL SUBMIT IT.

05:25:38.761 --> 05:25:40.761
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE QUESTION FROM SENATOR 
SCHUMER AND SENATOR FEINSTEIN IS

05:25:40.801 --> 05:25:43.546
DIRECTED TO THE HOUSE MANAGERS, 
THE CLERK WILL READ IT.

05:25:53.541 --> 05:25:56.036
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ISN'T IT THE CASE THAT THE 
VIOLENT ATTACK AND SIEGE ON THE 

05:25:56.240 --> 05:25:58.690
CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6  WOULD NOT 
HAVE HAPPENED IF NOT FOR THE 

05:25:58.896 --> 05:26:00.896
CONDUCT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP?

05:26:28.842 --> 05:26:31.284
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION 
DIRECTLY, DONALD TRUMP SUMMONED 

05:26:31.692 --> 05:26:34.349
THE MOP, HE SUMMONED THE MOB AND
LIT THE FLAME. EVERYTHING THAT 

05:26:34.564 --> 05:26:36.564
FOLLOWED WAS BECAUSE OF HIS 
DOING

05:26:39.100 --> 05:26:40.959
. AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD HAVE 
IMMEDIATELY AND FORCEFULLY 

05:26:40.960 --> 05:26:45.434
INTERVENED TO STOP THE VIOLENCE,
HE NEVER DID. IN OTHER WORDS, 

05:26:45.637 --> 05:26:47.470
THIS VIOLENT BUDDY INSURRECTION 
THAT OCCURRED ON JANUARY 6, 

05:26:47.471 --> 05:26:49.471
WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED BUT FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

05:26:52.967 --> 05:26:55.160
THE EVIDENCE WE PRESENTED AT 
TRIAL MAKES THIS ABSOLUTELY 

05:26:55.296 --> 05:26:59.850
CLEAR. THIS ATTACK AS WE SAID, 
DIDN'T COME FROM ONE RANDOM 

05:27:00.028 --> 05:27:04.596
SPEECH AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY 
ACCIDENT, AND THAT MOB DIDN'T 

05:27:04.813 --> 05:27:10.534
COME OUT OF THIN AIR. BEFORE THE
ELECTION, DONALD TRUMP SPREAD 

05:27:10.736 --> 05:27:12.736
LIE AFTER LIE ABOUT POTENTIAL 
FRAUD,

05:27:21.844 --> 05:27:23.844
AN ELECTION THAT HADN'T EVEN 
HAPPENED YET, MONTHS BEFORE THE 

05:27:23.900 --> 05:27:25.981
ELECTION TOOK PLACE, HE WAS 
SAYING IT WAS RIGGED, THAT IT 

05:27:26.184 --> 05:27:28.945
WAS GOING TO BE STOLEN. ALL TO 
MAKE HIS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE THAT

05:27:29.681 --> 05:27:32.175
THE ONLY WAY HE WAS GOING TO 
LOSE IS IF THE ELECTION WAS 

05:27:32.391 --> 05:27:34.391
STOLEN, IF IT WAS RIGGED.

05:27:38.523 --> 05:27:40.777
AND WHEN HE DID LOSE, HE SPENT 
WEEK AFTER WEEK INCITING HIS 

05:27:40.991 --> 05:27:43.068
SUPPORTERS TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR
VOTES HAD BEEN STOLEN AND THAT 

05:27:43.269 --> 05:27:48.587
THE ELECTION WAS FRAUDULENT AND 
THAT IT WAS THERE PATRIOTIC DUTY

05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:51.050
TO FIGHT LIKE HELL TO FIGHT THE 
STEEL, AND TAKE THEIR COUNTRY 

05:27:51.268 --> 05:27:53.522
BACK. AND REMEMBER, THIS IS IN 
THE UNITED STATES WHERE OUR VOTE

05:27:53.938 --> 05:27:55.976
IS HER VOICE. YOU TELL SOMEBODY 
THAT AN ELECTION VICTORY IS 

05:27:56.192 --> 05:27:58.333
BEING STOLEN FROM THEM, THAT IS 
A COMBUSTIBLE SITUATION

05:28:06.910 --> 05:28:09.181
. AND HE GAVE THEM CLEAR 
DIRECTION ON HOW TO DEAL WITH 

05:28:09.393 --> 05:28:11.653
THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, ON DECEMBER 
19, 18 DAYS PRIOR TO JANUARY 6, 

05:28:12.410 --> 05:28:15.143
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THEM HOW 
AND WHERE TO FIGHT FOR HIM. HE 

05:28:15.360 --> 05:28:17.861
FIRST ISSUED HIS CALL TO ACTION 
FOR JANUARY 6. THIS WAS A SAVE 

05:28:18.615 --> 05:28:24.824
THE DATE, SENT 18 DAYS BEFORE 
THE EVENT ON JANUARY 6. AND IT 

05:28:25.025 --> 05:28:26.899
WASN'T JUST A CASUAL ONE-OFF 
REFERENCE. OR A SINGULAR 

05:28:26.900 --> 05:28:32.451
INVITATION, FOR THE NEXT EIGHT 
TEEN DAYS, HE DIRECTED ALL OF 

05:28:32.654 --> 05:28:35.109
THE RAGE HE HAD DECIDED TO 
JANUARY 6. AND THAT WAS FOR HIM,

05:28:35.311 --> 05:28:37.311
WHAT HE SAW AS HIS LAST CHANCE

05:28:40.675 --> 05:28:43.301
TO STOP THE TRANSFER OF POWER, 
TO STOP FROM LOSING THE 

05:28:43.446 --> 05:28:45.446
PRESIDENCY.

05:28:46.858 --> 05:28:48.903
AND HE SAID THINGS LIKE QUOTE, 
FIGHT TILL THE DEATH, AND 

05:28:49.105 --> 05:28:51.251
JANUARY 6 WOULD BE A WILD AND 
HISTORIC DAY.

05:28:59.727 --> 05:29:02.010
AND THIS WAS WORKING, THEY GOT 
THE MESSAGE, IN THE DAYS LEADING

05:29:02.213 --> 05:29:04.258
UP TO THE ATTACK, REPORT AFTER 
REPORT, SOCIAL MEDIA POST AFTER 

05:29:04.475 --> 05:29:06.572
SOCIAL MEDIA POST, CONFIRMED 
THAT THESE INSURGENTS WERE 

05:29:06.965 --> 05:29:08.965
PLANNING ARMED VIOLENCE, BUT 
THEY WERE PLANNING IT BECAUSE HE

05:29:09.015 --> 05:29:11.083
HAD BEEN PRIMING THEM, BECAUSE 
HE HAD BEEN CAMPING THEM UP, 

05:29:11.286 --> 05:29:13.286
THAT'S WHY THEY WERE PLANNING 
IT.

05:29:18.680 --> 05:29:20.680
THESE POSTS, CONFIRMED BY 
REPORTS FROM THE FBI AND CAPITOL

05:29:20.722 --> 05:29:22.593
POLICE, MADE CLEAR THAT THESE 
INSURGENTS WERE PLANNING TO 

05:29:22.594 --> 05:29:24.960
CARRY WEAPONS, INCLUDING GUNS, 
TO TARGET THE CAPITOL ITSELF .

05:29:30.385 --> 05:29:32.752
AND YET, DONALD TRUMP FROM 
JANUARY 5 TWO THE MORNING OF THE

05:29:32.889 --> 05:29:34.889
SPEECH TWEETED 34 TIMES

05:29:43.902 --> 05:29:46.561
URGING HIS SUPPORTERS TO GET 
READY TO STOP THE STEEL. HE EVEN

05:29:46.748 --> 05:29:49.224
ON THE EVE OF THE ATTACK WARNED 
US THAT IT WAS COMING. HE WARNED

05:29:49.415 --> 05:29:51.117
US THAT THOUSANDS WERE 
DESCENDING INTO D.C. AND WOULD 

05:29:51.118 --> 05:29:55.120
NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. WHEN I GOT 
THERE AT THE SAVE AMERICA MERIT,

05:29:55.306 --> 05:29:57.515
HE TOLD THEM AGAIN IN THAT 
SPEECH EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. HIS 

05:29:57.716 --> 05:30:02.341
LAWYER OPENED WITH, "LET'S HAVE 
A TRIAL BY COMBAT. THAT WAS RUDY

05:30:02.555 --> 05:30:09.299
GIULIANI. DONALD TRUMP THAT 
MESSAGE HOME. HE PRAISED RUDY 

05:30:09.501 --> 05:30:11.501
GIULIANI AS A FIGHTER. PRESIDENT
TRUMP USED

05:30:32.451 --> 05:30:34.482
THE WORD FIGHT OR FIGHTING 20 
TIMES IN THAT SPEECH. REMEMBER, 

05:30:34.683 --> 05:30:36.718
YOU HAVE JUST TOLD THESE PEOPLE,
THESE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT 

05:30:36.918 --> 05:30:38.549
SOMEBODY HAS STOLEN YOUR 
ELECTION, VICTORY, YOU'RE NOT 

05:30:38.550 --> 05:30:40.782
GOING TO GET THE PRESIDENT THAT 
YOU LOVE. SENATORS, THAT IS AND 

05:30:40.983 --> 05:30:42.894
PROBABLY COMBUSTIBLE SITUATION 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE AND THEY HAVE 

05:30:42.895 --> 05:30:45.451
BEEN SAYING THEY ARE MAD AS AND 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT 

05:30:45.651 --> 05:30:47.883
ANYMORE. HE LOOKED OUT TO A SEA 
OF THOUSANDS, SOME WEARING BODY 

05:30:48.098 --> 05:30:49.916
ARMOR, HELMETS, HOLDING STICKS 
AND FLAGPOLES, SOME OF WHICH 

05:30:49.917 --> 05:30:51.949
THEY WOULD LATER USED TO BEAT 
CAPITOL POLICE, AND TOLD THEM 

05:30:52.155 --> 05:30:54.155
THAT THEY COULD PLAY BY 
DIFFERENT RULES. PLAY BY 

05:30:54.544 --> 05:30:57.032
DIFFERENT RULES. HE EVEN AT ONE 
POINT, QUITE LITERALLY, POINTED 

05:30:57.263 --> 05:31:03.329
TO THE CAPITOL AS HE TOLD THEM 
TO FIGHT LIKE . AFTER THE 

05:31:03.532 --> 05:31:06.118
ATTACK, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SHOWN 
CLEARLY THAT ONCE THE ATTACK 

05:31:06.303 --> 05:31:09.983
BEGAN TO INSURGENTS AFTER 
INSURGENT MADE CLEAR

05:31:13.900 --> 05:31:15.966
THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE 
PRESIDENT'S ORDERS. YOU SAW US 

05:31:16.160 --> 05:31:18.160
PRESENT THAT EVIDENCE OF THE 
INSURGENTS WHO WERE THERE THAT 

05:31:18.191 --> 05:31:20.506
IS A WHO SAID THEY CAME BECAUSE 
OF THE PRESIDENT ASKED THEM TO 

05:31:20.693 --> 05:31:23.386
COME. I WAS HERE AT HIS 
INVITATION. YOU SAW THAT OF THE 

05:31:23.573 --> 05:31:26.488
FOLKS THAT WERE IN THE CAPITOL 
THAT DAY. 

05:31:26.489 --> 05:31:28.489
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TIME HAS EXPIRED.

05:31:32.374 --> 05:31:34.629
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ARE THERE FOR THE QUESTIONS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT.

05:31:39.887 --> 05:31:41.887
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR

05:31:49.433 --> 05:31:51.433
SAYS: HAVE A QUESTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIKE YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 

05:31:51.467 --> 05:31:53.701
PRESIDENT. I SENT A QUESTION TO 
THE DESK ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, 

05:31:53.900 --> 05:31:55.900
SENATOR CRUZ, MARSHALL, AND 
KRAMER TO COUNSEL.

05:32:10.574 --> 05:32:12.394
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR GRANDMA FOR HIMSELF, 
SENATOR CRUZ WAS COMMERCIAL, 

05:32:12.395 --> 05:32:17.464
SENATOR KRAMER SUBMITS A 
QUESTION FOR THE COUNCIL FOR 

05:32:18.215 --> 05:32:21.885
DONALD TRUMP. THE CLERK WILL 
READ IT.

05:32:29.457 --> 05:32:31.842
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HAS A POLITICIAN RAISING BILL
FOR LETTERS ENCOURAGE MORE 

05:32:32.040 --> 05:32:39.612
RIOTING? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COUNSEL HAS FIVE MINUTES. 

05:32:40.011 --> 05:32:47.326
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE HAS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS COUNSEL YIELD THE REST 

05:32:47.529 --> 05:32:53.369
OF THEIR TIME? CONSISTING IS 
YIELDED BACK. ARE THERE OTHER 

05:32:53.561 --> 05:32:55.977
QUESTIONS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT

05:32:59.508 --> 05:33:00.725
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM GEORGIA. 

05:33:00.726 --> 05:33:02.560
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
DESK. 

05:33:02.561 --> 05:33:04.561
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SEND IT TO THE TASK.

05:33:20.472 --> 05:33:22.893
THE SENATOR FROM GEORGIA, 
SENATOR

05:33:27.573 --> 05:33:29.857
WARNOCK HAD A QUESTION FOR THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS. THE CLERK WILL 

05:33:30.046 --> 05:33:32.046
REDO THE QUESTION. 

05:33:35.901 --> 05:33:39.104
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS IT TRUE OR FALSE THAT IN 
THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO JANUARY

05:33:39.319 --> 05:33:41.595
6th, DOZENS OF COURTS, INCLUDING
STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN 

05:33:42.358 --> 05:33:46.264
GEORGIA REJECTED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGNS EFFORTS TO 

05:33:47.024 --> 05:33:55.733
OVERTURN HIS LOSS TO JOE BIDEN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOUSE MANAGERS

05:33:59.675 --> 05:34:01.675
RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS, THAT

05:34:01.905 --> 05:34:03.905
IS TRUE. THAT IS TRUE.

05:34:08.403 --> 05:34:10.634
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THOUGH, THAT
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM 

05:34:10.835 --> 05:34:12.744
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVING 
PURSUED HIS BELIEF THAT THE 

05:34:12.745 --> 05:34:14.745
ELECTION WAS BEING STOLEN

05:34:19.783 --> 05:34:21.400
OR THAT THERE WAS FRAUD OR 
CORRUPTION OR 

05:34:21.401 --> 05:34:23.464
UNCONSTITUTIONALITY. WE HAVE NO 
PROBLEM AT ALL WITH HIM GOING TO

05:34:23.650 --> 05:34:26.481
COURT TO DO IT AND HE DID AND HE
LOST IN 61 STRAIGHT CASES IN 

05:34:26.681 --> 05:34:29.608
FEDERAL COURT IN STATE COURT, IN
LOVE WITH COURTS IN THE LAND, IN

05:34:29.803 --> 05:34:31.803
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. HE

05:34:39.278 --> 05:34:41.278
LOST IT. HE LOST IN COURT IN 
PENNSYLVANIA, ARIZONA, GEORGIA, 

05:34:41.311 --> 05:34:43.162
MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, NEVADA, 
WISCONSIN, ALL OF THEM SAID THE 

05:34:43.163 --> 05:34:45.318
SAME THING. THEY COULDN'T FIND 
ANY CORRUPTION, THEY COULDN'T 

05:34:45.509 --> 05:34:47.509
FIND

05:34:50.243 --> 05:34:52.243
ANY FRAUD, CERTAINLY NOTHING 
RISING TO A MATERIAL LEVEL THAT 

05:34:52.291 --> 05:34:54.507
WOULD ALTER THE OUTCOME OF ANY 
OF THE ELECTIONS AND THERE WAS 

05:34:54.721 --> 05:34:56.721
NO UNCONSTITUTIONALITY. THAT IS 
THE AMERICAN SYSTEM. SO IT IS 

05:34:56.752 --> 05:35:01.149
HARD TO IMAGINE HIM CUTTING MORE
DUE PROCESS THAN THAT IN 

05:35:01.338 --> 05:35:04.118
PURSUING WHAT HAS COME TO BE 
KNOWN POPULARLY AS THE BIG LIE, 

05:35:04.311 --> 05:35:07.465
THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THE 
ELECTION WAS BEING STOLEN FROM 

05:35:07.660 --> 05:35:10.806
HIM. WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE
FACT THAT HE WENT TO COURT TO DO

05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:14.975
ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT NOTICE, 
NUMBER ONE, THE BIG LIE WAS 

05:35:15.168 --> 05:35:19.232
REFUTED, DEVASTATED, AND 
DEMOLISHED IN FEDERAL AND STATE 

05:35:19.420 --> 05:35:22.786
COURTS ACROSS THE LAND, 
INCLUDING BY EIGHT JUDGES 

05:35:23.304 --> 05:35:27.249
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP HIMSELF. WE QUOTED EARLIER

05:35:27.444 --> 05:35:30.950
IN THE CASE WHAT HAPPENED IN 
PENNSYLVANIA WHERE U.S. DISTRICT

05:35:31.635 --> 05:35:35.540
COURT JUDGE MATTHEW BRANDT SAID,
"IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COURT

05:35:36.303 --> 05:35:41.440
HAS BEEN PRESENTED RESTRAINED 
LEGAL ARGUMENTS WITHOUT MERIT 

05:35:41.839 --> 05:35:43.839
AND SPECULATIVE ACCUSATIONS

05:35:48.943 --> 05:35:50.775
. IN THE U.S., THIS CANNOT 
JUSTIFY THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT 

05:35:50.776 --> 05:35:53.223
OF A SINGLE FOLDER, LET ALONE 
ALL THE VOTERS OF ITS SIX MOST 

05:35:53.422 --> 05:35:55.039
POPULOUS STATE, OUR PEOPLE, 
LAWS, AND INSTITUTIONS DEMAND 

05:35:55.040 --> 05:35:57.040
MORE." THEN IT WENT UP TO

05:36:01.141 --> 05:36:03.776
A JUDGE WHO IS A 12 APPOINTEE, 
WHO IS PART OF THE APPEALS COURT

05:36:03.986 --> 05:36:06.568
PANEL. HE SAID, "THE CAMPAIGN'S 
CLAIMS HAVE NO MERIT. THE NUMBER

05:36:06.762 --> 05:36:08.762
OF

05:36:16.981 --> 05:36:18.981
BALLOTS IT SPECIFICALLY 
CHALLENGES IS FAR SMALLER THAN 

05:36:19.130 --> 05:36:21.231
THE MARGIN OF VICTORY AND IT 
NEVER CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR THAT 

05:36:21.415 --> 05:36:24.096
ANY VOTES WERE CAST BY ILLEGAL 
VOTERS' WITH MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN

05:36:24.297 --> 05:36:29.309
BALLOTS WOULD BE DRASTIC AND 
UNPRECEDENTED DISENFRANCHISING A

05:36:29.509 --> 05:36:33.032
HUGE SWATHS OF THE ELECTORATE 
AND UPSETTING ON THE DOWN BALLOT

05:36:33.237 --> 05:36:34.849
RACES TOO, WHICH INCIDENTALLY 
WEREN'T BEING CHALLENGED, EVEN 

05:36:34.850 --> 05:36:37.097
THOUGH IT WAS THE EXACT SAME 
BALLOT." SO THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN

05:36:37.314 --> 05:36:39.469
THE PRESIDENT WENT FROM HIS 
JUDICIAL COMBAT, WHICH WAS FINE,

05:36:39.660 --> 05:36:41.962
TOO INTIMIDATING AND BULLYING 
STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS AND 

05:36:42.163 --> 05:36:44.163
STATE LEGISLATORS AND THEN 
FINALLY

05:36:48.068 --> 05:36:50.469
, AS A REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY 
SAID, SUMMONING A MILD, 

05:36:50.904 --> 05:36:53.306
ASSEMBLING A MOMENT, AND 
LIGHTING THE MATCH. FOR AN 

05:36:53.883 --> 05:36:55.883
INSURRECTION AGAINST

05:37:00.856 --> 05:37:02.894
THE UNION. WHEN HE CROSSED OVER 
FROM NONVIOLENT MEANS, NO MATTER

05:37:03.092 --> 05:37:05.124
HOW RIDICULOUS OR ABSURD, THAT 
IS FINE, HE IS EXERCISING HIS 

05:37:05.324 --> 05:37:07.563
RIGHT TO INCITING VIOLENCE. THAT
IS WHAT THIS TRIAL IS ABOUT. WE 

05:37:07.759 --> 05:37:12.438
HEARD VERY LITTLE OF THAT FROM 
THE PRESENTATION OF THE 

05:37:12.638 --> 05:37:14.638
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS. THEY REALLY
DIDN'T ADDRESS THE FACT OF THE 

05:37:14.671 --> 05:37:17.758
CASE AT ALL. THERE WERE A COUPLE
PROPAGANDA RULES ABOUT 

05:37:17.996 --> 05:37:22.788
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS THAT 
WOULD BE EXCLUDED IN ANY COURT 

05:37:23.001 --> 05:37:25.483
IN THE LAND. THEY TALK ABOUT THE
RULES OF EVIDENCE. ALL THAT WAS 

05:37:25.744 --> 05:37:27.787
TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO THE CASE 
BEFORE US. WHATEVER WE THINK 

05:37:28.111 --> 05:37:30.427
ABOUT IT, IT IS IRRELEVANT. WE 
WILL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE 

05:37:30.617 --> 05:37:32.617
FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENTS TOO.

05:37:37.387 --> 05:37:38.903
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM MAINE. 

05:37:38.904 --> 05:37:41.216
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SENT A 
QUESTION TO THE DESK.

05:38:07.275 --> 05:38:09.275
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE QUESTION IS FROM SENATOR 
COLLINS AND SENATOR MURKOWSKI. 

05:38:09.308 --> 05:38:16.079
IT IS FOR THE COUNSEL FOR THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT. CLERK WILL 

05:38:16.757 --> 05:38:18.757
READ. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:38:22.716 --> 05:38:24.716
EXACTLY WHEN DID PRESIDENT TRUMP

05:38:28.404 --> 05:38:30.404
LEARN OF THE BREACH OF THE 
CAPITOL? WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIONS 

05:38:30.428 --> 05:38:35.716
DID HE TAKE TO BRING THE RIOTING
TO AN END AND WHEN DID HE TAKE 

05:38:35.915 --> 05:38:37.915
THEM? PLEASE BE AS DETAILED AS 
POSSIBLE.

05:38:54.204 --> 05:38:56.204
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CAN THE CLERK READ THAT 
QUESTION AGAIN?

05:39:06.392 --> 05:39:09.570
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EXACTLY WHEN DID PRESIDENT 
TRUMP LEARN OF THE BREACH OF THE

05:39:09.757 --> 05:39:11.757
CAPITOL AND WHAT SPECIFIC 
ACTIONS

05:39:18.792 --> 05:39:21.911
DID HE TAKE TO BRING THE RIOTING
TO AN END AND WHEN DID HE TAKE 

05:39:22.278 --> 05:39:23.856
THEM? PLEASE BE AS DETAILED AS 
POSSIBLE. 

05:39:23.857 --> 05:39:25.857
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE GIVEN
US ABSOLUTELY

05:39:31.171 --> 05:39:34.010
NO EVIDENCE TO THAT QUESTION. WE
ARE ABLE TO PIECE TOGETHER A 

05:39:34.332 --> 05:39:37.089
TIMELINE AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY
BACK TO THE DECEMBER 31st, 

05:39:37.820 --> 05:39:42.536
JANUARY 2nd, THERE IS A LOT OF 
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE 

05:39:43.290 --> 05:39:50.482
AUTHORITIES AND GETTING FOLKS TO
HAVE SECURITY BEFORE HAND ON THE

05:39:50.672 --> 05:39:56.711
DAY. WE HAVE A TWEET AT 2:38. IT
WAS CERTAINLY SOMETIME BEFORE 

05:39:56.898 --> 05:39:58.898
THEN

05:40:01.096 --> 05:40:03.096
WITH THE RUSH TO BRING THIS 
IMPEACHMENT, THERE HAS BEEN 

05:40:03.225 --> 05:40:06.669
ABSOLUTELY NO INVESTIGATION INTO
THAT. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH 

05:40:06.867 --> 05:40:12.742
THIS ENTIRE PROCEEDING. THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS DID ZERO 

05:40:12.972 --> 05:40:19.506
INVESTIGATION AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE DESERVE A LOT BETTER THAN

05:40:19.720 --> 05:40:24.925
COMING IN HERE WITH NO EVIDENCE,
HEARSAY ON TOP OF HEARSAY

05:40:27.435 --> 05:40:29.435
OF THE PORTS THAT ARE OF 
HEARSAY.

05:40:36.174 --> 05:40:38.174
DUE PROCESS IS REQUIRED HERE. 
THAT WAS DENIED.

05:40:45.517 --> 05:40:47.517
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT.

05:40:51.811 --> 05:40:53.842
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM NEVADA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SEND A 

05:40:54.045 --> 05:40:56.045
QUESTION TO THE DESK.

05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:18.390
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM NEVADA, 
SENATOR ROSEN

05:41:21.674 --> 05:41:24.649
SUBMITS A QUESTION FOR THE HOUSE
MANAGERS

05:41:31.420 --> 05:41:33.420
. THE CLERK WILL READ IT.

05:41:40.153 --> 05:41:46.250
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ON JANUARY 6th, THE 
ANTI-SOMATIC PROUD BOYS GROUP 

05:41:46.651 --> 05:41:49.709
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TOLD TO
STANDBY LAID SIEGE TO THE 

05:41:50.464 --> 05:41:55.794
CAPITOL ALONGSIDE OTHER RIOTERS,
INCLUDING ONE WEARING A CAMP ARE

05:41:56.553 --> 05:41:58.553
SWEATS SHIRT

05:42:00.663 --> 05:42:02.663
. IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW OR SHOULD 

05:42:02.820 --> 05:42:06.886
HAVE KNOWN THAT HIS TOLERANCE OF
ANTI-SOMATIC SPEECH, HATE SPEECH

05:42:11.022 --> 05:42:13.268
, COMBINED WITH HIS OWN RHETORIC
COULD INCITE TO THE KIND OF 

05:42:13.460 --> 05:42:15.460
VIOLENCE WE SAW ON JANUARY 6th?

05:42:31.071 --> 05:42:33.071
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:42:34.582 --> 05:42:36.775
MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS, DONALD 
TRUMP HAS A LONG HISTORY

05:42:40.892 --> 05:42:42.892
OF APPRAISING AND ENCOURAGING 
VIOLENCE, AS USUAL. HE HAS 

05:42:42.911 --> 05:42:45.558
ESPOUSED HATEFUL RHETORIC 
HIMSELF. HE HAS NOT JUST 

05:42:45.759 --> 05:42:48.605
TOLERATED IT BUT HE HAS 
ENCOURAGED HATEFUL SPEECH BY 

05:42:48.806 --> 05:42:52.677
OTHERS. HE HAS REFUSED, AS YOU 
SAW IN THE SEPTEMBER DEBATE, 

05:42:52.871 --> 05:42:57.703
THAT INTERVIEW, TO CONDEMN 
EXTREMIST AND WHITE SUPREME 

05:42:57.915 --> 05:43:00.388
ASSIST GROUPS LIKE THE PROUD 
BOYS. HE HAS HAD EVERY 

05:43:00.590 --> 05:43:04.654
OPPORTUNITY ENCOURAGED AND 
CULTIVATED ACTUAL VIOLENCE BY 

05:43:05.411 --> 05:43:10.739
THESE GROUPS. YES, HE HAS 
ENCOURAGED ACTUAL VIOLENCE, NOT 

05:43:10.952 --> 05:43:17.282
JUST THE WORD FIGHT. HE TOLD 
GROUPS LIKE THE PROUD BOYS, WHO 

05:43:17.477 --> 05:43:19.837
HAD BEATEN PEOPLE WITH BASEBALL 
BATS TO STANDBY. WHEN HIS 

05:43:20.038 --> 05:43:25.779
SUPPORTERS IN THE 50 CAR CARAVAN
TRIED TO DRIVE A BUS OF BIDEN 

05:43:25.985 --> 05:43:30.038
CAMPAIGN WORKERS OF THE WORLD, 
HE TWEETED A VIDEO OF THAT 

05:43:30.239 --> 05:43:32.239
INCIDENT WITH FIGHT MUSIC 
ATTACHED TO IT"

05:43:37.564 --> 05:43:39.765
, "I LOVE TEXAS." WHEN HIS 
SUPPORTERS AND DEATH THREATS TO 

05:43:39.956 --> 05:43:41.956
THE REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF 
STATE IN GEORGIA, HE RESPONDED 

05:43:42.180 --> 05:43:44.399
BY CALLING MR.

05:43:49.343 --> 05:43:51.575
RAFFENSBERGER AN ENEMY OF THE 
STATE AFTER HE KNEW OF THOSE  

05:43:52.118 --> 05:43:56.179
DEATH THREATS. ON THE MORNING OF
THE SECOND MILLION MAGA MARCH 

05:44:02.952 --> 05:44:04.985
ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE AND BURNED 
TUTORS, HE BEGAN THE DAY WITH 

05:44:05.185 --> 05:44:09.241
THE TREAT, "WE HAVE JUST BEGUN 
TO FIGHT." I WANT TO BE CLEAR 

05:44:09.452 --> 05:44:11.452
THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ON 
TRIAL FOR THOSE STATEMENTS. 

05:44:11.494 --> 05:44:14.321
HOWEVER, THAT HATEFUL, VIOLENT 
AND INAPPROPRIATE THEY MAY BE. 

05:44:14.723 --> 05:44:16.715
BUT HIS STATEMENTS, THE 
PRESIDENT'S STATEMENTS MAKE 

05:44:16.716 --> 05:44:19.340
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THREE IMPORTANT
POINTS FOR OUR CASE. FIRST

05:44:23.053 --> 05:44:25.087
, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A PATTERN 
AND PRACTICE OF PRAISING AND 

05:44:25.852 --> 05:44:27.852
ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE

05:44:33.623 --> 05:44:35.853
, NEVER CONDEMNING IT. IT IS NOT
A COINCIDENCE THAT THOSE VERY 

05:44:36.054 --> 05:44:37.900
SAME PEOPLE, PROUD BOYS, 
ORGANIZERS OF THE TRUMP CARAVAN,

05:44:37.901 --> 05:44:39.901
SUPPORTERS AND SPEAKERS OF THE 
SECOND MILLION MAGA MARCH ALSO 

05:44:39.920 --> 05:44:43.162
UP ON JANUARY 6th  TWO AN EVENT 
THAT HE HAD ORGANIZED

05:44:47.639 --> 05:44:49.470
WITH THOSE SAME INDIVIDUALS WHO 
HAD ORGANIZED THAT VIOLENT 

05:44:49.471 --> 05:44:53.735
ATTACK. SECOND, HIS BEHAVIOR IS 
DIFFERENT. IT IS NOT JUST THAT 

05:44:53.935 --> 05:44:58.777
IT WAS A COMMENT BY AN OFFICIAL 
TO FIGHT FOR A CAUSE FOR THIS IS

05:44:58.968 --> 05:45:05.922
MONTHS OF CULTIVATING A BASE OF 
PEOPLE WHO WERE VIOLENT, NOT 

05:45:06.121 --> 05:45:09.771
POTENTIALLY VIOLENT, BUT WERE 
VIOLENT. AND THAT THE PRIOR 

05:45:09.986 --> 05:45:13.637
CONDUCT OF BOTH HELPED HIM 
CULTIVATE THE VERY GROUP OF 

05:45:13.838 --> 05:45:17.837
PEOPLE THAT ATTACKED US BUT IT 
ALSO SHOWS CLEARLY THAT HE HAD 

05:45:18.104 --> 05:45:22.289
THAT GROUP ASSEMBLED AND ALL THE

05:45:28.062 --> 05:45:30.062
PUBLIC REPORTS READY TO ATTACK, 
HE DOES BRUTALLY ENCOURAGE THEM 

05:45:30.113 --> 05:45:32.115
TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE ON JANUARY
6th. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD SPENT 

05:45:32.352 --> 05:45:38.013
MONTHS CALLING HIS SUPPORTERS TO
A MARCH ON A SPECIFIC DAY, AT A 

05:45:38.211 --> 05:45:41.007
SPECIFIC TIME, FOR A SPECIFIC 
PURPOSE

05:45:44.309 --> 05:45:47.304
. WHAT ELSE WERE THEY GOING TO 
DO TO STOP THE CERTIFICATION OF 

05:45:47.515 --> 05:45:56.088
THE ELECTION ON THAT DAY BUT TO 
STOP YOU? BUT TO STOP 

05:45:57.041 --> 05:45:59.041
PHYSICALLY.

05:46:01.369 --> 05:46:03.200
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY, 
PARTICULARLY AFTER HIS VICE 

05:46:03.201 --> 05:46:05.432
PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WOULD 
REFUSE TO DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

05:46:05.634 --> 05:46:11.868
ASKED. THE POINT IS THIS. BY THE
TIME YOU CALL THE CAVALRY

05:46:19.244 --> 05:46:21.477
OF HIS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS 
ON JANUARY 6th, AN EVENT HE HAD 

05:46:21.678 --> 05:46:24.676
INVITED THEM TO, HE HAD EVERY 
REASON TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE 

05:46:24.864 --> 05:46:29.943
ARMED, VIOLENT, AND READY TO 
ACTUALLY FIGHT.

05:46:32.601 --> 05:46:36.919
WAS CALLING AND THE VIOLENCE 
THEY WERE CAPABLE OF. HE STILL 

05:46:37.120 --> 05:46:39.901
GAVE HIS MARCHING ORDERS TO GO 
TO THE CAPITOL AND

05:46:43.218 --> 05:46:48.453
,  "FIGHT LIKE TO STOP THE STEAL
." HOW ELSE WAS THAT GOING TO 

05:46:48.641 --> 05:46:52.967
HAPPEN? IF THEY HAD STAYED AT 
THE ELLIPSE, MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE

05:46:53.736 --> 05:46:59.266
JUST BEEN TO FIGHT IN PROTEST 
WITH THEIR WORDS. BUT TO COME TO

05:46:59.467 --> 05:47:02.283
THE CAPITOL? THAT IS WHY THIS IS
DIFFERENT AND THAT IS WHY HE 

05:47:02.470 --> 05:47:04.470
MUST BE CONVICTED AND

05:47:08.800 --> 05:47:11.194
ACQUITTED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DISQUALIFIED. 

05:47:11.195 --> 05:47:13.415
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND DISQUALIFIED.

05:47:20.383 --> 05:47:22.383
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT.

05:47:27.084 --> 05:47:29.115
ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SCOTT OF 
SOUTH CAROLINA AND MYSELF, WE 

05:47:29.329 --> 05:47:31.220
WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT A QUESTION 
TO THE DESK. 

05:47:31.221 --> 05:47:33.221
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE SO
SUBMITTED.

05:47:58.715 --> 05:48:04.668
THE QUESTION IS FOR COUNSEL FOR 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT FROM 

05:48:05.428 --> 05:48:11.781
SENATORS HAGGERTY AND SCOTT OF 
SOUTH CAROLINA. THE CLERK WILL 

05:48:11.987 --> 05:48:13.987
READ THE QUESTION.

05:48:19.494 --> 05:48:24.374
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GIVEN THAT MORE THAN 200 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR 

05:48:24.577 --> 05:48:26.577
THEIR CONDUCT AT THE CAPITOL ON 
JANUARY 6th

05:48:33.508 --> 05:48:35.542
, THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS 
WORKING TO HOLD THE APPROPRIATE 

05:48:35.742 --> 05:48:37.742
PERSONS ACCOUNTABLE, AND THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NO LONGER IN 

05:48:37.777 --> 05:48:40.621
OFFICE ISN'T THIS SIMPLY A 
LITTLE SHOW TRIAL THAT IS 

05:48:40.821 --> 05:48:45.904
DESIGNED TO DISCREDIT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND HIS POLICIES AND SHAME

05:48:46.104 --> 05:48:48.475
THE 74 MILLION AMERICANS WHO 
VOTED FOR HIM?

05:49:04.391 --> 05:49:06.422
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SENATORS FOR THAT 
QUESTION. THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT

05:49:06.623 --> 05:49:11.289
THE 45th PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT
THE SCATTERING IS ABOUT. WE 

05:49:11.491 --> 05:49:14.795
BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER AND 
TRUST THAT THE FEDERAL 

05:49:14.984 --> 05:49:19.419
AUTHORITIES THAT ARE CONDUCTING 
INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS 

05:49:19.821 --> 05:49:21.451
AGAINST THE CRIMINALS THAT 
INVADED THIS BUILDING WILL 

05:49:21.452 --> 05:49:23.485
CONTINUE THEIR WORK AND BE AS 
AGGRESSIVE AND THOROUGH AS WE 

05:49:23.686 --> 05:49:28.302
KNOW THEM TO ALWAYS BE AND THAT 
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY 

05:49:28.490 --> 05:49:32.216
THOSE THAT ENTERED THE INNER 
SANCTUM OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND 

05:49:32.980 --> 05:49:38.256
DESECRATED IT. THE 44th 
PRESIDENT NO LONGER HOLDS OFFICE

05:49:38.516 --> 05:49:40.696
. THERE IS NO SANCTION AVAILABLE

05:49:44.612 --> 05:49:47.045
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, IN OUR 
VIEW, FOR HIM TO BE REMOVED FROM

05:49:47.246 --> 05:49:52.114
OFFICE THAT HE NO LONGER HOLDS. 
THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS 

05:49:52.327 --> 05:49:54.965
THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS 
GATHERING IS TO EMBARRASS THE 

05:49:55.576 --> 05:49:59.860
45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND IN SOME WAY TRY TO 

05:50:00.052 --> 05:50:02.817
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
SENATORS TO SUGGEST

05:50:09.995 --> 05:50:12.431
THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED 
TO HOLD OFFICE IN THE FUTURE, OR

05:50:12.633 --> 05:50:14.664
AT THE VERY LEAST, PUBLICIZE 
THIS THROUGHOUT THE LAND TO TRY 

05:50:14.864 --> 05:50:18.038
TO DAMAGE HIS ABILITY TO RUN FOR
OFFICE WHEN, AND IF HE IS 

05:50:18.226 --> 05:50:22.992
ACQUITTED. AT THE SAME TIME, 
TELL THE 74 MILLION PEOPLE WHO 

05:50:23.757 --> 05:50:26.994
VOTED FOR HIM THAT THEIR CHOICE 
WAS THE WRONG CHOICE.

05:50:30.920 --> 05:50:32.991
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A 
DIVISIVE WAY OF GOING ABOUT 

05:50:33.695 --> 05:50:39.040
HANDLING IMPEACHMENT AND IT 
DENIGRATES THE GREAT SOLEMNITY 

05:50:39.240 --> 05:50:42.393
THAT SHOULD ATTACH TO SUCH 
PROCEEDINGS. I YIELD THE 

05:50:42.579 --> 05:50:44.579
REMAINDER OF MY TIME, AS MR. 
PRESIDENT.

05:50:55.898 --> 05:50:57.326
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. 

05:50:57.327 --> 05:51:00.363
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SENT A 
QUESTION TO THE DESK FOR THE 

05:51:00.578 --> 05:51:06.348
HOUSE MANAGERS BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS DID NOT 

05:51:06.538 --> 05:51:08.645
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR WILL SEND THE 

05:51:08.832 --> 05:51:11.055
QUESTION. DEBATE IS NOT ALLOWED.

05:51:31.452 --> 05:51:38.898
THE QUESTION IS FROM SENATOR 
MARKEY WITH SENATOR DUCKWORTH . 

05:51:39.091 --> 05:51:45.411
THE CLERK WILL READ THE 
QUESTION. 

05:51:45.412 --> 05:51:48.249
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EXACTLY WHEN DID THE 
PRESIDENT

05:51:52.160 --> 05:51:54.474
LEARN OF THE BREACH AT THE 
CAPITOL AND WHAT STEPS DID HE 

05:51:54.664 --> 05:51:57.399
TAKE TO ADDRESS THE VIOLENCE? 
PLEASE BE AS DETAILED AS 

05:51:57.593 --> 05:51:59.593
POSSIBLE.

05:52:32.733 --> 05:52:35.574
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DO YOU WISH TO RESPOND?

05:52:59.408 --> 05:53:06.507
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS, THIS
ATTACK WAS ON LIVE TV, ON ALL 

05:53:06.711 --> 05:53:08.711
MAJOR NETWORKS IN REAL TIME. THE
PRESIDENT

05:53:13.219 --> 05:53:14.902
, AS PRESIDENT, HAS ACCESS TO 
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION, 

05:53:14.903 --> 05:53:16.673
INCLUDING REPORTS FROM INSIDE 
THE CAPITOL. HE KNEW THE 

05:53:16.674 --> 05:53:18.674
VIOLENCE THAT WAS UNDERWAY

05:53:20.937 --> 05:53:22.969
. HE KNEW THE SEVERITY OF THE 
THREATS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, 

05:53:23.370 --> 05:53:25.970
HE KNEW THAT CAPITOL POLICE WERE
OVERWHELMINGLY OUTNUMBERED AND 

05:53:26.161 --> 05:53:29.468
IN A FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES 
AGAINST THOUSANDS OF INSURGENTS 

05:53:30.225 --> 05:53:35.912
WITH WEAPONS. WE KNOW HE KNEW 
THAT WE KNOW THAT HE DID NOT 

05:53:36.103 --> 05:53:41.650
SEND ANY INDIVIDUALS, WE DID NOT
HEAR ANY TWEETS, WE DID NOT HEAR

05:53:41.865 --> 05:53:48.898
HIM TELL THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO 
STOP, THIS IS WRONG. YOU MUST GO

05:53:49.104 --> 05:53:51.773
BACK. WE DID NOT HEAR THAT.

05:53:56.076 --> 05:53:58.714
WHAT ELSE DID THE PRESIDENT DO? 
WE ARE UNCLEAR. WE. LEAVE IT WAS

05:53:58.930 --> 05:54:04.204
A DERELICTION OF HIS DUTY AND 
THAT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE 

05:54:04.405 --> 05:54:07.602
WHO HAD CAUSED THEM TO COME TO 
THE CAPITOL AND THEY WERE DOING 

05:54:07.790 --> 05:54:09.790
WITH

05:54:12.321 --> 05:54:14.967
HE ASKED THEM TO DO. THERE WAS 
NO NEED FOR HIM TO STOP THEM 

05:54:15.168 --> 05:54:17.538
FROM WHAT THEY WERE ENGAGED IN. 
ONE OF THE THINGS

05:54:24.505 --> 05:54:27.247
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK, WE STILL 
HAVE NOT HEARD HIM POST TO ALL 

05:54:27.449 --> 05:54:29.388
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED 
BY MINIATURE RASKIN IN HIS 

05:54:29.389 --> 05:54:31.959
CLOSING ARGUMENT  WHY DID THE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT TELL THE 

05:54:32.147 --> 05:54:34.874
PROTESTERS TO STOP AS SOON AS HE
LEARNED ABOUT IT? WHY DID 

05:54:35.073 --> 05:54:39.742
PRESIDENT TRUMP DO NOTHING TO 
STOP THE ATTACK FOR TWO HOURS 

05:54:40.156 --> 05:54:42.286
AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN? WHY DID 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DO NOTHING TO 

05:54:42.475 --> 05:54:45.183
HELP PROTECT THE CAPITOL? AND 
WORKFORCE MEANT BATTLING THE 

05:54:45.378 --> 05:54:50.921
INSURGENTS? YOU SAW THE BODY CAM
OF A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER AT 4

05:54:51.685 --> 05:54:57.205
RECORDED IN 4:29 STILL FIGHTING.
4:49

05:55:04.736 --> 05:55:06.966
PERCENT WHAT TIME? 1:00, 2:00 IN
THE AFTERNOON. WHY DID HE NOT 

05:55:07.166 --> 05:55:09.166
CONDEMN THE VIOLENT INSURRECTION
ON JANUARY 6th? THOSE ARE THE 

05:55:09.209 --> 05:55:11.617
QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE AS WELL. 
THE REASON THIS QUESTION KEEPS 

05:55:12.193 --> 05:55:14.412
COMING UP IS BECAUSE THE ANSWER 
IS NOTHING.

05:55:27.276 --> 05:55:28.905
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM UTAH. 

05:55:28.906 --> 05:55:30.906
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SEND A QUESTION TO THE 
DESK.

05:55:43.473 --> 05:55:49.823
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM UTAH, MR. 
ROMNEY ON BEHALF 

05:55:51.868 --> 05:55:53.868
SENATOR COLLINS

05:55:56.936 --> 05:55:58.936
SUBMITS A QUESTION

05:56:01.600 --> 05:56:03.600
AND THE CLERK WILL READ IT.

05:56:12.163 --> 05:56:15.275
AND I APOLOGIZE. THE QUESTION IS
FOR BOTH SIDES THE TIME WILL BE 

05:56:15.466 --> 05:56:17.466
EVENLY DIVIDED.

05:56:23.139 --> 05:56:26.919
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AND 
THE DISPIRITING

05:56:31.876 --> 05:56:33.876
TWEET AT 2:24 P.M. REGARDING 
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, WAS HE 

05:56:33.924 --> 05:56:37.391
AWARE THAT VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SENATE

05:56:37.578 --> 05:56:40.151
BY THE SECRET SERVICE FOR HIS 
SAFETY?

05:56:46.907 --> 05:56:48.907
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGER.

05:56:52.589 --> 05:56:55.772
TIME WILL BE EVENLY DIVIDED 
BETWEEN. 

05:56:55.773 --> 05:56:57.773
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:57:00.516 --> 05:57:02.516
CAN THE QUESTION. AGAIN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OF COURSE, WHAT THE CLERK 

05:57:02.693 --> 05:57:04.693
READ THE QUESTION AGAIN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN PRESIDENT

05:57:08.832 --> 05:57:10.735
TRUMP'S AND THE DISPIRITING 
TWEET AT 2:24 P.M. REGARDING 

05:57:10.736 --> 05:57:14.732
VICE PRESIDENT PENS, WAS HE 
AWARE THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT 

05:57:14.934 --> 05:57:18.742
HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SENATE
BY THE SECRET SERVICE FOR HIS 

05:57:18.933 --> 05:57:20.933
SAFETY?

05:57:23.625 --> 05:57:25.625
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:57:27.734 --> 05:57:29.562
THE HOUSE MANAGERS ARE 
RECOGNIZED FOR 2 1/2 MINUTES. 

05:57:29.563 --> 05:57:34.164
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. LET ME TELL YOU 
WHAT HE SAID AT 2:24 P.M. HE 

05:57:34.355 --> 05:57:38.899
SAID MIKE PENCE DIDN'T HAVE THE 
COURAGE TO DO WHAT IT SHOULD 

05:57:39.112 --> 05:57:41.485
HAVE BEEN DONE TO PROTECT OUR 
COUNTRY AND OUR CONSTITUTION.

05:57:51.296 --> 05:57:53.731
THE USA DEMAND THE TRUTH. YOU 
KNOW BY NOW WHAT WAS ALL OVER 

05:57:53.931 --> 05:57:56.170
THE MEDIA, YOU CAN'T TURN ON THE
TELEVISION, COULDN'T TURN ON THE

05:57:56.366 --> 05:57:58.213
RADIO, COULDN'T CONSUME ANY 
MEDIUM OR PROBABLY TAKE ANY 

05:57:58.214 --> 05:58:00.214
PHONE CALLS OR ANYTHING ELSE 
WITHOUT HEARING ABOUT THIS AND 

05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:02.230
ALSO HEARING ABOUT THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. HERE IS WHAT DONALD 

05:58:02.264 --> 05:58:04.697
TRUMP HAD TO KNOW AT THAT TIME 
BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW IT.

05:58:04.897 --> 05:58:06.897
ALL OF US KNEW IT.

05:58:10.180 --> 05:58:12.048
LIVE TELEVISION HAD, BY THIS 
POINT, SHOWING THAT THE 

05:58:12.049 --> 05:58:14.044
INSURGENTS WERE ALREADY INSIDE 
THE BUILDING AND THAT THEY HAD 

05:58:14.045 --> 05:58:16.082
WEAPONS AND THAT THE POLICE WERE
OUTNUMBERED. HERE ARE THE FACTS 

05:58:16.278 --> 05:58:19.173
THAT ARE NOT IN DISPUTE. DONALD 
TRUMP HAD NOT TAKEN ANY MEASURES

05:58:19.362 --> 05:58:21.362
TO SEND HELP TO THE OVERWHELMED 
CAPITOL POLICE.

05:58:27.658 --> 05:58:29.890
AS PRESIDENT, AT THAT POINT, 
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THIS GOING ON 

05:58:30.091 --> 05:58:32.420
AND THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU ARE 
IMPLORING YOU TO DO SOMETHING 

05:58:32.609 --> 05:58:34.907
AND WERE VICE PRESIDENT IS 
THERE, WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO IT?

05:58:41.259 --> 05:58:43.155
DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT PUBLICLY 
CONDEMNED THE ATTACK. THE 

05:58:43.156 --> 05:58:46.953
ATTACKERS ARE TOLD TO STAND DOWN
, DESPITE THE POLICE TO DO SO, 

05:58:47.156 --> 05:58:49.207
AND DONALD TRUMP HADN'T EVEN 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE ATTACK. AFTER 

05:58:49.395 --> 05:58:52.838
WEDNESDAY'S TRIAL PORTION 
CONCLUDED, SENATOR TURBERVILLE 

05:58:53.039 --> 05:58:57.310
SPOKE TO REPORTERS AND CONFIRMED
THE CALL THAT HE HAD WITH THE 

05:58:57.518 --> 05:59:02.187
PRESIDENT AND DID NOT DISPUTE 
MANAGER CICILLINE'S DESCRIPTION 

05:59:02.395 --> 05:59:05.838
IN ANY WAY THAT THERE WAS A CALL
BETWEEN HE AND THE PRESIDENT  

05:59:06.252 --> 05:59:09.036
AROUND THE TIME THAT MIKE PENCE 
WAS BEING USHERED OUT OF THE 

05:59:09.228 --> 05:59:14.571
CHAMBER. THAT WAS SHORTLY AFTER 
2:00 P.M.. SENATOR TURBERVILLE 

05:59:14.771 --> 05:59:16.808
SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT HE TOLD 
THE PRESIDENT

05:59:23.915 --> 05:59:26.149
, "MR. PRESIDENT, THEY JUST TOOK
THE VICE PRESIDENT OUT. I'VE GOT

05:59:26.349 --> 05:59:30.014
TO GO." THAT WAS SHORTLY AFTER 
2:00 P.M. THERE WERE STILL HOURS

05:59:30.214 --> 05:59:32.247
OF CHAOS AND CARNAGE AND MAYHEM.
VICE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY 

05:59:32.448 --> 05:59:34.552
WERE STILL IN DANGER AT THAT 
POINT. OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF 

05:59:35.241 --> 05:59:37.241
DID NOTHING.

05:59:39.362 --> 05:59:41.362
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT.

05:59:45.648 --> 05:59:53.364
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE ANSWER IS NO. AT NO POINT
WAS THE PRESIDENT INFORMED THE 

05:59:53.663 --> 05:59:55.681
VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN ANY DANGER
BECAUSE THE HOUSE ARREST THROUGH

05:59:55.874 --> 05:59:57.874
THIS IMPEACHMENT IN SEVEN DAYS 
WITH NO EVIDENCE, THERE IS 

05:59:58.045 --> 06:00:00.045
NOTHING AT ALL

06:00:03.333 --> 06:00:05.560
ON THE RECORD ON THIS POINT. 
BECAUSE THE HOUSE FAILED TO DO 

06:00:05.832 --> 06:00:07.796
EVEN A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DUE 
DILIGENCE. WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

06:00:07.797 --> 06:00:13.278
DID KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A 
VIOLENT, THERE WAS A VIOLENT 

06:00:13.680 --> 06:00:16.867
PACKET HAPPENING AT THE CAPITOL.
THAT IS WHEN HE REPEATEDLY 

06:00:17.055 --> 06:00:23.029
CALLED YOU TWEET INTO YOUR VIDEO
OR THE RIGHTS TO STOP, TO BE 

06:00:23.230 --> 06:00:26.532
PEACEFUL, TO RESPECT CAPITOL 
POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND 

06:00:26.717 --> 06:00:31.311
TO COMMIT NO VIOLENCE AND TO GO 
HOME. TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS AN 

06:00:31.501 --> 06:00:36.900
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT FOR 
INCITEMENT. THIS IS NOT AN 

06:00:37.088 --> 06:00:39.088
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT FOR 
ANYTHING ELSE

06:00:41.709 --> 06:00:43.956
. IT IS A ONE COUNT. THEY COULD 
HAVE CHARGED ANYTHING THEY 

06:00:44.155 --> 06:00:46.155
WANTED. THEY CHOSE TO CHARGE 
INCITEMENT.

06:00:49.840 --> 06:00:51.840
SO THE QUESTION, ALTHOUGH 
ENTERED DIRECTLY NO, IT IS NOT 

06:00:52.433 --> 06:00:57.900
REALLY RELEVANT TO THE CHARGES 
FOR THE IMPEACHMENT IN THIS CASE

06:00:59.585 --> 06:01:03.401
. I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP ONE 
MORE THING. MR. CASTRO, IN HIS 

06:01:03.594 --> 06:01:07.834
FIRST ANSWER, MAY HAVE SPOKE BUT
WHAT HE SAID WAS

06:01:11.580 --> 06:01:13.815
MR. TRUMP HEADSET FIGHT TO THE 
DEATH. THAT IS FALSE. I AM 

06:01:14.017 --> 06:01:19.440
HOPING HE MISSPOKE. THANK YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. 

06:01:22.560 --> 06:01:24.560
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:01:27.016 --> 06:01:29.016
THE SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, ON BEHALF OF 

06:01:29.047 --> 06:01:33.258
MYSELF AND SENATORS CASEY AND 
BROWN, I SEND A QUESTION TO THE 

06:01:33.452 --> 06:01:35.452
DESK.

06:02:11.496 --> 06:02:13.122
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE QUESTION FROM SENATOR 
CLEVENGER, SENATOR CASEY, 

06:02:13.123 --> 06:02:15.497
SENATOR BROWN TO THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS. THE CLERK WILL REPORT.

06:02:23.487 --> 06:02:27.336
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN PRESENTING YOUR CASE, YOU 
RELIED ON PAST PRESIDENTS FROM 

06:02:27.549 --> 06:02:34.198
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS SUCH AS 
WILLIAM BELKNAP'S 

06:02:37.085 --> 06:02:40.549
IF WE DO NOT CONVICT FORMER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHAT MESSAGE 

06:02:40.949 --> 06:02:44.409
WILL BE PRESENTING TO FUTURE 
PRESIDENTS AND CONGRESSES?

06:03:10.206 --> 06:03:13.048
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP ENGAGED IN A 
COURSE OF CONDUCT THAT INCITED 

06:03:13.450 --> 06:03:16.701
AN ARMED ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. 
HE DID SO WHILE SEEKING TO 

06:03:16.908 --> 06:03:20.311
OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE 
ELECTION AND THWART THE TRANSFER

06:03:20.650 --> 06:03:26.375
OF POWER. WHEN THE ATTACK BEGAN,
HE FURTHER INCITED VIOLENCE 

06:03:26.562 --> 06:03:28.562
AIMED TO HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT,
EVEN AS

06:03:31.932 --> 06:03:35.598
DEMONSTRATED HIS STATE OF MIND 
BY FAILING TO DEFEND US AND THE 

06:03:35.798 --> 06:03:38.641
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO 
PROTECT US. THE CONSEQUENCES OF 

06:03:38.848 --> 06:03:41.009
HIS CONDUCT WERE DEVASTATING ON 
EVERY LEVEL.

06:03:46.764 --> 06:03:47.979
POLICE OFFICERS WERE LEFT 
OVERWHELMED, UNPROTECTED, 

06:03:47.980 --> 06:03:52.664
CONGRESS HAD TO BE EVACUATED, 
OUR STAFF BARRICADED IN THIS 

06:03:52.861 --> 06:03:55.428
BUILDING, CALLING THEIR FAMILIES
TO SAY GOODBYE. SOME OF US, LIKE

06:03:56.514 --> 06:04:00.526
MR. RASKIN HAD CHILDREN HERE  
AND THESE PEOPLE IN THIS 

06:04:00.711 --> 06:04:05.859
BUILDING, SOME OF THEM WERE ON 
THE FBI WATCH LIST, TOOK PHOTOS,

06:04:06.617 --> 06:04:11.345
STOLE LAPTOPS, DESTROYED 
PRECIOUS STATUES INCLUDING ONE 

06:04:11.552 --> 06:04:17.646
OF JOHN LEWIS. DESECRATED THE 
STATUE OF A RECENTLY DECEASED 

06:04:17.839 --> 06:04:25.566
MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO STOOD FOR
NONVIOLENCE. THIS WAS 

06:04:25.767 --> 06:04:31.183
DEVASTATING AND THE WORLD 
WATCHED US AND THE WORLD IS 

06:04:31.373 --> 06:04:33.373
STILL WATCHING US.

06:04:37.349 --> 06:04:39.982
THEY ARE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT WE
WILL DO THIS DAY AND WILL KNOW 

06:04:40.183 --> 06:04:46.070
WHAT WE DID THIS DAY 100 YEARS 
FROM NOW. THOSE ARE THE 

06:04:46.834 --> 06:04:50.489
IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES AND OUR 
ACTIONS WILL REVERBERATE

06:04:57.449 --> 06:04:59.449
AS TO WHAT ARE THE FUTURE 
CONSEQUENT US. THE EXTREMISTS 

06:04:59.520 --> 06:05:01.514
WHO ATTACKED THE CAPITOL AT THE 
PRESIDENTS PROVOCATION WILL BE 

06:05:01.515 --> 06:05:05.980
EMBOLDENED. ALL OUR INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES HAVE CONFIRMED THIS. IT

06:05:06.180 --> 06:05:08.946
IS NOT HOUSE MANAGERS SAYING 
THAT. THERE ARE QUITE LITERALLY 

06:05:09.595 --> 06:05:15.475
STANDING BY AND STANDING READY. 
DONALD TRUMP TOLD THEM

06:05:16.761 --> 06:05:22.031
ONLY THE BEGINNING. THEY ARE 
WAITING AND WATCHING TO SEE IF 

06:05:22.232 --> 06:05:26.445
DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT THAT 
EVERYONE SAID THIS WAS TOTALLY 

06:05:26.631 --> 06:05:31.578
APPROPRIATE. LET ME ALSO BRING 
SOMETHING ELSE UP. I WILL 

06:05:31.787 --> 06:05:38.689
BRIEFLY SAY THAT THE DEFENSE 
COUNSEL'S PUT A LOT OF VIDEOS 

06:05:38.890 --> 06:05:45.526
OUT IN THEIR DEFENSE, PLANE CLIP
AFTER CLIP OF BLACK WOMEN

06:05:49.042 --> 06:05:52.042
TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING FOR A 
CAUSE OR AN ISSUE OR A POLICY. 

06:05:52.232 --> 06:05:55.752
IT WAS NOT LOST ON ME THAT SO 
MANY OF THEM WERE PEOPLE OF 

06:05:55.952 --> 06:06:02.449
COLOR AND WOMEN, BLACK WOMEN. 
BLACK WOMEN LIKE MYSELF, WHO ARE

06:06:02.651 --> 06:06:06.649
SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND
TIRED FOR OUR CHILDREN. YOUR 

06:06:06.840 --> 06:06:12.812
CHILDREN. OUR CHILDREN. THIS 
SUMMER, THINGS HAPPENED THAT 

06:06:13.215 --> 06:06:18.694
WERE VIOLENT BUT THEY WERE ALSO 
THINGS THAT GAVE SOME OF US 

06:06:18.908 --> 06:06:23.174
BLACK WOMEN GREAT COMFORT, 
SEEING AMISH PEOPLE FROM 

06:06:23.374 --> 06:06:25.374
PENNSYLVANIA STANDING UP WITH 
US, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

06:06:32.921 --> 06:06:35.750
SIGNING UP WITH US. I THOUGHT WE
WERE PAST THAT. I THINK MAYBE WE

06:06:35.936 --> 06:06:40.837
ARE NOT. THERE ARE LONG-STANDING
CONSEQUENCES, DECISIONS LIKE 

06:06:41.051 --> 06:06:47.496
THIS THAT WILL BE FINE WHO WE 
ARE AS PEOPLE, AMERICA IS. WE 

06:06:47.710 --> 06:06:49.710
HAVE

06:06:52.231 --> 06:06:54.449
IN THIS ROOM MADE MONUMENT OF 
THE SESSIONS. YOU ALL HAVE MADE 

06:06:55.204 --> 06:06:59.728
MONUMENTAL DECISIONS. WE HAVE 
DECLARED WARS, PAST CIVIL RIGHTS

06:06:59.929 --> 06:07:02.938
ACTS, IN SHORT THAT NO ONE IN 
THIS COUNTRY IS A . EVERY 

06:07:03.129 --> 06:07:05.129
AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE

06:07:08.873 --> 06:07:11.308
, UNLESS YOU LIVE IN A 
TERRITORY. AT THIS TIME, SOME OF

06:07:11.723 --> 06:07:13.723
THESE DECISIONS ARE EVEN 
CONTROVERSIAL.

06:07:16.992 --> 06:07:19.490
HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT THEY 
DEFINE US AS A COUNTRY AND AS A 

06:07:20.200 --> 06:07:26.752
PEOPLE. TODAY IS ONE OF THOSE 
MOMENTS AND HISTORY WILL WAIT 

06:07:27.202 --> 06:07:29.202
FOR OUR DECISION.

06:07:37.102 --> 06:07:38.732
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM UTAH. 

06:07:38.733 --> 06:07:40.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SEND A QUESTION TO THE 
DESK.

06:08:19.960 --> 06:08:22.406
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM UTAH, MR. 
LEE IS A QUESTION ON BEHALF OF 

06:08:22.607 --> 06:08:24.225
HIMSELF, SENATOR HOLLY, SENATOR 
BLACKBURN, SENATOR PORTMAN, AND 

06:08:24.226 --> 06:08:26.258
THE QUESTION IS FOR THE CONSUL 
FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THE 

06:08:26.473 --> 06:08:28.473
CLERK WILL LEAD.

06:08:36.021 --> 06:08:41.902
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MULTIPLE STATE CONSTITUTIONS 
ENACTED PRIOR TO 1787, NAMELY 

06:08:42.104 --> 06:08:46.543
THE CONSTITUTIONS OF DELAWARE, 
VIRGINIA, PENNSYLVANIA, AND 

06:08:46.753 --> 06:08:52.213
VERMONT SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED 
FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF A FORMER 

06:08:52.406 --> 06:08:58.767
OFFICER. GIVEN THAT THE FRAMERS 
OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION WOULD 

06:08:58.966 --> 06:09:02.415
HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THESE 
PROVISIONS, THAT'S THEIR 

06:09:02.827 --> 06:09:05.267
DECISION TO OMIT LANGUAGE 
SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZING THE 

06:09:05.464 --> 06:09:08.450
IMPEACHMENT OF FORMER OFFICIALS 
INDICATE

06:09:12.979 --> 06:09:15.211
THAT THEY DID NOT INTEND FOR OUR
CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW FOR THE 

06:09:15.425 --> 06:09:17.425
IMPEACHMENT OF FORMER OFFICIALS?

06:09:25.174 --> 06:09:27.174
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD QUESTION.

06:09:32.488 --> 06:09:34.721
THE ANSWER IS YES. OF COURSE 
THEY LEFT IT OUT. THE FRAMERS 

06:09:34.922 --> 06:09:37.365
WERE VERY SMART MEN AND THEY 
WENT OVER DRAFT AFTER DRAFT 

06:09:38.117 --> 06:09:44.007
AFTER DRAFT ON THAT DOCUMENT. 
THEY REVIEWED ALL THE OTHER 

06:09:44.196 --> 06:09:48.933
DRAFT OF ALL OF THE STATE 
CONSTITUTIONS. ALL OF THEM. THEY

06:09:49.696 --> 06:09:54.521
PICKED AND CHOSE WHAT THEY 
WANTED AND THEY DISCARDED WHAT 

06:09:54.703 --> 06:09:59.301
THEY DID NOT. WHAT THEY 
DISCARDED 

06:10:03.716 --> 06:10:06.950
OF YOU TO IMPEACH A FORMER

06:10:10.667 --> 06:10:13.060
ELECTED OFFICIAL. I HOPE THAT IS
ANSWERING THE QUESTION. THANK 

06:10:13.335 --> 06:10:16.480
YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT.

06:10:22.661 --> 06:10:24.692
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SEND A 

06:10:24.890 --> 06:10:26.890
QUESTION TO THE DESK.

06:10:51.086 --> 06:10:53.534
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
SUBMIT A QUESTION FOR THE HOUSE 

06:10:53.736 --> 06:10:55.736
MANAGERS THE CLERK WILL BE 
POURED.

06:11:03.483 --> 06:11:06.532
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HAVING BEEN ON THE FRONT 
LINES OF COMBATING THE BIG LIE 

06:11:06.933 --> 06:11:09.714
OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS AS 
CALIFORNIA'S

06:11:14.252 --> 06:11:16.070
CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICER, IT IS 
CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

06:11:16.071 --> 06:11:20.973
PLOT TO UNDERMINE THE 2020 
ELECTION WAS BUILT ON LIES AND 

06:11:21.711 --> 06:11:26.347
CONSPIRACY THEORIES. HOW DID 
THIS PLOT TO UNCONSTITUTIONALLY 

06:11:26.634 --> 06:11:31.063
KEEP PRESIDENT TRUMP AND POWER 
LEAD TO THE RADICALIZATION OF SO

06:11:31.249 --> 06:11:35.982
MANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
FOLLOWERS AND THE RESULTING 

06:11:36.184 --> 06:11:38.184
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL?

06:12:09.293 --> 06:12:11.293
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, DONALD TRUMP SPENT 
MONTHS INCITING HIS BASE TO 

06:12:11.326 --> 06:12:14.575
BELIEVE THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN.
THAT WAS THE POINT, THAT WAS THE

06:12:14.776 --> 06:12:19.925
THING THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE SO 
ANGRY. THINK ABOUT THAT. 

06:12:20.483 --> 06:12:23.424
WOULD TAKE TO GET A LARGE GROUP 
OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS SO 

06:12:23.606 --> 06:12:25.606
ANGRY TO STORM THE CAPITOL.

06:12:30.822 --> 06:12:32.822
THAT WAS THE PURPOSE BEHIND 
DONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT THE 

06:12:32.853 --> 06:12:34.853
ELECTION HAD BEEN RIGGED

06:12:41.186 --> 06:12:43.419
AND THAT THE ELECTION HAD BEEN 
STOLEN. TO BE CLEAR, WHEN HE 

06:12:43.620 --> 06:12:45.865
SAYS THE ELECTION IS STOLEN, 
WHAT HE IS SAYING IS THAT THE 

06:12:46.066 --> 06:12:48.098
VICTORY, AND HE EVEN SAYS ONE 
TIME THE ELECTION VICTORY IS 

06:12:48.300 --> 06:12:52.968
BEING STOLEN FROM THEM. THINK 
ABOUT HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT IS TO

06:12:53.168 --> 06:12:55.202
AMERICANS. AGAIN, YOU ARE RIGHT.
OVER 70 MILLION, I THINK 74 

06:12:55.403 --> 06:12:58.197
MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR DONALD 
TRUMP. THIS WASN'T A ONE OFF 

06:12:58.383 --> 06:13:00.383
COMMENT

06:13:02.316 --> 06:13:04.953
. IT WASN'T ONE TIME. IT WAS 
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER 

06:13:05.153 --> 06:13:07.153
AGAIN. WITH A PURPOSE.

06:13:12.066 --> 06:13:14.499
WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL HERE BECAUSE 

06:13:14.700 --> 06:13:18.698
DONALD TRUMP CONTESTED THE 
ELECTION. AS I SAID DURING THE 

06:13:18.881 --> 06:13:22.628
PRESENTATION, NOBODY HERE WANTS 
TO LOSE AN ELECTION. WE ARE ONE,

06:13:22.829 --> 06:13:24.829
WE ALL WANT TO

06:13:28.721 --> 06:13:30.337
WIN ELECTIONS. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS DIFFERENT. WHAT OUR 

06:13:30.338 --> 06:13:32.572
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF DID WAS THE 
POLAR OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE ARE 

06:13:32.785 --> 06:13:37.853
SUPPOSED TO DO, WE LET THE 
PEOPLE DECIDE THE ELECTIONS, 

06:13:38.069 --> 06:13:43.751
EXCEPT PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE 
DIRECTED ALL OF THAT RATE HE HAD

06:13:44.033 --> 06:13:46.033
INCITED TO JANUARY 6th, THE LAST
CHANCE

06:13:51.669 --> 06:13:53.902
. AGAIN, TO HIM, THIS WAS HIS 
LAST CHANCE, THIS WAS CERTIFYING

06:13:54.172 --> 06:13:58.983
THE ELECTION RESULTS. HE NEEDED 
TO WHIP UP THAT MOB, AND THEN UP

06:13:59.184 --> 06:14:01.429
ENOUGH TO GET OUT THERE AND TRY 
TO STOP THE ELECTION RESULTS. 

06:14:01.631 --> 06:14:04.725
THE CERTIFICATION OF THE 
ELECTION. AND THEY TOOK OVER THE

06:14:04.911 --> 06:14:10.565
SENATE CHAMBER TO DO THAT. THEY 
ALMOST TOOK OVER THE HOUSE 

06:14:10.765 --> 06:14:12.765
CHAMBER. THERE WERE 50

06:14:16.660 --> 06:14:19.094
OR SO OR MORE HOUSE MEMBERS THAT
REALLY SCARED FOR THEIR LIVES UP

06:14:19.294 --> 06:14:24.176
IN THE GALLERY. A WOMAN WHO 
BOUGHT INTO THAT BIG LIE DIED 

06:14:24.577 --> 06:14:28.228
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THE 
PRESIDENTS BIG LIE. THIS 

06:14:28.444 --> 06:14:32.637
RESULTED IN A LOSS OF ONE OF HIS
SUPPORTERS LIVES.

06:14:35.552 --> 06:14:39.128
POLICE OFFICER DIED THAT DAY. 
OTHER OF PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS

06:14:42.657 --> 06:14:45.212
. TWO CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS 
ENDED UP TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES.

06:14:49.155 --> 06:14:51.119
DEFENSE COUNSEL, THEIR DEFENSE 
IS BASICALLY EVERYTHING 

06:14:51.120 --> 06:14:56.868
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID IS OKAY AND 
HE CAN DO IT AGAIN. ISN'T THAT 

06:14:57.081 --> 06:15:04.614
WHAT WE BELIEVE? THAT THERE IS 
NO PROBLEM WITH THAT? THAT IT IS

06:15:04.801 --> 06:15:08.256
PERFECTLY FINE IF HE DOES THE 
SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN? THIS 

06:15:08.455 --> 06:15:13.248
IS A DANGEROUS. HE IS INCITING 
HIS BASE. HE WAS USING

06:15:19.228 --> 06:15:21.538
THE CLAIM OF A RIGGED ELECTION. 
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEBODY DO 

06:15:21.739 --> 06:15:24.293
THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN, TELL A LIE, SAY SIX 

06:15:24.484 --> 06:15:26.484
MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME THAT IT IS 
A RIGGED ELECTION.

06:15:37.509 --> 06:15:39.343
THERE IS A DANGEROUS 
CONSEQUENCES TO THAT. WE'VE GOT 

06:15:39.344 --> 06:15:41.344
PLANS OF FOLLOWERS ON TWITTER 
AND MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS ON 

06:15:41.377 --> 06:15:43.409
FACEBOOK AND YOU HAVE THAT HUGE 
BULLY PULPIT FROM THE WHITE 

06:15:43.609 --> 06:15:46.044
HOUSE AND YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS A

06:15:46.244 --> 06:15:48.727
COST TO DOING THAT. PEOPLE ARE 
LISTENING TO YOU IN A WAY THAT 

06:15:48.915 --> 06:15:51.127
QUITE HONESTLY THEY ARE NOT 
LISTENING TO ME AND THEY ARE NOT

06:15:51.326 --> 06:15:54.039
LISTENING TO ALL OF US IN THIS 
ROOM. I JUST WANT TO CLEAR UP 

06:15:54.249 --> 06:15:56.762
THE DEFENSE COUNSEL MADE A POINT
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I READ 

06:15:56.963 --> 06:16:02.496
EARLIER. DEFENSE COUNSEL 
SUGGESTED I MISS SPOKE. I JUST 

06:16:02.707 --> 06:16:06.358
WANTED TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD
THAT THE TWEET I REFERENCED, LET

06:16:06.559 --> 06:16:10.982
ME REDO THE TWEET DIRECTLY. "IF 
A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

06:16:18.746 --> 06:16:21.206
WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN WITH PROOF
OF SUCH ACTS AT A LEVEL NEVER 

06:16:21.394 --> 06:16:23.224
SEEN BEFORE, THE DEMOCRAT 
SENATORS WOULD CONSIDER IT AN 

06:16:23.225 --> 06:16:25.458
ACT OF WAR AND FIGHT TO THE 
DEATH. MITCH AND THE REPUBLICANS

06:16:25.659 --> 06:16:28.443
DO NOTHING, JUST WANT TO LET IT 
PASS. NO FIGHT." DONALD TRUMP

06:16:32.976 --> 06:16:34.976
WAS EQUATING WHAT DEMOCRATS 
WOULD DO IF THERE ELECTION WAS 

06:16:35.006 --> 06:16:37.443
STOLEN, HE SAID THEY WOULD FIGHT
TO THE DEATH. WHY DO YOU THINK 

06:16:37.660 --> 06:16:41.292
HE SENDS THAT TWEET? BECAUSE HE 
IS TRYING TO SAY, THE OTHER SIDE

06:16:41.506 --> 06:16:46.788
WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH. SO YOU
SHOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH. DO WE

06:16:46.990 --> 06:16:48.990
READ THAT ANY OTHER WAY?

06:17:00.600 --> 06:17:02.600
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT.

06:17:12.581 --> 06:17:15.015
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM MISSOURI. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ON MY BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF

06:17:15.215 --> 06:17:17.399
SENATOR KRAMER, I SEND A 
QUESTION TO THE DESK.

06:17:42.589 --> 06:17:45.231
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CENTRE

06:17:50.969 --> 06:17:53.069
HAWLEY, ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND
SENATOR KRAMER SEND A QUESTION 

06:17:53.258 --> 06:17:55.030
FOR THE COUNSEL AND HOUSE 
MANAGERS . FOLLOWING OUR 

06:17:55.031 --> 06:17:59.710
PROCEDURE, THE FIRST ONE TO 
RESPOND AFTER IT IS MADE WILL BE

06:17:59.907 --> 06:18:02.302
THE COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT.

06:18:07.822 --> 06:18:11.686
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF THE SENATE'S POWER TO 
DISQUALIFY IS NOT DERIVATIVE OF 

06:18:11.887 --> 06:18:16.355
THE POWER TO REMOVE A CONVICTED 
PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE, COULD THE

06:18:16.970 --> 06:18:21.386
SENATE DISQUALIFY A SITTING 
PRESIDENT BUT NOT REMOVE HIM OR 

06:18:21.569 --> 06:18:23.569
HER?

06:18:39.320 --> 06:18:45.210
THE SENATE'S POWER TO DISQUALIFY
IS NOT DERIVATIVE OF THE POWER 

06:18:45.410 --> 06:18:48.610
TO REMOVE A CONVICTED PRESIDENT 
FROM OFFICE, COULD THE SENATE 

06:18:48.803 --> 06:18:53.683
DISQUALIFY A SITTING PRESIDENT 
BUT NOT REMOVE HIM OR HER?

06:18:56.934 --> 06:18:58.934
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:19:03.834 --> 06:19:06.059
THE COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT HAS 2 1/2 MINUTES.

06:19:12.762 --> 06:19:14.792
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO.

06:19:18.524 --> 06:19:25.421
I CAN'T LET THIS REST. MR. 
CASTRO ATTRIBUTED A STATEMENT 

06:19:25.833 --> 06:19:29.689
THE DAY BEFORE LAST THAT HE WAS 
A PEER THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD 

06:19:29.891 --> 06:19:35.992
TOLD HIS PEOPLE TO FIGHT TO THE 
DEATH. I AM NOT FROM HERE. I AM 

06:19:36.189 --> 06:19:38.189
NOT LIKE YOU GUYS.

06:19:42.490 --> 06:19:44.519
I WAS BEING VERY POLITE AND 
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT 

06:19:44.826 --> 06:19:47.478
THE RECORD. I THOUGHT THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD DO. 

06:19:47.662 --> 06:19:50.203
INSTEAD, WHAT HE DID IS HE CAME 
UP AND ILLUSTRATED THE PROBLEM 

06:19:50.403 --> 06:19:52.403
WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE 
HOUSE CASE.

06:19:56.102 --> 06:19:59.293
IT HAS BEEN SMOKE AND MIRRORS 
AND WORSE, IT HAS BEEN 

06:19:59.479 --> 06:20:03.348
DISHONEST. HE CAME UP AND TRIED 
TO COVER WHEN HE GOT CAUGHT

06:20:06.541 --> 06:20:08.822
THEY WERE CUT EARLIER TODAY WITH
ALL OF THE EVIDENCE

06:20:13.159 --> 06:20:14.991
, CHECKING TWEETS, SWITCHING 
DATES, EVERYTHING THEY DID, BEAR

06:20:14.992 --> 06:20:16.992
IN MIND, I HAD TWO DAYS

06:20:22.105 --> 06:20:24.557
TO LOOK AT THEIR EVIDENCE. WHEN 
I SAY TWO DAYS, I REALLY STARTED

06:20:24.752 --> 06:20:26.861
PUTTING IN THEIR EVIDENCE SO I 
STARTED BEING ABLE TO GET 

06:20:27.058 --> 06:20:31.253
LOOKING AT IT. THAT IS NOT THE 
WAY THIS SHOULD BE DONE. WHAT WE

06:20:31.455 --> 06:20:36.735
DISCOVERED WAS HE KNEW WHAT HE 
WAS DOING. HE KNEW THAT THE 

06:20:37.003 --> 06:20:39.517
PRESIDENT DIDN'T SAY THAT TO HIS
PEOPLE. WHAT HE SAID WAS

06:20:42.833 --> 06:20:44.865
, IF IT HAPPENED TO THE 
DEMOCRATS, THIS IS WHAT THEY 

06:20:45.065 --> 06:20:48.315
WOULD DO. IN HIS SPEECH THAT 
DAY, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE 

06:20:48.519 --> 06:20:50.546
SAID IF THIS HAPPENED TO THE 
DEMOCRATS, IF THE ELECTION WAS 

06:20:50.747 --> 06:20:57.764
STOLEN FROM THE DEMOCRATS, ALL 
WOULD BREAK LOOSE. BUT, HE SAID 

06:20:57.948 --> 06:21:02.739
TO HIS SUPPORTERS, WE ARE 
SMARTER. WE ARE STRONGER AND WE 

06:21:03.146 --> 06:21:05.920
ARE NOT GOING TO DO WHAT THEY 
DID ALL SUMMER LONG.

06:21:13.904 --> 06:21:16.751
SO WHAT HE DID WAS, HE 
MISREPRESENTED A TWEET TO YOU TO

06:21:17.510 --> 06:21:24.422
PUT FORTH THE NARRATIVE THAT IS 
WRONG. IT IS WRONG, IT IS 

06:21:24.612 --> 06:21:27.878
DISHONEST, AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE DON'T DESERVE THIS ANY 

06:21:28.085 --> 06:21:30.099
LONGER. YOU MUST ACQUIT.

06:21:38.490 --> 06:21:40.725
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MANAGERS ON THE PART OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAVE 2 

06:21:41.485 --> 06:21:44.740
1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:21:52.294 --> 06:21:54.124
THAT WAS PROFOUNDLY INACCURATE 
AND IRRELEVANT TO WHAT THE 

06:21:54.125 --> 06:21:56.359
QUESTION IS SO THAT WE GET BACK 
TO THE QUESTION IS. UNDER 

06:21:56.559 --> 06:21:59.968
ARTICLE 2 SECTION 4, A PRESIDENT
WHO IS IN OFFICE MUST BE 

06:22:00.155 --> 06:22:09.161
CONVICTED BEFORE REMOVAL. THEN 
MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE 

06:22:09.923 --> 06:22:11.923
DISQUALIFICATION. OKAY.

06:22:15.858 --> 06:22:18.255
IF THE PRESIDENT IS ALREADY OUT 
OF OFFICE, THEN HE CAN BE 

06:22:18.504 --> 06:22:20.333
SEPARATELY DISQUALIFIED, AS THIS
PRESIDENT IS. THESE POWERS HAVE 

06:22:20.334 --> 06:22:23.933
ALWAYS BEEN TREATED AS SEPARATE,
WHICH IS WHY I THINK THERE HAVE 

06:22:24.130 --> 06:22:29.671
BEEN EIGHT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
CONVICTED AND REMOVED IT JUST 

06:22:29.871 --> 06:22:31.871
THREE OF THEM DISQUALIFIED.

06:22:35.971 --> 06:22:38.147
AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS A TOTALLY 
SEPARATE PROCESS WITHIN THE 

06:22:38.333 --> 06:22:40.034
SENATE FOR DOING THIS. THE 
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES A TWO 

06:22:40.035 --> 06:22:43.485
THIRDS VOTE FOR CONVICTION BUT 
FOR DISQUALIFICATION, IT IS A 

06:22:44.246 --> 06:22:48.902
MAJORITY VOTE. IT IS A SEPARATE 
THING. PEOPLE COULD VOTE TO

06:22:51.818 --> 06:22:54.386
CONVICT AND VOTE NOT TO 
DISQUALIFY IF THEY FELT THAT

06:22:57.904 --> 06:22:59.737
THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT 
THE PRESIDENT WAS GUILTY OF 

06:22:59.738 --> 06:23:04.816
INCITEMENT TO INSURRECTION, THEY
COULD VOTE TO CONVICT BUT IF 

06:23:05.019 --> 06:23:08.668
THEY FELT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT 
TO EXERCISE THE FURTHER POWER 

06:23:09.083 --> 06:23:10.699
ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION 
TO DISQUALIFY, THEY WOULDN'T 

06:23:10.700 --> 06:23:15.170
HAVE TO DO THAT AND THAT COULD 
BE SOMETHING THAT IS TAKEN 

06:23:15.371 --> 06:23:17.371
SEPARATELY BY THE SENATE BY 
MAJORITY VOTE.

06:23:20.653 --> 06:23:22.653
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT.

06:23:30.412 --> 06:23:31.487
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM 
MASSACHUSETTS. 

06:23:31.488 --> 06:23:33.488
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SEND A QUESTION TO THE 
DESK.

06:23:57.825 --> 06:23:59.861
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM 
MASSACHUSETTS HAS A QUESTION FOR

06:24:00.053 --> 06:24:03.873
THE HOUSE MANAGERS. THE CLERK 
WILL READ THE QUESTION.

06:24:16.174 --> 06:24:18.448
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE DIFFERENCES PRESENTATION 
HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT 

06:24:18.632 --> 06:24:24.122
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
RAISED OBJECTIONS TO COUNTING OF

06:24:24.347 --> 06:24:26.671
ELECTORAL VOTES IN PAST SESSIONS
OF CONGRESS. TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, 

06:24:26.926 --> 06:24:31.136
WERE ANY OF THOSE ACRYLIC 
OBJECTIONS RAISED AFTER 

06:24:32.087 --> 06:24:34.087
INTERVENTIONISTS

06:24:36.020 --> 06:24:38.585
STORMED THE CAPITOL IN ORDER TO 
PREVENT THE CODING OF ELECTORAL 

06:24:38.857 --> 06:24:42.425
VOTES AND AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERSONAL LAWYER ASKED SENATORS 

06:24:42.614 --> 06:24:46.933
TO MAKE THESE OBJECTIONS 
SPECIFICALLY TO DELAY THE 

06:24:47.367 --> 06:24:49.367
CERTIFICATION?

06:25:03.185 --> 06:25:05.185
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

06:25:09.741 --> 06:25:11.587
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 
PRESIDENT, FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 

06:25:11.588 --> 06:25:15.155
TO RESPOND TO THAT. THE ANSWER 
IS NO, WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT ANY

06:25:15.341 --> 06:25:18.733
OTHER OBJECTIONS RAISED IN THE 
CODING OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE 

06:25:18.936 --> 06:25:23.930
VOTES EITHER BY DEMOCRATS OR 
REPUBLICANS, AND THIS HAS BEEN A

06:25:24.118 --> 06:25:26.118
PROUD PERSON

06:25:28.014 --> 06:25:31.712
TRADITION AND THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE JUST BECAUSE THE 

06:25:32.138 --> 06:25:38.829
ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS SO ARCANE 
AND HAS SO MANY RULES TO IT. I 

06:25:39.077 --> 06:25:43.315
THINK MY COCOUNSEL ON THE OTHER 
SIDE HAD SOME FUN BECAUSE I WAS 

06:25:43.499 --> 06:25:48.739
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK I 
THINK ABOUT 30 SECONDS IN 2016 

06:25:49.118 --> 06:25:53.619
TO POINT OUT THAT THE ELECTORS 
FROM FLORIDA WERE NOT ACTUALLY 

06:25:53.965 --> 06:25:58.469
CONFORMING TO THE LETTER OF THE 
LAW BECAUSE THEY HAVE A WILL IN 

06:25:58.910 --> 06:26:02.560
FLORIDA YOU CAN'T BE A DUAL 
OFFICEHOLDER. YOU CAN'T BE A 

06:26:02.906 --> 06:26:07.371
STATE LEGISLATOR AND ALSO BE AN 
ELECTRODE. SO THAT WAS IN PROPER

06:26:07.867 --> 06:26:11.963
FORM BUT I THINK THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, THEN VICE PRESIDENT 

06:26:12.149 --> 06:26:17.235
BIDEN PROPERLY BAFFLED ME DOWN 
AND SAID WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO 

06:26:17.656 --> 06:26:20.664
MAKE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORK 
AND WE ARE GOING TO VINDICATE 

06:26:20.963 --> 06:26:23.882
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. THAT IS 
PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAS HAPPENED. 

06:26:24.219 --> 06:26:28.466
NOBODY HAS STORMED THE CAPITOL 
BEFORE, OR AS A PERCENTAGE OF 

06:26:28.649 --> 06:26:30.860
CHENEY, THE SECRETARY OF THE 
REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE SAID, GONE

06:26:31.106 --> 06:26:35.430
OUT AND SUMMONED A MOB, A SYMBOL
AMOUNT, INCITED A MOB, AND LIT A

06:26:35.808 --> 06:26:39.275
MATCH. AS REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY 
SAID, THIS WOULD, THAT ALL OF 

06:26:39.657 --> 06:26:43.422
THIS GOES TO THE DOORSTEP OF THE
PRESIDENT. NONE OF IT WOULD 

06:26:43.831 --> 06:26:48.578
HAPPEN WITHOUT HIM AND ALL OF IT
IS DUE TO HIS ACTIONS. THAT IS 

06:26:48.927 --> 06:26:51.711
THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE 
REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, WHO WAS 

06:26:52.107 --> 06:26:55.611
THE TARGET OF AN EFFORT TO 
REMOVE HER, WHICH WAS REJECTED 

06:26:55.996 --> 06:27:00.718
ON THE FOOT OF BY MORE THAN 2 TO
1 AND THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN 

06:27:01.035 --> 06:27:04.837
CONFERENCE WHEN THERE WAS AN 
ATTEMPT TO REMOVE HER FOR 

06:27:05.175 --> 06:27:08.376
PUTTING FOR IMPEACHMENT AND 
BECOMING A LEADER FOR 

06:27:08.828 --> 06:27:12.215
VINDICATING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
VALUES. SO PLEASE DON'T MIX UP 

06:27:12.618 --> 06:27:16.783
WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 
HAVE DONE. IN EVERY ELECTION FOR

06:27:17.208 --> 06:27:21.706
THE LONG TIME TO SAY THERE ARE 
PARTIES GOING ON IN TERMS OF 

06:27:22.154 --> 06:27:24.756
CONFORMING WITH STATE ELECTION 
LAWS WITH THE IDEA OF MOBILIZING

06:27:25.092 --> 06:27:28.886
A MOB INSURRECTION AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT GOT FIVE PEOPLE 

06:27:29.143 --> 06:27:32.579
KILLED. 140 CAPITOL OFFICERS 
WANTED, AND THREATENED THE 

06:27:32.920 --> 06:27:36.274
ACTUAL PEACEFUL SUCCESSION OF 
POWER AND TRANSFER OF POWER IN 

06:27:36.494 --> 06:27:38.648
AMERICA. IF YOU WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT REFORMING THE ELECTORAL 

06:27:38.898 --> 06:27:41.926
COLLEGE, WE CAN ABOUT REFORMING 
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. DON'T DO 

06:27:42.184 --> 06:27:44.784
IT WITH VIOLENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 

06:27:44.785 --> 06:27:49.094
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FOR NORTH DAKOTA.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIGURE, I SENT A QUESTION TO 

06:27:49.371 --> 06:27:51.625
THE DESK FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENTS ATTORNEYS.

06:28:10.466 --> 06:28:12.466
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CLERK WILL READ 

06:28:16.976 --> 06:28:20.714
THE QUESTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GIVEN THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE 

06:28:22.394 --> 06:28:24.394
HOUSE MANAGER THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS TOLERATED 

06:28:28.642 --> 06:28:31.160
ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC, HAS THERE
BEEN A MORE PRO-ISRAEL PRESIDENT

06:28:31.379 --> 06:28:33.379
THAN 

06:28:36.388 --> 06:28:42.113
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, BUT IT IS APPARENT THAT 

06:28:42.321 --> 06:28:48.172
NOBODY LISTENED TO WHAT I SAID 
EARLIER TODAY BECAUSE THE 

06:28:48.373 --> 06:28:50.373
PICTORIAL SPEECH NEEDS 

06:28:51.959 --> 06:28:54.231
TO STOP. YOU NEED TO STOP. THERE
WAS NOTHING FUN HERE 

06:28:58.821 --> 06:29:00.916
MR. RASKIN. WE AREN'T HAVING 
FUN. THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST 

06:29:01.120 --> 06:29:04.461
EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD DOWN HERE IN
WASHINGTON DEEP DC. AND IN 

06:29:04.674 --> 06:29:06.963
PHILADELPHIA, WHERE I COME FROM,
WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT DOCTORING 

06:29:10.957 --> 06:29:13.056
THE EVIDENCE, YOUR CASE IS OVER.
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THEY 

06:29:13.260 --> 06:29:16.816
GOT CAUGHT DOCTORING THE 
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE SHOULD 

06:29:21.830 --> 06:29:28.541
BE OVER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM BUT 

06:29:33.569 --> 06:29:35.569
NOT VERMONT?

06:30:03.530 --> 06:30:06.876
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM VERMONT, SENATOR
SANDERS HAS A QUESTION FOR BOTH 

06:30:07.078 --> 06:30:09.078
THE COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT AND 

06:30:13.782 --> 06:30:16.479
HOUSE MANAGER. THE CLERK WILL 
READ IT AND FOLLOWING OUR 

06:30:16.700 --> 06:30:18.700
PROCEDURE, THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
WILL 

06:30:22.543 --> 06:30:24.543
GO FIRST. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE PROSECUTORS HAS 

06:30:24.639 --> 06:30:29.058
STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PURCHASED 

06:30:29.260 --> 06:30:31.542
PERPETRATING A BIG LIE WHEN HE 
REPEATEDLY CLAIMED THAT THE 

06:30:31.743 --> 06:30:36.119
ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM AND
THAT HE ACTUALLY WON THE 

06:30:36.339 --> 06:30:40.742
ELECTION BY A LANDSLIDE. ARE THE
PROSECUTORS RIGHT WHEN THEY 

06:30:40.955 --> 06:30:42.955
CLAIM THAT TRUMP WAS TELLING A 

06:30:45.139 --> 06:30:47.139
BIG LIE OR IN YOUR JUDGMENT, DID
TRUMP ACTUALLY WIN 

06:30:52.039 --> 06:30:54.595
THE ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE UP TO

06:30:54.796 --> 06:30:56.796
2 

06:30:59.819 --> 06:31:01.819
1/2 MINUTES.

06:31:26.796 --> 06:31:32.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS WE ALL KNOW, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DID LOSE THE ELECTION BY 7

06:31:37.880 --> 06:31:39.880
MILLION VOTES

06:31:41.880 --> 06:31:44.171
, 306 ELECTORAL VOTES. BY THE 
TIME OF THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK, 

06:31:44.371 --> 06:31:46.371
THE COURTS, THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT, ALL 50 STATES ACROSS

06:31:47.299 --> 06:31:49.299
THE COUNTRY DUNN AGREED THAT 

06:31:53.159 --> 06:31:56.854
THE CODE VOTES WERE COUNTED, THE
PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN AND IT WAS 

06:31:57.056 --> 06:32:00.010
TIME FOR THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER 
OF POWER. AS OUR CONSTITUTION 

06:32:00.211 --> 06:32:08.352
AND THE RULE OF LAW DEMANDS, 61 
COURTS, 61 COURTS THE PRESIDENT 

06:32:10.040 --> 06:32:12.040
WENT TO. THAT'S FINE. 
APPROPRIATE. 

06:32:16.281 --> 06:32:18.281
HE LOST. HE LOST! HE LOST 

06:32:21.500 --> 06:32:23.500
THE ELECTION. HE LOST THE COURT 
CASE. AS LEADER 

06:32:28.149 --> 06:32:31.700
McCONNELL RECOGNIZED THE DAY 
AFTER THE ELECTORS CERTIFIED THE

06:32:31.919 --> 06:32:34.181
VOTES ON DECEMBER 14th, HE SAID,
QUOTE, MANY MILLIONS OF US HAD 

06:32:34.383 --> 06:32:36.260
HOPED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION WOULD YIELD A DIFFERENT

06:32:36.261 --> 06:32:38.261
RESULT. BUT OUR SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT HAS PROCESSES TO 

06:32:38.341 --> 06:32:42.517
DETERMINE WHO WILL BE SWORN IN 
ON JANUARY 20th. THE ELECTORAL 

06:32:42.717 --> 06:32:44.717
COLLEGE 

06:32:47.730 --> 06:32:49.730
HAS SPOKEN.

06:32:51.490 --> 06:32:55.239
PATRIOTISM. SOMETIMES THERE IS A
REASON TO DISPUTE AN ELECTION. 

06:32:55.439 --> 06:32:57.519
SOMETIMES THE COUNT IS CLOSE, 
SOMETIMES WE ASK FOR A RECOUNT, 

06:32:57.720 --> 06:32:59.720
GO 

06:33:01.709 --> 06:33:03.800
TO COURTS, ALL OF THAT IS 
APPROPRIATE. I LOST MY FIRST 

06:33:04.020 --> 06:33:06.515
ELECTION, I STAYED IN BED FOR 
THREE DAYS. WE DO WHAT WE NEED 

06:33:06.716 --> 06:33:08.716
TO DO AND WE MOVE ON. THIS WAS 

06:33:12.566 --> 06:33:14.566
NOT THAT. BECAUSE WHEN ALL OF 
THESE PEOPLE CONFIRMED THAT 

06:33:14.674 --> 06:33:16.674
DONALD TRUMP HAD LOST COME AWAY 
WHEN 

06:33:19.020 --> 06:33:23.200
THE COURTS, HIS, HIS DEPARTMENT 
OF JUSTICE, STATE OFFICIALS, 

06:33:23.420 --> 06:33:25.420
CONGRESS, HIS 

06:33:27.600 --> 06:33:29.600
VICE PRESIDENT WERE READY TO 
COMMIT TO THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER 

06:33:29.700 --> 06:33:34.040
OF POWER, THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER 
OF POWER, DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT 

06:33:34.253 --> 06:33:36.738
READY. AND SO WE ARE ALL HERE 
BECAUSE HE WAS 

06:33:40.315 --> 06:33:42.315
NOT READY. DAY AFTER DAY HE TOLD

06:33:44.883 --> 06:33:46.883
HIS SUPPORTERS FALSE, OUTLANDISH
CLAIMS OF WHY THIS ELECTION WAS 

06:33:46.997 --> 06:33:50.917
RIGGED. NOW, LET'S BE CLEAR. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD ABSOLUTELY 

06:33:51.118 --> 06:33:56.711
NO SUPPORT OF THESE CLAIMS. THAT
WASN'T THE POINT OF WHAT HE WAS 

06:33:56.924 --> 06:33:59.890
DOING. HE DID IT TO MAKE HIS 
SUPPORTERS FRUSTRATED, TO MAKE 

06:34:04.902 --> 06:34:06.902
THEM ANGRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TIME 

06:34:10.773 --> 06:34:13.100
HAS EXPIRED. AND COUNSEL, FOR 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT, RECOGNIZE 

06:34:13.320 --> 06:34:15.320
FOR 2 

06:34:17.480 --> 06:34:19.480
1/2 MINUTES. THE CLERK WILL READ
THE 

06:34:23.762 --> 06:34:27.330
QUESTION AGAIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE PROSECUTORS HAVE 

06:34:27.550 --> 06:34:30.481
STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PERPETRATING

06:34:30.683 --> 06:34:33.860
A BIG LIE WHEN HE REPEATEDLY 
CLAIMED THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

06:34:34.080 --> 06:34:38.040
STOLEN FROM HIM AND THAT HE 
ACTUALLY WON THE ELECTION BY 

06:34:41.779 --> 06:34:43.880
A LANDSLIDE. ARE THE PROSECUTORS
RIGHT WHEN THEY CLAIM THAT TRUMP

06:34:44.081 --> 06:34:47.640
WAS TELLING A BIG LIE? OR IN 
YOUR JUDGMENT, DID TRUMP 

06:34:47.860 --> 06:34:49.860
ACTUALLY WIN 

06:34:52.280 --> 06:34:53.959
THE ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 

06:34:53.960 --> 06:34:55.960
PRESIDENT HAVE 2 

06:34:58.315 --> 06:34:59.999
1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY JUDGMENT? WHO ASKED THAT? 

06:35:00.000 --> 06:35:03.100
MY JUDGMENT HERE IS RELEVANT IN 
THIS PROCEEDING. IT ABSOLUTELY 

06:35:03.321 --> 06:35:05.420
AIRS. WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
HERE IS THE ARTICLE OF 

06:35:05.620 --> 06:35:08.956
IMPEACHMENT IS -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE WILL BE 

06:35:13.560 --> 06:35:18.989
IN ORDER. THE SENATORS UNDER THE
RULES CANNOT CHALLENGE THE 

06:35:19.200 --> 06:35:25.459
CONTENT OF THE RESPONSE. THE 
COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE. 

06:35:25.460 --> 06:35:27.460
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY MAY I HAVE THE QUESTION 
READ 

06:35:31.520 --> 06:35:32.987
AGAIN PLEASE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE PROSECUTORS HAVE 

06:35:32.988 --> 06:35:34.988
STATED OVER AND 

06:35:38.281 --> 06:35:40.351
OVER AGAIN THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS PERPETRATING A BIG LIE WHEN 

06:35:40.565 --> 06:35:42.653
HE REPEATEDLY CLAIMED THAT THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM AND

06:35:42.854 --> 06:35:44.854
THAT HE ACTUALLY WON THE 
ELECTION BY 

06:35:47.219 --> 06:35:49.320
A LANDSLIDE. ARE THE PROSECUTORS
RIGHT WHEN THEY CLAIM THAT TRUMP

06:35:49.540 --> 06:35:53.940
WAS TELLING A BIG LIE? OR IN 
YOUR JUDGMENT, DID TRUMP 

06:35:54.141 --> 06:35:56.141
ACTUALLY WIN 

06:35:57.719 --> 06:35:59.719
THE ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN MY JUDGMENT, IT IS 

06:35:59.820 --> 06:36:01.820
IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION 
BEFORE THIS BODY. WHAT IS 

06:36:01.860 --> 06:36:03.860
RELEVANT IN THIS 

06:36:07.300 --> 06:36:10.250
IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE IS, WERE MR.
TRUMP'S WORDS INSIGHTFUL TO THE 

06:36:10.451 --> 06:36:15.440
POINT OF VIOLENCE AND RIOT? THAT
IS THE CHARGE, THAT IS THE 

06:36:15.660 --> 06:36:21.047
QUESTION. AND THE ANSWER IS NO. 
HE DID NOT HAVE SPEECH THAT WAS 

06:36:21.260 --> 06:36:27.760
INSIGHTFUL TO VIOLENCE OR RIOT. 
NOW, WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO 

06:36:28.395 --> 06:36:32.574
UNDERSTAND HERE IS THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS HAVE COMPLETELY, FROM 

06:36:32.775 --> 06:36:37.610
THE BEGINNING OF THIS CASE, TO 
RIGHT NOW, DONE EVERYTHING 

06:36:38.651 --> 06:36:40.651
EXCEPT ANSWER 

06:36:43.674 --> 06:36:46.817
THAT QUESTION! THE QUESTION THEY
BROUGHT BEFORE YOU. THE QUESTION

06:36:47.018 --> 06:36:49.018
THEY WANT MY CLIENT TO BE 

06:36:51.640 --> 06:36:54.776
PUNISHED BY. THAT IS THE 
QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD BE GETTING

06:36:54.976 --> 06:37:00.816
ASKED. AND THE ANSWER IS HE 
ADVOCATED FOR 

06:37:06.875 --> 06:37:10.262
PATRIOTIC PROTEST. THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS HAVE SHOWED ZERO, 

06:37:14.675 --> 06:37:16.675
ZERO EVIDENCE THAT HIS WORDS DID

06:37:18.875 --> 06:37:22.010
ANYTHING ELSE. REMEMBER, ALL OF 
THE EVIDENCE SAYS THIS WAS 

06:37:22.211 --> 06:37:26.401
PREMEDITATED. THE ATTACK ON THE 
CAPITAL WAS PREPLANNED. IT 

06:37:26.603 --> 06:37:28.603
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
MR. TRUMP IN 

06:37:33.100 --> 06:37:35.100
ANY WAY WHAT HE SAID ON THAT DAY

06:37:37.740 --> 06:37:39.820
ON JANUARY SIXTH AT THAT 
ELLIPSE. AND THAT IS THE ISSUE 

06:37:40.040 --> 06:37:42.040
BEFORE 

06:37:43.980 --> 06:37:45.980
THIS SENATE. NOW, ON THE ISSUE 

06:37:48.796 --> 06:37:51.760
OF CONTESTING ELECTIONS AND THE 
RESULTS, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

06:37:56.767 --> 06:37:59.260
A LONG COME A LONG HISTORY OF 
JUST DOING THAT. I HOPE 

06:37:59.480 --> 06:38:01.730
EVERYBODY WAS ABLE TO SEE THE 
VIDEO EARLIER TODAY OVER AND 

06:38:02.202 --> 06:38:04.202
OVER AGAIN IT HAS 

06:38:07.600 --> 06:38:10.121
BEEN CONTESTED. WHEN MR. TRUMP 
WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE WERE 

06:38:11.140 --> 06:38:15.120
TOLD -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COUNSEL, THE 2 1/2 MINUTES 

06:38:20.121 --> 06:38:22.121
HAD EXPIRED.

06:38:24.917 --> 06:38:26.917
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM 

06:38:30.120 --> 06:38:32.016
WISCONSIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SENT A QUESTION TO THE DESK

06:38:32.017 --> 06:38:34.017
FOR 

06:38:37.020 --> 06:38:39.020
BOTH PARTIES.

06:39:00.939 --> 06:39:06.797
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN SENDS 
A QUESTION FOR BOTH COUNSEL FOR 

06:39:06.997 --> 06:39:08.997
THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND THE 

06:39:12.040 --> 06:39:14.938
HOUSE MANAGERS. CLERK WILL READ 
IT AND 

06:39:18.683 --> 06:39:20.777
THE COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THE FIRST 2 

06:39:23.700 --> 06:39:25.700
1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE 

06:39:28.282 --> 06:39:30.596
HOUSE MANAGERS ASSERT THAT THE 
JANUARY SIXTH ATTACK WAS 

06:39:30.796 --> 06:39:32.796
PREDICTABLE AND IT 

06:39:35.860 --> 06:39:37.960
WAS FORESEEABLE. IF SO, WHY DID 
IT APPEAR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 

06:39:38.173 --> 06:39:43.840
AT THE CAPITAL WERE CAUGHT OFF 
GUARD AND UNABLE TO PREVENT THE 

06:39:44.040 --> 06:39:46.144
BREACH? WHY DID THE HOUSE 
SERGEANT AT ARMS REPORTEDLY 

06:39:46.350 --> 06:39:51.181
TURNED DOWN A REQUEST TO 
ACTIVATE THE NATIONAL GUARD 

06:39:51.395 --> 06:39:53.395
STATING THAT HE WAS NOT 
COMFORTABLE WITH 

06:39:58.280 --> 06:40:00.280
THE OPTICS?

06:40:03.280 --> 06:40:05.280
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

06:40:16.069 --> 06:40:18.069
COUNSEL FORMER PRESIDENT 

06:40:21.510 --> 06:40:24.423
IS RECOGNIZED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COULD YOU READ THE QUESTION 

06:40:28.574 --> 06:40:30.039
AGAIN PLEASE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; READ THE QUESTION AGAIN. 

06:40:30.040 --> 06:40:32.040
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS ASSERT 
THAT THE JANUARY SIXTH ATTACK 

06:40:32.121 --> 06:40:34.121
WAS PREDICTABLE AND IT 

06:40:36.517 --> 06:40:38.604
WAS FORESEEABLE. IF SO, WHY DID 
IT APPEAR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 

06:40:38.818 --> 06:40:43.841
AT THE CAPITAL WERE CAUGHT OFF 
GUARD AND UNABLE TO PREVENT THE 

06:40:44.050 --> 06:40:45.915
BREACH? WHY DID THE HOUSE 
SERGEANT AT ARMS REPORTEDLY 

06:40:45.916 --> 06:40:48.193
TURNED DOWN A REQUEST TO 
ACTIVATE THE 

06:40:51.740 --> 06:40:53.740
NATIONAL GUARD, STATING THAT HE 
WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE 

06:40:53.828 --> 06:40:58.426
OPTICS PREXY 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOLY COW. THAT IS A REALLY 

06:41:00.766 --> 06:41:06.868
GOOD QUESTION. AND HAD THE HOUSE
MANAGERS DONE THEIR 

06:41:07.089 --> 06:41:09.411
INVESTIGATION, MAYBE SOMEBODY 
WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT. 

06:41:09.628 --> 06:41:11.628
BUT THEY DIDN'T. 

06:41:14.826 --> 06:41:16.826
THEY DID ZERO INVESTIGATION. 
THEY DID NOTHING. THEY LOOKED 

06:41:21.506 --> 06:41:25.095
INTO NOTHING. THEY READ 
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES, THEY TALKED 

06:41:25.294 --> 06:41:27.397
TO THEIR FRIENDS WHO KNOW A TV 
REPORTER OR SOMETHING OR 

06:41:27.608 --> 06:41:31.561
SOMETHING OR ANOTHER. BUT JIMINY
CRICKET TICKETS, THERE IS NO DUE

06:41:31.903 --> 06:41:34.368
PROCESS IN THIS PROCEEDING AT 
ALL AND THAT QUESTION HIGHLIGHTS

06:41:34.604 --> 06:41:39.116
THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE NO DUE
PROCESS, YOU HAVE NO CLEAR-CUT 

06:41:39.556 --> 06:41:41.556
ANSWERS. BUT WE 

06:41:43.557 --> 06:41:47.498
DO KNOW THAT THERE WAS, I THINK,
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF 

06:41:47.718 --> 06:41:49.718
FORESEEABILITY. IT LOOKS LIKE 
FROM THE INFORMATION THEY 

06:41:52.331 --> 06:41:54.331
WERE PRESENTING, SOME LAW 
ENFORCEMENT KNEW THAT SOMETHING 

06:41:56.695 --> 06:41:58.695
COULD HAPPEN. IN MY 
PRESENTATION, WE KNEW THAT 

06:42:01.521 --> 06:42:05.282
THE MAYOR, TWO DAYS BEFORE, 
BEFORE, HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HAVE

06:42:06.960 --> 06:42:08.960
FEDERAL TROOPS OR NATIONAL 

06:42:12.014 --> 06:42:14.014
GUARD DEPLOYED BEEF UP SECURITY 
HERE IN 

06:42:18.235 --> 06:42:20.348
CAPITOL POLICE. THAT WAS 
OFFERED. SO, SOMEBODY HAD TO 

06:42:20.561 --> 06:42:22.630
HAVE AN INKLING INTO SOMETHING. 
AND MY QUESTION IS WHO IGNORED 

06:42:22.831 --> 06:42:24.831
IT? 

06:42:27.848 --> 06:42:29.848
AND WHY?

06:42:33.729 --> 06:42:36.050
IS AN INVESTIGATION WERE DONE, 
WE WOULD KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

06:42:36.252 --> 06:42:42.514
TOO. THANK YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE TWO 

06:42:42.714 --> 06:42:45.029
AND A HOUSE -- 2 

06:42:50.053 --> 06:42:52.053
1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FIRST, IT DEFENDS COUNSEL HAS

06:42:54.408 --> 06:42:56.497
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE YOU ARE 
WELCOME TO GIVE IT TO US. WE 

06:42:56.698 --> 06:42:58.990
WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT. YOU'VE HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE US 

06:42:59.195 --> 06:43:02.520
EVIDENCE THAT WOULD A SCOPE WITH
TAPE THE PRESIDENT. HAVEN'T SEEN

06:43:03.997 --> 06:43:06.913
IT YET. EVERYONE, THE DEFENSE 
COUNSEL BALL WANTS TO BLAME 

06:43:10.693 --> 06:43:12.693
EVERYONE ELSE EXCEPT THE PERSON 
WHO WAS MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR 

06:43:12.775 --> 06:43:14.775
WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIXTH. 
AND THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

06:43:19.681 --> 06:43:24.723
DONALD TRUMP. AND THAT IS A 
PERSON WHO FORESEE THIS THE MOST

06:43:24.924 --> 06:43:29.534
BECAUSE HE HAD THE REPORTS, HE 
HAD ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. 

06:43:29.754 --> 06:43:35.165
HE AS WELL HAD, WE ALL KNOW HOW 
HE IS AN AVID CABLE NEWS 

06:43:35.365 --> 06:43:40.427
WATCHER. HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN. HE CULTIVATED THESE 

06:43:40.641 --> 06:43:42.721
INDIVIDUALS. THESE ARE THE 
UNDISPUTED FACTS, THE NATIONAL 

06:43:42.921 --> 06:43:44.921
GUARD 

06:43:47.948 --> 06:43:52.933
WAS A NOT DEPLOYED AFTER THE 
ATTACK. I HEARD REFERENCE TO 

06:43:53.149 --> 06:43:54.842
MAYOR BOWSER IN DEFENSES 
PRESENTATION. MAYOR BOWSER DOES 

06:43:54.843 --> 06:43:57.350
NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE 
CAPITAL OR FEDERAL BUILDINGS. 

06:43:57.570 --> 06:43:59.570
SHE COULD NOT DEPLOY NATIONAL 
GUARDS TO 

06:44:02.192 --> 06:44:04.453
THE CAPITAL. THAT IS OUTSIDE OF 
THE JURISDICTION OF THE MAYOR OF

06:44:04.655 --> 06:44:06.655
THE DISTRICT 

06:44:09.050 --> 06:44:11.534
OF COLUMBIA. AT NO POINT IN THAT
ENTIRE DAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF 

06:44:11.734 --> 06:44:14.255
THE UNITED STATES, OUR 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, TELL ANYONE,

06:44:14.456 --> 06:44:16.350
LAW ENFORCEMENT STRUGGLING FOR 
THEIR EYES, INSURGENTS WHO FELT 

06:44:16.351 --> 06:44:20.517
EMPOWERED BY THE SHEER QUANTITY 
OF THEM, ANY OF US IN THIS 

06:44:20.731 --> 06:44:25.517
BUILDING OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
THAT HE WAS SENDING HELP. HE DID

06:44:25.737 --> 06:44:29.498
NOT DEFEND THE CAPITAL. THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

06:44:31.818 --> 06:44:35.590
DID NOT DEFEND THE CAPITAL OF 
THIS COUNTRY. 

06:44:40.602 --> 06:44:42.602
IT'S UN-INDEFENSIBLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

06:44:46.183 --> 06:44:48.132
MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR MORAN. 

06:44:48.133 --> 06:44:50.133
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SENT A QUESTION TO THE 
DESK. 

06:45:22.927 --> 06:45:24.989
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR SUBMITS A QUESTION 
FOR THE HOUSE MANAGERS. THE 

06:45:25.192 --> 06:45:27.192
CLERK WILL READ 

06:45:30.644 --> 06:45:32.644
THE QUESTION.

06:45:38.598 --> 06:45:40.879
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF A PRESIDENT SPENDS A BIG 
LIE TO ANGER AMERICANS AND 

06:45:41.093 --> 06:45:43.417
STOKES THE THEORY BY REPEATING 
THE LIE AT EVENT AFTER EVENT AND

06:45:43.636 --> 06:45:48.267
INVITES VIOLENT GROUPS TO DC ON 
THE DAY AND OUR NECESSARY TO 

06:45:48.472 --> 06:45:50.472
INTERRUPT THE ELECTORAL 

06:45:53.046 --> 06:45:55.046
COLLEGE COUNT AND DOES NOTHING 
TO STOP THOSE GROUPS FROM 

06:45:55.159 --> 06:45:58.505
ADVANCING ON THE CAPITAL AND 
FAILS TO SUMMON THE NATIONAL 

06:45:58.705 --> 06:46:02.676
GUARD TO PROTECT THE CAPITAL AND
THEN EXPRESSES PLEASURE AND 

06:46:02.877 --> 06:46:07.721
DELIGHT THAT THE CAPITAL WAS 
UNDER ATTACK, IS THE PRESIDENT 

06:46:07.922 --> 06:46:11.442
INNOCENT OF INCITING AN 
INSURRECTION? BECAUSE IN A 

06:46:11.659 --> 06:46:13.659
SPEECH HE SAYS 

06:46:17.094 --> 06:46:19.094
BE PEACEFUL?

06:46:22.679 --> 06:46:24.679
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE 

06:46:28.489 --> 06:46:30.489
FIVE MINUTES.

06:46:40.972 --> 06:46:44.551
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Y'ALL ASK A VERY IMPORTANT 
QUESTION, 

06:46:49.570 --> 06:46:51.570
WHICH IS

06:46:54.773 --> 06:46:56.773
GIVING EVERYTHING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DID LEADING UP TO THE 

06:46:56.865 --> 06:46:58.945
ELECTION, AFTER THE ELECTION AND
LEADING UP TO JANUARY SIXTH, ALL

06:46:59.146 --> 06:47:01.030
OF THE INCITEMENT OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS WHOM HE CONVINCED 

06:47:01.031 --> 06:47:03.333
WITH A BIG LIE OVER AND OVER, 
THAT THE ELECTION HAD BEEN 

06:47:03.534 --> 06:47:07.293
STOLEN FROM THEM AND FROM HIM 
AND THEN ONCE THE MOB 

06:47:12.311 --> 06:47:15.011
HAD STORMED THE CAPITAL, THE 
VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN DANGER, 

06:47:15.196 --> 06:47:20.210
THE SPEAKER WAS IN DANGER AND 
THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND THE

06:47:20.411 --> 06:47:22.411
SENATE AND ALL THE STAFF HERE, 
THE JANITORIAL STAFF, THE 

06:47:22.472 --> 06:47:26.672
CAFETERIA WORKERS, EVERYBODY, 
AND ALL OF THE HOT RHETORIC THAT

06:47:26.873 --> 06:47:35.640
HE SPOKE WITH AND THEN SIMPLY A 
FEW TIMES SAID STAY PEACEFUL. 

06:47:35.841 --> 06:47:37.841
REMEMBER, 

06:47:38.975 --> 06:47:41.045
HE SAID STAY PEACEFUL WHEN THEY 
HAD ALREADY GOTTEN VIOLENT. WHEN

06:47:41.262 --> 06:47:44.588
THEY HAD ALREADY BROUGHT 
WEAPONS. WHEN THEY HAD ALREADY 

06:47:49.604 --> 06:47:52.726
HURT PEOPLE. WHAT HE NEVER SAID 
WAS STOP THE ATTACK, LEAVE THE 

06:47:52.927 --> 06:47:54.927
CAPITAL, 

06:47:57.955 --> 06:47:59.955
LEAVITT IMMEDIATELY.

06:48:04.007 --> 06:48:06.007
AND LET ME BE CLEAR. THE 
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IN THAT 

06:48:06.097 --> 06:48:08.389
JANUARY 6th SPEECH 

06:48:12.389 --> 06:48:14.487
WAS INCENDIARY. SO, IN THE 
ENTIRE SPEECH WHICH WAS ROUGHLY 

06:48:16.350 --> 06:48:18.350
1100 WORDS, HE USED THE WORD 

06:48:22.000 --> 06:48:24.482
PEACEFUL ONCE. AND USING THE 
WORD PEACEFUL WAS THE ONLY 

06:48:24.682 --> 06:48:27.431
SUGGESTION OF NONVIOLENCE. AND 

06:48:32.285 --> 06:48:34.353
PRESIDENT TRUMP USE THE WORD 
FIGHT OR FIGHTING 20 TIMES. NOW 

06:48:34.567 --> 06:48:36.567
AGAIN, CONSIDER 

06:48:39.774 --> 06:48:41.774
THE CONTEXT

06:48:43.935 --> 06:48:46.631
. HE HAD BEEN TELLING THEM A BIG
LIE OVER AND OVER, GETTING THEM 

06:48:46.832 --> 06:48:48.832
AMPED UP, GETTING THEM ANGRY 
BECAUSE AN ELECTION HAD BEEN 

06:48:48.911 --> 06:48:51.004
STOLEN FROM THEM. THERE IS 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN FRONT OF 

06:48:51.216 --> 06:48:53.317
THEM, SOME OF THEM ARE CARRYING 
WEAPONS AND ARMS. THEY ARE 

06:48:53.537 --> 06:48:56.127
ANGRY. HE'S TELLING THEM TO 
FIGHT. IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

06:48:56.359 --> 06:49:00.038
WORDS IN THAT SPEECH JUST LIKE 
THE MOB'S ACTIONS WERE CAREFULLY

06:49:00.240 --> 06:49:02.240
CHOSEN. HIS WORDS INCITED 

06:49:05.226 --> 06:49:07.279
THEIR ACTIONS. AND HOW DO WE 
KNOW THIS? FOR MONTHS THE 

06:49:07.500 --> 06:49:10.021
PRESIDENT HAD TOLD HIS 
SUPPORTERS HIS BIG LIE THAT THE 

06:49:10.222 --> 06:49:14.161
ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND HE USED 
THE LIE TO URGE HIS SUPPORTERS 

06:49:14.361 --> 06:49:16.361
NOT TO CONCEDE AND TO STOP 

06:49:20.384 --> 06:49:22.384
THE STEEL.

06:49:28.344 --> 06:49:32.544
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU ROB A BANK ON THE WAY 
OUT THE DOOR UVL RESPECT PRIVATE

06:49:32.755 --> 06:49:37.785
PROPERTY, THAT IS NOT A DEFENSE 
TO PRY ROBBING THE BANK. 

06:49:37.786 --> 06:49:39.786
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

06:49:42.803 --> 06:49:45.033
MR. PRESIDENT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS. 

06:49:45.034 --> 06:49:47.125
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT I SEND A 
QUESTION TO THE DESK DIRECTIVE 

06:49:47.328 --> 06:49:49.328
THAT 

06:49:52.332 --> 06:49:54.332
BOTH SIDES.

06:50:27.624 --> 06:50:29.624
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS HAS A 
QUESTION FOR 

06:50:33.968 --> 06:50:36.240
BOTH SIDES. THE CLERK WILL READ 
IT AND THE HOUSE MANAGERS WILL 

06:50:36.453 --> 06:50:38.453
GO FIRST FOR 2 

06:50:42.070 --> 06:50:44.402
1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUT OF THERE 16 HOURS, THE 

06:50:44.601 --> 06:50:46.601
HOUSE 

06:50:48.996 --> 06:50:50.996
MANAGERS DEVOTED ALL OF 15 
MINUTES TO ARTICULATING A NEWLY 

06:50:51.055 --> 06:50:54.223
CREATED LEGAL STANDARD FOR 
INCITEMENT. ONE WAS 

06:50:57.342 --> 06:51:01.353
VIOLENCE FORESEEABLE? TWO, DID 
HE ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE? THREE, 

06:51:01.573 --> 06:51:03.573
DID HE DO 

06:51:07.035 --> 06:51:10.430
SO WILLFULLY? IS THIS NEW 
STANDARD DERIVED FROM THE 

06:51:10.631 --> 06:51:13.995
CRIMINAL CODE OR ANY SUPREME 
COURT CASE? WHILE VIOLENT RIOTS 

06:51:14.217 --> 06:51:19.867
WERE RAGING, KAMALA HARRIS SAID 
ON NATIONAL TV, THEY 

06:51:20.489 --> 06:51:23.172
GOING TO LET UP AND THEY SHOULD 
NOT AND SHE ALSO RAISED MONEY TO

06:51:24.665 --> 06:51:26.665
BAIL OUT 

06:51:29.478 --> 06:51:31.143
VIOLENT WRITERS. USING THE 
MANAGER'S PROPOSED STANDARD, IS 

06:51:31.144 --> 06:51:33.144
THERE ANY 

06:51:34.520 --> 06:51:36.520
COHERENT WAY FOR DONALD TRUMP'S 
WORDS TO BE INCITEMENT AND 

06:51:36.631 --> 06:51:38.631
KAMALA HARRIS'S WORDS NOT TO 

06:51:42.472 --> 06:51:44.472
BE INCITEMENT?

06:51:47.692 --> 06:51:52.254
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
SENATORS, I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH 

06:51:52.468 --> 06:51:56.816
THIS STATEMENT THAT IS BEING 
REFERRED TO BUT I FIND IT 

06:51:58.103 --> 06:52:02.074
ABSOLUTELY UNIMAGINABLE THAT 
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WOULD EVER

06:52:02.275 --> 06:52:04.275
INSIGHT VIOLENCE OR ENCOURAGE OR
PROMOTE 

06:52:08.296 --> 06:52:10.439
VIOLENCE. OBVIOUSLY IT IS 
COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO THE 

06:52:10.617 --> 06:52:12.617
PROCEEDING AT HAND AND I WILL 
ALLOW HER TO 

06:52:17.257 --> 06:52:19.257
DEFEND HERSELF.

06:52:27.419 --> 06:52:29.419
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS ARE 
POINTING OUT THAT WE HAVE NEVER 

06:52:29.533 --> 06:52:31.611
HAD ANY SITUATION LIKE THIS 
BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

06:52:31.812 --> 06:52:33.875
UNITED STATES AND ITS TRUE. 
THERE IS NEVER BEEN A PRESIDENT 

06:52:34.075 --> 06:52:36.010
WHO HAS ENCOURAGED A VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION AGAINST OUR OWN 

06:52:36.011 --> 06:52:38.121
GOVERNMENT SO WE REALLY HAVE 
NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO. SO, 

06:52:38.334 --> 06:52:40.402
WHAT WE DO IN THIS TRIAL WILL 
ESTABLISH A STANDARD GOING 

06:52:40.615 --> 06:52:42.898
FORWARD FOR ALL TIME. THERE ARE 
TWO THEORIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT 

06:52:43.098 --> 06:52:45.842
BEFORE YOU AND I THINK WE'VE GOT
TO GET PAST ALL OF THE LITTLE 

06:52:46.062 --> 06:52:48.062
CRITIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN 

06:52:51.703 --> 06:52:54.618
OFFERED TODAY ABOUT THIS OR 
THAT. LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT IS 

06:52:54.818 --> 06:52:56.686
REALLY AT STAKE HERE. THE 
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS SAY, ECHOING

06:52:56.687 --> 06:52:58.687
THE PRESIDENT, HIS CONDUCT WAS 

06:53:02.347 --> 06:53:04.347
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. IN OTHER 
WORDS, HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN. 

06:53:04.406 --> 06:53:06.683
EXACTLY WHAT HE DID IS THE NEW 
STANDARD FOR WHAT IS ALLOWABLE 

06:53:06.884 --> 06:53:09.163
FOR HIM OR ANY OTHER PRESIDENT 
WHO GETS INTO OFFICE. OUR POINT 

06:53:09.367 --> 06:53:11.266
IS THAT HIS INCITEMENT SO 
OVERWHELMS ANY POSSIBLE LEGAL 

06:53:11.267 --> 06:53:15.906
STANDARD WE HAVE THAT WE'VE GOT 
THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO DECLARE 

06:53:16.116 --> 06:53:17.787
THAT PRESIDENTIAL INCITEMENT TO 
VIOLENT INSURRECTION AGAINST THE

06:53:17.788 --> 06:53:20.543
CAPITAL AND THE CONGRESS IS 
COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN TO THE 

06:53:20.743 --> 06:53:24.746
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
UNDER THE IMPEACHMENT CLAUSES. 

06:53:24.945 --> 06:53:28.687
SO WE STEP FORTH THE ELEMENT OF 
ENCOURAGEMENT OF VIOLENCE AND WE

06:53:28.888 --> 06:53:30.888
SAW IT OVERWHELMINGLY. WE 

06:53:32.853 --> 06:53:35.571
KNOW THAT HE PICKED THE DATE OF 
THAT RALLY AND IN FACT THERE WAS

06:53:40.574 --> 06:53:43.110
ANOTHER GROUP THAT WOULD HAVE A 
RALLY ANOTHER DATE AND HE GOT IT

06:53:43.310 --> 06:53:45.202
MOVED TO JANUARY FIRST HE 
SYNCHRONIZED EXACTLY THE TIME 

06:53:45.203 --> 06:53:47.073
THAT WE WOULD BE ENJOYING 
SESSION AND AS REPRESENTATIVE 

06:53:47.074 --> 06:53:49.355
CHENEY SAID HE SUMMONED THAT 
MOB, HE ASSEMBLED THAT MOB. HE 

06:53:49.555 --> 06:53:53.971
INCITED THAT MOB. HE LIT THE 
MATCH. COME ON, GET REAL. WE 

06:53:54.171 --> 06:53:57.557
KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
AND THE SECOND THING IS THE FOR 

06:53:57.771 --> 06:54:01.521
SORRY FORESEEABILITY OF IT 
REMEMBER LANSING, MICHIGAN AND 

06:54:01.722 --> 06:54:05.700
EVERYTHING WE SHOWED YOU? THEY 
DIDN'T MANTRA MENTIONED THAT OF 

06:54:05.916 --> 06:54:07.916
COURSE. REMEMBER THE 

06:54:11.328 --> 06:54:14.972
MEGA RALLY? THEY DIDN'T MENTION 
THAT. THE VIOLENCE ALL OVER THE 

06:54:15.199 --> 06:54:18.647
RALLIES. THE PRESIDENT CHEERING 
IT ON, DELIGHTING IN IT, 

06:54:18.798 --> 06:54:22.594
EXULTING IN IT. COME ON, HOW 
GULLIBLE DO YOU THINK WE ARE? WE

06:54:22.791 --> 06:54:24.213
SAW THIS HAPPEN. WE JUST SPENT 
-- 

06:54:24.214 --> 06:54:26.214
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. 

06:54:31.471 --> 06:54:35.238
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT HAS 2 1/2 MINUTES. 

06:54:35.565 --> 06:54:37.772
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR CRUZ, I BELIEVE THE 
FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION 

06:54:38.016 --> 06:54:41.538
REFERS TO THE NEWLY CREATED 
RASKIN DOCTRINE ON 

06:54:46.448 --> 06:54:50.840
FIRST AMENDMENT AND HE JUST, IN 
HIS ANSWER, ACTUALLY GAVE YOU A 

06:54:51.041 --> 06:54:54.981
NEW ONE, APPROPRIATENESS. THE 
STANDARD THAT THIS BODY NEEDS TO

06:54:55.181 --> 06:54:59.787
FOLLOW FOR LAW IS BRANDENBURG 

06:55:03.747 --> 06:55:06.470
V OHIO AND THE THREE-PART TEST 
REALLY COMES OUT OF BIBLE 

06:55:06.670 --> 06:55:09.389
BELIEVERS VERSUS WAYNE COUNTY TO
BE SPECIFIC. THE SPEECH HAS 

06:55:14.229 --> 06:55:16.229
TO BE EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY 
ENCOURAGED THE USE OF VIOLENCE 

06:55:16.311 --> 06:55:18.311
IN OTHER WORDS DOES IT HAVE TO 
BE THE 

06:55:22.980 --> 06:55:24.980
WORDS ITSELF

06:55:33.413 --> 06:55:36.143
IT IS LUDICROUS FOR THAT TO BE 
TRUE. THIRD, THE EMINENT USE OF 

06:55:36.343 --> 06:55:38.343
VIOLENCE OR LAWLESS ACTION IS 
LIKELY TO RESULT IN SPEECH. 

06:55:38.455 --> 06:55:40.455
ALSO, THEY 

06:55:43.654 --> 06:55:46.577
FELL ON ALL THREE POINTS OF THE 
LAW AS WE KNOW IT AND NEEDS TO 

06:55:46.789 --> 06:55:49.115
BE APPLIED HERE. I DON'T KNOW 
WHY HE SAID HE NEVER HEARD 

06:55:49.325 --> 06:55:53.456
KAMALA HARRIS SAY ABOUT THE 
RIOTS AND THE PEOPLE WRITING 

06:55:56.626 --> 06:55:58.712
AND RUINING OUR BUSINESSES AND 
OUR STREETS THAT THEY ARE NOT 

06:55:58.912 --> 06:56:01.397
GOING TO LET UP AND THEY SHOULD 
NOT BECAUSE WE PLAYED IT THREE 

06:56:04.913 --> 06:56:07.848
TIMES TODAY. WE GAVE IT TO YOU 
IN AUDIO. I READ IT TO YOU AND 

06:56:08.068 --> 06:56:10.378
YOU GOT IT IN VIDEO. THAT'S WHAT
SHE SAID. BUT IT IS 

06:56:13.519 --> 06:56:15.519
PROTECTED SPEECH. HER SPEECH IS 
PROTECTED ALSO, SENATOR, THAT IS

06:56:15.598 --> 06:56:17.680
THE POINT. YOU ALL HAVE 
PRODUCTIONS AS 

06:56:22.683 --> 06:56:24.722
ELECTED OFFICIALS, THE HIGHEST 
PROTECTIONS UNDER THE FIRST 

06:56:24.937 --> 06:56:26.803
AMENDMENT AND THAT FIRST 
AMENDMENT APPLIES HERE IN THIS 

06:56:26.804 --> 06:56:31.382
CHAMBER TO THIS PROCEEDING AND 
THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KEEP 

06:56:32.663 --> 06:56:38.305
FOCUSED ON. NEED TO KEEP FOCUSED
ON WHAT IS THE LAW AND HOW DO WE

06:56:38.517 --> 06:56:43.283
APPLY IT TO THIS SET OF FACTS? 
IT IS YOUR DUTY. YOU CAN'T GET 

06:56:43.503 --> 06:56:47.920
CAUGHT UP IN ALL OF THE RHETORIC
AND FACTS THAT ARE IRRELEVANT. 

06:56:48.122 --> 06:56:51.686
YOU NEED TO KEEP FOCUSED ON WHAT
IS THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU DECIDED 

06:56:51.886 --> 06:56:56.935
BASED ON THE LAW, BRANDENBURG 
AND BIBLE BELIEVERS AND APPLY IT

06:56:57.136 --> 06:57:04.867
TO THE FACTS. AND THAT REQUIRES 
YOU TO LOOK AT THE WORDS AND 

06:57:05.087 --> 06:57:09.062
THERE WERE NO WORDS OF 
INCITEMENT OF ANY KIND. 

06:57:09.063 --> 06:57:11.988
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

06:57:16.997 --> 06:57:18.894
MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON. 

06:57:18.895 --> 06:57:20.895
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT I SEND A QUESTION 
TO THE DESK. 

06:57:44.396 --> 06:57:47.097
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR MURRAY HAS A QUESTION
FOR THE HOUSE MANAGERS, THE 

06:57:47.314 --> 06:57:49.314
CLERK WILL READ 

06:57:52.756 --> 06:57:54.756
THE QUESTION.

06:57:57.615 --> 06:57:59.695
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT SIX: 01 P.M. EASTERN TIME 
ON JANUARY SIX, PRESIDENT 

06:58:04.700 --> 06:58:08.057
TRUMP TWEETED, THESE ARE THE 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN A 

06:58:08.277 --> 06:58:10.277
SACRED LANDSLIDE ELECTION 
VICTORY IS SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY 

06:58:14.952 --> 06:58:18.291
AND VICIOUSLY STRIPPED AWAY FROM
GREAT PATRIOTS WHO HAVE BEEN 

06:58:18.491 --> 06:58:22.504
BADLY AND UNFAIRLY TREATED FOR 
SO LONG. ADDING FOR RIOTERS TO 

06:58:24.400 --> 06:58:29.217
GO HOME WITH LOVE AND IN PEACE. 
WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE OF THIS 

06:58:29.420 --> 06:58:31.420
TWEET TO PRESIDENT 

06:58:34.853 --> 06:58:36.853
TRUMP'S GUILT?

06:58:52.194 --> 06:58:54.194
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS RECOGNIZE 
FOR UP TO 

06:58:58.657 --> 06:59:00.657
FIVE MINUTES.

06:59:04.317 --> 06:59:06.317
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, 

06:59:08.076 --> 06:59:10.608
THIS WAS A KEY QUOTE AND THE KEY
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT THAT 

06:59:10.821 --> 06:59:12.821
DAY. THAT HORRIFIC 

06:59:15.847 --> 06:59:17.847
DAY. REMEMBER THE CAPITAL HAD 
BEEN STORMED, IT HAD BEEN 

06:59:17.938 --> 06:59:24.249
ATTACKED, PEOPLE HAVE YELLED 
HAYING MIKE PENCE, PEOPLE HAD 

06:59:24.450 --> 06:59:28.199
GONE AFTER SPEAKER PELOSI, 
PEOPLE BROUGHT BASEBALL BATS AND

06:59:33.213 --> 06:59:35.710
OTHER WEAPONS. MANY MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS AND SENATE IN THE HOUSE

06:59:35.931 --> 06:59:39.491
WERE FEARFUL FOR THEIR OWN 
LIVES. THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T CALL

06:59:39.691 --> 06:59:43.672
THE NATIONAL GUARD. HIS OWN 
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T LIST HIM 

06:59:43.892 --> 06:59:47.412
AS SOMEBODY THAT HIT THAT THEY 
HAD SPOKEN WITH TO ACTIVATE THE 

06:59:47.632 --> 06:59:50.547
GUARD. AND HE SAID, REMEMBER 
THIS 

06:59:55.554 --> 07:00:02.215
DAY FOREVER. SO, IF HE WAS NOT 
GUILTY OF INCITING THIS 

07:00:02.416 --> 07:00:04.519
INSURRECTION, IF THIS WAS NOT 
WHAT HE WANTED, IF IT WASN'T 

07:00:04.721 --> 07:00:07.655
WHAT HE DESIRED, BY THAT TIME 
THE CARNAGE HAD BEEN ON 

07:00:07.875 --> 07:00:09.875
TELEVISION 

07:00:11.836 --> 07:00:15.152
FOR HOURS, HE SAW WHAT WAS GOING
ON. EVERYBODY SAW WHAT WAS GOING

07:00:15.356 --> 07:00:17.886
ON. IF IT WASN'T WHAT HE WANTED,
WHY WOULD HE HAVE SAID REMEMBER 

07:00:18.087 --> 07:00:23.528
THIS DAY FOREVER? WHY 
COMMEMORATE A DAY LIKE THAT, AN 

07:00:23.748 --> 07:00:25.748
ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITAL FOR 

07:00:29.799 --> 07:00:31.799
GOD SAKE

07:00:34.440 --> 07:00:37.000
, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? UNLESS 
YOU AGREED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING

07:00:37.220 --> 07:00:39.220
TO PRAISE, NOT CONDEMN? 
SOMETHING TO HOLD UP 

07:00:42.491 --> 07:00:44.341
AND COMMEMORATE. NO CONSOLING 
THE NATION, NO REASSURING THAT 

07:00:44.342 --> 07:00:47.036
THE GOVERNMENT WAS SECURE, NOT A
SINGLE WORD THAT ENTIRE DAY 

07:00:47.237 --> 07:00:50.945
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK OR THE 
ATTACKERS OR THE VIOLENT 

07:00:51.146 --> 07:00:53.146
INSURRECTION 

07:00:56.163 --> 07:01:00.758
AGAINST CONGRESS. THIS TWEET IS 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS TWO 

07:01:00.958 --> 07:01:03.041
KEY POINTS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S 
STATE OF MIND. FIRST, THIS WAS 

07:01:03.240 --> 07:01:08.708
ENTIRELY AND COMPLETELY 
FORESEEABLE AND HE FORESAW IT. 

07:01:08.907 --> 07:01:12.745
AND HE HELPED INCITE IT. OVER 
MANY MONTHS. 

07:01:17.752 --> 07:01:20.466
HE SAYING, I TOLD YOU THIS WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU CERTIFIED

07:01:20.686 --> 07:01:22.986
THE ELECTION FOR ANYONE ELSE 
BESIDES ME. AND YOU GOT WHAT YOU

07:01:23.206 --> 07:01:26.567
DESERVED FOR TRYING TO TAKE IT 
AWAY FROM ME. AND WE KNOW THIS 

07:01:26.786 --> 07:01:28.869
BECAUSE THAT STATEMENT WAS 
ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH 

07:01:29.087 --> 07:01:32.647
EVERYTHING HE SAID LEADING UP TO
THE ATTACK. SECOND, THIS SHOWS 

07:01:32.867 --> 07:01:35.390
THAT DONALD TRUMP INTENDED AND 
REVELED 

07:01:40.397 --> 07:01:44.029
IN THIS. SENATORS, HE REVELED IN
THIS. HE DELIGHTED IN THIS. THIS

07:01:44.249 --> 07:01:46.249
IS WHAT 

07:01:49.246 --> 07:01:51.730
HE WANTED. REMEMBER THIS DAY 
FOREVER HE SAID, NOT AS A DAY OF

07:01:51.950 --> 07:01:54.873
DISGRACE AS IT IS TO ALL OF US, 
BUT AS A DAY OF CELEBRATION AND 

07:01:55.074 --> 07:01:59.871
COMMEMORATION. AND IF WE LET IT,
IF WE DON'T HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE

07:02:00.091 --> 07:02:02.171
AND SET A STRONG PRECEDENT, 
POSSIBLY A CONTINUATION 

07:02:07.185 --> 07:02:11.307
LATER ON. WE WILL OF COURSE, ALL
OF US REMEMBER THIS DAY, BUT NOT

07:02:11.513 --> 07:02:13.513
IN THE 

07:02:15.703 --> 07:02:17.793
WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTED.
WE WILL REMEMBER THE BRAVERY OF 

07:02:18.013 --> 07:02:20.013
OUR CAPITAL AND METRO POLICE 
FORCES. WE WILL REMEMBER THE 

07:02:20.124 --> 07:02:24.124
OFFICER WHO LOST HIS LIFE AND 
SADLY THE OTHERS WHO DID AS WELL

07:02:24.334 --> 07:02:27.885
AND THE DEVASTATION THAT WAS 
DONE TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF 

07:02:32.888 --> 07:02:34.888
DONALD TRUMP.

07:02:44.519 --> 07:02:46.519
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SEND A 

07:02:46.599 --> 07:02:48.599
QUESTION TO THE DESK. 

07:03:18.122 --> 07:03:23.118
THE SENATORS FROM LOUISIANA, MR.
CASSIDY HAS A QUESTION FOR BOTH 

07:03:23.318 --> 07:03:25.318
COUNSEL FOR THE 

07:03:26.917 --> 07:03:33.319
FORMER PRESIDENT AND COUNSEL FOR
THE HOUSE. THE CLERK WILL READ 

07:03:33.523 --> 07:03:35.824
IT AND COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT WILL GO FIRST FOR 2 

07:03:37.344 --> 07:03:39.506
1/2 MINUTES AND THEN THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL HAVE 2 

07:03:43.669 --> 07:03:45.669
1/2 

07:03:47.205 --> 07:03:48.208
MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR TOETERVILLE REPORTS 

07:03:48.209 --> 07:03:50.209
THAT HE SPOKE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
AT 

07:03:53.875 --> 07:03:56.586
215 P.M.. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT 
THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD JUST

07:03:56.806 --> 07:03:58.806
EVACUATED. I PRESUME IT WAS 
UNDERSTOOD AT 

07:04:01.387 --> 07:04:03.387
THIS TIME THAT RIOTERS HAD 
ENTERED THE CAPITAL AND THREATEN

07:04:03.468 --> 07:04:06.808
THE SAFETY OF SENATORS AND THE 
VICE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER 

07:04:07.008 --> 07:04:09.008
HEARING 

07:04:10.584 --> 07:04:12.584
OF THIS, ATTU: 24 P.M., 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED 

07:04:16.792 --> 07:04:18.892
THAT MIKE PENCE LACKED COURAGE. 
HE DID NOT CALL FOR LAW 

07:04:19.093 --> 07:04:24.310
ENFORCEMENT BACKUP UNTIL THEN. 
THE TWEET AND LACK OF RESPONSE 

07:04:24.510 --> 07:04:26.510
SUGGESTS PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT
CARE THAT VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 

07:04:28.270 --> 07:04:31.371
WAS ENDANGERED. OR THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT WAS OVERWHELMED. 

07:04:31.591 --> 07:04:36.252
DOES THIS SHOW THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS TOLERANT OF THE 

07:04:36.452 --> 07:04:40.011
INTIMIDATION OF VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE? 

07:04:40.012 --> 07:04:43.533
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COUNCIL HAVE 2 1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

07:04:46.655 --> 07:04:50.223
DIRECTLY, NO. BUT, I DISPUTE THE
PREMISE OF 

07:04:53.754 --> 07:04:56.024
YOUR FAX. I DISPUTE THE FACTS 
THAT ARE LAID OUT IN QUESTION. 

07:04:58.355 --> 07:05:00.656
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT 
GOING TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE 

07:05:00.869 --> 07:05:04.657
FACTS IN THIS PROCEEDING BECAUSE
THE HOUSE DID NOTHING TO 

07:05:04.870 --> 07:05:06.870
INVESTIGATE WHAT 

07:05:08.617 --> 07:05:10.701
WENT ON. WE ARE TRYING TO GET 
HEARSAY FROM MR. TURBERVILLE 

07:05:12.992 --> 07:05:18.197
THAT WAS HEARSAY FROM MR. LEE I 
THINK IT WAS TWO NIGHTS AGO 

07:05:18.398 --> 07:05:20.681
WHERE WE ENDED WHERE MR. LEE WAS
ACCUSED OF MAKING A STATEMENT 

07:05:20.883 --> 07:05:26.278
THAT HE NEVER MADE. BUT IT WAS A
REPORT FROM A PORTER FROM A 

07:05:26.479 --> 07:05:28.559
FRIEND OF SOMEBODY WHO HAD SOME 
HEARSAY THAT THEY HEARD THE 

07:05:30.039 --> 07:05:32.531
NIGHT BEFORE AT A BAR SOMEWHERE.
I MEAN THAT IS REALLY THE KIND 

07:05:32.731 --> 07:05:35.197
OF EVIDENCE THAT THE HOUSE HAS 
BROUGHT BEFORE US AND SO I HAVE 

07:05:35.400 --> 07:05:38.965
A PROBLEM WITH THE FACTS IN THE 
QUESTION BECAUSE I HAVE 

07:05:42.140 --> 07:05:44.461
NO IDEA AND NOBODY FROM THE 
HOUSE HAS GIVEN US ANY 

07:05:44.662 --> 07:05:46.662
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE 

07:05:49.460 --> 07:05:51.981
ANY IDEA. BUT MR. TRUMP AND MR. 
PENCE HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD 

07:05:52.182 --> 07:05:54.182
RELATIONSHIP FOR A LONG TIME AND

07:05:58.202 --> 07:06:03.103
I'M SURE MR. TRUMP VERY MUCH IS 
CONCERNED AND WAS CONCERNED FOR 

07:06:03.323 --> 07:06:05.414
THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF MR.
PENCE AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT 

07:06:05.628 --> 07:06:07.628
WAS OVER HERE. 

07:06:10.043 --> 07:06:11.703
THANK YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MANAGERS POWER OF THE HOUSE, 

07:06:11.704 --> 07:06:13.704
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE 2 1/2 

07:06:17.365 --> 07:06:20.858
MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. YOU 

07:06:21.058 --> 07:06:23.337
KNOW MY COUNSEL SAID BEFORE THIS
HAS BEEN MY WORST EXPERIENCE IN 

07:06:23.545 --> 07:06:25.835
WASHINGTON AND FOR THAT I GUESS 
WE'RE SORRY BUT MAN YOU SHOULD 

07:06:26.036 --> 07:06:28.365
HAVE BEEN HERE ON JANUARY SIX. 
SO, THE COUNSEL FOR THE 

07:06:28.567 --> 07:06:30.667
PRESIDENT KEEP BLAMING THE HOUSE
FOR NOT HAVING THE EVIDENCE THAT

07:06:31.706 --> 07:06:34.599
IS WITHIN THE SOLE POSSESSION OF
THEIR CLIENT WHO WE INVITED TO 

07:06:34.798 --> 07:06:36.798
COME AND TESTIFY IT 

07:06:40.409 --> 07:06:42.967
LAST WEEK. WE SENT A LETTER ON 
FEBRUARY FOURTH I SENT IT 

07:06:43.181 --> 07:06:45.181
DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
INVITING HIM TO 

07:06:47.984 --> 07:06:50.468
COME INTO EXPLAIN AND FILL IN 
THE GAPS OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT 

07:06:50.688 --> 07:06:54.128
WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND THEY 
SENT BACK A CONTEMPTUOUS 

07:06:54.328 --> 07:06:56.599
RESPONSE JUST A FEW HOURS LATER 
I THINK THEY MAY BE EVEN 

07:06:56.799 --> 07:06:58.799
RESPONDED MORE QUICKLY TO MY 
LETTER THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP DID 

07:06:58.950 --> 07:07:02.139
AS A COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO THE 
INVASION AND THE STORMING OF THE

07:07:02.359 --> 07:07:04.359
CAPITAL OF THE 

07:07:07.780 --> 07:07:10.611
UNITED STATES. 

07:07:14.165 --> 07:07:16.165
IT SUPPORTS A STRONG ADVERSE 
INFERENCE. WHAT 

07:07:20.393 --> 07:07:23.772
IS THAT? IF YOU DON'T TESTIFY IN
A CRIMINAL CASE IT CAN'T BE USED

07:07:23.992 --> 07:07:27.172
AGAINST YOU. EVERYBODY KNOWS 
THAT. BUT IF IT IS A CIVIL CASE 

07:07:27.387 --> 07:07:31.513
AND YOU PLEAD THE FIFTH OR YOU 
DON'T SHOW UP, THEN ACCORDING TO

07:07:31.733 --> 07:07:34.033
THE JUSTICE AND THE REST OF THE 
SUPREME COURT YOU CAN INTERPRET 

07:07:34.253 --> 07:07:36.253
EVERY DISPUTED FACTS AGAINST 

07:07:38.705 --> 07:07:42.888
THE DEFENDANT. THAT IS TOTALLY 
AVAILABLE TO US. SO, FOR 

07:07:43.089 --> 07:07:45.177
EXAMPLE, IF WE SAY THE PRESIDENT
WAS MISSING IN ACTION FOR 

07:07:45.834 --> 07:07:48.114
SEVERAL HOURS AND HE WAS IN HIS 
DUTY AND HE DESERTED HIS 

07:07:53.115 --> 07:07:56.475
DUTY OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND 
WE SAY THAT AS INSIDER IN CHIEF 

07:07:56.719 --> 07:07:58.719
HE DIDN'T CALL OFF THUGS AND 
THEY SAY HE WAS REALLY DOING 

07:07:58.856 --> 07:08:01.192
WHATEVER HE CAN IF YOU ARE 
PUZZLED ABOUT THAT YOU CAN 

07:08:01.336 --> 07:08:03.090
RESOLVE THAT DISPUTE, FACTUAL 
DISPUTE AGAINST THE DEFENDANT 

07:08:03.091 --> 07:08:06.452
WHO REFUSED IT TO COME TO A 
CIVIL PROCEEDING. HE WILL NOT 

07:08:06.667 --> 07:08:09.417
SPEND ONE DAY IN JAIL IF YOU 
CONVICT HIM. THIS IS NOT A 

07:08:09.637 --> 07:08:11.947
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. THIS IS 
ABOUT PRESERVING THE REPUBLIC 

07:08:16.962 --> 07:08:18.962
DEAR SENATE.

07:08:20.923 --> 07:08:22.923
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 
SETTING STANDARDS OF CONDUCT FOR

07:08:23.014 --> 07:08:25.076
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES SO THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO 

07:08:25.276 --> 07:08:27.799
US AGAIN SO RATHER THAN YELLING 
AT US AND SCREAMING ABOUT HOW WE

07:08:27.999 --> 07:08:30.926
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET ALL OF 
THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT YOUR CLIENT

07:08:31.125 --> 07:08:33.125
DID, BRING YOUR CLIENT UP HERE 
AND HAVE HIM TESTIFY 

07:08:38.040 --> 07:08:40.040
UNDER OATH

07:08:43.039 --> 07:08:45.039
ABOUT WHY HE WAS SENDING OUT 
TWEETS DENOUNCING THE VICE 

07:08:45.131 --> 07:08:47.131
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WHILE THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS 

07:08:47.225 --> 07:08:49.713
BEING HUNTED DOWN BY A MOB THAT 
WANTED TO HANG HIM AND WAS 

07:08:49.926 --> 07:08:52.018
CHANTING IN THIS BUILDING, HANG 
MIKE PENCE, HANG MY MIKE PENCE, 

07:08:52.218 --> 07:08:54.076
TRADER, TRADER, TRADER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TIME IS UP. NEXT QUESTION. 

07:08:54.077 --> 07:08:56.563
THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. SENATOR I SENT A QUESTION

07:08:56.782 --> 07:08:58.782
TO 

07:09:00.126 --> 07:09:02.126
THE HOUSE. 

07:09:26.189 --> 07:09:28.316
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
HAS A QUESTION FOR THE HOUSE 

07:09:28.517 --> 07:09:30.517
MANAGERS. THE CLERK 

07:09:33.947 --> 07:09:37.867
WILL REPORT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WOULD THE PRESIDENT BE MADE 

07:09:38.077 --> 07:09:41.002
AWARE OF THE FBI AND 
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION OF A 

07:09:44.367 --> 07:09:46.367
POSSIBLE ATTACK AND WOULD THE 
PRESIDENT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT

07:09:46.460 --> 07:09:50.245
PREPARING TO PROTECT THE CAPITAL
AND ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS OF 

07:09:50.448 --> 07:09:52.749
GOVERNMENT WITH NATIONAL GUARD 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AS HE DID 

07:09:52.969 --> 07:09:57.849
WHEN HE APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE
ST. JOHN'S 

07:10:02.870 --> 07:10:04.870
EPISCOPAL CHURCH?

07:10:20.412 --> 07:10:24.162
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW. PRESIDENT

07:10:24.385 --> 07:10:26.493
OF THE UNITED STATES, OUR 
COMMANDER 

07:10:29.913 --> 07:10:32.230
IN CHIEF, ITS DAILY BRIEFINGS ON
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY

07:10:32.433 --> 07:10:39.623
THAT HE HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT. 
ADDITIONALLY, THE PRESIDENT 

07:10:39.833 --> 07:10:43.170
WOULD HAVE KNOWN JUST LIKE THE 
REST OF US KNOW ALL OF THE 

07:10:43.370 --> 07:10:45.370
REPORTS THAT WERE OUT THERE AND 

07:10:47.624 --> 07:10:51.415
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. HOW MANY OF 
YOU RECEIVED CALLS SAYING TO BE 

07:10:51.635 --> 07:10:53.635
CAREFUL ON JANUARY SIXTH? TO BE 
CAREFUL 

07:10:57.916 --> 07:10:59.916
THAT THEY?

07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:05.136
I'M SEEING REPORTS. IT DOESN'T 
SEEM SAFE. HOW MUCH MORE OF THE 

07:11:05.356 --> 07:11:07.497
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? 
DONALD TRUMP IS OUR COMMANDER IN

07:11:07.717 --> 07:11:09.997
CHIEF ABSOLUTELY HAD A DUTY AND 
A SWORN OATH TO PRESERVE, 

07:11:10.217 --> 07:11:14.812
PROTECT AND DEFEND US AND TO DO 
THE SAME FOR THE OFFICERS UNDER 

07:11:15.213 --> 07:11:18.158
HIS COMMAND. AND HE WAS NOT JUST
OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, HE 

07:11:18.358 --> 07:11:23.678
INCITED THE ATTACK. THE 
INSURGENTS WERE FOLLOWING HIS 

07:11:23.898 --> 07:11:26.600
COMMANDS AS WE SAW WHEN WE READ 
ALOUD HIS TWEET ATTACKING THE 

07:11:28.718 --> 07:11:32.058
VICE PRESIDENT. AND WITH REGARD 
TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, I'M SURE 

07:11:32.256 --> 07:11:34.759
THEY DID HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP BUT WE ALL KNOW 

07:11:34.979 --> 07:11:36.979
WHAT 

07:11:39.858 --> 07:11:42.160
CAN HAPPEN TO ONE WHO HAS A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 

07:11:42.380 --> 07:11:44.701
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING 
THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE. I'M SURE 

07:11:44.921 --> 07:11:47.440
SOME OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED 
THAT WHEN HE TURNS AGAINST YOU 

07:11:47.660 --> 07:11:49.660
AFTER YOU DON'T FOLLOW 

07:11:51.961 --> 07:11:53.961
HIS COMMAND. YOU HEARD FROM MY 
COLLEAGUES THAT WHEN PLANNING 

07:11:54.061 --> 07:11:55.720
THIS ATTACK, THE INSURGENTS 
PREDICTED THAT DONALD TRUMP 

07:11:55.721 --> 07:11:57.721
WOULD COMMAND THE NATIONAL GUARD
TO 

07:12:00.321 --> 07:12:02.616
HELP THEM. WELL, HE DIDN'T DO 
MUCH BETTER. HE MAY NOT HAVE 

07:12:02.817 --> 07:12:05.318
COMMANDED THE GUARD TO HELP THEM
BUT IT TOOK WAY, WAY TOO LONG 

07:12:05.522 --> 07:12:08.705
FOR HIM TO COMMAND THE GUARD TO 
HELP US. THIS IS ALL CONNECTED. 

07:12:08.906 --> 07:12:10.906
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

07:12:12.743 --> 07:12:16.503
FREE SPEECH. THIS WAS A PATTERN 
IN PRACTICE OF MONTHS OF 

07:12:16.723 --> 07:12:20.443
ACTIVITY. THAT IS THE 
INCITEMENT, THAT IS THE 

07:12:20.663 --> 07:12:22.663
INCITEMENT, THE ACTIVITY HE WAS 
ENGAGED IN FOR MONTHS BEFORE 

07:12:24.864 --> 07:12:27.596
JANUARY SIXTH, NOT JUST THE 
SPEECH ON JANUARY SIX. ALL OF IT

07:12:27.810 --> 07:12:30.322
IN ITS TOTALITY AS A DERELICTION

07:12:34.312 --> 07:12:36.585
OF DUTY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AGAINST THE PEOPLE

07:12:36.786 --> 07:12:38.786
WHO ELECTED HIM, ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE OF 

07:12:43.712 --> 07:12:45.712
THIS COUNTRY. 

07:12:49.117 --> 07:12:52.507
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM ALASKA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT I SENT A 

07:12:52.727 --> 07:12:54.727
QUESTION TO THE DESK FOR THE 
FORMER PRESIDENTS COUNCIL. 

07:13:30.993 --> 07:13:33.187
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR OF ALASKA, SENATOR 
SULLIVAN HAS A QUESTION FOR THE 

07:13:33.327 --> 07:13:37.274
HOUSE COUNSEL AND THE CLERK WILL
REPORT THE 

07:13:40.691 --> 07:13:42.691
QUESTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

07:13:45.919 --> 07:13:48.032
MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENTS 

07:13:48.232 --> 07:13:50.531
COUNCIL, SORRY ABOUT THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 

07:13:50.532 --> 07:13:54.099
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGER SAID 
YESTERDAY THAT DUE PROCESS 

07:13:57.675 --> 07:14:01.850
IS DISCRETIONARY, MEANING THE 
HOUSE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

07:14:02.050 --> 07:14:04.354
AND INDEED DID NOT PROVIDE IN 
THIS SNAP IMPEACHMENT ANY 

07:14:06.846 --> 07:14:08.846
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS TO A 
DEFENDANT IN THE HOUSE 

07:14:11.434 --> 07:14:13.108
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS. AND 
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR 

07:14:13.109 --> 07:14:15.109
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER OF THIS
NEW 

07:14:18.477 --> 07:14:20.374
HOUSE PRECEDENT COMBINED WITH 
THE SENATE'S POWER TO DISQUALIFY

07:14:20.375 --> 07:14:22.375
FROM PUBLIC OFFICE A PRIVATE 
CITIZEN AND AN 

07:14:25.835 --> 07:14:29.033
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COUNSEL HAS FIVE MINUTES. 

07:14:29.233 --> 07:14:32.636
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A COMPLICATED 
QUESTION. COULD I HAVE THAT READ

07:14:36.897 --> 07:14:38.416
AGAIN PLEASE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS SAID 

07:14:38.417 --> 07:14:43.710
YESTERDAY THAT DUE PROCESS IS 
DISCRETIONARY, MEANING THE HOUSE

07:14:43.910 --> 07:14:45.910
IS 

07:14:48.938 --> 07:14:51.378
NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AND 
INDEED DID NOT PROVIDE IN THIS 

07:14:51.579 --> 07:14:53.037
SNAP IMPEACHMENT, ANY 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS TO A 

07:14:53.038 --> 07:14:56.439
DEFENDANT IN HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS. WHAT ARE THE 

07:14:56.659 --> 07:14:58.659
IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR 

07:15:01.489 --> 07:15:03.361
CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER OF THIS NEW
HOUSE PRECEDENT COMBINED WITH 

07:15:03.362 --> 07:15:05.459
THE SENATE'S POWER TO DISQUALIFY
FROM PUBLIC OFFICE A PRIVATE 

07:15:05.670 --> 07:15:08.199
CITIZEN AND AN IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL? 

07:15:08.200 --> 07:15:12.441
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, FIRST OF ALL, DUE 
PROCESS IS 

07:15:18.381 --> 07:15:23.028
GOOD LORD. THE CONSTITUTION 
REQUIRES THAT THE ACCUSED HAVE 

07:15:23.228 --> 07:15:28.523
THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS BECAUSE
THE POWER THAT A PROSECUTOR HAS 

07:15:28.724 --> 07:15:31.522
TO TAKE SOMEBODY'S LIBERTY WHEN 
THEY ARE 

07:15:35.723 --> 07:15:40.183
PROSECUTING THEM IS THE ULTIMATE
THING THAT WE TRY TO SAVE. IN 

07:15:40.403 --> 07:15:42.523
THIS CASE, JUST NOW, IN THE LAST
TWO HOURS, WE'VE HAD 

07:15:47.544 --> 07:15:49.974
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. WHAT 
THEY JUST TRIED TO DO WAS SAY 

07:15:50.194 --> 07:15:52.304
THAT IT IS OUR BURDEN TO BRING 
THEM EVIDENCE TO PROVE 

07:15:56.144 --> 07:15:58.831
THEIR CASE AND IT IS NOT. IT IS 
NOT OUR BURDEN TO BRING ANY 

07:15:59.031 --> 07:16:01.545
EVIDENCE FORWARD AT ALL. WHAT IS
THE DANGER? WELL, THE DANGER IS 

07:16:02.204 --> 07:16:04.204
PRETTY OBVIOUS. IF A 

07:16:06.321 --> 07:16:09.685
MAJORITY PARTY DOESN'T LIKE 
SOMEBODY IN THE MINORITY PARTY 

07:16:09.885 --> 07:16:14.976
AND THEY ARE AFRAID THEY MAY 
LOSE THE ELECTION OR IF IT IS 

07:16:15.196 --> 07:16:18.186
SOMEBODY IN THE MAJORITY PARTY 
AND THERE IS A PRIVATE CITIZEN 

07:16:18.386 --> 07:16:22.607
WHO WANTS TO RUN AGAINST 
SOMEBODY IN THE MAJORITY PARTY, 

07:16:22.807 --> 07:16:26.403
WELL, THEY CAN SIMPLY BRING 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND OF 

07:16:26.607 --> 07:16:31.068
COURSE WITHOUT DUE PROCESS, THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO BE ENTITLED TO 

07:16:31.277 --> 07:16:33.807
A LAWYER, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 
BE ENTITLED TO HAVE NOTICE OF 

07:16:34.027 --> 07:16:38.528
THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM. IT 
PUTS US INTO A POSITION WHERE WE

07:16:38.748 --> 07:16:43.365
ARE THE KIND OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
AND GOVERNING 

07:16:46.428 --> 07:16:51.109
BODY THAT WE ARE ALL VERY, VERY 
AFRAID OF. FROM WHAT WE LEFT 

07:16:51.329 --> 07:16:57.845
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO AND WHAT 
REGIMES ALL AROUND THIS WORLD 

07:16:58.046 --> 07:17:00.046
THAT 

07:17:02.267 --> 07:17:05.811
ENDANGER US, THAT IS HOW THEY 
ACT. THAT IS HOW THEY CONDUCT 

07:17:06.011 --> 07:17:08.011
THEMSELVES WITHOUT GIVING THE 
ACCUSED DUE PROCESS, TAKING 

07:17:09.195 --> 07:17:11.267
THEIR LIBERTY, WITHOUT GIVING 
THEM JUST 

07:17:15.736 --> 07:17:18.033
A BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT UNDER 
THE FIFTH TO THE 14th APPLIED TO

07:17:18.233 --> 07:17:25.512
THE STATES DUE PROCESS. IF YOU 
TAKE AWAY DUE PROCESS IN THIS 

07:17:25.731 --> 07:17:27.731
COUNTRY, FROM 

07:17:30.202 --> 07:17:32.526
THE ACCUSED, IF YOU TAKE THAT 
AWAY, THERE WILL BE NO JUSTICE 

07:17:34.412 --> 07:17:40.533
AND NOBODY, NOBODY WILL BE SAFE.
BUT, IT IS PATENTLY UNFAIR FOR 

07:17:40.753 --> 07:17:42.894
THE HOUSE MANAGERS TO BRING AN 
IMPEACHMENT 

07:17:46.485 --> 07:17:50.455
PROCEEDING WITHOUT ANY, AGAIN, 
WITHOUT ANY INVESTIGATION AT ALL

07:17:50.655 --> 07:17:55.040
AND THEN STAND UP HERE AND SAY, 
ONE, THEY HAD A CHANCE TO BRING 

07:17:56.114 --> 07:17:58.114
US EVIDENCE. 

07:18:00.194 --> 07:18:05.869
AND TWO, LET'S, LET'S, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT FLIPPING 

07:18:08.415 --> 07:18:10.559
AROUND SOMEBODIES OTHER 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO HAVING 

07:18:11.575 --> 07:18:13.575
A LAWYER OR 

07:18:16.678 --> 07:18:21.336
TO HAVING -- TO SEE THE EVIDENCE
AT ALL. IT JUST GETS BROUGHT IN 

07:18:21.537 --> 07:18:23.537
WITHOUT ANYBODY HAVING AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW IT 

07:18:26.132 --> 07:18:28.657
BEFORE HAND. THEY ACTUALLY SENT 
IT TO US ON THE NINTH, THE DAY 

07:18:28.877 --> 07:18:35.154
AFTER WE STARTED THIS. SO, IT IS
A REALLY BIG PROBLEM. THE DUE 

07:18:35.354 --> 07:18:37.458
PROCESS CLAUSE APPLIES TO THIS 

07:18:42.378 --> 07:18:44.378
IMPEACHMENT HEARING AND IT HAS 
BEEN SEVERELY AND EXTREMELY 

07:18:44.458 --> 07:18:49.888
VIOLATED. THIS PROCESS IS SO 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT 

07:18:50.088 --> 07:18:52.088
VIOLATES 

07:18:53.639 --> 07:18:55.719
DUE PROCESS. AND I'M NOT EVEN 
GOING TO GET INTO THE 

07:18:56.799 --> 07:18:58.799
JURISDICTIONAL PART. THE DUE 
PROCESS PART SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO

07:18:59.599 --> 07:19:01.458
GIVE ANYBODY WHO LOVES OUR 
CONSTITUTION AND LOVES OUR 

07:19:01.459 --> 07:19:07.760
COUNTRY GREAT PAUSE TO DO 
ANYTHING BUT ACQUIT DONALD 

07:19:07.960 --> 07:19:09.960
TRUMP. 

07:19:12.656 --> 07:19:14.656
THANK YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. 

07:19:19.501 --> 07:19:21.460
PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT I SENT A 

07:19:21.461 --> 07:19:23.461
QUESTION TO THE DESK FOR THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS. 

07:19:50.667 --> 07:19:53.484
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT 
HAS A QUESTION FOR THE HOUSE 

07:19:53.684 --> 07:19:55.684
MANAGERS AND THE CLERK WILL 
REPORT 

07:19:59.747 --> 07:20:01.747
THE QUESTION.

07:20:04.245 --> 07:20:08.710
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
HIS ATTORNEYS HAVE CITED THE 

07:20:08.910 --> 07:20:10.910
BRANDENBURG V OHIO CASE IN 
SUPPORT OF THEIR ARGUMENT THAT 

07:20:11.011 --> 07:20:13.011
THE FIRST AMENDMENT 

07:20:14.786 --> 07:20:16.252
PROTECTS TRUMP. DID THE 
BRANDENBURG CASE PROHIBIT 

07:20:16.253 --> 07:20:19.607
HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICIALS 
ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH THE 

07:20:19.808 --> 07:20:21.808
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS FOR THE 
INCITEMENT 

07:20:25.647 --> 07:20:27.647
OF VIOLENCE?

07:20:33.587 --> 07:20:38.407
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT, 
SENATORS. SO, LET'S START WITH 

07:20:41.987 --> 07:20:43.987
THE LETTER OF MORE THAN 140 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSORS, 

07:20:44.048 --> 07:20:50.628
WHICH I THINK THEY DESCRIBED AS 
PARTISAN. IN NATURE. THAT IS A 

07:20:50.848 --> 07:20:52.963
SLUR ON THE LAW PROFESSORS AND I
HOPE THAT THEY WOULD 

07:20:57.969 --> 07:20:59.969
WITHDRAW THAT

07:21:04.609 --> 07:21:06.569
. THERE ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE 
LUMINARIES ON THAT LIST 

07:21:06.570 --> 07:21:08.289
INCLUDING THE COFOUNDER OF THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY, RONALD 

07:21:08.290 --> 07:21:10.009
REAGAN'S FORMER SOLICITOR 
GENERAL, CHARLES FREED AS WELL 

07:21:10.010 --> 07:21:11.549
AS PROMINENT LAW PROFESSORS 
ACROSS THE INTELLECTUAL 

07:21:11.550 --> 07:21:13.910
AUDIOLOGICAL AND SPECTRUM AND 
THEY ALL CALLED THEIR FIRST 

07:21:14.110 --> 07:21:16.930
AMENDMENTS TO LILES WHICH THEY 
ARE. NOW, THEY'VE RETREATED TO 

07:21:17.131 --> 07:21:19.131
THE 

07:21:20.990 --> 07:21:23.371
POSITION OF BRANDENBURG 

07:21:28.391 --> 07:21:31.533
VERSUS OHIO. EVEN ON THAT 
STANDARD THIS GROUP OF LAW 

07:21:31.745 --> 07:21:33.825
PROFESSORS SAID THERE IS A VERY 
STRONG ARGUMENT THAT HE'S GUILTY

07:21:34.026 --> 07:21:40.362
EVEN UNDER THE STRICT STANDARD, 
WHY?  BECAUSE HE INCITED 

07:21:40.553 --> 07:21:42.553
IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION AND HE 
INTENDED TO 

07:21:46.592 --> 07:21:49.573
DO IT HOW DO WE KNOW HE WAS 
LIKELY TO CAUSE IT? HE DID CAUSE

07:21:49.793 --> 07:21:54.132
IT. THEY OVERRAN THE CAPITAL. 
RIGHT? EVEN IF YOU WANT TO HOLD 

07:21:54.333 --> 07:21:56.333
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA TO FORGET 

07:21:56.464 --> 07:21:58.573
ABOUT HIS CONSTITUTIONAL OATH OF
OFFICE AS I SAID BEFORE THAT 

07:21:58.793 --> 07:22:03.399
WOULD BE A DERELICTION ON OUR 
PART IF WE SET ALL WE ARE GOING 

07:22:03.613 --> 07:22:06.370
TO DO IS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES LIKE ONE OF THE 

07:22:06.574 --> 07:22:10.634
PEOPLE HE SUMMONED TO WASHINGTON
TO COMMIT INSURRECTION AGAINST 

07:22:10.834 --> 07:22:15.354
US. OKAY. THE PRESIDENT SWORE TO
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND PRETEND 

07:22:15.555 --> 07:22:17.555
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

07:22:21.385 --> 07:22:23.385
UNITED STATES.

07:22:26.735 --> 07:22:28.735
HE DOESN'T SAY GO AHEAD 

07:22:30.921 --> 07:22:33.276
AND SHOUT FIRE IN A CROWDED 
THEATER HE SUMMONS THE MOB AND 

07:22:33.495 --> 07:22:35.495
SEND THEM 

07:22:37.956 --> 07:22:40.256
TO GO BURN THE THEATER DOWN AND 
WHEN THEY START MADLY CALLING 

07:22:40.470 --> 07:22:42.978
THEM AND RINGING ALARM BELLS HE 
WATCHES IT ON TV AND HE TAKES 

07:22:43.180 --> 07:22:45.757
HIS SWEET TIME FOR SEVERAL HOURS
HE TURNS UP THE HEAT ON THE 

07:22:45.977 --> 07:22:50.457
DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF WHO HE'S A 
MATTER THAT BECAUSE HE'S NOT 

07:22:50.677 --> 07:22:52.677
MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO 
PURSUE HIS POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.

07:22:54.497 --> 07:22:57.237
AND THEN WHEN WE SAY WE DON'T 
WANT YOU TO BE FIRE CHIEF EVER 

07:22:57.438 --> 07:22:59.438
AGAIN, HE STARTS CRYING ABOUT 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT. BRANDENBURG

07:22:59.818 --> 07:23:02.137
WAS A CASE ABOUT A BUNCH OF 
KLANSMEN WHO ASSEMBLED IN A 

07:23:02.338 --> 07:23:04.338
FIELD AND 

07:23:07.578 --> 07:23:11.638
THEY WEREN'T NEAR ANYBODY SUCH 
THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY DO 

07:23:11.859 --> 07:23:13.859
VIOLENT DAMAGE TO PEOPLE BUT 
THEY SAID SOME PRETTY REPULSIVE,

07:23:14.039 --> 07:23:16.039
RACIST THINGS BUT THE SUPREME 
COURT SAID THEY WEREN'T INCITING

07:23:18.719 --> 07:23:20.799
IN AN IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION 
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T HAVE A MOB 

07:23:20.999 --> 07:23:23.326
FOR EXAMPLE BREAK OUT THE WAY 
THIS MODEL BROKE OUT AND TOOK 

07:23:23.539 --> 07:23:25.939
OVER THE CAPITAL OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. AND BY THE 

07:23:26.140 --> 07:23:28.740
WAY, DON'T COMPARE HIM TO ONE OF
THOSE KLANSMEN IN THE FIELD 

07:23:28.960 --> 07:23:30.960
ASSERTING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT 
RIGHTS. ASSUME THAT HE WERE THE 

07:23:31.139 --> 07:23:33.760
CHIEF OF POLICE OF THE TOWN WHO 
WENT DOWN TO THAT RALLY AND 

07:23:33.980 --> 07:23:35.980
STARTED CALLING FOR, YOU KNOW, 

07:23:39.880 --> 07:23:41.880
A RALLY

07:23:43.630 --> 07:23:45.630
OF THE CITY HALL AND THEN 
NURTURING THAT MOB, CULTIVATING 

07:23:45.781 --> 07:23:48.161
THAT MOB, PULLING THEM IN OVER 
PERIOD OF WEEKS AND DAYS, NAMING

07:23:48.371 --> 07:23:50.675
THE DATE AND THE TIME AND THE 
PLACE, RILING THEM UP BEFORE 

07:23:50.876 --> 07:23:54.321
HAND AND THEN JUST SAYING BE MY 
GUEST, GO AND STOP THE STEAL. 

07:23:54.541 --> 07:23:58.376
COME ON. BACK TO TOM PAINE, USE 
YOUR COMMON SENSE. USE YOUR 

07:23:58.586 --> 07:24:00.902
COMMON SENSE. THAT IS THE 
STANDARD OF PROOF WE WANT. THEY 

07:24:01.120 --> 07:24:03.120
ARE ALREADY TREATING THEIR 
CLIENT LIKE HE IS 

07:24:06.822 --> 07:24:08.701
A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT. THEY'RE 
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT BEYOND A 

07:24:08.702 --> 07:24:10.702
REASONABLE DOUBT. THEY THINK WE 
ARE MAKING A CRIMINAL 

07:24:15.433 --> 07:24:17.433
CASE HERE.

07:24:19.153 --> 07:24:21.444
MY FRIENDS, THE FORMER PRESIDENT
IS NOT GOING TO SPEND ONE HOUR 

07:24:21.664 --> 07:24:23.783
OR ONE MINUTE IN JAIL. THIS IS 
ABOUT PROTECTING OUR REPUBLIC 

07:24:24.002 --> 07:24:26.002
AND DEFINING THE STANDARDS OF 
PRESIDENTIAL CONDUCT AND IF YOU 

07:24:26.084 --> 07:24:28.084
WANT THIS TO BE A STANDARD FOR 
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE PRESIDENTIAL

07:24:28.236 --> 07:24:30.563
CONDUCT GOING FORWARD, BE MY 
GUEST, BUT WE ARE HEADED FOR A 

07:24:30.773 --> 07:24:35.483
DAY VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF 
COUNTRY AT THAT POINT. 

07:24:35.484 --> 07:24:41.044
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM KANSAS. 

07:24:41.045 --> 07:24:43.545
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SENT A QUESTION TO THE 
DESK. 

07:25:11.838 --> 07:25:16.948
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM KANSAS, MR. 
MARSHALL HAS A QUESTION FOR THE 

07:25:17.168 --> 07:25:21.008
COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT. THE CLERK WILL READ 

07:25:25.468 --> 07:25:28.912
THE QUESTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS SINGLE 

07:25:29.128 --> 07:25:33.649
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT IS 
CENTERED ON THE ACCUSATION THAT 

07:25:33.869 --> 07:25:39.240
PRESIDENT TRUMP SINGULARLY 
INCITED A CROWD INTO A RIOT. 

07:25:39.441 --> 07:25:41.441
DIDN'T THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
CONTRADICT THEIR 

07:25:44.789 --> 07:25:46.648
OWN CHARGE BY OUTLINING THE 
PREMEDITATED NATURE AND PLANNING

07:25:46.649 --> 07:25:49.407
OF THIS EVENT AND BY ALSO 
SHOWING THE CROWD WAS GATHERED 

07:25:49.609 --> 07:25:51.609
AT 

07:25:53.509 --> 07:25:55.394
THE CAPITAL EVEN BEFORE THE 
SPEECH STARTED? AND BARRIERS 

07:25:55.395 --> 07:25:58.610
WERE PUSHED OVER SOME 20 MINUTES
BEFORE THE CONCLUSION OF 

07:25:58.830 --> 07:26:00.830
PRESIDENT 

07:26:03.850 --> 07:26:05.850
TRUMP'S SPEECH?

07:26:22.011 --> 07:26:26.412
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
CONTRADICTED THEIR OWN CHARGE BY

07:26:26.632 --> 07:26:31.118
OUTLINING THE PREMEDITATED 
NATURE AND PLANNING OF THIS 

07:26:31.320 --> 07:26:33.453
EVENT AND BY ALSO SHOWING THE 
CROWD GATHERED AT THE CAPITAL 

07:26:36.632 --> 07:26:38.632
EVEN BEFORE THE SPEECH STARTED 
AND BARRIERS WERE PUSHED OVER 

07:26:38.764 --> 07:26:41.313
SOME 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE 
CONCLUSION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

07:26:41.532 --> 07:26:43.532
SPEECH. THE ANSWER 

07:26:45.792 --> 07:26:49.033
IS YES. AND I WANT TO TAKE THE 
REST OF MY TIME TO GO BACK TO 

07:26:49.253 --> 07:26:53.793
THE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE IT WAS
COMPLETELY MISSED BY THE HOUSE 

07:26:54.013 --> 07:26:55.873
MANAGERS. BRANDENBURG VERSUS 
OHIO IS AN INCITEMENT CASE. IT 

07:26:55.874 --> 07:26:57.874
IS NOT  AN ELECTED OFFICIAL 

07:27:02.614 --> 07:27:04.934
CASE. THAT'S WOOD AND BOND. AND 
THE WHOLE PROBLEM THAT THE HOUSE

07:27:05.574 --> 07:27:07.333
MANAGERS HAVE IN UNDERSTANDING 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT 

07:27:07.334 --> 07:27:12.274
HERE IS THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS 
ARE DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY 

07:27:12.495 --> 07:27:16.624
ELSE. HE'S TALKING ABOUT FIRE 
CHIEFS. FIRE CHIEFS ARE NOT 

07:27:18.081 --> 07:27:22.615
ELECTED OFFICIALS. POLICE 
OFFICERS ARE NOT ELECTED 

07:27:22.815 --> 07:27:24.815
OFFICIALS. ELECTED OFFICIALS 
HAVE 

07:27:27.315 --> 07:27:30.057
A DIFFERENT -- A HIGHER STANDARD
FROM THE HOLDINGS THAT I GAVE 

07:27:30.275 --> 07:27:35.036
YOU. THE HIGHEST PROTECTIONS I 
SHOULD STAY HOME AND NOT A 

07:27:35.256 --> 07:27:37.256
HIGHER STANDARD IT IS A HIGHER 
PROTECTION TO YOUR SPEECH 

07:27:37.426 --> 07:27:39.536
BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF 
POLITICAL DIALOGUE BECAUSE OF 

07:27:39.755 --> 07:27:43.776
WHAT YOU ALL SAY IN YOUR PUBLIC 
DEBATE 

07:27:47.343 --> 07:27:49.343
THINGS THAT AFFECT ALL OF 

07:27:52.017 --> 07:27:54.017
OUR LIVES, THAT IS WICKED 
IMPORTANT STUFF AND YOU SHOULD 

07:27:54.091 --> 07:27:57.457
BE FREE TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN 
JUST ABOUT ANY WAY THAT YOU 

07:28:00.569 --> 07:28:03.657
CAN. BRANDENBURG COMES INTO PLAY
FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS 

07:28:03.928 --> 07:28:07.078
PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT INCITEMENT. IS THE SPEECH 

07:28:08.578 --> 07:28:14.315
ITSELF INSIGHTFUL? TO RIOT? OR 
LAWLESSNESS? ONE OF THE TWO. AND

07:28:14.518 --> 07:28:18.849
THE ANSWER HERE IS NO. AND 
BRANDENBURG THROUGH, AGAIN, 

07:28:19.490 --> 07:28:21.490
BIBLE BELIEVERS, 

07:28:23.058 --> 07:28:25.659
REQUIRE YOU TO LOOK AT THE WORDS
OF THE SPEECH. YOU ACTUALLY 

07:28:25.879 --> 07:28:27.879
CAN'T 

07:28:29.979 --> 07:28:32.319
GO OUTSIDE THE WORDS OF THE 
SPEECH. ARE NOT ALLOWED TO IN 

07:28:33.829 --> 07:28:36.139
THE ANALYSIS. SO, ALL THE TIME 
THEY ARE TRYING TO SPEND ON 

07:28:36.359 --> 07:28:38.359
TWEETS GOING BACK 

07:28:41.813 --> 07:28:44.800
TO 2015 OR EVERYTHING THEY WANT 
TO FOCUS ON THAT WAS SAID IN THE

07:28:45.020 --> 07:28:47.560
HOURS AND THE DAYS AFTERWARDS 
ARE NOT APPLICABLE 

07:28:52.580 --> 07:28:56.981
OR RELEVANT TO THE SCHOLASTIC 
INQUIRY AS TO HOW THE FIRST 

07:28:57.201 --> 07:29:02.761
AMENDMENT IS APPLIED IN THIS 
CHAMBER IN THIS PROCEEDING. AND 

07:29:02.981 --> 07:29:05.080
SO, AGAIN, YOU NEED TO BE 
FOCUSED ON WHAT'S 

07:29:10.041 --> 07:29:14.302
THE LAW? AND THEN HOW DO WE 
APPLY IT TO THIS SET OF FACTS. 

07:29:14.522 --> 07:29:17.882
AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE 
THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT ELECTED 

07:29:18.102 --> 07:29:22.242
OFFICIALS AND FIRE CHIEFS ARE 
TREATED DIFFERENTLY UNDER FIRST 

07:29:27.262 --> 07:29:30.695
AMENDMENT LAW. AND THAT IS TO 
THE BENEFIT OF YOU-ALL, WHICH IS

07:29:30.894 --> 07:29:36.243
THE BENEFIT OF US ALL BECAUSE WE
DO WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK 

07:29:36.463 --> 07:29:39.883
FREELY WITHOUT FEAR THAT THE 
MAJORITY PARTY IS GOING TO COME 

07:29:40.093 --> 07:29:42.795
IN AND IMPEACH YOU OR COME IN 
AND 

07:29:45.994 --> 07:29:49.184
PROSECUTE YOU. TO TRY TO TAKE 
AWAY YOUR SEAT WHERE YOU 

07:29:54.204 --> 07:29:56.890
SIT NOW. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE 
CONSTITUTION SAYS SHOULD 

07:30:01.899 --> 07:30:07.655
BE DONE. BUT YES, THEY DO. THEY 
DO CONTRADICT THEMSELVES. OF 

07:30:07.875 --> 07:30:09.875
COURSE. 

07:30:12.886 --> 07:30:15.536
THANK YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 

07:30:15.537 --> 07:30:20.606
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM MARYLAND. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SEND A QUESTION TO THE 

07:30:20.826 --> 07:30:22.826
HOUSE DESK FOR THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS. 

07:30:38.177 --> 07:30:42.367
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM MARYLAND, 
SENATOR VAN HOLLEN HAS 

07:30:45.507 --> 07:30:47.507
A QUESTION FOR THE MANAGERS, THE
CLERK WILL REPORT 

07:30:52.280 --> 07:30:54.280
THE QUESTION.

07:30:56.788 --> 07:30:59.108
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WOULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO 
THE ANSWER THAT WAS JUST GIVEN 

07:30:59.328 --> 07:31:01.328
BY THE FORMER 

07:31:04.789 --> 07:31:06.789
PRESIDENTS COUNCIL?

07:31:18.449 --> 07:31:23.460
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU. I'M
NOT QUITE SURE WHICH QUESTION 

07:31:23.675 --> 07:31:28.950
THE SENATOR WAS REFERRING TO BUT
LET ME QUICKLY JUST DISPENSE OF 

07:31:29.170 --> 07:31:34.090
THE COUNCILS INVOCATION AGAIN OF
BOND VERSUS FLOYD. THIS IS A 

07:31:34.310 --> 07:31:36.310
CASE I KNOW WELL AND I 

07:31:39.711 --> 07:31:42.030
THINK IN PRAISING IT, JULIAN 
BOND WAS A FRIEND OF MINE, A 

07:31:42.250 --> 07:31:44.250
COLLEAGUE OF MINE IN AMERICAN 
UNIVERSITY, HE WAS A GREAT 

07:31:44.390 --> 07:31:46.509
CIVIL-RIGHTS HERO AND IN HIS 
CASE, HE GOT ELECTED TO THE 

07:31:46.731 --> 07:31:50.451
GEORGIA STATE LEGISLATURE AND AS
A MEMBER OF THE STUDENT 

07:31:50.671 --> 07:31:53.021
NONVIOLENT COORDINATING 
COMMITTEE, THE GREAT COMMITTEE 

07:31:53.241 --> 07:31:55.241
HEADED UP BY 

07:31:58.691 --> 07:32:01.491
THE GREAT BOB MOSES FOR A LONG 
TIME, HE GOT ELECTED TO THE 

07:32:01.692 --> 07:32:03.871
GEORGIA LEGISLATURE AND THEY 
DIDN'T WANT TO ALLOW HIM TO BE 

07:32:04.531 --> 07:32:06.844
SWORN IN. THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW 
HIM TO TAKE HIS OATH OF OFFICE 

07:32:07.045 --> 07:32:10.241
BECAUSE HE HAD TAKEN A POSITION 
AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR AND SO 

07:32:10.442 --> 07:32:12.532
THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT WAS 
A VIOLATION OF HIS FIRST 

07:32:13.851 --> 07:32:16.342
AMENDMENT RIGHTS NOT TO ALLOW 
HIM TO BE SWORN IN. THAT IS THE 

07:32:16.543 --> 07:32:18.672
COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF DONALD 
TRUMP. NOT ONLY WAS HE SWORN IN 

07:32:18.892 --> 07:32:20.892
ON 

07:32:23.172 --> 07:32:25.172
JANUARY 20th 2017, HE WAS 
PRESIDENT FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS 

07:32:25.246 --> 07:32:29.922
BEFORE HE INCITED THIS VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION AGAINST US AND HE 

07:32:30.122 --> 07:32:32.122
VIOLATED HIS OATH OF OFFICE, 
THAT IS WHAT THIS IMPEACHMENT 

07:32:32.233 --> 07:32:34.853
TRIAL IS ABOUT, HIS VIOLATION OF
HIS OATH OF OATH OF OFFICE AND 

07:32:35.053 --> 07:32:38.536
HIS REFUSAL TO UPHOLD THE LAW 
AND TAKE CARE THAT THE LAWS ARE 

07:32:38.736 --> 07:32:40.412
FAITHFULLY EXECUTED, PLEASE 
DON'T DESECRATE THE NAME OF 

07:32:40.413 --> 07:32:42.413
JULIAN BOND, A GREAT 

07:32:45.313 --> 07:32:48.538
AMERICAN BY LINKING HIM WITH 
THIS TERRIBLE PLOT AGAINST 

07:32:48.740 --> 07:32:51.964
AMERICA THAT JUST TOOK PLACE IN 
THE STORMING OF THE 

07:32:55.334 --> 07:33:01.234
CAPITAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. LET'S JUST BE 

07:33:01.454 --> 07:33:03.454
CLEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP SUMMONED 
THE MOB, ASSEMBLED 

07:33:08.395 --> 07:33:12.675
THE MOB AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD'VE
IMMEDIATELY AND FORCEFULLY 

07:33:12.884 --> 07:33:14.884
INTERVENED TO STOP THE VIOLENCE,

07:33:18.655 --> 07:33:21.596
HE DIDN'T. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS 
ATTACK WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED 

07:33:23.555 --> 07:33:25.555
WITHOUT HIM. THIS ATTACK IS NOT 
ABOUT 

07:33:29.515 --> 07:33:32.040
ONE SPEECH. MOST OF YOU MEN 
WOULD NOT HAVE YOUR WIVES WITH 

07:33:32.366 --> 07:33:34.366
ONE ATTEMPT TO TALKING 

07:33:36.206 --> 07:33:39.396
TO HER. IT TOOK NUMEROUS TRIES. 
HAD TO BUILD IT UP. THAT'S WHAT 

07:33:39.616 --> 07:33:44.737
THE PRESIDENT DID AS WELL. HE 
PUT TOGETHER THE GROUP THAT 

07:33:45.287 --> 07:33:49.033
WOULD DO WHAT HE WANTED AND THAT
WAS TO STOP THE CERTIFICATION OF

07:33:50.462 --> 07:33:55.077
THE ELECTION SO THAT HE COULD 
RETAIN POWER TO BE PRESIDENT OF 

07:33:55.297 --> 07:33:58.537
THE UNITED STATES IN 
CONTRAVENTION OF AN 

07:34:03.537 --> 07:34:05.537
AMERICAN ELECTION.

07:34:08.367 --> 07:34:10.367
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

07:34:13.190 --> 07:34:14.697
MR. PRESIDENT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM FLORIDA. 

07:34:14.698 --> 07:34:16.698
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SENT A QUESTION TO 

07:34:20.778 --> 07:34:22.778
THE DESK.

07:34:53.640 --> 07:34:56.019
THE CLERK WILL READ THE QUESTION
AND THE HOUSE MANAGERS WILL GO 

07:34:56.218 --> 07:34:58.218
FIRST FOR THE FIRST 2 

07:35:01.540 --> 07:35:06.520
1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VOTING TO CONVICT THE FORMER 

07:35:06.721 --> 07:35:08.721
WOULD A FORMER OFFICIAL WOULD 

07:35:10.632 --> 07:35:17.041
BE CONVICTED THEREFORE IS IT NOT
TRUE THAT UNDER THIS NEW 

07:35:17.261 --> 07:35:19.261
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT, FUTURE 
HOUSE FACING 

07:35:21.451 --> 07:35:23.451
PARTISAN PRESSURE TO LOCK UP 
COULD IMPEACH A FORMER SECRETARY

07:35:23.562 --> 07:35:28.602
OF STATE AND A FUTURE SENATE BE 
FORCED TO PUT HER ON TRIAL 

07:35:30.265 --> 07:35:32.265
POTENTIALLY QUALIFY FOR ANY 

07:35:36.422 --> 07:35:38.907
FUTURE OFFICE. 

07:35:45.714 --> 07:35:47.714
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

07:35:51.333 --> 07:35:53.333
GO FIRST.

07:36:02.735 --> 07:36:06.544
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS, 
THREE QUICK POINTS. FIRST OF ALL

07:36:06.764 --> 07:36:09.110
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I 
CAN SAY IT, THE JURISDICTIONAL 

07:36:09.311 --> 07:36:13.294
ISSUE IS OVER. THE SENATE 
SETTLED IT. THE SENATE 

07:36:13.495 --> 07:36:15.495
ENTERTAINED JURISDICTION EXACTLY

07:36:17.374 --> 07:36:20.584
THE WAY IT WAS DONE SINCE THE 
VERY BEGINNING OF THE REPUBLIC. 

07:36:20.805 --> 07:36:23.635
IN THE BLUNT CASE, IN THE BELNAP
CASE AND YOU WILL REMEMBER BOTH 

07:36:23.824 --> 07:36:25.824
OF THEM 

07:36:29.064 --> 07:36:32.565
FORMER OFFICIALS. AND IN THIS 
CASE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 

07:36:32.784 --> 07:36:36.245
COMMITTED WHILE HE WAS IN OFFICE
HE WAS IMPEACHED BY THE HOUSE OF

07:36:36.465 --> 07:36:41.385
REPRESENTATIVES WHILE HE WAS IN 
OFFICE. SO, YOU KNOW, THE 

07:36:42.665 --> 07:36:44.665
HYPOTHETICAL SUGGESTED BY 

07:36:48.106 --> 07:36:50.106
THE GENTLEMAN

07:36:52.474 --> 07:36:54.766
FROM FLORIDA HAS NO BEARING ON 
THIS CASE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK 

07:36:54.986 --> 07:36:56.986
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN 
OFFICIAL WHO WAS IMPEACHED WHILE

07:36:57.146 --> 07:36:59.305
THEY WERE IN OFFICE FOR CONDUCT 
THEY COMMITTED WHILE THEY WERE 

07:37:01.066 --> 07:37:02.805
IN OFFICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 

07:37:02.806 --> 07:37:07.032
PRESIDENT HAS 2 1/2 MINUTES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. THAT I HAVE THE 

07:37:07.234 --> 07:37:09.234
QUESTION AGAIN TO MAKE SURE I 
GET 

07:37:11.547 --> 07:37:16.407
IT RIGHT? I CAN ANSWER DIRECTLY.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VOTING TO CONVICT THE FORMER 

07:37:16.607 --> 07:37:18.526
PRESIDENT WOULD CREATE A NEW 
PRECEDENT THAT THE FORMER 

07:37:18.527 --> 07:37:20.527
OFFICIAL CAN BE CONVICTED AND 
DISQUALIFIED BY THE SENATE, 

07:37:20.687 --> 07:37:22.687
THEREFORE, IS IT NOT TRUE THAT 
UNDER 

07:37:27.427 --> 07:37:30.527
THIS NEW PRESIDENT A FUTURE 
HOUSE FACING PARTISAN PRESSURE 

07:37:30.746 --> 07:37:33.267
TO LOCK HER UP COULD IMPEACH A 
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE AND A 

07:37:33.468 --> 07:37:35.468
FUTURE SENATE 

07:37:37.308 --> 07:37:39.468
BE FORCED TO PUT HER ON TRIAL 
AND POTENTIALLY DISQUALIFY FROM 

07:37:39.687 --> 07:37:44.748
ANY FUTURE OFFICE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF YOU SEE IT THEIR WAY, YES.

07:37:44.968 --> 07:37:48.608
IF YOU DO THIS THE WAY THEY WANT
IT DONE, THAT 

07:37:52.858 --> 07:37:57.209
THE EXAMPLE THERE, FORMATIVE 
SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT IT CAN 

07:37:57.428 --> 07:37:59.428
HAPPEN A LOT 

07:38:01.599 --> 07:38:07.609
OF PEOPLE. AND THAT IS NOT THE 
WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK. IT 

07:38:07.828 --> 07:38:13.809
COULD BECOME MUCH MORE REGULAR 
TOO. BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT 

07:38:14.029 --> 07:38:17.549
-- AND I WANT YOU TO BE CLEAR ON
THIS, MR. RASKIN CAN'T TELL YOU 

07:38:18.389 --> 07:38:23.530
ON WHAT ROUNDS YOU ACQUIT. IF 
YOU BELIEVE EVEN THOUGH THERE 

07:38:23.750 --> 07:38:25.750
WAS A 

07:38:28.970 --> 07:38:31.410
VOTE THAT THIS JURISDICTION IF 
YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS 

07:38:31.630 --> 07:38:35.256
UNCONSTITUTIONAL YOU CAN STILL 
BELIEVE THAT. IF YOU BELIEVE 

07:38:35.458 --> 07:38:37.630
THAT THE HOUSE DID NOT GIVE 
APPROPRIATE DUE PROCESS IN THIS,

07:38:37.830 --> 07:38:42.551
THAT CAN BE YOUR REASON TO 
ACQUIT. IF YOU DON'T THINK THEY 

07:38:42.771 --> 07:38:44.771
MEANT 

07:38:47.051 --> 07:38:48.750
THEIR BURDEN IN PROVING 
INCITEMENTS THAT THESE WORDS 

07:38:48.751 --> 07:38:53.031
INCITED THE VIOLENCE, YOU CAN 
ACQUIT. MR. RASKIN DOESN'T GET 

07:38:53.251 --> 07:38:57.398
TO GIVE YOU UNDER WHAT GROUNDS 
YOU CAN ACQUIT. AND SO YOU HAVE 

07:38:57.611 --> 07:38:59.611
TO 

07:39:00.791 --> 07:39:08.162
LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE PUT ON. IN 
ITS TOTALITY AND COME TO YOUR 

07:39:08.362 --> 07:39:10.442
OWN UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHETHER 
YOU THINK THEY'VE MET THEIR 

07:39:10.642 --> 07:39:12.762
BURDEN TO IMPEACH. THE 

07:39:16.392 --> 07:39:18.392
ORIGINAL QUESTION IS AN 
ABSOLUTELY SLIPPERY SLOPE THAT I

07:39:18.545 --> 07:39:21.922
DON'T REALLY THINK ANYBODY HERE 
WANTS TO SEND THIS COUNTRY DOWN.

07:39:26.933 --> 07:39:28.933
THANK YOU.

07:39:30.933 --> 07:39:35.212
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THE QUESTION 
TO THE DESK. 

07:39:35.213 --> 07:39:40.095
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE FROM COLORADO 
SENDING A QUESTION TO THE DESK. 

07:39:57.594 --> 07:39:59.594
I WOULD NOTE 

07:40:03.694 --> 07:40:05.694
JUST FOR

07:40:08.675 --> 07:40:13.435
AS THE HOURS TEND TO GET LAID, I
WOULD NOTE FOR ALL COUNSEL AS 

07:40:13.655 --> 07:40:15.655
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS NOTED ON 
JANUARY 

07:40:18.354 --> 07:40:21.485
21st, 2020, THE TRIAL IN 1905, 
ALL PARTIES TO 

07:40:24.715 --> 07:40:26.715
THIS CHAMBER MUST REFRAIN FROM 
USING LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT 

07:40:26.815 --> 07:40:28.815
CONDUCIVE TO 

07:40:32.036 --> 07:40:34.036
CIVIL DISCOURSE. SENATOR 

07:40:37.045 --> 07:40:39.045
FROM COLORADO SENATOR BENNETT 
HAS A QUESTION FOR THE HOUSE 

07:40:39.236 --> 07:40:41.236
MANAGER AND THE CLERK WILL READ 

07:40:45.335 --> 07:40:48.196
THE QUESTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SINCE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, 

07:40:48.416 --> 07:40:51.226
THE GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE, 
THE VICE PRESIDENT AND OTHER 

07:40:51.648 --> 07:40:53.648
PUBLIC 

07:40:56.676 --> 07:40:58.909
OFFICIALS WITH WITHSTOOD 
ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO UPHOLD THE 

07:40:59.124 --> 07:41:01.236
LAWFUL ELECTION OF PRESIDENT 
BIDEN AND THE RULE OF LAW. WHAT 

07:41:01.457 --> 07:41:04.177
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THESE 
OFFICIALS HAD VOWED TO THE FORCE

07:41:04.397 --> 07:41:07.207
PRESIDENT TRUMP EXERTED OR THE 
MOB THAT ATTACKED 

07:41:12.217 --> 07:41:14.217
THE CAPITAL?

07:42:14.019 --> 07:42:16.019
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE 

07:42:19.919 --> 07:42:21.919
FIVE MINUTES.

07:42:25.219 --> 07:42:27.539
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND 
REMIND EVERYBODY ABOUT THE 

07:42:28.839 --> 07:42:31.399
INCREDIBLE PRESSURE THAT DONALD 
TRUMP WAS PUTTING ON ELECTION 

07:42:31.619 --> 07:42:34.599
OFFICIALS IN DIFFERENT STATES IN
THIS COUNTRY. AND THE 

07:42:34.819 --> 07:42:36.819
INTIMIDATION THAT HE 

07:42:39.330 --> 07:42:41.440
WAS ISSUING. I WANT TO REMIND 
EVERYBODY OF THE BACKGROUND OF 

07:42:41.660 --> 07:42:44.700
DONALD TRUMP'S CALL 21 SECRETARY
OF STATE, THE SECRETARY OF STATE

07:42:49.720 --> 07:42:51.720
FROM GEORGIA

07:42:55.340 --> 07:42:57.340
, MR. RUFFINS BERGER. DONALD 
TRUMP TRIED TO OVERTURN THE 

07:42:57.400 --> 07:42:59.571
ELECTION BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.
HE TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO 

07:42:59.773 --> 07:43:01.449
PRESSURE AND THREATEN ELECTION 
OFFICIALS TO OVERTURN THE 

07:43:01.450 --> 07:43:03.541
ELECTION RESULTS. HE PRESSURED 
MICHIGAN OFFICIALS CALLING THEM 

07:43:03.759 --> 07:43:07.780
LATE AT NIGHT AND HOSTING THEM 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HE DID THE 

07:43:07.981 --> 07:43:11.601
SAME THING WITH OFFICIALS IN 
PENNSYLVANIA. HE CALLED INTO A 

07:43:11.820 --> 07:43:13.820
LOCAL MEETING OF THE 
PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE AND HE 

07:43:14.011 --> 07:43:18.150
ALSO HOSTED THEM AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE WHERE HE PRESSURED THEM. 

07:43:18.313 --> 07:43:22.531
AND IN GEORGIA, IT WAS EVEN 
WORSE. HE SENT TWEET AFTER TWEET

07:43:22.741 --> 07:43:29.341
ATTACKING THE SECRETARY OF STATE
UNTIL HE GOT DEATH THREATS TO 

07:43:29.543 --> 07:43:31.543
HIM AND 

07:43:34.041 --> 07:43:36.761
HIS FAMILY. HIS WIFE GOT A TEXT 
THAT SAID, QUOTE, YOUR HUSBAND 

07:43:36.972 --> 07:43:43.201
DESERVES FACING A FIRING SQUAD. 
A FIRING SQUAD. FOR DOING HIS 

07:43:43.422 --> 07:43:47.232
JOB. MR. RUFFINS BERGER STOOD UP
AND TOLD THE 

07:43:52.242 --> 07:43:54.542
WORLD THAT ELECTIONS ARE THE 
SOCIETY AND THE VOTES WERE 

07:43:54.762 --> 07:43:56.762
ACCURATELY COUNTED FOR DONALD 
TRUMP'S 

07:44:00.442 --> 07:44:02.400
OPPONENT. OFFICIALS LIKE MR. 
STERLING WARNED TRUMP THAT IF 

07:44:02.401 --> 07:44:04.401
THIS CONTINUED, SOMEONE IS GOING
TO 

07:44:06.843 --> 07:44:08.843
GET KILLED. BUT DONALD TRUMP 
DIDN'T STOP. HE ESCALATED IT 

07:44:09.022 --> 07:44:12.632
EVEN FURTHER. HE MADE A PERSONAL
CALL. YOU HEARD THAT CALL 

07:44:12.833 --> 07:44:18.121
BECAUSE IT WAS RECORDED. THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

07:44:18.323 --> 07:44:20.832
TOLD A SECRETARY OF STATE THAT 
IF HE DOES NOT FIND VOTES, HE 

07:44:21.053 --> 07:44:24.903
WILL FACE CRIMINAL PENALTIES. 
PLEASE SENATORS CONSIDER THAT 

07:44:25.123 --> 07:44:29.049
FOR A SECOND. THE PRESIDENT 
PUTTING ALL OF THIS PUBLIC AND 

07:44:29.244 --> 07:44:31.244
PRIVATE PRESSURE ON 

07:44:32.643 --> 07:44:34.562
ELECTION OFFICIALS TELLING THEM 
THAT THEY COULD FACE CRIMINAL 

07:44:34.563 --> 07:44:36.563
PENALTIES IF THEY DON'T DO WHAT 

07:44:39.143 --> 07:44:41.677
HE WANTS. AND NOT JUST ANY 
NUMBER OF VOTES THAT HE WAS 

07:44:42.723 --> 07:44:44.848
LOOKING FOR. DONALD TRUMP WAS 
ASKING THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO

07:44:45.049 --> 07:44:50.214
SOMEHOW FIND THE EXACT NUMBER OF
VOTES OF DONALD TRUMP LOST THE 

07:44:50.434 --> 07:44:53.839
STATE BY. REMEMBER PRESIDENT 
BIDEN WON GEORGIA BY 

07:44:58.864 --> 07:45:01.404
11,779 VOTES. IN HIS OWN WORDS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, QUOTE, ALL

07:45:01.624 --> 07:45:05.684
I WANT TO DO IS THIS, I JUST 
WANT TO FIND 11,780 VOTES. HE 

07:45:05.904 --> 07:45:10.184
WANTED THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO
SOMEHOW FIND THE PRECISE NUMBER 

07:45:10.404 --> 07:45:12.735
+1 OF VOTES THAT HE NEEDED 

07:45:17.753 --> 07:45:20.817
TO WIN. AS A CONGRESS AND AS A 
NATION, WE CANNOT BE NUMB TO 

07:45:22.685 --> 07:45:24.685
THIS CONDUCT. IF 

07:45:26.765 --> 07:45:30.545
WE ARE, AND IF WE DON'T SET A 
PRECEDENT AGAINST IT, MORE 

07:45:30.765 --> 07:45:33.805
PRESIDENTS WILL DO THIS IN THE 
FUTURE. THIS WILL BE A 

07:45:36.805 --> 07:45:39.381
GREEN LIGHT FOR THEM TO ENGAGE 
IN THAT KIND OF PRESSURE AND 

07:45:39.825 --> 07:45:43.425
THAT KIND OF CONDUCT. AND THIS 
COULD HAVE GONE A VERY DIFFERENT

07:45:43.645 --> 07:45:45.645
WAY IF THOSE ELECTION 

07:45:48.196 --> 07:45:50.196
OFFICIALS HAD BOWED TO THE 
INTIMIDATION AND THE PRESSURE OF

07:45:50.256 --> 07:45:54.106
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. IT WOULD'VE MEANT THAT 

07:45:54.325 --> 07:45:56.325
INSTEAD OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
DECIDING THE SELECTION, 

07:45:56.845 --> 07:45:59.446
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALONE WOULD HAVE
DECIDED THIS 

07:46:03.365 --> 07:46:05.365
AMERICAN ELECTION. THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT WAS AT STAKE AND 

07:46:05.416 --> 07:46:07.806
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS 
TRYING TO DO. 

07:46:11.663 --> 07:46:13.938
HE INTENDED, WANTED TO AND TRIED
TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION BY ANY 

07:46:15.646 --> 07:46:17.646
MEANS NECESSARY. HE TRIED 
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HE COULD TO

07:46:17.785 --> 07:46:19.785
DO TO WIN. 

07:46:23.446 --> 07:46:28.048
HE STARTED INCITING THE CROWD, 
ISSUING TWEET AFTER TWEET, 

07:46:28.266 --> 07:46:30.447
ISSUING COMMANDS TO STOP THE 
COUNT, STOP THE STEAL. WORKED UP

07:46:35.467 --> 07:46:37.467
THE CROWD

07:46:41.977 --> 07:46:44.657
. SENT A SAVE THE DATE. SO, IT 
WASN'T JUST ONE SPEECH OR ONE 

07:46:44.858 --> 07:46:46.786
THING. HE WAS TRYING EVERYTHING.
HE WAS PRESSURING ELECTED 

07:46:46.787 --> 07:46:48.878
OFFICIALS. HE WAS RILING UP HIS 
BASE TELLING THEM THE ELECTION 

07:46:49.079 --> 07:46:51.587
HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM THEM. THAT 
IT HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM. IT 

07:46:51.808 --> 07:46:53.987
WAS A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT
ONLY DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE 

07:46:54.207 --> 07:46:57.477
DONE. AND FOR US TO BELIEVE 
OTHERWISE IS TO THINK THAT 

07:46:57.679 --> 07:47:02.942
SOMEHOW, A RABBIT CAME OUT OF 
THE HAT AND HIS MOB JUST SHOWED 

07:47:03.144 --> 07:47:09.336
UP HERE ON THEIR OWN ALL BY 
THEMSELVES. THIS IS DANGEROUS, 

07:47:09.547 --> 07:47:13.548
SENATORS. AND THE FUTURE OF OUR 
DEMOCRACY TRULY RESTS IN 

07:47:18.548 --> 07:47:23.789
YOUR HANDS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THE SENATOR 

07:47:25.688 --> 07:47:28.048
FROM TEXAS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SENT A 

07:47:28.248 --> 07:47:30.248
QUESTION TO THE DESK. 

07:47:52.667 --> 07:47:55.199
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS HAS A 
QUESTION 

07:47:58.609 --> 07:48:00.789
FOR BOTH COUNSEL FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT AND THE HOUSE MANAGER.

07:48:01.869 --> 07:48:05.269
THE CLERK WILL READ THE 

07:48:08.989 --> 07:48:10.989
QUESTION AND RECOGNIZE FIRST THE
COUNSEL FOR THE 

07:48:15.529 --> 07:48:17.269
FORMER PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE 

07:48:17.270 --> 07:48:19.637
ARGUED THAT IF THE SENATE CANNOT
CONVICT FORMER OFFICERS, THEN 

07:48:19.837 --> 07:48:22.338
THE CONSTITUTION CREATES A 

07:48:26.196 --> 07:48:28.340
JANUARY EXCEPTION. PURSUANT TO 
WHICH A PRESIDENT IS FREE TO ACT

07:48:28.542 --> 07:48:30.630
WITH IMPUNITY BECAUSE HE IS NOT 
SUBJECT TO IMPEACHMENT, 

07:48:30.850 --> 07:48:32.850
CONVICTION AND REMOVAL 

07:48:36.450 --> 07:48:38.189
AND/OR DISQUALIFICATION. BUT, 
ISN'T A PRESIDENT SUBJECT TO 

07:48:38.190 --> 07:48:40.190
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AFTER HE 

07:48:43.130 --> 07:48:45.511
LEAVES OFFICE FOR ACTS COMMITTED
IN OFFICE EVEN IF THOSE ACTS ARE

07:48:45.731 --> 07:48:47.731
COMMITTED 

07:48:50.751 --> 07:48:52.751
IN JANUARY?

07:49:03.271 --> 07:49:05.401
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS AS 
QUESTION RAISES A VERY, VERY 

07:49:08.391 --> 07:49:10.391
IMPORTANT POINT. THERE IS NO 
SUCH THING AS A JANUARY 

07:49:10.499 --> 07:49:14.070
EXCEPTION TO IMPEACHMENT. THERE 
WAS ONLY THE TEXT OF THE 

07:49:14.291 --> 07:49:18.057
CONSTITUTION WHICH MAKES IT VERY
CLEAR THAT A FORMER PRESIDENT IS

07:49:18.258 --> 07:49:22.943
SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL SANCTION 
AFTER HIS PRESIDENCY FOR ANY 

07:49:23.143 --> 07:49:25.143
ILLEGAL ACTS 

07:49:26.591 --> 07:49:30.482
HE COMMITS. THERE IS NO JANUARY 
EXCEPTION TO IMPEACHMENT, THERE 

07:49:30.683 --> 07:49:32.683
IS SIMPLY A WAY WE TREAT HIGH 
CRIMES 

07:49:35.631 --> 07:49:37.531
AND MISDEMEANORS. ALLEGEDLY 
COMMITTED BY A PRESIDENT WHEN HE

07:49:37.532 --> 07:49:39.532
IS IN 

07:49:40.992 --> 07:49:42.992
OFFICE IMPEACHMENT AND HOW WE 
TREAT CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR BY A 

07:49:43.052 --> 07:49:45.052
PRIVATE CITIZEN WHEN THEY ARE 
NOT 

07:49:49.132 --> 07:49:52.232
IN OFFICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE 

07:49:56.122 --> 07:49:59.902
HOUSE MANAGERS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU FOR THIS EXCELLENT 

07:50:00.122 --> 07:50:02.122
QUESTION. WOULDN'T A PRESIDENT 
WHO DECIDES TO COMMIT HIS CRIMES

07:50:02.223 --> 07:50:04.223
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN OFFICE 
LIKE 

07:50:08.151 --> 07:50:09.857
PRESIDENT TRUMP BY INCITING THE 
INSURRECTION AGAINST THE 

07:50:09.858 --> 07:50:14.281
COUNTING OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
VOTES BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL 

07:50:14.626 --> 07:50:16.673
PROSECUTION BY THE U.S. ATTORNEY
FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

07:50:16.879 --> 07:50:19.152
FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE? OF COURSE HE WOULD BE. 

07:50:19.373 --> 07:50:23.493
BUT THAT IS TRUE OF THE 
PRESIDENT REGARDLESS OF WHEN HE 

07:50:23.693 --> 07:50:27.713
COMMITS HIS OFFENSES AND OFFICE.
IN OTHER WORDS THAT IS FOR IF HE

07:50:27.933 --> 07:50:29.933
TRIED 

07:50:32.933 --> 07:50:36.033
TO SAVE AN INSURRECTION AGAINST 
THE UNION IS HIS THIRD OR SECOND

07:50:36.253 --> 07:50:38.333
YEAR IN OFFICE. YOU COULD SAY HE
COULD BE PROSECUTED AFTERWARDS. 

07:50:39.433 --> 07:50:41.743
THE REASON THAT THE FRAMERS GAVE
CONGRESS, THE HOUSE THE POWER TO

07:50:41.963 --> 07:50:46.674
IMPEACH THE SENATE THE POWER TO 
TRY AND CONVICT, REMOVE AND 

07:50:46.893 --> 07:50:48.893
DISQUALIFY WAS 

07:50:52.128 --> 07:50:54.128
TO PROTECT.

07:50:56.234 --> 07:50:58.234
WE DON'T COME HERE 

07:51:01.414 --> 07:51:05.434
IN ANGER WE COME HERE IN THE 
SPIRIT OF PROTECTING OUR 

07:51:05.654 --> 07:51:07.834
REPUBLIC AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS 
ALL ABOUT. BUT THERE 

07:51:11.014 --> 07:51:12.254
JANUARY EXCEPTION WOULD 
ESSENTIALLY INVITE PRESIDENTS 

07:51:12.255 --> 07:51:17.155
AND OTHER CIVIL OFFICERS TO RUN 
RAMPANT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN

07:51:17.374 --> 07:51:19.794
OFFICE ON THE THEORY THAT THE 
HOUSE AND THE SENATE WOULDN'T BE

07:51:20.014 --> 07:51:23.474
ABLE TO GET IT TOGETHER IN TIME 
CERTAINLY ACCORDING TO THEIR 

07:51:23.694 --> 07:51:25.694
DEMANDS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS OF
INVESTIGATION WOULDN'T BE ABLE 

07:51:25.833 --> 07:51:27.833
TO 

07:51:29.294 --> 07:51:31.392
GET IT TOGETHER IN TIME IN ORDER
TO VINDICATE THE CONSTITUTION. 

07:51:31.595 --> 07:51:35.006
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. THAT CAN'T 
BE RIGHT. WE KNOW THAT THE 

07:51:35.221 --> 07:51:39.006
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER IS 
ALWAYS THE MOST DANGEROUS MOMENT

07:51:39.207 --> 07:51:41.207
FOR DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE 
WORLD. TALK TO 

07:51:43.585 --> 07:51:45.585
THE DIPLOMATS. TALK TO THE 
HISTORIANS. THEY WILL TELL YOU 

07:51:45.665 --> 07:51:49.734
THAT IS A MOMENT OF DANGER. 
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET THE COOS, 

07:51:49.934 --> 07:51:51.934
THE INSURRECTIONS, THAT'S WHEN 
YOU GET THE SEDITIOUS PLOTS AND 

07:51:52.025 --> 07:51:54.025
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T EVEN 
HAVE 

07:51:57.087 --> 07:51:59.172
TO READ HISTORY FOR THAT. YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO CONSULT THE 

07:51:59.374 --> 07:52:03.765
FRAMERS OR LOOK AROUND THE 
WORLD. IT JUST HAPPENED TO US. 

07:52:03.979 --> 07:52:06.116
THE MOMENT WHEN WE WERE JUST 
GOING TO COLLECT THE ALREADY 

07:52:06.336 --> 07:52:09.502

07:55:08.832 --> 07:55:11.350
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEFORE WE MOVED TO PASS THIS

07:55:11.551 --> 07:55:15.600
THAT HE WAS NOT ALONE THAT DAY. 
THE NATION SAW AND HAS NOW SEEN 

07:55:15.820 --> 07:55:18.940
NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF THE HEROIC 
CONDUCT OF THE CAPITOL POLICE, 

07:55:19.160 --> 07:55:23.820
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE, THE 
S.W.A.T. TEAMS THAT WERE WITH US

07:56:15.530 --> 07:56:19.781
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE REPUBLICAN LEADER. 

07:56:19.782 --> 07:56:21.782
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PLEASED TO JOIN THE MAJORITY 
LEADER'S REQUEST, JANUARY SIX 

07:56:21.892 --> 07:56:26.848

SADNESS FOR MANY MORE WATCHING 

07:56:31.297 --> 07:56:35.067
FROM AFAR. BUT THAT AWFUL DAY 
ALSO INTRODUCED TO THE NATION TO

07:56:35.268 --> 07:56:37.551
A GROUP OF HEROES WHO WE AND 
CONGRESS WERE ALREADY CALLED TO 

07:56:37.771 --> 07:56:39.771
CALL THE 

07:56:43.004 --> 07:56:46.322
COLLEAGUES AND TO WHOM WE OWE A 
GREAT DEATH. IN THE FACE OF

PEOPLE IN THIS CHAMBER MAY NOT 

07:56:59.726 --> 07:57:01.726

CAN BESTOW. [ APPLAUSE ] 

07:57:36.472 --> 07:57:38.727
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO MR. PRESIDENT, AS IF IN 
LATEST THAT INFLATION I ASK 

07:57:39.742 --> 07:57:41.427

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND DAVE FOR THE INPUT 
IMPEACHMENT TRAVEL ENDS ON 

07:58:53.069 --> 07:58:55.150
BIPARTISANSHIP AS THEY GIVE A 

07:58:58.728 --> 07:59:00.728
STANDING OVATION TO OFFICER 
GOODMAN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

07:59:00.815 --> 07:59:02.815
POLICE AND YOU HEARD THEM TALK 
ABOUT 

07:59:05.684 --> 07:59:07.573
GETTING THAT GOLD MEDAL, THE 
CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL TO OFFICER 

07:59:07.574 --> 07:59:09.470

UP NOW AND WE WON'T SEE ANY MORE
OF THIS TRIAL AND TELL 10:00 

07:59:16.900 --> 07:59:18.944
TOMORROW MORNING WHICH MEANS WE 
WILL BE BACK TOMORROW AT NINE 

07:59:19.143 --> 07:59:21.644
A.M.. THIS IS THE WASHINGTON 
SUPPOSED WASHINGTON POST SPECIAL

07:59:21.865 --> 07:59:24.175
REPORT. YOU CAN SEE MITCH 
McCONNELL LEAVING NOW. SO, THE 

07:59:24.395 --> 07:59:28.156
QUESTIONS WE HEARD TONIGHT WERE 
LARGELY LEADING AND BASICALLY AN

07:59:28.375 --> 07:59:31.315
OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH SIDE TO 
MAKE POINTS BUT WE DID HEAR HIM 

07:59:31.535 --> 07:59:35.930
FULL OF SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS 
ALONG THE WAY. HERE TO TALK 

07:59:36.131 --> 07:59:38.131
ABOUT THE DAY, CAPITOL HILL 
REPORTER RHONDA COLVIN, LA VILLA

07:59:39.424 --> 07:59:41.424
KNOX AND 

07:59:42.825 --> 07:59:45.382
JAMES HOLMAN, WASHINGTON POST 
COLUMNIST. WELCOME TO YOU ALL. 

07:59:45.595 --> 07:59:47.595
RHONDA, LET'S START 

07:59:51.046 --> 07:59:53.046
WITH YOU.

07:59:54.848 --> 07:59:56.981
YOU KNOW, THEY COULD'VE USED 
EVEN MORE TIME OF THIS Q&amp;amp;A 

07:59:57.181 --> 07:59:59.047
PERIOD, THEY DID NOT. PERHAPS 
SOMEWHAT MERCIFULLY AT THIS 

07:59:59.048 --> 08:00:01.555
POINT BECAUSE IT IS BEEN SUCH A 
LONG DAY AND LONG WEEK. BUT 

08:00:01.756 --> 08:00:04.056
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT ANSWERS OR
WHAT NEW INFORMATION WE MAY HAVE

08:00:04.276 --> 08:00:06.276
GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. YOU ARE CORRECT IN 

08:00:06.376 --> 08:00:08.376
SAYING THERE WERE A LOT OF 

08:00:12.396 --> 08:00:14.526
LEADING QUESTIONS. THERE SEEM TO
BE QUESTIONS WHERE SOME SENATORS

08:00:14.727 --> 08:00:17.236
WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR 
MIND ON HOW THEY ARE GOING TO 

08:00:17.407 --> 08:00:19.407
VOTE, THEY PRESENTED QUESTIONS 
TO LET THE DEFENSE OR THE 

08:00:24.076 --> 08:00:27.826
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS UNDERSCORE 
SOME OF THEIR EARLIER ARGUMENTS 

08:00:28.226 --> 08:00:32.627
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT BOTH SIDES 

08:00:38.736 --> 08:00:43.724
LAWYERS FOR FORMER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AS WELL AS THE IMPEACHMENT

08:00:43.867 --> 08:00:45.550
MANAGERS WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
FIERY THAN WE HAD SEEN EARLIER 

08:00:45.551 --> 08:00:47.276
THIS WEEK. THE EARLIER PARTS OF 
THE OPENING ARGUMENTS SEEM TO 

08:00:47.277 --> 08:00:48.916
FOLLOW THAT SENSE OF DECORUM BUT
TODAY YOU SAW THE DEFENSE 

08:00:48.917 --> 08:00:50.430
LAWYERS REALLY DIG IN AND THIS 
QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PERIOD AND 

08:00:50.431 --> 08:00:51.889
KIND OF PIVOT AWAY FROM SOME 
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT 

08:00:51.890 --> 08:00:55.731
RESIDENT TRUMPS CONDUCT AND 
INSTEAD SAY THAT THE IMPEACHMENT

08:00:55.932 --> 08:00:58.013
MANAGERS DID NOT ALLOW DUE 
PROCESS AND THIS WAS A SHAM 

08:00:58.213 --> 08:01:00.323
PROCESS AND POINTED TO SOME OF 
THEIR EARLIER CLAIMS TODAY THAT 

08:01:00.524 --> 08:01:02.412
THE EXHIBITS WERE MANUFACTURED 
BY THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND 

08:01:02.413 --> 08:01:04.469
YOU COULD TELL THAT SOME OF THE 
QUESTIONS THEY RECEIVED FROM 

08:01:04.677 --> 08:01:06.787
SOME REPUBLICANS WERE LEADING 
YOU IN A WAY THAT THEY COULD 

08:01:07.007 --> 08:01:09.007
KIND OF EXPOUND ON THEIR 
FEELINGS 

08:01:13.117 --> 08:01:15.567
ABOUT THAT. I THINK ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS FROM 

08:01:15.787 --> 08:01:18.102
THIS PORTION IS THAT WE DID SEE 
QUESTIONS FROM SOME OF THESE 

08:01:18.304 --> 08:01:20.787
SENATORS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT 
FOR HOW THEY ARE GOING TO OAT 

08:01:21.006 --> 08:01:23.287
VOTE. THEY ARE IN THAT MAYBE 
CALL HIM RIGHT NOW THAT SENATOR 

08:01:23.508 --> 08:01:25.508
ROMNEY, MICHALSKI AND COLLINS, 
THEY ALL ASKED 

08:01:28.465 --> 08:01:30.567
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TRUMP KNEW 
AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT. 

08:01:30.768 --> 08:01:32.768
SPECIFICS ABOUT WHEN 

08:01:36.222 --> 08:01:39.332
HE SPENT SENT THE DISPARAGING 
TWEET AND THE TIMING ABOUT THAT.

08:01:39.548 --> 08:01:41.879
THEY WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT 
THAT AND THOSE WERE TIMES YOU 

08:01:42.080 --> 08:01:44.364
SAW THE DEFENSE SAY THAT THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE THE HOUSE 

08:01:44.577 --> 08:01:46.271
IMPEACHMENT OFFICER SUPPLY 
ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND THEY NEVER 

08:01:46.272 --> 08:01:49.018
REALLY GOT TO THE CORE OF THAT. 
AT ONE POINT ONE OF THE DEFENSE 

08:01:53.867 --> 08:01:55.958
TEAM MEMBERS IT WAS NOT ABOUT 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING 

08:01:56.158 --> 08:01:58.680
DURING THE ATTACK SO THAT WAS 
ONE OF THE ATTACKS THEY GOT NEAR

08:01:58.880 --> 08:02:03.677
BEING IT BUT THEY WERE STILL 
VERY VAGUE ABOUT IT BUT YES, 

08:02:03.878 --> 08:02:05.878
THIS COULD HAVE LASTED UP TO 

08:02:09.918 --> 08:02:11.918
FOUR HOURS.

08:02:14.268 --> 08:02:16.157
THEY DID AGREE TO ROLL SAYING 
THE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PERIOD 

08:02:16.158 --> 08:02:18.488
COULD BE FOUR HOURS AND OF 
COURSE THEY DID NOT UTILIZE ALL 

08:02:18.689 --> 08:02:20.768
OF THAT TIME AND HAVE NOW 
WRAPPED FOR THE DAY. 

08:02:20.769 --> 08:02:24.098
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANKS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW 
THERE WAS SO MUCH FOCUS ON WHAT 

08:02:24.318 --> 08:02:27.868
TRUMP DID IN THE HOURS AFTER THE
ATTACK STARTED AND BEFORE WE 

08:02:28.068 --> 08:02:30.068
REALLY GOT ANY SORT 

08:02:33.708 --> 08:02:37.444
OF RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT, 
DONALD TRUMP. SO, DID WE 

08:02:37.658 --> 08:02:39.792
ACTUALLY LEARN MORE ABOUT THE 
TIMELINE OR DID WE ALSO LEARN 

08:02:39.993 --> 08:02:42.104
MORE ABOUT PERHAPS QUESTIONS 
THAT HIS TEAM DID NOT WANT TO 

08:02:42.304 --> 08:02:44.365
ANSWER? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE DEFINITELY DID NOT. 

08:02:44.579 --> 08:02:48.999
NOTABLY ABOUT THE CHRONOLOGY AND
YOU LOOK BACK AT THE CHRONOLOGY 

08:02:49.207 --> 08:02:54.362
WE SEE THE MIKE PENCE BEING 
USHERED AWAY ABOUT A MINUTE AND 

08:02:54.569 --> 08:02:58.302
A FEW FEET LATER WE HAVE SOME OF
THE 

08:03:03.329 --> 08:03:05.329
INSURRECTIONIST BREACHING

08:03:07.867 --> 08:03:09.994
THE CHAMBER. DONALD TRUMP SENDS 
OUT A TWEET SAYING MIKE PENCE 

08:03:10.195 --> 08:03:12.689
LACKED COURAGE OR EGGING THEM ON
SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD 

08:03:12.909 --> 08:03:15.239
WAS ESSENTIALLY, AND IT WAS -- 
IT WAS ALSO COLLABORATED BY A 

08:03:15.460 --> 08:03:17.941
SENATOR THAT WAS ON THE PHONE 
WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE TOLD 

08:03:18.157 --> 08:03:20.735
THAT THEY HAD BEEN USHERED OUT 
OF THE CHAMBER BUT AT ONE POINT 

08:03:20.935 --> 08:03:23.223
WE HAD THIS VERY IRRITATED 
RESPONSE THAT SAID WE 

08:03:27.215 --> 08:03:29.497
DON'T KNOW, AND THE AVAILABLE 
CHRONOLOGY WE HAVE IS OF COURSE 

08:03:29.698 --> 08:03:31.698
HE DID. OF COURSE 

08:03:34.529 --> 08:03:36.839
HE DID. HE WAS TALKING TO A 
SITTING SENATOR ON THE PHONE 

08:03:37.040 --> 08:03:39.132
AFTER THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS 
HUSTLED OFF THE FLOOR. THAT WAS 

08:03:39.332 --> 08:03:43.159
ONE BIT. YOU KNOW I WANT TO 
AMPLIFY IT A LITTLE BIT. THAT 

08:03:43.380 --> 08:03:46.679
WAS ALL EYES ON THE REPUBLICANS 
DAY. NOT JUST THE SIX WHO MIGHT 

08:03:46.880 --> 08:03:51.439
BE INCLINED TO FORGET THE 
PREVIOUS TEST VOTE BUT THE 

08:03:51.648 --> 08:03:57.150
OTHERS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS 
TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY VOTED TO 

08:03:57.370 --> 08:04:01.320
ACQUIT. AND ON SOME OF THOSE I 
THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 

08:04:01.541 --> 08:04:05.090
THEY KEPT COMING BACK TO THIS 
IDEA THAT THIS IS A PROCESS 

08:04:05.310 --> 08:04:07.400
FUELED BY HATE FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT REMINDING HIM THAT IT 

08:04:07.620 --> 08:04:10.340
HAD BEEN 74 MILLION VOTES AND IT
ALL FELT KIND 

08:04:13.650 --> 08:04:15.929
OF LIKE IT WOULD BE A PITY IF 
YOU LOST IT. 

08:04:15.930 --> 08:04:18.662
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT. LET'S PLAY ONE OF 
THESE INTERACTIONS WE ARE 

08:04:19.076 --> 08:04:22.875
TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS A 
QUESTION FROM REPUBLICAN 

08:04:23.098 --> 08:04:25.770
SENATORS LISA MURKOWSKI AND THEY
ASKED ABOUT THIS CRUCIAL 

08:04:25.990 --> 08:04:28.420
TIMELINE WHEN DID DONALD TRUMP 
KNOW ABOUT THE BREACH OF THE 

08:04:28.636 --> 08:04:33.106
CAPITAL AND THEY WANTED THE 
LEGAL TEAM TO BE AS SPECIFIC AS 

08:04:33.306 --> 08:04:37.295
POSSIBLE. WELCOME AS YOU BEEN 
HEARING, THEIR RESPONSE WAS NOT 

08:04:37.496 --> 08:04:41.901
SPECIFIC AT ALL. LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE ABLE TO PIECE TOGETHER

08:04:43.980 --> 08:04:47.770
A TIMELINE AND IT GOES ALL THE 
WAY BACK TO DECEMBER 31st, 

08:04:49.601 --> 08:04:53.990
JANUARY SECOND, THERE WAS A LOT 
OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE 

08:04:55.045 --> 08:05:00.471
AUTHORITIES AND GETTING FOLKS TO
HAVE SECURITY BEFOREHAND ON THE 

08:05:00.671 --> 08:05:06.090
DAY WE HAVE A TWEET AT 2:38, 
THAT WAS CERTAINLY SOMETIME 

08:05:06.912 --> 08:05:13.794
BEFORE THEN, WITH THE RUSH TO 
RING THIS IMPEACHMENT THERE HAS 

08:05:14.000 --> 08:05:16.000
BEEN 

08:05:18.993 --> 08:05:21.139
ABSOLUTELY NO FOR THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THESE ARE THE ATTORNEYS IT'S 

08:05:21.277 --> 08:05:23.775
NOT LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
PHONE NUMBER AND I DON'T NEED TO

08:05:24.632 --> 08:05:26.632
LAUGH BUT THEY PUT ALL THE 
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE 

08:05:27.137 --> 08:05:30.022
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND ACTED 
AS THOUGH ANYTHING THAT THEY 

08:05:31.981 --> 08:05:33.981
COULD ANSWER WOULD HAVE HAD TO 
HAVE BEEN 

08:05:38.451 --> 08:05:40.943
EVIDENCE INTRODUCED PRIOR TO 
THIS Q&amp;amp;A. THAT IS NOT THE CASE 

08:05:41.158 --> 08:05:43.247
HERE IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. 
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 

08:05:43.448 --> 08:05:45.448
SENATORS TO ASK QUESTIONS AND 
ATTORNEYS TO 

08:05:49.752 --> 08:05:51.752
ANSWER THEMSELVES.

08:06:09.841 --> 08:06:11.935
IT REALLY WAS AND THEY CLEARLY 
FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY HAVE 

08:06:12.135 --> 08:06:14.622
THE VOTES TO WIN THE TRIAL AND 
THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED TO PROVIDE

08:06:14.842 --> 08:06:16.721
ANY NEW INFORMATION. THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS NOTED THAT 

08:06:16.722 --> 08:06:22.187
HE HAD BEEN INVITED TO TESTIFY 
AND REFUSED TO COME. AT ONE 

08:06:22.387 --> 08:06:28.047
POINT, THEY DID ACTUALLY SAY 
PENCE WAS NOT TOLD THAT -- OR 

08:06:28.247 --> 08:06:34.518
TRUMP WAS NOT TOLD ANYTIME THEY 
HAVE SAID PUBLICLY AND ON THE 

08:06:34.718 --> 08:06:37.398
RECORD ONE OF THE MOST LOYAL 
THAT HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT 

08:06:37.606 --> 08:06:39.606
BEFORE HE 

08:06:42.822 --> 08:06:45.505
WENT ON TO TWEET MORE CRITICISM 
SO IT REALLY DOESN'T EVEN PASS 

08:06:45.712 --> 08:06:47.805
THE SMELL TEST THAT THAT IS EVEN
TRUTHFUL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY 

08:06:48.007 --> 08:06:52.783
THEY DID NOT GIVE THESE KEY ON 
THE FENCE REPUBLICANS SORT OF 

08:06:52.999 --> 08:06:55.493
THE ASSURANCES THAT THEY NEEDED.
THEY KIND OF CEDED BACKGROUND 

08:06:55.694 --> 08:07:00.475
ESSENTIALLY BY NOT OFFERING AS 
THEY COULD HAVE ANY EXCULPATORY 

08:07:00.693 --> 08:07:02.983
EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THE IDEA 
THAT TRUMP WAS NOT REVELING IN 

08:07:05.512 --> 08:07:07.512
THE MAYHEM AND WAS WATCHING IT 
ALL PLAY OUT ON 

08:07:11.813 --> 08:07:13.662
CABLE TELEVISION AND NOT TAKING 
PEOPLE'S CALLS, PLEADING FOR 

08:07:13.663 --> 08:07:15.663
HELP AND NOT INVOLVED IN THE 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL 

08:07:15.773 --> 08:07:18.103
GUARD ABOUT DEPLOYING TROOPS TO 
SAVE THE CAPITAL. SO, JUST 

08:07:18.323 --> 08:07:23.158
SUBSTITUTE TO LEAVE IT WAS A 
PRETTY DAMNING EVIDENCE BECAUSE 

08:07:23.359 --> 08:07:27.563
THEY CHOSE NOT TO USE THEIR TIME
EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON 

08:07:31.338 --> 08:07:33.338
TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
WAS DOING DURING THESE HOURS 

08:07:33.410 --> 08:07:35.410
THEY DIDN'T INTRODUCE ANY 
EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT WORK TO HIS 

08:07:35.506 --> 08:07:37.506
BENEFIT AND THEN THEY REFUSED TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THESE 

08:07:37.603 --> 08:07:40.496
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO WANT A 
REASON TO ACQUIT TRUMP. 

08:07:45.523 --> 08:07:48.025
THEY MIGHT NOT GIVE THEM 
ANYTHING TO HANG THEIR HAT ON SO

08:07:48.225 --> 08:07:50.225
ULTIMATELY IN TERMS OF WATCHING 
THOSE REPUBLICANS IT IS PRETTY 

08:07:50.340 --> 08:07:52.643
BAD AFTERNOON FOR THE DEFENSE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW, AND JAMES I THINK 

08:07:52.844 --> 08:07:55.545
WHAT YOU SAID SAID WAS SO 
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE QUESTION

08:07:55.745 --> 08:07:57.745
WILL BE CANNOT 

08:08:01.164 --> 08:08:03.164
ANSWER SATISFY

08:08:11.723 --> 08:08:13.824
BECAUSE LISA MURKOWSKI FOR 
EXAMPLE HAS A LEGAL MIND A LAW 

08:08:14.044 --> 08:08:15.922
BACKGROUND SHE'S LOOKING FOR THE
SPECIFIC ANSWERS TO UNDERSTAND 

08:08:15.923 --> 08:08:18.634
AND GAIN SOME INSIGHT INTO WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING, WHEN 

08:08:18.848 --> 08:08:22.424
DID HE KNOW, WHEN DID HE KNOW IT

08:08:26.624 --> 08:08:29.117
AND IT DID GIVE THEM SORT OF 
INABILITY TO SAY, OKAY, I'VE HAD

08:08:29.331 --> 08:08:31.331
THE QUESTION ANSWERED AND NOW I 
CAN PLAN TO 

08:08:35.034 --> 08:08:36.476
ACQUIT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EXACTLY. AND IT IS IMPORTANT 

08:08:36.477 --> 08:08:38.477
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF
MIND REALLY DOES MATTER. EVEN 

08:08:43.445 --> 08:08:47.219
IF REPUBLICANS INTEND ON PUSHING
THIS IDEA THAT THE BRANDENBURG 

08:08:47.420 --> 08:08:49.501
STANDARD THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
DURING THE LAST BREAK HAS TO 

08:08:49.714 --> 08:08:51.658
APPLY AND IN TERMS OF THE 
BRANDENBURG STANDARD, TRUMPS 

08:08:51.659 --> 08:08:53.745
INDIFFERENCE TO THE RIOT AS IT 
WAS TAKING PLACE ACTUALLY DOES 

08:08:53.946 --> 08:08:57.324
HELP SATISFY THE LEGAL STANDARD.
AGAIN WHAT IS IMPUTABLE IS NOT 

08:08:57.546 --> 08:09:02.307
THE SAME AS WHAT IS THE LEGAL 
BUT IT DOES SHOW THAT TRUMP WAS 

08:09:02.508 --> 08:09:05.864
MORE FOCUSED ON STOPPING THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE RESULTS AND

08:09:09.221 --> 08:09:11.221
NOT COMING TO HIS AID OR 
CHECKING ON PENCE 

08:09:14.667 --> 08:09:16.667
AND INDEED PENCE ALLIES AND 
AIDES DON'T FEEL THAT THE 

08:09:16.768 --> 08:09:18.234
CHARACTERIZATION FROM THE 
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER WAS ACCURATE 

08:09:18.235 --> 08:09:20.235
AT ALL. THEY HAVE A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP AND 

08:09:24.683 --> 08:09:26.799
OF COURSE TRUMP WAS WORRIED. 
THERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE TO 

08:09:27.000 --> 08:09:29.000
SUPPORT THAT AND IF THERE WAS, 
TRUMPS LAWYERS HAD EVERY 

08:09:29.078 --> 08:09:31.078
OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE IT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WHERE DOES THIS GO 

08:09:31.371 --> 08:09:33.371
FROM HERE? WHAT IS THE LITERAL 
PROCESS GOING FORWARD FOR 

08:09:33.482 --> 08:09:35.975
TOMORROW BUT ALSO WHERE DO 
SENATORS MIND HAVE 

08:09:39.945 --> 08:09:42.666
TO GO OVER HERE AND WHAT DO THEY
NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT AS 

08:09:42.880 --> 08:09:46.024
THEY HEAD INTO WHAT IS 
POTENTIALLY THE FINAL DAY? 

08:09:46.025 --> 08:09:48.025
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, PROCEDURALLY WHAT 
HAPPENS NEXT IS THEY ARE GOING 

08:09:48.136 --> 08:09:50.215
TO START UP AT 10 A.M. AS WE 
JUST HEARD THE 

08:09:55.216 --> 08:09:57.786
MAJORITY LEADER SAY AND THEY 
WILL START WITH A VOTE TO SEE IF

08:09:58.005 --> 08:10:00.285
THEY WANT TO BRING IN WITNESSES 
OF COURSE THEY'VE ALREADY SAID 

08:10:00.505 --> 08:10:02.505
THAT THEY WILL PUT IT TO 

08:10:06.516 --> 08:10:10.907
A VOTE. IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY 
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT, SENATE 

08:10:11.106 --> 08:10:13.106
REPUBLICANS TONIGHT FOR ANYBODY 
WHO'S 

08:10:16.965 --> 08:10:18.965
IN THAT

08:10:24.940 --> 08:10:27.220
MAY BECOME WHO HASN'T EXPLICITLY
SAID WHAT WAY THEY ARE GOING TO 

08:10:27.421 --> 08:10:29.936
VOTE I THINK THEY HAVE TO LOOK 
AT THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS BROUGHT

08:10:30.156 --> 08:10:32.696
TO THEM TODAY. IT WAS A VERY 
SHORT DAY FOR THE DEFENSE TEAM. 

08:10:32.916 --> 08:10:35.216
THEY ONLY TOOK ABOUT TWO AND 
HALF HOURS OF WHAT COULD'VE BEEN

08:10:35.436 --> 08:10:37.966
16 HOURS OF THEIR ARGUMENT AND 
SO IF THERE ARE ANY SENATORS WHO

08:10:38.186 --> 08:10:40.496
ARE WEARING THIS DECISION ON THE
FENCE THEY HAVE TO GO AWAY 

08:10:40.697 --> 08:10:42.697
TONIGHT LOOKING AT IF THERE 
QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED. IF THEY

08:10:42.778 --> 08:10:44.881
FEEL THAT THE DEFENSE TEAM DID A
SATISFACTORY JOB. I THINK 

08:10:49.896 --> 08:10:51.896
ONE THING

08:11:10.918 --> 08:11:13.626
SOME OF THE SENATORS WHO ARE IN 
THAT COLUMN OF WE ARE NOT SURE 

08:11:13.846 --> 08:11:16.538
WHICH WAY THEY ARE GOING TO 
VOTE. WE LOOK BACK AT THIS AND 

08:11:16.740 --> 08:11:21.746
EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET TO THE 
TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE TO 

08:11:21.954 --> 08:11:25.090
CONVICT DONALD TRUMP IT STILL 
MAY BE THE MOST BIPARTISAN 

08:11:25.301 --> 08:11:27.301
IMPEACHMENT VOTE 

08:11:30.527 --> 08:11:32.527
IN HISTORY.

08:11:37.687 --> 08:11:40.857
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MUCH OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
DEFENSE TEAM STRATEGY WAS TO 

08:11:41.058 --> 08:11:43.058
ATTACK THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS IN THEIR DEFENSE OF 

08:11:45.887 --> 08:11:48.017
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT I THINK 
THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT WE SAW 

08:11:48.237 --> 08:11:50.307
TODAY ON THE BROADER SCALE WE 
SAW NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S 

08:11:50.526 --> 08:11:52.526
DEFENSE TEAM 

08:11:55.119 --> 08:11:56.800
GOING AFTER THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, WHAT THEY 

08:11:56.801 --> 08:12:00.772
CALL MANIPULATION OF VIDEO. THEY
MADE THE POINT NUMEROUS TIMES 

08:12:04.137 --> 08:12:05.777
SAYING THAT THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS DIDN'T SHOW

08:12:05.778 --> 08:12:07.778
TRUMP IN HIS 

08:12:10.097 --> 08:12:12.097
FULL REMARKS MAKING THE POINT 
BEFORE SHOWING TRUMPS VIDEOS YOU

08:12:12.197 --> 08:12:15.797
KNOW IN THESE 3 TO 4 MINUTE LONG
SEGMENTS FULLY WHAT HE SAID ON 

08:12:16.006 --> 08:12:18.006
NOT ONLY YOU KNOW THE DAY OF THE
INSURRECTION BUT 

08:12:22.857 --> 08:12:26.749
IN TWEETS AND OTHER SPEECHES 
THAT WE HEARD FROM HIM. I WANT 

08:12:26.951 --> 08:12:29.250
YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN TO BRUCE 
CASTOR, ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

08:12:29.452 --> 08:12:31.452
ATTORNEYS WHO ARGUED 

08:12:33.587 --> 08:12:35.906
THIS TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN AT 
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 

08:12:35.907 --> 08:12:38.387
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU AND 
DIDN'T TELL YOU AND WHAT YOU 

08:12:38.588 --> 08:12:40.824
PROBABLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I 
THINK I'M THE FIRST ONE TO SAY 

08:12:41.037 --> 08:12:43.086
IT, IN THIS FORUM IS THAT 2:38, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP URGED PROTESTERS

08:12:43.286 --> 08:12:45.286
AT THE 

08:12:47.839 --> 08:12:49.701
U.S. CAPITOL TO, QUOTE, STAY 
PEACEFUL, PLEASE SUPPORT OUR 

08:12:49.702 --> 08:12:51.702
CAPITAL POLICE AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, THEY 

08:12:54.919 --> 08:12:57.003
ARE TRULY ON THE SIDE OF OUR 
COUNTRY. STAY PEACEFUL AND 

08:12:57.203 --> 08:12:59.688
BEFORE WE RUN THE GRAPHIC I JUST
WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU 

08:12:59.908 --> 08:13:03.425
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SPEECH ENDED 
AT 1:11 P.M., SO, AT 2:38 P.M. 

08:13:03.627 --> 08:13:06.548
BY THE TIME WORD REACHES THE 
PRESIDENT THAT THERE IS A 

08:13:06.749 --> 08:13:12.833
PROBLEM DOWN HERE, HE'S OUT 
URGING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THE 

08:13:13.033 --> 08:13:19.304
POLICE, STAY PEACEFUL, SUPPORT 
OUR CAPITAL POLICE AND LAW 

08:13:19.506 --> 08:13:21.506
ENFORCEMENT, THEY ARE ON THE 
SIDE OF THE COUNTRY, 

08:13:26.198 --> 08:13:28.198
STAY PEACEFUL.

08:13:35.230 --> 08:13:37.838
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SHOULD'VE BEEN TO SAY THAT
HE DID NOT INCITE THE VIOLENCE, 

08:13:37.988 --> 08:13:39.988
THE INSURRECTION ON THE CAPITAL 
ON THAT DAY, JANUARY SIX. 

08:13:40.068 --> 08:13:42.068
HOWEVER, HERE BRUCE CASTOR IS 
BRINGING UP ANOTHER TWEET FROM 

08:13:42.158 --> 08:13:45.908
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WE SHOULD 
PUT WEIGHT ON WHAT HE SAID AS 

08:13:46.109 --> 08:13:48.631
THE INSURRECTION WAS GOING ON SO
I JUST WANTED TO DROP ON THAT 

08:13:49.231 --> 08:13:51.231
POINT 

08:13:54.239 --> 08:13:57.134
BECAUSE CASTOR ARGUING THAT 
TRUMPS WORDS WHEN HE'S CALLING 

08:13:57.334 --> 08:13:59.394
FOR PEACE AS THE INSURRECTION IS
TAKING PLACE, AS COPS ARE 

08:13:59.599 --> 08:14:01.599
GETTING THEIR HEADS 

08:14:04.438 --> 08:14:06.750
BASHED IN BY THIS MOB OF TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS AS BOTH MEMBERS OF 

08:14:06.949 --> 08:14:08.949
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE ARE 
BEING EVACUATED DURING THIS 

08:14:09.035 --> 08:14:11.035
INSURRECTION THAT IS TAKING 
PLACE, CASTOR IS IN EFFECT 

08:14:12.419 --> 08:14:15.949
ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING
INTO CONSIDERATION TRUMPS TWEETS

08:14:16.169 --> 08:14:19.091
AT THAT TIME, CALLING FOR PEACE 
YET REALLY NOT DRAWING 

08:14:23.062 --> 08:14:25.345
ANY EQUIVALENTS TO THE FACT THAT
WE SHOULD BE PUTTING ANY WEIGHT 

08:14:25.553 --> 08:14:28.089
ON TRUMPS WORDS PRIOR TO THE 
INSURRECTION SO LOGIC WOULD 

08:14:28.309 --> 08:14:30.309
REALLY TELL YOU THAT TRUMPS 
WORDS CARRY SOME 

08:14:32.981 --> 08:14:34.981
INHERENT POWER BOTH BEFORE AND 
AFTER THE INSURRECTION WE DID 

08:14:35.082 --> 08:14:38.209
SEE SOME EXAMPLES OF TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS AT THAT INSURRECTION 

08:14:38.429 --> 08:14:42.779
YELLING OVER A MEGAPHONE THAT 
TRUMP HAS TWEETED FOR US TO GO 

08:14:42.982 --> 08:14:45.060
HOME SO THEY CLEARLY WERE 
LISTENING TO HIM AND I THINK 

08:14:45.274 --> 08:14:48.229
DRAWING ON CASTERS POINT IS THAT
TRUMPS WORDS DID HAVE WEIGHT 

08:14:48.448 --> 08:14:50.448
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER AND SORT 

08:14:54.049 --> 08:14:56.049
OF THAT RESPONSE HAS CLEARLY 
BEEN ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO THE 

08:14:56.150 --> 08:14:59.649
INSURRECTION TAKING PLACE. I 
ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT 

08:14:59.869 --> 08:15:01.728
THERE WAS THIS MOMENT DURING THE
QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PORTION OF 

08:15:01.729 --> 08:15:05.689
THE DEBATE TODAY WHERE TRUMPS 
DEFENSE TURNED TO HOUSE 

08:15:06.550 --> 08:15:10.952
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER AND SAID, 
QUOTE, THERE IS NOTHING 

08:15:15.115 --> 08:15:17.406
FUN HERE, THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST
MISERABLE EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD 

08:15:17.620 --> 08:15:20.149
IN WASHINGTON DC AND IN THAT 
MOMENT HE SEEMED TO HAVE 

08:15:20.350 --> 08:15:25.346
FORGOTTEN THAT LEADER RASKIN HAD
EXPERIENCED THIS CAPITAL 

08:15:25.560 --> 08:15:31.590
INSURRECTION IN PERSON. HE HAD 
HIS FAMILY HERE AND HE MADE VERY

08:15:31.810 --> 08:15:34.140
CLEAR ON DAY ONE OF OPENING 
ARGUMENTS THAT HE WAS THERE THE 

08:15:34.360 --> 08:15:36.360
DAY AFTER THEY HAD BURIED 

08:15:40.180 --> 08:15:44.611
HIS SON. LATER ON WE HEARD 
RASKIN RESPONDING TO TRUMPS 

08:15:44.812 --> 08:15:46.911
COUNSEL SAYING THAT COUNSEL SAID
BEFORE THAT THIS HAS BEEN MY 

08:15:47.112 --> 08:15:49.195
WORST EXPERIENCE IN WASHINGTON 
AND FOR THAT I GUESS I'M SORRY 

08:15:49.396 --> 08:15:51.690
BUT MAN YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
THERE ON JANUARY SIX. I THINK 

08:15:51.910 --> 08:15:54.230
THAT WOMAN REALLY ILLUSTRATES 
THE DIVIDE OF REALITY AND 

08:15:54.450 --> 08:15:58.210
PERSPECTIVE THAT BOTH THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND TRUMPS 

08:15:58.410 --> 08:16:00.510
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS HAVE HAD 
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF TODAY. 

08:16:00.710 --> 08:16:06.086
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, LET'S GO 
BACK TO A LYDIA KNOX. YOU KNOW, 

08:16:06.286 --> 08:16:10.520
THAT MOMENT WAS JUST SORT OF 
CLASSIC TRIAL ATTORNEY, YOU 

08:16:10.721 --> 08:16:12.721
KNOW, GRANDSTANDING SORT OF 

08:16:15.487 --> 08:16:17.561
THING, BUT, IF WE TRACE IT BACK 
WHAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY 

08:16:17.780 --> 08:16:21.342
TALKING ABOUT WAS THAT THE 
CONGRESSMAN WAS USING AN 

08:16:21.553 --> 08:16:23.553
OPPORTUNITY TO SORT 

08:16:25.124 --> 08:16:27.395
OF SAY LOOK YOU SAW THIS VIDEO 
OF ME EARLIER, YOU KNOW, 

08:16:27.610 --> 08:16:29.910
CHALLENGING THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE RESULTS BACK WHEN DONALD

08:16:30.131 --> 08:16:34.942
TRUMP WON BUT HE WAS TRYING TO 
PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHY HE 

08:16:35.144 --> 08:16:37.670
WAS DOING IT AND HOW BUT HE 
BELIEVES IN HIS OPINION IT WAS 

08:16:37.890 --> 08:16:40.180
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENED 
WITH DONALD TRUMP. SO HOW ARE 

08:16:40.380 --> 08:16:42.380
DEMOCRATS DEFENDING SOME OF THAT
TAPE THAT WAS PLAYED EARLIER 

08:16:42.490 --> 08:16:46.030
TODAY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SURE, SOME OF THE TAPE THEY 

08:16:46.250 --> 08:16:49.368
PLAYED MINUTE AFTER MINUTE AFTER
MINUTE OF DEMOCRATS AT EVERY 

08:16:49.581 --> 08:16:51.910
SINGLE LEVEL CALLING ON OTHER 
DEMOCRATS TO FIGHT AND TO 

08:16:52.111 --> 08:16:54.111
BATTLE. ONE 

08:16:57.341 --> 08:16:59.341
QUICK POINT

08:17:01.990 --> 08:17:04.516
, HE WAS WRONG THAT HE WAS THE 
FIRST PERSON TO MENTION THAT 

08:17:04.721 --> 08:17:07.051
TWEET IN THAT FORUM. IN FACT THE
MANAGERS HAD MENTIONED THAT WE 

08:17:07.251 --> 08:17:10.189
BEFORE DURING THEIR PRESENTATION
AND THEIR POINT LARGELY WAS WHAT

08:17:10.400 --> 08:17:12.672
DOES IT MEAN TO SOMEONE THAT HAD
BREACHED THE SENATE CHAMBER AND 

08:17:14.141 --> 08:17:16.030
HAS BEEN RIFLING THROUGH 
SENATORS DESKS, WHAT DOES IT 

08:17:16.031 --> 08:17:18.976
MEAN FOR THAT PERSON TO STAY 
PEACEFUL? RAPIDLY NOT A WHOLE 

08:17:19.175 --> 08:17:23.774
HECK OF A LOT. I THINK THE FOCUS
ON THE JANUARY 6th SPEECH WAS 

08:17:23.976 --> 08:17:26.087
PROBABLY SOME OF THE BEST STUFF 
THAT HIS LAWYERS DID. THE 

08:17:26.288 --> 08:17:30.500
ARGUMENT THAT HE WAS USING 
RHETORIC THAT IS COMMON TO 

08:17:30.701 --> 08:17:32.554
POLITICS, HAMMERING THAT HOME 
WITH SCORES OF DEMOCRATS TALKING

08:17:32.555 --> 08:17:34.555
ABOUT FIGHTING 

08:17:36.086 --> 08:17:37.770
DOING BATTLE, PUNCHING, YOU 
KNOW, WARNING THAT THEIR 

08:17:37.771 --> 08:17:39.650
OPPONENTS WOULD REAP THE 
WHIRLWIND, THINGS LIKE THAT AND 

08:17:39.651 --> 08:17:41.731
THEN ZEROING IN ON THE 
PRESIDENTS EXPECTATION TO 

08:17:46.351 --> 08:17:48.351
THE PEOPLE TO GO PEACEFULLY AND 
PATRIOTICALLY AND MAKE THEIR 

08:17:48.641 --> 08:17:53.032
VOICES KNOWN, THAT GIVE US 
ANOTHER GREAT MOMENT OF TRIAL 

08:17:57.206 --> 08:17:59.067
LAWYER GRANDSTANDING WHICH WAS 
MANAGER RASKIN GETTING UP AND 

08:17:59.068 --> 08:18:01.992
SAYING IF YOU ROB A BANK ON YOUR
WAY OUT THE DOOR YOU CALL OUT 

08:18:02.211 --> 08:18:04.211
RESPECT PRIVATE PROPERTY, THAT 
IS NOT A DEFENSE AGAINST ROBBING

08:18:04.281 --> 08:18:06.782
THE BANK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW, SUCH AN INTERESTING

08:18:06.982 --> 08:18:09.288
ARGUMENT AND I THINK IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT YOU POINT OUT 

08:18:09.489 --> 08:18:13.035
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT THAT STAY PEACEFUL AND 

08:18:13.235 --> 08:18:15.517
THEY WERE SORT OF PREDICTING 
THAT WOULD COME UP AND TRY TO 

08:18:15.722 --> 08:18:19.672
SORT OF GIVE A REBUTTAL. BEFORE 
WE LET YOU GO WHAT ARE YOU 

08:18:19.892 --> 08:18:21.892
WATCHING FOR TOMORROW? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE 

08:18:24.932 --> 08:18:26.801
SIX REPUBLICANS WHO JOINED 
DEMOCRATS TO SAY THIS WHOLE 

08:18:26.802 --> 08:18:30.367
PROCESS SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. YOU
KNOW, THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE A 

08:18:30.582 --> 08:18:32.882
COUPLE OF OTHER OUTLIERS FOR THE
SIX SENATORS THAT I'M REALLY 

08:18:33.100 --> 08:18:36.872
WATCHING MOST CLOSELY. THERE'S 
NOT A LOT OF SUSPENSE ABOUT 

08:18:37.092 --> 08:18:39.092
REALLY ANYBODY ELSE IN THAT 
ROOM. ONE OF THE 

08:18:42.562 --> 08:18:44.663
BIG QUESTIONS HAS TO DO WITH 
SENATOR CASSIDY OF LOUISIANA WHO

08:18:44.863 --> 08:18:46.944
VOTED WITH THE DEMOCRATS TO 
PROCEED TO THIS, HE HAS 

08:18:47.145 --> 08:18:49.207
INDICATED THAT HE HAS AN OPEN 
MIND BUZZ AS OUR COLLEAGUE 

08:18:49.832 --> 08:18:53.158
REPORTED EARLIER TODAY HE WAS 
SEEN WALKING THROUGH THE 

08:18:53.359 --> 08:18:55.359
HALLWAYS WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE A
DRAFT STATEMENT EXPANDING WHY 

08:18:59.662 --> 08:19:03.812
HE HAD DECIDED TO ACQUIT DONALD 
TRUMP. 

08:19:06.056 --> 08:19:09.975
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YES WE HAVE ONE OF OUR 

08:19:10.160 --> 08:19:11.571
PHOTOGRAPHERS THAT CAUGHT THAT 
IMAGE OF WHAT SENATOR CASSIDY 

08:19:11.572 --> 08:19:13.375
WAS LOOKING AT AND WORKING ON 
AND IT WAS A DRAFT OF COMMENTS 

08:19:13.376 --> 08:19:15.376
THAT 

08:19:17.174 --> 08:19:19.268
WOULD ACQUIT DONALD TRUMP, NOW, 
THAT IS NOT, YOU KNOW, A 

08:19:19.470 --> 08:19:22.835
PREDICTION OF WHAT HE'S GOING TO
DO, RIGHT, THERE'S SOME PUSHBACK

08:19:23.035 --> 08:19:25.516
ON HIS OFFICE FROM THAT BUT IT 
DID LAY OUT ONE ARGUMENT, ONE 

08:19:27.208 --> 08:19:29.208
POSSIBLE ARGUMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, AND SAYING THEY 

08:19:31.962 --> 08:19:34.480
HAD DRAFTS FOR BOTH SIDES. WE 
DIDN'T SEE THAT DRAFT BUT WE DID

08:19:34.695 --> 08:19:36.984
SHOW THERE WAS A SCENARIO WHERE 
MOST OF THESE REPUBLICANS END UP

08:19:37.198 --> 08:19:41.783
COMING HOME. IT IS GOING TO BE 
REALLY HARD FOR MICHALUK AND 

08:19:42.003 --> 08:19:46.383
COLLINS AND ROMNEY AFTER THEY 
REALLY DIDN'T GET ANY ANSWERS TO

08:19:46.584 --> 08:19:49.892
THE QUESTIONS TO JUSTIFY NOT 
DOING SO. REMEMBER A YEAR AGO 

08:19:50.093 --> 08:19:54.072
THAT ROMNEY BECAME THE FIRST 
PERSON TO VOTE TO REMOVE/CONVICT

08:19:54.293 --> 08:19:57.613
A PRESIDENT OF HIS OWN PARTY IN 
AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN AMERICAN

08:19:57.833 --> 08:19:59.833
HISTORY. THIS IS THE 

08:20:03.089 --> 08:20:04.753
FOURTH IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF A 
PRESIDENT/FORMER PRESIDENT IN 

08:20:04.754 --> 08:20:06.836
U.S. HISTORY AND IT SEEMS 
CERTAIN THAT'S THIS WILL BE THE 

08:20:07.034 --> 08:20:14.142
MOST BIPARTISAN BUT IT CAN BE 
ONE, TWO OR THREE AS OPPOSED TO 

08:20:14.362 --> 08:20:17.673
SIX. IT DOES FEEL LIKE TRIBALISM
IS TRUMPS 

08:20:21.269 --> 08:20:23.315
FRIEND HERE. IT WAS ALSO 
STRIKING I WILL SAY THAT MICHAEL

08:20:23.516 --> 08:20:29.583
VANDER WIEN REFUSED THE QUESTION
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP LOST 

08:20:29.791 --> 08:20:35.429
THE ELECTION. HE REFUSED TO SAY,
AS BRUCE CASTOR HAVE SAID ON THE

08:20:35.633 --> 08:20:37.633
TUESDAY, THAT THE VOTERS HAD 
REJECTED 

08:20:42.103 --> 08:20:45.034
TRUMP AND THE SANDERS QUESTIONS 
THAT WAS TRUMP ENGAGED IN A BIG 

08:20:45.235 --> 08:20:47.784
LIE BY CLAIMING THAT HE HAD WON 
IN A LANDSLIDE ON THE SPEECH 

08:20:47.986 --> 08:20:49.986
JANUARY SIX AND HE 

08:20:51.755 --> 08:20:55.748
DIDN'T ANSWER, THE AUDIENCE 
REALLY IS TRUMP IN HIS BASE OF 

08:21:00.753 --> 08:21:04.883
CORE SUPPORTERS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS A SENSE WHAT THEY'VE 

08:21:05.104 --> 08:21:07.104
BEEN GIVEN IN TERMS OF FODDER 

08:21:09.308 --> 08:21:14.108
TO JUSTIFY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
I DO WANT TO PLAY A CLIP OF 

08:21:14.323 --> 08:21:16.807
THAT. AND I THINK WE WILL HEAR 
THE QUESTION HERE AND THEN WE 

08:21:17.008 --> 08:21:19.008
WILL GET A 

08:21:22.424 --> 08:21:24.424
SENSE OF

08:21:26.644 --> 08:21:28.503
HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TEAM 
DIDN'T REALLY ANSWER IT. LET'S 

08:21:28.504 --> 08:21:29.733
WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE PROSECUTORS HAVE 

08:21:29.734 --> 08:21:31.734
STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PERPETRATING

08:21:31.774 --> 08:21:33.884
A BIG LIE WHEN HE REPEATEDLY 
CLAIMED THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

08:21:34.104 --> 08:21:39.320
STOLEN FROM HIM AND THAT HE 
ACTUALLY WON THE ELECTION BY A 

08:21:39.521 --> 08:21:41.521
LANDSLIDE. ARE THE PROSECUTORS 
RIGHT WHEN THEY CLAIM THAT TRUMP

08:21:41.591 --> 08:21:43.591
WAS TELLING A 

08:21:45.544 --> 08:21:48.064
BIG LIE? OR IN YOUR JUDGMENT, 
DID TRUMP ACTUALLY WIN THE 

08:21:48.284 --> 08:21:51.814
ELECTION? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN MY JUDGMENT, IT IS 

08:21:52.034 --> 08:21:54.034
IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION 
BEFORE 

08:21:56.444 --> 08:21:58.153
THIS BODY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, RHONDA COLDEN, THE 

08:21:58.154 --> 08:22:01.644
ATTORNEYS FOR DONALD TRUMP NOT 
GOING ON THE RECORD HERE TONIGHT

08:22:01.864 --> 08:22:03.864
AND SAYING, CLEARLY, THAT TRUMP 
LOST 

08:22:06.494 --> 08:22:08.494
THE ELECTION, JOE BIDEN WON THE 
ELECTION, THEY JUST DIDN'T 

08:22:08.586 --> 08:22:10.586
ANSWER IT. 

08:22:12.371 --> 08:22:14.459
AT FIRST HE DEFLECTED AND SAID 
IT WASN'T RELEVANT THAN THE 

08:22:14.664 --> 08:22:17.594
QUESTION ITSELF WASN'T RELEVANT 
TO TONIGHT'S PROCEEDINGS. 

08:22:17.595 --> 08:22:23.224
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, IT MAY INDICATE THAT HE
MAY NOT TAKE THAT TYPE OF 

08:22:23.444 --> 08:22:27.009
QUESTION ON EVEN THOUGH THAT IS 
IN REALLY AT THE CORE BECAUSE 

08:22:29.491 --> 08:22:33.634
DONALD TRUMP TOOK HER TO THE 
RHETORIC HE WAS CLAIMING IT WAS 

08:22:33.844 --> 08:22:36.979
RELEVANT IT WAS REALLY AT THE 
CORE THAT KIND OF AMPED UP 

08:22:41.994 --> 08:22:43.994
THIS CROWD. SO IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T 

08:22:44.051 --> 08:22:46.524
ANTICIPATED BUT IT SEEMED THAT 
IT GAVE SUCH A QUICK ANSWER OF 

08:22:46.725 --> 08:22:51.286
SAYING IT WAS A IN THE RELEVANT 
POINT THAT SAYS HE WASN'T MAYBE 

08:22:51.487 --> 08:22:56.104
INTERESTED TO ADDRESS THAT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY READING OF THAT WAS WHY 

08:22:56.305 --> 08:22:58.305
WOULD HE ANSWER THAT. HE WANTED 
TO 

08:23:01.096 --> 08:23:03.178
DEFLECT THAT. HE HAS TWO 
CHOICES. HE CAN SAY TRUMP LOST 

08:23:03.814 --> 08:23:05.814
THE ELECTION, WHICH WILL AND FOR
YOUR EAT 

08:23:09.272 --> 08:23:11.765
HIS CLIENT, DONALD TRUMP, OR YOU
CAN LIE AND SAY TRUMP WON THE 

08:23:11.984 --> 08:23:16.114
ELECTION WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT 
BASED ON REALITY. SO YOU KNOW, 

08:23:16.333 --> 08:23:18.616
WHERE DO YOU GO WITH IT? JUST 
DEFLECT AND TAKE THE OFFRAMP. 

08:23:18.816 --> 08:23:20.816
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TRUMPS PREVIOUSLY LAWYERS, 
THE FIRST TEAM THAT WAS THE 

08:23:22.576 --> 08:23:27.158
SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT HIM QUIT 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED HE WANTED 

08:23:27.373 --> 08:23:29.373
THEM 

08:23:32.385 --> 08:23:36.405
TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM AND

08:23:36.606 --> 08:23:38.606
THAT THAT JUSTIFIED HIS BEHAVIOR
ON JANUARY SIX. THOSE LAWYERS 

08:23:38.676 --> 08:23:41.371
REFUSED TO DO THAT SO HE PARTED 
WAYS WITH THEM AND THEY ENDED UP

08:23:41.575 --> 08:23:45.559
WITH THIS TEAM. AND THE VIDEO 
GOES ON AND HE GETS EVEN TESTY 

08:23:49.090 --> 08:23:52.215
OR AND HE LITERALLY HAS 
BILLBOARDS IN PHILADELPHIA WHEN 

08:23:52.434 --> 08:23:55.985
YOU GET AN ACCIDENT THIS IS NOT 
A 

08:24:00.999 --> 08:24:05.564
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR. IT IS, 
THAT IS A STANDARD TRIAL LAWYER 

08:24:06.005 --> 08:24:09.725
BLUSTERING TECHNIQUE TO DISTRACT
FROM THE QUESTION AS AT HAND 

08:24:14.355 --> 08:24:16.211
AND ULTIMATELY IT IS A 
REFLECTION OF THEIR CONFIDENCE 

08:24:16.212 --> 08:24:21.025
THAT THEY HAVE THE VOTES. IF IT 
WAS A CLOSE CALL ABOUT WHETHER 

08:24:21.248 --> 08:24:23.248
THEY WERE GOING TO BE 17 
REPUBLICANS REFLECTING I THINK 

08:24:23.335 --> 08:24:25.429
YOU WOULD'VE SEEN HIM SAY OF 
COURSE PRESIDENT BIDEN WON THE 

08:24:27.095 --> 08:24:30.060
ELECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND JOAQUIN CASTRO REJECTED 

08:24:30.261 --> 08:24:32.261
THE NOTION THAT HIS SPEECH WAS 
PROTECTED 

08:24:35.095 --> 08:24:38.897
BY THE BUT IT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND
ASKED THEM TO THINK ABOUT WHY 

08:24:39.098 --> 08:24:40.957
THE MOB CAME TO THE CAPITAL ON 
JANUARY SIX. 

08:24:40.958 --> 08:24:42.958
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD TRUMP 

08:24:47.238 --> 08:24:50.617
SPENT MONTHS INCITING PEOPLE TO 
BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTION WAS 

08:24:50.817 --> 08:24:53.093
STOLEN AND THAT WAS THE POINT, 
THAT WAS THE THING THAT WOULD 

08:24:53.292 --> 08:24:58.046
GET PEOPLE SO ANGRY. THINK ABOUT
THAT. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET 

08:24:58.265 --> 08:25:00.962
A LARGE GROUP OF THOUSANDS OF 
AMERICANS SO ANGRY TO STORM 

08:25:04.085 --> 08:25:06.810
THE CAPITAL. THAT WAS THE 
PURPOSE BEHIND DONALD TRUMP 

08:25:07.011 --> 08:25:10.586
SAYING THAT THE ELECTION HAD 
BEEN RIGGED AND THAT THE 

08:25:10.786 --> 08:25:14.336
ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN AND TO 
BE CLEAR WHEN HE SAYS THE 

08:25:14.556 --> 08:25:16.871
ELECTION IS STOLEN, WHAT HE'S 
SAYING IS THAT THE VICTORY AND 

08:25:17.071 --> 08:25:19.370
HE EVEN SAYS ONE TIME, THE 
ELECTION VICTORY IS BEING STOLEN

08:25:23.161 --> 08:25:25.161
FROM THEM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING IN 

08:25:29.227 --> 08:25:31.227
NATIONAL REPORTER

08:25:34.016 --> 08:25:36.106
, HANNAH JEWELL, ON THIS VERY 
TOPIC. SHE'S BEEN REPORTING ON 

08:25:36.326 --> 08:25:38.446
THE AMERICANS WHO CAME TO THE 
CAPITAL JANUARY SIX. SO HANNAH, 

08:25:38.646 --> 08:25:40.748
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THEIR
MOTIVATION AND THEIR ATTEMPT? 

08:25:40.950 --> 08:25:43.432
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FROM MY REPORTING AND MUCH OF
THE EVIDENCE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

08:25:43.646 --> 08:25:45.756
LAST FOUR DAYS WE KNOW THIS 
GROUP OF RIDERS EXPAND CLASS 

08:25:45.976 --> 08:25:48.056
DIVIDE THE GEOGRAPHY. WE KNOW 
THAT SOME WRITERS WERE PART OF 

08:25:48.276 --> 08:25:50.385
FAR RIGHT GROUPS WHO PLANNED 
THIS ATTACK WEEKS AND MONTHS IN 

08:25:50.587 --> 08:25:52.587
ADVANCE AND SOME 

08:25:56.018 --> 08:25:58.018
WERE NOT

08:25:59.957 --> 08:26:01.957
BUT THE THING THAT THEY ALL 
SHARED, THE MOST IMPORTANT 

08:26:02.069 --> 08:26:04.159
MOTIVATING FACTOR OF COURSE IS 
THAT THEY ALL BELIEVE THAT TRUMP

08:26:04.373 --> 08:26:06.662
WON THE ELECTION AND HAD HIS 
VICTORY STOLEN FROM HIM AND AS 

08:26:06.863 --> 08:26:08.863
RHONDA WAS SAYING WE EVEN HEARD 
TRUMPS LAWYER UNWILLING TO 

08:26:08.949 --> 08:26:10.949
ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER 
THE ELECTION WAS FRAUDULENT OR 

08:26:11.018 --> 08:26:13.120
NOT. HE WOULDN'T SAY EITHER WAY.
WE HEARD TODAY SENATOR PADILLA 

08:26:13.320 --> 08:26:15.320
FROM CALIFORNIA ASK WHETHER THE 
BIG 

08:26:19.398 --> 08:26:21.917
LIE WAS ENOUGH TO RADICALIZE 
ENOUGH AMERICANS TO GET THEM TO 

08:26:22.137 --> 08:26:24.137
STORM THE CAPITAL AND MANAGER 
CASTRO'S REPLY ABOVE THAT WE 

08:26:24.226 --> 08:26:26.226
JUST HEARD SAID THAT IT WAS AND 

08:26:30.269 --> 08:26:32.269
REALLY ANYONE WHO HAS COVERED 
TRUMP RALLIES AND SPOKEN TO 

08:26:32.352 --> 08:26:34.896
TRUMP SUPPORTERS OVER THE LAST 
FOUR YEARS HAS REALLY SEEN THAT 

08:26:35.116 --> 08:26:36.995
RADICALIZATION LAYOUT. I 
REMEMBER BEING AT A TRUMP RALLY 

08:26:36.996 --> 08:26:39.128
IN 2016 AND ONE IN PHILADELPHIA 
RIGHT AS THEY WERE CALLING 

08:26:43.957 --> 08:26:46.056
THE ELECTION AND IT WAS JUST A 
DIFFERENT UNIVERSE OF SPEAKING 

08:26:46.276 --> 08:26:48.276
TO THESE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND 
WHAT THEY WERE OR WEREN'T 

08:26:48.357 --> 08:26:50.648
WILLING TO BELIEVE AND ALSO HOW 
THEY FELT ABOUT BEING A MEMBER 

08:26:50.849 --> 08:26:52.849
OF THE MEDIA. WE'VE 

08:26:56.477 --> 08:26:59.161
ALSO HEARD THE MANAGER SAY THAT 
AS A RESULT OF THE CAPITAL RIOT,

08:26:59.374 --> 08:27:01.458
THE EXTREMIST WHO ATTACKED THE 
CAPITAL WILL BE EMBOLDEN IS WHAT

08:27:01.676 --> 08:27:03.997
SHE SAID. AND THIS IS REALLY THE
BIG QUESTION MOVING FORWARD AND 

08:27:04.217 --> 08:27:06.547
A SCARY ONE, WHERE DOES THE 
EXTREMIST OR EVEN THE CONSPIRACY

08:27:06.748 --> 08:27:09.857
WING OF TRUMP SPACE GO FROM 
HERE? TODAY DOUBLE DOWN ON FALSE

08:27:10.074 --> 08:27:14.869
ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD? DO THEY 
KEEP SAYING ACTUALLY IT WAS NT 

08:27:15.071 --> 08:27:17.071
FOR THAT WE ALSO HEARD FROM 

08:27:19.274 --> 08:27:21.274
TRUMPS LAWYERS. THIS WAS 
ACTUALLY A LEFT WING PLOT WHICH 

08:27:21.353 --> 08:27:23.353
IS OF COURSE 

08:27:26.802 --> 08:27:29.233
TOTALLY DISPROVEN. OR DO THEY 
CLAIM AS SOME REPUBLICAN 

08:27:29.434 --> 08:27:31.525
POLITICIANS NOW DO THAT THE ONLY
THING THAT THEY MEANT BY 

08:27:31.727 --> 08:27:33.807
ELECTION THOUGHT ALL ALONG WAS 
THE WAY THAT CERTAIN STATES SUCH

08:27:34.027 --> 08:27:36.027
AS PENNSYLVANIA EXPANDED THEIR 
MAIL VOTING AND WHICH ONE OF 

08:27:36.137 --> 08:27:38.428
THESE WAYS DOES IT GO WITH 
PEOPLE THAT ARE SO DEEP INTO 

08:27:38.628 --> 08:27:40.628
THIS, NOW, AS THE POSTERS 
REPORTED THE MAJORITY 

08:27:44.708 --> 08:27:46.708
OF REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT THE 
ELECTION 

08:27:50.738 --> 08:27:52.738
WAS FRAUDULENT.

08:27:57.286 --> 08:27:59.177
TRUMPS LAWYER, BRUCE CASTOR, 
ARGUED TODAY THAT TRUMPS SPEECH 

08:27:59.178 --> 08:28:01.267
IS PROTECTED AND NOT INCITING 
BECAUSE HE SAID THE VIOLENCE WAS

08:28:01.487 --> 08:28:03.762
PREPLANNED AND NOT THE RESULT OF
SPEECH BUT OF COURSE THE REASON 

08:28:03.962 --> 08:28:05.962
THE VIOLENCE WAS PREPLANNED WAS 
BECAUSE THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND

08:28:06.097 --> 08:28:08.097
HIS ALLIES HAVE SAID THE 
ELECTION WAS STOLEN FOR MONTHS 

08:28:08.207 --> 08:28:10.207
AND MONTHS AND HONESTLY THE 
TRUTH IS THAT NO 

08:28:14.866 --> 08:28:19.062
HISTORICAL ATROCITY WAS INCITED 
AS THE RESULT OF A SINGLE 

08:28:19.263 --> 08:28:21.577
SPEECH, THAT WAS NEVER THE CASE.
SO IF REPUBLICANS ACCEPT OR SAY 

08:28:21.786 --> 08:28:24.088
THAT THIS RIOT WASN'T THAT BAD, 
VOTE TO ACQUIT, WHAT DOES THAT 

08:28:24.308 --> 08:28:26.308
MEAN FOR 

08:28:29.540 --> 08:28:31.818
FUTURE ATTACKS? DOES THAT ONCE 
AGAIN TELL THE WRITERS THAT 

08:28:32.037 --> 08:28:34.037
THEIR VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE 
PUNISHED? ALTHOUGH IN THE SHORT 

08:28:34.109 --> 08:28:36.109
TERM OF COURSE AROUND 200 
WRITERS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH 

08:28:36.208 --> 08:28:38.518
EVERYTHING FROM MISDEMEANORS TO 
CONSPIRACY, SO, THE COPS AND 

08:28:38.719 --> 08:28:40.719
MESSAGES TO THE PUBLIC IF NOT 

08:28:44.740 --> 08:28:46.858
TO POLITICIANS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HANNAH JEWELL, THANK YOU SO 

08:28:47.078 --> 08:28:49.078
