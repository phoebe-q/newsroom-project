00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.360
How many coats do you have on?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.520
Two please.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.120
How many?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.480
Just two please.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.840 position:56%
Mama how would you describe Grandad?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.680
Huh?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.880
How would you describe Grandad?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.240
I can't describe him.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.200
He's not what you'd expect from

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.040
an 82-year-old grandad.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.160
He still kind of does everything
around the house.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.720
He does all the gardening,
he runs a hiking club.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.880 position:80%
The hip ball and the socket sits over it like that.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.280 position:63%
Mine's basically like, instead of a ball

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.880 position:75%
and a cup it's basically like a cube and a dish,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.080
so mine sits on it like that.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.560 position:66%
And I'd be at work and get halfway through

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.680
the day and just

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 position:72%
be crying in pain and not be able to carry on.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.800 position:66%
I can't bend over at the waist yet to grab

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.320
stuff so he has got me a grabber.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.960 position:58%
For him to be able to say: 'OK, well,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.240 position:61%
if no one's around then you can do this

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.960
and you can do that.'

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.040 position:80%
It's useful cos they don't tell you stuff like that

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.960
when you leave hospital.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.040 position:56%
My nan developed quite bad arthritis

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.160 position:66%
kind of younger than you usually would and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
she will not leave the house
without red lipstick

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.760 position:59%
and red nails, so for the last kind of

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.240 position:69%
30-odd years he has been painting her nails.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880
He just offered to do mine.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.560 position:73%
I didn't even know that he did it, I was always

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.720 position:75%
under the impression that she did it for herself

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.560
but apparently not.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.640 position:67%
Surprised me how good he was, it was better

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.320 position:59%
than when I do them for myself really.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960
Where's the keys?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.080 position:66%
In my pocket so wait until I've done this.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.360
Sorry?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.280 position:63%
I've got an important job at the moment.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 position:58%
I was like: 'Oh my god look at this!'

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.920 position:67%
I was waking up in the middle of the night.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.680
It has just gone crazy.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
They're the least

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.520 position:63%
technological grandparents in the world.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.480
They don't have phones,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.320
they've got one mobile phone that
they share between them

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.920
and I went to put credit on it once

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.120 position:63%
and they hadn't topped it up since 2011.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.760 position:67%
I've had a couple of older women message me

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.600
asking if he's single.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.200 position:66%
Obviously he isn't cos you can hear my nan

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.000
in the background and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.320
she gets a little bit jealous.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.040 position:63%
I don't think she's a massive fan of it.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.040 position:61%
They don't make them like him any more.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.760 position:56%
Everyone's been saying it, they said

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.280 position:67%
they've kind of, they've given him too much

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.400 position:73%
of all the good stuff and now it's all run out.
