00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:04.905
My mom

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.974
is about to meet my dad

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.075
for the first time.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:12.846
I grew up with two moms,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.348
Kathleen and Betsy.

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:15.716
And I really don't

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:16.783
miss having a dad

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:17.985
because they both

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.686
completed a different area

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.488
of me.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.793
This is the family.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:32.799 position:88%
My sister, Sarah, and I have always just had each other.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.568
And I love Sarah to pieces.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.476 position:64%
I always knew that I was donor conceived.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.111
We were imagining you

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.245
18 years from now

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:46.713
meeting this guy

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.749
and we wanted you to like him.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:58.725
I don't think

00:00:58.892 --> 00:00:59.793
I ever

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.729 position:72%
imagined that there could be so many siblings.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.865 position:66%
I thought maybe if I'm lucky I'll find one

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:05.899
or two.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.981
I think we're still trying to

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.015
feel around

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.585
and figure out how we're family.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.118
It's

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.721
completely uncharted territory.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.033
We’re going to go visit Carolyn,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:40.968
my half sister.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.638 position:86%
Carolyn was the first sibling that I made contact with.

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.441 position:61%
So I guess she’s just the introduction,

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.143 position:67%
my introduction to the donor sibling world.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:55.816
Carolyn!

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.751
What up, what up?

00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.486
Your haircut, when did that happen?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.754
That happened like a month ago.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:01.555
I love it.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:02.489
Thank you.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.423
It’s adorable.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.471 position:58%
When I was growing up, I thought that

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.272
maybe I have donor siblings.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.175 position:83%
But then your mom was the first person to contact me!

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.877 position:67%
So that was the like first time I was like:

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.278
'Oh, I have a donor sibling!

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.780
And it’s you!'

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.016
So I thought it was just 19 of us,

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.484
and then Sam popped up,

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.051
and we were like,

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.520 position:72%
'Oh, Sam is another one we didn’t know about.'

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.521
There’s definitely 20 of us.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.524 position:56%
And my mom has an Excel spreadsheet.

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:38.458
She does?

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:42.362 position:64%
Yeah, with everybody that we have to date

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.398
and their parents and contact info.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.209
This is the sperm pipette...

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.377
is that the word? -

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.979
that my mother used.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.050 position:61%
And here you can see that it says 1317.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.087 position:59%
I guess she got this on June 6 of 1995

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:09.022
So she used a little vial and

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.061
syringe to self-inseminate,

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.731 position:75%
and it came in the mail, it was frozen, she said

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:21.034
that she warmed it up like so.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.907 position:66%
I found out my mom was actually in contact

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.009
my entire childhood

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:33.313 position:67%
and even before I was born with other moms.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.851 position:75%
Now that I’m 18, the rest of us are also adults.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:41.354 position:91%
We have established our own relationships with each other.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:48.161 position:98%
She had these probably in her freezer for four to five months before she decided:

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.630 position:73%
today’s the day that I’m going to get pregnant.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:59.739 position:98%
Donor 1317 was originally approved for donation in November 1993,

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.409
since the release of his semen,

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.978 position:67%
we have achieved six confirmed pregnancies.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.080
The donor continues to be healthy.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.050
That is so medical and scientific!

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:21.795
This necklace, it says 1-3-1-7.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.364
And my moms gave it to me

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.433
for my 18th birthday.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.036 position:64%
And I think the number represents less of

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:36.176 position:58%
the donor 1-3-1-7 and more of my moms

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:40.714 position:73%
and my half siblings and that - just my family,

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:43.717 position:59%
it's all different parts of my family.

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.187 position:73%
When we were starting this process first of all

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.689 position:78%
there were two known sperm banks we were aware of,

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.192 position:83%
both in California, that had a known donor programme.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.035 position:86%
So this is the questionnaire we got from the sperm bank

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.637
about your donor.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.939 position:59%
‘Why do you want to be a sperm donor?’

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.943 position:98%
‘Besides the money, which was definitely an incentive since I am strapped for cash,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.679 position:83%
I think that it would be a very rewarding experience.

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:15.148 position:72%
If I never have kids then I would want to know

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.317 position:84%
that I have given that opportunity to another couple.’

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.719
‘Which option did you choose?’

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:20.987
‘Identity release.'

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.390 position:63%
'And explain why you chose this option.'

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:28.495 position:98%
‘It may be interesting to meet my unknown child to see what effects

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:33.400 position:97%
environmental and genetic have played a role in his or her development.’

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:38.038 position:97%
‘If we could pass a message to the recipient of your semen, what would that message be?’

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.340 position:80%
‘Hold your head high and be considerate of others.'

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.841 position:69%
I mean he just seems like a really nice guy.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:44.611
so that’s why we chose him.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.646
We were imagining you

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:49.182
18 years from now meeting this guy

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.284
and we wanted you to like him

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:52.319
and, yeah

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.422 position:89%
think he was a good guy, so that was kind of our process.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.057
You glad we picked him?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.294
I mean yeah!

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:03.530
I love you.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.631
I love you, too.

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.036
You're so special.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:22.349 position:84%
Kathleen and I got together when we were 23 years old.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.152
So we were quite young at the time.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:29.889 position:84%
She was the kind of person that would walk in the room

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:30.991
and light it up.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.226
Oh my gosh mom, you’re so young.

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:36.096
Thank you? I think.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:39.766
Not that you’re old now, but like…

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:46.273
for the three months that she lived

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:47.540
after her diagnosis,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.677 position:61%
she did more living than most people do

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:52.445
in a decade - if not more.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.314 position:64%
Julia, this was when we were on vacation,

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:56.182
a week before your mummy died.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.886 position:59%
And she played the song she’d learned,

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:03.123 position:59%
she taught herself to play the ukulele

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:05.592 position:59%
in the last two months of her life and

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.661 position:58%
played the song for the whole family.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:41.661
Love you girls.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.997
You ok?

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:52.639 position:66%
Kathleen was very insistent on making sure

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.442 position:66%
that we used the sperm bank of California,

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:59.112 position:97%
because we were allowed to have a 'Known Donor Programme' from that.

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.047 position:61%
We didn’t have any rights to the donor,

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.383 position:69%
and he didn’t have any rights to us, either.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.318 position:78%
Julia was the only person that could make contact.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:10.457
Julia was born in 1999 in January,

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.059
and she was conceived

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.128 position:59%
five months before Google was founded.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.998
So there was no chance in our minds

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.266 position:92%
that any of the diblings would ever be part of the picture.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.736 position:98%
It wasn’t that we didn’t want them, it just never crossed our mind.

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:36.116
Oh honey pie, I love you so much.

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:37.050
I love you, too.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:37.984
Have a great trip

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.388 position:78%
and I want to hear all about it when you get home.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.503 position:64%
We are on the road to Syracuse, New York,

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.303
where I’m going to meet up

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.339
with three of my siblings,

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.107
George, Mari and Samantha.

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:04.110
And I’ve met George before,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.679
and I haven’t met Mari or Samantha.

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.156
What's up!

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.032
Hi.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.067
I'm Mari.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:33.106
Do you see what I mean?

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:34.140
I think they look so similar.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.241
The eyes.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:35.775
Yeah.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.610 position:64%
Yeah and the nose and the bone structure.

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:39.813
Already?

00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:40.580
And your nose.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:48.888
I have small hands.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:49.856
I have huge hands.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.127 position:56%
I have bigger hands than my brother.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.129
We have the exact same size hands.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.932
I never really wondered about

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.768 position:75%
the fact that I might have these half siblings -

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:02.435
diblings.

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:03.770 position:80%
I like more calling them like sisters and brothers,

00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:06.172 position:98%
because I’m trying to get more used to the fact that they are like my sisters and brothers.

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.810 position:64%
Now it’s really become a much bigger part

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.080 position:66%
of this whole sperm donor story to me than

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.083
the father aspect of it.

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:20.086 position:91%
It’s so grody that other people’s parents had to have sex.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.631
I was a double donor conception,

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.833 position:58%
which means that a donor egg and then

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.135
a donor sperm was used.

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.139
I felt very alien, I felt very like

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:41.741
in a hole,

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:46.412 position:92%
and 50 years ago I wouldn’t have been able to exist at all.

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:51.351 position:97%
I felt like I was kind of forced on to the earth a little bit.

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.186
It wasn’t natural at all.

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:55.054
There was a period that I was just

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:59.826 position:63%
I wished I hadn’t been born in this way,

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:00.994
really at all.

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.329
And I almost kind of blamed her,

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.999 position:72%
because I knew that she wanted a child so bad.

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.570 position:88%
People don’t report when the pregnancies are successful.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.773 position:98%
So the sperm banks don’t get a lot of information in return from the families

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:14.641
apparently there’s a problem with

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.544 position:69%
lack of regulation around that or something.

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:21.848 position:77%
I don’t know, should they have 20-something kids?

00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:24.250
Sperm donation is around to stay.

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:29.222 position:59%
So, for someday it might only be this.

00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:35.695 position:63%
We don’t know the future of any of that.

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:42.769 position:98%
I really want to get to know you better. I’m down to be like a brother.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:45.772 position:70%
I want you guys too. There’s a lot, you know?

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.007 position:56%
Welcome to the family kind of thing.

00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:50.176 position:69%
We’re not brothers and sisters in name only,

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.544 position:64%
I kind of want to make it more than that.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:54.047 position:72%
I think it’s definitely possible to have a few

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.316 position:61%
people, or a lot of people maybe, even,

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.484
if I'm good with time management,

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.321 position:70%
who I can have really deep relationships with

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:02.522 position:56%
who feel like my brother and sister.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.060 position:59%
I think it's important to do something

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.328 position:61%
every once in a while with these people

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.195
to grow these connections.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:10.363 position:75%
I don’t think it necessarily has to be something

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.065 position:69%
where you need to talk to them all the time,

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.400 position:86%
or even having one person that you talk to all the time

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.603 position:78%
because we’re not accustomed to that in our lives,

00:12:16.604 --> 00:12:20.974 position:59%
but I think that this can be a family.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.443
And I’m really excited about that.

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:33.653 position:66%
My half sister came up to me and gave me a

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:34.621
hug today,

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.691 position:83%
and I was the first blood relative she’s ever touched

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.293
and it’s a Thursday.

00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:41.527
Just a random Thursday.

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:44.163 position:67%
The whole experience is always shocking and

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:47.166 position:67%
bewildering, but in a really beautiful way.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.334
And really touching way.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.137
Hugging George, it was like,

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:54.907 position:67%
I don’t know, a strange sort of homecoming,

00:12:56.843 --> 00:13:01.214 position:98%
it was like someone I should’ve been hugging throughout my childhood but never did.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:05.251 position:77%
I wish I could’ve told younger me about this day.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.454 position:91%
I wish I could go back and tell her that you’ll find them.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.861 position:64%
You’ll find those people that understand.

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:16.796
It’ll definitely

00:13:17.497 --> 00:13:20.133 position:69%
keep me warm for a very long time, you know?

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:28.775 position:66%
We’re still figuring out how family works,

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:30.109
and how our family works.

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:39.385 position:70%
I don’t know where we are in that, but I like

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:42.388 position:61%
where it is. Wherever it is, I like it.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.904 position:72%
Really only about 3-5% of all potential donors

00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.907 position:86%
actually become donors. It’s kind of an exclusive club.

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:07.980
So these are the samples

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:11.050 position:64%
and they’re attached to canes, like this.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.286
And we just lay them here.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:17.323 position:97%
We limit the number of vials that we allow a donor to produce.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:20.526 position:64%
If we allow a donor to collect 500 vials,

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.597
If you do some calculations,

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.569 position:91%
that would be approximately between 10 and 15 pregnancies.

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:33.406 position:78%
It’s not what I expected, I expected it to be some

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:37.477
crazy, scientific,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.713
all these people with masks on,

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:43.850 position:94%
running everywhere, and kind of scary, but it’s very normal.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.551
If we go down the hallway this way

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.853
is our collection room.

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:52.892 position:98%
It’s basically just a sink, the chair, the proverbial stack of magazines.

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:57.096 position:69%
I don’t know if I want to imagine this part.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:10.276 position:98%
I’m at a restaurant in Cleveland, and I’m here to meet with Wendy Kramer,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.079 position:66%
the founder of the Donor Sibling Registry.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.415 position:88%
I’m excited to hear the other sides of the conversation.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.788
There are donors who email me

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:24.457 position:70%
and go 'wait a minute, my sperm bank promised

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:26.793
I would have no more than 10 kids

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:27.527
20 kids.

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:31.130 position:72%
I’m looking on your website and I see 67 kids.

00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:32.899
What the heck?!'

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.136
And this happens all the time.

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:39.272 position:63%
Sperm banks need to be held accountable.

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:46.012 position:97%
The reproductive medicine industry has worked really hard to stay unregulated.

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:47.914
In the UK, they say

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.950
donors can’t be paid,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.953
and a limit of ten kids.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.223 position:59%
But the problem is, all those laws are

00:15:57.223 --> 00:16:01.027 position:67%
meaningless when the majority of all people

00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:04.864 position:86%
that use donor sperm are importing from US sperm banks.

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:13.372 position:97%
What do you feel like you learn about yourself when you do this?

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:17.310 position:89%
I learn that I love all my siblings and they’re so smart.

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:25.852 position:86%
They just bring up so many thought-provoking questions.

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:28.087 position:67%
Where do you see that going with everybody?

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:32.024 position:73%
I feel so comfortable calling them all brothers

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:35.628 position:63%
and sisters but also we haven’t had that

00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:38.798 position:73%
connection for the first 18 years of our lives.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.567
So I really don’t know.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:45.137 position:78%
I don’t know, like, how much to connect with them,

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:49.909 position:84%
and how much I want out of their relationship with me.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.013 position:66%
And I feel like the best way to just do it

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.815
is to see what happens.

00:16:55.815 --> 00:17:00.319 position:77%
It’s such an interesting, deep connection that is

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:04.891
I mean, it’s love.

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.693 position:61%
I don’t think I would’ve expected that.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:13.566 position:56%
I don’t know that I saw that coming,

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:14.800
it’s really sweet.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.403 position:78%
I mean, I feel connected, so I can’t even imagine.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.606 position:73%
Well I do, I mean I see you connected, but it’s

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:23.309
amazing, it's really cool.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.143
Yeah.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.712 position:80%
It’s really cool. I’m glad you have it. It's great.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:27.780
Me too.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:31.183 position:66%
Well you're going to meet Darren tomorrow!

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:36.522
It’ll be great.

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:53.205
My mom is about to meet my dad

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.373
for the first time.

00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:02.848 position:91%
It’s about 11:20 and he’s going to be here in ten minutes.

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:10.590 position:98%
From when you were like 10 years old, nine years old, you called him Don.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.225 position:84%
Don was my nickname for him, because we didn’t know...

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.260
Right, we didn’t know who he was.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.563 position:70%
We didn’t have a name, so you called him Don.

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.599 position:61%
And I thought that was the cutest name.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:25.299
It's very cute.

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:22.735
Don the donor.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.272
I’m a bit anxious, I have to admit.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.206
But

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.576
I’m channeling your mummy,

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.578
to be grounded, and clear,

00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:37.750 position:69%
and thinking what she might want to ask him.

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:50.229
You’ve never met a parent before.

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.231 position:59%
Yeah you’re the first parent I’ve met.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.599
And you’re the first donor I’ve met

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.967
so that's fair.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.337 position:59%
First of all, I want to say thank you,

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:00.906
because I have this amazing kid.

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:03.242
She's amazing.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.245
She’s really been a joy to raise

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:10.516
and watch, and I really appreciate

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:15.154 position:97%
I mean, I don’t know if you consider it generosity but I think it's the biggest gift

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:18.391 position:97%
you could have ever given anyone, so I really appreciate that.

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:20.359
And what a great human you are.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.328
Thanks.

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.363
Thanks for picking me.

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:27.066
Thanks for giving me life.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:31.037 position:58%
I’m Darren, I’m 44, I’m from southern

00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:34.040 position:98%
California, and I work in computer science, software development.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.575 position:72%
Did you ever worry about the parents, I guess,

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:39.578 position:91%
like whether there was going to be a bad parent out there?

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:42.581
Did you feel responsible for that?

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:46.686 position:69%
When I first donated, I think I was about 19

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:51.524 position:80%
I remember thinking 'oh it’s so far in the future',

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:56.128 position:86%
I didn’t really think about consequences at that point.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:58.898 position:98%
When you’re that young, you’re literally just thinking about your midterm

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:01.434
and making ends meet.

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:06.672 position:98%
About once a year maybe I’d think, 'huh, I guess that’s about 13 years off,

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.107
wonder what will happen'. You know?

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:09.508
You just muse on it.

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:14.680 position:80%
I think, like many things in life, the anticipatory

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.716 position:75%
anxiety is much worse than the actual situation.

00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:20.753 position:59%
He was disarming. He was a gentle soul

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.987
that was easy to be with.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.023
Did you know how many

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:24.523
I had no idea.

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:25.191
children there were?

00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:25.725
I had no idea.

00:20:26.092 --> 00:20:29.095 position:98%
I don’t know how much information they gave you. Did you know there were any?

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.097
Well I knew there were some.

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.734 position:77%
I’m curious about how you think about these kids.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.736 position:98%
I don’t, obviously, have a strong connection to them, socially.

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.039
Family is such a broad term.

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:44.110
You pretty much have to qualify it.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.546 position:77%
My life is really full of taking care of my kids.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:54.120 position:98%
So I don’t really think about all of the donor offspring a whole lot.

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:56.055
Because I’m busy.

00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:00.092 position:78%
When I do think about it, yeah, it’s a little odd.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.828
Not bad-odd, just different.

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:04.163
If anything it’s good.

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.966
I mean, I helped give life.

00:21:08.968 --> 00:21:14.807 position:97%
I still feel a strange, sort of spiritual, cosmic connection to them

00:21:14.807 --> 00:21:18.777 position:73%
just in knowing that they share part of my DNA.

00:21:19.512 --> 00:21:22.281 position:72%
in that sense, I do feel a sort of connection,

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.784 position:56%
familial connection to the diblings.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.253 position:69%
From who I’ve met so far, and from what I’ve

00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:30.222 position:66%
heard about them, they are all very smart,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.358
talented,

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:34.793
friendly,

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:36.795
good-looking people.

00:21:39.098 --> 00:21:40.666 position:70%
I think Julia’s kind of blown away right now.

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:44.470 position:88%
It's like looking between you two talking to each other.

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:48.107
And you’re my biological mom

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:49.675
and you’re my biological dad.

00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:54.580 position:97%
I don't know why it's just very strange to hear you guys talk to each other.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.148
For the first time!

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:56.916
Yeah.

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.418
And I’m like sitting in the middle.

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.754
I keep just going like...

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:05.124 position:58%
like as you're talking to each other.

00:22:05.758 --> 00:22:07.526
In a very strange way,

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.997 position:81%
maybe it’s instinctual, I feel kind of proud of her.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:14.667 position:67%
I guess donor seems like the anonymous guy.

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:16.535
But he’s a real person now.

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.972 position:61%
There's got to be a better word for it.

00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:22.741 position:66%
Take care and I hope you feel better soon.

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:23.709
It's good to see you.

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:28.380
Wow.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:30.115
How was that for you?

00:22:41.594 --> 00:22:43.996
Before my mom died,

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:46.565
she left me this note.

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:49.969
I was at college my sophomore year

00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:52.238
in the middle of my midterms

00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:55.241
and I got a call from Betsy,

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:57.710 position:64%
she said: 'Julia, you have to come home.'

00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:02.381 position:91%
After my mom died, I found this note that she left for me.

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:06.118 position:77%
So I kind of just keep it there. It hasn't moved.

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:07.119
It makes me happy.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:12.057 position:91%
Every connection that I’ve made in the last two years even

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:16.662 position:58%
has shaped my idea of what family is.

00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:19.999
I have gained a lot of family,

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.468
and that was like

00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:26.872 position:88%
so much more than I would have ever thought it could be.

00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:31.343 position:98%
But I also never thought I could lose such a big part of my family.

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:39.752
And Kathleen’s not replaceable

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.053
at all.

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.358
but people help.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.063
I think I’m learning how to

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:54.433
live, still, and

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.304 position:64%
my family's definitely helping with that.

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:03.776
My very extended family.
