WELL AS DAVID HOLMES, WHO MAY

WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIS QUESTION 
OF BOTH MONEY AND INFLUENCE IN 

00:30:52.996 --> 00:30:56.033
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT. 
JOINING US FROM OUR WASHINGTON 

00:30:56.247 --> 00:30:58.247
POST STUDIO, AMBER PHILLIPS AND 

00:31:01.718 --> 00:31:04.369
ELISE VIEBECK. WE HAD TO LOOK 
FORWARD, OF COURSE, TO TODAY'S 

00:31:04.574 --> 00:31:07.619
TESTIMONY BUT I NEED TO START 
WITH YESTERDAY. I WANT YOU TO 

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.820
PUT IN CONTEXT FOR US JUST 

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:16.958
WHAT THE SONDLAND TESTIMONY 
MEANT WITH THIS INVESTIGATION?  

00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:19.809
&gt;&gt; IT WAS HUGE AND THAT IS WHY 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT RATHER

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:23.250
THAN WITNESSES IN ANOTHER DAY OF
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PUBLIC 

00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.465
HEARINGS RIGHT OFF 

00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:30.169
THE BAT, GORDON SONDLAND IS A 
TRUMP APPOINTEE, A TRUMP DONOR, 

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.622
A GUY WHO SAID HE WAS DOING 
TRUMP'S BIDDING IN UKRAINE, GETS

00:31:33.823 --> 00:31:38.092
UP TO THE WITNESS STAND AND 
OTHER UNDER OATH SAYS WAS THERE 

00:31:38.292 --> 00:31:44.250
A QUID PRO QUO? YES. I ALSO 
PERSONALLY PRESUME THERE WAS ONE

00:31:44.443 --> 00:31:48.647
FOR MILITARY AID AS WELL, I WENT
ABOUT DOING IT. IT WASN'T A 

00:31:48.848 --> 00:31:51.897
SECRET. AS YOU SAID LIBBY, HE 
BROUGHT WITH HIM EMAILS AND TEXT

00:31:52.101 --> 00:31:57.596
MESSAGES TO SAY VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE  KNEW OF THIS OR I TOLD 

00:31:57.788 --> 00:32:01.653
HIM MY CONCERNS ABOUT IT. 
SECRETARY STATE MIKE POMPEO, HE 

00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:05.104
IS A TON OF EMAILS WHERE MIKE 
POMPEO IS INCLUDED IN 

00:32:10.114 --> 00:32:12.824
THESE CONVERSATIONS. ENERGY 
SECRETARY RICK PERRY, FORMER 

00:32:13.026 --> 00:32:15.047
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN 
BOLTON, A BUNCH OF HIS STAFF ON 

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.294
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AT
THE TIME. SONDLAND WENT IN AND 

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.187
SAID  IF I'M GOING TO GO DOWN ON
THIS AND BRINGING EVERYONE DOWN 

00:32:21.378 --> 00:32:24.461
WITH ME. IT WAS HUGE. 

00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:29.684
&gt;&gt; ELISE, REPUBLICANS, OF COURSE
MANAGED TO PUSH BACK IT SEEMED 

00:32:29.886 --> 00:32:33.939
TO TAKE THEM A LITTLE WHILE TO 
GET SOME MOMENTUM YESTERDAY. IT 

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:36.152
ALMOST SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE 
CAUGHT A LITTLE FLAT-FOOTED BY 

00:32:36.172 --> 00:32:38.419
WHAT GORDON SONDLAND SAID. CAN 
YOU GIVE ADVICE, FROM YOUR 

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.721
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THIS WAS 
HANDLED BY THE REPUBLICANS? 

00:32:41.722 --> 00:32:43.722
&gt;&gt; IT DID 

00:32:45.322 --> 00:32:47.557
TAKE REPUBLICANS TO RALLY AROUND
A TALKING POINT AND I THINK WHAT

00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:49.757
THEY ULTIMATELY LANDED ON HIS 
DESK, GORDON SONDLAND SAID THAT 

00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:53.031
HE NEVER HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAY, SPECIFICALLY TO HIM THAT HE

00:32:53.245 --> 00:32:57.711
WAS TRYING TO DO A QUID PRO QUO 
WITH UKRAINE, THAT HE IS TRYING 

00:32:57.913 --> 00:33:02.995
TO BRIBE UKRAINE. I SAT IN FACT,
AS SOMEONE SAID TRUMP DENIED 

00:33:03.195 --> 00:33:06.447
THAT TO HIM. IT WAS INTERESTING 
FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO MAKE THIS

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:09.082
CASE THAT WHILE THERE MAY HAVE 
BEEN SOME KIND OF PRESSURE 

00:33:09.282 --> 00:33:12.772
CAMPAIGN OR QUID PRO QUO GOING 
ON, IT WASN'T TRUMP WHO PERHAPS 

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.960
WAS 

00:33:16.603 --> 00:33:18.603
BEHIND IT. THEY ARE SLOWLY, 
SLOWLY TRYING TO ISOLATE THE 

00:33:18.636 --> 00:33:22.563
PRESIDENT FROM WHAT THEY SEE AS 
A MALIGN INFLUENCE, HIS ADVISORS

00:33:22.755 --> 00:33:24.755
LIKE A RUDY GIULIANI, HIS 

00:33:27.571 --> 00:33:29.571
PERSONAL LAWYER. YOU CAN SEE AS 
REPUBLICANS REALIZE THE EVIDENCE

00:33:29.604 --> 00:33:31.638
IS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO 
THE PRESIDENT, THEY STEP UP 

00:33:32.238 --> 00:33:34.675
THEIR EFFORTS TO DEFEND HIM, TO 
VIEW THEM AS SEPARATE FROM ALL 

00:33:34.875 --> 00:33:38.341
OF THESE OTHER EFFORTS. THEY ARE
DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO INSULATE 

00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:42.394
HIM IN THAT WAY. 
&gt;&gt; OUR COLLEAGUE 

00:33:45.443 --> 00:33:48.078
RHONDA CALVIN WAS THERE, LET'S 
GO TO HER ON CAPITOL HILL. WHAT 

00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:51.944
WAS IT LIKE IN THE HEARING ROOM?
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT THE 

00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:54.145
TESTIMONY AHEAD OF TIME 

00:33:56.813 --> 00:33:58.845
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS EMBARGOED 
UNTIL 9:00 AND WE CANNOT SHARE 

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:01.080
IT. WITHOUT A SENSE OF WHAT 
HAPPENED BUT IT'S DIFFERENT TO 

00:34:01.294 --> 00:34:05.750
HEAR THE WORDS COME OUT OF THE 
WITNESSES MOUTH, WHAT WAS IT 

00:34:05.964 --> 00:34:07.808
LIKE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS TRUE AND THAT IS THE 

00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:11.238
DIFFERENCE, WE DID NOW, IT WAS 
REPORTED A FEW MINUTES BEFORE HE

00:34:11.439 --> 00:34:13.673
GAVE THE OPENING STATEMENT THAT 
HE WOULD BE VERY CLEAR ON THAT 

00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:15.875
THERE WAS QUID PRO QUO, BUT IT 

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.793
WAS NOTHING, WHEN HE SAID OUT 
LOUD IT WAS NOTHING THAT HAD 

00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:25.260
BEEN RECORDED BEFORE. HE REALLY 
MADE IT CLEAR, HE EMPHASIZED THE

00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:28.297
WORDS. IF YOU SAW THE CLIP A 
DEPOSIT BETWEEN WORDS TO BE 

00:34:28.511 --> 00:34:30.511
VERY, VERY CLEAR THAT YES, THERE
WAS QUID 

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:38.261
PRO QUO. IT IS AN ASTOUNDING 
MOMENT TO BE IN THERE, WATCHING 

00:34:38.462 --> 00:34:40.462
THIS AS IT HAPPENED. HIS 
STATEMENT WAS ABOUT 23 PAGES 

00:34:40.494 --> 00:34:43.745
LONG SO, HE HAD A LOT TO SAY BUT
IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT TOOK THE

00:34:43.945 --> 00:34:48.212
ROOM, WHERE EVERYONE, YOU KNOW, 
WAS ASTOUNDED BY WHAT HE SAID. 

00:34:48.412 --> 00:34:51.288
&gt;&gt; OKAY RHONDA. SO, THAT WAS 

00:34:54.712 --> 00:34:56.946
YESTERDAY. WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU
ARE WATCHING FOR TODAY, WHAT YOU

00:34:57.147 --> 00:35:00.197
BE LISTENING FOR AND GIVE US A 
PREVIEW, DO WE EXPECT TO BE HERE

00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:02.399
NEXT TIME AT THIS TIME 

00:35:06.228 --> 00:35:08.720
RHONDA COLVIN? 
&gt;&gt; I WILL DO THIS IN REVERSE, 

00:35:08.934 --> 00:35:11.217
NO, WE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
HERE UNLESS AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS 

00:35:11.406 --> 00:35:15.023
MADE. THEY ARE PLANNING A 
THANKSGIVING PARADE, BREAK, AS 

00:35:15.224 --> 00:35:17.058
PER USUAL, DURING HOUSE TYPICAL 
CHARACTER, SO WE AREN'T 

00:35:17.059 --> 00:35:19.894
EXPECTING ANYTHING NEXT WEEK TO 
HAPPEN IN PUBLIC BUT I WILL SAY 

00:35:20.096 --> 00:35:23.961
STAY TUNED. THEY ARE GOING TO BE
VERY BUSY WHEN THEY COME BACK. 

00:35:24.161 --> 00:35:26.161
AS 

00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:29.444
FOR TODAY, FIONA HILL WILL BE AN
INTERESTING WITNESS TO LISTEN 

00:35:29.645 --> 00:35:31.645
TO. ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS 

00:35:34.316 --> 00:35:36.963
BECAUSE SHE THE TORT JULY 26 
PHONE CALL BUT IS ABLE TO GIVE A

00:35:37.163 --> 00:35:39.163
LOT OF DETAILS WAS WHAT MAY HAVE
HAPPENED WITH QUID 

00:35:43.254 --> 00:35:45.319
PRO QUO IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS 
LEADING TO THE PHONE CALL AND 

00:35:45.509 --> 00:35:47.548
SHE'S ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT 
TIMELINE VERY EARLY ON IN THE 

00:35:47.738 --> 00:35:49.962
MONTH OF JULY BEFORE THE PHONE 
CALL HAPPENED. SHE ALSO NAMED A 

00:35:50.158 --> 00:35:52.392
LOT OF NAMES THAT WHEN SHE GAVE 
HER PERSONAL DEPOSITION THAT WE 

00:35:52.605 --> 00:35:57.074
HAVE NOT YET UNDERSTOOD INVOLVED
IN THESE EVENTS. ONE OF THEM WAS

00:35:58.495 --> 00:36:00.526
MICK MULVANEY. SHE TALKED ABOUT 
HOW HE PLAYED AN ESSENTIAL ROLE 

00:36:00.727 --> 00:36:05.197
IN POSSIBLY DESIGNATING SONDLAND
AND OTHERS TO HANDLE THE UKRAINE

00:36:08.851 --> 00:36:11.286
POLICY.  SHE TALKED A LOT ABOUT 
RUDY GIULIANI AND HOW SHE WAS 

00:36:11.486 --> 00:36:13.318
VERY CONCERNED HE WAS OPERATING 
A SHADOW FOREIGN-POLICY EFFORT 

00:36:13.319 --> 00:36:15.319
IN 

00:36:16.572 --> 00:36:21.313
UKRAINE UNDER A WAY THAT WAS NOT
A PART OF TYPICAL GOVERNMENT 

00:36:21.505 --> 00:36:23.878
PROTOCOL. SHE TALKED A LOT ABOUT
THAT AND SHE ALSO TALKED A LOT 

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:27.545
ABOUT SONDLAND AND HOW SHE WAS 
CONCERNED WITH HOW  INVOLVED HE 

00:36:27.746 --> 00:36:29.746
WAS AS EU AMBASSADOR. SHE ALSO 
TALKED ABOUT HOW 

00:36:33.228 --> 00:36:35.665
SHE HAD A CONFRONTATION WITH HIM
SAYING WHO PUT YOU IN CHARGE OF 

00:36:35.865 --> 00:36:39.720
THIS UKRAINE NEGOTIATION? AND HE
SAID THE PRESIDENT. THOSE THINGS

00:36:39.934 --> 00:36:42.371
WILL PROBABLY COME OUT TODAY, 
SHE MAY BE ABLE TO TIE ALL THESE

00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:45.206
THINGS TOGETHER AS ONE OF THE 
FINAL WITNESSES IN THIS PUBLIC 

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.872
PHASE. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:51.507
NEXT THURSDAY I HOPE YOU ARE 
WITH YOUR FAMILY AND I AM WITH 

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.815
MY FAMILY. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE 
THE HEARINGS TO GO INTO 

00:36:54.007 --> 00:36:56.007
THANKSGIVING WEEK ALTHOUGH THE 
COMMITTEE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE 

00:36:56.176 --> 00:37:00.244
SOME DECISIONS THAT IF THEY NEED
TO CALL MORE WITNESSES IN, THIS 

00:37:00.445 --> 00:37:02.445
IS THE 

00:37:05.658 --> 00:37:07.763
LAST DAY OF THIS PUBLIC INQUIRY 
PROCESS BEFORE THE HOUSE 

00:37:07.963 --> 00:37:09.963
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, THAT WE 
KNOW OF AT THIS POINT. THE 

00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:12.230
CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF DOES HAVE 
THE POWER TO ADD MORE TO THE 

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:17.302
ROSTER. WE WILL BE STAYING TUNED
TO SEE IF THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES

00:37:17.518 --> 00:37:20.554
THERE'S ANY MORE WITNESSES YET 
TO TESTIFY. THERE ARE A LOT OF 

00:37:20.754 --> 00:37:25.023
NAMES THAT COME TO COME UP, EVEN
YESTERDAY THAT ARE RAISING EVEN 

00:37:25.223 --> 00:37:30.305
MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE 
RESPONSIBILITY LIES FOR THIS 

00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:31.924
QUESTIONABLE DEAL AND 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH UKRAINE. WHAT 

00:37:31.925 --> 00:37:33.925
IS 

00:37:36.195 --> 00:37:38.428
YOUR SENSE OF THE VOICES THAT WE
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEY CAN 

00:37:38.628 --> 00:37:41.266
STILL BE REALLY CRUCIAL? 
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE VOICES WE HAVEN'T 

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.946
HEARD FROM THAT ARE CRUCIAL THAT
WE WILL NEVER HEAR FROM AND ONE 

00:37:46.147 --> 00:37:48.383
CATEGORY OF A PERSON WHO IS 
CRUCIAL THAT WE MIGHT HEAR FROM.

00:37:48.583 --> 00:37:50.824
I WILL START WITH THE FIRST, 
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE  AND 

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.020
SECRETARY OF STATE 

00:37:56.094 --> 00:37:57.742
MIKE POMPEO. TRUMP'S PERSONAL 
LAWYER, RUDY GIULIANI. DEMOCRATS

00:37:57.743 --> 00:38:00.776
WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THEM. 
GORDON SONDLAND ILLUSTRATED 

00:38:00.977 --> 00:38:03.615
YESTERDAY A CHAIN OF COMMAND 
THAT WENT TRUMP, THESE PEOPLE, 

00:38:06.664 --> 00:38:09.916
RUDY GIULIANI, AND HIM. HE WAS 
JUST CARRYING OUT THEIR ORDERS. 

00:38:10.117 --> 00:38:14.787
I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF, YOU KNOW,
RUDY GIULIANI OR ANY OF THESE 

00:38:14.988 --> 00:38:16.988
DEMONSTRATION OFFICIALS CAME 
FORWARD. THEY ALL ISSUED 

00:38:21.204 --> 00:38:23.110
STATEMENTS DENYING SONDLAND'S 
CHARACTERIZATION OF EVENT AND 

00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:24.944
PLAYING OF THE FACT THAT 
SONDLAND HAS NOT BEEN 

00:38:24.945 --> 00:38:26.977
FORTHCOMING  IN HIS PREVIOUS 
TESTIMONY. UNDERMINING HIM. 

00:38:27.177 --> 00:38:31.713
SONDLAND MENTIONED  THE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR AT THE TIME, 

00:38:33.062 --> 00:38:35.096
JOHN BOLTON. WE WILL HEAR FIONA 
HILL TALK TODAY ABOUT JOHN 

00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:37.544
BOLTON BECAUSE HE WAS HER BOSS 
AT THE TIME OF THESE CRUCIAL 

00:38:37.944 --> 00:38:39.944
MEETINGS THAT 

00:38:41.398 --> 00:38:43.219
RHONDA OUTLINED. HE HAS 
INDICATED THAT HE WOULD BE 

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.220
INTERESTED IN 

00:38:48.447 --> 00:38:51.555
TALKING TO. I'M READING BETWEEN 
THE LINES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE 

00:38:51.754 --> 00:38:53.992
WANTS TO. HOWEVER, THAT HE IS 
NOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE ANYMORE 

00:38:54.192 --> 00:38:56.630
HE SAID IS A WHITE HOUSE BAN ON 
COMPLYING WITH CONGRESS. I WILL 

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.276
LET THE COURTS DECIDE AND THAT 
COULD TAKE A WHILE. WE MAY NOT 

00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:01.510
HEAR FROM JOHN BOLTON ANYTIME 
SOON BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE ON A 

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.710
REALLY TIGHT TIMELINE TO GET 
THIS OUT BEFORE 

00:39:06.995 --> 00:39:09.227
2020 STARTS. I'M WATCHING TO SEE
IF HE CHANGES HIS MIND. SAYING 

00:39:09.428 --> 00:39:12.527
YOU KNOW GUYS, THIS IS TOO MUCH,
I WANT IN, MAKE ROOM FOR ME IN A

00:39:12.714 --> 00:39:17.953
PUBLIC HEARING. 
&gt;&gt; ELISE LET'S GO TO YOU AND 

00:39:18.169 --> 00:39:20.211
HEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
BE WATCHING TODAY FROM FIONA 

00:39:20.403 --> 00:39:22.491
HILL IN PARTICULAR. I'D ALSO 
LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT DAVID HOLMES 

00:39:22.682 --> 00:39:25.270
ABOUT FIONA HILL IS SOMEONE THAT
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE

00:39:25.469 --> 00:39:27.469
ONE TO WATCH 

00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:32.885
THIS MORNING. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT, IN FACT THIS 

00:39:33.049 --> 00:39:34.821
WHOLE WEEK WE KNEW GORDON 
SONDLAND'S TESTIMONY WAS LIKELY 

00:39:34.822 --> 00:39:36.844
GOING TO BE THE MOST DRAMATIC 
ABOUT PERSONALLY I HAVE BEEN 

00:39:37.058 --> 00:39:40.308
WAITING TO HEAR FROM FIONA HILL.
HERE IS WHY, SHE IS A VERY 

00:39:40.509 --> 00:39:42.509
STRONG AND CAPABLE LEADER IN THE
NATIONAL SECURITY WORLD. SHE 

00:39:42.543 --> 00:39:44.543
DOES NOT SUFFER 

00:39:47.953 --> 00:39:51.476
FULL SLIGHTLY. FOOLS LIGHTLY. WE
KNEW THIS FROM HER DEPOSITION, 

00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:53.731
SHE TENDS TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD, 
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE POSING 

00:39:53.923 --> 00:39:56.144
QUESTIONS TO HER. WE KNOW THAT 
ALL OF THESE LAWMAKERS ON THE 

00:39:56.344 --> 00:39:58.176
DAIS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN 
USING THEIR MOMENTS OF 

00:39:58.177 --> 00:40:02.031
QUESTIONING TO FRAME FOR TV, TO 
BE ABLE TO PULL THE VIDEO CLIPS 

00:40:02.247 --> 00:40:08.343
INTO FUTURE CAMPAIGN ADS, TO RUN
THEM ON FOX NEWS IF YOU'RE A 

00:40:08.537 --> 00:40:11.174
REPUBLICAN. THEIR GOAL, IN THOSE
MOMENTS, IS TO PULL THE WITNESS 

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:14.024
IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS AND HAVE 
THEM SAY CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

00:40:14.224 --> 00:40:17.275
SUPPORTIVE OF THE PARTIES 
NARRATIVE. I THINK WHAT WE WILL 

00:40:17.475 --> 00:40:20.927
SEE FROM FIONA HILL TODAY IS 
THAT SHE IS NOT WILLING TO BE 

00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:24.579
PULLED IN ANY DIRECTION. SHE 
WILL CONFRONT EITHER DEMOCRATS 

00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:27.195
OR REPUBLICANS TRYING TO GET HER
TO 

00:40:30.064 --> 00:40:32.297
SAY SOMETHING. NOT ONLY WILL SHE
REFUSED TO DO THAT, SHE WILL 

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.510
ACTUALLY CALL THEM OUT, 

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.010
I THINK, ON WHAT THEY ARE TRYING
TO DO. SHE IS LIKELY TO BE A 

00:40:39.211 --> 00:40:41.043
VERY DRAMATIC AND COMPELLING 
WITNESS FOR DEMOCRATS AS SHE, 

00:40:41.044 --> 00:40:43.479
AGAIN, AS A FRONT ROW SEAT AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE OR HAD ONE 

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.768
PORTION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL. THE OTHER THING, SHE 

00:40:47.957 --> 00:40:50.784
CAME OUT WITH HER OPENING 
STATEMENT JUST THIS MORNING AND 

00:40:50.984 --> 00:40:54.237
WE HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK 
AT THAT. WE CAN TELL, SHE TALKS 

00:40:54.444 --> 00:40:56.444
ABOUT 

00:40:59.453 --> 00:41:02.770
TWO TOPICS. ONE IS HER PERSONAL 
BACKGROUND SHE'S A NATIVE OF THE

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.970
UNITED KINGDOM WHO BECAME A 
NATURALIZED CITIZEN IN 2002. SHE

00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:08.258
TALKS ABOUT HER PAY PATRIOTISM 
AND COMMITMENT AS AN AMERICAN 

00:41:08.459 --> 00:41:12.528
AND SECOND AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
SHE IS ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S TOP

00:41:12.728 --> 00:41:14.965
EXPERTS ON RUSSIA AND THE FORMER
SOVIET BLOC. WHAT SHE DOES IN 

00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:19.028
HER OPENING STATEMENT IS SORT OF
PUT THE LIE TO THE IDEA THAT 

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.230
RUSSIANS DID 

00:41:22.682 --> 00:41:24.682
NOT INTERFERE IN THE 2016 
ELECTION. THIS IS BEEN A 

00:41:24.704 --> 00:41:26.737
REPUBLICAN TALKING POINT THE 
IDEA THAT PERHAPS IT WAS UKRAINE

00:41:26.938 --> 00:41:32.221
THAT DID THE INTERFERENCE. SHE 
SAYS VERY SPECIFICALLY AND 

00:41:32.422 --> 00:41:35.071
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THAT IS A LIE
THAT HAS BEEN PERPETUATED BY 

00:41:39.137 --> 00:41:40.955
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE. SHE IS 
BASICALLY GOING TO BE ACCUSING 

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:43.832
THE GOP LAWMAKERS OF FORWARDING 
AN ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN PUT 

00:41:44.019 --> 00:41:46.019
OUT 

00:41:48.886 --> 00:41:51.120
THERE TO ADVANTAGE RUSSIA. AS 
YOU CAN SEE, I THINK IT'S GOING 

00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:53.321
TO BE QUITE DRAMATIC 

00:41:54.974 --> 00:41:56.605
THIS MORNING. 
&gt;&gt; YOU TO IMAGINE THAT JOHN 

00:41:56.606 --> 00:41:58.606
BOLTON WILL BE WATCHING THIS 
TESTIMONY CLOSELY AS WELL. CAN 

00:41:58.627 --> 00:42:00.627
YOU WEIGH IN ON THE QUESTION OF 
BOLTON 

00:42:03.095 --> 00:42:05.400
TESTIMONY AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T
COME THIS WEEK, COULD COME AT 

00:42:05.597 --> 00:42:08.177
SOME LATER POINT IN THE PROCESS?
AND HOW IMPORTANT WOULD THAT BE?

00:42:08.377 --> 00:42:13.050
&gt;&gt; HIS VOICE WOULD BE EXTRA 
NARROWLY IMPORTANT. HE HAD A 

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.486
CLOSER INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS DOING AND 

00:42:15.768 --> 00:42:19.151
THINKING. AGAIN, AS WE TALK TO 
MORE AND MORE WITNESSES AND GET 

00:42:19.352 --> 00:42:21.788
CLOSER TO THE PRESIDENT WHICH IS
WHAT DEMOCRATS WANT AND 

00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:24.624
REPUBLICANS SEPARATE 
SPECIFICALLY DON'T WANT. JOHN 

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.497
BOLTON IS WAITING FOR A COURT TO
FIGURE OUT WHETHER HE'S ALLOWED 

00:42:29.096 --> 00:42:33.767
TO TESTIFY. IT IS POSSIBLE HE 
CAN MAKE IT DIFFERENT DECISION. 

00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:37.490
IF HE WANTS TO, HE CERTAINLY 
CAN. BUT I THINK THE TIMELINE IS

00:42:37.685 --> 00:42:39.685
REALLY IMPORTANT TO REVIEW HERE.

00:42:44.254 --> 00:42:46.773
DEMOCRATS WON TO WRAP THIS UP AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO 

00:42:46.973 --> 00:42:48.973
MOVE THE PROCEEDING TO THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THEN TO 

00:42:49.005 --> 00:42:51.038
THE SENATE FOR A TRIAL BEFORE 
THE 2020 ELECTION AND PRIMARY 

00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:53.239
SEASON GETS UNDERWAY. WE 

00:42:57.267 --> 00:42:59.666
KNOW SENATORS WILL HAVE TO BE 
STUCK IN WASHINGTON AT THE TRIAL

00:42:59.855 --> 00:43:02.002
COMES TO PASS AND MANY OF THE 
CENTERS ARE RUNNING FOR THE 

00:43:02.216 --> 00:43:04.037
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL 
NOMINATION AND WANT TO BE OUT ON

00:43:04.038 --> 00:43:08.926
THE TRAIL. THERE IS A TIMELINE. 
I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH BOLTON 

00:43:09.123 --> 00:43:11.560
POTENTIALLY TESTIFYING LATER IS 
THAT DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO SLOW

00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:13.761
DOWN THE PROCESS, WHICH THEY DO 
NOT WANT 

00:43:16.433 --> 00:43:18.891
TO DO. AT THIS MOMENT, THIS IS 
THE LAST PUBLIC HEARING WE HAVE 

00:43:19.091 --> 00:43:21.713
ON THE SCHEDULE. IT'S POSSIBLE 
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

00:43:21.914 --> 00:43:24.764
WILL ANNOUNCE MORE BUT, AS OF 
NOW, THEY HAVE FIONA HILL AND 

00:43:26.997 --> 00:43:31.453
DAVID HOLMES AS THEIR CLOSERS. I
THINK THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN

00:43:31.668 --> 00:43:33.288
ADVANTAGE, FROM THE DEMOCRATS 
PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAVING SOMEONE 

00:43:33.289 --> 00:43:36.939
LIKE JOHN BOLTON COME TESTIFY. 
WE SAW MANY EDITORIALS AND MAJOR

00:43:37.154 --> 00:43:39.173
NEWSPAPERS SAYING THE DEMOCRATS 
REALLY SHOULD SLOW THIS DOWN. 

00:43:39.375 --> 00:43:42.628
THE GORDON SONDLAND'S TESTIMONY 
BROUGHT UP TOO MANY NEW 

00:43:44.463 --> 00:43:46.280
POTENTIAL PLAYERS, TOO MANY NEW 
POTENTIAL FACTORS FOR THE 

00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:51.568
DEMOCRATS TO STOP NOW. I THINK 
MAYBE YOU AND ME BOTH LIKE 

00:43:51.769 --> 00:43:54.418
THANKSGIVING WEEK, SO MAYBE THE 
WEEK AFTER THANKSGIVING WILL 

00:43:54.618 --> 00:43:56.850
COME BACK IN HERE FOR MORE 
PEOPLE LIKE JOHN BOLTON? 

00:43:56.851 --> 00:44:02.335
&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS ARE AWARE OF LIKE 
COMPETING INTERESTS, INCLUDING 

00:44:02.536 --> 00:44:06.602
WHAT IT MEANS TO THE 2020 RACE. 
AND JUST FOR CONTROL GOES NEXT. 

00:44:06.803 --> 00:44:08.803
YOU 

00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:12.489
MENTIONED THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE WILL PICK THINGS UP 

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.923
BUT WE ARE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WOULD

00:44:15.137 --> 00:44:17.157
COME OUT WITH, WHAT SORT OF 
REPORT THEY WOULD GENERATE. WE 

00:44:17.373 --> 00:44:20.005
ARE STARTING TO GET A SENSE OF 
WHAT ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT THE

00:44:20.206 --> 00:44:25.294
DEMOCRATS WOULD DRAFT AND WHAT 
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE. BUT GORDON 

00:44:25.494 --> 00:44:30.977
SONDLAND DID START A LOT OR STIR
A LOT OF THREADS. WHAT QUESTIONS

00:44:31.178 --> 00:44:35.646
DID HE RAISE FOR YOU ABOUT OTHER
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND, 

00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:39.299
HOW CAN THE DEMOCRATS EVEN PULL 
AT THOSE THREADS WITHOUT TAKING 

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.500
UP A LOT 

00:44:42.968 --> 00:44:47.019
MORE TIME? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID THEY HEAR FROM THE 

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.220
PRESIDENT? THIS IS STILL THE 
CRUX OF THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:51.869
BECAUSE SOMEONE 

00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:56.570
SONDLAND,  HIMSELF, HE SAID WHAT
YOU WANT FROM UKRAINE AND HE 

00:44:56.772 --> 00:44:59.205
SAID I PROBABLY USE A FOUR 
LETTER WORD IN THE QUESTION. THE

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.420
PRESIDENT TONIGHT, I DON'T 

00:45:05.022 --> 00:45:09.972
WANT A QUID PRO QUO, I DON'T 
WANT A ANDRIY YERMAK, THAT 

00:45:10.173 --> 00:45:12.822
DOESN'T MEAN A LOT. IT DID NOT 
MEET A LOT TO SONDLAND. HE SAID 

00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:15.538
I WAS BEING TOLD BY RUDY 
GIULIANI  AND LOOPED IN AND BY 

00:45:15.736 --> 00:45:19.724
SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO TO PURSUE 
THIS QUID PRO QUO  INVESTIGATION

00:45:19.925 --> 00:45:23.376
FOR A MEETING WITH TRUMP AND 
LATER PRESUMED FOR MILITARY AID.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:29.883
SO, I'M TRYING TO SUMMARIZE IT 
HERE. SONDLAND SAYS  HE HEARD 

00:45:30.081 --> 00:45:32.317
THIS DIRECTLY FROM RUDY GIULIANI
AND THE ONE TIME HE ASKED TRUMP 

00:45:32.518 --> 00:45:34.518
TRUMP DENIED IT. WHAT DO THESE 
OTHER ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, 

00:45:34.553 --> 00:45:39.838
WHAT DO THEY HEAR FROM TRUMP 
BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE THE FRIEND,

00:45:40.038 --> 00:45:42.038
I STILL 

00:45:44.106 --> 00:45:46.106
SEE REPUBLICANS HANGING ONTO. 
YOU DO NOT HEAR DIRECTLY FROM 

00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:48.360
TRUMP SO HE IS INNOCENT. TO THE 
EXTENT THAT DEMOCRATS CAN HAVE 

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:53.244
SOMEONE WHO HEARD TRUMP'S VOICE 
EXPLICITLY SAY GET ME THOSE 

00:45:53.442 --> 00:45:55.477
INVESTIGATIONS, THEY FEEL THAT 
WOULD BE CASE CLOSED. I AM 

00:45:57.097 --> 00:46:00.559
WATCHING FOR A HINT OF THAT 
TODAY. WERE GOING TO HAVE 

00:46:00.761 --> 00:46:04.212
SOMEONE TESTIFY, DAVID HOLMES, 
U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN 

00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:07.913
UKRAINE, WHO IS ONE OF THE ONLY 
WITNESSES WHO HEARD TRUMP'S 

00:46:08.107 --> 00:46:11.522
VOICE ASKED FOR INVESTIGATIONS. 
HE WASN'T IN THE ROOM, HE WAS 

00:46:11.722 --> 00:46:15.790
OVERHEARING A PHONE CALL GORDON 
SONDLAND MADE TO THE PRESIDENT 

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.256
AT A RESTAURANT. HE SAID TRUMP 
TALKS REALLY LOUDLY SO SONDLAND 

00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:22.861
PULLED  THE PHONE AWAY FROM 

00:46:25.988 --> 00:46:28.997
HIS AIR EAR AND DAVID HOLMES 
SITTING ACROSS FROM TO HIM SAID 

00:46:29.198 --> 00:46:31.832
HER THE PRESIDENT SAY, SO HE'S 
GOING TO DO IT? YES HE IS GOING 

00:46:32.032 --> 00:46:34.032
TO DO IT SONDLAND REPLIED.  
&gt;&gt; AMBER, 

00:46:38.877 --> 00:46:41.583
GORDON SONDLAND SEEM TO HAVE 
SOME MEMORY PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT 

00:46:41.785 --> 00:46:43.618
THIS PROCESS. FIRST AMENDING HIS
CLOSED-DOOR STATEMENT BUT THEN 

00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:45.619
YESTERDAY, HE SAID LIKE IF I 
HAVE 

00:46:49.834 --> 00:46:53.573
THE NOTES I BE ABLE TO REMEMBER 
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BUT I HAVE

00:46:53.775 --> 00:46:56.413
A LOT OF PHONE CALLS AND HE WAS 
A LITTLE BIT CASUAL AND RELAXED 

00:46:56.612 --> 00:46:58.848
AND TRYING TO RECALL THINGS. SO,
DOES THAT MAKE THE DAVID HOLMES 

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.913
TESTIMONY ALL THE MORE 
IMPORTANT? AS SOMEONE WHO IS 

00:47:00.914 --> 00:47:06.980
MORE OF A BACKGROUND IN THE 
RIGORS OF STATE DEPARTMENT AND 

00:47:07.183 --> 00:47:09.183
DIPLOMATIC WAY OF TAKING NOTES? 

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:14.688
DOCUMENTING THINGS? THERE'S A 
REAL PROTOCOL THAT TAKES PLACE, 

00:47:14.689 --> 00:47:17.938
DOES THAT MAKE THEM ALL THE MORE
RELEVANT? 

00:47:17.939 --> 00:47:19.939
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. SONDLAND IS THE 
ONLY WITNESS WHO HAS COME 

00:47:19.974 --> 00:47:21.974
FORWARD  

00:47:24.988 --> 00:47:27.895
AND DIDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK 
BEFORE HE WENT BEFORE THE 

00:47:28.096 --> 00:47:30.328
COMMITTEE. HE TRIED TO BLAME IT 
ON THE STATE PERMIT AND WHITE 

00:47:30.544 --> 00:47:32.775
HOUSE SAYING THEY WOULDN'T LET 
ME ACCESS MY OWN EMAILS. TO SOME

00:47:32.977 --> 00:47:34.977
EXTENT, THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE. 
BUT TO ANOTHER ACCENT SONDLAND 

00:47:35.011 --> 00:47:37.011
SEEMED 

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.250
CAVALIER  ABOUT THE WHOLE 
PROCESS CLAIMING HE'S HERE TO 

00:47:40.285 --> 00:47:42.119
TESTIFY BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS 
THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. 

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.955
TODAY, DEMOCRATS HAVE TWO PEOPLE
WHO WERE WITH SONDLAND AT KEY 

00:47:45.169 --> 00:47:51.455
MOMENTS  IN JULY. FIONA HILL 
HEARD SONDLAND TELL UKRAINIANS  

00:47:51.657 --> 00:47:53.657
AT A WHITE HOUSE MEETING ON 

00:47:57.558 --> 00:47:59.558
JULY 10th, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATIONS. SHE SAYS SHE 

00:47:59.647 --> 00:48:03.247
CONFRONTED SONDLAND,  AS WELL AS
HER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 

00:48:03.849 --> 00:48:05.849
ALEXANDER REDMAN WHO 

00:48:09.249 --> 00:48:12.986
SAID IT VINDMAN WHO SAID IT IT 
WAS INAPPROPRIATE, WERE YOU 

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.434
DOING, THAT'S NOT A PART OF U.S.
POLICY TOWARDS UKRAINE, AND THE 

00:48:15.635 --> 00:48:17.635
DAVID HOLMES AS WELL HEARD HIM 
TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE 

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.670
PRESIDENT ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS. 
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO CAN TIE 

00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:22.337
TOGETHER SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS 
THAT SONDLAND LEFT OPEN DURING 

00:48:22.538 --> 00:48:29.041
HIS TESTIMONY WHICH IS  WHAT DID
THE PRESIDENT WANT? AND WHY DID 

00:48:29.242 --> 00:48:34.111
SONDLAND FEEL  THAT IS WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED, DESPITE 

00:48:34.325 --> 00:48:36.960
HEARING A DENIAL FROM THE 
PRESIDENT. 

00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:38.961
&gt;&gt; WE WILL HEAR 

00:48:41.027 --> 00:48:43.027
IT AND GORDON SONDLAND'S OWN 
WORDS, THIS IS HIS OPENING 

00:48:43.059 --> 00:48:45.095
STATEMENT FROM YESTERDAY. 
&gt;&gt; AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS 

00:48:48.741 --> 00:48:50.572
COMMITTEE FREQUENTLY FRAME THESE
COMPLICATED ISSUES IN THE FORM 

00:48:50.573 --> 00:48:55.245
OF A SIMPLE QUESTION. WAS THERE 
A QUID PRO QUO?  AS I TESTIFIED 

00:48:55.445 --> 00:49:00.931
PREVIOUSLY, WITH REGARD TO THE 
REQUESTED WHITE HOUSE CALL AND 

00:49:01.132 --> 00:49:05.399
WHITE HOUSE MEETING, THE ANSWER 
IS YES. MR. GIULIANI CONVEYED TO

00:49:07.434 --> 00:49:10.472
SECRETARY PERRY, AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER, AND OTHERS,  THAT 

00:49:10.673 --> 00:49:14.136
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT 

00:49:14.337 --> 00:49:17.787
ZELENSKY COMMITTING TO 
INVESTIGATIONS OF BURISMA AND 

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:23.940
THE 2016 ELECTION.  MR. GIULIANI
EXPRESSED THIS REQUEST DIRECTLY 

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:26.726
TO THE UKRAINIANS OF MR. 
GIULIANI ALSO EXPRESSED THOSE 

00:49:26.928 --> 00:49:31.196
REQUESTS DIRECTLY TO US. WE ALL 
UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE 

00:49:31.396 --> 00:49:35.864
PREREQUISITES FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE CALL, AND THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:49:36.064 --> 00:49:38.914
MEETING, REFLECTED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S DESIRES AND 

00:49:39.114 --> 00:49:43.380
REQUIREMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; SO, ELISE, THIS QUESTION OF A

00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:46.429
WHITE HOUSE MEETING VERSUS THE 
QUESTION OF UKRAINIAN MILITARY 

00:49:46.628 --> 00:49:50.696
AID, CAN YOU BREAK DOWN FOR US 
WHY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 

00:49:50.896 --> 00:49:55.162
ARE TALKING ABOUT THOSE TWO 
ITEMS? REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO

00:49:55.364 --> 00:50:02.468
TEASE THE TWO APART. ELISE? 
&gt;&gt; FOR VIEWERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN

00:50:02.682 --> 00:50:04.775
WATCHING THIS QUITE AS CLOSELY 
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN 

00:50:04.964 --> 00:50:08.569
WE SAY MILITARY AID IS 
ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE PENTAGON 

00:50:08.769 --> 00:50:10.769
AND STATE DEPARTMENT TO SUPPORT 
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA 

00:50:10.803 --> 00:50:13.854
IN UKRAINE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE
WHITE HOUSE MEETING, THAT WAS 

00:50:14.054 --> 00:50:18.745
SOMETHING THE NEW PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE WANTED IN ORDER TO PUT 

00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:22.794
TRADE TO THE WORLD THAT THE U.S.
IS AN ALLY OF UKRAINE, AND OF 

00:50:22.995 --> 00:50:27.309
THE NEW GOVERNMENT. A PHOTO OP 
WITH TRUMP WOULD BE NOTHING BUT 

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.314
GOOD FOR ZELENSKY.  THESE ARE 
TWO THINGS THE UKRAINIANS WERE 

00:50:31.514 --> 00:50:34.981
PURSUING AND, IN FACT, OUR 
CONGRESS HAD ALREADY 

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:40.462
APPROPRIATED MILITARY AID FOR 
UKRAINE THAT WAS THEN HELD UP. 

00:50:40.662 --> 00:50:42.695
AT THIS POINT, I THINK THE 
WITNESSES ARE REALLY GIVING US 

00:50:43.096 --> 00:50:47.451
NEW INSIGHT TO HOW THESE TWO 
PARTICULAR ELEMENTS, THESE 

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.851
ELEMENTS OF VALUE, WHICH IS HOW 
ADAM SCHIFF WOULD CALL THEM, 

00:50:53.053 --> 00:50:56.302
WERE JINGLED FOR THE UKRAINIANS 
WHEN THERE WAS THIS PRESSURE 

00:50:56.503 --> 00:50:59.554
CAMPAIGN GOING ON TO ENCOURAGE 
ZELENSKY TO LAUNCH 

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:03.620
INVESTIGATIONS  OF THE BIDENS , 
AND OF THIS 

00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:09.273
CONSPIRACY THEORY OF 
INTERFERENCE BY UKRAINE IN THE 

00:51:13.656 --> 00:51:16.411
26 ELECTION. 2016 ELECTION. WHAT
WE WILL HEAR MORE TODAY FROM 

00:51:16.612 --> 00:51:18.274
DAVID HOLMES, IT WAS ABOUT THESE
INVESTIGATIONS, SPECIFICALLY 

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:20.278
BECAUSE HE OVERHEARD THAT CALL 
IN THE RESTAURANT FROM GORDON 

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.880
SONDLAND TO PRESIDENT 

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.150
TRUMP.  WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
AGAIN, INQUIRED ABOUT THE STATUS

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:31.036
OF INVESTIGATIONS.  THIS WAS ONE
DAY AFTER THE CALL WITH ZELENSKY

00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:33.673
, WHERE HE PLACED PRESSURE ON 
HIM TO LAUNCH THEM INTO THE 

00:51:34.488 --> 00:51:39.419
BIDENS.  
&gt;&gt; AMBER, WE NOT ONLY HAVE NOT 

00:51:39.608 --> 00:51:42.408
TALKED ABOUT WHO TESTIFIED 
YESTERDAY. LAURA COOPER WHO 

00:51:42.622 --> 00:51:47.294
WORKS AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT,
DAVID HALE WHO COMES FROM THE 

00:51:47.494 --> 00:51:49.186
STATE DEPARTMENT. WHY WAS THE 
TESTIMONY SIGNIFICANT? 

00:51:49.187 --> 00:51:51.967
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN PLAY OFF WHAT DAVID 
HOLMES WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE 

00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:55.216
JULY 26 MEETING. THEY WERE 
SANDWICHED BETWEEN GORDON 

00:51:55.417 --> 00:51:58.454
SONDLAND AND THE DEBATE. I GOT 
TO LISTEN TO THEM. LAURA COOPER 

00:51:58.669 --> 00:52:00.669
IS 

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.554
A TOP PENTAGON OFFICIAL WHOSE 
JOB IS TO THINK ABOUT LONG-TERM 

00:52:04.756 --> 00:52:06.756
STRATEGY 

00:52:07.806 --> 00:52:09.806
TOWARD RUSSIA. AND, WHOSE OFFICE
WAS WORKING ON APPROVING THE 

00:52:10.646 --> 00:52:14.732
UKRAINE AID THAT CONGRESS HAD 
APPROPRIATED. THEIR JOB WAS TO 

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.547
SAY THAT UKRAINE NEEDS ALL THESE
CONDITIONS. WE DON'T THINK THEY 

00:52:17.759 --> 00:52:21.614
WILL SPEND IN A CORRUPT WAY. WE 
SHOULD GIVE OUR TAXPAYER MONEY 

00:52:21.815 --> 00:52:23.815
TO THEM, THAT IS FINE. IT GOT 
HELD UP 

00:52:28.462 --> 00:52:30.954
IN MAY. EXCUSE ME, IT WAS 
APPROPRIATED IN MAY, GOT HELD UP

00:52:31.167 --> 00:52:33.200
SOMETIME BETWEEN THEM. THE 
TIMELINE IS FUZZY ON WHEN THAT 

00:52:33.401 --> 00:52:36.038
HAPPENED. SHE WASN'T CLEAR WHY 
IT GOT HELD UP, SHE STRENUOUSLY 

00:52:36.238 --> 00:52:40.715
ADVOCATED FOR IT TO GET UNFROZEN
AND THEN BROKE SOME NEWS 

00:52:45.706 --> 00:52:48.426
BY SAYING UKRAINIANS ALERTED MY 
STAFF ON JULY 25th, WHAT IS UP 

00:52:48.627 --> 00:52:51.477
WITH THE MILITARY AID? WE ARE 
NOT EXACTLY SURE THAT THEY LIKE 

00:52:51.677 --> 00:52:56.549
KNEW THEY WEREN'T GETTING THEIR 
MILITARY AID AT THIS POINT BUT, 

00:52:56.763 --> 00:53:00.012
COOPER TESTIFIED THAT IT SEEMED 
LIKELY THAT THEY KNEW IT WAS 

00:53:00.289 --> 00:53:02.289
FROZEN. JULY 25th MATTERS 
BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME DAY THAT 

00:53:02.448 --> 00:53:04.470
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY GOT ON THE 
PHONE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,  AND

00:53:04.683 --> 00:53:08.739
TRUMP SAID I NEED A FAVOR FROM 
YOU. AND TALKED ABOUT 

00:53:08.939 --> 00:53:12.225
INVESTIGATING DEMOCRATS AND THE 
BIDENS.  THE INTERPRETATION I 

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:14.828
GET FROM THAT IS THAT IT IS VERY
LIKELY THE UKRAINIANS RECOGNIZED

00:53:15.043 --> 00:53:20.725
THERE IT WAS FROZEN, REACH OUT 
TO THE PENTAGON TO UNDERSTAND 

00:53:20.927 --> 00:53:22.961
WHY. AND THEN THE PRESIDENT 
HOPPED ON A PHONE CALL WITH 

00:53:23.189 --> 00:53:27.026
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WOULD GO A 
LONG WAY TO UNDERMINING 

00:53:27.236 --> 00:53:29.462
REPUBLICANS ARGUMENT THAT THERE 
WAS NO QUID PRO QUO  EXPLICIT IN

00:53:29.662 --> 00:53:33.314
THAT PHONE CALL. YOU HAVE 
ZELENSKY  BEING ASKED A FAVOR BY

00:53:33.528 --> 00:53:38.195
THE PRESIDENT, KNOWING $400 
MILLION OF AID THAT HE BADLY 

00:53:38.397 --> 00:53:42.049
NEEDED TO COUNTER RUSSIAN 
SEPARATISTS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY 

00:53:42.249 --> 00:53:49.569
WAS IN THE BALANCE. LAST NIGHT'S
TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS JULY 25th 

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.418
DATE I THINK WILL FLOW INTO 
TODAY'S TESTIMONY ABOUT A JULY 

00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:58.718
26 PHONE CALL THAT SONDLAND HAD 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP  AND TRUMP 

00:53:58.917 --> 00:54:03.432
SAID, I LOOK BACK AT MY NOTES HE
EXPLICITLY SAID "SO THEY ARE 

00:54:03.621 --> 00:54:05.621
GOING TO DO THE INVESTIGATION?" 
HE ASKED ABOUT 

00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.289
INVESTIGATION. 
&gt;&gt; THAT TAPE YOU ARE TALKING 

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.322
ABOUT FROM LAURA COOPER, LISTEN 
TO THIS. 

00:54:12.323 --> 00:54:17.597
&gt;&gt; AS EARLY AS JULY 25th, OF THE
SAME DAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE 

00:54:17.797 --> 00:54:21.864
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY ON THE 
PHONE  AND ASKED FOR THIS FAVOR,

00:54:22.065 --> 00:54:24.721
THE SAME DAY THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  

00:54:28.977 --> 00:54:30.977
THANK THANKED THE UNITED STATES 
FOR ITS MILITARY SUPPORT, AND 

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.248
SIGNAL IT WAS READY TO PURCHASE 
MORE JAVELINS. ON THAT DATE, YOU

00:54:34.665 --> 00:54:37.716
GOT INQUIRIES OR YOUR STAFF GOT 
INQUIRIES FROM SOMEONE AT THE 

00:54:40.953 --> 00:54:42.784
UKRAINIAN EMBASSY WHO WAS 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATUS OF 

00:54:42.785 --> 00:54:44.785
THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE, IS THAT

00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:49.101
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT, I WOULD SAY 

00:54:49.102 --> 00:54:50.708
SPECIFICALLY THE UKRAINIAN 
EMBASSY STAFF ASKED WHAT IS 

00:54:50.709 --> 00:54:54.235
GOING ON WITH UKRAINIAN SECURITY
ASSISTANCE? 

00:54:54.236 --> 00:54:56.236
&gt;&gt; 

00:54:58.633 --> 00:55:00.864
DID THAT NOTE TO YOU THAT 
SOMETHING WAS IN FACT GOING ON 

00:55:01.065 --> 00:55:04.384
WITH IT? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:07.361
&gt;&gt; AMBER THAT IS THE TESTIMONY. 
THIS TIMELINE THAT YOU ARE 

00:55:07.976 --> 00:55:12.043
TALKING ABOUT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR CONGRESS TO GET THEIR MINDS 

00:55:12.244 --> 00:55:14.552
AROUND AND ALSO IMPORTANT FOR 
JOURNALISTS TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.744
AND PUT THE PUZZLE 

00:55:18.531 --> 00:55:20.565
PIECES TOGETHER. I'M CURIOUS TO 
HEAR WHAT YOU THINK, AMBER, HOW 

00:55:20.766 --> 00:55:23.414
DOES THE AMERICAN PUBLIC MAKE 
SENSE OF ALL OF THIS? AS THEY 

00:55:23.615 --> 00:55:26.049
READ THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING 
ABOUT YESTERDAY'S TESTIMONY, AS 

00:55:26.262 --> 00:55:29.512
THEY WATCH AND TUNE IN TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS THIS MORNING, I 

00:55:32.566 --> 00:55:35.814
ONE POINT WHAT POINT DOES THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC AND SORT OF 

00:55:36.003 --> 00:55:38.653
RELATE WAY IN AND THAT THE 
REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS 

00:55:38.853 --> 00:55:41.289
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE FALLING ON 
THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THE 

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:43.490
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
SHOULD 

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:48.576
BE IMPEACHED? AND WHAT ARE THE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT SHOULD 

00:55:48.596 --> 00:55:50.428
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE BRIBERY, OR 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE? 

00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:55.299
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS A GREAT 
QUESTION, ARGUABLY THE MOST 

00:55:55.512 --> 00:55:57.512
IMPORTANT. WE STARTED THESE 
PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH THE 

00:55:57.949 --> 00:55:59.165
AMERICAN PEOPLE LARGELY 
SUPPORTING THE IMPEACHMENT 

00:55:59.166 --> 00:56:01.803
INQUIRY, A MAJORITY, IN THE 

00:56:05.456 --> 00:56:07.456
50% RANGE. BUT WHEN YOU ASKED 
SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP BE 

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:09.536
IMPEACHED AND REMOVED 

00:56:10.942 --> 00:56:13.174
FROM OFFICE? IT WAS SPLIT RIGHT 
DOWN THE MIDDLE ACCORDING TO A 

00:56:13.375 --> 00:56:15.375
WASHINGTON POST/ABC NEWS POLL. 
49 

00:56:17.245 --> 00:56:19.478
YES, 49 NO. WHAT CHANGES AFTER 
TWO WEEKS OF A STEADY, STEADY 

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:23.544
DRUMBEAT OF I THOUGHT WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ACCUSED OF 

00:56:23.745 --> 00:56:26.780
DOING WAS WRONG AND THE PEOPLE 
LIKE ORDERED SOMEONE SAYING I 

00:56:26.996 --> 00:56:32.069
THOUGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD ME 
TO DO IT? I SENSE THAT THERE IS 

00:56:32.269 --> 00:56:34.269
LIKELY 

00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:38.017
A FATIGUE FROM MANY, MANY HOURS 
OF HEARINGS SANDWICHED INTO ONE 

00:56:38.205 --> 00:56:40.205
OR TWO WEEKS. WE REPORTERS ARE 
LISTENING TO EVERY WORD, 

00:56:40.405 --> 00:56:42.405
AMERICANS I DON'T 

00:56:45.273 --> 00:56:47.273
THINK OUR ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 
THESE ARE HAPPENING IT TO THE 

00:56:47.305 --> 00:56:48.926
WORKDAY. AS OPPOSED TO THE 
WATERGATE IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS 

00:56:48.927 --> 00:56:51.159
THAT HAPPENED IN THE EVENING. 
THAT BEING SAID, HEADLINES ARE 

00:56:51.361 --> 00:56:53.361
STILL COMING OUT. WHITE HOUSE 
AIDE SAYS HE 

00:56:57.047 --> 00:56:59.047
THINKS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ASKED FOR POLITICAL FAVORS AND A

00:56:59.093 --> 00:57:01.728
PHONE CALL, ALEXANDER VINDMAN. A
TRUMP APPOINTEE SAID THAT HE 

00:57:01.927 --> 00:57:03.927
THOUGHT THERE WAS A QUID PRO 
QUO. I ASSUME WE 

00:57:07.011 --> 00:57:08.682
WILL HEAR SIMILAR DAMAGING 
INFORMATION FROM FIONA HILL, 

00:57:08.683 --> 00:57:10.683
ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE AIDE. EVEN 
WITNESSES THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE 

00:57:10.863 --> 00:57:16.547
CALLED HAVEN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY
PARTICIPATORY TO REPUBLICAN 

00:57:16.761 --> 00:57:18.846
EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THE 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY SAYING I DO 

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:22.849
THINK IT WAS WRONG FOR A 
PRESIDENT TO INVESTIGATE HIS 

00:57:25.285 --> 00:57:27.285
POLITICAL OPPONENT WHEN THEY'RE 
ASKED A HYPOTHETICAL ABOUT 

00:57:29.956 --> 00:57:31.993
THIS. SO, THE WASHINGTON POST, 
ABC NEWS, AND OTHER OUTLETS WILL

00:57:32.191 --> 00:57:36.462
BE POLLING AFTER THIS TO THE 
EXTENT OF IS THERE ANY SUPPORT 

00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:38.662
IN FAVOR 

00:57:41.129 --> 00:57:43.367
OF REMOVING PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM
OFFICE? THAT COULD GO A LONG WAY

00:57:43.567 --> 00:57:45.802
TO INFORMING HOUSE REPUBLICANS 
WHO MIGHT BE ON THE FENCE  ABOUT

00:57:46.002 --> 00:57:48.037
WHETHER TO VOTE TO IMPEACH 
TRUMP, IF THERE ARE ANY. AND 

00:57:48.237 --> 00:57:52.154
THEN FROM THERE, I DON'T SEE ANY
BREAK IN THE DEFENSES AMONG 

00:57:52.342 --> 00:57:56.779
SENATE REPUBLICANS AND 
SUPPORTING TRUMP, I WILL NOT 

00:57:56.972 --> 00:57:58.804
PREDICT THIS IS ENTIRELY 
PARTYLINE IF PUBLIC OPINION CAN 

00:57:58.805 --> 00:58:00.841
BE SWAYED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THESE
PUBLIC 

00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:07.331
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE SEEING CHAIRMAN SCHIFF

00:58:07.747 --> 00:58:09.974
SIT DOWN AT THE DAIS, DEMOCRATS 
ARE COMING INTO THE ROOM. WE 

00:58:10.181 --> 00:58:14.507
WILL BE CONTINUING TO WATCH FOR 
WHEN THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE 

00:58:14.699 --> 00:58:16.887
GET SEATED AND THE WITNESSES 
COME INTO THE ROOM AS WELL. ONCE

00:58:17.087 --> 00:58:19.523
THAT HAPPENS WE WILL GO BIG 
PICTURE ON THAT SO WE DON'T MISS

00:58:19.723 --> 00:58:21.723
ANY OF THE 

00:58:25.152 --> 00:58:27.152
ACTION HAPPENING.

00:58:29.277 --> 00:58:31.298
THIS ROOM HAS SEEN SO MUCH 
DRAMATIC TESTIMONY OVER THE PAST

00:58:31.512 --> 00:58:33.746
TWO WEEKS. I WANT TO PLAY A 
LITTLE BIT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:36.019
RESPONSE YESTERDAY. I THINK THE 
TAPE PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL, 

00:58:36.207 --> 00:58:38.207
LET'S PLAY IT. 
&gt;&gt; WAS GOING ON IN TERMS OF 

00:58:38.216 --> 00:58:42.471
TESTIMONY WITH AMBASSADORS 
ONLINE. SONDLAND. I JUST NOTICED

00:58:42.684 --> 00:58:48.002
ONE THING, AND I WOULD SAY THAT 
MEANS IT'S ALL OVER. WHAT DO YOU

00:58:48.192 --> 00:58:50.192
WANT FROM UKRAINE? HE 

00:58:54.184 --> 00:58:56.892
ASKS ME. SCREAMING. WHAT DO YOU 
WANT FROM UKRAINE? BUT, HERE IS 

00:58:57.106 --> 00:59:00.345
MY RESPONSE. IF YOU WANT FAKE 
NEWS OR IF YOU WANT FAKE NEWS 

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:04.211
YOU WOULD COVER IT PROPERLY. I 
SAID TO THE AMBASSADOR IN 

00:59:06.845 --> 00:59:09.294
RESPONSE "I WANT NOTHING, I WANT
NOTHING, I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO 

00:59:10.296 --> 00:59:16.003
, TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO DO 
THE RIGHT THING." HERE IS MY 

00:59:16.196 --> 00:59:18.196
ANSWER, I 

00:59:20.863 --> 00:59:23.298
WANT NOTHING. "I WANT NOTHING, I
WANT NOTHING, I WANT NO QUID PRO

00:59:23.512 --> 00:59:25.947
QUO,  TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO
DO THE RIGHT THING." THAT HE 

00:59:30.618 --> 00:59:32.852
SAYS "THIS IS THE FINAL WORD 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:59:33.053 --> 00:59:35.903
STATES, "I WANT NOTHING." 
&gt;&gt; LET'S GET YOUR RESPONSE TO 

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:38.541
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING. A 
DRAMATIC READING OF YESTERDAY, 

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:42.028
ESSENTIALLY REENACTING THE 
HEARING. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE 

00:59:42.214 --> 00:59:46.862
TO HOW THE PRESIDENT IS ALERT 
DELIVERED THAT INFORMATION, AND 

00:59:47.063 --> 00:59:49.063
HOW WHAT HIS PERSPECTIVE IS? 

00:59:58.245 --> 01:00:00.245
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS AN INTERESTING 
MOMENT, OUR PHOTOGRAPHER AT THE 

01:00:00.278 --> 01:00:02.511
WASHINGTON POST GOT AN IMAGE OF 
THE NOTES HE WAS CARRYING 

01:00:02.712 --> 01:00:06.776
WRITTEN IN HIS DISTINCTIVE 
HANDWRITING AND A BLACK SHARPIE 

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:11.644
SAYING "I WANT NOTHING,  I WANT 
NOTHING, I WANT TO KNOW NO QUID 

01:00:11.846 --> 01:00:14.078
PRO QUO."  IT IS CLEAR WHAT 
TRUMP WANTED TO EMPHASIZE WAS 

01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:16.293
HIS 

01:00:19.308 --> 01:00:21.308
CONVERSATION THAT

01:00:23.422 --> 01:00:25.253
GORDON SONDLAND RECOUNTED TO 
LAWMAKERS, HE SAID WHEN THIS 

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:27.254
BECAME A MAJOR REPUBLICAN 
TALKING POINT THAT WHEN HE ASKED

01:00:27.287 --> 01:00:29.287
DONALD TRUMP ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A QUID PRO QUO, 

01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:31.574
TRUMP DENIED IT.  THAT IS WHAT 
THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA PICKED UP

01:00:32.973 --> 01:00:35.208
ON YESTERDAY. THE ENTIRE SORT OF
FOX NEWS WORLD HAD A VERY 

01:00:39.276 --> 01:00:40.932
DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAN THE 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA ABOUT THOSE 

01:00:40.933 --> 01:00:44.960
HEARINGS. THEY SAID A PARTICULAR
THAT, IN FACT, GORDON SONDLAND'S

01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:47.195
TESTIMONY WAS THE NAIL ON THE 
COFFIN NOT FOR TRUMP'S CHANCES 

01:00:47.396 --> 01:00:50.044
IN THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BUT 
IN THE IMPEACHMENT 

01:00:55.053 --> 01:00:57.962
INQUIRY ITSELF. WHEN WE TALK 
ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION ON WHAT IS 

01:00:58.163 --> 01:01:00.163
HAPPENING HERE, WE HAVE TO 
REMEMBER THAT IT REALLY DEPENDS 

01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:02.197
ON WHERE AMERICANS GET THEIR 
NEWS. DEPENDING UPON WHAT THEY 

01:01:02.219 --> 01:01:05.473
ARE WATCHING, HOW MUCH THEY ARE 
PROCESSING THE INFORMATION. THEY

01:01:05.681 --> 01:01:08.321
ARE GOING TO BE ABSORBING TWO 
DIFFERENT MESSAGES FROM THE TWO 

01:01:08.537 --> 01:01:12.041
PARTIES. 
&gt;&gt; AMBER, YESTERDAY WE 

01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:18.678
TALKED ABOUT HOW IT TOOK THEM A 
LITTLE WHILE TO REACT AND 

01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:20.879
DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR 
COUNTERING WHAT GORDON SONDLAND 

01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:24.333
WAS SAYING. BUT, HOW ARE 
REPUBLICANS HOPING TO GO INTO 

01:01:24.385 --> 01:01:26.401
THE WEEKEND AND THE THANKSGIVING
RECESS WITH THE WIND AT THEIR 

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.671
BACK? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE

01:01:31.672 --> 01:01:33.733
WIND AT THEIR BACK RIGHT NOW 
AFTER THESE TWO WEEKS OF 

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.937
HEARINGS? I THINK, PRIVATELY THE
DUST 

01:01:35.938 --> 01:01:38.386
&gt;&gt; AMBER YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THAT
FROM TALKING TO THEM. I WOULD 

01:01:39.188 --> 01:01:41.188
LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT 
YOU'RE HEARING PRIVATELY VERSUS 

01:01:41.223 --> 01:01:43.670
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING PUBLICLY. 
THE WAY THEY ARE REACTING TO IT,

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:48.136
YOU WOULD THINK THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING NO QUID PRO QUO MEANT 

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:52.391
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HERE WAS 
WRONG.  AS AS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

01:01:52.604 --> 01:01:55.443
POINTING OUT, IF YOU'RE 
MURDERING SOMEONE AND SAYING I 

01:01:55.643 --> 01:01:58.281
AM NOT MURDERING THEM, ISN'T IT 
STILL A CRIME? BREAK IT DOWN FOR

01:01:58.495 --> 01:02:00.728
US WHAT YOU'RE HEARING 
PRIVATELY. 

01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:02.729
&gt;&gt; OUR 

01:02:05.798 --> 01:02:07.227
WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS AND 
CONGRESSIONAL REPORTERS HAVE 

01:02:07.228 --> 01:02:09.249
TALKED PRIVATELY TO WHITE HOUSE 
AIDES AND PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL

01:02:09.464 --> 01:02:11.699
WHO HAVE SAID I SEE THE GORDON 
SONDLAND TESTIMONY IS BAD FOR 

01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:14.535
US. THAT WASN'T HELPFUL FOR HIM 
TO GO OUT THERE AND 

01:02:18.606 --> 01:02:20.606
ESSENTIALLY HINT AT IMPLICATING 
THE PRESIDENT. I THINK HE WALKED

01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:23.074
A FINE LINE ON THAT. WITH THAT 
BEING SAID, YOU ARE RIGHT, THEY 

01:02:23.274 --> 01:02:27.544
ARE FULL FRONT AND CENTER, 
DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT, RAISING

01:02:28.146 --> 01:02:32.415
THE VOICES, TRYING TO UNDERMINE 
THESE WITNESSES BY PULLING A 

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.616
LITTLE THREADS OF THEIR STORY. 
THEY 

01:02:38.301 --> 01:02:40.951
ARE THROWING A LOT OF STUFF OUT 
THERE BUT A COMMON THEME I HEAR 

01:02:41.152 --> 01:02:43.185
IS THAT NONE OF THESE WITNESSES 
CAN SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTLY

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.620
TOLD ME TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE 
UKRAINIANS. THE PROBLEM WITH 

01:02:46.435 --> 01:02:51.782
THAT IS FACTUALLY, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS NOT A RELIABLE WITNESS.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:54.141
HE HAS EVERY INCENTIVE TO NOT 
GET IMPEACHED, 

01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:59.603
AND THEREFORE, TO TELL GORDON 
SONDLAND EVEN IN HIS PRIVATE 

01:02:59.635 --> 01:03:03.486
PHONE CALL IN SEPTEMBER THERE 
WAS NO QUID PRO QUO.  GORDON 

01:03:03.701 --> 01:03:07.555
SONDLAND, UNDER QUESTIONING FROM
REPUBLICANS LAWYERS, WHO ASKED 

01:03:07.756 --> 01:03:09.756
HIM, HOW DO YOU KNOW RUDY 
GIULIANI, TRUMP'S PERSONAL 

01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:14.259
LAWYER, WAS TELLING YOU WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED? SONDLAND

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:19.329
SIMPLY SAID , THE PRESIDENT TOLD
US GO TALK TO MY LAWYER RUDY 

01:03:19.544 --> 01:03:21.544
GIULIANI. SO 

01:03:23.593 --> 01:03:25.842
IF GIULIANI TELLS US TO DO 
SOMETHING, I WILL ASSUME IT IS 

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.860
COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT. THERE
IS A COMMONSENSE ARGUMENT, 

01:03:27.861 --> 01:03:29.861
DEMOCRATS AND 

01:03:31.317 --> 01:03:33.350
THEIR WITNESSES HAVE HELPED THEM
MAKE THAT THIS WAS COMING FROM 

01:03:33.552 --> 01:03:35.552
TRUMP, THAT REPUBLICANS LACK 
RIGHT 

01:03:38.221 --> 01:03:40.221
NOW. BUT, I SEE ABSOLUTELY NO 
INDICATION OF ANY REPUBLICAN 

01:03:40.253 --> 01:03:44.566
DEFECTIONS AT THE END OF THE 
WEEK. SAME THING AS WE SAW AT 

01:03:44.756 --> 01:03:49.394
THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE 

01:03:50.257 --> 01:03:54.535
HEARING ROOM. ELISE, I WANT TO 
BRING YOU IN AND TALK TO YOU 

01:03:54.722 --> 01:03:56.498
ABOUT WHAT ELSE GORDON SONDLAND 
SAID YESTERDAY. HE PLACED 

01:03:56.499 --> 01:04:00.768
POMPEO, THE VICE PRESIDENT 
FIRMLY IN THE LOOP, HOW MUCH 

01:04:00.987 --> 01:04:02.400
JEOPARDY ARE THEY IN AT THIS 
POINT? 

01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:06.701
&gt;&gt; IT IS INTERESTING. THOSE WERE
VERY IMPORTANT POINTS TO GORDON 

01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:08.889
SONDLAND'S TESTIMONY. THEY 
CALLED INTO QUESTION, 

01:04:12.897 --> 01:04:15.201
DEMOCRATS CHOICE TO COMPRESS 
THIS TIMELINE FOR THE 

01:04:15.473 --> 01:04:17.473
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AND PERHAPS
END THE PUBLIC HEARINGS TODAY? 

01:04:17.637 --> 01:04:19.872
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL BE 
MORE PUBLIC HEARINGS PAST WHAT 

01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:24.329
WE SEE THIS MORNING. SO FAR, THE
BULK OF THE TRUMP 

01:04:24.544 --> 01:04:27.039
ADMINISTRATION, VIRTUALLY 
EVERYONE EXCEPT THOSE WITNESSES,

01:04:27.234 --> 01:04:29.818
HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH 
INQUIRIES AND SUBPOENAS FROM 

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.452
IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATORS. IT IS
VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE PEOPLE 

01:04:35.503 --> 01:04:37.503
WHO, PERHAPS, TRUMP WAS BEING 
MORE CANDID WITH LIKE A 

01:04:37.605 --> 01:04:40.387
SECRETARY OF STATE, LIKE VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE,  LIKE HIS 

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:44.642
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MICK 
MULVANEY, WILL BE DEPOSED BY 

01:04:46.476 --> 01:04:48.476
INVESTIGATORS OR INDEED GRILLED 
BEFORE THE PUBLIC THE WAY WE 

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.344
HAVE SEEN THESE OTHER 
IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES BE. I 

01:04:51.557 --> 01:04:55.209
THINK IT IS VITAL FOR DEMOCRATS 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON 

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.862
AT THE HIGHER LEVEL. WHETHER 
THEY EVER WILL IS AN OPEN 

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:02.113
QUESTION. I THINK WE WILL SEE 
HOW MUCH THEY FEEL THEY HAVE 

01:05:02.314 --> 01:05:04.314
ONCE 

01:05:07.316 --> 01:05:11.863
THIS PROCESS MOVES FROM THE 
INTELLIGENCE AND OVERSIGHT AND 

01:05:12.063 --> 01:05:13.692
JUDICIARY COMMITTEES OR FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS COMMITTEES, EXCUSE ME, 

01:05:13.693 --> 01:05:15.693
WHERE IT IS NOW TO THE HOUSE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHERE 

01:05:15.727 --> 01:05:17.545
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WILL BE 
DRAFTED. THOSE ARTICLES WILL 

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:21.613
REFLECT WHAT DEMOCRATS FEEL IS 
THE BEST CASE. WE DON'T QUITE 

01:05:21.814 --> 01:05:24.865
KNOW WHAT THAT CASE IS YET. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THANK YOU 

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520
SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, AS SOON AS 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 

01:05:33.802 --> 01:05:36.236
ARE DRAFTED AND VOTED ON BY THE 
HOUSE FLOOR, IT DOES TURN OVER 

01:05:36.438 --> 01:05:39.938
TO THE SENATE. THEN WE'LL SEE 
ESSENTIALLY A TRIAL, WE ARE 

01:05:40.122 --> 01:05:42.337
WATCHING TO SEE WHAT UNFOLDS IN 
THE SENATE THAT COULD SET UP 

01:05:42.537 --> 01:05:47.408
MORE DRAMATIC DAYS AND DRAMATIC 
TESTIMONY. LET'S GO NOW TO THE 

01:05:47.622 --> 01:05:51.274
HEARING ROOM LIVE WHERE CHAIRMAN
SCHIFF IS ABOUT TO GAVEL IN.  WE

01:05:51.474 --> 01:05:53.474
WILL BRING THE HEARING TO LIVE 

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:57.363
IN AN UNINTERRUPTED LIFE 
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. STAY 

01:05:57.364 --> 01:05:59.364
TUNED MORE COVERAGE FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST. 

01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:09.923
&gt;&gt; THE COMMITTEE WILL COME TO 
ORDER. GOOD 

01:06:12.805 --> 01:06:14.839
MORNING EVERYONE, THIS IS THE 
SEVENTH IN A SERIES OF PUBLIC 

01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:17.475
HEARINGS THE COMMITTEE WILL BE 
HOLDING AS A PART OF THE HOUSE 

01:06:17.676 --> 01:06:21.567
OF REPRESENTATIVES IMPEACHMENT 
INQUIRY. WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO 

01:06:21.762 --> 01:06:26.213
DECLARE A RECESS OF THE 
COMMITTEE AT ANYTIME. THERE IS A

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:28.647
QUORUM PRESENT, WE WILL PROCEED 
TODAY IN THE SAME FASHION AS OUR

01:06:29.663 --> 01:06:31.663
OTHER HEARINGS. I WILL MAKE AN 
OPENING STATEMENT AND THEN 

01:06:31.714 --> 01:06:35.963
RANKING MEMBER NUNES  WILL MAKE 
A STATEMENT AND THEN WILL RETURN

01:06:36.164 --> 01:06:38.164
TO OUR WITNESSES FOR THEIR 
OPENING STATEMENTS AND 

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:44.283
THEN TO QUESTIONS. AUDIENCE 
MEMBERS WE WELCOME YOU AND 

01:06:44.284 --> 01:06:46.518
RESPECT YOUR INTEREST IN BEING 
CARE, IN TURN WE ASK FOR YOUR 

01:06:46.719 --> 01:06:48.719
RESPECT AS WE PROCEED WITH 
TODAY'S HEARING. IT IS THE 

01:06:48.753 --> 01:06:50.590
INTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE TO 
PROCEED WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS. AS 

01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:52.591
CHAIRMAN I WILL TAKE ALL 
NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE 

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.620
COMMITTEE IS RUN IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH HOUSE RULES AND HOUSE 

01:06:56.472 --> 01:06:58.506
RESOLUTION 660. WITH THAT I NOW 
RECOGNIZE MYSELF TO GIVE AN 

01:06:59.524 --> 01:07:01.524
OPENING STATEMENT IN THE 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO GENTLE 

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:03.756
J TRUMP, THE 45th PRESIDENT OF 
THE 

01:07:06.428 --> 01:07:07.846
UNITED STATES. YESTERDAY 
MORNING, THE COMMITTEE HEARD 

01:07:07.847 --> 01:07:09.879
FROM AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND.
THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO THE 

01:07:11.713 --> 01:07:13.771
EUROPEAN UNION, THE DE FACTO 
LEADER OF THE THREE AMIGOS. HAD 

01:07:13.958 --> 01:07:20.037
REGULAR ACCESS TO PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 

01:07:20.238 --> 01:07:22.238
ZELENSKY, 

01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:28.977
TWO INVESTIGATIONS. THE FIRST 
INVESTIGATION WAS OF A 

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:31.615
DISCREDITED COMPUTER'S 
CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT UKRAINE, 

01:07:31.816 --> 01:07:35.884
NOT RUSSIA, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
INTERFERING IN OUR 2016 

01:07:36.158 --> 01:07:38.117
ELECTION. THE SECOND 
INVESTIGATION WAS INTO THE 

01:07:38.118 --> 01:07:41.972
VERTICAL RIVAL TRUMP APPARENTLY 
FEARED MOST, JOE BIDEN. TRUMP 

01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:47.071
SOUGHT TO WEAKEN BIDEN AND TO 
REFUTE THE FACT THAT HIS OWN 

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:49.083
ELECTION HAD BEEN HELPED BY 
RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING 

01:07:49.084 --> 01:07:51.523
OPERATION, AND RUSSIAN SOCIAL 
MEDIA CAMPAIGN DIRECTED BY 

01:07:55.623 --> 01:07:57.420
VANDEMERE PUTIN. TRUMP'S SCHEME 
STOOD IN CONTRAST TO THE 

01:07:57.421 --> 01:08:01.074
LONG-STANDING BIPARTISAN FOREIGN
POLICY OF UNITED DATES. BY 

01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:04.526
UNDERMINING MILITARY AND SOMATIC
SUPPORT FOR A KEY ALLY AND 

01:08:04.727 --> 01:08:06.727
SETBACK U.S. ANTICORRUPTION 
EFFORTS 

01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:12.002
IN UKRAINE. IN CONDITIONING A 
MEETING WITH ZELENSKY AND THEN 

01:08:12.035 --> 01:08:14.035
MILITARY AID ON SECURING AN 
INVESTIGATION OF HIS RIVAL , 

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:19.555
TRUMP PUT HIS PERSONAL AND LOCAL
INTERESTS ABOVE UNITED STATES AS

01:08:19.755 --> 01:08:22.402
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND WOULD LATER 
TELL DAVID HOLMES  IMMEDIATELY 

01:08:22.604 --> 01:08:25.853
AFTER SPEAKING TO THE PRESIDENT,
TRUMP DID NOT GIVE AN EXPLETIVE 

01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:33.570
ABOUT UKRAINE. HE CARES ABOUT 
BIG STUFF, THAT BENEFITS HIM, 

01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:36.004
LIKE THE BIDEN INVESTIGATION 
THAT GIULIANI WAS PUSHING. DAVID

01:08:36.204 --> 01:08:40.270
HOLMES IS HERE WITH US TODAY. HE
IS A FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER 

01:08:40.471 --> 01:08:45.758
CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE "CANCER
AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN KIEV.  

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:50.025
ALSO WITH US IS DR. FIONA HILL 
WHO IS THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

01:08:50.227 --> 01:08:53.678
SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AND
RUSSIAN AFFAIRS COORDINATES 

01:08:53.878 --> 01:08:55.878
EUROPEAN POLICY 

01:08:57.946 --> 01:09:00.178
TOWARD UKRAINE. AFTER LEFT THE 
NFC IN JULY AFTER MORE THAN TWO 

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.614
YEARS IN THAT POSITION.  DR. 
HILL AND MR. HOLMES PROVIDE A 

01:09:02.815 --> 01:09:06.883
UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON ISSUES TO 
UKRAINE. DR. HILL FROM 

01:09:07.084 --> 01:09:12.020
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND MR. HOLMES 
FROM ON THE GROUND IN KIEV.  IN 

01:09:12.209 --> 01:09:14.391
EARLY 2019, DR. HILL BECAME 
CONCERNED WITH THE INCREASING 

01:09:14.605 --> 01:09:16.605
PROMINENCE OF RUDY GIULIANI, THE
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL 

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.128
THE WIRE LAWYER,, WHO WAS AS SHE
HAS TESTIFIED, ASSERTING, QUITE 

01:09:23.328 --> 01:09:25.979
FREQUENTLY ON TELEVISION AND 
PUBLIC APPEARANCES THAT HE HAD 

01:09:26.179 --> 01:09:29.831
BEEN GIVEN SOME AUTHORITY OVER 
MATTERS RELATED TO UKRAINE. SHE 

01:09:30.031 --> 01:09:32.902
WAS NOT ALONE IN HER CONCERNS, 
HER BOSS, JOHN BOLTON, WAS ALSO 

01:09:35.116 --> 01:09:38.772
PAYING ATTENTION AS WERE OTHER 
NFC AS THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS.

01:09:39.172 --> 01:09:42.428
INCLUDING HOLMES AT THE U.S. 
EMBASSY IN KIEV.  BOLTON VIEWED 

01:09:42.699 --> 01:09:45.878
GIULIANI AS A HAND GRENADE THAT 
WAS GOING TO BLOW 

01:09:50.347 --> 01:09:52.378
EVERYBODY UP. AND WAS POWERLESS 
TO PREVENT THE FORMER MAYOR FROM

01:09:52.586 --> 01:09:54.410
ENGINEERING FORMER U.S. 
AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE MARIA YOU 

01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:56.411
ONE OF WHICH 

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.860
IS FIRING. MARIA YOVANOVITCH 

01:10:03.347 --> 01:10:06.196
FIRING.  BY NAME, AS A U.S. 
AMBASSADOR, AND THE SCOPE OF THE

01:10:06.397 --> 01:10:09.246
AND ALLEGATIONS LEVELED AGAINST 
HER. YOVANOVITCH'S  

01:10:13.299 --> 01:10:15.299
DISMISSAL AS A RESULT OF 
GIULIANI SMEAR CAMPAIGN WAS ONE 

01:10:15.332 --> 01:10:17.766
OF SEVERAL THINGS THAT UNSETTLED
DR. HILL. ANOTHER WAS THE ROLE 

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:21.631
OF GORDON SONDLAND, WHO EMERGED 
AS A KEY PLAYER IN UKRAINIAN 

01:10:21.831 --> 01:10:23.831
POLICY 

01:10:25.084 --> 01:10:27.721
IN MAY, WHEN HE WAS NAMED AS A 
PART OF THE U.S. DELEGATION LED 

01:10:27.934 --> 01:10:31.586

PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, TOOK THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVISE THE NEW 

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.078
UKRAINIAN LEADER TO STAY OUT OF 
U.S. DOMESTIC POLITICS. ANOTHER 

01:10:47.266 --> 01:10:52.106
CONCERN THAT AROSE FOR DR. HILL 
AROUND THIS TIME WAS A DISCOVERY

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.737
OF A POTENTIAL NFC BACK CHANNEL 
ON UKRAINE. HILL LEARNED THAT AN

01:10:54.936 --> 01:10:56.936
NFC STAFF MEMBER WHO DO NOT WORK

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:01.641

01:11:18.504 --> 01:11:20.504
PERSONALLY REACHING OUT TO  
PRESENT ZELENSKY AND HIS SENIOR 

01:11:23.789 --> 01:11:25.789
TEAM.  SONDLAND'S NEWFOUND 
ASSERTIVENESS ALSO CONCERNED DR.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.823
HILL  WHO PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED 

01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:31.910
A CORDIAL WORKING RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE AMBASSADOR. IN 2018 

01:11:31.911 --> 01:11:33.911
HILL HAD 

01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:42.679
A BLOWUP WITH SONDLAND WHEN HE 
TOLD HER THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE 

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.712
OF UKRAINE POLICY. DR. HILL 
TESTIFIED THAT SONDLAND GOT 

01:11:44.713 --> 01:11:47.751
TESTY WITH ME AND I SAID WHO HAS
PUT YOU IN CHARGE OF IT?  HE 

01:11:47.966 --> 01:11:50.398
SAID, THE PRESIDENT. ON JULY 
10th, DR. HILL WAS A PART OF A 

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.887
MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
A GROUP OF U.S. AND UKRAINIAN 

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:54.667
OFFICIALS,  INCLUDING BOLTON, 
SONDLAND, AND ENERGY SECRETARY 

01:11:54.668 --> 01:11:56.668
PERRY , ANOTHER OF THE 

01:11:59.942 --> 01:12:01.942
THREE AMIGOS. THE MEETING WAS 
INTENDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A 

01:12:01.978 --> 01:12:03.978
CHANCE TO GET 

01:12:06.043 --> 01:12:08.062
THE UKRAINIANS A CHANCE TO 
CONVEY THAT THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO

01:12:08.276 --> 01:12:10.309
SET UP A NEW MEETING, A FIRST 
MEETING, BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT 

01:12:10.509 --> 01:12:12.509
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.  

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.614
SONDLAND  ALERTED THE GROUP THAT
WHITE HOUSE MEETINGS SOUGHT BY 

01:12:17.813 --> 01:12:19.646
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WITH 
TRUMP WOULD HAPPEN IF UKRAINE 

01:12:19.647 --> 01:12:21.967
UNDERTOOK CERTAIN 
INVESTIGATIONS. HEARING THIS, 

01:12:22.153 --> 01:12:24.153
BOLTON ABRUPTLY ENDED 

01:12:26.348 --> 01:12:27.767
THE MEETING. UNDETERRED, 
SONDLAND BROUGHT THE UKRAINIAN 

01:12:27.768 --> 01:12:29.768
DELEGATION AND THE NFC DIRECTOR 
FOR 

01:12:33.054 --> 01:12:34.914
THE UKRAINE, ALEXANDER VINDMAN 
DOWNSTAIRS TO ANOTHER PART OF 

01:12:34.915 --> 01:12:38.128
THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE 
LATER JOINED  BY DR. HILL. IN 

01:12:38.328 --> 01:12:41.794
THE SECOND MEETING, SONDLAND WAS
MORE EXPLICIT.  UKRAINE NEEDED 

01:12:41.995 --> 01:12:46.462
TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS IF 
THEY WERE TO GET A MEETING AT 

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:48.897
ALL. BOLTON DIRECTED DR. HILL TO
REPORT THIS TO NFC LEGAL ADVISOR

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.946
JOHN EISENBERG, TELLING HER YOU 
GO AND TELL JOHN EISENBERG THEN 

01:12:52.147 --> 01:12:56.413
I AM NOT A PART OF WHATEVER DRUG
DEAL SONDLAND AND MULVANEY ARE 

01:12:56.614 --> 01:13:00.683
COOKING UP ON THIS.  YOU GO 
AHEAD AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU HAVE

01:13:00.883 --> 01:13:03.720
HEARD AND WHAT I HAVE SAID. DR. 
HILL DID SO, AS DID THE TENANT 

01:13:03.998 --> 01:13:07.988
COLONEL VINDMAN WHO SEPARATELY 
APPROACHED  THE SAME LAWYERS 

01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:12.055
WITH HIS CONCERNS. ON JULY 18th,
THE DAY BEFORE DR. HILL LEFT HER

01:13:12.256 --> 01:13:16.325
POST AT THE NFC, HOLMES 
PARTICIPATED IN A SECURE 

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:18.526
INTERAGENCY VIDEOCONFERENCE 

01:13:20.782 --> 01:13:22.782
ON UKRAINE. TOWARDS THE END OF 
THE MEETING, A REPRESENTATIVE 

01:13:22.818 --> 01:13:26.739
FROM THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT 
AND BUDGET ANNOUNCED THE FLOW OF

01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:28.941
NEARLY $400 MILLION IN SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE WAS BEING

01:13:29.119 --> 01:13:32.371
HELD UP. THE ORDER HAD COME FROM
THE PRESIDENT, AND HAD BEEN 

01:13:33.584 --> 01:13:36.019
CONVEYED BY MICK MULVANEY 
WITHOUT 

01:13:41.032 --> 01:13:43.032
FURTHER EXPLANATION.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:47.039
HOLMES, UNAWARE OF THE CODE 
PRIOR TO THE CALL, WAS SHOCKED. 

01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:49.221
HE THOUGHT THE SUSPENSION OF AID
WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WERE WAS 

01:13:49.222 --> 01:13:51.222
SIGNIFICANT UNDERMINING WHAT HE 
UNDERSTOOD TO BE A LONG-STANDING

01:13:51.255 --> 01:13:53.255
NATIONAL SECURITY GO IN 

01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.359
THE UKRAINE. ONE WEEK LATER, ON 
JULY 25th, PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE

01:13:58.575 --> 01:14:00.597
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY BY 
PHONE. WHEN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:14:00.797 --> 01:14:03.444
BROUGHT UP U.S. MILITARY 
SUPPORT, AND NOTED THAT UKRAINE 

01:14:03.645 --> 01:14:07.761
WOULD LIKE TO BUY MORE JAVELIN 
ANTITANK MISSILES, TRUMP 

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:12.995
RESPONDED BY SAYING I WOULD LIKE
FOR YOU TO DO AS A FAVOR THOUGH.

01:14:13.196 --> 01:14:16.031
TRUMP THEN REQUESTED THAT 
ZELENSKY INVESTIGATE  THE 

01:14:16.246 --> 01:14:18.316
DISCREDITED CONSPIRACY THEORY 
THAT UKRAINE INTERFERED IN THE 

01:14:19.485 --> 01:14:21.485
2016 ELECTION. EVEN 

01:14:22.951 --> 01:14:24.951
MORE OMINOUSLY,  TRUMP ASKED 
ZELENSKY TO LOOK INTO THE 

01:14:26.402 --> 01:14:28.402
BIDENS.  NEITHER REQUEST HAVE 
BEEN INCLUDED IN THE OFFICIAL 

01:14:29.038 --> 01:14:33.506
TALKING POINTS WITH A CALL 
PREPARED BY THE NFC STAFF. BUT 

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:36.345
BOTH WERE IN DONALD TRUMP'S 
PERSONAL INTEREST AND THE 

01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:40.070
INTEREST OF HIS 2020 REELECTION 
CAMPAIGN. THE UKRAINIAN 

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:42.445
PRESIDENT KNEW ABOUT BOTH IN 
ADVANCE, IN PART BECAUSE OF 

01:14:43.059 --> 01:14:47.727
EFFORTS BY AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
AND  VOLKER TO MAKE THEM AWARE 

01:14:47.928 --> 01:14:52.396
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEMANDS.  
THE NEXT DAY, JULY 26th  IN 

01:14:52.596 --> 01:14:54.831
KIEV, HOLMES SERVED AS A 
NOTETAKER  DURING A MEETING 

01:14:55.044 --> 01:14:59.502
BETWEEN BILL TAYLOR, VOLKER, 
SONDLAND,  PRESENT ZELENSKY AND 

01:15:00.934 --> 01:15:04.383
OTHER  SENIOR UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS. ZELENSKY SAID ON THE 

01:15:04.584 --> 01:15:07.221
PREVIOUS DAY'S CALL  THAT ON THE
PREVIOUS DAY'S CALL, PRESIDENT 

01:15:10.269 --> 01:15:14.938
TRUMP HAD SPOKE THREE TIMES 
RAISED SOME VERY SENSITIVE 

01:15:15.152 --> 01:15:17.385
ISSUES THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO 
FOLLOW UP ON THOSE ISSUES WHEN 

01:15:17.587 --> 01:15:23.955
THEY MET IN PERSON. ALTHOUGH HE 
DID NOT REALIZE IT AT THE TIME, 

01:15:24.146 --> 01:15:27.535
HOLMES CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
THE SENSITIVE ISSUES WHERE THE 

01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:32.004
INVESTIGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DEMANDED ON THE JULY 25th 

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:34.210
CALL. FOLLOWING THE 

01:15:36.071 --> 01:15:37.715
MEETING WITH ZELENSKY, HE 
ACCOMPANIED SONDLAND TO A 

01:15:37.716 --> 01:15:40.940
SEPARATE MEETING WITH  THE 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TOP 

01:15:41.142 --> 01:15:43.142
ADVISERS,  ANDRIY 

01:15:46.226 --> 01:15:48.460
YERMAK.  HOLMES WAS NOT ALLOWED 
INTO THE MEETING, AND WAITED FOR

01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:51.096
30 MINUTES WHILE SONDLAND  AND 
THE UKRAINIAN MET ALONE, WITHOUT

01:15:51.296 --> 01:15:55.361
ANY NOTETAKERS TO RECORD WHAT 
THEY SAID. AFTER THE MEETING, 

01:15:55.563 --> 01:15:57.563
SONDLAND, HOLMES, 

01:15:59.026 --> 01:16:01.259
AND  TWO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT 
STAFF WENT TO LUNCH AT A 

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.113
RESTAURANT NEARBY AND SAT ON AN 
OUTDOOR TERRACE. AT SOME POINT 

01:16:05.313 --> 01:16:07.759
DURING THE MEAL, SONDLAND PULLED
OUT HIS CELL PHONE,  A CALL TO 

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:13.044
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND ASKED TO BE
CONNECTED TO THE PRESIDENT. WHEN

01:16:13.245 --> 01:16:15.479
TRUMP CAME ON THE LINE, HOLMES 
COULD HEAR THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:18.114
CLEARLY. HE RECALLED THAT "THE 
PRESIDENT VOICE WAS VERY LOUD 

01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:21.330
AND RECOGNIZABLE 

01:16:23.196 --> 01:16:25.429
AND AMBASSADOR SONDLAND HELD THE
PHONE AWAY FROM HIS EAR FOR A 

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:29.289
PERIOD OF TIME  PRESUMABLY 
BECAUSE OF THE LOUD VOLUME." 

01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:35.383
SONDLAND SAID HE WAS CALLING 
FROM KYIV,  KIEV. HE TOLD THE 

01:16:35.583 --> 01:16:37.416
PRESIDENT THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY LOVES YOUR  . HOLMES 

01:16:37.417 --> 01:16:39.653
THEN HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP ASK  
SO HE'S GOING TO DO THE 

01:16:39.969 --> 01:16:44.923
INVESTIGATION? SONDLAND  REPLIED
HE IS GOING TO DO IT ADDING THAT

01:16:45.137 --> 01:16:47.137
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WILL DO 
ANYTHING YOU 

01:16:50.622 --> 01:16:55.104
ASK HIM. AFTER THE CALL ENDED, 
HOLMES TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

01:16:55.305 --> 01:16:57.169
ASK SONDLAND FOR HIS CANDID 
IMPRESSION OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

01:16:57.170 --> 01:16:59.582
VIEWS ON UKRAINE.  IT WAS AT 
THIS POINT THAT SONDLAND  

01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:04.866
REVEALED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DOESN'T GIVE A EXPLETIVE ABOUT 

01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:09.759
UKRAINE. THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
CARES ABOUT BIG STAFF STUFF THAT

01:17:09.961 --> 01:17:12.038
BENEFITS THE PRESIDENT, LIKE THE
BIDEN INVESTIGATION THAT MR. 

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:14.227
GIULIANI WAS PUSHING. A 

01:17:16.682 --> 01:17:20.756
MONTH LATER NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR BOLTON TRAVELED TO KIEV.

01:17:21.159 --> 01:17:23.198
BETWEEN MEETINGS WITH UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS, HOLMES HEARD BOLTON 

01:17:23.398 --> 01:17:25.637
EXPRESS TO AMBASSADOR BILL 
TAYLOR HIS A FRUSTRATION ABOUT 

01:17:30.331 --> 01:17:32.258
MR. GIULIANI'S WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. WILL TO MAKE CLEAR 

01:17:32.259 --> 01:17:34.259
THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO 
ABOUT IT. BOLTON FURTHER STATED 

01:17:34.397 --> 01:17:39.492
THAT THE HOLD ON SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE WOULD NOT BE LISTED 

01:17:39.694 --> 01:17:41.733
LIFTED PRIOR TO THE MEETING VIA 
ZELENSKY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 

01:17:42.753 --> 01:17:44.777
WARSAW  AND WOULD HANG ON 
WHETHER ZELENSKY WAS ABLE TO 

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:46.990
FAVORABLY  IMPRESS 

01:17:50.405 --> 01:17:52.731
PRESIDENT TRUMP. TRUMP CANCELED 
HIS TRIP TO WARSAW BUT OTHERS 

01:17:52.932 --> 01:17:54.970
CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR A PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE OPENING OF 

01:17:55.172 --> 01:17:57.172
INVESTIGATIONS BY ZELENSKY. ON 
OCTOBER 8th,  TAYLOR TOLD HOLMES

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:02.696
THAT "NOW  THEY ARE INSISTING 
ZELENSKY COMMIT  TO THE 

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:06.574
INVESTIGATION IN AN INTERVIEW 
WITH CNN." HOLMES WAS SURPRISED 

01:18:06.773 --> 01:18:08.773
THE REQUIREMENT WAS A SPECIFIC 

01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.944
AND CONCRETE. IT AMOUNTED TO 
NOTHING LESS THAN "A DEMAND THAT

01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:16.351
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY PERSONALLY 
COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC 

01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:18.589
INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S POLITICAL RIVAL ON A 

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:20.790
CABLE 

01:18:23.816 --> 01:18:25.816
NEWS CHANNEL."

01:18:27.551 --> 01:18:29.551
ON SEPTEMBER 9th, THIS COMMITTEE
ALONG WITH A FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

01:18:29.576 --> 01:18:31.153
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE LAUNCHED OUR
INVESTIGATION OF  SCHEME,THIS 

01:18:31.154 --> 01:18:33.154
CORRUPT SCREEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
OR RELEASE THE WHOLE ON AID, TWO

01:18:34.056 --> 01:18:37.315
DAYS LATER. AS WE HAVE REVEALED,
UKRAINIANS CANCELED THE SCENE AN

01:18:37.516 --> 01:18:39.516
INTERVIEW 

01:18:41.593 --> 01:18:43.593
SHORTLY THEREAFTER. TWO WEEKS 
LATER, ON 

01:18:47.638 --> 01:18:49.948
SEPTEMBER 25th, THE TRANSCRIPT 
OF THE JULY 25th PHONE CALL WAS 

01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:52.681
RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
THE DETAILS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

01:18:57.691 --> 01:19:00.731
GAME SCHEME STARTED COMING INTO 
VIEW., AND A COUPLE OF DAYS 

01:19:00.947 --> 01:19:02.769
CONGRESS WILL DETERMINE WHAT 
RESPONSE IS APPROPRIATE, IF THE 

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.403
PRESIDENT ABUSED HIS POWER AND 
INVITED FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

01:19:04.404 --> 01:19:06.646
INTO OUR ELECTIONS. IF WE DON'T 
DO CONDITION, COURSE, OR BRIBE A

01:19:06.849 --> 01:19:08.849
ALLY TO AID HIS ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN AND DID SO BY 

01:19:10.344 --> 01:19:12.750
WITHHOLDING OFFICIAL ACTS, A 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING OR HUNDREDS 

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:16.008
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 
MILITARY AID, IT'LL BE FOR US TO

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:20.889
DECIDE WHETHER THOSE ACTS ARE 
COMPATIBLE WITH THE OFFICE OF 

01:19:21.504 --> 01:19:25.179
THE PRESIDENCY. I NOW RECOGNIZE 
RANKING MEMBER NUNES FOR ANY 

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.618
REMARKS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. 
&gt;&gt; 

01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:33.317
THANK YOU. THROUGHOUT THESE 
BIZARRE HEARINGS, DEMOCRATS HAVE

01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:36.171
STRUGGLED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMITTED SOME 

01:19:39.429 --> 01:19:41.429
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. IN HIS 
PHONE CALL WITH UKRAINIAN 

01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:44.110
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. THE OFFENSE 
ITSELF CHANGES DEPENDING UPON 

01:19:49.138 --> 01:19:53.073
THE DAY. RANGING FROM QUID PRO 
QUO TO EXTORTION, TO BRIBERY, TO

01:19:53.275 --> 01:19:55.713
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND THEN 
BACK TO QUID PRO QUO.  IT IS 

01:19:55.915 --> 01:19:58.566
CLEAR WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
ENFORCED OR HAVE BEEN FORCED 

01:19:58.767 --> 01:20:00.767
ONTO THIS CAROUSEL 

01:20:02.633 --> 01:20:04.674
OF ACCUSATIONS. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAD GOOD REASON TO BE WARY OF 

01:20:04.874 --> 01:20:07.326
UKRAINIAN ELECTION MEDDLING 
AGAINST HIS CAMPAIGN AND 

01:20:07.527 --> 01:20:09.527
WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION IN 

01:20:12.943 --> 01:20:15.064
THAT COUNTRY. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY, WHO DO NOT EVEN KNOW 

01:20:15.266 --> 01:20:18.528
AID TO UKRAINE HAD BEEN PAUSED 
AT THE TIME OF THE CALL HAS 

01:20:18.728 --> 01:20:22.390
REPEATEDLY SAID THERE WAS 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE 

01:20:22.591 --> 01:20:24.237
CONVERSATION. THE AIDE WAS 
RESUMED WITHOUT THE UKRAINIANS 

01:20:24.238 --> 01:20:28.300
TAKING THE ACTIONS THEY WERE 
SUPPOSEDLY BEING COERCED INTO 

01:20:28.502 --> 01:20:32.980
DOING. AID TO UKRAINE UNDER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN MUCH 

01:20:34.605 --> 01:20:38.280
MORE ROBUST THAN IT WAS UNDER 
PRESIDENT OBAMA. THANKS TO THE 

01:20:38.481 --> 01:20:40.481
PROVISION OF JAVELIN 

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.826
ANTITANK WEAPON. AS NUMEROUS 
WITNESSES HAVE TESTIFIED, 

01:20:47.026 --> 01:20:49.026
TEMPORARY HOLD ON FOREIGN AID 

01:20:52.523 --> 01:20:54.523
OCCURRED FREQUENTLY FOR MANY 
DIFFERENT REASONS. SO HOW DO WE 

01:20:54.562 --> 01:20:56.620
HAVE AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE WHEN
THERE IS NO ACTUAL MISDEED, AND 

01:20:56.808 --> 01:21:00.878
NO ONE EVEN CLAIMING TO BE A 
VICTIM.? THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

01:21:01.079 --> 01:21:03.079
TRIED TO SOLVE THIS DILEMMA WITH
A 

01:21:05.976 --> 01:21:07.976
SIMPLE SLOGAN "HE 

01:21:10.855 --> 01:21:12.913
GOT CAUGHT." PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE
ARE TO BELIEVE, WAS JUST ABOUT 

01:21:13.099 --> 01:21:15.536
TO DO SOMETHING WRONG AND 
GETTING CAUGHT WAS THE ONLY 

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.737
REASON HE BACKED DOWN FROM 
WHATEVER NEFARIOUS 

01:21:20.429 --> 01:21:23.274
THOUGHT CRIME THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
ACCUSING HIM OF 

01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:29.589
ALMOST COMMITTEE. I, ONCE AGAIN,
URGE AMERICANS TO CONTINUE TO 

01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:33.462
CONSIDER THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 
DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO 

01:21:33.664 --> 01:21:39.977
ARE NOW HURLING THESE CHARGES. 
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, IS NOT

01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:44.255
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO GOT CAUGHT, 
IT IS THE DEMOCRATS WHO 

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.300
GOT CAUGHT. THEY 

01:21:51.173 --> 01:21:53.003
GOT CAUGHT FALSELY CLAIMING THEY
HAD MORE THAN CIRCUMSTANTIAL 

01:21:53.004 --> 01:21:58.891
EVIDENCE THAT TRUMP COLLUDED 
WITH RUSSIANS TO HACK THE 2016 

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.960
ELECTION. THEY GOT CAUGHT 
ORCHESTRATING THIS ENTIRE 

01:22:06.813 --> 01:22:08.645
FARCE WITH THE WHISTLEBLOWER, 
AND LYING ABOUT THEIR SECRET 

01:22:08.646 --> 01:22:13.517
MEETINGS WITH HIM. THEY GOT 
CAUGHT DEFENDING THE FALSE 

01:22:13.718 --> 01:22:20.220
ALLEGATIONS OF THE STEELE 
DOSSIER, WHICH WAS PAID FOR BY 

01:22:20.494 --> 01:22:22.494
THEM. THEY 

01:22:25.504 --> 01:22:27.121
GOT CAUGHT BREAKING THEIR 
PROMISE THAT IMPEACHMENT WOULD 

01:22:27.122 --> 01:22:31.023
ONLY GO FORWARD WITH BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT BECAUSE OF HOW DAMAGING 

01:22:31.214 --> 01:22:33.220
IT IS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THEY 

01:22:37.287 --> 01:22:39.287
GOT CAUGHT RUNNING A SHAM 
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS FEATURING 

01:22:39.318 --> 01:22:42.803
SECRET DEPOSITIONS, HIDDEN 
TRANSCRIPTS, AND AN UNENDING 

01:22:42.997 --> 01:22:50.477
FLOOD OF DEMOCRAT LEAKS TO THE 
MEDIA. THEY GOT CAUGHT TRYING TO

01:22:50.692 --> 01:22:56.780
OBTAIN NUDE PHOTOS OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP  FROM RUSSIAN PRANKSTERS, 

01:22:56.984 --> 01:23:01.653
PRETENDING TO BE UKRAINIANS. 
AND, THEY GOT CAUGHT 

01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:06.902
COVERING UP FOR 

01:23:08.968 --> 01:23:10.599
ALEXANDRA CHALUPA, A DEMOCRATIC 
NATIONAL COMMITTEE OPERATIVE WHO

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.636
COLLUDED WITH UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS TO SMEAR THE TRUMP 

01:23:13.837 --> 01:23:15.837
CAMPAIGN. BY IMPROPERLY 
REDACTING HER NAME 

01:23:19.122 --> 01:23:21.558
FROM TRANSCRIPTS, AND REFUSING 
TO LET AMERICANS HEAR HER 

01:23:21.772 --> 01:23:23.772
TESTIMONY AS A WITNESS IN 

01:23:27.588 --> 01:23:29.692
THESE PROCEEDINGS. THAT IS THE 
DEMOCRAT'S PITIFUL LEGACY IN 

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:32.709
RECENT YEARS. THEY 

01:23:34.363 --> 01:23:37.812
GOT CAUGHT. MEANWHILE, THERE 
SUPPOSES STAR WITNESS TESTIFIED 

01:23:38.082 --> 01:23:40.082
THAT HE WAS GUESSING THAT 

01:23:43.094 --> 01:23:46.144
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS TYING 
UKRAINIAN AID TO INVESTIGATIONS 

01:23:46.345 --> 01:23:49.596
DESPITE NO ONE TELLING HIM THAT 
WAS TRUE. AND THE PRESIDENT 

01:23:49.797 --> 01:23:51.797
HIMSELF EXPLICITLY TELLING HIM 

01:23:53.865 --> 01:23:57.717
THE OPPOSITE, THAT HE WANTED 
NOTHING FROM UKRAINE. LADIES AND

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.372
GENTLEMEN, UNLESS THE DEMOCRATS 
ONCE AGAIN SCRAMBLE THEIR 

01:24:01.585 --> 01:24:04.823
KANGAROO COURT RULES, TODAY'S 
HEARING WORKS THE MERCIFUL END 

01:24:05.037 --> 01:24:07.037
OF 

01:24:08.073 --> 01:24:10.073
THE SPECTACLE IN THE IMPEACHMENT
COMMITTEE. FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE

01:24:12.745 --> 01:24:14.377
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. WHETHER 
THE DEMOCRATS REAP THE VERTICAL 

01:24:14.378 --> 01:24:18.232
BENEFIT THEY WANT FROM THIS 
IMPEACHMENT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 

01:24:18.432 --> 01:24:20.432
BUT THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE DONE TO
THIS COUNTRY WILL 

01:24:25.275 --> 01:24:28.192
BE LONG-LASTING. WITH THIS 
WRENCHING ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW 

01:24:28.592 --> 01:24:33.063
THE PRESIDENT, THEY HAVE PITTED 
AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER 

01:24:33.263 --> 01:24:36.112
AND POISONED THE MIND OF 
FANATICS, WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVE 

01:24:37.732 --> 01:24:39.732
THE ENTIRE GALAXY OF 

01:24:41.596 --> 01:24:43.233
BIZARRE ACCUSATIONS THEY HAVE 
LEVELED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT 

01:24:43.234 --> 01:24:45.234
SINCE THE DAY THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE 

01:24:49.315 --> 01:24:53.029
ELECTED HIM. I SINCERELY HOPE 
THE DEMOCRATS END THIS AFFAIR AS

01:24:53.216 --> 01:24:55.216
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO OUR 
NATION CAN BEGIN TO HEAL THE 

01:24:55.817 --> 01:24:57.817
MANY WOUNDS IT 

01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:03.940
HAS INFLICTED. PEOPLES FAITH IN 
GOVERNMENT, AND THEIR BELIEF 

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.140
THAT THEIR VOTE COUNTS FOR 
SOMETHING HAS BEEN SHAKEN. FROM 

01:25:06.173 --> 01:25:11.053
THE RUSSIA HOAX, TO THE SHODDY 
UKRAINIAN SEQUEL, THE DEMOCRATS 

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:17.756
GOT CAUGHT. LET'S HOPE THEY 
FINALLY LEARNING LESSON, GIVE 

01:25:17.956 --> 01:25:21.606
THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORIES A 
REST, AND FOCUS ON GOVERNING FOR

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.092
A CHANGE. IN ADDITION MR. 
CHAIRMAN, PURSUANT TO HOUSE RULE

01:25:27.293 --> 01:25:31.364

SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM KEY 
WITNESSES THAT YOU HAVE BLOCKED 

01:26:07.922 --> 01:26:11.376
FROM TESTIFYING. I'D ALSO LIKE 
TO TAKE A QUICK MOMENT ON AN 

01:26:11.576 --> 01:26:13.612
ASSERTION MS. HILL MADE IN THE 
STATEMENT THAT SHE SUBMITTED TO 

01:26:16.663 --> 01:26:19.098
THIS COMMITTEE. IN WHICH SHE 
CLAIMED THAT SOME COMMITTEE 

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.534
MEMBERS DENY THAT RUSSIA MEDDLED
IN THE 

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.600
2016 ELECTION. AS I NOTED IN MY 
OPENING STATEMENT, 

01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:34.538
ON WEDNESDAY, AND MARCH 2018 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

RESULTS OF A YEAR-LONG 

01:26:39.408 --> 01:26:42.493

CAN HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF 

01:27:16.571 --> 01:27:19.823
THE MEMORY. AS AMERICA MAY, OR 
MAY NOT KNOW, DEMOCRATS REFUSED 

01:27:20.037 --> 01:27:28.385
TO SIGN ON TO THE REPUBLICAN 
REPORT. INSTEAD, THEY DECIDED TO

01:27:28.571 --> 01:27:33.843
ADOPT MINORITY VIEWS. FILLED 
WITH COLLUSION CONSPIRACY 

01:27:34.043 --> 01:27:38.344
THEORIES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE FOR TWO 

01:27:39.729 --> 01:27:43.798
SEPARATE NATIONS TO ENGAGE IN 
ELECTION MEDDLING AT THE SAME 

01:27:43.999 --> 01:27:45.618
TIME REPUBLICANS BELIEVE WE 
SHOULD TAKE MEDDLING SERIOUSLY 

01:27:45.619 --> 01:27:48.125

01:34:02.422 --> 01:34:04.422
POLITICS, 

01:34:07.435 --> 01:34:11.764
I ARRIVED IN KIEV TO TAKE UP MY 
ASSIGNMENT AS POLITICAL 

01:34:11.964 --> 01:34:13.801
COUNSELOR IN AUGUST 2017, A YEAR
AFTER AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH 

01:34:13.802 --> 01:34:15.802
RECEIVED HER APPOINTMENT.  FROM 
AUGUST 2017 UNTIL HER REMOVAL 

01:34:15.829 --> 01:34:18.465
FROM POST I WAS HER KEY POLICY 
ADVISOR AND DEVELOPED A DEEP 

01:34:18.678 --> 01:34:23.145
RESPECT FOR HER DEDICATION, 
DETERMINATION, DECENCY, 

01:34:28.152 --> 01:34:30.152
AND PROFESSIONALISM. DURING THIS
TIME, WE WORKED TOGETHER 

01:34:30.253 --> 01:34:32.084
CLOSELY, SPEAKING MULTIPLE TIMES
PER DAY I ACCOMPANIED AMBASSADOR

01:34:32.085 --> 01:34:34.085
YOVANOVITCH  TOO 

01:34:37.502 --> 01:34:39.208
MANY MEETINGS WITH UKRAINIAN 
COUNTERPARTS. OUR WORK IN 

01:34:39.209 --> 01:34:41.209
UKRAINE FOCUSED ON THREE POLICY 
PRIORITIES, 

01:34:43.446 --> 01:34:45.079
DECENT SECURITY, ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND REFORM, AND ANTICORRUPTION 

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.080
AND RULE 

01:34:49.546 --> 01:34:51.378
OF LAW. THESE POLICIES MATCHED 
THE THREE CONSISTENT PRIORITIES 

01:34:51.379 --> 01:34:53.892
OF UKRAINIAN PEOPLE SINCE 2014 
AS MEASURED IN PUBLIC OPINION 

01:34:54.086 --> 01:34:57.063
POLLING. NAMELY AN END TO THE 
CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA RESTORES 

01:34:58.279 --> 01:35:00.279
NATIONAL UNITY 

01:35:02.146 --> 01:35:04.146
AND INTEGRITY. RESPONSIBLE 
ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT DELIVER 

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:07.216
EUROPEAN STANDARDS, GROWTH, AND 
OPPORTUNITY. AN INFECTIVE 

01:35:07.834 --> 01:35:09.834
DEDUCTION EFFECTIVE AND 

01:35:13.922 --> 01:35:20.829
IMPARTIAL RULE. OUR EFFORTS ON 
THIS THIRD PRIORITY IT IS DURING

01:35:21.029 --> 01:35:23.029
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH'S TENURE 
THAT 

01:35:24.682 --> 01:35:26.716
WHICH  ACHIEVED THE HARD PASSAGE
OF A LAW ESTABLISHING AN 

01:35:26.918 --> 01:35:29.965
INDEPENDENT COURT TO TRY PUBLIC 
CASES. THESE EFFORTS STRAINED 

01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:32.167
AMBASSADOR 

01:35:34.846 --> 01:35:36.526
YOVANOVITCH'S  RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND 

01:35:36.527 --> 01:35:38.527
SOME OF HIS ALLIES INCLUDING 

01:35:42.293 --> 01:35:44.293
PROSECUTOR GENERAL.

01:35:46.623 --> 01:35:48.455
THAT WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT NO 
UKRAINIANS, HOWEVER POWERFUL, 

01:35:48.456 --> 01:35:54.345
WERE ABOVE THE LAW. DESPITE HIS 
RESISTANCE, THE AMBASSADOR KEPT 

01:35:54.545 --> 01:35:56.545
PUSHING FOR ANTICORRUPTION AND 
OTHER POLICY 

01:35:59.217 --> 01:36:01.217
TOWARDS UKRAINE. BEGINNING IN 
MARCH 2019, THE SITUATION AT THE

01:36:01.249 --> 01:36:03.249
EMBASSY AND IN UKRAINE 

01:36:06.879 --> 01:36:10.390
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. 
SPECIFICALLY, THE THREE 

01:36:10.591 --> 01:36:12.591
PRIORITIES OF SECURITY, ECONOMY,
AND JUSTICE, AND OUR SUPPORT FOR

01:36:12.622 --> 01:36:15.270
UKRAINIAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE 
TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION BECAME 

01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:17.289
OVERSHADOWED BY A POLITICAL 
AGENDA PROMOTED BY FORMER NEW 

01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:21.359
YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI 
AND A CADRE OF OFFICIALS 

01:36:21.569 --> 01:36:25.221
OPERATING WITH THE DIRECT 
CHANNEL TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT

01:36:25.421 --> 01:36:27.421
CHANGE BEGAN WITH THE EMERGENCE 
OF PRESS REPORTS CRITICAL OF 

01:36:27.456 --> 01:36:30.969
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH  AND 
MACHINATIONS OF BY THEN THE 

01:36:31.309 --> 01:36:33.309
PROSECUTOR GENERAL TO 

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.823
DISCREDIT HER. IN MID-MARCH 
2019, AN EMBASSY COLLEAGUE 

01:36:38.824 --> 01:36:41.141
LEARNED FROM A UKRAINIAN CONTACT
THAT THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL HAD 

01:36:46.059 --> 01:36:47.583
COMPLAINED THAT AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH HAD "DESTROYED HIM 

01:36:47.584 --> 01:36:49.592
WITH HER REFUSAL TO SUPPORT HIM 
UNTIL HE FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH 

01:36:49.792 --> 01:36:51.792
HIS REFORM COMMITMENTS  AND 
CEASED USING HIS POSITION FOR 

01:36:51.865 --> 01:36:55.691
PERSONAL GAIN. IN RETALIATION, 
HE MADE A SERIES 

01:36:59.344 --> 01:37:00.761
OF UNSUPPORTED ALLEGATIONS OF 
MAINLY SUGGESTING THAT 

01:37:00.762 --> 01:37:04.425
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH  
IMPROPERLY USED THE EMBASSY TO 

01:37:09.435 --> 01:37:12.958
FURTHER THE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY. IT WAS THAT THE EMBASSY 

01:37:13.162 --> 01:37:14.980
HAD ORDERED THE INVESTIGATION OF
A FORMER UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL 

01:37:14.981 --> 01:37:16.814
SOLELY BECAUSE THE FORMER 
OFFICIAL WAS THE MAIN UKRAINIAN 

01:37:16.815 --> 01:37:20.667
CONTACT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
AND OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:37:20.881 --> 01:37:22.881
PERSONALLY. AND THAT THE 
EMBASSIES 

01:37:26.568 --> 01:37:28.183
ALLEGEDLY PRESSURED LUTSENKO'S 
PREDECESSOR, SOLELY BECAUSE OF A

01:37:28.184 --> 01:37:30.184
COLLECTION BUT  

01:37:32.051 --> 01:37:36.519
CONNECTION BETWEEN BURISMA AND 
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT SON.  MR. 

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.720
LUTSENKO ALSO CLAIMED HE NEVER 
RECEIVED $4.4 MILLION IN U.S. 

01:37:38.754 --> 01:37:44.039
FUNDS  INTENDED FOR HIS OFFICE. 
AND THAT THERE WAS A TAPE OF THE

01:37:44.227 --> 01:37:46.133
UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL SAYING THAT 
HE WAS TRYING TO HELP HILLARY 

01:37:46.134 --> 01:37:48.906
CLINTON WIN THE 2016 ELECTION. 
FINALLY, MR. LUTSENKO PUBLICLY 

01:37:49.107 --> 01:37:52.356
CLAIMED  THAT AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH HAD GIVEN HIM  A DO 

01:37:52.628 --> 01:37:58.044
NOT PROSECUTE LIST, CONTAINING 
THE NAMES OF HER SUPPOSED ALLIES

01:37:58.246 --> 01:37:59.877
AND ALLOCATION THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT CALLED AN OUTRIGHT 

01:37:59.878 --> 01:38:04.419
FABRICATION AND THAT MR. 
LUTSENKO LET  LATER RETRACTED. 

01:38:04.615 --> 01:38:07.797
MR. LUTSENKO SAID THAT AS A 
RESULT OF THESE  ALLEGATIONS, 

01:38:07.996 --> 01:38:09.996
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH WOULD 
FACE SERIOUS PROBLEMS  IN THE 

01:38:10.646 --> 01:38:15.389
UNITED STATES. PUBLIC OPINION 
POLLS INDICATED THAT UKRAINIANS 

01:38:15.839 --> 01:38:18.366
GENERALLY DO NOT BELIEVE MR. 
LUTSENKO'S  ALLEGATIONS AND ON 

01:38:21.003 --> 01:38:23.003
MARCH 22nd THE PRESIDENT ISSUED 
A STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF 

01:38:23.038 --> 01:38:25.747
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH.  
FOLLOWING MR. LUTSENKO'S 

01:38:27.704 --> 01:38:29.704
ALLEGATIONS  RICHARD GIULIANI 
AND OTHERS MADE A NUMBER OF 

01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.356
PUBLIC STATEMENTS CRITICAL OF 
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH,  

01:38:31.357 --> 01:38:34.809
QUESTIONING HER INTEGRITY AND 
CALLING FOR HER REMOVAL FROM 

01:38:35.011 --> 01:38:37.011
OFFICE. MR. GIULIANI WAS ALSO 

01:38:40.294 --> 01:38:41.712

2016 ELECTION AND ISSUES RELATED

01:38:43.947 --> 01:38:45.947
TO BURISMA AND  THE 

01:38:48.213 --> 01:38:50.447
BIDENS.  ON EXAMPLE MAY 1st, 
2019 THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED

01:38:50.661 --> 01:38:52.661
THAT MR. GIULIANI 

01:38:54.311 --> 01:38:55.932
HAD "DISCUSSED  THE BURISMA

01:38:55.933 --> 01:38:59.689
INTERSECTION WITH THE BIDENS

01:38:59.878 --> 01:39:01.878
GENERAL AND THE 

01:39:03.865 --> 01:39:05.865
CURRENT PROSECUTOR." ON MAY 9th,
THEN YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT 

01:39:05.884 --> 01:39:08.130
MR. GIULIANI PLANNED TO TRAVEL 
TO UKRAINE TO PURSUE 

01:39:08.331 --> 01:39:10.401
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE 2016 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND INTO 

01:39:10.592 --> 01:39:15.235
THE INVOLVEMENT OF FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE'S SON  AND A 

01:39:15.435 --> 01:39:19.702
UKRAINIAN GAS COMPANY. OVER THE 
NEXT FEW MONTHS MR. GIULIANI 

01:39:19.901 --> 01:39:21.901
ISSUED A SERIES OF TWEETS ASKING

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.240
"WHY BIDEN SHOULD BE 
INVESTIGATED? THE NEW PRESIDENT 

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.958
OF UKRAINE ZELENSKY FOR BEING 
SILENT ON THE 2016 ELECTION  AND

01:39:31.147 --> 01:39:34.525
ABIDE IN INVESTIGATIONS." AND 
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE NEW YORK 

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.740
TIMES ATTACKING HIM FOR 
"EXPOSING THE BIDENS  HISTORY OF

01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:38.762
MAKING MILLIONS FROM 

01:39:40.829 --> 01:39:43.262
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS." AT THIS 
TIME THE UKRAINIAN ELECTION WAS 

01:39:45.912 --> 01:39:49.149
UPCOMING AND ZELENSKY, WHO HAD 
PLAYED IT  PRESIDENT ON 

01:39:49.365 --> 01:39:55.855
TELEVISION, WAS SURGING. AHEAD 
OF LUTSENKO'S ALLY.  ON APRIL 

01:39:56.069 --> 01:39:58.069
20th I WAS PRESENT FOR 
AMBASSADOR 

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.340
YAMADA  AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH'S

01:40:11.904 --> 01:40:13.322
ENTIRELY CORDIAL, PLEASANT 
CONVERSATION THAT SIGNALED A 

01:40:13.323 --> 01:40:15.323
MUTUAL DESIRE TO WORK 

01:40:17.391 --> 01:40:18.810
TOGETHER. HOWEVER, THE NEGATIVE 
NARRATIVES ABOUT AMBASSADOR 

01:40:18.811 --> 01:40:20.643
YOVANOVITCH HAD GAINED CURRENCY 
IN CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE 

01:40:20.644 --> 01:40:22.644
UNITED STATES PRESS .  ON APRIL 
26, AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH 

01:40:22.721 --> 01:40:25.719
DEPARTED FOR WASHINGTON, D.C.  
WHERE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WOULD

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.372
BE RECALLED EARLY. THE PROJECT 
ALLEGATIONS DIRECTED AT 

01:40:29.573 --> 01:40:33.278
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH , A 
CAREER AMBASSADOR, IS UNLIKE 

01:40:33.465 --> 01:40:36.892
ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN IN MY 
PROFESSIONAL CAREER. FOLLOWING 

01:40:39.324 --> 01:40:40.959

01:40:51.312 --> 01:40:53.312
THE POST PERMANENTLY.  IT 
QUICKLY 

01:40:56.994 --> 01:40:59.026
BECAME CLEAR THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE WAS NOT PREPARED TO SHOW 

01:40:59.241 --> 01:41:01.475
THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR THE LOW
ZELENSKY  ADMINISTRATION THAT WE

01:41:02.478 --> 01:41:04.478
INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN EARLY 
MAY MR. GIULIANI PUBLICLY 

01:41:06.548 --> 01:41:08.548
ALLEGED THAT MR. ZELENSKY WAS 
SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES OF THE

PLANNED TO LEAD THE PRESIDENTIAL
DELEGATION TO UKRAINE. THE WHITE

01:41:20.356 --> 01:41:22.592

TAKING A DIRECT ROLE IN 

01:42:29.221 --> 01:42:31.328

OVER THE FOLLOWING MONTHS IT 

01:42:52.786 --> 01:42:55.219

01:42:55.422 --> 01:42:58.674
INFLUENCE ON THE FOREIGN POLICY 
AGENDA THAT THE THREE AMIGOS 

01:42:58.875 --> 01:43:01.927

A VERY PRELIMINARY MEETING OF

RECOLLECTION IS THAT AMBASSADOR

01:44:16.462 --> 01:44:18.293
UNSPECIFIED DATE. IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

WHITE HOUSE VISIT WAS CRITICAL 
TO 

01:44:23.377 --> 01:44:24.997

AND HIS REFORM AGENDA , AND WE 
WORKED HARD TO GET IT ARRANGED.

THE FOCUS OF OUR ACTIVITIES, 

01:45:50.113 --> 01:45:52.158
ALONG WITH THOSE OF THE THREE 
AMIGOS, WAS TO COORDINATE A 

01:45:52.349 --> 01:45:55.799
WHITE HOUSE VISIT. TO THAT END 
WE WERE WORKING WITH UKRAINIANS 

01:45:55.998 --> 01:45:57.630
TO DELIVER THINGS WITHOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT CARE 

01:45:57.631 --> 01:45:59.631
ABOUT, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL DEALS 
TO BENEFIT THE 

01:46:02.701 --> 01:46:04.341

WHAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN 
THE NEXT

THREE MONTHS. I TOOK THAT TO 
MEAN IF WE DO NOT EARN PRESIDENT

01:46:37.845 --> 01:46:39.878
TRUMP'S SUPPORT IN THE NEXT 
THREE MONTHS WE CAN LOSE THE 

01:46:40.079 --> 01:46:42.079
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESS 
DURING PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S 

01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:47.385

THAT  PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WAS NOT
STANDING IN THE WAY OF 

01:47:10.349 --> 01:47:15.420
"INVESTIGATIONS."  I UNDERSTOOD 
THAT THIS MEANT THE 

01:47:15.621 --> 01:47:18.057
BIDEN-BURISMA  INVESTIGATION OF 
MR. GIULIANI AND HIS ASSOCIATES 

01:47:18.472 --> 01:47:20.472
HAS BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT IN THE 
MEDIA SINCE MARCH.

THE THREE AMIGOS, IT WAS MADE 
CLEAR THAT SOME ACTION ON THE 

01:47:36.815 --> 01:47:42.231

SUMMIT AND OSAKA, JAPAN. SENDING

01:47:55.435 --> 01:47:58.085
A FURTHER SIGNAL OF LACK OF 
SUPPORT TO THE UKRAINE. WE 

01:47:58.284 --> 01:48:02.139
BECAME CONCERNED THAT EVEN IF A 
MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT 

01:48:02.339 --> 01:48:06.212
ZELENSKY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WORKER, IT WOULD NOT GO WELL.  

01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:07.936
DISCUSSED WITH EMBASSY 
COLLEAGUES WHETHER WE SHOULD 

01:48:07.937 --> 01:48:09.658
STOP SEEKING A MEETING 
ALTOGETHER. WHILE THE WHITE 

01:48:09.659 --> 01:48:11.659
HOUSE VISIT WAS CRITICAL TO THE 
ZELENSKY 

01:48:14.127 --> 01:48:16.562
ADMINISTRATION , A VISIT TO THE 
FIELD TO SEND A CLEAR AND STRONG

01:48:16.766 --> 01:48:18.795
SIGNAL OF SUPPORT LIKELY WOULD 
BE WORSE FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 

01:48:19.210 --> 01:48:21.210
THE NO VISIT 

01:48:23.879 --> 01:48:26.314
AT ALL. CONGRESS HAS 
APPROPRIATED $1.5 BILLION IN 

01:48:26.515 --> 01:48:30.582
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE 
SINCE 2014. THIS ASSISTANCE HAS 

01:48:31.383 --> 01:48:33.383
PROVIDED CRUCIAL MATERIAL AND 

01:48:35.855 --> 01:48:39.366
MORAL SUPPORT. UKRAINE AND ITS 
DEFENSIVE WAR WITH RUSSIA. IT IS

01:48:39.556 --> 01:48:41.556
HELPED UKRAINE BUILT ITS ARMED 
FORCES VIRTUALLY FROM SCRATCH 

01:48:44.388 --> 01:48:46.388
INTO ARGUABLY THE MOST CAPABLE 
AND BATTLE HARDENED LAND FORCE 

01:48:49.673 --> 01:48:51.906
IN EUROPE. I HAVE HAD THE HONOR 
OF VISITING THE MAIN TRAINING 

01:48:52.106 --> 01:48:54.106
FACILITY IN WESTERN UKRAINE WITH
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND MEMBERS 

01:48:54.139 --> 01:48:59.420

TENNESSEE, AND WISCONSIN, HAVE 

01:49:14.042 --> 01:49:16.042
TRAINED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 
WITH 

01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:19.940
UKRAINIAN COUNTERPARTS. EVEN THE
HISTORY OF U.S. SECURITY

ASSISTANCE TO THE UKRAINE AND 
BIPARTISAN RECOGNITION OF ITS 

01:49:22.377 --> 01:49:24.377
IMPORTANCE, I 

01:49:27.448 --> 01:49:29.682
WAS SHOCKED WHEN ON JULY 18th AN
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET 

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.896
STAFF MEMBERS PRESENTLY 
ANNOUNCED THE HOLD ON UKRAINE 

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:37.820

A NEARLY 2 HOUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL SECURE VIDEO 

01:49:39.637 --> 01:49:41.637

PARTICIPATED IN FROM THE EMBASSY

PRESIDENT AND HAD BEEN CONVEYED 
BY MR. MULVANEY, WITH NO FURTHER

01:49:49.387 --> 01:49:53.251
EXPLANATION. THIS BEGAN A WEEK 
OR SO OF EFFORTS BY VARIOUS 

01:49:53.451 --> 01:49:56.090
AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY THE 
RATIONALE FOR THE FREEZE, TO 

01:49:56.301 --> 01:49:59.338
CONDUCT A REVIEW OF THE 
ASSISTANCE, AND TO REAFFIRM THE 

01:50:00.971 --> 01:50:02.971
UNANIMOUS VIEW OF UKRAINE POLICY
COMMUNITY OF 

01:50:05.438 --> 01:50:07.438
ITS IMPORTANCE. NFC COUNTERPARTS
CONFIRM TO US THAT THERE HAD 

01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:10.521
BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR UKRAINIAN 
POLICY, BUT CANNOT DETERMINE THE

01:50:10.721 --> 01:50:17.423
CAUSE OF THE HOLD OR HOW TO LIFT
IT. ON JULY 25th, PRESIDENT 

01:50:17.624 --> 01:50:19.624
TRUMP MADE A CONGRATULATORY 
PHONE CALL TO PRESIDENT 

01:50:22.496 --> 01:50:24.496
ZELENSKY.  AFTER HIS PARTY WON A
COMMANDING MAJORITY AND 

01:50:24.527 --> 01:50:27.377

ELECTION. CONTRARY TO STANDARD 

01:50:27.582 --> 01:50:30.015
PROCEDURE, THE EMBASSY RECEIVED 
NO READOUT OF THE CALL AND I WAS

01:50:30.215 --> 01:50:32.457

01:50:33.065 --> 01:50:37.332
RELEASED ON THE 25th. UPON 
READING THE TRANSCRIPT, I WAS 

01:50:38.135 --> 01:50:40.985
DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE 
PRESIDENT RAISED NONE OF WHAT I 

01:50:41.429 --> 01:50:43.429
UNDERSTOOD TO 

01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:47.083

TO PREPARE FOR A BROADER MEETING
SUBSEQUENTLY.  BUT HE DID SAY

01:53:12.715 --> 01:53:15.375
I SHOULD JOIN.  THE FOUR OF US 
WENT TO A NEARBY RESTAURANT AND 

01:53:15.568 --> 01:53:18.181
SAT ON AN OUTDOOR TERRACE. I SAT
DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM AMBASSADOR 

01:53:20.036 --> 01:53:22.485
SONDLAND  AND THE TWO STAFFERS 
SET OFF TO OUR SIDE. AT FIRST 

01:53:25.307 --> 01:53:26.939
THE LORD LUNCH WAS LARGELY 
SOCIAL, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.574
SELECTED A BOTTLE OF WINE  THAT 
WE SHARED AMONG THE FOUR OF US

HE WOULD CALL  PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TO GIVE HIM AN UPDATE.  

01:53:39.328 --> 01:53:41.561
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND PLACED A 
CALL ON HIS MOBILE PHONE  AND I 

01:53:41.762 --> 01:53:43.762
HEARD HIM ANNOUNCE HIMSELF 
SEVERAL TIMES ALONG THE LINES OF

01:53:44.413 --> 01:53:47.702
GORDON SONDLAND HOLDING FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. IT APPEARED HE WAS 

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.880
BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH 
SEVERAL LAYERS OF SWITCHBOARDS 

01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:54.530
AND ASSISTANCE,  I THEN NOTICED 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S DEMEANOR 

01:53:54.967 --> 01:53:56.967
CHANGED.  I UNDERSTOOD HE HAD 
BEEN CONNECTED TO PRESIDENT 

01:53:58.219 --> 01:54:01.873
TRUMP.  WHILE AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND'S PHONE  WAS NOT ON 

01:54:02.072 --> 01:54:04.072
SPEAKERPHONE I COULD HEAR THE 
PRESIDENTS VOICE THROUGH THE 

01:54:04.106 --> 01:54:10.057
EARPIECE. THE PRESIDENTS VOICE 
WAS LOUD, AND RECOGNIZABLE. AND 

01:54:10.252 --> 01:54:12.252
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND HELD THE 
PHONE AWAY FROM HIS EAR FOR A 

01:54:12.438 --> 01:54:14.438
PERIOD OF TIME  PRESUMABLY 
BECAUSE OF THE 

01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:18.910
LOUD VOLUME. I HEARD AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND GREET THE PRESIDENT AND

01:54:18.942 --> 01:54:20.981
EXPLAINED HE WAS CALLING FROM 
KIEV.  I HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP 

01:54:21.176 --> 01:54:23.610
CLARIFIED THAT AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND  WAS IN UKRAINE. 

01:54:23.811 --> 01:54:26.043
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND REPLIED THAT
HE WAS IN UKRAINE  AND WENT ON 

01:54:26.245 --> 01:54:33.965
TO STATE THAT PRESENT ZELENSKY 
"LOVES YOUR  ASS." I THEN HEARD 

01:54:34.166 --> 01:54:36.815
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED, SO IS 
GOING TO DO THE INVESTIGATION? 

01:54:37.016 --> 01:54:39.249
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND REPLIED HE 
IS GOING TO DO IT ADDING THAT  

01:54:39.451 --> 01:54:41.451
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WILL DO 
ANYTHING YOU ASK HIM TO 

01:54:44.122 --> 01:54:46.971
DO.  EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT TAKE 
NOTES OF THE STATEMENTS, I HAD A

01:54:47.172 --> 01:54:49.172
CLEAR RECOLLECTION THAT THE 
STATEMENTS WERE MADE. I HAD A 

01:54:49.206 --> 01:54:51.206
BELIEVE THAT MY 

01:54:52.655 --> 01:54:54.655
COLLEAGUES WHO WERE AT THE TABLE
ALSO KNEW THAT AMBASSADOR 

01:54:54.755 --> 01:54:56.755
SONDLAND WAS SPEAKING WITH THE 

01:54:58.754 --> 01:55:00.391
PRESIDENT.  THE CONVERSATION 
THEN SHIFTED TO AMBASSADOR 

01:55:00.392 --> 01:55:04.640
SONDLAND'S EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF 
THE PRESIDENT, TO ASSIST A  

01:55:04.916 --> 01:55:07.073
RAPPER WHO WAS JAILED IN SWEDEN 
AND I CAN ONLY HEAR THE 

01:55:07.274 --> 01:55:08.504
INVESTORS OUTSIDE OF THE 
CONVERSATION. AMBASSADOR 

01:55:08.505 --> 01:55:13.977
SONDLAND TOLD THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE WRAPPER WAS " KIND OF EFFED 

01:55:14.192 --> 01:55:16.704
THERE" AND SHOULD HAVE PLED 
GUILTY, HE RECOMMENDED THAT THE 

01:55:19.066 --> 01:55:21.097
PRESIDENT'S " WAIT UNTIL AFTER 
THE STATEMENT, AND SAID THAT THE

01:55:21.297 --> 01:55:25.795
PRESIDENT SHOULD LET HIM GET 
SENTENCED, PLAY THE RACISM CARD 

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:28.003
AND GIVE ME TICKERTAPE WHEN HE 
COMES HOME." AMBASSADOR SONDLAND

01:55:28.203 --> 01:55:30.238
FOR THE TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT 
SWEDEN " SHOULD HAVE RELEASED 

01:55:30.439 --> 01:55:33.905
HIM ON YOUR WORD, BUT THAT YOU 
CAN TELL THE 

01:55:38.903 --> 01:55:40.715
KARDASHIAN STRIDE." AFTER THE 
CALL ENDED, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

01:55:40.716 --> 01:55:42.846
REMARKED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
IN A BAD MOOD  AS AMBASSADOR 

01:55:43.035 --> 01:55:47.913
SONDLAND STAYED WAS OFTEN THE 
CASE EARLY IN THE MORNING.  I 

01:55:48.114 --> 01:55:50.114
THEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND FOR HIS 

01:55:50.161 --> 01:55:52.802
CANDID IMPRESSION OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S VIEWS  ON UKRAINE, 

01:55:52.996 --> 01:55:55.217
IN PARTICULAR I ASKED AMBASSADOR
SONDLAND IF IT WAS TRUE THAT THE

01:55:55.416 --> 01:55:57.416
PRESIDENT  DID NOT GIVE AN 
EXPLETIVE 

01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:01.518
ABOUT UKRAINE. AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND AGREED THAT THE 

01:56:01.519 --> 01:56:03.519
PRESIDENT DID NOT GIVE AN 
EXPLETIVE ABOUT UKRAINE.  I 

01:56:03.553 --> 01:56:06.188
ASKED WHY NOT? AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND STATED THAT THE 

01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:11.260
PRESIDENT ONLY CARES ABOUT BIG 
STUFF . I NOTED THERE WAS BIG 

01:56:11.532 --> 01:56:13.910
STUFF GOING ON IN UKRAINE, LIKE 
A WAR WITH RUSSIA. AMBASSADOR 

01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:16.957
SONDLAND REPLIED THAT HE MEANT A
BIG STUFF  THAT BENEFITS THE 

01:56:17.159 --> 01:56:19.392
PRESIDENT, LIKE THE BIDEN 
INVESTIGATION THAT MR. GIULIANI 

01:56:22.238 --> 01:56:25.893
WAS PUSHING. THE CONVERSATION 
THEN MOVED ON TO OTHER TOPICS. 

01:56:26.092 --> 01:56:29.142
UPON RETURNING TO THE EMBASSY I 
IMMEDIATELY BRIEFED MY DIRECT 

01:56:29.342 --> 01:56:31.776
SUPERVISOR, THE DEPUTY CHIEF 
ABOUT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S CALL

01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:38.681
WITH  PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MY 
SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION WITH 

01:56:38.682 --> 01:56:40.682
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND. I TOLD 
OTHERS AT THE EMBASSY ABOUT THE 

01:56:40.714 --> 01:56:42.949
CALL AS WELL.  I ALSO EMAILED AN
EMPTY OFFICIAL IN SWEDEN 

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:46.581
REGARDING THE ISSUE WITH THE 
U.S. RAPPER THAT WAS DISCUSSED 

01:56:46.613 --> 01:56:50.465
ON THE CALL.  JULY 26 WAS MY 
LAST DAY IN THE OFFICE AHEAD OF 

01:56:50.666 --> 01:56:52.666
A LONG PLANNED VACATION THAT 
ENDED ON 

01:56:55.749 --> 01:56:57.863

CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ISSUE OF 
THE PRESIDENTS ISSUE INTEREST IN

01:57:07.789 --> 01:57:11.189
UKRAINE WAS RELEVANT. AT THAT 
TIME, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S 

01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:14.842
STATEMENT OF THE  PRESENT LACK 
OF INTEREST IN UKRAINE WAS A 

01:57:19.313 --> 01:57:21.146
PARTICULAR FOCUS. WE UNDERSTOOD 
TO SECURE A MEETING BETWEEN 

01:57:21.147 --> 01:57:25.612
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY,  WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK

01:57:25.813 --> 01:57:27.813
HARD TO FIND A WAY TO EXPLAIN 
UKRAINE'S IMPORTANCE TO 

01:57:27.846 --> 01:57:29.846
PRESIDENT 

01:57:31.699 --> 01:57:33.933
TRUMP . OVER THE ENSUING WEEKS, 
WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO IDENTIFIED

01:57:34.146 --> 01:57:36.167
WAYS TO FRAME THE IMPORTANCE OF 
UKRAINE IN WAYS THAT WOULD 

01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:38.816
APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENTS. 
DETERMINED HOW TO LIFT THE HOLD 

01:57:39.017 --> 01:57:42.125
ON SECURITY SYSTEMS, AND MOVE 
FORWARD ON THE SCHEDULING IN THE

01:57:42.317 --> 01:57:44.317

01:57:48.366 --> 01:57:52.018

01:57:56.085 --> 01:57:58.085

AND MADDEN IN 2017 BUT NO ONE 
SENIOR TO AMBASSADOR VOLKER  

01:58:04.205 --> 01:58:07.052
ATTENDED. SHORTLY THEREAFTER ON 
AUGUST 27th, AMBASSADOR BOLTON 

01:58:07.253 --> 01:58:11.520
VISITED THE UKRAINE. AND BROUGHT
WELCOME NEWS THAT PRESIDENT 

01:58:11.722 --> 01:58:13.540

FURTHER INDICATED THE HOLD ON 

01:58:21.263 --> 01:58:23.263
SECURITY ASSISTANCE WILL NOT BE 
LIFTED PRIOR TO THE WARSAW 

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:25.296
MEETING WHERE IT WOULD HANG ON 
WHETHER OR NOT PRESIDENT 

01:58:25.329 --> 01:58:27.563
ZELENSKY WAS ABLE TO " FAVORABLY
IMPRESSED PRESIDENT TRUMP."  I 

01:58:30.414 --> 01:58:32.230
TOOK NOTES AT AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON'S MEETINGS THAT DAY WITH 

01:58:32.231 --> 01:58:34.665
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND CHIEF OF 
STAFF.  AMBASSADOR BOLTON TOLD 

01:58:34.879 --> 01:58:37.714
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY THAT THE 
MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT  

01:58:37.928 --> 01:58:41.047
IN WARSAW WOULD BE CRUCIAL TO 
CEMENTING THE RELATIONSHIP. 

01:58:41.243 --> 01:58:42.800
HOWEVER, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ULTIMATELY PULLED OUT OF THE 

01:58:42.801 --> 01:58:44.801
WARSAW TRIP  

01:58:46.549 --> 01:58:51.663
BEHOLD THE HOLD REMAINED IN 
PLACE WITH NO CLEAR MEANS TO GET

01:58:51.852 --> 01:58:53.183

MORRISON ABOUT HIS FRUSTRATION 
WITH GIULIANI'S INFLUENCE ON THE

01:59:04.325 --> 01:59:06.561
PRESIDENT MAKING CLEAR THERE WAS
NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT. HE

01:59:06.761 --> 01:59:07.977
RECOMMENDED THAT LUTSENKO'S 
REPLACEMENT AS PROSECUTOR 

01:59:07.978 --> 01:59:10.555
GENERAL  OPEN THE CHANNEL WITH 
HIS COUNTERPART, ATTORNEY 

01:59:11.845 --> 01:59:14.279

ANDRIY YERMAK AND MR. 

01:59:20.108 --> 01:59:21.995
GIULIANI.  AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
ALSO EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION ABOUT

01:59:21.996 --> 01:59:23.996
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S 
INTERPRETATION OF HIS MANDATE. 

02:00:27.832 --> 02:00:29.462
ALTHOUGH BOTH CENTERS STRESSED 
STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR 

02:00:29.463 --> 02:00:31.463
UKRAINE, SENATOR JOHNSON

02:00:50.157 --> 02:00:51.786
CAUTIONED PRESIDENT ZELENSKY 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A 

02:00:51.787 --> 02:00:53.605
NEGATIVE VIEW OF UKRAINE AND 
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WOULD 

02:00:53.606 --> 02:00:55.436
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME OVERCOMING
IT. CENTER JOHNSON EXPLAINED 

02:00:55.437 --> 02:00:57.673
THAT HE HAD BEEN SHOCKED BY THE 
NEGATIVE REACTION DURING AN OVAL

02:00:57.876 --> 02:01:00.179
OFFICE MEETING ON MAY 23 WHEN HE
AND THE THREE AMIGOS PROPOSED 

02:01:00.355 --> 02:01:02.142
THAT THEY MEET PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND SHOW SUPPORT FOR 

02:01:02.143 --> 02:01:04.377
UKRAINE.  ON SEPTEMBER 8, AND 
BESSER TAYLOR SAID THEY ARE NOW 

02:01:04.577 --> 02:01:07.026
INSISTING THAT PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  SUBMITS TO THE 

02:01:07.230 --> 02:01:09.660
INTERVIEW FOR CNN. I WAS SHOCKED
THAT IT WAS SO SPECIFIC AND 

02:01:09.861 --> 02:01:13.114
CONCRETE. WE ADVISE OUR 
COUNTERPARTS TO FOLLOW THE RULE 

02:01:13.878 --> 02:01:22.256
OF LAW, THIS WAS A DEMAND THAT 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  HAD TO 

02:01:23.015 --> 02:01:25.015
COMMIT TO

02:01:27.742 --> 02:01:29.913
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLITICAL 
RIVAL IN ON SEPTEMBER 11,

02:01:35.451 --> 02:01:37.282
THE HOLD WAS FINALLY LIFTED 
AFTER SIGNIFICANT PRESS COVERAGE

02:01:37.283 --> 02:01:39.610
AND EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT
THE WITHHOLDING OF ASSISTANCE. 

02:01:39.933 --> 02:01:43.171
WE KNEW THE HOLD WAS LIFTED BUT 
WE WERE STILL CONCERNED THAT HE 

02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:48.859
HAD COMMITTED IN EXCHANGE FOR 
THE LIFTING, AND INTERVIEW. 

02:01:49.275 --> 02:01:52.226
THERE WAS THE ASK CONFERENCE 
THAT WAS HELD

02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:02.671
IN SECOND ONSET 13, THE EMBASSY 
COLLEAGUE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL 

02:02:02.883 --> 02:02:08.357
THAT WORKED FOR THE AMBASSADOR 
AND MY COLLEAGUE TEXTED ME 

02:02:08.572 --> 02:02:10.572
REGARDING THAT CALL THAT SAID 
THE

02:02:16.083 --> 02:02:21.566
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY INTERVIEW WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE  TODAY. THEY DID 

02:02:21.766 --> 02:02:23.766
NOT KNOW IF THIS WAS DECIDED

02:02:27.052 --> 02:02:30.421
OR IF HE WAS ADVOCATING FOR 
THAT. FINALLY, ALSO, WE RAN INTO

02:02:36.596 --> 02:02:46.351
OTHERS AND THEY SAID STAYING OUT
OF POLITICS. THEY SHRUGGED AS IF

02:02:46.552 --> 02:02:50.620
TO INDICATE THAT HE HAD NO 
CHOICE. IN SHORT, EVERYONE 

02:02:50.821 --> 02:02:52.998
THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE AN 
INTERVIEW AND THAT THE 

02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:55.180
UKRAINIANS

02:02:58.743 --> 02:03:01.178
THOUGHT THEY HAD TO DO IT BUT 
THE INTERVIEW DID NOT OCCUR. ON 

02:03:01.379 --> 02:03:03.379
THE 21st, THEY COLLABORATED ON 
INPUT TO BRIEF PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:03:03.414 --> 02:03:05.414
AHEAD OF THE

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:12.753

02:03:14.986 --> 02:03:18.794
DAY. AS OF TODAY, I HAVE STILL 
NOT SEEN A REACTION OF THIS 

02:03:18.972 --> 02:03:20.972
MEETING.

02:03:24.124 --> 02:03:26.439
AS THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HAS 
PROGRESSED, I HAVE FOLLOWED 

02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:29.110
PRESS REPORTS

02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:34.301
AND BASED ON MY EXPERIENCES, MY 
RECOLLECTION IS CONSISTENT WITH 

02:03:35.053 --> 02:03:37.053
THEIR TESTIMONY AND I BELIEVE

02:03:47.282 --> 02:03:49.517
THE FACTS WERE LAID OUT FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. HOWEVER, I READ

02:03:49.721 --> 02:03:51.721
PRESS REPORTS EXPRESSING FOR THE
FIRST TIME THAT CERTAIN SENIOR 

02:03:51.751 --> 02:03:55.619
OFFICIALS MAY HAVE BEEN ACTING 
WITHOUT THE PRESENCE KNOWLEDGE 

02:03:56.021 --> 02:03:58.054
OR FREELANCING IN THEIR DEALINGS
WITH UKRAINE. AT THE SAME TIME, 

02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:00.997
I ALSO READ REPORTS WITH THE 
LACK OF FIRST-HAND EVIDENCE IN 

02:04:01.178 --> 02:04:04.758
SUGGESTING THAT THE ONLY 
EVIDENCE WAS HEARSAY. I CAME TO 

02:04:04.957 --> 02:04:09.426
REALIZE THAT I HAD FIRST-HAND 
KNOWLEDGE THAT HAD NOT OTHERWISE

02:04:09.627 --> 02:04:11.627
BEEN REPORTED. THAT THOSE EVENTS

02:04:15.115 --> 02:04:17.147
HAD A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT DID IN FACT HAVE 

02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:19.718
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SENIOR 
OFFICIALS WERE USING DIPLOMATIC 

02:04:19.895 --> 02:04:21.895
POWER

02:04:26.490 --> 02:04:28.323
TO ANNOUNCE THE OPENING OF A 
KERNEL INVESTIGATION AGAINST 

02:04:28.324 --> 02:04:30.141
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLITICAL 
OPPONENT. IT IS AT THAT POINT 

02:04:30.142 --> 02:04:35.014
THAT I MAY BE OBSERVATION JIM 
BESSER TAYLOR THAT THIS HAD 

02:04:35.230 --> 02:04:40.098
REQUIRED GREATER SIGNIFICANCE 
WHICH IS WHAT HE REPORTED IN HIS

02:04:40.299 --> 02:04:42.733
TESTIMONY LAST WEEK AND WHAT LED
TO THE SUBPOENA FOR ME TO APPEAR

02:04:43.497 --> 02:04:48.626
HERE TODAY. IN CONCLUSION, I 
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO 

02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:54.639
TURN BACK TO UKRAINE. TODAY, 
THIS VERY DAY IS EXACTLY 6 YEARS

02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:03.050
WHEN THEY SPONTANEOUSLY GATHERED
TO LAUNCH WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS A

02:05:03.253 --> 02:05:07.237
REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY. THE 
PROTEST BEGAN IN OPPOSITION

02:05:11.377 --> 02:05:13.377
BUT THEY EXPANDED OVER THREE 
MONTHS

02:05:16.451 --> 02:05:21.934
FOR THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM THAT 
HAD BEEN SUSTAINED. THOSE EVENTS

02:05:22.150 --> 02:05:25.736
WERE FOLLOWED BY THE OCCUPATION 
AND INVASION

02:05:30.884 --> 02:05:35.748
AND ENSUING WAR THAT HAS CAUSED 
THE MOST 15,000 LINES. DESPITE 

02:05:35.964 --> 02:05:42.665
THE RUSSIAN AGGRESSION, 
UKRAINIANS HAVE REBUILT AN 

02:05:42.865 --> 02:05:46.647
ECONOMY AND MOVED ECONOMICALLY 
AND CLOSER TO THE WEST

02:05:50.375 --> 02:05:53.426
TOWARD OUR WAY OF LIFE. EARLIER 
THIS YEAR, UKRAINIANS SHOWS A 

02:05:54.187 --> 02:05:56.187
FRESH START

02:05:58.711 --> 02:06:00.528
BY VOTING FOR A POLITICAL 
NEWCOMER FOR PRESIDENT IN 

02:06:00.529 --> 02:06:03.177
REPLACING 80% OF THEIR 
PARLIAMENT AND ENDORSING A 

02:06:03.378 --> 02:06:05.767
PLATFORM CONSISTENT WITH THE 
DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND REFORM 

02:06:05.942 --> 02:06:11.298
PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIC 
INTERESTS. THIS YEAR'S 

02:06:12.061 --> 02:06:16.787
REVOLUTION UNDERSCORES AND 
DESPITE ITS IMPERFECTIONS, THIS 

02:06:16.987 --> 02:06:21.056
IS A GENUINE AND VIBRANT 
DEMOCRACY AN EXAMPLE TO OTHER 

02:06:21.256 --> 02:06:24.617
POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES AND BEYOND
FROM MOSCOW TO HONG KONG.

02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:34.629
HOW WE RESPOND TO THIS HISTORIC 
OPPORTUNITY WILL SEND THE 

02:06:34.662 --> 02:06:36.482
TRAJECTORY OF OUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH UKRAINE AND DEFINE AGONIST 

02:06:36.483 --> 02:06:39.132
TO DEFEND OUR PRINCIPLES AND 
LEADERSHIP ROLE. UKRAINIANS WANT

02:06:39.332 --> 02:06:41.332
TO HEAR A CLEAR AND

02:06:45.223 --> 02:06:46.439
UNAMBIGUOUS REAFFIRMATION THAT 
THE LONG-STANDING BIPARTISAN 

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.440
POLICY HAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR 
UKRAINE THAT

02:06:52.946 --> 02:06:55.564
REMAINS UNCHANGED AND WE FULLY 
BACK IT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

02:06:59.233 --> 02:07:01.467
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO RETREAT 
FROM A RELATIONSHIP WITH UKRAINE

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.149
BUT RATHER TO DOUBLE DOWN ON IT.
AS WE SIT HERE TODAY, UKRAINIANS

02:07:06.378 --> 02:07:09.733
ARE FIGHTING A HOT WAR AGAINST 
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION IN THIS WEEK 

02:07:09.905 --> 02:07:15.899
ALONE SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE IN 
WASHINGTON, TWO UKRAINE SOLDIERS

02:07:16.652 --> 02:07:18.652
WERE KILLED

02:07:20.767 --> 02:07:22.601
DESPITE A DECLARED CEASE-FIRE. I
LEARNED OVERNIGHT THAT SEVEN 

02:07:22.602 --> 02:07:26.680
MORE WERE INJURED YESTERDAY. 
VICE PRESIDENT PENN SAID AFTER 

02:07:26.868 --> 02:07:29.625
HIS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY  THAT THE UKRAINE

02:07:35.807 --> 02:07:37.426
RELATIONSHIP HAS NEVER BEEN 
STRONGER. UKRAINIANS IN THEIR 

02:07:37.427 --> 02:07:39.713
NEW GOVERNMENT EARNESTLY WANT TO
BELIEVE THAT. UKRAINIANS CHAIRS 

02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:47.983
AMERICAN SUPPORT AND THEY RECOIL
AT THE THOUGHT OF PLAYING A ROLE

02:07:48.197 --> 02:07:52.813
IN DOMESTIC POLITICS OR 
ELECTIONS. THE TIME OF SHIFTING 

02:07:52.989 --> 02:07:59.168
ALLEGIANCES, WE HAVE NO BETTER 
FRIENDS THAN UKRAINE. SCRAPPY 

02:07:59.365 --> 02:08:01.365
AND AM BOUND AND DETERMINED

02:08:04.650 --> 02:08:06.650
AND ABOVE ALL, DIGNIFIED PEOPLE 
WHO ARE STANDING UP AGAINST 

02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:10.454
RUSSIAN AUTHORITARIANS WITH 
AGGRESSION. THEY DESERVE BETTER.

02:08:13.172 --> 02:08:17.038
WE ARE NOW TO A POINT THAT IS 
CRITICAL TO STAND IN STRONG 

02:08:17.239 --> 02:08:19.239
SUPPORT OF OUR PARTNERS.

02:08:22.108 --> 02:08:23.738
UKRAINIANS AND FREEDOM LOVING 
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE ARE WATCHING 

02:08:23.739 --> 02:08:27.310
THE EXAMPLE WE SET HERE WITH THE
RULE OF LAW. THANK YOU.

02:08:34.103 --> 02:08:42.735
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU  DR. HOLMES. DR. 
HILL. IS THE MICROPHONE ON?

02:08:45.263 --> 02:08:47.829
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT IS NOW. THANK 
YOU AGAIN  MR. CHAIRMAN.

02:08:51.968 --> 02:08:57.054
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO 
TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. I HAVE

02:08:57.256 --> 02:08:59.256
A SHORT OPENING STATEMENT. I 
APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

02:08:59.688 --> 02:09:02.083
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND I AM 
APPEARING TODAY AS A FACT 

02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:09.039
WITNESS AS I DID DURING MY 
DEPOSITION ON OCTOBER 14. TO 

02:09:09.239 --> 02:09:11.875
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT
I SAW AND WHAT I DID AND WHAT I 

02:09:12.085 --> 02:09:15.044
KNEW AND WHAT I KNOW WITH REGARD
TO THE SUBJECTS OF YOUR INQUIRY.

02:09:15.945 --> 02:09:17.945
I BELIEVE THAT THOSE THAT HAVE 
INFORMATION

02:09:22.845 --> 02:09:25.843
, I HAVE A LEGAL AND MORAL 
OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE IT. I TAKE

02:09:26.026 --> 02:09:29.345
GREAT PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT I'M
A FOREIGN POLICY EXPERT THAT 

02:09:29.544 --> 02:09:31.544
SERVED UNDER THREE REPUBLICANS

02:09:35.244 --> 02:09:37.062
AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS. I 
HAVE NO INTEREST IN ADVANCING 

02:09:37.063 --> 02:09:39.096
AND OUTCOME IN ANY PARTICULAR 
DIRECTION EXCEPT TOWARDS THE 

02:09:39.297 --> 02:09:41.297
TRUTH. I WILL NOT

02:09:46.003 --> 02:09:48.003
PROVIDE A LONG STATEMENT BECAUSE
I BELIEVE THE INTEREST OF 

02:09:48.035 --> 02:09:50.070
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
IS BEST SERVED BY ALLOWING YOU 

02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:52.835
TO ASK ME YOUR QUESTIONS. I'M 
HAPPY TO EXPAND UPON MY

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:07.329
POSITION TESTIMONY IN RESPONSE 
TO YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY BUT 

02:10:07.330 --> 02:10:09.767
BEFORE I DO SO, I WOULD LIKE TO 
COMMUNICATE TWO THINGS, FIRST, I

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:12.818
WOULD LIKE TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT WHO I AM. I AM AN AMERICAN

02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:15.685
BY CHOICE. I BECAME A CITIZEN IN
2002 AND I WAS BORN IN ENGLAND 

02:10:15.869 --> 02:10:17.687
IN THE SAME REGION THAT GEORGE 
WASHINGTON'S ANCESTORS CAME 

02:10:17.688 --> 02:10:19.924
FROM. BOTH MY REGION AND MY 
FAMILY HAD DEEP TIES TO THE 

02:10:20.126 --> 02:10:22.126
UNITED STATES. MY GRANDFATHER 
FOUGHT THROUGH WORLD WAR I 

02:10:22.515 --> 02:10:24.515
SURVIVING BEING SHOT

02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.580
IN 1918.

02:10:31.712 --> 02:10:33.712
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, 
OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY 

02:10:33.732 --> 02:10:39.269
FOUGHT TO DEFEND THE FREE WORLD 
FROM FASCISM. THE MEN IN MY 

02:10:39.577 --> 02:10:41.987
FATHER'S FAMILY WERE CO-MINORS.

02:10:46.734 --> 02:10:48.968
WHEN MY FATHER WAS 14, HE JOINED
HIS FATHER AND BROTHERS AND 

02:10:49.170 --> 02:10:53.158
UNCLES AND COUSINS TO HELP PUT 
FOOD ON THE TABLE.

02:10:56.894 --> 02:10:59.124
WHEN THE LAST OF THE LOCAL MINES
CLOSED, MY FATHER WANTED TO 

02:10:59.337 --> 02:11:01.655
IMMIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES 
TO WORK IN THE COMMONS IN WEST 

02:11:01.846 --> 02:11:03.846
VIRGINIA AND PENNSYLVANIA WITH 
HIS MOTHER,

02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:11.727
MY GRANDMA HAD BEEN CRIPPLED AND
MY FATHER COULD NOT LEAVE SO HE 

02:11:11.928 --> 02:11:16.599
STAYED UNTIL HE DIED IN 2012. 
WHILE HIS TREATMENT IMMIGRATING,

02:11:16.798 --> 02:11:21.266
THEY HAVE THE CULTURE AND THE 
HISTORY AND IT HAD A BEACON OF 

02:11:21.467 --> 02:11:25.079
HOPE FOR THE WORLD. HE ALWAYS 
WANTED TO MAKE IT TO THE UNITED 

02:11:25.261 --> 02:11:31.425
STATES. I BEGAN MY STUDIES IN 
1984 AND I WENT TO THE SAME 

02:11:32.186 --> 02:11:34.596
UNIVERSITY AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE,
MR. HOLMES.

02:11:38.328 --> 02:11:41.937
IN 1987, I WON A PLACE AT THE 
SOVIET UNION AND I WAS THEREFORE

02:11:42.110 --> 02:11:48.898
THE NUCLEAR FORCES AND WHEN 
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN MET IN 

02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.110
MOSCOW. THIS IS A TURNING POINT 
FOR ME

02:11:56.404 --> 02:11:58.404
IN AN AMERICAN PROFESSOR TOLD ME
ABOUT STUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS TO 

02:11:58.437 --> 02:12:00.671
THE UNITED STATES IN THE NEXT 
YEAR THANKS TO HIS ADVICE, I 

02:12:00.873 --> 02:12:03.931
WENT TO AMERICA. YEARS LATER, I 
CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT 

02:12:04.692 --> 02:12:07.582
THIS COUNTRY HAS OFFERED ME 
OPPORTUNITIES I NEVER WOULD HAVE

02:12:07.783 --> 02:12:11.771
HAD IN ENGLAND. I GREW UP POOR 
WITH THE DISTINCTIVE

02:12:16.522 --> 02:12:18.758
ACCENT AND THIS WOULD'VE IMPEDED
MY ADVANCEMENT. IT HAS NEVER SET

02:12:19.516 --> 02:12:21.516
ME BACK

02:12:25.867 --> 02:12:28.100
IN AMERICA AND FOR THE BETTER 
PART OF THREE DECADES, I HAVE 

02:12:28.301 --> 02:12:30.334
BUILT A CAREER AS AN OPTICAL 
NATIONAL SECURITY PROFESSIONAL 

02:12:30.535 --> 02:12:33.927
FOCUSING ON THE SOVIET UNION. I 
SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN MIRO'S 

02:12:34.099 --> 02:12:36.099
RECENT

02:12:40.089 --> 02:12:42.089
WITH NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

02:12:47.396 --> 02:12:49.428
UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 
AND BARACK OBAMA. I WAS THE 

02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:53.898
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SENIOR 
EXPERT. IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY 

02:12:54.097 --> 02:12:57.293
BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE THAT I
WAS ASKED TO JOIN THE SECURITY 

02:12:57.465 --> 02:13:04.866
COUNCIL AND AT THE NFC, RUSSIA 
WAS PART OF MY PORTFOLIO BUT I 

02:13:05.067 --> 02:13:06.898
WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR 
COORDINATING U. S. POLICY FOR 

02:13:06.899 --> 02:13:10.579
WESTERN EUROPE AND EASTERN 
EUROPE AND TURKEY ALONG WITH 

02:13:10.752 --> 02:13:15.749
NATO AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. I 
WAS HIRED BY MICHAEL FLYNN

02:13:19.289 --> 02:13:23.756
BUT THEN I STARTED WORKING APRIL
2017 WHEN McMASTER WAS THE 

02:13:24.514 --> 02:13:26.923
SECURITY ADVISOR. I THOUGHT I 
COULD HELP THEM

02:13:31.275 --> 02:13:33.094
WITH THE STATED GOAL OF 
IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 

02:13:33.095 --> 02:13:35.730
WHILE STILL IN LENDING POLICIES 
DESIGNED THAT COULD THREATEN THE

02:13:35.946 --> 02:13:41.216
UNITED STATES INCLUDING THE 
SUCCESSFUL RUSSIAN OPERATION TO 

02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:46.098
INTERFERE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. THIS IS THE SECOND 

02:13:46.297 --> 02:13:50.165
THING I WANTED TO COMMUNICATE. 
BASED ON QUESTIONS AND 

02:13:50.366 --> 02:13:52.601
STATEMENTS I HAVE HEARD, SOME OF
YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE YOU 

02:13:52.803 --> 02:13:55.852
TO BELIEVE THAT SECURITY 
SERVICES DID NOT COME AGAINST 

02:13:56.610 --> 02:14:01.126
OUR COUNTRY AND PERHAPS SOMEHOW 
FOR SOME REASON, UKRAINE DID. 

02:14:01.529 --> 02:14:06.412
THIS IS A FICTIONAL NARRATIVE 
THAT IS BEING PERPETRATED BY THE

02:14:06.614 --> 02:14:10.066
RUSSIAN SECURITY THEMSELVES. THE
UNFORTUNATE TRUTH IS THAT RUSSIA

02:14:10.265 --> 02:14:12.265
WAS THE FOREIGN POWER

02:14:15.147 --> 02:14:17.179
THAT ATTACKED OUR INSTITUTIONS 
IN 2016 AND THIS IS A PUBLIC 

02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:19.380
CONCLUSION OF OUR INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES

02:14:23.068 --> 02:14:25.875
AND IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE. EVEN 
IF SOME OF THE UNDERLYING 

02:14:26.116 --> 02:14:28.116
DETAILS REMAIN CLASSIFIED.

02:14:30.583 --> 02:14:33.124
THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN REMAINS 
WHAT IT IS TODAY IN OUR NATION

02:14:37.284 --> 02:14:39.284
WITH A HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL 
EXPERT SERVICE IS BEING 

02:14:39.446 --> 02:14:45.941
UNDERMINED. THEY CONTINUE TO 
HAVE IT POLITICIZE.

02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:56.781
THE GOAL IS TO WEAKEN OUR 
COUNTRY AND DIMINISH THE GLOBAL 

02:14:56.983 --> 02:14:58.814
ROLE AND TO NEUTRALIZE A 
PERCEIVED THREAT TO RUSSIAN 

02:14:58.815 --> 02:15:00.647
INTERESTS. PRESIDENT PUTIN AND 
THE SECURITY SERVICES IN THE 

02:15:00.648 --> 02:15:04.748
FORM POLICY OBJECTIVES WHERE 
MOSCOW WISHES TO REASSERT 

02:15:05.469 --> 02:15:07.469
POLITICAL DOMINANCE.

02:15:09.374 --> 02:15:11.824
I SAY THIS AS A REALIST AND I DO
NOT THINK LONG-TERM CONFLICT 

02:15:12.023 --> 02:15:16.613
WITH RUSSIA IS DESIRABLE OR 
INEVITABLE. WE NEED TO STABILIZE

02:15:18.065 --> 02:15:20.065
OUR RELATIONSHIP

02:15:24.009 --> 02:15:26.186
WITH MOSCOW AND RIGHT NOW, 
SECURITY SERVICES AND THEIR 

02:15:26.362 --> 02:15:29.638
PROXIES HAVE REPEATED 
INTERFERENCE WITH THE 20/20 

02:15:29.817 --> 02:15:34.163
ELECTION. WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF 
TIME TO STOP THEM. I WOULD ASK 

02:15:34.363 --> 02:15:40.203
THAT YOU PLEASE NOT PROMOTE 
SERVICES BUT AS VULCANS AND 

02:15:40.377 --> 02:15:44.931
DEMOCRATS, UKRAINE IS A VALUED 
PARTNER AND IT PLAYS AN 

02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:50.002
IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR SECURITY. 
AS I TOLD THE COMMITTEE, I 

02:15:50.202 --> 02:15:52.998
REFUSE TO BE PART OF THIS 
NARRATIVE THAT THE UKRAINIAN 

02:15:53.167 --> 02:15:59.703
GOVERNMENT IN UKRAINE NOT RUSSIA
ATTACKED IN 2016. THESE ARE 

02:15:59.879 --> 02:16:04.336
HARMFUL EVEN IF THEY ARE FOR 
DOMESTIC PURPOSES.

02:16:12.952 --> 02:16:15.184
THEY OPERATE LIKE A SUPER PACK 
AND PLAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO 

02:16:15.399 --> 02:16:17.219
WEAPON EYES OUR OWN POLITICAL 
OPPOSITION RESEARCH AND FALSE 

02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:19.655
NARRATIVES. WHEN WE ARE CONSUMED
BY THIS, WE CANNOT HAVE THESE 

02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:25.957
EXTERNAL FORCES TO HAVE 
INSTITUTIONS AND DESTROY THE 

02:16:26.717 --> 02:16:31.571
AMERICAN PEOPLE. I RESPECT THE 
WORK THAT THIS CONGRESS DOES

02:16:36.112 --> 02:16:41.803
AND I AM HERE TO HELP YOU TO THE
BEST OF MY ABILITY. IF ANYONE 

02:16:42.202 --> 02:16:44.626
SUBVERTS THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
OF THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO

02:16:44.797 --> 02:16:46.797
DEFER THE PERSONAL INTEREST

02:16:48.906 --> 02:16:51.040
, THAT IS WORTHY OF YOUR 
ATTENTION BUT WE MUST SELECT 

02:16:51.702 --> 02:16:54.457
DOMESTIC POLITICS STOP US FROM 
DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THE 

02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:58.052
FOREIGN POWERS. THANK YOU.

02:17:06.187 --> 02:17:08.614
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DR. HILL, WE WILL 
NOW PROCEED TO THE FIRST ROUND 

02:17:08.816 --> 02:17:11.451
OF QUESTIONS. THERE WILL BE 45 
MINUTES OF  QUESTIONS CONNECTED 

02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:13.700
BY THE CHAIRMAN OR COUNCIL AND 
45 MEMBERS

02:17:17.954 --> 02:17:20.815
FOR THE RANKING COUNSEL UNLESS I
SPECIFY EQUAL TIME FOR US TO THE

02:17:21.064 --> 02:17:23.320
QUESTIONING, WE WILL PROCEED 
UNDER THE FIVE MINUTE RULE AND 

02:17:23.623 --> 02:17:27.095
EVERY MEMBER WILL HAVE A TIME TO
ASK QUESTIONS. I NOW RECOGNIZE 

02:17:27.305 --> 02:17:29.539
MYSELF FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF 
QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL, THANK 

02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:36.039
YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND 
TESTIFYING. DR. HILL, YOUR STORY

02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:40.629
PROVIDES A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT WE
HEARD FROM ALEXANDER

02:17:44.152 --> 02:17:46.388
AND THE FEW IMMIGRANT STORIES 
THAT WE HAVE HEARD IN THE COURSE

02:17:46.601 --> 02:17:49.600
OF THESE HEARINGS ARE AMONG THE 
MOST POWERFUL THAT I HAVE EVER 

02:17:49.772 --> 02:17:54.011
HEARD. YOU AND OTHERS

02:17:57.776 --> 02:18:01.071
ARE THE BEST OF THIS COUNTRY AND
YOU CAME HERE BY CHOICE AND WE 

02:18:01.251 --> 02:18:07.231
ARE SO BLESSED THAT YOU DID. SO,
WELCOME. MY COLLEAGUES

02:18:14.625 --> 02:18:16.625
TOOK SOME UMBRAGE WITH YOUR 
OPENING STATEMENT BUT I THINK 

02:18:16.656 --> 02:18:18.691
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE 
FORGIVEN IF THEY HAVE THE SAME 

02:18:18.892 --> 02:18:21.125
IMPRESSION LISTEN TO THE 
STATEMENTS THAT RUSSIA DID NOT 

02:18:21.337 --> 02:18:24.789
INTERVENE IN OUR ELECTION BUT IT
WAS ALL OF THE UKRAINIANS. 

02:18:25.189 --> 02:18:30.016
THERE'S AN EFFORT TO HAVE THE 
STORY HERE OR THERE AND SOMEHOW 

02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:33.519
EQUATED WITH THE SYSTEMIC 
INTERVENTION THAT THE 

02:18:33.721 --> 02:18:35.733
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FOUND THAT 
RUSSIA PERPETRATED IN 2016

02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:44.870
AND THE REPORT MY COLLEAGUES 
GAVE YOU THAT THEY PRODUCED 

02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:48.754
DURING AN INVESTIGATION CALLS 
INTO QUESTION THE ACCURACY OF 

02:18:48.955 --> 02:18:50.955
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES FINDING 
THAT RUSSIA INTERVENED

02:18:56.672 --> 02:18:58.705
TO HELP DONALD TRUMP AT THE 
EXPENSE OF HILLARY CLINTON. NO 

02:18:58.914 --> 02:19:01.553
ONE QUESTIONS THAT FINDING AND 
OR DOES THE FBI OR THE SENATE OR

02:19:01.753 --> 02:19:05.804
THE MINORITY COMMITTEE REPORT OF
THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE HOUSE 

02:19:06.356 --> 02:19:10.624
REPUBLICANS REPORT THAT AS AN 
OUTLIER. LET ME ASK YOU, DR. 

02:19:10.798 --> 02:19:17.025
HILL ABOUT YOUR CONCERN WITH 
THAT RUSSIAN NARRATIVE THAT IT 

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:23.278
WASN'T THE RUSSIANS THAT ENGAGED
IN INTERFERING ELECTIONS AND OF 

02:19:23.493 --> 02:19:25.493
COURSE THIS WAS GIVEN A BOOST

02:19:29.778 --> 02:19:31.811
ON THEY SAID HE QUESTION HIS OWN
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BUT WHY 

02:19:32.025 --> 02:19:34.768
ARE THE RUSSIANS PUSHING THAT 
NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS UKRAINE 

02:19:34.978 --> 02:19:36.289
AND HOW DOES THAT SERVE RUSSIAN 
INTEREST? 

02:19:36.290 --> 02:19:40.956
&gt;&gt;  THE RUSSIAN INTEREST WANTED 
TO DELEGITIMIZE OUR PRESIDENCY 

02:19:41.157 --> 02:19:46.240
AND ONE ISSUE I WANT TO RAISE 
AND I THINK THIS WOULD RESONATE 

02:19:46.641 --> 02:19:52.536
ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THAT 
THE GOAL OF THE RUSSIANS WAS TO 

02:19:52.737 --> 02:19:55.174
PUT WHOEVER BECAME THE PRESIDENT
BY TRYING TO TIP THEIR HANDS 

02:19:55.373 --> 02:19:57.373
UPON SIDE OF THE SCALE UNDER THE
CLOUD.

02:20:01.276 --> 02:20:04.441
SO IF THEY HAVE BEEN ELECTED AND
INDEED MANY EXPECTED

02:20:11.224 --> 02:20:13.224
THAT ELECTION IN 2016, SHE TOO 
WOULD'VE HAD MAJOR QUESTIONS 

02:20:13.813 --> 02:20:17.556
ABOUT LEGITIMACY AND I THINK 
WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE AS A 

02:20:17.733 --> 02:20:21.794
RESULT OF ALL THESE NARRATIVES, 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE 

02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:23.990
GOVERNMENT WAS HOPING FOR

02:20:27.273 --> 02:20:29.102
. THEY SEE MISINFORMATION AND 
DOUBT AND HAVE EVERYONE 

02:20:29.103 --> 02:20:31.103
QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY

02:20:33.772 --> 02:20:38.165
AND THAT THEY WOULD PICK ONE 
SIDE AGAINST THE OTHER.

02:20:43.523 --> 02:20:45.956
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO MAKE SUCH
A STRONG POINT AT THE VERY 

02:20:46.716 --> 02:20:48.392
BEGINNING BECAUSE THERE WERE 
INDIVIDUALS IN MANY COUNTRIES 

02:20:48.393 --> 02:20:50.393
THAT HAD HARSH WORDS

02:20:56.105 --> 02:20:58.751
FOR MANY OF THE CANDIDATES AND 
WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:20:58.953 --> 02:21:00.786
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE. MANY PEOPLE 

02:21:00.787 --> 02:21:03.835
WERE TRYING TO GAIN THE OUTCOME 
AND AS YOU KNOW, THE BOOKIES 

02:21:04.593 --> 02:21:06.593
TAKE BETS.

02:21:10.335 --> 02:21:12.790
YOU CAN LAY BETS ON WHO YOU 
THINK WILL BE THE CANDIDATES IN 

02:21:12.972 --> 02:21:15.204
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY
TO LAND THEIR OWN BETS BUT WHAT 

02:21:15.405 --> 02:21:17.650
THEY WANTED TO DO WAS GIVE A 
SPREAD AND MAKE SURE THAT 

02:21:17.851 --> 02:21:20.493
WHOEVER THEY HAD BET ON OR TRY 
TO TIP THE SCALES THAT THEY 

02:21:20.686 --> 02:21:25.771
WOULD EXPERIENCE SOME DISCOMFORT
AND THAT THEY WOULD CREATE THE 

02:21:25.969 --> 02:21:30.149
KIND OF CHAOS WE HAVE SEEN IN 
THAT POLITIC.

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:36.137
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE NEED
TO BE CAREFUL AS WE DISCUSSED 

02:21:36.332 --> 02:21:38.767
ALL OF THESE ISSUES NOT TO GET 
THEM MORE THAT THEY CAN USE 

02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:42.634
AGAINST US. 
&gt;&gt; I QUITE AGREE AND I THINK YOU

02:21:42.831 --> 02:21:48.114
ARE RIGHT  THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY METALLERS AND 

02:21:48.316 --> 02:21:54.414
THEY WILL NOT ONLY HELP ONE SIDE
ALSO SEEK TO SHOW DISCORD IN THE

02:21:54.615 --> 02:21:56.648
UNITED STATES ALONG ETHNIC OR 
RELIGIOUS OR GEOGRAPHIC LINES 

02:21:56.851 --> 02:21:58.851
BUT THERE IS ALSO A BENEFIT NOW

02:22:02.534 --> 02:22:04.966
FOR RUSSIA TO PUT THE BLAME ON 
UKRAINE AND TO CAST DOUBT ON 

02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:11.273
WHETHER THEY INTERVENED AT ALL 
AND BLAME IT ON A U. S. ALLY AS 

02:22:11.473 --> 02:22:13.931
A WAY OF DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN
THE U. S. AND UKRAINE, ISN'T 

02:22:14.108 --> 02:22:15.738
THAT TRUE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE 

02:22:15.739 --> 02:22:21.623
AND  THE RUSSIANS LIKE TO PUT A 
LOT OF BLAME ON U. S. ALLIES. WE

02:22:21.837 --> 02:22:25.033
PUT THAT RECENTLY WITH THE 
UNITED KINGDOM AND THE SECRET 

02:22:25.208 --> 02:22:27.208
SERVICES

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:34.259
AND WHAT YOU MAY RECALL THAT 
THEY ACTUALLY ACCUSED THEM OF 

02:22:34.435 --> 02:22:38.280
PERPETRATING THIS THEMSELVES AND
THIS FALLS INTO A LONG PATENT 

02:22:38.695 --> 02:22:40.929
WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
TRYING TO PIN THE BLAME ON 

02:22:41.686 --> 02:22:45.600
SOMEONE ELSE. MY COLLEAGUE HAS 
LAID OUT THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE 

02:22:45.801 --> 02:22:52.906
A VESTED INTEREST IN PUTTING 
THEM IN A BAD LIGHT. ALL OF THE 

02:22:53.107 --> 02:22:56.157
ISSUES THAT WE STARTED TO 
DISCUSS AND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

02:22:56.359 --> 02:23:05.908
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN BEGAN WITH 
THE ANNEXATION FROM UKRAINE IN 

02:23:06.109 --> 02:23:08.473
RESPONSE WITH ALL OF THE 
DIFFERENT ACTS OF AGGRESSION

02:23:13.629 --> 02:23:15.629
AND LOOKING AT THE RUSSIAN 
OPERATIVES

02:23:19.113 --> 02:23:25.415
AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF 
HOSTILITY AND INTENT AND IT 

02:23:25.614 --> 02:23:30.889
SUITS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
VERY MUCH IF WE ARE ALSO LOOKING

02:23:31.105 --> 02:23:36.372
AT UKRAINE AND SOMEHOW THE 
PERPETRATOR AGAINST US. 

02:23:36.373 --> 02:23:39.132
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES, I WANT TO ASK A 
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS .

02:23:46.542 --> 02:23:48.542
I WAS HONESTLY AT YOUR 
DEPOSITION AND I READ YOUR 

02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:50.594
OPENING TESTIMONY BUT HAVE YOU 
LEARN MORE FACTS, YOU SEE THINGS

02:23:50.796 --> 02:23:52.796
IN DIFFERENT LIGHT EVEN THOUGH 
THE OPENING STATEMENT IS VERY 

02:23:52.829 --> 02:23:56.710
MUCH CONSISTENT AND I WAS STRUCK
IN PARTICULAR MY SOMETHING YOU 

02:23:56.893 --> 02:23:59.485
SAID ON PAGE 10 OF YOUR OPENING 
STATEMENT. WE HAD ADVISED 

02:23:59.658 --> 02:24:03.390
COUNTERPARTS TO HAVE A 
COMMITMENT AND FOLLOWING THE 

02:24:03.592 --> 02:24:07.655
RULE OF LAW AND GENERALLY 
INVESTIGATE INCREDIBLE 

02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:10.070
ALLEGATIONS, THIS WAS A DEMAND 
THAT

02:24:14.575 --> 02:24:16.575
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WOULD COMMIT 
ON THE NEWS CHANNEL AND SPECIFIC

02:24:16.604 --> 02:24:19.238
INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S POLITICAL RIVAL . THIS 

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:22.435
GETS TO A POINT THAT I MADE AT 
THE CLOSE OF OUR HEARING 

02:24:22.618 --> 02:24:24.849
YESTERDAY. ABOUT HYPOCRISY. HERE
WE ARE

02:24:29.396 --> 02:24:31.628
AND WE ARE URGING UKRAINIANS TO 
COMMIT TO FOLLOWING THE RULE OF 

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:34.622
LAW AS YOU SAID AND ONLY 
INVESTIGATE GENUINE AND CREDIBLE

02:24:34.794 --> 02:24:38.687
ALLEGATIONS AND WHAT ARE WE 
DOING? WE ARE ASKING THEM TO 

02:24:38.862 --> 02:24:45.760
INVESTIGATE THE PRESIDENT'S 
POLITICAL RIVAL. THEY ARE PRETTY

02:24:46.814 --> 02:24:48.814
SOPHISTICATED ACTORS

02:24:52.349 --> 02:24:54.168
, AREN'T THEY? THEY CAN 
RECOGNIZE HYPOCRISY WHEN THEY 

02:24:54.169 --> 02:24:59.054
SEE IT. WHAT IS IT YOU WHEN THEY
SEE THEY ARE ENGAGING IN 

02:24:59.456 --> 02:25:00.878
CORRUPTION OURSELVES? 
&gt;&gt; YES SIR, THE LONG-STANDING 

02:25:00.879 --> 02:25:03.315
POLICY IS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO 
ESTABLISH AND BUILD  RULE OF LAW

02:25:03.525 --> 02:25:05.525
INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN PURSUE

02:25:09.215 --> 02:25:11.233
ALLEGATIONS AND THAT IS THE 
POLICY AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING 

02:25:11.448 --> 02:25:13.828
THAT FOR QUITE SOME TIME WITH 
SUCCESS. FOCUSING ON PARTICULAR 

02:25:14.004 --> 02:25:21.750
CASES WHERE THERE IS INTEREST OF
THE PRESIDENT AND IT'S HARD TO 

02:25:21.925 --> 02:25:30.329
EXPLAIN WHY WE WOULD DO THAT. 
&gt;&gt; BACK TO THAT CONVERSATION  

02:25:30.743 --> 02:25:34.523
WHEN HE URGED UKRAINE NOT TO 
PROSECUTE IN THE REPLY

02:25:38.251 --> 02:25:41.232
WAS YOU MEAN LIKE YOU WANT TO 
STAY WITH THE BIDENS AND THE 

02:25:41.403 --> 02:25:43.452
CLINTONS? THEY ARE SOPHISTICATED
ENOUGH ACTORS TO RECOGNIZE

02:25:50.849 --> 02:25:54.012
WHEN WE ARE STAYING DO AS WE SAY
AND NOT AS WE DO, OR THEY NOT? 

02:25:54.185 --> 02:25:56.185
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS STRUCK BY THIS TODAY , 

02:25:56.332 --> 02:26:01.950
WHEN EVEN AFTER THE AID IS 
LISTED, UKRAINE STILL FELT 

02:26:02.152 --> 02:26:06.897
PRESSURE TO MAKE THE STATEMENTS 
AND YOU WERE WORRIED THAT THEY 

02:26:07.099 --> 02:26:13.544
WOULD DO IT ON CNN AND YOU SAID 
THAT INVESTOR TAYLOR SAID HE 

02:26:13.718 --> 02:26:18.477
HOPED NO INTERVIEW WAS PLANNED 
AND HE DID NOT ANSWER BUT 

02:26:18.677 --> 02:26:22.892
SHRUGGED IN RESIGNATION AS IF TO
INDICATE THAT THEY HAD NO 

02:26:23.069 --> 02:26:28.022
CHOICE. EVERYONE THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD BE AN INTERVIEW AND THAT 

02:26:28.222 --> 02:26:33.091
THE UKRAINIANS BELIEVED THEY HAD
TO DO IT. ARE YOU NOTING THAT 

02:26:33.505 --> 02:26:37.067
UKRAINE FELT PRESSURED TO 
UNDERTAKE THESE INVESTIGATIONS

02:26:41.836 --> 02:26:47.724
THAT OTHERS WERE DEMANDING? 
&gt;&gt; YES SIR AND ALL OF THE HOLD 

02:26:47.926 --> 02:26:50.358
MAY HAVE BEEN LIFTED , THERE 
WERE THINGS THEY WANTED THAT 

02:26:50.574 --> 02:26:54.559
THEY WERE NOT GETTING AND

02:26:59.092 --> 02:27:00.925
WHETHER THAT CONTINUED OR NOT, 
UKRAINE'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT 

02:27:00.926 --> 02:27:04.577
WAS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 
WANTED AND THEY WANTED IMPORTANT

02:27:04.779 --> 02:27:07.013
THINGS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND I 
THINK THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY

02:27:07.229 --> 02:27:12.499
AND THEY STILL NEED US NOW GOING
FORWARD. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE 

02:27:12.701 --> 02:27:16.367
TRYING TO ARRANGE A SUMMIT 
MEETING IN THE COMING WEEKS WITH

02:27:16.567 --> 02:27:18.567
THE FIRST FACE-TO-FACE MEETING 
TO TRY TO ADVANCE THE PEACE 

02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:23.425
PROCESS AND HE NEEDS OUR SUPPORT
AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT AMERICA 

02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.550
SUPPORTS PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AT 
THE HIGHEST LEVELS. THIS IS IN 

02:27:28.767 --> 02:27:33.231
AND WHAT THE LIFTING OF  
SECURITY. THEY ARE STILL 

02:27:33.446 --> 02:27:35.446
FIGHTING THIS WAR. 
&gt;&gt; 

02:27:39.129 --> 02:27:44.153
MY COLLEAGUE SAID SO ELEGANTLY 
THAT THEY GOT CAUGHT. 

02:27:44.154 --> 02:27:46.154
&gt;&gt; 

02:27:48.677 --> 02:27:50.677
THE MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU. 
YESTERDAY WE HEARD TESTIMONY 

02:27:50.711 --> 02:27:54.776
FROM AMBASSADOR GORDON SUMLIN 
FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT 

02:27:54.979 --> 02:27:57.157
TESTIFIED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WANTED UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE THE 

02:27:57.336 --> 02:28:00.203
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BIDENS 
AND

02:28:06.141 --> 02:28:07.972
BARIZMA BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
BENEFIT HIM POLITICALLY AND HE 

02:28:07.973 --> 02:28:10.509
IS LEVERAGE OF THAT MEETING  TO 
PRESSURE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO 

02:28:10.679 --> 02:28:15.405
DO SO.  DR. HILL, YOU TESTIFIED 
IN MID-JUNE THAT

02:28:20.156 --> 02:28:22.189
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND TOLD YOU 
THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF UKRAINE

02:28:22.390 --> 02:28:24.836
POLICY. IS THAT  RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

02:28:24.837 --> 02:28:29.319
&gt;&gt; WHO DID HE SAY  PUT YOU IN 
CHARGE? 

02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:31.938
&gt;&gt; HE SAID IT WAS THE PRESIDENT.
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, DID YOU ALSO 

02:28:32.703 --> 02:28:36.206
UNDERSTAND THAT AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND HAVE BEEN GIVEN 

02:28:36.407 --> 02:28:39.857
AUTHORITY OVER UKRAINE POLICY 
FROM THE PRESIDENT?  

02:28:39.858 --> 02:28:45.354
&gt;&gt; WE UNDERSTOOD HE HAD BEEN 
TOLD  TO WORK WITH MR. GIULIANI.

02:28:45.555 --> 02:28:48.347
&gt;&gt; DID HE HOLD HIMSELF OUT AS 
HAVING  DIRECT CONTACT AND 

02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:50.520
KNOWLEDGE

02:28:56.119 --> 02:28:57.736
OF THE PRIORITIES AND INTERESTS?
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 

02:28:57.737 --> 02:29:00.923
&gt;&gt; I WILL GO TO THAT JULY 26 
DATE  WHEN YOU OVERHEARD THE 

02:29:01.108 --> 02:29:06.098
CONVERSATION BETWEEN AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

02:29:06.282 --> 02:29:11.499
I WILL ASK YOU  A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT THE LEAD UP TO THAT 

02:29:11.699 --> 02:29:16.784
CONVERSATION. BEFORE THE ONES 
THAT YOU DESCRIBED, YOU SAID YOU

02:29:16.963 --> 02:29:22.240
ACCOMPANIED VOLKER AND TAYLOR 
AND SONDLAND  TO A MEETING

02:29:29.016 --> 02:29:30.233
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, IS THAT
RIGHT? 

02:29:30.234 --> 02:29:32.064
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; YOU TOOK NOTES OF THAT 

02:29:32.065 --> 02:29:32.677
MEETING? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

02:29:32.678 --> 02:29:36.744
&gt;&gt;  YOU LOOKED OVER THOSE TO 
HELP YOUR RECOLLECTION, IS THAT 

02:29:36.945 --> 02:29:37.546
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

02:29:37.547 --> 02:29:40.202
&gt;&gt; DURING THAT MEETING, HE SAID 
ON HIS PHONE CALL WAS PRESIDENT 

02:29:40.395 --> 02:29:45.275
TRUMP THE PREVIOUS DAY THAT 
THREE TIMES PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:48.441
MENTIONED SENSITIVE ISSUES. DID 
YOU UNDERSTAND

02:29:51.966 --> 02:29:53.798
WHAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WAS 
REFERRING TO WHEN HE SAID 

02:29:53.799 --> 02:29:57.398
SENSITIVE ISSUES?  
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN BE SURE UNTIL I LATER

02:29:59.901 --> 02:30:03.752
READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THAT JULY
25 PHONE CALL BUT I WAS AWARE OF

02:30:03.952 --> 02:30:06.100
VARIOUS CONTACTS BETWEEN THE 
THREE AMIGOS AND HIS GOVERNMENT

02:30:12.078 --> 02:30:14.309
ABOUT THESE SETS OF ISSUES. 
&gt;&gt; AFTER YOU READ THE CALL, WHAT

02:30:14.524 --> 02:30:16.524
DID YOU DETERMINE TO BE THE 
SENSITIVE ISSUES REFERENCE?  

02:30:16.546 --> 02:30:18.578
&gt;&gt; THE  BARIZMA BY AN 
INVESTIGATION. 

02:30:18.579 --> 02:30:22.234
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID THAT  AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND HAD A ONE-ON-ONE  

02:30:22.647 --> 02:30:24.647
MEETING WITH THE TOP A TO

02:30:28.133 --> 02:30:31.983
ZELENSKY AND YOU ARE PROHIBITED 
TO TAKE NOTES, IS THAT RIGHT?  

02:30:32.398 --> 02:30:33.415
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; YESTERDAY, AMBASSADOR 

02:30:33.416 --> 02:30:35.998
SONDLAND TESTIFIED  THAT HE 
PROBABLY DISCUSSED THE 

02:30:36.167 --> 02:30:38.167
INVESTIGATIONS

02:30:42.757 --> 02:30:44.814
AND DID AMBASSADOR SONDLAND TELL
YOU AT ALL WHAT THEY DISCUSS? 

02:30:44.997 --> 02:30:47.826
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT.  
&gt;&gt; AFTER THIS MEETING, YOU WENT 

02:30:48.039 --> 02:30:52.453
TO LUNCH AND CAN YOU JUST 
DESCRIBE  WHERE YOU ARE SITTING?

02:30:56.317 --> 02:30:59.924
&gt;&gt;  WE WERE AT THE FIRST TABLES

02:31:05.307 --> 02:31:11.195
AND THE DOORS WERE ALL 
WIDE-OPEN. THERE WERE TABLES 

02:31:12.157 --> 02:31:18.499
PUSHED TOGETHER AND IT WAS A 
WIDE TABLE. AND THERE WAS A 

02:31:18.713 --> 02:31:26.224
RUNNER DOWN THE MIDDLE AND WE 
WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SHARE AN 

02:31:26.425 --> 02:31:31.090
ADVERTISER BETWEEN US AND THEN 
THEY WERE OFF TO THE RIGHT AT 

02:31:31.305 --> 02:31:35.293
THE NEXT TABLE. 
&gt;&gt;  YOU SAID AT SOME POINT THAT 

02:31:35.479 --> 02:31:37.479
AMBASSADOR

02:31:39.228 --> 02:31:41.046
SONDLAND PULLED OUT HIS CELL 
PHONE AND CALLED PRESIDENT 

02:31:41.047 --> 02:31:44.296
TRUMP.  THIS WAS UNSECURE, IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

02:31:44.297 --> 02:31:46.297
&gt;&gt;  YES.

02:31:48.566 --> 02:31:52.759
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU WERE ABLE TO 
HEAR  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VOICE

02:31:57.501 --> 02:31:59.948
THROUGH THE RECEIVER. HOW WERE 
YOU ABLE TO HEAR IF IT WAS NOT 

02:32:00.149 --> 02:32:03.734
ON SPEAKERPHONE? 
&gt;&gt;  IT WAS QUITE LOUD AND QUITE 

02:32:03.908 --> 02:32:05.908
DISTINCTIVE

02:32:08.065 --> 02:32:09.898
AND I BELIEVE AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND THAT HE SPEAKS VERY 

02:32:09.899 --> 02:32:13.346
LOUDLY OVER THE PHONE  AND I 
CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED THAT. WHEN

02:32:13.548 --> 02:32:20.382
THE PRESIDENT CAME ON, HE WINCED
AND HELD THE PHONE AWAY FROM HIS

02:32:21.883 --> 02:32:24.119
EAR AND HE DID THAT FOR THE 
FIRST COUPLE EXCHANGES. I DON'T 

02:32:24.321 --> 02:32:26.321
KNOW IF YOU GOT USED TO IT

02:32:29.602 --> 02:32:33.252
BUT THAT IS HOW I WAS ABLE TO 
HEAR IT. 

02:32:33.253 --> 02:32:36.050
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE ABLE TO HEAR SOME OF 
WHAT HE SAID  TO

02:32:40.361 --> 02:32:41.375
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 

02:32:41.376 --> 02:32:44.747
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST PART. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU HEAR  HIM SAY TO

02:32:46.192 --> 02:32:48.192
SONDLAND? 

02:32:50.314 --> 02:32:54.985
&gt;&gt; HE CLARIFY WHETHER HE WAS IN 
UKRAINE ARE NOT  AS AN 

02:32:55.198 --> 02:32:57.198
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID 

02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:04.737
IF HE COULD DO THE 
INVESTIGATION. 

02:33:04.738 --> 02:33:07.991
&gt;&gt; YOU HEARD PRESENT OF ACT 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND  IF HE IS 

02:33:08.191 --> 02:33:10.023
GOING TO DO THE INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR.  

02:33:10.024 --> 02:33:14.225
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS  AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND'S RESPONSE? 

02:33:14.226 --> 02:33:17.695
&gt;&gt;  HE SAID HE WILL DO ANYTHING 
YOU ASK.

02:33:23.018 --> 02:33:25.254
&gt;&gt; WAS AT THE END OF THE UKRAINE
PORTION OF THE CONVERSATION? 

02:33:25.454 --> 02:33:27.688
&gt;&gt; YES.  
&gt;&gt; AFTERWARDS, YOU DESCRIBE  A 

02:33:27.892 --> 02:33:31.860
FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION THAT YOU 
HAD WHERE YOU ASKED HIM

02:33:37.031 --> 02:33:39.031
GENERALLY WHAT DID PRESIDENT 
TRUMP THINK OF UKRAINE, IS THAT 

02:33:39.064 --> 02:33:39.682
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; CRACKED. 

02:33:39.683 --> 02:33:41.858
&gt;&gt;  WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; 

02:33:46.182 --> 02:33:47.599
HE SAID HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT 
UKRAINE. 

02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:49.217
&gt;&gt; DID HE USE SLIGHTLY MORE 
COLORFUL LANGUAGE? 

02:33:49.218 --> 02:33:53.486
&gt;&gt; HE DID.  
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY HE DOES CARE 

02:33:53.685 --> 02:33:55.319
ABOUT? 
&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE CARES ABOUT BIG 

02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:59.989
STUFF.  
&gt;&gt;  DID HE SAY WHAT KIND OF BIG 

02:34:00.189 --> 02:34:02.189
STUFF? 
&gt;&gt; I ASKED HIM WHAT KIND  AND HE

02:34:02.223 --> 02:34:08.044
SAID BIG STUFF LIKE THE BY AN 
INVESTIGATION. 

02:34:08.045 --> 02:34:13.396
&gt;&gt;  WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE 
BY THE INVESTIGATION THAT WAS 

02:34:13.597 --> 02:34:17.208
REFERENCED AT THAT POINT? 
&gt;&gt; YES .

02:34:20.699 --> 02:34:22.699
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU HAVE 

02:34:25.582 --> 02:34:27.201
SUCH A SPECIFIC AND CLEAR 
RECOLLECTION OF THIS 

02:34:27.202 --> 02:34:29.393
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND YOUR CONVERSATION WITH 

02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:31.570
AMBASSADOR

02:34:33.104 --> 02:34:35.071
SONDLAND. 
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A VERY DISTINCTIVE 

02:34:35.072 --> 02:34:40.610
EXPERIENCE  WITH MY FOREIGN 
SERVICE CAREER AND SOMEONE AT A 

02:34:40.811 --> 02:34:44.476
LUNCH IN A RESTAURANT MAKING A 
CALL ON A CELL PHONE TO THE 

02:34:44.677 --> 02:34:46.910
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND BEING ABLE TO HEAR HIS VOICE

02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:54.629
AND DISTINCTIVE PERSONALITY. 
VERY COLORFUL LANGUAGE WAS USED 

02:34:55.031 --> 02:34:57.064
AND THEY WERE DIRECTLY 
ADDRESSING SOMETHING THAT I HAVE

02:34:57.815 --> 02:34:59.815
BEEN WONDERING

02:35:02.352 --> 02:35:07.982
ABOUT WITH THE TOPIC THAT HAD 
LED TO THE RECALL OF MY FORMER 

02:35:08.161 --> 02:35:15.756
BOSS AND HERE WAS A PERSON WHO 
SAID HE HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH 

02:35:15.957 --> 02:35:19.208
THE PRESIDENT AND HE SAID THAT 
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AND THEN

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:25.018
THEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF
THE BY AN INVESTIGATION

02:35:28.552 --> 02:35:30.784
THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT. 
&gt;&gt; JUST TO SUMMARIZE, DURING THE

02:35:30.984 --> 02:35:35.451
PHONE CALL  THAT YOU OVERHEARD 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND HAVE WITH 

02:35:35.665 --> 02:35:39.119
PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU HEARD 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF  AS THE 

02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.992
ONLY QUESTION THAT YOU REALLY 
HEARD HIM ASK WHICH IS WHETHER 

02:35:44.191 --> 02:35:49.478
HE WOULD DO THE INVESTIGATION. 
TO WHICH AMBASSADOR SONDLAND  

02:35:49.879 --> 02:35:56.385
SAID HE WOULD DO ANYTHING THAT 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WANTS.  IS 

02:35:56.584 --> 02:35:58.357
THAT ACCURATE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

02:35:58.358 --> 02:36:02.074
&gt;&gt;  AFTER THAT CALL, YOU HAD A 
SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION WHERE HE

02:36:02.835 --> 02:36:08.774
TOLD YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT UKRAINE BUT 

02:36:08.976 --> 02:36:13.845
ONLY ABOUT BIG STUFF RELATED TO 
HIMSELF AND PARTICULARLY THE BY 

02:36:14.046 --> 02:36:16.696
INVESTIGATION THAT GIULIANI WAS 
PUSHING? 

02:36:16.697 --> 02:36:22.581
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  A DAY BEFORE, PRESIDENT 

02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:26.445
TRUMP DID SPEAK WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AS YOU REFERRED  AND 

02:36:26.644 --> 02:36:30.914
CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT MADE IT
CLEAR THAT HE CARED ABOUT THE BY

02:36:31.678 --> 02:36:36.132
AN INVESTIGATION. NEITHER OF YOU
LISTEN TO THIS CALL BUT AS YOU 

02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:42.289
TESTIFIED, YOU BOTH READ IT 
SUBSEQUENT TO THE PUBLICATION. 

02:36:42.691 --> 02:36:48.374
DR. HILL, DURING YOUR TIME, YOU 
LISTEN TO A NUMBER OF 

02:36:48.788 --> 02:36:50.564
PRESIDENTIAL PHONE CALLS. IS 
THAT RIGHT? 

02:36:50.565 --> 02:36:52.565
&gt;&gt; 

02:36:54.677 --> 02:36:56.496
THAT IS RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; HE ASKED ME HOW MANY? 

02:36:56.497 --> 02:36:58.533
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THERE WOULD BE 
MULTIPLE CALLS  DURING THE WEEK 

02:36:58.733 --> 02:37:00.767
AND I WAS THERE FOR MORE THAN 
TWO YEARS.  

02:37:00.768 --> 02:37:05.823
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER HEARD A CALL  
LIKE THIS ONE THAT YOU READ? 

02:37:05.999 --> 02:37:09.099
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON 
THIS CALL  BECAUSE IN MY VIEW IT

02:37:09.301 --> 02:37:11.853
IS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. IN TERMS
OF THE TESTIMONY.

02:37:19.456 --> 02:37:21.689
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS A THRESHOLD 
MANNER AND THEIR ISSUES OF 

02:37:21.891 --> 02:37:23.891
CLASSIFICATION REGARDING HEAD OF
STATE COMMUNICATIONS  THAT WE DO

02:37:23.927 --> 02:37:27.980
WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO AMONG 
OTHER ISSUES. 

02:37:27.981 --> 02:37:31.647
&gt;&gt; UNDERSTOOD BUT I'M JUST FOCUS
ON THIS ONE CALL THAT HAS BEEN  

02:37:32.050 --> 02:37:34.217
DECLASSIFIED AND WHETHER YOU HAD
HEARD ANY PRESIDENTIAL PHONE 

02:37:34.419 --> 02:37:39.597
CALL ALONG THESE LINES. 
&gt;&gt;  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO FOCUS 

02:37:39.773 --> 02:37:43.423
ON THIS PARTICULAR CALL AND I 
WILL JUST SAY THAT I FOUND THIS 

02:37:44.039 --> 02:37:46.406
PARTICULAR CALL SUBJECT MATTER 
AND THE WAY IT WAS CONDUCTED 

02:37:46.585 --> 02:37:48.585
SURPRISING.

02:37:51.143 --> 02:37:53.175
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID IN YOUR DEPOSITION 
TESTIMONY THAT YOU WERE SHOCKED 

02:37:53.375 --> 02:37:56.425
AND SADDENED  TO READ IT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 

02:37:56.426 --> 02:37:59.673
&gt;&gt; WHY IS THAT?  
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE NATURE  OF THE

02:37:59.874 --> 02:38:06.312
DISCUSSION AND ISSUES IN WHICH 
THEY WERE RAISED AND GIVEN THE 

02:38:06.492 --> 02:38:08.492
FACT THAT I HAD OPPOSED

02:38:12.066 --> 02:38:14.915
HAVING A CALL THAT WAS VERY WELL
PREPARED AND WE WERE CONFIDENT 

02:38:15.117 --> 02:38:19.519
THAT THE ISSUES THAT UKRAINE IN 
THE UNITED STATES WERE GENERALLY

02:38:19.692 --> 02:38:24.691
TOGETHER AND INTERESTED IN WOULD
BE RACE AND I SAW THAT THIS WAS 

02:38:24.867 --> 02:38:29.131
NOT THE CASE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED  THAT THIS CALL

02:38:29.890 --> 02:38:31.890
WAS TURNING

02:38:36.031 --> 02:38:38.466
A WHITE HOUSE MEETING INTO SOME 
KIND OF ASSET. DO YOU RECALL THE

02:38:38.681 --> 02:38:40.681
TESTIMONY? 
&gt;&gt;  RECALL THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE

02:38:41.116 --> 02:38:43.116
THIS WAS CLEARLY THE DISCUSSION

02:38:46.388 --> 02:38:48.388
IN THE CALL TOOK PLACE THE 
FOLLOWING WEEK.

02:38:51.877 --> 02:38:54.846
IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THAT
FROM MAY ONWARD, IT BECAME CLEAR

02:38:55.942 --> 02:38:58.175
THAT THE MIGHT HOUSE MEETING WAS
BEEN PREDICATED ON OTHER ISSUES 

02:38:58.936 --> 02:39:00.936
WITH INVESTIGATIONS

02:39:02.845 --> 02:39:07.722
AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ELECTION
INTERFERENCE. 

02:39:07.723 --> 02:39:10.362
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES, YOU INDICATED IN 
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT  THAT THE

02:39:10.562 --> 02:39:16.154
CHIEF OF STAFF HAD INDICATED TO 
YOU THAT IN THIS PHONE CALL

02:39:20.318 --> 02:39:22.318
THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION 
ABOUT PERSONAL ISSUES RELATED TO

02:39:22.351 --> 02:39:25.938
THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE.
AFTER YOU READ THE CALL, DID YOU

02:39:26.108 --> 02:39:30.203
UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT I WAS 
REFERRING TO? 

02:39:30.204 --> 02:39:34.678
&gt;&gt;  YES, SIR. IT WAS VERY 
CONFUSING TO ME

02:39:39.206 --> 02:39:41.641
WHY THAT WOULD'VE AN ISSUE THAT 
WAS RAISED AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I

02:39:41.842 --> 02:39:43.842
READ THE TRANSCRIPT THAT I 
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PRESIDENT 

02:39:43.876 --> 02:39:46.845
HAD SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL

02:39:50.983 --> 02:39:53.748
WHO WAS REPLACING AND CARVING 
OUT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:39:57.483 --> 02:39:59.776
COLLABORATING WITH SOME OF THE 
CORRUPTION WE SOLVE. 

02:39:59.777 --> 02:40:03.734
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE ALSO SAID THAT  
THIS WAS THE SOURCE OF SOME OF 

02:40:03.911 --> 02:40:08.400
THE PUBLIC VIEWS OF MR. GIULIANI
,  IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:40:08.401 --> 02:40:16.375
&gt;&gt;  YES, SIR, ABOUT TWO WEEKS 
BEFORE THE PRESS WAVED AND 

02:40:16.577 --> 02:40:22.881
BEFORE IT BECAME PUBLIC, THEY 
HAD REPORTED TO US THAT HE WAS 

02:40:23.081 --> 02:40:25.081
SENDING THESE MESSAGES

02:40:28.155 --> 02:40:30.750
AND HAD MET WITH THE AMERICAN 
JOURNALIST TO GET THOSE MESSAGES

02:40:30.932 --> 02:40:33.080
OUT. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE U. S. EMBASSY IN

02:40:33.252 --> 02:40:35.252
UKRAINE'S VIEW 

02:40:37.721 --> 02:40:40.573
OF THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL? 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A GOOD PARTNER  

02:40:40.974 --> 02:40:46.860
AND HAD FAILED TO DELIVER ON THE
PROMISED REFORMS THAT HE HAD 

02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:52.347
COMMITTED TO WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE
AND HE WAS USING HIS OFFICE TO 

02:40:52.547 --> 02:40:54.547
PROTECT POLITICAL ALLIES

02:40:57.835 --> 02:41:01.491
WHILE ENRICHING HIMSELF. 
&gt;&gt;  IS ANOTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE 

02:41:02.248 --> 02:41:04.525
THAT CORRUPT? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

02:41:04.526 --> 02:41:08.593
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF 
EXPERTS  FROM THIS CALL AND THE 

02:41:08.796 --> 02:41:12.246
FIRST ONE OCCURS RIGHT AFTER 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY THANKED 

02:41:12.461 --> 02:41:19.363
PRESIDENT TRUMP  FOR THE SUPPORT
IN THE AREA OF DEFENSE. 

02:41:19.764 --> 02:41:22.556
PRESIDENT TRUMP IMMEDIATELY SAYS
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A 

02:41:22.737 --> 02:41:24.737
FAVOR

02:41:27.290 --> 02:41:29.522
BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN 
THROUGH A LOT IN UKRAINE KNOWS A

02:41:29.765 --> 02:41:32.155
LOT ABOUT IT. I WOULD LIKE YOU 
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH 

02:41:32.356 --> 02:41:34.799
THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH UKRAINE
AND I GUESS YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR

02:41:35.542 --> 02:41:37.542
WEALTHY PEOPLE.

02:41:45.562 --> 02:41:47.562
IS THIS A REFERENCE TO THE 
CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT UKRAINE 

02:41:47.593 --> 02:41:50.228
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 
ELECTION THAT YOU DISCUSSED IN 

02:41:50.443 --> 02:41:52.443
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AS WELL

02:41:58.969 --> 02:42:03.232
?  
&gt;&gt; YES, THAT IS CORRECT.  

02:42:03.233 --> 02:42:08.519
&gt;&gt; IT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT
THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THIS?  

02:42:08.921 --> 02:42:11.157
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; IS IT TRUE THAT SOME OF THE 

02:42:11.358 --> 02:42:13.358
MOST SENIOR ADVISORS OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  HAD INFORMED 

02:42:13.391 --> 02:42:18.462
HIM THAT THIS THEORY OF UKRAINE 
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION WAS

02:42:18.675 --> 02:42:22.729
FALSE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:24.730
&gt;&gt; IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP DISREGARDED THE 

02:42:24.764 --> 02:42:30.063
ADVICE OF HIS  SENIOR OFFICIALS 
ABOUT THIS?  

02:42:30.064 --> 02:42:32.064
&gt;&gt; THAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE, 
YES. 

02:42:37.352 --> 02:42:39.799
&gt;&gt; I WANTED TO SHOW ONE OTHER 
EXHIBIT THAT GOES BACK TO WHAT 

02:42:40.068 --> 02:42:43.250
YOU ARE TESTIFYING EARLIER  
ABOUT RUSSIA'S INTEREST IN 

02:42:43.650 --> 02:42:45.650
PROMOTING THIS. THIS IS AN 
EXPERT

02:42:48.737 --> 02:42:55.028
FROM THE 17 NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN WHERE HE HAS 

02:42:55.777 --> 02:42:57.777
SAID THAT

02:43:00.711 --> 02:43:02.711
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THE 
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTED A 

02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:06.715
UNILATERAL POSITION WITH ONE 
CANDIDATE AND MORE THAN THAT, 

02:43:07.008 --> 02:43:10.952
WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, THEY 

02:43:11.637 --> 02:43:13.637
FUNDED THIS FEMALE CANDIDATE TO 
BE MORE PRECISE.

02:43:18.191 --> 02:43:20.422
MR. HOLMES, YOU SPENT THREE 
YEARS IN THE U. S. EMBASSY IN 

02:43:20.623 --> 02:43:23.584
RUSSIA. I WOULD IT BE TO PUTIN'S
ADVANTAGED

02:43:27.728 --> 02:43:29.561
TO PROMOTE THIS THEORY? 
&gt;&gt; TO DEFLECT FROM RUSSIAN 

02:43:29.562 --> 02:43:34.074
INTERFERENCE  AND TO DRIVE A 
WEDGE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES 

02:43:34.246 --> 02:43:36.246
AND UKRAINE WHICH THEY WANTED TO
GET BACK

02:43:39.715 --> 02:43:42.294
AND THIRDLY TO BESMIRCH UKRAINE 
IN THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP TO 

02:43:42.475 --> 02:43:47.636
DO GREAT IN A ROAD SUPPORT FROM 
OTHER KEY PARTNERS FROM EUROPE 

02:43:47.836 --> 02:43:53.523
AND ELSEWHERE. 
&gt;&gt;  BY PROMOTING THIS THEORY, 

02:43:53.938 --> 02:43:55.938
WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP ADOPTING

02:43:59.623 --> 02:44:01.623
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S VIEW OVER HIS 
OWN SENIOR ADVISORS AND 

02:44:02.009 --> 02:44:05.708
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY 

02:44:05.923 --> 02:44:08.914
CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE 
PHRASE THAT.  THIS IS A VIEW 

02:44:09.085 --> 02:44:13.438
THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN AND THE 
SECURITY SERVICES AND MANY 

02:44:13.638 --> 02:44:18.508
ACTORS HAVE PROMOTED AND I THINK
THIS VIEW HAS SOME TRACTION THAT

02:44:18.707 --> 02:44:25.420
HAS BEEN PARALLEL IN THOSE TWO 
THINGS OVER TIME ARE FUSED 

02:44:25.622 --> 02:44:27.622
TOGETHER. 
&gt;&gt; 

02:44:31.307 --> 02:44:34.154
BACK IN MAY OF THIS YEAR, DO YOU
RECALL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 

02:44:34.355 --> 02:44:39.223
A PHONE CONVERSATION?  
&gt;&gt; I DO. 

02:44:39.224 --> 02:44:43.492
&gt;&gt; THAT HE ALSO MET IN MID-MAY  
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER THAT HAD

02:44:43.705 --> 02:44:47.557
JOINED PRESIDENT PUTIN AT THIS 
CONVERSE? 

02:44:47.558 --> 02:44:49.558
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE 

02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:53.769
TIME  WHEN PRESIDENT ZIELINSKI 
WAS ELECTED ON APRIL 21

02:44:58.324 --> 02:45:00.143
IN HIS INAUGURATION ON MAY 20. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 

02:45:00.144 --> 02:45:03.408
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.  
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, IS IT TRUE THAT HE 

02:45:03.609 --> 02:45:06.978
HAD ASKED  VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION

02:45:10.511 --> 02:45:13.956
AFTER HIS PHONE CALL ON APRIL 
21? 

02:45:13.957 --> 02:45:19.039
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN SAY 
THAT HE HAD ASKED  VICE 

02:45:19.238 --> 02:45:21.689
PRESIDENT PENCE. I WAS NOT IN 
ANY MEETING IN WHICH THAT TOOK 

02:45:21.889 --> 02:45:26.157
PLACE BUT I CAN SAY THAT I 
MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS WERE 

02:45:26.355 --> 02:45:30.845
QUITE EAGER TO HAVE VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE GO TO UKRAINE TO

02:45:31.023 --> 02:45:35.034
REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT.  
&gt;&gt; IS IT ALSO YOUR RECOLLECTION 

02:45:36.724 --> 02:45:41.988
MR. HOLMES THAT YOU WANTED VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE TO ATTEND? 

02:45:41.989 --> 02:45:44.580
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR AND WE UNDERSTOOD 
THAT WAS THE PLAN. 

02:45:44.581 --> 02:45:48.491
&gt;&gt;  JENNIFER WILLIAMS FROM THE 
OFFICE TESTIFIED HERE THAT ON 

02:45:49.254 --> 02:45:53.975
MAY 13 WHICH WAS THE SAME DAY 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH 

02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:57.368
THE PRIME MINISTER THAT THEY 
CALLED OFF TRIPS

02:46:02.916 --> 02:46:05.301
FOR UNKNOWN REASONS BUT BEFORE 
THE INAUGURATION DATE HAD BEEN 

02:46:05.475 --> 02:46:07.475
SCHEDULED

02:46:09.614 --> 02:46:11.986
IN DR. HILL, WERE YOU AWARE THAT
DURING THAT PERIOD

02:46:15.513 --> 02:46:17.946
, THERE WAS A LOT OF PUBLICITY 
AND I THINK YOU REFERENCED THIS 

02:46:18.149 --> 02:46:20.316
IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AS 
WELL ABOUT RUDY GIULIANI'S 

02:46:20.488 --> 02:46:24.444
INTEREST IN THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS? 

02:46:24.445 --> 02:46:26.445
&gt;&gt; I WAS CERTAINLY AWARE, YES. 

02:46:31.559 --> 02:46:33.559
&gt;&gt; AROUND THIS TIME, 

02:46:36.643 --> 02:46:38.643
I BELIEVE YOU ALSO TESTIFIED 
THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON HAD 

02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:44.354
EXPRESSED VIEWS TO YOU ABOUT MR.
GIULIANI'S INTEREST IN UKRAINE. 

02:46:44.756 --> 02:46:50.653
DO YOU RECALL WHAT YOU SAID?  
&gt;&gt; I DO RECALL, IT WAS PART OF A

02:46:51.410 --> 02:46:53.904
CONVERSATION  ABOUT THE THINGS 
THAT THEY WERE SAYING IN PUBLIC 

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:56.104
AND WE SAW THEM

02:46:58.771 --> 02:47:05.070
OR SAW HIM OFTEN MAKING THESE 
STATEMENTS AND I HAD ARTIE 

02:47:05.484 --> 02:47:10.561
BROUGHT HIS ATTENTION THE SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN AND EXPRESSED REGRET 

02:47:10.963 --> 02:47:18.278
ABOUT HOW THIS WAS UNFOLDING IN 
THE SHAMEFUL WAY IN WHICH THEY 

02:47:18.479 --> 02:47:22.544
WERE BEING SMEARED. I HAD ASKED 
IF THERE IS ANYTHING WE COULD DO

02:47:23.145 --> 02:47:29.648
ABOUT IT AND AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
INDICATED WITH BODY LANGUAGE 

02:47:30.061 --> 02:47:33.913
THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD
DO ABOUT IT AND IN THE COURSE OF

02:47:34.113 --> 02:47:36.113
THAT DISCUSSION SAID THAT

02:47:42.244 --> 02:47:44.284
HE WOULD BLOW EVERYONE UP. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE 

02:47:44.475 --> 02:47:45.691
MEANT BY THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

02:47:45.692 --> 02:47:47.692
&gt;&gt;  WHAT? 
&gt;&gt; HE MET THIS WAS EXPLOSIVE IN 

02:47:47.722 --> 02:47:53.421
ANY CASE  AND HE WAS FREQUENTLY 
ON TELEVISION MAKING REMARKS 

02:47:53.822 --> 02:47:55.822
ABOUT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS 
AND CLEARLY PUSHING

02:48:02.154 --> 02:48:04.584
WHAT WOULD PROBABLY COME BACK TO
HAUNT US AND I THINK THAT IS 

02:48:04.785 --> 02:48:08.036
WHERE WE ARE TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; DID THE UKRAINIANS UNDERSTAND

02:48:08.249 --> 02:48:13.516
THAT RUDY GIULIANI REPRESENTED 
THE PRESIDENTS VIEWS  TAX 

02:48:13.517 --> 02:48:15.765
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THEY DID. FIRST HE 
WAS REACHING OUT TO THEM 

02:48:16.534 --> 02:48:25.103
DIRECTLY  IN THE REMOVAL HAVE 
THIS INQUIRY BECAUSE SHE WAS 

02:48:25.302 --> 02:48:29.315
REMOVED FOLLOWING THIS CAMPAIGN 
IN WHICH ASSOCIATES WERE VERY 

02:48:29.489 --> 02:48:36.066
PROMINENT IN CRITICIZING HER FOR
NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY SOME OF THE

02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:43.332
THEORIES AND ISSUES AND WHEN HE 
WAS REMOVED, COMMENTATORS 

02:48:43.519 --> 02:48:45.519
BELIEVED

02:48:50.903 --> 02:48:52.903
IN GETTING HER REMOVED.

02:52:01.037 --> 02:52:03.655
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT QUITE RIGHT. THERE 
WAS SOME MATERIALS RELATED TO 

02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:06.020
UKRAINE. 

02:52:08.151 --> 02:52:10.386
&gt;&gt; THAT PERSON INDICATE THAT I 
THOUGHT THAT WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

02:52:10.587 --> 02:52:15.252
UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS CORRECT.  

02:52:15.253 --> 02:52:16.694
&gt;&gt; WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF 
UKRAINE? 

02:52:16.695 --> 02:52:21.558
&gt;&gt; COLONEL DENMAN. 
&gt;&gt;  WHO DID THIS INDIVIDUAL 

02:52:21.759 --> 02:52:23.759
REFER TO? 
&gt;&gt; 

02:52:27.046 --> 02:52:28.464
THE INDIVIDUAL JUST SAID THE 
NAME CASH. 

02:52:28.465 --> 02:52:32.316
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW WHO THAT WAS? 
&gt;&gt; INITIALLY , I HAD TO SERVE IN

02:52:32.516 --> 02:52:36.786
SEARCH MY MIND BUT ALL I KNEW 
WAS CASH PATEL. 

02:52:36.787 --> 02:52:38.787
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT 

02:52:46.745 --> 02:52:47.961
OVERSEE UKRAINE MATTERS THAT YOU
OVERSAW? 

02:52:47.962 --> 02:52:49.962
&gt;&gt; NOT THAT I OVERSAW. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE PROVIDED SOME 

02:52:49.995 --> 02:52:51.817
INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE 
PRESENT WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE? 

02:52:51.818 --> 02:52:54.264
&gt;&gt;  DISTINCT INDICATION. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE JULY

02:52:54.464 --> 02:52:56.845
25 CALL RIGHT NOW  WHERE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANOTHER EXPERT 

02:52:57.088 --> 02:52:59.088
AT

02:53:01.569 --> 02:53:04.741
HAD ASKED ABOUT JOE BIDEN. IN 
THIS EXPERT

02:53:08.272 --> 02:53:10.504
, BASED ON THE OTHER THINK 
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 

02:53:10.705 --> 02:53:12.705
BIDEN SON THAT HE

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:20.254
TALKED ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF AND
WHAT YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT 

02:53:20.467 --> 02:53:22.689
THAT SO WHATEVER YOU CAN DO 
WOULD BE GREAT. BUT ONE AROUND 

02:53:22.902 --> 02:53:24.923
BRAGGING THAT HE STOPPED THE 
PROSECUTION SO IF YOU COULD LOOK

02:53:25.673 --> 02:53:33.059
INTO IT. NOW, DR. HILL, THIS WAS
ONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT RUDY

02:53:33.261 --> 02:53:35.026
GIULIANI WAS PUSHING, IS THAT 
RIGHT? 

02:53:35.027 --> 02:53:37.027
&gt;&gt; 

02:53:39.145 --> 02:53:40.564
RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; NOW DOES CONFIRM THAT THE 

02:53:40.565 --> 02:53:41.791
PRESIDENT WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN
IT? 

02:53:41.792 --> 02:53:44.227
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt;  AMBASSADORS VOLKER AND 

02:53:44.428 --> 02:53:46.259
SONDLAND HAVE TRIED TO DRAW A 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEIR 

02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:48.260
UNDERSTANDING  OF THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN

02:53:54.794 --> 02:53:57.028
BARIZMA AND THE BIDEN'S BUT WAS 
IT APPEAR TO YOU THAT WHEN 

02:53:57.228 --> 02:53:59.056
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUDY 
GIULIANI OR ANYONE ELSE WAS 

02:53:59.057 --> 02:54:01.898
PUSHING FOR AN INVESTIGATION  
INTO BARIZMA THAT THE REASON 

02:54:02.099 --> 02:54:04.281
THEY WANTED THE INVESTIGATION 
RELATED TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

02:54:07.186 --> 02:54:08.812
SAID? 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY APPARENT THAT IT 

02:54:08.813 --> 02:54:11.242
WAS WHAT RUDY GIULIANI HAD 
INTENDED  AND THAT THEY WERE 

02:54:11.449 --> 02:54:14.291
LINKED TO THE BIDEN AND HE SAID 
THIS REPEATEDLY. 

02:54:14.292 --> 02:54:16.292
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO UNDERSTOOD  THAT

02:54:22.011 --> 02:54:23.429
BARIZMA WAS GO FOR BIDEN'S? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

02:54:23.430 --> 02:54:25.864
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK ANYONE  WOULD 
UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL? 

02:54:25.865 --> 02:54:27.865
&gt;&gt; YES.  
&gt;&gt; 

02:54:30.335 --> 02:54:32.541
DR. HILL, ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY 
EVIDENCE AGAINST

02:54:37.035 --> 02:54:39.003
PRESIDENT BIDEN? 
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT, NO. 

02:54:39.004 --> 02:54:41.004
&gt;&gt;  IN FACT,

02:54:44.954 --> 02:54:48.822
MR. HOLMES, THE FORMER 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF UKRAINE 

02:54:49.223 --> 02:54:51.223
WHO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 
ENCOURAGED TO FIRE

02:54:59.586 --> 02:55:00.803
WAS ACTUALLY CORRUPT, IS THAT 
RIGHT? 

02:55:00.804 --> 02:55:02.219
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; AND WOULD NOT PURSUE 

02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:03.238
CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS AND 
PROSECUTIONS, RIGHT? 

02:55:03.239 --> 02:55:06.000
&gt;&gt; MY UNDERSTANDING  IS THAT THE
PROSECUTOR GENERAL AT THE TIME

02:55:11.161 --> 02:55:13.194
WAS NOT PURSUING INVESTIGATIONS 
OF THE REASON THE OR THE BIDENS.

02:55:13.395 --> 02:55:15.395
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, REMOVING THAT 
PROSECUTOR 

02:55:19.696 --> 02:55:21.696
WAS PART OF THE UNITED STATES 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY. IS THAT 

02:55:21.729 --> 02:55:23.729
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; NOT JUST US BUT ALL OF OUR 

02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:25.986
ALLIES  THAT WERE INVOLVED AT 
THE TIME. 

02:55:25.987 --> 02:55:30.670
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL,  YOU INDICATED THAT
YOU HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT A WHITE 

02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:35.078
HOUSE MEETING WAS CONDITIONED ON
THE PURSUIT BY UKRAINE OF THESE 

02:55:35.252 --> 02:55:37.252
INVESTIGATIONS

02:55:39.194 --> 02:55:44.279
AND I WANTED TO FOCUS ON WHERE 
THAT CAME TO LIGHT. YOU 

02:55:44.479 --> 02:55:46.713
INDICATED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT
THERE WAS A LARGE MEETING THAT 

02:55:46.915 --> 02:55:48.915
AMBASSADOR BOLTON RAN

02:55:55.852 --> 02:55:57.852
WHERE INVESTORS ONLINE AND 
VOLKER AND. HE ATTENDED. IS THAT

02:55:57.886 --> 02:55:58.692
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; IS CORRECT. 

02:55:58.693 --> 02:56:01.288
&gt;&gt; WHY WERE THEY INCLUDED IN 
THAT MEETING  ABOUT NATIONAL 

02:56:01.464 --> 02:56:03.574
SECURITY MATTERS? 
&gt;&gt; THE INITIAL INTENT  WAS TO 

02:56:03.776 --> 02:56:08.987
NOT INCLUDE THEM. THERE WERE A 
NUMBER OF MEETINGS

02:56:14.332 --> 02:56:17.096
AND THAT WAS WITH THE ENERGY 
DEPARTMENT AND A REQUEST TO HAVE

02:56:19.215 --> 02:56:21.215
AMBASSADORS SONDLAND AND 

02:56:23.685 --> 02:56:26.721
VOLKER FROM THEIR OFFICES AND AS
A RESULT OF THAT, GIVEN THE 

02:56:27.470 --> 02:56:33.749
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE ENERGY 
SECTOR AND IN THE DELEGATIONS

02:56:37.493 --> 02:56:38.908
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL 
INAUGURATION, WE DECIDED IT 

02:56:38.909 --> 02:56:43.790
WOULD BE BEST TO INCLUDE ALL 
THREE OF THEM. 

02:56:43.791 --> 02:56:46.174
&gt;&gt; TOWARDS THE END OF THIS 
MEETING, THE UKRAINIANS RAISED 

02:56:50.493 --> 02:56:52.493
THEIR ONGOING DESIRE FOR THE 
OVAL OFFICE MEETING. IS THAT 

02:56:52.528 --> 02:56:55.982
RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

02:56:55.983 --> 02:56:57.398
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THEY DID 
THAT? 

02:56:57.399 --> 02:56:59.634
&gt;&gt; I LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY TO 
THE TESTIMONY YESTERDAY  SO I 

02:56:59.835 --> 02:57:01.835
WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING 
WHERE IT EXPLAINS

02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:07.320
WHY HE HAD A DIFFERENT 
INTERPRETATION OF HOW THIS CAME 

02:57:07.354 --> 02:57:09.498
IN TO BE IN THE MEETING HAD BEEN
SCHEDULED

02:57:14.662 --> 02:57:17.437
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY IN THE 
WRAP UP PHASE IN THE MEETING

02:57:22.126 --> 02:57:24.126
AND ALEXANDER

02:57:27.664 --> 02:57:30.298
IS THE ADVISOR OF UKRAINE AND WE
WANTED TO GET INTO THE MEANS OF 

02:57:30.513 --> 02:57:35.786
HOW HE MIGHT RESPOND WITH THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL AND HE WAS 

02:57:35.988 --> 02:57:37.988
LOOKING AT THE UNITED STATES

02:57:41.887 --> 02:57:46.355
WAS OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS AND 
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN AND ALSO 

02:57:46.556 --> 02:57:48.791
WANTED TO GO THROUGH DISCUSSION 
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO 

02:57:48.991 --> 02:57:53.861
GET THE ENERGY SECTOR REFORM 
UNDERWAY AND TO HAVE SOME 

02:57:54.611 --> 02:58:01.125
TALKING POINTS AND THEN WE KNEW 
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THAT 

02:58:01.304 --> 02:58:03.304
QUESTION

02:58:04.829 --> 02:58:08.558
ABOUT THE MEETING SO AS WE GET 
TO THE MAIN DISCUSSION, WE ARE 

02:58:08.727 --> 02:58:13.767
GOING INTO THAT WRAP UP PHASE 
AND THEY START TO ASK ABOUT 

02:58:13.981 --> 02:58:16.215
WHITE HOUSE MEETINGS AND 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS TRYING TO 

02:58:16.416 --> 02:58:19.390
CARRY US BACK. THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR IS NOT

02:58:25.755 --> 02:58:27.755
IN CHARGE OF SCHEDULING AND WE 
HAVE INPUT RECOMMENDING THE 

02:58:27.789 --> 02:58:30.226
MEETINGS AND THIS GOES TO THE 
WHOLE PROCESS SO IT IS NOT HIS 

02:58:30.427 --> 02:58:36.316
ROLE TO PULL OUT THE SCHEDULE 
AND SAY WE WILL LOOK AT THIS AND

02:58:36.516 --> 02:58:42.418
TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THESE 
MEETINGS, HE LIKES TO LEAVE THEM

02:58:42.619 --> 02:58:44.619
TO THE APPROPRIATE STAFF AND 
THIS WILL ALREADY BE AN 

02:58:45.191 --> 02:58:48.107
UNCOMFORTABLE ISSUE. AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON WAS TRYING TO MOVE THAT 

02:58:48.868 --> 02:58:52.362
DISCUSSION AWAY AND DEFLECTED TO
ANOTHER WRAP-UP TOPIC AND HE 

02:58:53.125 --> 02:58:58.206
LEANED IN TO SAY WE HAVE AN 
AGREEMENT THAT THEY WILL BE 

02:58:58.381 --> 02:59:00.381
MEETING AND THIS IS THE

02:59:06.185 --> 02:59:08.185
SECOND INVESTIGATION PUT 
UNDERWAY AND THAT WAS WHEN I SAW

02:59:08.215 --> 02:59:10.238
AMBASSADOR BOLTON AND I WAS 
SITTING BEHIND HIM IN THE CHAIR 

02:59:10.451 --> 02:59:12.614
AND I SAW HIM SET BACK SLIGHTLY 
LIKE THIS

02:59:16.940 --> 02:59:19.626
AND HE HAD BEEN MOVING FORWARD 
TO THE TABLE AND TO ME THAT WAS 

02:59:19.803 --> 02:59:21.824
UNMISTAKABLE BODY LANGUAGE AND I
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AND THAT HE 

02:59:22.023 --> 02:59:25.676
LOOKS UP TO THE CLOCK AND HIS 
WATCH, I WAS SITTING BEHIND HIM 

02:59:25.877 --> 02:59:29.044
AND BASICALLY HE SAID IT HAS 
BEEN GREAT TO SEE YOU

02:59:37.453 --> 02:59:38.883
BUT I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT ANOTHER 
MEETING. 

02:59:38.884 --> 02:59:40.918
&gt;&gt; DID AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAY 
WHO HIS AGREEMENT ON THIS WHITE 

02:59:41.118 --> 02:59:43.354
HOUSE MEETING WAS WITH? 
&gt;&gt;  I DON'T BELIEVE SO. IT WAS 

02:59:43.554 --> 02:59:49.443
LATER WHICH I'M SURE YOU WILL 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT HE SAID 

02:59:49.643 --> 02:59:51.073
SOMETHING SPECIFIC. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY? 

02:59:51.074 --> 02:59:55.741
&gt;&gt; THAT HE HAD THE CHIEF OF 
STAFF  MEETING.  

02:59:55.742 --> 02:59:59.597
&gt;&gt; WAS HE SPECIFIC AT THAT POINT
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS HE WAS 

02:59:59.797 --> 03:00:01.797
REFERRING TO? 
&gt;&gt; 

03:00:04.883 --> 03:00:05.899
HE SAID INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
BARIZMA. 

03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:08.269
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION 
AFTER THE SUBSEQUENT MEETING 

03:00:11.384 --> 03:00:13.001
?  
&gt;&gt; I HAD DISCUSSION BOTH AFTER 

03:00:13.002 --> 03:00:15.652
THE MEETING IN HIS OFFICE IN A 
VERY BRIEF ONE  BUT THEN A 

03:00:15.851 --> 03:00:16.866
MEETING WITH THE SUBSEQUENT 
MEETING. 

03:00:16.867 --> 03:00:22.352
&gt;&gt;  THE SUBSEQUENT MEETING WHEN 
YOU SPOKE TO HIM AND RELAYED TO 

03:00:22.552 --> 03:00:24.552
HIM WHAT AMBASSADOR

03:00:28.648 --> 03:00:30.480
SONDLAND SAID, WHAT DID 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON SAY TO YOU? 

03:00:30.481 --> 03:00:32.716
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT  
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WANTED ME TO 

03:00:32.916 --> 03:00:35.262
HOLD BACK IN THE ROOM AND I WAS 
SITTING

03:00:43.272 --> 03:00:45.104
WITH A COLLEAGUE. 
&gt;&gt; JUST IN THAT SECOND MEETING, 

03:00:45.105 --> 03:00:47.135
WHAT DID HE SAY? 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS MAKING A STRONG POINT 

03:00:47.336 --> 03:00:49.974
OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID  AND WHEN
I CAME BACK, HE HAD SPECIFIC 

03:00:50.173 --> 03:00:53.976
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ME.  
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT? 

03:00:53.977 --> 03:00:59.269
&gt;&gt;  IT WAS THAT I HAD TO GO TO 
THE LAWYERS WITH THE SENIOR 

03:00:59.448 --> 03:01:01.448
COUNSEL

03:01:04.810 --> 03:01:12.728
TO SAY I AM NOT PART OF WHATEVER
DRUG DEAL THAT THEY ARE COOKING 

03:01:12.929 --> 03:01:14.345
UP. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 

03:01:14.346 --> 03:01:19.633
TO MEAN  WITH THE JUDGE OF THAT 
THEY WERE COOKING UP? 

03:01:19.634 --> 03:01:24.303
&gt;&gt; I TOOK IT TO MEAN 
INVESTIGATIONS  FOR A MEETING. 

03:01:24.504 --> 03:01:28.157
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SPEAK TO THE LAWYERS?
&gt;&gt; I CERTAINLY DID.  

03:01:28.158 --> 03:01:29.991
&gt;&gt; YOU RELATE EVERYTHING THAT 
YOU JUST TOLD US? 

03:01:29.992 --> 03:01:35.480
&gt;&gt;  I RELAYED IT PRECISELY IN 
THE DETAILS OF HOW THE MEETING 

03:01:35.727 --> 03:01:37.657
UNFOLDED AND I GIVE A FULL 
DESCRIPTION. 

03:01:37.658 --> 03:01:42.497
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, YOU HAVE 
TESTIFIED THAT BY LATE AUGUST, 

03:01:42.666 --> 03:01:44.666
YOU HAD A CLEAR IMPRESSION

03:01:47.455 --> 03:01:49.455
THAT THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
HOLD WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO 

03:01:49.843 --> 03:01:53.142
THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED. HOW DID 

03:01:53.891 --> 03:01:58.364
YOU CONCLUDE OR MAKE THAT CLEAR 
CONCLUSION? 

03:01:58.365 --> 03:02:00.365
&gt;&gt; 

03:02:02.898 --> 03:02:06.711
WE HAD BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATION SINCE MARCH MONTHS

03:02:06.883 --> 03:02:12.343
BEFORE AND THERE WAS A LETTER 
FROM THE PRESIDENT

03:02:16.094 --> 03:02:18.142
SAYING HE WAS PLEASED TO MEET 
HIM FOLLOWING THE INAUGURATION 

03:02:18.689 --> 03:02:23.948
IN MAY AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO GET THAT MEETING AND THEN

03:02:27.682 --> 03:02:31.694
SOMETHING CAME UP WITH NO 
EXPEDITION AND WE DISCUSSED 

03:02:31.863 --> 03:02:33.863
EARLIER

03:02:37.022 --> 03:02:39.611
THAT WHEN THEY RECEIVED NO 
EXPLANATION FOR WHY THAT WAS IN 

03:02:39.850 --> 03:02:41.850
PLACE

03:02:44.939 --> 03:02:46.155
THAT THEY WOULD DRAW THAT 
CONCLUSION. 

03:02:46.156 --> 03:02:48.156
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS 
WERE STILL BEING PURSUED IN THE 

03:02:48.191 --> 03:02:51.041
HOLD WAS STILL REMAINING WITHOUT
ANY EXPLANATION? 

03:02:51.042 --> 03:02:52.861
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; SO THIS WAS THE ONLY LOGICAL 

03:02:52.862 --> 03:02:54.692
CONCLUSION THAT YOU COULD REACH?
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. 

03:02:54.693 --> 03:02:56.693
&gt;&gt; KIND OF LIKE 

03:03:00.781 --> 03:03:01.797
2+2 = 4? 
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. 

03:03:01.798 --> 03:03:04.031
&gt;&gt; THAT INCLUDES THE QUESTIONING
AND WE ARE EXPECTED HAVE VOTES  

03:03:04.255 --> 03:03:06.479
FAIRLY SOON. THIS WOULD BE AN 
APPROPRIATE TIME TO BREAK AND WE

03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:12.570
WILL RESUME AND IF PEOPLE BEFORE
THEY LEAVE COULD ALLOW THE 

03:03:12.770 --> 03:03:16.177
WITNESSES TO LEAVE FIRST AND THE
COMMITTEE MEMBERS COULD COME 

03:03:16.364 --> 03:03:18.364
BACK PROMPTLY AFTER VOTES.

03:03:57.263 --> 03:03:59.263
&gt;&gt; THE MEETING WILL BE IN 
RECESS. 

05:01:21.605 --> 05:01:26.073
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MEETING WILL COME TO 
ORDER. THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES 

05:01:26.489 --> 05:01:30.546
THE NEXT ROUND FOR QUESTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GET A FEW BASIC  

05:01:31.106 --> 05:01:36.587
FACTS WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT 
WERE INVOLVED IN THE 2016 

05:01:36.762 --> 05:01:42.565
ELECTION JUST TO SEE WHO YOU 
KNOW AND WHO YOU HAVE MET WITH. 

05:01:42.747 --> 05:01:49.498
I WILL START WITH YOU, MR. 
HOLMES. DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDRA 

05:01:50.182 --> 05:01:52.182
CHALUPA ?

05:01:56.138 --> 05:01:57.553
&gt;&gt; COULD YOU PUT YOUR MICROPHONE
ON? 

05:01:57.554 --> 05:02:00.929
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt;  DO YOU KNOW

05:02:05.040 --> 05:02:07.040
NELLY ORE?

05:02:09.201 --> 05:02:11.201
BRUCE ORE?

05:02:13.354 --> 05:02:16.648
GLEN SIMPSON? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

05:02:16.649 --> 05:02:22.135
&gt;&gt; SAME THING FOR YOU  DR. HILL,
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDRA CHALUPA? 

05:02:22.898 --> 05:02:30.215
&gt;&gt;  NELLY ORE? 
&gt;&gt; NO.  

05:02:30.216 --> 05:02:37.532
&gt;&gt;  BRUCE ORE? 
&gt;&gt; ONLY FROM YEARS AGO . 

05:02:37.533 --> 05:02:39.897
&gt;&gt;  GLEN SIMPSON?

05:02:44.478 --> 05:02:46.110
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID IN YOUR DEPOSITION 

05:02:46.111 --> 05:02:48.111
THAT CHRISTOPHER STEELE  WAS 
YOUR COUNTERPART

05:02:52.815 --> 05:02:54.847
AT ONE TIME. IS THIS CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:02:54.848 --> 05:02:56.848
&gt;&gt; TESTIFIED THAT YOU MET WITH 

05:03:01.743 --> 05:03:03.777
CHRISTOPHER STEELE IN 2016 AND I
ASSUME THAT IS STILL CORRECT. 

05:03:03.977 --> 05:03:06.212
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING WE DID NOT GET

05:03:06.426 --> 05:03:09.266
IS  DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WHEN THAT 
WAS IN 2016 AND HOW MANY TIMES? 

05:03:09.464 --> 05:03:12.039
&gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID I DON'T.  I 
ACTUALLY MET WITH HIM AND YOU 

05:03:12.315 --> 05:03:17.587
ASKED ME THE DEPOSITION THE MOST
RECENT TIME IN 2016 AND HE 

05:03:17.800 --> 05:03:21.855
RETIRED FROM THE RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES IN 2009. 

05:03:22.054 --> 05:03:25.041
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, I'M ASKING ABOUT 2016.
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT RECALL. 

05:03:29.171 --> 05:03:31.337
I DID MEET BUT I DON'T REMEMBER 
THE DATE.

05:03:36.892 --> 05:03:39.188
&gt;&gt; YOU STATED IN YOUR DEPOSITION
THAT A COLLEAGUE HAD SHOWED YOU 

05:03:39.367 --> 05:03:41.367
THE STILL DOSSIER BEFORE IT WAS 
PUBLISHED.  WHO WAS THAT 

05:03:41.565 --> 05:03:43.597
COLLEAGUE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS ONE OF MY  

05:03:44.000 --> 05:03:45.015
COLLEAGUES AT THE BOOKING 
INSTITUTION. 

05:03:45.016 --> 05:03:48.670
&gt;&gt; WHO WAS THAT?  
&gt;&gt;  THAT WAS PRESIDENT STROBE 

05:03:49.432 --> 05:03:53.744
THAT HAD BEEN SENT A COPY TO 
THIS. THAT WAS THE DAY BEFORE IT

05:03:54.495 --> 05:03:56.495
WAS PUBLISHED.

05:03:58.212 --> 05:04:00.212
&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR 
DEPOSITION THAT YOU THOUGHT IT 

05:04:00.811 --> 05:04:07.105
WAS  -- THIS IS AN EXACT QUOTE, 
"THAT THE DOSSIER WAS A RABBIT 

05:04:07.285 --> 05:04:10.962
HOLE."  
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

05:04:10.963 --> 05:04:13.368
&gt;&gt;  DO YOU KNOW WHO PAID

05:04:18.121 --> 05:04:20.340
TO GENERATE THE STEEL DOSSIERS 
FOR SEVERAL OF THEM?

05:04:24.825 --> 05:04:27.462
&gt;&gt; AT THE TIME I DID NOT KNOW 
BUT I UNDERSTAND FROM THE MEDIA 

05:04:27.676 --> 05:04:30.559
THAT IT WAS DUE GPS FUSION AND 
IF THAT IS NOT CORRECT  -- 

05:04:30.560 --> 05:04:32.946
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LAW FIRM 
INVOLVED.  DO YOU KNOW WHO THE 

05:04:33.160 --> 05:04:35.995
SOURCE OF THE MONEY WAS? 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT AT THE TIME.  I'VE 

05:04:36.197 --> 05:04:40.723
READ THE REPORTS AND THANKS TO 
YOUR COLLEAGUES AS WELL THAT IT 

05:04:40.901 --> 05:04:42.702
WAS THE DNC AS I AM LED TO 
BELIEVE. 

05:04:42.703 --> 05:04:45.501
&gt;&gt; AND EQUIPMENT  CAMPAIGN? 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE. 

05:04:52.243 --> 05:04:54.478
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME 
BACK FROM LUNCH. I HOPE YOU HAD 

05:04:54.690 --> 05:04:56.109
TO WHICH IS OR SOMETHING 
DELICIOUS.  

05:04:56.110 --> 05:04:58.744
&gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU DID  TOO. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE  

05:04:59.308 --> 05:05:04.663
AND PARTICIPATION. WE WERE WITH 
YOU MOST OF THE DAY SO I 

05:05:05.400 --> 05:05:09.104
APPRECIATE THAT. MR. HOLMES, 
THANK YOU AS WELL. YOU ARE A 

05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:12.955
LATE ENTRANCE INTO THE SITUATION

05:05:16.827 --> 05:05:18.827
AND THINGS STARTED ESCALATE 
QUICKLY. WE SPOKE WITH YOU LAST 

05:05:19.422 --> 05:05:26.169
FRIDAY NIGHT ABOUT WHAT WE 
THOUGHT WOULD BE A 32nd THING 

05:05:26.369 --> 05:05:33.889
AND IT TURNS OUT WITH YOUR 40 
MINUTE OPENER THAT YOU HAVE A 

05:05:34.089 --> 05:05:36.659
LOT OF INFORMATION TO SHARE SO 
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.

05:05:42.011 --> 05:05:44.245
DR. HILL, YOUR LAST DAY AT THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WAS ON

05:05:44.447 --> 05:05:46.277
JULY 19, IS THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT.  

05:05:46.278 --> 05:05:49.416
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH THE 
JULY 25 CALL  BUT YOU WEREN'T 

05:05:49.588 --> 05:05:53.795
INVOLVED WITH ANY OF THE 
RELEVANT ACTIVITIES WITH THE 

05:05:54.048 --> 05:05:58.463
PAUSE IN THE AID? 
&gt;&gt;  THAT IS CORRECT. 

05:05:58.464 --> 05:06:04.152
&gt;&gt; DID YOU BELIEVE THAT A CALL 
WAS GOING TO BE SCHEDULED  FOR 

05:06:04.395 --> 05:06:05.984
THE 25th? 
&gt;&gt; I PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE 

05:06:05.985 --> 05:06:08.620
IT WOULD BE SCHEDULED THAT DAY, 
NO.  

05:06:08.621 --> 05:06:12.688
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE THINKING AT THE 
NFC AS OF JULY 19  ABOUT THIS 

05:06:12.888 --> 05:06:14.305
CALL? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE LEARNED FROM OTHER 

05:06:14.306 --> 05:06:17.555
DEPOSITIONS  TO BE CLEAR HERE 
THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME 

05:06:17.768 --> 05:06:20.606
AWARENESS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A 
CALL AND INVESTOR SONDLAND AS 

05:06:20.807 --> 05:06:23.577
YOU MAY RECALL  SHARED AN 
EXCHANGE WITH THE PERSON

05:06:28.731 --> 05:06:31.165
THAT INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD 
BE A CALL COMING BUT I WAS NOT 

05:06:31.378 --> 05:06:34.413
AWARE OF THAT. THERE WERE 
DIFFERENCES LET'S JUST SAY IN 

05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:39.297
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT CALL. 
&gt;&gt; WERE YOU IN FAVOR OF SUCH A 

05:06:39.497 --> 05:06:41.497
CALL? 
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, I WAS NOT 

05:06:44.582 --> 05:06:47.017
AND I DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 
THAT IN THE OPENING PART OF THE 

05:06:47.220 --> 05:06:48.635
SESSION TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT AMBASSADOR BOLTON 

05:06:48.636 --> 05:06:50.636
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE?  
&gt;&gt; I KNOW INVESTOR SONDLAND SAID

05:06:50.671 --> 05:06:53.306
IN THE EMAIL THAT  BOLTON WAS IN
AGREEMENT BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, 

05:06:53.520 --> 05:06:55.520
HE WAS NOT IN AGREEMENT

05:07:00.422 --> 05:07:02.243
TO MY KNOWLEDGE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT HIS DEPOSITION 

05:07:02.244 --> 05:07:04.074
WAS? 
&gt;&gt; BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT WAS

05:07:04.075 --> 05:07:06.313
NOT PROPERLY PREPARED AND WE 
WANTED TO MAKE SURE  THAT THEY 

05:07:06.520 --> 05:07:08.547
WOULD BE AN AGENDA THAT WAS 
DISCUSSED WHICH IS USUAL WITH 

05:07:08.764 --> 05:07:11.316
THESE CALLS. 
&gt;&gt;  WERE YOU SURPRISED

05:07:16.869 --> 05:07:18.098
THAT A CALL ULTIMATELY WAS 
SCHEDULED? 

05:07:18.099 --> 05:07:19.719
&gt;&gt; I WAS WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT 
IT. 

05:07:19.720 --> 05:07:21.720
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE ANY 
COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE  ABOUT

05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:23.785
HOW THAT CAME TO BE? 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT.  

05:07:23.786 --> 05:07:26.140
&gt;&gt; YOU DID LEARN  ABOUT THE PODS
IN THE

05:07:30.275 --> 05:07:32.275
SECURITY ASSISTANCE AID. 
&gt;&gt; I LEARNED ABOUT THAT JULY 18,

05:07:32.309 --> 05:07:34.344
THE DAY BEFORE I LEFT.  
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE SEVERAL MEETINGS 

05:07:34.543 --> 05:07:38.811
ABOUT THIS  I BELIEVE YOU 
TESTIFIED TO. 

05:07:38.812 --> 05:07:42.879
&gt;&gt; I SAID I KNEW THERE WOULD BE 
A MEETING  AND THERE WAS ONE PUT

05:07:43.080 --> 05:07:47.949
UNDER THE SCHEDULE SO I DIDN'T 
ATTEND THAT. 

05:07:47.950 --> 05:07:53.237
&gt;&gt; IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IT 
STOPS AND STARTS  IN A LIKE THIS

05:07:53.438 --> 05:07:57.503
AND THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

05:07:57.504 --> 05:08:00.221
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE YOU TESTIFIED THAT 
THERE WAS A FREEZE PUT ON ALL 

05:08:00.396 --> 05:08:02.974
KINDS OF AID  AND ASSISTANCE 
BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE PROCESS

05:08:06.848 --> 05:08:08.848
AND AT THAT TIME THERE WERE 
SIGNIFICANT REVIEWS OF FOREIGN 

05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:10.701
ASSISTANCE GOING ON? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ALSO CORRECT.  

05:08:10.702 --> 05:08:12.533
&gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT THAT? 

05:08:12.534 --> 05:08:17.003
&gt;&gt;  AS I UNDERSTOOD, BEING A 
DIRECTIVE FOR A WHOLE SCALE 

05:08:17.205 --> 05:08:21.407
REVIEW OF THE FOREIGN POLICY AND
THE ASSISTANT IN THE TIES

05:08:25.129 --> 05:08:26.744
BETWEEN THE FOREIGN POLICY 
OBJECTIVES IN THE ASSISTANCE, 

05:08:26.745 --> 05:08:29.181
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY 
MONTHS AND IT APPEARED WHEN I 

05:08:29.392 --> 05:08:32.131
WAS WRAPPING UP MY TIME THAT 
THERE HAS BEEN MORE SCRUTINY 

05:08:32.434 --> 05:08:37.611
THAN SPECIFIC ASSISTANCE AND THE
RESULT OF THE OVERALL REVIEW. 

05:08:37.783 --> 05:08:42.928
&gt;&gt; AT THIS TIME AS WELL , 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND AMBASSADOR

05:08:43.604 --> 05:08:47.011
SONDLAND HAD BECOME A LITTLE 
MORE  INVOLVED WITH UKRAINE 

05:08:47.182 --> 05:08:49.704
POLICY? 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR VOLKER WAS ALWAYS 

05:08:50.468 --> 05:08:54.106
INVOLVED  IN UKRAINE POLICY ONLY
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HIS 

05:08:54.282 --> 05:08:57.821
APPOINTMENT WITH THE 
NEGOTIATIONS TOWARDS THE WALL 

05:08:58.038 --> 05:09:03.109
BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 

05:09:03.309 --> 05:09:06.963
AMBASSADOR VOLKER? 
&gt;&gt;  HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY 

05:09:07.379 --> 05:09:10.149
ACCOMPLISHED DIPLOMAT. I WORKED 
WITH HIM PREVIOUSLY AND

05:09:14.287 --> 05:09:16.721
HE HAS HAD A NUMBER OF POSITIONS
WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND I 

05:09:16.922 --> 05:09:18.922
KNOW HIM PERSONALLY.

05:09:22.407 --> 05:09:25.041
WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO 
KNOW TO AND WHO'S MET WHO, I 

05:09:25.253 --> 05:09:27.253
KNOW PERSONAL LEVEL

05:09:31.341 --> 05:09:33.341
MR. VOLKER. 
&gt;&gt; YOU SAY HE IS ALWAYS ACT IN 

05:09:33.378 --> 05:09:34.794
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED 
STATES? 

05:09:34.795 --> 05:09:37.632
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.  
&gt;&gt; WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARN OF  

05:09:38.046 --> 05:09:41.085
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND IS  
INVOLVEMENT? 

05:09:41.086 --> 05:09:44.135
&gt;&gt; IT CAME IN WAVES. HE HAD  
LOGICAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE 

05:09:44.901 --> 05:09:49.008
UKRAINE PORTFOLIO AND WILL WORK 
CLOSELY WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION 

05:09:49.224 --> 05:09:53.839
ON MATTERS RELATED TO UKRAINE IN
THE UKRAINIAN DIALOGUE WITH 

05:09:54.014 --> 05:09:59.578
RUSSIA WAS IN A FORMAT WHICH WAS
LED BY THE FRENCH AND THE 

05:09:59.780 --> 05:10:04.056
GERMANS AND AMBASSADOR VOLKER 
WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE HE 

05:10:04.248 --> 05:10:08.718
COULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE 
FRENCH AND GERMANS TO MOVE ALONG

05:10:08.918 --> 05:10:11.768
THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT 
BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA WILL 

05:10:11.969 --> 05:10:16.182
AND OFFICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
AS THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION FOR

05:10:16.360 --> 05:10:19.800
EUROPE IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND 
ASSISTANCE WAS HEAVILY ACTIVE

05:10:24.963 --> 05:10:26.795
IN OFFERING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
TO THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT AS 

05:10:26.796 --> 05:10:28.833
WELL AS HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
IN THE CONFLICT SO IT WAS 

05:10:29.597 --> 05:10:33.703
PERFECTLY LOGICAL BUT THEY 
PLAYED SOME KIND OF ROLE TO THE 

05:10:33.904 --> 05:10:37.357
EUROPEAN UNION. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS  

05:10:37.770 --> 05:10:42.442
WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO YOU
AS SOMEBODY WITH A MAJOR ROLE?  

05:10:42.978 --> 05:10:48.275
&gt;&gt;  I DID AT THE TIME IN WHICH 
HE PRESENTED IT TO ME. THIS WAS 

05:10:48.457 --> 05:10:52.585
AFTER AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH WAS
PUSHED OUT OF HER  POSITION AND 

05:10:53.339 --> 05:10:55.339
IT WAS SONDLAND'S ROLE 

05:10:58.488 --> 05:11:00.488
TO GROW LARGER. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU FIRST ANY CONCERNS TO

05:11:00.927 --> 05:11:02.138
HIM  DIRECTLY? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

05:11:02.139 --> 05:11:08.028
&gt;&gt; WHAT WERE THOSE  CONCERNS? 
&gt;&gt; I ASKED HIM QUITE BLUNTLY IN 

05:11:08.228 --> 05:11:12.698
A MEETING WE HAD IN JUNE 2019  
AND THIS IS AFTER THE 

05:11:12.899 --> 05:11:14.935
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION WHEN I
HAD SEEN THAT HE HAD STARTED TO 

05:11:15.134 --> 05:11:18.388
STEP UP AND MUCH MORE OF A 
PROACTIVE ROLE ON UKRAINE WITH 

05:11:18.627 --> 05:11:22.454
WHAT HIS ROLE WAS HERE AND HE 
SAID HE WAS IN CHARGE OF UKRAINE

05:11:22.657 --> 05:11:28.969
AND I SAID WHO PUT YOU IN CHARGE
AND HE SAID THE PRESIDENT. 

05:11:28.970 --> 05:11:30.985
&gt;&gt; DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU WHAT 
HE TOLD YOU THAT? 

05:11:30.986 --> 05:11:34.645
&gt;&gt; IT DID SURPRISE ME  BECAUSE 
WE HAD NO DIRECTIVE AND HAD NOT 

05:11:34.845 --> 05:11:36.845
BEEN TOLD THIS AND AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON HAD NEVER INDICATED IN 

05:11:36.878 --> 05:11:38.878
ANY WAY THAT HE THOUGHT 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND WAS PLAYING 

05:11:38.935 --> 05:11:41.953
A LEADING ROLE.  
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE USE THE TERM A 

05:11:42.717 --> 05:11:47.437
LARGE  REMIT THAT HE 
CHARACTERIZE HE HAD BEEN GIVEN A

05:11:47.638 --> 05:11:51.906
LARGE REMIT? 
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT  IT WAS 

05:11:52.104 --> 05:11:55.356
PORTFOLIO AND THESE ARE ALL 
SYNONYMS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 

05:11:55.556 --> 05:11:58.405
THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN GIVEN 
A BROAD PORTFOLIO AND HE SAID 

05:11:58.606 --> 05:12:04.492
HIS JOB WAS TO GO OUT AND MAKE 
DEALS AND I LISTEN TO HIS 

05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:07.496
TESTIMONY VERY CAREFULLY AS WELL
BUT HE SAID ANYTHING THAT HAD TO

05:12:07.669 --> 05:12:09.701
DO WITH THE EU ITSELF IN THE 
EUROPEAN

05:12:14.249 --> 05:12:15.265
MEMBERSHIP WAS WITHIN HIS 
PORTFOLIO. 

05:12:15.266 --> 05:12:17.266
&gt;&gt; WE ASKED AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
IN HIS DEPOSITION AND HE 

05:12:17.289 --> 05:12:20.956
CONCEDED  THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN 
SPINNING A LITTLE BIT WHEN HE 

05:12:21.154 --> 05:12:25.009
SAID THE PRESIDENT SPECIFICALLY 
GAVE HIM THAT ROLE AND HE 

05:12:25.222 --> 05:12:29.889
INDICATED THAT HIS AUTHORITY WAS
COMING MORE FROM THE SECRETARY 

05:12:30.648 --> 05:12:32.648
OF STATE.

05:12:35.776 --> 05:12:37.810
AT ANY POINT IN TIME, WAS THAT 
RELATED TO YOU? 

05:12:37.811 --> 05:12:39.811
&gt;&gt; AT DIFFERENT POINTS, HE 
MENTIONED TALKING  DIRECTLY TO 

05:12:39.843 --> 05:12:45.127
THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND SECRETARY
POMPEO BUT THERE WERE OTHER 

05:12:45.327 --> 05:12:47.362
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM IN THE 
MEETING IN WHICH HE ASSERTED 

05:12:47.563 --> 05:12:51.829
THIS TO ME THAT IT WAS THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HAD PUT HIM IN 

05:12:52.032 --> 05:12:54.866
CHARGE OF THIS. 
&gt;&gt; WERE YOU ENCOURAGED AS OF 

05:12:55.083 --> 05:12:58.937
YOUR LAST DAY IN OFFICE  THAT U.
S. POLICY TOWARDS UKRAINE WAS 

05:12:59.138 --> 05:13:02.585
HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? 
&gt;&gt;  I WAS NOT. 

05:13:02.586 --> 05:13:05.035
&gt;&gt; WHY WAS THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS CONCERNED  ABOUT TWO 

05:13:05.238 --> 05:13:10.447
THINGS IN PARTICULAR. ONE WAS 
THE REMOVAL OF THE AMBASSADOR

05:13:14.176 --> 05:13:16.611
AND AGAIN I WILL SAY FOR THE 
RECORD THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A 

05:13:16.812 --> 05:13:18.844
PERFECT RIGHT TO REMOVE ANY 
AMBASSADOR AT ANY TIME FOR ANY 

05:13:19.046 --> 05:13:21.079
REASON BUT I WAS VERY CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH

05:13:21.282 --> 05:13:23.282
HER REPUTATION HAD BEEN MALIGNED

05:13:27.169 --> 05:13:29.202
REPEATEDLY ON TELEVISION AND ALL
KINDS OF EXCHANGES AND I THOUGHT

05:13:29.401 --> 05:13:31.232
THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO 

05:13:31.233 --> 05:13:35.089
REMOVE AN INVESTOR WHICH HE DID 
QUITE FREQUENTLY WITH THOSE THAT

05:13:35.290 --> 05:13:39.356
WERE NOT POLITICAL BUT CAREER 
OFFICIALS AND THAT WAS THAT BUT 

05:13:39.557 --> 05:13:41.618
WITHOUT THESE KINDS OF 
INTERVENTIONS. I WONDERED WHAT 

05:13:41.791 --> 05:13:46.062
MESSAGE WAS BEING SENT AND THEN 
IN THE SECOND FRONT, IT WAS VERY

05:13:46.263 --> 05:13:48.263
CLEAR AT THIS POINT

05:13:51.347 --> 05:13:53.168
THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT 
CHANNEL IN OPERATION IN 

05:13:53.169 --> 05:13:56.016
RELATIONS TO UKRAINE. ONE THAT 
WAS DOMESTIC AND POLITICAL IN 

05:13:56.218 --> 05:14:00.889
NATURE AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM 
THE CHANNEL OR LOOP HOWEVER YOU 

05:14:01.088 --> 05:14:03.736
LIKE IT BUT MY AND MY COLLEAGUES
WERE IN WHERE WE ARE FOCUSED ON 

05:14:03.936 --> 05:14:09.620
RELATIONS AND U. S. POLICY 
TOWARDS UKRAINE AND THESE THINGS

05:14:09.821 --> 05:14:12.414
HAD DIVERSE AT THIS POINT. 
&gt;&gt; IN THE RUN TO AMBASSADOR 

05:14:15.921 --> 05:14:17.753
YOVANOVITCH SEPARATION, DID YOU 
HAVE ANY CAN VACATION WITH 

05:14:17.754 --> 05:14:19.754
OFFICIALS AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS? 

05:14:20.790 --> 05:14:22.623
&gt;&gt; I DID. 
&gt;&gt; WHO DID YOU REALLY THOSE 

05:14:22.624 --> 05:14:27.709
CONCERNS TO?  
&gt;&gt; TO MY COUNTERPART  WHO I KNOW

05:14:27.907 --> 05:14:30.465
YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO. I ALSO HAVE 
SPOKE TO DEBBIE HALE

05:14:34.612 --> 05:14:37.163
WITH LARGER ISSUES AS WELL AND 
HAVE A BROAD PORTFOLIO MYSELF.

05:14:41.919 --> 05:14:45.775
WE WOULD TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUAL 
ITEMS THAT I HAVE PRIVATE 

05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:48.499
SESSIONS WITH THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY AND HE APPEARED WITH 

05:14:49.187 --> 05:14:54.714
HIS NOMINATION AND HAS SPOKEN 
ABOUT THAT HIMSELF. 

05:14:54.715 --> 05:14:59.594
&gt;&gt; YOU ADVOCATED ALL OF THOSE 
OFFICIALS  ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS 

05:14:59.996 --> 05:15:02.632
ABOUT THE INFORMATION BEING 
SPREAD ABOUT AMBASSADOR 

05:15:03.046 --> 05:15:07.517
YOVANOVITCH? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

05:15:07.518 --> 05:15:09.137
&gt;&gt; THE TERM ADMINISTRATION 
CHANGE COURSES FROM ITS 

05:15:09.138 --> 05:15:11.138
PREDECESSOR  AND PROVIDED

05:15:13.604 --> 05:15:15.604
DEFENSIVE ASSISTANCE TO THE 
UKRAINE. WERE YOU IN FAVOR OF 

05:15:15.639 --> 05:15:18.273
ARMING THE UKRAINIANS?  
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT INITIALLY IN 2015  

05:15:18.487 --> 05:15:23.355
BEFORE I JOINED THE GOVERNMENT 
AND I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE ON THE 

05:15:23.557 --> 05:15:26.155
COMMITTEE HAVE SEEN THAT I WROTE
AN OPINION PIECE WITH A 

05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:28.967
COLLEAGUE IN THAT JUNCTURE 
BECAUSE I WAS VERY WORRIED THAT

05:15:33.111 --> 05:15:35.133
AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME
THAT THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY WAS 

05:15:35.346 --> 05:15:37.581
NOT IN THE STATE TO TAKE ON 
THOSE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS 

05:15:37.824 --> 05:15:41.438
BEING DEFENSIVE OR OFFENSIVE 
WEAPONS AND I WAS WORRIED THAT 

05:15:41.636 --> 05:15:45.903
THERE WAS NOT A LONG-TERM 
SUSTAINABLE PLAN GIVING THE 

05:15:46.103 --> 05:15:47.986
OVERLY FORCE THAT THE RUSSIANS 
COULD APPLY AGAINST THE 

05:15:47.987 --> 05:15:49.987
UKRAINIANS. HOWEVER, WHEN I CAME
INTO GOVERNMENT

05:15:53.220 --> 05:15:55.654
IN 2016 AND STARTED TO INTERACT 
WITH ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

05:15:55.855 --> 05:15:59.307
PENTAGON, I REALIZED IN FACT 
THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN AWFUL LOT

05:15:59.507 --> 05:16:05.196
OF WORK DONE ON THIS IN THE LAWS
ARE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT TO PLAN

05:16:05.411 --> 05:16:08.663
FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY LONG-TERM
OF THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY SO I 

05:16:08.859 --> 05:16:13.528
CHANGED MY MIND. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY,  I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE 

05:16:13.729 --> 05:16:15.963
ONLY WITNESS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ARTICULATE

05:16:16.577 --> 05:16:19.185
THE OPPOSITION AND PROVIDING THE
JAVELINS AND AS WE UNDERSTAND IT

05:16:21.246 --> 05:16:22.663
, DURING THE OBAMA 
DEMONSTRATION, THE AGENCY 

05:16:22.664 --> 05:16:27.959
CONSENSUS WAS IN FACT TO PROVIDE
THE JAVELINS BUT THEY WERE NOT 

05:16:28.148 --> 05:16:29.982
PROVIDED. WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT
DECISION BACK THEN? 

05:16:29.983 --> 05:16:33.036
&gt;&gt;  I WAS THEN I THINK IT WAS 
WHEN ON A LOCAL BASIS TO PROVOKE

05:16:33.236 --> 05:16:36.488
THE RUSSIANS DEPENDING ON HOW 
THIS WAS PRESENTED AND WE WERE 

05:16:36.687 --> 05:16:41.769
VERY MINDFUL OF THAT WHEN THERE 
WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE 

05:16:41.970 --> 05:16:47.196
LETHAL DEFENSIVE WEAPONS.  
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, YOU ARE ON THE 

05:16:47.376 --> 05:16:49.376
GROUND AND

05:16:51.715 --> 05:16:53.715
THE JAVELINS HAVE BEEN 
AUTHORIZED AND PROVIDED. WHAT IS

05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:59.036
THE VIEW FROM THE FIELD OF THE 
U. S. EMBASSY AS TO THE 

05:16:59.236 --> 05:17:01.236
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE JAVELINS? 
&gt;&gt; 

05:17:06.344 --> 05:17:08.344
THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC 
DETERRENT. THEY ARE NOT ACTIVELY

05:17:08.377 --> 05:17:10.954
EMPLOYED IN COMBAT OPERATIONS 
RIGHT NOW BUT THE MERE IDEA THAT

05:17:11.316 --> 05:17:13.661
WERE THE RUSSIANS TO ADVANCE 
SUBSTANTIALLY, UKRAINIANS WOULD 

05:17:13.862 --> 05:17:20.766
HAVE THIS CAPABILITY AND THAT 
DETERS THEM FROM DOING SO AND 

05:17:20.967 --> 05:17:22.967
ALSO SENDS AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL 
OR SYMBOLIC MESSAGE TO THE 

05:17:23.560 --> 05:17:26.250
UKRAINIAN MILITARY THAT THEY 
HAVE ACCESS TO THE HIGH-END 

05:17:26.494 --> 05:17:30.719
TECHNOLOGY AND WE TRUST THEM TO 
DO IT AND ALSO THAT THEY HAVE 

05:17:30.920 --> 05:17:35.791
OFFERED TO BUY SOME USING THEIR 
OWN FUNDS FOR A PROGRAM TO DO 

05:17:36.004 --> 05:17:39.255
THAT BUT THEY HAVE NOT OFFERED 
TO SUSPEND THEIR OWN MONEY TO 

05:17:39.454 --> 05:17:41.488
BUY MORE SO I THINK THEY THINK 
THEY ARE IMPORTANT. 

05:17:41.489 --> 05:17:47.578
&gt;&gt;  MR. KENT HAS TESTIFIED THAT 
THIS IS IN FACT THE CONSENSUS OF

05:17:47.779 --> 05:17:49.779
THE INTERAGENCY PROVIDING THE 
JAVELINS.

05:17:55.297 --> 05:17:57.297
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, WAS HE ALSO 

05:17:57.367 --> 05:17:59.367
VERY MUCH AN ADVOCATE FOR THIS? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

05:18:07.227 --> 05:18:13.371
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, I WANT TO GO 
BACK TO SOME AMERICANS. I WANT 

05:18:13.573 --> 05:18:16.576
TO TALK ABOUT THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

05:18:20.476 --> 05:18:22.476
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH

05:18:25.525 --> 05:18:29.212
LASHINKO? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

05:18:29.213 --> 05:18:33.480
&gt;&gt; HE WAS A JOURNALIST AND  
CURRENTLY IN THE PARLIAMENT?  

05:18:33.679 --> 05:18:36.731
&gt;&gt; JOURNALIST AGAIN. 
&gt;&gt;  ARE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN HE 

05:18:36.931 --> 05:18:42.980
WAS IN THE PARLIAMENT THAT HE 
HAD PROVIDED INFORMATION TO USE 

05:18:43.157 --> 05:18:45.157
GPS OPERATIVE NAME

05:18:49.245 --> 05:18:51.245
NELLY ORE?

05:18:54.410 --> 05:18:56.643
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT AWARE BUT AS A 
JOURNALIST, HE HAS PROVIDED 

05:18:56.846 --> 05:18:59.480
INFORMATION.  
&gt;&gt; HE WAS IN  THE PARLIAMENT AT 

05:19:00.242 --> 05:19:02.262
THE TIME AND PROVIDED

05:19:06.790 --> 05:19:09.236
THE BLACK LEDGER. HAVE YOU EVER 
HEARD OF THE BLACK LEDGER? 

05:19:09.237 --> 05:19:11.237
&gt;&gt; I HAVE. 
&gt;&gt; 

05:19:17.962 --> 05:19:19.591
IS THE BLACK LEDGER SEEN AS 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION? 

05:19:19.592 --> 05:19:20.610
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; IS CREDIBLE? 

05:19:20.611 --> 05:19:23.446
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt;  ROBERT MILLER DID NOT FIND 

05:19:23.660 --> 05:19:28.936
IT CREDIBLE. DO YOU DISPUTE WHAT
HIS FINDINGS WERE? THEY DIDN'T 

05:19:29.135 --> 05:19:30.350
USE IN THE PROSECUTION OR 
REPORT. 

05:19:30.351 --> 05:19:34.008
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT AWARE THAT HE DID NOT
FIND IT CREDIBLE  BUT I THINK IT

05:19:34.219 --> 05:19:35.839
WAS EVIDENCE AND OTHER 
PROCEEDINGS AND CREDIBILITY WAS 

05:19:35.840 --> 05:19:37.840
NOT QUESTIONED. 
&gt;&gt; THE MOTIVATION 

05:19:42.294 --> 05:19:44.294
AS REPORTED

05:19:47.829 --> 05:19:49.829
WAS TO GO AFTER TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
OFFICIALS AND UNDERMINE TRUMP'S 

05:19:49.860 --> 05:19:52.698
CANDIDACY. ARE YOU AWARE OF 
THAT? 

05:19:52.699 --> 05:19:55.551
&gt;&gt; IF YOU MEAN BY THE RELEASE OF
THE BLACK LEDGER, I THINK  THE 

05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:59.958
MOTIVATION WAS THE SAME HE HAS 
ALWAYS EXPRESSED.  

05:19:59.959 --> 05:20:04.679
&gt;&gt;  HE ADMITTED THAT THE 
MOTIVATION WAS TO THESE PARTLY 

05:20:04.895 --> 05:20:06.895
UNDERMINED THE TRUMP

05:20:09.564 --> 05:20:10.780
CANDIDACY THAT HE DID NOT 
SUPPORT. 

05:20:10.781 --> 05:20:14.233
&gt;&gt; HE DID NOT SAY THAT TO ME BUT
IF HE SAID THAT TO YOU,  I WILL 

05:20:14.434 --> 05:20:20.935
TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE AWARE  AND YOU HEARD 

05:20:21.135 --> 05:20:26.219
DR. HILL'S TESTIMONY ABOUT THE 
STILL DOSSIER THAT CONTAINED THE

05:20:26.981 --> 05:20:34.340
INITIAL INFORMATION. WERE YOU 
AWARE THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAD 

05:20:34.541 --> 05:20:37.391
PAID FOR THAT INFORMATION? 
&gt;&gt; I NEVER HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT .

05:20:37.795 --> 05:20:39.795
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT ACCUSING INVOLVEMENT.

05:20:43.481 --> 05:20:46.129
I'M NOT EVEN ASKING IF YOU KNEW 
AT THE TIME BUT YOU NOW KNOW 

05:20:46.328 --> 05:20:48.162
TODAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
PAID FOR THAT INFORMATION? 

05:20:48.163 --> 05:20:51.008
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ALL 
THAT HAPPENED BEFORE  SO I DON'T

05:20:51.204 --> 05:20:53.204
HAVE ANY FIRST-HAND -- 
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT 

05:20:56.684 --> 05:20:58.919
ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING. 
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND BUT I WANT TO BE

05:20:59.118 --> 05:21:01.778
CLEAR. I HAVE READ ABOUT THOSE 
ISSUES  BUT I'M NOT AN EXERT ON 

05:21:01.968 --> 05:21:03.586
THEM. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT DISPUTING  THAT 

05:21:03.587 --> 05:21:05.587
THE DEMOCRATS AND THE CLINTON 
CAMPAIGN

05:21:10.902 --> 05:21:12.934
WERE THE SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT 
FUNDED THE STILL DOSSIER. 

05:21:12.935 --> 05:21:15.370
&gt;&gt; I WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION 
TO DISPUTE THAT.  

05:21:15.371 --> 05:21:17.371
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK IT IS 
APPROPRIATE FOR  POLITICAL 

05:21:17.404 --> 05:21:21.268
PARTIES TO RUN OPERATIVES IN 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO DIG UP DIRT

05:21:21.469 --> 05:21:23.639
ON THEIR OPPONENTS? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

05:21:23.640 --> 05:21:27.769
&gt;&gt;  DR. HILL, DO YOU THINK IT IS
APPROPRIATE FOR POLITICAL 

05:21:27.968 --> 05:21:31.421
PARTIES TO PAY OPERATIVES TO DIG
UP DIRT ON THEIR OPPONENTS? 

05:21:31.422 --> 05:21:33.592
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT.  
&gt;&gt; 

05:21:37.308 --> 05:21:39.342
WAS TURNED TO PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY'S INAUGURATION.  

05:21:39.744 --> 05:21:42.719
AMBASSADOR VOLKER TESTIFIED THAT
HE WAS VERY PLEASED

05:21:46.447 --> 05:21:48.480
WITH THE SIZE OF THE DELEGATION 
ALTHOUGH THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS 

05:21:48.681 --> 05:21:51.081
UNABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP, 
SECRETARY PERRY AND AMBASSADOR 

05:21:51.329 --> 05:21:56.804
VOLKER AND I UNDERSTAND DR. HILL
THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH SOME

05:21:57.016 --> 05:22:00.869
OF THE LOGISTICS INPUTTING THE 
DELEGATION TOGETHER. WHAT CAN 

05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:08.188
YOU TELL US ABOUT THE VICE 
PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN ATTENDING OR

05:22:08.388 --> 05:22:11.639
NOT ATTENDING? 
&gt;&gt;  I KNOW YOU HAVE THE 

05:22:11.839 --> 05:22:16.311
TESTIMONY OF JENNIFER WILLIAMS 
AND I DEFER TO HER AS BEING MUCH

05:22:16.510 --> 05:22:21.394
CLOSER TO THE DECISION-MAKING 
ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT'S 

05:22:21.593 --> 05:22:25.862
ATTENDANCE. I WILL SAY THAT I 
AND MANY OTHERS HOPED THAT THE 

05:22:26.064 --> 05:22:28.499
VICE PRESIDENT WOULD BE ABLE TO 
ATTEND AND WHAT I KNOW FROM MY 

05:22:28.701 --> 05:22:30.701
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I WAS NOT 
INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

05:22:31.296 --> 05:22:36.020
VICE PRESIDENT WAS THAT THERE 
WERE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 

05:22:36.220 --> 05:22:40.689
SCHEDULE AND AS YOU ALL KNOW, 
THE PRESIDENT INVITED OR HE WAS 

05:22:40.890 --> 05:22:43.124
OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT THE SAME 
TIME. THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT

05:22:43.324 --> 05:22:46.525
PRESIDENTIAL TROUBLE IN THE SAME
TIMEFRAME AND THERE WAS QUITE A 

05:22:46.703 --> 05:22:50.230
BIT OF BACK AND FORTH AS TO 
WHETHER IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE FOR

05:22:50.432 --> 05:22:55.517
THE VICE PRESIDENT TO GO SO THAT
WAS WHAT I WAS AWARE OF. I WAS 

05:22:55.719 --> 05:22:59.169
NOT AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF THE 
DISCUSSIONS THAT MS. WILLIAMS 

05:22:59.369 --> 05:23:01.201
WAS INVOLVED IN. 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT WAS TRAVELING  

05:23:01.202 --> 05:23:06.687
AND HEADED TO EUROPE FOR THE 
TWO-DAY ANNIVERSARY AND WHAT MS.

05:23:07.450 --> 05:23:09.450
WILLIAMS PROVIDED

05:23:11.769 --> 05:23:17.039
AND AS IT TURNED OUT, THE 
UKRAINIANS DECIDED I BELIEVE IT 

05:23:17.253 --> 05:23:21.654
WAS ON MAY 16 TO SCHEDULE THE 
INAUGURATION FOR FOUR DAYS LATER

05:23:23.142 --> 05:23:27.738
AND BY THIS POINT IN TIME, THE 
VICE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN REROUTED

05:23:28.213 --> 05:23:34.062
FOR A TRIP TO CANADA WITH THE U.
S. EMBASSY AND

05:23:38.986 --> 05:23:43.243
I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU DON'T 
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE VICE 

05:23:43.457 --> 05:23:46.229
PRESIDENT WAS ENCOURAGED NOT TO 
ATTEND FOR ANY OTHER REASON, TO 

05:23:46.413 --> 05:23:50.361
YOU?  
&gt;&gt; I PERSONALLY  DO NOT BUT I DO

05:23:50.565 --> 05:23:54.212
DEFER TO MS. WILLIAMS. 
&gt;&gt;  AND MISS WILLIAM TESTIMONY, 

05:23:54.424 --> 05:24:00.313
SHE SAID SHE HEARD FROM THE 
CHIEF OF STAFF ASSISTANCE THAT 

05:24:00.512 --> 05:24:06.402
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS NOT ABLE 
TO GO AND THE REASON FOR THAT 

05:24:07.165 --> 05:24:11.688
WAS RELATED TO ANY OF THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS AND IT HASN'T 

05:24:11.889 --> 05:24:16.495
BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED. I WANT 
TO NOTE FROM THE MATERIALS YOU 

05:24:16.671 --> 05:24:21.471
PROVIDED THAT THERE WAS A 
DISCUSSION WHETHER THE PRESIDENT

05:24:21.651 --> 05:24:24.435
MAY HAVE INFLUENCE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DECISION ON THAT MAY 13 

05:24:24.606 --> 05:24:26.606
DAY

05:24:33.017 --> 05:24:34.433
AND YOUR MEMBER WHEN THE MEETING
WAS? 

05:24:34.434 --> 05:24:35.852
&gt;&gt; I DO. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT? 

05:24:35.853 --> 05:24:38.299
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS IN MAY. 
&gt;&gt; DELIVER WHAT  TIME OF DAY IT 

05:24:38.501 --> 05:24:41.952
WAS ON THE 13th? 
&gt;&gt; TO BE HONEST,  USUALLY THESE 

05:24:42.156 --> 05:24:46.221
MEETINGS ARE AROUND LUNCHTIME 
AND SOMETIME IN THE TIMEFRAME TO

05:24:46.421 --> 05:24:51.909
THE EARLY OR MID PART OF THE DAY
BUT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR SURE. I 

05:24:52.109 --> 05:24:54.945
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I CANNOT 
SPEAK ABOUT THAT ENGAGEMENT. 

05:24:55.359 --> 05:25:01.604
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER WILLIAMS TESTIFIED 
THAT  IT WAS AROUND 11:15 IN THE

05:25:01.779 --> 05:25:03.779
MEETING

05:25:06.327 --> 05:25:10.394
AFTER WAS A WRITER ON THE 
AFTERNOON. THAT WOULD BE AROUND 

05:25:10.595 --> 05:25:14.247
1:45. WOULD THAT BE CONSISTENT 
WITH YOUR TIMEFRAME? 

05:25:14.248 --> 05:25:19.321
&gt;&gt; ABOUT LUNCH TIME, YES.  
&gt;&gt; GIVEN THE FOUR DAYS NOTICE  

05:25:19.736 --> 05:25:22.725
AND GIVEN SECRETARY PERRY'S 
INVOLVEMENT, DO YOU THINK THE 

05:25:22.901 --> 05:25:24.901
DELEGATION

05:25:26.639 --> 05:25:29.810
WAS A GOOD-SIZED GROUP? 
&gt;&gt; I DO  AND LET ME MAKE A POINT

05:25:32.531 --> 05:25:34.764
THAT WE DON'T TRY TO MAKE THESE 
DELEGATIONS LARGE. THIS IS ON 

05:25:34.966 --> 05:25:37.564
THE TAXPAYERS DIME AND IT IS 
PRETTY EXPENSIVE GETTING PEOPLE 

05:25:37.743 --> 05:25:41.794
THERE AND WE TRY TO KEEP THEM 
SMALL.

05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:51.419
PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE MADE AN 
ARRANGEMENT IF WE HAD A LONGER 

05:25:51.621 --> 05:25:54.267
LEAD TIME BUT FOUR DAYS IS NOT A
LOT OF TIME TO MAKE AN 

05:25:54.468 --> 05:25:55.887
ARRANGEMENT. 
&gt;&gt; SECRETARY PERRY  HAVE AN 

05:25:55.888 --> 05:25:57.718
INTEREST IN AND SOME OF THE 
ENERGY RELATED ISSUES? 

05:25:57.719 --> 05:26:02.388
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY  RECOMMENDED 
SECRETARY PERRY BE LEAD ALONG 

05:26:02.588 --> 05:26:04.421
WITH OTHERS. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT CAN YOU TELL ABOUT HIS 

05:26:04.422 --> 05:26:05.436
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE UKRAINIAN 
POLICY? 

05:26:05.437 --> 05:26:07.819
&gt;&gt;  TERRY PERRY'S ENGAGEMENT 
MADE PERFECT SENSE GIVEN HIS 

05:26:08.006 --> 05:26:13.159
ROLE IN HIS DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WITH HIS 

05:26:13.921 --> 05:26:15.921
FORMER GOVERNORSHIP

05:26:18.428 --> 05:26:21.000
AND HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY 
GOOD ADVOCATE FOR U. S. INTEREST

05:26:22.296 --> 05:26:26.565
IN ONE OF UKRAINE'S ACHILLES' 
HEEL IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY

05:26:26.765 --> 05:26:30.576
DISADVANTAGE WITH RUSSIA IS IN 
FACT ENERGY. UKRAINE REMAINS FOR

05:26:30.752 --> 05:26:36.258
NOW THE MAIN POINT FOR RUSSIAN 
OIL AND GAS AND PIPELINES TO 

05:26:36.433 --> 05:26:39.151
EUROPE AND THIS HAS BEEN 
MANIPULATED REPEATEDLY 

05:26:39.352 --> 05:26:44.571
ESPECIALLY SINCE 2006 BY THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND MANY WILL

05:26:44.745 --> 05:26:50.125
REMEMBER IN THE REAGAN ERA, 
THERE WAS A HUGE DISPUTE BETWEEN

05:26:50.325 --> 05:26:55.060
THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE 
ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO 

05:26:55.756 --> 05:27:02.917
BUILD PIPELINES FROM THE EVENTS 
OF THE UNION AND TO BRING IT TO 

05:27:03.117 --> 05:27:06.169
THE EUROPEAN MARKET. 
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, WHAT WAS YOUR 

05:27:06.368 --> 05:27:10.838
VIEW OF THE DELEGATION? DO YOU 
THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT SIZED 

05:27:11.254 --> 05:27:14.850
GROUP OR THE RIGHT LEVEL OF 
PRESTIGE?  

05:27:14.851 --> 05:27:18.480
&gt;&gt;  I THINK IT WAS FINE.

05:27:25.876 --> 05:27:27.876
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 
&gt;&gt; SINCE WE ARE ON THE TOPIC OF 

05:27:27.911 --> 05:27:31.679
UKRAINIAN ENERGY , THIS IS A 
GOOD WAY FOR US TO SEGUE TO

05:27:38.867 --> 05:27:41.103
BARIZMA WHICH I ASSUME MANY OF 
YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND HAVE 

05:27:41.317 --> 05:27:43.953
HEARD FOR MANY YEARS. YOU ARE ON
THE GROUND  NOW, MR. HOLMES AND 

05:27:44.153 --> 05:27:47.203
I KNOW YOU WERE THERE AT THE 
TIME BUT IN 2015, THEN 

05:27:47.404 --> 05:27:49.404
AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE, JEFFREY 
PIATT, OBAMA

05:27:54.511 --> 05:27:56.343
APPOINTED CAREER AMBASSADOR AND 
I'M SURE YOU KNOW HIM? 

05:27:56.344 --> 05:27:57.361
&gt;&gt; I DO. 
&gt;&gt; CREDIBLE? 

05:27:57.362 --> 05:28:00.947
&gt;&gt; YES.  
&gt;&gt;  HE CALLED FOR AN 

05:28:01.122 --> 05:28:03.122
INVESTIGATION INTO THE OWNER OF

05:28:11.370 --> 05:28:12.588
BARIZMA. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH 
THAT? 

05:28:12.589 --> 05:28:14.418
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DEPUTY

05:28:14.419 --> 05:28:16.251
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE  
WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE 

05:28:16.252 --> 05:28:18.631
POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
WITH HUNTER BIDEN SITTING ON THE

05:28:18.811 --> 05:28:20.811
BOARD?

05:28:22.341 --> 05:28:28.027
&gt;&gt; I WOULD DEFER TO GEORGE KEN 
WHO WAS INVOLVED . 

05:28:28.028 --> 05:28:32.653
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW THAT  THE GAS 
COMPANY ROUTED MORE THAN $3 

05:28:32.899 --> 05:28:40.013
MILLION.  
&gt;&gt;  WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT,

05:28:40.215 --> 05:28:43.487
DR. HILL? 
&gt;&gt;  ONLY PARTLY. 

05:28:43.488 --> 05:28:51.752
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW  THAT THIS WAS 
THE REPRESENTATIVES JUST DAYS 

05:28:51.925 --> 05:28:53.925
AFTER

05:28:56.060 --> 05:28:58.090
WITH THE FIRING OF THE COUNTRY'S
CHIEF PROSECUTOR. 

05:28:58.091 --> 05:29:01.480
&gt;&gt;  KNOW. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW THAT 

05:29:05.209 --> 05:29:07.229
THE AMERICAN LAWYERS TRIED TO 
SECURE A MEETING WITH THE NEW 

05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:12.714
STATE PROSECUTOR THE SAME DAY 
THE PREDECESSOR FIRING WAS 

05:29:12.915 --> 05:29:13.530
ANNOUNCED? 
&gt;&gt; NO. 

05:29:13.531 --> 05:29:15.563
&gt;&gt; DIGITAL JOE BIDEN CALLED 
UKRAINIAN  PRESIDENT AT LEAST 

05:29:15.763 --> 05:29:19.745
THREE TIMES IN 2016 SHORTLY 
AFTER THE PRESIDENT AND OWNER OF

05:29:31.002 --> 05:29:32.821
BARIZMA'S HOME WAS RAIDED BY THE
STATE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE? 

05:29:32.822 --> 05:29:34.453
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW THAT DEVON 

05:29:34.454 --> 05:29:36.486
ARCHER AND HUNTER BIDEN REACHED 
OUT TO THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF 

05:29:36.687 --> 05:29:38.720
STATE SHORTLY AFTER  THE RAID ON
THE RECENT?  

05:29:38.721 --> 05:29:40.721
&gt;&gt; NO. 

05:29:45.627 --> 05:29:48.465
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL, DID YOU KNOW AND I 
WANT TO GO THROUGH AND ASK ALL 

05:29:48.666 --> 05:29:51.058
THOSE QUESTIONS OVER AGAIN. 
&gt;&gt; I ALSO DID NOT KNOW. 

05:29:54.554 --> 05:29:57.526
&gt;&gt; OKAY. SO, YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW 
THAT THE PRESIDENT  HAD CONCERNS

05:30:03.495 --> 05:30:07.361
ABOUT BARIZMA AND ELECTION 
MEDDLING BY THE UKRAINIANS  AND 

05:30:07.565 --> 05:30:16.634
WHEN YOU WERE IN THERE AS THE 
HEAD OF THE UKRAINE

05:30:18.734 --> 05:30:24.420
DESK, DID YOU EVER RAISE -- DID 
YOU EVER BRIEF THE PRESIDENT OR 

05:30:24.618 --> 05:30:29.651
RAISE IT UP TO AMBASSADOR BOLTON
ABOUT ANY CONCERNS YOU 2017 AND 

05:30:29.822 --> 05:30:31.856
18 WITH THE ELECTION MEDDLING

05:30:37.626 --> 05:30:39.050
OR CONCERNS? 
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE BRIEFING PROCESS 

05:30:39.051 --> 05:30:41.810
DID NOT REALLY WORK  IN A WAY 
THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING

05:30:45.949 --> 05:30:48.202
SO IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ASKED 
ABOUT ANY OF THIS INFORMATION, 

05:30:48.398 --> 05:30:51.178
IT WOULD'VE BEEN PROVIDED A JUST
TO BE CLEAR, UKRAINE WAS ON THE 

05:30:51.364 --> 05:30:54.287
TOP PRIORITY IN THIS PERIOD IN 
THE SAME WAY THAT MANY OTHER 

05:30:54.485 --> 05:30:58.698
ISSUES THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT 
FROM TURKEY AND OTHERS AND THERE

05:30:58.878 --> 05:31:03.625
WERE BRIEFINGS ON UKRAINE. THEY 
WOULD TAKE PLACE WHEN IT WAS A 

05:31:04.383 --> 05:31:06.383
SCHEDULED MEETING

05:31:08.297 --> 05:31:11.069
AND AS WE KNOW, THERE HAVE NOT 
BEEN MANY OF THOSE. 

05:31:11.070 --> 05:31:16.570
&gt;&gt;  JUST AS FAR AS YOU KNOW, 
THERE WERE NO BRIEFINGS OR 

05:31:16.743 --> 05:31:18.743
PAPERS

05:31:24.143 --> 05:31:26.377
AND ANSWER NO QUESTIONS AS IT 
RELATES TO THE 2016 ELECTION OR 

05:31:26.578 --> 05:31:28.813
BARIZMA DURING YOUR TIME THERE? 
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT, NO.  

05:31:28.814 --> 05:31:30.814
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL, YOU TOLD US THAT 

05:31:34.501 --> 05:31:36.319
INDEED, THERE ARE PERCEIVED 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST TROUBLES 

05:31:36.320 --> 05:31:38.918
WHEN THE CHILD OF THE GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS IS INVOLVED WITH 

05:31:39.092 --> 05:31:44.040
SOMETHING WHERE THEY HAVE 
OFFICIAL POLICY. 

05:31:44.041 --> 05:31:49.531
&gt;&gt; I THINK EMILY FAMILY MEMBER  
WITH CONGRESS OR THE SENATE IS 

05:31:49.730 --> 05:31:55.217
OPEN TO ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT UPTAKE'S IF THEY TAKE PART

05:31:55.419 --> 05:31:58.870
IN ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT 
COULD BE MISCONSTRUED AS BEING 

05:31:59.070 --> 05:32:03.751
RELATED TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS 
WORK SO I DO THINK THAT IS THE 

05:32:03.953 --> 05:32:06.548
CASE. 
&gt;&gt;  BACK TO AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

05:32:06.725 --> 05:32:15.365
, YOU TESTIFIED THAT HE MADE A 
HABIT OF BEING DROPPING HIS 

05:32:15.539 --> 05:32:17.359
INTERACTION WITH THE PRESIDENT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

05:32:17.360 --> 05:32:23.045
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE INSTANCES WHERE  
YOU WOULD RUN INTO HIM AND HE 

05:32:23.245 --> 05:32:25.893
WOULD SAY I'M HERE TO SEE THE 
PRESIDENT OR I HAVE BEEN IN TO 

05:32:26.095 --> 05:32:28.095
SEE THE PRESIDENT AND YOU HAD 
INDICATION

05:32:34.619 --> 05:32:36.452
TO CIRCLE BACK AND SAY THAT 
WASN'T THE CASE? 

05:32:36.453 --> 05:32:38.453
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; HE TESTIFIED ABOUT SOME SORT 

05:32:38.488 --> 05:32:41.325
OF COFFEE HE HAD WITH YOU ON 
YOUR LAST DAY  AND I THINK WHEN 

05:32:41.528 --> 05:32:43.872
THE DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPT WAS 
RELEASED, YOUR COUNSEL INDICATED

05:32:49.445 --> 05:32:51.445
THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY 
FABRICATED AND I WANT TO GIVE 

05:32:51.482 --> 05:32:54.868
YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS 
THAT. 

05:32:54.869 --> 05:33:01.836
&gt;&gt;  WE DON'T HAVE COFFEE 
MACHINES READILY IN OUR OFFICE 

05:33:02.051 --> 05:33:07.872
ON THE BEST I COULD'VE OFFERED 
YOU WAS A CUP OF WATER. THE 

05:33:08.047 --> 05:33:10.047
COFFEE

05:33:14.024 --> 05:33:16.059
THAT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND I 
SHARED, WE WOULD RUN INTO EACH 

05:33:16.259 --> 05:33:18.907
OTHER AND HE FOUND OUT I WOULD 
BE THERE AND ASKED ME TO MEET 

05:33:19.108 --> 05:33:23.162
HIM FOR COFFEE  IN JACKSONVILLE,
WYOMING IN 2018 IN AUGUST. THIS 

05:33:23.377 --> 05:33:26.012
IS A FULL YEAR BEFORE I LEFT. 
THAT WAS A VERY NICE COFFEE SO 

05:33:26.213 --> 05:33:31.093
PERHAPS HE HAD THOSE TWO 
MEETINGS TOGETHER BUT THE 

05:33:31.294 --> 05:33:33.732
MEANING HE WAS REFERRING TO WAS 
WHEN HE CAME TO MEET WITH OUR 

05:33:33.932 --> 05:33:36.930
DIRECTOR FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION 
AND THIS IS MY LAST WEEK IN THE 

05:33:37.099 --> 05:33:42.670
OFFICE AND AS I WAS IN THE 
OFFICE FOR A BRIEF TIME BEFORE 

05:33:42.869 --> 05:33:45.106
GOING INTO ANOTHER MEETING, IT 
WAS MY LAST WEEK IN THE OFFICE 

05:33:45.307 --> 05:33:50.341
AND WE AGREED TO SIT DOWN WITH 
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WITH THE 

05:33:50.523 --> 05:33:52.523
ASSISTANT

05:33:56.082 --> 05:33:58.082
THAT THE AMBASSADOR HAD BROUGHT 
WITH HIM FROM THE STATE 

05:33:58.115 --> 05:34:00.133
DEPARTMENT SO THERE WERE FOUR OF
US IN THAT MEETING AND 

05:34:00.335 --> 05:34:01.914
UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T OVER 
COFFEE. 

05:34:01.915 --> 05:34:05.145
&gt;&gt;  HE WENT ON TO INDICATE THAT 
YOU WERE UPSET

05:34:11.106 --> 05:34:13.106
.  
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE FIVE OF US IN THE 

05:34:13.137 --> 05:34:14.553
MEETING, OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T DO 
MATH, SORRY. 

05:34:14.554 --> 05:34:17.003
&gt;&gt; FAIR ENOUGH. HE INDICATED YOU
WERE UPSET  WITH BOLTON IN THE 

05:34:17.203 --> 05:34:19.238
WAY THINGS WERE GOING AND I 
BELIEVE THE COUNCIL SAID THAT 

05:34:19.439 --> 05:34:21.911
WAS AN OUTRIGHT FABRICATION? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU MIGHT RECALL  

05:34:22.093 --> 05:34:25.036
THAT I SAID THERE WAS A BLOWUP

05:34:28.988 --> 05:34:31.422
AND I HAD A COUPLE OF TESTY 
ENCOUNTERS AND ONE OF THEM WAS 

05:34:31.624 --> 05:34:33.624
IN JUNE OF 2018

05:34:36.495 --> 05:34:39.344
WHEN I SAID WHO PUT YOU IN 
CHARGE AND I WILL ADMIT I WAS A 

05:34:39.543 --> 05:34:41.976
BIT RUDE AND THAT WHEN HE SAID 
THE PRESIDENT WHICH SHUT ME UP 

05:34:42.216 --> 05:34:48.277
IN THE OTHER MEETING WHERE THERE
WAS 15 OR 20 MINUTES AS HE 

05:34:48.479 --> 05:34:51.930
DEPICTED IT WAS, I WAS TO BE 
HONEST ANGRY WITH HIM AND I HATE

05:34:52.143 --> 05:34:56.610
TO SAY IT BUT OFTEN WHEN WOMEN 
SHOW ANGER, IT IS NOT FULLY 

05:34:56.810 --> 05:35:00.621
APPRECIATED BUT OFTEN PUSHED 
ONTO EMOTIONAL ISSUES OR 

05:35:00.794 --> 05:35:07.569
DEFLECTED ONTO OTHER PEOPLE AND 
WHAT I WAS ANGRY ABOUT WAS THAT 

05:35:07.784 --> 05:35:09.784
HE WAS NOT COORDINATING WITH US

05:35:15.908 --> 05:35:17.935
AND I REALIZE HAVING LISTENING 
TO THE DEPOSITION THAT HE WAS 

05:35:18.143 --> 05:35:19.965
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WASN'T 
COORDINATING WITH US BECAUSE WE 

05:35:19.966 --> 05:35:22.603
WERE DOING THE SAME THING THAT 
HE WAS DOING SO I WAS UPSET WITH

05:35:22.816 --> 05:35:25.039
HIM THAT HE WASN'T TELLING US 
ABOUT THE MEETINGS HE WAS HAVING

05:35:25.254 --> 05:35:28.089
AND HE SAID TO ME I BRIEFING THE
PRESIDENT. I'M BRIEFING THE 

05:35:28.291 --> 05:35:34.391
CHIEF OF STAFF AND SECRETARY 
POMPEO SO WHO ELSE DO I HAVE TO 

05:35:34.592 --> 05:35:39.062
DO WITH? THE POINT IS WE HAVE A 
ROBUST INTERAGENCY PROCESS THAT 

05:35:39.262 --> 05:35:43.643
DEALS WITH UKRAINE AND INCLUDES 
MR. HOLMES AND AMBASSADOR TAYLOR

05:35:45.149 --> 05:35:50.232
AND IT INCLUDES A WHOLE LOAD OF 
OTHER PEOPLE AND IT STRUCK ME 

05:35:51.186 --> 05:35:53.186
WITH YOU

05:35:59.986 --> 05:36:01.986
LOOK AT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S 
EMAILS, HE SAID THESE ARE PEOPLE

05:36:02.156 --> 05:36:04.457
THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AND HE WAS
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BECAUSE HE WAS 

05:36:04.656 --> 05:36:07.907
BEING INVOLVED IN A DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL ERRAND  AND WE WERE 

05:36:08.107 --> 05:36:09.976
BEING INVOLVED IN NATIONAL 
SECURITY ON FOREIGN POLICY IN 

05:36:09.977 --> 05:36:12.378
THOSE TWO THINGS HAD JUST A 
VERGED SO HE WAS CORRECT AND I 

05:36:12.577 --> 05:36:16.441
HAD NOT PUT MY FINGER ON THAT AT
THE MOMENT BUT I WAS IRRITATED 

05:36:16.641 --> 05:36:18.877
WITH HIM AND ANGRY WITH HIM THAT
HE WASN'T FULLY COORDINATING AND

05:36:19.078 --> 05:36:24.570
I SAY TO HIM THAT I THINK THIS 
WILL ALL BLOW UP AND HERE WE ARE

05:36:24.765 --> 05:36:28.419
AND AFTER I LEFT HIM MY NEXT 
MEETING, I WENT TO THE EUROPEAN 

05:36:28.620 --> 05:36:34.308
UNION AND TALKS FOR A FULL HALF 
HOUR TRYING TO ASK HIM ABOUT HOW

05:36:35.071 --> 05:36:40.196
TO COORDINATE BETTER AFTER I 
LEFT THE OFFICE AND HIS FEELING 

05:36:40.438 --> 05:36:42.438
WAS THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
COUNCIL WAS TRYING TO BLOCK HIM.

05:36:42.642 --> 05:36:48.692
WHAT WE WOULD TRY TO DO IS HAVE 
THAT DOMESTIC OR PERSONAL 

05:36:48.874 --> 05:36:52.743
POLITICS AND THAT WAS PRECISELY 
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO. 

05:36:52.917 --> 05:36:56.587
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND WAS NOT 
WRONG THAT HE HAD BEEN  GIVEN A 

05:36:56.762 --> 05:36:58.762
DIFFERENT

05:37:00.518 --> 05:37:02.953
AND IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I
STARTED TO REALIZE HOW THOSE 

05:37:03.152 --> 05:37:05.385
THINGS HAD A VERGED AND I 
REALIZED THAT I WASN'T BEING IN 

05:37:05.587 --> 05:37:07.587
FAIR TO AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
BECAUSE HE WAS  CARRYING OUT 

05:37:07.621 --> 05:37:12.906
WHAT HE THOUGHT AND WE WERE 
DOING SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT 

05:37:13.308 --> 05:37:17.106
WAS PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
BUT NOT IN THE SAME CHANNEL.

05:37:23.065 --> 05:37:25.897
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON THIS 
A LITTLE BIT.  THE PRESIDENT OF 

05:37:26.112 --> 05:37:29.768
THE UNITED STATES, 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WAS CONCERNED

05:37:29.968 --> 05:37:34.237
ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTIONS IN 
BARIZMA? HE HAD HIS PERSONAL 

05:37:34.997 --> 05:37:40.073
ATTORNEY  WORKING THESE ISSUES 
BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER 

05:37:40.249 --> 05:37:46.010
INVESTIGATION BY ROBERT MUELLER 
SPECIAL COUNSEL BEGINNING WITH 

05:37:46.626 --> 05:37:48.626
THE INVESTIGATION THAT STARTED 
WITH THE

05:37:54.547 --> 05:37:56.547
STILL DOSSIER AND HAD BEEN INTO 
THE FBI.

05:38:00.229 --> 05:38:02.600
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF

05:38:06.526 --> 05:38:12.415
, TESTIFIED THAT YOU WEREN'T 
AWARE THAT BUT IF THAT WAS THE 

05:38:12.629 --> 05:38:15.203
CONCERN OF THE PRESIDENT TO GET 
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE

05:38:18.714 --> 05:38:23.106
AND THAT WAS THE CONCERN TO SET 
UP MEETINGS TO ENSURE

05:38:26.838 --> 05:38:28.838
THAT MEETINGS OCCURRED

05:38:31.921 --> 05:38:37.162
, I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT HAD ISSUES WITH

05:38:37.337 --> 05:38:42.328
THAT BUT IS THAT THE COMMANDER 
IN CHIEF THAT MAKES IT DECISION?

05:38:42.682 --> 05:38:51.417
&gt;&gt; MY POINT  IS THAT WE WERE NOT
TOLD THAT WE WERE TO BE FOCUSED 

05:38:51.618 --> 05:38:57.717
ON THESE ISSUES AS A MATTER OF 
POLICY TOWARDS UKRAINE. WHEN 

05:38:57.919 --> 05:39:00.691
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UKRAINE, I 
HEARD

05:39:05.237 --> 05:39:07.054
THE PRESIDENT NEVER SAY ANYTHING
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 2016 AND 

05:39:07.055 --> 05:39:10.104
UKRAINE. I HAVE HEARD HIM SEE 
AND SAY SOMETHING PUBLICLY BUT I

05:39:10.305 --> 05:39:12.501
WAS NOT GIVEN DIRECTIVE.

05:39:18.228 --> 05:39:19.860
I WAS TO STAY OUT OF DOMESTIC 
POLITICS. 

05:39:19.861 --> 05:39:23.047
&gt;&gt; JUST FOR SAKE OF THE 
TIMELINE,  I THINK AS OF JULY 19

05:39:25.132 --> 05:39:29.600
, THEY HAD NOT EVEN ENGAGED WITH
RUDY GIULIANI AN ANOMALY THAT 

05:39:29.815 --> 05:39:34.686
HAPPENED UNTIL LATER. YOU 
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ALREADY 

05:39:34.888 --> 05:39:37.118
ENGAGED IN THOSE ACTIVITIES? 
&gt;&gt; WE ALREADY HAD A DISCUSSION  

05:39:37.320 --> 05:39:42.608
WHICH WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT, 
CHRIS ANDERSON THAT INDICATED 

05:39:42.809 --> 05:39:46.260
THAT HE HAD MET WITH RUDY 
GIULIANI AT THIS POINT AND THERE

05:39:46.462 --> 05:39:50.327
WAS A COMMENT ABOUT MEETING WITH
GIULIANI AND AS WE KNOW, THEY 

05:39:50.527 --> 05:39:52.527
HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED

05:39:55.813 --> 05:39:57.845
THAT THEY GAVE EVERY IMPRESSION 
THAT THEY WERE MEETING AT THIS 

05:39:58.045 --> 05:40:00.045
POINT AND HE WAS ALSO SAYING

05:40:04.141 --> 05:40:07.191
THAT HE WAS CHORDING WITH THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT. IT WAS MY 

05:40:07.393 --> 05:40:08.809
BELIEF THAT THEY WERE MEETING 
WITH HIM. 

05:40:08.810 --> 05:40:10.810
&gt;&gt; THERE IS SOME  AMBIGUITY

05:40:14.497 --> 05:40:18.762
IN THE DIRECTION AND INVESTED 
HER VOLKER SAID THEY DISMISSED 

05:40:18.964 --> 05:40:24.049
UKRAINE AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT IT, JUST GO TALK TO RUDY 

05:40:24.450 --> 05:40:26.484
AND HE TOOK THAT A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENTLY. I BELIEVE THAT 

05:40:26.684 --> 05:40:32.305
AMBASSADOR VOLKER WAS PRIMARILY 
WITH MR. GIULIANI AND THAT WAS 

05:40:32.482 --> 05:40:34.482
HAPPENING

05:40:36.025 --> 05:40:37.658
AND DIDN'T START UNTIL THE END 
OF JULY. 

05:40:37.659 --> 05:40:41.913
&gt;&gt; I ONLY LEARNED THAT  
SUBSEQUENTLY SO I WANT TO TELL 

05:40:42.127 --> 05:40:46.239
YOU IN THAT PARTICULAR TIMEFRAME
THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT AND

05:40:46.930 --> 05:40:49.187
IN FACT, GORDON SONDLAND AND 

05:40:53.092 --> 05:40:55.124
THEY HAD WARNED THE INVESTORS 
NOT TO MEET WITH RUDY GIULIANI 

05:40:55.326 --> 05:40:59.994
IN A MEETING. 
&gt;&gt;  MR. MORRISON TOLD US THAT 

05:41:00.758 --> 05:41:02.758
YOU HAD

05:41:07.516 --> 05:41:08.530
RELAYED CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
JUDGMENT. 

05:41:08.531 --> 05:41:13.199
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT RELAY IT TO ANY 
CONCERNS  ABOUT THE JUDGMENT SO 

05:41:13.399 --> 05:41:17.052
I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD MR.
MORRISON MAKE THAT WHEN I READ 

05:41:17.268 --> 05:41:19.905
HIS DEPOSITION. IT WAS A VERY 
SPECIFIC POINT THAT WAS MADE IN 

05:41:20.105 --> 05:41:22.259
THESE ARE PERSONAL ISSUES AND 
I'M SURE NO ONE

05:41:28.440 --> 05:41:30.440
HERE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR 
PRIVATE PERSONAL ISSUES PUT 

05:41:30.461 --> 05:41:33.110
BEFORE A COMMITTEE BUT YOU HAVE 
ASKED ME ABOUT THIS SO I HAD A 

05:41:33.312 --> 05:41:37.217
COUPLE OF VERY SHORT TRANSITION 
MEETINGS AND MR. MORRISON WAS 

05:41:37.388 --> 05:41:40.617
TAKING OVER THE POSITION WHICH 
HE HELD FOR THREE MONTHS AND I 

05:41:40.818 --> 05:41:46.506
HAVE WORKED AS A SENIOR DIRECTOR
FOR EUROPE FOR MORE THAN TWO 

05:41:46.718 --> 05:41:50.373
YEARS AT THIS POINT AND I HAVE 
BEEN WORKING FOR A YEAR WITH 

05:41:50.775 --> 05:41:57.026
COLONEL DENMAN AND IN THAT JUNE 
TIMEFRAME, I SAT DOWN WITH THE 

05:41:57.204 --> 05:41:59.204
DEPUTY

05:42:01.544 --> 05:42:04.995
THAT WAS ALSO WORKING AND WE 
WENT TO THE ORGANIZATIONAL 

05:42:05.398 --> 05:42:08.049
CHARGE WITH HE WAS STAYING AND 
HE WAS ROTATING AND WE TALKED 

05:42:08.813 --> 05:42:12.303
ABOUT EVERYONE WITH THEIR 
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. I 

05:42:12.717 --> 05:42:19.571
ALWAYS ASKED ABOUT WHAT I WASN'T
DOING AND I SAID THAT I WAS 

05:42:19.753 --> 05:42:24.446
CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THINGS 
WERE TRENDING IN THE UKRAINE 

05:42:24.658 --> 05:42:26.658
POLICY.

05:42:31.405 --> 05:42:33.405
COLONEL DENMAN IS A HIGHLY 
DECORATED OFFICER AND CAME OVER 

05:42:33.438 --> 05:42:39.326
TO US FROM THE CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE
WITH THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND WE 

05:42:39.527 --> 05:42:41.560
WERE LOOKING AT HIM IN THE 
CONTEXT OF WHAT HIS FUTURE 

05:42:41.761 --> 05:42:43.996
POSITIONS WOULD BE IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE U.S. ARMY AND I 

05:42:44.196 --> 05:42:48.665
WAS CONCERNED THAT IF FOR 
EXAMPLE, HE MIGHT DECIDE TO 

05:42:48.866 --> 05:42:50.866
LEAVE THE MILITARY THAT PERHAPS

05:42:54.554 --> 05:42:56.589
HE WASN'T AS WELL SUITED FOR 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MUCH 

05:42:56.790 --> 05:42:59.026
MORE POLITICAL. I DID NOT FEEL 
HE HAD THE POLITICAL ANTENNA TO 

05:42:59.224 --> 05:43:02.276
DEAL WITH SOMETHING WITH 
DOMESTIC POLITICS. NOT EVERYONE 

05:43:02.478 --> 05:43:05.126
IS SUITED FOR THAT. THAT DOES 
NOT MEAN IN ANY WAY THAT I WAS 

05:43:05.327 --> 05:43:12.231
QUESTIONING THE OVERALL JUDGMENT
NOR ANY WAY HIS EXPERTISE. HE IS

05:43:12.432 --> 05:43:16.900
EXCELLENT ON ISSUES RELATED TO 
UKRAINE AND MEDULLA AND HAVE 

05:43:17.662 --> 05:43:21.912
BEEN CHARGED OF THE RUSSIAN 
CAMPAIGN THINKING THROUGH

05:43:26.456 --> 05:43:28.691
AT THE CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE IN THE 
PENTAGON AND THIS IS A VERY 

05:43:28.891 --> 05:43:31.275
SPECIFIC ISSUE BECAUSE BY JUNE, 
WE SAW THAT THINGS WERE 

05:43:31.448 --> 05:43:35.794
DIVERTING AND IT WAS COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT. SOME PEOPLE IN MY 

05:43:35.995 --> 05:43:40.466
OFFICE HAD WORKED AT THE HIGHEST
LEVEL AND MR. MORRISON HAD COME 

05:43:40.677 --> 05:43:43.061
FROM CAPITOL HILL. HE KNEW 
POLITICS INSIDE OUT AND COLONEL 

05:43:43.246 --> 05:43:48.185
DENMAN DID NOT. WE WERE 
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW HE WOULD 

05:43:48.386 --> 05:43:53.469
MANAGE THE HIGHLY DEMANDING 
CHARGE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN 

05:43:53.670 --> 05:43:57.682
BEFORE. 
&gt;&gt;  YOU RELATED THAT DURING THE 

05:43:57.861 --> 05:43:59.893
DEPOSITION THAT COLONEL

05:44:03.894 --> 05:44:05.894
VENNEMAN

05:44:08.096 --> 05:44:09.915
WAS CUT OUT. WAS IT SOMETHING 
THAT YOU RECOMMENDED? 

05:44:09.916 --> 05:44:11.916
&gt;&gt;  NOT WITH THE EMBASSY BUT

05:44:17.637 --> 05:44:19.871
WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE
POLITICAL ASPECTS AND WE DID NOT

05:44:20.634 --> 05:44:22.634
FEEL WHEN JULY 10, COLONEL

05:44:33.100 --> 05:44:35.100
VINDMAN,

05:44:37.337 --> 05:44:42.005
IT WAS HIGHLY POLITICAL. 
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES,  AT THE END OF 

05:44:42.219 --> 05:44:44.365
AUGUST, WE REALIZE THAT 
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WAS ENGAGED

05:44:48.108 --> 05:44:50.945
IN OBTAINING INFORMATION FOR THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT EUROPEAN ALLIES 

05:44:51.360 --> 05:44:58.665
IN THE REGION AS THE DECISION 
ABOUT AID WAS BEING DEBATED. 

05:44:59.080 --> 05:45:04.351
&gt;&gt; AFTER THE HOLD WAS PLACED , 
MANY PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO 

05:45:05.101 --> 05:45:07.101
UNDERSTAND WHY

05:45:09.021 --> 05:45:11.055
AND I BELIEVE IT WAS SENATOR 
JOHNSON THAT SAID THE PRESIDENT 

05:45:11.256 --> 05:45:16.540
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL
SO TRYING TO INTERPRET WHY THIS 

05:45:16.743 --> 05:45:18.886
MIGHT HAPPEN AND WE WERE LOOKING
INTO THE FACTS

05:45:23.043 --> 05:45:25.078
OF WHAT THE EUROPEANS HAD 
PROVIDED IN WHAT WE HAD PROVIDED

05:45:25.279 --> 05:45:27.279
AND IT WAS VERY ILLUMINATING 
WHAT WE LEARNED. UNITED STATES 

05:45:27.314 --> 05:45:29.748
HAD PROVIDED COMBINED CIVILIAN 
AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO 

05:45:29.949 --> 05:45:33.350
UKRAINE TO 2014 OF ABOUT $3 
BILLION PLUS TWO $1 BILLION LOAN

05:45:33.522 --> 05:45:35.522
GUARANTEES

05:45:40.308 --> 05:45:42.340
AND THAT WOULD GET PAYBACK 
LARGELY. JUST OVER $3 BILLION IN

05:45:42.540 --> 05:45:47.010
EUROPEANS AT THE LEVEL OF THE 
UNION AND THE STATES COMBINED 

05:45:47.209 --> 05:45:49.804
SINCE 2014, MY UNDERSTANDING 
THAT IT HAVE BEEN A COMBINED $12

05:45:49.980 --> 05:45:51.676
MILLION. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE 

05:45:51.677 --> 05:45:56.507
THAT BACK  AT THE END OF AUGUST?
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SO. 

05:46:00.214 --> 05:46:02.449
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THAT WAS THE 
INFORMATION THE WHITE HOUSE WAS 

05:46:02.649 --> 05:46:05.702
LOOKING FOR?  
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW. IF THE CONCERN

05:46:05.903 --> 05:46:10.293
WAS THAT  OTHERS WEREN'T 
SPENDING AS MUCH AS WE WERE

05:46:14.225 --> 05:46:15.856
,  THAT INFORMATION SHOWED A 
DIFFERENT STORY. 

05:46:15.857 --> 05:46:19.243
&gt;&gt; THE AIDE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY  
LIFTED SHORTLY THEREAFTER? 

05:46:19.244 --> 05:46:21.244
&gt;&gt; 

05:46:22.759 --> 05:46:24.759
YES, IN MID-SEPTEMBER.

05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:32.099
&gt;&gt; THAT CONCLUDES  THE 45 MINUTE
ROUNDS AND WE WILL NOW RECOGNIZE

05:46:32.851 --> 05:46:34.851
MYSELF FOR

05:46:37.586 --> 05:46:39.586
A FEW MINUTES.

05:46:45.507 --> 05:46:47.943
WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS WITH OUR 
YOU WEAR THIS FACTOR THAT FACT. 

05:46:48.156 --> 05:46:53.222
IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE, 
THAT IS FINE AND I'M NOT SAYING 

05:46:53.438 --> 05:46:55.872
THIS IS DELIBERATE BUT SOMETIMES
WE GET IT WRONG SO LET ME JUST 

05:46:56.073 --> 05:46:58.509
CLEAR THE RECORD ON ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT WAS SUGGESTED TO YOU

05:46:58.710 --> 05:47:00.744
THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT CANCELED
HIS TRIP BECAUSE OF A CONFLICT 

05:47:00.946 --> 05:47:02.946
OF THE TRIP TO CANADA

05:47:07.245 --> 05:47:10.084
, THAT WAS NOT IN THE TESTIMONY 
BUT IT HAS BEEN WAS I ASKED MY 

05:47:10.296 --> 05:47:12.317
COLLEAGUE WHITE WE SHOULD STOP 
TRIP PLANNING AND WHY THE VICE 

05:47:12.533 --> 05:47:14.554
PRESIDENT WOULD NOT BE ATTENDING
AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THE 

05:47:14.755 --> 05:47:20.657
PRESIDENT HAD DECIDED THAT HE 
WOULD NOT ATTEND. SO, JUST OFF 

05:47:20.858 --> 05:47:26.945
OF THAT CAUTION, DR. HILL, I 
WANT TO ASK YOU AND YOU MAY BE 

05:47:27.147 --> 05:47:31.617
AWARE OF SOME OF THE ATTACKS ON 
COLONEL VINDMAN SUGGESTING THAT 

05:47:31.829 --> 05:47:34.384
HE HAS A DUAL LT AND NOT REALLY 
LOYAL  TO AMERICA

05:47:37.916 --> 05:47:42.998
BUT I WANTED TO ASK WHAT YOU 
THINK OF THOSE ACCUSATIONS? 

05:47:42.999 --> 05:47:47.256
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS VERY  
UNFORTUNATE AND THIS IS A 

05:47:47.470 --> 05:47:49.470
COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS

05:47:52.740 --> 05:47:54.772
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF VERY FEW 
PEOPLE STILL HERE AND YVONNE 

05:47:54.973 --> 05:47:57.571
IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES 
AT SOME POINT IN THEIR FAMILY 

05:47:57.750 --> 05:48:01.676
HISTORY. THIS IS WHAT TIMMY 
REALLY DOES MAKE AMERICA GREAT 

05:48:01.890 --> 05:48:05.745
AND I'M SURE EVERY PERSON HERE, 
SOME CAME RELUCTANTLY AND OTHERS

05:48:05.945 --> 05:48:11.234
CAME BY CHOICES I DID BUT FOR ME
THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF WHY 

05:48:11.435 --> 05:48:15.416
WANTED TO BE HERE AND I THINK IT
IS UNFAIR, EVERYONE HAS

05:48:21.520 --> 05:48:23.540
SOMETHING AND I DO NOT BELIEVE

05:48:31.946 --> 05:48:34.383
THAT MY LOYALTY IS TO THE UNITED
KINGDOM. MY LOYALTY IS TO THE 

05:48:34.596 --> 05:48:36.615
UNITED STATES. THIS IS MY 
COUNTRY IN THE COUNTRY THAT I 

05:48:36.829 --> 05:48:39.622
SERVE AND I KNOW FOR FACT WITH 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY 

05:48:39.794 --> 05:48:41.903
COLLEAGUES IN MY OFFICE AND 
ACROSS THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

05:48:42.102 --> 05:48:44.538
COUNCIL, THEY FEEL EXACTLY THE 
SAME WAY AND I FEEL IT IS DEEPLY

05:48:44.738 --> 05:48:45.957
UNFAIR. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. YOU MENTIONED 

05:48:45.958 --> 05:48:49.339
SOMETHING IN YOUR TESTIMONY  AND
I THINK AT ONE POINT

05:48:53.676 --> 05:48:56.123
THEY TOLD YOU THE ROLE WAS TO 
MAKE DEALS, IS THAT RIGHT? 

05:48:56.124 --> 05:49:00.594
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU  ABOUT ONE 

05:49:00.793 --> 05:49:05.262
OF THOSE DEALS. THE ONE THAT WAS
DESCRIBED AS A DRUG DEAL. I HAVE

05:49:06.022 --> 05:49:08.022
THE INDICATION

05:49:11.553 --> 05:49:14.126
WITH THE JULY 10 MEETING AND 
THERE WERE TWO MEETINGS WITH

05:49:17.852 --> 05:49:20.500
THE WAR ROOM AND THERE WAS MORE 
THAT YOU HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT. 

05:49:20.700 --> 05:49:22.931
DO YOU WANT TO WALK US THROUGH 
THAT IN MORE DETAIL? 

05:49:22.932 --> 05:49:26.785
&gt;&gt;  THE REFERENCE WITH AFTER I 
RETURNED FROM THE BOARD ROOM AND

05:49:27.000 --> 05:49:32.268
RELAYED WHAT I HAD HEARD. THE 
SEQUENCING OF MEETINGS WHICH I 

05:49:32.482 --> 05:49:36.338
KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONCERN
ABOUT THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN 

05:49:37.104 --> 05:49:41.571
VARIOUS DEPOSITIONS SO WHAT 
HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 

05:49:41.748 --> 05:49:48.928
MEETING THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
CALLED SHORT WAS I HE TOLD ME TO

05:49:49.128 --> 05:49:52.941
HOLD BACK IN THE ROOM AND HE WAS
ESCORTING OUT THE UKRAINIAN 

05:49:53.120 --> 05:49:55.352
VISITORS ALONG WITH SECRETARY 
PERRY

05:50:00.303 --> 05:50:02.536
AND I GUESS THEY WANTED TO TAKE 
A QUICK PHOTOGRAPH OUTSIDE OF 

05:50:02.749 --> 05:50:04.972
HIS OFFICE AND I KNOW THAT 
SECRETARY PERRY AND OTHERS HAD 

05:50:05.152 --> 05:50:09.238
TWEETED OUT A PHOTOGRAPH AND IT 
WAS A PICTURE OF ALL OF THEM 

05:50:09.452 --> 05:50:13.103
STANDING JUST OUTSIDE OF 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON'S OFFICE. 

05:50:13.304 --> 05:50:16.357
QUICKLY HE CAME BACK IT UP AND 
AT THAT POINT I GUESS THEY WERE 

05:50:16.557 --> 05:50:22.246
ALREADY MOVING DOWN BECAUSE ON 
THE WAY OUT, AMBASSADOR SUMLIN 

05:50:22.448 --> 05:50:24.448
HAD SAID LET'S REGROUP IN THE 
BOARD ROOM

05:50:28.949 --> 05:50:31.384
FOR A QUICK HUDDLE OF NEXT STEPS
WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL TO BE 

05:50:31.585 --> 05:50:34.770
HONEST. WE DON'T USUALLY HUDDLE 
IN A ROOM IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO 

05:50:34.943 --> 05:50:39.706
DISCUSS NEXT STEPS WITH FOREIGN 
DELEGATIONS AND WE TOOK IT TO BE

05:50:39.921 --> 05:50:42.138
NEXT STEPS ON SETTING UP THE 
MEETING WHICH

05:50:47.639 --> 05:50:49.672
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS NOT 
PREPARED TO DO AND WHEN HE CAME 

05:50:49.873 --> 05:50:52.108
BACK INTO THE OFFICE, THAT WAS 
WHEN HE GAVE ME THE INSTRUCTION 

05:50:52.344 --> 05:50:58.761
TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS BEING 
DISCUSSED. AS I CAME INTO THE 

05:50:58.935 --> 05:51:00.935
BOARDROOM

05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:06.054
INVESTOR SONDLAND WAS AN 
EXCHANGE  AND THAT WAS WHEN I 

05:51:06.229 --> 05:51:10.945
NOTICED THAT HE LOOKED QUITE 
ALARMED. I KNOW VASSAR SONDLAND 

05:51:11.567 --> 05:51:17.219
WAS OUT AND I WATCHED ALL THE 
TESTIMONY AND THERE WERE SOME 

05:51:17.434 --> 05:51:21.354
QUESTIONS ABOUT YELLING AND 
SHOUTING. I CERTAINLY NEVER SAID

05:51:21.555 --> 05:51:24.927
THAT AND THERE WAS NO YELLING 
AND SHOUTING. THAT'S HOW PEOPLE 

05:51:25.198 --> 05:51:30.090
LIKE TO RETELL THE STORIES. WHEN
I CAME IN, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

05:51:30.291 --> 05:51:37.605
WAS IN AN EXCHANGE  WITH COLONEL
VINDMAN ALONG THE LINES OF  WE 

05:51:37.805 --> 05:51:43.089
HAVE AN AGREEMENT TO HAVE THIS 
MEETING AND I CAME IN AND I 

05:51:43.291 --> 05:51:48.162
ASKED WHAT IS GOING ON AND HE 
SAID AND THIS IS THE UKRAINIANS 

05:51:48.375 --> 05:51:51.976
BUT AT THIS POINT I WANT TO 
STRESS THAT SECRETARY PERRY HAD 

05:51:52.155 --> 05:51:54.155
LEFT.

05:51:59.944 --> 05:52:01.778
THE COLLEAGUES WERE LEAVING SO 
SECRETARY PERRY HAS NO 

05:52:01.779 --> 05:52:04.143
RECOLLECTION OF THIS MEETING 
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT IN IT SO WHEN

05:52:04.321 --> 05:52:08.068
I CAME IN, GORDON SONDLAND WAS 
SAYING WE HAVE A DEAL HERE  THAT

05:52:08.269 --> 05:52:12.538
THEY WILL BE MEETING AND I HAVE 
A DEAL WITH THE CHIEF OF STAFF 

05:52:12.739 --> 05:52:17.363
AND THEY WILL BE A MEETING IF 
THEY ANNOUNCE THESE 

05:52:17.539 --> 05:52:24.729
INVESTIGATIONS INTO 2016 AND 
BARIZMA AND I  CUT IT OFF 

05:52:24.927 --> 05:52:26.762
BECAUSE HAVING HEARD MR. 
GIULIANI OVER AND OVER AGAIN 

05:52:26.763 --> 05:52:31.832
WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HE 
WAS ASSERTING, BY THIS POINT, IT

05:52:32.045 --> 05:52:35.497
WAS CLEAR THAT BARIZMA WAS CODE 
FOR THE BIDENS BECAUSE  RUDY 

05:52:36.258 --> 05:52:39.965
GIULIANI WAS LEAVING IT OUT 
THERE AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 

05:52:40.724 --> 05:52:45.035
HE WAS ALARMED. HE SAID WE 
CANNOT BE INVOLVED IN THIS AND 

05:52:45.249 --> 05:52:48.651
I'VE LEARNED SINCE FROM MR. 
HOLMES WITH HIS RENDITION TODAY 

05:52:48.828 --> 05:52:56.218
THAT TRINITY HAD ALREADY WARNED 
THE UKRAINIANS AND PRESIDENT 

05:52:56.419 --> 05:53:02.909
ZELENSKY TO STAY OUT OF AMERICAN
POLITICS . SO, I CUT THIS OFF 

05:53:03.125 --> 05:53:05.125
AND I SAID

05:53:13.276 --> 05:53:15.709
WE NEED PROCEDURES AND HE MADE 
IT CLEAR WE CAN'T SET UP THE 

05:53:15.911 --> 05:53:18.146
MEETING RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE TO
PREPARE THIS THROUGH THE PROPER 

05:53:18.358 --> 05:53:20.390
PROCESS AND I KNOW THIS SOUNDS 
BORING BUT WE HAVE NATIONAL 

05:53:20.590 --> 05:53:22.590
SECURITY PROCEDURES AND I SAID 
WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT 

05:53:22.621 --> 05:53:25.190
THIS IN FRONT OF OUR COLLEAGUES 
FROM UKRAINE. THIS IS COMPLETELY

05:53:25.367 --> 05:53:30.944
INAPPROPRIATE AND HE AGREED AND 
WE ASKED TO MOVE OUTSIDE THE 

05:53:31.144 --> 05:53:33.144
BOARD ROOM AND I EXPLAINED

05:53:36.834 --> 05:53:38.834
THIS WHICH IS ALSO EXTREMELY 
AWKWARD BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NOT 

05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:43.137
HAVE BEEN STANDING AROUND IN THE
WEST WING AT THIS PARTICULAR 

05:53:43.339 --> 05:53:45.339
JUNCTION AND THAT IS WHEN I 
PUSHED BACK FROM AMBASSADOR 

05:53:45.372 --> 05:53:49.425
SONDLAND AND SAID  I KNOW THE 
DIFFERENCES AND WE ARE TRYING TO

05:53:50.177 --> 05:53:52.177
FIGURE OUT

05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:59.179
WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY ACTIONS 
AND AT THAT POINT I THINK IT HAD

05:53:59.594 --> 05:54:01.594
BEEN SET FOR JULY 21.

05:54:05.280 --> 05:54:07.501
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WOULD LIKE TO 
WAIT UNTIL AFTER THAT TO 

05:54:08.052 --> 05:54:12.785
BASICALLY SEE WHETHER THEY GET 
THE MAJORITY WHICH WOULD ENABLE 

05:54:13.000 --> 05:54:18.887
TO HIM TO MOVE FORWARD. 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID FAIR 

05:54:19.648 --> 05:54:23.957
ENOUGH  AND HE REALIZED HE WOULD
NOT BE ABLE TO PUSH THIS FURTHER

05:54:24.171 --> 05:54:28.223
AND HE DIDN'T SAME THING AT THIS
PARTICULAR JUNCTURE AND THEN HE 

05:54:28.479 --> 05:54:32.493
SAID HE HAD ANOTHER MEETING AND 
THEY ALL LEFT. I WENT BACK UP 

05:54:32.907 --> 05:54:36.759
AND RELAYED THIS TO AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON WHICH IS WHEN HE GAVE ME 

05:54:36.961 --> 05:54:39.194
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS THAT WE 
HAVE BEEN THROUGH TO TALK TO 

05:54:39.946 --> 05:54:46.253
JOHN EISENBERG IN THE COUNCILS 
OFFICE. 

05:54:46.254 --> 05:54:48.254
&gt;&gt; 

05:54:50.771 --> 05:54:52.771
AS SOON AS I

05:54:56.259 --> 05:54:58.259
DON'T CUT OFF,

05:55:07.838 --> 05:55:09.664
YOU MAY PROCEED. 
&gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T YOUR BOSS TALK 

05:55:09.665 --> 05:55:11.665
ABOUT IT, MR. HOLMES? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT QUESTION SEVEN 

05:55:11.698 --> 05:55:14.136
WHY DID YOUR BOSS BRING UP THE 
CALL THAT YOU OVERHEARD AND THE 

05:55:14.339 --> 05:55:16.772
REASON YOU ARE HERE TODAY?  YOU 
ARE THE CLOSING WITNESS YET THE 

05:55:16.973 --> 05:55:19.007
STAR WITNESS IN THE FIRST 
WITNESS DIDN'T EVEN BRING IT UP.

05:55:19.208 --> 05:55:22.258
WHEN WE DEPOSE YOU, YOU SAID 
THIS WAS A DISTINCTIVE 

05:55:22.458 --> 05:55:24.291
EXPERIENCE AMONG THE MOST 
REMARKABLE EVENTS. USE IT AFTER 

05:55:24.292 --> 05:55:28.172
THE CALL HAPPENED, I MERELY TOLD
THE DEPUTY CHIEF ABOUT THE CALL.

05:55:28.350 --> 05:55:31.600
THEN YOU STUDY WENT ON VACATION 
AND TOLD SEVERAL FRIENDS AND 

05:55:31.800 --> 05:55:34.696
FAMILY ABOUT THE CALL AND THEN 
YOU COME BACK AND YOU TELL 

05:55:34.869 --> 05:55:38.915
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR ABOUT THE 
CALL. THEN IN YOUR DEPOSITION 

05:55:39.117 --> 05:55:44.958
STATEMENT, YOU SAY ARE PURELY 
FOR TO THE CALL IN MEETINGS AND 

05:55:45.137 --> 05:55:48.052
CONVERSATIONS WHERE THIS WAS 
RELEVANT. I REPEATEDLY REFERRED 

05:55:48.292 --> 05:55:51.025
TO THE CALL IN MEETINGS AND 
CONVERSATIONS WHERE THE INTEREST

05:55:52.121 --> 05:55:54.121
WAS RELEVANT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE 
GOVERNMENT

05:55:57.809 --> 05:56:00.401
AND YOU TOLD EVERYBODY AT THE 
STAR WITNESS IN THE FIRST 

05:56:00.576 --> 05:56:02.576
WITNESS

05:56:03.693 --> 05:56:05.927
, WHEN HE CAME HERE, HE RELATED 
13 CONVERSATIONS HE HAD BETWEEN 

05:56:06.691 --> 05:56:11.339
JULY 18 WAS SEPTEMBER 11 WHEN IT
WAS RELEASED IN 13 DIFFERENT 

05:56:11.508 --> 05:56:13.374
CONVERSATIONS AND NEVER ONCE 
MENTIONING THIS CALL. JULY 19, 

05:56:13.375 --> 05:56:18.316
HE SAID WHAT THEY TOLD THEM AND 
SONDLAND TOLD ABOUT THE 

05:56:18.531 --> 05:56:23.110
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY CALL . JULY 
20 TELLING TAYLOR WHAT

05:56:28.284 --> 05:56:31.732
THEY TOLD PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. 
AUGUST 16, VOLKER TELLS  TAYLOR.

05:56:32.495 --> 05:56:34.495
AUGUST 21,

05:56:36.603 --> 05:56:40.165
MORRISON TALKS TO TAYLOR. AUGUST
WHEN I, TOO TALK TO TAYLOR.

05:56:44.122 --> 05:56:48.790
SEPTEMBER 2, HE TELLS THEM WHAT 
HE TOLD MORRISON AND MORRISON 

05:56:48.998 --> 05:56:54.074
TELLS TAYLOR WHAT SONDLAND TOLD 
TRUMP  IN SEPTEMBER 8, SONDLAND 

05:56:54.312 --> 05:56:57.724
TOLD TAYLOR WHAT TRUMP TOLD 
SONDLAND. NOWHERE  IS THERE A 

05:56:57.936 --> 05:57:01.187
HOLMES TELLS TAYLOR WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

05:57:01.390 --> 05:57:07.598
TOLD SONDLAND.  I WILL GIVE YOU 
A CHANCE IN A SECOND.

05:57:12.763 --> 05:57:14.784
13 CONVERSATIONS FROM THE STAR 
WITNESS AND YOU ARE THE CLOSING 

05:57:14.998 --> 05:57:17.633
WITNESS AND HE CAN'T REMEMBER A 
CALL FROM A GUY HE WORKS WITH 

05:57:17.833 --> 05:57:22.036
EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHY? 
&gt;&gt; IMMEDIATELY 

05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:30.425
, AFTER THIS LUNCH ON THE 26th, 
I TOLD MY DIRECT SUPERVISOR AND 

05:57:30.637 --> 05:57:34.489
THE DEPUTY CHIEF ADMISSION THAT 
I WOULD'VE TOLD AMBASSADOR 

05:57:34.691 --> 05:57:36.727
TAYLOR IMMEDIATELY BUT HE WAS ON
THE FRONT LINES THAT AFTERNOON 

05:57:36.926 --> 05:57:40.380
AND THEN I WILL ONE ON AS A 
TESTIFIED AND CAME BACK THE 

05:57:41.129 --> 05:57:44.194
FOLLOWING MONDAY AND ON TUESDAY 
I WAS BACK IN THE MASTER'S 

05:57:44.369 --> 05:57:47.218
OFFICE WHERE I REFERRED TO THE 
CALL IN THAT

05:57:52.567 --> 05:57:54.802
WEEK AND IT WAS MY ASSUMPTION 
THAT THE DEPUTY CHIEF WOULD HAVE

05:57:55.015 --> 05:57:57.033
INFORMED OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THE 
CALL AS WELL SO MY RECOLLECTION 

05:57:57.247 --> 05:58:00.814
IS WHEN I DID REFER TO THAT CALL
THAT AMBASSADOR TAYLOR NODDED

05:58:04.349 --> 05:58:08.215
AS IF HE HAD BEEN BRIEFED ON IT 
SO I REFERRED TO THE CALL AND 

05:58:08.418 --> 05:58:10.418
MENTIONED SOME OF MY TAKEAWAYS

05:58:14.107 --> 05:58:16.138
IN THE MAIN TAKE AWAY WAS THE 
PRESIDENT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT 

05:58:16.339 --> 05:58:18.774
UKRAINE SO WE WILL HAVE A TOUGH 
ROAD AHEAD TO CONVINCE HIM THAT 

05:58:18.980 --> 05:58:22.425
IT IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO 
SCHEDULE AN OFFICE MEETING AND 

05:58:22.627 --> 05:58:26.491
ULTIMATELY TO RELEASE HIS HOLD 
ON SECURITY SYSTEMS. THAT WAS 

05:58:26.692 --> 05:58:29.743
THE TAKE AWAY AND THAT IS WHAT I
REFERRED TO REPEATEDLY WHENEVER 

05:58:29.943 --> 05:58:31.943
IT BECAME RELEVANT AND I WILL 
REMIND YOU

05:58:35.833 --> 05:58:37.663
ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING. 
THROUGHOUT THIS TIME AS A 

05:58:37.664 --> 05:58:43.555
TESTIFIED, WE ARE TRYING TO FIND
A FORMULA AND THINGS WE COULD DO

05:58:43.756 --> 05:58:45.824
WITH UKRAINIANS THAT WOULD 
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY

05:58:46.000 --> 05:58:49.440
WERE WORTH TALKING TO. 
&gt;&gt;  MAYBE MR. HOLMES THE TAKE 

05:58:49.655 --> 05:58:55.341
AWAY THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS NO 
BIG DEAL BECAUSE HE ALREADY 

05:58:55.542 --> 05:58:59.196
KNEW. HE DIDN'T REMEMBER BECAUSE
WE ALREADY HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT. 

05:58:59.597 --> 05:59:01.597
WE HAD THE TRUMP

05:59:07.732 --> 05:59:09.752
ZELENSKY TRANSCRIPT I HAVE BEEN 
OUT FOR TWO MONTHS EVEN THOUGH 

05:59:09.966 --> 05:59:11.966
EUROPE REALLY BRING THIS 
CONVERSATION UP AS HE SAID TO 

05:59:11.999 --> 05:59:17.484
EVERYONE  WHEN THERE IS ANY TIME
A TALK ABOUT UKRAINE, MAYBE IT 

05:59:17.725 --> 05:59:22.554
WAS THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE CALL 
HAPPENED ON JULY 25 AND IT HAS 

05:59:22.756 --> 05:59:24.756
BEEN OUT FOR TWO MONTHS AND 
MAYBE THE AMBASSADOR THOUGHT 

05:59:24.788 --> 05:59:27.145
THIS WAS NOTHING NEW HERE. LAST 
WEEK, YOU COME FORWARD

05:59:31.703 --> 05:59:33.703
WITH NEW INFORMATION AND THERE 
IS NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT 

05:59:33.724 --> 05:59:36.975
WE HAD IN THE TRANSCRIPT. MAYBE 
THAT IS THE REASON THE STAR 

05:59:37.176 --> 05:59:39.412
WITNESS IN THE FIRST WITNESS 
DIDN'T BRING IT UP BUT THEY HAD 

05:59:39.611 --> 05:59:41.690
TO HAVE SOMETHING SO YOU ARE THE
CLOSING WITNESS BECAUSE YOU 

05:59:41.868 --> 05:59:43.868
OVERHEARD THE PRESIDENT

05:59:46.317 --> 05:59:48.348
TALKING TO AMBASSADOR SONDLAND. 
&gt;&gt; I SEE FOUR SECONDS LEFT ON 

05:59:48.560 --> 05:59:54.033
THE CLOCK.  I BELIEVE -- 
&gt;&gt; YOU MAY TAKE AS LONG AS YOU 

05:59:54.248 --> 05:59:55.463
NEED. 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

05:59:55.464 --> 05:59:58.451
DID  KNOW WHEN HE RETURNED AND 
IT WAS NOT NEWS TO HIM

06:00:06.223 --> 06:00:08.389
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESSING 
FOR A BIDEN INVESTIGATION. 

06:00:08.390 --> 06:00:10.543
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED. I 
ASKED WHY HE DIDN'T SHARE WITH 

06:00:10.715 --> 06:00:12.123
US. 
&gt;&gt; PLEASE DO NOT INTERRUPT THE 

06:00:12.124 --> 06:00:14.559
WITNESS ANY FURTHER.  YOUR TIME 
IS EXPIRED BUT HIS IS NOT. YOU 

06:00:14.759 --> 06:00:17.130
MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EXACTLY MY POINT. 

06:00:24.512 --> 06:00:26.749
WHEN WE COME BACK, I REFERRED TO
THE CALL AND EVERYONE WAS 

06:00:26.948 --> 06:00:29.385
NODDING. OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT 
IS GOING ON AND OF COURSE THE 

06:00:29.584 --> 06:00:31.915
PRESIDENT IS PRESSING FOR A 
BIDEN INVESTIGATION. THERE WAS 

06:00:32.232 --> 06:00:34.802
NODDING AGREEMENT. DID I GO 
THROUGH EVERY SINGLE WORD IN THE

06:00:34.977 --> 06:00:39.336
CALL? NO BECAUSE EVERYONE AT 
THAT POINT AGREED AND IT WAS 

06:00:39.538 --> 06:00:41.570
OBVIOUS WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
PRESSING FOR AND AS YOU JUST 

06:00:41.771 --> 06:00:47.054
ALLEN, AMBASSADOR TAYLOR HAD ALL
THOSE OTHER INTERACTIONS -- 

06:00:47.055 --> 06:00:49.289
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T SHARE WITH US. 
&gt;&gt; PLEASE DO NOT INTERRUPT. 

06:00:49.290 --> 06:00:52.665
&gt;&gt; MY VIVID  RECOLLECTION WAS A 
TOUCHSTONE EXPERIENCE THAT TO ME

06:00:54.115 --> 06:00:58.017
VALIDATED WHAT WE BELIEVED.

06:01:02.896 --> 06:01:04.112
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WAS ON THE 
CALL. 

06:01:04.113 --> 06:01:07.306
&gt;&gt; ALL OF A SUDDEN LAST WEEK -- 
&gt;&gt;  MR. JORDAN, ALLOW THE

06:01:11.636 --> 06:01:13.867
WITNESS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL FINISH WITH THIS. HE 

06:01:14.067 --> 06:01:16.067
WAS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS AS YOU 

06:01:16.102 --> 06:01:18.102
OUTLINED  THAT BROUGHT TO THE 
SAME CONCLUSION.

06:01:21.786 --> 06:01:24.584
&gt;&gt; MR. JORDAN, MR. JORDAN, YOU 
MAY NOT LIKE  THE WITNESSES 

06:01:24.759 --> 06:01:28.037
ANSWER BUT WE WILL HEAR THE 
WITNESSES ANSWER. HAVE YOU 

06:01:28.215 --> 06:01:30.215
CONCLUDED

06:01:35.195 --> 06:01:36.613
,  MR. HOLMES? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE. 

06:01:36.614 --> 06:01:38.446
&gt;&gt; MR. HINES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

06:01:38.447 --> 06:01:40.506
DR. HILL,  HE MADE A FAIRLY 
DEMONIC COMMENT WHICH THE 

06:01:40.680 --> 06:01:45.599
WRECKING MEMBER TOOK SOME 
EXCEPTION. I'M MORE INTERESTED 

06:01:45.777 --> 06:01:48.401
IN THE UKRAINE PIECE OF THIS BUT
YOU SAID SOME OF YOU ON THIS 

06:01:48.602 --> 06:01:50.633
COMMITTEE APPEARED TO BELIEVE 
THAT RUSSIA AND THE SECURITY 

06:01:50.834 --> 06:01:52.834
SERVICE TO NOT CONDUCT A 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST OUR COUNTRY AND

06:01:52.866 --> 06:01:56.722
PERHAPS SOMEHOW FOR SOME REASON 
UKRAINE DID. I AM MUCH MORE 

06:01:56.922 --> 06:02:01.604
INTERESTED IN THE UKRAINIAN 
PIECE OF THIS BUT I DO WANT TO 

06:02:01.805 --> 06:02:04.038
SAY BRIEFLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MY COLLEAGUES BELIEVE BUT I DO 

06:02:04.240 --> 06:02:08.253
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF WHAT
THE EFFECTS ARE OF CREATING 

06:02:08.430 --> 06:02:11.505
AMBIGUITY AND LACKING CLARITY 
AND CONVICTION

06:02:19.279 --> 06:02:21.514
AROUND THE RUSSIAN ATTACK ON THE
ELECTION OF 2016 AND IN RESPONSE

06:02:21.713 --> 06:02:23.748
TO YOUR COMMENT, THE RANKING 
MEMBER OFFERED UP A REPORT WHICH

06:02:23.947 --> 06:02:28.214
VARIES IN MATERIAL RESPECTS FROM
THE REPORT THAT IS ARE RICK 

06:02:28.616 --> 06:02:30.649
CREATED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE. A DAY DOES NOT GO BY 

06:02:31.264 --> 06:02:33.833
IN WHICH RANKING MEMBER NUNEZ 
DOES NOT SPEAK OF THE RUSSIAN 

06:02:34.011 --> 06:02:39.319
HOAX AND THIS IS AN AREA IN 
WHICH CONTEXT IS PRETTY 

06:02:39.609 --> 06:02:43.035
IMPORTANT. LET ME READ YOU A 
COMMENT BY ANOTHER SENIOR 

06:02:43.248 --> 06:02:45.884
OFFICIAL. WHY DID THE NATIONAL 
COMMITTEE TURNED DOWN THE DHS 

06:02:46.084 --> 06:02:49.948
OFFER TO PROTECT AGAINST HACKS? 
IT IS ALL A BIG HOAX

06:02:53.808 --> 06:02:56.442
. WHY DID THE DNC REFUSED TO 
TURN OVER ITS SERVER TO THE FBI?

06:02:56.643 --> 06:02:58.643
IT IS ALL A BIG

06:03:04.576 --> 06:03:06.594
SCAM. DO YOU KNOW WHO SAID THOSE
THINGS, DR. HILL? 

06:03:06.595 --> 06:03:08.595
&gt;&gt; I DON'T. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

06:03:08.632 --> 06:03:12.617
UNITED STATES.  MY POINT IS AND 
TELL ME IF YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE

06:03:13.914 --> 06:03:16.484
, AMBIGUITY AND A FAILURE TO 
NAME AND SHAME THE RUSSIANS

06:03:22.655 --> 06:03:24.724
FOR THE ATTACK, THAT IS NOT THE 
SERVICE OF OUR NATIONAL 

06:03:24.900 --> 06:03:26.105
SECURITY, IS IT? 
&gt;&gt; IS NOT. 

06:03:26.106 --> 06:03:29.757
&gt;&gt; LET'S TURN TO UKRAINE.  DR. 
HILL, YOU CHARACTERIZE THE IDEA 

06:03:30.522 --> 06:03:32.522
THAT UKRAINE

06:03:40.731 --> 06:03:42.549
INTERFERED AS A FICTIONAL 
NARRATIVE. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY 

06:03:42.550 --> 06:03:44.550
EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT UKRAINE 
INTERFERED IN THE 2016 ELECTION?

06:03:44.583 --> 06:03:47.232
&gt;&gt; WELL, I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME 
TWO EXHIBITS I WAS POINTED TO  

06:03:47.432 --> 06:03:50.266
DURING THE DEPOSITION I GAVE ON 
OCTOBER 14 AND I'M QUITE 

06:03:50.482 --> 06:03:52.713
DREADFUL THAT THEY POINTED ME IN
THIS DIRECTION. I WAS PRESENTED 

06:03:52.914 --> 06:03:58.346
DURING MY DEPOSITION WITH TWO 
ARTICLES WERE TWO PIECES OF 

06:03:58.526 --> 06:04:04.287
INFORMATION AND ONE WAS THAT THE
UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR CHARLIE 

06:04:04.702 --> 06:04:06.702
WROTE IN 2016

06:04:09.975 --> 06:04:11.975
AND THIS IS DURING THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WHEN 

06:04:12.172 --> 06:04:16.678
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS THE NOMINEE 
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND 

06:04:16.879 --> 06:04:21.593
THIS IS AMBASSADOR CHARLIE THAT 
WAS THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR 

06:04:22.315 --> 06:04:24.315
BEING CRITICAL

06:04:26.234 --> 06:04:28.464
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO WAS IN 
THE NOMINEE FOR THE REPUBLICAN 

06:04:28.664 --> 06:04:30.664
PARTY FOR MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT

06:04:37.202 --> 06:04:39.020
UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. 
&gt;&gt; MAY I INTERRUPT YOU THERE? 

06:04:39.021 --> 06:04:41.618
LET ME BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT 
WHAT THOSE COMMENTS WERE.  THEY 

06:04:41.801 --> 06:04:45.923
SAID FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD, 
THEY WOULD RATHER BE WITH RUSSIA

06:04:46.136 --> 06:04:48.569
THEM WHERE THEY WERE SO 
AMBASSADOR CHARLIE IS RESPONDING

06:04:49.332 --> 06:04:53.440
TO THAT IN THE ARTICLE, CORRECT?
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT  AND THE 

06:04:53.652 --> 06:04:59.339
WHOLE ARTICLE IS ABOUT UKRAINE 
AND THIS IS STANDARD FOR ANYONE 

06:04:59.741 --> 06:05:07.262
AND YOU CAN PICK SOMETHING THAT 
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD SAY. 

06:05:07.664 --> 06:05:15.385
AMBASSADOR TROY TALKS ABOUT 
UKRAINE'S POSITION. 

06:05:15.386 --> 06:05:17.819
&gt;&gt; LET ME JUST READ BECAUSE IT 
IS WORTH PEOPLE HEARING  WHAT 

06:05:18.071 --> 06:05:23.106
THE SEVERE ATTACK ON CANDIDATE 
TRUMP WHO IS SUGGESTED, 

06:05:23.306 --> 06:05:25.306
AMBASSADOR CHARLIE WRITES

06:05:28.588 --> 06:05:30.823
EVEN IF THE COMMENTS ARE ONLY 
SPECULATIVE AND DO NOT REFLECT A

06:05:31.026 --> 06:05:34.675
FUTURE FOREIGN POLICY, THEY CALL
FOR APPEASEMENT OF AN AGGRESSOR 

06:05:35.089 --> 06:05:37.273
AND SUPPORT THE VIOLATION OF A 
SOVEREIGN COUNTRY WITH 

06:05:37.447 --> 06:05:42.148
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND 
INTERNATIONAL LAW. THAT IS THE 

06:05:42.329 --> 06:05:47.835
ATTACK ON CANDIDATE TRUMP. DOES 
THAT SOUND LIKE ELECTION 

06:05:48.021 --> 06:05:50.021
INTERFERENCE

06:05:51.744 --> 06:05:53.744
TO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; YOU NEVER KNOW WHO WILL WIN  

06:05:53.777 --> 06:06:00.220
AND I THINK THE SECOND PIECE 
THAT WAS PRESENTED TO ME, I WANT

06:06:00.394 --> 06:06:05.963
TO THANK YOU FOR GOING BACK AND 
READING IT AGAIN AND I DID 

06:06:06.165 --> 06:06:08.599
REMEMBER THE PEACE AND AS YOU 
POINT OUT AN EXTREMELY GOOD 

06:06:08.800 --> 06:06:14.497
JOURNALIST BUT I REMEMBERED 
READING THIS BACK IN THE DAY BUT

06:06:14.697 --> 06:06:21.634
I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AND YOU 
GAVE ME A COPY AND I WENT BACK 

06:06:21.809 --> 06:06:24.465
AND READ IT AGAIN BECAUSE I 
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND GETS 

06:06:24.649 --> 06:06:29.521
TO THIS ISSUE HERE. MR. VOGEL 
POINTS OUT THAT THE UKRAINIAN 

06:06:29.720 --> 06:06:31.864
GOVERNMENT AND THEY WOULD NOT 
HAVE DONE VERY WELL

06:06:34.956 --> 06:06:36.956
.

06:06:40.090 --> 06:06:45.171
THEY ARE BACK ON HILLARY CLINTON
WINNING THE ELECTION. THEY HAVE 

06:06:45.932 --> 06:06:47.932
EQUIPMENT CAMPAIGN AND

06:06:52.274 --> 06:06:58.772
WE HAVE SOME UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS
IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT

06:06:58.973 --> 06:07:05.019
HAVE BEEN NAMED AND TALKS ABOUT 
HOW THEY WERE TRYING TO COLLECT 

06:07:05.195 --> 06:07:07.195
INFORMATION WITH THE RANKING 
MEMBER

06:07:10.558 --> 06:07:12.994
AND OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. 
HOWEVER, I DO WANT TO POINT OUT 

06:07:13.194 --> 06:07:17.824
THAT THE ARTICLE HERE, THERE WAS
LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A TOP-DOWN 

06:07:18.001 --> 06:07:22.131
EFFORT BY UKRAINE AND THAT MAKES
A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE 

06:07:22.332 --> 06:07:26.938
RUSSIAN EFFORT THAT WAS BY 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN AND HAS

06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:33.104
MILITARY SERVICES. I DON'T THINK
THOSE THINGS ARE EXACTLY THE 

06:07:33.306 --> 06:07:39.807
SAME AND I ALSO MENTIONED IN MY 
DEPOSITION OF OCTOBER 14 THAT IN

06:07:40.008 --> 06:07:45.693
FACT MANY OFFICIALS FROM MANY 
COUNTRIES INCLUDING UKRAINE 

06:07:46.108 --> 06:07:52.596
BELIEVE THAT SECRETARY CLINTON 
WAS GOING TO WIN AND MANY SAID 

06:07:52.810 --> 06:07:56.398
SOME PRETTY DISPARAGING THINGS 
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I 

06:07:56.584 --> 06:08:01.053
CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR FEELING LIKE
THIS. WHEN WE WERE

06:08:04.986 --> 06:08:07.435
SETTING UP, I REMEMBER I HAD A 
PORTFOLIO OF 50+ COUNTRIES WITH 

06:08:07.635 --> 06:08:12.105
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE 
THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO COLLECT AS

06:08:12.306 --> 06:08:15.154
MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT COMMENTS 
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SAID 

06:08:15.355 --> 06:08:19.409
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN WHEN HE WAS EITHER ONE 

06:08:19.622 --> 06:08:22.181
OF THE CANDIDATES TO BE THE 
NOMINEE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

06:08:25.508 --> 06:08:27.340
OR WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY THE 
CANDIDATE RUNNING AGAINST 

06:08:27.341 --> 06:08:31.201
HILLARY CLINTON AND AM SORRY TO 
SAY THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT AND I 

06:08:31.393 --> 06:08:33.240
SHOULD NOT BRING THEM HERE 
BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE 

06:08:33.241 --> 06:08:36.075
CONSEQUENCES AND AN AWFUL LOT 
ART SENIOR OFFICIALS THAT SAID 

06:08:36.277 --> 06:08:38.277
SOME PRETTY HURTFUL THINGS ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT

06:08:42.564 --> 06:08:44.802
AND I WOULD ALSO PERSONALLY TAKE
OFFENSE TO SOME OF THE THINGS 

06:08:45.013 --> 06:08:47.036
THAT WAS THAT IF I WERE THE 
PRESIDENT BUT THE DIFFERENCE 

06:08:47.248 --> 06:08:49.482
HERE IS THAT IT HASN'T HAD ANY 
MAJOR IMPACT ON HIS FEELINGS 

06:08:49.682 --> 06:08:55.771
TOWARDS THOSE COUNTRIES. NOT 
THAT I HAVE SEEN. I'VE ALSO 

06:08:55.970 --> 06:08:59.641
HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY AND HE 
SAID IT IN PUBLIC SO I'M NOT 

06:08:59.839 --> 06:09:03.090
REVEALING ANY EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE THAT UKRAINE "TRIED TO

06:09:03.290 --> 06:09:09.580
TAKE ME DOWN." AMBASSADOR 
CHARLIE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND 

06:09:09.794 --> 06:09:14.198
THERE WERE SOME PRETTY 
UNPLEASANT STATEMENTS AND 

06:09:14.377 --> 06:09:16.377
ILL-ADVISED THINGS BUT

06:09:23.604 --> 06:09:25.839
THERE ARE A WHOLE LIST OF 
INVESTORS THAT TWEET IT OUT AND 

06:09:26.039 --> 06:09:28.274
HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT AS WELL AND IT DID NOT

06:09:28.475 --> 06:09:30.717
AFFECT HAVING MEETINGS WITH THEM
AND IF IT WOULD, THERE WOULD BE 

06:09:30.909 --> 06:09:36.192
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE MET WITH. 

06:09:36.193 --> 06:09:38.842
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I SEEK UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT TO ADD TO THE RECORD  A 

06:09:39.042 --> 06:09:41.275
POLITICAL ARTICLE OF DECEMBER 1 
OF 2016 ENTITLED RUSSIA ACCUSES 

06:09:41.478 --> 06:09:43.478
UKRAINE OF SABOTAGING TRUMP

06:09:47.781 --> 06:09:49.398
AND OUTLINES THE RUSSIAN SENIOR 
OFFICIALS MAKING ALLEGATIONS 

06:09:49.399 --> 06:09:52.852
THAT THERE WAS UKRAINIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 

06:09:53.255 --> 06:09:56.303
ELECTION. 
&gt;&gt; NO OBJECTION.  

06:09:56.304 --> 06:09:59.353
&gt;&gt; MR. CONAWAY. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD MY  TIME. 

06:09:59.354 --> 06:10:04.222
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YELLING.  I 
WANT TO GO WHERE CONGRESSMAN 

06:10:04.424 --> 06:10:06.424
HINES LEFT OFF AND

06:10:11.943 --> 06:10:14.177
DR. HILL, HE WAS NOT DEFENDING 
YOU BUT HIMSELF AND DEMOCRATS. I

06:10:14.380 --> 06:10:16.613
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE RECORD IS 
VERY CLEAR. RANKING MEMBER NUNEZ

06:10:16.814 --> 06:10:19.179
WAS CORRECT. HE CORRECTLY NOTED 
IN HIS OPENING THAT REPUBLICANS

06:10:26.165 --> 06:10:28.400
WITH THE FIRST ONES TO RAISE THE
ISSUE OF RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN

06:10:28.601 --> 06:10:31.035
THE 2016 ELECTION AND THE 
DISAGREEMENT WAS ABOUT RUSSIAN 

06:10:31.250 --> 06:10:35.715
MEDDLING BUT ABOUT WHETHER OR 
NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP CONSPIRED 

06:10:36.478 --> 06:10:39.273
WITH RUSSIA, A FALSE ALLEGATION

06:10:43.837 --> 06:10:48.909
SPECIFICALLY BY SOME DEMOCRATS 
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH THAT,

06:10:49.151 --> 06:10:51.558
I WANT TO TURN TO YOU IN THE 
PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH 

06:10:52.324 --> 06:10:56.428
YOUR TESTIMONY WHERE YOU SAID 
YOU HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY 

06:10:56.842 --> 06:11:02.527
WILL HE DO THE INVESTIGATION AND
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID HE HE 

06:11:02.728 --> 06:11:06.581
WILL DO ANYTHING YOU ASK HIM TO.
IS THAT RIGHT? 

06:11:06.582 --> 06:11:08.974
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID  PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY

06:11:09.149 --> 06:11:11.149
NEXT?

06:11:16.738 --> 06:11:18.738
&gt;&gt; HE SAID WHAT ABOUT SWEDEN 

06:11:22.638 --> 06:11:23.854
.  
&gt;&gt; HE SAID WHAT? 

06:11:23.855 --> 06:11:26.414
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, I NEED LOOK BACK 
TO THE CONVERSATION .

06:11:33.800 --> 06:11:39.085
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, THEN THEY TURNED TO 
THE SWEDEN CONVERSATION.  HE 

06:11:39.283 --> 06:11:42.735
SAID GOOD, WHAT ABOUT SWEDEN. 
&gt;&gt; GOOD, WHAT ABOUT SWEDEN.  WHY

06:11:42.953 --> 06:11:47.165
ISN'T THAT IN YOUR STATEMENT? 
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A WORD FOR WORD 

06:11:51.274 --> 06:11:52.489
EVERY SINGLE WORD OF THE 
CONVERSATION. 

06:11:52.490 --> 06:11:55.085
&gt;&gt; BUT IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
PART OF THE CONVERSATION. 

06:11:58.793 --> 06:12:01.027
&gt;&gt; THEN THEY TURNED TO SWEDEN, 
THEY TURNED TO THE OTHER TOPIC. 

06:12:01.228 --> 06:12:04.681
&gt;&gt; RESPECTFULLY, THIS 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY  IS BASED ON

06:12:04.932 --> 06:12:07.114
THE CALL THE DAY BEFORE WERE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS PART OF A 

06:12:07.313 --> 06:12:11.128
BRIBERY SCHEME IS PART OF THE 
EXTORTION SCHEME IN A QUID PRO 

06:12:11.306 --> 06:12:17.268
QUO AND DEMANDED INVESTIGATIONS 
IN EXCHANGE FOR EITHER MILITARY 

06:12:17.484 --> 06:12:19.484
AID OR WHITE HOUSE MEETINGS

06:12:22.554 --> 06:12:24.788
IN THE NEXT DAY YOU WERE WITNESS
TO RECEIVING WORD THAT THE 

06:12:25.189 --> 06:12:27.189
BRIBERY SCHEME WAS SUCCESSFUL.

06:12:31.892 --> 06:12:33.892
HIS RESPONSE WAS GOOD

06:12:37.584 --> 06:12:39.617
,  WHAT ABOUT SWEDEN. 
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR. THAT WAS EXTREMELY 

06:12:40.380 --> 06:12:43.886
BRIEF.  
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THE 

06:12:44.088 --> 06:12:46.088
PRESIDENT SETTLE McCALL? 

06:12:51.193 --> 06:12:53.193
THERE WAS A CLEAR RECOLLECTION.

06:12:59.121 --> 06:13:00.136
&gt;&gt; SONDLAND GREETED THE 
PRESIDENT. 

06:13:00.137 --> 06:13:04.350
&gt;&gt; HOW? 
&gt;&gt;  HE SAID HELLO AND THE 

06:13:04.532 --> 06:13:07.807
PRESIDENT SAID ARE YOU IN 
UKRAINE? 

06:13:07.808 --> 06:13:10.896
&gt;&gt;  YOU THINK HE SAID YOU ARE IN
UKRAINE?  

06:13:10.897 --> 06:13:16.387
&gt;&gt; HE SAID  ARE YOU IN UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU HEAR PRESIDENT 

06:13:16.588 --> 06:13:20.596
TRUMP  SAY? 
&gt;&gt;  I DID NOT HEAR THAT 

06:13:20.765 --> 06:13:24.506
CONVERSATION. 
&gt;&gt;  YOU SAID THE CONVERSATION 

06:13:24.706 --> 06:13:27.675
WAS VERY LOUD AND HIS VOICE WAS 
RECOGNIZABLE

06:13:31.206 --> 06:13:33.367
WHEN THE CONVERSATION SHIFTED, I
COULD ONLY HEAR AMBASSADOR

06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:39.127
SONDLAND THE SIDE OF THE 
CONVERSATION. 

06:13:39.128 --> 06:13:44.414
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR, AS I TESTIFIED. THE
INITIAL PART OF THE CALL , HE 

06:13:44.613 --> 06:13:46.846
WINCED AND HELD THE PHONE AWAY 
FROM HIS EAR FOR THE INITIAL 

06:13:47.062 --> 06:13:51.059
PORTION AND THEN AT SOME POINT, 
HE STOPPED DOING THAT AND I 

06:13:51.228 --> 06:13:53.751
DON'T KNOW WHY OR IF HE TURNED 
THE VOLUME DOWN OR IF HE SPOKE 

06:13:54.503 --> 06:13:56.503
MORE QUIETLY

06:13:59.854 --> 06:14:02.087
OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANGED. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID CHANGE? THIS IS 

06:14:02.287 --> 06:14:04.119
IMPORTANT AND MEMORABLE. 
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.  

06:14:04.120 --> 06:14:06.120
&gt;&gt;  OKAY.

06:14:19.762 --> 06:14:21.762
HOW TO THE CONVERSATION END? 
&gt;&gt; I ONLY HEARD AMBASSADOR 

06:14:21.782 --> 06:14:26.263
SONDLAND'S SIDE OF THE 
CONVERSATION AND HE SAID  HE WAS

06:14:26.464 --> 06:14:29.035
GIVING THE PRESIDENT ADVICE ON 
HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION 

06:14:29.215 --> 06:14:32.148
AND HE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE 
RELEASED HIM ON YOUR WORD AND 

06:14:32.351 --> 06:14:37.364
YOU CAN TELL THEM YOU TRIED. 
&gt;&gt;  PRESIDENT TRUMP RECEIVED 

06:14:37.544 --> 06:14:42.051
WORD THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAD
AGREED TO THE INVESTIGATIONS 

06:14:45.552 --> 06:14:47.386
,  HE SAID GOOD AND WHAT ABOUT 
SWEDEN? 

06:14:47.387 --> 06:14:50.424
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt;  WHEN EXACTLY DID GORDON 

06:14:50.656 --> 06:14:57.338
SONDLAND ASK  PRESIDENT ZELENSKY
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION?  

06:14:57.339 --> 06:15:00.111
&gt;&gt;  WHEN DID GORDON SONDLAND ASK

06:15:04.649 --> 06:15:05.462
ZELENSKY ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATIONS? 

06:15:05.463 --> 06:15:09.528
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt;  IN WHICH MEANING DID HE 

06:15:09.730 --> 06:15:11.730
RAISE THE INVESTIGATIONS? 
&gt;&gt; 

06:15:19.880 --> 06:15:22.314
THE DAY BEFORE ON THE CALL THE 
NEXT DAY, GORDON SONDLAND OF THE

06:15:22.530 --> 06:15:24.963
ANSWER THAT WAS HE WOULD DO THE 
INVESTIGATION SO WHEN DID HE ASK

06:15:25.163 --> 06:15:26.997
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION? 
&gt;&gt; MY ASSUMPTION IS IN THE 

06:15:26.998 --> 06:15:29.232
CLOSED DOOR MEETING.  
&gt;&gt;  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 

06:15:29.432 --> 06:15:31.260
RECORD IS CLEAR THAT AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND TESTIFIED THAT THE 

06:15:31.261 --> 06:15:33.244
TOPIC OF  CONVERSATION DID NOT 
-- 

06:15:33.245 --> 06:15:37.147
&gt;&gt;  TAKE YOU, YOUR TIME IS 
EXPIRED. 

06:15:37.148 --> 06:15:39.583
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO THANK BOTH OF
OUR WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE 

06:15:39.784 --> 06:15:42.430
TODAY  AND I WOULD LIKE TO TURN 
OUR DISCUSSION TO THE CAMPAIGN 

06:15:42.633 --> 06:15:44.633
TO REMOVE CAREER DIPLOMAT 
AMBASSADOR

06:15:48.734 --> 06:15:50.752
YOVANOVITCH. BOTH OF YOU IN YOUR
VARIOUS CAPACITIES HAD TO WORK 

06:15:50.964 --> 06:15:55.635
WITH HER  AND BOTH OF YOU 
WITNESSED WHAT I WOULD CALL A 

06:15:55.836 --> 06:15:58.528
SMEAR CAMPAIGN. I WANTED TO KNOW
YOUR THOUGHTS, DR. HILL, WHAT 

06:15:58.699 --> 06:16:03.957
WAS YOUR VIEW OF AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH'S EXPERIENCE AND HER

06:16:04.157 --> 06:16:10.176
WORK IN THE UKRAINE  AND DO YOU 
CONSIDER TO BE A SMEAR CAMPAIGN?

06:16:10.860 --> 06:16:16.965
&gt;&gt; I HAD THE HIGHEST REGARD  FOR
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH BOTH IN 

06:16:17.165 --> 06:16:22.235
TERMS OF HER INTEGRITY  IN THE 
HIGH STANDARDS OF WORK THAT SHE 

06:16:22.449 --> 06:16:26.916
WAS CARRYING OUT AS AN INVESTOR 
AND THROUGHOUT HER WHOLE CAREER.

06:16:27.119 --> 06:16:32.190
I DO BELIEVE THERE WAS A SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN AND I WANT TO SAY FOR 

06:16:32.403 --> 06:16:34.639
THE RECORD THAT I THINK IT WAS 
UNNECESSARY. IF THERE IS A 

06:16:34.841 --> 06:16:37.674
DECISION TO HAVE A POLITICAL 
AMBASSADOR, THAT WOULD BE 

06:16:38.427 --> 06:16:40.427
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE

06:16:43.160 --> 06:16:45.596
IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT OF THE 
PRESIDENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT 

06:16:45.798 --> 06:16:50.064
BUT I DID NOT SEE WHY IT WAS 
NECESSARY TO HAVE SUCH THAT 

06:16:50.282 --> 06:16:55.150
EXTENT. 
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, DO YOU THANK YOU

06:16:55.351 --> 06:16:57.351
TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF AMBASSADOR

06:17:01.041 --> 06:17:03.072
YOVANOVITCH? 
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. SHE WAS  

06:17:03.472 --> 06:17:05.472
EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND 
RESPECTED

06:17:08.143 --> 06:17:09.774
BY UKRAINIANS AND ALSO WITH 
AMERICAN SENIOR OFFICIALS 

06:17:09.775 --> 06:17:13.632
INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE IN CONGRESS. SHE IS 

06:17:13.832 --> 06:17:15.832
EXTREMELY DEDICATED AND 
HARD-WORKING

06:17:18.501 --> 06:17:20.501
.  
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SEE IT AS A SMEAR 

06:17:20.534 --> 06:17:22.318
CAMPAIGN AS WELL? 
&gt;&gt; I DID.  

06:17:22.319 --> 06:17:25.005
&gt;&gt;  WHAT WAS THE EFFECT THAT HAD
ON MORALE OF OTHER PROFESSIONALS

06:17:25.248 --> 06:17:29.072
THAT YOU WORKED WITH?  
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A VERY CONFUSING TIME 

06:17:29.473 --> 06:17:32.642
AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE. THE 
PRESIDENT HAS A RIGHT TO

06:17:36.175 --> 06:17:38.824
REMOVE AND AMBASSADOR FOR ANY OR
NO REASON AT ALL BUT IT WAS NOT 

06:17:39.025 --> 06:17:42.475
CLEAR AS TO WHY THIS WAS 
HAPPENING OR WHY PEOPLE WERE NOT

06:17:42.676 --> 06:17:44.913
STANDING UP FOR HER. 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO TURN DR. HILL

06:17:45.324 --> 06:17:49.577
TO YOUR BOSS. YOUR BOSS WAS 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, RIGHT? 

06:17:49.578 --> 06:17:53.846
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  DID YOUR BOSS, AMBASSADOR 

06:17:54.059 --> 06:17:58.530
BOLTON TELL YOU THAT GIULIANI 
WAS A HAND GRENADE? 

06:17:58.531 --> 06:18:02.384
&gt;&gt; HE DID.  
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK HE MEANT BY

06:18:02.583 --> 06:18:05.017
HIS CHARACTERIZATION OF  
GIULIANI? 

06:18:05.018 --> 06:18:07.687
&gt;&gt; WHAT HE MEANT WAS PRETTY 
CLEAR TO ME  IN THE CONTEXT OF 

06:18:08.430 --> 06:18:12.138
ALL THE STATEMENTS THAT GIULIANI
WAS MAKING PUBLICLY ABOUT THE 

06:18:12.340 --> 06:18:16.037
INVESTIGATIONS THAT HE WAS 
PROMOTING IN THE STORYLINE AND 

06:18:16.744 --> 06:18:18.744
THE NARRATIVE

06:18:22.293 --> 06:18:24.109
THAT WOULD BACKFIRE AND I THINK 
IT HAD BACKFIRED. 

06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:26.110
&gt;&gt; WAS A NARRATIVE ALSO 
INCLUSIVE  ABOUT AMBASSADOR

06:18:35.495 --> 06:18:36.711
YOVANOVITCH? 
&gt;&gt; THEY MADE THAT COMMENT, 

06:18:36.712 --> 06:18:38.746
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT WAS IN THE 
CONTEXT OF MY DISCUSSIONS WITH 

06:18:38.946 --> 06:18:40.978
HIM ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO 
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH.  

06:18:40.979 --> 06:18:43.011
&gt;&gt; I WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY 
YOUR TESTIMONY, DR. HILL ABOUT 

06:18:43.213 --> 06:18:48.083
RECEIVING  HATEFUL CALLS AND 
BEING ACCUSED OF BEING A SAURUS 

06:18:48.485 --> 06:18:50.862
MOLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. ARE YOU
A

06:18:55.083 --> 06:19:03.521
NEVER TRUMPER OR HAVE YOU 
REMAINED LOYAL?  

06:19:03.522 --> 06:19:10.838
&gt;&gt; I'M REALLY NOT SURE  WHAT THE
TERM COLONEL VINDMAN IS BUT  I 

06:19:11.040 --> 06:19:13.040
CHOSE TO COME IN TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION. I COULD HAVE 

06:19:13.072 --> 06:19:15.072
EASILY SAID NO

06:19:22.813 --> 06:19:25.061
WHEN I WAS APPROACHED. 
&gt;&gt; YES BUT YOU DID NOT SIGN UP 

06:19:25.263 --> 06:19:26.678
TO HAVE HATEFUL CALLS AND THE 
LIKE. 

06:19:26.679 --> 06:19:28.712
&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY, WHERE WE ARE 
TODAY, THAT IS COMING WITH THE 

06:19:28.914 --> 06:19:30.947
TERRITORY AND IT IS CONTINUING. 
WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO 

06:19:31.701 --> 06:19:33.701
BLOCK TWITTER

06:19:38.658 --> 06:19:41.307
AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS OVER
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. AS I 

06:19:41.507 --> 06:19:43.507
SAID IN MY DEPOSITION, THIS 
COULD HAPPEN TO ANY SINGLE 

06:19:43.541 --> 06:19:45.775
PERSON IN THIS ROOM THE MEMBERS 
OF THE PRESS OR CONGRESS AND 

06:19:45.976 --> 06:19:48.416
STAFF. I THINK WE HAVE TO FIND 
WAYS OF COMBATING THIS AND HE 

06:19:48.655 --> 06:19:50.655
GETS BACK SO LATE TO THE THINGS 
THAT OUR ADVERSARIES CAN 

06:19:50.858 --> 06:19:52.074
EXPLOIT. 
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. THIS SHOULD NOT 

06:19:52.075 --> 06:19:55.526
BECOME A NEW  NORMAL. WOULD YOU 
AGREE? 

06:19:55.527 --> 06:19:57.561
&gt;&gt; IT SHOULD NOT. 
&gt;&gt; I ALSO THINK THIS KIND OF 

06:19:57.772 --> 06:20:00.751
BEHAVIOR , INSTEAD OF KEEPING 
YOU DOWN WOULD MAKE YOU 

06:20:00.919 --> 06:20:02.919
UNDETERRED.

06:20:06.905 --> 06:20:09.151
ARE YOU MORE DETERMINED TO 
CONTINUE TO DO YOUR WORK AND TO 

06:20:09.337 --> 06:20:11.381
DO PROFESSIONALLY? 
&gt;&gt; I AM AND I THINK ALL OF MY 

06:20:11.573 --> 06:20:14.009
COLLEAGUES ARE AS WELL  BECAUSE 
WE CAN'T LET THIS STAND AND I'LL

06:20:14.207 --> 06:20:16.207
PICK ANYONE HERE WANTS TO LET 
THIS STAND.

06:20:20.107 --> 06:20:22.126
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO 
COME UNDER PERSONAL ATTACK. 

06:20:22.127 --> 06:20:24.576
&gt;&gt; I AM PERSONALLY THINK THIS 
HAS BECOME THE NEW NORM AND WE 

06:20:24.777 --> 06:20:28.631
ARE LED  ON THE TOP OF THE FOOD 
TRAINED BY HER PRESENT WHICH IS 

06:20:28.831 --> 06:20:31.335
UNFORTUNATE. I'M DISHEARTENED BY
HIS TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND I 

06:20:31.505 --> 06:20:34.116
THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS 
THERE IS A LONG LINE OF STRONG 

06:20:34.878 --> 06:20:36.878
TALENTED WOMEN

06:20:41.834 --> 06:20:43.834
WHO HAVE BEEN SMEARED AND 
VICTIMIZED BY THIS PRESIDENT AND

06:20:43.868 --> 06:20:46.303
WE CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO IGNORE 
IT OR DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

06:20:46.503 --> 06:20:48.538
FRANKLY I THINK, WHETHER YOU 
VOTED FOR HIM OR SUPPORTED HIM 

06:20:49.299 --> 06:20:54.223
OR NOT THAT DOING SO WAS WRONG. 
YOU CAN SIMPLY REMOVE SOMEONE. 

06:20:54.424 --> 06:20:57.675
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMEAR THEM. 
THANK YOU AND I YIELD BACK MY 

06:20:57.887 --> 06:20:59.887
TIME. 
&gt;&gt; MR. TURNER, I WANT TO  ECHO 

06:21:00.267 --> 06:21:02.267
THAT SENTIMENT.

06:21:07.831 --> 06:21:11.696
THIS HAS BEEN VIOLENT HATEFUL 
AND FOR THOSE YOU THAT ARE 

06:21:11.897 --> 06:21:13.897
KEEPING SCORE AT HOME, THE 
EFFORTS ACCUSER PRESIDENT OF 

06:21:13.934 --> 06:21:17.379
COERCION AND EXTORTION OR 
BRIBERY WITH THESE WITNESSES AS 

06:21:17.793 --> 06:21:21.648
WE NOW COME TO THE CLOSING 
SESSION OF THIS, BASICALLY 

06:21:21.848 --> 06:21:23.848
BREAKDOWN AS FOLLOWS. WE HAVE

06:21:27.544 --> 06:21:29.364
CANTED AMBASSADOR TAYLOR THAT 
SPOKE OF HEARSAY OF THESE 

06:21:29.365 --> 06:21:34.248
MATTERS THAT THEY SAID THEY HAD 
HEARD THAT WERE ALL STATEMENTS 

06:21:34.447 --> 06:21:36.480
THAT THEY HAD HEARD FROM OTHERS 
THAT HAVE ALSO TESTIFIED SO 

06:21:36.681 --> 06:21:41.347
THERE IS THE ONE THAT IS MISSING
IN TAYLOR BASICALLY SAID THEY 

06:21:41.547 --> 06:21:44.196
HEARD FROM IT'S ALL IN AND CAN 
AS WELL EMERSON SAID HE HEARD IT

06:21:44.397 --> 06:21:47.847
FROM SOLOMON AND SONDLAND THAT 
HE HEARD IT FROM NO ONE ON THE 

06:21:48.611 --> 06:21:50.611
PLANET .

06:21:54.549 --> 06:21:56.549
THEY HAVE DIRECT TESTIMONY WITH 
THE PHONE CALLED THE PRESIDENT 

06:21:56.583 --> 06:22:01.049
OF THE UNITED STATES AND BEYOND 
THAT,  THEY ONLY HAD CONTACT 

06:22:01.262 --> 06:22:06.737
WITH SONDLAND AND HE INDICATED 
HE HAD  CONTACT WITH NO ONE ON 

06:22:06.952 --> 06:22:11.619
THE PLANET. VOLKER TESTIFIED 
THAT HE DID HAVE DIRECT CONTACT 

06:22:11.820 --> 06:22:13.820
BOTH WITH UKRAINIANS AND THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE NIGHT SATAN 

06:22:13.853 --> 06:22:15.853
INDICATED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES DID NOT 

06:22:15.888 --> 06:22:18.122
CONDITION EITHER A PHONE CALL OR
MEETING OR AID UPON UKRAINE ON 

06:22:18.323 --> 06:22:21.592
THE TAKING OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
AND TESTIFIED THAT THE 

06:22:21.775 --> 06:22:23.775
UKRAINIANS DID NOT BELIEVE IT 
EITHER.

06:22:27.862 --> 06:22:29.862
WE ALSO HAVE DIRECT STATEMENTS 
WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT 

06:22:29.894 --> 06:22:31.894
THEY DID NOT FEEL ANY PRESSURE 
TO UNDERTAKE INVESTIGATIONS AND 

06:22:31.937 --> 06:22:35.994
WE ALSO HAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT 
WE ARE ALL VERY MUCH AWARE WHICH

06:22:36.193 --> 06:22:38.026
THEY DID NOT UNDERTAKE ANY 
INVESTIGATIONS. WE ALSO HAVE 

06:22:38.027 --> 06:22:40.027
YOVANOVITCH AND DR. HILL 

06:22:43.096 --> 06:22:45.531
.  YOVANOVITCH LEFT THE FOR THE 
TIME PERIOD AND DR. HILL, WE 

06:22:45.745 --> 06:22:48.782
APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US 
TODAY  AND MR. HOLMES. DR. HILL,

06:22:48.999 --> 06:22:50.999
YOU HAVE PROVIDED ME PROBABLY 
THE GREATEST PIECE OF EVIDENCE 

06:22:51.016 --> 06:22:55.284
THAT IS BEFORE US TO ILLUSTRATE 
THE PROBLEM WITH HEARSAY. YOU 

06:22:55.486 --> 06:22:59.756
SAID BASED ON QUESTIONS AND 
STATEMENTS, "I HAVE HEARD SOME 

06:22:59.956 --> 06:23:01.956
OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE

06:23:05.241 --> 06:23:07.075
APPEAR THAT RUSSIA AND THE 
SECURITY SERVICES DID NOT 

06:23:07.076 --> 06:23:11.131
CONDUCT A CAMPAIGN AGAINST OUR 
COUNTRY." PERHAPS SOMEHOW IT WAS

06:23:11.331 --> 06:23:15.425
UKRAINE. THIS WAS HELD WITH THE 
ACTIVE MEASURES THAT WAS VOTED 

06:23:15.598 --> 06:23:20.680
ON BY ALL OF US AND BEGINS WITH 
THE SENTENCE. IN 2015, RUSSIA 

06:23:20.879 --> 06:23:24.130
BEGAN HAVING A COVERT CAMPAIGN 
AIMED AT THE PRESENT ELECTION 

06:23:24.329 --> 06:23:26.329
AND EVERYONE OF US

06:23:31.247 --> 06:23:33.470
, WITH SMALL EFFORT ON YOUR 
PART, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT 

06:23:33.684 --> 06:23:35.684
WHAT YOU JUST SAID WAS NOT TRUE.

06:23:39.168 --> 06:23:41.602
WHAT YOU HAD HEARD BUT YOU FELT 
THE NEED TO PUT IN YOUR 

06:23:41.804 --> 06:23:44.262
EIGHT-PAGE STATEMENT BEFORE YOU 
WENT ON TO TELL US A BUNCH OF 

06:23:44.432 --> 06:23:46.432
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU HEARD 
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW

06:23:46.472 --> 06:23:49.722
CONVINCED YOU WERE. ONE OF WHICH
WAS THAT YOU SAID AMBASSADOR 

06:23:49.923 --> 06:23:51.959
SONDLAND MET WITH GIULIANI AND 
ACTUALLY HE TESTIFIED  THAT HE 

06:23:52.723 --> 06:23:54.723
HAD NOT

06:23:57.441 --> 06:23:59.684
MET WITH HIM. HE BRIEFLY MET 
WITH HIM IN HIS LIFETIME BY 

06:23:59.885 --> 06:24:02.121
SHAKING HIS HAND BUT THIS IS THE
PROBLEM WITH THE MATTER HOW 

06:24:02.321 --> 06:24:06.990
CONVINCED WE ARE AND HOW MUCH WE
BELIEVE WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE 

06:24:07.190 --> 06:24:11.059
HAVE HEARD IS TRUE, IT IS STILL 
JUST ONLY WHAT WE HAVE HEARD BUT

06:24:11.260 --> 06:24:14.912
SO FAR IN THIS HEARING IN THE 
SERIES OF HEARINGS, THE ONLY 

06:24:15.114 --> 06:24:19.995
THING THAT WE HAVE IS VOLKER 
SAYING I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT 

06:24:20.397 --> 06:24:23.648
AND SPOKE TO THE UKRAINIANS AND 
NEITHER OF WHICH BELIEVE AID WAS

06:24:23.850 --> 06:24:27.716
CONDITIONED AND NEITHER WHICH 
BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

06:24:28.477 --> 06:24:32.387
REQUIRING IT AND AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND SAID NO ONE ON THE  

06:24:32.587 --> 06:24:36.441
PLANET TOLD HIM THAT WAS THE 
CASE. THAT IS THE SOLE EVIDENCE 

06:24:36.655 --> 06:24:38.997
ON THE ONE THING THAT IS 
INTERESTING IS AMBASSADOR 

06:24:39.167 --> 06:24:43.957
SONDLAND SAID  THE MEETING WAS 
CONDITIONED UPON INVITATION AND 

06:24:44.370 --> 06:24:48.636
I THINK AMBASSADOR VOLKER WHO 
HAS GREAT INTEGRITY SAID THAT 

06:24:48.882 --> 06:24:52.845
WAS NOT THE CASE AND EVEN IF 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND IS CORRECT 

06:24:58.993 --> 06:25:01.228
AND THAT IS HEARSAY AND YOU 
DON'T KNOW, HE DID NOT TESTIFY 

06:25:01.630 --> 06:25:04.010
TO THAT. LET'S SAY SOMEONE 
BESIDES THE PRESIDENT TOLD HIM 

06:25:04.186 --> 06:25:08.746
THAT, YOU GUYS WANT TO BE THE 
LAUGHING STOCK OF HISTORY TO 

06:25:08.950 --> 06:25:10.950
IMPEACH A PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE DIDN'T 

06:25:10.979 --> 06:25:15.581
TAKE A MEETING? NOW,

06:25:21.286 --> 06:25:23.286
MR. HOLMES

06:25:27.224 --> 06:25:28.842
-- 
&gt;&gt; IS THERE A QUESTION FOR DR. 

06:25:28.843 --> 06:25:30.478
HILL? 
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES, IN YOUR TESTIMONY

06:25:30.479 --> 06:25:33.471
YOU SAID THAT SONDLAND  SAID

06:25:37.383 --> 06:25:39.383
HE LOVES YOU AND WILL DO 
ANYTHING YOU WANT. THAT 

06:25:39.412 --> 06:25:41.444
INFORMATION HAD NOTHING TO DO 
WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY 

06:25:41.645 --> 06:25:44.496
OF THESE HEARINGS. IT WAS 
ANECDOTAL IN YOUR STATEMENTS 

06:25:44.897 --> 06:25:47.690
THAT YOUR INTERESTS ARE 
PROTECTING UKRAINE ARE VERY 

06:25:47.864 --> 06:25:51.021
DUBIOUS WHEN YOU VARIOUS 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY BY MAKING 

06:25:51.198 --> 06:25:53.198
THOSE STATEMENTS 

06:25:56.269 --> 06:25:58.505
.  WHO CARES THAT AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND OF THAT AND YOU DIDN'T 

06:25:58.704 --> 06:26:04.346
EMBARRASS AMBASSADOR  SONDLAND. 
YOU EMBARRASSED ZELENSKY. 

06:26:13.331 --> 06:26:15.324
&gt;&gt; YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. MR. 
CARSON, YOUR RECOGNIZE. 

06:26:15.325 --> 06:26:17.398
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR 
SERVICE. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK 

06:26:17.599 --> 06:26:20.447
MORE IN DEPTH  ABOUT THE CHIEF 
OF STAFF AND THE ROLE UNDER THE 

06:26:20.648 --> 06:26:24.915
INVESTIGATION. YOU TESTIFIED 
THAT MR. MULVANEY AND SONDLAND 

06:26:25.116 --> 06:26:28.970
WERE INVOLVED WITH A LETTER SENT
TO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT  ON MAY 

06:26:29.184 --> 06:26:31.565
20 NOT CONGRATULATING HIM WITH 
HIS INAUGURATION. DO YOU RECALL 

06:26:31.739 --> 06:26:36.488
THAT? 
&gt;&gt; I DID, YES.  

06:26:36.489 --> 06:26:38.659
&gt;&gt; TOWARDS THE END OF THAT 
LETTER, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

06:26:45.841 --> 06:26:48.275
CLOSED WITH "I WOULD LIKE TO 
INVITE YOU TO MEET ME AT THE 

06:26:48.477 --> 06:26:50.712
WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON D.C. 
AS SOON AS WE CAN FIND A 

06:26:50.914 --> 06:26:52.914
MUTUALLY CONVENIENT TIME." DR. 
HILL, WAS THIS LETTER DRAFTED TO

06:26:52.946 --> 06:26:55.782
THE NORMAL PROCEDURES AT THE NFC
THAT THEY USE TO SEND LETTERS? 

06:26:56.531 --> 06:27:00.260
&gt;&gt;  THE FIRST PART OF IT WAS 
EXCEPT THE LAST PARAGRAPH. 

06:27:00.261 --> 06:27:02.261
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO TESTIFIED 

06:27:05.332 --> 06:27:07.332
THAT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND TOLD 
YOU THAT HE HAD DICTATED THAT 

06:27:07.363 --> 06:27:09.363
LINE TO THE PRESIDENT  AND THAT

06:27:12.651 --> 06:27:14.684
HE SAID TAD THAT TO THE LETTER. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 

06:27:14.685 --> 06:27:16.685
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:27:20.572 --> 06:27:22.604
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU WERE NERVOUS 
ABOUT THAT. WHY WERE YOU 

06:27:22.815 --> 06:27:24.636
NERVOUS, DR. HILL? 
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE AT THIS JUNCTURE IT 

06:27:24.637 --> 06:27:26.871
HAD BECOME QUITE APPARENT  THAT 
THE PRESIDENT BUT WAS VERY KEEN 

06:27:27.079 --> 06:27:32.557
ON HAVING A MEETING WITH MR. 
ZELENSKY AS FOR ALL THE REASONS 

06:27:32.759 --> 06:27:38.857
THAT WE HAVE LAID OUT AND  YOU 
RAISE THE EXPECTATIONS OF AN 

06:27:39.056 --> 06:27:43.327
INVITATION COMING SHORTLY. 
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL, YOU ALSO TESTIFIED 

06:27:43.527 --> 06:27:47.379
THAT  AMBASSADOR SONDLAND WAS  
FREQUENTLY MEETING WITH 

06:27:47.581 --> 06:27:50.987
MULVANEY. THE CAMPAIGN 
ULTIMATELY LED TO AMBASSADOR

06:27:54.898 --> 06:27:56.898
YOVANOVITCH BEING RECALLED FROM 
HER POST AND YOU ALSO TESTIFIED 

06:27:57.132 --> 06:28:03.219
THAT HER REMOVAL WAS THE SPIRIT 
OF IN A TURNING POINT FOR YOU. 

06:28:03.435 --> 06:28:07.096
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, AS WE HAVE ALL MADE 

06:28:07.290 --> 06:28:11.755
CLEAR, AMBASSADOR  YOVANOVITCH, 
YOU SAW  FOR YOURSELF THAT SHE 

06:28:11.957 --> 06:28:15.008
IS A PERSON OF GREAT INTEGRITY 
AND ONE OF OUR FINEST FOREIGN 

06:28:15.772 --> 06:28:17.772
SERVICE OFFICERS

06:28:20.292 --> 06:28:22.728
AND THIS HAD BEEN A DECISION TO 
REMOVE HER AND REPLACE HER WITH 

06:28:22.927 --> 06:28:28.212
A POLITICAL APPOINTEE AND AGAIN 
THAT IS PERFECTLY WITHIN THE 

06:28:28.412 --> 06:28:30.646
RIGHTS OF THE PRESIDENT AND 
SOMETIMES IT IS HIGHLY ADVISABLE

06:28:30.846 --> 06:28:33.498
TO EMPHASIZE TWO CARTRIDGES 
EXACTLY HOW CLOSE THE 

06:28:33.697 --> 06:28:36.544
RELATIONSHIP IS LIKELY TO BE TO 
HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS CLOSE TO 

06:28:37.308 --> 06:28:39.308
THE PRESIDENT

06:28:41.011 --> 06:28:42.832
IF IT IS AN IMPORTANT 
RELATIONSHIP BUT WHAT WAS 

06:28:42.833 --> 06:28:44.833
DISCOURAGING WAS ALL THE 
ACCUSATIONS THAT WERE BEING 

06:28:44.983 --> 06:28:48.314
FIRED AT AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH 
LEADING HER TO BE  TREATED 

06:28:48.528 --> 06:28:53.597
INCLUDE MY MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S FAMILY AND WE ALSO 

06:28:53.811 --> 06:28:58.630
BELIEVE THAT MR. GIULIANI AND 
OTHERS INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT 

06:28:58.811 --> 06:29:03.152
WERE RECENTLY INDICTED WITH THE 
AMERICAN GENTLEMEN HAD FOR SOME 

06:29:03.915 --> 06:29:07.819
REASON DECIDED THAT AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH  WAS SOME KIND OF 

06:29:08.078 --> 06:29:12.288
PERSONAL PROBLEM FOR THEM AND 
THEY HAD DECIDED TO ENGAGE IN 

06:29:12.490 --> 06:29:17.160
THE KIND OF THINGS WE HAVE BEEN 
DISCUSSING ABOUT AND SHE WAS AN 

06:29:17.372 --> 06:29:22.439
EASY TARGET BUT I WAS VERY SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND 

06:29:22.641 --> 06:29:24.887
I THINK THIS JUST ILLUSTRATES 
THE POINT IN THE PROBLEM THAT WE

06:29:25.090 --> 06:29:30.771
ARE DEALING WITH HERE TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS ALSO STRUCK BY YOUR 

06:29:30.972 --> 06:29:32.804
TESTIMONY THAT YOU ARE THE 
TARGET OF FALSE ACCUSATIONS 

06:29:32.805 --> 06:29:35.038
DURING YOUR TIME WITH THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. YOU TESTIFIED 

06:29:35.239 --> 06:29:37.877
ABOUT RECEIVING HATEFUL CALLS 
AND BEING ACCUSED OF BEING A 

06:29:38.091 --> 06:29:40.091
MOLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

06:29:43.364 --> 06:29:45.364
YOU TESTIFIED ABOUT DEATH 
THREATS AND CALLS I YOUR HOME. 

06:29:45.397 --> 06:29:49.263
IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  

06:29:49.264 --> 06:29:51.826
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GO 
THROUGH ALL THIS AND YOU DON'T 

06:29:52.010 --> 06:29:54.067
STRIKE ME AS A WOMAN THAT IS 
EASILY DETERRED 

06:29:57.986 --> 06:30:00.218
.  YOU ARE NOT EASILY DETERRED, 
ARE YOU DR. HILL? 

06:30:00.219 --> 06:30:02.253
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT, NO. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. I

06:30:02.454 --> 06:30:05.104
YIELD MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt;  MY CAUTION TO BOTH OF YOU 

06:30:05.303 --> 06:30:07.134
THAT REPRESENTATIONS WITH PRIOR 
WITNESSES WHAT THEY SAID AND 

06:30:07.135 --> 06:30:12.819
WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MAY NOT BE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS. THIS 

06:30:13.020 --> 06:30:14.853
WAS FROM AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S 
OPENING STATEMENT AND AFTER THE 

06:30:14.854 --> 06:30:17.008
MEETING , I ALSO MET WITH THE 
SENIOR AIDE

06:30:20.742 --> 06:30:22.776
AND I DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFICS
OF THE CONVERSATION BUT I 

06:30:22.976 --> 06:30:27.163
BELIEVE THE ISSUE WAS PROBABLY 
APART OF THAT AGENDA OR MEETING.

06:30:34.552 --> 06:30:36.785
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. 

06:30:36.986 --> 06:30:40.439
IN 1988,  I VOLUNTEERED TO JOIN 
THE ARMY RESERVE BECAUSE I SAW 

06:30:40.651 --> 06:30:45.724
OUR COUNTRY UNDER ATTACK. BILL 
CLINTON WAS THE PRESIDENT AND I 

06:30:45.924 --> 06:30:50.393
DID NOT VOTE FOR BILL CLINTON 
BUT HE WAS MY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF

06:30:50.609 --> 06:30:53.845
AND IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT I 
DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. I WAS 

06:30:54.060 --> 06:30:59.332
GRATEFUL TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY 
THAT GETS TO LEGITIMATELY ELECT 

06:30:59.532 --> 06:31:02.505
OUR LEADERS AND I HAVE BEEN TO 
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T GET TO

06:31:03.195 --> 06:31:06.247
AND IT IS NOT PRETTY AND I 
RESPECT OUR SYSTEM AND EXCEPT 

06:31:06.648 --> 06:31:11.733
THE RESULTS THAT ARE DETERMINED 
BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I 

06:31:11.932 --> 06:31:14.770
DEPLOYED TO IRAQ IN 2005 IN 2006
AS AN ARMY SURGEON WITH SOLDIERS

06:31:14.969 --> 06:31:17.204
FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WE WERE 

06:31:17.971 --> 06:31:23.708
ALL AMERICANS. THAT WAS FIRST 
AND FOREMOST. WE TREATED OUR 

06:31:23.911 --> 06:31:25.943
TROOPS AND THE ENEMY WINNING 
OVER THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF 

06:31:26.143 --> 06:31:28.143
PEOPLE THAT NEVER KNEW US 
BECAUSE OF THEIR DICTATOR, 

06:31:28.538 --> 06:31:33.392
SADDAM HUSSEIN. WE TOLD HIM WE 
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR 

06:31:33.565 --> 06:31:37.862
PROBLEMS AND THAT WAS THE 
NARRATIVE. SPEAKING OF 

06:31:38.077 --> 06:31:40.077
NARRATIVES,

06:31:44.027 --> 06:31:46.095
DR. HILL, I'M SORRY, YOU SAID 
BASED ON STATEMENTS THAT SOME 

06:31:46.273 --> 06:31:48.284
BELIEVE RUSSIA DID NOT CONDUCT A
CAMPAIGN AGAINST OUR COUNTRY AND

06:31:48.498 --> 06:31:51.133
THAT IS FALSE. THAT IS THE 
NARRATIVE AND THAT IS WHERE YOU 

06:31:51.334 --> 06:31:55.202
HAVE HEARD IT. WE DID A WHOLE 
REPORT ON IT AND WE AGREE THAT 

06:31:55.402 --> 06:31:59.869
RUSSIA HAS DONE THIS SINCE THE 
SOVIET UNION AND THEY HAVE 

06:32:00.072 --> 06:32:02.707
ACTUALLY GOTTEN BETTER AT IT. 
THAT IS A PROBLEM. AT THE SAME 

06:32:02.908 --> 06:32:05.269
TIME, CERTAIN UKRAINIANS DID 
WORK AGAINST CANDIDATE TRUMP.

06:32:10.023 --> 06:32:12.670
SOME WITH THE DNC AND IF THAT IS
DEBUNKED, WHY IS IT THAT MR. 

06:32:12.870 --> 06:32:18.758
SCHIFF IS DENIED WITH TRENTON TO
TESTIFY AND COME FORWARD AND 

06:32:19.521 --> 06:32:23.023
DEBUNK IT? I ASKED IF IT WAS 
GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY IN THE DNC 

06:32:23.223 --> 06:32:26.072
AND THE CAMPAIGN TO PAY 
CHRISTOPHER STILL TO DIG UP TAKE

06:32:26.272 --> 06:32:29.270
DIRT WITH OTHER SERVICES AND 
RESOURCES ON THEIR POLITICAL 

06:32:29.442 --> 06:32:34.606
RIVAL? WAS A GOOD FOR AMERICA TO
CLAIM HAVING EVIDENCE OF THE 

06:32:34.810 --> 06:32:38.046
PRESIDENT COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA 
WHEN HE DID NOT AND COSTING THE 

06:32:38.798 --> 06:32:42.315
TAXPAYERS MILLIONS? BEING 
DEBUNKED BY SPECIAL COUNSEL? I 

06:32:42.516 --> 06:32:44.516
WOULD SAY THE FALSE NARRATIVE 
GOT CAUGHT.

06:32:48.217 --> 06:32:50.235
WAS IT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY AND 
FOR AMERICANS AND FOREIGNERS 

06:32:50.451 --> 06:32:53.287
ALIKE TO ATTEMPT TO ENTRAP 
MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 

06:32:53.489 --> 06:32:56.657
CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN? I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE

06:32:57.007 --> 06:33:02.173
THROUGH ALL THIS THAT SOME IN 
POWER DO THINK IT IS GOOD AND 

06:33:02.412 --> 06:33:05.678
OKAY AND NOW WE ARE HERE WITH 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND ARE 

06:33:05.880 --> 06:33:09.488
RIGHT THAT CERTAINLY CONGRESS 
HAS AN EVEN WITH VERY PARTISAN 

06:33:09.659 --> 06:33:15.229
RULES BUT I AM CURIOUS. THIS 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WAS 

06:33:15.429 --> 06:33:17.261
ANNOUNCED BEFORE THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT WAS EVEN

06:33:17.262 --> 06:33:21.677
ANNOUNCED AND I'M CURIOUS WHY 
THE LAWYER FOR THE WHISTLEBLOWER

06:33:21.861 --> 06:33:27.819
ANNOUNCED THAT TO TO IMPEACH THE
PRESIDENT THAT HE AROUNDS THAT 

06:33:28.020 --> 06:33:32.796
RIGHT AFTER TRUMP WON. I KNOW IT
HURTS AFTER LOSING AN ELECTION 

06:33:32.973 --> 06:33:34.973
ESPECIALLY AS AMERICANS

06:33:37.980 --> 06:33:40.612
BUT WE USUALLY GET OVER IT AND I
WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD HURT EVEN

06:33:40.825 --> 06:33:43.461
MORE IF YOU WERE PROMISED A 
POSITION IN THE NEXT 

06:33:43.671 --> 06:33:46.206
ADMINISTRATION AND LOST. YOUR 
HOPES AND YOUR DREAMS

06:33:50.366 --> 06:33:53.003
ARE DASHED. I HAVE SEEN HATRED 
FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND 

06:33:53.203 --> 06:33:57.888
SPECIFICALLY ON JUNE 14, 2017 AT
A BALLFIELD IN VIRGINIA AND I 

06:33:58.088 --> 06:34:04.589
SEEM HATRED IN WAR AND I KNOW 
THAT HATRED BLINDS PEOPLE. I'VE 

06:34:04.790 --> 06:34:11.088
BEEN IN WAR AND I'VE STUDIED WAR
AND COUPS CREATE DIVISION. IT IS

06:34:11.288 --> 06:34:15.154
TIME FOR THIS PHASE OF THE 
PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED AND 

06:34:15.399 --> 06:34:20.349
PROCLAIMED DEMOCRAT Q TO AND. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE

06:34:24.091 --> 06:34:26.111
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND
I YIELD BACK. 

06:34:26.112 --> 06:34:29.976
&gt;&gt; CUT I ACTUALLY SAY SOMETHING?
&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING TO ASK IF YOU 

06:34:30.177 --> 06:34:32.177
WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. 

06:34:36.884 --> 06:34:41.755
DR. HILL, YOU MAY RESPOND. 
&gt;&gt;  I THINK WHAT IS IT WAS 

06:34:41.958 --> 06:34:44.601
REALLY POWERFUL ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF OVERCOMING HATRED 

06:34:45.558 --> 06:34:50.009
AND CERTAINLY PARTISAN IN 
DIVISION. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT

06:34:52.522 --> 06:34:55.445
CONGRESSMAN TURNER AND MAC OS 
HAVE BOTH LEFT AS WELL BECAUSE I

06:34:55.618 --> 06:35:02.073
THINK ALL OF US THAT CAME HERE 
UNDER LEGAL OBLIGATION, WE CAME 

06:35:02.272 --> 06:35:04.272
AS FACT WITNESSES.

06:35:07.961 --> 06:35:09.995
WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO 
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD HEARD, IT 

06:35:10.194 --> 06:35:12.429
WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
DEPOSITION THAT I GAVE BECAUSE I

06:35:12.629 --> 06:35:18.138
WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT HOW SOME 
OF THE QUESTIONS AND THE TURN IT

06:35:18.314 --> 06:35:21.111
WAS TAKING. I UNDERSTAND THE 
POINT IS BEING MADE ABOUT 

06:35:21.285 --> 06:35:27.262
INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE ARTICLES 
TAKING DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN 

06:35:28.026 --> 06:35:31.730
OUR ELECTIONS. I DON'T BELIEVE 
THERE SHOULD BE ANY INTERFERENCE

06:35:31.929 --> 06:35:36.602
OF ANY KIND AND I THINK IT WAS 
UNFAIR FOR PEOPLE'S ALREADY CALL

06:35:37.362 --> 06:35:39.362
THE ELECTION

06:35:43.305 --> 06:35:45.537
AND TO MAKE ATTACKS ON CANDIDATE
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW 

06:35:45.738 --> 06:35:49.190
THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE CLOUD OVER 
THIS PRESIDENCY AND OVER OUR 

06:35:49.392 --> 06:35:53.799
WHOLE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THAT IS
WHY AS A NONPARTISAN PERSON AND 

06:35:53.975 --> 06:36:01.587
EXERT ON RUSSIA  AND ON VLADIMIR
PUTIN, I WANTED TO COME IN TO 

06:36:01.789 --> 06:36:05.441
SERVE THE COUNTRY TO SEE IF I 
COULD HELP. I HEARD PRESIDENT 

06:36:05.655 --> 06:36:07.888
TRUMP SAY THAT HE WANTED TO 
IMPROVE THE RELATIONS IN RUSSIA 

06:36:08.089 --> 06:36:12.307
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO. WE 
CAN'T BE IN THIS UNENDING 

06:36:12.482 --> 06:36:15.943
CONFRONTATION. WE HAVE TO FIND A
WAY TO STABILIZE OUR 

06:36:16.120 --> 06:36:23.315
RELATIONSHIP. AS ALWAYS TO STOP 
THEM TO DO WHAT THEY DID IN 2016

06:36:24.078 --> 06:36:30.582
FOR 2020. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT 
YOU HAVE PUT ACROSS VERY 

06:36:30.755 --> 06:36:35.105
ELOQUENTLY AND THE OTHER IS 
RELATED TO THIS INQUIRY WHERE WE

06:36:35.340 --> 06:36:37.743
ARE HERE TO PROVIDE WHAT WE KNOW
AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD. I 

06:36:38.504 --> 06:36:41.115
UNDERSTAND THAT FOR MANY 
MEMBERS, AND THIS MAY BE HEARSAY

06:36:42.613 --> 06:36:47.240
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AMBASSADOR
SONDLAND HAS HAD A LOT OF THINGS

06:36:48.712 --> 06:36:51.548
AND I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT HE TOLD
ME AND WHAT OTHERS TOLD ME. A 

06:36:51.763 --> 06:36:55.332
LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID 
THINGS TO ME AS WELL AND ALSO TO

06:36:58.050 --> 06:37:00.697
MR. HOLMES AND WE ARE HERE TO 
RELATE TO WHAT WE HEARD AND WHAT

06:37:00.898 --> 06:37:05.769
WE SAW AND WHAT WE DID AND TO BE
OF SOME HELP TO ALL OF YOU IN 

06:37:06.016 --> 06:37:09.223
MAKING A MOMENTOUS DECISION 
HERE. WE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE WHO 

06:37:09.436 --> 06:37:16.376
MAKE THAT DECISION ONE WHAT YOU 
SAID HERE. IT WAS VERY ELOQUENT 

06:37:16.544 --> 06:37:18.544
AND VERY MOVING ABOUT YOUR 
SERVICE

06:37:22.227 --> 06:37:24.260
AND TRYING TO BRING IT ALL 
TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. WE NEED 

06:37:24.462 --> 06:37:26.895
TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN IN 2020 SO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN MAKE A 

06:37:27.094 --> 06:37:30.963
CHOICE ABOUT THE FUTURE AND TO 
MAKE THEIR VOTE IN THE 

06:37:31.727 --> 06:37:34.416
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITHOUT 
ANY FEAR THAT THIS IS BEING 

06:37:34.636 --> 06:37:36.636
INTERFERED WITH FROM ANY

06:37:39.486 --> 06:37:41.720
QUARTER WHATSOEVER SO I WANT TO 
THANK YOU FOR MAKING WHAT I 

06:37:41.936 --> 06:37:43.936
THINK WAS ALSO VERY ELOQUENT AND

06:37:49.843 --> 06:37:51.275
HEARTFELT DEFENSE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DR. HILL. 

06:37:51.276 --> 06:37:53.509
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL AND MR. HOLMES, 
THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING FACT 

06:37:53.709 --> 06:37:56.962
WITNESSES.  WE ARE HERE AS 
FACTFINDERS AND WE APPRECIATE 

06:37:57.164 --> 06:37:59.164
VERY MUCH YOUR PRESENTATION.

06:38:03.261 --> 06:38:05.496
DR. HILL, I WANT TO VERIFY THE 
STORY. I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU 

06:38:05.697 --> 06:38:08.945
WERE 11 YEARS OLD THAT THERE WAS
A SCHOOLBOY THAT SET YOUR 

06:38:09.146 --> 06:38:13.817
PIGTAILS ON FIRE AND YOU ARE 
TAKING A TEST AND YOU TURNED 

06:38:14.018 --> 06:38:16.018
AROUND WITH YOUR HANDS AND

06:38:21.135 --> 06:38:22.754
GOT THE FIRE OUT AND FINISH YOUR
TEST. 

06:38:22.755 --> 06:38:27.637
&gt;&gt; IT IS A  TRUE STORY AND I WAS
SURPRISED TO SEE THAT POP UP. IT

06:38:27.838 --> 06:38:30.205
IS A STORY THAT I OCCASIONALLY 
TELL

06:38:35.154 --> 06:38:38.191
I LOOKED LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD 
AFTER THAT IN MY BOWL HAIRCUT. 

06:38:38.391 --> 06:38:42.660
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT UNDERSCORES  TO 
THE FACT THAT YOU SPEAK TRUTH 

06:38:43.611 --> 06:38:50.745
AND I TRULY RESPECT THAT. LET ME
MOVE TO YOUR TESTIMONY AND 

06:38:50.924 --> 06:38:54.569
DEPOSITION. YOU HAD INDICATED 
THAT YOU ARE DEEPLY TROUBLED

06:38:58.714 --> 06:39:00.896
BY THE ATTACKS ON AMBASSADOR 
YOVANOVITCH AND YOU UNDERSCORED 

06:39:02.768 --> 06:39:05.002
THAT ALL INVESTORS SERVE AT THE 
PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND 

06:39:05.215 --> 06:39:09.069
CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF 
AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH, HE 

06:39:09.271 --> 06:39:14.957
COULD'VE JUST ASKED HER TO COME 
HOME  BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN 

06:39:15.371 --> 06:39:16.990
AND IN FACT THERE WAS A 
SYSTEMATIC CHARACTER 

06:39:16.991 --> 06:39:20.978
ASSASSINATION THAT WENT ON FROM 
2018 IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN

06:39:29.581 --> 06:39:32.030
BUT YOU SAY IT THE MOST OBVIOUS 
EXPLANATION THAT IT HAS TO BE 

06:39:32.230 --> 06:39:34.230
SAID AND IT SEEMED TO BE 
BUSINESS DEALINGS OF INDIVIDUALS

06:39:34.262 --> 06:39:36.495
WHO WANTED TO IMPROVE THEIR 
INVESTMENT POSITIONS INSIDE OF 

06:39:37.260 --> 06:39:39.260
UKRAINE ITSELF.

06:39:42.181 --> 06:39:44.181
YOU WOULD THEN ASK WHO THESE 
UNDERSTAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

06:39:44.216 --> 06:39:46.448
HER REMOVAL AND USE IT I 
UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE THE RESULT

06:39:46.649 --> 06:39:50.303
OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT MR. 
GIULIANI HAD SET IN MOTION IN 

06:39:50.505 --> 06:39:52.530
CONJUNCTION WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE
WRITING ARTICLES AND

06:39:57.622 --> 06:39:59.641
PUBLICATIONS THAT I HAD EXPECTED
BETTER OF. ALSO, YOU KNOW THE 

06:39:59.856 --> 06:40:01.856
CONSTANT DRUMBEAT OF THESE 
ACCUSATIONS THAT HE WAS MAKING 

06:40:01.875 --> 06:40:07.975
ON THE TELEVISION. SO, RUDY 
GIULIANI WAS PLAYING FAST AND 

06:40:08.174 --> 06:40:13.661
FURIOUS IN UKRAINE IT WOULD 
APPEAR. IS THAT CORRECT? 

06:40:13.662 --> 06:40:16.454
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.  
&gt;&gt; HE HAD NO OFFICIAL TASKING 

06:40:20.779 --> 06:40:21.994
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 

06:40:21.995 --> 06:40:23.612
&gt;&gt; OUT THAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD 
WITH. 

06:40:23.613 --> 06:40:27.880
&gt;&gt; DID HE WORK  WITH OFFICIALS? 
&gt;&gt; I WAS LED TO UNDERSTAND, YES.

06:40:28.644 --> 06:40:34.119
&gt;&gt;  YOU SAID THIS WAS A MASSIVE 
COMPLICATION IN TERMS OF THE 

06:40:34.285 --> 06:40:38.639
ENGAGEMENT WITH UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:40:38.640 --> 06:40:40.272
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPLAIN 
THAT?  

06:40:40.273 --> 06:40:44.560
&gt;&gt; I THINK I ALREADY LAID THAT 
OUT  IN THE RESPONSE TO SOME OF 

06:40:45.304 --> 06:40:52.061
THE QUESTIONS AND WE WERE 
ACTUALLY CONDUCTING FOR WHAT THE

06:40:52.262 --> 06:40:55.097
AMERICAN PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S
A BORING AND STANDARD POLICY 

06:40:56.051 --> 06:41:01.133
TOWARD UKRAINE PUSHING THEM ON 
ISSUES OF REFORM IN THE ENERGY 

06:41:01.307 --> 06:41:08.100
SECTOR AND WE WERE CONCERNED 
ABOUT CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE AND 

06:41:08.300 --> 06:41:10.696
WE WANTED TO HELP THEM GET 
SOVEREIGNTY AFTER ATTACKS BY 

06:41:10.865 --> 06:41:12.865
RUSSIA

06:41:14.605 --> 06:41:15.820
-- 
&gt;&gt; HOW DID MR. GIULIANI'S 

06:41:15.821 --> 06:41:17.853
INVOLVEMENT AFFECT THINGS? 
&gt;&gt; WE HAD WORKED OUT  OVER THE 

06:41:18.053 --> 06:41:20.207
COURSE OF TWO YEARS IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE EMBASSY

06:41:23.742 --> 06:41:27.127
AND THE INTER-AGENCY AGREED 
ACTION PLAN. THESE ARE THINGS 

06:41:27.312 --> 06:41:29.312
THAT

06:41:36.531 --> 06:41:38.531
COLONEL VINDMAN AND OTHERS HAVE 
BEEN WORKING ON. RUDY GIULIANI 

06:41:38.564 --> 06:41:41.349
DID NOT CARE AT ALL ABOUT THIS. 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND WAS NOT 

06:41:45.881 --> 06:41:48.113
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS EITHER AND 
IT WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT 

06:41:48.313 --> 06:41:49.742
EVERYONE IN A ROUTINE MOVES 
FORWARD ON. 

06:41:49.743 --> 06:41:54.814
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, YOU TALKED ABOUT
THE EXTRAORDINARY POWER THAT 

06:41:55.028 --> 06:42:00.712
RUSSIA TRIES TO ASSERT AGAINST 
UKRAINE. SINCE PRESIDENT 

06:42:00.912 --> 06:42:03.724
ZELENSKY NEVER GOT HIS WHITE 
HOUSE MEETING , DOESN'T THAT 

06:42:03.896 --> 06:42:05.896
MAKE

06:42:08.237 --> 06:42:13.119
UKRAINE LOOK WEAK AND DOES NOT 
BENEFIT RUSSIA? 

06:42:13.120 --> 06:42:15.141
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, IT DOES. 
&gt;&gt; PRUNING THE FALSE CLAIM OF  

06:42:15.356 --> 06:42:20.838
UKRAINE INTERVENTION INTO THE U.
S. ELECTION,  THAT ALSO BENEFITS

06:42:21.039 --> 06:42:22.257
RUSSIA, DOESN'T IT? 
&gt;&gt; IT DOES. 

06:42:22.258 --> 06:42:26.926
&gt;&gt;  WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP MEETS 
PRIVATELY WITH WHAT WE PUTIN AT 

06:42:27.125 --> 06:42:29.157
THE G 20 SUMMIT, WHO DOES THAT 
BENEFIT? 

06:42:29.158 --> 06:42:32.210
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T HELP UKRAINE.  
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T HELP UKRAINE AND 

06:42:32.411 --> 06:42:38.297
BY  PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING 
UKRAINE CORRUPT, DOES THAT COME 

06:42:39.048 --> 06:42:41.048
TO RUSSIANS

06:42:42.778 --> 06:42:44.560
BENEFIT? 
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, DOESN'T HELP UKRAINE. 

06:42:44.561 --> 06:42:48.257
&gt;&gt;  I THINK YOU AND I WILL YIELD
THE REST OF MY TIME TO YOU. 

06:42:48.258 --> 06:42:54.149
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE  YIELDING ME THREE 
SECONDS. NOT EVEN I CAN MAKE USE

06:42:54.347 --> 06:42:59.431
OF THREE SECONDS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I 

06:42:59.634 --> 06:43:05.319
ACTUALLY HAVE NO QUESTIONS  FOR 
YOU THAT HAVE NOT ARTIE BEEN 

06:43:05.520 --> 06:43:07.953
ASKED OR MAKE POINTS THAT HAVE 
NOT ALREADY BEEN MADE. I GUESS I

06:43:08.168 --> 06:43:10.168
WOULD JUST CONCLUDE MY SOMETHING
I HAVE SAID BEFORE. THIS 

06:43:10.188 --> 06:43:13.039
IMPEACHMENT POLLUTES THE IS 
FINALLY COMING TO AN END. A YEAR

06:43:13.240 --> 06:43:15.240
OF RESISTANCE AND TWO HALF YEARS

06:43:18.521 --> 06:43:20.521
OF THESE ABSURD ACCUSATIONS 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT WITH 

06:43:20.691 --> 06:43:25.272
RUSSIAN COLLUSION. WE HAVE GONE 
FROM QUID PRO QUO TO BRIBERY AND

06:43:25.445 --> 06:43:29.897
EXTORTION AND SEVEN WEEKS OF 
HEARINGS AND 16 SECRET 

06:43:30.097 --> 06:43:32.948
CLOSED-DOOR SESSIONS AND 12 
PUBLIC HEARINGS NOW WHICH YOU 

06:43:33.148 --> 06:43:35.375
ARE THE LAST WITH HUNDREDS OF 
HOURS OF TESTIMONY

06:43:44.520 --> 06:43:46.553
AND I REALLY THINK FOR THOSE 
THAT HATE THE PRESIDENT, THEY 

06:43:46.754 --> 06:43:49.187
HAVE NOT CHANGED THEIR MINDS BUT
THERE ARE A LOT THAT LOOK AT 

06:43:49.401 --> 06:43:51.422
THIS AND THINK IS THAT IT? 
REALLY? YOU WILL IMPEACH AND 

06:43:51.623 --> 06:43:53.869
REMOVE A PRESIDENT FOR THIS? 
LIKE I SAID, IF YOU DON'T LIKE 

06:43:54.632 --> 06:43:57.120
THE PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE COME TO 
THAT CONCLUSION AND MANY PEOPLE 

06:43:57.320 --> 06:44:01.786
WANTED THIS THREE YEARS AGO BUT 
FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS, THEY CAN

06:44:01.988 --> 06:44:04.224
SEE THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE OF 
ANY BRIBERY AND ZERO EVIDENCE OF

06:44:04.424 --> 06:44:10.110
EXTORTION AND ZERO EVIDENCE OF 
ANY QUID PRO QUO AND YET 

06:44:10.524 --> 06:44:12.524
IMPEACHMENT IS ALMOST 
INEVITABLE.

06:44:15.195 --> 06:44:17.195
WHY? BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN UNFAIR 

06:44:17.228 --> 06:44:20.278
AND DISHONEST AND I KNOW WE HEAR
THESE CROCODILE TEARS FROM SOME 

06:44:20.476 --> 06:44:23.930
OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE 
HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE THEY FINALLY

06:44:24.131 --> 06:44:28.196
HAVE TO IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT 
AND WE KNOW THAT IS ABSURD. 

06:44:28.395 --> 06:44:30.577
THERE IS NO PERIPHERAL

06:44:35.298 --> 06:44:37.330
TEARS OVER THIS. THEY ARE 
GETTING OVER THIS AND THERE IS 

06:44:37.531 --> 06:44:43.016
ON A PERSON IN THE COUNTRY THAT 
DOESN'T KNOW THAT. EVERYONE 

06:44:43.230 --> 06:44:45.452
KNOWS THEY WILL IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT AND SEND IT ON TO THE 

06:44:45.667 --> 06:44:48.304
SENATE BUT THAT IS THE GOOD 
NEWS. THAT IS GOOD NEWS. WE'VE 

06:44:48.503 --> 06:44:53.986
ALL BEEN TO A CONCERT AND YOU 
HAVE THE WARM-UP BAND AND THEN 

06:44:54.188 --> 06:44:56.664
YOU HAVE THE MAIN ACTIVE WHAT WE
HAVE SEEN HERE IS THE WARM-UP 

06:44:56.839 --> 06:45:01.707
BAND. THIS IS LIKE A BAND BUT NO
ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF BUT THE 

06:45:01.905 --> 06:45:05.437
WARM-UP AND IS OVER AND NOW WE 
WILL GO ON TO THE MAIN EVENT AND

06:45:05.608 --> 06:45:07.608
IN THE U.S. SENATE, THERE WON'T 
BE ANY SECRET TESTIMONY OR 

06:45:08.363 --> 06:45:10.363
DISHONEST LEADERSHIP

06:45:12.073 --> 06:45:14.092
FOR CHILDREN THAT REFUSES TO LET
US ASK APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS OR 

06:45:14.307 --> 06:45:17.961
TO DENY A DEFENSE. WHERE IN THE 
WORLD AND WERE IN THE COUNTRY DO

06:45:18.161 --> 06:45:22.028
YOU HAVE A TRIAL WHERE THE 
PROSECUTION PRESENTS THE CASE 

06:45:22.226 --> 06:45:26.492
AND THE DEFENSE IS NOT ABLE TO? 
WE WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO GET 

06:45:26.692 --> 06:45:32.580
TO THE TRUTH. I AM TALKING OUT 
OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. 

06:45:32.995 --> 06:45:35.631
THESE ARE SOME OF THE WITNESSES 
THAT YOU NEED TO CALL IN SOME OF

06:45:35.830 --> 06:45:38.626
THE QUESTIONS YOU NEED TASK. 
FIRST, YOU HAVE TO HEAR FROM THE

06:45:38.793 --> 06:45:43.551
WHISTLEBLOWER. THEY CAN CHOOSE 
TO DO THAT IN CLOSED SESSION IF 

06:45:43.756 --> 06:45:46.601
THEY WANT TO AND I LEAVE IT UP 
TO THEM BUT YOU CAN INITIATE AN 

06:45:46.801 --> 06:45:48.833
IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND NOT HAVE 

06:45:49.037 --> 06:45:53.917
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. WHO 
DID HE GET HIS INFORMATION FROM?

06:45:54.117 --> 06:45:57.894
DID HE HAVE THE CLASSIFICATION 
OR CLEARANCES TO GET THAT.

06:46:02.653 --> 06:46:04.653
WHAT IS HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND WHAT 

06:46:04.671 --> 06:46:10.774
HAS HE SHARED? I THINK OUR OWN 
CHAIRMAN NEEDS TO BE CALLED. 

06:46:11.176 --> 06:46:16.460
WHAT INTERACTIONS DID HE HAVE 
AND WHAT DID HE HAVE TO 

06:46:16.661 --> 06:46:21.063
COORDINATE OR IN ANY WAY 
FACILITATE AND WHAT ABOUT HUNTER

06:46:21.245 --> 06:46:23.245
BIDEN

06:46:27.421 --> 06:46:29.421
. HERE IS THE KEY TO THIS.

06:46:32.906 --> 06:46:34.935
IF HE MAKES MONEY, KNOCK 
YOURSELF OUT. I DON'T CARE BUT 

06:46:35.150 --> 06:46:37.150
DID HE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

06:46:40.634 --> 06:46:43.015
IN GOVERNMENT POLICY WAS THAT 
CHANGED AT A PARTICULARLY HIGH 

06:46:43.200 --> 06:46:46.459
LEVEL BECAUSE OF SOME OF THOSE? 
DEVON ARCHER IN ALEXANDRIA

06:46:50.360 --> 06:46:54.954
CHALUPA THAT ADMITTED THAT SHE 
HAD FALSE INFORMATION AND

06:47:06.017 --> 06:47:08.073
NELLIE OHR WITH THE STEEL 
DOSSIER. I WOULD LIKE TREMENDOUS

06:47:08.250 --> 06:47:10.250
WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY. THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT A LOT IN 

06:47:10.282 --> 06:47:12.519
POLITICS AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE
FIGHT IN THE DEBATE  BUT ALSO 

06:47:12.721 --> 06:47:14.550
EXPECT BASIC FAIRNESS IN THESE 
PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN ANYTHING 

06:47:14.551 --> 06:47:16.719
BUT FAIR. LISTENER HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THAT.

06:47:20.853 --> 06:47:25.469
I LOOK FORWARD TO COMPLETING THE
JOB AND WITH THAT I WILL YIELD 

06:47:25.652 --> 06:47:27.652
BACK.  
&gt;&gt; 

06:47:30.594 --> 06:47:35.876
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WHEN 
WE LAST LEFT JULY 10, I BELIEVE 

06:47:36.077 --> 06:47:42.182
THE AMBASSADOR BOLTON SAID TO 
YOU, YOU GO AND TELL EISENBERG 

06:47:42.382 --> 06:47:45.585
THAT I AM NOT PART OF WHATEVER 
DRUG DEAL THEY ARE COOKING UP ON

06:47:45.765 --> 06:47:47.765
THIS.

06:47:50.297 --> 06:47:52.689
THAT'S CORRECT, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:47:52.690 --> 06:47:54.690
&gt;&gt; 

06:47:59.651 --> 06:48:01.651
HE IS THE CHIEF LAWYER FOR THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, 

06:48:01.669 --> 06:48:02.283
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

06:48:02.284 --> 06:48:05.336
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE HIM? 
&gt;&gt; I DID GO TO SEE HIM.  I GAVE 

06:48:05.538 --> 06:48:08.619
A SENSE THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU
ON 10 JULY.  

06:48:08.620 --> 06:48:10.620
&gt;&gt; WHAT TOOK PLACE? 
&gt;&gt; OF WHAT TOOK PLACE, CORRECT 

06:48:10.739 --> 06:48:13.659
INCLUDING THE DETAILS I SHARE 
WITH YOU  WITH WHAT TRANSPIRED 

06:48:13.858 --> 06:48:16.296
AS I WAS WALKING IN. 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE  ONE OR TWO 

06:48:16.509 --> 06:48:22.317
MEETINGS WITH HIM ABOUT THAT? 
&gt;&gt;  I GAVE HIM THE QUICK SUMMARY

06:48:24.217 --> 06:48:28.421
AND WE AGREED THAT WE MEET AGAIN
ON THE 11th THE NEXT DAY AND I 

06:48:28.593 --> 06:48:33.768
ALSO WANTED TO BRING MY 
COLLEAGUE FOR ENERGY WHO HAD 

06:48:33.968 --> 06:48:38.797
BEEN SITTING WITH ME ON THE SOFA
FOR THE FIRST PORTION OF THE 

06:48:38.973 --> 06:48:44.335
MEETING. ALSO, I SUGGESTED THAT 
HE SPEAK TO NEVER TRUMPER 

06:48:44.536 --> 06:48:49.415
SEPARATELY BECAUSE TRINITY WAS 
IN THE  WAR ROOM WHEN I WRITE 

06:48:49.617 --> 06:48:51.651
AND HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN SOME 
DISCUSSION BEFORE I GOT THERE 

06:48:51.852 --> 06:48:55.705
AND AS I GOT TO THE ROOM, THEY 
WERE CLEARLY IN THE COURSE OF 

06:48:55.906 --> 06:49:00.585
CONVERSATION AND I THOUGHT IT 
WAS IMPORTANT FOR JOHN EISENBERG

06:49:00.786 --> 06:49:02.786
TO HEAR FROM

06:49:07.075 --> 06:49:09.075
COLONEL VINDMAN HIMSELF OF WHAT 
HIS RECOLLECTIONS OF THE MEETING

06:49:09.108 --> 06:49:10.738
WERE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU RAISE THE CONCERNS THAT  

06:49:10.739 --> 06:49:12.773
AMBASSADOR BOLTON RACE, DID YOU 
RAISE THAT TO THEM QUESTIONS AND

06:49:13.532 --> 06:49:15.532
I DID.

06:49:17.843 --> 06:49:19.675
EXECUTIVE PROCESS OF WHAT 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON HAD ASKED ME 

06:49:19.676 --> 06:49:21.506
TO. 
&gt;&gt; IN THE COURSE OF THOSE TWO  

06:49:21.507 --> 06:49:23.740
MEETINGS, WHAT DID THIS YEAR 
EISENBERG SAY IN RESPONSE? 

06:49:23.741 --> 06:49:29.427
&gt;&gt;  HE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY 
AND SAID THAT COLONEL VINDMAN 

06:49:30.189 --> 06:49:37.558
SHOULD  FEEL FREE TO BRING 
CONCERNS ABOUT THESE MEETINGS 

06:49:37.959 --> 06:49:43.443
AND CERTAINLY MYSELF AND ANY 
OTHERS IF THERE WAS ANY 

06:49:43.644 --> 06:49:48.928
SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-UP IN TERMS OF
THESE ISSUES BEING RAISED WITH 

06:49:49.128 --> 06:49:50.548
ANY OF THE PARTIES IN THE 
FUTURE. 

06:49:50.549 --> 06:49:52.999
&gt;&gt; HE DID THINKING IN RESPONSE 
ABOUT HOW HE TOOK THAT MEETING  

06:49:53.197 --> 06:49:56.434
OR HOW HE WOULD DESCRIBE IT OR 
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT YOU 

06:49:56.648 --> 06:49:59.590
TOLD HIM THAT TOOK PLACE? 
&gt;&gt;  NO, HE LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY

06:49:59.936 --> 06:50:03.687
TO THE INFORMATION. 
&gt;&gt; BACK TO THAT 

06:50:07.005 --> 06:50:09.005
, WHO IS IN THAT

06:50:13.095 --> 06:50:18.380
WITH THE UKRAINIANS?  
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR VOLKER  AND 

06:50:18.580 --> 06:50:22.566
SONDLAND IN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE I
THINK  FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT

06:50:23.863 --> 06:50:29.089
IF THE GROUP HAD BEEN THERE TOO.
I HONESTLY CAN'T REMEMBER. 

06:50:29.090 --> 06:50:31.090
&gt;&gt; 

06:50:33.405 --> 06:50:35.651
AMBASSADOR VOLKER WAS THERE. 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS THERE BUT HE DID NOT 

06:50:35.851 --> 06:50:39.503
SPEAK  DURING THAT MEETING AND I
HEARD HIS DEPOSITION AND I READ 

06:50:39.704 --> 06:50:44.586
HIS DEPOSITION WHERE HE DIDN'T 
REALLY RECALL THAT ENCOUNTER AND

06:50:44.787 --> 06:50:51.893
HE DIDN'T REALLY SPEAK. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT  AS 

06:50:52.094 --> 06:50:55.080
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE HAD 
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CHIEF OF 

06:50:55.267 --> 06:50:58.934
STAFF AND IF THEY WERE GOING 
FORWARD WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS.

06:51:00.627 --> 06:51:03.335
WHILE THIS WAS TAKING PLACE, HOW
ARE THE UKRAINIANS REACTING TO 

06:51:03.515 --> 06:51:07.889
WHAT WAS BEING SAID. 
&gt;&gt;  AT THE TIME, HE WAS QUITE 

06:51:08.059 --> 06:51:10.059
IMPRESSIVE

06:51:11.602 --> 06:51:14.436
IN HIS AIDE WAS WITH HIM AND HIS
AIDE WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM AND

06:51:14.637 --> 06:51:16.637
ORIGINALLY IT WAS AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON

06:51:19.721 --> 06:51:24.806
AND FROM TIME TO TIME, HE WAS 
WHISPERING TO HIM. I HAD NOT MET

06:51:25.005 --> 06:51:27.843
HIM BEFORE SO I WAS NOT SURE HOW
THAT HIS ENGLISH WAS OR IF YOU 

06:51:28.057 --> 06:51:32.925
COULD REFLECT ON THAT AS TO 
WHETHER HE WAS HAVING POINTS OF 

06:51:33.327 --> 06:51:34.556
CLARIFICATION. 
&gt;&gt; HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS 

06:51:34.557 --> 06:51:37.795
HAPPENING. 
&gt;&gt;  I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE IF HE

06:51:38.007 --> 06:51:40.007
WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE 
BACK-AND-FORTH.

06:51:44.305 --> 06:51:46.941
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE WAS MORE ALARMED 
AT THE FACT THAT THIS WAS JUST 

06:51:47.546 --> 06:51:51.416
BACK-AND-FORTH  WITH THE MEETING
AND THEY VERY MUCH WANTED TO 

06:51:51.616 --> 06:51:56.485
HAVE THIS MEETING IN THE U. S. 
OFFICIALS WERE ARGUING ABOUT THE

06:51:56.686 --> 06:51:58.720
MEETING IN FRONT OF HIM AND THAT
WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE

06:51:59.485 --> 06:52:03.801
FOR HIM. 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW-UP TO 

06:52:04.004 --> 06:52:09.288
THAT?  
&gt;&gt;  I WANT TO ADD THAT HE DOES 

06:52:09.691 --> 06:52:12.284
SPEAK PERFECT ENGLISH BUT 
SOMETIMES DOES ASK FOR 

06:52:12.465 --> 06:52:14.718
CLARIFICATION. 
&gt;&gt; I YIELD BACK. 

06:52:23.495 --> 06:52:25.945
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I TURN TO OUR 
WITNESSES, I WANTED TO SAY TO MY

06:52:26.147 --> 06:52:27.978
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES, AND A 
SINGLE A MEMBER OF THIS 

06:52:27.979 --> 06:52:29.999
COMMITTEE HAS SAID RUSSIA DID 
NOT MEDDLE IN THE 2016 ELECTION 

06:52:30.835 --> 06:52:32.670
AND AS THE RANKING MEMBER 
STATED, WE PUBLISHED A REPORT 

06:52:32.671 --> 06:52:34.334
FOCUSED ON RUSSIAN ACTIVE 
MEASURES IN 2016 WITH POLICY 

06:52:34.335 --> 06:52:36.099
RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW TO 
STRENGTHEN THE CYBER RESILIENCY 

06:52:36.100 --> 06:52:38.100
AND ELECTION SECURITY

06:52:40.153 --> 06:52:42.185
. I MYSELF HAVE WORKED WITH 
MEMBERS OF THIS VERY COMMITTEE 

06:52:42.400 --> 06:52:45.436
ON THIS ISSUE BUT ALSO ON THE 
SERVICES COMMITTEE SO TO HAVE 

06:52:45.649 --> 06:52:48.284
THE DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES SAY 
THESE UNTRUTHFUL STATEMENTS 

06:52:48.685 --> 06:52:53.512
REEKS OF POLITICAL DESPERATION 
IN THEIR CONTINUED OBSESSION TO 

06:52:53.751 --> 06:52:57.161
MANIPULATE MAINSTREAM MEDIA BUT 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE AMERICAN 

06:52:57.336 --> 06:53:00.269
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS 
BEEN A PROCESS FROM THE START AT

06:53:00.476 --> 06:53:02.476
THE DEMOCRATIC ORDINATION

06:53:05.352 --> 06:53:07.331
IN THE ASSESSMENT AND A 
STUNNINGLY UNPRECEDENTED 

06:53:07.332 --> 06:53:11.240
CLOSED-DOOR PROCESS AND MAJORITY
OF MEMBERS AND TO THE PRESS AND 

06:53:11.440 --> 06:53:17.127
TO THE PEOPLE STARTING THIS 
INQUIRY WITHOUT TAKING A VOTE IN

06:53:17.326 --> 06:53:19.923
THEM AND FINALLY FORCED TO TAKE 
THE VOTE, IT IS BIPARTISAN 

06:53:20.101 --> 06:53:22.101
OPPOSITION.

06:53:25.045 --> 06:53:27.294
WITH FOUR MINUTES OF, I WILL 
TURN TO THE TWO WITNESSES. THANK

06:53:27.491 --> 06:53:29.725
YOU BOTH FOR YOUR SERVICE AND 
THANK YOU DR. HILL FOR YOUR 

06:53:29.928 --> 06:53:31.928
COMMENTS ON THE PERSONAL 
ATTACKS. I WANTED TO ASK YOU 

06:53:31.958 --> 06:53:33.958
EACH FACT BASED QUESTIONS. DR. 
HILL, YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU 

06:53:33.991 --> 06:53:37.442
HANDED OVER YOUR DUTIES ON JULY 
15 AND THAT YOU PHYSICALLY LEFT 

06:53:37.644 --> 06:53:39.644
THE WHITE HOUSE

06:53:42.110 --> 06:53:43.739
ON JULY 19, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:53:43.740 --> 06:53:49.022
&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS BY THE TIME THERE 
WAS THE  LIGHT 26 CALL WITH 

06:53:49.223 --> 06:53:51.223
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY, YOU WERE NO LONGER ON 

06:53:51.256 --> 06:53:53.288
THE NFC, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt;  I WAS STILL TECHNICALLY ON 

06:53:53.491 --> 06:53:57.756
THE PAYROLL UNTIL THE END OF 
AUGUST BUT I WAS NOT PHYSICALLY 

06:53:58.518 --> 06:54:02.346
IN THE BUILDING AND I HAD 
HEATHER OVER MY DUTIES.

06:54:06.489 --> 06:54:08.723
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT ON THE CALL? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:54:08.724 --> 06:54:10.724
&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT PARTICIPATE 

06:54:14.408 --> 06:54:16.240
IN PREPARATION OR COORDINATION 
OF SETTING UP THE CALL? 

06:54:16.241 --> 06:54:19.078
&gt;&gt; NOT FOR THAT CALL BUT LET ME 
SAY FOR THE RECORD  THAT THERE 

06:54:19.335 --> 06:54:21.874
HAD BEEN A LONG ANTICIPATION AND
THERE WOULD EVENTUALLY BE A 

06:54:22.061 --> 06:54:24.975
CALL. THERE WAS A PACKAGE THAT 
WAS PREPARED IN ADVANCE BUT I 

06:54:25.178 --> 06:54:28.628
CANNOT SAY HOW MUCH OF THAT 
PACKAGE HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH 

06:54:29.388 --> 06:54:34.915
THE INAUGURATION IF IT WAS THEN 
USED WITH THE BASIC MATERIAL OF 

06:54:35.083 --> 06:54:40.410
THAT CALL. I DID TAKE PART IN 
THAT BUT I DID NOT TAKE PART IN 

06:54:41.173 --> 06:54:45.281
ANY PREPARATION IN SPECIFIC. 
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME YOU READ THE 

06:54:45.480 --> 06:54:49.751
TRANSCRIPT OF THE CALL  WAS WHEN
IT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. 

06:54:49.989 --> 06:54:55.434
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  MR. HOLMES, I WANTED TO TURN

06:54:55.648 --> 06:54:57.882
TO YOU AND GOOD TO SEE YOU 
AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING 

06:54:58.083 --> 06:55:00.342
THE BIPARTISAN DELEGATION THAT I
LEAD WITH MY FRIENDS IN ANTHONY 

06:55:00.517 --> 06:55:04.730
BROWN FOR MARYLAND. WE DO HAVE 
AN INFORMATIVE VISIT WHERE WE 

06:55:04.908 --> 06:55:10.668
HIGHLIGHTED THE BIPARTISAN 
CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT WITH THE 

06:55:10.882 --> 06:55:15.347
IMPORTANCE OF COUNTERING RUSSIAN
AGGRESSION AND WE DISCUSSED THE 

06:55:15.549 --> 06:55:22.663
IMPORTANCE OF DEFENSIVE AID 
WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT DETERRENT 

06:55:23.423 --> 06:55:27.532
TO RUSSIA AND I WANT TO 
HIGHLIGHT ON THE RECORD, I KNOW 

06:55:27.732 --> 06:55:32.005
THIS HAS BEEN ASKED IN THE 
JAPANESE WERE PROVIDED BY THE 

06:55:32.203 --> 06:55:33.629
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND NOT 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, CORRECT? 

06:55:33.630 --> 06:55:35.811
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT AND I THINK 
WE  EXPERIENCED

06:55:42.158 --> 06:55:43.574
ALL THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANTS. 

06:55:43.575 --> 06:55:45.607
&gt;&gt; WHICH I STRONGLY SUPPORT. 
AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR BEING A 

06:55:45.809 --> 06:55:48.255
HOST ON THAT.  DR. HILL, TURNING
BACK TO YOU, THERE HAS BEEN 

06:55:48.457 --> 06:55:49.673
DISCUSSION OF SCHEDULING 
MEETINGS BETWEEN PRESIDENT 

06:55:49.674 --> 06:55:54.545
ZELENSKY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP  
AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT THERE WAS

06:55:54.759 --> 06:55:56.759
HESITANCY TO SCHEDULE THIS 
MEETING UNTIL AFTER THE 

06:55:56.914 --> 06:56:00.844
UKRAINIAN ELECTION, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 

06:56:00.845 --> 06:56:02.876
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS BECAUSE  THERE WAS 

06:56:03.078 --> 06:56:06.446
SPECULATION IN UKRAINE AND 
OUTSIDE OF UKRAINE THAT

06:56:17.505 --> 06:56:19.737
ZELENSKY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO 
GET THE MAJORITY TO FORM A 

06:56:19.938 --> 06:56:21.156
CABINET, CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; I IS CORRECT. 

06:56:21.157 --> 06:56:23.157
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO TESTIFIED THAT THE 
HESITANCY TO SCHEDULE THIS 

06:56:23.188 --> 06:56:25.020
MEETING WAS BASED ON BROADER 
CONCERNS  RELATED TO 

06:56:25.021 --> 06:56:28.474
ANTICORRUPTION REFORMS AND THIS 
WAS IN SPECIFIC RELATION WITH 

06:56:29.232 --> 06:56:31.646
THE OWNER OF THE TV COMPANY THAT

06:56:36.195 --> 06:56:38.225
THE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN A PART OF.
IS THAT CORRECT? 

06:56:38.226 --> 06:56:41.476
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  DOWN TO THE KEY FACTS, I 

06:56:41.677 --> 06:56:44.314
WANTED TO ASK BOTH OF YOU THREE 
KEY QUESTIONS. THE FACT OF THE 

06:56:45.077 --> 06:56:48.627
MATTER IS UKRAINE ULTIMATELY DID
RECEIVE THE EIGHT, CORRECT? 

06:56:48.628 --> 06:56:50.628
&gt;&gt;  ULTIMATELY. 
&gt;&gt; 

06:56:54.669 --> 06:56:56.098
CORRECT, ULTIMATELY. 
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION 

06:56:56.099 --> 06:56:58.099
INTO THE BIDENS, CORRECT?  
&gt;&gt; 

06:57:01.784 --> 06:57:03.615
WOULD THEY DO NOT OPEN 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BIDENS. 

06:57:03.616 --> 06:57:05.616
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  THERE WAS IN FACT A MEETING 

06:57:05.650 --> 06:57:09.703
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AT THE UN, IS

06:57:09.905 --> 06:57:11.905
THAT CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt;  THE PRESIDENT INVITED

06:57:15.604 --> 06:57:18.037
ZELENSKY TO THE OVAL OFFICE ON A
DATE AND DETERMINE THAT HAS NOT 

06:57:18.238 --> 06:57:23.464
HAPPENED. 
&gt;&gt;  THEY MET AT THE UN? 

06:57:23.465 --> 06:57:24.939
&gt;&gt; THEY DID BUT ON THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 

06:57:24.940 --> 06:57:27.376
&gt;&gt; BUT THEY DID HAVE A MEETING 
IN THE UN.  

06:57:27.377 --> 06:57:29.768
&gt;&gt;  THEY DID. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, I YIELD BACK. 

06:57:33.273 --> 06:57:35.505
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL, I THINK A LOT OF 
AMERICANS WERE SCRATCHING THEIR 

06:57:35.709 --> 06:57:38.142
HEADS YESTERDAY AS  AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND TESTIFIED THAT ON SOME 

06:57:38.342 --> 06:57:40.577
SUMMER NIGHT,  HE CALLS THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

06:57:40.776 --> 06:57:45.459
AND JUST AS BROADLY WHAT DO YOU 
WANT FROM UKRAINE AND THE 

06:57:45.658 --> 06:57:48.628
PRESIDENT SAYS THERE IS NO QUID 
PRO QUO.

06:57:52.764 --> 06:57:54.764
LIKE BEING PULLED OVER FOR 
SPEEDING AND BEING ASKED HOW 

06:57:54.793 --> 06:57:57.240
FAST WE ARE GOING AND SAYING I 
DIDN'T ROB THE BANK. I DIDN'T 

06:57:57.442 --> 06:58:03.941
ROB THE BANK. YOUR TESTIMONY 
TODAY IS THAT ON JULY 10 OF THIS

06:58:04.179 --> 06:58:06.991
YEAR, YOU TOLD ONE OF THE 
PRESIDENTS LAWYERS THAT YOU HAD 

06:58:07.195 --> 06:58:09.195
CONCERNS THAT A WHITE HOUSE 
MEETING

06:58:13.078 --> 06:58:14.514
WAS LINKED TO INVESTIGATIONS. IS
THAT RIGHT? 

06:58:14.515 --> 06:58:17.344
&gt;&gt; IS CORRECT. THAT WAS BASED ON
WHAT  SONDLAND SAID  IN THE WAR 

06:58:17.543 --> 06:58:19.779
ROOM. 
&gt;&gt;  THE LAWYERS HAD KNOWLEDGE 

06:58:19.992 --> 06:58:24.487
THAT THERE IS A LEAST CONCERN BY
PRESIDENTIAL EMPLOYEE ABOUT THE 

06:58:24.665 --> 06:58:27.453
LINKAGE, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

06:58:27.454 --> 06:58:31.485
&gt;&gt;  WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR
ALL OF THE

06:58:37.652 --> 06:58:39.901
PRESIDENTS MEN. DO YOU HAVE THAT
SAME CONCERN WHEN YOU SAW THE 

06:58:40.100 --> 06:58:42.100
EMAILS AND PEOPLE THAT WERE 
OUTSIDE THE CHANNELS THAT YOU 

06:58:42.132 --> 06:58:44.367
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON? I WANT TO 
WALK YOU THROUGH SOMETHING YOU 

06:58:44.568 --> 06:58:46.568
TOLD US EARLIER. YOU SAID YOU 
HAVE EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT 

06:58:47.138 --> 06:58:51.415
TRUMP BELIEVES THAT WAS THE UK 
DIRECTOR, IS THAT RIGHT?

06:59:18.504 --> 06:59:20.504
&gt;&gt; HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON I 
COULD 

06:59:24.189 --> 06:59:26.020
THINK OF. 
&gt;&gt; AND PRIOR TO WORKING FOR THE 

06:59:26.021 --> 06:59:28.456
SECURITY COUNSEL 2017-2018 
WORKED FOR RANKING MEMBER NUNES 

06:59:28.658 --> 06:59:30.490
, RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I ONLY FIGURED THAT OUT AFTER

06:59:30.491 --> 06:59:34.620
THE FACT. I WONDERED WHAT WAS 
BEING ASKED ABOUT HIM AND I 

06:59:34.813 --> 06:59:37.796
LOOKED IT UP. 
&gt;&gt; YOU QUESTIONED US ON THE 

06:59:37.999 --> 06:59:39.999
DANGERS OF MINT MEMBERS OF 

06:59:42.679 --> 06:59:44.297
THIS CAN COMMITTEE PEDDLING ANY 
UKRAINIAN CONSPIRACY THEORIES 

06:59:44.298 --> 06:59:46.734
THAT COULD BENEFIT RUSSIA AND I 
WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE 

06:59:46.934 --> 06:59:52.018
HEARD THE NAME LEV PARNAS, OF 
UKRAINE, SOMEONE IN THIS 

06:59:52.219 --> 06:59:53.638

INFLUENCING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

DEBUNKED CONSPIRACY THEORIES 

06:59:56.320 --> 06:59:58.320

07:00:01.501 --> 07:00:03.392
REFERENCED EARLIER. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE HEARD HIS NAME. 

07:00:03.393 --> 07:00:05.900
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE HE WAS INDICTED
ON OCTOBER 10 FOR MAKING FOR 

07:00:06.096 --> 07:00:07.258
CONTRIBUTIONS TO REPUBLICANS IN 
U.S. ELECTIONS. 

07:00:07.259 --> 07:00:10.710
&gt;&gt; I'M AWARE OF THOSE REPORTS, 
YES. 

07:00:10.711 --> 07:00:12.744
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE OF YESTERDAY'S 
DAILY BEAST A STORY REPORTING 

07:00:12.944 --> 07:00:14.944

RANKING MEMBER NUNES  ON HIS 
OVERSEAS INVESTIGATION? 

07:00:19.262 --> 07:00:23.096
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN ASKING THEM IS 

07:00:23.297 --> 07:00:29.001

PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING, 

07:00:45.355 --> 07:00:50.335
WHICH WERE ARRANGED TO HELP HIS 
INVESTIGATIVE WORK. THEY DO NOT 

07:00:50.535 --> 07:00:52.535
SPECIFY WHAT THOSE 
INVESTIGATIONS 

07:00:54.701 --> 07:00:57.853

THESE PROCEEDINGS BY THE RANKING
MEMBER AS BEING A QUOTE UNQUOTE 

07:01:01.303 --> 07:01:04.351
FACT WITNESS. NOW, IF THE STORY 
IS CORRECT, THE RANKING MEMBER 

07:01:04.565 --> 07:01:07.186
MAY HAVE BEEN PROJECTING. IN 
FACT, HE 

07:01:10.438 --> 07:01:12.438
MAY BE THE FACT WITNESS THAT IS 
WORKING WITH INDICTED 

07:01:12.483 --> 07:01:15.115
INDIVIDUALS AROUND OUR

AND THAT 

07:01:36.779 --> 07:01:38.779
WAS FOR

07:01:43.756 --> 07:01:45.756
DISSENT YOU BROUGHT UP AGAINST 
AN ADMINISTRATION POLICY IS THAT

07:01:45.790 --> 07:01:46.390

PHOTO? 

07:01:55.536 --> 07:01:57.536
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. 
&gt;&gt;  THAT IS A PHOTOGRAPH MAY 

07:01:57.620 --> 07:02:01.018
2019 WHERE NEWLY ELECTED 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY  VISITED THE 

07:02:01.220 --> 07:02:04.469
EASTERN UKRAINE REGION. IT WAS 
HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE FRONT 

07:02:04.670 --> 07:02:06.670
LINES AS PRESIDENT. CAN 

07:02:09.755 --> 07:02:13.205
YOU JUST TELL AMERICANS WHY IT 
IS SO IMPORTANT THAT OUR HARD 

07:02:13.406 --> 07:02:15.853
EARNED TAX PAYING DOLLARS HELPED
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND THE MEN  

07:02:16.054 --> 07:02:21.538
STANDING BESIDE HIM FIGHT 
AGAINST RUSSIA IN THIS HOT WAR? 

07:02:21.740 --> 07:02:23.740
&gt;&gt; 

07:02:26.008 --> 07:02:27.424
ABSOLUTELY SIR. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY WAS ELECTED ON 

07:02:27.425 --> 07:02:29.425
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY . 

07:02:32.296 --> 07:02:34.531
TO DEFEND UKRAINIAN INTEREST. 
VISIT ANY TIME WHEN UKRAINIANS 

07:02:34.732 --> 07:02:37.784
ARE DEFENDING THEIR SOVEREIGNTY,
THEIR INTEGRITY ON UKRAINIAN 

07:02:38.405 --> 07:02:44.360
SOIL FROM RUSSIAN BACKED 
SOLDIERS WHO ARE ATTACKING THEM.

07:02:44.584 --> 07:02:49.158
THEY SAID 14,000 UKRAINIAN LIVES
LOST IN THIS WAR SO FAR, AS I 

07:02:49.382 --> 07:02:51.382
MENTIONED A FEW THIS 

07:02:53.827 --> 07:02:56.064
WEEK ALREADY. THIS IS A HOT WAR,
NOT A FROZEN CONFLICT. PEOPLE 

07:02:56.264 --> 07:02:58.713
ARE SHOOTING EACH OTHER AND 
DYING, INJURED EVERY SINGLE 

07:02:58.914 --> 07:03:04.602
WEEK. DESPITE THE ONGOING WAR, 
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO PURSUE 

07:03:04.879 --> 07:03:06.879
PEACE. PRESIDENT ZELENSKY RIGHT 
NOW IS TRYING TO PURSUE A SUMMIT

07:03:07.038 --> 07:03:10.292
MEETING  WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN IN
ORDER TO TRY TO BRING THIS WAR 

07:03:10.493 --> 07:03:13.528
TO A CONCLUSION SO THEY CAN MOVE
ON WITH ALL THE DIFFICULT THINGS

07:03:13.743 --> 07:03:15.814
THEY NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF 
BUILDING THE ECONOMY AND 

07:03:16.002 --> 07:03:20.644
REFORMING AND WHATNOT. ONE OTHER
THING SIR, IF I MAY, MR. TURNER 

07:03:20.847 --> 07:03:24.714
HAS ADJUSTED EARLIER THAT I HAD 
SOMEHOW EMBARRASSED PRESIDENT 

07:03:24.915 --> 07:03:27.351
ZELENSKY.  I HAVE THE DEEPEST 
RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. 

07:03:27.752 --> 07:03:33.644
THIS IS A GUY, JEWISH 
BACKGROUND, POST-SOVIET 

07:03:33.841 --> 07:03:35.841
INDUSTRIAL SUBURB IN 

07:03:39.270 --> 07:03:41.270
SOUTHERN UKRAINE WHO MADE 
HIMSELF ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR 

07:03:41.459 --> 07:03:43.459
ENTERTAINERS IN THE COUNTRY AND,
SOMEHOW, GOT ELECTED PRESIDENT 

07:03:43.600 --> 07:03:45.600
AND HE WILL NOT MISS THAT 
OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A 

07:03:49.689 --> 07:03:51.689
UKRAINIAN PATRIOT. THIS IS A 
TOUGH GUY. FRANKLY, HE WITHSTOOD

07:03:51.723 --> 07:03:55.577
A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR A VERY 
LONG TIME. AND, HE DIDN'T GIVE 

07:03:55.791 --> 07:03:57.791
THAT INTERVIEW. I HAVE THE 
DEEPEST RESPECT FOR HIM, THE 

07:03:57.811 --> 07:04:01.347
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE AND ALSO THE 
DEEPEST RESPECT FOR HIM, THEY 

07:04:01.538 --> 07:04:05.739
HAVE CHOSEN HIM TO HELP DELIVER 
THE FULL MEASURE OF PROMISE OF 

07:04:05.935 --> 07:04:08.171
THE REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY AND I 
THINK HE MERITS ALL OF OUR 

07:04:08.385 --> 07:04:09.802
RESPECT. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. DETERMINE ASKING 

07:04:09.803 --> 07:04:12.851
HIM IS CONSENT TO ENTER THE MAY 
27th PHOTOGRAPH PRINTED ON THE 

07:04:13.051 --> 07:04:16.102
SCREEN INTO THE RECORD. 
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT OBJECTION. 

07:04:16.103 --> 07:04:18.103
&gt;&gt; 

07:04:19.139 --> 07:04:21.232
MR. HOLMES, FOR YEARS OF SERVICE
UNDER THIS COUNTRY I APPRECIATE 

07:04:21.424 --> 07:04:25.443
YOU BEING HERE TODAY. THROUGHOUT
THIS PROCESS, I HAVE SAID THAT I

07:04:25.643 --> 07:04:27.889
WANT TO LEARN THE FACTS SO WE 
CAN GET TO 

07:04:32.878 --> 07:04:36.411
THE TRUTH. WHY ARE WE HERE? 
BECAUSE OF TWO THINGS THAT 

07:04:36.612 --> 07:04:38.445
OCCURRED DURING THE PRESIDENT'S 
JULY 25th PHONE CALL WITH 

07:04:38.446 --> 07:04:41.486
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY.  THE USE OF 
THE PHRASE "DO AS A FAVOR 

07:04:41.695 --> 07:04:44.579
THOUGH" IN REFERENCE TO THE 2016
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE 

07:04:44.770 --> 07:04:49.814
MENTION OF THE WORD BIDEN. I 
BELIEVE BOTH STATEMENTS WERE 

07:04:50.024 --> 07:04:52.861
INAPPROPRIATE, MISGUIDED FOREIGN
POLICY AND CERTAINLY NOT HOW THE

07:04:53.065 --> 07:04:57.530
EXECUTIVE CURRENT OR IN THE 
FUTURE SHOULD HANDLE SUCH A 

07:04:57.744 --> 07:04:59.744
CALL. OVER THE COURSE OF THESE 
HEARINGS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

07:04:59.764 --> 07:05:02.813
HAVE LEARNED ABOUT A SERIES OF 
EVENTS THAT, IN MY VIEW, HAVE 

07:05:03.014 --> 07:05:05.014
UNDERMINED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

07:05:06.680 --> 07:05:08.680
AND UNDERCUT UKRAINE, A KEY 
PARTNER ON THE FRONT LINES 

07:05:08.712 --> 07:05:10.712
AGAINST RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. WE 
HEARD OF 

07:05:12.980 --> 07:05:14.596
U.S. OFFICIALS CARRYING 
UNCORRELATED, CONFUSING, AND 

07:05:14.597 --> 07:05:17.500
CONFLICTING MESSAGES THAT 
CREATED DOUBT AND UNCERTAINTY IN

07:05:17.691 --> 07:05:20.697
KIEV ANYTIME THEY KNEW  
REFORMIST DEMONSTRATION HAD JUST

07:05:21.303 --> 07:05:24.749
TAKEN OFFICE AND WAS READY TO 
FIGHT CORRUPTION AND WORK WITH 

07:05:24.964 --> 07:05:27.660
US TO ADVANCE THE U.S. 
OBJECTIVES. I DISAGREE WITH THIS

07:05:27.850 --> 07:05:29.850
SORT OF BUNDLING 

07:05:32.276 --> 07:05:34.276
FOREIGN POLICY. THROUGH THESE 
HEARINGS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 

07:05:34.326 --> 07:05:37.140
UNWITTINGLY UNDERMINED IT 
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT BY 

07:05:37.356 --> 07:05:40.804
SUGGESTING IT IS SUBSERVIENT TO 
THE UNITED STATES AND WITHOUT 

07:05:41.008 --> 07:05:43.008
THE UNITED STATES, THEY WOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO 

07:05:46.287 --> 07:05:48.359
FUNCTION. UKRAINIANS ARE IN A 
HOT WAR WITH RUSSIA, AND THEY 

07:05:48.549 --> 07:05:52.988
ARE HOLDING THEIR OWN. WE COULD 
BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF 

07:05:53.189 --> 07:05:55.189
THE UKRAINIANS, NOT THE OTHER 

07:05:59.018 --> 07:06:02.125
WAY AROUND. WHILE I THOUGHT THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WOULD 

07:06:02.340 --> 07:06:04.340
ACTUALLY BE ENGAGED IN OVERSIGHT
OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL

07:06:04.361 --> 07:06:06.361
SECURITY COMMUNITIES, AND 
FORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT. WE 

07:06:10.052 --> 07:06:11.880
ARE HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
WANTING TO SERIOUS 

07:06:11.881 --> 07:06:13.714
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES WE HAVE AS
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THE 

07:06:13.715 --> 07:06:15.715
IMPEACHMENT AND REMOVAL OF A 
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, FOR 

07:06:15.737 --> 07:06:17.770
THE PAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE 
LEARNED A FEW THINGS. THE 

07:06:17.971 --> 07:06:20.863
OFFICIAL JULY 25th CALL HAVE 
MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON 

07:06:21.053 --> 07:06:23.657
WHETHER THE CALL WAS CONCERNING 
AND JUST BECAUSE VICE PRESIDENT 

07:06:23.858 --> 07:06:27.311
BIDEN IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 
THAT DOES NOT MEAN CORRUPTION 

07:06:27.525 --> 07:06:31.783
RELATED TO BURISMA, UKRAINE IS 
NOT LARGEST NATIONAL  GAS 

07:06:32.060 --> 07:06:34.060
COMPANY AND THE AMERICANS TIES 
TO IT, ARE 

07:06:38.086 --> 07:06:40.119
NOT CONCERNING. WE HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM RUDY GIULIANI, WE HAVE NOT 

07:06:40.320 --> 07:06:42.756
HEARD FROM HUNTER BIDEN, I WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEIR 

07:06:42.955 --> 07:06:44.787
ACTIVITIES. DESPITE PROMISES OF 
FROM CHAIRMAN SCHIFF, WE HAVE 

07:06:44.788 --> 07:06:46.788
ALSO NOT HEARD  ON THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER. SOMETHING THAT 

07:06:46.822 --> 07:06:48.843
CAN OCCUR IN A CLOSED SETTING 
WITHOUT VIOLATING 

07:06:52.509 --> 07:06:54.328
HIS/HER ANONYMITY. WE NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATIONS AND 

07:06:54.329 --> 07:06:56.765
LEVEL OF COORDINATION THAT 
HAPPENED PRIOR TO HIS/HER 

07:06:56.979 --> 07:06:58.979
SUBMISSION OF 

07:07:02.194 --> 07:07:04.389
THE COMPLAINT. THE PAST FEW 
WEEKS, EVEN TODAY IT HAS BEEN 

07:07:04.579 --> 07:07:06.320
REITERATED IN 2017 THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION MADE THE DECISION

07:07:06.321 --> 07:07:09.972
TO PROVIDE LEGAL DEFENSE OF AID 
TO UKRAINE AFTER THE OBAMA 

07:07:10.174 --> 07:07:12.206
ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO DO SO.
UKRAINE IS RECEIVING ALL THE 

07:07:13.637 --> 07:07:16.271
SECURITY ASSISTANCE. PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY IS UNDERTAKEN  

07:07:16.472 --> 07:07:18.508
SIGNIFICANT ANTICORRUPTION 
EFFORTS INCLUDING ELIMINATING 

07:07:20.124 --> 07:07:25.073
ANY POETRY PARLIAMENTARY 
IMMUNITY. AND, UNDER PRESIDENT 

07:07:25.265 --> 07:07:29.264
ZELENSKY'S LEADERSHIP WE HAVE 
FINALLY SEEN  SOME PROGRESS TO 

07:07:29.478 --> 07:07:31.478
ENDING THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION OF
EASTERN UKRAINE. WHERE DOES THIS

07:07:32.114 --> 07:07:34.114
LEAVE US? AN 

07:07:37.647 --> 07:07:39.431
IMPEACHABLE EVENTS OFFENSE 
SHOULD BE RAPPELLING, 

07:07:39.432 --> 07:07:41.869
OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR, AND 
UNAMBIGUOUS AND NOT SOMETHING TO

07:07:42.070 --> 07:07:44.070
BE RUSHED OR 

07:07:45.922 --> 07:07:47.922
TAKEN LIGHTLY. I HAVE NOT HEARD 
EVIDENCE PROVING THE PRESENT 

07:07:48.034 --> 07:07:50.034
COMMITTED BRIBERY 

07:07:51.407 --> 07:07:53.441
OR EXTORTION. I ALSO REJECT THE 
NOTION THAT HOLDING THIS VIEW 

07:07:53.643 --> 07:07:55.643
MEANS SUPPORTING ALL THE FOREIGN
POLICY CHOICES WE HAVE BEEN 

07:07:55.675 --> 07:07:57.675
HEARING ABOUT OVER THESE LAST 
FEW WEEKS. PARAPHRASE 

07:08:02.118 --> 07:08:05.851
TIM MORRISON, EVERY DAY THE 
NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON UKRAINE

07:08:06.044 --> 07:08:08.044
IS FOCUS ON IMPEACHMENT, NOT THE
CONFLICT, NOT THE ILLEGAL 

07:08:08.074 --> 07:08:10.074
OCCUPATION, NOT THE NEED FOR 
REFORMS IN UKRAINE'S GOVERNMENT 

07:08:11.110 --> 07:08:13.762
AND ECONOMY, IT IS A DAY THAT WE
ARE NOT FOCUSED ON OUR SHARED 

07:08:13.960 --> 07:08:17.011
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST WITH 
KIEV.  I HOPE WE WON'T LET THIS 

07:08:17.211 --> 07:08:21.375
VERY PARTISAN PROCESS KEEP US 
FROM AGREEING ON HOW A FREE AND 

07:08:22.699 --> 07:08:25.535
PROSPEROUS UKRAINE IS IMPORTANT 
TO THE SECURITY OF UKRAINIAN 

07:08:25.736 --> 07:08:29.602
PEOPLE, THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA, AND THE REST OF THE 

07:08:29.802 --> 07:08:32.438
WORLD. MR. CHAIRMAN, BEFORE I 
GET BACK MY TIME, I LIKE TO MAKE

07:08:36.101 --> 07:08:38.137
A STATEMENT, HAD THIS COMMITTEE 
BEEN GIVEN PROPER NOTICE AS OF 

07:08:38.338 --> 07:08:42.604
ACQUIRED BY HOUSE RULE 11 A 
BUSINESS MEETING WAS TO FOLLOW 

07:08:42.804 --> 07:08:46.729
LAST NIGHT HEARING AND HAD MR. 
CONWAY'S POINT OF ORDER BEEN 

07:08:46.917 --> 07:08:48.895
APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZED I WOULD
HAVE VOTED NO ON THE COMMITTEE'S

07:08:48.896 --> 07:08:50.734
FIRST MOTION TO TABLE DURING 
LAST NIGHT'S IMPROMPTU MEETING. 

07:08:50.735 --> 07:08:52.735
I YIELD BACK  THE BALANCE OF MY 

07:08:55.799 --> 07:08:57.799
TIME. 
&gt;&gt; 

07:09:01.016 --> 07:09:05.548
MR. CASTRO? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY 

07:09:05.760 --> 07:09:07.995
TODAY. I WILL SAY, BECAUSE I DO 
NOT THINK IT SHOULD GO 

07:09:08.196 --> 07:09:10.230
UNMENTIONED THE CHARACTERIZATION
A FEW MINUTES AGO BY ONE OF MY 

07:09:10.430 --> 07:09:12.430
PUBLIC AND COLLEAGUES OF THIS 
PROCEEDING, I THINK, WAS VILE, 

07:09:12.476 --> 07:09:17.738
IRRESPONSIBLE, AND DANGEROUS. 
AND, I WANT TO REMIND US WHY WE 

07:09:21.604 --> 07:09:23.433
ARE HERE. BECAUSE, SOMEBODY IN 
THE GOVERNMENT, A WHISTLEBLOWER,

07:09:23.434 --> 07:09:27.290
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO 
GET OTHER PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT 

07:09:27.491 --> 07:09:29.524
THE TENSION THAT THE PRESIDENT 
MAY HAVE COMMITTED A WRONG ACT. 

07:09:29.727 --> 07:09:32.793
WE HAVE NOW HEARD AND SEEN 
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE 

07:09:32.989 --> 07:09:38.262
PRESIDENT, IN FACT, TRADED A 
POLITICAL FAVOR FOR RESOURCES. 

07:09:38.464 --> 07:09:44.350
THE MOST DAMNING WORDS COME FROM
NO ONE ELSE BUT THE PRESIDENT 

07:09:44.550 --> 07:09:46.984
HIMSELF. ON THAT PHONE CALL WITH
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. WHEN HE 

07:09:47.197 --> 07:09:50.853
ASKED FOR A FAVOR, HE MENTIONS 
INVESTIGATIONS, HE MENTIONS THE 

07:09:51.255 --> 07:09:53.255
BIDENS AND 

07:09:54.711 --> 07:09:56.711
BURISMA.  HOWEVER, AS MR. HOLMES

07:09:59.591 --> 07:10:01.412
HAS TESTIFIED, MR. HOLMES ALSO 
OVERHEARD THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING

07:10:01.413 --> 07:10:03.646
TO HIS HAND-PICKED AMBASSADOR, 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, ABOUT 

07:10:04.262 --> 07:10:08.315
INVESTIGATIONS.  MR. HOLMES IS 
ALSO SAID THAT IN THE OFFICE, 

07:10:08.517 --> 07:10:10.547
EVERYBODY KNEW OR MANY PEOPLE 
KNEW AT LEAST, THAT THERE 

07:10:15.550 --> 07:10:19.101
WAS AN INVESTIGATION OR THAT THE
PRESIDENT WANTED AN 

07:10:19.291 --> 07:10:21.119
INVESTIGATION OF THE BIDENS. IN 
ADDITION, OTHER MICK MULVANEY 

07:10:21.120 --> 07:10:23.153
AND RUDY GIULIANI HAD NOT BECOME
FOR THIS COMMITTEE, THEY HAVE 

07:10:23.353 --> 07:10:25.987
BOTH SPOKEN PUBLICLY ON THE 
ISSUE OF INVESTIGATIONS. NICK 

07:10:26.260 --> 07:10:30.056
MULVANEY, THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF 
OF STAFF, THE PERSON WHO USUALLY

07:10:30.256 --> 07:10:33.508
WORKS WITH THE PRESIDENT THE 
MOST DAY IN AND DAY OUT WENT IN 

07:10:33.709 --> 07:10:37.444
FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS 
CORPS AND BASICALLY ADMITTED 

07:10:37.642 --> 07:10:39.798
THAT AN INVESTIGATION HAD 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOLDING 

07:10:44.799 --> 07:10:48.559
THE AID. IN THIS PROCESS WAS 
POLITICIZED, RUDY GIULIANI, THE 

07:10:48.757 --> 07:10:50.757
PRESIDENT'S 

07:10:51.786 --> 07:10:53.204
PERSONAL LAWYER ALSO ESSENTIALLY
ADMITTED THAT THESE 

07:10:53.205 --> 07:10:56.055
INVESTIGATIONS WERE AN ISSUE. HE
SAID THAT HE THINKS HE DID 

07:10:56.456 --> 07:10:59.304
NOTHING WRONG BECAUSE HE WAS 
WORKING AT THE DIRECTION OF 

07:11:04.176 --> 07:11:06.176
THE PRESIDENT. SO, WE HAVE SEEN 
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND HEARD 

07:11:07.029 --> 07:11:08.717
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF 
WRONGDOING BY THE PRESIDENT OF 

07:11:08.718 --> 07:11:13.152
THE UNITED STATES. THIS CONGRESS
WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE UP

07:11:13.340 --> 07:11:15.340
THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE. MY CONCERN 

07:11:15.349 --> 07:11:23.884
TODAY IS ALSO, I FEEL AS THOUGH 
THE WRONGDOING MAY HAVE SPREAD 

07:11:24.084 --> 07:11:26.084
BEYOND THE PRESIDENT AND INTO 
OTHERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

07:11:26.117 --> 07:11:28.755
I WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. BEFORE I 

07:11:28.955 --> 07:11:30.955
DO, I WOULD LIKE 

07:11:33.022 --> 07:11:35.056
THE CHAIRMAN TO ENTER TWO 
ARTICLES INTO THE RECORD, IF I 

07:11:35.279 --> 07:11:38.909
COULD. ONE IS HEADLINED " AFTER 
BOOST FROM PERRY, BACKERS GOT 

07:11:39.111 --> 07:11:42.367
HUGE GAS DEAL IN UKRAINE" AND 
THE OTHER ONE IS TITLED "WALL 

07:11:44.397 --> 07:11:46.227
STREET JOURNAL, FEDERAL 
PROSECUTORS PROBE GIULIANI'S 

07:11:46.228 --> 07:11:48.228
LINKS TO UKRAINIAN 

07:11:50.494 --> 07:11:54.349
ENERGY PRODUCTS." THANK YOU 
CHAIRMAN. MR. HOLMES YOU 

07:11:54.550 --> 07:11:59.435
INDICATED A SECRETARY VERY PERRY
WHEN HE WAS IN UKRAINE, HAD 

07:11:59.636 --> 07:12:02.471
PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH 
UKRAINIANS. BEFORE HE HAD THIS 

07:12:04.507 --> 07:12:06.338
PRIVATE MEETINGS, IN A MEETING 
WITH OTHERS, INCLUDING YOURSELF 

07:12:06.339 --> 07:12:10.593
I BELIEVE, HE HAD PRESENTED A 
LIST OF AMERICAN ADVISORS FOR 

07:12:10.808 --> 07:12:15.751
THE UKRAINE ENERGY SECTOR. DO 
YOU KNOW WHO WAS ON THAT LIST? 

07:12:17.914 --> 07:12:21.364
&gt;&gt; SIR, I DO NOT SEE THE NAMES 
ON THE LIST MYSELF. 

07:12:21.365 --> 07:12:26.235
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW IF ALEX CRANBURY 
AND MICHAEL BLASER WERE ON THAT 

07:12:26.526 --> 07:12:27.922
LIST? 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SINCE HEARD THAT 

07:12:27.923 --> 07:12:33.955
MICHAEL BLASER IS ON THE LIST. 
&gt;&gt; BEFORE SECRETARY PERRY DID 

07:12:34.155 --> 07:12:37.821
THIS, WE ALSO HEARD TESTIMONY 
BEFORE THAT AMBASSADOR SONLAND 

07:12:38.021 --> 07:12:42.289
ALSO HAD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH 
SOMEBODY? HOW UNUSUAL WE WAS A 

07:12:42.489 --> 07:12:46.758
BEFORE THESE GUYS SHOWED UP FOR 
FOLKS, DIPLOMATS ARE TO SPEAK, 

07:12:46.959 --> 07:12:49.796
OR U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, 
WHO HAVE PRIVATE MEETINGS WHERE 

07:12:50.613 --> 07:12:52.613
THEY INSIST THAT NOBODY ELSE BE 
IN 

07:12:55.084 --> 07:12:57.084
THE ROOM? 
&gt;&gt; VERY RARE, ALMOST NEVER. 

07:13:01.518 --> 07:13:07.680
&gt;&gt; OKAY. AND, I WANT TO ASK YOU,
ALSO. ABOUT THE 

07:13:12.690 --> 07:13:15.401
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT PRECEDENT 
THAT WE SET. I KNOW YOUR BOTH 

07:13:15.602 --> 07:13:17.636
HERE AS FACT WITNESSES WE ARE 
ALSO PUBLIC SERVANTS IS PROBABLY

07:13:17.837 --> 07:13:20.469
SERPENTS FOR THIS COUNTRY. WHAT 
THIS WITH THAT, SETTING ASIDE A 

07:13:20.671 --> 07:13:23.763
LITTLE TROUBLE. IF THE CONGERS 
ALLOWS A PRESIDENT OF UNITED 

07:13:23.956 --> 07:13:25.956
STATES NOW OR EVER 

07:13:27.990 --> 07:13:30.013
TO ASK A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, 
HEAD OF STATE TO INVESTIGATE A 

07:13:30.436 --> 07:13:36.516
POLITICAL RIVAL WHAT PRECEDENT 
DOES THAT SET FOR AMERICAN 

07:13:36.717 --> 07:13:39.168
DIPLOMACY, FOR THE SAFETY OF 
AMERICANS OVERSEAS, AND FOR THE 

07:13:39.367 --> 07:13:45.055
FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A VERY BAD PRECEDENT.

07:13:45.254 --> 07:13:49.520
&gt;&gt; VERY BAD PRECEDENT, AND IF 
THAT WERE THE CASE, I WOULD 

07:13:49.721 --> 07:13:53.577
RAISE OBJECTION. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU BOTH. 

07:13:53.578 --> 07:13:58.663
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU CHAIR, I WANT TO 
RETURN THE FAVOR AND YIELD TO MY

07:13:58.864 --> 07:14:00.864
COLLEAGUE, 

07:14:03.874 --> 07:14:08.404
CONGRESSMAN CONAWAY. 
&gt;&gt; DR. , I DON'T THINK THERE ARE

07:14:08.618 --> 07:14:10.639
A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT ONE OF 
PUTIN'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVES IN 

07:14:10.853 --> 07:14:13.087
THE UNITED STATES  IS TO FERMENT
UNREST WITHIN OUR COUNTRY, TO 

07:14:13.288 --> 07:14:15.288
CAUSE US 

07:14:17.556 --> 07:14:19.578
TO HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN OUR 
ELECTIONS AND THOSE TYPES OF 

07:14:19.799 --> 07:14:21.826
THINGS. THERE IS TENSION THOUGH.
CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS IS THE 

07:14:22.017 --> 07:14:26.696
WAY WE SHOULD. PLAYING INTO 
PUTIN'S HANDS. AS AN EXAMPLE, 

07:14:26.896 --> 07:14:28.896
WHILE 

07:14:30.749 --> 07:14:32.984
I DISAGREE WITH WHAT WE ARE 
DOING HERE, IT IS UNDER OUR 

07:14:33.184 --> 07:14:35.217
CONSTITUTION AND MY COLLEAGUES 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE 

07:14:35.432 --> 07:14:37.063
BELIEVE THEY ARE FUNCTIONING 
UNDERNEATH THE CONSTITUTION. 

07:14:37.064 --> 07:14:39.486
THIS ISSUE IS VERY DIVISIVE 
WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. CONTINUING 

07:14:39.687 --> 07:14:41.687
TO PUSH 

07:14:43.551 --> 07:14:45.551
THAT WAY I THINK IT PLAYS INTO 
PUTIN'S HANDS INDIFFERENTLY. 

07:14:45.583 --> 07:14:50.253
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT. 
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE 

07:14:50.454 --> 07:14:53.098
CAN DO AS INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD
NOT PLAY INTO HIS HANDS AND ONE 

07:14:53.288 --> 07:14:57.359
WOULD BE THE LOSER IN THE 2016 
ELECTION HAS FOR THREE YEARS 

07:14:57.559 --> 07:14:59.559
CONTINUED TO ARGUE THAT BECAUSE 
SHE WON THE 

07:15:03.461 --> 07:15:05.503
POPULAR VOTE, THAT SHE AND HER 
FRIENDS WON THE POPULAR VOTE, 

07:15:05.694 --> 07:15:07.512
SOMEHOW THE ELECTION WAS 
INAPPROPRIATE AND WE SHOULD NOT 

07:15:07.513 --> 07:15:11.176
TRUST IT. THAT THE TWHIRL 
COLLEGE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE 

07:15:11.378 --> 07:15:17.224
VICTORY SHOULDN'T BE 
ACKNOWLEDGED. DOES THAT HELP YOU

07:15:18.080 --> 07:15:20.113
TO PUTIN THAT OUR ELECTIONS ARE 
SOMEHOW RIGGED, AND SHOULD BE 

07:15:20.314 --> 07:15:21.331
TRUSTED? 
&gt;&gt; YES, IT DOES. 

07:15:21.332 --> 07:15:29.250
&gt;&gt; SO THE, WOULD YOU AGREE WITH 
ME THAT THE IS RT PUTIN'S 

07:15:29.450 --> 07:15:32.902
PROPAGANDA MACHINE IN THE U.S.? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD. 

07:15:32.903 --> 07:15:36.768
&gt;&gt; IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE RT\ TO
AFFECT PUBLIC POLICY ON THE 

07:15:36.968 --> 07:15:39.401
NATION AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THERE 
BE A LONG SERIES OF 

07:15:39.616 --> 07:15:41.616
ADVERTISEMENTS OR ON GOINGS 

07:15:44.487 --> 07:15:46.728
ON RT GOING AGAINST FRACKING, 
SAYING IT IS BAD AND TRYING TO 

07:15:46.922 --> 07:15:51.189
AFFECT PUBLIC POLICY IN THE 
UNITED STATES, IS THAT 

07:15:51.390 --> 07:15:53.390
APPROPRIATE USE OR SHOULD 
AMERICANS BE PAYING ATTENTION TO

07:15:54.240 --> 07:15:55.964
THAT? 
&gt;&gt; IN THE TENT THAT AMERICANS 

07:15:55.965 --> 07:16:00.741
SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO 
THE RT, ANOTHER WAY TO PROPAGATE

07:16:00.942 --> 07:16:02.942
THIS INFORMATION I WASN'T QUITE 
SURE WHAT YOU 

07:16:05.410 --> 07:16:06.656
MEANT. 
&gt;&gt; FRACKING IS A CONTROVERSIAL 

07:16:06.657 --> 07:16:10.080
ISSUE WITH OUR NATION IF WE DID 
AWAY WITH TRACKING THE UNITED 

07:16:10.281 --> 07:16:12.314
STATES WOULD NOT BE IN A 
POSITION TODAY TO DOMINATE OIL 

07:16:12.515 --> 07:16:14.345
PRODUCTION WITHIN THE WORLD AND 
WILL PLAY INTO STRENGTHENING 

07:16:14.346 --> 07:16:18.216
PUTIN'S HANDS WITH RESPECT. IT 
IS CORRECT AND I'D LIKE TO POINT

07:16:18.408 --> 07:16:23.083
OUT THAT IN 2011, NOVEMBER 2011 
I SAT NEXT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 

07:16:23.282 --> 07:16:25.316
AFTER A CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE 
MADE PRECISELY THAT POINT. IT 

07:16:25.517 --> 07:16:29.371
WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DONE 
SO TO A GROUP OF AMERICAN 

07:16:29.572 --> 07:16:31.819
JOURNALISTS AND EXPERTS WHO WERE
BROUGHT TO SOMETHING CALLED THE 

07:16:35.260 --> 07:16:37.748
DISCUSSION CLUB. WE STARTED IN 
2011 MAKING IT CLEAR THAT HE SAW

07:16:37.936 --> 07:16:39.936
AMERICAN FRACKING AS A 

07:16:41.560 --> 07:16:43.391
GREAT THREAT TO RUSSIAN 
INTEREST, WHO WERE AWESTRUCK BY 

07:16:43.392 --> 07:16:45.425
HOW MUCH HE STRESSED THIS ISSUE.
SINCE 2011 AND SINCE OUR 

07:16:46.239 --> 07:16:50.707
PARTICULAR JUNCTION PUTIN HAS 
MADE A BIG DEAL. 

07:16:50.708 --> 07:16:52.730
&gt;&gt; SO AMERICANS PAY ATTENTION TO
RT AND ARE MISDIAGNOSED OR 

07:16:52.931 --> 07:16:55.579
MISSED BY WHATEVER PROPAGANDA HE
HAS SET 

07:16:59.637 --> 07:17:01.870
OUT. ARE. MR. HOLMES IN YOUR 
ROLE YOU ARE PRIVILEGED TO AN 

07:17:02.073 --> 07:17:05.939
AWFUL LOT OF STUFF. OFFICIAL 
THINGS. THINGS THAT ARE BEST 

07:17:06.140 --> 07:17:09.190
KEPT BETWEEN YOU AND THE 
OFFICIAL FOLKS THAT YOU DEAL 

07:17:09.391 --> 07:17:11.231
WITH IS THERE AN EXPECTATION 
AMONG THE PRINCIPLES YOU 

07:17:11.232 --> 07:17:13.860
REPRESENT THAT YOU WILL EXERCISE
SOME DISCRETION IN WHAT YOU 

07:17:14.060 --> 07:17:16.295
SHARE WITH OTHERS ABOUT WHAT 
GOES ON? 

07:17:16.296 --> 07:17:20.617
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR DEPOSITION, YOU MADE,

07:17:20.806 --> 07:17:25.841
WELL, FIRST OFF, WE HAD A HARD 
TIME PINNING DOWN THE NUMBER OF 

07:17:26.041 --> 07:17:27.874
PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY HAD THIS 
CONVERSATION WITH ABOUT THE 

07:17:27.875 --> 07:17:30.771
CONVERSATION THAT YOU OVERHEARD.
THE AMBASSADOR HAD NO 

07:17:30.961 --> 07:17:32.961
EXPECTATION 

07:17:35.385 --> 07:17:37.418
OF PRIVACY. LUSTING AROUND, WHAT
IS DONE IS DONE BUT CANNOT 

07:17:37.617 --> 07:17:39.653
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU 
SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH. I 

07:17:39.854 --> 07:17:41.692
WOULD ARGUE THAT INFORMATION IS 
UNFLATTERING TO THE PRESIDENT, 

07:17:41.693 --> 07:17:47.372
UNFLATTERING TO THE AMBASSADOR. 
AND, THAT, YOUR DISCRETION IS AT

07:17:47.986 --> 07:17:50.421
ODDS HERE. YOUR TESTIMONY, YOUR 

07:17:55.432 --> 07:17:59.158
DEPOSITION SAID WITH FOLKS THAT 
YOU THOUGHT WOULD FIND IT 

07:17:59.359 --> 07:18:01.359
INTERESTING. I'D ARGUE THAT 
EVERYBODY IN THE BACK ROW WOULD 

07:18:01.421 --> 07:18:03.421
FIND IT INTERESTING BUT I DON'T 
KNOW THAT IS NECESSARILY 

07:18:03.425 --> 07:18:05.459
CRITERIA. ON A GOING FORWARD 
BASIS CAN YOU ARTICULATE IN THE 

07:18:05.660 --> 07:18:07.660
FUTURE WHEN YOU'RE PRIVILEGED TO
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD

07:18:07.681 --> 07:18:09.918
BE EMBARRASSING TO THE PRINCIPAL
THAT IF IT IS 

07:18:14.921 --> 07:18:18.242
OFFICIAL YOU SAY TO THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT IS FINE BUT 

07:18:18.457 --> 07:18:20.484
FOLKS OUTSIDE THE EMBASSY OR 
EVEN WITHIN THE EMBASSY TO WHO 

07:18:20.692 --> 07:18:23.333
DO NOT HAVE A NEED TO KNOW YOU 
WOULD NOT REGALE THEM WITH YOUR 

07:18:23.529 --> 07:18:25.628
ACCOUNTING OF THOSE INSTANCES? 
&gt;&gt; SIR I THINK IT WAS GORDON 

07:18:25.817 --> 07:18:27.598
SONDLAND WHO SHOWED INDISCRETION
BY HAVING A CONVERSATION THE 

07:18:27.599 --> 07:18:28.198
DUST 
&gt;&gt; WELL. 

07:18:28.199 --> 07:18:30.199
&gt;&gt; 

07:18:31.457 --> 07:18:33.457
SECOND THING. 
&gt;&gt; LET ME CLARIFY 

07:18:36.938 --> 07:18:39.376
THE QUESTION. IT IS MY QUESTION 
YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT AND I GET 

07:18:39.574 --> 07:18:42.010
TO CLARIFY MY QUESTION TO GET 
THE ANSWER AND I'M HOPEFUL I GET

07:18:42.211 --> 07:18:44.863
IN A FEW MORE SECONDS BECAUSE OF
THE INTERRUPTION FROM THE 

07:18:45.064 --> 07:18:48.745
CHAIRMAN. HIS PATIENTS WAS GOING
THIN I'M WORKING HARD NOT TO 

07:18:48.937 --> 07:18:50.956
IRRITATE HIM AGAIN BUT IT IS 
HAPPENING AGAIN. THE QUESTION IS

07:18:51.155 --> 07:18:54.205
OF YOUR DISCRETION. GORDON 
HOLMES I MEAN GORDON SONDLAND 

07:18:54.406 --> 07:18:58.473
DID NOT EXPECT PRIVACY AND GOT 
THAT. BUT, YOU ARE GOING TO BE 

07:19:00.697 --> 07:19:03.132
IN ROOMS, HAVE BEEN IN ROOMS 17 
YEARS WHERE PEOPLE TRUST THAT 

07:19:03.347 --> 07:19:05.347
WHATEVER WENT ON IN THAT ROOM 

07:19:07.399 --> 07:19:09.847
THAT THEY THAT YOU KEPT IN THE 
OFFICIAL CHANNELS AND YOU DO NOT

07:19:10.048 --> 07:19:12.482
SHARE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. I
AM ASKING YOU TO ARGUE ON YOUR 

07:19:12.681 --> 07:19:16.135
OWN BEHALF THAT INTERESTING IS 
NOT SOME SORT OF A CRITERIA THAT

07:19:16.335 --> 07:19:19.587
YOU WOULD USE WHEN YOU SHARE 
INFORMATION FOR MEETINGS? SIMPLE

07:19:19.802 --> 07:19:22.235
AND STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; SIR I SHARE THE INFORMATION 

07:19:22.435 --> 07:19:24.435
THAT 

07:19:27.450 --> 07:19:30.961
I SHARED WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
WHO NEEDED TO KNOW IT. I DID NOT

07:19:31.176 --> 07:19:32.994
SHARE ANY INFORMATION THAT 
PEOPLE DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW. 

07:19:32.995 --> 07:19:35.631
&gt;&gt; BUT DID YOU DO USE THE WORD 
INTERESTING. 

07:19:35.632 --> 07:19:37.878
&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY WAS INTERESTING AND
I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT WHAT 

07:19:38.079 --> 07:19:42.134
I BROUGHT BEFORE THIS PROCESS I 
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. I HAVE

07:19:44.167 --> 07:19:46.802
COME HERE AS YOU SUBPOENAED ME 
TO SHARE WHAT I KNOW AND I HAVE 

07:19:47.017 --> 07:19:48.839
DONE THAT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE CUT OFF WHEN YOU'RE 

07:19:48.840 --> 07:19:50.840
TALKING 

07:19:52.346 --> 07:19:54.725
ABOUT MR. SONLAND'S 
INDISCRETION, DID YOU WANT TO 

07:19:54.939 --> 07:19:56.939
FINISH THAT ANSWER? 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN THAT IS 

07:19:59.809 --> 07:20:01.643
PATENTLY UNFAIR. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT FAIR TO INTERRUPT 

07:20:01.644 --> 07:20:03.300
THE WITNESSES. 
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE CERTAINLY WILLING

07:20:03.301 --> 07:20:05.696
TO INTERRUPT ME DURING MY FIVE 
MINUTES. YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON 

07:20:05.897 --> 07:20:09.364
ON THE DAIS WAS UNLIMITED TIME. 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WAS ABUSE 

07:20:09.562 --> 07:20:11.184
THAT POWER AND YOU CONTINUE TO 
DO THAT. 

07:20:11.185 --> 07:20:14.231
&gt;&gt; THE GENTLEMAN WILL CEASE. WE 
WILL ALLOW THE WITNESS TO ANSWER

07:20:14.435 --> 07:20:17.681
THE QUESTION IF EVEN IF THOSE 
ASKING THE QUESTION DO NOT WANT 

07:20:17.881 --> 07:20:21.750
TO HEAR THE ANSWER. 
&gt;&gt; DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU AS 

07:20:21.956 --> 07:20:23.437
WELL? 
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION HAS BEEN MADE 

07:20:23.438 --> 07:20:25.438
ABOUT 

07:20:27.437 --> 07:20:29.054
REGULAR IRREGULAR FOREIGN 
CHANNELS MY READING OF HISTORY 

07:20:29.055 --> 07:20:32.105
IS THAT AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE
ON OCCASIONS USED IN REGULAR 

07:20:32.305 --> 07:20:33.387
CHANNELS, WOULD YOU GENERALLY 
AGREE? 

07:20:33.388 --> 07:20:35.558
&gt;&gt; YES SIR. 
&gt;&gt; MY READING OF HISTORY IS THAT

07:20:38.194 --> 07:20:40.026
GENERALLY SPEAKING, HOWEVER 
THOSE EVEN GET A CHANNELS HAVE 

07:20:40.027 --> 07:20:42.061
BEEN CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH THE
REGULAR ONES, OR AT LEAST IN 

07:20:42.262 --> 07:20:46.555
FURTHERANCE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN 
POLICY AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

07:20:46.745 --> 07:20:48.561
INTEREST, WOULD YOU AGREE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT HIS RIGHTS ARE. 

07:20:48.562 --> 07:20:50.562
&gt;&gt; DEEPLY THAT MR. JULIANNE 
VIANI 

07:20:53.641 --> 07:20:55.059
EFFORTS RECORDED GIULIANI'S 
EFFORTS RECORDED WITH THE 

07:20:55.060 --> 07:20:56.506
AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE? 
&gt;&gt; KNOW THEY WILL. 

07:20:56.507 --> 07:20:58.913
&gt;&gt; WERE THE IN FURTHERANCE OF 
THE AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY 

07:20:59.128 --> 07:21:01.128
ISSUANCE UNDERSTOOD? 
&gt;&gt; 

07:21:02.981 --> 07:21:04.399
NO SIR. 
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES, IF LEFT 

07:21:04.400 --> 07:21:06.917
UNCHECKED, DO YOU THINK THAT 
RUSSIA WOULD EITHER BY MEANS OF 

07:21:08.052 --> 07:21:10.085
FORCE OR OTHER MALIGNED MEANS 

07:21:15.088 --> 07:21:19.021
SUBJUGATE UKRAINE, ATTEMPT TO 
RENDER IT A QUITE STATE AND 

07:21:19.236 --> 07:21:22.074
OCCUPIED? 
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY SIR. IT HAS BEEN 

07:21:22.274 --> 07:21:24.715
SAID WITHOUT UKRAINE RUSSIA IS 
JUST A COUNTRY BUT WITH IT IT IS

07:21:24.923 --> 07:21:26.923
AN EMPIRE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE 

07:21:27.758 --> 07:21:31.826
BEEN TREATING TREATED TO A 
GATLING GUN FIRE OF MYTH 

07:21:32.027 --> 07:21:35.077
PROPAGATION OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS AND IT REMINDS ME OF 

07:21:37.309 --> 07:21:41.978
THAT OLD EXPRESSION ABOUT THE 
BIG LIE IF YOU TELL IT OFTEN 

07:21:42.177 --> 07:21:44.625
ENOUGH AND KEEP REPEATING IT 
THAT PEOPLE WILL COME TO BELIEVE

07:21:44.826 --> 07:21:49.540
IT. I THINK WE HAVE BEEN 
SUBJECTED TO SOME OF THAT. HERE 

07:21:49.729 --> 07:21:52.545
IS A SAMPLE. THE PRESIDENT 
DIDN'T SOLICIT CAMPAIGN 

07:21:52.746 --> 07:21:56.602
ASSISTANCE FROM UKRAINE IN A 
CLEAR VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. 

07:21:56.806 --> 07:21:58.806
YES 

07:21:59.853 --> 07:22:03.716
HE DID. THE PRESIDENT DID NOT 
WITHHOLD VITAL MILITARY 

07:22:03.917 --> 07:22:08.586
ASSISTANCE AND FURTHERANCE OF A 
SUBJECTIVE TO OBTAIN THAT 

07:22:08.786 --> 07:22:10.786
ASSISTANCE. YES, 

07:22:12.036 --> 07:22:15.704
HE DID. RUDY GIULIANI WAS ACTING
JUST ON HIS OWN, NOT AS A ROGUE.

07:22:15.904 --> 07:22:21.390
NO HE WASN'T. THAT ALL OF THIS 
IS BUSINESS AS USUAL. THIS 

07:22:21.589 --> 07:22:23.589
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND STEMS 
FROM A 

07:22:26.059 --> 07:22:29.109
PRINCIPLED INTEREST. NO IT 
ISN'T. AND NO IT WASN'T. AND, 

07:22:29.310 --> 07:22:33.777
THAT IT IS OKAY TO ATTACK 
PATRIOTIC DIPLOMATS AND PUBLIC 

07:22:33.977 --> 07:22:37.228
SERVICE IF THEY STAND IN YOUR 
WAY AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO 

07:22:38.647 --> 07:22:45.151
SPEAK UP. NO, IT ISN'T. THOSE 
ARE JUST SOME OF THE BIG LIES. 

07:22:45.351 --> 07:22:50.444
BUT HERE IS THE BIG TRUTH, THE 
PRESIDENT DID IT. HE 

07:22:53.694 --> 07:22:55.694
DID IT. WE ALL JUST CAME FROM 
THE 

07:23:00.201 --> 07:23:02.635
FLOOR. AND, IT IS A MAJESTIC 
CHAMBER AND IN THE FRONT OF THE 

07:23:02.836 --> 07:23:05.908
CHAMBER THERE ARE ONLY TWO 
PORTRAITS. ON THE LEFT LOOKING 

07:23:06.098 --> 07:23:07.515
FORWARD IS MY FAVORITE 
PRESIDENT, GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

07:23:07.516 --> 07:23:12.585
AND ON THE RIGHT IS THE MARQUIS 
DE LAFAYETTE. WHO CAME TO THIS 

07:23:12.805 --> 07:23:17.467
COUNTRY TO HELP US STAND UP OUR 
FLEDGLING DEMOCRACY. HERE IS 

07:23:17.668 --> 07:23:22.751
ANOTHER BIG TRUTH. WITHOUT HIS 
HELP, WE PROBABLY NEVER WOULD'VE

07:23:22.952 --> 07:23:27.004
GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND. AND, THAT
ASSISTANCE TO MANY OTHER 

07:23:27.218 --> 07:23:30.869
COUNTRIES, WHO ARE HELPING US 
CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER 

07:23:31.070 --> 07:23:33.504
BEEN CREATED BEFORE, IT WAS AN 

07:23:36.757 --> 07:23:38.757
AUDACIOUS IDEA. THIS NOTION OF A
DEMOCRACY OF SELF-GOVERNANCE, 

07:23:42.446 --> 07:23:45.496
OF FREEDOMS SPEECH AND PRESS AND
RELIGION AND EXPRESSION. AND 

07:23:45.697 --> 07:23:49.579
ASSEMBLY. MOST OF ALL, THAT IT 
WOULD BE ROOTED IN THE PREMISE 

07:23:49.770 --> 07:23:56.265
OF THE RULE OF LAW. NOT MONARCHS
NOT MILITARY STRONGMEN, BUT THE 

07:23:56.466 --> 07:23:58.466
RULE 

07:23:59.506 --> 07:24:03.171
OF LAW OTHERS HELPED US TO GET 
HERE. AND, WE WOULD NOT BE HERE 

07:24:03.773 --> 07:24:08.243
WITHOUT THEM. AND FRANKLY, I 
FEEL LIKE WE ARE ALMOST IN A 

07:24:08.444 --> 07:24:12.341
LITTLE BIT OF A PAY IT FORWARD 
MOMENT. SO, WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

07:24:12.534 --> 07:24:20.631
DID IT, HE PUT AT RISK THE 
SECURITY OF UKRAINE. A STRATEGIC

07:24:20.832 --> 07:24:25.113
ALLY AND A NASCENT DEMOCRACY 
WITH THEIR MASSES YEARNING 

07:24:30.103 --> 07:24:33.460
TO BREATHE FREE. SIX YEARS AGO 
THIS DAY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 

07:24:33.652 --> 07:24:35.876
SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO SIGN 
THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT WITH

07:24:36.077 --> 07:24:38.109
EUROPEAN UNION, ROSE UP AND TOOK
TO THE STREETS. BECAUSE THEY 

07:24:38.310 --> 07:24:42.565
WANTED, FRANKLY, WHAT WE HAVE 
AND, WHEN THE PRESIDENT DID IT, 

07:24:42.840 --> 07:24:51.539
HE PUT OUR OWN NATIONAL SECURITY
AT RISK. BUT, WHAT HE DID, MOST 

07:24:51.735 --> 07:24:56.385
IMPORTANTLY, WAS PUT AT RISK 
THAT IDEA THAT MAKES US 

07:24:56.585 --> 07:24:59.840
EXCEPTIONAL. BECAUSE I DO 
BELIEVE AMERICA IS TRULY 

07:25:00.041 --> 07:25:04.309
EXCEPTIONAL. WE ARE A COUNTRY 
ROOTED IN SOMETHING THAT NO ONE 

07:25:04.507 --> 07:25:07.358
HAS EVER TRIED BEFORE. RULE OF 
LAW. HE PUT THAT 

07:25:10.407 --> 07:25:16.960
AT RISK. WHEN HE DID WHAT HE 
DID. THE PRESIDENT DID IT. AND 

07:25:17.147 --> 07:25:22.182
THE ONLY QUESTION THAT REMAINS 
IS WHAT WILL WE DO? I YELLED 

07:25:22.383 --> 07:25:26.927
BACK MR. CHAIRMAN. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. 

07:25:29.084 --> 07:25:31.732
DURING A DEPOSITION, I ASKED YOU
WHAT WAS CHRISTOPHER 

07:25:36.744 --> 07:25:38.744
STEELE DOSSIER IRREVOCABLE? DO 
YOU REMEMBER THE ANSWER 

07:25:41.682 --> 07:25:44.317
YOU GAVE? AND YOU ALSO SET A 
COUPLE PAGES LATER IN THE 

07:25:44.518 --> 07:25:46.518
DEPOSITION IN THE TRANSCRIPT 
THAT I HAVE OF YOUR DEPOSITION 

07:25:46.558 --> 07:25:50.013
THAT YOU THOUGHT HE GOT PLAYED, 
IS THAT FAIR? 

07:25:50.014 --> 07:25:52.674
&gt;&gt; THAT IS FAIR, 

07:25:55.700 --> 07:25:57.579
YES. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS STRUCK BY A NUMBER OF 

07:25:57.580 --> 07:25:59.761
THINGS YOU SAID, A NUMBER OF 
THINGS WERE RIGHT ON THE TARGET,

07:25:59.961 --> 07:26:02.019
ONE WAS ON PAGE 7. PRESIDENT 
PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN SECURITY 

07:26:02.597 --> 07:26:05.053
SERVICES WEAPONIZED OUR OWN 
POLITICAL OPPOSITION RESEARCH. 

07:26:05.245 --> 07:26:11.331
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED IN 2016. EXACTLY WHAT 

07:26:11.545 --> 07:26:13.545
HAPPENED. YOU CALLED IT, YOU 
KNEW IT, YOU SAW IT. 

07:26:17.434 --> 07:26:20.273
THE DMP HIRED FUSION GPS, WHO 
HIRED CHRISTOPHER STEELE, WHO 

07:26:20.473 --> 07:26:24.539
TALKED TO RUSSIANS, WHO GAVE A 
BUNCH OF DIRT, BUT OF NATIONAL 

07:26:25.556 --> 07:26:27.556
ENQUIRER GARBAGE THAT HE 
COMPILED 

07:26:31.380 --> 07:26:35.299
ANY DOSSIER AND ARE FBI USED IT.
THEY USED IT AS A PART OF THEIR 

07:26:35.513 --> 07:26:39.167
INVESTIGATION THAT THEY OPENED 
IN JULY 2016 WHERE THEY SPIED ON

07:26:39.367 --> 07:26:41.367
TWO AMERICAN ASSISTANCE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 

07:26:45.052 --> 07:26:46.692
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. THAT HAS 
PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED IN 

07:26:46.693 --> 07:26:48.693
AMERICAN HISTORY AND EXACTLY 
WHAT DR. HILL TALKED ABOUT IS 

07:26:48.716 --> 07:26:51.954
WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. EXACTLY 
WHAT SHE TALKED ABOUT. FOR 

07:26:55.823 --> 07:26:58.659
10 MONTHS THE TEAM DID AN 
INVESTIGATION. AFTER 10 MONTHS 

07:26:58.874 --> 07:27:05.160
THEY HAD NOTHING. BECAUSE WE 
DEPOSED OF HIM AND HE TOLD US, 

07:27:05.375 --> 07:27:08.011
AFTER 10 MONTHS WE DID NOT HAVE 
A SAYING, THAT IS THE MATTER. IT

07:27:08.613 --> 07:27:10.613
DIDN'T MATTER. WE GOT THE 

07:27:12.482 --> 07:27:14.915
MUELLER INVESTIGATION. $20 
MILLION, 19 LAWYERS, 500 

07:27:18.366 --> 07:27:20.402
SEARCH WARRANTS, AND THEY CAME 
BACK THIS SPRING AND WHAT THEY 

07:27:21.004 --> 07:27:25.684
TELL US? NO COLLUSION, NO 
CONSPIRACY, NO COORDINATION. THE

07:27:25.885 --> 07:27:27.885
GUYS ON THE OTHER SIDE DON'T 
CARE. THEY 

07:27:31.157 --> 07:27:33.404
DON'T CARE. THEY ARE DOING WHAT 
DR. HILL SAID A NUMBER OF 

07:27:33.606 --> 07:27:35.425
IMPORTANT THINGS IN HER OPENING 
STATEMENT. THEY ARE DOING 

07:27:35.426 --> 07:27:37.426
EXACTLY WHAT DR. HILL 

07:27:39.291 --> 07:27:42.551
TALKED ABOUT. THE IMPACT OF A 
SUCCESSFUL 26 IN RUSSIAN 

07:27:42.825 --> 07:27:44.825
CAMPAIGN REMAINS EVIDENT TODAY, 
OUR NATION IS BEING TORN APART. 

07:27:46.809 --> 07:27:48.809
TORN APART. I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT

07:27:53.036 --> 07:27:55.264
THIS DIVIDED. IT IS NOT HEALTHY 
FOR OUR CULTURE, OUR COUNTRY, 

07:27:55.472 --> 07:27:57.820
NOT HEALTHY FOR OUR NATION BUT 
THAT IS WHAT THESE GUYS ARE 

07:27:58.010 --> 07:27:59.538
DOING. NO CONSPIRACY, NO 
COERCION, NO COLLUSION, THEY 

07:27:59.539 --> 07:28:04.719
DON'T CARE. NOW THIS. THIS WHOLE
IMPEACHMENT THING, AS THE 

07:28:04.913 --> 07:28:06.913
WITNESS SAID YESTERDAY, WITNESS 

07:28:09.354 --> 07:28:11.589
SAID YESTERDAY,  WITHOUT AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM ZELENSKY  

07:28:11.788 --> 07:28:15.655
ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION, THEY 
WEREN'T GOING TO GET A CALL WITH

07:28:16.056 --> 07:28:18.091
THE PRESIDENT, THEY WEREN'T 
GOING TO GET AID FROM THE UNITED

07:28:18.291 --> 07:28:20.291
STATES. GUESS 

07:28:22.761 --> 07:28:24.761
WHAT? UKRAINE GOT THE CALL, THEY
GOT 

07:28:27.630 --> 07:28:29.863
THE MEETING, AND THEY GOT THE 
MONEY, AND IT WAS NEVER AN 

07:28:30.077 --> 07:28:34.132
ANNOUNCEMENT OF ANY TYPE OF 
INVESTIGATION. BUT THEY DON'T 

07:28:34.331 --> 07:28:36.766
CARE. THEY WILL MOVE FORWARD, 
THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF 

07:28:36.980 --> 07:28:41.449
REPORT. I ASSUME SOMETHING TO 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THE 

07:28:41.672 --> 07:28:43.882
PROCESS WILL GO FORWARD AND 
THERE WILL BE A TRIAL IN THE 

07:28:44.083 --> 07:28:48.150
SENATE ALL BASED ON SOME 
ANONYMOUS WHISTLEBLOWER WHO CAME

07:28:48.427 --> 07:28:50.203
FORWARD WITH NO FIRSTHAND 
KNOWLEDGE, WHO IS BIASED AGAINST

07:28:50.204 --> 07:28:53.834
THE PRESIDENT, WHO WORKED WITH 
JOE BIDEN. NOW, ALL THIS. NOW 

07:28:58.514 --> 07:29:03.581
ALL THIS. THIS IS, DR. HILL IS 
RIGHT, SHE SAID IT. WE HAVE GOT 

07:29:03.783 --> 07:29:06.432
TO STOP THIS, BUT THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO AND THEY'RE DOING IT 11

07:29:06.632 --> 07:29:08.941
A HALF MONTHS BEFORE THE NEXT 
ELECTION AND I THINK THE MOST 

07:29:09.134 --> 07:29:11.134
TELLING THING, WITH THE SPEAKER 
OF THE HOUSE SAID SUNDAY. THIS 

07:29:13.336 --> 07:29:19.840
IS SCARY. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
SET ON SUNDAY, SUNDAY MORNING TV

07:29:20.112 --> 07:29:22.112
SHOW, SHE SAID THE PRESIDENT IS 

07:29:26.067 --> 07:29:28.980
AN IMPOSTER. I GUY THAT 63 
MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR, THAT 

07:29:29.183 --> 07:29:31.255
WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
LANDSLIDE, THEY CALLED THE 

07:29:31.448 --> 07:29:33.448
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

07:29:37.248 --> 07:29:40.555
AN IMPOSTER. IT IS SAD WITH THE 
COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH. I WISH

07:29:40.827 --> 07:29:42.590
YOU WOULD STOP, BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T THING IT 

07:29:42.591 --> 07:29:44.591
IS. MR. CHAIRMAN I YIELD 

07:29:46.643 --> 07:29:48.643
BACK.  
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO USE MY TIME TO 

07:29:48.676 --> 07:29:50.676
SPEAK DIRECTLY TO MY COLLEAGUES 
AND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

07:29:51.110 --> 07:29:53.560
TODAY'S WITNESSES, AND THE ONES 
WE HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO HAVE 

07:29:53.761 --> 07:29:57.214
THE FOR THE COMMITTEE OVER THE 
LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE PROVIDED AN 

07:29:57.415 --> 07:30:01.064
INVALUABLE SERVICE TO OUR 
COUNTRY. NOT JUST ALL YOUR 

07:30:01.280 --> 07:30:03.713
CAREERS, AND HAVING THE COURAGE,
AND THE PATRIOTISM TO SHARE YOUR

07:30:03.914 --> 07:30:07.981
FAX WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND, YOU DO SO AT CONSIDERABLE 

07:30:08.185 --> 07:30:13.508
RISK TO YOURSELVES BUT, YOU HAVE
CLEARLY STEPPED FORWARD FOR THE 

07:30:13.700 --> 07:30:18.140
SIMPLE FACT THAT YOU BELIEVE IT 
IS YOUR DUTY. AND, AND ALL YOUR 

07:30:18.337 --> 07:30:20.774
TESTIMONY, IT REAFFIRMS A VERY 
CENTRAL FACT. PRESIDENT TRUMP 

07:30:20.975 --> 07:30:24.631
CONDITIONED OUR FOREIGN POLICY 
AND NATIONAL SECURITY ON GETTING

07:30:25.441 --> 07:30:27.441
A VALUABLE, POLITICAL BENEFIT 

07:30:29.097 --> 07:30:33.164
FROM UKRAINE. HE WANTED 
UKRAINE'S NEW PRESIDENT TO 

07:30:33.365 --> 07:30:36.214
CREATE ETHICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT 
JOE BIDEN BY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCING

07:30:41.218 --> 07:30:42.931
AN INVESTIGATION. AND TO 
PRESSURE PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO 

07:30:42.932 --> 07:30:44.932
TAKE AN ACTION THAT WOULD 
BENEFIT HIS PERSONAL POLITICAL 

07:30:44.998 --> 07:30:47.985
INTEREST, HE WAS HELD VITAL 
MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE AND 

07:30:48.199 --> 07:30:50.199
REFUSED TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY IN THE 

07:30:52.663 --> 07:30:55.712
OVAL OFFICE. AS WE HEARD FROM 
MR. HOLMES AND DR. HILL TODAY. 

07:30:55.913 --> 07:30:59.766
THAT MEETING WAS EXTRAORDINARILY
IMPORTANT TO UKRAINE AND 

07:30:59.981 --> 07:31:03.030
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT TO 
SENDING A MESSAGE TO RUSSIA 

07:31:03.231 --> 07:31:06.480
ABOUT OUR UNYIELDING SUPPORT. 
THE WITNESSES HAVE MADE IT 

07:31:07.909 --> 07:31:10.946
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT DID THE. AND, IT IS 

07:31:11.964 --> 07:31:16.296
EQUALLY CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS LAUNCHED A COVER UP. 

07:31:16.488 --> 07:31:20.486
AND THIS INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO
HIDE THIS ABUSE OF POWER FROM 

07:31:20.700 --> 07:31:24.755
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY
THE ADMINISTRATION REFUSES TO 

07:31:28.823 --> 07:31:30.823
PROVIDE DOCUMENTS TO THIS 
COMMITTEE. AND, IT IS WHY THE 

07:31:30.856 --> 07:31:32.856
WHITE HOUSE HAS TAKEN THE 
UNPRECEDENTED POSITION THAT 

07:31:32.887 --> 07:31:36.338
SENIOR OFFICIALS COULD IGNORE 
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS AND 

07:31:36.540 --> 07:31:38.540
REFUSED 

07:31:40.806 --> 07:31:42.806
TO TESTIFY, THAT IS MY ACTING 
CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY, 

07:31:42.840 --> 07:31:45.876
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, AND 
OTHERS HAVE NOT TESTIFIED. NOW, 

07:31:46.090 --> 07:31:48.143
THE PRESIDENT AND EVEN SOME 
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE 

07:31:48.332 --> 07:31:56.446
PRETENDING THIS IS NORMAL. IT IS
NOT. IT MUST NEVER BE. NO OTHER 

07:31:56.648 --> 07:31:59.282
PRESIDENT HAS BETRAYED HIS 
OFFICE LIKE THIS BY PUTTING 

07:32:03.551 --> 07:32:05.180
HIS OWN, SMALL POLITICAL 
INTEREST ABOVE OUR NATIONAL 

07:32:05.181 --> 07:32:07.181
INTEREST AND OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 

07:32:10.869 --> 07:32:12.901
NOW, ASKED SOME OF OUR WITNESSES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN ANY 

07:32:13.102 --> 07:32:15.135
AMERICAN CITY OR TOWN IF THE 
MAYOR STOPPED FUNDING THE POLICE

07:32:15.334 --> 07:32:19.401
DEPARTMENT AND TOLD THE UNTIL 
THE CHIEF OF POLICE LAUNCHED AN 

07:32:19.603 --> 07:32:21.603
INVESTIGATION INTO THE MAYOR'S 
POLITICAL RIVAL OR A MEMBER OF 

07:32:21.635 --> 07:32:23.635
CONGRESS 

07:32:25.287 --> 07:32:27.723
DID THAT. THE ANSWER WAS CLEAR, 
IT WOULD BE WRONG, IT WOULD BE 

07:32:27.924 --> 07:32:29.924
ILLEGAL, AND WOULD NOT BE 
TOLERATED. IT WOULD VIOLATE THE 

07:32:29.958 --> 07:32:34.422
MOST BASIC TRUST WE HAVE. WITH 
THE MILITARY COMMANDER, A 

07:32:34.637 --> 07:32:36.476
COURT-MARTIAL WOULD FOLLOW. WHAT
HAPPENED WITH THE CORPORATION, A

07:32:36.477 --> 07:32:39.707
CEO WOULD BE FIRED. WE ALL KNOW 
THIS CONDUCT IS WRONG, THE 

07:32:39.909 --> 07:32:43.578
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO SAY THAT 
IT ISN'T. HE SAYS IT IS PERFECT 

07:32:43.775 --> 07:32:48.290
AND HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN 
TOMORROW. THE SAME RULES APPLY 

07:32:48.479 --> 07:32:50.682
TO MAYORS, GOVERNORS, MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS, CEOs AND EVERYONE ELSE

07:32:52.100 --> 07:32:55.964
IN AMERICA. THEY APPLY TO THE 
PRESIDENT TOO. WHETHER YOU ARE A

07:32:56.164 --> 07:33:00.632
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. YOU LIKE
MSNBC OR FOX. I THINK EVERY 

07:33:01.447 --> 07:33:04.697
AMERICAN BELIEVES IN ONE OF OUR 
NATION'S FOUNDING PRINCIPLES NO 

07:33:04.898 --> 07:33:06.898
PERSON IS ABOVE THE LAW. NOT 
EVEN 

07:33:09.362 --> 07:33:11.362
THE PRESIDENT. JULY 24th, 

07:33:13.629 --> 07:33:15.262
DIRECTOR MUELLER TESTIFIED ABOUT
THE SYSTEMATIC INTERFERENCE IN 

07:33:15.263 --> 07:33:18.499
THE 2016 ELECTION. EXPRESSED 
APPREHENSION THAT THIS BE COULD 

07:33:18.713 --> 07:33:22.979
BECOME THE NEW NORMAL. THE DAY 
AFTER, ON JULY 25th, PRESIDENT 

07:33:25.418 --> 07:33:28.051
TRUMP SPOKE TO PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY AND ASKED A FAVOR. THAT

07:33:28.252 --> 07:33:34.753
FAVOR WAS THAT UKRAINE INTERFERE
IN OUR 2020 ELECTION. IF WE 

07:33:34.954 --> 07:33:37.401
ALLOW THIS TO EXPAND, TO BECOME 
THE 

07:33:40.652 --> 07:33:44.503
NEW NORMAL, IT'LL BE THE 
STANDARD FOR ALL FUTURE 

07:33:44.705 --> 07:33:47.555
PRESIDENTS IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, 
NONE OF US CAN DO THAT. THIS 

07:33:47.756 --> 07:33:49.756
CONDUCT CORRUPTS 

07:33:51.006 --> 07:33:54.058
OUR DEMOCRACY, IT CORRUPTS HOW 
OUR COUNTRY CONDUCTS FOREIGN 

07:33:54.259 --> 07:33:57.296
POLICY IT THREATENS OUR NATIONAL
SECURITY AND THE SECURITY OF ALL

07:33:58.528 --> 07:34:05.228
AMERICANS. AND, IT IS, IN MY 
VIEW, A CLEAR BETRAYAL OF THE 

07:34:05.428 --> 07:34:07.428
PRESIDENT'S OATH OF OFFICE. I 
YELLED 

07:34:09.897 --> 07:34:12.792

07:34:46.462 --> 07:34:48.462
&gt;&gt; 

07:34:50.113 --> 07:34:52.113
WITHOUT OBJECTION. 
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, THANK YOU FOR

07:34:52.750 --> 07:34:54.627
BEING HERE. 
&gt;&gt; DR. HILL FIRST OF ALL I 

07:34:54.628 --> 07:35:01.496
THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME EPIC 
MANSE PLANNING MANSPLANNING YOU 

07:35:01.697 --> 07:35:03.980
ARE FORCED TO ENDURE BUT MY 
COLLEAGUE MR. TURNER, AND I WANT

07:35:04.171 --> 07:35:06.363
TO YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF US 
THINK IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT,

07:35:06.564 --> 07:35:09.819
I APPRECIATE YOUR FORBEARANCE. 
LET ME ASK SOMETHING, I'M 

07:35:10.020 --> 07:35:12.020
FASCINATED BY THIS MEETING, TWO 
MEETINGS REALLY ON 

07:35:14.487 --> 07:35:16.487
JULY 10th. YOU HAVE THE MEETING 
AND MR. 

07:35:19.157 --> 07:35:22.826
BOLTON'S OFFICE, SONDLAND SAYS 
THE THINGS ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS 

07:35:23.229 --> 07:35:26.284
THE FOLLOWING MEETING IN THE 
BOARDROOM. AND, YOU GET THERE A 

07:35:26.479 --> 07:35:32.779
LITTLE LATE, AND VINDMAN IS 
TALKING TO  SONDLAND AND THEY'RE

07:35:32.983 --> 07:35:36.262
GOING ON ABOUT SONDLAND'S DESIRE
TO ASSERT THAT THE MEETING IS 

07:35:36.457 --> 07:35:38.457
GOING 

07:35:41.439 --> 07:35:43.747
TO HAPPEN IF THERE IS THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS, IS THAT SOME 

07:35:43.948 --> 07:35:46.213
SUBSTANCE OF WHAT IS GOING ON? 
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY YES. 

07:35:46.214 --> 07:35:51.053
&gt;&gt; WHAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS,
IS, THIS ISN'T A POLICY 

07:35:51.669 --> 07:35:53.669
DISAGREEMENT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT 

07:35:56.540 --> 07:35:58.358
IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THE SOURCE OF YOUR CONCERN IS

07:35:58.359 --> 07:36:00.397
NOT A POLICY DISAGREEMENT IS NOT
A PROCEDURAL DISAGREEMENT EITHER

07:36:00.601 --> 07:36:02.630
ABOUT, EXCUSE ME? 
&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS NOT CORRECT. 

07:36:02.631 --> 07:36:05.683
&gt;&gt; IT IS NEITHER POLICY OR 
PROCEDURE THAT IS BOTHERING YOU,

07:36:05.882 --> 07:36:10.955
OR FOR THAT MATTER, THE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER MR. BOLTON 

07:36:11.157 --> 07:36:13.808
RIGHT? THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SENDS
YOU DOWN THERE TO SEE HOW THE 

07:36:14.009 --> 07:36:19.495
MEETING IS GOING. IN FACT, HE 
INSTRUCTS YOU TO GO TO THE 

07:36:19.772 --> 07:36:21.807
LAWYER. EVER BEEN INSTRUCTED TO 
GO REPORT SOMETHING TO THE NFC 

07:36:22.131 --> 07:36:23.964
LAWYER BEFORE? 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME. I 

07:36:23.965 --> 07:36:27.617
HAVE SELF INSTRUCTED A COUPLE OF
TIMES BUT THAT IS THE FIRST TIME

07:36:27.818 --> 07:36:29.818
I HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO GO. 

07:36:32.082 --> 07:36:36.351
&gt;&gt; AND, WHY DID HE SEND YOU TO 
REPORT THIS TO THE LAWYER? 

07:36:36.352 --> 07:36:38.587
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE CLEARLY WANTED TO 
HAVE HIMSELF ON THE RECORD AS 

07:36:38.787 --> 07:36:41.836
NOT BEING PART OF WHAT WAS 
BASICALLY AN AGREEMENT TO HAVE 

07:36:45.286 --> 07:36:47.286
A MEETING IN RETURN FOR 
INVESTIGATIONS. AND HE WANTED TO

07:36:47.322 --> 07:36:51.389
MAKE SURE THAT I, AND COLONEL 
VINDMAN WERE NOT A PART OF THIS 

07:36:51.590 --> 07:36:56.099
AS WELL BECAUSE  IT WAS A PART 
OF NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN 

07:36:56.288 --> 07:36:58.288
DOMESTIC POLITICS. 
&gt;&gt; YES, 

07:37:01.876 --> 07:37:04.793
I UNDERSTAND, DID YOU CONCUR 
WITH THIS CONCERN THAT MR. 

07:37:04.993 --> 07:37:06.825
BOLTON HAD? 
&gt;&gt; I DID. JULY 10th IS REALLY 

07:37:06.826 --> 07:37:08.826
THE FIRST TIME THAT A 
CRYSTALLIZED FOR ME THAT THERE 

07:37:08.848 --> 07:37:12.100
WAS, BASICALLY, A DIFFERENT 
CHANNEL GOING ON HERE. A 

07:37:12.323 --> 07:37:14.135
FOREIGN-POLICY CHANNEL AND A 
DOMESTIC POLICY CHANNEL AND, WE 

07:37:14.136 --> 07:37:17.783
ARE NOT IN THE CHANNEL. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT AS A

07:37:18.398 --> 07:37:20.431
LOCAL ERRANDS AND YOU ARE DOING 
NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY IS HOW 

07:37:20.630 --> 07:37:22.630
YOU DISTINGUISH THOSE TWO 
CHANNELS, IS THAT 

07:37:25.915 --> 07:37:26.579
FAIR? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

07:37:26.580 --> 07:37:29.165
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT
YOU FELT IT WAS IMPROPER WHAT 

07:37:29.365 --> 07:37:31.365
WAS OCCURRING BY MR. 

07:37:33.020 --> 07:37:34.650
SONDLAND ? 
&gt;&gt; IT WAS IMPROPER AND 

07:37:34.651 --> 07:37:36.651
INAPPROPRIATE. WE SAID THAT IN 
REAL TIME. 

07:37:39.518 --> 07:37:41.518
&gt;&gt; AND, HERE IS MY 

07:37:44.397 --> 07:37:46.397
POINT. IF IF IT WAS 

07:37:49.479 --> 07:37:51.502
IMPROPER AND, AND YOU WENT SO 
FAR AS REPORT THIS TO 

07:37:54.753 --> 07:37:58.407
THE LAWYERS, WHAT WAS THE NATURE
OF YOUR DISAGREEMENT WITH MR. 

07:37:58.622 --> 07:38:01.054
SONDLAND WHO HAS COME HERE AND 
SAID HE HAD NO IDEA THAT  

07:38:01.255 --> 07:38:05.323
BURISMA MEANT  BIDEN UNTIL MUCH,
MUCH LATER THAN JULY 10th. OF 

07:38:05.524 --> 07:38:11.008
COURSE, WE KNOW THAT HE AND 
AMBASSADOR VOLKER HAD A BLITZ OF

07:38:11.410 --> 07:38:17.714
INTERACTIONS WITH MR. GIULIANI. 
THIS ONE WENT ON ALL SUMMER. AND

07:38:17.916 --> 07:38:21.164
YET, HOW IS IT YOU HAD THIS 
DISAGREEMENT IN FRONT OF THE 

07:38:21.365 --> 07:38:24.415
UKRAINIANS THAT SENT THEM OUT 
INTO THE HALLWAY, AT SOME POINT,

07:38:24.615 --> 07:38:26.615
DID HE ASK, I'M JUST 

07:38:28.683 --> 07:38:30.373
TALKING ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION 
OF CORRUPTION, GENERALLY, WHAT 

07:38:30.374 --> 07:38:34.971
YOU GETTING SO WORRIED ABOUT. 
&gt;&gt; DID NOT PUT IT IN THAT WAY, 

07:38:35.183 --> 07:38:39.237
AND, I THINK FROM LISTENING TO 
HIM AND HIS DEPOSITIONS AND, YOU

07:38:39.450 --> 07:38:45.540
KNOW, WHAT I HAVE READ HE MADE 
IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WAS 

07:38:45.741 --> 07:38:49.392
SURPRISED WE HAD SOME KIND OF 
OBJECTION. YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT

07:38:49.606 --> 07:38:52.038
IN HIS DEPOSITION AND WHEN HE 
WAS HERE, HE ACTUALLY DID NOT 

07:38:52.311 --> 07:38:54.311
REMEMBER THE MEETING IN THE 

07:38:57.724 --> 07:38:59.580
SAME WAY. 
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS 

07:38:59.581 --> 07:39:00.773
PRETTY OBVIOUS TO YOU? EXCUSE 
ME. 

07:39:00.774 --> 07:39:03.041
&gt;&gt; IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME. 
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THAT 

07:39:03.232 --> 07:39:06.458
BURISMA MEANT  THE BIDENS AND 
THAT IS A PRETTY EASY THING TO 

07:39:06.659 --> 07:39:08.692
UNDERSTAND THAT MR. MORRISON  
FIGURED IT OUT WITH A SINGLE 

07:39:09.106 --> 07:39:11.106
GOOGLE SEARCH, IT IS AN 
INCREDIBLE VIEW THAT MR. 

07:39:15.472 --> 07:39:17.424
SEAN LIND SONDLAND WAS IN THE 
DARK ABOUT THIS? 

07:39:17.425 --> 07:39:20.075
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD AN ARGUMENT ABOUT IT?
&gt;&gt; HE WAS OBLIVIOUS TO IT, TO 

07:39:20.277 --> 07:39:22.884
MAKE? I CANNOT FIGURE ANSWER. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT CRITICAL TO ME THAT

07:39:23.078 --> 07:39:26.999
HE WAS OBLIVIOUS, HE DID NOT SAY
BIDEN, HE SAID BURISMA. I TOOK 

07:39:27.192 --> 07:39:31.447
IT AS  TO MEAN THE ELECTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

07:39:31.848 --> 07:39:33.848
APPEARANCE 

07:39:36.859 --> 07:39:38.346
TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; MS. DEMING'S. 

07:39:38.347 --> 07:39:42.213
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH DR. HILL 
AND MR. HOLMES FOR YOUR SERVICE.

07:39:42.413 --> 07:39:44.849
I HAVE NO DOUBT AFTER TODAY THAT
WE ARE A BETTER NATION BECAUSE 

07:39:45.250 --> 07:39:47.250
OF IT. WE ALL KNOW, 

07:39:49.719 --> 07:39:52.163
BY NOW, THAT IN JULY OF THIS 
YEAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT AN 

07:39:52.355 --> 07:39:54.355
ORDER TO THE OFFICE OF 
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET THAT 

07:39:54.802 --> 07:39:57.855
CONGRESSIONALLY APPROVED 
MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE BE PUT 

07:40:00.288 --> 07:40:02.288
ON HOLD. BOTH OF YOU HAVE 
EXPRESSED 

07:40:05.158 --> 07:40:08.008
THAT UKRAINE IS THE FIRST LINE 
OF DEFENSE AGAINST RUSSIAN 

07:40:08.208 --> 07:40:10.208
AGGRESSION AND EXPANSION 

07:40:11.861 --> 07:40:13.892
INTO EUROPE. THE RUSSIA'S 
PRIORITY IS TO UNDERMINE THE 

07:40:16.945 --> 07:40:18.363
UNITED STATES, IS THAT RIGHT DR.
HILL? 

07:40:18.364 --> 07:40:22.706
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 

07:40:22.904 --> 07:40:24.904
DR. HILL, IN YOUR 

07:40:28.463 --> 07:40:30.463
PROFESSIONAL OPINION, AND THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST, OF 

07:40:30.555 --> 07:40:33.450
THE UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT 
UKRAINE WITH THE MUCH TALKED 

07:40:33.640 --> 07:40:35.838
ABOUT MILITARY AID? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

07:40:35.839 --> 07:40:39.492
&gt;&gt; MR. HOLMES? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 

07:40:39.493 --> 07:40:41.730
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IT 
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY AND YOU 

07:40:41.930 --> 07:40:47.615
ALREADY TESTIFIED THAT UKRAINE 
IS IN WAR RIGHT NOW. WITH 

07:40:47.814 --> 07:40:50.262
RUSSIA. ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. 
HOLMES THAT EVEN THOUGH THE 

07:40:50.662 --> 07:40:52.696
SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS 
EVENTUALLY DELIVERED 

07:40:56.148 --> 07:40:59.800
TO UKRAINE, AND THE FACT THAT IT
WAS DELAYED TO A COUNTRY THAT 

07:41:02.448 --> 07:41:05.497
WAS ACTIVELY IN WAR, SIGNAL TO 
RUSSIA, THAT PERHAPS THE BOND 

07:41:06.712 --> 07:41:14.018
BETWEEN UKRAINE AND THE UNITED 
STATES WAS WEAKENING. 

07:41:14.019 --> 07:41:17.545
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. 
&gt;&gt; EVEN THE APPEARANCE THAT THE 

07:41:18.288 --> 07:41:22.956
U.S.-UKRAINE BOND IS SHAKY COULD
EMBOLDEN RUSSIA TO ACT IN AN 

07:41:23.773 --> 07:41:26.407
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS 

07:41:29.669 --> 07:41:31.112
CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO TESTIFIED THAT IT 

07:41:31.113 --> 07:41:34.740
WAS A UNANIMOUS VIEW OF THE 
UKRAINE POLICY COMMUNITY. THAT 

07:41:37.990 --> 07:41:41.239
THE AIDS AGENT SHOULD BE 
RELEASED BECAUSE SUPPORTING 

07:41:41.512 --> 07:41:44.089
UKRAINE IS IN OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY INTEREST. DR. HILL, WHY

07:41:44.290 --> 07:41:50.782
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ENTIRE 
UKRAINE POLICY COMMUNITY WERE 

07:41:50.997 --> 07:41:52.997
UNANIMOUSLY 

07:41:56.009 --> 07:41:58.300
IN AGREEMENT? 
&gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE 

07:41:58.502 --> 07:42:00.737
BEFORE. I JUST WANT YOU TO 
INDULGE ME FOR A MOMENT. IN 

07:42:02.571 --> 07:42:05.823
2008, RUSSIA ALSO ATTACKED THE 
COUNTRY OF GEORGIA. I WAS THE 

07:42:06.033 --> 07:42:10.089
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AT
THAT PARTICULAR JUNCTURE, AND WE

07:42:10.291 --> 07:42:12.525
HAD WARNED, AND MULTIPLE 
DOCUMENTS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS 

07:42:14.557 --> 07:42:16.792
OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE BELIEVED 
THERE WAS A REAL RISK OF A 

07:42:17.392 --> 07:42:20.443
CONFLICT BETWEEN, SORRY, GEORGIA
AND RUSSIA. 

07:42:23.494 --> 07:42:25.529
IN FACT, WE ALSO BELIEVED AT 
THAT POINT THAT RUSSIA MIGHT 

07:42:26.746 --> 07:42:29.782
ATTACK UKRAINE. THIS IS IN 2008 
WHEN BOTH GEORGIA AND UKRAINE 

07:42:29.997 --> 07:42:32.432
FORCED A MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN 
IN NATO. AND RUSSIA THREATENED 

07:42:33.450 --> 07:42:37.716
THEM OPENLY WHICH THEY PROCEEDED
WITH THE REQUEST FOR NATO 

07:42:37.989 --> 07:42:39.989
MEMBERSHIP THAT THEY WOULD 

07:42:42.187 --> 07:42:44.209
BE CONSEQUENCES. WITH THE WEEK 
ON THE ATTACK OF GEORGIA, MADE 

07:42:45.827 --> 07:42:50.117
IT CLEAR TO THE PRESIDENT OF 
GEORGIA AT THE TIME. AND THIS 

07:42:50.315 --> 07:42:52.315
WAS RELATED TO THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS OF 

07:42:56.940 --> 07:43:01.314
THE GOVERNMENT. WESTERN ALLIES, 
WESTERN PARTNERS PROMISED A 

07:43:01.882 --> 07:43:07.767
GREAT DEAL. THEY DIDN'T DELIVER.
I THREATENED, I DELIVERED. WE 

07:43:07.981 --> 07:43:11.634
HAD MADE ALL KINDS OF PROMISES 
TO GEORGIA AND UKRAINE IN THAT 

07:43:11.909 --> 07:43:13.909
TIMEFRAME. AND IT DIDN'T 

07:43:17.458 --> 07:43:20.773
COME THROUGH. PUTIN IS ALWAYS 
LOOKING OUT TO SEE IF THERE ANY 

07:43:20.974 --> 07:43:26.058
HENS WE WOULD NOT FOLLOW THROUGH
ON POLICIES THAT WE MADE BECAUSE

07:43:26.258 --> 07:43:28.294
HE WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH ON
A THREAT, AS INDEED HE 

07:43:28.495 --> 07:43:30.495
ULTIMATELY DID. HE THREATENED 
UKRAINE IN 2008 AND IT WASN'T 

07:43:30.527 --> 07:43:34.583
UNTIL 2014 THAT UKRAINE TRIED TO
CONCLUDE AN ASSOCIATION WITH THE

07:43:35.399 --> 07:43:38.033
EUROPEAN UNION. HE HAD BEEN 
TRAINING THIS FOR THE WHOLE. 

07:43:40.469 --> 07:43:42.469
SINCE 2008 
&gt;&gt; 

07:43:44.738 --> 07:43:47.375
THANK YOU, MR. HOLMES WHAT 
MESSAGE DOES IT SEND TO OTHER 

07:43:47.589 --> 07:43:49.589
ALLIES OF THE UNITED STATES 

07:43:52.756 --> 07:43:56.984
WHEN MILITARY HOLDS FOR 
ASSISTANCE, OR FOR IMPOSED WITH 

07:43:58.958 --> 07:44:02.621
NO EXPLANATION, WHAT KIND OF 
MESSAGES ARE SENT TO OUR ALLIES 

07:44:02.822 --> 07:44:05.053
IN TERMS OF GOOD FAITH AND GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.? 

07:44:05.054 --> 07:44:07.809
&gt;&gt; CALLS INTO QUESTION THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN COUNT 

07:44:10.340 --> 07:44:12.340
ON US. 
&gt;&gt; POLICIES CHANGE BUT U.S. 

07:44:14.191 --> 07:44:17.514
INTEREST DON'T. AT LEAST NOT FOR
THOSE TRUE PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO 

07:44:17.704 --> 07:44:22.325
ARE COMMITTED, AND DEDICATED TO 
PROTECTING OUR NATION. THANK YOU

07:44:22.532 --> 07:44:24.532
BOTH FOR BEING TWO OF THEM. 

07:44:30.034 --> 07:44:32.684
W GOOD AFTERNOON, THANK YOU FOR 
COMING IN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

07:44:32.884 --> 07:44:35.522
SERVICE. DR. HILL YOU STATED IN 
YOUR DEPOSITION YOU HAVE BEEN 

07:44:35.723 --> 07:44:40.856
ACCUSED OF BEING A ROLE MOLE IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE, IS THAT 

07:44:41.045 --> 07:44:42.432
CORRECT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

07:44:42.433 --> 07:44:48.923
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID IN YOUR DEPOSITION, 
SPECIFICALLY, A CONSPIRACY WAS 

07:44:49.138 --> 07:44:52.385
LAUNCHED AGAINST YOU BY 
CONVICTED FELON ROGER STONE ON 

07:44:52.586 --> 07:44:54.586
THE SHOW 

07:44:57.798 --> 07:45:01.179
INFO WARS LED BY ALEX JONES, 
RIGHT? 

07:45:01.180 --> 07:45:03.554
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK IT WAS A 
CONFLICT AT THE TIME THAT HE 

07:45:03.776 --> 07:45:06.188
LAUNCHED THIS SO I DO NOT USE 
THOSE EXACT WORDS. BUT, IT WAS 

07:45:06.402 --> 07:45:08.838
INDEED ROGER STONE AND ALEX 
JONES IN INFO WARS IN 2016, MORE

07:45:09.040 --> 07:45:15.132
RECENTLY, BEFORE MR. STONE 
ENDURED HIS TRIAL, THEY WERE AT 

07:45:15.330 --> 07:45:19.796
IT AGAIN REPRISING THE SAME INFO
AND ADDING EMBELLISHMENTS. 

07:45:19.797 --> 07:45:23.050
&gt;&gt; THEY SAID, I WILL QUOTE WHAT 
THEY SAID ABOUT YOU. "WE HEAR, 

07:45:23.263 --> 07:45:29.752
AT INFO WARS. THIS IS ROGER 
STONE SPEAKING, FIRST IDENTIFY 

07:45:29.965 --> 07:45:32.800
OWED IDENTIFY FIONA HILL, THE 
GLOBALIST LEFTIST GEORGE SOROS 

07:45:33.216 --> 07:45:35.216
INSIDER 

07:45:38.223 --> 07:45:41.745
THAT INFILTRATED STAFF." HE SAID
THAT ON MAY 31st, 2017. I ASSUME

07:45:42.021 --> 07:45:44.021
YOU'RE NOT A 

07:45:46.413 --> 07:45:48.030
GLOBALIST LEFT-SIDED? 
&gt;&gt; HAVING MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE

07:45:48.031 --> 07:45:51.085
SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT ABOUT ME.
LEFTIST, NOT SO MUCH WITH THE 

07:45:51.283 --> 07:45:55.149
LEFT IN EUROPE IS DIFFERENT FROM
THE LEFT EAR HERE. 

07:45:55.150 --> 07:45:56.768
&gt;&gt; I AGREE. 
&gt;&gt; INTERESTINGLY, YOU STATED IN 

07:45:56.769 --> 07:46:00.638
YOUR DEPOSITION THAT A SIMILAR 
CONSPIRACY THEORY HAD ACTUALLY 

07:46:00.839 --> 07:46:02.839
BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST MARIE 

07:46:07.660 --> 07:46:10.375
YOVANOVITCH.  
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 

07:46:10.376 --> 07:46:12.376
&gt;&gt; USES SPECIFICALLY "WHEN I SAW
THIS HAPPENING TO AMBASSADOR 

07:46:12.411 --> 07:46:16.063
YOVANOVITCH, I WAS FURIOUS . 
BECAUSE THIS IS AGAIN JUST A 

07:46:16.279 --> 07:46:18.512
WHIPPING UP OF WHAT IS FRANKLY 
AN ANTI-SEMITIC CONSPIRACY 

07:46:18.713 --> 07:46:20.713
THEORY ABOUT GEORGE SOROS TO 

07:46:22.978 --> 07:46:24.978
BASICALLY TARGET NONPARTISAN 
CAREER OFFICIALS, IS THAT WHAT 

07:46:28.250 --> 07:46:29.880
YOU SAID? 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT I SAID. 

07:46:29.881 --> 07:46:31.915
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING WITH CONCERN WHAT HAS 

07:46:32.116 --> 07:46:34.150
HAPPENED TO OTHER NONPARTISAN 
CAREER OFFICIALS. WE HAD 

07:46:34.351 --> 07:46:36.351
LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALEX VINDMAN,

07:46:38.419 --> 07:46:41.872
AND  AN IMMIGRANT QUESTION FOR 
HIS CRITICISM OF 

07:46:45.927 --> 07:46:47.756
THE PRESIDENT. NOW, IN A VERY, 
UNFAIR WAY, BASICALLY 

07:46:47.757 --> 07:46:50.830
QUESTIONING HIS LOYALTY TO THE 
COUNTRY. I BELIEVE HE IS ALSO OF

07:46:51.021 --> 07:46:54.258
UKRAINIAN-JEWISH DESCENT. WOULD 
YOU SAY THAT IT IS DIFFERENT 

07:46:54.484 --> 07:46:56.566
THEORIES, THESE CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES THAT HAVE BEEN 

07:46:57.910 --> 07:47:01.160
TARGETING YOU SPUN IN PART BY 
FOLKS LIKE MR. STONE, AS 

07:47:05.027 --> 07:47:07.027
WELL AS FUELED BY RUDY GIULIANI,
AND 

07:47:10.513 --> 07:47:14.767
OTHERS. BASICALLY, HAVE A TENT 
OF ANTI-SEMITISM TO THEM, AT 

07:47:14.981 --> 07:47:16.198
LEAST? 
&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY WHEN THEY INVOLVE 

07:47:16.199 --> 07:47:20.871
GEORGE SOROS THEY DO. I LIKE TO 
POINT OUT THAT IN THE EARLY 

07:47:21.071 --> 07:47:23.071
1900S, THERE ARE THE SECRET 
POLICE THAT PRODUCED SOMETHING 

07:47:24.923 --> 07:47:27.773
CALLED THE, BUT YOU CAN STILL 
OBTAIN ON THE INTERNET AND BUY 

07:47:27.974 --> 07:47:29.974
SOMETIMES AND BOOKSHOPS IN 
RUSSIA 

07:47:32.856 --> 07:47:34.274
AND ELSEWHERE. THIS IS THE 
LONGEST-RUNNING ANTI-SEMITIC 

07:47:34.275 --> 07:47:39.345
TROPE WE HAVE IN HISTORY. AND, A
TROPE AGAINST MR. GEORGE SOROS 

07:47:39.558 --> 07:47:42.191
WAS ALSO CREATED FOR POLITICAL 
PURPOSES. AND, THIS IS THE 

07:47:46.457 --> 07:47:48.497
NEW PROTOCOL I INTENDED TO WRITE
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE I 

07:47:48.692 --> 07:47:52.548
WAS ACTUALLY INVITED TO COME 
INTO THE ADMINISTRATION. 

07:47:52.761 --> 07:47:54.579
ABSOLUTE OUTRAGE. 
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

07:47:54.580 --> 07:47:57.432
KIND OF WRAPPED UP IN THESE 
CRACKPOT CONSIDERS CONSPIRACY 

07:47:57.722 --> 07:48:01.900
THEORIES. LET ME TURN TO RUDY 
GIULIANI. HE BECAME INCREASINGLY

07:48:02.100 --> 07:48:04.133
CONCERNED ABOUT RUDY GIULIANI'S 
INCREASING ROLE 

07:48:08.200 --> 07:48:10.019
IN UKRAINE BETWEEN JANUARY AND 
MARCH OF 2019, CORRECT? 

07:48:10.020 --> 07:48:14.896
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU SERVED IN THE BUSH

07:48:15.106 --> 07:48:16.724
AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS I 
PRESUME THAT GEORGE BUSH'S 

07:48:16.725 --> 07:48:20.044
PERSONAL LAWYER AND, PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S PERSONAL LAWYER'S WERE 

07:48:20.234 --> 07:48:25.260
NEVER, YOU KNOW, DIRECTING OR 
HEAVILY INFLUENCING UKRAINIAN 

07:48:25.461 --> 07:48:27.461
POLICY. 
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT EVEN SURE I KNEW WHO 

07:48:30.746 --> 07:48:32.981
THEY WERE. SO THE ANSWER IS NO. 
&gt;&gt; THE CONCERN FOR HAVING 

07:48:33.182 --> 07:48:35.415
SOMEONE LIKE RUDY GIULIANI 
HAVING SUCH A STRONG INFLUENCE 

07:48:35.615 --> 07:48:38.263
ON AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY IS 
THAT YOU KNOW, BASICALLY 

07:48:41.301 --> 07:48:43.948
THAT POLICY MAY BE OPERATING NOT
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF AMERICA,

07:48:44.148 --> 07:48:48.420
BUT PERHAPS IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF RUDY GIULIANI OR HIS CLIENTS 

07:48:48.615 --> 07:48:50.615
OR BUSINESS 

07:48:53.084 --> 07:48:54.918
ASSOCIATES, RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS CORRECT, AND 

07:48:54.919 --> 07:48:56.952
THAT IS WHAT I SAID IN MY 
DEPOSITION ON OCTOBER 14th. 

07:48:57.153 --> 07:48:59.388
WRINKLY, THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT 
IT WAS AT THE VERY BEGINNING 

07:48:59.588 --> 07:49:01.822
WHEN I FIRST HEARD MR. GIULIANI.
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THOSE ASSOCIATES 

07:49:02.022 --> 07:49:04.022
INCLUDED 

07:49:07.033 --> 07:49:09.944
INDICTED FOLKS, ISN'T THAT 
RIGHT? 

07:49:09.945 --> 07:49:11.775
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN INTERESTING 

07:49:11.776 --> 07:49:14.012
CHARACTER IN CHICAGO WHO IS NOW 
BEEN INDICTED, HIS NAME IS MR. 

07:49:14.213 --> 07:49:16.252
FOR TASS. MR. FOR TASS HAS BEEN 
INDICTED FOR FEDERAL BRIBERY 

07:49:16.455 --> 07:49:18.455
CHARGES AND OTHER ASSOCIATES 

07:49:20.500 --> 07:49:22.500
OF GIULIANI 
&gt;&gt; I KNOW OF HIM FOR MY WORK 

07:49:22.545 --> 07:49:24.571
THAT IS CORRECT. 
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION THAT WE ARE ALL 

07:49:27.208 --> 07:49:29.039
ASKING IS WHETHER AMERICAN 
FOREIGN POLICY IN UKRAINE IS 

07:49:29.040 --> 07:49:33.380
POTENTIALLY BEING RUN IN THEIR 
INTEREST, AND NOT OUR OWN. 

07:49:33.381 --> 07:49:36.358
&gt;&gt; IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT IT 
HAS BEEN USED, THE SUBVERSION OF

07:49:38.176 --> 07:49:41.027
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY TO PUSH 
THESE PERSONS PERSONAL INTEREST.

07:49:41.228 --> 07:49:45.735
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. TWO THAT 
INCLUDES THE MEMBER QUESTIONING 

07:49:45.927 --> 07:49:47.927
I WILL NOW GO TO CLOSING 
STATEMENTS. CHAIRMAN SCHIFF DO 

07:49:47.929 --> 07:49:49.929

REMARKS  TRAN40 YOU HAVE ANY 
REMARKS? 

07:49:54.017 --> 07:49:56.560
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU I HAVE STRESS ANY 
HEARINGS THAT THE WHISTLEBLOWER 

07:49:56.750 --> 07:49:58.492
COMPLAINT WAS MERELY A PRETEXT 
FOR DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL 

07:49:58.493 --> 07:50:00.935
OPPONENTS TO DO WHAT THEY WILL 
DO SINCE HE HAS BEEN ELECTED, 

07:50:01.136 --> 07:50:04.172

CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE

PRESIDENT TRUMP. AS YOU SEE, 
THIS WAS JUST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

07:51:41.389 --> 07:51:43.389
FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE, HE WAS 

07:51:46.358 --> 07:51:47.978

07:54:17.911 --> 07:54:22.637

DEMOCRAT DENIALS THAT SUCH 
CONTACT 

07:54:34.982 --> 07:54:39.037
HAD OCCURRED. OCTOBER 31st,

07:54:40.871 --> 07:54:42.488

IMPISHLY IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 

07:54:47.159 --> 07:54:51.629
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT 
YOU SEE IN THIS ROOM OVER THE 

07:54:51.840 --> 07:54:53.840
PAST TWO WEEKS IS A 

07:54:55.694 --> 07:54:58.747
SHOW TRIAL. A PLANT RESULT OF 
THREE YEARS OF POLITICAL 

07:54:58.948 --> 07:55:00.948
OPERATIONS AND 

07:55:02.802 --> 07:55:05.451
DIRTY TRICKS. AND PAINS THAT 
WEIGHED AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT. 

07:55:05.652 --> 07:55:08.503
AND, LIKE ANY GOOD SHOW TRIAL, 
THE VERDICT WAS DECIDED BEFORE 

07:55:08.902 --> 07:55:11.336
THE TRIAL EVER BEGAN. 

07:55:14.589 --> 07:55:16.589
AFTER ALL, AFTER DOUBTING THE 
PRESIDENT FOUR YEARS AS A 

07:55:16.684 --> 07:55:20.074
RUSSIAN AGENT, ANY THREAT TO 
DEMOCRACY, HOW CAN THE DEMOCRATS

07:55:20.274 --> 07:55:22.274
NOT 

07:55:23.726 --> 07:55:26.428
IMPEACH HIM? IF THEY DON'T HAVE 
TO, IF THEY DON'T MOVE TO 

07:55:26.628 --> 07:55:28.607
OVERTHROW HIM, IT WOULD INDICATE
THEY DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN 

07:55:28.608 --> 07:55:33.077
THEIR OWN DIRE WARNINGS ABOUT 
THE THREAT THAT HE POSES. 

07:55:33.277 --> 07:55:38.015
DEMOCRATS ONLY NEEDED A PRETEXT.
WHEN THERE RUSSIAN DOSSIERS AND 

07:55:38.221 --> 07:55:41.397
INVESTIGATIONS FAILED TO DO THE 
JOB THEY MOVED TO PLAN B. A 

07:55:42.613 --> 07:55:47.494
UKRAINE HOAX. THE SPECTACLE WITH
ITS SECRET DEPOSITIONS AND MID 

07:55:47.694 --> 07:55:51.146
HEARING OF PRESS CONFERENCES IS 
NOT MEANT TO DISCOVER THE FACTS,

07:55:51.346 --> 07:55:53.346
IT 

07:55:54.811 --> 07:55:56.811
WAS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE A 
SPECIFIC STORYLINE TO BE PUSHED 

07:55:56.833 --> 07:56:00.499
FORWARD BY THE DEMOCRATS AND 
THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THE MEDIA. 

07:56:00.700 --> 07:56:05.168
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS WE 
APPROACH THANKSGIVING SPEAKER 

07:56:05.369 --> 07:56:11.054
PELOSI HAS JUST MADE CLEAR, JUST
TODAY, USMCA, THE TRADE DEAL 

07:56:11.255 --> 07:56:15.924
WITH CANADA AND MEXICO WILL 
BOOST OUR ECONOMY, IT WON'T BE 

07:56:16.139 --> 07:56:21.009
SIGNED THIS YEAR. I HOPE, MR. 
CHAIRMAN 

07:56:24.664 --> 07:56:26.897
SCHIFF  WILL CLARIFY HOW MUCH 
LONGER WE WILL WASTE ON THIS 

07:56:27.098 --> 07:56:29.098
EFFORT AND WHAT OTHER VITAL 
LEGISLATION HE IS WILLING TO 

07:56:29.133 --> 07:56:34.617
SACRIFICE FOR THIS IMPEACHMENT 
WILL THERE BE EVEN MORE SECRET 

07:56:34.821 --> 07:56:38.073
DEPOSITIONS ACCOMPANIED BY THE 
USUAL FLAT A DEMOCRATIC LEAKS? 

07:56:38.269 --> 07:56:40.780
WILL WE HAVE MORE PUBLIC 
HEARINGS WITH DEMOCRAT 

07:56:40.971 --> 07:56:46.393
WITNESSES, BUT NOT OURS MINORITY
ARE IN THE DARK ABOUT WHAT THIS 

07:56:46.606 --> 07:56:48.606
COMMITTEE WILL BE DOING WHEN WE 

07:56:51.475 --> 07:56:55.341
RETURN. SO, IS AMERICA. JAMES 
MADISON WARNED US ABOUT THE 

07:56:55.744 --> 07:56:57.744
DANGER POSED BY THE TIERNEY OF 

07:57:01.231 --> 07:57:03.231
THE MAJORITY. TO AVOID THAT 
THREAT, OUR FOUNDERS CREATED A 

07:57:04.280 --> 07:57:07.932
CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. BUT, IS
THERE A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THE 

07:57:08.133 --> 07:57:12.653
TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY IN THE 
WAY THIS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS HAS

07:57:12.840 --> 07:57:14.833
BEEN RUN IN THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES. A PROCESS THAT 

07:57:14.834 --> 07:57:18.498
IS GROSSLY UNFAIR CAN ONLY STEM 
FROM A CYNICAL MAJORITY THAT IS 

07:57:18.699 --> 07:57:20.699
WILLING TO BREAK LONG 

07:57:25.319 --> 07:57:30.075
ESTABLISHED PRESENCES. 
PRECEDENTS TRAMPLE ON MAJORITY 

07:57:30.271 --> 07:57:32.303
CONCERNS, AND IS TO ASSUME THEIR
ABSOLUTE WILL ON THIS BODY 

07:57:32.508 --> 07:57:35.352
THROUGH SHEER FORCE OF NUMBERS. 
EXPLOITING THE INTELLIGENCE 

07:57:35.552 --> 07:57:38.001
COMMITTEE AS A VENUE FOR 
IMPEACHMENT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE 

07:57:38.201 --> 07:57:41.852
GROSSEST ABUSES IN THE PROCESS 
FILLED WITH CLINICAL 

07:57:42.053 --> 07:57:44.053
MANIPULATIONS, LARGE 

07:57:46.324 --> 07:57:48.968
AND SMALL. BUT THIS FARCE WILL 
SOON MOVE TO THE JUDICIARY 

07:57:49.169 --> 07:57:52.419
COMMITTEE WHERE IMPEACHMENT 
RIGHTFULLY BELONGS. I WISH MY 

07:57:54.653 --> 07:57:56.290
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WELL IN 
FIGHTING THIS TRAVESTY AND 

07:57:56.291 --> 07:57:58.291
DEFENDING 

07:58:00.342 --> 07:58:02.342
THE IDEA. WHICH AT ONE TIME 
RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT NOT 

07:58:02.976 --> 07:58:06.640
LONG AGO. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S 
VOTE ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING. 

07:58:10.694 --> 07:58:14.146
I YIELD TIME.  
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU THE GENTLEMAN, 

07:58:14.347 --> 07:58:16.347
FIRST 

07:58:19.362 --> 07:58:22.496
OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH 
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I WANTED 

07:58:22.687 --> 07:58:25.733
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LONG YEARS OF
SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY. YOU ARE 

07:58:25.933 --> 07:58:27.933
NOT DEMOCRATIC WITNESSES OR 
REPUBLICAN WITNESSES, YOU ARE 

07:58:27.967 --> 07:58:31.853
NONPARTISAN AND HAVE TALKED TO 
THE FACTS AND THAT IS AS IT 

07:58:33.854 --> 07:58:36.090
SHOULD BE, FIRST I WANT TO MAKE 
A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS ABOUT 

07:58:36.291 --> 07:58:38.291
THE HEARING TODAY. DR. HILL, YOU

07:58:42.390 --> 07:58:44.390
WERE CRITICIZED SEVERAL TIMES BY
MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR OPENING 

07:58:44.408 --> 07:58:46.978
STATEMENT. I'M GLAD YOU DO NOT 
BACK DOWN FROM IT. YOU ARE MUCH 

07:58:47.417 --> 07:58:49.417
MORE DIPLOMATIC THAN I AM, I 
HAVE 

07:58:52.744 --> 07:58:54.575
TO SAY. ANYONE WATCHING THESE 
PROCEEDINGS, ANYONE READING THE 

07:58:54.576 --> 07:58:56.193
DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS WOULD 
HAVE THE SAME IMPRESSION THAT 

07:58:56.194 --> 07:58:58.427
YOU, EVIDENTLY HAD FROM HEARING 
MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE RUSSIA 

07:58:58.627 --> 07:59:00.627
HOAX. 

07:59:03.509 --> 07:59:05.545
THAT THE WHOLE IDEA THAT RUSSIA 
GOT INVOLVED IN THE AMBASSADOR 

07:59:05.742 --> 07:59:07.778
SONDLAND ELECTION  WAS A HOAX 
PUT OUT BY THE DEMOCRATS.
