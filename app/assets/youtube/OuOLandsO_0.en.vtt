00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.000
-The American people
are about to weigh in.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.250
-A campaign
is already under way.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.750
-Voters are going to get
to weigh in.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.030
-It's about the principle.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.790
-You don't do this
in an election year.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.760
-The American people
will choose.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.050
-Let the American people
consider it as part of deciding

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.890
who to support in November.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.490
-That was when Democrat Barack
Obama was in the White House.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.030
Now many of the same senators
you just saw

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.340
are saying don't wait.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.960
President Trump should get
to choose

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.680
Ginsburg's successor
immediately.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.230
-We've got a situation --

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.850
you just played a quote
from me in 2016.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.600
We can play that game all day
long where you can play both --

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.910
-Well, I-I-I-I-I-
I don't disagree with that.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.630
I don't disagree.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.490
That's what I'm just trying
to get you to concede --

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.070
this is really about
who has the votes

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.580
and who has the power
at any given time, right?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.470
-S-S-S-So,
no, actually, it isn't.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.520
-Here's what you said
at that time.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.120
-In a few short months,
we will have a new president

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.480
and new senators who can
consider the next justice

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.980
with the full faith
of the American people.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.240
-Now, Garland was nominated
nine months before the election,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.650
and you were saying then,
nine months before the election,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.960
it was wrong to deny voters
a chance to weigh in.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.650
So if it was wrong then,
nine months before the election,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.440
why is it okay now,
six weeks before the election?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.720
-So, Chris, in 2014,
the American people

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.980
elected a Republican majority
in the Senate

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.250
put the brakes on President
Obama's judicial nominations.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.730
In 2018, we had a referendum
on this question.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.580
Just a month before
the 2018 midterms,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.860
we had the vote on
Justice Cavanaugh.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.450
There cannot have been
a clearer mandate

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.550
because the American people
didn't just re-elect

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.630
Republicans,
they expanded our majority.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.260
-If you look at history,
if you actually look

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.190
at what the president is,
this has happened 29 times.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.340
-29 times, Chuck,
there have been vacancies

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.430
in the year
of a presidential election.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.560
-Now, presidents have made
nominations all 29 times.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.660
That's what presidents do.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.630
-If the shoe were on
the other foot,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.340
and the Democrats had
the White House and the Senate,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.030
they would right now be trying

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.830
to confirm another member
of the Supreme Court.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.780
-They don't see any hypocrisy

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.980
between that position then
and this position now?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.880
-Chris, the Senate majority
is performing

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.000
our Constitutional duty

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.570
and fulfilling the mandate
the voters gave us.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.780
-So you guys have this
new explanation.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.540
Never once on the Senate floor

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.310
when an election
is just months away --

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.890
in 2016, you said, "The people
should be allowed to consider

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.390
possible Supreme Court nominees
as one factor in deciding

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.810
who they'll support
for president.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.610
This shouldn't even
really be controversial."

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.090
Then you said, "This is not
about the person,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.330
it's about
the principle involved,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.640
and I want to give the American
people a voice in this."

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.430
Republicans have said
there should not be

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.700
a bitter political fight.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.570
We have called on the president
to spare the country this fight.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.880
The best way to avoid the fight

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.360
is to agree to let
the people decide."

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.580
Senator, these are your words.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.580
Not once did you say,
"Oh, it depends on what party

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.190
the Senate holds versus
the party of the president.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.820
This just sounds like a power
grab, pure and simple.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.580
-Well, it is the Biden rule,
and this is the way --

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.890
this is the president
of the country --

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.110
-There is no Biden rule!

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.980
-Everyone knows that
if the president

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.920
were Joe Biden or Hillary
Clinton and Chuck Schumer

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.740
were the Majority Leader,
the odds are 100% -- 100% --

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.560
There's no universe
in which Nancy Pelosi

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.780
would not have been
the previous speaker, say,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.410
"We are going to confirm
this seat."
