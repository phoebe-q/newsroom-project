00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.800
This is a story about

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
how a historic dispute has become
part of a global power struggle.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
All the trend lines are pointing
towards escalation

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.000
and would make de-escalation
extremely difficult if it came

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.680
to blows in the Taiwan Strait.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.600 position:63%
If you go a couple of hundred kilometres
off the south east coast of China,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.520 position:56%
you reach Taiwan, an island
that behaves as an independent state

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.080
but which is considered by Beijing
as part of China.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.400
And this shows Taiwan's
air defence zone,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.960
which Chinese military planes
have increasingly entered,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.040
crossing an unofficial line
between mainland China and Taiwan.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.680
These incursions have risen
through the year, as you can see,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.120
and Taiwan says relations are worse
than for 40 years.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.360
When asked if China might invade,
this was the Taiwanese reply.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.400 position:63%
After 2025, they will be fully prepared.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400
That's our assessment.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.240
The US sees a threat too.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.800
The Wall Street Journal reported:

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.640
To which this is
the Chinese response.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.720
The Taiwan question is purely
China's internal affair.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.200
We will not tolerate
any outside interference.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480
Taiwan finds itself between
the tectonic plates of world power

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
and people there well understand
the position they’re in.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.680
We are a small island nation,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.280
so we are like a bargaining chip in
negotiations between big countries.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.760
For these reasons and more tensions
around Taiwan risk

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.640
disturbing the uneasy equilibrium
in the region and to understand

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.720
these current tensions we need
to go back to their roots in 1949.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.400
That’s when China’s nationalist
government was

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.560
defeated by the communists
and fled to Taiwan.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.880
By 1950, the island was
effectively independent.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.200
70 years on,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.280 position:58%
Taiwan, while once a dictatorship, is
now a democracy with press freedom.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.480
China meanwhile is
an oppressive single-party state.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.360 position:63%
Both have seen rapid economic growth,
and for its part Beijing says it will do

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.600
whatever's necessary
to get Taiwan back.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.920
That’s relevant when we listen
to this from President Xi.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.560
The Chinese people
will never allow foreign forces

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
to bully, oppress or enslave us.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.080
Anyone who dares to try
will have their heads bashed.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.040
This shift in tone can also be seen
with reference to Taiwan.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.360
Here's a cartoon in the
state-owned Global Times newspaper

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.640
depicting a Chinese invasion.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.360
Now, this may all just be
bombastic rhetoric.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.320 position:56%
But the context here is that Chinese
military power is growing rapidly.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.160
This is one of
Beijing's regular military parades.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.640 position:63%
The Chinese say their growth in military
spending since 1990 looks like this

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.040
and they say they'll spend more
than any other country bar America

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.920
in the coming 12 months.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.960
And China knows if it attacked
Taiwan, America is nearby.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.840 position:59%
We've seen the US and its allies carry
out exercises in the Philippine Sea

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.280
and there are US military bases
across the region.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.840
Also, remember this from September?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.160
The UK, US and Australia
signed a defence pact,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.960
in large part to counter China.
And in the middle of this

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.760
lies the US policy
of 'strategic ambiguity' on Taiwan.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.160
This means America has signalled
a willingness to defend Taiwan

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.040
but not said how.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.920
What is never said is
whether the United States would

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.080
in fact come
to Taiwan’s defence militarily

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.440
and it’s that ambiguity which
has been maintained for many years,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.880
that the whole delicate balance
rests on.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.280
And you can argue this has worked.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.520 position:56%
Taiwan's a prosperous democracy,
there’s been no conflict with China.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.000
So what’s changed now?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.840 position:58%
Why is China's leadership cranking up
the pressure?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.160
Well the first reason may be
Taiwan’s president,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.640
Tsai Ing-wen. She wants
Taiwan to be independent of China

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.320
and this pro-Beijing analyst argues
a message is being sent to her.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.600 position:58%
Taiwan’s progressive democratic party
is really calling for independence.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.480 position:56%
That is really very, very dangerous.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.040
So, I think the mainland has
to warn them and stop that.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.280
Huiyao Wang
also presents a second factor -

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.680
that China
is being unreasonably provoked.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.360 position:56%
It’s in response to so many aircraft

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.360
and different warships passing
through the Taiwan Strait

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.040 position:56%
and also, American military airplane
has landed at Taiwan.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.640
The third possible reason
for Chinese action comes from

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.600
retired US army General
Stanley McCrystal.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.800
Perhaps China is doing this now
because it can.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.480
It’s different than five,
or 10, or 20 years ago.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.080 position:56%
Because the Chinese military now has
enough credible power

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.440
to at least contest
with the United States

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.560 position:56%
over the potential defence of Taiwan
and that’s a very different dynamic.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.080
Beijing will be well aware
of this different dynamic.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.400
Not least because of Hong Kong.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.360
Last year China brought in
new laws there to change policing

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.760 position:56%
and freedom of speech, and despite
Western condemnation the law stayed.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.800
And that brings us back to Taiwan,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.560
and whether China may feel
emboldened to act.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.520
A prospect that was put to
the Biden adminstration by the BBC.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.040
Do you think
China will invade Taiwan?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.480 position:61%
I am not going to make any predictions,
what I am going to say is this.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.760
From the United States’ perspective

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.640
there are certain
fundamental obligations,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.280
and one of them is no unilateral
changes to the status quo.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.000
And this cuts to it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.480
Taiwan and the US
want the status quo.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.040
China does not.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.280 position:58%
And so Taiwan’s status has become a
test of the limits of America’s power

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.960
and the possibilities of China's.
