00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.074 position:77%
Nowhere in the world has escaped the coronavirus.

00:00:03.074 --> 00:00:08.094 position:97%
But why months into the pandemic are cases still surging in the United States?

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:14.005 position:98%
The first spike came in early April, driven by infections around New York

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.042 position:59%
as well as hotspots in the Deep South.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:20.085 position:97%
This second surge has now affected almost every part of the country.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.009 position:78%
Personally, I think that we've opened up too soon.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.003 position:80%
We thought we saw a light at the end of the tunnel,

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:27.049
but it turns out that was a train.

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:32.030 position:98%
Despite the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.050 position:97%
Some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly.

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:40.061 position:81%
So when did other countries lift their restrictions?

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:44.071 position:91%
Let's look at daily new cases in Germany, Italy and the UK

00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:46.091
and compare those to the US.

00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:49.068 position:66%
Germany eased its lockdowns in late April,

00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:52.005
followed by Italy in early May,

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.072
and the UK waited until mid June.

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:58.036 position:98%
What they have in common is all three countries were well below

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:04.026 position:97%
a recommended benchmark of less than four daily new cases per 100,000 residents.

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:06.093 position:67%
The US saw a slight decline in case numbers

00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:09.094 position:89%
but was not close to that benchmark when the first states

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:13.007 position:61%
let their lockdowns expire on April 30,

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:18.098 position:98%
nor by May 15, when half of Americans lived in states which had eased restrictions,

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:26.019 position:97%
and by May 31, when 47 states representing 90% of the population had lifted lockdowns,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.039 position:63%
cases were still above that dotted line.

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:35.056 position:98%
In mid June, as cases in Europe continued to decline, they surged in America.

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:38.090 position:80%
US politicians claimed it was down to more testing.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.014 position:83%
Yeah, when we do 85,000 tests, we're gonna have more.

00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:45.024 position:91%
We're doing 40,000 tests, we're gonna have less positives.

00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:49.054 position:97%
After a slow start, the US is testing more than other countries,

00:01:49.054 --> 00:01:52.011 position:56%
including Germany, Italy and the UK.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.065 position:98%
We're definitely testing more and finding more cases than before,

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:59.032 position:97%
but the key issue is that the percent positivity of test is also rising.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:02.079 position:97%
Telling you that cases are outstripping our increase in testing,

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.093
meaning the outbreak is expanding.

00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:08.080 position:94%
Experts say fewer than 5% of tests should come back positive

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.093 position:97%
for a country to be confident about the true extent of the outbreak.

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:15.094 position:81%
That's represented by the yellow line on this chart.

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:19.017 position:70%
Germany, Italy and the UK are all to the left

00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:23.028 position:92%
with positive results making up fewer than 5% of all tests.

00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:26.051 position:77%
However, the US is just to the right of the line,

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:28.042
in the danger zone marked red,

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:32.032 position:97%
which means the virus is not contained and reopening is risky.

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:33.082
Lab confirmed cases...

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:34.062
Public health...

00:02:34.062 --> 00:02:35.019
Six feet...

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.022
Cases down...

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.019
Wearing a mask...

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.086 position:94%
It's hard to compare the whole of the US to other countries.

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:45.003 position:98%
So let's see how individual states, Arizona, Florida and Texas,

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.000
fared on these measures.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.004 position:56%
We want to reinvigorate our economy.

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:53.067 position:97%
Well two out of three were in fact below the recommended threshold

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:56.038 position:63%
for new cases at the time they reopened.

00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:57.088
That's good.

00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:01.001 position:70%
However, when we look at the positivity rate,

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:06.002 position:98%
All three were well above that 5% benchmark when they reopened in the spring.

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.082 position:59%
That indicates a problem with testing.

00:03:08.082 --> 00:03:13.063 position:98%
Early on, experts told officials at least 500,000 tests per day

00:03:13.063 --> 00:03:16.080 position:67%
were required to safely reopen the country.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.023 position:67%
That's around 150 tests per 100,000 people.

00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:24.091 position:81%
Arizona, Florida and Texas were far below that level

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:27.041 position:64%
when they ease restrictions in the spring

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.061 position:78%
and have only now reached adequate testing levels.

00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:32.011
But that was too late.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.038 position:89%
Look at the positivity rates in the three states by July.

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:40.062 position:98%
There are in fact five benchmarks a state or region should meet

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:42.052
before lifting restrictions.

00:03:42.052 --> 00:03:47.063 position:97%
Besides low infection rates, robust testing and a small share of positive results,

00:03:47.063 --> 00:03:53.050 position:97%
they also include a two-week drop in cases and having enough ICU beds.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.077 position:97%
Arizona failed four out of those five benchmarks when it reopened.

00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:59.097
Texas three and Florida two.

00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.095
So how did other countries prepare

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:08.062 position:75%
for a potential surge in cases as they reopened?

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:11.045 position:69%
Well, Germany, for example, told its regions

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:17.019 position:97%
that 50 new cases per 100,000 residents in a week would trigger new restrictions

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.073
and a return to locked down life.

00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:24.100 position:98%
If the US applied that same benchmark of 50 cases per 100,000 people,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.047 position:97%
we see that 38 of the 50 states should return to lockdown now.

00:04:30.047 --> 00:04:34.094 position:98%
Nine states have introduced partial restrictions as of July 14,

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:38.051 position:83%
and 13 states have paused their reopening transition.

00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.031 position:83%
But can others learn the lessons from other countries

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:44.015 position:67%
who for now got the outbreak under control?
