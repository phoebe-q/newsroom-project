00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.610
-Well, you know, after he
was elected president,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.320
it was very much my hope that
he would rise to the occasion,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.640
rise to the mantle
of the office.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.940
And he has said
during the campaign

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.270
that he could be
extraordinary presidential.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.320
And I think that while
he spoke of that

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.540
and while
that was my hope,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.270
I don't think he's followed
through on that front

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.720
the way he's followed through on
some of his other promises.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.450
-On the first day of 2019,
Mitt Romney published an op-ed

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.780
that served as a scathing review
of President Trump's character

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.080
and marked another step

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.100
in the two Republicans'
up-and-down relationship.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.710
Romney is a former Republican
presidential candidate from Utah

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.720
who was recently elected
to the U.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.420
S.
Senate.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.360
Simply put in the op-ed,
Romney said the president

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.220
has not risen to
the mantle of the office,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.290
adding that Trump's words
and actions

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.950
have caused dismay
around the world.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.760
After reading the op-ed,
it's easy to forget that Romney

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.050
and Trump used to get along,
at least for a while.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.210
In 2012, Trump and Romney had
a seemingly good relationship.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.040
Trump even endorsed Romney's
run for president.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.150
In 2016, Romney changed his tone
on Trump,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.630
becoming one of his
most vocal critics.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.090
-Trump is a phony, a fraud.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.630
His promises are as worthless as
a degree from Trump University.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.190
-And Trump fired back
a few times, too.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.210
-The guy's a stone-cold loser.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.030
He choked,
and when you're a choker,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.570
you can never give a choker
a second chance.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.400
-But after Trump
was elected in 2016,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.580
the two were seen
dining together,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.380
appearing to make amends.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.280
Romney was reportedly
being considered

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.660
as Trump's
first Secretary of State.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.600
Since then, Romney has said

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.160
that he supports
a lot of Trump's policies.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.190
-President Trump is not
the person I wanted to become

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.760
the nominee of our party,
but he's president now.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.220
The policies he's promoted
have been pretty effective.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.720
-In the op-ed, Romney says
that in his role as a Senator,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
which begins January 3rd,
he will not comment

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.340
on "every tweet or fault,"

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.580
but he vows to speak out
against significant statements

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.260
or actions that are divisive,
racist, sexist, anti-immigrant,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.900
dishonest, or destructive
to democratic institutions.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.360
-Do you regret accepting
his endorsement

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.820
when he went that tweet
during your Senate race?

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.330
-He was endorsing me.
I wasn't endorsing him.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.490
And I haven't decided
who I'm gonna endorse in 2020.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.330
I'm gonna wait and see
what the alternatives are.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.370
-Well, I wish Mitt could be
more of a team player.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.010
You know, I'm surprised
he did it this quickly.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.120
I was expecting something,
but I'm surprised

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.980
he did it this quickly.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.450
But I think he's gonna end up
being a team player.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.980
I think he agrees with many
of the things that we've done

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.650
and many of the things
that we have in mind,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.350
and we'll see what happens.
