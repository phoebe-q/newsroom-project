00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.400
Luisa: Are we allowed to say bitches?
Lizzie: Are we allowed to say bitches?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.080
We don’t actually know.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.860
Luisa: Politics for bitches

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.540
Luisa: So it’s a stand-up show and it’s
called Politics for Bitches.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.340
The idea came

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.760
from that I hate politics, I find it so boring,
so unaccessible, genuinely could not care

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.859
less for it. And then so many things started
happening last year, you know and like Trump

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.280
got elected and the Brexit things and then
I just realised I was like I’ve got no idea

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.129
what any of this means and like I feel like
you need a dictionary or a thesaurus to watch

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.269
a programme like Question Time or to watch
a YouTube video even on what’s a referendum

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.839
mean. And then sadly my mum last year she
passed away from cancer

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.740
Luisa: I called 999, I called 111, I called
every help line I could think of to support

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.640
my mum. And it got to the point where I went
to the oncologist and he said there’s no

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.360
helping your mum.
Luisa: So I started talking about this on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.620
stage and being like oh, for me I thought
politics was oh those guys in Westminster

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.840
that doesn’t affect me, I’m just trying
to figure out how to contour, live my best

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.540
life mate. And then it did affect me because
my mum died and she died horribly, and I was

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
like the system wasn’t there to aid her
or support her

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.630
Luisa: I said please there must be something
you can do, it’s 2017, some body cannot

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.790
die like this. They said there’s nothing
we can do. Your mum will go home to die. My

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.280
mum paid taxes her entire life, she did not
deserve the ending that she had.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.760
Luisa: It doesn’t sound very funny, I mean
it wasn’t for a long time, but then by using

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.520
comedy and using the audiences and their experience
I’ve turned it into a comedy show.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.930
Lizzie: So tell me about that, what have you
learnt?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.670
Luisa: Well I’ve learnt that the Tory Party
and the Conservative Party are actually the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
same thing. That’s the one thing that I’ve
learnt. Because for a while there I thought

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.720
they were two separate guys.
Lizzie: Ok, we’re starting from quite a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.620
low knowledge level.
Luisa: Dude, this is the thing, because I

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.000
think people are too scared to be called stupid.
I didn’t know who Margaret Thatcher was

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.330
for a long time. I thought she was like a
popstar in the 80s, didn’t realise, listen

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.260
it wasn’t my fault…
Lizzie: So Duran Duran, Margaret Thatcher

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.110
…
Luisa: I didn’t know, I was into Cher. Anyway,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.240
in my first show, Beyonce, I did this whole
skit about how I accidentally went online,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.800
I watched The Iron Lady, I thought she was
a very powerful woman, and I said I love Margaret

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.510
Thatcher online. Oh my dear, never put that
on your Facebook status, because boy did I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.459
get an education. And then I was on the front
of like the Telegraph being like this is the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.760
face of right-wing comedy, it was me and I
was like I don’t even know what right-wing

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.360
is mate so ….
Lizzie: Why do you think that politics, a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.960
lot of young people, a lot of young women
aren’t engaged in politics. Why don’t

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.099
you think they pay attention?
Luisa: Because it’s purposefully unaccessible..

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.880
Lizzie: You think it’s deliberately inaccessible
Luisa: Mate totally, totally, because politics

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.050
in itself, not deliberately in terms of we’re
going to make it so complicated so you don’t

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.410
understand, but by so many people getting
into it they get into their own heads with

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.850
it and by getting so up themselves they’ve
lost track of going actually the more you

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.660
know about it the more it’s your duty to
share that information with people that don’t,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.459
because politics affects everybody.
Lizzie: And how do we encourage more people

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.110
to get into politics then, how do we encourage
more people to think then yeah, I could be

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.290
an MP?
Luisa: I think it’s empowering everyday

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.460
people just to realise their importance and
rather than it being us Westminster and you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.630
people saying you don’t worry about that,
I think that’s very much also a London-centric

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.270
thing, London’s its own entity and all the
rest of the UK just has to put up and shut

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.720
up and deal with it, whereas London makes
all the decisions, London gets everything.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.990
And actually there is a, there’s millions
of other people out there that are working

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.959
every day, that are working hard, that are
paying their taxes, and it would be nice to

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.180
get those voices in. But it’s funnier than
it sounds.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.599
Lizzie: The show is funny.
Luisa: There are some jokes in there. Very

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.299
exciting, yeah.
Lizzie: That’s brilliant. Luisa thanks very

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.560
much.
Luisa: Thanks for having me.
