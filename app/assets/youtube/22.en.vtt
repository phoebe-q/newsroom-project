00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.520
We are like a tower like a radar station in the air.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.340
lieutenant Colonel Thomas R from the
German air force, flying with Nato Awacs

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.720
and the aircraft commander of today's
flight and our mission today is to fly

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.460
from Konya towards the turkish-syrian
border

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.480
and we fly in orbit there

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.470
for several hours so our mission crew
can have a look into the Syrian airspace

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.040
to see what is actually flying in Syria
right now

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.900
but is a depiction of the Syrian border
you can see in red

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.520
we are flying right here

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.560
My Name is Andy I'm a surveillance
operator on board Awacs and an instructor.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.470
you can really see in the last two years by a
joint effort done by the coalition that

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.910
Isis has really been isolated in very
very tiny positions and that shows you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.090
that the joint effort that we have done
here in the last two years has really

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.410
worked and also you can see that there's
less air from air movements nowadays

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.880
which is also a sign that the operation
here is successful

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.980
