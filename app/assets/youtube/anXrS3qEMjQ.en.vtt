 Mister Speaker , Mr. Vice 
President,  members of Congress,

00:53:54.242 --> 00:53:56.242
 my fellow Americans

00:53:58.172 --> 00:54:00.172
, today

00:54:06.282 --> 00:54:07.711
, America, a teacher spent extra
 time with a student who needed 

00:54:07.712 --> 00:54:10.161
it and did her part to lift 
America's graduation rate to the

00:54:10.162 --> 00:54:12.162
 highest levels in more than 
three decades.

00:54:14.625 --> 00:54:18.765
 An entrepreneur flipped on the 
lights in a tech 

00:54:24.475 --> 00:54:26.224

add to the more 8 million new 

00:54:26.225 --> 00:54:27.464
jobs are businesses have created
 over the past four years.

most fuel-efficient cars in the 

00:54:37.485 --> 00:54:41.992
world and did his part to help 
America win itself off of 

00:54:42.292 --> 00:54:47.207
foreign oil. A farmer prepared 
for the spring after the 

00:54:47.467 --> 00:54:50.087
strongest five-year stretch of 
farm exports in our history.

 A rural doctor gave a young 
child the first prescription to 

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:58.156

could afford.

 MM took the bus home from his 
graveyard shift, bone tired, but

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.449
 dreaming big dreams for his 
son. And a tightknit community, 

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:20.461
all across America, fathers, 
mothers will talk in their kids,

00:55:20.462 --> 00:55:22.462
 put an arm around their spouse

00:55:27.502 --> 00:55:28.841
, remember fallen comrades, and 
give thanks for being home from 

00:55:28.842 --> 00:55:32.772
a war that after 12 long years 
is finally coming to an end.

&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

00:55:48.795 --> 00:55:50.795
&gt;&gt;

00:55:56.075 --> 00:55:57.384
 Tonight, this chamber speaks 
with one voice to the people we 

00:55:57.385 --> 00:56:02.655
represent. It is you, our 
citizens, who make the state of 

00:56:02.835 --> 00:56:07.515
our union strong.
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

00:56:11.055 --> 00:56:14.477
&gt;&gt; And here are the results of 
your efforts. The lowest 

00:56:14.567 --> 00:56:18.416
unemployment rate in over five 
years, a rebounding housing work

00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:20.417
 it

00:56:25.277 --> 00:56:26.756
 -- market, a manufacturing 
sector adding jobs for the first

00:56:26.757 --> 00:56:28.757
 time since the 1990s, more oil 
produced,

00:56:30.947 --> 00:56:32.566
 more oil produced at home then 
we buy from the rest of the 

00:56:32.567 --> 00:56:36.217
world, the first -- happened in 
nearly 20 years.

00:56:39.707 --> 00:56:42.697
 Our deficits, cut by more than 
half. And for the first time

00:56:46.252 --> 00:56:49.432
, for the first time in over a 
decade, business leaders around 

00:56:49.562 --> 00:56:51.562
the world have to cleared

00:56:53.072 --> 00:56:54.571
 that China is no longer the 
world's number one place to 

00:56:54.572 --> 00:56:59.772
invest, America is.
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

00:56:59.862 --> 00:57:01.862
&gt;&gt;

00:57:15.327 --> 00:57:16.656
 That's why I believe this can 
be a breakthrough year for 

00:57:16.657 --> 00:57:19.127
America. After five years of

00:57:22.737 --> 00:57:23.826
 grit and determined effort, the
 United States is better 

00:57:23.827 --> 00:57:29.827
positioned for the 21st century 
than any other nation on earth. 

00:57:29.927 --> 00:57:33.507
The question for everyone in 
this chamber, running through 

00:57:33.597 --> 00:57:36.977
every decision we make this year
 is whether we are going to help

00:57:38.627 --> 00:57:40.627
 or hinder this progress.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.910
 For several years now, this 
time has been consumed by a 

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:50.790
argument over the proper size of
 the federal government. It is 

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.480
an important debate. One that 
dates back to our very founding.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.709
 When that debate prevents us 
from carrying out even the most 

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:04.640
basic functions of our 
democracy, when our differences 

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.730
shut down government

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.030
 or threaten the full faith and 
credit of the United States, 

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:13.130
then we are not doing right by 
the American people.

00:58:18.692 --> 00:58:20.692
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;

00:58:32.172 --> 00:58:33.281
 Now, as President, I'm 
committed to making Washington 

00:58:33.282 --> 00:58:34.651
work better and rebuilding the 
trust of the people who sent us 

00:58:34.652 --> 00:58:43.021
here.  I believe that most of 
you are, too. Last month, due to

00:58:43.022 --> 00:58:45.022
 the work of the Congress,

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:50.589
 we undid some of the severe 
cuts to priorities like 

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:51.799
education. Nobody got everything
 they wanted and we can still do

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.010
 more to invest in this 
country's future while bringing 

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.990
down our deficit in a balanced 
way, but the budget compromise 

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.540
should

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.669
 lead us to a focus on creating 
new jobs, not creating new 

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:08.520
crisis. And in the coming months
 [ Applause ]

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.389
, in the coming months, let's 
see where else we can make 

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.952
progress together. Let's make 
this a year of action. That's 

00:59:17.092 --> 00:59:20.702
what most Americans want. For 
all of us in this chamber to 

00:59:20.982 --> 00:59:26.542
focus on their lives, their 
hopes, their aspirations.

00:59:31.472 --> 00:59:32.761
 And what I believe unites the 
people of this nation, 

00:59:32.762 --> 00:59:34.942
regardless of race, region or 
party, young or old, rich or 

00:59:35.032 --> 00:59:41.642
poor, is the simple profound 
belief in opportunity for all. 

00:59:41.782 --> 00:59:44.325
The notion that if you work hard
 and take responsibility, you 

00:59:44.455 --> 00:59:47.945
can get ahead in America. 
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

00:59:48.295 --> 00:59:50.295
&gt;&gt;

00:59:53.845 --> 00:59:58.275
 Let's face it, that belief has 
suffered some serious blows.

01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:03.514
 For more than three decades, 
even before the great recession 

01:00:03.515 --> 01:00:05.515
hit,

01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:08.544
 massive shifts in technology 
and global competition had 

01:00:08.545 --> 01:00:12.444
eliminated a lot of good 
middle-class jobs and weaken the

01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:14.445
 economic foundations that 
families depend on.

01:00:19.088 --> 01:00:20.097
 Today, after four years of 
economic growth, corporate 

01:00:20.098 --> 01:00:23.048
profits and stock prices have 
rarely been higher and those at 

01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:25.918
the top have never done better. 
But, average wages have 

01:00:26.268 --> 01:00:30.068
thoroughly botched -- budged, 
and

01:00:33.868 --> 01:00:37.507
 inequality has deepened, upper 
mobility has installed. The cold

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:39.508
 hard fact is that even in the 
midst of recovery,

01:00:42.098 --> 01:00:43.757
 too many Americans are working 
more than ever just to get by, 

01:00:43.758 --> 01:00:47.150
let alone to get ahead. And too 
many still are not working at 

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.249
all. 
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.520
&gt;&gt; So, our job is to reverse 
these trends

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:56.869
. It won't happen right away, 
and we won't agree on 

01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:02.250
everything. But what I offer 
tonight is a set of concrete 

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400
practical proposals to speed up 
growth

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.979
, strengthen the middle class 
and build new ladders of 

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.980
opportunity into the middle 
class.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.109
 Some require congressional 
action. And I'm eager to work 

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.110
with all of you.

01:01:22.368 --> 01:01:23.717
 But, America does not stand 
still and neither will I. So, 

01:01:23.718 --> 01:01:25.718
wherever and whenever, I can 
take steps without legislation

01:01:27.678 --> 01:01:29.047
 to expand opportunity for more 
American families, that is what 

01:01:29.048 --> 01:01:30.247
I'm going to do. 
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

01:01:30.248 --> 01:01:32.248
&gt;&gt;

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:46.160
 As usual, our first lady sets a
 good example.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.140

 Michelle's  Let's Mover -- Move
 Partnership with schools and 

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.020
businesses has

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:20.534
 brought down the child obesity 
rate for the first time in 30 

01:02:20.535 --> 01:02:22.535
years, and achievement that will
 improve lives and reduce 

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:25.205
healthcare costs for decades to 
come. The joining forces 

01:02:25.335 --> 01:02:29.065
aligning, Michele and Biden, 
have watched

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:34.584
 the training of over 400,000 
veterans and military spouses.

&gt;&gt;

01:02:41.465 --> 01:02:43.465
 Taking a page from the 
playbook,

01:02:46.668 --> 01:02:47.797
 the White House organized a 
college opportunity Summit were 

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:50.177
already 150 universities, 
businesses, nonprofits have made

01:02:50.178 --> 01:02:54.078
 concrete commitments to reduce 
inequality and access to higher 

01:02:54.178 --> 01:02:58.138
education and health every 
hard-working kid go to college 

01:02:58.258 --> 01:03:00.938
and succeed when they get -- and
 across the country.

01:03:05.098 --> 01:03:06.127
 We are partnering with mayors, 
governors and state legislature 

01:03:06.128 --> 01:03:10.868
on issues from homelessness to 
marriage equality. The point is,

01:03:13.258 --> 01:03:15.258
 there are millions of Americans
 outside of Washington who are 

01:03:15.598 --> 01:03:19.050
tired of stale political 
arguments and are moving this 

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:21.570
country forward.

01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:26.970
 They believe, and I believe, 
that here in America, our 

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.160
success should depend not on --

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.389
 of birth, but the strength of 
our work ethic and scope of our 

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.390
dreams. That is what drew our 
forebears here.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.979
 That's how the daughter of a 
factory worker is CEO of 

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.550
America's largest automaker.
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]

speaker of the house.

 Opportunity is who we are.

01:04:37.235 --> 01:04:40.805
 And a defining project of our 
generation must be to restore 

01:04:41.395 --> 01:04:46.200
that promise. We know where to 
start. The best measure of 

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.143
opportunity is access to a good 
job.

01:04:55.953 --> 01:04:57.132
 With the economy picking up 
speed, companies today intend to

01:04:57.133 --> 01:04:58.412
 hire more people this year and 
over half of big manufacturers 

01:04:58.413 --> 01:05:01.723
say they are thinking of in 
sourcing jobs from abroad.

01:05:07.423 --> 01:05:09.423
 So, let's make that decision 
easier for more companies.

01:05:12.223 --> 01:05:13.732
 Both Democrats and Republicans 
have argued that our tax code is

01:05:13.733 --> 01:05:16.905
 riddled with wasteful, 
complicated loopholes that 

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:19.655
punish businesses investing here
 and reward companies that keep

01:05:23.265 --> 01:05:25.084
 profits abroad. Let's split 
that equation and work together 

01:05:25.085 --> 01:05:27.085
to close those loopholes

01:05:30.895 --> 01:05:32.494
 and those who invented the ship
 jobs overseas and lower tax 

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:34.154
rates for businesses to create 
jobs right here at home.

01:05:48.258 --> 01:05:50.877
 Moreover, we can take the money
 we save from this transition to

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:52.878
 tax reform

01:05:54.438 --> 01:05:56.307
 to create jobs, rebuilding our 
roads, upgrading our ports, 

01:05:56.308 --> 01:05:59.768
unclogging our commutes, because
 in today's global economy, 

01:05:59.848 --> 01:06:03.318
first class jobs gravitate to 
first-class infrastructure.

01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.537
 We will need Congress to 
protect more than 3 million jobs

01:06:11.538 --> 01:06:12.737
 by finessing transportation and
 water waste bills this summer. 

01:06:12.738 --> 01:06:17.243
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ]
&gt;&gt; That can happen. But, I will 

01:06:17.383 --> 01:06:19.383
act on my own

01:06:21.423 --> 01:06:22.672
 2/bureaucracy and streamline 
the permitting process for key 

01:06:22.673 --> 01:06:26.622
projects so we can get more 
instructional workers on the job

01:06:26.623 --> 01:06:29.723
 as fast as possible.

01:06:37.283 --> 01:06:39.022
 We also have a chance right now
 to beat other countries in the 

01:06:39.023 --> 01:06:41.503
race for the next wave of 
high-tech manufacturing jobs.

01:06:46.633 --> 01:06:47.847
 And my administration has 
launched two hubs for high-tech 

01:06:47.848 --> 01:06:49.848
manufacturing in Raleigh, North 
Carolina and

01:06:52.038 --> 01:06:53.337
 Ohio where we have connected 
businesses to universities who 

01:06:53.338 --> 01:06:55.338
can help

01:06:57.858 --> 01:06:59.067
 America lead the world in 
advanced technologies. Tonight, 

01:06:59.068 --> 01:07:00.767
I'm announcing that we will 
watch this more this year. 

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:03.637
Bipartisan bills in both houses 
could double the number of these

01:07:03.638 --> 01:07:05.638
 hubs

01:07:08.948 --> 01:07:10.717
 and the jobs they create. So, 
get those bills to my desk. Put 

01:07:10.718 --> 01:07:13.538
more Americans back to work.

01:07:26.071 --> 01:07:27.190
 Let's do more to help the 
entrepreneurs and small-business

01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:29.761
 owners to create most of the 
jobs in America.

01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:34.780
 Over the past five years, my 
administration has made more 

01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:37.771
loans to small business owners 
than any other and when 98% of 

01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:41.641
our exporters are small 
businesses, new trade 

01:07:41.741 --> 01:07:45.541
partnerships with Europe and the
 Asia-Pacific will help them 

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.661
create even more jobs.

01:07:50.213 --> 01:07:51.402
 We need to work together on 
tools like bipartisan trade 

01:07:51.403 --> 01:07:53.403
promotion authority

01:07:54.878 --> 01:07:56.207
 to protect our workers, to 
protect our environment and open

01:07:56.208 --> 01:08:00.588
 new markets to new goods,

01:08:16.708 --> 01:08:17.860
 Listen, China and Europe are 
standing on the sidelines and 

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:19.861
neither should we.

01:08:22.471 --> 01:08:23.870
 We know that the nation that 
goes all in on innovation today 

01:08:23.871 --> 01:08:25.871
will own the global economy 
tomorrow.

01:08:28.511 --> 01:08:31.781
 This is an edge America cannot 
surrender. Federally funded 

01:08:31.861 --> 01:08:33.861
research

01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:36.352
 helped lead to the ideas and 
inventions behind Google and 

01:08:36.353 --> 01:08:38.353
smart phones

01:08:40.696 --> 01:08:42.015
 and that's why Congress should 
undo the damage done by last 

01:08:42.016 --> 01:08:45.187
year's cuts to basic research, 
so we can unleash the next Great

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:47.188

 And let's pass a pound reform 
bill that allows our businesses 

01:09:15.006 --> 01:09:17.346
to stay focused on innovation,

 Now, one of the biggest factors
 in bringing more jobs back is 

01:09:31.173 --> 01:09:33.173
our commitment to American 
energy.

01:09:35.643 --> 01:09:36.982
 The all of the above energy 
strategy I announced a few years

01:09:36.983 --> 01:09:40.683
 ago is working and today, 
America is closer to energy 

01:09:40.773 --> 01:09:42.472
independence that we have been 
in decades.

01:09:48.213 --> 01:09:50.213
 One of the reasons why is 
natural gas.

01:09:56.468 --> 01:09:57.787
 If extracted safely, it's the 
bridge fuel that can power our 

01:09:57.788 --> 01:09:58.967
economy with less of the carbon 
pollution that causes climate 

01:09:58.968 --> 01:10:00.968

 Businesses plan to invest 
almost $100 billion in new 

01:10:05.018 --> 01:10:08.638
factories that use natural gas. 
I will cover a -- to help

01:10:17.638 --> 01:10:18.980
 states get those factories 
built and put folks to work in

putting people to work building 

01:10:20.211 --> 01:10:21.310

cars and trucks from foreign oil

01:10:21.311 --> 01:10:23.521

will keep working with the

and jobs growth while

with a smarter tax policy that 

01:11:17.396 --> 01:11:19.791
stops giving $4 billion a year 
to fossil fuel industries that 

01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:24.901

01:11:37.581 --> 01:11:41.681
 And even as we have increased 
energy production, we have 

01:11:41.771 --> 01:11:43.720
partnered with businesses, 
builders and local communities 

01:11:43.721 --> 01:11:45.721
to reduce the energy we consume

01:11:52.453 --> 01:11:53.592
. When we rescued our 
automakers, for example, we 

01:11:53.593 --> 01:11:54.772
worked with them to set higher 
fuel efficiency standards for 

01:11:54.773 --> 01:11:58.804
our cars. In the coming months, 
I will build on that success by 

01:11:58.904 --> 01:12:00.513
setting new standards for our 
trucks so we can keep driving 

01:12:00.514 --> 01:12:05.104
down oil imports and what we pay
 at the pump. And

01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:11.933
 taken together, our energy 
policy is creating jobs and 

01:12:11.934 --> 01:12:13.934
leading to a cleaner, safer 
planet.

01:12:15.604 --> 01:12:17.183
 Over the past eight years, the 
United States has reduced our 

01:12:17.184 --> 01:12:19.955

 any other nation on earth.

01:12:27.646 --> 01:12:29.646
 But we have to act with more 
urgency.

01:12:32.466 --> 01:12:33.425
 Because a changing climate is 
already harming Western

drought and coastal cities

01:12:40.236 --> 01:12:41.615
 That is why I directed my 
administration to work with 

01:12:41.616 --> 01:12:45.076
states, utilities and others to 
set new standards on the amount 

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:47.406
of carbon pollution our power 
plants are allowed to dump into

 The shift to a cleaner energy 
economy won't happen overnight

 choices along the way. But the 

01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:02.601

01:14:56.624 --> 01:14:58.624
how to do it.

firm in Detroit.

 She knew that Ford needed parts
 for the best-selling truck in 

01:15:11.624 --> 01:15:13.373

 those parts. She just needed 

01:15:13.374 --> 01:15:15.374

01:16:44.206 --> 01:16:46.206
workforce faster by reforming

01:16:48.806 --> 01:16:50.115
 unemployment insurance so that 
it's more effective in today's 

01:16:50.116 --> 01:16:52.116
economy. But first,

01:16:55.079 --> 01:16:56.328
 this Congress needs to restore 
the unemployment insurance you 

01:16:56.329 --> 01:17:00.359
just let expire 41.6 million 
people. --

01:17:04.939 --> 01:17:08.499
 for 1.6 million people.

 -- mother of two young boys. 
She has been

01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:32.470
 unemployed since a teenager, 
she has never collected 

01:17:32.471 --> 01:17:34.471
unemployment benefits, she had 
paid her taxes

01:17:37.211 --> 01:17:38.790
, MA, she and her husband used 
their life savings to buy their 

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.560
first home. A week later, budget
 cuts claimed the jobs that she 

01:17:40.561 --> 01:17:42.561
loved.

01:17:44.681 --> 01:17:45.770
 Last month, when their 
unemployment insurance was cut 

01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:49.231
off, she sat down and wrote me a
 letter, the kind I get every 

01:17:49.321 --> 01:17:51.321

01:17:53.024 --> 01:17:55.617
 We are the face of the 
unemployment crisis, she wrote. 

01:17:55.987 --> 01:17:59.837
I am not dependent on the 
government, our country depends 

01:17:59.927 --> 01:18:03.587
on people like us to build 
careers. Contribute to society.

will find a job, I will pay my

01:18:13.957 --> 01:18:15.276
 and we will raise our children 
in their own home in the

us this chance.

01:18:48.839 --> 01:18:50.338
 That's why I have been asking 
CEOs to give more long-term 

01:18:50.339 --> 01:18:53.372
unemployed workers a fair shot 
at new jobs, a new chance to 

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:55.542
support their families

01:18:57.612 --> 01:18:59.131
. And in fact, this week, many 
will come to the White House to 

01:18:59.132 --> 01:19:01.132
make that commitment real.

01:19:02.642 --> 01:19:03.871

also have to prepare tomorrow's 
workforce. I guarantee

 Five years ago, we set out to 
change the odds for all of our 

01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:18.899
kids.

01:20:22.049 --> 01:20:23.393
 We worked with lenders to 
reform student loans and today, 

01:20:23.394 --> 01:20:24.373
more young people are earning 
college degrees than ever 

01:20:24.374 --> 01:20:26.374
before.

 Race to the top, with the help 
of governors from both parties, 

01:20:31.272 --> 01:20:33.272
have help states raise 
expectations and performance.

01:20:36.052 --> 01:20:36.941
 Teachers and principals in 
schools from Tennessee to 

01:20:36.942 --> 01:20:39.772
Washington DC are making big 
strides in preparing students 

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:42.392
with the skills for the new 
economy. Problem solving,

critical thinking, science, 
technology, and generic, math. 

01:20:51.557 --> 01:20:54.263
And some of those changes are 
hard. It requires everything for

01:20:54.264 --> 01:20:58.669
 more challenging curriculum and
 more demanding parents to 

01:20:58.759 --> 01:21:02.127
better support for teachers. And
 new ways to measure how well 

01:21:02.414 --> 01:21:06.059
our kids think, not how well 
they can fill in a bubble on a 

01:21:06.157 --> 01:21:09.467
test. But, it is worth it. And 
it is working.

01:21:12.877 --> 01:21:18.670
 The problem is, we're still not
 reaching enough kids. And it 

01:21:18.827 --> 01:21:20.827
has to change.

01:21:26.017 --> 01:21:27.619

can make in a child's life is 

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:31.310

 Last year, I ask this Congress 
to help states make high-quality

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.397
 pre-K available to every 
4-year-old. And as a parent as 

01:21:50.398 --> 01:21:52.398
well as a

01:21:57.153 --> 01:21:58.367
 President, I will repeat that 
request tonight. But in the 

01:21:58.368 --> 01:21:59.554
meantime, 30 requests have 
raised pre-K funding on their 

01:21:59.555 --> 01:22:03.448
own.  They know we can't wait. 
So just as we work with states 

01:22:03.573 --> 01:22:05.573
to reform our schools,

01:22:08.903 --> 01:22:10.154
 this here, we will invest in 
new partnerships with states and

01:22:10.155 --> 01:22:11.599

in a race to the top for our 

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600
youngest children

01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:19.245

it is going to do, I'm going to 

01:22:19.246 --> 01:22:20.222
pull together a coalition of 
elected officials, business 

01:22:20.223 --> 01:22:22.625

willing to help market access to

01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:24.626

need. It is

won't be complete and too many

 they still make $.77 for every 
dollar that a man earns. That is

01:24:46.483 --> 01:24:52.255

achieve incredible success. And 
that is what America is all

 In the years since I asked this
 Congress to raise the minimum 

01:27:02.235 --> 01:27:03.711

 own.

intend to lead by example.

Miller have a bill to fix that 

01:29:09.787 --> 01:29:11.787
by lifting the minimum wage to 
$10.10. It's easy to remember.

01:29:16.374 --> 01:29:17.481
 This will help families, give 
business customers with more 

01:29:17.482 --> 01:29:20.067
money to spend, it does not 
involve any new bureaucratic 

01:29:20.195 --> 01:29:25.932

the country, say yes, give 

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:29.330

01:29:46.202 --> 01:29:47.889
 There are steps we can take to 
help them least make ends meet. 

01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:49.890
And

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:55.592
 if you are more effective at 
reducing inequality and helping 

01:29:55.593 --> 01:29:56.559
families pull themselves up 
through hard work than the 

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.288
earned income tax credit. And 
right now, it helps half of all 

01:30:00.378 --> 01:30:03.898
parents at some point. Think 
about that. It helps about half 

01:30:03.993 --> 01:30:07.012
of all periods in America at 
some point in their lives. But I

01:30:07.013 --> 01:30:09.013
 agree with Republicans like 
Senator.  Rubio,

01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:15.092
 that it does not do enough for 
single workers who don't have 

01:30:15.093 --> 01:30:17.568
kids. So, let's work together to
 strengthen the credit, reward 

01:30:17.655 --> 01:30:19.655
works, help more Americans get 
ahead.

01:30:21.383 --> 01:30:24.698
 Let's do more to help Americans
 save for retirement. Today, 

01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:26.791
most workers don't have a 
pension.

01:30:28.998 --> 01:30:30.998
 A Social Security check often 
isn't enough on its own.

01:30:33.736 --> 01:30:35.115
 And while the stock market has 
doubled over the last five 

01:30:35.116 --> 01:30:41.138
years, that doesn't help folks 
that don't have 401(k)s. That's 

01:30:41.276 --> 01:30:44.740
why tomorrow, I'll direct the 
treasury to create a new way for

01:30:44.741 --> 01:30:46.741
 working Americans to start 
their own retirement.

 no risk of losing what you put 

01:31:04.524 --> 01:31:06.500
in and if this Congress wants to
 help, work with me to fix an

upside down

01:31:12.679 --> 01:31:14.273
 tax code that gives big breaks 
to help the wealthy states, but 

01:31:14.274 --> 01:31:16.989
does little or nothing for metal
 class Americans. Offer every

just like every American on this

 One last point on financial

 few things exposed hard-working
 families to economic hardship. 

01:32:03.154 --> 01:32:05.154
More than a broken healthcare 
system.

we are in the process of fixing 

01:32:09.104 --> 01:32:11.104
that.

surgery would have meant they 
Cropsey. That is what healthcare

01:32:50.879 --> 01:32:54.111
 reform is all about. The peace 
of mind that if misfortune 

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:59.501
strikes, you don't have to lose 
everything. Already, because of 

01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:01.591
the

 I know that the American people
 are not interested in 

01:34:30.977 --> 01:34:34.187
refighting old battles. So, 
again, if you have specific 

01:34:34.277 --> 01:34:39.447

people, increased choice, tell

not just what we are against. 
And if you want to know the real

01:35:37.139 --> 01:35:40.669
 impact this has had, just talk 
to the governor of Kentucky who 

01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:45.009
is here tonight. Now, Kentucky 
is not the most liberal part of

outstanding military alone.

01:43:13.557 --> 01:43:14.776
 As commander-in-chief, I have 
used force when needed to 

01:43:14.777 --> 01:43:18.927
protect the American people. And
 I will never hesitate to do so 

01:43:19.007 --> 01:43:21.007
as long as I hold this office.

01:43:22.817 --> 01:43:24.536
 But, I will not send our troops
 into harm's way unless it is 

01:43:24.537 --> 01:43:26.537
truly necessary

01:43:27.997 --> 01:43:29.538
, nor will I allow our sons and 
daughters to be mired in 

01:43:29.539 --> 01:43:32.652
open-ended complex. We must 
fight the battles that need to 

01:43:32.752 --> 01:43:38.482
be fought. Not those that 
terrorist prefer to us. 

01:43:38.582 --> 01:43:39.541
Large-scale deployments that 
drain our strength and may 

01:43:39.542 --> 01:43:42.622
ultimately these extremists.

01:43:46.942 --> 01:43:48.051
 So even as we actively and 
aggressively pursue terrorist 

01:43:48.052 --> 01:43:50.052
networks

01:43:51.402 --> 01:43:52.571
 through more targeted efforts 
and by building the capacity of 

01:43:52.572 --> 01:43:56.352
our foreign partners, America 
must move on a per minute

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:02.734
 war footing.
&gt;&gt;

01:44:06.724 --> 01:44:08.023
 [ Applause ] That's why I've 
imposed prudent limits on the 

01:44:08.024 --> 01:44:10.024
use of drones.  For we will not 
be safer

01:44:12.984 --> 01:44:14.203
 if people abroad believe we 
strike within their countries 

01:44:14.204 --> 01:44:16.204
without regard for the 
consequence.

01:44:18.564 --> 01:44:19.733
 That's why working with this 
Congress, I will reform our 

01:44:19.734 --> 01:44:21.734
surveillance programs because

01:44:23.434 --> 01:44:24.453
 the vital work of our 
intelligence community depends 

01:44:24.454 --> 01:44:29.499
on public confidence here and 
abroad that privacy of ordinary 

01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:32.049
people is not being violated.

01:44:36.879 --> 01:44:43.689
 And, with the Afghan war ended,
 this needs to be the year that 

01:44:43.829 --> 01:44:47.529
Congress lifts the remaining 
restrictions on detaining 

01:44:47.619 --> 01:44:49.899
transfers and we close the 
prison at one time okay. -- At

01:44:54.159 --> 01:44:56.789
 Guantanamo Bay, because we 
counterterrorism

01:45:01.224 --> 01:45:02.363
 I remain true to our 
constitutional ideal and setting

01:45:02.364 --> 01:45:06.524
 an example for the rest of the 
world. You see, in a world of 

01:45:06.884 --> 01:45:13.155
complex threats, our security, 
our leadership depends on all 

01:45:13.245 --> 01:45:16.895
elements of our power. Including
 strong and principled 

01:45:16.985 --> 01:45:18.985
diplomacy.

01:45:24.795 --> 01:45:25.984
 American diplomacy has rallied 
more than 50 countries to 

01:45:25.985 --> 01:45:28.605
prevent nuclear materials from 
falling into the wrong hands. 

01:45:28.695 --> 01:45:29.929
And allowed us to reduce our own
 alliance on Cold War 

01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:31.970
stockpiles. American diplomacy,

01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:37.019
 backed by the threat of force 
is why serious chemical weapons 

01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:40.660
are being illuminated -- 
eliminated.

&gt;&gt; [ Applause ] 

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.319
&gt;&gt; And we will continue to work 
with the international community

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.980
 to usher in the future that 
Syrian people deserve, a future 

01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:54.110
free of dictatorship, terror and
 fear.

01:45:56.730 --> 01:45:57.869
 As we speak, American diplomacy
 is supporting Israelis and 

01:45:57.870 --> 01:45:59.870
Palestinians

01:46:01.752 --> 01:46:02.851
, as they engage in the 
difficult but necessary talks to

01:46:02.852 --> 01:46:06.616
 end the conflict there. To 
achieve dignity. And independent

01:46:06.617 --> 01:46:08.617
 states for Palestinians. And 
lasting peace

01:46:13.387 --> 01:46:14.836
 for the secure state of Israel,
 a Jewish state that knows 

01:46:14.837 --> 01:46:18.437
America will always be at their 
side.

&gt;&gt; [ Applause ] 

01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.420
 And it is American diplomacy 
backed by pressure

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.329
 that has halted the progress of
 Iran's nuclear program and 

01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:44.000
rolled back part of the program 
for the very first time in a 

01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:46.090
decade.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:49.480
 As we gather here tonight,

01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:53.839
 I Ron has begun to eliminate 
its stockpile of higher levels 

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:57.480
of enriched uranium. It's not 
installing advanced centrifuges

01:47:01.392 --> 01:47:04.971
. Unprecedented inspections help
 the world verify every day that

01:47:04.972 --> 01:47:06.972
 I Ron is not building a bomb.

01:47:09.932 --> 01:47:11.211
 And with our allies and 
partners, we are engaged in 

01:47:11.212 --> 01:47:15.211
negotiations to see if we can 
peacefully achieve a goal we all

01:47:15.212 --> 01:47:18.642
 share. Preventing Iran from 
obtaining a nuclear weapon.

01:47:22.842 --> 01:47:24.952
&gt;&gt; [ Applause ] 
&gt;&gt;

01:47:33.895 --> 01:47:38.675
 These negotiations will be 
difficult. They may not succeed.

01:47:42.905 --> 01:47:45.655
 We are clear about our Iran's 
support for representation like 

01:47:46.405 --> 01:47:48.405
Hezbollah, which

01:47:52.655 --> 01:47:53.904
 threatens our allies, and we 
are clear about the mistrust 

01:47:53.905 --> 01:47:56.084
between our nations, Ms. trust 
that cannot be wished away. But,

01:47:56.085 --> 01:47:59.785
 these negotiations don't rely 
on trust. Any long-term deal we 

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:05.144
agree to be based on verifiable 
action that convinces us and the

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:09.085
 international community that I 
Ron is not building a nuclear 

01:48:09.225 --> 01:48:11.225
bomb.

01:48:12.965 --> 01:48:14.284
 If John F. Kennedy and Ronald 
Reagan could negotiate with the 

01:48:14.285 --> 01:48:16.285
Soviet Union

01:48:18.765 --> 01:48:19.844
, then surely, a strong and 
confident America could 

01:48:19.845 --> 01:48:21.845
negotiate with less powerful 
adversaries to date.

01:48:28.515 --> 01:48:30.515
&gt;&gt;  [ Applause ] 

01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:35.569
 The sanctions that we put in 
place help make this opportunity

01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:41.374
 possible. But, let me be clear.
 If this Congress sends me a new

01:48:41.375 --> 01:48:43.375
 sanctions bill now

01:48:44.815 --> 01:48:46.815
 that threatens to derail the 
talks, I will veto it.

01:48:50.695 --> 01:48:54.984
 For the sake of our national 
security, we must give diplomacy

01:48:54.985 --> 01:48:58.045
 a chance to succeed.
&gt;&gt;  [ Applause ] 

01:49:06.417 --> 01:49:07.686
&gt;&gt; If Iran's leaders do not 
seize this opportunity, then 

01:49:07.687 --> 01:49:09.687
I'll be the first to call for 
more sanctions.

01:49:11.957 --> 01:49:13.376
 And stand ready to exercise all
 options to make sure I Ron does

01:49:13.377 --> 01:49:16.976
 not build a nuclear weapon. But
 if I Ron's leaders to seize the

01:49:16.977 --> 01:49:22.346
 chance, and we will know soon 
enough, then I Ron could take an

01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:24.347
 important

01:49:27.597 --> 01:49:29.026
 death to join the community of 
nations and we will have 

01:49:29.027 --> 01:49:30.296
resolved one of the leading 
security challenges of our time 

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:34.690
without the risks. And finally,

01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:39.199
 let's remember that our 
leadership is defined, not just 

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.570
by our defense against threats, 
but by the enormous 

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.889
opportunities to do good and 
promote understanding around the

01:49:46.890 --> 01:49:52.470
 globe. To forage greater 
cooperation to expand new 

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.750
markets, to free people from 
fear and want. And no one

01:50:01.272 --> 01:50:02.351
 is better positioned to take 
advantage of those opportunities

01:50:02.352 --> 01:50:04.352
 than America.

01:50:07.362 --> 01:50:08.491
 Our alliance with Europe 
remains the strongest the world 

01:50:08.492 --> 01:50:10.772
has ever known. From Tunisia to 
Burma

01:50:13.962 --> 01:50:15.381
, we are supporting those who 
are willing to do the hard work 

01:50:15.382 --> 01:50:18.392
of building democracy. In 
Ukraine,

01:50:22.562 --> 01:50:24.041
 we stand for the principle that
 all people have the right to 

01:50:24.042 --> 01:50:26.721
express themselves freely and 
peacefully. And to have a say in

01:50:26.722 --> 01:50:28.722
 their country's future.

01:50:33.535 --> 01:50:34.904
 Across Africa, we are bringing 
together businesses and 

01:50:34.905 --> 01:50:36.104
governments to double access to 
electricity and help end extreme

01:50:36.105 --> 01:50:38.105
 poverty.

01:50:43.795 --> 01:50:45.074
 In the Americas, we are 
building new types of Congress, 

01:50:45.075 --> 01:50:45.964
but we are also expanding 
cultural and educational 

01:50:45.965 --> 01:50:47.774
exchanges during young people. 
And we will continue to focus on

01:50:47.775 --> 01:50:50.405
 the Asia-Pacific where we 
support our allies,

01:50:53.895 --> 01:50:57.065
 shape a future of greater 
security and prosperity, and 

01:50:57.145 --> 01:50:59.145
extend a hand to those 
devastated by disaster.

01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:04.649
 As we did in the Philippines 
when our Marines and civilians 

01:51:04.650 --> 01:51:07.750
rushed to aid those battered by 
a typhoon. And who were greeted 

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.790
with words like, "we will never 
forget your

01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:22.050
 kindness" and "God bless 
America",

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:26.519
 we do these things because they
 help promote the inherent 

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.089
dignity and equality of every 
human being, regardless of race 

01:51:28.090 --> 01:51:31.340
or religion, creed or sexual 
orientation.

01:51:40.673 --> 01:51:42.082
 Next week, the world will see 
one expression on that 

01:51:42.083 --> 01:51:43.372
commitment and team USA marches 
the red white and blue into the 

01:51:43.373 --> 01:51:44.192

 My fellow Americans, no other 
country in the world does what 

01:52:05.905 --> 01:52:07.905
we do

01:52:09.955 --> 01:52:11.955
, on every issue. The world 
turns to us

01:52:15.315 --> 01:52:16.764
, not simply because of the size
 of our economy or our military 

01:52:16.765 --> 01:52:21.075
might, but because the ideals we
 stand for. And the burdens we 

01:52:21.165 --> 01:52:23.165
buried to advanced them.

01:52:26.575 --> 01:52:28.575
 No one knows this better than 
those who serve in uniform.

01:52:31.615 --> 01:52:35.418
 As this time the board draws to
 a close, a new generation of 

01:52:35.508 --> 01:52:37.508
heroes returns to civilian life.

01:52:43.858 --> 01:52:45.117
 We will keep slashing that 
backlog so our veterans receive 

01:52:45.118 --> 01:52:46.097
the benefits they have earned 
and our wounded warriors receive

01:52:46.098 --> 01:52:47.957
 healthcare, including the 
mental health care that they 

01:52:47.958 --> 01:52:50.238
need.

 We will keep working to help 
all of our veterans translate 

01:53:11.475 --> 01:53:13.475
their skills and leadership in 
the jobs here at home,

01:53:16.545 --> 01:53:17.984
 and we will all continue to 
join forces to honor and support

01:53:17.985 --> 01:53:19.985
 our remarkable military 
families.

01:53:23.545 --> 01:53:25.194
 Let me tell you about one of 
those families I have come to 

01:53:25.195 --> 01:53:33.918
know. I first met Cory Ramsburg,
 a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha 

01:53:34.118 --> 01:53:40.318
Beach on the 65th anniversary of
 D-Day. Along with some of his 

01:53:40.408 --> 01:53:42.408
fellow Rangers, he walked me 
through the

01:53:46.718 --> 01:53:47.937
 program and ceremony and he was
 a strong, impressive young man,

01:53:47.938 --> 01:53:51.358
 had an easy manner, sharp as a 
tack. And we joked around and 

01:53:51.448 --> 01:53:55.038
took pictures and I told him to 
stay in touch. A few months 

01:53:55.118 --> 01:54:01.128
later, on his 10th deployment, 
Cory was nearly killed by a 

01:54:01.218 --> 01:54:03.218
massive roadside bomb in 
Afghanistan.

01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:10.450
 His comrades found him in a 
canal facedown, underwater, 

01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:18.580
shrapnel in his brain. For 
months, he lay in a coma. And 

01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:22.600
the next time I met him in the 
hospital, he couldn't speak. He 

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:29.450
could barely move. Over the 
years, he has endured dozens of 

01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:33.083
surgeries and procedures. Hours 
of 

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:39.539
 ruling rehab every day. Even 
now, Cory is still blind in one 

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:43.750
eye. Still struggles on his left
 side. But slowly, steadily

01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:51.260
, with the support of caregivers
 like his dad, Craig, and the 

01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:53.350
community around him, Cory has 
grown stronger

01:54:55.650 --> 01:54:58.540
. Day by day, he has learned to 
speak again and stand again and 

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:01.200
walk again

01:55:03.405 --> 01:55:04.949
. And he is working toward the 
day when he can serve his 

01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:06.950
country again.

01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:13.500
&gt;&gt; My recovery has not been 
easy, he says. Nothing in life 

01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:15.990
that is worth anything is easy.

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:24.529
 Cory is here tonight, and like 
the Army loves, like the America

01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:29.999
 he serves, Sergeant. first 
class Cory Ramsburg  never gives

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.473
 up and he does not quit.

, my fellow Americans, the men 
and women like Cory remind us 

01:57:21.043 --> 01:57:27.852
that America has never come easy
. Our freedom, our democracy has

mistakes, we get frustrated and

discouraged. But, for more than 
200 years, we have put those

01:57:51.778 --> 01:57:53.067
, to create and build and expand
 the possibilities of individual

01:57:53.068 --> 01:57:58.568
 achievement, to free other 
nations from tyranny and fear, 

01:57:58.698 --> 01:58:02.728
to promote justice and fairness 
and equality

01:58:06.321 --> 01:58:07.730
 under the law, so that the 
words set to paper by our 

01:58:07.731 --> 01:58:10.206
founders are made real for every
 citizen.

01:58:13.556 --> 01:58:15.556
 The America we want for our 
kids

01:58:19.536 --> 01:58:20.745
, a rising America where honest 
work is plentiful and 

01:58:20.746 --> 01:58:24.606
communities are strong, for 
prosperity is widely shared and 

01:58:24.706 --> 01:58:29.375
opportunity for all let us go as
 far as our dreams and toil will

01:58:29.376 --> 01:58:31.376
 take us, none of it is easy.

01:58:33.716 --> 01:58:40.161
 But, if we work together, if we
 summon what is best in us, The 

01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:42.251
Way, Cory summoned what is best 
in him,

01:58:44.983 --> 01:58:46.422
 with our feet planted firmly in
 today, but our eyes cast for 

01:58:46.423 --> 01:58:48.423
tomorrow, I know it is within 
our reach.

01:58:56.993 --> 01:58:58.472
 Believe me. God bless you, and 
God bless the United States of 

01:58:58.473 --> 01:59:01.103
America.

 [ Captioners transitioning ]

02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:49.182
 What an honor it is for me to 
be with you after the president 

02:10:49.337 --> 02:10:53.473
state of the union. Tonight we 
honor America. A nation that has

02:10:53.474 --> 02:10:56.282
 witnessed the greatest rise of 
freedom and opportunity our 

02:10:56.449 --> 02:11:00.895
world has ever seen. A nation 
where we are not defined by our 

02:11:01.063 --> 02:11:06.348
limits but by our potential. A 
nation where a girl who works at

02:11:06.349 --> 02:11:08.349
 the 

02:11:09.845 --> 02:11:11.350
McDonald's drive-through to help
 pay for college can be with you

02:11:11.351 --> 02:11:14.417
 from either the United States 
capital. But the most important 

02:11:14.586 --> 02:11:17.038
moments right now are not 
happening here. They are not in 

02:11:17.154 --> 02:11:22.380
the Oval Office or in the House 
chamber. They are in your homes,

02:11:22.381 --> 02:11:24.381
 kissing your kids 

02:11:26.959 --> 02:11:28.659
good night. Figuring out how to 
pay the bills and getting ready 

02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:30.660
for tomorrow's doctors visit. 
Waiting for to hear from those 

02:11:33.156 --> 02:11:35.884
you love serving in Afghanistan 
or searching for that big job 

02:11:35.996 --> 02:11:37.996
interview. 

02:11:40.883 --> 02:11:42.883
After all,

02:11:44.594 --> 02:11:46.239
 we, the people can't have been 
the foundation of America since 

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:47.877
the earliest days, people from 
all walks of life and from all 

02:11:47.878 --> 02:11:49.878
corners of the world. People who
 come to America 

02:11:52.101 --> 02:11:55.412
because here know challenge is 
too great and no dream too big. 

02:11:55.582 --> 02:11:59.684
That is the genius of America. 
&gt;&gt; Tonight the president made 

02:11:59.797 --> 02:12:01.797
more promises that sound good 

02:12:05.501 --> 02:12:06.970
but won't actually solve the 
problems facing Americans. We 

02:12:06.971 --> 02:12:08.971
want you to have a better life. 
The president wants 

02:12:12.335 --> 02:12:14.263
that too. But we part ways when 
it comes to how to make that 

02:12:14.264 --> 02:12:16.264
happen. 

02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:20.062
So tonight I would like to share
 a more hopeful Republican 

02:12:20.063 --> 02:12:22.063
vision, 

02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:25.380
one that

02:12:27.408 --> 02:12:28.734
 empowers you, not the 
government. It's one that 

02:12:28.735 --> 02:12:30.102
champions free markets and trust
 people to make their own 

02:12:30.103 --> 02:12:32.481
decisions. Not a government that
 decides for you. It helps 

02:12:32.597 --> 02:12:34.597
working families rise above the 
limits of poverty 

02:12:37.328 --> 02:12:39.000
and protect our most vulnerable.
 And it's one where Washington 

02:12:39.001 --> 02:12:44.422
plays by the same rules that you
 do. It's a vision that is fair 

02:12:44.536 --> 02:12:48.555
and offers the promise of a 
better future for every 

02:12:48.667 --> 02:12:50.667
American.

02:12:52.198 --> 02:12:54.380
 If you would have told me as a 
little girl that I would one day

02:12:54.381 --> 02:12:56.420
 put my hand on the Bible and be
 sworn in as the 200 woman to 

02:12:56.533 --> 02:12:57.893
these serving in the House of 
Representatives, I would not 

02:12:57.894 --> 02:13:04.344
have thought it possible. I grew
 up working on my family's 

02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:06.589
Orchard and kettle Falls a small
 town in Washington 

02:13:09.351 --> 02:13:11.214
getting up before dawn to pick 
apples. My dad drove a school 

02:13:11.215 --> 02:13:13.792
bus and my mom worked as a part 
times a teacher. They taught me 

02:13:13.909 --> 02:13:18.384
to work hard, help others and 
always dream for more. So 

02:13:22.622 --> 02:13:24.485
when I showed my for age animals
 at the county fair, my parents 

02:13:24.486 --> 02:13:28.465
used to say to me, Kathy, you 
need to say this money so you 

02:13:28.623 --> 02:13:31.410
can go to college one day. And 
so I did. I saved. I 

02:13:34.934 --> 02:13:36.934
worked hard. And I became the 
first in my family to graduate 

02:13:38.361 --> 02:13:40.361
from college. The chance to go 
from my Washington to this one 

02:13:42.295 --> 02:13:45.611
was unexpected. I came to 
Congress to help empower people.

02:13:45.612 --> 02:13:50.023
 Not politicians. To grow the 
working middle class. Not 

02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:55.381
the government. And to ensure 
that everyone in this country 

02:13:55.382 --> 02:13:59.863
can find a job. Because a job is
 so much more than a paycheck. 

02:13:59.978 --> 02:14:01.978
It gives 

02:14:03.774 --> 02:14:07.215
us purpose. Dignity. And the 
foundation to build a future. I 

02:14:07.325 --> 02:14:09.325
was single when I 

02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:13.324
was elected. But it wasn't long 
before I met Brian, a retired 

02:14:13.325 --> 02:14:17.476
Navy commander, and now we have 
three beautiful children, one 

02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:22.043
who was born just eight weeks 
ago. Like all parents, we have 

02:14:22.214 --> 02:14:25.658
high hopes and dreams for our 
children. But we also know what 

02:14:25.821 --> 02:14:30.320
it is like to face challenges. 
Three days after our son was 

02:14:30.492 --> 02:14:36.030
born, we got news no parent 
expects. Coal was diagnosed with

02:14:40.925 --> 02:14:43.578
Down's syndrome. The doctors 
told us he could have endless 

02:14:43.748 --> 02:14:44.986
complications, heart defects, 
even early Alzheimer's. They 

02:14:44.987 --> 02:14:46.987
told us all 

02:14:49.353 --> 02:14:51.926
the problems. But when we looked
 at our son, we saw only 

02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:54.040
possibilities. We sought a gift 
from 

02:14:57.492 --> 02:15:01.493
God. And today, we see a 
six-year-old boy who dances to 

02:15:01.615 --> 02:15:03.082
Bruce Springsteen, who reads 
above grade level and who is the

02:15:03.083 --> 02:15:05.697
 best brother in the world. We 
see all the things he 

02:15:09.723 --> 02:15:11.723
can do

02:15:13.192 --> 02:15:15.074
. Not those he cannot. And Cole 
and his sisters have only made 

02:15:15.075 --> 02:15:18.365
me more determined to see the 
potential in every human life

02:15:22.219 --> 02:15:24.029
 that whether we are born with 
an extra 21st chromosome or 

02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:25.802
without a dollar to our name, we
 are not defined by our limits 

02:15:25.803 --> 02:15:29.297
but by our potential. Because 
our mission, not only as 

02:15:29.464 --> 02:15:33.114
Republicans, but as Americans, 
is to once again ensure that we 

02:15:34.516 --> 02:15:37.888
are not bound by where we come 
from but empowered by what we 

02:15:39.332 --> 02:15:41.332
can become. That is 

02:15:43.552 --> 02:15:45.360
the gap Republicans are working 
to close. It's a gap we all 

02:15:45.361 --> 02:15:50.016
face. Between where you are and 
where you want to be. The 

02:15:50.186 --> 02:15:52.186
president talks a lot about 
income 

02:15:56.735 --> 02:15:58.377
inequality. But the real gap we 
face today is one of opportunity

02:16:01.736 --> 02:16:03.384
and equality. And with this 
administrations policies, that 

02:16:03.385 --> 02:16:05.385
gap has become far too wide. We 
see 

02:16:09.486 --> 02:16:11.397
this gap growing every single 
day. We see it in our neighbors 

02:16:11.398 --> 02:16:13.903
who are struggling to find jobs.
 A husband, who is now working 

02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:18.037
just part-time. A child, who 
dropped out of college because 

02:16:18.212 --> 02:16:22.512
she cannot afford tuition, or 
parents who are outliving their 

02:16:22.683 --> 02:16:27.328
lives savings. Last month more 
Americans stopped looking for a 

02:16:27.504 --> 02:16:29.504
job them 

02:16:30.939 --> 02:16:32.411
found one. Too many people are 
falling further and further 

02:16:32.412 --> 02:16:34.412
behind. Because right now 

02:16:36.749 --> 02:16:38.749
the president policies are 
making people's 

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:43.359
lives harder. Republicans have 
plans to close 

02:16:46.367 --> 02:16:48.367
the gap

02:16:50.605 --> 02:16:52.275
, plans that will focus on jobs 
first without more spending, 

02:16:52.276 --> 02:16:53.653
government bailouts, and red 
tape. Every day we are working 

02:16:53.654 --> 02:16:55.654
to expand our economy. One a 
manufacturing job, nursing 

02:16:58.547 --> 02:17:00.731
degree, and small business at a 
time. We have plans to improve 

02:17:00.894 --> 02:17:03.852
our education and training 
systems so you have the choice 

02:17:04.013 --> 02:17:06.013
to determine where your kids go 
to school. So college 

02:17:08.558 --> 02:17:10.558
is affordable. And skilled 
training is modernized. 

02:17:12.547 --> 02:17:14.547
And yes, it is time to honor our
 history of 

02:17:16.952 --> 02:17:18.103
legal immigration. We are 
working on a step-by-step 

02:17:18.104 --> 02:17:20.732
solution to immigration reform I
 first securing our orders and 

02:17:20.905 --> 02:17:22.905
making sure America will always 
attract 

02:17:26.345 --> 02:17:28.345
the best, brightest, and hardest
 working from around the world. 

02:17:29.139 --> 02:17:32.803
And with too many Americans 
living paycheck to paycheck, we 

02:17:33.517 --> 02:17:35.517
have solutions to help 

02:17:37.751 --> 02:17:39.368
you take home more of your pay 
through lower taxes, cheaper 

02:17:39.369 --> 02:17:41.369
energy costs, and 

02:17:44.151 --> 02:17:46.151
affordable healthcare. Not long 
ago, I got a letter from Betty 

02:17:46.201 --> 02:17:48.201
in Spokane who had hoped the 
president health 

02:17:51.965 --> 02:17:53.563
care love would save her money. 
But found out instead her 

02:17:53.564 --> 02:17:55.564
premiums were going 

02:17:56.969 --> 02:17:58.969
up nearly

02:18:00.188 --> 02:18:02.085
 $700 a month. We've all talked 
to too many people who have 

02:18:02.086 --> 02:18:03.512
received cancellation notices 
they did not expect. Or who can 

02:18:03.513 --> 02:18:07.501
no longer see the doctors they 
always have. No. We should not 

02:18:08.738 --> 02:18:12.567
go back to the way things were. 
But this law is 

02:18:16.736 --> 02:18:18.736
not working.

02:18:23.489 --> 02:18:24.994
 Republicans believe health care
 choices should be yours, not 

02:18:24.995 --> 02:18:26.540
the government. And that whether
 you are a boy with down 

02:18:26.541 --> 02:18:28.009
syndrome or a woman with breast 
cancer, you can find coverage 

02:18:28.010 --> 02:18:30.010
and a doctor who will treat you.
 So we hope the president will 

02:18:33.774 --> 02:18:35.774
join us

02:18:38.671 --> 02:18:40.344
 in a year of real action by 
empowering people, not by making

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:41.426
 their lives harder with 
unprecedented spending, higher 

02:18:41.427 --> 02:18:44.847
taxes, and fewer jobs. As 
Republicans, we advance these 

02:18:45.011 --> 02:18:47.011
plans every day because we 
believe in a government that 

02:18:50.979 --> 02:18:52.412
trusts people that does not 
limit where you finish because 

02:18:52.413 --> 02:18:56.014
of where you started. That is 
what we stand for. It's for an 

02:18:56.127 --> 02:19:00.943
America that is every bit as 
compassionate as it is 

02:19:01.113 --> 02:19:04.237
exceptional. If we are 
successful, years from now our 

02:19:04.406 --> 02:19:09.506
children will say -- we rebuild 
the American dream. 

02:19:12.566 --> 02:19:16.363
We build a working middle class 
that could take in anyone and a 

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:18.614
workforce that could take on 

02:19:20.965 --> 02:19:25.151
the world. Whether you are a 
girl in kettle Falls or a boy 

02:19:25.314 --> 02:19:26.865
from Brooklyn, our children 
should be able to say that we 

02:19:26.866 --> 02:19:30.468
close the gap. Our plan is one 
that dreams big for everyone and

02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:35.932
 turns it back on no one. The 
president said many things 

02:19:36.048 --> 02:19:42.370
tonight. But now I asked him to 
listen to you. For the true 

02:19:42.486 --> 02:19:46.509
state of the union lies in your 
hearts and in your 

02:19:49.544 --> 02:19:52.886
home. Tomorrow I will watch my 
son Cole get on the school bus  

02:19:52.887 --> 02:19:54.887
and others will

02:19:57.378 --> 02:19:59.080
 wait in the doctors office or 
interview for that first job. 

02:19:59.081 --> 02:20:01.643
Some of us will celebrate new 
beginnings. Others will face 

02:20:01.764 --> 02:20:05.635
great challenges. But all of us 
will wake up and do what is 

02:20:07.328 --> 02:20:10.304
uniquely American. We will look 
forward to the balance potential

02:20:10.305 --> 02:20:12.305
 that lies ahead. We will 

02:20:16.764 --> 02:20:18.484
give thanks to the brave men and
 women who have answered 

02:20:18.485 --> 02:20:22.423
America's call to freedom like 
Sergeant.  Jacob has from 

02:20:22.424 --> 02:20:28.346
Spokane who recently gave his 
life to protect all of ours. So 

02:20:28.515 --> 02:20:32.853
tonight I simply offer a prayer.
 A prayer for Sergeant. Hess's 

02:20:33.552 --> 02:20:35.552
family , 

02:20:36.763 --> 02:20:40.647
your family, and four hours 
larger American family. That 

02:20:40.761 --> 02:20:42.761
with the guidance of God, 

02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:47.360
we may

02:20:49.253 --> 02:20:50.817
 prove ourselves worthy of his 
blessings of life, liberty, and 

02:20:50.818 --> 02:20:52.818
the pursuit of happiness. For 
when we embrace of these gifts, 

02:20:53.751 --> 02:20:57.520
we are each doing our part to 
form a more perfect union. May 

02:20:57.631 --> 02:21:01.260
God guide you and our president 
and may God continue to bless 

02:21:01.427 --> 02:21:03.427
the United States 

02:21:06.156 --> 02:21:09.176
of America. 
&gt;&gt; [ 

02:21:13.923 --> 02:21:15.923
Pause ]

02:21:22.315 --> 02:21:24.315
&gt;&gt;

02:23:58.170 --> 02:24:01.899
 Good evening. I'm a senator 
Mike Lee from 

02:24:06.212 --> 02:24:08.212
Utah. In

02:24:19.427 --> 02:24:21.184
 the few minutes I have tonight 
I would like to speak especially

02:24:21.185 --> 02:24:22.843
 to those Americans who may feel
 they've been forgotten by both 

02:24:22.844 --> 02:24:23.759
political parties, those 
individuals and families who 

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.286
work hard and play by the rules 
and balance their budgets, honor

02:24:25.287 --> 02:24:26.751
 the Golden rule and do not 
understand why their government 

02:24:26.752 --> 02:24:30.353
in Washington cannot do the 
same. You are probably as 

02:24:30.516 --> 02:24:31.723
frustrated as I am about an 
ever-growing government that 

02:24:31.724 --> 02:24:33.724
somehow thinks it's okay to lie 
to spy on and even target its 

02:24:34.716 --> 02:24:36.575
own citizens. Many hard-working 
Americans are discouraged and 

02:24:36.576 --> 02:24:38.576
wondering what, if anything, can
 be done. 

02:24:41.530 --> 02:24:43.635
I think we need to do what 
Americans have always done, come

02:24:43.636 --> 02:24:45.636
 together and press for positive
 change. 

02:24:47.585 --> 02:24:48.720
Protesting against dysfunctional
 government is a great American 

02:24:48.721 --> 02:24:50.721
tradition. 

02:24:52.378 --> 02:24:54.378
Going back to the original tea 
party and Boston about 240 

02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:59.380
years ago

02:25:08.136 --> 02:25:09.744
, Americans have a natural 
instinct to stand up and speak 

02:25:09.745 --> 02:25:11.221
out when they know something is 
grok wrong. In 1773 Americans 

02:25:11.222 --> 02:25:12.311
have simply had it with the 
London-based national government

02:25:12.312 --> 02:25:13.820
 that had become too big, too 
expensive, and far too 

02:25:13.821 --> 02:25:15.821
intrusive.

02:25:18.464 --> 02:25:19.926
 It's important to note, 
however, that had the founding 

02:25:19.927 --> 02:25:21.174
generation stopped at just 
protesting against the kind of 

02:25:21.175 --> 02:25:22.396
government Americans did not 
want, the Boston tea party would

02:25:22.397 --> 02:25:24.397
 have been a little more than a 
footnote in history. 

02:25:26.970 --> 02:25:30.247
At most it would have been 
remembered as just one more 

02:25:30.361 --> 02:25:31.337
futile protest against an 
abusive national government. 

02:25:31.338 --> 02:25:34.559
Fortunately for all of us, those
 early patriots moved on from 

02:25:34.721 --> 02:25:38.626
Boston. And moved hast their 
protest against the government 

02:25:38.739 --> 02:25:40.739
they did not want. They 

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.200
marched forward on a road toward
 the kind of government they 

02:25:48.206 --> 02:25:50.206
did want.

02:25:52.466 --> 02:25:54.272
 It took them 14 long years to 
get from Boston to Philadelphia,

02:25:54.273 --> 02:25:55.650
 where they created, with our 
Constitution, the kind of 

02:25:55.651 --> 02:26:00.095
government they did want. In 
America, the test of any 

02:26:00.269 --> 02:26:01.613
political movement is not what 
that movement is against but 

02:26:01.614 --> 02:26:03.614
what it is for. The founders 
made 

02:26:05.971 --> 02:26:07.647
a point at Boston Harbor. But 
they made history in 

02:26:07.648 --> 02:26:09.648
Philadelphia's Independence 
Hall. Unfortunately in 

02:26:13.959 --> 02:26:15.683
recent years, we've had no 
choice but to engage in a number

02:26:15.684 --> 02:26:17.684
 of protest. Against our 

02:26:19.746 --> 02:26:22.355
current president Washington 
centered agenda. As Americans, 

02:26:22.526 --> 02:26:24.040
we must always be willing to 
fight the Boston type battles. 

02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:26.041
Boldly 

02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:31.197
calling out bad policy whenever 
we see. But we must do so with 

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.349
an eye toward Philadelphia, 
maintaining a positive focus on 

02:26:33.350 --> 02:26:35.350
the kind of nation we want to be
 and 

02:26:37.570 --> 02:26:40.826
become. Today Americans know in 
their heart that something is 

02:26:40.948 --> 02:26:42.948
wrong. Much of what is wrong 
related to the 

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:46.852
sense that the American dream is
 falling out of reach for far 

02:26:46.853 --> 02:26:48.853
too many 

02:26:50.199 --> 02:26:52.199
of us.

02:26:53.479 --> 02:26:55.053
 We are facing and inequality 
crisis, one to which the 

02:26:55.054 --> 02:26:56.466
president has paid a lipservice 
but seems uninterested in truly 

02:26:56.467 --> 02:26:58.467
confronting or correcting. This 
inequality crisis 

02:27:00.413 --> 02:27:01.518
presents itself in three 
principal forms. Immobility 

02:27:01.519 --> 02:27:03.519
among 

02:27:05.409 --> 02:27:07.409
the poor,

02:27:08.651 --> 02:27:10.094
 who are being trapped in 
poverty by big government 

02:27:10.095 --> 02:27:11.276
programs, insecurity and the 
middle class, where families are

02:27:11.277 --> 02:27:13.761
 struggling just to get ahead 
and they cannot seem to do much 

02:27:13.874 --> 02:27:16.013
more than that, and cronies have
 lived at the top where 

02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:20.996
political and economic insiders 
twist the immense power of the 

02:27:24.002 --> 02:27:25.706
federal government to profit at 
the expense of everyone else. To

02:27:25.707 --> 02:27:27.734
 be fair, President. Obama and 
his party  did not create all of

02:27:27.852 --> 02:27:29.852
 these

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:33.437
 problems. The Republican 
establishment in Washington can 

02:27:33.438 --> 02:27:37.489
be just as out of touch as the 
Democratic establishment. 

02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:40.448
However, tonight, as on numerous
 occasions of late, the 

02:27:40.561 --> 02:27:42.561
president lost 

02:27:44.878 --> 02:27:48.337
the rhetoric ignored the fact 
that his administration 

02:27:48.509 --> 02:27:49.650
continues to leave poor and 
middle-class families further 

02:27:49.651 --> 02:27:51.651
behind while he and his allies 
insist that the real 

02:27:54.581 --> 02:27:56.408
problem is inequality itself. 
But where does this new 

02:27:56.409 --> 02:27:58.409
inequality come from? 

02:27:59.794 --> 02:28:01.084
From government. Every time it 
takes rights and opportunities 

02:28:01.085 --> 02:28:03.683
away from the American people 
and gives them instead 

02:28:07.584 --> 02:28:09.584
to politicians, bureaucrats, and
 special interest. Inequality. 

02:28:09.749 --> 02:28:11.749
Real 

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
inequality is trapping poor 
children in failing schools 

02:28:17.997 --> 02:28:20.679
to benefit bureaucrats and union
 bosses. It's penalizing low 

02:28:20.792 --> 02:28:24.642
income parents for getting 
married or getting better jobs. 

02:28:24.812 --> 02:28:26.812
It's

02:28:33.993 --> 02:28:35.114
 guaranteeing insurance 
companies taxpayer bailouts if 

02:28:35.115 --> 02:28:36.239
Obamacare cuts into their 
profits. Inequality is blocking 

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.598
thousands of middle-class jobs 
in the energy industry as a 

02:28:37.599 --> 02:28:38.673
favor to partisan donors and 
radical environmental activist. 

02:28:38.674 --> 02:28:39.947
Inequality is denied but viable 
unborn children any protection 

02:28:39.948 --> 02:28:41.948
under the 

02:28:44.015 --> 02:28:46.015
law while

02:28:48.275 --> 02:28:49.419
 adjusting unsanitary late-term 
abortion clinics from basic 

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:50.690
safety standards. It's denying 
citizens their right to define 

02:28:50.691 --> 02:28:52.966
marriage in their states as 
traditionally or as broadly as 

02:28:53.088 --> 02:28:55.088
their diverse values 

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:00.308
dictate. It's the federal 
government turning rural 

02:29:00.477 --> 02:29:01.585
communities, especially in the 
West by controlling and 

02:29:01.586 --> 02:29:03.586
mismanaging public 

02:29:04.984 --> 02:29:08.720
lands. It's changing the laws 
without congressional approval 

02:29:08.888 --> 02:29:09.841
and spying on American citizens 
without constitutional 

02:29:09.842 --> 02:29:11.842
authority. And of course, 
Obamacare. All by itself 

02:29:14.766 --> 02:29:17.994
is an inequality Godzilla that 
has robbed working families of 

02:29:18.158 --> 02:29:22.413
their insurance, their doctors, 
their wages and their jobs. Many

02:29:22.414 --> 02:29:24.368
 Americans are now seeing why 
some of us fought so hard to 

02:29:24.369 --> 02:29:27.970
stop this train wreck over the 
last four years. Government 

02:29:28.084 --> 02:29:30.084
driven inequality is the 

02:29:32.618 --> 02:29:33.988
reason why as hard-working 
American families across the 

02:29:33.989 --> 02:29:35.989
company struggled to make 

02:29:38.992 --> 02:29:41.196
ends meet. Six of the 10 
wealthiest counties in America 

02:29:41.312 --> 02:29:45.153
are now suburbs of Washington 
DC. Throughout the last five 

02:29:45.267 --> 02:29:47.267
years, President. Obama has 

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:51.922
promised  an economy for the 
middle class. But all he has 

02:29:52.043 --> 02:29:54.806
delivered is an economy from the
 middlemen. Tonight his party 

02:29:54.977 --> 02:29:58.863
cheered as he asked for more of 
the same, as if the solution to 

02:29:59.027 --> 02:30:01.027
inequality were -- well, 

02:30:04.778 --> 02:30:06.778
more inequality. Critics might 
push back and argue that my own 

02:30:06.837 --> 02:30:08.837
party has been part of 

02:30:10.409 --> 02:30:13.777
the problem. Too often joining 
the Democrats to rig our economy

02:30:13.778 --> 02:30:15.003
 to benefit of the 
well-connected at the expense of

02:30:15.004 --> 02:30:18.801
 the disconnected. I know 
because I am one of those 

02:30:18.968 --> 02:30:20.510
critics. But I am speaking to 
you tonight because I think 

02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:23.265
maybe, just maybe, that is 
finally starting 

02:30:26.785 --> 02:30:31.213
to change. As a nation, we are 
once again at a critical turning

02:30:31.214 --> 02:30:34.061
 point. Now, as in 1773, 
Americans have had it with our 

02:30:34.177 --> 02:30:36.641
out of touch national 
government. But if all we do 

02:30:40.783 --> 02:30:43.799
is protest, our Boston tea party
 moment will occupy little more 

02:30:43.919 --> 02:30:45.919
than a footnote in our history. 
Hopefully 

02:30:48.989 --> 02:30:51.270
our leaders, reformers and 
citizens, will join the journey 

02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:53.389
from Boston to 

02:30:55.211 --> 02:30:57.846
Philadelphia from the test to 
progress. Together we can march 

02:30:58.022 --> 02:30:59.665
forward and take the road that 
leads to the kind of government 

02:30:59.666 --> 02:31:02.980
we do want. We have a new 
generation of leaders in 

02:31:03.161 --> 02:31:05.260
Washington, with positive and 
innovative ideas. Thoughtful 

02:31:06.169 --> 02:31:09.613
policy reforms as my friend 
tended -- Senator. Ted Cruz says

02:31:09.614 --> 02:31:14.167
  makes BC listen. Reforms to 
help poor families work 

02:31:18.614 --> 02:31:20.614
their way

02:31:21.895 --> 02:31:23.603
 into the middle class and to 
help middle class families get 

02:31:23.604 --> 02:31:25.067
ahead and to level the playing 
field and put corporate and 

02:31:25.068 --> 02:31:28.526
political insiders back to work 
for the rest of us. Conservative

02:31:28.886 --> 02:31:30.221
 reformers like Senator. Marco 
Rubio, commerce meant Paul Ryan,

02:31:30.222 --> 02:31:32.222
 and 

02:31:33.885 --> 02:31:36.412
Congressman  Jim Jordan are 
working on new welfare reform 

02:31:36.584 --> 02:31:38.584
ideas to help underprivileged 
families 

02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:41.926
escape poverty. Senator. rand 
Paul and I are working with some

02:31:41.927 --> 02:31:43.589
 of the most liberal Democrats 
in Congress  to reform the 

02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:45.590
criminal justice system and to

02:31:47.196 --> 02:31:49.196
 help keep violent predators 
behind bars while 

02:31:52.199 --> 02:31:54.112
creating opportunities for 
nonviolent offenders to return 

02:31:54.113 --> 02:31:55.158
to the families and 
neighborhoods that so 

02:31:55.159 --> 02:31:57.159
desperately 

02:31:58.222 --> 02:31:59.489
need them. Senator. John cordon 
has legislation that would 

02:31:59.490 --> 02:32:01.490
empower states to 

02:32:03.231 --> 02:32:05.231
impose 

02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:14.566
 K through 12 education 
throughout the country. Senator.

02:32:14.567 --> 02:32:15.956
 Tim Scott has reforms to 
improve our job training 

02:32:15.957 --> 02:32:17.186
programs and I've introduced a 
bill to modernize higher 

02:32:17.187 --> 02:32:18.293
education, making it more 
accessible and more affordable 

02:32:18.294 --> 02:32:20.335
for lower income and non- 
traditional student. Congressman

02:32:24.688 --> 02:32:26.418
 Tom Grace has a transportation 
reform bill to ensure that our 

02:32:26.419 --> 02:32:27.534
infrastructure dollars are 
invested in roads and bridges 

02:32:27.535 --> 02:32:29.535
and not wasted on bureaucrats 
and special 

02:32:32.401 --> 02:32:33.823
interest. Congressman Mike 
Pompeo introduced a bill to and 

02:32:33.824 --> 02:32:35.824
all federal subsidies for the 
energy 

02:32:37.483 --> 02:32:39.187
industry. And other as a working
 not proposals to do the same 

02:32:39.188 --> 02:32:43.326
for every industry know that 
business profits are one from 

02:32:43.443 --> 02:32:45.443
customers and not true political
 connections. After all, if we 

02:32:45.487 --> 02:32:47.487
are 

02:32:48.625 --> 02:32:50.625
going to reform welfare, we 
really should start with 

02:32:53.633 --> 02:32:55.186
corporate welfare. One of the 
that should directly help you 

02:32:55.187 --> 02:32:57.187
and your family is the bill I 

02:32:59.474 --> 02:33:00.947
have introduced to simplify the 
tax code and provide relief from

02:33:00.948 --> 02:33:03.672
 the hidden double tax that 
Washington currently imposes on 

02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:07.830
working parents. Especially moms
 and dads in the 

02:33:10.824 --> 02:33:13.697
middle class. When it comes to 
health care, we know the best 

02:33:13.861 --> 02:33:16.805
way to repeal Obamacare is to go
 deliver better solutions. We 

02:33:16.917 --> 02:33:18.917
can't just return to the old 
system. Healthcare policy used 

02:33:20.401 --> 02:33:24.571
to give too much power to 
insurance companies. Obamacare 

02:33:24.687 --> 02:33:26.687
now gives far too much power to 
government. We 

02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:33.864
know that real reform will put 
healthcare dollars and decisions

02:33:33.865 --> 02:33:35.534
 where they belong in the hands 
of patients and families and 

02:33:35.535 --> 02:33:38.997
their doctors and nurses. So 
reformers in both the House and 

02:33:39.164 --> 02:33:42.791
the Senate are hard at work 
developing new patient Center 

02:33:42.985 --> 02:33:44.985
reforms to control 

02:33:47.206 --> 02:33:50.052
healthcare costs, ensure access 
to affordable coverage for all 

02:33:50.228 --> 02:33:51.783
Americans, and provide extra 
help for the poor and the sick. 

02:33:51.784 --> 02:33:53.784
All 

02:33:55.192 --> 02:33:59.031
of these proposals, within this 
new conservative reform agenda, 

02:33:59.197 --> 02:34:00.730
along with many more to come, 
what Mark the road to 

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:04.196
Philadelphia. These principles 
and these policies will work. 

02:34:04.325 --> 02:34:07.407
And will put Americans back to 
work. Not just by cutting big 

02:34:07.578 --> 02:34:09.578
government but 

02:34:12.417 --> 02:34:14.417
by fixing

02:34:16.899 --> 02:34:18.393
 broken government. Not just by 
making government smaller but by

02:34:18.394 --> 02:34:20.394
 promoting bigger citizens, 
stronger families, and more 

02:34:21.898 --> 02:34:24.154
heroic communities. Our goal 
should be an America where 

02:34:24.269 --> 02:34:25.785
everyone has a fair chance to 
pursue happiness and find it. 

02:34:25.786 --> 02:34:28.552
That is what it looks like when 
protest grows 

02:34:33.196 --> 02:34:35.196
into reform.

02:34:37.121 --> 02:34:38.950
 So if you are one of those 
Americans that big government is

02:34:38.951 --> 02:34:40.581
 leaving behind, if you work 
hard, play by the rules, and 

02:34:40.582 --> 02:34:42.333
teacher kids to do the same, I 
want you to know that your 

02:34:42.334 --> 02:34:44.780
family will not be forgotten 
anymore. This new generation 

02:34:49.217 --> 02:34:51.217
of reformist still has a long 
way to go to win over our party 

02:34:51.367 --> 02:34:53.367
in Washington and even further 
to go to earn 

02:34:56.033 --> 02:34:58.092
your trust. I'm confident that 
our best days as a nation are 

02:34:58.205 --> 02:35:01.301
ahead of us, not because of 
government, but because within 

02:35:01.415 --> 02:35:03.415
America's diverse society 

02:35:04.824 --> 02:35:06.132
of individuals, and families and
 neighborhoods and churches and 

02:35:06.133 --> 02:35:08.133
businesses and 

02:35:10.632 --> 02:35:12.126
communities, freedom does not 
mean you are on your own. 

02:35:12.127 --> 02:35:13.913
Freedom means we are all in this
 together. I invite you to join 

02:35:13.914 --> 02:35:15.981
us on the road to a more 

02:35:20.402 --> 02:35:23.763
prosperous America. Together we 
can create the kind of 

02:35:23.879 --> 02:35:25.574
government we do want and the 
kind of nation our children and 

02:35:25.575 --> 02:35:28.104
grandchildren deserve. Thank you
 very much for your time. Good 

02:35:28.273 --> 02:35:30.273
night and
