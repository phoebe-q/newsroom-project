00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
so it feels like Brexit is gone a bit
mad and there's less than five months to

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.940
go and no one really knows where it all
might end up Theresa May said ministers

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.130
had signed off the deal for the UK to
leave the EU the collective decision of

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.460
cabinet was that the government should
agree the draft withdrawal agreement and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.080
the outline political declaration but
the next morning it was a different

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
story
the brexit secretary Dominic Raab has

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
resigned the man in charge of the brexit
talks said he wasn't up for that job

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.440
anymore because he didn't believe in
what had been agreed I think she needs a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.890
Brexit secretary that will pursue the
deal that she wants to put to the country

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.280
with conviction I don't feel I can do
that in good conscience yep that was the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.450
man who was supposed to be in charge of
brexit who's walked away and he's the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.190
second one to quit that job not great
some more big names and some junior

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
ministers resigned as well Theresa May
had to go to Parliament to try to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.800
convince MPs that the deal was the right
one and that they should back it once a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.780
final deal is agreed I will bring it to
Parliament and I will ask MPs to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
consider the national interest and give
it their backing, but getting MPs on board

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.090
is going to be the hardest part of this
process and at the moment it's looking

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.670
like no-one from any party is happy with
it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.280
the government must now withdraw this
half-baked deal which is clear does not

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.100
have the backing of the cabinet this
Parliament or the country as a whole and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.500
it's looking pretty rocky for the PM herself too

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.110
as what my right honourable friend

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.090
says and what my right honourable friend
does no longer match should I not write

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.070
to my right honourable friend the member
for Altrincham and Sale west

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.320
he means this guy Graham Brady who's in
charge of conservative MPs in Parliament

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.770
they can write to him saying they want a
different leader and so guess what

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.300
happened next

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.680
no of course it isn't it's
using the proper procedures of the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.660
Conservative Party what we need is a
leader who will say to the European

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.090
Union it is impossible to divide up the
United Kingdom 48 letters in total and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.149
there has to be a vote on whether to
either mate should still be the one in

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.670
charge
I believe with every fiber of my being

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.320
that the course I have set out is the
right one for our country and all our

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.239
people am I going to see this through
yes but even if the Prime Minister stays

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.440
it's not clear how any kind of brexit
deal let alone the one she's pushing

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.350
could get enough support in Westminster
to make it out alive

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.709
you
