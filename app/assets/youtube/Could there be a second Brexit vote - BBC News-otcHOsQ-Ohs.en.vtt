00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.160
the brexit debate has dominated
everything in politics over the last

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.460
couple of years
what if Parliament decided it doesn't

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.420
necessarily need to happen could you
guys get another vote

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.660
not another one

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.520
well possibly to be honest there isn't
an easy answer but let's talk through

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.240
the politics and some of the
possibilities

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.100
firstly the Prime Minister

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.260
has always said she won't hold one she
is a plan she's trying to get backing

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.800
for at the moment but what if she can't
get enough support in Parliament

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.700
it will

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.360
either be more uncertainty more division
or it could risk no brexit at all

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.800
yup you heard that no brexit at all
there are a bunch of campaigners who

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.480
have been saying this for a while
whenever we know what Brexit is going to

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.640
look like
let's ask people if they still want it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.830
but the idea has been picking up more
and more traction labour says it could

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.479
be an option although their position
hasn't always been clear they'd much

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.710
prefer a general election our preference
would be for a general election we can

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.030
negotiate our future relationships with
Europe but some Labour MPs are fighting

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.619
hard to make another referendum happen
now listen to this from the Shadow

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.590
Chancellor
yes we've kept on the option on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.100
table of a another referendum of sorts
it's not just about labour the SNP have

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.520
said they would back another vote on
Brexit in the way of a second referendum

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.960
the so-called people's vote I think the
SNP MPs would undoubtedly vote for

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.280
it would that's a very important moment

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
so if and it's still a
big if labour were to back it and opposition

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.290
parties got on site a few Tory rebels -
it's possible the idea of another

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.750
referendum could have a majority in
parliament the question then is where

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.670
their MPs could force the government to
hold one okay rewind a second remember

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.610
there's no guarantee we'll get to this
stage but if we did get there that would

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.160
need to be legislation in Parliament
that would take weeks and making a vote

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.360
happen, before we officially leave might not be

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.440
possible and even if all that did happen
what would the options be the PM's deal

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.980
no deal calling the whole thing off
so is it possible yes but there are a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.480
lot of hurdles and almost nothing in
politics at the moment is certain
