00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.259
my name is Vicky and I was conceived by
rape

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.309
I was born in Birmingham in the 70s and
adopted when I was 7 months old growing

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.470
up I always wanted to find my birth
mother it's almost like she'd been a

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.210
ghost in my life knowing there was
somebody who given birth to you he was

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.660
alive walking around when I hit my 18th
birthday I was determined to get the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.930
files and that's when I was told by a
social worker and I saw in black and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.100
white in my files that my conception was
a result of rape

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.390
my birth mom had been 13 a school girl
and my birth dad a family friend he was

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:28.229
35 the record said that she'd gone to
babysit his house and he raped her to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.100
find out that you've been born through a
horrendous act of violence against a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.619
child and that people knew it says in
seven different places in the files that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.619
it was rape the fact that she was 13
means it was statutory rape because he

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.470
had sex with a minor
it states his name and address

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.720
that social services police and health
workers knew but nothing was done about

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.200
it my birth mom was from a black
working-class family and I can't help

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.660
thinking attitudes at the time had
something to do with that it made me

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:17.370
feel angry devastated for my birth mum
for me and then I remember thinking will

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.890
my birth mother ever want to meet me

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.159
I traced my birth mother with support
from my adoptive father and I found her

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.620
seeing the photo of her for the first
time was incredible

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.389
it was like looking into a mirror I

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:46.209
remember us meeting when I was about 20
I walked off the train and she was there

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.430
I can only imagine how she must have
felt seeing me there as an adult she

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.060
said that she'd always hoped I find her
but it wasn't some soft focused moment

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.579
or loving embrace it was just was just
really surreal

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.519
it wasn't until decades later when the
Jimmy Savile case and other historic

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.120
cases were in the news that I really
thought about trying to do anything

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.510
about it I'd always thought it was so
wrong that my birth father was never

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.459
prosecuted
it was then though I thought I've got

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.510
DNA evidence because I am DNA evidence

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.840
I'm a walking crime scene and it's all
written in the files I mean surely

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.450
people are going to take me seriously I
wanted him to be held accountable I

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:07.450
wanted justice for my mom I wanted
justice for me the ramifications of what

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.680
he chose to do have shaped my entire
life

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:29.380
you think I'd get sick of Crying and he's
being able to get away with it and just

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.310
live his life

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.650
my birth mother made it very clear that
she reported that it was a rape at the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.300
time and people hadn't listened to her
then so why would they listen now more

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.630
than 40 years have passed and she well
she doesn't want to go through all again

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:08.950
but she supports me pursuing it I've
contacted so many people police social

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.010
workers solicitors MPs they just say
you're not the victim because of that

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.250
crime I am Alive my whole life's been
dictated by it but no one will see me as

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.450
the victim I am living breathing proof
of a child rapist and nobody is

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.110
interested how is that okay

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:47.370
my birth father's name was in my files
so I traced him I was getting nowhere of

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:59.810
the police eventually I decided to go to
his address I just remember the nerves

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.650
my heart was pounding I was sweating I
mean this man like a ghost he's done the

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:16.069
most heinous act and this is who I'm
going to meet he came to the front door

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:28.710
and I just said hello I believe I'm your
daughter he just said oh come in and

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.950
that's it
it was the most surreal 40 minutes of my

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:42.950
life I remember saying to him well did
you have sex with her because if you

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:49.010
didn't then we don't need to be having
this conversation and he just said that

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.090
just because you have sex with somebody
doesn't mean you make a baby and so to

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:03.380
me that was well he just confirmed it
why would you not deny it on the way out

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.140
I noticed his photo on the wall of a
girl maybe about 12 years old I just

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:16.790
sort of said oh no who's that
it was his great-granddaughter or

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:25.060
someone and that made me feel absolutely
sick I mean who's protecting her

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:37.399
I found out that there have been
victimless prosecutions for rape when

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:41.809
people don't feel able to report it
because of the nature of the crime but

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:47.689
there's evidence I want the police to
look at the files and at least consider

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:53.240
a victimless prosecution in my case and
I want the definition of victim to be

00:07:53.240 --> 00:08:04.249
reviewed this has nearly beaten me down
being adopted comes of so many

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:11.449
difficulties and the trauma of this has
affected every part of my life but I

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:17.809
will persevere because I know this is so
wrong and I want justice so I'm not

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:25.389
going to go away
