00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.960
This is Hevrin Khalaf.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.759
A 34-year-old Syrian Kurdish political leader.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.800
As the secretary general
of the Future Syria party

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.399
she campaigned in Arab areas
as well as Kurdish ones

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.519
looking for all ethnicities
to work together.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.719
She was also a vocal opponent 
to Turkey’s operation in North East Syria

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:29.960
calling it an occupation.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.280
But on the 12th of October she was silenced.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:36.640
Video emerged of her bullet-ridden car

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.719
on the side of Syria's M4 motorway.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.039
Ahrar al-Sharqiya, a faction which fights for

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.240
an opposition militia known as
 the Syrian National Army

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.320
backed by Turkey,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.920
was blamed.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.079
But they denied having any responsibility 
for the death of Hevrin.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.280
BBC News Arabic has used open source journalism techniques

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.720
and spoken exclusively to a witness to find out what happened.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.800
Nubahar Mustafa and Hevrin Khalaf 
were old friends.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.920
They also worked together 
at the Future Syria party.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.480
Everyday Nubahar travels 
the same routes as Hevrin

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.320
campaigning for the party

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.480
On the 12th of October

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.120
Hevrin Khalaf set off from al-Hasakah 
around 5.30am with her driver

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.040
heading west on the M4 motorway

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.879
for the three hour drive to her party 
headquarters in Raqqa.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.000
Earlier that morning eyewitnesses report

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.360
that a military convoy was seen crossing
 into Syria from Turkey.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.160
The convoy was a part of the 
Syrian National Army, the SNA.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.680
Not to be confused with the army of 
President Bashar al-Assad's central government,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.520
the SNA is an umbrella group of 41 factions

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.560
and more than 70,000 soldiers

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.600
formed by Turkey in 2019.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.760
They've been fighting Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.560
since the US forces pulled out

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
and Turkey launched a military operation there in October 2019.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.520
Turkey trains and arms these factions.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.280
Then they are sent to the Syrian border

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.159
to join the offensive against the Kurds

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.439
as shown in this footage obtained by the BBC.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.960
Their convoys cheered on

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.800
as they make their way to the frontline.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.919
The SNA faction that crossed the border
on the morning of the 12th of October

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.199
and made its advance to the M4 motorway

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.760
was Ahrar al-Sharqiya.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.560
This video, filmed by 
an Ahrar al-Sharqiya fighter

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.479
shows the sun has just risen

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.479
putting the time between 6.30am and 7am.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.319
Videos shared on the encrypted messaging app,
 Telegram, show them arresting people.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.639
And then executing one person on the road,
after taking over a checkpoint.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.319
On a satellite image we've been able to identify these features

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.360
which are also in the 
background of the videos:

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.680
a concrete barrier

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.479
this raised area

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.439
this telegraph pole

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.199
and a dirt road

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.360
enabling us to locate the videos
to this point on the M4.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.120
This is the Tirwaziya checkpoint.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.080
This means that Ahrar al-Sharqiya

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.879
were killing people trying to pass through 
the very same checkpoint

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.800
Hevrin Khalaf was travelling towards
 at that time.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.520
So what happened when her car approached the Tirwaziya checkpoint?

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.599
The car was shot at

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.000
blowing out its tyres.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.800
Most of the bullet holes are on the left 
hand side of the car.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.160
We’ve geolocated Hevrin’s car to here, 
off the main road, near the checkpoint.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.839
The SNA faction, Ahrar al-Sharqiya,
told BBC News Arabic

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.040
that a number of their fighters were at
Tirwaziya checkpoint that day

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.800
and that they opened fire at a car
 they claim did not stop.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.240
They also added that they didn't target 
Hevrin Khalaf specifically

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.600
and do not know how she was killed.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.279
But our evidence tells a different story.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.640
This video shows Ahrar al-Sharqiya fighters 
surrounding Hevrin’s car.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.160
There's a dead body on the floor

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.360
believed to be her driver, Farhad Ramadan.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.040
It's at this point we hear a faint female voice

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.440
coming from inside the car.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.120
We've amplified the sound so you can hear it.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.440
We showed the video to Hevrin’s mother.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.800
It appears that Hevrin Khalaf was alive

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.560
and able to identify herself to the fighters 
when her car was stopped.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.399
There is also further evidence
that she did not die inside the car.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:47.399
The windows of Hevrin’s car were bulletproof.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.399
Most of them stayed intact,
protecting the passengers inside.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.879
A farmer, who has
spoken exclusively to the BBC

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.000
and has asked us to conceal his identity

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.120
was travelling nearby when the faction 
took over the checkpoint.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.960
The farmer found nine bodies 
at Tirwaziya checkpoint.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.759
At 12pm the body of Hevrin

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.759
along with the bodies of three other people

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.000
were delivered to Malikiya military hospital.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.959
This medical report states that Hevrin Khalaf

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:46.079
was shot more than 20 times.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.519
Both her legs were broken, and she was subjected 
to severe physical assault.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.480
Leading us to conclude that Hevrin
was dragged from the car alive

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.759
physically attacked and executed outside the car 
by Ahrar al-Sharqiya fighters.

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.279
In a statement Ahrar al-Sharqiya told the BBC:

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.839
The Turkish government,
who back the SNA group,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.960
have not responded to BBC 
requests for comment.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.560
Since the start of the Turkish military offensive in northern Syria

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.200
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan 
has maintained

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.440
that the military operation was needed 
to stop terrorism and to secure peace.

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:22.199
Hevrin is one of hundreds of people killed

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.680
since the US troops withdrew in October

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.680
leaving a vacuum in which 
the Turkey-backed SNA group

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.400
and factions within it, like Ahrar al-Sharqiya, 
can operate with impunity.
