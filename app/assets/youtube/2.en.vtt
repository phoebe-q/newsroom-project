00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.150
my fellow Americans tonight I am is
speaking to you because there is a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.509
growing humanitarian and security crisis
at our southern border every day Customs

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.010
and Border Patrol agents encounter
thousands of illegal immigrants trying

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.230
to enter our country we are out of space
to hold them and we have no way to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.930
promptly return them back home to their
country America proudly welcomes

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.969
millions of lawful immigrants who enrich
our society and contribute to our nation

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.200
but all Americans are hurt by
uncontrolled illegal migration it

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.050
strains public resources and drives down
jobs and wages among those hardest hit

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.360
are African Americans and Hispanic
Americans our southern border is a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.960
pipeline for vast quantities of illegal
drugs including meth heroin cocaine and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.000
fentanyl every week 300 of our citizens
are killed by heroin alone 90% of which

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.610
floods across from our southern border
more Americans will die from drugs this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.360
year than were killed in the entire
Vietnam War in the last two years ice

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.920
officers made 266 thousand arrests of
aliens with criminal records including

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.189
those charged or convicted of 100,000
assaults thirty thousand sex crimes and

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.619
4,000 violent killings over the years
thousands of Americans have been

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.990
brutally killed by those who illegally
entered our country and thousands more

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.640
lives will be lost if we don't act right
now this is a humanitarian crisis a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.689
crisis of the heart and a crisis of the
soul last month

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.770
20,000 migrant children were illegally
brought into the United States a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.360
dramatic increase these children are
used as human pawns by vicious coyotes

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.940
and ruthless gangs one in three women are

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.060
sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek
up through mexico women and children are

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.390
the biggest victims by far of our broken
system this is the tragic reality of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.330
illegal immigration on our southern
border this is the cycle of human

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.080
suffering that I am determined to end my
administration has presented Congress

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.890
with a detailed proposal to secure the
border and stop the criminal gangs drug

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.890
smugglers and human traffickers it's a
tremendous problem our proposal was

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.360
developed by law enforcement
professionals and border agents at the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.910
Department of Homeland Security these
are the resources they have requested to

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.840
properly perform their mission and keep
America safe

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.430
in fact safer than ever before the
proposal from Homeland Security includes

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.310
cutting-edge technology for detecting
drugs weapons illegal contraband and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.960
many other things we have requested more
agents immigration judges and bed space

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.000
to process the sharp rise and unlawful
migration fueled by our very strong

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.220
economy our plan also contains an urgent
request for humanitarian assistance and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.710
medical support furthermore we have
asked Congress to close border security

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.460
loopholes so that illegal immigrant
children can be safely and humanely

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.670
returned back home finally as part of an
overall approach to border security law

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.250
enforcement professionals have requested
5.7 billion dollars for a physical

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.680
barrier at the request of Democrats it
will be a steel barrier rather than a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.370
concrete wall this barrier is absolutely
critical to border security it's also

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.990
what our professionals at the border
want and need

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.979
this is just common sense the border
wall would very quickly pay for itself

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:37.419
the cost of illegal drugs exceeds 500
billion dollars a year vastly more than

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.819
the 5.7 billion dollars we have
requested from Congress the wall will

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.770
also be paid for indirectly by the great
new trade deal we have made with Mexico

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.930
Senator Chuck Schumer who you will be
hearing from later tonight has

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.270
repeatedly supported a physical barrier
in the past along with many other

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.900
Democrats they change their mind
only after I was elected president

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.270
Democrats in Congress have refused to
acknowledge the crisis and they have

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.520
refused to provide our brave border
agents with the tools they desperately

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.060
need to protect our families and our
nation the federal government remains

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.190
shut down for one reason and one reason
only because Democrats will not fund

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.770
border security my administration is
doing everything in our power to help

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:46.539
those impacted by the situation but the
only solution is for Democrats to pass a

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:52.630
spending bill that defends our borders
and reopens the government this

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:59.949
situation could be solved in a 45-minute
meeting I have invited congressional

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:06.610
leadership to the White House tomorrow
to get this done hopefully we can rise

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.060
above partisan politics in order to
support national security some have

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.409
suggested a barrier is immoral then why
do wealthy politicians build walls

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.930
fences and gates around their homes they
don't build walls because they hate the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.320
people on the outside but because they
love the people on the inside the only

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.889
thing that is immoral is the politicians
to do nothing

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:43.810
and continue to allow more innocent
people to be so horribly victimized

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.759
America's heart broke the day after
Christmas when a young police officer in

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:56.180
California was savagely murdered in cold
blood by an illegal alien just came

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.639
across the border the life of an
American Hero was stolen by someone who

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:06.919
had no right to be in our country
day after day precious lives are cut

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:14.240
short by those who have violated our
borders in California an Air Force

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.409
veteran was raped murdered and beaten to
death with a hammer by an illegal alien

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:29.360
with a long criminal history in Georgia
an illegal alien was recently charged

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.979
with murder for killing beheading and
dismembering his neighbor in Maryland

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:42.800
ms-13 gang members who arrived in the
United States as unaccompanied minors

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.009
were arrested and charged last year
after viciously stabbing and beating a

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:55.159
16 year old girl over the last several
years I've met with dozens of families

00:07:55.159 --> 00:08:02.719
whose loved ones were stolen by illegal
immigration I've held the hands of the

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:10.479
weeping mothers and embraced the
grief-stricken fathers so sad so

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:16.639
terrible I will never forget the pain in
their eyes the tremble in their voices

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:24.050
and the sadness gripping their souls
how much more American blood must we

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:30.979
shed before Congress does its job for
those who refuse to compromise in the

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:37.570
name of border security
I would ask imagine if it was your child

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:46.630
your husband or your wife whose life was
so cruelly shattered and totally broken

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:54.440
to every member of Congress
pass a bill that ends this crisis to

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.380
every citizen call Congress and tell
them to finally after all of these

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:09.350
decades secure our border this is a
choice between right and wrong justice

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:15.530
and injustice this is about whether we
fulfill our sacred duty to the American

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:22.580
citizens we serve when I took the oath
of office I swore to protect our country

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:29.480
and that is what I will always do so
help me God

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.280
thank you and good night
