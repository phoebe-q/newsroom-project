00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.590
As the world tries to find an end to the lockdowns, 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.930
it's important to go back to the beginning. 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.860
President Trump did take steps to keep the virus out.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.720
When I learned about the gravity of it, 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.079
was sometime just prior to closing the country to China. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.170
But there were holes in his travel bans. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.460
And it took six weeks before he ended travel from Europe, 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.810
the other hotspot.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.280
It's going to disappear. 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.560
One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.170
During this time the virus spread largely undetected within America's borders. 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.570
Why wasn't more done to stop it?

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.160
Let's start by looking at the big picture. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.100
The main strategy for mitigating spread 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.500
has been to lock down communities. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.850
China did it in Wuhan and then the whole of Hubei province. 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.800
Then we saw Italy do it in the North and soon the whole of the country.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.160
Some have compared response times 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.220
in relation to first cases or first deaths. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.860
But to factor in population size, 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.560
we actually want to find the date when a country 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.120
had one death per million residents due to Covid-19. 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
And those points were reached at different times in various countries. 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.160
We can compare how quickly countries reacted 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.400
by putting those dates as Day 1 on the timeline. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
Germany, France and the UK locked down within days, 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.450
learning their lessons from Italy, 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.990
which took six days to lock down the entire country. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.520
The US, however, still hasn't declared a national lockdown 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.860
more than 45 days later. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.470
So if you look at what's going on in this country, 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.460
I just don't understand why we're not doing that. 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.810
We really shouldn't be. 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.170
So why didn't the US act sooner?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.710
In the end, most states did issue stay-at-home orders,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.920
covering 92% of the US population.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.050
But as this chart shows, 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.560
some states took action much faster than others. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.500
We'll look at that in more detail in a moment. 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.250
There are practical reasons for the different approaches. 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.940
It's a big country, with some places hit much harder 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.740
by the outbreak than others. 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.460
Plus, power is not as centralized in the US. 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.820
So a national lockdown is not as easy to do. 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.570
But the main reason why the US missed an opportunity 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.230
to get ahead of the virus was a lack of information 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.630
on how bad the outbreak really was. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.650
On January 20th and 21st, South Korea in the US confirmed their first case. 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.270
We have a totally under control. 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.850
It's one person coming in from China, 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.810
and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine. 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.900
Four days later, the CDC had developed a test kit and sought FDA approval, 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.670
while South Korea was already shipping its kits to labs across country.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.830
12 days after that, the CDC finally followed suit, 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.110
while South Korea was already developing a faster test and deploying that. 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.500
Looks like by April, you know, in theory when it gets a little warmer, 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.110
it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true. 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.120
Two days later, the CDC acknowledged that its tests were flawed, 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.870
and labs had to send results back to Atlanta.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.610
When you have 15 people, 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.190
and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.690
down to close to zero.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.600
That's a pretty good job we've done.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.180
By late February, nearly three of the more than 100 public labs 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.520
had a working CDC test. 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.790
They're there. They have the tests and the tests are beautiful. 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.670
Anybody that needs a test gets a test.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.110
By early March, and six weeks since the first case was detected, 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.410
just 3,000 Americans have been tested. 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.870
One in 100,000 residents, compared to 342 in South Korea.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.920
I call it the unseen, the unseen enemy, you call it... 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.290
there's a thousand different terms for it. 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.940
But what it snuck up on us.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.610
In mid March, the US had tested 31 people per 100,000 residents. 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.500
And while the US caught up and 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.040
surpassed South Korea's rate of testing on April 15, 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.050
those initial delays combined with a message coming from the President 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.920
had serious consequences for the US response. 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.500
Without good data from testing, US states were essentially flying blind 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.840
throughout February and early March. 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.850
If I get corona, I get corona. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.280
At the end of the day, I'm not gonna let it stop me from partying. 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.130
As life went on largely as normal. 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.190
The virus was spreading throughout the US.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.380
We're in very good shape. 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.210
People think that goes away in April. 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.500
People are getting better. 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.030
We're going down not up. 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.510
And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.640
You have the flu you recuperate. 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.410
35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.990
Maybe we have to step up our work on the flu 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.080
because when you lose that many people. That's something.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.600
Having regularly down-played the threat, 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.830
President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13th. 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.720
We are urging every state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.700
Three days later, the White House issued its social distancing guidelines. 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.890
On March 22nd, New York reported 100 deaths due to Covid. 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.240
So how did US states respond to the worsening situation here?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.150
Using the one death in a million measure again, 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.120
so we can compare states with different populations, 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.840
you can see that New York, the epicenter of the outbreak, 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.060
shut down after four days. 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.270
New Jersey could see what was happening to its neighbour 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.970
and brought in restrictions after two days. 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.160
Louisana, a hot spot thanks to Mardi Gras, took six days. 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.980
These states reacted quickly, 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.100
going into lockdown several days before reaching that grim milestone. 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.650
in a bid to contain the outbreak. 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.370
There are other areas that just aren't affected or they're affected very little. 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.520
And why would we close down 100% of the country? 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.080
Yet these Southern states did have deaths from Covid-19 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.610
and still waited much longer to order statewide shutdowns. 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.870
It took Georgia and South Carolina two full weeks 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.360
before they ordered residents to stay at home. 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.370
While Democratic governors shut their states down within 2.5 days 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.070
after seeing their first in 1 million deaths. 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.000
Republican governors waited more than a week longer.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.800
Nowhere in the world has responded perfectly to this pandemic. 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.480
But other countries have succeeded in keeping their death tolls down. 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.370
In contrast more often Americans have died from Covid-19 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.890
than were killed in the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.960
In those early weeks, the US missed opportunities 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.470
to contain the spread and save more lives.
