00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.020
This week, Boris Johnson
turned to the issue

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.940
of compulsory Covid vaccinations.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.700
- I don't believe we can
keep going indefinitely

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.240
with non-pharmaceutical
interventions.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.220
I mean, restrictions
on people's way of life.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.960 position:69%
I think we're going to need to have a
national conversation about the way forward.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.280
- The prime minister wants
this national conversation

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.060
because he knows this
pandemic isn't over.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.880
Covid daily infection rates
in Europe are going up.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.860 position:61%
Infection rates in the US are going up.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.520
And when we look at deaths
and hospitalisations,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.000
there's a pattern.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.980
- We're seeing still, a pandemic of
the unvaccinated here,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.840
with more than 1,000
deaths a day in the US,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740 position:69%
almost entirely of unvaccinated individuals.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.160
- That's the US,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.840
it's the same in Germany.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.200 position:69%
- It's very difficult to get staff motivated

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.960 position:66%
to treat patients now on this fourth wave.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.380 position:56%
We are still seeing so many patients
that are not vaccinated.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.420 position:63%
- This is where we are with vaccination,
in these rich countries between 60%

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.700
and 70% of the population
are fully vaccinated.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.640
In Africa, it's less than 8%
with both doses.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.560 position:58%
These vaccination rates are a problem
three times over.


00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.100 position:58%
First, even in the richest countries,
healthcare systems are still exposed.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.340
- In some parts of the country,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.780 position:58%
you can only describe it as dramatic.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.560
Overfilled intensive care units,


00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.780
severely ill people who have
to be flown across Germany

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.240
to get the care they need.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.580
- Next, if the developing world
is under-vaccinated,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.120 position:59%
Covid has a better chance of mutating.
 


00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.880 position:61%
- Every person who's not immune to this
virus is essentially a viral factory

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.940
and a viral factory
is a variant factory.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.100
So we just have to get
the world immunised.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.520
- Then there's Omicron.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.780
- Certain features of Omicron,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
including its global spread
and large number of mutations,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.100 position:56%
suggest it could have a major impact
on the course of the pandemic.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.500
- And when faced with all of this,
there's a further problem.


00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.200
Governments have been asking
people to get vaccinated

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.640
and it has not been enough.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.620
- We have done 10 months
of campaigning,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.980
of trying to persuade people,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.520
but still, we have a certain share,
nearly one third of the population,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.880
which is hesitant.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.840
- The question now is:
what to do about that?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.460
Well, in Austria's case, it's made
jabs mandatory from February

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.820
and this is the justification.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.800
- We want to break out
of this vicious circle of virus

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.340
waves and discussions about
lockdowns and the only way,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.000 position:70%
the only exit ticket we have, is the vaccine.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.840
- That's Austria and each country
is considering its options.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.820 position:63%
Germany's new chancellor is Olaf Scholz.


00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.020 position:58%
He says he wants compulsory vaccines.
 


00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.620 position:70%
Already in Germany you can't go to lots of
places, including most shops and restaurants,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.420 position:66%
without a jab or being recently recovered.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.560 position:64%
Or there's New York City, workers in the
public and private sector must be jabbed.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.560
Here's the mayor's justification.
 


00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.000
- We cannot have shut downs
here in New York City,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.800
we've got to keep moving forward.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.080
The answer as always
is to use the things that work,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.320
vaccination works
and vaccine mandates work.
 


00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.140 position:77%
- But if they work, why is this so controversial?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.180
Well, first of all, for some,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.320
this is about individual liberty.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.000 position:66%
- We are a free country, I think everybody
is entitled to their own opinion.


00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.980
If we are going to be mandated to
have the vaccine,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.740 position:63%
I think our freedom is being suppressed.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.520 position:56%
- This assessment is not shared by
the president of America, Joe Biden.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.020
- It's not about freedom
or personal choice.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.320
It's about protecting yourself
and those around you.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.660 position:61%
- Joe Biden is pushing for a nationwide
vaccine mandate for private business,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.760
but that's being challenged
in the courts and Republicans

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.480
are among the most vocal critics.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.180 position:64%
This is the governor of Alabama tweeting:
 


00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.620
Overreach of government,
suppression of freedom,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.880 position:61%
these are two criticisms and in the UK,
the Health Secretary Sajid Javid

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.620
has other concerns too.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.880
- I think it's unethical

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.000
and also I think that at
a practical level, having some kind

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.540 position:56%
of universal mandate for vaccination
doesn't work.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.200 position:61%
- We're also seeing resistance to
stricter Covid policies on the streets.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.860
These are protesters in Austria,
earlier this month.


00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.760
And while opposition to compulsory
vaccines comes in a range of forms,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.460
it's worth remembering
this isn't a new idea.


00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.020
Back in the 19th century,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.140 position:56%
vaccine mandates were used widely in
Europe to tackle smallpox.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.340 position:64%
And right now many healthcare workers are
told they have to get a flu vaccine.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.080 position:61%
Vaccine mandates have saved many lives.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.680
But the World Health Organization
remains cautious about them.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.240 position:63%
- Mandates around vaccination are an
absolute last resort and only applicable

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.040
when all other feasible options
to improve vaccination uptake

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.640
have been exhausted.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.700 position:58%
- Evidently, some governments believe
they have reached that point.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.400
Maybe people have too.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.800
In Germany, one recent poll found
72% of Germans

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.040
in favour of compulsory vaccines.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.240
20% were against.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.120
But even if governments go ahead,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.100 position:59%
this can only be part of the equation,
because once again

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.240
we need to play the famous
Doctor Tedros phrase.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.940 position:73%
- None of us are safe until all of us are safe.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.200
- And this is where the issue gets
even more complicated,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.260 position:58%
because those in the West criticising
people who won't get the jab

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.240 position:59%
are also benefiting from governments
who prioritise them getting three jabs

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.560
over some in the world getting any.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.400 position:59%
So yes, the number of unvaccinated
people is a major factor in the threat

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.120
this pandemic poses.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.600
But mandating vaccines alone
won't address that.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.160
There will need to be a fairer
distribution of vaccines too.
