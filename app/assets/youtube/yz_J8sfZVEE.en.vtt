00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:18.080
SECTION - OF THE UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION. 

00:30:18.081 --> 00:30:20.313

ALL THINGS APPERTAINING TO THE 

00:30:20.515 --> 00:30:22.515

ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION 
AND LAWS SO HELP YOU GOD? 

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.795
&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE 
U.S. CAPITOL AS THE

00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:49.558
THIRD IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY IS ABOUT TO 

00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:51.791
GAVEL IN. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE 
FROM THE WASHINGTON POST. I AM 

00:30:51.993 --> 00:30:54.225
WITH THE KC. WE ARE EXPECTING A 
FIERCE DEBATE TODAY OVER THE 

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:56.258
RULES OF THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 

00:30:56.259 --> 00:30:58.694
JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE BY 
MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:30:59.443 --> 00:31:04.993
TO BOTH OF YOU. THINGS WILL GET 
UNDERWAY IN THE SENATE AT 1:00. 

00:31:05.193 --> 00:31:07.640
WE'VE GOT TIME TO DIG INTO WHAT 
TO EXPECT THE DAY ON THE 

00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:09.841
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WEEK TO 
COME.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.373
- HEAR FROM OPENING ARGUMENTS 
BUT THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON 

00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:19.208
PROCESS. WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT IS GOING TO BE 

00:31:19.423 --> 00:31:21.454
IMPORTANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM 
TODAY IS, YES, WE ARE NOT 

00:31:21.655 --> 00:31:23.688
HEARING THE START OF EACH SIDE 
OF THIS DEBATE MAKING THEIR 

00:31:23.888 --> 00:31:28.356
CASE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO SEE A 
SHOW OF MITCH McCONNELL'S 

00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:31.681
STRENGTH WITHIN HIS OWN CAUCUS. 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY 

00:31:39.708 --> 00:31:41.582
IS THAT THE SENATORS ARE GOING 
TO DEBATE AND THEN VOTE ON HIS 

00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:43.425
PLAN THAT HE RELEASED YESTERDAY 
FOR HOW HE WOULD LIKE THE SENATE

00:31:43.426 --> 00:31:45.453
TRIAL TO GO. AND THIS WILL BE A 
VERY TANGIBLE RESULT FOR HIM AND

00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:47.436
NOT HIS FIRST BUT ONE OF HIS 
FIRST BIG ACTIONS. IN THE SENATE

00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:49.437
TRIAL.

00:31:53.138 --> 00:31:55.572
SO, WE WILL MOST LIKELY SEE ALL 
OF HIS, THE MEMBERS OF HIS 

00:31:55.772 --> 00:31:58.006
CAUCUS GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS, 
AT LEAST IN THIS INITIAL PHASE, 

00:31:58.221 --> 00:32:00.244
AND THEN IT WILL BE QUESTIONS 
AFTER THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE 

00:32:00.444 --> 00:32:02.542
LEARNED TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE 

00:32:02.683 --> 00:32:07.562
QUESTIONS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
DID, WHAT HE KNEW, AND WHO ALL 

00:32:07.765 --> 00:32:09.998
THESE PLAYERS ARE IN HIS ORBIT. 
YOU BEEN FOCUSED ON THIS FOR 

00:32:10.198 --> 00:32:12.433
MONTHS NOW. THERE IS A REAL 
QUESTION, WE'LL GET TO HEAR FROM

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:15.067
ANY NEW WITNESSES. IF WE WILL 
GET EVEN SEE ANY OF THE NEW 

00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:18.281
DOCUMENT SET UP AND COMING OUT, 
POURING OUT LAST WEEK. IF ANY OF

00:32:18.432 --> 00:32:21.982
THAT WILL MAKE THEIR WAY INTO 
THE SENATE TRIAL. HOW 

00:32:22.183 --> 00:32:23.599
SIGNIFICANT IS THAT QUESTION IN 
YOUR MIND? 

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.994
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S PRETTY 
SIGNIFICANT. THE WAY THE WORLD 

00:32:26.142 --> 00:32:29.701
WORKS NOW IS, YOU KIND OF ALWAYS
NEED SOMETHING NEW TO KEEP A 

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.295
STORY PROPELLING FORWARD AND TO 
KEEP PEOPLE'S INTEREST. SO, FOR 

00:32:32.446 --> 00:32:36.605
THEM FROM THE DEMOCRATS 
PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:32:36.805 --> 00:32:39.066
VERY HELPFUL FOR THEM IF THEY 
COULD FIND NEW INFORMATION 

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.673
BEYOND JUST THE CASE THAT WAS 
MADE IN THE HOUSE. AND THEY HAVE

00:32:43.709 --> 00:32:46.129
SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE 
VERY SIGNIFICANT STORIES TO TELL

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.708
WHO HAVE INDICATED AT LEAST SOME
WILLINGNESS TO TELL THEM. MOST 

00:32:56.924 --> 00:32:58.341
ESPECIALLY, JOHN BOLTON, THE 
FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY 

00:32:58.342 --> 00:33:00.342
ADVISOR, WHO HAS INDICATED THAT 
HE WOULD BE POTENTIALLY WILLING 

00:33:00.375 --> 00:33:02.811
TO TESTIFY TO THE SENATE. HE DID
NOT TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE 

00:33:03.011 --> 00:33:05.246
HOUSE BECAUSE HIS LEGAL TEAM HAD
SAID THAT THEY NEEDED A COURT 

00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:09.315
ORDER FIRST. AND THE DEMOCRATS 
DID NOT PURSUE THAT. AND THEN, 

00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:12.287
THIS GIULIANI ASSOCIATE, LES 
PARNAS CAME OUT WITH NEW 

00:33:12.431 --> 00:33:15.585
DOCUMENTS AND INTERVIEWS, WHO 
VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BE 

00:33:15.738 --> 00:33:20.685
CALLED TO TELL HIS STORY. 
&gt;&gt; SENATOR - SPOKE WITH 

00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:23.320
REPORTERS MOMENTS AGO. HE CALLED
LEADER McCONNELL'S RESOLUTION A 

00:33:23.321 --> 00:33:25.321
NATIONAL DISGRACE. HE SAID THEY 
WOULD GO DOWN

00:33:29.221 --> 00:33:30.838
IN HISTORY AS A DARK DAY. LET'S 
LISTEN. 

00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:33.194
&gt;&gt; IT APPEARS THAT LEADER 
McCONNELL DECIDED TO GO ALONG 

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.958
WITH THE PRESIDENTS DESIRE TO 
COVER UP HIS WRONGDOING. HOOK, 

00:33:39.173 --> 00:33:41.173
LINE, AND SINKER. IT ALMOST 
SEEMS THAT THE RESOLUTION WAS 

00:33:41.193 --> 00:33:45.259
WRITTEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT 
IN THE SENATE. OF THE MacCONNELL

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.522
RESOLUTION IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR 
AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL ON 

00:33:48.664 --> 00:33:50.664
FAST-FORWARD.

00:33:52.779 --> 00:33:55.481
IT ASKS THE SENATE TO SPRINT 
THROUGH THE TRIAL AS FAST AS 

00:33:55.618 --> 00:33:58.867
POSSIBLE, AND MAKES GETTING 
EVIDENCE AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. 

00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:05.203
THE BOTTOM LINE, LEADER 
McCONNELL ONCE THE PROCESS 

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.380
RUSHED

00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:11.171
, WITH AS LITTLE EVIDENCE AS 
POSSIBLE IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. 

00:34:11.471 --> 00:34:13.471
&gt;&gt; THAT IS SENATOR SCHUMER

00:34:18.772 --> 00:34:20.808
TALKING TO REPORTERS A FEW 
MOMENT AGO. NATALIE, HE HAS A 

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.010
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT AUDIENCES. 
ONE IS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, AND 

00:34:23.044 --> 00:34:25.480
WHAT I THINK MODERATE 
REPUBLICANS THAT HE MIGHT BE 

00:34:25.681 --> 00:34:29.094
ABLE TO PULL OVER TO HIS SIDE OF
THINGS. SO, HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:31.233
IN HIS MESSAGING

00:34:36.249 --> 00:34:39.083
. DOES HE GO VERY POLITICAL? OR 
DOES HE REIN IT IN A LITTLE BIT 

00:34:39.298 --> 00:34:40.715
TO NOT SCARE OFF THOSE MODERATE 
REPUBLICANS? 

00:34:40.716 --> 00:34:43.150
&gt;&gt; YES, AND THE AUDIENCE ARE A 
LITTLE BIT ONE IN THE SAME 

00:34:43.352 --> 00:34:45.586
BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT IS GOING 
TO BE DETERMINING FACTORS FOR 

00:34:45.787 --> 00:34:47.620
THESE MODERATE REPUBLICANS, SOME
OF THEM LIKE SENATOR STEVEN 

00:34:47.621 --> 00:34:50.030
COLLINS FROM MAINE ARE UP FOR 
REELECTION NEXT, THIS YEAR. AND,

00:34:52.293 --> 00:34:54.328
PUBLIC SENTIMENT ABOUT WHAT IS 
GOING ON IS PRETTY SIMILAR. BUT 

00:34:54.526 --> 00:34:58.179
YES, MORE NEAR-TERM, THERE IS 
JUST A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE, HIS 

00:34:58.381 --> 00:35:00.414
COLLEAGUES WHO HE IS REALLY 
TRYING TO SPEAK TO AND REALLY 

00:35:00.614 --> 00:35:03.183
TRYING TO PRESSURE. AND THEY ARE
ALSO GETTING PRESSURE FROM THE 

00:35:03.325 --> 00:35:04.478
REPUBLICAN SIDE FOR THE OPPOSITE
OUTCOME. 

00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:06.482
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. LET'S GO TO OUR 
COLLEAGUE RHONDA KOKICH

00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:18.704
ON CAPITOL HILL. RHONDA, THANKS 
FOR JOINING US. I KNOW YOU'RE 

00:35:18.905 --> 00:35:20.905
JUST AT THAT SCHUMER PRESS 
CONFERENCE A FEW MOMENTS AGO. 

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.173
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HEARING TALKED
ABOUT TODAY? I WOULD ALSO LIKE 

00:35:23.373 --> 00:35:25.605
TO FOR YOU TO LAY OUT WHAT TO 
EXPECT GOING FORWARD THIS 

00:35:25.807 --> 00:35:27.224
AFTERNOON. 
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, LIBBY, I WAS 

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.225
JUST IN THE MINORITY LEADER'S 
PRESS CONFERENCE.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.946
I WAS FILLED WITH REPORTERS. I 
CAN HAVE THE GET HIM. EVERYONE 

00:35:35.146 --> 00:35:37.380
WANTS TO HEAR WHAT THE MINORITY 
IS SAYING NOW THAT WERE ONLY 

00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:39.829
ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE 
START OF THIS TRIAL. WHAT HE 

00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:42.467
SAID IN THE PRESS CONFERENCES 
THAT, AS YOU JUST SAID, IT WAS A

00:35:42.667 --> 00:35:44.083
NATIONAL DISGRACE. THE 
RESOLUTION THAT MITCH McCONNELL 

00:35:44.084 --> 00:35:46.119
CAME UP WITH IS A NATIONAL 
DISGRACE AND IT IS REALLY 

00:35:46.326 --> 00:35:48.517
PUTTING A LOT OF THE POTENTIAL 
EVIDENCE, POTENTIAL WITNESSES 

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.002
AND HOUSE EVIDENCE UNDER THE 
CLOAK OF DARKNESS. AND HE AND 

00:35:51.202 --> 00:35:53.668
OTHER DEMOCRATS THAT I AM 
HEARING FROM ON THE HILL THIS 

00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:58.721
MORNING, I REALLY DECRYING THIS 
RESOLUTION SAYING THAT MITCH 

00:35:58.922 --> 00:36:00.745
McCONNELL PROMISED THAT THIS 
WOULD BE LIKE THE CLINTON 

00:36:00.746 --> 00:36:02.746
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS, BUT IT IS 
ACTUALLY

00:36:06.026 --> 00:36:08.026
VERY MUCH DEVIATING FROM THAT 
PROCESS. NOW, PART OF THE 

00:36:08.061 --> 00:36:10.061
STICKING POINTS IN THAT 
RESOLUTION THAT WE ARE GOING TO 

00:36:10.094 --> 00:36:12.931
SEE VOTED ON TODAY IS THAT THIS 
WILL ALL PLAY OUT. THE OPENING 

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.165
ARGUMENTS WILL PLAY OUT OVER A 
24-HOUR PERIOD. THAT WILL BE 

00:36:15.364 --> 00:36:17.364
BROKEN UP BETWEEN TWO DAYS.

00:36:23.897 --> 00:36:25.930
IN THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL, THEY ALSO HAD A LIMIT OF 

00:36:26.132 --> 00:36:28.167
OPENING ARGUMENTS FOR 24 HOURS. 
BUT THAT WAS SPREAD OUT AND 

00:36:28.368 --> 00:36:32.436
THERE WAS NO TIME LIMIT. BUT AS 
EARLY AS THIS WEDNESDAY, WE 

00:36:32.637 --> 00:36:34.469
MIGHT SEE THE PRESIDENT'S 
COUNSEL AND HOUSE MANAGERS START

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.706
THEIR ARGUMENTS. THEN THEY WILL 
HAVE TO BE WRAPPED UP BY FRIDAY.

00:36:36.906 --> 00:36:38.729
SO, HOUSE DEMOCRATS, THE 
MANAGERS AND ALSO DEMOCRATS IN 

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.730
THE SENATE ARE REALLY UPSET 
ABOUT THESE RESOLUTIONS

00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:46.446
. THE PIECES OF THIS RESOLUTION 
THAT THEY ARE FINDING QUITE 

00:36:46.645 --> 00:36:51.930
TROUBLING. THE OTHER PART THAT 
SENATOR SCHUMER BROUGHT UP IS 

00:36:52.129 --> 00:36:54.164
THAT THE RECORD OF EVIDENCE FROM
THE HOUSES INVESTIGATION OF THIS

00:36:54.365 --> 00:36:56.197
PROCESS, THAT WILL NOT BE 
ALLOWED TO BE AUTOMATICALLY 

00:36:56.198 --> 00:36:58.198
ENTERED INTO THE SENATE TRIAL

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:04.321
UNLESS THERE IS A VOTE TO 
INCLUDE THOSE RECORDS. IN THE 

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:06.353
PRESS CONFERENCE JUST NOW, 
PRESIDENT SCHUMER SAID IF THERE 

00:37:06.354 --> 00:37:08.791
IS NO EVIDENCE, THERE REALLY IS 
NO TRIAL. SO, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS

00:37:08.992 --> 00:37:11.439
ON THE HILL RIGHT NOW I VERY 
FRUSTRATED. YOU SEE THAT SORT OF

00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:14.152
AS A CLIENT FLASHPOINT BEFORE WE
EVEN GET STARTED TODAY. 

00:37:14.153 --> 00:37:17.526
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEWS FROM THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS. THEY HAVE SENT A 

00:37:17.727 --> 00:37:19.936
LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT'S LEAD 
LAWYER, WHAT ARE THEIR CONCERNS?

00:37:21.605 --> 00:37:23.817
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH. THAT WAS JUST
THIS MORNING, JUST A FEW HOURS 

00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:26.031
AGO. HOUSE MANAGERS SENT A 
RECORD

00:37:30.732 --> 00:37:32.968
. HE IS GOING TO BE THE LEAD 
COUNSEL ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:35.199
TEAM THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL. THEY
SAY THAT BASED ON THE EVIDENCE 

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.434
THAT THEY COLLECTED IN THE HOUSE
THROUGHOUT THE LAST FEW MONTHS, 

00:37:37.634 --> 00:37:39.870
AND HE IS A WITNESS HIMSELF. HE 
SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING WITH ANY 

00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:45.152
KNOWLEDGE HE HAS, ANY EVIDENCE, 
ANY EVIDENCE BEFORE THE TRIAL 

00:37:45.353 --> 00:37:47.587
GET STARTED. NOW WE ARE ONLY 
ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE 

00:37:47.789 --> 00:37:50.235
TRIAL GETTING STARTED AND WE 
HAVE NOT HEARD IF HE IS WILLING 

00:37:50.436 --> 00:37:52.470
TO COOPERATE WITH THAT. BUT THEY
POINTED OUT THAT IN THE 

00:37:53.227 --> 00:37:55.424
TESTIMONIES ON THE HILL, THE 
TESTIMONY OF COLONEL GOODMAN. 

00:37:55.711 --> 00:38:00.189
THOSE PEOPLE AND OTHER WITNESSES
TO THE HOUSE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.443
WENT TO ONE OF THE DEPUTIES OF 
THE PRESIDENTS LEAD COUNSEL, THE

00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:07.293
BALONEY. THEY SAID IF YOU ARE 
THE BOSS AND THEN YOU ABOUT THE 

00:38:07.493 --> 00:38:09.493
WITHHOLDING OF A. THEY HAVE

00:38:13.389 --> 00:38:15.624
NAMED HIM ABS A WITNESS. THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS ALSO HAD A PRESS 

00:38:15.825 --> 00:38:17.825
CONFERENCE EARLY THIS MORNING 
WHERE THEY WENT OVER THAT AND 

00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:20.516
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
HIM TO BE FORTHCOMING AS A 

00:38:20.657 --> 00:38:22.657
WITNESS.

00:38:28.014 --> 00:38:29.430
LIBBY? 
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, RHONDA COLVIN FROM

00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:31.463
CAPITOL HILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH 
IT WILL CONTINUE CHECKING IN 

00:38:31.663 --> 00:38:33.493
WITH CAPITOL HILL THROUGHOUT 
THIS AFTERNOON. WE EXPECT THE 

00:38:33.494 --> 00:38:35.930
SENATE TO GET UNDERWAY AT 1:00. 
A LITTLE LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM 

00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:38.366
NOW.  NATALIE, LET'S GO OVER 
JUST WHAT THE CONTOURS OF THIS 

00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:40.815
MAY LOOK LIKE. RHONDA EXPLAINED 
THIS IDEA OF 24 HOURS FOR EACH 

00:38:41.014 --> 00:38:43.249
SIDE TO PRESENT THE CASE. THAT 
FOLLOWS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT 

00:38:43.449 --> 00:38:45.067
HAPPENED DURING THE CLINTON 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, WHICH MITCH 

00:38:45.068 --> 00:38:49.751
McCONNELL SAID HE REALLY WANTED 
TO STICK WITH. OVER TIME. SO, 

00:38:50.553 --> 00:38:53.292
THERE IS A WEIRD QUESTION OF 
JUST HOW THAT TIME WOULD BE 

00:38:53.429 --> 00:38:58.272
BROKEN UP. BECAUSE THEY ONLY 
HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO DO IT. 

00:38:58.486 --> 00:39:02.541
&gt;&gt; THAT SEEMS TO COME AS QUITE A
SURPRISE. TO MANY PEOPLE 

00:39:02.742 --> 00:39:04.742
YESTERDAY WHEN WE SAW THE 
RESOLUTION THAT SENATOR 

00:39:04.862 --> 00:39:08.103
McCONNELL INTRODUCED. SO, TWO 
DAYS TO GIVE 24 HOUR ARGUMENTS. 

00:39:08.243 --> 00:39:10.243
NOW,

00:39:12.905 --> 00:39:15.944
IF YOU ARE STARTING A TRIAL AT 1
PM AND YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A

00:39:16.157 --> 00:39:18.882
VERY STRONG CASE, YOU SEE THAT 
THAT GOES VERY DEEP INTO THE 

00:39:19.021 --> 00:39:21.021
NIGHT

00:39:26.714 --> 00:39:28.714
, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS, AS ROB 
WAS SAYING EARLIER, CATCHING 

00:39:28.748 --> 00:39:30.567
ATTENTION SPANS, KEEPING PEOPLE 
FOCUSED, GETTING NEW MATERIAL IS

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.600
VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS BATTLE 
FOR YOU KNOW, PROXY BATTLE FOR 

00:39:32.815 --> 00:39:35.036
PUBLIC OPINION, I WOULD SAY. IF 
YOU'RE MAKING THAT PITCH IN THE 

00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:38.702
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THAT IS NOT
IDEAL. NOT IDEAL FOR PRESIDENT 

00:39:38.902 --> 00:39:40.532
TRUMP'S SITE EITHER, 
POTENTIALLY, BUT YOU HAVE TO 

00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:43.198
THINK THAT THEY DON'T REALLY 
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. HE AND 

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.806
McCONNELL PLANNING SEEM TO BE 
PRETTY IN SYNC OVER THE COURSE 

00:39:46.007 --> 00:39:47.839
OF THIS. 
&gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.926
POST RULES. 15 HOURS FOR 
QUESTIONS. FOUR HOURS OF DEBATE 

00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:55.558
ON THE WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS. 
THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT. 

00:39:55.759 --> 00:39:57.959
BY LEADER McCONNELL. 
&gt;&gt; YES. AND WE ARE SORT OF

00:40:03.681 --> 00:40:05.717
LOOKING, IF YOUR CALENDAR 
WATCHING LIKE MANY OF US ARE. WE

00:40:05.917 --> 00:40:08.152
HAVE GOT IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS 
COMING UP, THE STATE OF THE 

00:40:08.353 --> 00:40:10.387
UNION IS EXACTLY 2 WEEKS FROM 
TODAY. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP 

00:40:10.587 --> 00:40:15.871
HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO HAVE 
ALL OF THIS WRAPPED UP BY THEN. 

00:40:16.688 --> 00:40:18.688
SO, IF THAT IS ALSO SENATOR 
McCONNELL SCHOOL, YOU COULD 

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.741
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE WHY
HE IS PUTTING THIS CONDENSED 

00:40:20.954 --> 00:40:22.954
TIMELINE IN PLACE. 
&gt;&gt; LEV PARNAS CAME OUT LAST WEEK

00:40:22.975 --> 00:40:24.805
AND DID A COUPLE OF TELEVISION 
INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS RELEASE 

00:40:24.806 --> 00:40:26.814
FROM  HOUSE DEMOCRATS THAT 
BACKED UP HIS CLAIMS

00:40:33.944 --> 00:40:36.392
. THERE'S A QUESTION OF JUST HOW
RELIABLE OF A WITNESS HE IS 

00:40:36.593 --> 00:40:38.593
BECAUSE HE IS UNDER INDICTMENT. 
BUT THE MATERIAL EVIDENCE, LIKE 

00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:40.625
THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE, THESE 
TEXTS THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH, 

00:40:40.646 --> 00:40:42.679
DEMOCRATS WOULD REALLY LOVE TO 
HAVE THAT PART OF THE NATIONAL 

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.138
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. 
&gt;&gt; WE HEARD REPUBLICANS PUSH 

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:48.577
BACK AND SAY WHY WASN'T THIS 
BROUGHT UP EARLIER? THIS IS NOT 

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.779
PART OF THE INFORMATION WE ARE 
GETTING FROM THE HOUSE 

00:40:50.812 --> 00:40:52.845
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. SO, WHY 
BRING IT UP NOW TO MARK 

00:40:52.846 --> 00:40:54.846
&gt;&gt; SO, AS YOU MENTIONED,

00:40:58.532 --> 00:41:00.552
LEV PARNAS IS UNDER INDICTMENT 
IN NEW YORK. THIS WAS MATERIAL 

00:41:00.766 --> 00:41:06.038
THAT WAS SEIZED BY THE FBI  WHEN
HE WAS ARRESTED. BOTH FROM HIS 

00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:08.776
HOME, WHICH WAS SEARCHED, AND 
ALSO WHEN THEY SEIZED HIS CELL 

00:41:08.921 --> 00:41:10.921
PHONE. SO,

00:41:13.155 --> 00:41:15.389
ALL OF THAT MATERIAL HAS BEEN 
LOCKED UP IN THE CRIMINAL CASE. 

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.822
FIRST IT HAD TO BE ESSENTIALLY 
RETURNED TO HIM AND HIS LAWYER. 

00:41:18.022 --> 00:41:20.022
AND THEN, THEY HAD TO SEEK 
PERMISSION, BOTH FROM THE 

00:41:20.056 --> 00:41:22.056
PROSECUTION AND FROM THE JUDGE

00:41:25.341 --> 00:41:27.572
TO TURN THIS OVER TO CONGRESS, 
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS RESPONSIVE TO

00:41:27.772 --> 00:41:29.604
A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA. SO, 
THAT ACTUALLY CAME THROUGH. THAT

00:41:29.605 --> 00:41:32.041
PERMISSION CAME THROUGH FROM THE
JUDGE. A WEEK AGO SATURDAY. AND 

00:41:32.242 --> 00:41:34.697
ON SUNDAY, HIS LAWYER CAME TO 
TOWN TO HANDOFF THAT MATERIAL. 

00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:40.325
SO, THE ANSWER OF WHY NOW IS, IT
WAS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL NOW. BUT

00:41:46.063 --> 00:41:48.063
IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THE MATERIAL 

00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:50.318
IS QUITE VOLUMINOUS. WHAT THEY 
HAVE PUT OUT SO FAR IS HUNDREDS 

00:41:51.068 --> 00:41:55.200
OF PAGES OF MATERIAL. I THINK 
THEY MAY HAVE MORE STILL THAT 

00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:57.635
THEY HAVE NOT FINISHED SIFTING 
THROUGH. A LOT OF IT IS IN 

00:41:57.835 --> 00:41:59.666
RUSSIAN. IT IS TEXT MESSAGES 
BETWEEN ESTHER PARNAS AND 

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:01.898
VARIOUS OFFICIALS AND UKRAINIAN.
THEY PUT OUT SEVERAL HUNDRED  

00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:04.099
PAGES OF UNTRANSLATED RUSSIAN 
MATERIAL. AND, THERE 

00:42:04.168 --> 00:42:06.168
CONTEMPORANEOUS TEXT MESSAGES.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.288
THE WAY YOU HAVE TO WORK THOSE 
INTO A CASE, YOU HAVE TO REALLY 

00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:16.735
SORT OF ANALYZE THEM, PUT THEM 
ON A TIMELINE, AND KIND OF 

00:42:17.498 --> 00:42:20.992
FIGURE OUT WHAT HOLES THAT KIND 
OF COMMUNICATION CAN STILL, HOW 

00:42:21.192 --> 00:42:23.399
DOES IT EXPAND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF
WHAT WAS GOING ON

00:42:31.555 --> 00:42:33.587
IN ANY PARTICULAR TIME TO BE 
ABLE TO SEE THIS CONTEMPORANEOUS

00:42:33.789 --> 00:42:35.789
COMMUNICATION. THE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE NOT REALLY HAD TIME TO DO 

00:42:35.824 --> 00:42:37.655
THAT. THEY MOSTLY, THEY 
HIGHLIGHTED A FEW DOCUMENTS WHEN

00:42:37.656 --> 00:42:39.656
THEY TRANSMITTED THEIR MATERIAL 
LAST WEEK. THEY MOSTLY JUST PUT 

00:42:39.677 --> 00:42:41.922
THIS OUT ON THE INTERNET AND LET
REPORTERS START READING IT. SO, 

00:42:42.122 --> 00:42:45.171
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE TIME, I 
THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED, TO 

00:42:45.372 --> 00:42:47.606
REALLY MAKE AS MUCH USE OF THIS 
MATERIAL AS THEY COULD HAVE. 

00:42:48.364 --> 00:42:52.687
&gt;&gt; WE DID GET SORT OF A TIP OF 
THE HAND LAST WEEK WHEN SUSAN 

00:42:52.888 --> 00:42:54.919
COLLINS WAS ONE OF THE 
REPUBLICANS AND SAID IF IT WAS 

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:57.554
NOT PART OF THE HOUSEWORK, WHY 
BRING IT UP NOW? AND THAT IS 

00:42:57.768 --> 00:43:02.637
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE, 
EVERYBODY IS WATCHING TO SEE IF 

00:43:02.837 --> 00:43:04.671
SHE WILL SIDE WITH DEMOCRATS 
OVER THIS PROCEDURAL MESSAGE. 

00:43:04.672 --> 00:43:06.739
SHOULD BE SEYMOUR WITNESSES, 
SHOULD WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE 

00:43:06.877 --> 00:43:08.877
BOUGHT

00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:13.193
BROUGHT INTO PLAY. THIS POINT 
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY CRACKS IN 

00:43:13.407 --> 00:43:15.665
SORT OF REPUBLICAN UNITY FOR 
KICKING THIS PROCESS OFF. 

00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:20.721
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. YES. AND I THINK WE 
ARE LOOKING TO SUSAN COLLINS, 

00:43:20.922 --> 00:43:23.357
BUT WE ARE ALSO, WE ARE SORT OF 
COUNTING ON SUSAN COLLINS AMONG 

00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:26.755
THE 3 VOTES AND AND A LOT OF THE
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS GOING TO 

00:43:26.906 --> 00:43:31.679
BE 3 REPUBLICANS. SENATOR 
COLLINS, SENATOR ROMNEY AND 

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.880
MAKOWSKI. POSSIBLY ONE AND A 
COUPLE OF OTHERS. BUT SUSAN 

00:43:33.915 --> 00:43:35.915
COLLINS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT 
BAROMETER OF WHETHER THINGS ARE 

00:43:35.948 --> 00:43:38.890
GOING TO NOT GO THE WAY THAT WE 
CURRENTLY EXPECT, WHICH WOULD BE

00:43:39.035 --> 00:43:42.854
TO GO, OR McCONNELL I WOULD SAY 
EXPECTS. BUT YES, REALLY 

00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:46.104
WATCHING HER CLOSELY. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING SAYING 

00:43:46.305 --> 00:43:52.604
THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM 
LEV PARNAS BUT NOT  - THE OTHER 

00:43:52.803 --> 00:43:54.637
GIULIANI ASSOCIATE. WHERE IS HE?
WHAT IS GOING ON? 

00:43:54.638 --> 00:43:57.254
&gt;&gt; THE HEADLINE OF OUR STORY IS 
WHERE'S IGOR? SO, HE IS

00:44:01.142 --> 00:44:03.170
ON THIS TEAM, ESSENTIALLY. THEY 
ARE BOTH UNDER THE SAME FEDERAL 

00:44:03.371 --> 00:44:05.371
INDICTMENT. THEY ARE JOINTLY 
CHARGED IN NEW YORK. THEY WERE 

00:44:05.402 --> 00:44:07.402
AT FIRST BOTH REPRESENTED BY 
LAWYERS

00:44:10.687 --> 00:44:12.720
THAT WERE ESSENTIALLY PICKED OUT
FOR THEM BY RUDY GIULIANI. THE 

00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:15.638
SAME LEGAL TEAM THAT REPRESENTED
PAUL MANAFORT AND ALSO ACTUALLY 

00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:20.466
JOHN DOWD, WHO WAS REPRESENTING 
THE PRESIDENT. AT SOME POINT, 

00:44:20.604 --> 00:44:22.604
WHEN

00:44:24.693 --> 00:44:27.142
LEV PARNAS WAS STILL IN JAIL, 
BEFORE HE GOT OUT ON BAIL, HE 

00:44:27.343 --> 00:44:30.177
DECIDED TO FIRE THAT LEGAL TEAM 
, AND WENT HIS OWN WAY. BUT, THE

00:44:30.592 --> 00:44:34.446
INTERESTING THING IS THAT OUR 
REPORTING ABOUT MR. FRUMAN SHOWS

00:44:34.646 --> 00:44:38.314
THAT THEY HAD THIS KIND OF 
PARTNERSHIP. LEV PARNAS HAD KIND

00:44:38.514 --> 00:44:43.068
OF THE GIFT OF GAB . HE WAS BORN
IN UKRAINE BUT MOVED TO THE 

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.508
UNITED STATES STATES AT AGE 3 SO
HE SPOKE COMPLETELY FLUENT, AND 

00:44:46.662 --> 00:44:48.662
ACCENTED ENGLISH.

00:44:51.915 --> 00:44:54.763
HE WAS KIND OF A CHARMER AND WAS
THE ONE WHO IN THE UNITED STATES

00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:56.976
WAS SEEN AS THE FACE OF THE 
PARTNERSHIP. BUT

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:03.900
WAS ONE WHO ACTUALLY KNEW PEOPLE
IN UKRAINE. SO, ALL OF THE 

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.100
PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO 
THIS STORY, AND THEY CONNECT 

00:45:06.133 --> 00:45:07.764
RUDY GIULIANI WITH THE 
PROSECUTORS WITH SANKO AND 

00:45:07.765 --> 00:45:09.797
SHOKIN THE AIDES TO PRESIDENT 
GALINSKY, ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE, 

00:45:10.558 --> 00:45:12.558
THEY GOT TO THROUGH

00:45:17.721 --> 00:45:20.355
IGOR FRUMAN. HE WAS ALSO THE ONE
WHO HAD SOME MONEY. THEY USE HIS

00:45:20.556 --> 00:45:22.556
MONEY TO MAKE CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTIONS I GOT THEM IN THE 

00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:24.623
ROOM WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP  AND 
OTHER TOP REPUBLICANS. HE IS 

00:45:24.823 --> 00:45:27.377
ACTUALLY A REALLY, REALLY KEY 
PLAYER. BUT SORT OF HOLDING TRUE

00:45:27.522 --> 00:45:29.522
TO WHAT

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:34.163
KIND OF PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ON 
THE PARTNERSHIP IS KIND OF THE 

00:45:34.376 --> 00:45:36.376
SILENT PARTNER AT THIS POINT. 
&gt;&gt; HOW IMPORTANT

00:45:40.063 --> 00:45:42.095
IS THIS TESTIMONY ALONG THESE 
LINES TO THE DEMOCRATS CASE? AND

00:45:42.296 --> 00:45:44.853
ALSO JUST GETTING OUT THE TRUTH.
RIGHT? THE POLITICS OF THIS. 

00:45:45.352 --> 00:45:46.964
GETTING OUT THE TRUTH OF WHAT 
ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 

00:45:46.965 --> 00:45:53.064
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I MEAN, ONE OF THE KEY ARGUMENTS

00:45:53.265 --> 00:45:55.897
THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED 
TO MAKE AND I THINK WE SAW IT IN

00:45:56.112 --> 00:45:58.344
SOME OF THE LEGAL MATERIAL FOR 
THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM, IS THAT HE

00:45:58.545 --> 00:46:03.010
WAS ALLOWED TO DO WHAT HE WAS 
DOING BECAUSE YOU KNOW, AS 

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.210
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HE IS ALLOWED TO FIGHT 

00:46:05.246 --> 00:46:07.279
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. AND IF HE
HAD INFORMATION THAT A U.S. 

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.165
CITIZEN WAS INVOLVED, 
POTENTIALLY, WITH CORRUPTION, 

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:12.563
JOE BIDEN, HE IS ALLOWED TO 
PRESS FOR INFORMATION. BUT I 

00:46:12.764 --> 00:46:17.235
THINK THAT WHAT THE LEV PARNAS  
INFORMATION SHOWS, THE NEW 

00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:22.306
INFORMATION, IS HOW MUCH THIS 
WAS NEVER ABOUT CORRUPTION IN 

00:46:22.507 --> 00:46:25.356
UKRAINE. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL INTEREST. 

00:46:25.557 --> 00:46:28.016
ONE REALLY KEY PIECE OF 
INFORMATION THAT THEY OBTAINED 

00:46:28.158 --> 00:46:30.158
FROM PARNAS THAT 

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.725
THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE WAS THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOW BEEN 

00:46:36.939 --> 00:46:39.173
TURNED OVER TO CONGRESSES THIS 
LETTER. IT IS A LETTER FROM RUDY

00:46:39.374 --> 00:46:41.608
GIULIANI TO PRESIDENT ZIELINSKI 
THAT LEV PARNAS TOOK WITH HIM 

00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:43.809
WHEN HE WENT TO 

00:46:47.907 --> 00:46:49.907
UKRAINE IN MAY. GIULIANI IS 
SEEKING A MEETING BECAUSE HE 

00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:52.575
THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GO ON 
THIS TRIP ALSO. HE IS SEEKING A 

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:55.414
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE, AND HE SAYS IN BLACK 

00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:58.014
AND WHITE, I AM GOING THERE 
REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT IN 

00:46:58.155 --> 00:47:01.710
HIS CAPACITY AS A PRIVATE 
CITIZEN. THE THINGS I WANT TO 

00:47:01.922 --> 00:47:04.550
TALK TO YOU ABOUT, I AM DOING AS
A PRIVATE LAWYER

00:47:08.423 --> 00:47:10.656
FOR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL. SO, HE
IS JUST SAYING IN BLACK AND 

00:47:10.856 --> 00:47:12.891
WHITE, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE 
NATIONAL INTEREST. THIS IS NOT 

00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:15.531
ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. THE THINGS
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU IS NOT 

00:47:15.724 --> 00:47:17.357
ABOUT CORRUPTION, BROADLY 
SPEAKING, AND CURRENT. IT IS 

00:47:17.358 --> 00:47:21.423
ABOUT MATTERS OF PERSONAL 
INTEREST TO DONALD TRUMP IN HIS 

00:47:21.624 --> 00:47:23.895
CAPACITY AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN. 
AND THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. 

00:47:24.037 --> 00:47:28.074
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO CAPITOL HILL 

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:30.917
WHERE CONGRESSIONAL REPORTS - 
REPORTER, HAS BEEN FOLLOWING

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.123
THING SO CLOSELY. WHAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO BE WATCHING FOR TODAY? 

00:47:41.323 --> 00:47:43.357
ARE YOU SEEING ANY CRACKS AND 
LIKE THE REPUBLICAN RANKS AS 

00:47:43.558 --> 00:47:46.404
LEADER McCONNELL HAS LAID OUT 
HOW HE WANTS HIS PROCESS TO GO? 

00:47:47.221 --> 00:47:49.655
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE ARE GOING TO BE 
LOOKING TO SEE WHAT MOTIONS THE 

00:47:49.856 --> 00:47:52.093
DEMOCRATS BRING UP. FIRST OF 
ALL, TO SEE WHAT KIND OF VOTES 

00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:54.526
WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING AS A 
PRELIMINARY MEASURE ON QUESTIONS

00:47:54.725 --> 00:47:56.760
ABOUT WITNESSES, QUESTIONS ABOUT
EXTERNAL DOCUMENT THAT WE ARE 

00:47:56.959 --> 00:47:58.993
NOT HAVING ON FILE. WHAT 
EVIDENCE THEY CAN REVIEW AND WHO

00:47:59.193 --> 00:48:01.936
THEY CAN HEAR FROM. I THINK WE 
ARE EXPECTING TO SEE SOME 

00:48:02.076 --> 00:48:04.076
REPUBLICANS BREAK

00:48:06.923 --> 00:48:09.558
ON THOSE VOTES IF THEY ARE MORE 
GENERAL, OR IF THEY HAVE TO DO 

00:48:09.759 --> 00:48:11.991
WITH PEOPLE THAT SEEM TO BE SO 
CLOSELY TIED TO THE NARRATIVE 

00:48:12.192 --> 00:48:14.441
AND EVIDENCE THAT AS YOU KNOW, 
IN BLACK AND WHITE. BUT THE 

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.913
QUESTION REALLY IS WHETHER THEY 
ARE FOR REPUBLICANS. YOU CAN - 

00:48:20.126 --> 00:48:22.148
YOU CAN COUNT LISA MURKOWSKI. 
UNLESS IT WAS A FOURTH ONE 

00:48:22.347 --> 00:48:24.347
THERE, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE 
THE VOTES, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T 

00:48:24.382 --> 00:48:29.064
HAVE THE VOTES TO BE ABLE TO GET
THEIR WAY TO GO FORWARD. WE ARE 

00:48:29.265 --> 00:48:31.898
ALSO LOOKING TO SEE IF THIS ALL 
PLAYS OUT IN THE OPEN. IF THEY 

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.334
END UP GOING INTO CLOSED SESSION
TO HAVE SOME SORT OF DEBATE 

00:48:34.547 --> 00:48:36.366
ABOUT THIS. THESE ARE OPEN 
QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW THE 

00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:38.199
DEMOCRATS WANT SETTLED AT THE 
OUTSET. ABOUT REPUBLICANS AND 

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.637
SAID NO, WE'RE GOING TO GO TO 
THE OPEN STAGES OF TRIAL BEFORE 

00:48:40.837 --> 00:48:43.273
WE GET TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHO WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW 

00:48:43.474 --> 00:48:47.540
TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS IN 
TERMS OF WITNESSES IF ANYBODY 

00:48:47.743 --> 00:48:49.975
ELSE IS ALLOWED THERE. THERE'S 
GOING TO BE A LOT OF WRANGLING 

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.212
BETWEEN THE PARTIES RIGHT NOW. 
JOCKEYING FOR THE SKI VOTES IN 

00:48:52.423 --> 00:48:54.442
THE MIDDLE. THAT WILL DETERMINE 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN SET 

00:48:54.656 --> 00:48:56.890
PARAMETERS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT
BROADER. WHICH IS WHAT THE HOUSE

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.505
DEMOCRATS WANT AS A PRESENT THE 
CASE. 

00:48:58.506 --> 00:49:01.556
&gt;&gt; YOU WHY?, WE KNOW WHAT LEADER
McCONNELL WANTS. AS MINORITY 

00:49:01.756 --> 00:49:03.991
LEADER SCHUMER JUST AT THE PRESS
CONFERENCE, HE WOULD NOT GIVE A 

00:49:04.205 --> 00:49:06.205
REPORTER, REPORTERS A SENSE OF 
HOW MANY

00:49:11.105 --> 00:49:13.140
AMENDMENTS THEY HAD. DEMOCRATS 
ARE TRYING TO SAY WE ARE NOT 

00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:15.574
DRAWING THIS OUT. WE ARE NOT 
DOING THIS TO DELAY. WE ARE 

00:49:15.774 --> 00:49:18.423
DOING THIS TO SEE IF WE CAN YOU 
KNOW, MOVE SOME GROUND HERE ON 

00:49:18.624 --> 00:49:23.495
THE ISSUES WE ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT. SO, DO WE HAVE A SENSE 

00:49:23.695 --> 00:49:26.346
YET OF LIKE WHAT TODAY IS REALLY
GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF 

00:49:26.547 --> 00:49:28.810
TIMING AND PROCEDURE? 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I THINK ALL OF US 

00:49:28.951 --> 00:49:31.816
ARE RACING FOR POTENTIALLY 
LATE-NIGHT EVEN THOUGH AS YOU 

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.492
POINTED OUT, SENATOR SCHUMER IS 
TRYING TO INDICATE IF THIS GOES 

00:49:34.634 --> 00:49:36.634
LATEST

00:49:39.947 --> 00:49:41.947
NOT BECAUSE IT'S A DELAYING 
TACTIC BUT BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:44.213
TRYING TO PUSH APPOINTIVE OPEN 
THIS UP SO THEY CAN GET THE 

00:49:44.413 --> 00:49:46.648
WITNESSES THEY WANT TO BE PART 
OF THE PROCESS. WE DON'T KNOW 

00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:48.882
EXACTLY HOW MANY MOTIONS THEY 
ARE GOING TO RAISE, ALTHOUGH IT 

00:49:49.082 --> 00:49:51.318
IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE AN 
INFANT NUMBER BECAUSE YOU START 

00:49:51.531 --> 00:49:55.584
TO LOSE YOUR AUDIENCE OF THAT 
POINT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW 

00:49:56.402 --> 00:49:58.635
WHERE THIS IS GOING TO ALL BE 
HASHED OUT AND FULLY DEBATED, 

00:49:58.834 --> 00:50:00.834
GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS ON WHAT 
SENATORS CAN AND CAN'T SAY 

00:50:00.868 --> 00:50:03.301
DURING THE REGULAR PROCEEDINGS 
ON THE FLOOR. THEY'RE SUPPOSED 

00:50:03.515 --> 00:50:05.748
TO BE KEEPING THEIR OWN COUNSEL 
FOR THE MOST PART UNLESS THERE 

00:50:05.949 --> 00:50:08.182
ARE SPECIFIC MOTIONS RACE THAT 
REQUIRE A VOTE. SO, I THINK THIS

00:50:08.383 --> 00:50:11.031
IS ALL GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
AND PLAY DEPENDING ON HOW THE 

00:50:11.232 --> 00:50:13.484
PRELIMINARY AND THE OPENING 
MOVES WORK. WE WILL SEE MORE

00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:24.437
, IT DEPENDS ON IF DEMOCRATS 
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE WIND AT 

00:50:24.637 --> 00:50:26.870
THE BACKS BASICALLY WHEN THIS 
BEGINS. AND IS MUCH AS WE ARE 

00:50:27.071 --> 00:50:29.104
STARTING AND YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
PROCESS IN ABOUT ANOTHER HOUR, 

00:50:29.306 --> 00:50:31.540
WE ARE GOING TO BE SEEING THESE 
DISCUSSIONS GO ON INTENSELY SO 

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.740
THAT PEOPLE CAN FIGURE OUT 
WHETHER THERE ACTUALLY IS ANY 

00:50:33.775 --> 00:50:36.012
SORT OF DEALMAKING TO BE DONE 
HERE. AS MUCH AS SENATORS ARE 

00:50:36.213 --> 00:50:40.076
GOING TO BE ON THE FLOOR, KIND 
OF LOCKED INTO THE TRIAL 

00:50:40.278 --> 00:50:42.278
PROCESS, THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE 
GOING TO CONTINUE IN LARGE PART 

00:50:42.312 --> 00:50:45.762
BETWEEN STAFFERS AND OTHERS IF 
THEY HASH OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU 

00:50:45.962 --> 00:50:48.197
KNOW, THE FORMAL LANGUAGE WILL 
LOOK LIKE AS IT GETS TO THE 

00:50:48.398 --> 00:50:53.281
FLOOR. AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
AN EXACT TIME SENSE RIGHT NOW 

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:55.715
HOW LONG THIS WILL GO THIS 
EVENING, BUT I THINK WE ARE 

00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:57.747
BRACING FOR THIS WHOLE WEEK, 
REALLY. BETWEEN THE MOTION 

00:50:57.748 --> 00:51:00.585
TONIGHT AND THE 24 HOURS 
CONDENSED INTO TWO DAYS. EACH 

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.400
RULE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE 
PUSHING FOR THE ARGUMENTS FROM 

00:51:03.433 --> 00:51:08.515
EITHER SIDE, WE ARE LOOKING AT 
MIDNIGHT, 1 AM OR LATER. FOR AN 

00:51:08.715 --> 00:51:11.509
OPENING WEEK OF THIS TRIAL. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. SO, AS WE ALL BRACE FOR

00:51:17.248 --> 00:51:19.885
THESE LONG DAYS AND LONG NIGHTS,
CAN YOU TALK TO WAS A LITTLE BIT

00:51:20.082 --> 00:51:22.116
ABOUT YOUR COVERAGE ABILITIES? 
MUCH HAS BEEN MADE, THERE IS A 

00:51:22.328 --> 00:51:24.328
LOT OF CONCERN OVER JUST HOW 
MUCH ACCESS JOURNALISTS WILL 

00:51:24.362 --> 00:51:30.045
HAVE TO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. 
BECAUSE, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN LIKE

00:51:30.245 --> 00:51:32.477
PUSHED TO THE SIDE. YOU ARE 
LIMITED IN HOW YOU CAN ACCESS 

00:51:32.677 --> 00:51:34.677
SENATORS. YOU CAN'T EVEN BRING 
DEVICES INTO CERTAIN AREAS. SO, 

00:51:34.713 --> 00:51:37.147
AND YOU TAKE US THROUGH WHERE 
THAT FIGHT IS AT RIGHT NOW? 

00:51:37.148 --> 00:51:39.382
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WELL, THE DEVICE 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ROLE OF THE 

00:51:40.149 --> 00:51:42.149
SENATE THAT YOU CAN'T

00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:52.989
BRING CELL PHONES, COMPUTERS, 
THINGS LIKE THAT INTO THE 

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.024
CHAMBER. AS MUCH AS PEOPLE WERE 
HOPING THAT MY CHANGE FOR 

00:51:55.224 --> 00:51:56.453
IMPEACHMENT, GIVEN THE 
UP-TO-THE-MINUTE COVERAGE THAT 

00:51:56.454 --> 00:51:59.490
WE ALL WANT TO DO, IT HAS NOT. 
SO, WE WILL BE ON THE SAME BOAT 

00:51:59.704 --> 00:52:01.737
AS THE SENATORS WHEN WE ARE 
ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM OVERLOOKING

00:52:01.938 --> 00:52:04.571
THE GALLERY, FROM THE GALLERY TO
THE FLOOR. BUT WE HAVE TO DO A 

00:52:04.772 --> 00:52:06.772
LITTLE BIT OF FAST-MOVING AND 
PURE WEDDING AROUND THE CAPITAL,

00:52:06.805 --> 00:52:08.839
MORE SO THAN USUAL. THEY HAVE 
BEEN RESTRICTIONS PUT IN VARIOUS

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.073
HALLWAYS THAT WE NORMALLY WALK 
THROUGH WITH THE SENATORS TO GET

00:52:11.274 --> 00:52:13.274
THE THOUGHTS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING
ON REGULAR POLICY DAYS. THAT'S 

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.944
JUST AS VITAL RIGHT NOW, GIVEN 
THE FACT THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO BE

00:52:16.157 --> 00:52:18.188
IN THE MIDST OF AN IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL. BUT, WE ARE BASICALLY 

00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:20.622
BLOCKED OFF FROM CERTAIN PARTS 
OF THE 2nd FOUR, THE FIRST NIGHT

00:52:21.008 --> 00:52:23.764
OR, AT A NORMAL ROUTE FOLLOWING 
SENATORS UP TO UP THE ROUTE FROM

00:52:23.905 --> 00:52:25.905
THE BASEMENT

00:52:30.172 --> 00:52:32.192
WHICH REQUIRES A LITTLE EXTRA 
DANCING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:52:32.406 --> 00:52:34.842
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO EVENTUALLY 
END UP IF WE CAN CATCH THEM IN 

00:52:35.042 --> 00:52:37.779
THE NORMAL PROCESS OF WHERE THEY
ARE WALKING. THIS SORT OF, YOU 

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.920
KNOW, THE

00:52:43.171 --> 00:52:45.605
I GUESS THE BLUEPRINTS OF ALL OF
THIS, THE GEOGRAPHY OF ALL THIS 

00:52:45.805 --> 00:52:47.837
MATTERS JUST BECAUSE A LOT OF 
THE ORIGINAL REPORTING YOU ARE 

00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:50.687
ABLE TO DO FOR THINGS THAT MOVE 
IN REAL TIME AND MOVE QUICKLY ON

00:52:50.888 --> 00:52:52.920
THE FLOOR, LIKE AN IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL, IS IN BEING ABLE TO 

00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:55.153
CORNER CERTAIN PEOPLE AND GET 
THE REALLY CANDID, IN THE MOMENT

00:52:55.354 --> 00:52:57.384
RESPONSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT NOW 

00:52:57.585 --> 00:53:00.836
GIVEN THE RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE 
WE ARE ABLE TO GO THAT THE 

00:53:01.037 --> 00:53:03.486
SENATORS ARE GOING TO BE WALKING
THROUGH THAT WE CAN GET TO. 

00:53:03.487 --> 00:53:05.505
&gt;&gt; YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT 
OBVIOUSLY. YOU CANNOT BRING YOUR

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.741
DEVICES INTO THAT AREA BUT THAT 
- THERE'S A MAGNETOMETER IN 

00:53:07.955 --> 00:53:09.955
THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T 
SNEAK EVERYTHING IN THE 

00:53:09.974 --> 00:53:12.112
EVERYTHING IS LOCKDOWN, WHICH 
SEEMS LIKE ANOTHER LAYER OF 

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:14.856
LIGHT PROCESS, AND EFFORT FOR 
THE REPORTERS TO HAVE TO GO TO 

00:53:15.057 --> 00:53:18.104
TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THE 
PROCEEDINGS. 

00:53:18.105 --> 00:53:20.105
&gt;&gt; IT IS ANOTHER LAYER OF 
PROCESS. CERTAINLY, LOOK, THE 

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.140
ENERGY OF THE IMAGE OF HAVING 
THAT MAGNETOMETER

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:39.225
, IN ANY CASE, THE MANAGERS OF 
THE GALLERY WILL PULL YOU OUT OF

00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:41.460
THE GALLERY AND DENIAL YOUR 
ABILITY TO STAY THERE IF THEY 

00:53:41.674 --> 00:53:44.312
CATCH YOU WITH A PHONE. WHEN I 
WAS A VERY YOUNG REPORTER I DID 

00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:46.549
MAKE THAT MISTAKE ONCE. I DON'T 
THINK THE SEASONED REPORTERS ARE

00:53:46.749 --> 00:53:48.749
LIKELY TO MAKE IT AGAIN BUT THEY
ARE EXPECTING BASICALLY 

00:53:48.779 --> 00:53:51.215
EVERYBODY ON THEIR UNCLE TO BE 
HERE FROM THE MEDIA. I THINK A 

00:53:51.416 --> 00:53:53.850
LOT OF THE STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN
WITH THE FEAR THAT MAYBE PEOPLE 

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:56.496
WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES 
OF THE CAPITAL AND HOW THINGS GO

00:53:56.696 --> 00:53:58.930
GENERALLY, WILL START TO TRY TO 
BREAK THEM. BUT IN THE PROCESS, 

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.576
AS YOU POINTED OUT, BECAUSE THE 
PLANS ARE BEING MADE TO KIND OF 

00:54:01.776 --> 00:54:03.608
GUARD AGAINST THAT LEASE, 
DENOMINATOR OF WHAT IF SOMETHING

00:54:03.609 --> 00:54:06.043
GOES WRONG OR SOMEBODY IS NOT 
USED TO. FOR THOSE OF US WERE 

00:54:06.244 --> 00:54:08.677
VERY USED TO IT, THE WEB THESE 
THINGS ARE BEING WORKED, WE ARE 

00:54:08.893 --> 00:54:10.711
BEING BLOCKED AND HELD BACK 
WHICH COULD COMPROMISE OUR 

00:54:10.712 --> 00:54:14.781
ABILITY TO DO THIS REPORTED 
QUICKLY. WE ARE VERY, WE PRIDE 

00:54:14.983 --> 00:54:17.016
OURSELVES ON OUR INGENUITY AND 
KNOWING THE BACK CALLS OF THIS 

00:54:17.216 --> 00:54:20.353
PLACE AS MUCH AS WE DO IN 
FINDING SOME SORT OF WAY TO WORK

00:54:20.504 --> 00:54:26.353
AROUND AND FIND IT SO EVEN WHEN 
THEY A VEDAS IN A NORMAL 

00:54:26.554 --> 00:54:28.789
SITUATION, IN THIS, YOU HAVE GOT
BARRIERS PUT UP THAT WE ARE 

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:31.638
GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO 
WORK AROUND IN ADDITION OVER THE

00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:33.469
NEXT WEEK OR TWO AS THIS GOES 
ON. 

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.104
&gt;&gt; FINALLY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO 
GO AND SIT IN AND WATCH THE 

00:54:36.305 --> 00:54:38.340
PROCEEDINGS WHEN IT IS OPEN, 
WHEN IT IS NOT LOCKDOWN. WHICH 

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.573
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US 
BECAUSE WE ARE ONLY GOING TO 

00:54:40.773 --> 00:54:42.807
HAVE ONE CAMERA THAT IS 
CONTROLLED BY THE SENATE TO GIVE

00:54:43.008 --> 00:54:45.752
US THE FOOTAGE FROM THE FLOOR. 
SO, IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ARE 

00:54:45.895 --> 00:54:47.895
MULTIPLE CAMERAS

00:54:49.508 --> 00:54:51.945
. C-SPAN AND OTHERS HAVE FOUGHT 
TO GET MORE ACCESS AND PICK UP 

00:54:52.145 --> 00:54:54.594
SO WE WILL REALLY BE RELYING ON 
YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO TELL 

00:54:54.795 --> 00:54:56.828
US, WHAT WERE THE REACTIONS ON 
SENATORS BASIS? WERE USING SOME 

00:54:57.028 --> 00:54:58.848
TELLING SIGN OF HOW THEY WERE 
INTERPRETING THE INFORMATION 

00:54:58.849 --> 00:55:00.849
THAT THEY ARE GIVEN. 
&gt;&gt;

00:55:06.376 --> 00:55:08.608
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S REALLY WHERE
WE HAVE THE BEST VIEW. FICA FROM

00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:10.809
OUR VANTAGE POINT, WHERE THE 
PRESS EATS ARE INSIDE THE 

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.871
CHAMBER, WE CAN'T REALLY SEE 
JOHN ROBERTS BECAUSE HE IS KIND 

00:55:13.071 --> 00:55:15.506
OF DIRECTLY BELOW IS. SO, WE 
HAVE THE BEST VIEW OF THE FACES 

00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:17.721
OF THE LISTENING SENATORS AS 
THEY ARE SEATED THEIR

00:55:27.906 --> 00:55:30.138
KIND OF SEMI CIRCLE ARRANGEMENT 
AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND

00:55:30.339 --> 00:55:32.372
DOING. AND IF THEY ARE PAYING 
CLOSE ATTENTION OR TAKING NOTES 

00:55:32.573 --> 00:55:34.606
OR YAWNING OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE
THAT. AND READING FACES LIKE 

00:55:34.807 --> 00:55:36.841
THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT. AND 
ANYBODY WAS WHAT'S THE STATE OF 

00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:39.074
THE UNION CAN ATTEST, SOMETIMES 
IT IS THE REACTION OF THE 

00:55:39.275 --> 00:55:41.508
AUDIENCE THAT MATTERS AS MUCH AS
A SPEECH GOING ON FROM THE 

00:55:41.708 --> 00:55:44.557
PODIUM. SO, THAT IS ONE THING WE
WILL BE ABLE TO, OR WE WILL BE 

00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.758
HAVING TO TELL IN THE 
DESCRIPTORS WORDS AS WE CAN 

00:55:46.793 --> 00:55:49.026
MUSTER. AS THE DAY GOES THROUGH,
WHAT IS HAPPENING, WHAT IS SEEN 

00:55:49.227 --> 00:55:51.462
IN ADDITION TO THE WORDS SAID 
THAT EVERYONE WILL BE SEEN FROM 

00:55:51.662 --> 00:55:53.494
THE FIXED, FOCUSING ON THE 
PERSON ACTUALLY GIVING THE 

00:55:53.495 --> 00:55:55.540
ARGUMENT THE TIME. BOTH - ARE 
IMPORTANT. IS ALSO, LOOK, THIS 

00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:58.363
HAS BEEN THE WHOLE TIME IT IS 
BEEN A TRIAL THAT IS GOING TO 

00:55:58.578 --> 00:56:00.598
KIND A BIT WOODHOUSE DEMOCRATIC 
MANAGERS, THE CASES THEY WANT TO

00:56:00.813 --> 00:56:02.813
MAKE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND 
HIS SUPPORTERS, THE CASEY WANT 

00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:06.699
TO PUSH BACK. THE SENATE IS THE 
JURY TO CONVINCE, BUT IT IS ALSO

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.134
PLAYING OUT IN FRONT OF THE 
COUNTRY AND IT IS AN ELECTION 

00:56:09.335 --> 00:56:11.166
YEAR. YOU CANNOT DIVORCE 
YOURSELF FROM THAT BACK. SO, 

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:13.803
KIND OF BEING ABLE TO SEE ALL 
PARTS OF THIS, NOT JUST WHAT IS 

00:56:14.018 --> 00:56:16.048
GOING ON FROM THE LAWYERS, BUT 
ALSO, THE REPRESENTATIVES WHO 

00:56:16.249 --> 00:56:18.249
ARE SITTING THERE MAKING A

00:56:21.319 --> 00:56:23.319
JUDGMENT I THINK, EVERYBODY 
WANTS TO KNOW HOW EVERYBODY IS 

00:56:23.354 --> 00:56:25.592
REACTING IN THE MOMENT SINCE THE
ULTIMATE VERDICT ON IT IS GOING 

00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:31.297
TO BE VOTERS. MORE CLOSELY 
TOWARD THE END OF THE END OF 

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.100
DECIDING HOW THEY THINK OTHER 
TRIAL IS PLAYED OUT ANOTHER 

00:56:34.144 --> 00:56:39.424
SATISFIED WITH THE VERDICT. 
&gt;&gt; KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, THANK YOU 

00:56:39.639 --> 00:56:41.662
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. NATALIE 
JENNINGS STILL WITH US. SENIOR 

00:56:41.877 --> 00:56:44.404
EDITOR FOR THE FIX. AND ALSO  
COLBY - CONGRESSIONAL REPORTING 

00:56:44.555 --> 00:56:49.392
REPORTER. CALL THE 2020 RACE. 
THIS IS NATALIE. YOU HAVE THIS 

00:56:50.161 --> 00:56:53.064
GREAT STORY COLBY ABOUT - 
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS AND HOW 

00:56:53.265 --> 00:56:55.265
MUCH PRESSURE SHE IS FIELDING

00:57:05.267 --> 00:57:07.503
TO GET ON TEAM YOU KNOW, 
WHATEVER YOUR SIDE IS. TELL US 

00:57:07.704 --> 00:57:09.940
ABOUT HOW SENATORS ARE TRYING TO
REACH OUT TO HER AND WHAT 

00:57:10.141 --> 00:57:11.973
POSITION SHE AND OTHERS LIKE HER
ARE PUT IN. 

00:57:11.974 --> 00:57:13.974
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SO, SUSAN COLLINS 
IS A REALLY DIFFICULT REELECTION

00:57:14.011 --> 00:57:16.249
RACE COMING UP. THERE IS A TON 
OF ACTIVISTS THAT WERE MOBILIZED

00:57:16.449 --> 00:57:18.484
AFTER HER VOTE FOR BRETT 
KAVANAGH. A LOT OF ANGER FROM 

00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:20.105
THE LEFT DIRECTED AT SUSAN 
COLLINS - 

00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:21.540
&gt;&gt; SHE BETTER TO CONFIRM BRETT 
KAVANAGH. 

00:57:21.541 --> 00:57:24.746
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A SENATOR THEY CAN 
OFTEN COUNT ON TO VOTE FOR THEM 

00:57:24.927 --> 00:57:27.837
FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THEY 
SAW HER AS AN ALLY ON THE SOCIAL

00:57:28.039 --> 00:57:30.841
ISSUES. AND THAT SHE VOTED FOR 
KAVANAGH. AND IT ALL KIND OF 

00:57:30.987 --> 00:57:33.744
COMBUSTED FOR HER. IT WON HER 
THE FAVORITE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

00:57:33.945 --> 00:57:35.945
THE LEADERSHIP IN HER OWN CAUCUS

00:57:42.287 --> 00:57:44.287
. THE DEMOCRATS WERE VERY ANGRY.
NOW COMES THIS IMPEACHMENT 

00:57:44.322 --> 00:57:47.163
TRIAL. AND THEY LOOK BACK AT HER
AND SAID, WHAT YOU GONNA DO? 

00:57:47.365 --> 00:57:49.816
RECITER YOU ON? SO FAR, SHE HAS 
TOWED THE PARTY LINE AND SAID 

00:57:50.016 --> 00:57:53.272
YOU KNOW, I AM NOT GOING TO VOTE
WITH DEMOCRATS TO CALL WITNESSES

00:57:53.473 --> 00:57:55.473
BEFORE EVER THE ARGUMENT. I WILL
LIKELY SUPPORT WITNESSES AFTER 

00:57:55.509 --> 00:58:00.588
WE HAVE FOR THE ARGUMENT. BUT 
EVEN THEN I CANNOT SAY WHICH 

00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:03.221
WITNESSES I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE 
OF HEARING FROM. IT MIGHT BE

00:58:06.896 --> 00:58:09.133
, IT COULD BE HUNTER BIDEN, IT 
COULD BE HUNTER BIDEN IN 

00:58:09.334 --> 00:58:11.334
ADDITION TO PEOPLE LIKE JOHN 
BOLTON AND MICK MULVANEY. SO, 

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:13.607
THAT IS THE TENSION THAT SHE IS 
FEELING. AND, CURRENTLY, I AM 

00:58:13.808 --> 00:58:15.844
TOLD THAT OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL 
THERE IS A MASSIVE TRUCK, A 

00:58:16.045 --> 00:58:18.487
BILLBOARD TRUCK WITH A VIDEO OF 
HER GIVING SPEECHES IN 1999

00:58:23.577 --> 00:58:25.577
DURING THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT, 
VERSUS THING SHE SAID NOW. FAIR 

00:58:25.613 --> 00:58:27.647
APPARENTLY IN 1999, SHE WAS MUCH
MORE SUPPORTIVE OF EVIDENCE AND 

00:58:27.849 --> 00:58:31.506
WITNESSES UPFRONT. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING 

00:58:31.706 --> 00:58:33.740
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE IS IN 
SWITZERLAND TODAY FOR THE WORLD 

00:58:33.942 --> 00:58:38.632
ECONOMIC FORUM. LET'S LISTEN TO 
RESIDENT TRUMP TALK ABOUT WHAT 

00:58:38.834 --> 00:58:40.653
IS HAPPENING BACK IN WASHINGTON 
AND SPECIFICALLY THE IMPEACHMENT

00:58:40.654 --> 00:58:45.343
TRIAL. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WHOLE THING IS A HOAX. 

00:58:46.147 --> 00:58:48.180
IT GOES NOWHERE BECAUSE NOTHING 
HAPPENED. THE ONLY THING WE HAVE

00:58:48.395 --> 00:58:51.172
DONE IS A GREAT JOB. WE EVEREST 
THE STRONGEST COUNTRY IN THE 

00:58:51.358 --> 00:58:55.507
WORLD BY FAR. IT WAS GOING IN 
THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE HAVE THE

00:58:55.708 --> 00:58:58.158
GREATEST ECONOMY WE HAVE EVER 
HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

00:58:58.358 --> 00:59:00.595
COUNTRY. AND I AM IN EUROPE 
TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE BRINGING A 

00:59:00.796 --> 00:59:02.831
LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES INTO OUR 
COUNTRY WITH THOUSANDS OF JOBS, 

00:59:03.032 --> 00:59:05.032
MILLIONS OF JOBS IN 
COMMUNICATIONS. SO,

00:59:08.523 --> 00:59:10.976
THAT WHOLE THING IS A TOTAL 
HOAX. SO, I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO

00:59:11.176 --> 00:59:13.550
WORK OUT FINE. 
&gt;&gt; NOW JOINING US FROM DABO - 

00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:18.172
SWITZERLAND, OUR COLLEAGUE WHO 
IS TRAVELING IN AS THE 

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.975
PRESIDENT'S ENTOURAGE. HE IS 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THIS 

00:59:21.128 --> 00:59:29.686
DABO'S EVENT. TO LOU, HOW IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOCUS ON THE 

00:59:29.887 --> 00:59:35.381
ISSUES HAPPENING IN TOPLESS 
VERSUS WHAT'S HAPPENING BACK IN 

00:59:35.582 --> 00:59:37.404
WASHINGTON ARE NOW. 
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED

00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:40.077
TO FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY. YES TRY
TO TOUT HIS ECONOMIC RECORD.

00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:49.410
EARLIER TODAY HE WAS ONE OF THE 
KEYNOTE SPEAKERS AND HE DID NOT 

00:59:49.622 --> 00:59:51.622
TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT DURING 
HIS SPEECH. HE TALKED ABOUT THE 

00:59:51.646 --> 00:59:54.096
ECONOMY AND HOW HE BELIEVES HE 
HAS DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB FOR 

00:59:54.297 --> 00:59:56.533
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN THE U.S. 
ECONOMY BACK FROM THE BRINK OF 

00:59:56.734 --> 00:59:58.355
YOU KNOW, RECEPTION RECESSION 
AND DOWNTURNS. BUT WHENEVER 

00:59:58.356 --> 01:00:00.356
FACED WITH WESTERNS FROM 
REPORTERS,

01:00:03.853 --> 01:00:05.887
IT INEVITABLY TURNS BACK TO 
IMPEACHMENT I HAVE SPENT A LOT 

01:00:06.088 --> 01:00:07.922
OF TIME ANSWERING QUESTIONS, 
ENGAGING WITH REPORTERS AND NOT 

01:00:07.923 --> 01:00:09.923
PIVOTING RIGHT BACK TO THE 
ECONOMY

01:00:14.432 --> 01:00:16.432
AND THE MESSAGE, BUT REALLY 
ENGAGING WITH THE IDEA OF 

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:18.303
IMPEACHMENT, CALLING IT HOAX. 
SHOWING THAT HE IS FOLLOWING 

01:00:18.304 --> 01:00:20.304
WHAT IS HAPPENING BACK IN 
WASHINGTON. THAT HE IS ENGAGED, 

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:24.812
EVEN HIS SPOKESPERSON SAID THAT 
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE FULL DAY

01:00:25.014 --> 01:00:27.451
HERE IN THE OFFICE, HE WILL BE 
BRIEFED THROUGHOUT THE DAY BY 

01:00:27.593 --> 01:00:31.310
HIS ADVISORS ABOUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON WHEN IT 

01:00:31.522 --> 01:00:33.546
COMES TO THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. 
SO, THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO 

01:00:33.761 --> 01:00:36.197
JUGGLE HIS RESPONSIBILITIES ARE 
AND OFFICE, BUT IT IS TRUE THAT 

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.399
IMPEACHMENT IS ON HIS MIND. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SO,

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:44.338
TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHAT IS HIS 
MOOD, HIS TONE OF HOW HE IS 

01:00:44.539 --> 01:00:46.979
TALKING ABOUT THIS. WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING A SENSE OF HOW HE IS 

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.619
FEELING?  
&gt;&gt; HE SEEMS FRUSTRATED, HE'S 

01:00:49.819 --> 01:00:51.652
BEEN FRUSTRATED THROUGHOUT THE 
PROCESS. BUT WHENEVER HE TRIES 

01:00:51.653 --> 01:00:55.524
TO DO SOMETHING AS PRESIDENT, IT
ALWAYS COMES BACK TO SCANDAL AND

01:00:55.724 --> 01:01:01.015
THIS IDEA OF WHAT HE CALLS A 
HOAX. IN THIS IDEA THAT HE IS 

01:01:01.217 --> 01:01:03.254
BEING IMPEACHED. SO, HE IS 
FRUSTRATED HE IS NOT ABLE TO 

01:01:03.454 --> 01:01:08.744
FOCUS ON WHAT HE BELIEVES IS A 
STRONG ECONOMIC MESSAGE AND THAT

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:10.944
IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW, THE 
STRENGTH OF THE U.S. ECONOMY. 

01:01:10.979 --> 01:01:14.849
HE'S GOING TO BE MEETING WITH 
DIFFERENT CEOS. BUT, THE FACT 

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.883
THAT HE GETS QUESTIONS FROM 
REPORTERS ABOUT - ABOUT 

01:01:16.884 --> 01:01:19.109
IMPEACHMENT, ABOUT WHETHER OR 
NOT HE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM 

01:01:19.323 --> 01:01:21.559
OFFICE, IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR 
HIM AND YOU HEAR THAT AS HE 

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.011
ANSWERS THESE QUESTIONS. HE 
CALLS IT A HOAX IN WHICH ON. 

01:01:25.827 --> 01:01:27.827
EVEN THOUGH HE'S MEETING WITH 
THESE DIGNIFIED LEADERS, HE GOES

01:01:27.862 --> 01:01:32.278
DIRECTLY INTO SORT OF HIS NORMAL
AMERICAN POLITICAL DOMESTIC 

01:01:32.419 --> 01:01:38.837
LANDSCAPE LANGUAGE. AND EVEN 
THOUGH WERE FAR AWAY ON FOREIGN 

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.022
SOIL, THE PRESIDENT IS 
COMPLETELY ENGAGING IN HIS 

01:01:41.023 --> 01:01:43.023
TYPICAL REELECTION CAMPAIGN 
STYLE

01:01:46.762 --> 01:01:48.762
ANTICS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ISSUE OF 

01:01:48.894 --> 01:01:50.894
IMPEACHMENT COMES UP.

01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:57.727
&gt;&gt; TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA TRAVELING 
WITH THE PRESIDENT IN 

01:01:57.728 --> 01:01:59.765
SWITZERLAND. THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR TALKING TO US. NATALIE AND 

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.614
COLBY, BEFORE WE LET YOU GUYS 
GET BACK TO YOUR DESKS,  THIS IS

01:02:02.815 --> 01:02:08.704
A MOMENT PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD 
LOVE IS TO BE FOCUSED ON 

01:02:08.921 --> 01:02:10.921
EVERYTHING ELSE HE'S BEEN 
WORKING ON THIS PAST WEEK. CHINA

01:02:10.938 --> 01:02:12.938
TRADE. THE NEW NORTH AMERICAN 
TRADE AGREEMENT. EVEN ON FRIDAY 

01:02:12.973 --> 01:02:15.216
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT PRAYER IN 
SCHOOLS. BUT, HE HAS ALSO GOT 

01:02:15.975 --> 01:02:17.975
THIS TEAM OF DEFENDERS

01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:26.563
. BOTH INSIDE THE SENATE 
CHAMBER. THE ATTORNEYS WHO WILL 

01:02:26.598 --> 01:02:28.832
BE REPRESENTING HIM AND ALSO ARE
GOING OUT TO FOX NEWS AND 

01:02:29.033 --> 01:02:31.268
EVERYPLACE ELSE TO TRY TO DEFEND
HIM VOCALLY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

01:02:31.469 --> 01:02:33.704
OF DAYS. SO, THERE ARE TWO 
AGENDAS HERE BY THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:02:33.904 --> 01:02:36.352
&gt;&gt; YES. ALL OF THEM ARE SERVED 
BETTER BY THIS TRIAL BEING AS 

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:39.465
SHORT AS HIS LAWYERS AND MITCH 
McCONNELL WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. 

01:02:39.602 --> 01:02:44.676
SO, THE SOONER THAT HAPPENS, THE
SOONER HE CAN GO OUT ON THE 

01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:47.764
CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH MORE OF A 
FOCUS ON WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK 

01:02:47.906 --> 01:02:52.412
ABOUT. THAT'S NOT TO SAY HE 
WON'T KEEP BRINGING THIS UP IF 

01:02:52.612 --> 01:02:54.647
HE FEELS LIKE IT'S ADVANTAGEOUS 
POLITICALLY FOR HIM TO SAY THAT 

01:02:54.847 --> 01:03:00.538
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING A POOR 
PROSECUTION HERE. BUT ALL OF 

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:03.181
THAT GOES BACK TO HIM BEING ABLE
TO DRIVE THE AGENDA IN THIS 

01:03:03.376 --> 01:03:08.662
ELECTION YEAR, WHICH WE ARE 
OFFICIALLY IN. 

01:03:08.663 --> 01:03:11.099
&gt;&gt; COLBY, WE DID GET A SENSE OF 
HOW DEMOCRATS PLAN TO MOUNT 

01:03:11.313 --> 01:03:13.334
THEIR PART OF THE TRIAL OVER THE
WEEKEND. YOU WERE COMBING 

01:03:13.548 --> 01:03:15.548
THROUGH LIKE THIS VOLUMINOUS 
RELEASE. LEADER McCONNELL IS ON 

01:03:15.568 --> 01:03:16.799
THE SENATE FLOOR FOR OPENING 
REMARKS. 

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.036
&gt;&gt;&gt; OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. WE
BEGAN JUST THE THIRD 

01:03:19.237 --> 01:03:23.187
PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS IS A 

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:26.142
UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH THE 
FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION KNEW

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:33.250
THAT THE SENATE AND ONLY THE 
SENATE COULD HANDLE. OUR 

01:03:33.466 --> 01:03:35.591
FOUNDERS TRUSTED THE SENATE TO 
RISE ABOVE SHORT-TERM PASSIONS 

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:40.373
AND FACTIONALISM. THEY TRUSTED 
THE SENATE TO SOBERLY CONSIDER 

01:03:40.573 --> 01:03:43.824
WHAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PROVEN 
AND WHICH OUTCOME BEST SERVES 

01:03:44.025 --> 01:03:48.912
THE NATION. THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH
BAR, MR. PRESIDENT. AND YOU 

01:03:49.113 --> 01:03:54.214
MIGHT SAY THAT LATER TODAY, THIS
BODY WILL TAKE OUR ENTRANCE 

01:03:54.354 --> 01:03:58.134
EXAM. TODAY, WE WILL CONSIDER 
AND PASS AN ORGANIZING 

01:03:58.279 --> 01:04:04.061
RESOLUTION THAT WILL STRUCTURE 
THE FIRST PHASE OF THE TRIAL. 

01:04:04.697 --> 01:04:10.905
THIS INITIAL STEP WILL OFFER AN 
EARLY SIGNAL TO OUR COUNTRY.

01:04:15.122 --> 01:04:17.122
CAN THE SENATE STILL SERVE OUR 
FOUNDING PURPOSE?

01:04:21.017 --> 01:04:23.017
CAN WE STILL PUT FAIRNESS, 
EVENHANDEDNESS, AND HISTORICAL 

01:04:23.037 --> 01:04:29.557
PRECEDENT AHEAD OF THE PARTISAN 
PASSIONS OF THE DAY? TODAY'S 

01:04:30.373 --> 01:04:32.373
VOTE WILL CONTAIN SOME ANSWERS.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.100
THE ORGANIZING RESOLUTION WILL 
PUT FORWARD ALREADY HAS THE 

01:04:39.101 --> 01:04:41.753
SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY OF THE 
SENATE. THAT'S BECAUSE IT SETS 

01:04:41.953 --> 01:04:46.641
UP A STRUCTURE THAT IS FAIR, 
EVENHANDED, AND TRACKS CLOSELY 

01:04:46.836 --> 01:04:51.066
WITH PAST PRESIDENTS THAT WERE 
ESTABLISHED UNANIMOUSLY.

01:04:56.178 --> 01:04:58.178
AFTER PRETRIAL BUSINESS, THE 
RESOLUTION ESTABLISHES THE FOUR 

01:04:58.188 --> 01:05:03.600
THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN NEXT.
FIRST, THE SENATE WILL HEAR AN 

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:08.273
OPENING PRESENTATION FROM THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS. SECOND, WE WILL 

01:05:08.411 --> 01:05:10.790
HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 
COUNSEL.

01:05:16.502 --> 01:05:18.502
THIRD, SENATORS WILL BE ABLE TO 
SEEK FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT 

01:05:18.536 --> 01:05:21.812
POSING WRITTEN QUESTIONS TO 
EITHER SIDE THROUGH THE CHIEF 

01:05:21.955 --> 01:05:24.107
JUSTICE. AND FORTH,

01:05:30.932 --> 01:05:32.932
WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION IN 
HAND, THE SENATE WILL CONSIDER 

01:05:32.966 --> 01:05:35.000
IF WE FEEL WHETHER ANY 
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OR WITNESSES

01:05:35.202 --> 01:05:37.797
ARE NECESSARY TO EVALUATE 
WHETHER THE HOUSE CASE HAS 

01:05:37.943 --> 01:05:44.145
CLEARED OR FAILED TO CLEAR THE 
HIGH BAR OF OVERCOMING THE 

01:05:44.345 --> 01:05:47.427
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND 
UNDOING A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION.

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:54.814
THE SENATE'S FAIR PROCESS WILL 
DRAW SHORT CONTRAST WITH UNFAIR 

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:59.468
AND PRESIDENT BREAKING INQUIRY 
THAT WAS CARRIED ON BY THE HOUSE

01:05:59.616 --> 01:06:04.056
OF REPRESENTATIVES. THE HOUSE 
BROKE WITH PRECEDENT BY DENYING 

01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:06.706
MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN 
MINORITY THE SAME RIGHTS THAT 

01:06:06.908 --> 01:06:09.244
DEMOCRATS HAVE RECEIVED WHEN 
THEY WERE IN THE MINORITY BACK 

01:06:09.392 --> 01:06:11.392
IN 1998.

01:06:15.445 --> 01:06:17.481
HERE IN THE SENATE, EVERY SINGLE
SENATOR WILL HAVE EXACTLY THE 

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:20.475
SAME RIGHTS AND EXACTLY THE SAME
ABILITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. THE 

01:06:20.633 --> 01:06:25.000
HOUSE BROKE WITH FAIRNESS BY 
CAUSING CUTTING PRESIDENT 

01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:27.505
TRUMP'S COUNSEL OUT OF THE 
INQUIRY TO AN UNPRECEDENTED 

01:06:27.649 --> 01:06:33.524
DEGREE. HERE IN THE SENATE, THE 
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS WILL FINALLY

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.594
RECEIVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
WITH THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS. AND 

01:06:37.796 --> 01:06:41.663
WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO RESENT 
THE PRESIDENT'S CASE. FINALLY, 

01:06:42.627 --> 01:06:44.627
SOME FAIRNESS.

01:06:48.766 --> 01:06:50.182
ON EVERY POINT, OUR 
STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTION WILL 

01:06:50.183 --> 01:06:52.183
BRING THE CLARITY AND FAIRNESS

01:06:55.671 --> 01:06:57.501
THAT EVERYONE DESERVES. THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

01:06:57.502 --> 01:07:02.133
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS

01:07:02.294 --> 01:07:05.249
THE FAIR ROADMAP FOR OUR TRIAL.

01:07:10.509 --> 01:07:13.174
WE NEEDED IN PLACE BEFORE WE CAN
MOVE FORWARD. SO, THE SENATE 

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:16.291
SHOULD REPAIR TO REMAIN IN 
SESSION TODAY UNTIL WE COMPLETE 

01:07:16.437 --> 01:07:18.437
THIS RESOLUTION. AND ADOPTED.

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:24.121
'S BASIC FOUR-PART STRUCTURE 
ALIGNS WITH THE FIRST STEPS OF 

01:07:24.321 --> 01:07:26.321
THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN
1999.

01:07:31.428 --> 01:07:33.260
21 YEARS AGO, 100 SENATORS 
AGREED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THIS 

01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:36.003
ROADMAP WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO 
BEGIN THE TRIAL. ALL 100 

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:40.877
SENATORS AGREED THE PROPER TIME 
TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF 

01:07:41.032 --> 01:07:47.425
POTENTIAL WITNESSES WAS AFTER, 
AFTER OPENING ARGUMENTS AND 

01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:52.358
SENATORS QUESTIONS. NOW, SOME 
OUTSIDE VOICES HAVE BEEN URGING 

01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:55.428
THE SENATE TO BREAK WITH 
PRECEDENT ON THIS QUESTION. LOUD

01:07:55.570 --> 01:08:01.509
VOICES. INCLUDING THE LEADERSHIP
OF THE HOUSE MAJORITY. COLLUDED 

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.424
WITH SENATE DEMOCRATS AND TRIED 
TO FORCE THE DEMO THE SENATE TO 

01:08:04.566 --> 01:08:09.230
PRE-COMMIT OURSELVES TO SEEK 
SPECIFIC WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS

01:08:09.432 --> 01:08:12.971
BEFORE SENATORS HAD EVEN HEARD 
OPENING ARGUMENTS OR EVEN ASKED 

01:08:13.115 --> 01:08:15.115
QUESTIONS.

01:08:18.776 --> 01:08:20.776
THESE ARE POTENTIAL WITNESSES, 
MR. PRESIDENT, WHOM THE HOUSE 

01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:24.967
MANAGERS THEMSELVES, THEMSELVES 
DECLINED TO HEAR FROM, WHOM THE 

01:08:25.108 --> 01:08:30.087
HOUSE ITSELF DECLINED TO PURSUE 
THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM DURING 

01:08:30.228 --> 01:08:37.472
ITS OWN INQUIRY. THE HOUSE IS 
NOT FACING ANY DEADLINE. THEY 

01:08:37.673 --> 01:08:39.772
WERE FREE TO RUN WHATEVER 
INVESTIGATION THEY WANTED TO 

01:08:39.913 --> 01:08:45.949
RUN. IF THEY WANTED WITNESSES, 
WHO WOULD TRIGGER LEGAL BATTLES 

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.075
OVER PRESIDENTIAL PRIVILEGE, 
THEY COULD'VE HAD THOSE FIGHTS. 

01:08:51.892 --> 01:08:53.892
BUT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THE 

01:08:53.924 --> 01:08:57.835
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE DECIDED NOT TO. THEY 

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.218
DECIDED THEIR INQUIRY WAS 
FINISHED, AND MOVED RIGHT AHEAD.

01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:07.506
THE HOUSE CHOSE NOT TO PURSUE 
THE SAME WITNESSES THEY 

01:09:07.539 --> 01:09:09.812
APPARENTLY WOULD NOW LIKE, WOULD
NOW LIKE THE SENATE TO 

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.146
PRE-COMMIT TO PURSUING 
OURSELVES. AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING

01:09:15.287 --> 01:09:19.009
FOR WEEKS, NOBODY, NOBODY, WE'LL
DIG TAKE SENATE

01:09:25.414 --> 01:09:27.414
PROCEDURE TO UNITED STATES 
SENATORS. A MAJORITY OF US ARE 

01:09:27.449 --> 01:09:29.683
COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE 
UNANIMOUS, BIPARTISAN CLINTON 

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500
PRECEDENT AGAINST OUTSIDE 
INFLUENCES WITH RESPECT TO THE 

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:40.241
PROPER TIMING OF THESE MID-TRIAL
QUESTIONS. AND SO, IF ANY 

01:09:40.455 --> 01:09:42.987
AMENDMENTS ARE BROUGHT FORWARD 
TO FORCE PREMATURE DECISIONS ON 

01:09:43.126 --> 01:09:48.576
MID-TRIAL QUESTIONS, I WILL MOVE
TO TABLE SUCH AMENDMENTS AND 

01:09:49.343 --> 01:09:51.343
PROTECT OUR BIPARTISAN 
PRECEDENT.

01:09:55.282 --> 01:09:57.282
IF THE SENATOR MOVES TO AMEND 
THE RESOLUTION AND ORDER 

01:09:57.316 --> 01:10:01.585
SUBPOENA SPECIFIC WITNESSES OR 
DOCUMENTS, I WILL MOVE TO TABLE 

01:10:01.787 --> 01:10:03.605
SUCH MOTIONS BECAUSE THE SENATE 
WILL DECIDE THOSE QUESTIONS 

01:10:03.606 --> 01:10:06.493
LATER IN THE TRIAL, JUST LIKE WE
DID BACK IN 1999.

01:10:10.726 --> 01:10:12.745
NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, TODAY MAY 
PRESENT A CURIOUS SITUATION.

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:18.872
WE MAY HEAR HOUSE MANAGERS 
THEMSELVES AGITATE FOR SUCH 

01:10:19.028 --> 01:10:21.028
AMENDMENTS.

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.568
WE MAY HEAR A TEAM OF MANAGERS 
LED BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 

01:10:26.769 --> 01:10:29.322
AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
ARGUE THAT THE SENATE MUST 

01:10:29.464 --> 01:10:34.903
PRE-COMMIT OURSELVES TO REOPEN 
THE VERY INVESTIGATION THEY 

01:10:35.104 --> 01:10:37.104
THEMSELVES OVERSAW AND 
VOLUNTARILY SHUT DOWN.

01:10:41.807 --> 01:10:43.841
IT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO HEAR 
THESE TWO HOUSE CHAIRMAN ARGUE 

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.246
THAT THE SENATE MUST PRE-COMMIT 
OURSELVES TO SUPPLEMENTING THEIR

01:10:48.394 --> 01:10:52.864
OWN EVIDENTIARY RECORD TO 
ENFORCING SUBPOENAS THEY REFUSED

01:10:53.009 --> 01:10:55.009
TO ENFORCE

01:10:58.669 --> 01:11:00.838
. TO SUPPLEMENT A CASE THEY 
THEMSELVES HAVE RECENTLY 

01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:05.725
DESCRIBED AS OVERWHELMING. 
OVERWHELMING. AND BEYOND ANY 

01:11:05.865 --> 01:11:07.865
REASONABLE DOUBT.

01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:20.817
MR. PRESIDENT, THESE MID-TRIAL 
QUESTIONS COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:22.652
US EVEN DEEPER INTO EVEN MORE 
COMPLEX CONSTITUTIONAL WATERS. 

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.270
FOR EXAMPLE, MANY SENATORS, 
INCLUDING ME, HAVE SERIOUS 

01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:25.689
CONCERNS ABOUT BLURRING, 
BLURRING THE TRADITIONAL ROLE 

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:28.065
BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE
WITHIN THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. 

01:11:28.487 --> 01:11:30.487
THE CONSTITUTION DIVIDES

01:11:32.808 --> 01:11:35.041
THE POWER TO IMPEACH FROM THE 
POWER TO TRY. THE FIRST BELONGS 

01:11:35.803 --> 01:11:38.955
SOLELY TO THE HOUSE. AND WITH 
THE POWER TO IMPEACH COMES A 

01:11:39.109 --> 01:11:41.109
RESPONSIBILITY TO INVESTIGATE.

01:11:45.197 --> 01:11:47.633
THE SENATE AGREEING TO PICK UP 
AND CARRY ON THE HOUSE IS AN 

01:11:47.834 --> 01:11:49.902
ADEQUATE INVESTIGATION WOULD SET
A NEW PRECEDENT THAT COULD 

01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:52.468
INCENTIVIZE FREQUENT AND HAZY 
IMPEACHMENTS

01:11:59.826 --> 01:12:01.443
FROM FUTURE HOUSE MAJORITIES. 
COULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE 

01:12:01.444 --> 01:12:03.478
SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE
HOUSE AND THE SENATE AT THE 

01:12:03.828 --> 01:12:05.828
SENATE AGREES WE WILL CONDUCT 
BOTH THE INVESTIGATION AND THE 

01:12:06.273 --> 01:12:08.452
TRIAL. OF AN IMPEACHMENT. WHAT'S
MORE,

01:12:12.614 --> 01:12:14.614
SOME OF THE PROPOSED NEW 
WITNESSES INCLUDE EXECUTIVE 

01:12:14.674 --> 01:12:18.111
BRANCH OFFICIALS WHOSE 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 

01:12:18.313 --> 01:12:21.148
PRESIDENT AND WITH OTHER 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS LIE 

01:12:21.362 --> 01:12:24.133
AT THE VERY CORE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL 

01:12:24.281 --> 01:12:26.281
PRIVILEGE.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.132
PURSUING THOSE WITNESSES COULD 
INDEFINITELY DELAY THE SENATE 

01:12:33.133 --> 01:12:35.611
TRIAL AND DRAW OUR BODY INTO A 
PROTRACTED AND COMPLEX LEGAL 

01:12:35.764 --> 01:12:41.954
FIGHT OVER PRESENT PRESIDENTIAL 
PRIVILEGE. SUCH LITIGATION COULD

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.682
POTENTIALLY HAVE PERMANENT 
WREAKED REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE 

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.828
SEPARATION OF POWERS

01:12:50.197 --> 01:12:52.197
AND THE INSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENCY
THAT SENATORS WOULD NEED TO 

01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:54.594
CONSIDER VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.

01:12:57.517 --> 01:12:59.749
SO, MR. PRESIDENT, THE SENATE IS
NOT ABOUT TO RUSH INTO THESE 

01:13:00.513 --> 01:13:02.513
WEIGHTY QUESTIONS WITHOUT 
DISCUSSION

01:13:04.219 --> 01:13:06.219
, AND WITHOUT DELIBERATION. 
WITHOUT EVEN HEARING OPENING 

01:13:06.351 --> 01:13:08.351
ARGUMENTS FOR US.

01:13:14.374 --> 01:13:16.609
THERE WERE GOOD REASONS WHY 100 
OUT OF 100 SENATORS AGREED TO 

01:13:16.812 --> 01:13:18.846
DECADES AGO TO CROSS THESE 
BRIDGES WHEN WE CAME TO THEM. 

01:13:19.047 --> 01:13:24.528
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO THIS 
TIME AS WELL. FAIR IS FAIR. THE 

01:13:24.743 --> 01:13:27.176
PROCESS WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR 
PRESIDENT CLINTON. AND BASIC 

01:13:27.996 --> 01:13:31.931
FAIRNESS DICTATES IT OUGHT TO BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS PRESIDENT 

01:13:32.085 --> 01:13:40.995
AS WELL. SO, ON THE EYES ARE ON 
THE SENATE. THE COUNTRY IS 

01:13:41.196 --> 01:13:43.410
WATCHING TO SEE IF WE CAN RISE 
TO THE OCCASION.

01:13:49.114 --> 01:13:51.349
21 YEARS AGO, 100 SENATORS, 
INCLUDING A NUMBER OF US WHO SIT

01:13:51.549 --> 01:13:54.293
IN THE CHAMBER TODAY, DID JUST 
THAT. THE BODY OF, THE BODY 

01:13:54.435 --> 01:13:56.435
PROVED TO

01:13:58.464 --> 01:14:00.843
FAIR, COMMON SENSE PROCESS TO 
GUIDE THE BEGINNING OF A 

01:14:00.987 --> 01:14:02.987
PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT TRIAL.

01:14:08.218 --> 01:14:10.480
TODAY, TWO DECADES LATER, THE 
SENATE WILL RETAKE THAT ENTRANCE

01:14:10.633 --> 01:14:15.684
EXAM. THE BASIC STRUCTURE WE ARE
PROPOSING IS JUST AS EMINENTLY 

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.830
FAIR AND EVENHANDED

01:14:20.193 --> 01:14:22.193
AS IT WAS BACK THEN. THE 
QUESTION IS WHETHER SENATORS 

01:14:22.226 --> 01:14:24.440
ARE, THEMSELVES, READY TO BE AS 
FAIR AND AS EVENHANDED.

01:14:35.234 --> 01:14:37.989
&gt;&gt; THE SENATE MADE A STATEMENT 
21 YEARS AGO. WE SAID THE 

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:41.971
PRESENCE OF EITHER PARTY 
DESERVED BASIC JUSTICE AND FAIR 

01:14:42.113 --> 01:14:48.224
PROCESS. CHALLENGING POLITICAL 
MOMENT LIKE TODAY DOES NOT MAKE 

01:14:48.977 --> 01:14:52.871
SUCH STATEMENTS LESS NECESSARY. 
ALL THE MORE NECESSARY, IN FACT.

01:14:55.342 --> 01:14:59.195
SO, OUTSIDE OF MY COLLEAGUES 
ACROSS THE AISLE, THERE IS NO 

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:01.879
REASON WHY THE VOTE ON THIS 
RESOLUTION NOT TO BE REMOTELY 

01:15:02.027 --> 01:15:05.897
PARTISAN. THERE IS NO REASON, 
OTHER THAN BASE PARTISANSHIP TO 

01:15:06.651 --> 01:15:09.964
SAY THIS PARTICULAR PRESIDENT 
DESERVES A RADICALLY DIFFERENT 

01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:13.580
RULEBOOK THAN WHAT WAS GOOD 
ENOUGH FOR A PAST PRESIDENT OF 

01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:20.612
YOUR OWN PARTY. SO, I WOULD URGE
EVERY SINGLE SENATOR SUPPORT A 

01:15:20.781 --> 01:15:24.344
FAIR RESOLUTION. I URGE EVERYONE
TO VOTE TO UPHOLD THE SENATE'S 

01:15:24.485 --> 01:15:28.633
UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN PRECEDENT 
OF A FAIR PROCESS.

01:15:46.527 --> 01:15:48.527
&gt;&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATIC LEADER. 
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I BEGIN,

01:15:53.445 --> 01:15:55.067
THERE HAS BEEN WELL-FOUNDED 
CONCERN THAT THE ADDITIONAL 

01:15:55.068 --> 01:15:58.517
SECURITY MEASURES REQUIRED FOR 
ACCESS TO THE GALLERIES DURING 

01:15:58.717 --> 01:16:01.519
THE TRIAL COULD CAUSE REPORTERS 
TO MISS SOME OF THE EVENTS ON 

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.018
THE SENATE FLOOR. I WANT TO 
ASSURE EVERYONE IN THE PRESS 

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:08.885
THAT I WILL VOCIFEROUSLY OPPOSE 
ANY ATTEMPT TO BEGIN THE TRIAL 

01:16:09.688 --> 01:16:12.739
UNLESS THE REPORTERS TRYING TO 
ENTER THE GALLERY ARE SEATED. 

01:16:13.554 --> 01:16:19.238
THE PRESS IS HERE TO INFORM THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT THESE 

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:22.034
PIVOTAL EVENTS IN OUR NATIONS 
HISTORY. WE MUST MAKE SURE THEY 

01:16:22.179 --> 01:16:26.255
ARE ABLE TO. SOME MAY NOT WANT 
WHAT HAPPENS HERE TO BE PUBLIC. 

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.243
WE DO. NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, AFTER
THE CONCLUSION OF MY REMARKS, 

01:16:33.046 --> 01:16:35.369
THE SENATE WILL PROCEED TO THE 
IMPEACHMENT CHILD OF PRESIDENT 

01:16:35.509 --> 01:16:39.665
DONALD JOHN TRUMP FOR COMMITTING
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. 

01:16:39.809 --> 01:16:41.809
PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.047
IS ACCUSED OF COERCING A FOREIGN
LEADER INTO INTERFERING IN OUR 

01:16:46.798 --> 01:16:50.528
ELECTIONS. TO BENEFIT HIMSELF, 
AND THEN DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS

01:16:51.294 --> 01:16:56.214
POWER TO COVERED UP. IF PROVED, 
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS ARE 

01:16:56.972 --> 01:16:58.972
CRIMES AGAINST DEMOCRACY ITSELF.

01:17:04.331 --> 01:17:06.565
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A GREATER 
SUBVERSION OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAN

01:17:06.778 --> 01:17:09.049
FOR POWERS OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS 
TO DETERMINE THE ELECTIONS FROM 

01:17:09.223 --> 01:17:14.440
WITHIN. FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO
ATTEMPT SUCH A THING ON ITS OWN 

01:17:14.592 --> 01:17:17.745
IS BAD ENOUGH. AN AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT TO DELIBERATELY 

01:17:18.506 --> 01:17:23.326
SOLICIT SUCH A THING, TO 
BLACKMAIL A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITH

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:27.737
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO HELP HIM 
WIN AN ELECTION IS UNIMAGINABLY 

01:17:27.902 --> 01:17:31.709
WORSE. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OTHER
PRESIDENT DOING THIS. BEYOND 

01:17:31.858 --> 01:17:33.858
THAT

01:17:35.213 --> 01:17:37.960
, OTHER THAN THE PRESIDENT TO 
DENY THE RIGHT OF CONGRESS TO 

01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:40.111
CONDUCT OVERSIGHT

01:17:41.312 --> 01:17:43.383
, DENIED THE RIGHT TO 
INVESTIGATE ANY OF HIS 

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:47.756
ACTIVITIES. TO SAY ARTICLE 2 OF 
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES HIM THE 

01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:54.204
RIGHT TO "DO WHATEVER HE WANTS."
WE ARE STARING DOWN AN EROSION 

01:17:54.917 --> 01:17:59.183
OF THE SACRED DEMOCRATIC 
PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH OUR 

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:02.072
FOUNDERS FOUGHT A BLOODIED WAR 
OF INDEPENDENCE. SUCH IS THE 

01:18:02.221 --> 01:18:08.826
GRAVITY OF THIS HISTORIC MOMENT.
NOW, ONE SENATOR THIS MORNING AT

01:18:08.965 --> 01:18:10.965
1 PM

01:18:12.586 --> 01:18:14.586
, THE CEREMONIAL FUNCTIONS AT 
THE BEGINNING OF A PRESIDENTIAL 

01:18:15.185 --> 01:18:18.689
TRIAL WILL BE COMPLETE. THE 
SENATE THEN MUST DETERMINE THE 

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:23.157
RULES OF THE TRIAL. THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADER WILL OFFER AN 

01:18:23.758 --> 01:18:27.009
ORGANIZING RESOLUTION THAT 
OUTLINES HIS PLAN. HIS PLAN. FOR

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:33.711
THE RULES OF THE TRIAL. IT IS 
COMPLETELY PARTISAN. IT WAS KEPT

01:18:33.911 --> 01:18:38.594
SECRET UNTIL THE VERY EVE OF THE
TRIAL. AND NOW THAT IT'S PUBLIC,

01:18:38.794 --> 01:18:43.462
IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE WHY. THE 
McCONNELL RULES SEEM TO BE 

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:49.762
DESIGNED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP 
MOFOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT ASKS 

01:18:49.962 --> 01:18:53.012
THE SENATE TO RUSH THROUGH AS 
FAST AS POSSIBLE, AND MAKES 

01:18:53.211 --> 01:18:55.446
GETTING EVIDENCE AS HARD AS 
POSSIBLE. GOOD FOR HIS 

01:18:56.214 --> 01:18:58.214
PRESENTATIONS TO TAKE PLACE

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:03.521
AT 2:00 OR 3:00 IN THE MORNING 
SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WON'T SEE

01:19:03.676 --> 01:19:08.692
THEM. IN SHORT, McCONNELL 
RESOLUTION WILL RESULT IN A 

01:19:08.829 --> 01:19:13.758
RUSHED TRIAL WITH LITTLE 
EVIDENCE IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. 

01:19:13.897 --> 01:19:19.717
LITERALLY. THE DARK OF NIGHT. IF
THE PRESIDENT IS SO CONFIDENT IN

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:24.572
HIS CASE. IF LEADER McCONNELL IS
SO CONFIDENT THE PRESIDENT DID 

01:19:24.714 --> 01:19:28.856
NOTHING WRONG, WHY DON'T THEY 
WANT THE CASE TO BE PRESENTED IN

01:19:29.003 --> 01:19:31.003
BROAD DAYLIGHT.

01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:36.247
ON SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS 
IMPEACHMENT, THE McCONNELL 

01:19:36.373 --> 01:19:38.373
RESOLUTION IS NOTHING

01:19:41.351 --> 01:19:43.351
SHORT OF A NATIONAL DISGRACE. 
THIS WILL GO DOWN, THIS 

01:19:43.383 --> 01:19:45.880
RESOLUTION, AS ONE OF THE DARKER
MOMENTS IN THE SENATE HISTORY. 

01:19:46.037 --> 01:19:51.514
PERHAPS ONE OF EVEN THE DARKEST.
LEADER McCONNELL HAS JUST SAID 

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.765
HE WANTS TO GO BY THE CLINTON 
RULES. THEN WHY DID HE CHANGE 

01:19:54.965 --> 01:20:00.123
THEM IN FOUR IMPORTANT WAYS AT 
MINIMUM? THE ALL MAKE THE TRIAL 

01:20:00.266 --> 01:20:07.766
LESS TRANSPARENT, LESS CLEAR, 
AND WITLESS AS EVIDENCE. HE SAID

01:20:08.527 --> 01:20:14.266
HE WANTED TO GET STARTED IN 
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. IT TURNS 

01:20:14.467 --> 01:20:18.532
OUT, CONTRARY TO WHAT THE LEADER
SAID, I'M AMAZED HE COULD SAY IT

01:20:19.299 --> 01:20:24.216
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE. THAT THE 
RULES ARE THE SAME AS THE 

01:20:24.429 --> 01:20:27.039
CLINTON RULES. THE RULES ARE NOT
IN CLOSE TO THE CLINTON RULES.

01:20:31.334 --> 01:20:33.151
UNLIKE THE CLINTON RULES, THE 
McCONNELL RESOLUTION DOES NOT 

01:20:33.152 --> 01:20:35.260
ADMIT THE RECORD OF THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND 

01:20:35.399 --> 01:20:39.050
EVIDENCE. THE LEADER WANTS A 
TRIAL WITH NO EXISTING EVIDENCE 

01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:42.073
AND NO NEW EVIDENCE. A TRIAL 
WITHOUT EVIDENCE IS NOT A TRIAL.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.250
TO COVER UP.

01:20:51.033 --> 01:20:52.664
SECOND, UNLIKE THE CLINTON 
RULES, THE McCONNELL RESOLUTION 

01:20:52.665 --> 01:20:54.665
LIMITS PRESENTATION BY THE 
PARTIES TO 24 HOURS PER SIDE 

01:20:54.684 --> 01:21:01.603
OVER ONLY TWO DAYS. WE START AT 
1:00, 12 HOURS A DAY, 1 AM. 

01:21:01.803 --> 01:21:04.014
THAT'S WITHOUT BRAKES. IT WILL 
BE LATER. LEADER McCONNELL

01:21:08.705 --> 01:21:10.739
WANTS TO FORCE THE MANAGERS TO 
MAKE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THEIR 

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.940
CASE IN THE DARK OF NIGHT.

01:21:17.233 --> 01:21:19.233
NUMBER 3, UNLIKE THE CLINTON 
RULES, THE McCONNELL RESOLUTION 

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.466
PLACES AN ADDITIONAL HURDLE TO 
GET WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS BY 

01:21:22.612 --> 01:21:26.407
REQUIRING A VOTE ON WHETHER SUCH
MOTIONS ARE EVEN IN ORDER. IF 

01:21:26.543 --> 01:21:30.639
THAT VOTE FAILS, THEN NO MOTIONS
TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES AND 

01:21:30.854 --> 01:21:34.307
DOCUMENTS WILL BE IN ORDER. I 
DON'T WANT ANYONE ON THE OTHER 

01:21:34.508 --> 01:21:36.508
SIDE TO SAY I'M GOING TO VOTE NO
FIRST

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:43.643
ON WITNESSES, BUT THEN LATER, I 
WILL DETERMINE IF THEY VOTE FOR 

01:21:43.846 --> 01:21:45.846
McCONNELL'S RESOLUTION, THEY ARE
MAKING IT FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO 

01:21:45.876 --> 01:21:47.882
VOTE IN THE FUTURE. LATER ON IN 
THE TRIAL.

01:21:51.977 --> 01:21:53.795
&gt;&gt; FINALLY, UNLIKE THE CLINTON 
RULES, THE McCONNELL RESOLUTION 

01:21:53.796 --> 01:21:57.496
ALLOWS THE MOTION TO DISMISS AT 
ANY TIME, ANY TIME, IN THE 

01:21:57.642 --> 01:22:02.563
TRIAL. SO, IN SHORT, CONTRARY TO
WHAT THE LEADER HAS SAID,

01:22:06.603 --> 01:22:08.837
THE McCONNELL RULES ARE NOT AT 
ALL LIKE THE CLINTON RULES. THE 

01:22:09.037 --> 01:22:11.874
REPUBLICAN LEADER'S RESOLUTION 
IS BASED, NEITHER IN PRECEDENT 

01:22:12.089 --> 01:22:15.675
NOR IN PRINCIPLE. IT IS DRIVEN 
BY PARTISANSHIP AND THE POLITICS

01:22:15.826 --> 01:22:17.826
OF THE MOMENT.

01:22:22.245 --> 01:22:24.278
TODAY, I WILL BE OFFERING 
AMENDMENTS TO FIX THE MANY FLAWS

01:22:24.478 --> 01:22:29.953
IN LEADER McCONNELL'S DEEPLY 
UNFAIR RESOLUTION. AND SEEK THE 

01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:31.984
WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS WE HAVE 
REQUESTED. BEGINNING WITH AN 

01:22:31.985 --> 01:22:33.818
AMENDMENT TO HAVE THE SENATE 
SUBPOENA WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS. 

01:22:33.819 --> 01:22:36.455
LET ME BE CLEAR. THESE 
AMENDMENTS ARE NOT DILATORY. 

01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:39.270
THEY ONLY SEEK ONE THING. THE 
TRUTH.

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.007
THAT MEANS RELEVANT DOCUMENTS. 
THAT MEANS RELEVANT WITNESSES. 

01:22:46.008 --> 01:22:48.644
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET A 
FAIR TRIAL. AND EVERYONE IN THIS

01:22:48.844 --> 01:22:51.240
BODY KNOWS IT. EACH SET IT 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN OUR HISTORY

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:55.560
, ALL 15 THAT WERE BROUGHT TO 
COMPLETION FEATURE WITNESSES. 

01:22:56.525 --> 01:22:58.525
EVERY SINGLE ONE.

01:23:02.262 --> 01:23:04.440
THE WITNESSES WE REQUESTED NOT 
DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE THE 

01:23:04.623 --> 01:23:07.130
PRESIDENT'S OWN MEN. THE 
DOCUMENTS ARE NOT DEMOCRATIC 

01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:09.330
DOCUMENTS. THEY ARE DOCUMENTS 
PERIOD.

01:23:15.454 --> 01:23:17.701
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE EVIDENCE OF
THE WITNESSES OR THE DOCUMENTS 

01:23:17.901 --> 01:23:19.718
WILL BE EXCULPATORY TO THE 
PRESIDENT OR INCRIMINATING. BUT 

01:23:19.719 --> 01:23:23.532
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION, A SOLID 
ON SOLEMN OBLIGATION. ESPECIALLY

01:23:23.678 --> 01:23:25.678
DURING THIS MOST

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.103
DEEP AND SOLEMN PART OF THE 
CONSTITUTION TO SEEK THE TRUTH 

01:23:31.304 --> 01:23:36.787
AND THEN LET THE CHIPS FALL 
WHERE THEY MAY. MY REPUBLICAN 

01:23:36.988 --> 01:23:38.418
COLLEAGUES HAVE OFFERED SEVERAL 
EXPLANATIONS FOR OPPOSING 

01:23:38.419 --> 01:23:42.270
WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS AT THE 
START OF THE TRIAL. NONE OF THEM

01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:45.064
HAS MUCH MERIT. REPUBLICANS HAVE
SAID WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THE 

01:23:45.209 --> 01:23:48.169
QUESTION OF WITNESSES LATER IN 
THE TRIAL. OF COURSE, IT MAKES 

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:50.589
NO SENSE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES 
PRESENT THEIR CASE FIRST,

01:23:56.494 --> 01:23:58.529
AND THEN AFTERWARD THE SIDE OF 
THE SENATE SHOULD HEAR EVIDENCE.

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:01.111
THE EVIDENCE IS SUPPOSED TO 
INFORM ARGUMENTS, NOT COME AFTER

01:24:01.257 --> 01:24:03.257
THEIR COMPLETED NEST.

01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:07.831
SOME REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THE 
SENATE SHOULD NOT GO BEYOND 

01:24:07.865 --> 01:24:09.705
HOUSE RECORD BY CALLING ANY 
WITNESSES. BUT, THE CONSTITUTION

01:24:09.706 --> 01:24:11.732
GIVES THE SENATE THE SOLE POWER 
TO TRY IMPEACHMENTS. NOT THE 

01:24:11.932 --> 01:24:14.584
SOLE POWER TO REVIEW. NOT THE 
SOLE POWER TO REHASH. BUT, TO 

01:24:14.724 --> 01:24:19.167
TRY. REPUBLICANS HAVE CALLED A 
REQUEST FOR WITNESSES AND 

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:23.715
DOCUMENTS POLITICAL. SEEKING THE
TRUTH IS POLITICAL? THE 

01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:29.606
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN SERIOUS 
TROUBLE. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 

01:24:29.806 --> 01:24:31.868
SAID THAT THE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT ARE BRAZEN AND 

01:24:32.005 --> 01:24:36.868
WRONG. WELL, AT THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES IS IMPEACHMENT IS SO 

01:24:37.017 --> 01:24:43.623
BRAZEN AND WRONG, WHY WON'T HE 
SHOW US WHY? WHY IS THE 

01:24:43.822 --> 01:24:47.210
PRESIDENT SO INSISTENT THAT NO 
ONE COME FORWARD? THAT NO 

01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:51.940
DOCUMENTS BE RELEASED? IF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CASE IS SO WEAK THAT

01:24:52.154 --> 01:24:56.082
NONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MEN CAN 
DEFEND HIM UNDER OATH, SHAME ON 

01:24:56.218 --> 01:25:03.352
HIM. AND THOSE WHO ALLOWED TO 
HAPPEN. WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT 

01:25:03.495 --> 01:25:05.495
HIDING?

01:25:11.444 --> 01:25:13.073
WHAT ARE OUR REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES HIDING? BECAUSE IF 

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:15.106
THEY WEREN'T AFRAID OF THE 
TRUTH, THEY WOULD SAY GO RIGHT 

01:25:15.307 --> 01:25:17.573
AHEAD. GET AT THE TRUTH. GET 
WITNESSES. GET DOCUMENTS. IN 

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.720
FACT,

01:25:21.607 --> 01:25:24.041
AT NO POINT OVER THE LAST FEW 
MONTHS HAVE I HEARD A SINGLE, 

01:25:24.242 --> 01:25:26.242
SOLITARY ARGUMENT ON THE MERITS 
OF WHY WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS 

01:25:26.276 --> 01:25:29.525
SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE TRIAL.
NO REPUBLICANS EXPLAINED WHY 

01:25:29.726 --> 01:25:32.775
LESS EVIDENCE IS BETTER THAN 
MORE EVIDENCE. NEVERTHELESS, 

01:25:33.591 --> 01:25:35.625
LEADER McCONNELL IS POISED TO 
ASK THE SENATE TO BEGIN THE 

01:25:35.825 --> 01:25:37.882
FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF A 
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY WITHOUT 

01:25:38.024 --> 01:25:43.132
WITNESSES. THAT RUSHES THROUGH 
THE ARGUMENT AS QUICKLY AS 

01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:45.164
POSSIBLE. THAT IN WAYS BOTH 
SHAMELESS AND SUBTLE, WILL 

01:25:45.165 --> 01:25:49.433
CONCEAL THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH. 
FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. LEADER

01:25:49.634 --> 01:25:51.634
McCONNELL CLAIMS THAT THE HOUSES

01:25:55.319 --> 01:25:57.319
- THOROUGH AND MOST UNFAIR 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IN MODERN 

01:25:57.716 --> 01:26:03.039
HISTORY. THE TRUTH IS, LEADER 
McCONNELL IS PLOTTING THE MOST 

01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:05.983
RUSHED, LEAST THOROUGH AND MOST 
UNFAIR IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN 

01:26:06.144 --> 01:26:11.255
MODERN HISTORY. AND IT BEGINS 
TODAY. THE SENATE HAS BEFORE IT

01:26:16.445 --> 01:26:18.276
, VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION.
THE PRESIDENT IS ACCUSED OF 

01:26:18.277 --> 01:26:20.589
COERCING A FOREIGN POWER TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS, TO 

01:26:20.732 --> 01:26:25.796
HELP HIMSELF. IT IS THE JOB OF 
THE SENATE TO DETERMINE IF THESE

01:26:25.997 --> 01:26:29.407
VERY SERIOUS CHARGES ARE TRUE. 
THE VERY LEAST WE CAN DO

01:26:33.305 --> 01:26:35.692
IS EXAMINE THE FACTS, REVIEW THE
DOCUMENTS, HERE THE WITNESSES, 

01:26:35.837 --> 01:26:42.243
TRY THE CASE. NOT RUN FROM IT, 
NOT HIDE IT. TRY IT. BECAUSE OF 

01:26:42.443 --> 01:26:46.510
THE PRESIDENT COMMITS HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, AND 

01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:48.710
CONGRESS REFUSES TO ACT, REFUSES
EVEN TO

01:26:53.415 --> 01:26:55.415
CONDUCT A FAIR TRIAL OF HIS 
CONDUCT, THEN PRESIDENTS, THIS 

01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:57.851
PRESIDENT AND FUTURE PRESIDENTS 
CAN COMMIT IMPEACHABLE CRIMES 

01:26:57.992 --> 01:27:03.911
WITH IMPUNITY. AND THE ORDER AND
RIGOR OF OUR DEMOCRACY WILL 

01:27:04.061 --> 01:27:07.770
DRAMATICALLY DECLINE. THE 
FAILSAFE, THE FINAL FAILSAFE OF 

01:27:07.947 --> 01:27:09.947
OUR DEMOCRACY WILL BE RENDERED 
MOOT.

01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:17.183
THE MOST POWERFUL CHECK ON THE 
EXECUTIVE, THE ONE DESIGNED TO 

01:27:17.384 --> 01:27:21.048
PROTECT THE PEOPLE FROM TYRANNY 
WILL BE ERASED. IN SHORT TIME, 

01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:26.936
MY COLLEAGUES, EACH OF US WILL 
FACE A CHOICE, ABOUT WHETHER TO 

01:27:27.137 --> 01:27:31.008
BEGIN THIS TRIAL IN SEARCH OF 
THE TRUTH, OR IN SERVICE OF THE 

01:27:31.144 --> 01:27:35.873
PRESIDENT'S DESIRE TO COVER IT 
UP. WHETHER THE SENATE WILL 

01:27:36.475 --> 01:27:41.301
CONDUCT A FAIR TRIAL AND A FULL 
AIRING OF THE FACTS, OR A RUSH 

01:27:41.442 --> 01:27:50.092
TO A PREDETERMINED POLITICAL 
OUTCOME. MY COLLEAGUES, THE EYES

01:27:50.292 --> 01:27:54.160
OF THE NATION, THE EYES OF 
HISTORY, THE EYES OF THE 

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.831
FOUNDING FATHERS ARE UPON US. 
HISTORY WILL BE OUR FINAL JUDGE.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.462
WILL SENATORS RISE TO THE 
OCCASION? I YIELD THE FLOOR.

01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:13.210
&gt;&gt;&gt; UNDER THE PREVIOUS ORDER, 
THE LEADERSHIP TIME IS RESERVED.

01:28:13.243 --> 01:28:15.074
MORNING BUSINESS IS CLOSED. 
UNDER THE PREVIOUS ORDER, THE 

01:28:15.075 --> 01:28:17.486
SENATE STANDS IN RECESS, SUBJECT
TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR.

01:28:26.445 --> 01:28:28.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE A BRIEF RECESS 
BECAUSE IT JUST 1.5 MINUTES, 

01:28:28.881 --> 01:28:30.881
1:00, WE EXPECT TO SEE THE 
SENATE GAVILAN FOR THE 

01:28:30.913 --> 01:28:33.390
IMPEACHMENT, THE TRIAL PRESIDENT
TRUMP. I AM HERE IN THE STUDIO 

01:28:33.529 --> 01:28:35.594
WITH ERIN BLAKE. OKAY, AARON, WE
ACTUALLY NEED SOME INFORMATION 

01:28:35.794 --> 01:28:40.877
HERE BECAUSE LEADER McCONNELL. 
GOING TO MOVE TO TABLE ANY THING

01:28:41.077 --> 01:28:43.510
THEY MAY BRING UP. YOU MAY JUDGE
IT JUST SCOOTED ALONG AND NOT 

01:28:43.711 --> 01:28:45.742
EVEN GIVE THEM FILTERED AIRING 
BEFORE THE SENATE. McCONNELL 

01:28:45.943 --> 01:28:47.943
LOSING WORDS LIKE THIS IS

01:28:52.043 --> 01:28:54.076
A MID-TRIAL QUESTION. SO, HE IS 
ALREADY TRYING TO CHANGE THE 

01:28:54.276 --> 01:28:58.142
EXPECTATION OF JUST WHEN 
WITNESSES WOULD BE INTRODUCED. 

01:28:58.944 --> 01:29:00.375
EVIDENCE WOULD COME IN IF AT 
ALL. 

01:29:00.376 --> 01:29:02.810
&gt;&gt; THE ARGUMENT IS BASICALLY, WE
WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THESE 

01:29:03.011 --> 01:29:05.073
THINGS AT SOME POINT. SCHUMER 
MAKES SOME IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS 

01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:08.694
THERE. IN WHAT WAYS IS IS 
ACTUALLY DIFFERENT THAN HOW THE 

01:29:08.909 --> 01:29:10.909
CLINTON IMPEACHMENT RULES WERE 
HANDLED, GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:29:15.610 --> 01:29:18.043
. THE RULES YOU PRETTY CLOSELY 
TO THAT AND THAT HAS BEEN MITCH 

01:29:18.244 --> 01:29:20.244
McCONNELL'S ARGUMENT THROUGHOUT.
ONE KEY DIFFERENCE IS OBVIOUSLY,

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.543
THE COMPRESSED SCHEDULE THAT 
ONLY TWO DAYS FOR OPENING 

01:29:24.743 --> 01:29:26.743
ARGUMENTS RATHER THAN THREE. 
SAME AMOUNT OF TIME, BUT JUST 

01:29:26.776 --> 01:29:28.609
COMPRESSED INTO FEWER DAYS, 
BRINGING US LATER INTO THE 

01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:30.427
NIGHT. SECOND ONE IS HOUSE 
EVIDENCE IS NOT IMMEDIATELY 

01:29:30.428 --> 01:29:32.460
EMBEDDED INTO THE RECORD. THIS 
IS SOMETHING THAT GETS VOTED ON 

01:29:32.674 --> 01:29:34.695
AFTER THE ART OPENING ARGUMENTS,
AFTER THE SENATE ASKED QUESTION.

01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:37.680
CHUCK SCHUMER THERE ESSENTIALLY 
ARGUED THAT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE 

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:42.773
OPENING ARGUMENTS AND THE 
QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS NOT TO 

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:46.929
BE BASED ON THE KNOWN EVIDENCE. 
WILL SEE TO WHAT DEGREE THAT'S 

01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:51.963
TRUE. I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF 
ULTIMATELY THEY DID NOT GET 

01:29:52.165 --> 01:29:54.165
ENOUGH REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO 
ADMIT THAT EVIDENCE BUT IT WON'T

01:29:54.346 --> 01:29:59.907
BE UNTIL LATER IN THE, THE HOPE 
TO ACTUALLY HAVE VOTES ON THE 

01:30:00.085 --> 01:30:02.119
EVIDENCE AND NEW EVIDENCE. THAT 
WILL TAKE PLACE AGAIN IT APPEARS

01:30:02.319 --> 01:30:04.319
WE HAVE ENOUGH - TWO HAVE ENOUGH

01:30:09.639 --> 01:30:12.283
TO ALLOW THAT TO TAKE PLACE. IF 
WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE MAYBE 

01:30:12.484 --> 01:30:14.316
THESE REPUBLICANS THESE, THE 
SWING VOTES IS EITHER NOT 

01:30:14.317 --> 01:30:20.001
TERRIBLY MOVED BY THE EVIDENCE 
THEY SIN, THEY CAN VOTE AGAINST 

01:30:20.202 --> 01:30:22.034
HAVING ANY WITNESSES, RATHER 
THAN JUST A VOTING AGAINST 

01:30:22.035 --> 01:30:24.035
HAVING JOHN BOLTON TESTIFY. 
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, IT MIGHT 

01:30:24.212 --> 01:30:27.720
BE THE SAME THING, BUT MAYBE 
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN EASIER

01:30:27.918 --> 01:30:30.151
VOTE FOR THEM AND MAYBE THAT'S 
WHY McCONNELL IS GOING DOWN THIS

01:30:30.352 --> 01:30:32.385
ROAD. THE FOURTH ONE AND I DON'T
KNOW SENATOR SCHUMER MENTIONED 

01:30:32.585 --> 01:30:35.373
THIS, BUT THE VOTES TO DISMISS. 
IN THE CLINTON TRIAL, THERE WAS 

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:37.514
AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:30:40.718 --> 01:30:42.752
VOTE ON WHETHER TO DISMISS THE 
CHARGES. THAT WAS MANDATORY AT 

01:30:42.951 --> 01:30:44.951
THE TIME. THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY 
INCLUDED IN THESE RULES. 

01:31:16.563 --> 01:31:18.793
HIS DEFENSE TEAM PUT SOME OF THE
DEFENSE AND THEY ARE NOW 

01:31:19.002 --> 01:31:21.026
COUNTERING MATT. WE WILL SEE 
THIS IN THE COMING DAYS. TODAY 

01:31:21.227 --> 01:31:23.472
IS A DAY OF PROCEDURE WHERE WE 
WILL SEE MITCH McCONNELL TALK 

01:31:23.672 --> 01:31:26.511
ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AND 
CHUCK SCHUMER AND DEMOCRATS  

01:31:26.923 --> 01:31:34.235
WILL PUSH BACK. WE ARE LIKELY TO
SEE SENATORS GET SWORN IN AND WE

01:31:34.992 --> 01:31:38.905
WILL SEE THE RANKS OF THE REST 
OF THE NINE SENDERS AND COME 

01:31:39.104 --> 01:31:44.390
INTO THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY
HAVE TO NOT HAVE DEVICES AND 

01:31:44.595 --> 01:31:47.463
THEY HAVE TO SIT AND LISTEN AND 
BE PASSIVE CONSUMERS AND 

01:31:47.638 --> 01:31:53.534
OBSERVERS OF WHAT IS TAKING 
PLACE. WE MAY SEE SOME VOTES IN 

01:31:53.736 --> 01:31:56.582
THE COMING HOURS BUT THAT IS 
ONLY IF McCONNELL DOESN'T SHUT 

01:31:56.783 --> 01:32:01.450
IT DOWN RIGHT AWAY. 
&gt;&gt;  IN REGARDS OF HOW MUCH OF A 

01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:05.060
DEBATE WE HAVE, THERE IS NO 
LIGHT

01:32:12.015 --> 01:32:14.047
FOR REPUBLICANS ON THIS. EVEN 
ALEXANDER WHO IS ONE OF THE 

01:32:14.251 --> 01:32:16.408
FOURTH VOTES TO SAY WE HAVE TO 
HAVE WITNESSES

01:32:19.733 --> 01:32:22.581
,  THEY HAVE BEEN IN LINE WITH 
THESE RULES THAT WE NEED TO VOTE

01:32:22.782 --> 01:32:25.015
ON THESE THINGS LATER RON. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A SUCCESS FOR MITCH 

01:32:25.216 --> 01:32:27.651
McCONNELL  TO START WITH WHAT HE
WANTS TO HAVE HAPPEN AND WHAT 

01:32:27.866 --> 01:32:30.097
THE APPETITE IS FOR WITNESSES, 
THAT IS A REAL QUESTION MARK AS 

01:32:30.298 --> 01:32:33.546
THINGS GO FORWARD. I HAVE HEARD 
PEOPLE CAUGHT THE BUTT NUMBING 

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.948
STRATEGY BECAUSE SO MANY WILL BE
SITTING

01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:44.716
FOR SEVERAL DAYS THAT THEY MAY 
BE OVER THE PROCESS OR THEY MAY 

01:32:44.919 --> 01:32:46.919
NOT FEEL LIKE DEMOCRATIC AND 
FUTURE MANAGERS HAVE MADE A 

01:32:46.949 --> 01:32:48.949
STRONG ENOUGH CASE. 
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A REASON WHY THESE 

01:32:48.982 --> 01:32:51.776
RULES ARE BEING DELAYED.  THINGS
CAN CHANGE EARLY ON AND PEOPLE 

01:32:51.938 --> 01:32:57.515
CAN BE TUNED OUT AND MAYBE THESE
SWING LOOKING VOTES, MAYBE THEY 

01:32:57.714 --> 01:32:59.714
SUDDENLY FEEL LIKE

01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:04.222
THE CASE HAS NOT BEEN THAT 
COMPELLING AND PEOPLE ARE NOT 

01:33:04.424 --> 01:33:07.617
THAT TUNED IN AND THEY HAVE MORE
COVERAGE TO VOTE IN A WAY THAT 

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:09.782
IS

01:33:11.325 --> 01:33:13.569
MORE APPEALING FOR THE PRESIDENT
AND DOESN'T LOOK AS POOR ON THEM

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.993
IN A SPECIFIC IS A HAVE 
CAMPAIGNS TO WORRY ABOUT MY CALL

01:33:16.207 --> 01:33:19.656
AND CORY GARDNER. IF PEOPLE ARE 
BORED OF ALL OF THIS AND THEY 

01:33:19.856 --> 01:33:22.906
GET TIME TO THOSE VOTES, IT WILL
BE EASIER FOR THEM TO CAST SOME 

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.557
TOUGH VOTES THAT MAY BE RIGHT 
NOW SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE WANT TO 

01:33:27.307 --> 01:33:32.039
SEE THAT EVIDENCE AND THE POLLS 
WILL CERTAINLY SHOW THAT BUT 

01:33:32.255 --> 01:33:37.734
THINGS CAN CHANGE AND PEOPLE CAN
TUNE OUT OR CAN SAY MAYBE IT 

01:33:37.935 --> 01:33:40.368
WASN'T A HUGE DEAL TO VOTE. 
&gt;&gt; CENTERS ARE GATHERING  AND 

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:45.248
SENDERS WILL BE SEATED AND THEY 
WILL NOT BE COMMUNICATING OUT 

01:33:45.447 --> 01:33:47.447
WITH STAFF OR OTHER PEOPLE.

01:33:52.562 --> 01:33:54.636
THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT 
OLD-SCHOOL WITH NO DEVICES IN 

01:33:54.802 --> 01:33:57.230
TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN DO. 
&gt;&gt; THE NEW ROLE WE ARE ALL 

01:33:57.441 --> 01:33:59.461
TALKING ABOUT  IS THE BEVERAGE 
ROLE. APPARENTLY YOU CAN ONLY 

01:33:59.675 --> 01:34:01.675
DRINK WATER OR MILK.

01:34:04.956 --> 01:34:07.794
&gt;&gt; THAT IS JUST IN THE ROLES. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS ACTUALLY  IN THE RULES.

01:34:08.541 --> 01:34:13.429
WE HAVE ARCHAIC RULES AND WE ARE
DIGGING INTO ALL OF THEM. 

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:15.430
&gt;&gt; 

01:34:16.938 --> 01:34:19.373
ERIN, WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING 
FOR TODAY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO 

01:34:19.572 --> 01:34:23.837
GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH CONTROL 
CHUCK SCHUMER HAS OVER HIS  

01:34:24.253 --> 01:34:26.624
CAUCUS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN 
MAKE WITH THE MODERATE 

01:34:26.856 --> 01:34:28.916
REPUBLICANS IN TERMS OF SETTING 
PARAMETERS? 

01:34:28.917 --> 01:34:33.311
&gt;&gt; DO THE LIKES OF  MITT ROMNEY 
AND SUSAN COLLINS

01:34:39.482 --> 01:34:41.513
HAVE REACTION WITH HOW THE 
DEBATES ARE PENDING OUT? ALL OF 

01:34:41.715 --> 01:34:47.812
THIS DEPENDS ALMOST SOLELY ON 
THE 3 TO 4 HOOK IN SENATORS THAT

01:34:48.012 --> 01:34:50.249
WOULD NEED TO BE CROSSING OVER 
IN ORDER TO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE 

01:34:50.446 --> 01:34:52.838
OTHERWISE THIS PROCESS WILL BE 
BASICALLY ADDING TO THE PUBLIC 

01:34:53.031 --> 01:34:59.188
RECORD AND EVERYONE CAN SAY WHAT
THEY WANT BUT MITT ROMNEY AND 

01:34:59.589 --> 01:35:01.823
COLLINS SAY ON THE HOUSE FLOOR 
OR ANYWHERE ELSE OF WHAT WILL 

01:35:02.035 --> 01:35:04.035
TELL US AND

01:35:08.533 --> 01:35:10.533
I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY 
FRUSTRATION OF HOW THEY WERE 

01:35:10.566 --> 01:35:15.031
SHOWING THIS AND THEY ARE 
GETTING OUTRAGED BY EVERYTHING 

01:35:15.433 --> 01:35:17.697
WHEN THESE RULES ARE PRETTY 
CLOSE WITH THE

01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.615
CLINTON TRIAL AND MAYBE THEY 
SHOULD TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE 

01:35:26.814 --> 01:35:29.246
BIT. I THINK FOR MITT ROMNEY, 
THAT IS LITTLE BIT OF A WARNING 

01:35:29.447 --> 01:35:31.681
SIGN SAYING IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
PUSH THIS HARD, IT WILL BE 

01:35:31.895 --> 01:35:34.128
HARDER FOR ME TO GET ON BOARD 
WITH YOU EVENTUALLY DOWN THE 

01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:36.562
LINE AND MADE PEOPLE SHOULD 
LIGHTEN UP AND LET THINGS PLAY 

01:35:36.762 --> 01:35:38.952
OUT BEFORE WE HAVE THESE 
OUTRAGED POLITICAL BASES. 

01:35:38.953 --> 01:35:40.953
&gt;&gt; 

01:35:46.508 --> 01:35:48.541
CHUCK SCHUMER MADE HIS REMARKS 
AS THE SENATE GOT UNDERWAY AND 

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:51.190
HE HAS TO BE AWARE OF THE 
AUDIENCE AND WHO HE IS SPEAKING 

01:35:51.389 --> 01:35:54.641
TO. THERE IS A REAL DANGER  IN 
GETTING TOO PARTISAN AND BEING 

01:35:54.842 --> 01:35:57.078
TOO OUTRAGED ONLY IN THE SENSE 
THAT IT COULD ALIENATE SOME OF 

01:35:57.277 --> 01:36:01.343
THE MODERATE REPUBLICANS AND 
THAT IS PART OF HIS AUDIENCE. IT

01:36:01.543 --> 01:36:04.038
COULD ALSO ELEVATE SUPPORTERS. 
HE HAS TO WALK THAT FINE LINE OF

01:36:04.204 --> 01:36:07.442
PUSHING FORWARD WHAT THE 
DEMOCRATS REALLY BELIEVE AND 

01:36:07.642 --> 01:36:10.690
ALSO TRYING TO BE AS REASONABLE 
AND CALM AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE

01:36:10.892 --> 01:36:14.542
REPUBLICANS ARE DECIDING WITH 
HIM. 

01:36:14.543 --> 01:36:16.776
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE 
FOUR CENTERS THAT WE HAVE BEEN 

01:36:16.976 --> 01:36:19.422
TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE  AND 
SOMETIMES THEY WILL MAKE 

01:36:19.623 --> 01:36:25.309
COMMENTS THAT SUGGEST THEY ARE 
VERY OPEN AND WOULD VOTE IN 

01:36:25.507 --> 01:36:28.290
FAVOR BUT OTHERWISE THEY SUGGEST
THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH 

01:36:28.455 --> 01:36:30.455
HOW

01:36:32.421 --> 01:36:34.038
McCONNELL IS HANDLING THIS 
PROCESS. THEY ARE BEING 

01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:36.273
DIPLOMATIC AND TRY TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THEY DON'T COMMIT TOO FAR 

01:36:36.487 --> 01:36:38.720
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AT THIS 
POINT WHICH IS WHAT POLITICIANS 

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.155
DO AND THAT IS NOT TERRIBLY 
SURPRISING BUT I THINK IT DOES 

01:36:41.356 --> 01:36:43.388
DEFLECT THE DIFFICULT SITUATION 
THEY ARE IN AND THEY ALWAYS WANT

01:36:43.589 --> 01:36:45.589
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KEEP THAT
POWER

01:36:49.071 --> 01:36:51.316
TO MAKE THOSE HARD DECISIONS 
LATER ON AND THEY DON'T WANT TO 

01:36:51.518 --> 01:36:55.986
SAY TOO MUCH AT THE FRONT END OF
THE PROCESS THAT WOULD MAKE IT 

01:36:56.186 --> 01:36:58.619
LOOK LIKE THEY WOULD FLIP SO I 
THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE 

01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:01.173
THAT AND IF THEY DO STEP SIDE OF
THE CIRCUMSPECT

01:37:13.043 --> 01:37:15.475
AS MAYBE MITT ROMNEY DID A 
LITTLE BIT, WE CAN TAKE THAT AS 

01:37:15.689 --> 01:37:17.721
A BIG INDICATOR OF WHICH WAY 
THEY MIGHT BE LEANING. 

01:37:17.722 --> 01:37:19.955
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, WE ARE WATCHING 
FOR THIS TO GET UNDERWAY. LET'S 

01:37:20.155 --> 01:37:22.387
GO TO OUR COLLEAGUE ON CAPITOL 
HILL THAT HAS BEEN TRACKING ALL 

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:25.023
OF THIS  THIS MORNING. RHONDA, 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REMARKS, WHAT

01:37:25.237 --> 01:37:28.030
DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; ONE THING , WHEN I HEARD 

01:37:28.193 --> 01:37:32.138
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER DISCUSS 
HIS PLANS, HE PLANS TO BRING UP 

01:37:32.341 --> 01:37:34.976
ELEMENTS AND HE SAID  EARLIER 
THAT HE PLANS TO BRING A SERIES 

01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:37.725
OF AMENDMENTS

01:37:39.455 --> 01:37:42.038
TO FIX THE FLAWS ARE ARE IN 
McCONNELL'S RESOLUTION IN HIS 

01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:45.340
WORDS. THAT WILL SET THE 
GUIDELINES FOR THIS TRIAL AND 

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.988
WHEN REPORTERS ASKED CHUCK 
SCHUMER WHATEVER MINTS WILL YOU 

01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:50.944
BRING AND HOW MANY WILL THERE  
BE, HE WAS NOT FORTHCOMING

01:37:54.689 --> 01:37:57.324
BUT HE DID RELEASE A MEMBER THAT
HE INTENDS TO BRING UP ON THIS 

01:37:57.525 --> 01:37:59.916
ORGANIZATIONAL RESOLUTION AND 
THE FIRST ONE IS TO HAVE THE 

01:38:00.084 --> 01:38:02.084
SENATE

01:38:05.043 --> 01:38:07.043
SUBPOENA WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS 
RELATED TO THE UKRAINE CALL AND 

01:38:07.074 --> 01:38:09.074
SPECIFICALLY HE WOULD SAY THAT 
HE WANTS DOCUMENTS FROM BOLTON 

01:38:09.108 --> 01:38:11.108
EMIL VANIA THAT

01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:19.641
SURROUND THE UKRAINE CALL SO 
EXPECT A LOT OF BACK-AND-FORTH 

01:38:19.673 --> 01:38:21.673
TODAY AFTER THIS RESOLUTION IS 
BROUGHT UP. DEMOCRATS WILL 

01:38:22.058 --> 01:38:26.373
CERTAINLY PRESS FOR AMENDMENTS 
AS WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 

01:38:26.573 --> 01:38:28.609
THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM 
CHUCK SCHUMER, THE MINORITY 

01:38:29.369 --> 01:38:34.091
LEADER  IN THE SENATE AND WHAT 
SET OUT TO MEET WITH McCONNELL'S

01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:37.139
COMMENTS IS THAT HE IS NOT 
BACKING DOWN. HE IS SHOWING THAT

01:38:37.341 --> 01:38:39.990
THE BALL IS IN HIS COURT RIGHT 
NOW AND HE MAKES THE DECISIONS 

01:38:40.190 --> 01:38:43.440
ON HOW THE RULES AND RESOLUTION 
WILL GO ABOUT AND IT REMAINS TO 

01:38:44.199 --> 01:38:48.108
BE SEEN HOW MANY CLASHES MIGHT 
HAPPEN TODAY OVER THESE RULES. 

01:38:48.868 --> 01:38:53.592
&gt;&gt;  MUCH OF THIS HAPPENED BEHIND
THE SCENES WITH THE CLINTON 

01:38:54.356 --> 01:38:56.356
IMPEACHMENT AND THERE WASN'T 
REALLY AN ATTEMPT BY SENDERS TO 

01:38:56.441 --> 01:39:01.926
HAVE A DECOR ROOM AND THEN THEY 
SAW THAT OVER IN THE HOUSE WITH 

01:39:02.123 --> 01:39:05.988
THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT WHICH 
WAS SUCH A FLAME DURING BODY. WE

01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:10.087
ARE NOT SEEING THAT THIS TIME. 
&gt;&gt;  YEAH AND I THINK PART OF 

01:39:10.256 --> 01:39:16.541
THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THE SET 
UP OF THE SENATE BACK THEN. I 

01:39:16.756 --> 01:39:18.810
REMEMBER IN 1999, THE 
REPUBLICANS CONTROLLED HOUSE AND

01:39:18.988 --> 01:39:20.988
THE REPUBLICANS CONTROLLED 
SENATE

01:39:23.656 --> 01:39:25.813
. THERE WAS A REASON FOR 
DEMOCRATS

01:39:36.656 --> 01:39:38.689
OR VULCAN DRIVER TO GO ALONG 
WITH DEMOCRATS AND LOOK LIKE 

01:39:38.891 --> 01:39:40.720
THEY WERE BEING MIDDLEGROUND 
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY HAD 

01:39:40.721 --> 01:39:42.956
CONTROL OVER THE PROCESS MOVING 
FORWARD AND THEY CAN VOTE ON THE

01:39:43.155 --> 01:39:45.186
WITNESSES LATER IF THEY WANT TO 
AND THEY EVENTUALLY DID THAT 

01:39:45.387 --> 01:39:47.387
WITH WILENSKY AND JORDAN 
TESTIFYING AND IN THIS CASE IF 

01:39:47.417 --> 01:39:49.451
DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO GET ANY 
LEVERAGE OVER THIS, IT WOULD 

01:39:49.657 --> 01:39:52.701
HAPPEN AT THE FRONT END AND THIS
IS REALLY THE LAST DITCH EFFORT 

01:39:52.901 --> 01:39:57.581
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME CONTROL 
OVER THE DIRECTION OF THE TRIAL.

01:39:57.782 --> 01:40:01.236
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT 
JUDGING BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BUT

01:40:01.433 --> 01:40:06.314
WHAT TODAY WILL BE MORE ABOUT IS
MORE LIKELY A MESSAGING EXERCISE

01:40:06.515 --> 01:40:08.950
AND THAT IS WHY I THINK WE SAW 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT RHONDA 

01:40:09.154 --> 01:40:12.135
WAS TALKING ABOUT. IT IS 
SUBPOENAING WHITE HOUSE 

01:40:12.327 --> 01:40:14.327
DOCUMENTS.

01:40:17.078 --> 01:40:19.078
THEY CAN SAY NOW THAT RAMEKINS 
VOTED AGAINST INCLUDING WHITE 

01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:22.759
HOUSE DOCUMENTS THAT CAN REALLY 
SHED LIGHT ON THESE THINGS SO 

01:40:23.174 --> 01:40:25.174
GIVEN THAT IS THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT, I THINK THAT SPEAKS 

01:40:25.206 --> 01:40:30.274
TO WHAT THIS EXERCISE WILL BE 
WHICH IS A MESSAGING EXERCISE. 

01:40:30.489 --> 01:40:32.489
&gt;&gt; DOES THAT PUT SOME OF THE 
MODERATE 

01:40:36.373 --> 01:40:38.607
PUBLICANS IN A TOUGH SPOT? 
&gt;&gt; THAT DECIDES THE ASPECT OF IT

01:40:38.847 --> 01:40:41.453
IF THAT WILL BE A TOP VOTE FOR 
COLLINS OR MICHALSKI OR ROMNEY  

01:40:41.656 --> 01:40:46.321
BUT I THINK THE ARGUMENT THEY 
WILL COME BACK WITH WHICH IS I 

01:40:46.536 --> 01:40:48.565
HAVE BEEN TALKING FOREVER ABOUT 
HOW WE NEED TO HAVE THESE 

01:40:48.767 --> 01:40:54.452
DEBATES LATER ON ONCE WE HEAR 
THE ARGUMENTS AND THERE'S ALWAYS

01:40:54.652 --> 01:40:56.883
A TIME TO VOTE FOR THAT LATER ON
IN THE PROCESS. 

01:40:56.884 --> 01:41:00.208
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE TOTALLY GIVING COVER
AND THERE IS NO RULE THAT SAYS 

01:41:00.373 --> 01:41:02.577
THEY ARE MID-TRIAL QUESTIONS BUT
HE IS GIVING COVER TO SAY NOT 

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:05.012
NOW AND WE WILL SEE WHAT THE 
APPETITE IS LATER. 

01:41:05.013 --> 01:41:08.785
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.  I WOULDN'T EXPECT 
TO SEE ANY OF THEM

01:41:12.324 --> 01:41:14.324
DEPART ON PARTYLINE BECAUSE THEY
HAVE BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT THAT

01:41:14.919 --> 01:41:17.807
THE VOTES SHOULD TAKE PLACE 
LATER AND THAT IS ME DEMOCRATS 

01:41:18.007 --> 01:41:20.856
WILL COME BACK AND SAY THAT 
ROMNEY SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO 

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:23.060
SEE THESE DOCUMENTS RIGHT AWAY.

01:41:26.756 --> 01:41:28.984
HE APPROVED THESE RULES WITHOUT 
SAYING WE NEED ALL OF THE HOUSE 

01:41:29.184 --> 01:41:31.184
EVIDENCE IMMEDIATELY AND THOSE 
ARE FAIR ARGUMENTS

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.935
THAT MITT ROMNEY WILL COME BACK 
AND SAY THOSE THINGS WILL COME 

01:41:39.135 --> 01:41:41.169
IN TIME IF WE NEED THEM. 
&gt;&gt; WE HEARD SENATOR CHUCK 

01:41:41.369 --> 01:41:43.614
SCHUMER SAY A TRIAL WITHOUT 
EVIDENCE IS NOT A TRIAL BUT A 

01:41:43.815 --> 01:41:46.248
COVER-UP.  WE ARE HEARING THAT 
PHRASE TESTED BY DEMOCRATS AND 

01:41:46.448 --> 01:41:48.480
DOES NOT STICK WITH THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC OR RESONATE IN PEOPLE'S 

01:41:48.681 --> 01:41:50.663
MINDS? 
&gt;&gt; IT IS A CURIOUS QUESTION 

01:41:50.664 --> 01:41:53.964
BECAUSE  THE IDEA THAT UNLIKE 
THE CLINTON TRIAL, WE WILL NOT 

01:41:54.165 --> 01:41:57.830
SEE THAT EVIDENCE ADMITTED RIGHT
AWAY AND BACK THEN OF COURSE IT 

01:41:58.030 --> 01:42:00.264
WAS THE REPORT BUT THIS TIME IT 
IS THE EVIDENCE THAT IS 

01:42:00.464 --> 01:42:02.464
COLLECTED BY THE HOUSE AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC CONTROL

01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:08.183
HOUSE. HOW ARE THOSE OPENING 
ARGUMENTS GOING TO BE CHANGED BY

01:42:08.383 --> 01:42:10.383
THAT? WHAT IF THEY START TALKING
ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT SENATORS 

01:42:10.414 --> 01:42:14.280
DON'T HAVE OR WILL IT BE 
PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT 

01:42:14.481 --> 01:42:18.947
WHAT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES 
FOR IMPEACHMENT? IT WILL BE 

01:42:19.148 --> 01:42:24.847
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH 
EVIDENCE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 

01:42:25.047 --> 01:42:27.483
TALK ABOUT GIVEN THAT IT IS NOT 
ENTERED INTO THE RECORD WITH THE

01:42:27.683 --> 01:42:33.166
QUESTIONS FOR THE SENATORS AND 
IF THEY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN 

01:42:33.368 --> 01:42:35.368
INTRODUCED INTO THE RECORD. 
&gt;&gt; 

01:42:40.683 --> 01:42:42.683
LEADER McCONNELL WANT TO SAY 
THAT HE IS FOLLOWING PRECEDENT 

01:42:42.716 --> 01:42:44.952
BY TAKING THE CLINTON TRIAL AS 
HIS ROADMAP AND YET HE IS 

01:42:45.151 --> 01:42:47.151
TOTALLY DEVIATING FROM THAT. 
THERE IS A LOT OF UNFAIRNESS 

01:42:47.186 --> 01:42:49.217
THAT IS NOT STICKING TO WHAT 
HAPPENED DURING THE CLINTON AREA

01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:52.666
BUT IT IS FASCINATING THAT 
McCONNELL WAS ABLE TO LAY 

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:55.836
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS THE 
STARTING POINT.

01:43:00.185 --> 01:43:02.415
EVERYONE IS TAKING IT LIKE A 
GIVEN AS THAT IS THE STARTING 

01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:04.863
PLACE OF WHERE THIS AGO AND 
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN TWO OTHER 

01:43:05.063 --> 01:43:09.933
TRIALS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS 
NATION SO HE IS SAYING 24 HOURS 

01:43:10.134 --> 01:43:14.614
BUT TO CUT IT UP INTO THESE 
MARATHON DAYS IS NOT DOING THE 

01:43:14.815 --> 01:43:19.683
DEMOCRATS ANY FAVORS. 
&gt;&gt;  LIKE I SAID BEFORE, IT IS A 

01:43:19.882 --> 01:43:23.344
DEPARTURE FROM THE CLINTON 
ROADMAP AND IT IS SIMILAR IN 

01:43:23.546 --> 01:43:25.579
MANY WAYS BUT THE FOUR THINGS 
THAT I OUTLINED BEFORE ARE 

01:43:26.338 --> 01:43:28.338
NOTABLE DEPARTURES

01:43:30.863 --> 01:43:33.297
AND THEY ALL SEEM TO THE AIR IN 
A DIRECTION THAT IS MORE 

01:43:33.497 --> 01:43:35.330
FRIENDLY FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 
DEFENSE BY HAVING THESE THINGS 

01:43:35.331 --> 01:43:37.362
LATE AND BY COMPRESSING THREE 
DAYS OF ARGUMENTS INTO TWO BY 

01:43:37.563 --> 01:43:40.197
HAVING THAT VOTE WITH THE HOUSE 
EVIDENCE LATER ON RATHER THAN AT

01:43:40.949 --> 01:43:45.483
THE BEGINNING AND GIVING IT TO 
ALL SENATORS RIGHT AWAY, THOSE 

01:43:45.683 --> 01:43:49.135
ARE KEY DIFFERENCES AND THEY MAY
SING LIKE SMALL CHANGES BUT IT 

01:43:49.348 --> 01:43:51.898
COULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON HOW 
MANY PEOPLE TUNED IN

01:43:55.432 --> 01:43:57.464
AND HOW MUCH THIS WILL BE 
DEALING WITH THE EVIDENCE. 

01:43:57.465 --> 01:43:59.496
&gt;&gt; THE MORE THAT THE LEADER 
McCONNELL CAN GET POLITICS OUT 

01:43:59.697 --> 01:44:02.947
OF IT  AND REFER TO IT AS 
PROCEDURAL ISSUES, THE EASIER IT

01:44:03.161 --> 01:44:06.399
IS FOR HAWKINS TO GET COVER 
UNDER HIS SHELTER. I WANT TO GO 

01:44:06.612 --> 01:44:09.931
OVER WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE. 
THIS IS HOW LEADER McCONNELL 

01:44:10.263 --> 01:44:16.306
WANTS THINGS TO LOOK. THIS IS 
OVER TWO DAYS AND 16 HOURS FOR 

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.231
QUESTIONS AND THERE COULD BE A 
MOTION TO DISMISS AND THEM FOUR 

01:44:21.432 --> 01:44:23.462
HOURS TO DEBATE ON THE WITNESSES
AND DOCUMENTS.  

01:44:23.463 --> 01:44:27.130
&gt;&gt;  YES AND IF WE START TO GET 
TOWARDS THE END WHERE THERE ARE 

01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:31.392
REAL DEBATES ON WITNESSES OR 
RESTART HAVING VOTES ON 

01:44:31.594 --> 01:44:33.594
DEPOSITIONS BEING REQUIRED, THIS
IS A PROCESS

01:44:43.374 --> 01:44:45.606
THAT COULD TRIAL LONGER THAN TWO
WEEKS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OF 

01:44:45.807 --> 01:44:48.041
AN APPETITE THERE IS FOR NEW 
EVIDENCE IN THE CASE AND OF 

01:44:48.256 --> 01:44:50.688
COURSE THAT BRINGS US TO THE EVE
OF THE CAUCUSES WHICH A FEW 

01:44:50.889 --> 01:44:52.720
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS RESIDING MAY
NOT BE PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH 

01:44:52.721 --> 01:44:55.556
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF THAT IS
WHAT THE PARTY NEEDS TO GET NEW 

01:44:55.758 --> 01:44:58.206
EVIDENCE, THAT WILL BE THE PRICE
OF DOING BUSINESS. I CAN SEE AN 

01:44:58.405 --> 01:45:00.405
ARGUMENT WERE HAVING THESE 
COMPRESSED OPENING ARGUMENTS IS 

01:45:00.542 --> 01:45:04.501
BETTER BECAUSE IT MIGHT GIVE 
THEM MORE TIME TO GET THAT NEW 

01:45:04.702 --> 01:45:07.551
EVIDENCE AND THE WITNESSES 
BEFORE THEY WOULD WANT TO GET 

01:45:07.754 --> 01:45:11.757
RID OF THE TRIAL AND BE ON TO 
OTHER THINGS. 

01:45:11.758 --> 01:45:16.481
&gt;&gt;  THIS IS THE WEEK AFTER I WAS
SO THERE IS A LOT IN LINE. 

01:45:16.482 --> 01:45:18.482
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW  THEY ARE HAVING

01:45:23.585 --> 01:45:25.833
SURROGATES CAMPAIGNED FOR THEM 
AND THEY ARE TRY TO GET AS MANY 

01:45:26.033 --> 01:45:28.264
AS POSSIBLE. THERE IS A PREMIUM 
ON HAVING SOME KIND OF PRESENCE 

01:45:28.464 --> 01:45:33.947
BECAUSE THE SENATORS WILL BE 
PULLING A LOT OF LATE NIGHTS AND

01:45:34.183 --> 01:45:37.812
THEY WILL BE TIRED AND NOT BE 
ABLE TO DEVOTE MUCH TIME. 

01:45:37.813 --> 01:45:42.482
&gt;&gt; EVEN A PROPOSAL  LIKE THIS IS
GETTING BLOWN UP IF THEY GO 

01:45:42.684 --> 01:45:46.948
UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN
THIS TRIAL PROCESS. 

01:45:46.949 --> 01:45:49.340
&gt;&gt; IT INCREASES THE IMPORTANCE 
OF STAFFING  AND THOSE 

01:45:49.515 --> 01:45:55.191
SURROGATES AND BASICALLY RUNNING
THE STRETCH RUN OF THE CAMPAIGN

01:46:00.362 --> 01:46:02.595
WHEN THE CANDIDATE IS JUST NOT 
ABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE SO 

01:46:02.795 --> 01:46:04.840
CONSUMED WITH THE TRIAL. 
&gt;&gt;  AS OPENING ARGUMENTS DO GET 

01:46:05.591 --> 01:46:10.112
UNDERWAY TOMORROW, WE EXPECT 
THEY WILL GET UNDERWAY TOMORROW,

01:46:10.312 --> 01:46:13.159
THERE IS A REAL QUESTION OF HOW 
REPUBLICANS WILL DEFEND 

01:46:13.921 --> 01:46:18.025
PRESIDENT TRUMP BOTH IN THIS 
COURTROOM SETTING AND TRIAL 

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:20.472
SETTING AS WELL AS OUTSIDE ON 
TELEVISION. WE DO HAVE A SENSE 

01:46:21.234 --> 01:46:27.371
OF THAT BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING 
THESE ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES 

01:46:27.773 --> 01:46:29.607
BUT THE MORE THAT MITCH 
McCONNELL MAKES US ABOUT 

01:46:29.608 --> 01:46:31.639
PROCESS, THE MORE IT PLAYS INTO 
THAT ARGUMENT OF REPUBLICANS OF 

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.291
THE PROCESS IS FLAWED ON THE 
HOUSE SIDE AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE

01:46:35.493 --> 01:46:40.374
NOT DOING A GOOD JOB AND THEY 
KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE DETAILS 

01:46:40.774 --> 01:46:43.221
AND LESS OF WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACTUALLY DID AND WHAT HIS ALLIES

01:46:43.421 --> 01:46:47.231
AND WHAT DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT HIS
ALLIES DID REGARDING THE UKRAINE

01:46:47.393 --> 01:46:50.526
RELATIONSHIP. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK McCONNELL MAKING 

01:46:50.738 --> 01:46:55.004
THOSE ARGUMENTS TODAY , I THINK 
PART OF THAT IS GEARED TOWARDS 

01:46:55.203 --> 01:46:57.964
ARGUING THAT OUR RULES ARE FAIR 
AND MORE FAIR THAN

01:47:04.954 --> 01:47:06.987
THE HOUSES RULE SO IT MAKES 
SENSE TO MAKE ARGUMENTS TODAY 

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:09.421
BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO 
SEE THAT ENDURING INTO THE 

01:47:09.622 --> 01:47:11.622
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS MAKING THE 
CASE ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND 

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:14.289
MAKING THIS ABOUT THE IDEA THAT 
THE HOUSES INQUIRY WAS 

01:47:14.704 --> 01:47:16.536
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. THAT WAS 
THE ARGUMENT OF CHOICE DURING 

01:47:16.537 --> 01:47:19.284
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
AND THEY WILL HAVE A LOT OF TIME

01:47:22.009 --> 01:47:24.454
TO FILL AND THEY WILL NOT WANT 
TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN WHAT 

01:47:24.656 --> 01:47:28.519
GORDON SOLOMON SAID OR THINGS 
LIKE THAT. IT IS MUCH MORE 

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.720
FRIENDLY FOR THEM TO TALK ABOUT 
PROCESS

01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:38.473
AND THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU 
WILL SEE THEM TALK ABOUT IS WHAT

01:47:38.671 --> 01:47:40.502
IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD 
FOR IMPEACHMENT? WE SAW THAT 

01:47:40.503 --> 01:47:42.938
PROMINENTLY IN THIS MEMO OF THE 
IDEA OF EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, 

01:47:43.138 --> 01:47:46.388
THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL 
PREROGATIVE TO IMPEACH SOMEONE 

01:47:46.788 --> 01:47:50.709
AND I THINK WE WILL SEE A LOT OF
THAT AND NOT A WHOLE LOT OF IS 

01:47:50.871 --> 01:47:52.871
WHAT GORDON ZONE SAYING ACTUALLY
ACCURATE

01:48:00.805 --> 01:48:03.250
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN? THE MORE 
THEY GET INTO THOSE DEBTS, THE 

01:48:03.451 --> 01:48:05.684
MORE THEY LEND CREDENCE TO THE 
IDEA THAT THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL 

01:48:05.884 --> 01:48:08.117
CASE AND MAYBE WE NEED NEW 
EVIDENCE FOR THE TRIAL TO MOVE 

01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:09.546
FORWARD. 
&gt;&gt; WE HEARD SENATOR CHUCK 

01:48:09.547 --> 01:48:11.164
SCHUMER JUST DEFEND  JOURNALISM 
AND JOURNALISTS BECAUSE 

01:48:11.165 --> 01:48:13.814
DEMOCRATS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 
HOW THIS IS BEEN LAID OUT TO 

01:48:14.577 --> 01:48:18.279
CONFINE REPORTERS AND CUT OFF 
ACCESS AND THE WAY THEY USUALLY 

01:48:18.882 --> 01:48:21.097
HAVE THEM AND OF COURSE IT IS 
ALWAYS GREAT

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:26.580
WHEN JOURNALISM IS DEFENDED BUT 
DEMOCRATS HAVE A REAL AGENDA 

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.681
HERE AS WELL. WE DID HEAR HIM 
TALK ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THE 

01:48:31.881 --> 01:48:34.117
REPORTERS THAT ARE IN THE 
CHAMBER THAT HAVE TO GET OUT TO 

01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:37.236
FILE STORIES AND THEN THEY HAVE 
TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK IN 

01:48:37.408 --> 01:48:39.408
THROUGH SCREENING SO WE DO SEE

01:48:47.730 --> 01:48:49.964
THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS TAKEN HIS 
SEAT SO LET'S LISTEN INTO THE 

01:48:50.164 --> 01:48:51.995
SENATE FLOOR. 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT IN

01:48:51.996 --> 01:48:54.030
ALL THINGS PERTAINING TO THE 
TRIAL OF THE IMPEACHMENT OF  

01:48:54.231 --> 01:48:56.231
DONALD DON TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES NOW PENDING, 

01:48:56.264 --> 01:48:58.264
YOU WILL DO IMPARTIAL JUSTICE 
ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION 

01:48:58.648 --> 01:49:02.148
AND LAWS,  SO HELP YOU GONE? 
&gt;&gt; I DO. 

01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:05.397
&gt;&gt; THE SECRETARY  WILL KNOW THE 
NAME OF THE SENDER THAT HAS JUST

01:49:05.612 --> 01:49:08.428
TAKEN THE OATH AND WILL PRESENT 
THE OATH TO HIM FOR SIGNATURE.

01:49:21.045 --> 01:49:23.045
THE SERGEANT IN ARMS WILL MAKE 
THE PROCLAMATION.

01:49:32.965 --> 01:49:34.965
&gt;&gt; 

01:49:36.946 --> 01:49:41.759
HERE YE, HERE YE, HERE YE, ALL 
PERSONS ARE COMMITTED TO REMAIN 

01:49:42.723 --> 01:49:44.723

THIS IS AGAINST ALL JOHN TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

RECOGNIZED.

01:56:42.834 --> 01:56:44.834
&gt;&gt; CENTERS ARE IN OPPOSITION. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:50.750
ARE YOU A PROPONENT OR OPPONENT 
OF THE MOTION? 

01:56:50.751 --> 01:56:52.582
&gt;&gt; WE ARE A PROPONENT  OF THE 
MOTION. 

01:56:52.583 --> 01:56:57.452
&gt;&gt;  YOUR SIDE MAY PROCEED FIRST 
AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESERVE 

01:56:57.652 --> 01:56:59.652
FOR REBUTTAL TIME IF YOU WISH.

01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:10.197
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. 
MAJORITY LEADER McCONNELL AND 

01:57:10.369 --> 01:57:17.367
LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER  AND 
SENATORS, MY NAME IS PAT AND I'M

01:57:17.568 --> 01:57:23.052
HERE AS COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES. OUR TEAM 

01:57:23.252 --> 01:57:25.845
IS PROUD TO BE HERE REPRESENTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE SUPPORT THIS

01:57:26.013 --> 01:57:33.403
RESOLUTION. IT IS A FAIR WAY TO 
PROCEED WITH THIS TRIAL. IT IS 

01:57:33.604 --> 01:57:36.653
MODELED ON THE CLINTON 
RESOLUTION WHICH HAD 100 

01:57:36.853 --> 01:57:41.479
SENATORS SUPPORTING IT THE LAST 
TIME THIS BODY CONSIDERED 

01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:47.519
IMPEACHMENT. IT REQUIRES THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS TO STAND UP

01:57:51.483 --> 01:57:56.367
AND MAKE THEIR OPENING STATEMENT
AND MAKE THEIR CASE. THEY HAVE 

01:57:56.567 --> 01:57:58.937
DELAYED BRINGING THIS 
IMPEACHMENT TO THIS HOUSE FOR 33

01:57:59.099 --> 01:58:05.639
DAYS. 33 DAYS TO THIS BODY AND 
IT IS TIME TO START WITH THIS 

01:58:05.804 --> 01:58:14.235
TRIAL. IT IS A FAIR PROCESS. 
THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 

01:58:14.637 --> 01:58:16.870
TO STAND UP AND MAKE OPENING 
STATEMENTS AND THEY WILL GET 24 

01:58:17.085 --> 01:58:23.169
HOURS TO DO THAT. THEN, THE 
PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEYS WILL HAVE 

01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:26.580
A CHANCE TO RESPOND AND AFTER 
THAT, ALL OF YOU WILL HAVE 16 

01:58:26.739 --> 01:58:32.319
HOURS TO ASK WHATEVER QUESTIONS 
YOU HAVE OF EITHER SIDE. ONCE 

01:58:32.519 --> 01:58:35.354
THAT IS FINISHED AND YOU HAVE 
ALL THAT INFORMATION, WE WILL 

01:58:35.569 --> 01:58:39.622
PROCEED TO THE QUESTION OF 
WITNESSES AND SOME OF THE MORE 

01:58:39.824 --> 01:58:44.504
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS THAT WILL 
COME BEFORE THIS BODY. WE ARE IN

01:58:44.704 --> 01:58:46.853
FAVOR OF THIS AND WE BELIEVE

01:58:51.202 --> 01:58:53.236
THAT ONCE YOU HEAR THOSE INITIAL
PRESENTATIONS, THE ONLY 

01:58:53.437 --> 01:58:56.887
CONCLUSION WILL BE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY 

01:58:57.642 --> 01:59:02.986
NOTHING WRONG. THESE ARTICLES OF
IMPEACHMENT DO NOT BEGIN TO 

01:59:03.185 --> 01:59:08.069
APPROACH THE STANDARD REQUIRED 
BY THE CONSTITUTION AND THE FACT

01:59:08.268 --> 01:59:12.277
THAT THEY THEMSELVES WILL 
ESTABLISH NOTHING BEYOND THOSE 

01:59:12.446 --> 01:59:14.446
ARTICLES.

01:59:17.405 --> 01:59:19.438
YOU WILL LOOK AT THOSE ARTICLES 
ALONE AND DETERMINED THAT THERE 

01:59:19.638 --> 01:59:23.034
IS ABSOLUTELY NO CASE. WE 
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO ADOPT

01:59:27.354 --> 01:59:29.587
THIS RESOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN 
BEGIN WITH THIS PROCESS. IT IS 

01:59:29.802 --> 01:59:31.802
LONG PAST TIME

01:59:37.318 --> 01:59:39.952
TO START THIS PROCEEDING AND WE 
ARE HERE TODAY TO DO IT AND WE 

01:59:40.153 --> 01:59:42.185
HOPE THAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
WILL AGREE WITH US AND BEGIN 

01:59:42.384 --> 01:59:44.618
THIS PROCEEDING TODAY. WE 
RESERVE THE REMAINDER OF OUR 

01:59:44.832 --> 01:59:46.832
TIME FOR REBUTTAL.

01:59:58.233 --> 02:00:03.518
&gt;&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE AND 
SENATORS  AND COUNSEL FOR THE 

02:00:03.717 --> 02:00:06.114
PRESIDENT AND HOUSE MANAGERS ON 
BEHALF OF THE HOUSE OF 

02:00:06.283 --> 02:00:08.283
REPRESENTATIVES RISE IN 
OPPOSITION TO LEADER McCONNELL'S

02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:13.066
RESOLUTION. LET ME BEGIN BY 
SUMMARIZING WHY. LAST WEEK WE 

02:00:13.828 --> 02:00:19.569
CAME BEFORE YOU TO PRESENT 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST 

02:00:19.769 --> 02:00:21.800
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES FOR ONLY THE THIRD TIME 

02:00:22.001 --> 02:00:24.248
IN OUR HISTORY. THOSE ARTICLES 
CHARGE PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN 

02:00:24.997 --> 02:00:26.997
TRUMP WAS

02:00:29.104 --> 02:00:30.935
OBJECTION OF CONGRESS AND THE 
MISCONDUCT SET OUT THOSE 

02:00:30.936 --> 02:00:32.936
ARTICLES IS THE MOST SERIOUS 
EVER CHARGED AGAINST THE 

02:00:32.969 --> 02:00:38.053
PRESIDENT. THE FIRST ARTICLE 
ABUSE OF POWER CHARGES THE 

02:00:38.251 --> 02:00:40.721
PRESIDENT WAS SOLICITING A 
FOREIGN POWER TO HELP HIM CHEAT 

02:00:40.892 --> 02:00:45.968
IN THE NEXT ELECTION. MOREOVER, 
IT ALLEGES THAT WE WILL PROVE 

02:00:46.170 --> 02:00:48.403
THAT HE SOUGHT TO COERCE UKRAINE
AND TO HELP BY WITHHOLDING 

02:00:49.154 --> 02:00:54.087
OFFICIAL ACTS, TWO OFFICIAL 
ACTS. A MEETING THAT THE NEW 

02:00:54.301 --> 02:00:56.641
PRESIDENT DESPERATELY SOUGHT AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE

02:01:01.402 --> 02:01:03.402
TO SHOW THE WORLD AND THE 
RUSSIANS THAT THE UKRAINIAN 

02:01:03.436 --> 02:01:05.436
PRESIDENT HAD A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOST 

02:01:05.630 --> 02:01:09.934
IMPORTANT PATRON, THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. EVEN MORE,

02:01:10.698 --> 02:01:15.574
PRESIDENT TRUMP LEGALLY WITHHELD
ALMOST $400 MILLION IN TAXPAYER 

02:01:15.734 --> 02:01:17.734
FUNDS

02:01:19.683 --> 02:01:24.565
AND A NATION AT WAR WITH OUR 
RUSSIAN ADVERSARIES TO COMPEL 

02:01:24.764 --> 02:01:27.612
UKRAINE TO HELP HIM CHEAT IN THE
ELECTIONS. ASTONISHINGLY, THE 

02:01:27.814 --> 02:01:32.482
PRESENT TRIAL BRIEF FILED 
YESTERDAY CONTENDS THAT EVEN IF 

02:01:32.682 --> 02:01:36.147
THIS CONDUCT IS PROVED THAT 
THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE HOUSE 

02:01:36.549 --> 02:01:38.549
OR THE SENATE MAY DO ABOUT IT.

02:01:41.831 --> 02:01:44.063
IT IS THE APPARENT BELIEF THAT 
UNDER ARTICLE 2 HE CAN DO 

02:01:44.264 --> 02:01:49.893
ANYTHING HE WANTS NO MATTER HOW 
CORRUPT OUTFITTED IN GAUDY 

02:01:50.062 --> 02:01:52.062
CLOTHING.

02:01:55.642 --> 02:01:57.642
YET, WHEN THE FOUNDERS WROTE THE
IMPEACHMENT CLAUSE, THEY HAD 

02:01:57.672 --> 02:02:00.105
PRECISELY THIS TYPE OF 
MISCONDUCT IN MIND. CONDUCT THAT

02:02:00.307 --> 02:02:02.952
ABUSES THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE 
FOR PERSONAL BENEFIT THAT 

02:02:03.154 --> 02:02:07.421
UNDERMINES OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
AND INVITES FOREIGN INTERFERENCE

02:02:07.621 --> 02:02:13.041
IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. IT IS
THE TRIFECTA OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

02:02:13.213 --> 02:02:17.543
MISCONDUCT JUSTIFYING 
IMPEACHMENT. IN ARTICLE TWO, THE

02:02:23.468 --> 02:02:25.468
PRESIDENT IS CHARGED WITH OTHER 
MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD ALARM THE 

02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:27.500
FOUNDERS. THE FULL AND COMPLETE 
AN ABSOLUTE OBSTRUCTION OF A 

02:02:27.533 --> 02:02:32.403
COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE 

02:02:32.603 --> 02:02:36.067
IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION INTO 
THE PRESIDENT ON MISCONDUCT, 

02:02:36.269 --> 02:02:39.517
THIS IS EVERY BIT AS DESTRUCTIVE
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AS 

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:41.719
THE MISCONDUCT CHARGE IN THE 
FIRST ARTICLE.

02:02:50.896 --> 02:02:52.715
IF A PRESIDENT CAN OBSTRUCT HIS 
OWN INVESTIGATION AND 

02:02:52.716 --> 02:02:54.544
EFFECTIVELY NOTIFY A POWER, THE 
CONSTITUTION GIVES SOLELY TO 

02:02:54.545 --> 02:02:56.578
CONGRESS AND INDEED THE ULTIMATE
POWER, THE ULTIMATE POWER IS TO 

02:02:56.779 --> 02:03:01.045
PREVENT PRESIDENTIAL MISCONDUCT 
AND THE PRESENT PLACES HIMSELF 

02:03:01.245 --> 02:03:04.454
BEYOND ACCOUNTABILITY OR ABOVE 
THE LAW. CANNOT BE INDICTED OR 

02:03:04.633 --> 02:03:10.188
IMPEACHED. IT MAKES HIM A 
MONARCH. THE VERY EVIL AGAINST 

02:03:10.389 --> 02:03:12.521
WHICH OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE 
BALANCE OF POWERS WAS

02:03:16.284 --> 02:03:17.902
DESIGNED TO GUARD AGAINST. 
SHORTLY, THE DISCHARGES WILL 

02:03:17.903 --> 02:03:19.903
BEGIN AND WHEN IT HAS

02:03:23.802 --> 02:03:25.802
CONCLUDED, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO 
MAKE SEVERAL DETERMINATIONS. DID

02:03:25.835 --> 02:03:30.100
THE HOUSE PROOF THAT THE 
PRESIDENT ABUSE HIS POWER TO 

02:03:30.299 --> 02:03:36.799
HELP HIM CHEAT IN THE NEXT 
ELECTION ENDED HE OBSTRUCT IN 

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS OWN

02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:46.947
MISCONDUCT BY ORDERING HIS 
AGENCIES AND OFFICERS TO REFUSE 

02:03:47.364 --> 02:03:51.737
TO COOPERATE IN ANY WAY WITH ANY
OTHER MEANS.

02:03:55.477 --> 02:04:01.578
IF THE HOUSE HAS PROVED ITS CASE
, YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER AT 

02:04:01.779 --> 02:04:06.810
LEAST ONE CRITICAL QUESTION. 
DOES THESE HIGH CRIMES AND 

02:04:06.981 --> 02:04:10.871
MISDEMEANORS REQUIRED THE 
CONVICTION AND REMOVAL OF THE 

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:14.978
PRESIDENT? WE BELIEVE IT DOES 
AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION 

02:04:15.193 --> 02:04:18.845
REQUIRES THAT IT BE SO OR THE 
POWER OF IMPEACHMENT MUST BE 

02:04:19.247 --> 02:04:23.227
DEEMED A CASUALTY AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE LEFT

02:04:27.977 --> 02:04:29.977
UNPROTECTED WOULD ABUSE HIS 
POWER FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF 

02:04:30.010 --> 02:04:32.804
CORRUPTING THE ONLY OTHER METHOD
OF ACCOUNTABILITY, OUR ELECTIONS

02:04:32.973 --> 02:04:37.526
THEMSELVES. SO, YOU WILL VOTE TO
FIND THE PRESIDENT GUILTY OR NOT

02:04:37.739 --> 02:04:42.810
GUILTY. TO FIND HIS CONDUCT 
IMPEACHABLE OR NOT IMPEACHABLE. 

02:04:43.225 --> 02:04:49.094
I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THESE
ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT 

02:04:49.267 --> 02:04:54.191
DECISIONS YOU WILL MAKE. HOW CAN
THAT BE? HOW CAN ANY DECISION 

02:04:54.391 --> 02:04:56.391
YOU WILL MAKE BE MORE IMPORTANT

02:05:02.308 --> 02:05:04.308
IN REMOVING THE PRESIDENT OR NOT
REMOVING THE PRESIDENT? I 

02:05:04.344 --> 02:05:07.993
BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
DECISION IN THIS CASE IS THE ONE

02:05:08.207 --> 02:05:10.227
YOU WILL MAKE TODAY, THE MOST 
IMPORTANT QUESTION IS THE ONE 

02:05:10.443 --> 02:05:12.443
YOU MUST ANSWER TODAY, WHILE THE
PRESIDENT AND THE AMERICAN 

02:05:12.474 --> 02:05:15.838
PEOPLE GET A FAIR TRIAL? WILL 
THERE BE

02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:24.243
A FAIR TRIAL? I SUBMIT THAT THIS
IS AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 

02:05:24.456 --> 02:05:26.456
QUESTION THAN HOW YOU VOTE ON 
GUILT OR INNOCENCE BECAUSE 

02:05:26.478 --> 02:05:28.510
WHETHER WE HAVE A FAIR TRIAL 
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER YOU HAVE 

02:05:28.725 --> 02:05:34.351
A BASIS TO RENDER A FAIR AND 
IMPARTIAL VERDICT. IT IS 

02:05:34.525 --> 02:05:39.174
FOUNDATIONAL AND THIS IS THE 
STRUCTURE WHAT OTHER

02:05:42.727 --> 02:05:45.175
DECISIONS WILL REST. IF YOU ONLY
SEE PART OF THE EVIDENCE OR ONLY

02:05:45.376 --> 02:05:47.610
ALLOW ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER A 
CHANCE TO PRESENT THEIR FULL 

02:05:47.812 --> 02:05:52.278
CASE, YOUR VERDICT WILL BE 
PREDETERMINED BY THE BIAS AND 

02:05:52.479 --> 02:05:54.839
THE PROCEEDING. IF THE DEFENDANT
IS NOT ALLOWED TO INTRODUCE

02:06:03.244 --> 02:06:05.276
EVIDENCE, THAT IS NOT A FAIR 
TRIAL AND SO FOR THE 

02:06:05.490 --> 02:06:07.306
PROSECUTION. IF THE HOUSE CANNOT
CALL WITNESSES OR INTEREST 

02:06:07.307 --> 02:06:09.553
DOCUMENTS OR EVIDENCE, THAT IS 
NOT FAIR TRIAL. IT IS NOT REALLY

02:06:09.751 --> 02:06:11.985
A TRIAL AT ALL. AMERICANS ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY ARE WATCHING US

02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:14.750
RIGHT NOW.

02:06:16.855 --> 02:06:19.213
IMAGINE THEIR OWN JURY DUTY. 
IMAGINE THAT THE JUDGE WANTS

02:06:25.387 --> 02:06:27.823
TO WALK INTO THE COURTROOM AND 
SAYS SHE HAS BEEN TALKING TO THE

02:06:28.036 --> 02:06:30.270
DEFENDANT AND AT THE REQUEST, 
THE JUDGE HAS AGREED NOT TO LET 

02:06:30.471 --> 02:06:34.125
THE PROSECUTION CALL ANY 
WITNESSES. OR INTRODUCE ANY 

02:06:34.323 --> 02:06:36.559
DOCUMENTS. THE JUDGE AND THE 
DEFENDANT HAVE AGREED THAT THE 

02:06:36.759 --> 02:06:41.440
PROSECUTOR MAY ONLY READ TO THE 
JURY THE DRIED TRANSCRIPT OF THE

02:06:41.642 --> 02:06:47.939
JURY PROCEEDINGS AND THAT IS IT.
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD A JUDGE 

02:06:48.341 --> 02:06:54.024
DESCRIBE SUCH A PROCEEDING AND 
CALL THAT A FAIR TRIAL? OF 

02:06:54.774 --> 02:06:59.307
COURSE NOT. THAT IS NOT A FAIR 
TRIAL. IT IS A MOCKERY OF A 

02:06:59.521 --> 02:07:02.155
TRIAL. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, 
THIS PROCEEDING AND THE ONE WE 

02:07:02.357 --> 02:07:04.357
ARE IN RIGHT NOW

02:07:07.037 --> 02:07:09.470
IS THE TRIAL. THIS IS NOT AN 
APPEAL AND YOU ARE NOT AN 

02:07:09.671 --> 02:07:12.020
APPELLATE COURT JUDGE. OKAY, ONE
OF YOU IS.

02:07:16.573 --> 02:07:18.405
UNLESS THIS TRIAL WILL BE 
DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER 

02:07:18.406 --> 02:07:21.044
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OR ANY KIND OF
TRIAL FOR THAT MATTER, YOU MUST 

02:07:21.243 --> 02:07:24.494
ALLOW THE PROSECUTION AND 
DEFENSE OF THE HOUSE MANAGER AND

02:07:24.706 --> 02:07:29.286
THE LAWYERS TO CALL RELEVANT 
WITNESSES.

02:07:34.253 --> 02:07:38.867
YOU MUST IMPARTIALLY DO JUSTICE

02:07:42.785 --> 02:07:45.218
AS YOUR OATH REQUIRES SO WHAT 
DOES A FAIR TRIAL LOOK LIKE IN 

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:48.669
THE CONTEXT OF IMPEACHMENT? THE 
SHORT ANSWER IS IT LOOKS LIKE 

02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:52.813
EVERY OTHER TRIAL. THEY SHOULD 
ALLOW THE HOUSE MANAGERS TO 

02:07:52.987 --> 02:07:58.218
OBTAIN DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
WITHHELD. FIRST, NOT LAST 

02:07:58.417 --> 02:08:00.852
BECAUSE DOCUMENTS WILL INFORM 
THE DECISION ABOUT WHICH ARE 

02:08:01.602 --> 02:08:07.567
MOST IMPORTANT TO CALL AND WHEN 
IT IS CALLED, THE EVIDENCE WILL 

02:08:07.767 --> 02:08:12.635
BE AVAILABLE AND MUST BE 
AVAILABLE TO QUESTION THEM WITH.

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:16.704
ANY OTHER ORDER MAKES NO SENSE. 
NEXT, THEY SHOULD ALLOW TO CALL 

02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:21.166
WITNESSES AND THEN THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THE SAME

02:08:21.368 --> 02:08:25.795
IN ANY REBUTTAL WITNESSES AND 
WHEN THE TRIAL ENDS, THE PARTIES

02:08:25.955 --> 02:08:27.955
ARGUE

02:08:31.332 --> 02:08:33.568
THE CASE. YOU DELIVERY AND 
RENDER A VERDICT. IF THERE IS A 

02:08:33.768 --> 02:08:36.759
DISPUTE TO WHETHER SOMETHING IS 
RELEVANT OR MATERIAL, THE CHIEF 

02:08:36.928 --> 02:08:38.928
JUSTICE

02:08:41.082 --> 02:08:44.331
WOULD RULE ON THE ISSUE OF 
MATERIAL ARTIE. WHY SHOULD THIS 

02:08:44.733 --> 02:08:47.323
BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER 
TRIAL? THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT 

02:08:47.490 --> 02:08:49.490
SHOULDN'T.

02:08:56.314 --> 02:08:58.145
LEADER McCONNELL'S RESOLUTION 
WOULD TURN THE TRIAL PROCESS ON 

02:08:58.146 --> 02:09:00.146
ITS HEAD.'S RESOLUTION REQUIRES 
THE HOUSE TO PROVE ITS CASE 

02:09:00.177 --> 02:09:02.197
WITHOUT WITNESSES OR DOCUMENTS 
AND ONLY AFTER IT IS DONE WHILE 

02:09:02.410 --> 02:09:04.587
SUCH QUESTIONS BE ENTERTAINED 
WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY 

02:09:04.753 --> 02:09:09.512
WITNESSES OR ANY DOCUMENTS WILL 
BE ALLOWED EVEN THEN. THAT 

02:09:09.712 --> 02:09:14.592
PROCESS MAKES NO SENSE. WHAT IS 
THE HARM OF WAITING UNTIL THE 

02:09:14.794 --> 02:09:18.858
END OF THE TRIAL AND OF KICKING 
THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD ON THE 

02:09:19.059 --> 02:09:22.109
QUESTION OF DOCUMENTS AND 
WITNESSES? ASSIGNS THE FACT THAT

02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:27.388
IT IS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS AND 
THE FACT THAT THE DOCUMENTS 

02:09:27.588 --> 02:09:29.768
WOULD INFORM THE DECISION ON 
WHICH WITNESSES AND OPEN 

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:31.928
QUESTIONING, THE HARM IS THIS.

02:09:34.902 --> 02:09:36.935
YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY OF THE 
EVIDENCE THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES

02:09:37.135 --> 02:09:41.602
TO CONCEAL THROUGHOUT MOST OR 
ALL OF THE TRIAL. ALTHOUGH THE 

02:09:41.817 --> 02:09:44.251
EVIDENCE AGAINST THE PRESENT IS 
ALREADY OVERWHELMING, YOU MAY 

02:09:44.455 --> 02:09:49.119
NEVER KNOW THE FULL SCOPE OF THE
PRESENCE MISCONDUCT OR THOSE 

02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:55.819
AROUND HIM. NEITHER WILL THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE CHARGES 

02:09:56.235 --> 02:09:58.835
INVOLVE THE SACRIFICE OF OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY AT HOME AND 

02:09:59.081 --> 02:10:05.583
ABROAD AND A THREAT TO THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE NEXT ELECTION. 

02:10:05.984 --> 02:10:08.218
IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REMEDIAL
STEPS I NEED TO BE TAKEN AFTER 

02:10:08.418 --> 02:10:10.989
THE CONVICTION, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE MUST KNOW ABOUT IT.

02:10:16.751 --> 02:10:19.542
IF AS THE PUBLIC ALREADY JADED 
BY EXPERIENCE HAS COME TO SIX 

02:10:19.774 --> 02:10:22.370
BACKED THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS 
REALLY THE FIRST STEP OF AN 

02:10:22.531 --> 02:10:28.532
EFFORT CASTRATED BY THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO REST THE TRIAL AND HIDE

02:10:28.733 --> 02:10:30.766
THE EVIDENCE AND RENDER A FAST 
VERDICT OR WORSE A FAST 

02:10:30.966 --> 02:10:33.981
DISMISSAL, TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO 

02:10:34.144 --> 02:10:36.650
COVER UP MISDEEDS, THAN THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE DEPRIVED

02:10:36.863 --> 02:10:41.944
OF A FAIR TRIAL AND NEVER LEARN 
HOW DEEP THE CORRUPTION GOES OR 

02:10:42.143 --> 02:10:44.495
WHAT OTHER RISK TO OUR SECURITY 
AND ELECTIONS REMAIN HIDDEN.

02:10:48.031 --> 02:10:53.113
THE HARM WILL ALSO INDOOR FOR 
THIS BONNIE AND IF THEY ALLOW 

02:10:53.314 --> 02:10:55.314
THE PRESIDENT TO GET AWAY WITH 
SUCH

02:10:58.595 --> 02:11:00.425
EXTENSIVE OBSTRUCTION, IT WILL 
AFFECT THE SENATE POWER OF 

02:11:00.426 --> 02:11:04.277
SUBPOENA AND OVERSIGHT JUST AS 
MUCH AS THE HOUSE. THE SENATE'S 

02:11:04.477 --> 02:11:08.342
ABILITY TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT 
WILL BE TO THE DESIRES OF THIS 

02:11:08.541 --> 02:11:10.776
PRESIDENT AND FUTURE PRESIDENTS 
WHETHER HE OR SHE DECIDES THEY 

02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:14.172
WANT TO COOPERATE WITH AN 
INVESTIGATION OR ANOTHER 

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:16.333
IMPEACHMENT

02:11:18.507 --> 02:11:22.770
INQUIRY AND TRIAL. OUR SYSTEM OF
CHECKS AND BALANCES WILL BE 

02:11:22.997 --> 02:11:25.003
BROKEN AND PRESIDENTS WILL 
BECOME ACCOUNTABLE TO NO ONE. IT

02:11:25.763 --> 02:11:31.090
HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT McCONNELL
ALREADY HAS THE VOTES TO PASS 

02:11:31.852 --> 02:11:35.768
THIS RESOLUTION. WE DID NOT SEE 
THAT UNTIL LAST NIGHT AND HAS 

02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:40.367
BEEN CHANGED EVEN AS OF MOMENTS 
AGO. THEY SAY THAT LEADER 

02:11:40.549 --> 02:11:46.534
McCONNELL IS A GOOD VOTE 
COUNTER. NONETHELESS, I HOPE HE 

02:11:47.288 --> 02:11:54.651
IS WRONG. NOT JUST BECAUSE I 
THINK THIS PROCESS IS BACKWARDS 

02:11:54.866 --> 02:11:59.120
AND DESIGNED WITH THE RESULT IN 
MIND AND THAT THE RESULT IS NOT 

02:11:59.333 --> 02:12:03.186
A FAIR TRIAL BUT I HOPE HE IS 
WRONG BECAUSE WHATEVER SENATORS 

02:12:03.386 --> 02:12:08.268
MAY HAVE SAID OR PLEDGED OR 
COMMITTED HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY

02:12:08.469 --> 02:12:12.081
AN EVENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
DIMENSION. YOU HAVE ALL NOW 

02:12:12.288 --> 02:12:19.789
SWORN AN OATH. NOT TO EACH OTHER
AND NOT TO THE LEGISLATIVE 

02:12:19.953 --> 02:12:22.886
LEADERSHIP AND NOT TO THE 
MANAGERS OR EVEN THE CHIEF 

02:12:23.098 --> 02:12:31.216
JUSTICE. YOU HAVE SWORN AN OATH 
TO DO IMPARTIAL JUSTICE. THAT 

02:12:31.418 --> 02:12:37.056
OATH BINDS YOU. IT SUPERSEDES 
ALL ELSE. MANY OF YOU IN THE 

02:12:37.227 --> 02:12:41.778
SENATE AND MANY OF US IN THE 
HOUSE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS ABOUT

02:12:41.979 --> 02:12:47.010
THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT. THIS 
TRIAL OR THIS MOTION OR 

02:12:47.204 --> 02:12:51.884
EXPECTATIONS BUT NONE OF THAT 
MATTERS NOW. THAT IS ALL IN THE 

02:12:52.058 --> 02:12:57.984
PAST AND NOTHING MATTERS NOW BUT
THE OATH TO DO IMPARTIAL 

02:12:58.158 --> 02:13:03.257
JUSTICE. THAT OATH REQUIRES A 
FAIR TRIAL. FAIR TO THE 

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.357
PRESIDENT AND FAIR TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. IS THAT REALLY 

02:13:09.527 --> 02:13:16.923
POSSIBLE? OR IS THE FOUNDERS 
FEAR AS EXCESSIVE PARTISANSHIP 

02:13:17.124 --> 02:13:19.124
TO MAKE THAT NOW IMPOSSIBLE?

02:13:22.806 --> 02:13:25.452
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT A FAIR 
TRIAL SHOULD LOOK LIKE DEVOID OF

02:13:25.653 --> 02:13:27.483
PARTISAN CONSIDERATION IS TO ASK
YOURSELVES HOW WOULD YOU 

02:13:27.484 --> 02:13:32.971
STRUCTURE THE TRIAL IF YOU 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PARTY WAS 

02:13:33.371 --> 02:13:35.400
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE 
PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT WAS? 

02:13:35.601 --> 02:13:38.650
WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU TO 
PUT THAT TRIAL FIRST AND THEN 

02:13:38.863 --> 02:13:40.884
DECIDE ON WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE
LATER? WOULD THAT BE FAIR TO 

02:13:41.635 --> 02:13:47.599
BOTH SIDES? I HAVE TO THINK THAT
YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE NO. LET ME 

02:13:48.359 --> 02:13:51.164
BE BLUNT. LET ME BE VERY BLUNT.

02:13:55.113 --> 02:13:57.145
RIGHT NOW, A GREAT MANY AND 
PERHAPS MAYBE MOST AMERICANS DO 

02:13:57.347 --> 02:14:00.998
NOT BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A FAIR
TRIAL. THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE 

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:06.079
SENATE WILL BE IMPARTIAL. THEY 
BELIEVE THE RESULT IS PRECOOKED.

02:14:06.281 --> 02:14:11.963
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ACQUITTED.
NOT BECAUSE HE IS INNOCENT. HE 

02:14:12.731 --> 02:14:19.276
IS NOT. BUT BECAUSE THE SENATORS
WILL VOTE BY PARTY AND HE HAS 

02:14:19.477 --> 02:14:23.142
THE VOTES TO PREVENT THE 
EVIDENCE FROM COMING OUT AND TO 

02:14:23.344 --> 02:14:28.425
MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC NEVER SEES 
IT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT A 

02:14:29.181 --> 02:14:35.124
FAIR TRIAL. THEY WANT TO BELIEVE
THEIR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS 

02:14:35.325 --> 02:14:37.325
STILL CAPABLE OF RISING TO THE 
OCCASION.

02:14:41.624 --> 02:14:44.260
THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN
RISE ABOVE PARTY AND DO WHAT IS 

02:14:44.474 --> 02:14:46.714
BEST FOR THE COUNTRY BUT A GREAT
MANY AMERICANS DON'T BELIEVE IT 

02:14:46.909 --> 02:14:53.608
WILL HAPPEN. LET'S PROVE THEM 
WRONG. LET'S PROVE THEM WRONG. 

02:14:54.010 --> 02:14:58.238
HOW? BY CONVICTING THE 
PRESIDENT? NO, NOT BY CONVICTION

02:14:58.416 --> 02:15:04.578
ALONE. BY CONVICTING HIM IF THE 
HOUSE PROVES ITS CASE AND ONLY 

02:15:04.778 --> 02:15:09.179
IF THE HOUSE PROVES ITS CASE BUT
BY LETTING THE HOUSE PROVE ITS 

02:15:09.346 --> 02:15:11.346
CASE.

02:15:13.724 --> 02:15:15.724
BY LETTING THE HOUSE CALL 
WITNESSES AND LETTING THE HOUSE 

02:15:15.742 --> 02:15:17.742
OBTAINING DOCUMENTS AND LETTING 
THE HOUSE DECIDE HOW TO PRESENT 

02:15:17.775 --> 02:15:24.434
ITS OWN CASE AND NOT DECIDING IT
FOR US. BY AGREEING TO A FAIR 

02:15:24.597 --> 02:15:29.064
TRIAL. NOW, LET'S TURN TO THE 
PRECISE

02:15:34.843 --> 02:15:36.672
TERMS OF THE RESOLUTION AND 
HISTORY OF IMPEACHMENT TRIALS 

02:15:36.673 --> 02:15:38.673
AND WHAT FAIRNESS AND 
IMPARTIALITY REQUIRES.

02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:46.190
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE RESOLUTION, I WILL 

02:15:46.221 --> 02:15:51.705
BEGIN WITH THE SINGLE BIGGEST 
FLAW. THE RESOLUTION DOES NOT 

02:15:51.907 --> 02:15:53.940
ENSURE THAT SUBPOENAS WILL IN 
FACT BE ISSUED FOR ADDITIONAL 

02:15:54.142 --> 02:15:58.409
EVIDENCE THAT THE SENATE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE AND 

02:15:58.609 --> 02:16:01.206
THAT THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO 
BLOCK AND FREELY DECIDE GUILT OR

02:16:01.370 --> 02:16:05.312
INNOCENCE. MOREOVER, IT 
GUARANTEES THAT SUBPOENAS WILL 

02:16:05.511 --> 02:16:09.326
NOT BE ISSUED NOW WHEN THEY 
WOULD BE MOST VALUABLE TO THE 

02:16:09.487 --> 02:16:12.624
SENATE AND THE PARTIES AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO 

02:16:13.386 --> 02:16:16.364
THE RESOLUTION THE LEADER HAS 
INTRODUCED, THE SENATE RECEIVES 

02:16:16.691 --> 02:16:21.560
FILINGS FROM THE PARTIES AND 
NEXT THEY HEAR LENGTHY 

02:16:21.759 --> 02:16:23.759
PRESENTATIONS FROM THE HOUSE

02:16:26.642 --> 02:16:28.674
AND THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS HAVE
DESCRIBED THIS IN OPENING 

02:16:28.875 --> 02:16:30.875
STATEMENTS BUT LET'S NOT KID 
OURSELVES.

02:16:34.558 --> 02:16:36.390
THAT IS THE TRIAL THAT THEY 
CONTEMPLATE. THE OPENING 

02:16:36.391 --> 02:16:42.276
STATEMENTS ARE THE TRIAL. THEY 
WILL EITHER BE MOST OF THE TRIAL

02:16:42.477 --> 02:16:47.557
OR ALL OF THE TRIAL. IF THE 
SENATE VOTES TO THE PRIVATE SELF

02:16:47.759 --> 02:16:49.793
OF WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS, THE 
OPENING STATEMENT WILL BE THE 

02:16:49.994 --> 02:16:53.856
END OF THE TRIAL TO SAY LET'S 
HAVE OPENING STATEMENTS AND THEN

02:16:54.059 --> 02:16:58.935
WE WILL SEE MEANS OF'S HAVE THE 
TRIAL AND MAYBE WE CAN SLEEP 

02:16:59.138 --> 02:17:03.002
THIS UNDER THE RUG. YOU WILL 
HEAR THE LENGTHY PRESENTATIONS 

02:17:03.202 --> 02:17:07.468
FROM THE HOUSE AND THERE WILL BE
A QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PERIOD AND

02:17:07.668 --> 02:17:13.151
THEN AND ONLY THEN AFTER THE 
TRIAL IS OVER AND AFTER THE 

02:17:13.352 --> 02:17:17.017
BRIEFS HAVE BEEN FILED AND 
ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND 

02:17:17.217 --> 02:17:19.217
CENTERS HAVE ASKED ALL THEIR 
QUESTIONS, ONLY THEN WILL THE 

02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:21.250
SENATE CONSIDER WHETHER TO 
SUBPOENA CRUCIAL DOCUMENTS AND 

02:17:21.636 --> 02:17:24.117
WITNESS TESTIMONY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DESPERATELY TRIED 

02:17:24.868 --> 02:17:26.868
TO CONCEAL.

02:17:29.202 --> 02:17:31.202
DOCUMENTS EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY 
THAT UNLIKE THE CLINTON TRIAL 

02:17:31.236 --> 02:17:33.432
HAVE NOT YET BEEN SEEN OR HEARD.

02:17:37.531 --> 02:17:42.409
IT IS TRUE THAT THE RECORD 
COMPILED IS OVERWHELMING AND 

02:17:42.611 --> 02:17:45.406
THEY ARTIE COMPEL THE COLLECTION
OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE FACE OF 

02:17:45.564 --> 02:17:48.206
UNPRECEDENTED RESISTANCE AND 
THERE IS A POWERFUL CASE

02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:54.360
AND EVIDENCE OF THE HIGH CRIMES 
AND MISDEMEANORS INCLUDES DIRECT

02:17:54.395 --> 02:17:56.571
EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY OF 
OFFICIALS BUT ARE UNWILLING AND 

02:17:56.736 --> 02:17:58.736
UNWITTING IN THIS SCHEME.

02:18:02.313 --> 02:18:04.742
THEY SAW IT FOR WHAT IT WAS AND 
YET THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE 

02:18:04.956 --> 02:18:10.639
RELATIVE THAT CONTINUE AND IT 
WOULD FLUSH OUT THE FULL EXTENT 

02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:14.520
OF THE MISCONDUCT AND THOSE 
AROUND HIM. WE HAVE SEEN THAT 

02:18:14.705 --> 02:18:19.120
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, NEW 
EVIDENCES CONTINUE TO COME TO 

02:18:19.287 --> 02:18:24.856
LIGHT AS A NONPARTISAN 
ACCOUNTABILITY HAS A TERMINAL TO

02:18:25.056 --> 02:18:31.558
HOLD ON MILITARY TO UKRAINE WAS 
ILLEGAL AND BROKE THE LAW. AS 

02:18:31.772 --> 02:18:34.635
JUMBLED AND HAS OFFERED TO 
TESTIFY IN THE TRIAL IS ONE OF 

02:18:34.805 --> 02:18:39.687
THE PRESIDENTS AGENTS AND 
PRODUCE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE 

02:18:39.890 --> 02:18:44.154
THAT CLARIFIES MR. GIULIANI'S 
EVIDENCE AND COOPERATES DR. 

02:18:44.355 --> 02:18:48.620
SOLOMON'S TESTIMONY THAT 
EVERYONE WAS IN THE LOOP. AS 

02:18:48.821 --> 02:18:52.885
DOCUMENTS RELEASED UNDER THE 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION THAT 

02:18:53.085 --> 02:18:55.533
DOCUMENTED THE ALARM THAT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF THE DEFENSE 

02:18:55.934 --> 02:18:59.585
ILLEGALLY WITHHELD MILITARY 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE AND THE LA 

02:18:59.802 --> 02:19:01.802
AT WAR WITH RUSSIA

02:19:05.481 --> 02:19:07.481
WITHOUT EXPLANATION. AS A SENIOR
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET 

02:19:07.516 --> 02:19:10.475
OFFICIAL MICHAEL DUFFY 
INSTRUCTED OFFICIALS ON JULY 25

02:19:14.014 --> 02:19:16.418
, 90 MINUTES AFTER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SPOKE BY PHONE WITH

02:19:20.715 --> 02:19:22.345
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY 
THAT THEY SHOULD PAUSE ALL 

02:19:22.346 --> 02:19:24.346
OBLIGATION OF UKRAINE  MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE UNDER

02:19:27.831 --> 02:19:32.297
ITS PRUDENCE. 90 MINUTES AFTER 
THAT CALL. THEY SAID "GIVEN THE 

02:19:32.498 --> 02:19:36.365
SENSITIVE NATURE OF THE REQUEST,
I APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING THAT 

02:19:36.564 --> 02:19:40.572
INFORMATION CLOSELY HELD TO 
THOSE THAT NEED TO KNOW TO 

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:45.430
EXECUTE THE DIRECTION." THE 
EVIDENCE IS ALREADY MORE THAN

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:50.979
SUFFICIENT BUT THERE IS NO 
RATIONAL BASIS FOR THE SENATE TO

02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:55.244
THE PRIVATE SELF OF ALL RELEVANT
INFORMATION IN MAKING SUCH A 

02:19:55.995 --> 02:19:57.995
CONSEQUENTIAL JUDGMENT.

02:20:01.543 --> 02:20:03.576
MOREOVER AS THE PRESENT ANSWER 
TO HIS SUMMONS AND TRIAL BRIEF 

02:20:03.774 --> 02:20:05.807
MADE CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT NOW 
INTENDS TO CONTEST THE FACT THAT

02:20:06.009 --> 02:20:09.061
THERE WILL BE A FALSE AND 
MISLEADING WAY THAT THE 

02:20:09.261 --> 02:20:11.292
PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT HAVE IT 
BOTH WAYS. HE SHOULD NOT BE 

02:20:11.535 --> 02:20:13.889
PERMITTED TO CLAIM THE FACTS 
UNCOVERED ARE WRONG WHILE ALSO 

02:20:14.058 --> 02:20:18.963
CONCEALING MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE
THAT THEY ARE PRECISELY ON THOSE

02:20:19.131 --> 02:20:23.889
FACTS. IF THE BODY SEEKS 
IMPARTIAL JUSTICE, IT SHOULD 

02:20:24.090 --> 02:20:27.498
ENSURE THAT SUBPOENAS ARE ISSUED
AND ISSUED NOW BEFORE THERE ARE 

02:20:27.664 --> 02:20:31.203
EXTENDED PROCEEDINGS BASED ON 
THE RECORD THAT EVERY PERSON IN 

02:20:31.604 --> 02:20:34.852
THIS ROOM AND EVERY AMERICAN 
WATCHING AT HOME KNOWS DOES NOT 

02:20:35.619 --> 02:20:40.135
INCLUDE DOCUMENTS AND WITNESS 
TESTIMONY THAT IT SHOULD BECAUSE

02:20:40.336 --> 02:20:46.233
THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT ALLOW IT
TO BE SO. COMPLYING WITH THESE 

02:20:46.433 --> 02:20:50.498
SUBPOENAS WOULD NOT IMPOSE A 
BURDEN THAT WAS NARROWLY 

02:20:50.697 --> 02:20:52.697
TAILORED AND TARGETED

02:20:56.184 --> 02:20:58.219
AT THE PRESIDENT HAS CONCEALED. 
THE SENATE DESERVES TO SEE THE 

02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:00.420
DOCUMENTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND 

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:03.087
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. THESE 

02:21:03.837 --> 02:21:06.495
AGENCIES ALREADY SHOULD HAVE 
COLLECTED AND PRESERVED THESE 

02:21:06.727 --> 02:21:08.727
DOCUMENTS

02:21:11.621 --> 02:21:13.621
IN RESPONSE TO HOW SUBPOENAS. 
INDEED, IN SOME CASES, AGENCIES 

02:21:13.653 --> 02:21:15.653
HAVE ALREADY PRODUCED DOCUMENTS 
IN LAWSUITS AND HEAVILY

02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:21.168
REDACTED FORMS. WITNESSES WITH 
DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OR INVOLVEMENT 

02:21:21.169 --> 02:21:23.310
SHOULD BE HEARD AND THAT 
INCLUDES THE PRESENCE ACTING

02:21:28.684 --> 02:21:30.684
CHIEF OF STAFF AND HIS FORMER 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, JOHN 

02:21:30.718 --> 02:21:32.718
BOLTON WHO HAS PUBLICLY OFFERED 
TO TESTIFY AND TWO SENIOR 

02:21:33.311 --> 02:21:37.014
OFFICIALS IMPLEMENTING THE 
PRESIDENTS FREEZE ON THE 

02:21:37.215 --> 02:21:39.215
UKRAINE'S MILITARY AID

02:21:44.932 --> 02:21:46.966
AND HAVE RELEVANT TESTIMONY. WHY
NOT HEAR IT? ROBERT PLAY HER 

02:21:47.170 --> 02:21:50.015
SERVES AS A SENIOR ADVISOR AND 
THE SENIOR OFFICIAL AND OTHERS 

02:21:50.416 --> 02:21:57.262
WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE THAT WE 
RESERVE TO CALL BUT TO BEGIN THE

02:21:57.439 --> 02:22:06.057
TRIAL. MUSLIM, THE PRESIDENT 
MADE CLEAR THAT HE WOULD HAVE A 

02:22:06.278 --> 02:22:08.907
DECLARATION THAT HE WOULD LOVE 
TO HAVE SECRETARY POMPEO AND NOW

02:22:09.111 --> 02:22:13.575
FORMER CEMETERY PERIOD AND MANY 
OTHER PEOPLE TESTIFY IN THE 

02:22:14.338 --> 02:22:16.338
SENATE TRIAL.

02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:27.795
&gt;&gt;  I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY 
POMPEO AND MITCH AND RICK PERRY 

02:22:27.994 --> 02:22:30.186
AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE TESTIFY.

02:22:35.107 --> 02:22:36.941
&gt;&gt; THE SENATE HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE 

02:22:36.942 --> 02:22:39.730
PRESIDENT UP ON HIS OFFER  AND 
TO MAKE HIS SENIOR AIDES 

02:22:39.902 --> 02:22:45.473
AVAILABLE INCLUDING SECRETARIES 
AREA POMPEO BUT NOW THE 

02:22:45.674 --> 02:22:49.727
PRESIDENT IS CHANGING HIS TUNE. 
THE BLUSTER OF ONE OF HIS 

02:22:49.941 --> 02:22:51.941
WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IS OVER

02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:57.041
. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT 
HE HAS NEVER ASSERTED A CLAIM OF

02:22:57.242 --> 02:22:58.872
PRIVILEGE DURING THE COURSE OF 
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

02:22:58.873 --> 02:23:00.904
PROCEEDINGS. HE THREATENS TO 
INVOKE ONE NOW IN A LAST-DITCH 

02:23:01.106 --> 02:23:04.356
EFFORT TO KEEP THE REST OF THE 
TRUTH FROM COMING OUT. THE 

02:23:04.556 --> 02:23:08.559
PRESIDENT AND HIS LAWYERS HERE 
TO CLAIM THAT THESE WITNESSES OR

02:23:08.730 --> 02:23:12.821
OTHERS CANNOT POSSIBLY TESTIFY 
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES NATIONAL 

02:23:12.996 --> 02:23:16.335
SECURITY. NEVERMIND THAT IT WAS 
HIS ACTIONS IN WITHHOLDING 

02:23:17.087 --> 02:23:19.087
MILITARY AID

02:23:22.033 --> 02:23:23.850
THAT THREATENED OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

02:23:23.851 --> 02:23:25.851
NEVERMIND THAT THE MOST 
IMPEACHABLE AND SERIOUS OFFENSES

02:23:26.136 --> 02:23:30.151
WILL ALWAYS INVOLVE NATIONAL 
SECURITY BECAUSE THEY WILL 

02:23:30.365 --> 02:23:34.014
INVOLVE OTHER NATIONS AND THAT 
MISCONDUCT BASED ON FORD 

02:23:34.215 --> 02:23:36.215
INTEGUMENT WAS WHAT THE FRAMERS 
FEARED MOST.

02:23:39.498 --> 02:23:41.498
THE ABSURD ARGUMENTS AMOUNTS TO 
THIS, WE MUST ENDANGER NATIONAL 

02:23:41.531 --> 02:23:46.196
SECURITY TO PROTECT NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND MAKE THE CONDUCT 

02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:50.007
BEYOND THE REACH OF IMPEACHMENT 
POWER IF WE ARE TO SAVE THE 

02:23:50.171 --> 02:23:52.171
PRESIDENCY.

02:23:54.126 --> 02:23:56.126
THIS IS DANGEROUS NONSENSE AS 
JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT 

02:23:56.158 --> 02:23:58.337
HAVE UNDERSCORED THE 
CONSTITUTION IS NOT A SUICIDE 

02:23:58.506 --> 02:24:02.975
PACT. LET US TURN FROM THE 
ABSTRACT

02:24:06.925 --> 02:24:12.612
AND LET ME SHOW YOU JUST ONE 
EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:17.276
HIDING IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY. THERE IS A DOCUMENT IN

02:24:17.477 --> 02:24:20.068
WHICH THE PRESIDENT REFUSED TO 
TURN OVER IN WHICH THE TOP 

02:24:20.235 --> 02:24:23.372
DIPLOMAT SAYS TO TWO OTHER 
APPOINTEES OF THE PRESIDENT AS I

02:24:23.575 --> 02:24:29.260
SAID ON THE PHONE, I THINK IT IS
CRAZY TO WITHHOLD SECURITY 

02:24:29.674 --> 02:24:31.674
ASSISTANCE OR HELP WITH THE 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.

02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:38.360
THE MAGICIAN REFUSES TO TURN 
OVER THAT DOCUMENT AND SO MANY 

02:24:38.534 --> 02:24:41.657
MORE. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT ITS 
EXISTENCE AND HAVE ONLY SEEN ITS

02:24:41.857 --> 02:24:47.369
CONTENT BECAUSE IT WAS TURNED 
OVER BY A COOPERATING WITNESS. 

02:24:47.541 --> 02:24:49.776
THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD
HIDE FROM YOU AND THE AMERICAN 

02:24:49.976 --> 02:24:54.244
PEOPLE AND IN THE NAME OF 
NATIONAL SECURITY, HE WOULD HIDE

02:24:54.458 --> 02:24:56.476
GRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF HIS 
DANGEROUS MISCONDUCT. THE ONLY 

02:24:57.227 --> 02:25:07.042
QUESTION IS WILL YOU LET HIM? 
LAST YEAR, THEY SAID 

02:25:07.455 --> 02:25:10.254
ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONSTITUTION 
WILL ALLOW HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE

02:25:10.414 --> 02:25:12.525
WANTED AND EVIDENTLY BELIEVING 
THAT ARTICLE 2 EMPOWERED HIM TO 

02:25:12.739 --> 02:25:18.367
DEFY A COLLEGIATE BRANCH BUT 
ALSO DECLARED HE WILL FIGHT OFF 

02:25:18.537 --> 02:25:24.658
SUBPOENAS. LET'S HEAR THE 
PRESIDENT'S OWN WORDS. 

02:25:24.659 --> 02:25:30.807
&gt;&gt;  THAN I HAVE IN ARTICLE 2 
WHERE I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO 

02:25:31.007 --> 02:25:37.511
WHATEVER I WANTED AS PRESIDENT. 
&gt;&gt;  TRUE TO HIS PLEDGE TO 

02:25:38.261 --> 02:25:42.391
OBSTRUCT CONGRESS WHEN PRESIDENT
TRUMP FACE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, 

02:25:42.591 --> 02:25:48.273
HE ORDER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO
DEFY EVERY SINGLE REQUEST ON 

02:25:48.489 --> 02:25:52.754
EVERY SINGLE SUBPOENA. HE ISSUED
THIS ORDER THROUGH THE WHITE 

02:25:52.955 --> 02:25:58.022
HOUSE COUNSEL ON OCTOBER 8 IN 
THE SAME COUNSEL THAT STOOD 

02:25:58.238 --> 02:26:01.886
BEFORE YOU A MOMENT AGO TO 
DEFEND THE PRESENCE MISCONDUCT 

02:26:02.087 --> 02:26:05.666
AND HE THEN INFORMED IT AGAIN ON
A RALLY ON OCTOBER 10. FOLLOWING

02:26:07.326 --> 02:26:12.450
THAT CATEGORICAL OFFER, WE NEVER
RECEIVED KEY DOCUMENTS AND IT IS

02:26:12.650 --> 02:26:16.717
IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND REFUSING 
TO RESPOND TO CONGRESS, THE 

02:26:16.917 --> 02:26:22.814
PRESIDENT DID NOT MAKE ANY 
FORMAL CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE EVER 

02:26:23.215 --> 02:26:26.627
BUT INSTEAD, THE LETTER STATED 
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD 

02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:31.132
WITHHOLD ALL EVIDENCE IN THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH UNLESS THE 

02:26:31.346 --> 02:26:33.346
HOUSE SURRENDERED TO DEMANDS 
THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY PLACE 

02:26:33.531 --> 02:26:37.551
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN CHARGE OF THE
INQUIRY INTO HIS OWN MISCONDUCT.

02:26:38.862 --> 02:26:40.862
NEEDLESS TO SAY, THAT WAS A 
NONSTARTER

02:26:44.946 --> 02:26:46.946
AND DESIGNED TO BE SO. THE 
PRESIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO 

02:26:46.977 --> 02:26:50.227
OBSTRUCT CONGRESS NO MATTER WHAT
WE DID AND MISCONDUCT SINCE HIS 

02:26:50.442 --> 02:26:53.076
ATTACKS ON THE IMPEACHMENT 
INQUIRY AND WITNESSES AND THEY 

02:26:53.841 --> 02:26:55.841
HAVE AFFIRMED

02:26:57.541 --> 02:26:59.576
THAT THE PRESENT NEVER HAD ANY 
INTENTION TO COOPERATE UNDER ANY

02:26:59.775 --> 02:27:02.424
CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHY? BECAUSE 
EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY WOULD 

02:27:02.624 --> 02:27:04.624
ONLY FURTHER PROVE GUILT.

02:27:07.292 --> 02:27:09.292
THE INNOCENT DO NOT ACT THIS 
WAY.

02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:15.590
SIMPLY STATED, THIS TRIAL SHOULD
NOT AWARD THE PRESENCE OF 

02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:17.620
SECTION BY ALLOWING HIM TO 
CONTROL EVIDENCE THAT IS SEEN 

02:27:17.651 --> 02:27:21.217
AND WHEN IT IS SEEN AND WHAT 
EVIDENCE WILL REMAIN HIDDEN.

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:26.998
THE DOCUMENTS THE PRESIDENT 
SEEKS TO CONCEAL INCLUDE WHITE 

02:27:26.999 --> 02:27:29.436
HOUSE RECORDS INCLUDING RECORDS 
ABOUT THE UNLAWFUL HOLD ON 

02:27:30.195 --> 02:27:32.281
MILITARY AID AND THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT RECORDS INCLUDING 

02:27:32.482 --> 02:27:36.951
TEXT MESSAGES AND MESSAGES 
EXCHANGED BY THAT DEPARTMENT AND

02:27:37.712 --> 02:27:42.834
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS AND NOTES BY
CAREER OFFICIALS AS THEY SAW 

02:27:43.048 --> 02:27:45.048
THAT SCHEME UNFOLD IN REAL TIME.

02:27:48.117 --> 02:27:50.512
ON BE RECORDS TO FABRICATE AN 
AFTER-THE-FACT RATIONALE FOR THE

02:27:50.674 --> 02:27:55.955
PRESIDENT ORDERS WITH OBJECTIONS
THAT THE ORDERS VIOLATED THE LAW

02:27:56.287 --> 02:28:00.516
AND DEFENSE DEPARTMENT RECORDS 
REFLECTING BAFFLEMENT AND ALARM 

02:28:00.918 --> 02:28:04.102
AT THE PRESENT SUSPENDED 
MILITARY AID TO A KEY SECURITY 

02:28:04.263 --> 02:28:10.876
PARTNER WITHOUT EXPLANATION. 
MANY AIDS HAVE FOLLOWED ORDERS 

02:28:11.078 --> 02:28:14.728
AND REFUSED TO TESTIFY INCLUDING
CENTRAL FIGURES IN THE 

02:28:14.929 --> 02:28:17.376
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INCLUDING 
THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF 

02:28:17.777 --> 02:28:21.226
IN THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR AND MANY OTHERS WITH 

02:28:21.439 --> 02:28:25.232
RELEVANT TESTIMONY LIKE ROBERT 
BLAIR AND MICHAEL DUFFY. MR. 

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:30.775
BLAIR SERVES AS A SENIOR ADVISOR
TO THE ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF AND

02:28:30.989 --> 02:28:34.439
WORKED DIRECTLY WITH MR. DUFFY 
IN THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND 

02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:42.770
BUDGET TO CARRY OUT THE ORDER TO
FREEZE VITAL MILITARY AND 

02:28:42.971 --> 02:28:47.034
ASSISTANCE. THE TRUMPET OF 
INSTRUCTION HAS REFUSED TO 

02:28:47.235 --> 02:28:49.235
DISCLOSE MEDICATIONS EVEN THOUGH
WE KNOW FROM AND TESTIMONY IN 

02:28:49.822 --> 02:28:53.332
PUBLIC REPORTING AND EVEN 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION THAT THEY

02:28:53.532 --> 02:28:56.782
WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN OF MANY THE
HOLD AND EXTENDING IT AT THE 

02:28:57.534 --> 02:28:59.534
EXPRESS DIRECTION

02:29:01.451 --> 02:29:05.716
EVEN AS CAREER OFFICIALS WARNED 
ACCURATELY THAT DOING SO WOULD 

02:29:05.917 --> 02:29:07.917
VIOLATE THE LAW.

02:29:11.614 --> 02:29:13.614
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO MADE THE 
INSUPPORTABLE CLAIM THAT THE 

02:29:13.632 --> 02:29:16.080
HOUSE SHOULD'VE FORCED SUBPOENAS
IN COURT AND ALLOWED THE 

02:29:16.281 --> 02:29:18.281
PRESIDENT TO DELAY THE 
IMPEACHMENT FOR YEARS AND IF WE 

02:29:18.313 --> 02:29:23.382
HAD DONE SO, WE WOULD'VE 
ABDICATED THE DUTY TO ACT ON THE

02:29:23.596 --> 02:29:27.247
OVERWHELMING FACTS BEFORE US AND
THE EVIDENCE THE PRESIDENT WAS 

02:29:27.450 --> 02:29:29.450
SEEKING TO SHEET

02:29:31.917 --> 02:29:33.948
IN THE ELECTION. WE CANNOT 
ENGAGE IN A COURT PROCESS WHILE 

02:29:34.148 --> 02:29:38.776
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED TO 
THREATEN THE SANCTITY OF OUR 

02:29:38.955 --> 02:29:43.298
ELECTIONS. RESORTING TO THE 
COURSE IS ALSO INCONSISTENT WITH

02:29:43.498 --> 02:29:45.882
THE CONSTITUTION THAT GIVES THE 
HOUSE THE SOLE POWER OF 

02:29:46.046 --> 02:29:49.798
IMPEACHMENT. IF THE HOUSE WERE 
COMPELLED TO EXHAUST ALL LEGAL 

02:29:50.001 --> 02:29:54.069
REMEDIES BEFORE IMPEACHING, IT 
WOULD INTERPOSE THE COURTS OR 

02:29:54.268 --> 02:29:56.268
THE DECISION OF A SINGLE JUDGE

02:29:59.950 --> 02:30:01.984
BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE POWER 
TO IMPEACH. MOREOVER, IT WOULD 

02:30:02.184 --> 02:30:04.184
INVITE THE PRESIDENT TO HAVE HIS
OWN IMPEACHMENT BY ENDLESSLY 

02:30:04.216 --> 02:30:07.666
LITIGATING THE MATTER IN COURT 
APPEALING EVERY JUDGMENT AND 

02:30:07.866 --> 02:30:12.893
ENGAGING EVERY FRIVOLOUS MOTION 
OR DEVICE. INDEED, IN THIS CASE,

02:30:15.184 --> 02:30:17.569
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER THAT WAS 
ORDERED TO FIRE THE SPECIAL 

02:30:17.766 --> 02:30:21.884
COUNSEL AND LIE ABOUT IT WAS 
SUBPOENAED IN APRIL LAST YEAR 

02:30:22.299 --> 02:30:26.766
AND THERE IS STILL NO FINAL 
JUDGMENT. THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT 

02:30:27.215 --> 02:30:29.400
DEFEAT IMPEACHMENT OR 
ACCOUNTABILITY BY ENGAGING IN 

02:30:30.165 --> 02:30:35.098
ENDLESS LITIGATION BUT INSTEAD 
IT HAS BEEN A LONG PRACTICE OF 

02:30:35.298 --> 02:30:40.368
THE HOUSE TO COMPILE COURT 
EVIDENCE NECESSARY TO REACH A 

02:30:40.581 --> 02:30:42.199
REASONABLE DECISION ABOUT 
WHETHER TO IMPEACH AND THEN 

02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:45.249
BRING THE CASE HERE TO THE 
SENATE FOR A FULL TRIAL AND THAT

02:30:45.451 --> 02:30:48.499
IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID HERE WITH
AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SENATE

02:30:48.701 --> 02:30:55.400
HAS ITS OWN POWER TO COMPEL 
DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY. IT 

02:30:55.614 --> 02:31:00.280
WOULD BE ONE THING AT THE HOUSE 
SHOWED NO DOCUMENTS ALTHOUGH 

02:31:00.490 --> 02:31:02.516
EVEN THERE THE HOUSE HAS THE 
SOLE RIGHT TO DETERMINE THESE 

02:31:02.715 --> 02:31:05.966
PROCEEDINGS AS LONG AS IT MAKES 
THE FULL CASE TO THE HOUSE BUT 

02:31:06.166 --> 02:31:10.030
THAT IS QUITE ANOTHER WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT IS THE CAUSE OF HIS 

02:31:10.433 --> 02:31:13.693
OWN COMPLAINT AND WITH THE 
PRESENT WITHHOLDS DOCUMENTS AND 

02:31:13.894 --> 02:31:17.902
ATTEMPTS TO RELY ON HIS OWN 
NIGHT NONCOMPLIANCE.

02:31:21.607 --> 02:31:23.842
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT CRYSTAL 
CLEAR THAT WE WOULD NEVER SEE A 

02:31:24.605 --> 02:31:27.530
SINGLE DOCUMENT OR WITNESS WHEN 
HE DECLARED AS WE JUST WATCHED 

02:31:27.706 --> 02:31:32.454
THAT HE WOULD FIND ALL SUBPOENAS
AND AS A MATTER OF HISTORY, IT 

02:31:32.629 --> 02:31:37.454
WOULD BE WRONG TO ASSERT THAT 
THE SENATE IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN 

02:31:37.689 --> 02:31:41.308
AND REVIEW NEW EVIDENCE 
REGARDLESS OF WHY EVIDENCE WAS 

02:31:41.508 --> 02:31:47.406
PRODUCED IN THE HOUSE. YOU CAN 
AND SHOULD INSIST ON RECEIVING 

02:31:47.608 --> 02:31:51.473
ALL THE EVIDENCE SO YOU CAN 
RENDER IMPARTIAL JUSTICE AND 

02:31:51.675 --> 02:31:54.923
EARN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 
PUBLIC IN THE SENATE'S 

02:31:55.123 --> 02:32:01.423
WILLINGNESS TO HOLD A FAIR 
TRIAL. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, 

02:32:01.625 --> 02:32:04.675
THE SENATE DOES NOT JUST VOTE ON
IMPEACHMENTS. IT DOES NOT JUST 

02:32:04.876 --> 02:32:11.775
DEBATE THEM BUT INSTEAD IT IS 
COMMANDED BY THE CONSTITUTION TO

02:32:11.977 --> 02:32:15.442
TRY ALL CASES OF IMPEACHMENT. IF
THE FOUNDERS INTENDED FOR THEM 

02:32:16.207 --> 02:32:19.907
TO TRY AND CONSIDER AN APPEAL 
BASED ON THE COLD RECORD FROM 

02:32:20.107 --> 02:32:24.573
THE OTHER CHAMBER, THEY WOULD 
HAVE SAID SO BUT THEY DID NOT 

02:32:24.774 --> 02:32:27.006
AND INSTEAD THEY GAVE US THE 
POWER TO CHARGE AND YOU THE 

02:32:27.222 --> 02:32:34.123
POWER TO TRY ALL IMPEACHMENTS. 
THE FRAMERS CHOSE THAT FOR A 

02:32:34.324 --> 02:32:37.511
REASON AS ALEXANDER HAMILTON 
SAID THE SON IS GIVEN AWFUL 

02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:40.953
DISCRETION IN MATTERS OF 
IMPEACHMENT AND THE CONSTITUTION

02:32:42.454 --> 02:32:46.921
SPEAKS TO CENTERS IN THEIR 
JUDICIAL CHARACTER AS THE COURT 

02:32:47.321 --> 02:32:51.190
FOR THE TRIAL OF IMPEACHMENT AND
IT REQUIRES THEM TO AIM AT REAL 

02:32:51.591 --> 02:32:55.765
DEMONSTRATIONS OF INNOCENCE OR 
GUILT AND REQUIRES THEM TO DO SO

02:32:56.162 --> 02:33:02.760
BY HOLDING A TRIAL. LISTENERS 
REPEATEDLY SUBPOENAED AND SAVED 

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:07.381
NEW DOCUMENTS AND OFTEN MANY OF 
THEM ADJUDICATED AND THEY HAVE 

02:33:07.543 --> 02:33:15.559
HEARD TESTIMONY IN EVERY ONE OF 
THE 15 SENATE TRIALS IN THE 

02:33:15.761 --> 02:33:17.870
HISTORY OF THIS REPUBLIC 
INCLUDING THOSE FOR PRESIDENTS 

02:33:18.207 --> 02:33:23.474
AND YOU JOHNSON AND BILL 
CLINTON. INDEED, WITH PRESIDENT 

02:33:23.691 --> 02:33:27.477
JOHNSON, THEY WERE PERMITTED TO 
BEGIN PRESENTING EVIDENCE TO THE

02:33:27.645 --> 02:33:29.645
SENATE

02:33:51.238 --> 02:33:53.346
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THE 
TRIAL. THE HOUSE MANAGERSHAVE 

02:33:53.550 --> 02:33:55.550
HEARD FROM MANY WITNESSES 

02:40:24.968 --> 02:40:26.968
NONE MAY EVER BE.

02:45:41.975 --> 02:45:43.975
THE TRUTH

03:05:30.335 --> 03:05:32.967
ASK YOU TO DO WHAT THEY REFUSED 
TO DO FOR THEMSELVES. THEY HAD A

03:05:33.718 --> 03:05:38.357
COURT DATE. THEY WITHDREW THE 
SUBPOENA AND EVADED THE DECISION

03:05:40.482 --> 03:05:43.530
AND ARE ASKING YOU TO BECOME 
COMPLICIT IN THE ELEVATION OF 

03:05:44.293 --> 03:05:48.609
THE COURTS. IT IS RIDICULOUS AND
WE SHOULD CALL IT OUT FOR WHAT 

03:05:49.372 --> 03:05:51.372
IT IS. OBSTRUCTION FOR GOING TO 
COURT?

03:05:57.340 --> 03:05:59.376
THAT IS AN ACT OF PATRIOTISM TO 
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

03:05:59.573 --> 03:06:01.808
OF THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE IF THEY
CAN DO TO THE PRESIDENT, THEY 

03:06:02.022 --> 03:06:05.219
CAN DO IT TO ANY OF YOU AND ANY 
AMERICAN CITIZEN AND THAT IS 

03:06:05.380 --> 03:06:13.802
WRONG. AND LARGE STRIDE WHO HAD 
BEEN ADVISING THEM, I GUESS HE 

03:06:14.004 --> 03:06:16.036
DIDN'T TELL YOU IN THE CLINTON 
IMPEACHMENT HE SAID IT IS 

03:06:16.235 --> 03:06:20.249
DANGEROUS TO SUGGEST THAT 
INVOKING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 

03:06:20.426 --> 03:06:28.428
IS IMPEACHABLE. IT'S DANGEROUS. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS DANGEROUS, 

03:06:28.831 --> 03:06:36.060
MR. SCHIFF.  SO, WHAT ARE WE 
DOING HERE? WE HAVE THAT

03:06:41.012 --> 03:06:43.012
HOUSE THAT COMPLETELY CONCOCTED 
A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NEVER 

03:06:43.045 --> 03:06:45.045
SEEN BEFORE AND LOCKED THE 
PRESIDENT OUT.

03:06:50.361 --> 03:06:52.594
BY THE WAY, WHILE MR. SCHIFF 
GIVE DOCUMENTS? WE ASKED HIM FOR

03:06:52.794 --> 03:06:55.030
DOCUMENTS.  WE ASKED HIM FOR 
DOCUMENTS WENT CONTRARY TO HIS 

03:06:55.793 --> 03:06:57.793
PRIOR STATEMENTS, IT TURNED OUT

03:07:03.161 --> 03:07:05.393
THAT HIS STAFF IS WORKING WITH 
THE WHISTLEBLOWER. WE SAID C THE

03:07:05.594 --> 03:07:07.989
DOCUMENTS AND RELEASE THEM TO 
THE PUBLIC. WE ARE STILL 

03:07:08.164 --> 03:07:14.063
WAITING. THE IDEA THAT THEY 
WOULD COME HERE AND LECTURE THE 

03:07:14.232 --> 03:07:19.611
SENATE. BY THE WAY, I WAS 
SURPRISED TO HEAR -- DID YOU 

03:07:19.812 --> 03:07:25.368
REALIZE YOU WERE ON TRIAL? MR. 
NOLLER IS PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL. 

03:07:25.709 --> 03:07:29.270
EVERYONE IS ON TRIAL EXCEPT FOR 
THEM. IT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:07:33.012 --> 03:07:35.012
THEY SAID IN THEIR BRIEF, WE 
HAVE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AND 

03:07:35.044 --> 03:07:40.326
THEY ARE AFRAID TO MAKE THEIR 
CASE. THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S 

03:07:41.090 --> 03:07:43.090
COMMON SENSE.

03:07:47.843 --> 03:07:50.013
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE TO IMPEACH
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

03:07:50.178 --> 03:07:55.760
STATES AND THEN THEY COME HERE 
ON THE FIRST DAY AND THEY SAY WE

03:07:55.974 --> 03:07:59.422
NEED SOME MORE EVIDENCE. LET ME 
TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF I SHOWED 

03:07:59.623 --> 03:08:01.623
UP IN ANY COURT IN THIS COUNTRY

03:08:05.105 --> 03:08:07.105
AND I SAID, MY CASES 
OVERWHELMING BUT I'M NOT READY 

03:08:07.137 --> 03:08:10.723
TO GO YET. I NEED MORE EVIDENCE 
BEFORE I CAN MAKE MY CASE.

03:08:14.452 --> 03:08:16.888
I WOULD GET THROWN OUT IN TWO 
SECONDS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

03:08:17.088 --> 03:08:19.655
SHOULD HAPPEN HERE. THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN HERE.

03:08:22.587 --> 03:08:26.236
IT'S TOO MUCH TO LISTEN TO, 
ALMOST. THE HYPOCRISY OF THE 

03:08:26.995 --> 03:08:28.995
WHOLE THING.

03:08:31.306 --> 03:08:37.003
WHAT ARE THE STAKES? WHAT ARE 
THE STAKES? THERE IS AN ELECTION

03:08:37.202 --> 03:08:39.958
IN ALMOST 9 MONTHS. MONTHS FROM 
NOW THERE WILL BE AN ELECTION.

03:08:43.499 --> 03:08:45.933
SENATORS IN THIS BODY THE LAST 
TIME HAD VERY WISE WORDS. THEY 

03:08:46.147 --> 03:08:48.147
ECHOED THE WORDS OF OUR 
FOUNDERS.

03:08:52.231 --> 03:08:59.545
A PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT IS LIKE 
STEALING AN ELECTION. THAT'S 

03:08:59.745 --> 03:09:04.741
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE. TALK ABOUT
THE FRAMERS WORST NIGHTMARE.

03:09:08.491 --> 03:09:12.957
IT IS A PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT 
THAT THEY DELIVERED TO YOUR 

03:09:13.157 --> 03:09:15.189
DOORSTEP IN AN ELECTION YEAR. 
SOME OF YOU ARE UPSET BECAUSE 

03:09:15.391 --> 03:09:18.144
YOU SHOULD BE IN IOWA RIGHT NOW 
BUT INSTEAD WE ARE HERE

03:09:21.886 --> 03:09:24.220
AND THEY ARE NOT READY TO GO. IT
IS OUTRAGEOUS.

03:09:30.832 --> 03:09:32.863
IS OUTRAGEOUS AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WON'T STAND FOR IT. I 

03:09:33.064 --> 03:09:35.497
WILL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. 
THEY ARE NOT HERE TO SEE ONE 

03:09:35.697 --> 03:09:38.547
ELECTION. THEY ARE HERE TO SEE 
TWO ELECTIONS. IT IS BURIED IN 

03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:40.780
THE SMALL PRINT OF THE ARTICLES 
OF IMPEACHMENT. THEY WANT TO 

03:09:40.981 --> 03:09:42.981
REMOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM THE 
BALLOT.

03:09:46.462 --> 03:09:49.472
THEY WON'T TELL YOU THAT. THEY 
DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO SAY THAT 

03:09:49.645 --> 03:09:52.360
DIRECTLY BUT THAT IS EXACTLY 
WHAT THEY ARE HERE TO DO AND 

03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:58.459
THEY ARE ASKING THE SENATE TO 
ATTACK ONE OF THE MOST SACRED 

03:09:58.659 --> 03:10:06.176
RIGHTS WE HAVE AS AMERICANS. THE
RIGHT TO CHOOSE OUR PRESIDENT IN

03:10:06.377 --> 03:10:13.691
AN ELECTION YEAR. IT HAS NEVER 
DONE DONE BEFORE. IT SHOULDN'T 

03:10:13.892 --> 03:10:17.545
BE DONE NOW. THE REASON IT HAS 
EVER BEEN DONE IS BECAUSE NO ONE

03:10:18.297 --> 03:10:24.446
EVER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A 
GOOD IDEA FOR A COUNTRY AND FOR 

03:10:24.660 --> 03:10:30.145
OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN 
TO TRY TO REMOVE A PRESIDENT 

03:10:30.345 --> 03:10:35.764
FROM A BALLOT. TO DENY THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO 

03:10:35.941 --> 03:10:40.095
VOTE BASED ON A FRAUDULENT 
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED IN 

03:10:40.295 --> 03:10:42.295
SECRET WITH NO RIGHT.

03:10:45.979 --> 03:10:48.830
I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT MY 
POINT IS VERY SIMPLE. IT IS LONG

03:10:49.588 --> 03:10:54.929
PAST TIME THAT WE START THIS SO 
WE CAN END THE RIDICULOUS 

03:10:55.129 --> 03:10:59.957
CHARADE AND HAVE AN ELECTION. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHIEF 

03:11:00.121 --> 03:11:02.121
JUSTICE.

03:11:09.959 --> 03:11:13.810
&gt;&gt; DOES THE PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL 
YIELD BACK THE REMAINDER OF 

03:11:14.574 --> 03:11:18.182

DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS RECOGNIZED.

&gt;&gt; THE MAJORITY LEADER IS

03:19:33.085 --> 03:19:35.735

RECOGNIZE AND DEBATE THE

03:19:46.302 --> 03:19:50.554
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, SO 
AWARDED.  

03:19:56.853 --> 03:19:59.301
&gt;&gt; THE SUN IS TAKING A BRIEF 
RECESS HERE AND WE WILL REJOIN 

03:19:59.501 --> 03:20:03.968
AS IT IS A TAKE THEIR SEATS BACK
IN THE SENATE CHAMBER . YOU ARE 

03:20:04.168 --> 03:20:06.000
WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST. THERE ARE 

03:20:06.001 --> 03:20:08.001
CERTAINLY SOME CHANGES ALREADY 
THIS AFTERNOON AND WE EXPECT TO 

03:20:08.034 --> 03:20:13.315
SEE MITCH McCONNELL MAKE AN 
ARGUMENT FOR HAVING THESE 12 

03:20:13.515 --> 03:20:15.549
HOUR DAYS. THESE MARATHON DAYS, 
24 HOURS FOR INSIGHT TO MAKE 

03:20:16.312 --> 03:20:20.416
THEIR ARGUMENTS AND THAT HAS NOW
BEEN LENGTHENED TO THREE DAYS 

03:20:20.617 --> 03:20:23.867
GIVING EVERYONE SOME BREATHING 
ROOM. THAT MEANS WE WON'T 

03:20:24.081 --> 03:20:28.789
NECESSARILY BE GOING UNTIL 1:00 
IN THE MORNING EACH NIGHT AND IT

03:20:28.962 --> 03:20:33.017
CHANGES A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT 
ARE SIGNIFICANT. IT MEANS THAT 

03:20:33.217 --> 03:20:36.066
ALL THIS WILL BE ABLE TO GET 
DONE BEFORE THAT HOUR WHEN 

03:20:36.266 --> 03:20:39.718
PEOPLE ARE TUNING OUT AND GOING 
TO BED. AND ALSO MEANS IF WE 

03:20:39.919 --> 03:20:43.168
LOOK AT THE WAY LADIES ARE 
SCHEDULED OUT THAT THEY WILL 

03:20:43.367 --> 03:20:45.367
HAVE TO MAKE THE DEFENSE

03:20:49.264 --> 03:20:51.900
SPLIT TIME SO THEY WILL LIKELY 
HAVE IT AT THE END OF THIS WEEK 

03:20:52.101 --> 03:20:55.765
AND THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK 
WITH THAT DAY BREAK IN BETWEEN. 

03:20:55.966 --> 03:21:00.232
NOT IDEAL BUT A MORE HUMANE TO 
SCHEDULE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE 

03:21:00.434 --> 03:21:02.466
ARE HEARING FROM OUR REPORTERS 
SOURCING THIS THAT THIS WAS IN 

03:21:03.228 --> 03:21:08.152
LARGE PART BECAUSE OF REPUBLICAN
CONCERN ON THE MODERATE SIDE OF 

03:21:08.354 --> 03:21:13.388
THAT REPUBLICAN AISLE. LET'S GO 
TO MY GUESS, ROSALIND HELDERMAN 

03:21:16.284 --> 03:21:19.735
AND ERIN HOLDER. WE ARE HEARING 
THAT IT IS SENATOR COLLINS AND 

03:21:19.935 --> 03:21:21.768
PERHAPS OTHERS THAT RAISED 
CONCERN ABOUT HOW WE DO 

03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:24.704
McCONNELL WAS STRUCTURING THE 
PARAMETERS OF THIS TRIAL.

03:21:29.487 --> 03:21:31.519
WE ARE SEEING SOME ADJUSTMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE 

03:21:31.720 --> 03:21:34.153
RULES WERE PUT FORWARD ABOUT 18 
HOURS AGO  AND THEN THIS HAPPENS

03:21:34.353 --> 03:21:36.353
BASICALLY ON THE EVE OF THIS 
DEBATE

03:21:40.450 --> 03:21:42.684
AND YOU WOULD THINK THIS WOULD 
BE SOMETHING THEY WOULD WANT TO 

03:21:42.885 --> 03:21:45.119
HIRE UP BEFOREHAND AND MAYBE THE
LIKES OF COLLINS OR OTHERS THAT 

03:21:45.321 --> 03:21:47.555
RAISE CONCERNS THAT HAVE NOT 
DIGESTED THE RULES BUT MAYBE A 

03:21:48.306 --> 03:21:55.283
REFLECTION THAT McCONNELL WOULD 
HAVE TO BE REACTIVE TO WHAT THEY

03:21:55.483 --> 03:21:57.483
ARE TELLING THEM

03:22:00.967 --> 03:22:03.402
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE 
COULD'VE BEEN A VOTE ON THIS AND

03:22:03.601 --> 03:22:05.635
SOMEONE LIKE SUSAN COLLINS WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ON BOARD LIKE 

03:22:05.835 --> 03:22:07.466
THAT. THAT WOULD BE A 
SIGNIFICANT THING FOR 

03:22:07.467 --> 03:22:09.500
REPUBLICANS EVEN IF THEY COULD 
GET THE RULES PACKAGE PASSED IF 

03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:11.700
THEY HAD THEM VOTING AGAINST 
THEM

03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:18.634
AND THAT IS THAT THE RULES WERE 
UNFAIR. I ALSO THINK IT IS 

03:22:18.848 --> 03:22:20.879
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE 
RULE CHANGES THAT WE ARE SEEING 

03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:24.731
BRINGS US CLOSER IN LINE WITH 
THE CLINTON RULES OF 1999. WE 

03:22:24.931 --> 03:22:27.982
TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF RULES 

03:22:28.183 --> 03:22:30.183
AND THIS ADDRESSES TWO OF THEM

03:22:33.466 --> 03:22:37.078
WITH STRETCHING OVER THREE DAYS 
INSTEAD OF TWO AND THERE ARE 

03:22:37.256 --> 03:22:43.832
STILL TWO CLINTON RULES THAT ARE
DIFFERENT FROM TODAY. ONE IS 

03:22:44.032 --> 03:22:46.633
THAT THE NEW RULES DO NOT 
REQUIRE A VOTE OF DISMISSAL

03:22:50.118 --> 03:22:52.565
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A 
MEMBER CAN MOVE FOR AND HAVE A 

03:22:52.766 --> 03:22:55.399
VOTE ON BUT THAT IS NOT REQUIRED
AS IT WAS IN THE CLINTON EXAMPLE

03:22:55.601 --> 03:22:58.049
AND THE OTHER ONE IS THAT THEY 
WILL STILL HAVE THE VOTE BEFORE 

03:22:58.250 --> 03:23:01.901
THE VOTE ON NEW WITNESSES AND 
NEW EVIDENCE SO IT WILL NOT JUST

03:23:02.101 --> 03:23:06.380
BE STRAIGHT MOVING INTO THE 
VOTING ON JOHN BOLTON BUT DO WE 

03:23:06.581 --> 03:23:12.267
WANT TO HAVE THESE NOTES ON NEW 
EVIDENCE AND NEW WITNESSES AND 

03:23:12.468 --> 03:23:14.500
THAT IF THEY APPROVE THAT, THEY 
COULD HAVE VOTES ON INDIVIDUAL 

03:23:14.700 --> 03:23:16.700
WITNESSES. 
&gt;&gt;  IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESTATE 

03:23:16.833 --> 03:23:21.203
THAT WE DO McCONNELL STILL HAS 
HIS CAUCUS WITH HIM ON THE 

03:23:21.403 --> 03:23:23.637
QUESTION OF WAITING TO TALK 
ABOUT WITNESSES UNTIL LATER IN 

03:23:23.837 --> 03:23:26.621
THE PROCESS SO IT'S NOT LIKE 
THEY HAVE HAD SECTIONS ON THE 

03:23:26.801 --> 03:23:28.801
ISSUE.

03:23:31.966 --> 03:23:33.797
MICHALSKI WAS JUST INTERVIEWED 
AND THEY ONCE AGAIN REITERATED 

03:23:33.798 --> 03:23:36.233
THE STING OF I'M OKAY WITH THE 
STARTING AND WE WILL SEE ABOUT 

03:23:36.434 --> 03:23:41.516
THIS LATER ON. THIS QUESTION OF 
EVIDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE 

03:23:41.715 --> 03:23:43.868
ARE ALL TRYING TO TRACK WHAT 
THESE CHANGES ARE

03:23:51.267 --> 03:23:53.500
SO WHY IS THIS SO SIGNIFICANT? 
&gt;&gt; IT MEANS THAT THE EVIDENCE 

03:23:53.701 --> 03:23:55.732
WILL BE FACTORED IN BEFORE WE 
SEE THE OPENING ARGUMENTS AND 

03:23:55.933 --> 03:23:57.966
BEFORE SENATORS WILL START 
ASKING QUESTIONS.  THIS IS 

03:23:58.167 --> 03:24:00.199
SUBJECT TO AN OBJECTION BY 
CERTAIN SENATORS AND IT COULD BE

03:24:00.400 --> 03:24:02.400
VOTED ON WHERE THEY COULD 
PREVENT THE EVIDENCE FROM BEING 

03:24:02.433 --> 03:24:05.181
ADDED INTO THE RECORD 
IMMEDIATELY BUT AS IT WAS BEFORE

03:24:10.362 --> 03:24:13.198
, IT REQUIRED A VOTE TO GET TO 
THAT POINT SO NOW THEY WILL HAVE

03:24:13.398 --> 03:24:15.554
TO TAKE IT OUT BEFORE THEY PUT 
IT IN.

03:24:19.296 --> 03:24:21.531
I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS LIKELY 
THAT THE EVIDENCE WOULD BE ADDED

03:24:21.731 --> 03:24:24.176
AT A LATER DATE BUT THE CHANGE 
NOW IS THAT IT WILL EFFECTIVELY 

03:24:24.376 --> 03:24:26.376
BE PUT ON THE RECORD

03:24:29.243 --> 03:24:31.277
BEFORE WE SEE THE OPENING 
ARGUMENTS AND BEFORE WE SEE THE 

03:24:31.477 --> 03:24:33.709
SENATORS SUBMIT THEIR QUESTIONS.
&gt;&gt; BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, I WANT 

03:24:33.924 --> 03:24:36.358
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE JUST 
WITNESSED.  WE SAW BOTH SIDES 

03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:41.841
LAY SOME GROUNDWORK. IT IS 
FASCINATING THAT J AND PAT 

03:24:42.591 --> 03:24:48.138
CIPOLLONE  THAT WERE ARGUING 
BOTH HAD INACCURACIES AND THAT 

03:24:48.539 --> 03:24:50.539
PRECIPITATION IS HERE TO AN 
AUDIENCE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

03:24:50.574 --> 03:24:54.839
HIS SUPPORTERS BUT THEY HAD 
INACCURACIES IN THE CASE THEY 

03:24:55.039 --> 03:24:57.071
RELATING OUT. 
&gt;&gt; THE BIG ONE  WHICH I WILL 

03:24:57.285 --> 03:25:04.998
MENTION HERE, ONE WAS THAT HE 
REFERENCED THE IDEA THAT ADAM 

03:25:05.198 --> 03:25:08.850
SCHIFF WAS ALWAYS EARLY  
IMPEACHMENT INCREASE BEHIND 

03:25:09.064 --> 03:25:11.064
CLOSED DOORS AND THEY WERE 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

03:25:15.564 --> 03:25:17.596
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THEY VOTED 
TO OPEN UP THE IMPEACHMENT 

03:25:17.797 --> 03:25:20.167
INQUIRY TO HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS.
THEY SAID REPUBLICANS WERE NOT 

03:25:20.333 --> 03:25:22.333
ALLOWED IN THE SKIFF

03:25:26.940 --> 03:25:28.940
AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY NOT 
TRUE. REPUBLICANS ON THE VELVET 

03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:31.972
COMMITTEES WERE ALLOWED TO BE IN
THOSE. THERE WAS A MOMENT AT 

03:25:32.142 --> 03:25:34.658
WHICH CONGRESSMAN GATES FROM 
FLORIDA AND OTHERS TRIED TO WORK

03:25:35.417 --> 03:25:37.417
THEIR WAY

03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:41.527
INTO THE SKIFF EVEN THOUGH THEY 
WERE ON THE NECESSARY 

03:25:41.558 --> 03:25:45.427
COMMITTEES, SOME OF THEM AND IT 
WAS A BIG SCENE BUT THEY WERE 

03:25:45.626 --> 03:25:47.859
DOZENS OF REPUBLICANS THAT WERE 
AUTHORIZED TO BE IN THOSE 

03:25:48.058 --> 03:25:51.054
DEPOSITIONS SO HIM SAYING IT SO 
FLATLY WAS INCORRECT. THE OTHER 

03:25:51.234 --> 03:25:55.776
ONE AND MAYBE THIS IS 
TECHNICALLY MAYBE NOT A TOTAL 

03:25:55.976 --> 03:25:57.976
INACCURACY BUT HE SAID THAT WHEN

03:26:01.674 --> 03:26:03.674
ADAM SCHIFF WAS SUMMARIZING THE 
PRESIDENT'S CALL THAT HE DIDN'T 

03:26:03.707 --> 03:26:08.175
DISCLOSE THAT IT WAS  COMPLETELY
FAKE. ADAM SCHIFF AT THE 

03:26:08.376 --> 03:26:11.830
BEGINNING OF HIS SUMMARY  AND 
HIS IMPLICIT SUMMARY OF THE 

03:26:12.026 --> 03:26:16.491
PHONE CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DID IN FACT SAY HE WAS 

03:26:16.706 --> 03:26:20.493
OFFERING A SUMMARY THAT WAS 
CLOSER TO AN ORGANIZED CRIME 

03:26:20.660 --> 03:26:27.674
NOVEL. HE SAID HIS SUMMARY WAS 
WITH THE RAMBLING AND THE 

03:26:27.875 --> 03:26:31.325
TRANSCRIPT AND HE WAS SAYING 
THINGS NOT IN SO MANY WORDS. HE 

03:26:31.526 --> 03:26:33.356
DID INDICATE THAT HE WAS 
OVERSIMPLIFYING THESE THINGS AND

03:26:33.357 --> 03:26:37.623
PERHAPS COULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE 
BIT CLEARER BUT TO ARGUE THAT HE

03:26:37.824 --> 03:26:42.503
HAD PRESENTED THIS AS A DIRECT 
TRANSCRIPT IS JUST NOT ACCURATE.

03:26:43.262 --> 03:26:48.385
&gt;&gt;  I REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD 
TELL HE WAS DOING IT AND 

03:26:48.587 --> 03:26:51.836
DEMOCRATS WERE LIKE NO BECAUSE 
HE WAS TRYING TO USE THIS 

03:26:52.050 --> 03:26:57.868
HYPERBOLE TO SAY IT READS LIKE A
CLASSIC ORGANIZED CRIME 

03:26:58.035 --> 03:27:00.035
SHAKEDOWN AND THEN

03:27:03.617 --> 03:27:09.104
HE DID THIS THING WHERE IT WAS 
GIMMICKY AND I THINK HE INTENDED

03:27:09.303 --> 03:27:12.966
IT TO RESONATE BUT INSTEAD IT 
BACKFIRED BECAUSE THE PUBLICANS 

03:27:13.166 --> 03:27:15.199
WERE ABLE TO SAY YOU ARE 
INACCURATE AND HOW YOU ARE 

03:27:15.401 --> 03:27:18.052
TALKING ABOUT THE CONTENT OF 
THIS CALL AND IT IS NOW BEING 

03:27:18.249 --> 03:27:20.249
BROUGHT UP. 
&gt;&gt;  I THINK HE REGRETS THAT AND 

03:27:20.282 --> 03:27:26.165
HAS SAID THAT BUT IT IS NOT 
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE TOPIC AT

03:27:26.365 --> 03:27:32.065
HAND. 
&gt;&gt;  HE CLEARLY SET IT UP AS 

03:27:32.266 --> 03:27:34.298
USING AN EXAMPLE. HE WASN'T 
MAKING UP THE CONTENT. 

03:27:34.299 --> 03:27:39.581
&gt;&gt; THE INACCURACIES  THAT WAS IN
THAT INITIAL PRESENTATION, I 

03:27:39.781 --> 03:27:41.781
THINK WE HAVE BECOME

03:27:45.868 --> 03:27:47.868
VERY ACCUSTOMED TO THAT THING IN
PUBLIC RHETORIC AND ESPECIALLY 

03:27:47.899 --> 03:27:50.686
IF WE ASSUME IT DOESN'T MATTER. 
I DO WONDER IF THE PELICAN 

03:27:50.861 --> 03:27:52.861
SENATOR AND IF

03:27:56.433 --> 03:27:58.668
SCHIFF IS ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT 
THOSE AND POINT THEM OUT IN AN 

03:27:58.868 --> 03:28:00.904
EFFECTIVE WAY IF THERE PELICAN 
SENATORS  WILL BE PLEASED. ONE 

03:28:01.102 --> 03:28:03.335
THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME ONLY 
AFTER WE STARTED TO SEE THOSE 

03:28:04.087 --> 03:28:08.144
INITIAL REMARKS IS JUST HOW 
UNUSUAL OF A SETTING THIS IS.

03:28:14.516 --> 03:28:16.753
THE RULES OF THE SENATE REQUIRE 
THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 

03:28:16.948 --> 03:28:19.382
SIT THERE AND LISTEN TO THIS. 
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO 

03:28:19.597 --> 03:28:22.031
EACH OTHER OR LOOK AT THEIR 
PHONES AND IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL 

03:28:22.232 --> 03:28:25.683
THING IN MODERN LIFE FOR ANYONE 
BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE MEMBERS 

03:28:25.885 --> 03:28:28.682
OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO 
BE REQUIRED TO SIT AND DO 

03:28:28.844 --> 03:28:33.001
NOTHING BUT LISTEN TO THE 
PRESENTATION BEING MADE ON THE 

03:28:33.201 --> 03:28:38.483
FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND FOR THAT
REASON, I THINK THERE IS A 

03:28:38.682 --> 03:28:42.949
PRESENTATION BOTH FROM BOTH 
SIDES WHERE THEY ARE NOT 

03:28:43.150 --> 03:28:45.183
AFFECTING THE OUTCOME BUT THEY 
ARE GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT 

03:28:45.385 --> 03:28:50.266
THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE SEE 
AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME PUSHBACK

03:28:50.466 --> 03:28:54.075
FOR PELICAN SENATORS IF THERE IS
A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF 

03:28:54.241 --> 03:28:58.509
INACCURACIES AND ALSO THE 
INITIAL PRESENTATION

03:29:02.248 --> 03:29:04.387
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC WAS BETTER 
ORGANIZED AND THEY HAD

03:29:08.944 --> 03:29:11.793
THE ARGUMENT THAT WENT FROM E TO
B TO C AND OUT THE FALCONS WILL 

03:29:11.993 --> 03:29:13.624
LOVE THAT PATTERN IF IT 
CONTINUES. 

03:29:13.625 --> 03:29:19.509
&gt;&gt; IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT PART OF WHAT  ADAM SCHIFF 

03:29:19.710 --> 03:29:21.744
WAS DOING WAS MAKING A CASE FOR 
SHOWING HOW HISTORICALLY THESE 

03:29:21.944 --> 03:29:24.702
THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE 
PAST  AND THEY WERE FOCUSED

03:29:28.856 --> 03:29:32.464
AND THAT IS WHY THAT SHOULD BE 
FOLLOWED AGAIN. 

03:29:32.465 --> 03:29:34.465
&gt;&gt; 

03:29:36.774 --> 03:29:40.384
I THINK WHAT WE SAW WAS WHAT THE
PRESIDENT WANTS AND

03:29:43.888 --> 03:29:49.121
NOT REALLY DIVING INTO THE 
EVIDENCE OF MUCH AND THAT WAS 

03:29:49.299 --> 03:29:51.514
VERY CAREFULLY PLANNED OUT.

03:30:19.509 --> 03:30:25.139
&gt;&gt;&gt; A WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL WHO IS
TECHNICALLY A LAWYER FOR THE 

03:30:25.301 --> 03:30:28.113
WHITE HOUSE AND NOT THE 
PRESIDENT PERSONALLY. HE IS 

03:30:28.285 --> 03:30:31.438
ACTING AS THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER
HERE. SO YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO

03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:35.022
BE DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT. BUT 
I THINK MAYBE, IF THAT'S THE 

03:30:35.832 --> 03:30:45.711
TONE WE WILL GET FROM THE LIKES 
OF CIPOLLONE, THAT SETS THE 

03:30:45.893 --> 03:30:49.136
TONE FOR THE TRIAL. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO OUR COLLEAGUE ON 

03:30:49.306 --> 03:30:54.537
CAPITOL HILL WHO HAS BEEN 
FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS. RHONDA, 

03:30:54.772 --> 03:30:58.665
WHAT HAS STOOD OUT TO YOU IN 
THIS PROCESS SO FAR? 

03:30:58.666 --> 03:31:02.537
&gt;&gt; THE CHANGES MITCH MCCONNELL 
CAME. THEY CAME RIGHT AFTER THE 

03:31:02.752 --> 03:31:06.065
SENATE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS MET FOR
LUNCH. I JUST HEARD FROM A 

03:31:06.365 --> 03:31:10.274
SENIOR REPUBLICAN AIDE WHO SAID 
THIS WAS TALKED ABOUT. THIS 

03:31:10.424 --> 03:31:12.085
REVOLUTION WAS TALKED ABOUT IN 
THAT LUNCH AND THEN MITCH 

03:31:12.086 --> 03:31:15.376
MCCONNELL CAME WITH THOSE TWO 
CHANGES. JUST TO REVIEW. THOSE 

03:31:15.526 --> 03:31:18.965
TWO CHANGES INCLUDED THE HOUSE 
RECORD WILL NOW BE ENTERED IN AS

03:31:19.215 --> 03:31:24.910
EVIDENCE AUTOMATICALLY. THAT WAS
NOT THE CASE THIS MORNING. AND 

03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:30.453
THEN, SECONDLY, THE WITNESSES 
WILL BE ABLE TO 

03:31:34.486 --> 03:31:36.486
BE 

03:31:38.945 --> 03:31:41.651
VOTED ON AS WELL. REPUBLICANS IF
YOU LOOK AT THE TIMING THAT 

03:31:42.641 --> 03:31:44.750
MITCH MCCONNELL MADE THIS 
DECISION, IT COULD SUGGEST THAT 

03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:47.542
REPUBLICANS REALLY DID HAVE A 
PRIVATE CLOSED DOOR WHERE THEY 

03:31:48.051 --> 03:31:52.749
EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS THAT 
THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD 

03:31:53.149 --> 03:31:55.239
PROCESS. AND, THEIR CONCERNS 
ABOUT CONDENSING THIS TO JUST 

03:31:55.398 --> 03:31:58.758
TWO DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE OR 
FOUR LIKE IT WAS IN THE CLINTON 

03:31:59.038 --> 03:32:02.450
CASE. SO, THAT REALLY STANDS OUT
TO ME THAT MITCH MCCONNELL DID 

03:32:02.830 --> 03:32:06.819
IN FACT CHANGE HIS MIND. WE ARE 
UNSURE IF HE HAD THOSE THOUGHTS 

03:32:07.238 --> 03:32:10.583
BEFORE. BUT, EARLIER, WE WERE 
REPORTING THAT HIS ORIGINAL 

03:32:11.172 --> 03:32:15.361
RESOLUTION WAS TO NOT INCLUDE 
THAT POINT ABOUT BRINGING IN THE

03:32:15.651 --> 03:32:17.711
HOUSE RECORD AUTOMATICALLY. IT 
ALSO DID NOT INCLUDE THAT THERE 

03:32:17.851 --> 03:32:21.903
WOULD BE MORE THAN TWO DAY TO 
FINISH UP THESE OPENING 

03:32:22.043 --> 03:32:23.321
ARGUMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT POINTS RHONDA, THANK 

03:32:23.322 --> 03:32:26.731
YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS A MOVING 
TARGET AND WE ARE WATCHING TO 

03:32:27.101 --> 03:32:30.734
SEE HOW THIS ALL UNFOLDS AND HOW
THESE SENATORS THAT ARE ON THE 

03:32:31.124 --> 03:32:34.483
MODERATE SIDE OF THINGS REALLY 
HAVE SO MUCH POWER AND SWAY. AND

03:32:34.633 --> 03:32:41.012
WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SOME OF 
THAT MUSCLE FLEX IN HOW LEADER 

03:32:41.821 --> 03:32:44.221
MITCH MCCONNELL IS RUNNING 
THINGS. OKAY, MICHAEL. WE KNOW 

03:32:44.431 --> 03:32:47.320
THE SENATORS ARE LOCKED DOWN 
HERE IN DC AND THERE HAS BEEN A 

03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:49.979
REAL QUESTION ABOUT WOULD THEY 
BE ABLE TO GET TO IOWA. WOULD 

03:32:50.129 --> 03:32:54.882
THEY BE ABLE TO DO A TELE TOWN 
HALL IF THIS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS

03:32:55.032 --> 03:32:59.811
WENT INTO 1:00 IN THE MORNING? 
SO, AT 9:00 A.M., VERSUS THE 1 

03:33:00.131 --> 03:33:03.200
SAM, MIGHT BE A BIG DIFFERENCE 
FOR SOME OF THEM. 

03:33:03.201 --> 03:33:07.100
&gt;&gt; IT COULD HELP. I KNOW THERE 
IS STILL PLANNING GOING ON. ALL 

03:33:07.920 --> 03:33:12.291
THESE SENATORS ARE DEALING WITH 
FLUCTUATING SCHEDULES. THEY HAVE

03:33:12.441 --> 03:33:16.300
BEEN HELD UP BY MITCH MCCONNELL 
NOT TELLING THEM WHAT THE 

03:33:16.530 --> 03:33:18.379
SCHEDULE WOULD BE. 
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST US. 

03:33:18.380 --> 03:33:22.922
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST US. THEY HAVE 
POSSIBLE MULTIPLE SCHEDULES. 

03:33:23.072 --> 03:33:26.171
SOME HAVE BOOKED EVENTS SHOULD 
THE TRIAL WRAP NEXT WEEK. AND 

03:33:26.311 --> 03:33:32.079
THEY WILL NOT CANCEL THEM UNTIL 
THEY KNOW IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. I 

03:33:32.829 --> 03:33:37.532
EXPECT YOU WILL HAVE PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE COMING 

03:33:42.031 --> 03:33:44.031
DAYS 

03:33:46.640 --> 03:33:48.720
ABOUT ONLINE CHATS. AND, TOWN 
HALLS. BOTTOM LINE, IT WILL NOT 

03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:55.008
BE THE SAME. THE FACT IS NOW, 
YOU HAVE PETE BUTTIGIEG, AND, 

03:33:55.228 --> 03:33:59.036
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 
TRAVELING THE STATE, HOLDING 

03:33:59.188 --> 03:34:02.377
EVENTS AND THE OTHER THREE OR 
FOUR DEPENDING ON HOW YOU COUNT 

03:34:02.686 --> 03:34:06.396
IT WHO ARE COMPETING IN IOWA ARE
NOT ABLE TO COMPETE AT THE SAME 

03:34:06.690 --> 03:34:09.029
LEVEL. THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, 
THERE'S MULTIPLE NEWS CYCLES 

03:34:09.281 --> 03:34:11.832
GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME. THE 
BIG CAMPAIGN NEWS TODAY REALLY 

03:34:12.124 --> 03:34:15.482
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
IMPEACHMENT. THE FIGHT BETWEEN 

03:34:16.081 --> 03:34:18.468
HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE 
SANDERS. I KNOW A LOT OF VOTERS 

03:34:18.791 --> 03:34:22.989
IN IOWA WILL HEAR THAT NEWS 
TOTALLY SEPARATELY AND 

03:34:23.223 --> 03:34:26.434
INDEPENDENTLY OF IMPEACHMENT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A STORY OUT ABOUT 

03:34:26.766 --> 03:34:28.766
MIKE BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR 
PRESIDENT. AND WHAT HE IS DOING 

03:34:28.874 --> 03:34:33.198
WITH ALL THIS MONEY HE IS 
POURING INTO 

03:34:37.203 --> 03:34:40.172
THE CAMPAIGN. AND, IT LOOKS LIKE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RIGHT IN HIS 

03:34:40.331 --> 03:34:43.336
LINE OF SIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; HE IS TRYING TO RUN A DOUBLE 

03:34:43.482 --> 03:34:46.463
BARREL CAMPAIGN. ONE TO GET 
HIMSELF ELECTED THE NOMINEE. 

03:34:46.633 --> 03:34:48.933
THAT'S VERY MUCH A LONG SHOT BID
THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW WELL 

03:34:49.163 --> 03:34:51.731
OTHER CANDIDATES DO IN THE FIRST
FOUR STATES BUT AT THE SAME 

03:34:52.983 --> 03:35:00.171
TIME, EVERYTHING HE IS DOING TO 
THAT END IS BEING DOUBLE 

03:35:00.471 --> 03:35:03.680
PURPOSED TO HELP DEMOCRATS OR 
SOFTEN TRUMP UP IN THE SWING 

03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:08.529
STATES. THEY ARE PIVOTING THEIR 
AD CAMPAIGN. THEY ARE VASTLY 

03:35:09.408 --> 03:35:13.989
OUTSPENDING ANYBODY IN AMERICA 
RIGHT NOW. IN POLITICS ON 

03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:16.138
TELEVISION. I'M SURE YOUR 
VIEWERS ARE ALL WATCHING THEIR 

03:35:16.139 --> 03:35:21.184
ADS WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT.
THEY WILL PIVOT THAT IN 27 

03:35:22.004 --> 03:35:25.501
STATES ABOUT WHY TRUMP NEEDS TO 
BE IMPEACHED. IT IS A DIRECT TO 

03:35:25.711 --> 03:35:28.894
CAMERA SPOT. IF THE SENATORS 
DON'T DO THEIR JOB, WE WILL DO 

03:35:29.097 --> 03:35:31.097
IT IN NOVEMBER. THAT'S IMPORTANT
BECAUSE NUMBER OF THESE STATES 

03:35:31.218 --> 03:35:40.029
WHERE THESE ADS WILL BE RUNNING 
ARE STATES WHERE 

03:35:45.028 --> 03:35:48.833
THERE ARE REPUBLICAN IMCOUPLE 
ENCOUPLE BENTS. TO MAKE SENATOR 

03:35:49.365 --> 03:35:52.601
SUSAN COLLINS FEEL A LITTLE MORE
CONCERNED. SHE KNOWS HER VIEWERS

03:35:53.281 --> 03:35:55.385
ARE WATCHING WHATEVER THE 
NEWSCAST SHOWS ABOUT THE 

03:35:57.655 --> 03:35:59.655
IMPEACHMENT WILL WATCH MIKE 
BLOOMBERG SAYING THEY ARE 

03:35:59.765 --> 03:36:03.355
CALLING HER A COWARD ON TV. 
DURING THE STATION BREAK. AND I 

03:36:03.505 --> 03:36:08.409
EXPECT YOU WILL SEE MORE OF 
THIS. HE IS RUNNING AT A CLIP OF

03:36:08.559 --> 03:36:11.679
$30 MILLION A WEEK WHICH IS A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. EVEN AT 

03:36:12.049 --> 03:36:15.639
THE END OF THE GENERAL ELECTION.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE WATCHING THE SENATE AS

03:36:16.146 --> 03:36:21.955
MEMBERS GO BACK AND FORTH. 
REPORTERS ARE REALLY PENNED IN. 

03:36:22.105 --> 03:36:26.051
THE HALLS ARE NEVER THIS CLEAR. 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN A REPORTER ON 

03:36:26.201 --> 03:36:28.580
CAPITOL HILL, USUALLY, WE ARE 
LOITERING AROUND WAITING TO TALK

03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:32.160
TO SENATORS AS THEY COME OUT. 
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 

03:36:33.140 --> 03:36:35.630
PROCESS. YOU CAN PULL A SENATOR 
ASIDE AND DO A WALK AND TALK 

03:36:36.020 --> 03:36:40.037
WITH THEM. IF THEY KNOW YOU, 
THEY WILL GIVE YOU A SENSE OF 

03:36:40.447 --> 03:36:42.937
WHAT THEY ARE THINKING. OFF THE 
RECORD, ON THE RECORD. THAT'S AN

03:36:43.087 --> 03:36:45.737
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS REPORTING
PROCESS. AND, THE JOURNALISTS 

03:36:45.947 --> 03:36:50.967
ARE REALLY STUCK IN PLACE RIGHT 
NOW. SO, A LOT OF WORK WILL BE 

03:36:51.127 --> 03:36:54.797
DONE ON THE PHONES TO TRY TO 
PING PEOPLE. GET MESSAGES. BUT, 

03:36:55.147 --> 03:36:58.809
THE SENATORS IN THE CHAMBER 
CAN'T HAVE THEIR DEVICES. SO, 

03:36:58.979 --> 03:37:01.258
YOU KNOW, THIS REPORTING PROCESS
IS TAKING ON A VERY DIFFERENT 

03:37:01.398 --> 03:37:04.648
SORT OF FEEL FOR SO MANY OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL HILL. I 

03:37:05.288 --> 03:37:08.717
WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU 
ABOUT THE ATTORNEYS FOR 

03:37:09.407 --> 03:37:11.719
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHO IS 
REPRESENTING HIM. SO MANY OF 

03:37:12.209 --> 03:37:15.948
THESE ARE NAMES AND FACES 

03:37:20.288 --> 03:37:23.021
FROM FOX NEWS. FROM CONSERVATIVE
RADIO. LIKE KEN STARR WHO HAS 

03:37:23.201 --> 03:37:27.330
DONE THE TV THING AND WAS THE 
ONE WHO WENT AFTER PRESIDENT 

03:37:27.900 --> 03:37:30.490
TRUMP DURING HIS IMPEACHMENT 
PROCESS. WHO ARE YOU WATCHING ON

03:37:30.678 --> 03:37:36.816
THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND WHO 
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR? 

03:37:36.817 --> 03:37:41.245
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I'M LESS INTERESTED
AT THIS POINT IN WHICH ONE TO 

03:37:41.385 --> 03:37:45.535
WATCH AND MORE IN WHO HANDLES 
THINGS WHEN WE GET TO THE STATES

03:37:46.124 --> 03:37:48.814
WHERE THEY ASK QUESTIONS. THAT'S
THE 

03:37:52.544 --> 03:37:59.536
PART THAT I THINK IS MOST UP IN 
THE AIR. I'M NOT SURE WHICH, IF 

03:37:59.836 --> 03:38:04.323
ANY OF THESE LAWYERS ARE REALLY 

03:38:08.152 --> 03:38:10.152
WELL 

03:38:13.152 --> 03:38:15.152
VERSED IN THE ACTUAL 

03:38:17.342 --> 03:38:23.947
FACTS. THE TIME LINE. IT WILL BE
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY 

03:38:25.957 --> 03:38:27.957
HANDLE THAT. WE ARE AWAYS AWAY 

03:38:30.956 --> 03:38:36.515
FROM THAT STAGE OF THE TRIAL. IT
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE. 

03:38:36.516 --> 03:38:46.204
&gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT THE 
INACCURACIES SAID BY PAT 

03:38:46.494 --> 03:38:48.944
CIPOLLONE. THE WHITE HOUSE 
ELECTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE. HE 

03:38:49.614 --> 03:38:53.368
ALSO SAID THAT THE INVESTIGATION
BY SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 

03:38:54.988 --> 03:38:56.897
MUELLER FOUND NO OBSTRUCTION. 
WHEN ACTUALLY, WHAT MUELLER 

03:38:56.898 --> 03:39:03.493
DECIDED TO DO AS YOU WELL KNOW, 
WAS NOT WEIGH IN ON WHETHER THE 

03:39:04.355 --> 03:39:07.077
PRESIDENT ABOUT INSTRUCTED 
JUSTICE. I'M FASCINATED BY THIS.

03:39:07.227 --> 03:39:11.369
IT GIVES A SENSE OF JUST WHAT 
ARGUMENTS MAY COME OUT LATER IN 

03:39:11.569 --> 03:39:14.983
THE TRIAL. IF THEY ARE SAYING 
THINGS INCORRECT NOW, IT IS 

03:39:15.273 --> 03:39:17.695
REALLY ABOUT PROCESS. IT DOES 
CALL INTO QUESTION HOW STRONG 

03:39:17.967 --> 03:39:20.208
AND ROBUST THEIR DEFENSE WILL 
BE. 

03:39:20.209 --> 03:39:22.701
&gt;&gt; WELL, AND, AGAIN, THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT 

03:39:25.903 --> 03:39:32.658
A LOT OF THINGS. THE BASE OF THE
ISSUE IS DEBATING THE RULES. THE

03:39:32.898 --> 03:39:36.207
PROCEDURE. AND, SCHIFF KIND OF 
GOT INTO, WENT SOMEWHAT BEYOND 

03:39:36.399 --> 03:39:38.936
THE PROCEDURE IN HIS REMARKS 
TALKING KIND OF ABOUT THE ACTUAL

03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:43.316
CHARGES AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 
BUT, A LOT OF WHAT HE WAS 

03:39:43.626 --> 03:39:47.020
TALKING ABOUT DID RELATE TO THE 
PROCEDURE THAT MITCH MCCONNELL 

03:39:47.234 --> 03:39:50.335
PUT FORWARD SHOWING SLIDES OF 
HOW THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN 

03:39:50.775 --> 03:39:53.773
HISTORY. HOW MANY WITNESSES WERE
HEARD. IMPEACHMENTS OF THE PAST.

03:39:53.933 --> 03:39:57.387
WHEN YOU GOT TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
TEAM, THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT 

03:39:58.402 --> 03:40:01.195
THE MUELLER REPORT. THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT I BELIEVE THEY 

03:40:01.365 --> 03:40:05.995
MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED THE TEXT 
MESSAGES BETWEEN THE FBI AGENT. 

03:40:06.155 --> 03:40:09.035
ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS THAT 
MIGHT BE APPEALING TO TRUMP. 

03:40:09.195 --> 03:40:11.393
MIGHT BE APPEALING TO HIS 
SUPPORTERS BUT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH 

03:40:13.578 --> 03:40:21.605
TO DO WITH THE IMPEACHMENT CASE.
OR ABOUT THE PROCEDURES. 

03:40:21.606 --> 03:40:24.456
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SO, I WOULD LOVE TO 
HEAR FROM YOU WHAT THE 

03:40:24.606 --> 03:40:29.749
CANDIDATES WHO ARE SORT OF STUCK
HERE IN WASHINGTON. AND WANT TO 

03:40:29.899 --> 03:40:32.859
BE IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
HOW THEY ARE VIEWING THIS 

03:40:33.049 --> 03:40:35.649
IMPEACHMENT IN TERMS OF HOW DO 
THEY TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT WHEN

03:40:35.799 --> 03:40:42.425
IT WRAPS UP LIKE IN THE EVENING?
HOW ARE THEY, THEY HAVE ALL BEEN

03:40:42.585 --> 03:40:45.355
JUSTIFYING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.
HOW THEY NEED TO BE HERE IN 

03:40:45.585 --> 03:40:49.465
WASHINGTON. BUT, HOW ARE THEY 
GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH 

03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:52.510
VOTERS IN MATERIALLY MORNING 
HOURS BEFORE THINGS KICK INTO 

03:40:52.750 --> 03:40:54.750
GEAR IN WASHINGTON? 
&gt;&gt; IT IS TRICKY FOR THEM. 

03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:57.069
IMPEACHMENT IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT COMES UP A LOT ON THE 

03:40:57.269 --> 03:41:01.394
CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT IS NOT A BIG 
DECIDING ISSUE IN THE DEMOCRATIC

03:41:01.544 --> 03:41:03.734
PRIMARY. DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE 
ANY OF THE CANDIDATES FROM THE 

03:41:04.344 --> 03:41:06.434
OTHER CANDIDATES. THEY ARE ALL 
IN FAVOR OF IMPEACHING THE 

03:41:06.574 --> 03:41:09.574
PRESIDENT. THEY ARE ALL STRONG 
IN THE WORDS THEY SAY. I THINK 

03:41:09.794 --> 03:41:13.968
WHAT EACH CANDIDATE IS TRYING TO
DO IS TAKE IMPEACHMENT AND THEN 

03:41:14.788 --> 03:41:17.308
THREAD IT THROUGH THE THEMES 
THEY HAVE THAT ARE CENTRAL 

03:41:18.498 --> 03:41:21.198
THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN. SOMEONE 
LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN WHO HAZE 

03:41:21.418 --> 03:41:23.818
ANCHORED HER ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IN 
THE IDEA OF FIGHTING CORRUPTION 

03:41:24.188 --> 03:41:28.300
IN WASHINGTON. HERE YOU HAVE A 
VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE OF ALLEGED 

03:41:28.490 --> 03:41:32.696
CORRUPTION. THEIR CAMPAIGN IS 
ACTUALLY NOT UNHAPPY WITH THE 

03:41:32.836 --> 03:41:38.808
IDEA THAT THE FINAL WEEK BEFORE 
THE IOWA CAUCUS, THE ENTIRE 

03:41:39.108 --> 03:41:42.494
COUNTY WILL BE THINKING ABOUT 
CORRUPTION. AND THAT WILL COME 

03:41:44.394 --> 03:41:48.414
UP QUITE A BIT. SOMEONE LIKE AMY
KLOBUCHAR HAS BEEN RUNNING ON 

03:41:48.784 --> 03:41:51.834
HER EXPERIENCE IN WASHINGTON. ON
HER KNOWLEDGE OF THE SENATE. 

03:41:51.994 --> 03:41:55.457
AND, THE SAME WAY, I THINK SHE 
WILL EMPHASIZE HER UNDERSTANDING

03:41:57.497 --> 03:42:01.997
OF THE NUANCES OF THE CASE. SHE 
IS GOING TO TRY TO PLAY INTO 

03:42:02.137 --> 03:42:07.583
THAT IDEA OF CONFIDENCE WHICH IS
REALLY CENTRAL TO HER CAMPAIGN. 

03:42:07.733 --> 03:42:11.413
BERNIE SANDERS IS SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME DEALING WITH THE FACT 

03:42:11.813 --> 03:42:15.568
HILLARY CLINTON JUST SAID SOME 
UNKIND THINGS ABOUT HIM. TRYING 

03:42:16.608 --> 03:42:19.358
TO SHOW HIMSELF TO BE ABOVE ALL 
THAT. SO I THINK HE WILL TAKE 

03:42:19.608 --> 03:42:21.608
WHATEVER APPROACH HE CAN 

03:42:23.818 --> 03:42:26.589
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT YEAH. 
ALL THAT SAID, THIS ISN'T A 

03:42:29.799 --> 03:42:32.439
WIN WIN FOR THESE CANDIDATES. 
THEY HAVE ALL KIND OF ARGUES 

03:42:32.589 --> 03:42:38.013
THAT OH, MAYBE IF THE COUNTRY IS
FOCUSED ON US, WE WILL GET AIR 

03:42:38.433 --> 03:42:42.443
TIME. THEY ARE NOT GETTING MUCH 
AIR TIME. AND IT IS SOMETHING 

03:42:43.493 --> 03:42:46.485
THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THEY ARE
ALL ARGUING RIGHT NOW FOR LONGER

03:42:46.715 --> 03:42:48.715
TRIALS WHICH IS WORSE 

03:42:52.725 --> 03:42:54.725
FOR THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
YOU 

03:42:58.785 --> 03:43:03.129
KNOW. PAT CIPOLLONE HAD A 
COMMENT TO THAT EFFECT. THIS IS 

03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:05.138
A MORE GRAVE CONSTITUTIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY THEY HOLD AND 

03:43:05.139 --> 03:43:07.878
THEY ARE WILLING TO CARRY THAT 
OUT. 

03:43:07.879 --> 03:43:10.928
&gt;&gt; ONE THING ADAM SCHIFF DID WAS
PLAY PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OWN WORDS

03:43:11.118 --> 03:43:15.218
DURING HIS REMARKS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED TO SEE 

03:43:15.358 --> 03:43:18.348
WITNESSES CALLED. WHAT SORT OF 
HOT WATER DOES IT GET THE WHITE 

03:43:18.628 --> 03:43:21.522
HOUSE INTO IF WITNESSES ARE 
CALLED AND THE FREE-WHEELING 

03:43:21.812 --> 03:43:23.822
BRING IT ALL OUT WAY THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS TALKING 

03:43:24.132 --> 03:43:26.571
ABOUT IT BUT NOW DOES NOT 
ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE? 

03:43:26.572 --> 03:43:32.230
&gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF REALLY KEY PLAYERS WHO

03:43:33.130 --> 03:43:40.112
HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD FROM AT ALL. 
YOU TAKE THE ONE PEOPLE TALK 

03:43:40.922 --> 03:43:45.555
ABOUT MOST OFTEN. JOHN BOLTON. 
WE KNOW FOR A FACT HE HAD TWO 

03:43:46.635 --> 03:43:50.395
MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE MONTH 

03:43:54.255 --> 03:43:58.694
OF AUGUST IN 2019. WE TALK A LOT
ABOUT PROCEDURE IN POLITICS. 

03:43:58.844 --> 03:44:01.124
SOMETIMES THE FACTS OF THE CASE 
GET A LITTLE FUZZY 

03:44:05.554 --> 03:44:08.851
FOR PEOPLE. JUST AS A REMINDER, 
THE PRESIDENT WAS PUSHING FOR 

03:44:10.851 --> 03:44:12.470
THE BIDEN INVESTIGATION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED PRESIDENT 

03:44:12.471 --> 03:44:17.377
ZELENSKY IF ME WOULD OPEN THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS. AND RIGHT AROUND

03:44:17.527 --> 03:44:23.697
THAT SAME TIME, THE UNITED 
STATES WAS WITHHOLDING THIS 

03:44:24.047 --> 03:44:26.576
REALLY NEEDED HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MILITARY 

03:44:26.726 --> 03:44:30.176
AID. AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 
TRIED TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO 

03:44:30.956 --> 03:44:34.846
QUID PRO QUO INVOLVED. THE 
MILITARY AID WAS NOT BEING 

03:44:35.456 --> 03:44:37.996
WITHHELD AS TO PRESSURE POINT. 
AS LEVERAGE TO GET THE 

03:44:38.266 --> 03:44:44.586
UKRAINIANS TO AGREE TO WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED ABOUT BIDEN. 

03:44:44.736 --> 03:44:47.454
BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF KEY 
MOMENTS WHEN PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT

03:44:47.664 --> 03:44:55.265
THIS ISSUE WITH TRUMP AND WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS SAID. ONE OF

03:44:55.405 --> 03:44:59.229
THOSE WAS A ONE ON ONE MEETING 
WITH JOHN BOLTON IN WHICH HE 

03:44:59.379 --> 03:45:02.199
CONVINCED THEM TO RELEASE THE 
MILITARY AID. HE WAS GOING TO 

03:45:02.439 --> 03:45:05.249
TRY TO PERSUADE THE PRESIDENT 
AND HE CAME OUT AND TOLD OTHER 

03:45:05.739 --> 03:45:10.518
PEOPLE IT'S NOT HAPPENING. THE 
AID IS BEING WITHHELD, SO, WHY 

03:45:11.168 --> 03:45:17.800
DID THE PRESIDENT TELL HIM HE 
WAS WITHHOLDING THE AID? WE DO 

03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:20.920
NOT KNOW. AND IF JOHN BOLTON 
WERE TO BE CALLED I ASSUME, IF 

03:45:21.340 --> 03:45:24.459
HE WERE TO BE CALLED AND TO 
ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS, WE 

03:45:24.649 --> 03:45:31.853
WOULD FIND OUT. NO ONE KNOWS IF 
THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION IS 

03:45:32.143 --> 03:45:34.143
USEFUL 

03:45:35.673 --> 03:45:39.981
TO THE PRESIDENT OR NOT. IT 
PROBABLY IS NOT GIVEN HOW HARD 

03:45:42.251 --> 03:45:44.551
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS FOUGHT. 
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE IN THE SENATE, 

03:45:46.953 --> 03:45:51.278
WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM?
&gt;&gt; JOHN BOLTON, THEN MAYBE MICK 

03:45:51.570 --> 03:45:53.590
MULVANEY, THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH 

03:45:53.808 --> 03:45:56.960
WITHHOLDING THE AID AND KNOWS A 
GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHAT WAS 

03:45:57.110 --> 03:46:01.126
HAPPENING FOLLOWED BY SECRETARY 
OF STATE MIKE POMPEO. FOLLOWED 

03:46:01.278 --> 03:46:03.764
PERHAPS BY THERE ARE SOME 
OFFICIALS IN THE OFFICE OF 

03:46:03.904 --> 03:46:08.336
MANAGEMENT OF BUDGET WHO HAVE 
NOT TESTIFIED. AND WHO ALSO KNOW

03:46:08.616 --> 03:46:11.946
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE AID AND 

03:46:15.596 --> 03:46:17.596
SOMEWHERE AFTER THAT WOULD 

03:46:21.184 --> 03:46:22.749
BE PARNAS, THE GIULIANI 
ASSOCIATE. 

03:46:22.750 --> 03:46:27.010
&gt;&gt; HOW HARD ARE THE DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR 

03:46:32.010 --> 03:46:34.010
PRESIDENT PUSHING 

03:46:35.490 --> 03:46:36.843
FOR MORE WITNESSES, MORE 
TESTIMONY? 

03:46:36.844 --> 03:46:41.194
&gt;&gt; NONE OF THE CANDIDATES IN THE
SENATE ARE LEADING THE CHARGE. 

03:46:41.334 --> 03:46:45.784
THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IS 
UNITED AND CHUCK SCHUMER IS THE 

03:46:45.988 --> 03:46:50.888
FACE OF THAT. THIS IS NOT A 
BERNIE SANDERS ISSUE OR 

03:46:51.038 --> 03:46:53.007
ELIZABETH WARREN ISSUE. 
IMPEACHMENT IS NOT THE THING 

03:46:53.008 --> 03:46:57.376
THAT WILL GET ANYONE THE 
NOMINATION OVER ANYONE ELSE IN 

03:46:57.526 --> 03:47:00.836
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. BUT THEY 
ARE ALL SHOWING BOTH THAT THEY 

03:47:00.986 --> 03:47:06.806
ARE LOYAL TO THE PARTY AND TO 
THE PARTY EFFORTS. AND, THEY ARE

03:47:06.946 --> 03:47:10.126
SHOWING THEIR OPPOSITION TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ACTIONS 

03:47:10.826 --> 03:47:13.076
WHICH WILL SERVE A PREREQUISITE 
FOR SOMEONE WHO WANT TO BE 

03:47:13.296 --> 03:47:14.875
CONSIDERED A DEMOCRAT AT THIS 
POINT. 

03:47:14.876 --> 03:47:19.398
&gt;&gt; WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
WITNESSES. LET'S HEAR WHAT 

03:47:19.798 --> 03:47:22.698
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF SAID HIMSELF. 
LET'S HOLD BACK, BECAUSE CHIEF 

03:47:22.888 --> 03:47:27.181
JUSTICE ROBERTS HAS TAKEN HIS 
SEAT AGAIN. SO LET'S GO LIVE TO 

03:47:31.411 --> 03:47:33.411
THE 

03:47:36.411 --> 03:47:40.730
SENATE FLOOR. 
&gt;&gt; VERY WELL. MR. SCIPOLLONE? 

03:47:40.880 --> 03:47:44.550
MR. SCHIFF YOU HAVE AN HOUR. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU  

03:47:49.410 --> 03:47:54.014
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. LY CALL 
HOUSEMANNAGEMENT LAUGHLIN TO 

03:47:54.294 --> 03:47:58.334
RESPOND. I DO WANT TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY BEFORE CERTAIN 

03:47:58.474 --> 03:48:00.682
REPRESENTATIONS BECAME CONGEALED
TO RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE'S 

03:48:00.992 --> 03:48:04.872
ARGUMENT ABOUT THE RESOLUTION AT
LARGE. FIRST, IT IS WORTH NOTING

03:48:05.792 --> 03:48:10.399
THEY SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE 
RESOLUTION. THEY SAID NOTHING 

03:48:10.949 --> 03:48:17.699
ABOUT THE RESOLUTION. THEY MADE 
NO EFFORT TO DEFEND IT. OR TO 

03:48:17.899 --> 03:48:22.997
CLAIM THAT WAS LIKE THE SENATE 
TRIAL IN THE CLINTON PROCEEDING.

03:48:23.137 --> 03:48:25.437
THEY MADE NO ARGUMENT THAT, 
WELL, THIS IS DIFFERENT HERE 

03:48:25.997 --> 03:48:30.527
BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT. THEY 
MADE NO ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT 

03:48:30.760 --> 03:48:34.299
WHATSOEVER. THEY MADE NO 
ARGUMENT THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO 

03:48:34.439 --> 03:48:38.489
TRY THE CASE AND THEN CONSIDER 
DOCUMENTS. THEY MADE NO ARGUMENT

03:48:38.689 --> 03:48:41.578
ABOUT WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE
A TRIAL WITHOUT WITNESSES 

03:48:43.078 --> 03:48:45.078
BECAUSE IT IS INDEFENSIBLE. IT 
IS INDEFENSIBLE. NO TRIAL IN 

03:48:46.368 --> 03:48:50.988
AMERICA HAS EVER BEEN CONDUCTED 
LIKE THIS. SO 

03:48:54.888 --> 03:48:56.888
YOU 

03:48:59.901 --> 03:49:06.611
HEARD NOTHING ABOUT IT. THEY 
COULDN'T DEFEND IT ON THE BASIS 

03:49:06.784 --> 03:49:09.464
OF SENATE HISTORY OR THE 
CONSTITUTION. THEY COULDN'T 

03:49:09.694 --> 03:49:12.904
DEFEND IT AT ALL. SO WHAT DID 
THEY SAY? FIRST, THEY MADE THE 

03:49:13.094 --> 03:49:16.584
REPRESENTATION THAT THE HOUSE IS
CLAIMING THERE WAS NO SUCH 

03:49:20.094 --> 03:49:22.292
THING AS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 
THAT'S NONSENSE. NO ONE HERE HAS

03:49:22.602 --> 03:49:27.122
SUGGESTED THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. BUT THE 

03:49:27.272 --> 03:49:30.560
INTERESTING THING HERE IS THEY 
NEVER CLAIMED EXECUTIVE 

03:49:30.700 --> 03:49:35.810
PRIVILEGE. NOT ONCE DURING THE 
HOUSE INVESTIGATION DID THEY SAY

03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:43.552
A SINGLE DOCUMENT WAS 
PRIVILEGED. WHY DIDN'T THEY? WHY

03:49:43.702 --> 03:49:50.052
ONLY NOW? WHY NOT IN THE HOUSE? 
IN ORDER TO CLAIM  PRIVILEGE AS 

03:49:50.212 --> 03:49:54.229
THEY KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD 
LAWYERS, YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY 

03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:56.268
WHICH DOCUMENT, WHICH LINE, 
WHICH CONVERSATION. THEY DIDN'T 

03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:59.049
WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE TO DO 
THAT, THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE 

03:49:59.189 --> 03:50:01.189
TO 

03:50:02.909 --> 03:50:04.909
REVEAL 

03:50:06.959 --> 03:50:15.438
THE EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT. 
THAT'S WHY THEY MADE NO 

03:50:15.858 --> 03:50:18.378
INVOCATION OF PRIVILEGE. THAT 
THE HOUSE SHOULD BE ABLE TO 

03:50:19.778 --> 03:50:23.628
IMPEACH AFTER EXHAUSTING ALL 
REMEDIES. AFTER SAYING THE HOUSE

03:50:24.058 --> 03:50:26.941
WILL HAVE THE SOLE IMPEACHMENT. 
BUT ONLY AFTER IT GOES TO COURT.

03:50:27.081 --> 03:50:31.331
THE DISTRICT COURT. THE COURT OF
APPEALS THE SUPREME COURT. THEY 

03:50:31.471 --> 03:50:34.441
GO BACK UP THE CHAIN AND SIX 
YEARS. WHY DIDN'T THE FOUNDERS 

03:50:34.591 --> 03:50:42.336
REQUIRE THE CAUTION OF LEGAL 
REMEDIES? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T 

03:50:42.476 --> 03:50:44.476
WANT TO PUT THE 

03:50:48.236 --> 03:50:50.236
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS IN THE 

03:50:54.280 --> 03:50:56.280
COURTS.

03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:01.744
I KID YOU NOT. OTHER LAWYERS. 
MAKE NOT 

03:51:05.754 --> 03:51:12.945
THE ONES AT THIS STABLE, BUT 
THEY ARE TELLING YOU THE EXACT 

03:51:16.845 --> 03:51:20.350
OPPOSITE. THAT YOU CANNOT 
ENFORCE CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS.

03:51:20.490 --> 03:51:22.490
THEY BROUGHT UP DEPUTY 

03:51:24.440 --> 03:51:27.400
TO JOHN BOLTON SAYING HE WENT TO
COURT TO FIGHT US. THE JUSTICE 

03:51:27.550 --> 03:51:30.451
DEPARTMENT SAID HE CAN'T DO 
THAT. THESE LAWYERS SAY HE 

03:51:30.661 --> 03:51:36.451
SHOULD, THOSE LAWYERS SAY HE 
SHOULDN'T. THEY CAN'T HAVE IT 

03:51:36.761 --> 03:51:39.661
BOTH WAYS. INTERESTINGLY, HE 
WENT TO COURT AND THEY APPLAUD 

03:51:41.167 --> 03:51:43.557
HIM FOR DOING THAT. HIS BOSS, 
JOHN BOLTON NOW SAYS THERE IS NO

03:51:43.707 --> 03:51:51.392
NECESSITY FOR HIM TO GO TO 
COURT. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT.

03:51:51.532 --> 03:51:53.532
HE IS WILLING 

03:51:55.682 --> 03:51:59.032
TO TESTIFY WHAT HE KNOWS. THE 
QUESTION IS DO 

03:52:03.072 --> 03:52:05.072
YOU 

03:52:08.067 --> 03:52:11.437
WANT TO HEAR IT?
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY IT WAS A

03:52:11.967 --> 03:52:14.795
DRUG DEAL? DO YOU WANT TO ASK 
HIM WHY IT WAS A DRUG DEAL? WHY 

03:52:14.935 --> 03:52:20.555
HE TOLD PEOPLE GO TALK TO THE 
LAWYERS? YOU SHOULD WANT TO 

03:52:21.305 --> 03:52:24.253
KNOW. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO 
KNOW. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TOE 

03:52:24.403 --> 03:52:27.713
KNOW. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO KNOW. CAN YOU REALLY LIVE

03:52:27.863 --> 03:52:33.533
UP TO THE OATH YOU HAVE TAKEN TO
BE IMPARTIAL AND NOT KNOW? I 

03:52:34.093 --> 03:52:36.650
DON'T THINK YOU CAN. NOW, 

03:52:40.500 --> 03:52:46.702
THEY ALSO MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT
ABUSE OF POWER IS NOT AN 

03:52:47.002 --> 03:52:49.702
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. THEY HAD TO
GO TO A CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER 

03:52:49.872 --> 03:52:54.282
TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT BECAUSE NO
REPUTABLE CONSTITUTIONAL 

03:52:58.332 --> 03:53:03.727
LAW EXPERT WOULD DO THAT. THERE 
IS A REASON JONATHAN TURLEY IS 

03:53:03.967 --> 03:53:05.967
NOT SITTING AT THE TABLE BECAUSE

03:53:08.777 --> 03:53:11.078
HE DOESN'T SUPPORT THEIR 
ARGUMENT. THEY WILL CITE HIM FOR

03:53:11.388 --> 03:53:14.398
ONE THING BUT IGNORE HIM FOR THE
OTHER. THEY SAID THE PRESIDENT 

03:53:14.878 --> 03:53:18.218
IS VERY TRANSPARENT. HE MAY HAVE
REFUSED EVERY SUBPOENA 

03:53:23.188 --> 03:53:25.188
OR DOCUMENT. HE RELEASED TWO 

03:53:27.219 --> 03:53:30.559
DOCUMENTS. LET'S FACE IT. HE WAS
FORCED TO RELEASE THE RECORD OF 

03:53:31.769 --> 03:53:36.208
THE JULY 25th CALL. WHEN HE GOT 
CAUGHT. WHEN A WHISTLE BLOWER 

03:53:36.998 --> 03:53:39.498
FILED A COMPLAINT. WHEN WE 
OPENED AN INVESTIGATION. HE WAS 

03:53:40.088 --> 03:53:44.298
FORCED BECAUSE HE GOT CAUGHT. 
YOU DON'T GET CREDIT FOR 

03:53:46.803 --> 03:53:48.803
TRANSPARENCY WHEN YOU GET 
CAUGHT. ONCE MANUFACTURE, WHAT'S

03:53:50.693 --> 03:53:53.683
REVEALED IN THAT IS DAMNING. 
THEY POINT TO THE ONLY OTHER 

03:53:53.903 --> 03:53:58.184
RECORD HE RELEASED. THAT IS 
INTERESTING TOO. THAT'S THE 

03:53:58.394 --> 03:54:00.173
CONGRATULATORY CALL. BUT WHAT'S 
INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS THE 

03:54:00.174 --> 03:54:03.874
PRESIDENT WAS URGED ON THAT CALL
TO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF 

03:54:04.704 --> 03:54:10.110
CORRUPTION. AND INDEED IN THE 
READ-OUT OF THAT CALL, THE WHITE

03:54:10.290 --> 03:54:12.290
HOUSE MISLEADINGLY SAID HE DID. 
NOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE 

03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:16.569
RECORD, WE SEE THAT HE DIDN'T. 
AND NOTWITHSTANDING COUNSEL'S 

03:54:16.799 --> 03:54:18.879
CLAIM IN THEIR TRIAL BRIEF THAT 
THE PRESIDENT RAISED THE ISSUE 

03:54:19.029 --> 03:54:22.289
OF CORRUPTION IN HIS PHONE CALL.
THE JULY 25 CALL. OF COURSE, 

03:54:22.519 --> 03:54:26.209
THAT WORD DOESN'T APPEAR IN 
EITHER CONVERSATION. AND WHY? 

03:54:26.369 --> 03:54:30.429
BECAUSE THE ONLY CORRUPTION HE 
CARED ABOUT WAS THE CORRUPTION 

03:54:31.359 --> 03:54:33.359
HE 

03:54:36.359 --> 03:54:38.359
COULD HELP BRING ABOUT. NOW. 

03:54:42.479 --> 03:54:44.479
MR.

03:54:47.674 --> 03:54:51.144
CIPOLLONE, I WOULD NOT SUGGEST 
TO YOU THAT HE WOULD 

03:54:51.904 --> 03:54:53.934
DELIBERATELY MAKE A FALSE 
STATEMENT. I WOULD LEAVE THAT TO

03:54:54.384 --> 03:54:56.384
HIM TO MAKE THE ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST 

03:55:00.794 --> 03:55:04.848
OTHERS BUT HE IS MISTAKEN. EVERY
REPUBLICAN WAS ALLOWED TO 

03:55:05.178 --> 03:55:12.708
PARTICIPATE IN THE DEPOSITIONS. 
AND THEY GOT THE SAME TIME WE 

03:55:15.191 --> 03:55:17.411
DID. YOU SHOW ME ANOTHER 
PROCEEDING THAT HAD THAT KIND OF

03:55:22.411 --> 03:55:27.392
ACCESS FOR IF OPPOSITE PARTY. 
WHAT THEY WOULD SAY WAS SOME 

03:55:27.612 --> 03:55:35.199
SECRET PROCESS. THEY WERE THE 
SAME IN THESE OTHER IMPEACHMENTS

03:55:35.349 --> 03:55:40.239
AS WELL. FINALLY, A COUPLE OF 
LAST POINTS. THEY MAKE THE 

03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:44.099
ARGUMENT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT 
ALLOWED IN THE JUDICIARY 

03:55:44.678 --> 03:55:50.598
COMMITTEE CHAIR BY MY COLLEAGUE,
CHAIRMAN NADLER. TO BE PRESENT, 

03:55:51.168 --> 03:55:53.908
TO PRESENT EVERYDAY. TO HAVE HIS
COUNSEL PRESENT. THAT IS JUST 

03:55:54.718 --> 03:55:58.439
PLAIN WRONG. JUST PLAIN WRONG. 
NOT GOING TO SUGGEST YOU ARE 

03:55:58.589 --> 03:56:03.439
BEING DELIBERATELY MISLEADING 
HERE, BUT IT IS JUST PLAIN 

03:56:03.739 --> 03:56:07.194
WRONG. YOU HAVE ALSO HEARD MY 
FRIENDS AT THE OTHER TABLE MAKE 

03:56:08.214 --> 03:56:13.304
ATTACKS ON ME AND CHAIRMAN 
NADLER. I WILL DOT DO THEM THE 

03:56:13.724 --> 03:56:16.653
DIGNITY OF RESPONDING TO THEM. 
BUT, THEY MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT 

03:56:16.813 --> 03:56:19.143
POINT, THOUGH IT IS NOT THE 
POINT I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO

03:56:20.103 --> 03:56:24.403
MAKE. WHEN YOU HEAR THEM ATTACK 
THE HOUSE MANAGERS, WHAT YOU ARE

03:56:24.613 --> 03:56:28.119
REALLY HEARING IS WE DON'T WANT 
TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

03:56:28.399 --> 03:56:31.209
GUILT. WE DON'T WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT THE MITCH MCCONNELL 

03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:36.411
RESOLUTION AND HOW PATENTLY 
UNFAIR IT IS. WE DON'T WANT TO 

03:56:36.801 --> 03:56:42.611
TALK ABOUT HOW BACK WARDS IT IS 
TO HAVE A TRIAL AND THEN ASK FOR

03:56:44.851 --> 03:56:46.851
WITNESSES. IS 

03:56:48.211 --> 03:56:53.289
NAY WILL ATTACK THE 
HOUSEMANNAGERS. MAYBE WE WILL 

03:56:54.519 --> 03:56:59.903
THINK ABOUT THEM INSTEAD OF THE 
GUILT OF THE PRESIDENT. I WANT 

03:57:00.113 --> 03:57:02.903
YOU TO ASK YOURSELVES AWAY FROM 
WHAT ISSUE ARE THEY TRYING TO 

03:57:03.073 --> 03:57:06.203
DISTRACT ME? WHAT ISSUE CAME UP 
JUST BEFORE THIS? WHAT ARE THEY 

03:57:06.503 --> 03:57:08.887
TRYING TO DEFLECT MY ATTENTION 
FROM? WHY DON'T THEY HAVE A 

03:57:09.037 --> 03:57:11.037
BETTER ARGUMENT TO 

03:57:15.597 --> 03:57:17.597
MAKE ON THE MERITS? 

03:57:19.827 --> 03:57:22.908
FINALLY, HE ASKED WHY ARE WE 
HERE. I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE

03:57:23.618 --> 03:57:25.618
THE PRESIDENT USED THE POWER OF 
HIS 

03:57:28.308 --> 03:57:34.010
OFFICE TO COERCE AN ALLY AT WAR 
WITH AN ADVERSARY AT WAR WITH 

03:57:34.310 --> 03:57:39.410
RUSSIA. USED THE POWER OF HIS 
OFFICE TO WITHHOLD MILITARY AID 

03:57:39.600 --> 03:57:42.810
WE APPROPRIATED TO DEFEND AN 
ALLY AND DEFEND OURSELVES 

03:57:43.220 --> 03:57:47.950
BECAUSE IT IS OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY AS WELL. AND WHY? TO 

03:57:48.090 --> 03:57:53.748
FIGHT CORRUPTION? THAT'S NOT 
SENSE. AND YOU KNOW IT. HE 

03:57:54.098 --> 03:57:57.358
WITHHELD THAT MONEY AND WITHHELD
MEETING WITH HIM IN THE OVAL 

03:57:57.808 --> 03:58:02.861
OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE. BECAUSE HE WANTED TO 

03:58:03.001 --> 03:58:05.311
COERCE UKRAINE INTO THESE SHAM 
INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS OPPONENT 

03:58:05.501 --> 03:58:09.771
THAT HE WAS TERRIFIED WOULD BEAT
HIM IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THAT'S

03:58:10.001 --> 03:58:12.688
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. YOU WANT TO 
SAY THAT IS OKAY? THEIR BRIEF 

03:58:12.838 --> 03:58:16.188
SAYS THAT'S OKAY. THE PRESIDENT 
HAS A RIGHT TO DO IT. ON ARTICLE

03:58:16.328 --> 03:58:19.428
2, WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS. YOU WANT TO 

03:58:19.718 --> 03:58:22.688
SAY THAT'S OKAY? YOU GOT TO SAY 
EVERY FUTURE PRESIDENT CAN COME 

03:58:22.908 --> 03:58:25.908
INTO OFFICE AND THEY CAN DO THE 
SAME THING. ARE WE PREPARED TO 

03:58:27.958 --> 03:58:33.258
SAY THAT? THAT'S WHY WE ARE 

03:58:37.302 --> 03:58:40.391
HERE. I NOW YIELD TO 
REPRESENTATIVE. 

03:58:40.392 --> 03:58:44.535
&gt;&gt;  MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. SENATORS,
COUNCIL FOR THE PRESIDENT. THE 

03:58:44.815 --> 03:58:47.605
HOUSE MANAGERS STRONGLY SUPPORT 
SENATOR SCHUMER'S AMENDMENT 

03:58:48.405 --> 03:58:50.405
WHICH WOULD ENSURE A FAIR, 

03:58:53.805 --> 03:58:58.158
LEGITIMATE TRIAL BASED ON A FULL
RECORD. THE SENATE CAN REMEDY 

03:58:58.298 --> 03:59:01.458
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED 
COVER-UP BY TAKING A 

03:59:02.108 --> 03:59:05.913
STRAIGHTFORWARD STEP. IT CAN ASK
FOR THE KEY EVIDENCE THAT THE 

03:59:07.023 --> 03:59:09.033
PRESIDENT HAS IMPROPERLY 
BLOCKED. SENATOR SCHUMER'S 

03:59:09.903 --> 03:59:12.723
AMENDMENT DOES JUST THAT. THE 
AMENDMENT AUTHORIZES THE 

03:59:13.033 --> 03:59:16.616
SUBPOENA FOR WHITE HOUSE 
DOCUMENTS THAT ARE DIRECTLY 

03:59:17.716 --> 03:59:21.016
RELEVANT TO THIS CASE. THESE 
DOCUMENTS FOCUS ON THE 

03:59:21.696 --> 03:59:26.843
PRESIDENT'S SCHEME TO STRONG ARM
UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE AN 

03:59:27.523 --> 03:59:30.603
INVESTIGATION INTO HIS POLITICAL
OPPONENT, TO INTERFERE WITH THE 

03:59:30.753 --> 03:59:34.003
2020 ELECTION. THE DOCUMENTS 
WILL REVEAL THE EXTENT OF THE 

03:59:34.323 --> 03:59:40.011
WHITE HOUSE'S COORDINATION WITH 
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENTS SUCH AS 

03:59:40.421 --> 03:59:43.621
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND RUDY 
GIULIANI. WHO PUSHED THE 

03:59:43.761 --> 03:59:49.065
PRESIDENT'S SO-CALLED DRUG DEAL 
ON UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS. THE 

03:59:49.325 --> 03:59:51.325
DOCUMENTS WILL ALSO 

03:59:54.545 --> 03:59:56.545
SHOW US HOW KEY 

04:00:00.225 --> 04:00:02.914
PLAYERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
HELPED SET UP THE DEAL BY 

04:00:03.734 --> 04:00:08.914
EXECUTING THE FREEZE ON ALL 
MILITARY AID AND WITHHOLDING A 

04:00:09.074 --> 04:00:11.074
PROMISED VISIT TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. THE DOCUMENTS INCLUDE 

04:00:11.206 --> 04:00:15.436
RECORDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO MAY 
HAVE OBJECTED TO THIS SCHEME 

04:00:15.836 --> 04:00:19.046
SUCH AS AMBASSADOR BOLTON. THIS 
IS AN IMPORTANT IMPEACHMENT CASE

04:00:19.646 --> 04:00:22.661
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. THE MOST 
IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS ARE GOING TO

04:00:22.931 --> 04:00:26.841
BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE 
DOCUMENTS, SENATOR SCHUMER'S 

04:00:26.981 --> 04:00:32.011
AMENDMENT TARGETS, WOULD PROVIDE
MORE CLARITY AND CONTEXT ABOUT 

04:00:32.798 --> 04:00:35.708
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SCHEME. THE 
AMENDMENT PREVENTS THE PRESIDENT

04:00:35.908 --> 04:00:40.128
FROM HIDING EVIDENCE AS HE HAS 
PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO DO. NOW, THE

04:00:41.038 --> 04:00:44.014
HOUSE SUBPOENAED THESE DOCUMENTS
AS PART OF THE IMPEACHMENT 

04:00:44.514 --> 04:00:48.154
INQUIRY. BUT THE PRESIDENT 
COMPLETELY REJECTED THIS. AND, 

04:00:48.304 --> 04:00:51.404
EVERY DOCUMENT SUBPOENAED FROM 
THE HOUSE. AS POWERFUL AS OUR 

04:00:52.194 --> 04:00:57.847
EVIDENCE IS, AND MAKE NO 
MISTAKE, IT OVERWHELMINGLY 

04:00:58.007 --> 04:01:01.327
PROVING HIS GUILT. WE DID NOT 
RECEIVE A SINGLE DOCUMENT FROM 

04:01:02.017 --> 04:01:06.836
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCY 
INCLUDING THE WHITE HOUSE 

04:01:07.536 --> 04:01:09.736
ITSELF. RECENT REVELATIONS FROM 
PRESS REPORTS, FREEDOM OF 

04:01:11.646 --> 04:01:15.323
INFORMATION ACT REQUEST, 
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES LIKE LEV 

04:01:15.483 --> 04:01:17.743
PARNAS UNDERSCORE HOW 

04:01:21.743 --> 04:01:23.743
RELEASED 

04:01:24.823 --> 04:01:28.813
VENT THESE DOCUMENTS AND WHY THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SO DESPERATE 

04:01:29.003 --> 04:01:32.053
TO HIDE THEM. A TRIAL WITHOUT 
ALL THE EVIDENCE WOULD BE AN 

04:01:32.333 --> 04:01:35.313
UNFAIR TRIAL. IT IS WRONG FOR 
YOU AS SENATORS AND ACTING 

04:01:35.613 --> 04:01:41.513
JUDGES TO BE DEPRIVED WHEN YOU 
ARE JUDGING THESE MOST SERIOUS 

04:01:41.733 --> 04:01:46.408
CHARGES. IT WOULD ALSO BE UNFAIR
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO 

04:01:47.018 --> 04:01:49.818
OVERWHELMINGLY BELIEVE THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD PRODUCE RECALL 

04:01:51.008 --> 04:01:53.008
RELEVANT DOCUMENTS AND EVIDENCE.
NOW, DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE IS 

04:01:55.158 --> 04:02:00.627
USED IN ALL TRIALS. FOR SIMPLE 
REASON. AS THE STORY GOES, THE 

04:02:01.013 --> 04:02:04.081
DOCUMENTS DON'T LIE. DOCUMENTS 
GIVE OBJECTIVE REALTIME INSIGHT 

04:02:05.330 --> 04:02:09.003
INTO THE EVENTS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION. THE NEED FOR SUCH

04:02:09.223 --> 04:02:15.419
EVIDENCE IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT
IN SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIALS. 

04:02:15.579 --> 04:02:19.936
MORE THAN 200 YEARS OF SENATE 
PRACTICE MAKE CLEAR THAT 

04:02:20.164 --> 04:02:22.867
DOCUMENTS ARE GENERALLY THE 
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS. THEY 

04:02:24.871 --> 04:02:28.719
HAVE BEEN PRESENTED OF THE 
SENATE BEFORE WITNESSES TAKE THE

04:02:28.870 --> 04:02:32.394
STAND IN GREAT VOLUME TO MAKE 
SURE THE SENATE HAS THE EVIDENCE

04:02:34.494 --> 04:02:38.426
IT NEEDS TO EVALUATE THE CASE. 
IT HAS NEVER BEEN LIMITED TO THE

04:02:39.336 --> 04:02:44.770
DOCUMENTS SENT BY THE HOUSE. THE
SENATE THROUGHOUT ITS EXISTENCE 

04:02:44.940 --> 04:02:48.582
HAS EXERCISED ITS AUTHORITY 
PURSUANT TO ITS CLEAR RULES OF 

04:02:48.783 --> 04:02:52.574
PROCEDURE TO SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS 
AT THE OUTSET OF THE TRIAL. WE 

04:02:52.714 --> 04:02:57.484
DON'T KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHAT 
THE DOCUMENTS WILL SAY. WE 

04:02:58.144 --> 04:03:02.369
SIMPLY WANT THE TRUTH. WHATEVER 
THAT TRUTH MAY BE. SO DO THE 

04:03:02.509 --> 04:03:04.666
AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO 
KNOW THE TRUTH AND SO SHOULD 

04:03:05.096 --> 04:03:09.087
EVERYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER 
REGARDLESS OF OUR PARTY 

04:03:09.367 --> 04:03:12.077
AFFILIATION. THEY ARE A KEY 
REASON WHY THIS AMENDMENT IS 

04:03:12.277 --> 04:03:15.267
NECESSARY. WE WILL BEGIN BY 
WALKING THROUGH THE HISTORY AND 

04:03:16.477 --> 04:03:18.947
PRESENCE DENT OF SENATE 
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS. I WILL LET 

04:03:19.286 --> 04:03:21.846
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HOUSE'S 
EFFORTS TO GET THE DOCUMENTS MET

04:03:22.026 --> 04:03:27.500
BY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION'S CATEGORICAL 

04:03:27.700 --> 04:03:30.412
COMMITMENT TO HIDE ALL THE 
EVIDENCE AT ALL COSTS AND WE 

04:03:30.712 --> 04:03:35.242
WILL ADDRESS A SPECIFIC NEED FOR
THESE SUBPOENAED WHITE HOUSE 

04:03:35.412 --> 04:03:37.602
DOCUMENTS. I WILL TELL YOU WHY 
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE NEEDED NOW. 

04:03:37.752 --> 04:03:42.837
NOT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. IN 
ORDER TO ENSURE A FULL, FAIR 

04:03:46.757 --> 04:03:49.847
TRIAL BASED ON A COMPLETE 
EVIDENCE RECORD. SOME HAVE 

04:03:50.061 --> 04:03:53.727
SUGGESTED INCORRECTLY THAT THE 
SENATE IS LIMITED ONLY TO 

04:03:55.160 --> 04:03:58.371
EVIDENCE GATHERED BEFORE THE 
HOUSE 

04:04:03.120 --> 04:04:07.215
APPROVED THE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THESE CLAIMS ARE 

04:04:07.525 --> 04:04:10.465
WITHOUT ANY HISTORICAL 
PRESIDENTIAL OR LEGAL 

04:04:15.415 --> 04:04:20.172
SUPPORT. OVER THE PAST TO 
CENTURIES THE SENATE UNDERSTOOD 

04:04:21.492 --> 04:04:23.371
ITS SOLE TRIAL TO EMPOWER 
IMPEACHMENT REQUIRES THE SENATE 

04:04:23.372 --> 04:04:29.543
TO SIT AS THE COURT OF 
IMPEACHMENT AND HOLD A TRIAL. IN

04:04:29.683 --> 04:04:35.553
FACT, THE FOUNDERS ASSIGNED SOLE
AUTHORITY ONLY TWICE IN THE 

04:04:35.793 --> 04:04:38.895
CONSTITUTION. FIRST GIVERRING 
THE HOUSE SOLE AUTHORITY TO 

04:04:39.175 --> 04:04:41.905
IMPEACH. AND GIVING THE SENATE 
SOLE AUTHORITY TO TRY THAT 

04:04:42.055 --> 04:04:44.335
IMPEACHMENT. IF THE FOUNDERS HAD
INTENDED FOR THE SENATE TO SERVE

04:04:44.795 --> 04:04:50.262
AS SOME KIND OF APPELLATE BODY, 
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID THAT. BUT 

04:04:50.902 --> 04:04:54.010
NO. INSTEAD THEY WROTE THIS. 
ARTICLE ONE, SECTION 3. THE 

04:04:54.180 --> 04:04:59.095
SENATE SHALL HAVE THE SOLE POWER
TO TRY ALL IMPEACHMENTS. THE 

04:04:59.245 --> 04:05:02.155
SENATE HAS ALWAYS RECEIVED THE 
RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN 

04:05:02.555 --> 04:05:06.555
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS AND INDEED, 
THE SENATE'S OWN RULES OF 

04:05:06.865 --> 04:05:11.446
PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE MAY CLEAR
THAT NEW EVIDENCE WILL BE 

04:05:11.746 --> 04:05:16.057
CONSIDERED. PRECEDENT SHOWS 
THIS. ALL 15 FULL SENATE 

04:05:17.971 --> 04:05:19.971
IMPEACHMENT 

04:05:21.481 --> 04:05:24.924
TRIALS CONSIDERED NEW  EVIDENCE.
THE FIRST EVER PRESIDENTIAL 

04:05:25.114 --> 04:05:28.904
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN 1868 
AGAINST PRESIDENT ANDREW JOHNSON

04:05:29.064 --> 04:05:34.779
ALLOWED THE HOUSE MANAGERS TO 
SPEND THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE 

04:05:35.199 --> 04:05:37.229
TRIAL INTRODUCING NEW 
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. IT WAS THE

04:05:38.699 --> 04:05:42.533
SAME IN JUDGE JOHN PICKERRING'S 
TRIAL IN 1804. NEW DOCUMENTS 

04:05:42.663 --> 04:05:45.733
WERE PRESENTED TO THE SENATE 
NEARLY A WEEK BEFORE HOUSE 

04:05:46.103 --> 04:05:50.483
MANAGERS MADE THEIR OPENING 
STATEMENT. AND LATER THROUGHOUT 

04:05:51.083 --> 04:05:55.790
THE TRIAL. AND AS MENTIONED 
EARLIER BY  MR. SCHIFF, IN 

04:05:56.710 --> 04:06:00.870
MODERN TIMES IN 2010, JUDGE 
PORTIER'S TRIAL INCLUDED SEVEN 

04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:04.783
MONTHS OF PRETRIAL DISCOVERY AND
6,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTARY 

04:06:05.203 --> 04:06:10.493
EVIDENCE ADMITTED AT TRIAL AFTER
THAT EVIDENCE WAS ADMITTED, THE 

04:06:11.083 --> 04:06:14.589
SENATE HELD ITS TRIAL. PRESIDENT
CLINTON'S CASE DID NOT INVOLVE 

04:06:14.989 --> 04:06:21.799
SUBPOENAS FOR DOCUMENTS. AND WHY
WAS THAT? BECAUSE PRESIDENT 

04:06:22.249 --> 04:06:24.943
CLINTON HAD ALREADY INTRODUCED A
HUGE TROVE OF DOCUMENTS. THE 

04:06:25.113 --> 04:06:29.343
COUNSEL TURNED OVER TO CONGRESS 
SOME 90,000 PAGES OF RELEVANT 

04:06:29.583 --> 04:06:31.973
DOCUMENTS GATHERED DURING THE 
COURSE OF HIS YEARS LONG 

04:06:32.193 --> 04:06:34.718
INVESTIGATION. AND I REMEMBER AS
A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY 

04:06:34.858 --> 04:06:38.808
COMMITTEE GOING OVER TO THE FORD
BUILDING, LOOKING AT THE BOXES 

04:06:38.998 --> 04:06:43.858
OF THE DOCUMENTS. BUT, EVEN WITH
ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS, THE CLINTON

04:06:44.108 --> 04:06:47.286
TRIAL INCLUDED THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO PRESENT NEW EVIDENCE. AND, 

04:06:47.616 --> 04:06:52.406
THE ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL 
DOCUMENTS AND THREE WITNESSES. 

04:06:52.546 --> 04:06:55.783
THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT 
PRECEDENT ALSO SHOWS HOW 

04:06:56.133 --> 04:06:58.993
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REFUSAL TO 
PRODUCE ANY RELEVANT DOCUMENTS 

04:07:00.503 --> 04:07:04.403
IN RESPONSE TO CONGRESSIONAL 
SUBPOENAS IS DIFFERENT THAN PAST

04:07:04.923 --> 04:07:09.735
PRESIDENTS. DIFFERENT FROM 
PRESIDENT CLINTON. DIFFERENT 

04:07:09.875 --> 04:07:13.515
FROM PRESIDENT JOHNSON. AND, 
EVEN PRESIDENT NIXON. NOT A 

04:07:13.905 --> 04:07:15.905
SINGLE PRESIDENT HAS 
CATEGORICALLY REFUSED TO 

04:07:16.605 --> 04:07:19.383
COOPERATE WITH AN IMPEACHMENT 
INVESTIGATION. NOT A SINGLE 

04:07:20.013 --> 04:07:23.713
PRESIDENT HAS ISSUED A BLANKET 
DIRECTION TO HIS ADMINISTRATION 

04:07:24.093 --> 04:07:29.618
TO PRODUCE NO DOCUMENTS. AND NO 
WITNESSES. THESE ARE THE 

04:07:29.828 --> 04:07:34.421
PRECEDENTS A SENATE MUST RELY 
ON. THE SENATE SHOULD ISSUE A 

04:07:34.691 --> 04:07:38.131
SUBPOENA FOR DOCUMENTS AT THE 
OUTSET OF THE PROCEEDINGS SO 

04:07:38.271 --> 04:07:43.297
THAT THIS BODY, THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS, THE PRESIDENT, CAN ALL

04:07:43.587 --> 04:07:50.311
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE DOCUMENTS IN 
THEIR PRESENTATIONS AND 

04:07:50.471 --> 04:07:52.691
DELIBERATIONS. IT DOESN'T MAKE 
SENSE TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE 

04:07:52.841 --> 04:07:56.801
DOCUMENTS AFTER THE PARTIES 
PRESENT THEIR CASES. THE TIME IS

04:07:57.201 --> 04:08:01.285
NOW TO DO THAT. SO WHY IS THE 
AMENDMENT NEEDED TO PREVENT 

04:08:01.505 --> 04:08:05.785
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM CONTINUING 
HIS CATEGORICAL COMMITMENT TO 

04:08:06.315 --> 04:08:09.427
HIDE THE EVIDENCE? IN THIS CASE,
THE HOUSE SOUGHT WHITE HOUSE 

04:08:09.827 --> 04:08:11.827
DOCUMENTS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE 
THEM? NOT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TRY.

04:08:11.912 --> 04:08:15.994
IT IS BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE 
REFUSED TO GIVE THEM TO US. THE 

04:08:16.144 --> 04:08:19.422
PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE TEAM SEEMS 
TO BELIEVE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

04:08:19.612 --> 04:08:24.182
IS PERMITTED TO COMPLETELY 
REFUSE TO PROVIDE ANY DOCUMENTS 

04:08:24.332 --> 04:08:28.362
WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT
IT IS PRIVILEGED. THEY 

04:08:28.502 --> 04:08:30.502
APPARENTLY BELIEVE THAT 
CONGRESS' AUTHORITY IS SUBJECT 

04:08:32.357 --> 04:08:36.347
TO THE APPROVAL OF THE 
PRESIDENT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT 

04:08:36.717 --> 04:08:38.486
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS. OUR 
CONSTITUTION SETS FORTH A 

04:08:38.487 --> 04:08:43.534
DEMOCRACY WITH A SYSTEM OF 
CHECKS AND BALANCES TO ENSURE 

04:08:43.704 --> 04:08:50.224
THAT NO ONE, CERTAINLY NOT THE 
PRESIDENT, IS ABOVE THE LAW. 

04:08:50.410 --> 04:08:52.660
NOW, EVEN PRESIDENT NIXON 
PRODUCED MORE THAN 30 

04:08:52.930 --> 04:08:57.020
TRANSCRIPTS OF WHITE HOUSE 
RECORDINGS AN NOTES FOR MEETING 

04:08:57.220 --> 04:09:00.753
WITH THE PRESIDENT. HERE, EVEN 
BEFORE THE HOUSE LAUNCHED 

04:09:01.113 --> 04:09:03.113
INVESTIGATION THAT LED TO 

04:09:05.043 --> 04:09:07.423
THIS TRIAL, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REJECTED CONGRESS' 

04:09:07.583 --> 04:09:11.815
CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO
USE ITS LAWFUL AUTHORITY TO 

04:09:11.965 --> 04:09:15.025
INVESTIGATE HIS ACTIONS. HE 
ASSERTED HI ADMINISTRATION WAS 

04:09:15.745 --> 04:09:19.323
FIGHTING ALL THE SUBPOENAS. 
PROCLAIMING I HAVE AN ARTICLE 2.

04:09:19.483 --> 04:09:26.133
OR I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO 
WHATEVER I WANT AS PRESIDENT. 

04:09:26.283 --> 04:09:28.923
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID. 
&gt;&gt; THEN I HAVE AN ARTICLE 2 

04:09:29.143 --> 04:09:36.475
WHERE I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO 
WHATEVER I WANT AS PRESIDENT. 

04:09:36.615 --> 04:09:41.025
&gt;&gt; EVEN AFTER THE HOUSE FORMALLY
ANNOUNCED THE INVESTIGATION IN 

04:09:41.535 --> 04:09:44.823
UKRAINE, THE PRESIDENT STILL 
CONTINUED HIS OBSTRUCTION 

04:09:46.443 --> 04:09:48.453
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 9, 2019. THE
HOUSE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE 

04:09:49.143 --> 04:09:52.883
MADE TWO ATTEMPTS TO VOLUNTARILY
OBTAIN DOCUMENTS FROM THE WHITE 

04:09:53.183 --> 04:09:57.951
HOUSE. THE WHITE HOUSE REFUSED 
TO ENGAGE WITH OR FRANKLY 

04:09:58.761 --> 04:10:01.301
RESPOND FOUNDER THE HOUSE 
COMMITTEES. ON OCTOBER 4, THE 

04:10:01.951 --> 04:10:07.897
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND
REFORM SENT A SUBPOENA TO WHITE 

04:10:08.047 --> 04:10:12.857
HOUSE ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MICK
MULVANEY. THIS TIME COMPELLING 

04:10:13.057 --> 04:10:16.040
THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS BY 
OCTOBER 18. ON OCTOBER 8 BEFORE 

04:10:16.180 --> 04:10:20.230
THE WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS WERE 
DUE, THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL 

04:10:21.240 --> 04:10:25.882
SENT A LETTER TO SPEAKER PELOSI 
STATING THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION

04:10:26.022 --> 04:10:30.442
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION CANNOT 

04:10:31.452 --> 04:10:33.452
PARTICIPATE IN THIS 

04:10:36.052 --> 04:10:38.559
PARTISAN INQUIRY UNDER THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. HE SIMPLY 

04:10:38.699 --> 04:10:41.149
DECLARED HE WOULD NOT 
PARTICIPATE IN AN INVESTIGATION 

04:10:41.559 --> 04:10:44.269
HE DIDN'T LIKE. TEN DAYS LATER 
ON OCTOBER 18, THE WHITE HOUSE 

04:10:44.529 --> 04:10:49.869
COUNSEL SENT A LETTER TO THE 
HOUSE CONFIRMING IT IS WOULD 

04:10:50.049 --> 04:10:53.259
CONTINUE TO STONEWALL. THE 
COUNSEL AGAIN STATED THE 

04:10:55.139 --> 04:11:00.356
PRESIDENT REFUSED TO 
PARTICIPATE. WELL, THE 

04:11:00.496 --> 04:11:03.356
CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE 1 SECTION 
2 SAYS THE HOUSE WILL HAVE THE 

04:11:04.136 --> 04:11:06.836
SOLE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT. JUST 
AS ARTICLE 1 SECTION 3, THE 

04:11:07.036 --> 04:11:12.749
SENATE HAS THE SOLE POWER TO 
TRY. PARTICIPATION IN A DUALLY 

04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:14.998
AUTHORIZED CONGRESSIONAL 
INVESTIGATION IS NOT OPTIONAL. 

04:11:14.999 --> 04:11:19.445
IT IS NOT UP TO THE PRESIDENT TO
DECIDE WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE OR

04:11:19.655 --> 04:11:22.245
NOT. THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE 
HOUSE THE SOLE POWER OF 

04:11:22.385 --> 04:11:26.935
IMPEACHMENT, IT GIVES THE SENATE
THE SOLE POWER OF TRY ON 

04:11:27.235 --> 04:11:33.077
IMPEACHMENT. THE PRESIDENT MAY 
NOT LIKE BEING IMPEACHED. BUT 

04:11:33.237 --> 04:11:37.167
IT'S THE PRESIDENT, NOT THE 
CONGRESS DECIDES WHEN 

04:11:37.957 --> 04:11:39.536
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS ARE 
APPROPRIATE, THEN, THE 

04:11:39.537 --> 04:11:48.057
IMPEACHMENT POWER IS NO POWER AT
ALL. IF YOU LET HIM BLOCK FROM 

04:11:48.537 --> 04:11:52.051
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, THE EVIDENCE TO COVER UP

04:11:52.331 --> 04:11:54.791
HIS OFFENSES, THEN, THE 
IMPEACHMENT POWER TRULY WILL BE 

04:11:54.971 --> 04:12:00.031
MEANINGLESS. 
WITH ALL THE BACK AND FORTH 

04:12:01.746 --> 04:12:04.976
ABOUT THESE DOCUMENTS, WE HEARD 
THE PHRASE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 

04:12:05.116 --> 04:12:10.136
THEY TALK ABOUT VAST LEGAL 
RIGHTS TO JUSTIFY HIDING THE 

04:12:10.347 --> 04:12:13.377
TRUTH, WITHHOLDING INFORMATION. 
BUT THAT'S A DISTRACTION. THAT'S

04:12:13.827 --> 04:12:15.947
NOT WHAT THE CONSTITUTION 
PROVIDES AND THE TRUTH IS AS 

04:12:17.157 --> 04:12:20.610
MENTIONED BY  MR. SCHIFF, IN THE
COURSE OF THE ENTIRE IMPEACHMENT

04:12:20.760 --> 04:12:24.240
INQUIRY, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT
ONCE ASSERTED EXECUTIVE 

04:12:24.430 --> 04:12:29.240
PRIVILEGE. NOT A SINGLE TIME. IT
WAS NOT THE REASON 

04:12:32.360 --> 04:12:38.599
PROVIDED BY  MR. CIPOLLONI FOR 
REFUSING TO COMPLY. HE DID NOT 

04:12:39.079 --> 04:12:42.189
OFFER LEGAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR 
WITHHOLDING THE EVIDENCE. HERE'S

04:12:42.369 --> 04:12:45.593
THE TRUTH. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, 
JUDGES T SUPREME COURT, AND THE 

04:12:45.833 --> 04:12:49.433
PRESIDENT, HAVE RECOGNIZED 
THROUGHOUT OUR NATION'S HISTORY 

04:12:49.743 --> 04:12:52.303
THAT CONGRESS' INVESTIGATIVE 
POWER ARE AT THEIR 

04:12:57.153 --> 04:13:00.344
ABSOLUTE PEAK DURING IMPEACHMENT
PROCEEDINGS. YOUR POWERS, 

04:13:00.484 --> 04:13:03.944
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CANNOT BE A 
BARRIER TO GIVE ABSOLUTE SECRECY

04:13:04.364 --> 04:13:06.974
TO COVER UP WRONG DOING. IF IT 
DID, THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE 

04:13:09.054 --> 04:13:13.077
WOULD SEE THEIR POWER DISAPPEAR.
WHEN PRESIDENT NIXON TRIED THAT 

04:13:13.257 --> 04:13:18.487
ARGUMENT BY REFUSING TO PRODUCE 
TAPE RECORDINGS TO PROSECUTORS 

04:13:18.647 --> 04:13:24.000
AND TO CONGRESS HE WAS SOUNDLY 
REBUKED BY THE OTHER TWO 

04:13:24.150 --> 04:13:28.080
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. THE 
SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY RULED 

04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:31.983
AGAINST HIM. THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE VOTED HE BE IMPEACHED 

04:13:32.133 --> 04:13:34.193
FOR OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS. IT 
WOULD BE REMARKABLE FOR THE 

04:13:34.373 --> 04:13:37.793
UNITED STATES SENATE TO DECLARE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR 

04:13:37.973 --> 04:13:40.803
NATION'S HISTORY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS A ABSOLUTE RIGHT 

04:13:41.364 --> 04:13:45.414
TO DECIDE WHETHER HIS OWN 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS LEGITIMATE.

04:13:45.554 --> 04:13:52.858
AND IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY 
FOR THE SENATE TO REFUSE TO SEEK

04:13:53.008 --> 04:13:57.078
IMPORTANT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE, 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

04:13:57.408 --> 04:14:00.578
HAS YET TO ASSERT ANY PRIVILEGE 
JUSTIFYING THE WITHHOLDING OF 

04:14:00.908 --> 04:14:03.294
THE DOCUMENTS. THERE IS ANOTHER 
REASON THIS AMENDMENT IS 

04:14:05.484 --> 04:14:08.724
IMPORTANT. THE DOCUMENTS SOUGHT 
ARE DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE 

04:14:08.864 --> 04:14:11.224
PRESIDENT'S MISCONDUCT. THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS CONCEALING 

04:14:11.364 --> 04:14:13.627
DOCUMENTS INVOLVING OFFICIALS 
WHO HAVE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF KEY

04:14:13.777 --> 04:14:20.207
EVENTS AT THE HEART OF THIS 
TRIAL. THIS ISN'T JUST A GUESS. 

04:14:20.347 --> 04:14:22.927
WE KNOW THESE DOCUMENTS EXIST 
FROM THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED

04:14:23.077 --> 04:14:28.949
IN THE HOUSE AND FROM OTHER 
PUBLIC RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS. AND

04:14:29.089 --> 04:14:30.408
LET'S WALK THROUGH THOSE 
SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS THAT THE 

04:14:30.409 --> 04:14:36.034
WHITE HOUSE SHOULD SEND TO THE 
SENATE. THEY INCLUDE AMONG OTHER

04:14:36.484 --> 04:14:40.914
DOCUMENTS, RELATING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS 

04:14:41.894 --> 04:14:45.399
WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REQUEST FOR 

04:14:45.689 --> 04:14:49.589
POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS 
INCLUDING COMMUNICATIONS WITH 

04:14:49.779 --> 04:14:52.319
RUDY GIULIANI, AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND, AND OTHERS. PRESIDENT 

04:14:55.899 --> 04:14:58.624
TRUMP'S UNLANDFALL HOLD OF THE 
$391 MILLION OF MILITARY AID. 

04:14:58.784 --> 04:15:04.484
CONCERNS THAT WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS REPORTED TO NFC LEGAL 

04:15:05.994 --> 04:15:11.702
COUNSEL IN REALTIME T. DECISION 
TO CALL AMBASSADOR MARIE 

04:15:12.292 --> 04:15:14.292
YOVANOVITCH FROM UKRAINE. THE 
SENATE SHOULD GET ABOUT 

04:15:14.692 --> 04:15:16.692
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMUNICATIONS

04:15:19.398 --> 04:15:24.427
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, 
THE PHONE CALLS ON APRIL 21 AND 

04:15:24.587 --> 04:15:28.781
JULY 25. AS WELL AS THE 
SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 MEETING WITH 

04:15:29.073 --> 04:15:35.916
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IN NEW YORK. 
WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT NSC 

04:15:36.339 --> 04:15:38.249
OFFICIALS PREPARED TALKING 
POINTS FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 

04:15:38.250 --> 04:15:40.924
PREPARATION FOR BOTH CALLS WITH 
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. THE 

04:15:41.075 --> 04:15:45.269
TALKING POINTS WERE ABOUT 
AMERICAN POLICY. AS REFLECTED BY

04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:51.915
THE VOTES OF CONGRESS AS WELL AS
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ITSELF.

04:15:52.066 --> 04:15:56.632
THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY MENTION 
OF THE BIDENS WITH THE 2016 

04:15:56.854 --> 04:15:58.854
ELECTION INTERFERENCE OR 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

04:16:00.283 --> 04:16:06.232
TRUMP REQUESTED ON THE JULY 25 
CALL. HERE IS A CLIP OF 

04:16:06.423 --> 04:16:08.383
LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN 
EXPLAINING THOUSAND PRESIDENT 

04:16:08.384 --> 04:16:11.905
IGNORED THE POINTS ABOUT 
AMERICAN POLICY REFLECTING THE 

04:16:12.096 --> 04:16:14.096
VIEWS OF BOTH 

04:16:17.527 --> 04:16:19.527
CONGRESS AND THE TRUMP 

04:16:22.556 --> 04:16:27.561
ADMINISTRATION. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; IF I COULD TURN YOUR 

04:16:27.712 --> 04:16:32.047
ATTENTION TO THE APRIL 21 CALL 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

04:16:32.298 --> 04:16:35.151
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. DID YOU 
PREPARE TALKING POINTS FOR THE 

04:16:35.291 --> 04:16:37.895
PRESIDENT TO USE IN THAT CALL? 
&gt;&gt; YES I DID. 

04:16:37.896 --> 04:16:40.480
&gt;&gt; DID THEY INCLUDE ROOTING OUT 
CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE? 

04:16:40.481 --> 04:16:42.029
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS SOMETHING THE 

04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:47.598
PRESIDENT WAS SUPPOSED TO RAISE 
IN THE CONVERSATION WITH 

04:16:48.413 --> 04:16:50.827
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY? 
&gt;&gt; THOSE WERE THE RECOMMENDED 

04:16:52.908 --> 04:16:56.411
TALKING POINTS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. YES. 

04:16:56.412 --> 04:16:59.895
&gt;&gt; THE MATERIALS PROVIDED FOR 
THE JULY 25 CALL THAT LIEUTENANT

04:17:00.408 --> 04:17:03.928
COLONEL VINDMAN MENTIONED ARE 
HIGHLY RELEVANT. THEY COULD HELP

04:17:04.239 --> 04:17:07.668
CONFIRM THE PRESIDENT'S ACTUAL 
STATEMENTS, THAT TO PRESIDENT 

04:17:07.809 --> 04:17:11.581
ZELENSKY WERE UNRELATED TO THE 
FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES OF HIS

04:17:11.822 --> 04:17:14.598
OWN ADMINISTRATION AND SHOW THEY
SERVED HIS OWN PERSONAL INTEREST

04:17:15.211 --> 04:17:17.211
AT THE EXPENSE 

04:17:20.341 --> 04:17:23.026
OF AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY 
INTERESTS. THESE DOCUMENTS 

04:17:23.197 --> 04:17:25.369
INCLUDE HANDWRITTEN NOTES AND 
OTHER DOCUMENTS WHITE HOUSE 

04:17:25.571 --> 04:17:30.026
OFFICIALS GENERATED DURING THE 
CALLS AND MEETING. WE KNOW THAT 

04:17:30.177 --> 04:17:36.231
LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN,  MR.
MORRISON, JENNIFER WILLIAMS, ALL

04:17:36.644 --> 04:17:38.644
TESTIFIED TO TAKING 
CONTEMPORANEOUS HANDWRITTEN 

04:17:38.745 --> 04:17:43.693
NOTES DURING THE JULY 25 CALL. 
MS. WILLIAMS AND LIEUTENANT 

04:17:43.995 --> 04:17:48.128
COLONEL VINDMAN BOTH TESTIFIED 
THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY MADE AN 

04:17:48.269 --> 04:17:50.733
EXPLICIT REFERENCE THAT WAS NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE MEMORANDUM THAT 

04:17:50.934 --> 04:17:54.686
THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED TO THE 
PUBLIC. HERE IS 

04:17:58.669 --> 04:18:05.005
A CLIP OF THEIR TESTIMONY. 
&gt;&gt; BOTH OF YOU RECALL PRESIDENT 

04:18:06.111 --> 04:18:10.546
ZELENSKY IN THAT CONVERSATION 
RAISING THE ISSUE OR 

04:18:15.495 --> 04:18:17.526
MENTIONING BARISMA. YET IT 
APPEARS NOWHERE IN THE CALL 

04:18:18.301 --> 04:18:21.236
RECORD RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

04:18:21.237 --> 04:18:23.299
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 
&gt;&gt; WHY YOU NEED DOCUMENTS 

04:18:23.440 --> 04:18:28.318
GENERATED AFTER THE CALLS IN 
MEETINGS? IT WOULD SHED LIGHT ON

04:18:28.961 --> 04:18:31.667
HOW THESE EVENTS WERE PERCEIVED 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE OF WHAT 

04:18:32.471 --> 04:18:36.706
ACTIONS WERE TAKEN MOVING 
FORWARD. FOR EXAM 38, NATIONAL 

04:18:36.846 --> 04:18:40.507
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON WAS
NOT ON THE JULY 25 CALL BUT HE 

04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:43.464
WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE CONTENT 
OF THE CALL AFTERWARD. HIS 

04:18:44.158 --> 04:18:49.177
REACTION, ONCE HE WAS INFORMED, 
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO 

04:18:49.368 --> 04:18:54.497
UNDERSTANDING THE EXTENT TO 
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACTION 

04:18:54.638 --> 04:18:56.911
DEVIATED FROM AMERICAN POLICY 
AND AMERICAN SECURITY INTEREST. 

04:18:57.052 --> 04:19:00.833
THERE IS ANOTHER SET OF 
DOCUMENTS THE SENATE SHOULD GET 

04:19:01.638 --> 04:19:03.638
RELATED TO THE POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

04:19:03.649 --> 04:19:08.588
TRUMP AND HIS AGENTS REPEATEDLY 
ASK UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS TO 

04:19:08.799 --> 04:19:12.319
ANNOUNCE. THESE DOCUMENTS ABOUT 
EFFORTS TO PRESSURE UKRAINE TO 

04:19:12.681 --> 04:19:17.529
ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATIONS AND THE 
DECISION TO PLACE A HOLD ON 

04:19:17.820 --> 04:19:25.001
MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE. IT 
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU 

04:19:25.373 --> 04:19:28.602
TO EVALUATE THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONDUCT. AMBASSADOR BOLTON IS A 

04:19:29.095 --> 04:19:31.358
FIRSTHAND WITNESS TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S ABUSE OF POWER. HE 

04:19:31.699 --> 04:19:33.721
REPORTED DIRECTLY TO THE 
PRESIDENT. HE SUPERVISED THE 

04:19:34.234 --> 04:19:36.234
ENTIRE STAFF 

04:19:37.533 --> 04:19:41.174
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
COUNCIL. PUBLIC REPORTS INDICATE

04:19:41.314 --> 04:19:44.161
HE IS A VORACIOUS NOTE TAKER 
EVERY MEETING. FROM WITNESS 

04:19:44.573 --> 04:19:50.426
TESTIMONY, WE KNOW AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON HOSTED THE JULY 10, 2019 

04:19:50.607 --> 04:19:53.132
MEETING WHERE AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND TOLD UKRAINIAN 

04:19:53.323 --> 04:19:57.064
OFFICIALS THAT THE PROMISED 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING WOULD BE 

04:19:57.225 --> 04:19:59.579
SCHEDULED IF THEY ANNOUNCE THE 
INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW BOLTON 

04:20:00.182 --> 04:20:03.752
WAS BRIEFED ABOUT THIS MEETING 
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IT. WHEN 

04:20:04.889 --> 04:20:10.008
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID HE HAD 
A DEAL WITH MICK MULVANEY TO 

04:20:10.159 --> 04:20:13.408
SCHEDULE THE PROMISED WHITE 
HOUSE MEETING IF UKRAINE 

04:20:15.771 --> 04:20:21.300
ANNOUNCED INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
THE BIDENS. IN THE 2016 

04:20:21.540 --> 04:20:26.691
ELECTION. WE KNOW AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON WAS INVOLVED IN BRIEFING 

04:20:28.315 --> 04:20:34.108
THE PRESIDENT IN AUGUST. 
REFLECTING THE OPINION THAT SAID

04:20:34.509 --> 04:20:38.958
IT WAS VITAL TO AMERICA'S 
NATIONAL SECURITY. SOMETHING 

04:20:39.620 --> 04:20:41.620
CONGRESS HAD APPROVED, 

04:20:44.951 --> 04:20:47.718
APPROPRIATED. SOMETHING THE 
PRESIDENT HAD SIGNED. PRESS 

04:20:47.878 --> 04:20:50.644
INDICATES HE WAS INVOLVED IN AN 
OFFICE IMMEDIATING WHERE HE, 

04:20:51.666 --> 04:20:56.106
SECRETARY POMPEO, AND SECRETARY 
ESPER ALL TRIED TO CONVINCE THE 

04:20:57.459 --> 04:21:01.367
PRESIDENT TO RELEASE THE AID. 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON HAS COME 

04:21:01.678 --> 04:21:05.777
FORWARD TO CONFIRM HE WAS AN 
WITNESS TO IMPORTANT EVENTS AND 

04:21:08.503 --> 04:21:11.490
ALSO HE HAS NEW EVIDENCE THAT NO
ONE HAS SEEN YET. IF WE KNOW 

04:21:11.650 --> 04:21:14.426
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HAS NOT 
COME OUT, ALL OF US SHOULD WANT 

04:21:14.697 --> 04:21:17.944
TO HEAR IT. WE SHOULD WANT TO 
HEAR IT NOW BEFORE AMBASSADOR 

04:21:18.305 --> 04:21:23.115
BOLTON TESTIFIES. WE SHOULD GET 
DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS RELATEING 

04:21:23.326 --> 04:21:28.868
TO HIS TESTIMONY INCLUDING HIS 
NOTES PROVIDING CONTEMPORANEOUS 

04:21:29.359 --> 04:21:31.359
EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT WAS 
DISCUSSED IN MEETINGS RELATE 

04:21:31.454 --> 04:21:36.324
TODAY UKRAINE WHICH WOULD HELP 
TO EVALUATE HIS TESTIMONY. THE 

04:21:36.535 --> 04:21:42.037
EVIDENCE IS NOT JUST RESTRICTED 
TO AMBASSADOR BOLTON DURING HIS 

04:21:42.277 --> 04:21:44.282
PUBLIC TESTIMONY. AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND EXPLAINED I HAVE NOT 

04:21:44.462 --> 04:21:49.974
HAD ACCESS TO ALL OF MY PHONE 
RECORDS. HE AND HIS LAWYERS HAD 

04:21:50.485 --> 04:21:53.301
ASKED REPEATEDLY FOR THESE 
MATERIALS. THEY WOULD HELP 

04:21:53.702 --> 04:21:57.982
REFRESH HIS MEMORY. WE SHOULD 
LOOK AT THAT MATERIAL. 

04:21:58.132 --> 04:22:00.187
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND ALSO 
TESTIFIED HE EXCHANGED A NUMBER 

04:22:02.081 --> 04:22:05.849
OF EMAILS WITH TOP OFFICIALS 
LIKE MICK MULVANEY ABOUT HIS 

04:22:06.110 --> 04:22:10.640
EFFORTS TO PRESSURE UKRAINE TO 
ANNOUNCE THE INVESTIGATION 

04:22:12.664 --> 04:22:16.933
PRESIDENT TRUMP DEMANDED. HERE 
IS HIS 

04:22:20.391 --> 04:22:23.097
TESTIMONY. 
&gt;&gt; LET ME SAY PRECISELY BECAUSE 

04:22:23.237 --> 04:22:27.867
WE DID NOT THINK WE WERE 
ENGAGING WITH IMPROPER BEHAVIOR.

04:22:28.008 --> 04:22:32.187
WE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE 
THAT THE RELEVANT DECISION 

04:22:32.477 --> 04:22:35.584
MAKERS AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT KNEW 

04:22:35.785 --> 04:22:42.918
THE IMPORTANT DETAILS OF OUR 
EFFORTS. THE SUGGESTION THAT WE 

04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:49.633
WERE ENGAGED IN SOME IRREGULAR 
OR ROGUE DIPLOMACY IS ABSOLUTELY

04:22:49.824 --> 04:22:51.824
FALSE. I HAVE NOW IDENTIFIED 
CERTAIN 

04:22:54.333 --> 04:22:59.735
STATE DEPARTMENT EMAILS AND 
MESSAGES. THAT PROVIDE 

04:23:00.647 --> 04:23:02.330
CONTEMPORARYDOWN SUPPORT FOR MY 
VIEW. THEY SHOW THE LEADERSHIP 

04:23:02.331 --> 04:23:06.610
OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND 

04:23:06.871 --> 04:23:13.085
THE WHITE HOUSE WERE ALL 
INFORMED ABOUT THE UKRAINE 

04:23:13.245 --> 04:23:16.432
EFFORT FROM MAY 23, 2019 UNTIL 
THE SECURITY AID WAS 

04:23:20.300 --> 04:23:22.334
RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 11th, 
2019. 

04:23:22.335 --> 04:23:31.223
&gt;&gt; THESE EMAILS AMONG OTHERS ARE
IN THE POSSESSION. OH. 

04:23:31.224 --> 04:23:33.650
&gt;&gt; PRECISE. 
&gt;&gt; THESE EMAILS REFERENCED IN 

04:23:35.634 --> 04:23:37.969
THIS TESTIMONY ARE IN THE 
POSSESSION OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 

04:23:38.741 --> 04:23:42.449
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SINCE ALL 

04:23:42.960 --> 04:23:45.887
THREE ENTITIES COMMUNICATED 
TOGETHER. DURING HIS TESTIMONY, 

04:23:47.651 --> 04:23:50.767
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND DESCRIBED IT
THIS WAY. EVERYONE WAS IN THE 

04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:55.297
LOOP. IT WAS NO SECRET. THESE 
EMAILS ARE THEREFORE IMPORTANT 

04:23:55.548 --> 04:23:59.497
IN UNDERSTANDING THE FULL SCOPE 
OF THE SCHEME. THE REQUEST FOR 

04:24:01.872 --> 04:24:04.477
RELEVANT EVIDENCE IS NOT 
CONFINED TO TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

04:24:04.628 --> 04:24:07.785
OFFICIALS. THE SENATE SHOULD GET
WHITE HOUSE RECORDS RELATING TO 

04:24:08.376 --> 04:24:10.591
THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE AGENTS. 
WHO ACTED ON 

04:24:15.602 --> 04:24:17.917
HIS  BEHALF IN 

04:24:20.994 --> 04:24:23.880
UKRAINE. WITNESS TESTIMONY AND 
DOCUMENTS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT  

04:24:24.331 --> 04:24:26.656
MR. GIULIANI, A FREQUENT VISITOR
TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ALSO 

04:24:27.027 --> 04:24:30.244
RECEIVED AND MADE FREQUENT CALLS
TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS ACTING 

04:24:30.575 --> 04:24:35.265
ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT TO 
PRESS UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS TO 

04:24:35.666 --> 04:24:38.773
ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
WOULD PERSONALLY AND POLITICALLY

04:24:38.923 --> 04:24:43.182
BENEFIT THE PRESIDENT. FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE MAY 10th, 2019 

04:24:43.874 --> 04:24:46.515
LETTER FROM  MR. GIULIANI, TO 
PRESIDENT ELECT ZELENSKY SHOWN 

04:24:46.785 --> 04:24:50.964
ON THIS SLIDE STATES HE WAS 
ACTING "AS PERSONAL COUNSEL" TO 

04:24:51.205 --> 04:24:53.250
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH HIS 
KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT. HE 

04:24:53.390 --> 04:25:01.798
REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE 
PRESIDENT ELECT. TO BE JOINED BY

04:25:01.939 --> 04:25:07.501
MISS TENSING WHO WAS "VERY 
FAMILIAR" WITH THIS MATTER. THE 

04:25:07.842 --> 04:25:11.269
EVIDENCE INDICATES HE WAS 
COLLABORATING WITH THEM IN THIS 

04:25:11.419 --> 04:25:14.506
EFFORT. THE SENATE SHOULD GET 
THE WHITE HOUSE RECORDS OF 

04:25:16.040 --> 04:25:19.135
MEETINGS, CALLS INVOLVING  MR. 
GIULIANI. THESE RECORDS ARE 

04:25:19.446 --> 04:25:22.849
IMPORTANT TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE WHITE 

04:25:22.999 --> 04:25:26.972
HOUSE WAS INVOLVED IN  MR. 
GIULIANI'S EFFORTS TO COERCE 

04:25:28.564 --> 04:25:31.447
UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE THE 
INVESTIGATION THE PRESIDENT 

04:25:31.667 --> 04:25:37.162
WANTED. THE RECORDS WOULD ALSO 
SHOW HOW THE PRESIDENT'S 

04:25:37.362 --> 04:25:41.876
PERSONAL POLITICAL AGENDA BECAME
MORE IMPORTANT THAN POLICIES TO 

04:25:42.307 --> 04:25:46.471
HELP AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY
INTEREST. THE PRESIDENT'S 

04:25:46.611 --> 04:25:49.694
COUNCIL MADE CONSISTENT WITH HIS
PRIOR ATTEMPT TO HIDE EVIDENCE 

04:25:50.785 --> 04:25:54.088
ASSERT THAT ATTORNEY CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE WOULD COVER THESE 

04:25:54.778 --> 04:25:57.181
DOCUMENTS. BUT, THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERSONAL ATTORNEY CLIENT 

04:25:57.921 --> 04:26:02.405
PRIVILEGE CANNOT SHIELD EVIDENCE
OF MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE. OR THAT

04:26:02.916 --> 04:26:06.209
OF HIS AIDES OR HIS LAWYER'S 
PARTICIPATIONS IN CORRUPT 

04:26:06.409 --> 04:26:11.124
SCHEMES. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR 
DOCUMENTS REFLECTING LEGITIMATE 

04:26:11.314 --> 04:26:14.737
LEGAL ADVICE. YOU NEED DOCUMENTS
ABOUT THEIR ACTIONS TO PRESSURE 

04:26:16.208 --> 04:26:19.351
UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO PRESIDENT 

04:26:19.621 --> 04:26:23.445
TRUMP'S POLITICAL OPPONENT. 
THERE IS A SET OF WHITE HOUSE 

04:26:23.725 --> 04:26:26.448
DOCUMENTS THAT RELATE DIRECTLY 
TO THE 

04:26:29.521 --> 04:26:31.521
PRESIDENT'S UNLAWFUL DECISION 

04:26:33.144 --> 04:26:38.719
TO WITHHOLD $391 MILLION 
APPROPRIATED BIPARTISAN TO HELP 

04:26:38.869 --> 04:26:40.869
UKRAINE. WITNESSES HAVE 
TESTIFIED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:26:41.332 --> 04:26:45.626
DIRECTLY ORDERED A HOLD ON THIS 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE DESPITE THE 

04:26:46.246 --> 04:26:49.759
OPINION OF HIS AGENCIES THAT THE
AID SHOULD BE RELEASED. 

04:26:49.900 --> 04:26:52.552
IMPORTANTLY, ACCORDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY 

04:26:56.546 --> 04:27:00.800
OFFICE, HIS ACTIONS VIOLATED THE
LAW. THE GAO, AN INDEPENDENT 

04:27:01.350 --> 04:27:04.453
WATCHDOG, ISSUED A LEGAL OPINION
FINDING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:27:04.603 --> 04:27:09.758
VIOLATED THE LAW WHEN HE HELD UP
SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE. 

04:27:09.918 --> 04:27:14.582
THE GAO SAID, AND I QUOTE, 
FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF A LAW DOES

04:27:14.953 --> 04:27:19.357
NOT PERMIT THE PRESIDENT TO 
SUBSTITUTE HIS OWN POLICY 

04:27:19.769 --> 04:27:23.953
PRIORITIES TO THOSE THAT 
CONGRESS ENACTED INTO LAW. OMB 

04:27:24.183 --> 04:27:28.477
WITHHELD FUNDS FOR A POLICY 
REASON WHICH IS NOT PERMITTED 

04:27:28.908 --> 04:27:34.663
UNDER THE EMPOWERMENT CONTROL 
ACT. THE WITHHOLDING WAS NOT. 

04:27:34.813 --> 04:27:39.267
THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT OMB 
VIOLATED THE ICA. THE FACT THAT 

04:27:39.848 --> 04:27:42.851
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION TO FREEZE
THE AID WHICH HE USED TO 

04:27:43.011 --> 04:27:46.494
PRESSURE UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE THE
POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS HE 

04:27:46.735 --> 04:27:51.680
WANTED, WAS AGAINST NOT ONLY THE
OFFICIAL CONSENSUS OF HIS OWN 

04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:56.154
ADMINISTRATION, BUT ALSO, 
AGAINST THE LAW. AND IT WAS TO 

04:27:56.314 --> 04:27:58.959
HELP HIMSELF. THAT HELPS 
DEMONSTRATE THESE ACTIONS WERE 

04:27:59.259 --> 04:28:04.502
TAKEN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
PERSONAL AND POLITICAL BENEFIT. 

04:28:04.652 --> 04:28:07.284
WITNESS TESTIMONY AND PUBLIC 
REPORTING MADE CLEAR, THE WHITE 

04:28:07.655 --> 04:28:13.570
HOUSE HAS A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF 
DOCUMENTS THAT RELATE TO THESE 

04:28:13.881 --> 04:28:16.507
KEY ASPECTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
SCHEME. SOME OF THESE OUTLINE 

04:28:17.278 --> 04:28:20.785
THE PLANNING OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
FREEZE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEW 

04:28:21.195 --> 04:28:26.955
YORK TIMES REPORTED IN JUNE THAT
MR. MULVANEY EMAILED HIS SENIOR 

04:28:27.395 --> 04:28:29.781
ADVISER  MR. BLAIR. IF WE EVER 
FIND OUT ABOUT THE MONEY FOR 

04:28:30.832 --> 04:28:32.832
UKRAINE AND WHETHER WE 

04:28:36.032 --> 04:28:40.797
CAN HOLD IT BACK? THIS SHOWS 
THAT  MR. MULVANEY WAS IN EMAIL 

04:28:40.947 --> 04:28:46.041
CONTACT WITH HIS AIDES ABOUT THE
VERY ISSUES UNDER INVESTIGATION 

04:28:46.522 --> 04:28:50.125
AS PART OF THIS IMPEACHMENT. IT 
TELLS US THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN 

04:28:50.275 --> 04:28:52.738
INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNICATION 
THAT'S GO TO THE HEART OF THE 

04:28:53.568 --> 04:28:56.251
CHARGES BEFORE YOU. THE SENATE 
SHOULD ALSO GET MATERIALS 

04:28:56.511 --> 04:29:00.155
PREPARED FOR SUMMARY MOTES FOR 
THE LATE AUGUST MEETING WITH 

04:29:00.365 --> 04:29:03.708
PRESIDENT TRUMP, SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE MARK ESPER AND SECRETARY

04:29:03.848 --> 04:29:06.641
OF STATE MIKE POMPEO WHEN THEY 
TRIED TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT 

04:29:06.791 --> 04:29:09.884
THAT FREEING AND THIS IS A 
QUOTE, FREEING UP THE MONEY FOR 

04:29:10.034 --> 04:29:16.099
UKRAINE WAS THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK 

04:29:16.350 --> 04:29:19.563
TIMES, AMBASSADOR BOLTON TOLD 
THE PRESIDENT THIS IS IN 

04:29:19.893 --> 04:29:23.096
AMERICA'S INTEREST. THE SENATE 
SHOULD REVIEW THAT HIGHLY 

04:29:24.697 --> 04:29:27.770
RELEVANT DOCUMENT WHICH REFLECTS
REALTIME ASSERTIONS BY PRESIDENT

04:29:29.682 --> 04:29:34.106
TRUMP'S OWN SENIOR AID THAT 
UKRAINIAN AID WAS IN THE 

04:29:34.246 --> 04:29:38.460
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST OF 
THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE 

04:29:39.111 --> 04:29:42.184
DOCUMENTS THAT INCLUDE AFTER THE
FACT. JUSTIFICATIONS TO TRY AND 

04:29:42.334 --> 04:29:44.334
OVERCOME. 

04:30:21.862 --> 04:30:23.862
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO PRODUCE 
THESE DOCUMENTS AT THE DIRECTION

04:30:24.296 --> 04:30:29.379
OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE HOUSE OF
THE LAWFUL SUBPOENA IN THE 

04:30:30.141 --> 04:30:34.658
WASHINGTON POST SAID THAT A 
WHITE HOUSE REVIEW OF PRESIDENT 

04:30:35.418 --> 04:30:40.141
TRUMP'S DECISION TO HOLD UP 
HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS THAT 

04:30:40.342 --> 04:30:42.172
REVEAL EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO 
GENERATE AN AFTER-THE-FACT 

04:30:42.173 --> 04:30:49.285
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DEBATE OF 
WHETHER THE DEFENDANT WAS LEGAL.

04:30:49.485 --> 04:30:53.349
THAT IS KNOWN AS A COVER-UP. THE
WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS UNCOVERED 

04:30:53.580 --> 04:30:57.617
EARLY AUGUST EMAIL EXCHANGE 
BETWEEN THE ACTING CHIEF OF 

04:30:57.818 --> 04:31:00.248
STAFF, NICK MULVANEY AND THE 
WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICIALS 

04:31:00.449 --> 04:31:03.660
SEEKING TO PROVIDE SOME 
EXPLANATION FOR WITHHOLDING THE 

04:31:03.885 --> 04:31:06.667
FUNDS THE PRESIDENT HAD ALREADY 
ORDERED.

04:31:10.201 --> 04:31:13.251
THE DOCUMENTS ALSO REPORTEDLY 
INCLUDE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN 

04:31:13.451 --> 04:31:17.117
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS AND 
OUTSIDE AGENCIES AND NOT ONLY 

04:31:17.319 --> 04:31:20.313
DOES CONGRESS HAVE A RIGHT TO 
SEE THEM BUT THE PUBLIC DOES TOO

04:31:20.481 --> 04:31:22.481
UNDER

04:31:25.637 --> 04:31:27.637
INFORMATION LAWS. AS A MATTER OF
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY, THE 

04:31:27.928 --> 04:31:32.284
SENATE HAS THE GREATEST INTEREST
IN AND THE RIGHT TO COMPEL THOSE

04:31:32.457 --> 04:31:34.457
DOCUMENTS.

04:31:36.200 --> 04:31:38.200
INDEED, AS THE NEWS ARTICLE 
EXPLAINS, WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS 

04:31:38.432 --> 04:31:40.878
ARE REPORTEDLY WORRIED ABOUT 
UNFLATTERING EXCHANGES AND FACTS

04:31:41.635 --> 04:31:46.362
THAT COULD AT A MINIMUM 
EMBARRASSED THE PRESIDENT. 

04:31:46.763 --> 04:31:48.797
PERHAPS THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED 
ABOUT THAT BUT THE RISK OF 

04:31:48.997 --> 04:31:52.860
EMBARRASSMENT CANNOT OUTWEIGH 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTEREST IN 

04:31:53.064 --> 04:31:57.327
THIS IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING. ANY
EVIDENCE OF GUILT INCLUDING 

04:31:57.528 --> 04:32:01.340
FURTHER PROOF OF THE REAL REASON
THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THE FUNDS 

04:32:01.508 --> 04:32:03.508
WITHHELD OR AFTER-THE-FACT 
ATTEMPT

04:32:10.526 --> 04:32:12.356
FOR THE KNOWINGLY UNLAWFUL 
CONDUCT, THEY MUST BE PROVIDED 

04:32:12.357 --> 04:32:14.392
TO ENSURE A FULL AND FAIR TRIAL.
NO PRIVILEGE OR NATIONAL 

04:32:15.154 --> 04:32:20.028
SECURITY RATIONALE CAN BE USED 
AS A SHIELD. FROM DISCLOSING 

04:32:20.193 --> 04:32:27.194
MISCONDUCT. THE KEY WHITE HOUSE 
DOCUMENTS RELATE TO MULTIPLE 

04:32:27.391 --> 04:32:28.807
INSTANCES WHEN WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS REPORTED THEIR 

04:32:28.808 --> 04:32:31.801
CONCERNS AND THE WHITE HOUSE 
LAWYERS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

04:32:31.974 --> 04:32:37.138
SCHEME TO PRESS UKRAINE TO DO 
THE PRESIDENT A DOMESTIC 

04:32:37.903 --> 04:32:43.839
POLITICAL FAVOR. LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL WOMEN INFORMED LAWYERS 

04:32:44.052 --> 04:32:48.920
ABOUT THE JULY 10 MEETING IT IN 
WHICH AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

04:32:49.127 --> 04:32:54.361
REVEALED THAT HE HAD A DEAL  
WITH MR. MULVANEY. I WILL GO 

04:32:54.530 --> 04:33:00.201
DIRECTLY TO THE CLIP BY DR. HILL
BECAUSE

04:33:03.961 --> 04:33:09.793
DR. HILL ALSO REPORTED THAT 
MEETING TO JOHN EISENBERG AS SHE

04:33:09.960 --> 04:33:11.960
EXPLAINED IN HER TESTIMONY.

04:33:15.328 --> 04:33:19.796
&gt;&gt; I HAD A DISCUSSION  WITH 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON BEFORE THE 

04:33:19.996 --> 04:33:23.370
MEETING AND THEN AFTER. 
&gt;&gt;  THE SUBSEQUENT MEETING

04:33:27.512 --> 04:33:29.959
OR AFTER BOTH MEETINGS WHEN YOU 
SPOKE TO HIM AND RELAYED TO HIM 

04:33:30.159 --> 04:33:34.012
WHAT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND SAID, 
WHAT DID AMBASSADOR  ALTON SAY 

04:33:34.224 --> 04:33:36.042
TO YOU? 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FIRST OF 

04:33:36.043 --> 04:33:39.857
ALL  THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
WANTED ME TO HOLD BACK IN THE 

04:33:40.028 --> 04:33:43.770
ROOM AFTER THE MEETING. I WAS 
SITTING HERE. 

04:33:43.771 --> 04:33:48.386
&gt;&gt; IN THE SECOND MEETING  -- 
&gt;&gt; HE WAS MAKING A STRONG POINT 

04:33:48.841 --> 04:33:51.288
THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT WAS BEING SAID AND WHEN I 

04:33:52.052 --> 04:33:56.255
CAME BACK, HE HAD SOME VERY 
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR ME

04:34:01.037 --> 04:34:02.453
.  
&gt;&gt; WHAT WERE THE SPECIFIC 

04:34:02.454 --> 04:34:04.287
INSTRUCTIONS? 
&gt;&gt; THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE 

04:34:04.288 --> 04:34:08.138
LAWYERS  AND TO JOHN EISENBERG 
AND THE SENIOR COUNSEL TO 

04:34:08.338 --> 04:34:13.082
BASICALLY SAY YOU TELL EISENBERG
THAT I AM NOT PART OF WHATEVER 

04:34:13.421 --> 04:34:18.701
DRUG DEAL THAT MULVANEY AND 
SONDLAND ARE COOKING UP. 

04:34:18.702 --> 04:34:20.702
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU 

04:34:24.387 --> 04:34:26.834
EXPECT TO BE BY THE DRUG DEAL? 
&gt;&gt; I TOOK IT TO MEAN 

04:34:27.035 --> 04:34:30.688
INVESTIGATIONS FOR A MEETING . 
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SPEAK TO THE LAWYERS?

04:34:30.889 --> 04:34:33.737
&gt;&gt; I CERTAINLY DID .  
&gt;&gt; YOU RELATE EVERYTHING  THAT 

04:34:33.937 --> 04:34:37.186
YOU JUST TOLD US? 
&gt;&gt;  I DID AND THEN THE DETAILS 

04:34:37.947 --> 04:34:44.049
OF HOW THERE WAS A FOLDER AND I 
GIVE A TOTAL DESCRIPTION IN MY 

04:34:44.221 --> 04:34:46.322
DEPOSITION. 
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG  

04:34:46.537 --> 04:34:51.277
GOING ON HERE AND WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS WERE TOLD REPEATEDLY 

04:34:51.604 --> 04:34:53.969
TO TELL THE LAWYERS NOTHING 
ABOUT IT.

04:34:57.903 --> 04:35:03.387
MR. MORRISON WHO REPORTED AT 
LEAST TWO CONVERSATIONS, WE NEED

04:35:03.601 --> 04:35:08.579
THE NOTES OF THOSE DOCUMENTS TO 
FIND OUT WHAT WAS SAID AND AGAIN

04:35:09.887 --> 04:35:11.887
THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
CANNOT SHIELD INFORMATION ABOUT 

04:35:12.048 --> 04:35:14.048
MISCONDUCT

04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:18.584
FOR THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL FOR 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

04:35:18.749 --> 04:35:20.749
STATES.

04:35:22.688 --> 04:35:25.081
NOW, IT IS INTERESTING. THE 
CINNAMON IS SUPPORTED BY 200 

04:35:25.261 --> 04:35:27.282
YEARS AND IT IS NEEDED

04:35:33.255 --> 04:35:35.286
TO PREVENT THE PRESIDENT FROM 
HIDING THE EVIDENCE AND THAT IS 

04:35:35.487 --> 04:35:37.317
WHY THE SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS 
REQUESTED ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR 

04:35:37.318 --> 04:35:39.339
THIS CASE. IT IS FAITHFUL TO THE
CONSTITUTION'S PROVISION THAT 

04:35:39.552 --> 04:35:43.002
THE SENATE WOULD HAVE THE SOLE 
POWER. THE FINAL POINT I WILL 

04:35:43.763 --> 04:35:48.085
MAKE TODAY CONCERNS URGENCY. THE
SENATE SHOULD ACT ON THIS 

04:35:48.845 --> 04:35:53.154
SUBPOENA NOW AT THE OUTSET OF 
THE TRIAL. IN 14 OF THE SENATE'S

04:35:53.383 --> 04:35:55.499
15 IMPEACHABLE TRIALS, FRESH 
HOLD

04:35:59.254 --> 04:36:01.073
EVIDENTIARY MATTERS INCLUDING 
THE TIMING AND NATURE AND SCOPE 

04:36:01.074 --> 04:36:04.123
OF WHAT THIS TESTIMONY AND THE 
GATHERING OF ALL REBEL AND 

04:36:04.538 --> 04:36:09.004
DOCUMENTS WERE ADDRESSED AT THE 
OUTSET OF THE TRIAL. THERE ARE 

04:36:09.204 --> 04:36:11.706
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AS TO 
WHY THE SUBPOENA NEEDS TO BE 

04:36:11.874 --> 04:36:15.903
NOW. RESOLVING WHETHER THE 
SUBPOENA WOULD LET US 

04:36:16.318 --> 04:36:19.766
IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE WITH THE 
WHITE HOUSE TO RESOLVE 

04:36:20.731 --> 04:36:25.663
LEGITIMATE ISSUES IF ANY EXIST 
AND ENSURE YOU GET DOCUMENTS AS 

04:36:25.864 --> 04:36:31.184
SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY 
CAN BE PRESENTED IN ADVANCE OF 

04:36:31.907 --> 04:36:34.731
WITNESS TESTIMONY. WAITING TO 
RESOLVE THE THRESHOLD MATTERS 

04:36:34.894 --> 04:36:38.246
UNTIL AFTER THE PARTIES HAVE 
PRESENTED THEIR CASE WOULD 

04:36:38.459 --> 04:36:42.926
UNDERCUT THE PROCESS OF A 
GENUINE CREDIBLE TRIAL. THUS, 

04:36:43.128 --> 04:36:48.409
COMMON SENSE AND TRADITION AND 
FAIRNESS ALL COMPEL THAT THE 

04:36:48.611 --> 04:36:53.076
AMENDMENT SHOULD BE ADOPTED AND 
IT SHOULD BE ADOPTED NOW. 

04:36:53.492 --> 04:36:57.142
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE FOR ALL 
THE REASONS I SAY TODAY, I WANT 

04:36:57.343 --> 04:37:00.794
YOU TO SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT TO 
ISSUE A SUBPOENA FOR WHITE HOUSE

04:37:01.547 --> 04:37:06.490
STOCK MINTS. DOCUMENTS THAT ARE 
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EVALUATE 

04:37:06.891 --> 04:37:09.688
THE PRESIDENT SKIING. THE HOUSE 
DID IT'S JOB WITH OBSTRUCTION 

04:37:09.871 --> 04:37:15.221
AND CATEGORICAL COMMITMENT TO 
HIDE THE EVIDENCE, WE STILL 

04:37:15.421 --> 04:37:17.918
GATHER DIRECT EVIDENCE OF 
MISCONDUCT AND DETERMINED THAT 

04:37:18.605 --> 04:37:20.605
HIS CONDUCT REQUIRED 
IMPEACHMENT.

04:37:24.356 --> 04:37:26.356
THE PRESIDENT COMPLAINS ABOUT 
DUE PROCESS WITH HOUSE 

04:37:26.492 --> 04:37:29.639
INVESTIGATIONS BUT HE WAS NOT 
ONLY PERMITTED TO PURCHASE A 

04:37:29.840 --> 04:37:35.121
PAPER REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE. 
YET, HE REFUSED TO DO SO. HE 

04:37:35.321 --> 04:37:38.372
REFUSED TO PROVIDE WITNESSES AND
DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD TELL HIS 

04:37:38.573 --> 04:37:43.455
SIDE OF THE STORY SO NOW IT IS 
UP TO YOU. WITH THE BACKING OF A

04:37:43.656 --> 04:37:45.656
SUBPOENA AUTHORIZED BY THE CHIEF
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES, 

04:37:46.100 --> 04:37:50.967
YOU CAN END PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
OBSTRUCTION. WITH THE SENATE 

04:37:51.168 --> 04:37:55.340
FAILS TO TAKE THE STEP, THEY 
WON'T EVEN ASK FOR THE EVIDENCE.

04:37:55.675 --> 04:37:59.696
THIS TRIAL AND YOUR VERDICT WILL
BE QUESTIONED. CONGRESS AND THE 

04:38:00.449 --> 04:38:05.141
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE THE FULL
TRUTH. THERE IS NO POSSIBLE 

04:38:05.307 --> 04:38:11.692
REASON WHY ANYONE WOULDN'T WANT 
TO HEAR ALL OF THE AVAILABLE 

04:38:11.893 --> 04:38:15.032
EVIDENCE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONDUCT. IT IS UP TO THIS BODY 

04:38:15.206 --> 04:38:20.167
TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS AND UP
TO YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER THE 

04:38:20.337 --> 04:38:27.536
SENATE WILL AFFIRM ITS SOLE 
POWER AND CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. 

04:38:27.938 --> 04:38:30.788
WHETHER AND WHEN IT WILL GET THE
EVIDENCE THAT IT NEEDS TO RENDER

04:38:30.989 --> 04:38:35.453
A FAIR VERDICT. DON'T SURRENDER 
TO THE STORE AND WALL. IT WILL 

04:38:35.655 --> 04:38:38.203
ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO BE ABOVE 
THE LAW

04:38:42.568 --> 04:38:49.881
AND A FAIR TRIAL IS ESSENTIAL IN
EVERY WAY. IMPORTANT FOR THE 

04:38:50.081 --> 04:38:52.465
PRESIDENT WHO HOPES TO BE 
EXONERATED AND NOT MERELY 

04:38:52.690 --> 04:38:58.617
ACQUITTED BY A TRIAL SEEN AS 
UNFAIR. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE 

04:38:58.816 --> 04:39:03.686
SENATE WHOSE VITAL ROLE IS TO 
CONTINUE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND 

04:39:04.099 --> 04:39:08.567
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES WHICH IS PRESERVING OUR 

04:39:08.767 --> 04:39:12.834
AMERICAN LIBERTY FOR CENTURIES. 
FINALLY, IMPORTANT FOR THE 

04:39:13.034 --> 04:39:18.652
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL TO EXPECT A
QUEST FOR TRUTH AND FAIRNESS AND

04:39:18.826 --> 04:39:24.617
JUSTICE. HISTORY IS WATCHING IN 
THE HOUSE MANAGERS URGE THAT YOU

04:39:24.816 --> 04:39:30.500
SUPPORT THE MMA. I RESERVE THE 
BALANCE OF MY TIME. 

04:39:30.501 --> 04:39:32.501
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

04:39:36.543 --> 04:39:38.543
&gt;&gt;  MR. PHILBIN?

04:39:43.902 --> 04:39:48.986
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU , MR. CHIEF JUSTICE
AND MAJORITY LEADER McCONNELL 

04:39:49.186 --> 04:39:53.388
AND DEMOCRAT LEADER CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND SENATORS . IT IS 

04:39:53.552 --> 04:39:57.315
REMARKABLE THAT AFTER TAKING THE
ACTION OF THE BREATHTAKING 

04:39:58.078 --> 04:40:01.729
GRAVITY OF VOTING TO BE THE DULY
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

04:40:01.893 --> 04:40:06.449
STATES AND AFTER SAYING FOR 
WEEKS THAT THEY HAD OVERWHELMING

04:40:06.662 --> 04:40:09.496
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR CASE, 
THE FIRST THING THAT THE HOUSE 

04:40:09.697 --> 04:40:12.545
MANAGERS HAVE DONE UPON ARRIVING
FINALLY IN THIS CHAMBER AFTER 

04:40:12.746 --> 04:40:18.229
WAITING FOR 33 DAYS IS TO SAY 
ACTUALLY WINNING MORE EVIDENCE. 

04:40:18.645 --> 04:40:22.697
WE ARE NOT READY TO PRESENT OUR 
CASE. WE NEED TO HAVE SUBPOENAS 

04:40:22.912 --> 04:40:26.363
AND DO MORE DISCOVERY BECAUSE WE
DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE WE NEED 

04:40:26.562 --> 04:40:31.846
TO SUPPORT OUR CASE. THIS IS 
STUNNING. IT IS A STUNNING 

04:40:32.047 --> 04:40:34.047
ADMISSION OF THE INACCURATE AND 
BROKEN PROCESS THAT THE HOUSE 

04:40:34.640 --> 04:40:39.163
DEMOCRATS RAN IN THIS 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THAT FAILED 

04:40:39.361 --> 04:40:43.013
TO COMPILE A RECORD TO SUPPORT 
THE CHARGES AND IT IS STUNNING 

04:40:43.214 --> 04:40:45.214
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
EVIDENCE THEY NEED TO PRESENT 

04:40:45.246 --> 04:40:49.514
THEIR CASE AND THAT THEY DON'T 
REALLY HAVE A CASE. IF A 

04:40:49.715 --> 04:40:52.362
LITIGANT SHOWED UP IN ANY COURT 
IN THIS COUNTRY ON THE DAY OF 

04:40:52.562 --> 04:40:56.575
TRIAL AND SAID TO THE JUDGE 
ACTUALLY, WE ARE NOT READY TO 

04:40:56.741 --> 04:41:00.695
GO. WE NEED MORE DISCOVERY. WE 
NEED TO DO MORE SUBPOENAS AND 

04:41:01.460 --> 04:41:05.965
MORE WORK, THEY WOULD BE THROWN 
OUT OF COURT AND THE LAWYERS 

04:41:06.178 --> 04:41:09.629
WOULD PROBABLY BE SANCTIONED. 
THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF 

04:41:09.829 --> 04:41:15.714
PROCEEDING THAT THIS BODY SHOULD
CONDONE. WE JUST HEARD THAT THIS

04:41:15.927 --> 04:41:20.394
IS SO IMPORTANT AND LET'S 
CONSIDER WHAT IS REALLY AT ISSUE

04:41:20.597 --> 04:41:24.806
IN THE RESOLUTION HERE AND THE 
AMENDMENT. IT IS A MATTER OF 

04:41:24.971 --> 04:41:28.674
TIMING AND WHEN THIS BODY WILL 
CONSIDER WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE

04:41:28.852 --> 04:41:32.379
WITNESSES FOR SUBPOENAS FOR 
DOCUMENTS. WHY IS IT THAT THE 

04:41:33.142 --> 04:41:37.246
HOUSE MANAGERS ARE SO AFRAID TO 
HAVE TO PRESENT THEIR CASE. 

04:41:37.448 --> 04:41:39.448
REMEMBER, THEY HAVE HAD WEEKS

04:41:42.944 --> 04:41:45.324
OF A PROCESS THAT THEY ENTIRELY 
CONTROLLED. THEY HAD 17 

04:41:45.495 --> 04:41:49.646
WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED FIRST 
IN SECRET AND THEN IN PUBLIC AND

04:41:49.847 --> 04:41:51.879
THEY HAVE COMPILED A RECORD WITH
THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF REPORTS 

04:41:52.080 --> 04:41:56.238
AND THEY ARE APPARENTLY AFRAID 
TO JUST MAKE A PRESENTATION 

04:41:56.545 --> 04:41:59.527
BASED ON THE RECORD THAT THEY 
COMPILED AND THEN HAVE YOU 

04:41:59.705 --> 04:42:05.893
DECIDE WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING
THERE AND ANYTHING WORTH TRYING 

04:42:06.094 --> 04:42:11.578
TO TALK TO MORE WITNESSES ABOUT.
WHY IS IT THAT THEY CAN'T WAIT A

04:42:12.338 --> 04:42:14.338
FEW DAYS

04:42:16.656 --> 04:42:18.487
TO MAKE THEIR PRESENTATION ON 
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE BEEN 

04:42:18.488 --> 04:42:20.305
PREPARING FOR WEEKS AND THEN 
HAVE THAT ISSUE CONSIDERED? 

04:42:20.306 --> 04:42:23.154
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THERE 
IS ANYTHING THERE AND THEY WANT 

04:42:23.355 --> 04:42:29.051
TO RAM THIS THROUGH NOW. THEY 
WANT TO RAM THIS THROUGH NOW AND

04:42:29.253 --> 04:42:31.284
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY 
THEMSELVES FAILED TO DO. I WANT 

04:42:32.045 --> 04:42:36.569
TO UNPACK A COUPLE OF THE 
ASPECTS OF WHAT THEY ARE ASKING 

04:42:36.968 --> 04:42:39.402
THIS BODY TO DO. PART OF IT 
RELATES TO THE BROKEN PROCESS IN

04:42:40.154 --> 04:42:45.298
THE HOUSE AND HOW THAT PROCESS 
WAS INADEQUATE AND INVALID AND 

04:42:45.699 --> 04:42:50.781
COMPILED AN INADEQUATE RECORD 
AND PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH 

04:42:50.981 --> 04:42:53.766
WHAT ACCEPTING THE REQUEST TO 
HAVE THIS BODY DO THEIR JOB FOR 

04:42:53.931 --> 04:43:00.127
THEM WOULD DO TO THIS 
INSTITUTION GOING FORWARD AND 

04:43:00.329 --> 04:43:02.329
HOW IT WOULD ALTER FOREVER THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HOUSE 

04:43:02.363 --> 04:43:08.863
AND SENATE IN IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS. FIRST, THE PROCESS 

04:43:09.064 --> 04:43:14.143
IN THE HOUSE, WHAT THE HOUSE 
MANAGER IS ASKING THIS BODY TO 

04:43:14.343 --> 04:43:17.393
DO NOW IS REALLY TO DO THEIR JOB
FOR THEM. THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE 

04:43:17.594 --> 04:43:22.876
MEASURES TO PURSUE THE DOCUMENTS
IN THE HOUSE PROCEEDINGS AND 

04:43:23.077 --> 04:43:25.958
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
STATEMENTS MADE ABOUT TRYING TO 

04:43:26.140 --> 04:43:29.577
GET THE DOCUMENTS AND NO 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OR THINGS 

04:43:29.991 --> 04:43:34.957
LIKE THAT BUT WITH THE SUBPOENA

04:43:38.521 --> 04:43:40.552
TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THE WHITE 
HOUSE EXPLAINED THAT WE WERE 

04:43:40.753 --> 04:43:42.987
TOLD A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE PROVIDED NO RESPONSE

04:43:43.748 --> 04:43:46.746
OR RATIONALE. ON OCTOBER 18, THE
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL

04:43:55.785 --> 04:43:57.785
PAT CIPOLLONE EXPLAIN WHY THE 
SUBPOENA WAS INVALID. IT WAS 

04:43:57.817 --> 04:44:02.489
INVALID BECAUSE IT WAS ISSUED  
WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. WE HAVE 

04:44:02.692 --> 04:44:06.341
HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT HOW THE 
CONSTITUTION HAS SIGNED THE SOLE

04:44:06.552 --> 04:44:11.017
POWER OF IMPEACHMENT TO THE 
HOUSE. THAT IS WHAT ARTICLE ONE 

04:44:11.418 --> 04:44:15.082
SECTION 2 SAYS AND IT DESIGNS 
THE SOLE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT TO

04:44:15.282 --> 04:44:19.138
THE HOUSE. NOT TO ANY MEMBER OF 
THE HOUSE. NO COMMITTEE OF THE 

04:44:19.338 --> 04:44:21.370
HOUSE CAN EXERCISE THAT 
AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS 

04:44:21.584 --> 04:44:27.671
UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY 
THE HOUSE. THERE WAS NO VOTE 

04:44:27.869 --> 04:44:30.106
FROM THE HOUSE BUT INSTEAD 
SPEAKER PELOSI HELD A PRESS 

04:44:30.870 --> 04:44:34.613
CONFERENCE AND REPORTED BY 
HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE ON 

04:44:35.323 --> 04:44:39.588
SEPTEMBER 24 TO DELEGATE THE 
AUTHORITY OF THE HOUSE TO 

04:44:39.769 --> 04:44:44.122
MANAGER SCHIFF AND SEVERAL OTHER
COMMITTEES AND HAVE THEM ISSUE 

04:44:44.335 --> 04:44:49.203
SUBPOENAS.  ALL OF THOSE WERE 
INVALID AND THAT WAS EXPLAINED 

04:44:49.605 --> 04:44:55.502
TO THE HOUSE AND TO MANAGER 
SCHIFF OF THE TIME ON THAT  

04:44:56.065 --> 04:44:58.065
OCTOBER

04:45:01.389 --> 04:45:03.823
LETTER. TO THE HOUSE TAKE ANY 
STEPS TO REMEDY THAT OR TRY TO 

04:45:04.037 --> 04:45:07.237
DISPUTE THAT OR GO TO COURT? DID
THEY DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THAT

04:45:07.407 --> 04:45:12.155
PROBLEM? NO. AS WE KNOW, ALL 
THAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS ISSUE

04:45:12.355 --> 04:45:14.355
A SUBPOENA AND MOVE ON.

04:45:18.456 --> 04:45:20.488
THEY JUST WANTED TO GET THROUGH 
THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS AS QUICK

04:45:20.688 --> 04:45:23.281
AS POSSIBLE AND GET IT DONE 
BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THAT WAS THE 

04:45:23.452 --> 04:45:25.452
GOAL.

04:45:27.588 --> 04:45:30.035
SO, THOSE SUBPOENAS WERE 
UNAUTHORIZED. WHAT ABOUT THE 

04:45:30.236 --> 04:45:33.287
OTHER THINGS THAT THEY BROUGHT 
UP WITH THE WITNESSES? WITNESSES

04:45:33.488 --> 04:45:41.150
THAT WERE DIRECTED NOT TO 
TESTIFY. PART ON THIS, WE HEARD 

04:45:41.316 --> 04:45:47.901
MANAGER SCHIFF SAY SEVERAL TIMES
AT THE WHITE HOUSE NEVER  

04:45:48.316 --> 04:45:50.350
ASSERTED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 
LET ME BE CLEAR ON THAT, THAT IS

04:45:50.549 --> 04:45:54.816
A LAWYERS TRICK BECAUSE IT IS 
TECHNICALLY TRUE THAT THE WHITE 

04:45:55.017 --> 04:45:59.682
HOUSE DID NOT ASSERT EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE AND THERE IS A 

04:45:59.894 --> 04:46:01.926
PARTICULAR SITUATION IN WHICH 
YOU DO THAT IN A PARTICULAR WAY 

04:46:02.128 --> 04:46:05.576
THAT YOU DO THAT. THERE IS 
ANOTHER DOCTRINE OF IMMUNITY OF 

04:46:05.777 --> 04:46:10.861
SENIOR ADVISORS TO THE PRESIDENT
THAT IS BASED ON THE SAME 

04:46:11.061 --> 04:46:13.229
PRINCIPLES AS EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE AND THAT HAS BEEN 

04:46:13.401 --> 04:46:18.736
ASSERTED BY BOTH POLITICAL 
PARTIES SINCE THE 1970S AT 

04:46:18.905 --> 04:46:20.905
LEAST.

04:46:23.660 --> 04:46:26.496
THIS IS WHAT ONE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL EXPLAINED ABOUT THAT. 

04:46:26.911 --> 04:46:30.360
"THE IMMUNITY SUCH ADVISORS 
ENJOY FROM COMPULSION BY 

04:46:30.761 --> 04:46:35.260
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE IS 
ABSOLUTE AND MAY NOT BE 

04:46:35.442 --> 04:46:37.813
OVERBORNE BY COMPETING 
CONGRESSIONAL INTEREST." THAT 

04:46:37.979 --> 04:46:43.763
WAS JANET RENO IN THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION EXPANDING THE 

04:46:43.964 --> 04:46:46.612
SENIOR ADVISORS ARE IMMUNE FROM 
CONGRESSIONAL COMPULSION AND 

04:46:47.370 --> 04:46:53.314
THAT DOCTRINE AND IMMUNITY IS 
ROOTED IN THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF

04:46:53.514 --> 04:46:57.979
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND ASSERTED
BY ALL PRESIDENTS SINCE THE 

04:46:58.194 --> 04:47:00.628
1970S AND THAT WAS THE BASIS ON 
WHICH A NUMBER OF ADVISORS WHOSE

04:47:00.829 --> 04:47:06.111
PICTURES THEY PUT UP WERE 
DIRECTED NOT TO TESTIFY. DID 

04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:08.745
THEY TRY TO CHALLENGE THAT IN 
COURT? DID THEY GO TO COURT ON 

04:47:09.497 --> 04:47:12.543
THAT ONE AND TRY TO GO THROUGH 
THE MANDATED ACCOMMODATIONS 

04:47:12.715 --> 04:47:17.922
PROCESS TO SEE IF THERE WAS A 
WAY TO COME UP WITH SOME ASPECT 

04:47:18.098 --> 04:47:25.405
OR TESTIMONY? NO, NONE OF THAT. 
THEY JUST WANTED TO FORGE AHEAD 

04:47:25.806 --> 04:47:29.469
AND RUSH TO THE PROCESS AND NOT 
HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THEN USE 

04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:34.499
THAT AS ANOTHER CHARGE IN THE 
CHARGING SHEET FOR THE 

04:47:34.661 --> 04:47:40.840
IMPEACHMENT CALLING OBSTRUCTION 
OF CONGRESS. WHAT THAT IS IS 

04:47:41.254 --> 04:47:43.889
PROFESSOR TRULY EXPANDING THAT 
WHEN THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN

04:47:44.091 --> 04:47:48.797
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE 
HOUSE AND SEEKING INFORMATION 

04:47:48.971 --> 04:47:52.775
AND THE PRESIDENT IS ASSERTING 
CONSTITUTIONALLY BASED 

04:47:52.945 --> 04:47:58.103
PRIVILEGES, THAT IS PART OF THE 
OPERATION OF SEPARATION OF 

04:47:58.318 --> 04:48:01.569
POWERS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
DUTY TO DEFEND THE PREROGATIVES 

04:48:01.770 --> 04:48:09.101
OF THE OFFICE FOR THE FUTURE 
OCCUPANTS OF THAT OFFICE. IT IS 

04:48:09.285 --> 04:48:11.285
NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE 
CHARGED AS AN IMPEACHABLE 

04:48:11.668 --> 04:48:16.185
DEFENSE AS DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED 
TO SAY. TO DO THAT IS AN ABUSE 

04:48:16.386 --> 04:48:20.855
OF POWER. THAT IS WILL PROFESSOR
TRULY EXPLAINED. IS THE HOUSE 

04:48:21.055 --> 04:48:23.055
DEMOCRATS ABUSE OF POWER.

04:48:26.339 --> 04:48:30.202
WE JUST HEARD THE MANAGER REFER 
TO EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AS A 

04:48:30.403 --> 04:48:33.602
DISTRACTION. SHE WAS ASSERTING 
THAT THESE ISSUES ARE JUST A 

04:48:33.762 --> 04:48:38.119
DISTRACTION BUT THIS IS WHAT THE
SUPREME COURT HAS SAID ABOUT 

04:48:38.871 --> 04:48:44.165
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. THE 
PROTECTIONS FOR EXECUTIVE 

04:48:44.347 --> 04:48:49.302
PRIVILEGE ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE
OPERATIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND 

04:48:49.502 --> 04:48:54.583
ROOTED IN THE SEPARATION OF 
POWERS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 

04:48:54.984 --> 04:48:57.831
THEY ARE ROOTED IN THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS. THAT IS 

04:48:58.032 --> 04:49:02.040
WHY IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S DUTY 
TO DEFEND EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

04:49:02.295 --> 04:49:06.763
CONFIDENTIALITY AND THAT IS WHAT
THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING HERE. 

04:49:07.715 --> 04:49:09.715
NOW,

04:49:11.844 --> 04:49:17.941
THE PROCESS THAT THEY PURSUED IN
THE HOUSE ABANDONED ANY EFFORT 

04:49:18.343 --> 04:49:21.190
BEYOND ISSUING THE FIRST 
SUBPOENA THAT WAS INVALID TO 

04:49:21.391 --> 04:49:26.675
WORK OUT AN ACCOMMODATION WITH 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND INSTEAD 

04:49:26.876 --> 04:49:31.945
TRIED TO RUSH AHEAD TO HAVE THE 
IMPEACHMENT DONE BY CHRISTMAS. 

04:49:32.360 --> 04:49:37.842
WHAT DOES THAT LEAD TO NOW? THEY
ARE COMING TO THIS BODY AFTER A 

04:49:38.042 --> 04:49:40.434
PROCESS THAT WAS HALF-BAKED BUT 
DID NOT COMPILE A RECORD 

04:49:40.596 --> 04:49:45.359
SUFFICIENT AND ASKING THIS BODY 
TO DO THEIR JOB FOR THEM. 

04:49:46.319 --> 04:49:50.025
McCONNELL POINTED OUT IN SOME 
COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY TO ALLOW 

04:49:50.226 --> 04:49:52.873
THAT TO ACCEPT THE IDEA 

04:50:02.977 --> 04:50:04.977
THAT THE HOUSE CAN BRING IN 
IMPEACHMENT HERE THAT IS NOT 

04:50:05.025 --> 04:50:06.684
ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED AND HAS NOT
BEEN INVESTIGATED OR HAS A 

04:50:06.685 --> 04:50:08.734
RECORD TO SUPPORT IT AND TO TURN
THIS BODY INTO THE INVESTIGATORY

04:50:09.067 --> 04:50:10.955
BODY WOULD ALTER THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HOUSE 

04:50:10.956 --> 04:50:16.023
AND THE SENATE IN IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT THE ROLE 

04:50:16.237 --> 04:50:19.685
OF THE SENATE TO HAVE TO DO THE 
HOUSES JOB FOR THEM. IS NOT THE 

04:50:19.885 --> 04:50:25.327
ROLE OF THE SENATE TO BE DOING 
AN INVESTIGATION AND TO BE DOING

04:50:25.560 --> 04:50:31.468
DISCOVERY IN A MATTER LIKE THE 
IMPEACHMENT OR THE PRESIDENT OF 

04:50:31.668 --> 04:50:33.700
THE UNITED STATES. IF THE HOUSE 
HAS NOT DONE THE INVESTIGATION 

04:50:33.901 --> 04:50:37.767
AND CANNOT SUPPORT ITS CASE, NOT
THE TIME WANTED HERE TO START 

04:50:37.968 --> 04:50:41.365
DOING ALL THAT WORK, THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS THE HOUSES 

04:50:41.527 --> 04:50:43.527
ROLE.

04:50:47.716 --> 04:50:52.340
SO, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR THE INSTITUTION I 

04:50:52.502 --> 04:51:01.115
BELIEVE NOT TO ALLOW THE HOUSE 
TO TURN IT INTO A SITUATION 

04:51:01.530 --> 04:51:04.167
WHERE THIS BODY WOULD HAVE TO BE
DOING THE HOUSES WORK FOR IT. IF

04:51:04.367 --> 04:51:06.599
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT 
THE CASE AND IF THEY HAVEN'T 

04:51:06.812 --> 04:51:09.648
DONE THEIR INVESTIGATION THEN 
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

04:51:10.414 --> 04:51:15.896
THEIR CASE. AGAIN, WHAT IS AT 
ISSUE HERE AND I THINK IT IS 

04:51:16.068 --> 04:51:22.045
IMPORTANT TO RECALL ON THE ISSUE
OF THIS AMENDMENT NOT WHETHER 

04:51:22.446 --> 04:51:26.713
THE SENATE OR THIS BODY WILL BE 
CONSIDERING WHETHER THERE SHOULD

04:51:26.914 --> 04:51:31.180
BE WITNESSES OR NOT BUT WHEN IT 
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. THERE IS 

04:51:31.380 --> 04:51:37.275
NO REASON NOT TO TAKE THE 
APPROACH THAT WAS DONE IN THE 

04:51:37.476 --> 04:51:39.476
CLINTON IMPEACHMENT. 100 
SENATORS AGREED THAT IT MADE 

04:51:39.607 --> 04:51:45.205
SENSE TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES. 
BEFORE MAKING A DETERMINATION ON

04:51:45.405 --> 04:51:49.871
THAT. TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES TO
SEE WHAT SORT OF CASE THE HOUSE 

04:51:50.633 --> 04:51:53.236
COULD PRESENT AND THE PRESIDENTS
DEFENSE.

04:51:56.772 --> 04:51:59.006
THAT MAKE SENSE. IN EVERY TRIAL 
SYSTEM THERE IS A MECHANISM FOR 

04:51:59.219 --> 04:52:01.523
DETERMINING WHETHER THE PARTIES 
HAVE PRESENTED A TRIABLE ISSUE 

04:52:01.852 --> 04:52:07.490
AND WHETHER THERE IS SOMETHING 
THERE THAT REQUIRES FURTHER 

04:52:07.652 --> 04:52:09.980
PROCEEDINGS. 

04:52:20.085 --> 04:52:21.915
THIS BODY SHOULD TAKE THAT 
COMMON SENSE APPROACH AND HEAR 

04:52:21.916 --> 04:52:23.916
WHAT IT IS THAT THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS HAVE TO SAY. WHY ARE 

04:52:24.107 --> 04:52:26.087
THEY AFRAID TO PRESENT THEIR 
CASE? THEY HAD WEEKS IN A 

04:52:26.088 --> 04:52:27.762
PROCESS THAT THEY CONTROL TO 
COMPILE YOUR THEIR RECORD AND 

04:52:27.763 --> 04:52:30.089
SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT
PRESENTATION NOW. THE ONE POINT 

04:52:30.329 --> 04:52:36.987
I WILL CLOSE ON. WE HEARD THEM 
SAY SEVERAL TIMES THAT WE HAVE 

04:52:37.203 --> 04:52:41.458
TO HAVE A FAIR PROCESS AND I WAS
STRUCK BY IT AND IT ONE POINT HE

04:52:41.672 --> 04:52:43.904
SAID IF YOU ALLOW ONLY ONE SIDE 
TO PRESENT EVIDENCE, THE OUTCOME

04:52:44.107 --> 04:52:49.744
WILL BE PREDETERMINED. THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 

04:52:49.907 --> 04:52:54.664
HOUSE. LET'S RECALL THAT THE 
PROCESS THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE 

04:52:55.427 --> 04:52:58.316
WAS ONE-SIDED. A LOT THE 
PRESIDENT AND HIS LAWYERS OUT. 

04:52:58.531 --> 04:53:00.964
THERE WAS NO DUE PROCESS AND 
THEY STARTED WITH SECRET 

04:53:01.166 --> 04:53:04.128
HEARINGS IN THE BASEMENT. THE 
PRESIDENT COULD NOT BE PRESENT

04:53:08.882 --> 04:53:10.713
BY HIS COUNSEL AND COULD NOT 
PRESENT EVIDENCE OR 

04:53:10.714 --> 04:53:12.714
CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES AND THEN
THERE WAS A SECOND ROUND WHERE 

04:53:12.748 --> 04:53:15.996
AGAIN THEY LOCKED THE PRESIDENT 
OUT AND WE HAVE HEARD THEY JUST 

04:53:16.197 --> 04:53:18.029
SAID THE PRESIDENT HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND 

04:53:18.030 --> 04:53:21.480
IN THE THIRD ROUND OF HEARINGS 
THAT THEY HELD BEFORE THE 

04:53:22.241 --> 04:53:26.897
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AFTER ONE 
HEARING ON DECEMBER 4, SPEAKER 

04:53:27.069 --> 04:53:29.069
PELOSI

04:53:31.631 --> 04:53:33.664
ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 5 
WENT OUT AND ANNOUNCED THE 

04:53:33.864 --> 04:53:36.914
CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEEDINGS. 
SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WAS 

04:53:37.114 --> 04:53:38.745
DIRECTING CHAIRMAN ALLARD TO 
DRAFT ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 

04:53:38.746 --> 04:53:41.083
AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE DAY THAT
THEY HAD SET

04:53:48.694 --> 04:53:51.129
TO EVEN TELL THEM WHAT RIGHTS HE
WANTED TO HAVE AND TO EXERCISE 

04:53:51.342 --> 04:53:53.160
IN THEIR PROCEEDINGS. IT WAS ALL
ALREADY PREDETERMINED. THE 

04:53:53.161 --> 04:53:55.161
OUTCOME HAD BEEN PREDETERMINED 
AND THE DISHER COMMITTEE HAD 

04:53:55.192 --> 04:53:59.659
DECIDED IT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY 
FACT HEARINGS. THERE WAS NO 

04:53:59.873 --> 04:54:02.668
PROCESS AND HE WAS NEVER ALLOWED
TO PARTICIPATE. WHEN THE 

04:54:02.841 --> 04:54:07.989
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF SAYS IF YOU ONLY
ALLOW ONE SIDE TO PRESENT 

04:54:08.189 --> 04:54:11.438
EVIDENCE , THAT IS WHAT THEY DID
IN THE HOUSE. THEY HAD A 

04:54:12.191 --> 04:54:16.119
PREDETERMINED OUTCOME AND IT WAS
ALL ONE-SIDED SO FOR HIM TO 

04:54:16.321 --> 04:54:18.321
LECTURE 

04:54:26.426 --> 04:54:28.787
THIS BODY NOW ON WHAT A FAIR 
PROCESS WOULD BE, A FAIR PROCESS

04:54:28.952 --> 04:54:31.175
WOULD BE WHEN YOU COME TO THE 
DAY OF TRIAL AND YOU ARE READY 

04:54:31.349 --> 04:54:33.338
TO START THE TRIAL AND PRESENT 
YOUR CASE. THE PRESIDENT IS 

04:54:33.339 --> 04:54:36.980
READY TO PROCEED AND THE HOUSE 
MANAGER SHOULD BE READY TO 

04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:43.134
PROCEED AND THIS AMENDMENT 
SHOULD BE REJECTED. THANK YOU. 

04:54:43.536 --> 04:54:45.680
&gt;&gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE EIGHT
MINUTES REMAINING .

04:54:55.935 --> 04:54:58.770
&gt;&gt; THE HOUSE IS CERTAINLY NOT 
ASKING THE SENATE  TO DO THE 

04:54:59.522 --> 04:55:04.190
HOUSES JOB. WE ARE ASKING THE 
SENATE TO DO ITS JOB. TO HOLD A 

04:55:04.364 --> 04:55:07.412
TRIAL. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A 
TRIAL THAT DOESN'T HAVE EVIDENCE

04:55:11.971 --> 04:55:15.220
OR WITNESSES? THAT IS WHAT THIS 
AMENDMENT IS ALL ABOUT. JUST A 

04:55:15.435 --> 04:55:19.087
MOMENT ABOUT THE SUBPOENAS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REFUSED TO 

04:55:19.287 --> 04:55:23.268
PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO THE 
HOUSE AND ORDERED

04:55:28.434 --> 04:55:32.701
ALL OF HIS PEOPLE TO STONEWALL 
US. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT 

04:55:32.903 --> 04:55:37.367
WE SHOULD SPEND TWO OR THREE 
YEARS LITIGATING THAT QUESTION. 

04:55:37.769 --> 04:55:42.855
IT WAS A YOUNG LAW STUDENT 
WORKING ON THE NEXT IN 

04:55:43.056 --> 04:55:46.305
IMPEACHMENT MANY YEARS AGO AND I
REMEMBER THE DAY THAT THE 

04:55:47.067 --> 04:55:53.216
SUPREME COURT ISSUED THE 
UNANIMOUS DECISION THAT THE 

04:55:53.416 --> 04:55:55.416
PRESIDENT HAD TO RELEASE 

04:56:04.138 --> 04:56:06.556
THE TAPE. I THINK U. S. VERSUS 
DIXON STILL GOVERNS THE SENATE. 

04:56:06.724 --> 04:56:08.851
THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
LITIGATE THEM BACK TO THE 

04:56:09.610 --> 04:56:13.731
SUPREME COURT AND DOWN AGAIN FOR
IT TO BE GOOD LAW. IT IS GOOD 

04:56:13.931 --> 04:56:17.293
LAW. THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT 
COMPLIED WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS

04:56:18.799 --> 04:56:22.609
TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE TRUTH. 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HELPING THE 

04:56:22.777 --> 04:56:27.543
HOUSE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT HELPING 
THE SENATE. THIS IS ABOUT 

04:56:27.745 --> 04:56:32.770
GETTING TO THE TRUTH AND MAKING 
SURE THAT IMPARTIAL JUSTICE IS 

04:56:32.937 --> 04:56:38.659
DONE AND THAT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED THAT A FAIR

04:56:38.843 --> 04:56:41.998
TRIAL HAS BEEN HELD. I WOULD 
YIELD NOW TO MY COLLEAGUE, MR. 

04:56:42.721 --> 04:56:49.063
SCHIFF.  
&gt;&gt;  THEY SAY THE HOUSE IS NOT 

04:56:49.277 --> 04:56:52.111
READY TO PRESENT THIS CASE AND 
OF COURSE THAT IS NOT SOMETHING 

04:56:52.312 --> 04:56:54.344
YOU HEARD FROM ANY OF THE 
MANAGERS. WE ARE READY. THE 

04:56:54.559 --> 04:56:57.515
HOUSE CALLS JOHN BOLTON. THE 
HOUSE CALLS

04:57:02.276 --> 04:57:04.310
NICK MULVANEY. LET'S GET THIS 
TRIAL STARTED, SHALL WE? WE ARE 

04:57:04.509 --> 04:57:06.892
READY TO PRESENT OUR CASE AND 
CALL EYEWITNESSES. THE QUESTION 

04:57:07.062 --> 04:57:12.429
IS, WILL YOU LET US? THAT IS THE
QUESTION BEFORE US. THEY SAY IF 

04:57:12.629 --> 04:57:15.878
I SHOWED UP IN COURT AND SAID I 
WAS READY, THE JUDGE WITH THE 

04:57:16.640 --> 04:57:20.757
ONLY OUT-OF-COURT AND OF COURSE 
WE ARE SAYING WE ARE READY BUT 

04:57:20.958 --> 04:57:25.225
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF 
MR. FOREMAN WENT TO A COURT AND 

04:57:25.626 --> 04:57:28.275
THAT IS THAT I MADE A DEAL WITH 
THE DEFENDANT. I WILL NOT LET 

04:57:28.476 --> 04:57:30.709
THE PROSECUTOR CALL ANY 
WITNESSES OR LET THEM PRESENT 

04:57:31.470 --> 04:57:33.964
ANY DOCUMENTS. DO YOU KNOW WHO 
GETS THROWN OUT OF THE COURT? 

04:57:34.719 --> 04:57:40.459
THE JUDGE. THE JUDGE WOULD BE 
TAKEN OUT IN HANDCUFFS. LET'S 

04:57:40.661 --> 04:57:42.917
STEP OUT OF THIS BODY AND 
IMAGINE WHAT A REAL TRIAL WOULD 

04:57:43.093 --> 04:57:45.093
LOOK LIKE. IT WOULD BEGIN

04:57:47.973 --> 04:57:49.803
WITH THE GOVERNMENT RECEIVING 
DOCUMENTS AND BEING ABLE TO 

04:57:49.804 --> 04:57:51.804
INTRODUCE DOCUMENTS AND CALL 
WITNESSES. THIS TRIAL SHOULD BE 

04:57:52.171 --> 04:57:54.271
NO DIFFERENT. MR. PATRICK 
PHILBIN MAKES REFERENCE TO THE  

04:57:54.831 --> 04:57:59.751
LETTER WHICH WAS AN EIGHT PAGE 
LETTER ON OCTOBER 8 SAYING WE 

04:57:59.952 --> 04:58:06.452
WILL NOT DO ANYTHING YOU ASK. 
PART LAW BUT MOSTLY DIATRIBE. 

04:58:06.866 --> 04:58:11.334
YOU SHOULD READ IT. IT IS A 
LETTER THAT SAYS WHAT THE 

04:58:11.534 --> 04:58:13.969
PRESIDENT SAID ON THE TV SCREEN 
WHICH IS WE WILL FIGHT ALL 

04:58:14.202 --> 04:58:16.250
SUBPOENAS. THE DOCTRINE OF 
ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY THAT COUNSEL 

04:58:16.616 --> 04:58:23.315
REFERS TO HAS BEEN A VOTE AND 
REJECTED BY THE COURT INCLUDING 

04:58:23.515 --> 04:58:27.785
IN THE MOST RECENT DECISION WITH
THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER WHITE 

04:58:27.985 --> 04:58:32.586
HOUSE COUNSEL WHERE THE COURT 
SAID THAT WOULD MAKE HIM A KING.

04:58:33.068 --> 04:58:35.068
HE IS NO KING.

04:58:38.147 --> 04:58:40.147
THIS TRIAL DETERMINES THAT HE 
SHALL NOT BECOME A KING 

04:58:40.743 --> 04:58:46.265
ACCOUNTABLE AND ANSWERABLE TO NO
ONE. ONCE MORE, THIS IDEA OF 

04:58:46.680 --> 04:58:51.907
ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY AND THE FEVER 
DREAM HAS NO APPLICATION TO 

04:58:52.081 --> 04:58:54.081
DOCUMENTS.

04:58:56.013 --> 04:58:58.013
AGAIN, THIS AMENDMENT IS ON 
DOCUMENTS AND THERE IS NO 

04:58:58.048 --> 04:59:01.629
ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY FROM PROVIDING
DOCUMENTS. AS THE REPRESENTATIVE

04:59:05.559 --> 04:59:07.807
ILLUSTRATED, WHEN THIS CASE HAS 
GONE TO THE SUPREME COURT IN THE

04:59:08.007 --> 04:59:11.458
NIXON CASE, THE COURT HELD THAT 
THE INTEREST IN CONFIDENTIALITY 

04:59:11.659 --> 04:59:15.670
AND IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS MUST
GIVE WAY TO THE INTEREST OF THE 

04:59:15.838 --> 04:59:21.008
TRUTH AND THE SENATE AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU CANNOT 

04:59:21.763 --> 04:59:26.079
INVOKE PRIVILEGE TO PROTECT 
WRONGDOING. YOU CANNOT INVOKE 

04:59:26.289 --> 04:59:30.343
PRIVILEGE TO PROTECT EVIDENCE OF
A CONSTITUTIONAL CRIME LIKE WE 

04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:33.110
HAVE HERE.

04:59:37.045 --> 04:59:39.045
FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO 

04:59:47.790 --> 04:59:49.790
THE SECRET HEARINGS THAT COUNSEL
KEEPS REFERRING TO, THOSE SECRET

04:59:49.953 --> 04:59:52.031
DEPOSITIONS IN THE HOUSE WERE SO
SECRET THAT ONLY 100 MEMBERS OF 

04:59:52.221 --> 04:59:54.221
CONGRESS WERE ABLE TO BE THERE 
TO PARTICIPATE. THAT IS HOW 

04:59:54.253 --> 04:59:58.375
SECRET THE CHAMBER WAS. IMAGINE 
THAT IN A GRAND JURY PROCEEDING 

04:59:58.789 --> 05:00:03.858
IN THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION OR 
IN THE NIXON INVESTIGATION, 

05:00:04.471 --> 05:00:09.352
IMAGINE INVITING 50 OR 100 
MEMBERS TO SIT IN ON THOSE. 

05:00:09.753 --> 05:00:13.204
IMAGINE AS THE PRESIDENT WOULD 
LIKE, HIM INSISTING ON HAVING 

05:00:13.955 --> 05:00:17.067
HIS LAWYER AND THE GRAND JURY 
BECAUSE IT WAS A CASE 

05:00:17.268 --> 05:00:22.151
INVESTIGATED AGAINST HIM. WE 
HAVE NO GRAND JURY. WHY IS THAT?

05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:24.350
WHY WAS THERE NO SPECIAL 
PROSECUTOR? THE JUSTICE 

05:00:24.534 --> 05:00:29.654
DEPARTMENT SAID THEY WILL NOT 
LOOK INTO THIS. BILL BARS 

05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:34.935
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAID THERE IS
NOTHING TO SEE HERE. IF IT WERE 

05:00:35.150 --> 05:00:37.150
UP TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 
YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ANYTHING 

05:00:37.182 --> 05:00:40.633
ABOUT THIS. THAT IS WHY THERE 
WAS NO GRAND JURY AND WHY WE IN 

05:00:40.834 --> 05:00:44.899
THE HOUSE HAD TO DO 
INVESTIGATIVE WORK OURSELVES AND

05:00:45.099 --> 05:00:47.333
JUST LIKE IN THE NIXON CASE AND 
THE CLINTON CASE, WE USED 

05:00:47.534 --> 05:00:50.583
DEPOSITIONS AND YOU KNOW WHAT 
RULES WE USED? THE TERRIBLY 

05:00:50.985 --> 05:00:56.067
UNFAIR DEPOSITION RULES? THEY 
WERE WRITTEN BY THE REPUBLICANS 

05:00:56.265 --> 05:01:00.533
AND WE USED THE SAME RULES THAT 
THE GOP HOUSE USED. THAT IS HOW 

05:01:00.734 --> 05:01:05.349
TERRIBLY UNFAIR THEY WERE. THEY 
USED OUR RULES. HOW DARE THEY?

05:01:11.101 --> 05:01:13.133
WHY? BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT ONE 
WITNESS TO HEAR WHAT ANOTHER 

05:01:13.333 --> 05:01:17.801
WITNESS WAS SAYING SO THEY COULD
EITHER TAILOR THEIR STORIES OR 

05:01:18.002 --> 05:01:20.636
KNOW THEY HAD TO ADMIT SO MUCH. 
IT IS HOWEVER CREDIBLE 

05:01:21.389 --> 05:01:23.389
INVESTIGATION WORKS.

05:01:25.919 --> 05:01:27.952
THE COUNCIL CAN REPEAT ALL THEY 
LIKE THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 

05:01:28.152 --> 05:01:30.152
HAVE A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE OR 
HAVE COUNSEL

05:01:35.467 --> 05:01:37.467
WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
OVER TO OFFER EVIDENCE. THEY CAN

05:01:37.500 --> 05:01:40.147
SAY AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE BUT IT 
DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY MORE TRUE 

05:01:40.347 --> 05:01:44.200
WHEN THEY MAKE THE SAME FALSE 
REPRESENTATION TIME AND TIME 

05:01:44.412 --> 05:01:46.446
AGAIN. IT JUST MAKES IT THAT 
MUCH MORE DELIBERATE. THE PERSON

05:01:46.647 --> 05:01:48.464
COULD'VE PRESENTED EVIDENCE IN 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BUT HE 

05:01:48.465 --> 05:01:55.377
CHOSE NOT TO. THERE IS A REASON 
FOR THAT. THERE IS A REASON WHY 

05:01:55.613 --> 05:01:59.843
THE WITNESSES THEY TALKED ABOUT 
AREN'T MATERIAL WITNESSES. THEY 

05:02:00.043 --> 05:02:02.432
DON'T GO TO THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WITHHELD 

05:02:02.603 --> 05:02:07.521
AID FOR THE CORRUPT PURPOSE BUT 
THEY HAVE NO WITNESSES TO 

05:02:07.688 --> 05:02:10.534
ABSOLVE THE PRESIDENT ON THE 
FACTS.

05:02:14.068 --> 05:02:16.068
YOU SHOULD WANT TO SEE THESE 
DOCUMENT'S.

05:02:19.754 --> 05:02:24.823
YOU SHOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE
PRIVATE EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES

05:02:25.037 --> 05:02:30.319
HAVE TO SAY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE 

05:02:30.521 --> 05:02:32.955
PRESIDENT'S GUILT OR INNOCENCE, 
YOU WILL MAKE A DECISION ABOUT 

05:02:33.156 --> 05:02:35.189
WHETHER HE SHOULD BE REMOVED 
FROM OFFICE AND YOU SHOULD WANT 

05:02:35.951 --> 05:02:37.951
TO SEE

05:02:40.471 --> 05:02:42.904
WHAT THE DOCUMENTS SAY. IF YOU 
DON'T CARE AND YOU HAVE MADE UP 

05:02:43.667 --> 05:02:47.093
YOUR MIND THAT FOR WHATEVER 
REASON I'M NOT INTERESTED

05:02:51.638 --> 05:02:54.076
AND I DON'T REALLY WANT THE 
COUNTRY TO SEE THIS, THAT IS A 

05:02:54.278 --> 05:02:59.157
FULLY DIFFERENT MATTER BUT THAT 
IS NOT WHAT IT REQUIRES. THAT IS

05:02:59.357 --> 05:03:03.421
NOT WHAT THE OATH REQUIRES. IT 
REQUIRES YOU TO DO IMPARTIAL 

05:03:03.623 --> 05:03:08.703
JUSTICE WHICH MEANS TO SEE THE 
EVIDENCE. THAT IS ALL WE ARE 

05:03:08.904 --> 05:03:13.697
ASKING. DON'T BLIND YOURSELF TO 
THE EVIDENCE. I YIELD BACK.

05:03:21.503 --> 05:03:22.721
&gt;&gt; THE MAJORITY LEADER IS 
RECOGNIZED. 

05:03:22.722 --> 05:03:26.372
&gt;&gt; I SEND A MOTION TO THE DESK  
FOR AN AMENDMENT. 

05:03:26.373 --> 05:03:30.437
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS ON  THE 
MOTION ON 

05:03:40.553 --> 05:03:42.591
THE TABLE. IS THERE A SUFFICIENT
SECOND? THERE IS AND THE CLERK 

05:03:42.768 --> 05:03:44.100
WILL CALL THE ROLE.

&gt;&gt; THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS

05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:12.619
&gt;&gt; MR. CHIEF  JUSTICE, I SENT A

ARE RECOGNIZED TO DEBATE THE

05:17:52.091 --> 05:17:54.323
AMENDMENT AND AT THE END THE 
DEBATE TIME, I WILL MOVE TO 

05:17:54.524 --> 05:17:56.758
TABLE THE AMENDMENT AS THE 
TIMING OF THESE VOTES ARE 

05:17:56.959 --> 05:18:01.640
SPECIFIED IN THE UNDERLYING 
RESOLUTION. I HAVE CONSENT THAT 

05:18:02.042 --> 05:18:07.848
WE HAVE A RECESS. 
&gt;&gt;  THE SENATE IS IN RECESS.

05:18:14.842 --> 05:18:16.673
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE WATCHING LIVE 
COVERAGE FROM THE WASHINGTON 

05:18:16.674 --> 05:18:19.545
POST . WE WILL BE JOINING THE 
SENATE TRIAL WHEN THINGS GET 

05:18:19.713 --> 05:18:24.191
BACK INTO GEAR AND JUST A LITTLE
WHILE. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT 

05:18:24.393 --> 05:18:26.826
WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. A 
SECOND AMENDMENT HAS BEEN 

05:18:27.591 --> 05:18:33.326
OFFERED FROM CENTER CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND THE  TOP DEMOCRAT. 

05:18:33.727 --> 05:18:36.711
THIS IS FROM THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT RELATED TO CALLS AND 

05:18:36.877 --> 05:18:42.675
MEETINGS BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND THE LEADER OF UKRAINE. THIS 

05:18:42.874 --> 05:18:45.565
IS EXPECTED TO GO THE SAME ROUTE
AS THE FIRST AMENDMENT FROM THE 

05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:50.794
SENATE MINORITY LEADER AND 
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE VOTES TO 

05:18:50.993 --> 05:18:57.038
SQUASH IT. WHAT WE SAW WAS THE 
VOTE 53-47 TO TABLE THAT FIRST 

05:18:57.452 --> 05:19:03.393
ATTEMPT ENTERED INTO THIS TRIAL 
PROCESS. LET'S GO BACK OVER SOME

05:19:03.594 --> 05:19:08.877
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT WE 
HAVE SEEN SO FAR TODAY. YOU CAN 

05:19:09.077 --> 05:19:12.665
LISTEN BACK TO SOME OF THAT TAPE
WE HAVE HEARD AND SOME OF THE 

05:19:12.828 --> 05:19:17.906
HIGHLIGHTS THAT HAVE RESONATED 
AS WE WATCH THIS PROCESS UNFOLD 

05:19:18.212 --> 05:19:22.275
AND ONE SUBJECT THAT KEPT COMING
UP WAS THE HANDLING OF THE 

05:19:22.890 --> 05:19:26.742
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IN HIS NAME 
KEPT COMING UP BY THE REPUBLICAN

05:19:27.002 --> 05:19:30.552
SIDE OF THE DEFENSE AND SCHIFF 
WHO IS THE LEAD 

05:19:35.074 --> 05:19:37.074
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER TOOK TO THE 
PODIUM TO DEFEND HIMSELF. LET'S 

05:19:37.135 --> 05:19:38.724
LISTEN. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR THEM ATTACKED  

05:19:38.725 --> 05:19:40.958
THE HOUSE MINIATURES, WHAT YOU 
ARE REALLY HEARING IS WE DON'T 

05:19:41.173 --> 05:19:45.024
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENTS GUILT. WHEN I WANT TO

05:19:45.237 --> 05:19:49.086
TALK ABOUT THE McCONNELL 
RESOLUTION AND HOW UNFAIR IT IS.

05:19:49.286 --> 05:19:55.586
WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW 
BACKWARDS IT IS TO HAVE A TRIAL 

05:19:55.786 --> 05:19:59.652
AND THEN ASKED FOR WITNESSES. SO
WE WILL ATTACK THE HOUSE 

05:19:59.853 --> 05:20:01.884
MINIATURES BECAUSE MAYBE WE CAN 
DISTRACT YOU FOR A MOMENT FROM 

05:20:02.084 --> 05:20:07.569
WHAT IS BEFORE YOU. MAYBE IF WE 
ATTACK HOUSE MINIATURES YOU'LL 

05:20:07.781 --> 05:20:09.822
BE THINKING ABOUT THEM INSTEAD 
OF THE GUILT OF THE PRESIDENT. 

05:20:10.026 --> 05:20:12.026
&gt;&gt;  THAT IS

05:20:14.483 --> 05:20:16.717
ADAM SCHIFF TALKING ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT HE WAS THE SUBJECT OF 

05:20:16.918 --> 05:20:19.150
MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN DEFENSE  
SO FAR TODAY. LET'S GO TO 

05:20:19.911 --> 05:20:22.681
CAPITOL HILL TO THOSE THAT HAVE 
BEEN FOLLOWING THE PROCEEDINGS. 

05:20:23.016 --> 05:20:27.224
LET'S TALK THROUGH THE LATEST 
AMENDMENT THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT 

05:20:27.397 --> 05:20:34.181
UP. THIS DOESN'T HOLD MUCH OF A 
CHANCE OF PASSAGE BUT WHY IS IT 

05:20:34.383 --> 05:20:36.615
SIGNIFICANT THAT HE HAS BROUGHT 
UP THIS REQUEST FOR MORE 

05:20:36.829 --> 05:20:40.678
DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT? 

05:20:40.679 --> 05:20:44.342
&gt;&gt; THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE DOCUMENTS  

05:20:44.743 --> 05:20:47.391
THAT INVESTIGATORS WANTED DID 
COME FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

05:20:47.791 --> 05:20:52.055
SO WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW
IS SAYING WE NEED THESE 

05:20:52.256 --> 05:20:54.981
DOCUMENTS AND ANY SORT OF 
EVIDENCE THAT WILL COME LATER. 

05:20:55.305 --> 05:21:00.134
HE SAID IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THE
STATE DEPARTMENT IS KEY TO THE 

05:21:00.299 --> 05:21:05.054
ENTIRE TRIAL AND EVIDENCE AND 
DOCUMENTS IN ANYTHING THAT CAN 

05:21:05.269 --> 05:21:10.133
HELP THEM MAKE THAT DECISION 
WHETHER TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT 

05:21:10.347 --> 05:21:12.347
TRUMP OR NOT WOULD COME FROM 
HAVING INFORMATION FROM THE 

05:21:12.932 --> 05:21:14.813
STATE DEPARTMENT AND AS 
MENTIONED THE FIRST AMENDMENT 

05:21:14.814 --> 05:21:17.449
THAT HE BROUGHT UP EARLIER WHICH
WAS TO SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM 

05:21:17.649 --> 05:21:23.344
THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT THEY GET 
TABLED AND FAILED AND WE ARE 

05:21:23.545 --> 05:21:26.335
EXPERT IN THIS NEXT ONE AS WELL 
TO THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, 

05:21:26.520 --> 05:21:29.226
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER DID TELL A
ROOM FULL OF REPORTERS  THAT HE 

05:21:29.441 --> 05:21:33.693
WOULD BRING A SERIES OF THESE 
AMENDMENTS SO THESE ARE JUST TWO

05:21:33.906 --> 05:21:39.189
SO FAR AND HE MAY COME WITH 
MORE. THEY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL

05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:41.390
BUT AT LEAST IT

05:21:44.672 --> 05:21:46.290
SHOWS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING
TO GET EVIDENCE. 

05:21:46.291 --> 05:21:49.340
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS SENDING OUT TO YOU SO
FAR IN THE TONE OF THE DETAILS  

05:21:49.541 --> 05:21:52.389
THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN 
BRINGING UP? 

05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:54.423
&gt;&gt; EVEN THE WHAT IS HAPPENING 
RIGHT NOW IS THEY ARE 

05:21:54.660 --> 05:21:56.660
TECHNICALLY DEBATING THESE 
AMENDMENTS  AND DEBATING THE 

05:21:56.804 --> 05:22:00.107
ORGANIZING RESOLUTION BUT WHAT 
REALLY SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING IS 

05:22:00.307 --> 05:22:03.158
WE ARE GETTING A PREVIEW OF WHAT
BOTH SIDES ARGUMENTS WILL BE 

05:22:03.358 --> 05:22:05.593
WHEN THEY START THE OPENING 
ARGUMENT PHASE AND SO FAR WE 

05:22:05.794 --> 05:22:11.475
HAVE HEARD FROM PAT, THE WHITE 
HOUSE LEAD COUNSEL AND OTHERS ON

05:22:12.225 --> 05:22:18.392
THAT TEAM SAY THEY ARE READY TO 
GET THIS DONE. THEY SAY THE 

05:22:18.592 --> 05:22:21.227
HOUSE HAS TOLD ENOUGH AND THEY 
ARE READY BECAUSE THEY SAID ALL 

05:22:21.428 --> 05:22:23.428
IT IS DOING

05:22:26.713 --> 05:22:28.542
IS UNDOING THE 2016 ELECTION 
IMPOSSIBLE INTERFERING IN THE 

05:22:28.543 --> 05:22:30.575
2020 ELECTION SO THOSE ARE 
COMMON THEMES THAT WE READ OVER 

05:22:30.775 --> 05:22:33.209
THE WEEKEND WHEN THEY RELEASED 
THE BRIEFING AND THEN ON THE 

05:22:33.424 --> 05:22:38.497
HOUSE MANAGER SIDE, IT'S ALMOST 
LIKE WATCHING A CLASS. THEY ARE 

05:22:38.694 --> 05:22:41.943
GOING THERE WITH EVIDENCE OF 
DIFFERENT WITNESSES TESTIMONIES 

05:22:42.158 --> 05:22:44.158
THAT HAVE OCCURRED

05:22:48.445 --> 05:22:50.476
AND THEY KEEP REFRESHING OUR 
MEMORY OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS 

05:22:50.676 --> 05:22:52.707
MISCONDUCT THAT WAS DONE BY THE 
PRESIDENT. REALLY, IT IS LIKE 

05:22:52.923 --> 05:22:58.608
THE OPENING OPENING ARGUMENTS 
THAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW AND

05:22:58.808 --> 05:23:00.639
THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN SENDING 
OUT TO ME. 

05:23:00.640 --> 05:23:03.474
&gt;&gt; I LOVE IT AND THANK YOU SO 
MUCH.  THANK YOU FOR PAYING 

05:23:03.690 --> 05:23:05.690
ATTENTION TO THIS WITH US.

05:23:10.587 --> 05:23:12.819
TOM, JUST WEEKS AGO, IT FEELS 
LIKE IT COULD'VE BEEN YEARS AGO 

05:23:13.020 --> 05:23:15.668
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF HOW 
MUCH HAPPENED BUT A COUPLE WEEKS

05:23:15.869 --> 05:23:19.733
AGO, YOU ARE REPORTING THE 
QUESTIONS OF WHETHER JOHN BOLTON

05:23:19.933 --> 05:23:22.367
MIGHT BE WILLING TO TESTIFY 
BEFORE THE SENATE AND YOU ARE 

05:23:22.568 --> 05:23:26.633
REPORTING WITH THE TEAM THAT HE 
SAID HE WOULD COME BEFORE THE 

05:23:26.833 --> 05:23:31.260
SENATE IF SUBPOENAED BUT WE ARE 
NOW SEEING EFFORTS BEHIND THE 

05:23:31.438 --> 05:23:37.814
SCENE TO SORT OF MINIMIZE HOW 
OPEN THAT MIGHT BE AND WHETHER 

05:23:38.015 --> 05:23:40.015
WE SEE HIM COME BEFORE THE 
SENATE.

05:23:44.099 --> 05:23:46.546
OUR CALLINGS ARE REPORTING THAT 
THERE IS CONVERSATION ABOUT 

05:23:46.748 --> 05:23:52.178
WHETHER OR NOT THAT COULD BE 
DONE SO WHY IS BOLTON SO KEY TO 

05:23:52.357 --> 05:23:55.882
THIS? 
&gt;&gt; IN A DRAMA THAT WE HAVE BEEN 

05:23:56.084 --> 05:24:00.968
WATCHING ALL DAY  THAT IN SOME 
WAYS SEEMS VERY PREDICTABLE 

05:24:01.370 --> 05:24:05.835
GIVEN HOW ENTRENCHED BOTH 
PARTIES ARE AND HOW SECURE THE 

05:24:06.036 --> 05:24:13.150
REPUBLICAN LEADER FEELS IN THE 
OVERALL LOYALTY OF REPUBLICANS 

05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:18.152
BUT THE ONE WILDCARD AND THE ONE
THING THAT COULD UPSET

05:24:21.681 --> 05:24:25.747
A PREDICTABLE OUTCOME HERE IS 
JOHN BOLTON. WHY? JOHN BOLTON IS

05:24:25.986 --> 05:24:28.279
A BROKEN VETERAN WAS STRONG 
CONSERVATIVE AND FOREIGN POLICY

05:24:32.247 --> 05:24:35.697
BONA FIDES AND TWO, HE SERVED AS
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO 

05:24:35.899 --> 05:24:39.764
DONALD TRUMP AND WE KNOW FROM 
THE TESTIMONY OF OTHERS THAT A 

05:24:39.965 --> 05:24:44.233
HE WAS UNHAPPY WITH SOME OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIONS OF FOREIGN 

05:24:44.435 --> 05:24:48.899
POLICY DECISIONS AND NOT ONLY 
WITH REGARD TO UKRAINE WHERE HE 

05:24:49.099 --> 05:24:50.730
BLEW HIS STACK ABOUT RUDY 
GIULIANI'S INVOLVEMENT CALLING 

05:24:50.731 --> 05:24:58.244
IT A DRUG DEAL BUT ALSO 
VENEZUELA AND TURKEY. THREE 

05:24:58.444 --> 05:25:02.023
HOTSPOTS AROUND THE GLOBE RIGHT 
NOW. THREE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

05:25:02.867 --> 05:25:08.811
ARGUABLY. SO, JOHN BOLTON HAS 
HINTED THAT HE HAS SIGNIFICANT 

05:25:09.011 --> 05:25:13.690
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT 
OPERATION AND UNLIKE THE PARADE 

05:25:14.452 --> 05:25:21.808
OF WITNESSES WITH THE TEAM 
TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY THAT 

05:25:22.009 --> 05:25:25.661
CAME BEFORE THE HOUSE AND SPOKE 
ABOUT WHAT THEY KNEW OR HEARD 

05:25:25.874 --> 05:25:31.558
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. JOHN BOLTON
HAD AT LEAST ONE AND MORE LIKELY

05:25:31.757 --> 05:25:33.757
TWO THAT WE HAVE DOCUMENTED WITH
ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WITH DONALD 

05:25:33.791 --> 05:25:38.058
TRUMP TALKING ABOUT UKRAINE AND 
THE POLICY. HE IS A FIRST-HAND 

05:25:38.259 --> 05:25:42.525
WITNESS TO THE PRESIDENT WITH 
DECISION-MAKING AND COULD BE A 

05:25:43.287 --> 05:25:48.420
CRITICAL WITNESS THAT BECAUSE OF
HIS STANDING AND KNOWLEDGE OF 

05:25:48.622 --> 05:25:54.303
HIS ONE-ON-ONE EXPERIENCE COULD 
BE A PERSUASIVE WITNESS AND ONE 

05:25:54.505 --> 05:25:58.285
THAT COULD MOVE SOME VOTES AND 
EVEN CHANGE

05:26:03.037 --> 05:26:05.819
PUBLIC OPINION AND OF THAT IS 
CERTAIN BUT THAT IS THE REASON 

05:26:05.991 --> 05:26:11.169
THAT JOHN BOLTON IS A WILDCARD 
AND WHOSE NAME KEEPS COMING UP 

05:26:11.369 --> 05:26:15.837
BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO TRY TO 
PREDICT ONE FIGURE THAT MIGHT 

05:26:16.035 --> 05:26:18.035
INFLUENCE WHAT OTHERWISE SEEMS 
TO BE A PRINTABLE COURSE OF 

05:26:18.069 --> 05:26:24.368
EVENTS,  THAT IS JOHN BOLTON. 
&gt;&gt;  IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR SOME OF

05:26:24.569 --> 05:26:26.814
THE MODERATE REPUBLICANS TO SAY 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM JOHN 

05:26:27.016 --> 05:26:29.248
BOLTON DEPENDING HOW THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE ABLE TO LAY OUT 

05:26:29.449 --> 05:26:31.683
THEIR CASE AND FOCUS ON THE 
FACTS AND WHAT OTHER WITNESSES 

05:26:31.883 --> 05:26:36.350
POINTED TO IN TERMS OF THE 
CONVERSATIONS HE WAS INVOLVED 

05:26:36.563 --> 05:26:41.832
WITH AND THE THINGS THAT HE SAID
TO PEOPLE LIKE FIONA HILL AND IF

05:26:42.048 --> 05:26:46.314
THEY KEEP HAMMERING THAT WITH 
THE ACTIVE AUDIENCE OF THE 

05:26:46.515 --> 05:26:50.982
SENATE LISTEN TO THEM, IT MIGHT 
BE HARDER FOR THE MODERATE TO 

05:26:51.384 --> 05:26:53.618
SAY WE DON'T HEAR FROM THEM. 
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

05:26:53.819 --> 05:26:57.228
WHAT  JOHN BOLTON WILL SAY. I 
THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A 

05:26:57.391 --> 05:27:01.548
GAMBLE TO SAY NO. ESPECIALLY 
WHEN THERE IS THIS NEW PROSPECT 

05:27:01.949 --> 05:27:06.816
OF TESTIFYING BEHIND CLOSED 
DOORS AND THAT MIGHT BE AN EXTRA

05:27:07.031 --> 05:27:12.098
LAYER OF SECURITY AND ESPECIALLY
THOSE THAT ARE HAVING TO GO HOME

05:27:12.314 --> 05:27:15.563
AND EXPLAIN TO CONSTITUENTS WHY 
THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR THEM TO BE 

05:27:15.764 --> 05:27:23.678
IN THE BODY WHERE THERE ARE 
QUITE A FEW REPUBLICANS AND 

05:27:24.094 --> 05:27:27.545
SEEING THAT EXAMPLE WHERE HE SHE
FOUND HERSELF IN THIS POSITION 

05:27:27.946 --> 05:27:29.946
OF BEING THE REPUBLICAN SWING 
VOTE

05:27:33.426 --> 05:27:35.873
ON MANY ISSUES BUT THIS MIGHT BE
THE TOUGHEST SPOT SHE HAS BEEN 

05:27:36.075 --> 05:27:37.904
PUT IN YET. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRESENCE

05:27:37.905 --> 05:27:40.542
DEFENSE TEAM  AND HOW THEY ARE 
DOING. WE GET A SENSE OF HOW 

05:27:40.742 --> 05:27:46.440
THEY PLAN TO DEFEND THE 
PRESIDENT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS 

05:27:46.840 --> 05:27:49.475
ABOUT SETTING UP THE FRAMEWORK 
FOR THE NEXT DAYS AND WEEKS. WE 

05:27:49.690 --> 05:27:53.285
ARE GETTING A SENSE OF WHO MIGHT
DO WHAT LIFTING. 

05:27:53.286 --> 05:27:57.357
&gt;&gt;  SORT OF FOR THE FIRST TIME 
GETTING A DIRECT SENSE OF 

05:27:57.530 --> 05:27:59.530
HEARING THESE PEOPLE THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN

05:28:03.300 --> 05:28:05.731
IN LETTER FORM AND HEARD ABOUT 
THE DEFENSES THAT THEY ARE GIVEN

05:28:05.933 --> 05:28:10.401
BUT WE ARE SEEING THEM GO BEFORE
THE NATION NOW AND EXPLAIN WHY 

05:28:10.602 --> 05:28:13.851
THEY THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SHOULD NOT BE CONVICTED AND THE 

05:28:14.052 --> 05:28:17.722
MEMBERS IN THE CENTER HEARING 
WHY PARTY MEMBERS THINK THEY 

05:28:17.917 --> 05:28:23.400
SHOULD NOT BE CONVICTED AND THEY
ARE ALSO LIVING PRESIDENT TRUMP 

05:28:23.802 --> 05:28:27.465
WHO WAS ACROSS THE OCEAN IN 
EUROPE RIGHT NOW SEE HOW THEY 

05:28:27.699 --> 05:28:31.531
WILL BACK FOR HIM AND YOU CAN 
BET THAT HE WILL RENDER A 

05:28:31.732 --> 05:28:33.965
VERDICT ON THAT. 
&gt;&gt; ONE THING THAT HAS STOOD OUT 

05:28:34.166 --> 05:28:38.845
IS  THE OPENING STATEMENTS BY 
THE PRESENCE TEAM INCLUDING 

05:28:39.046 --> 05:28:41.046
THINGS THAT FRANKLY WEREN'T 
TRUE. THE LEGAL TEAM STARTED 

05:28:41.428 --> 05:28:43.428
THEIR DEFENSE

05:28:45.546 --> 05:28:47.546
WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT 
FACTUALLY CORRECT. LET'S TALK 

05:28:47.928 --> 05:28:51.031
ABOUT MATT TALK ABOUT THE 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. 

05:28:51.032 --> 05:28:53.464
&gt;&gt; NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY  HAS A PRESIDENT 

05:28:54.223 --> 05:28:58.493
BEEN CONFRONTED WITH THIS KIND 
OF IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING IN THE

05:28:58.716 --> 05:29:03.818
HOUSE. IT WASN'T CONDUCTED BY 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT MR. 

05:29:04.032 --> 05:29:06.666
NADLER WHEN HE APPLIED FOR A JOB
TOLD HIS COLLEAGUES WHEN THEY 

05:29:06.867 --> 05:29:11.491
TOOK OVER THE HOUSE THAT HE WAS 
REALLY GOOD AT IMPEACHMENT. WHAT

05:29:11.659 --> 05:29:16.776
HAPPENED WAS THE PROCEEDINGS 
TOOK PLACE IN A BASEMENT OF THE 

05:29:16.937 --> 05:29:19.237
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

05:29:23.531 --> 05:29:25.531
THE PRESIDENT WAS FORBIDDEN FROM
ATTENDING. THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT

05:29:25.551 --> 05:29:28.602
ALLOWED TO HAVE A LAWYER 
PRESENT. AND EVERY OTHER 

05:29:29.351 --> 05:29:32.600
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GIVEN A 

05:29:32.770 --> 05:29:42.617
MINIMAL DUE PROCESS BUT NOTHING 
HERE. NOT EVEN MR. 

05:29:42.817 --> 05:29:45.822
SCHIFF'S REPUBLICAN CALLINGS 
WERE ALLOWED . 

05:29:45.823 --> 05:29:51.765
&gt;&gt;  WHAT HE SAID WAS ACTUALLY 
NOT TRUE. THIS GIFT IS A SENSE 

05:29:52.367 --> 05:29:56.632
OF COMPARTMENTALIZED INFORMATION
FACILITY THAT IS A SECURE ROOM 

05:29:56.833 --> 05:29:59.280
FOR INTELLIGENCE BUT LET'S 
UNPACK WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S 

05:30:00.043 --> 05:30:03.346
LAWYERS SAID BECAUSE REPUBLICANS
ACTUALLY WERE ALLOWED IN THERE 

05:30:03.545 --> 05:30:08.616
SO GOING NOW TO ONE OF OUR 
REPORTERS HAS BEEN FOLLOWING 

05:30:08.885 --> 05:30:10.885
THIS AND HE IS OUR NATIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT JOINING ME BY 

05:30:11.063 --> 05:30:16.347
PHONE IN NEW YORK. SO, YOU HAVE 
BEEN TRACKING EXACTLY WHAT THE 

05:30:16.542 --> 05:30:18.709
ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN SAYING AND 
REGISTERING SOME OF THE 

05:30:18.871 --> 05:30:20.871
FALSEHOODS

05:30:23.442 --> 05:30:25.073
THAT WERE A BASIC PREMISES FOR 
THEIR ARGUMENT. 

05:30:25.074 --> 05:30:29.139
&gt;&gt;  JUST WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FOR 
YEARS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKE 

05:30:29.339 --> 05:30:33.428
TO SEE A PARTICULAR STYLE WHEN 
HE IS TUNING IN ON TELEVISION 

05:30:33.607 --> 05:30:36.994
AND HIS TWO ATTORNEYS THAT 
STARTED OFF GAVE HIM EXACTLY 

05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:44.521
THAT. THEY WERE VERY FORCEFUL 
AND VERY PRONE TO REITERATING 

05:30:44.695 --> 05:30:46.695
ARGUMENTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN 
BORNE OUT.

05:30:50.460 --> 05:30:52.495
FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARGUMENT THAT 
WE JUST HEARD ABOUT HOW THE 

05:30:52.694 --> 05:30:54.524
REPUBLICANS WERE EXCLUDED FROM 
THE PROCESS, THERE ISN'T REALLY 

05:30:54.525 --> 05:30:58.390
A LOT OF TRUTH TO IT. IT IS 
CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT NOT 

05:30:58.591 --> 05:31:01.640
EVERY MEMBER IS ALLOWED INTO 
THESE HEARINGS BUT THERE WERE A 

05:31:01.840 --> 05:31:06.921
LOT OF REPUBLICANS THAT WERE AND
A LOT DID ATTEND THE HEARINGS 

05:31:07.122 --> 05:31:09.554
AND THEY TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE 
TIME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE 

05:31:09.756 --> 05:31:13.624
COMING FROM REPUBLICANS. SO, 
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH

05:31:14.025 --> 05:31:18.692
THE REPRESENTATION WAS WRONG AND
I ALSO WANT TO SAY IT IS SORT OF

05:31:18.908 --> 05:31:21.139
REMARKABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE 
PAST HISTORY BECAUSE THIS HAS 

05:31:21.340 --> 05:31:28.041
NOT HAPPENED TWICE. IT'S NOT THE
SORT OF THING THAT IS A ROBUST 

05:31:28.242 --> 05:31:31.691
BODY OF WORK THAT WE CAN POINT 
TO. 

05:31:31.692 --> 05:31:36.573
&gt;&gt; IS A GREAT  POINT AND THEY 
ALSO TALKED ABOUT STATEMENTS 

05:31:36.774 --> 05:31:41.992
THAT CHAIRMAN SCHIFF  MADE WHEN 
THE PROCESS WAS OPENING UP AND 

05:31:42.162 --> 05:31:44.449
STARTING. SCHIFF TRIED TO 
SUMMARIZE THIS CALL  AND

05:31:49.775 --> 05:31:51.406
SCHIFF USE THE HYPERBOLE IN 
DESCRIBING AND BASICALLY 

05:31:51.407 --> 05:31:53.842
DESCRIBED AS A CLASSIC  CRIME 
ORGANIZED SHAKEDOWN AND HE 

05:31:54.043 --> 05:31:56.043
IMITATED THE CALL. WE HAVE HEARD

05:32:02.372 --> 05:32:04.372
PAT SAY THIS WAS A COMPLETE 
VACANT SOMETHING THAT NEVER 

05:32:04.406 --> 05:32:06.022
HAPPENED SO THAT SEEMS TO BE 
STRETCHING POSSIBILITY. 

05:32:06.023 --> 05:32:10.692
&gt;&gt;  YEAH, ESSENTIALLY WHAT 
SCHIFF WAS DOING WAS  SHORTLY 

05:32:11.443 --> 05:32:17.349
AFTER THE JULY CALL AND SAYING 
HERE IS THE GIST OF WHAT HAD 

05:32:17.526 --> 05:32:23.035
HAPPENED. IN ADDITION TO 
MISREPRESENTING, THEY ALSO GOT 

05:32:23.266 --> 05:32:25.266
THE TIMING WRONG

05:32:27.757 --> 05:32:29.757
BUT THIS AGAIN IS A FAVORITE 
TALKING POINT OF PRESIDENT 

05:32:29.790 --> 05:32:34.255
TRUMP. HE HAS REPEATEDLY ARGUED 
OFTEN SAYING THAT SCHIFF MADE 

05:32:34.468 --> 05:32:39.548
THIS REPRESENTATION  BUT TRUMP 
HAS FREQUENTLY ARGUED THAT 

05:32:39.749 --> 05:32:42.383
SCHIFF WAS TRYING TO MISLEAD THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MISREPRESENT

05:32:42.584 --> 05:32:45.569
WHAT HAPPENED AND BASICALLY LIED
AND SCHIFF HIMSELF 

05:32:50.059 --> 05:32:54.780
DID SAY THIS IS NOT ACCURATE AND
I'M NOT TRYING TO CONVEY THIS 

05:32:54.980 --> 05:32:58.956
WORD FOR WORD BUT THE 
PRESENTATION IS REALLY NOT

05:33:04.124 --> 05:33:05.942
RESPECT. 
&gt;&gt; STAY WITH US. WE WANT TO GET 

05:33:05.943 --> 05:33:08.591
A SENSE OF WHY THIS IS SO  
SIGNIFICANT AND HOW THIS IS 

05:33:08.792 --> 05:33:11.639
STANDING OUT IN THE OPENING 
MOMENT. 

05:33:11.640 --> 05:33:14.716
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE FACT THAT IT IS 
FIRST  AND THAT THEY ARE GOING 

05:33:14.891 --> 05:33:19.959
FOR SOME OF THESE RED MEAT 
ARGUMENTS AND THEY ARE ARGUING 

05:33:20.726 --> 05:33:22.726
THIS PROCESS IN ADDITION

05:33:27.890 --> 05:33:29.890
TO WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP DID 
ANYTHING WRONG. WE SAW 

05:33:29.928 --> 05:33:33.975
REPUBLICANS OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEEDINGS THROW A LOT OF 

05:33:34.175 --> 05:33:39.258
DEFENSE OF THE WALL BUT ONE 
CONSISTENT THEME WAS AT THE 

05:33:39.459 --> 05:33:41.291
HOUSE DEMOCRATS THAT WERE 
CONDUCTING THIS HAD DONE SO 

05:33:41.292 --> 05:33:46.574
INAPPROPRIATELY WITH NOT GIVING 
TIME AND DOING THINGS LIKE 

05:33:46.775 --> 05:33:48.775
ACCUSING SCHIFF OF BEING 
MISLEADING IN THE ARGUMENT  

05:33:48.942 --> 05:33:55.104
WHICH WAS A BIT OF A STRETCH. HE
WAS DOING MORE THAN PARAPHRASING

05:33:55.864 --> 05:33:58.269
AND HEATED SO FAIRLY ACCURATELY 
BUT YOU CAN EXPECT

05:34:01.800 --> 05:34:03.834
LIKE WE DID TODAY, A LOT OF 
ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS 

05:34:04.586 --> 05:34:07.499
WANT ABOUT THEIR HEARING. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S BRING TOM INTO THE 

05:34:07.700 --> 05:34:13.585
CONVERSATION. 
&gt;&gt;  I DID THINK THE POINT THAT 

05:34:13.786 --> 05:34:16.370
THE REPUBLICAN MANAGERS MADE 
ABOUT

05:34:20.644 --> 05:34:22.644
CHAIRMAN

05:34:24.966 --> 05:34:26.999
SCHIFF'S CARICATURE AND TALKING 
IN A MAFIA WASTED POINT TO ONE 

05:34:27.200 --> 05:34:29.634
OF TWO ERRORS THAT  SCHIFF HAS 
MADE IN AN OTHERWISE PRETTY 

05:34:30.384 --> 05:34:32.384
PERFORMANCE .

05:34:34.917 --> 05:34:37.706
ONE WAS LEADING THAT OPENING FOR
THE CRITICISM WE SAW TODAY. THE 

05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:44.464
DEMOCRATS LED BY SCHIFF AND  
SPEAKER PELOSI HAD THE SOMBER 

05:34:44.866 --> 05:34:46.866
NATURE OF THIS PROCEEDING AND TO
GO INTO

05:34:50.763 --> 05:34:53.757
A CARICATURE OF THE PRESENT WAS 
A MISTAKE. HE HAS BEEN CALLED ON

05:34:53.939 --> 05:34:56.848
IT AND I THOUGHT THE OTHER 
MISTAKE RELATES TO SOMETHING WE 

05:34:57.062 --> 05:35:04.365
TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO WHICH 
IS THE CURIOUS SLOWNESS OR PAUSE

05:35:04.566 --> 05:35:09.648
THAT THE DEMOCRATS PUT ON THE 
EFFORT TO SUBPOENA JOHN BOLTON. 

05:35:10.063 --> 05:35:12.295
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A COUPLE OF 
DECISIONS IN WHICH WE THINK THE 

05:35:12.495 --> 05:35:14.529
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP MUST HAVE 
PLAYED A ROLE AND I WONDER IF 

05:35:14.728 --> 05:35:20.819
NOW THEY ARE NOT REGRETTING IT. 
IT GOES BACK TO THE REQUEST BY 

05:35:21.031 --> 05:35:24.030
BOTH AND HIS ATTORNEY AND THE 
EFFORT TO BRING THAT CASE TO THE

05:35:24.202 --> 05:35:29.563
DEPUTY TO FORCE A SUBPOENA FROM 
THE HOUSE AND THEN FORCE THE 

05:35:29.763 --> 05:35:33.826
COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER IN FACT
GOVERNMENT AND JUMBLE SHOULD HE 

05:35:34.588 --> 05:35:36.588
BE SUBPOENAED

05:35:38.495 --> 05:35:40.526
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TESTIFY 
BEFORE THE HOUSE. IT WOULD ALSO 

05:35:40.726 --> 05:35:43.372
SET A PRECEDENT FOR TESTIFYING 
BEFORE THE SENATE AS WELL FOR A 

05:35:44.135 --> 05:35:48.242
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND 
THE DEMOCRATS COUNSEL ASKED THAT

05:35:48.477 --> 05:35:52.630
THE SUIT BE DROPPED. THEY NEVER 
ISSUED A SUBPOENA TO JOHN BOLTON

05:35:53.524 --> 05:35:57.991
BUT WHY NOT? WHY NOT PURSUE 
EVERY LEGAL AVENUE TO GET THIS 

05:35:58.192 --> 05:36:00.192
WITNESS AND OTHER

05:36:03.475 --> 05:36:05.923
WITNESSES TO TESTIFY BUT IT IS A
CASE OF THE BALL BEING DROPPED 

05:36:06.123 --> 05:36:08.558
OR THAT IS HOW IT SEEMS TO ME. 
THEY HAVE AN ARGUMENT TO 

05:36:08.759 --> 05:36:13.425
EXPLAIN.  
&gt;&gt;  THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IT WAS 

05:36:13.641 --> 05:36:16.074
A DISTRACTION AND IT TAKES TOO 
MUCH TIME. THEY HAD ALREADY 

05:36:16.279 --> 05:36:18.279
DEVELOPED A SIGNIFICANT CASE 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

05:36:18.307 --> 05:36:21.355
UNITED STATES AND THEY HAD 
ANOTHER CASE THAT WOULD HAVE 

05:36:21.556 --> 05:36:25.422
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE THAT A 
FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL BEGAN

05:36:25.622 --> 05:36:27.622
AND THAT WAS WHEN THEY PROVED

05:36:32.322 --> 05:36:34.556
TO PUT THEIR LEGAL EGGS INTO 
THAT BASKET IF YOU WILL. THE 

05:36:34.758 --> 05:36:36.791
QUESTION IS WHY NOT PURSUE EVERY
OPTION AND PARTICULARLY ONE THAT

05:36:36.992 --> 05:36:39.226
IS LAID ON THE TABLE FOR A 
WITNESS THAT COULD BE OF 

05:36:39.980 --> 05:36:45.271
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE'S.  
&gt;&gt;  I WANT TO BRING OUT JAY WHO 

05:36:45.457 --> 05:36:49.177
IS PRESENT THE PRESIDENT AND HE 
SAID A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT 

05:36:49.392 --> 05:36:51.824
ALSO WERE NOT CORRECT. HE 
CLAIMED WHITE HOUSE WAS NOT 

05:36:52.024 --> 05:36:56.692
ALLOWED TO HAVE COUNSEL DURING 
THE HOUSE PHASE OF THIS AND THAT

05:36:56.906 --> 05:36:59.139
IS NOT TRUE. THE WHITE HOUSE 
ELECTED TO NOT BE INVOLVED IN 

05:36:59.339 --> 05:37:01.574
THAT AND ALSO USE THE KEY PHRASE
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS VERY 

05:37:01.773 --> 05:37:03.773
FOND OF, NO OBSTRUCTION SAYING 
THAT ROBERT MILLER AND THE 

05:37:03.807 --> 05:37:07.820
SPECIAL COUNSEL FOUND NO 
OBSTRUCTION BUT THAT IS ALSO NOT

05:37:08.000 --> 05:37:13.367
TRUE. THAT DOES SEEM TO BE 
APPEALING TO EXACTLY WHAT 

05:37:13.606 --> 05:37:15.462
PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT WANT TO 
HEAR. 

05:37:15.463 --> 05:37:19.665
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.  I 
THINK IT WAS AN EVEN MORE 

05:37:19.866 --> 05:37:24.132
OBVIOUS WAY IN WHICH HE DID THAT
AND HE MADE A REFERENCE TO AN 

05:37:24.331 --> 05:37:28.360
INSURANCE POLICY WHICH FOR A 
CERTAIN SEGMENT, THE AMERICAN 

05:37:28.531 --> 05:37:30.531
PUBLISHING

05:37:34.498 --> 05:37:36.498
HAS AN IMMEDIATE REACTION AND 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HE MEANS 

05:37:36.532 --> 05:37:38.966
WHEN HE SAYS THAT. HE IS 
REFERRING TO A TEXT MESSAGE FROM

05:37:39.166 --> 05:37:41.400
ONE FBI EMPLOYEE TO ANOTHER 
WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF 

05:37:41.600 --> 05:37:43.836
CONTEXT TO TRY TO PRESENT THAT 
THERE WAS THIS BIG CONSPIRACY TO

05:37:44.035 --> 05:37:49.519
COME UP WITH INSURANCE POLICIES 
AND THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY WHAT 

05:37:49.732 --> 05:37:52.718
THE MESSAGE WAS ABOUT BUT THIS 
HAS BEEN USED OVER AND OVER 

05:37:52.898 --> 05:37:58.667
AGAIN AS A SELF EVIDENT 
DEMONSTRATION OF THE EXISTENCE 

05:37:58.868 --> 05:38:00.868
OF THIS SORT OF CONSPIRACY.

05:38:06.583 --> 05:38:08.583
THAT ATTORNEY MAKING THIS CASE 
ON THE SENATE FLOOR ABOUT 

05:38:08.617 --> 05:38:14.715
IMPEACHMENT REFERRED TO THIS 
CONSERVATIVE TALKING POINT THAT 

05:38:14.915 --> 05:38:16.915
I THINK IS EXTREMELY TELLING 
ABOUT

05:38:20.397 --> 05:38:24.062
THIS IN PART. 
&gt;&gt;  YOU ALSO HAD A STORE TODAY 

05:38:24.463 --> 05:38:30.347
ABOUT THE ROLE OF CHIEF JUSTICE 
ROBERTS AND IT IS INTERESTING TO

05:38:30.561 --> 05:38:34.625
SEE HOW ACTIVE HE WILL BE IN 
THIS PROCESS AND WHAT IS HIS 

05:38:34.825 --> 05:38:37.659
ROLE BUT WHAT IS HIS ROLE LAID 
OUT TO BE AND WHAT DO WE EXPECT 

05:38:37.874 --> 05:38:39.692
FROM HIM? 
&gt;&gt; AS LAID OUT, IT IS EXTREMELY 

05:38:39.693 --> 05:38:41.926
VAGUE AND ESSENTIALLY THE PEOPLE
ARE LOOKING THAT NORMALLY THE 

05:38:42.140 --> 05:38:45.201
SENATE IS PROVIDED BY THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. IT IS NOT ALWAYS 

05:38:45.402 --> 05:38:49.869
THERE BUT HE HAS THE POWER TO 
CAST TIE-BREAKING VOTES. THE 

05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:52.853
CONSTITUTION SAYS IN THE EVENT 
OF THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF THE 

05:38:53.023 --> 05:38:56.367
PRESIDENT, IT IS THE CHIEF 
JUSTICE THAT HOLDS THAT ROLE 

05:38:56.567 --> 05:38:58.567
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE VICE 
PRESIDENT WOULD BECOME PRESIDENT

05:38:59.416 --> 05:39:03.680
IF THE PRESIDENT WERE REMOVED 
FROM OFFICE BUT BEYOND THAT AND 

05:39:03.879 --> 05:39:06.729
SAY A WHOLE LOT. I SPOKE WITH 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR

05:39:06.931 --> 05:39:10.796
BUT EXPRESSED THAT THERE IS AND 
THEY IS ABOUT THIS AND IN THE 

05:39:10.996 --> 05:39:14.244
PAST IMPEACHMENT TRIALS THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN OF ANDREW JOHNSON AND 

05:39:14.447 --> 05:39:20.131
BILL CLINTON, THE TWO CHIEF 
JUSTICES HAD DIFFERENT TASKS SO 

05:39:20.357 --> 05:39:23.583
THEY WERE VERY INVOLVED AND HE 
WOULD CAST HYBRID VOTES IN THE 

05:39:23.797 --> 05:39:28.051
SAME WAY THAT A VICE PRESIDENT 
WOULD ON ISSUES OF THE 

05:39:28.268 --> 05:39:31.514
METHODOLOGY OF HOW THINGS ARE 
PROGRESSING AND WILLIAM RANKE 

05:39:31.715 --> 05:39:37.400
WAS MUCH MORE HANDS-OFF. THE 
EXPERTS NOTED THAT ROBERTS WAS 

05:39:38.164 --> 05:39:42.882
CONSERVATIVE AND HELD TO THE 
CONSERVATIVE VALUE OF THE 

05:39:43.084 --> 05:39:47.151
PRESIDENT BEING A POWERFUL 
INSTITUTION AND THAT HE DOESN'T 

05:39:47.356 --> 05:39:53.046
WANT THE SUPREME COURT TO LOOK 
PARTISAN SO AS SUCH HE PROBABLY 

05:39:53.247 --> 05:39:55.247
WOULD OPT FOR A MUCH MORE 
HANDS-OFF DEMONSTRATION OF HIS 

05:39:55.279 --> 05:39:57.514
ROLE AS PART OF THIS TRIAL BUT 
HE HAS LITTLE BIT MORE 

05:39:57.715 --> 05:40:00.349
FLEXIBILITY AND POWER THAT HE 
COULD EXERCISE IF YOU CHOSE TO 

05:40:00.564 --> 05:40:05.029
DO SO. 
&gt;&gt;  THANK YOU SO MUCH. TRUMPS 

05:40:05.229 --> 05:40:09.631
LEGAL TEAM WILL BEGIN THE TRIAL 
DEFENSE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

05:40:09.807 --> 05:40:16.396
ANALYSIS AND YOUR ADDITIVES AND 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 

05:40:16.811 --> 05:40:19.605
NATALIE, THIS IDEA OF A CHUMP 
DEFENSE, WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO 

05:40:19.777 --> 05:40:22.091
YOU? 
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OVER THE 

05:40:22.292 --> 05:40:24.324
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT 
PEOPLE  GOING ON TO DEFEND 

05:40:24.726 --> 05:40:28.189
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHETHER IN A 
CONGRESSIONAL SETTING OR ON 

05:40:28.392 --> 05:40:30.623
TABLE NEWS OR IF THERE'S AN 
AUDIENCE OF ONE THAT THEY ARE'S 

05:40:31.225 --> 05:40:33.458
IN TWO. OBVIOUSLY, THE LEGAL 
TEAM IS TRYING TO MAKE THAT 

05:40:33.673 --> 05:40:37.256
POINT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT 
THERE IS ALSO ONE IMPORTANT 

05:40:37.442 --> 05:40:39.442
PERSON

05:40:40.976 --> 05:40:43.408
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SHOW 
THAT THEY WILL BAT FOR AND THAT 

05:40:43.622 --> 05:40:46.379
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
OPINION OF HOW HIS TEAM IS DOING

05:40:46.872 --> 05:40:48.872
AND WHETHER THEY ARE 
REPRESENTING HIM IN A WAY THAT 

05:40:48.906 --> 05:40:52.918
HE WOULD LIKE WHICH TENDS TO BE 
AGGRESSIVELY NOT GIVING A LOT OF

05:40:53.085 --> 05:40:58.855
GROUND WITH SOMEONE THAT WANTS 
TO SHORE UP THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 

05:40:59.056 --> 05:41:05.958
ALREADY ON HIS SIDE. THAT IS THE
TOWN THAT WE WOULD CALL A CHUMP 

05:41:06.159 --> 05:41:10.025
DEFENSE. 
&gt;&gt;  WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS 

05:41:10.225 --> 05:41:13.019
THE SENATORS ARE IN THAT CHAMBER
WITHOUT THEIR DEVICES AND THEIR 

05:41:13.208 --> 05:41:17.901
AIDES AND IF THEY ARE DOING 
THEIR JOB, THEY ARE ACTIVELY 

05:41:18.068 --> 05:41:24.240
LISTENING. I WONDER HOW THIS 
DEFENSE IS PLAYING WITH THEM. IF

05:41:24.453 --> 05:41:26.668
YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE 
PRESIDENT WALKING IN

05:41:29.938 --> 05:41:32.572
, IT MIGHT REALLY HAVE THE NOTES
THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR BUT IF 

05:41:32.772 --> 05:41:35.504
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE UP YOUR 
MIND ABOUT WHETHER THE DEFENSE 

05:41:36.378 --> 05:41:38.378
IS ENOUGH

05:41:40.486 --> 05:41:43.082
TO EXONERATE HIM OR SAY HE 
SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED FROM 

05:41:43.264 --> 05:41:46.307
OFFICE, I WANT TO HOW SOME OF 
THESE ARGUMENTS ARE HITTING AND 

05:41:46.477 --> 05:41:50.583
IF SENATORS WILL BE ABLE TO 
WEIGH THEM AND WILL THEY HAVE 

05:41:50.757 --> 05:41:52.757
CONCERNS?

05:41:55.316 --> 05:41:57.550
SOME OF THE BASIC IDEAS OF THE 
DEFENSE IS PUTTING FORTH ARE 

05:41:57.765 --> 05:42:00.145
FACTUALLY INCORRECT. 
&gt;&gt;  IT IS SUCH AN INTERESTING 

05:42:00.312 --> 05:42:04.350
QUESTION AND OF COURSE WE 
HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO GET THE 

05:42:04.523 --> 05:42:08.150
FULL DOWNLOAD FROM THOSE THAT 
ARE IN THE CHAMBER BUT IN THIS 

05:42:08.324 --> 05:42:12.309
IS TO VOMIT WITH WHICH MEMBERS 
IN THE SENATE BECOME JURORS

05:42:16.045 --> 05:42:18.278
AND SITTING ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
BENEATH THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE

05:42:18.479 --> 05:42:21.927
U. S. SUPREME COURT. IT IS A 
HISTORIC MOMENT AND WEIGHED WITH

05:42:22.141 --> 05:42:28.225
HISTORY AND TRADITION. WE SAW 
THE CENTER AT THE OPENING OF 

05:42:28.991 --> 05:42:31.688
TODAY'S HEARING BEING SWORN IN 
AND WE ALL HEARD THAT OATH WITH 

05:42:32.454 --> 05:42:37.706
THE PROMISE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT 
AND INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT WITH 

05:42:37.899 --> 05:42:45.489
THE COURT OF THE CONSTITUTION SO
ONE WOULD SENSE THAT THE WEIGHT 

05:42:45.703 --> 05:42:48.339
OF HISTORY IS UPON THOSE MEMBERS
WHO ARE IN THE CHAMBER AND THERE

05:42:48.539 --> 05:42:50.539
ARE ALSO POLITICAL ACTORS SO

05:42:54.639 --> 05:42:56.869
THIS IS ALSO UPON THEM. I HAVE 
BEEN WATCHING FOR WHAT MEMBERS 

05:42:57.071 --> 05:42:59.719
OF THE SENATE WOULD SAY THAT AND
YOU MAY HAVE DISCUSSED THIS 

05:43:00.321 --> 05:43:03.771
ALREADY BUT THAT ROMNEY WAS A 
SENATOR FROM UTAH THAT WAS 

05:43:04.187 --> 05:43:11.703
INTERVIEWED BY CNN ONE HOUR OR 
TWO AGO. I THOUGHT THIS WAS HIS 

05:43:12.105 --> 05:43:16.370
CAREFULLY BALANCED SELF IN WHICH
HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE RULES 

05:43:17.131 --> 05:43:23.070
WERE REASONABLE AND THE 
COMPLAINTS WERE A BIT OVERDONE 

05:43:23.472 --> 05:43:26.522
SINCE RULES CHANGE A LITTLE BIT 
FROM IMPEACHMENT AND SORT OF 

05:43:26.722 --> 05:43:31.805
WAVED AWAY THIS ARGUMENT THAT 
THE PROMISE OF THESE WOULD BE 

05:43:32.421 --> 05:43:35.457
THE BILL QUIT IMPEACHMENT RULES 
ARE NOT PRECISELY SO BUT ON THE 

05:43:35.671 --> 05:43:39.724
OTHER HAND HE SAID HE REITERATED
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE 

05:43:39.925 --> 05:43:42.771
KNOWN BUT IT WAS INTERESTING FOR
ME TO HEAR IT FOR US TO HEAR IT 

05:43:42.971 --> 05:43:46.436
ON THE OPENING DAY THAT HE IS 
INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM 

05:43:46.637 --> 05:43:48.637
WITNESSES AND HE MENTIONED JOHN 
BOLTON IN PARTICULAR.

05:43:52.323 --> 05:43:54.755
YOU KNOW HE TOLD SEEN AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM. 

05:43:54.955 --> 05:43:59.223
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT,  THERE IS THE 
QUESTION OF HOW SENATORS COULD 

05:43:59.975 --> 05:44:03.490
BE SWAYED. THEY SWORE AN OATH OF
IMPARTIALITY BUT SO MANY OF THEM

05:44:04.241 --> 05:44:07.657
HAVE GONE WITH THEIR MINDS 
ALREADY MADE UP.

05:44:11.958 --> 05:44:13.958
&gt;&gt; 

05:44:16.701 --> 05:44:19.950
THAT IS THE KEY PART OF THAT 
POINT. WE SAW LAST WEEK WHEN 

05:44:20.149 --> 05:44:22.149
THERE WAS SO MUCH INFORMATION 
COMING OUT ABOUT

05:44:27.866 --> 05:44:29.866
AN ASSOCIATE OF GIULIANI THAT 
WAS UNDER INDICTMENT, WE LEARNED

05:44:29.898 --> 05:44:32.695
A TON OF NEW INFORMATION LAST 
WEEK AND THAT SEEMED TO CHANGE 

05:44:32.864 --> 05:44:34.864
THINGS.

05:44:36.398 --> 05:44:40.062
MAYBE NOT REMARKABLY BUT THAT IS
A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION AND YOU

05:44:40.263 --> 05:44:43.300
CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT COULD 
BECOME THE CASE. I THINK THAT IS

05:44:43.515 --> 05:44:45.948
PROBABLY A LOT OF THE REASON WHY
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD LIKE TO 

05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:50.818
HAVE THIS OVER IN JUST A COUPLE 
OF WEEKS BECAUSE THE MORE 

05:44:51.019 --> 05:44:54.066
INFORMATION THAT IS REACHING THE
SENATORS THAT ARE IN THE 

05:44:54.280 --> 05:44:58.534
DIFFICULT ELECTORAL POSITIONS 
AND CENTERS THAT WANT TO SEE THE

05:44:58.748 --> 05:45:04.431
TRUTH COME OUT, THE MORE TIME 
THAT GOES BY,  THEY RISK MORE 

05:45:04.632 --> 05:45:09.099
THINGS LIKE THAT COMING OUT. 
&gt;&gt;  MY CULTURE HAS SAID THE HE 

05:45:09.312 --> 05:45:13.165
IS PIVOTING HIS ADS TOWARDS 
PRO-IMPEACHMENT AND THOSE WILL 

05:45:13.928 --> 05:45:18.393
BE AIRING IN THE BATTLEGROUND 
STATES. LET'S GET TO OUR 

05:45:18.559 --> 05:45:20.559
COLLEAGUE,

05:45:23.315 --> 05:45:25.564
RHONDA COLEMAN. I WOULD LIKE TO 
HEAR FROM YOU ON THIS RESOLUTION

05:45:25.763 --> 05:45:28.197
AND HOW MUCH McCONNELL HAD SET 
THINGS UP TODAY AND IN THE QUICK

05:45:28.398 --> 05:45:31.192
PIVOT WE SAW AS A TRIAL 
PROCEDURE GOT UNDERWAY THIS 

05:45:31.365 --> 05:45:35.713
AFTERNOON. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT. I DON'T THINK 

05:45:35.920 --> 05:45:37.946
IT SHOULD BE UNDER REPORT THAT  
MITCH McCONNELL, THE SENATE 

05:45:38.146 --> 05:45:40.795
MAJORITY LEADER DID CHANGE HIS 
MIND FROM THE ORIGINAL DRAFT 

05:45:40.994 --> 05:45:46.279
THAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT OF THE 
ORGANIZING RESOLUTION AND LAST 

05:45:46.479 --> 05:45:49.727
NIGHT AND EVEN THIS MORNING, WE 
RECORDED BECAUSE WE WERE HERE 

05:45:49.930 --> 05:45:55.367
FROM HIS OFFICE THAT THIS 
ORGANIZING RESOLUTION WOULD KEEP

05:45:55.536 --> 05:46:01.305
PASS RECORD THAT ALL THE 
TRANSCRIPTS AND THE EVIDENCE 

05:46:01.707 --> 05:46:03.741
THAT IT WOULD NOT BE 
AUTOMATICALLY ADDED INTO THE 

05:46:04.503 --> 05:46:08.006
SENATE TRIAL BUT LATER TODAY 
AROUND LUNCHTIME AND IN FACT 

05:46:08.422 --> 05:46:10.422
RIGHT AFTER THE SENATE LOOKING

05:46:13.492 --> 05:46:15.492
CAUCUS MET FOR LUNCH, MITCH 
McCONNELL'S OFFICE DID SAY HE 

05:46:15.524 --> 05:46:17.756
MADE CHANGES TO THE RESOLUTION 
AND THEY REFLECT THAT NOW THE 

05:46:17.955 --> 05:46:21.822
HOUSE RECORD WILL BE ON MANIC 
ADDED TO THE SENATE TRIAL AND IF

05:46:22.030 --> 05:46:26.087
WE CAN BRING UP THE RESOLUTION 
AND WHAT IT APPEARS, VIEWERS AT 

05:46:26.286 --> 05:46:31.102
HOME MAY NOT KNOW THAT THIS 
OFTEN IS NOT AS A FORMAL PROCESS

05:46:47.215 --> 05:46:51.066
AND SUBJECT TO ANY OBJECTIONS, 
THAT IS GIVING THE REPUBLICANS A

05:46:51.820 --> 05:46:56.764
WAY OUT THAT THE REPUBLICANS 
WILL BE ABLE TO OBJECT TO HAVING

05:46:56.964 --> 05:47:00.828
THAT HOUSE RECORD OBJECTED. THAT
IS REALLY INTERESTING AND THE 

05:47:01.028 --> 05:47:06.313
OTHER POINT THAT HE CHANGED IS 
THE ROLE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE 

05:47:06.513 --> 05:47:09.348
SENATE TO HAVE THESE OPENING 
ARGUMENTS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO

05:47:09.562 --> 05:47:15.046
DAYS ABOUT IS HOW IT WAS 
ORIGINALLY AND THEN HE CHANGED 

05:47:15.246 --> 05:47:17.220
IT OVER THE COURSE OF THREE 
DAYS. 

05:47:17.221 --> 05:47:22.347
&gt;&gt;  THANKS SO MUCH. LET'S HEAD 
BACK TO THE SENATE FLOOR. 

05:47:22.348 --> 05:47:24.348
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT CHARGES THE 

05:47:24.541 --> 05:47:27.832
PRESIDENT  WAS USING THE POWER 
OF HIS OFFICE TO SOLICIT AND 

05:47:28.248 --> 05:47:32.301
PRESSURE UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT EVERYONE IN 

05:47:33.055 --> 05:47:39.617
THIS CHAMBER KNOWS TO BE BOGUS. 
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T EVEN CARE 

05:47:39.817 --> 05:47:45.717
IF AN INVESTIGATION WAS ACTUALLY
CONDUCTED. JUST THAT IT WAS 

05:47:46.476 --> 05:47:51.347
ANNOUNCED. WHY? BECAUSE THIS WAS
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL AND 

05:47:51.581 --> 05:47:56.881
POLITICAL BENEFIT. THE FIRST 
ARTICLE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

05:47:57.645 --> 05:48:03.180
DID SO WITH CORRUPT MOTIVES AND 
THAT HIS USE OF POWER FOR 

05:48:03.941 --> 05:48:08.263
PERSONAL GAIN HARMED THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED 

05:48:09.027 --> 05:48:12.944
STATES. AS THE SECOND ARTICLE OF
IMPEACHMENT CHARGES, THE 

05:48:13.694 --> 05:48:18.774
PRESIDENT SOUGHT TO CONCEAL 
EVIDENCE OF THIS CONDUCT. HE DID

05:48:18.953 --> 05:48:27.147
SO BY ORDERING HIS ENTIRE 
ADMINISTRATION AND EVERY OFFICE 

05:48:27.562 --> 05:48:34.261
AND AGENCY AND EVERY OFFICIAL TO
DEFY EVERY SUBPOENA. THIRD IN 

05:48:34.462 --> 05:48:40.558
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT. NO 
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY HAS EVER 

05:48:40.759 --> 05:48:42.759
DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

05:48:46.040 --> 05:48:49.091
MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE EXPRESSLY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY COULDN'T 

05:48:49.292 --> 05:48:54.518
DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS. PRESIDENT
TRUMP DID NOT TAKE THESE EXTREME

05:48:54.691 --> 05:49:01.018
STEPS TO HIDE EVIDENCE OF HIS 
INNOCENCE. OR TO PROTECT THE 

05:49:01.181 --> 05:49:05.739
INSTITUTION OF THE PRESIDENCY AS
A CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT 

05:49:05.940 --> 05:49:12.239
OFFICER, I HAVE NEVER SEEN 
ANYONE TAKE SUCH EXTREME STEPS 

05:49:12.653 --> 05:49:21.590
TO HIDE EVIDENCE ALLEGEDLY 
PROVING HIS INNOCENCE. I DO NOT 

05:49:21.790 --> 05:49:27.428
FIND THAT HERE TODAY. THE 
PRESIDENT IS ENGAGED IN THIS 

05:49:27.610 --> 05:49:34.990
COVER-UP BECAUSE HE IS GUILTY 
AND HE KNOWS IT. HE KNOWS THAT 

05:49:35.191 --> 05:49:39.455
THE EVIDENCE HE IS CONCEALING 
WILL ONLY FURTHER DEMONSTRATE 

05:49:39.873 --> 05:49:45.956
THAT. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS 
EFFORT TO STONEWALL THE HOUSE 

05:49:46.929 --> 05:49:48.929
AND MESSED

05:49:50.838 --> 05:49:53.208
EVIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENTS HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. 17 

05:49:53.386 --> 05:49:58.356
WITNESSES AND 130 HOURS OF 
TESTIMONY COMBINED WITH THE 

05:49:58.557 --> 05:50:02.620
PRESIDENT ON A MISSION ON PHONE 
CALLS AND PUBLIC COMMENTS 

05:50:03.223 --> 05:50:08.920
CONFIRMED AN COOPERATED BY 
HUNDREDS OF EMAILS AND 

05:50:09.880 --> 05:50:15.204
DOCUMENTS. MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE 
CAME FROM PATRIOTIC NONPARTISAN 

05:50:16.183 --> 05:50:22.721
DECORATED OFFICIALS IN THE STATE
DEPARTMENT. THEY ARE BRAVE MEN 

05:50:22.935 --> 05:50:25.445
AND WOMEN THAT HONOR THEIR 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LAWS AND 

05:50:25.613 --> 05:50:30.447
GAVE TESTIMONY REQUIRED BY 
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA IN THE 

05:50:30.649 --> 05:50:38.530
FACE OF THE PRESIDENT. THESE 
OFFICIALS DESCRIBE THE PRESENCE 

05:50:38.773 --> 05:50:44.410
CAMPAIGN TO INDUCE THE PRESSURE 
TO ANNOUNCE POLITICAL 

05:50:44.586 --> 05:50:50.962
INVESTIGATIONS AND ISSUES OF 391
MILLION DOLLARS OF VITAL 

05:50:51.722 --> 05:50:55.829
MILITARY AID. TAXPAYER MONEY 
APPROPRIATED ON A BIPARTISAN 

05:50:56.044 --> 05:51:03.300
BASIS BY CONGRESS AS LEVERAGE TO
FORGE UKRAINE TO COMPLY AND IS 

05:51:03.471 --> 05:51:08.024
WITHHOLDING OF A MEETING 
DESPERATELY SOUGHT BY THE NEWLY 

05:51:08.784 --> 05:51:13.050
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. 
THIS TESTIMONY WAS PARTICULARLY 

05:51:13.223 --> 05:51:17.877
COMPELLING BECAUSE THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT IS AT THE VERY CENTER

05:51:19.191 --> 05:51:25.690
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WRONGDOING.
WE HEARD FIRST-HAND FROM 

05:51:26.104 --> 05:51:30.973
DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS THAT SAW UP
CLOSE AND PERSONNEL PERSONALLY 

05:51:31.172 --> 05:51:38.287
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHO 
IMMEDIATELY SOUNDED THE ALARM. 

05:51:38.488 --> 05:51:42.565
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM TAYLOR WHO 
RETURNED TO UKRAINE IN JUNE OF 

05:51:43.168 --> 05:51:48.653
LAST YEAR AS ACTING IMPASSE AT 
HER TEXT AT OTHER STATE 

05:51:49.408 --> 05:51:54.286
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS. I THINK IT
IS CRAZY TO WITHHOLD SECURITY 

05:51:54.460 --> 05:52:00.376
ASSISTANCE FOR HELP WITH A 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. THE 

05:52:00.541 --> 05:52:03.382
AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, GORDON

05:52:07.135 --> 05:52:09.167
SONDLAND WHO WAS DELEGATED 
AUTHORITY OVER UKRAINE MANNERS  

05:52:09.367 --> 05:52:13.830
BY NONE OTHER THAN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TESTIFIED THAT WE KNEW 

05:52:14.044 --> 05:52:18.459
THESE INVESTIGATIONS WERE 
IMPORTANT TO THE PRESIDENT. WE 

05:52:18.621 --> 05:52:22.492
FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT'S ORDERS.

05:52:26.226 --> 05:52:30.492
DAVID HOLMES, A SENIOR OFFICIAL 
AT THE U. S. EMBASSY SAID IT WAS

05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:36.740
MADE CLEAR THAT SOME ACTION ON 
ABIDING INVESTIGATION WAS A 

05:52:36.920 --> 05:52:43.902
CONDITIONED FOR AN OVAL OFFICE 
MEETING. DURING THEIR TESTIMONY,

05:52:44.104 --> 05:52:48.369
MANY OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
OFFICIALS DESCRIBED SPECIFIC 

05:52:48.770 --> 05:52:52.221
DOCUMENTS INCLUDING TEXT 
MESSAGES AND EMAILS WITH FORMER 

05:52:52.975 --> 05:52:54.975
DIPLOMATIC TABLES

05:52:58.119 --> 05:53:00.119
THAT WOULD COOPERATE THEIR 
TESTIMONY AND SHED ADDITIONAL 

05:53:00.269 --> 05:53:02.269
LIGHT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

05:53:07.255 --> 05:53:09.085
CORRUPTING. FOR INSTANCE, 
INVESTOR TAYLOR THAT RAISE 

05:53:09.086 --> 05:53:13.151
CONCERNS THAT MILITARY AID HAD 
BEEN CONDITIONED ON THE PRESENCE

05:53:13.351 --> 05:53:15.989
DEMAND FOR POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED A 

05:53:16.190 --> 05:53:21.671
NOTEBOOK IN WHICH HE WOULD TAKE 
NOTES ON CONVERSATIONS HE HAD 

05:53:22.087 --> 05:53:28.946
WITH KEY OFFICIALS. AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND REFERRED  TO EMAILS 

05:53:29.179 --> 05:53:33.812
REGARDING THE PRESENCE DEMAND 
THAT UKRAINE ANNOUNCE POLITICAL 

05:53:33.983 --> 05:53:39.349
INVESTIGATIONS. AS WE WILL SEE 
THROUGH EMAILS THAT WERE SENT TO

05:53:39.585 --> 05:53:44.230
SOME OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ADVISORS INCLUDING ACTING WHITE 

05:53:44.430 --> 05:53:48.696
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, NICK 
MOBILITY AND SEDENTARY OF STATE 

05:53:49.456 --> 05:53:56.411
MICHAEL POMPEO AND SECRETARY OF 
ENERGY, RICK PERRY. THE DEPUTY 

05:53:56.613 --> 05:53:59.002
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE 
GEORGE KENT WHO OVERSAW UKRAINE 

05:53:59.183 --> 05:54:04.061
POLICY MANNERS IN WASHINGTON FOR
THE STATE DEPARTMENT WROTE AT 

05:54:04.234 --> 05:54:11.641
LEAST FOUR MEMOS TO DOCUMENT 
CONCERNING CONDUCT HE WITNESSED 

05:54:12.616 --> 05:54:14.616
OR HEARD.

05:54:18.553 --> 05:54:19.969
AMBASSADOR VOELKER, THE SPECIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE 

05:54:19.970 --> 05:54:24.438
NEGOTIATIONS PROVIDED EVIDENCE 
THAT HE AND OTHER AMERICAN 

05:54:25.202 --> 05:54:28.438
OFFICIALS COMMUNICATED WITH 
HIGH-LEVEL UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS 

05:54:28.605 --> 05:54:34.148
INCLUDING PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKY HIMSELF.  VIA TEXT 

05:54:34.318 --> 05:54:38.773
MESSAGE AND WHAT'S UP ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENTS

05:54:42.933 --> 05:54:45.568
IMPROPER DEMAND OF HOW UKRAINIAN
OFFICIALS WOULD RESPOND TO THEM 

05:54:45.769 --> 05:54:50.236
BASED ON THE TESTIMONY WE 
RECEIVED AN ON EVIDENCE THAT HAS

05:54:50.988 --> 05:54:55.742
SINCE EMERGED WITH ALL OF THESE 
DOCUMENTS AND OTHERS THAT WE 

05:54:56.470 --> 05:55:00.400
WILL DESCRIBE. THEY ARE DIRECTLY
ON THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH IN 

05:55:00.603 --> 05:55:05.682
THE FIRST ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THEY WOULD HELP 

05:55:05.883 --> 05:55:10.095
COMPLETE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
HOW THE PRESIDENTS SCHEME 

05:55:10.263 --> 05:55:16.031
UNFOLDED IN REAL TIME. THEY 
WOULD SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION 

05:55:16.446 --> 05:55:19.895
THAT THE SENIOR UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS UNDERSTOOD THE CORRUPT

05:55:20.095 --> 05:55:23.081
NATURE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
DEMANDS AND THEY WOULD FURTHER 

05:55:23.266 --> 05:55:26.595
EXPOSE THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
SECRETARY POMPEO AND THE ACTING 

05:55:26.809 --> 05:55:31.673
CHIEF OF STAFF NICK MULVANEY AND
OTHER SENIOR TRUMP DEMONSTRATION

05:55:31.875 --> 05:55:36.676
OFFICIALS WERE AWARE OF THE 
PRESIDENTS PLOT AND HELPED CARRY

05:55:38.723 --> 05:55:44.471
IT OUT. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
A BURDEN OR A NUMBER OF 

05:55:44.671 --> 05:55:48.335
DOCUMENTS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
A SPECIFIC DISCRETE SET OF 

05:55:48.535 --> 05:55:51.533
MATERIALS HELD BY THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. DOCUMENTS THE STATE 

05:55:51.703 --> 05:55:57.883
DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY COLLECTED
IN RESPONSE TO OUR SUBPOENA BUT 

05:55:58.083 --> 05:56:03.367
HAVE NEVER PRODUCED. WE KNOW 
THESE MATERIALS EXIST. WE KNOW 

05:56:03.567 --> 05:56:07.768
THEY ARE RELEVANT AND WE KNOW 
THE PRESIDENT IS DESPERATELY 

05:56:07.947 --> 05:56:14.249
TRYING TO CONCEAL THEM. AS I 
WILL DESCRIBE, THE SENATE SHOULD

05:56:14.736 --> 05:56:16.736
SUBPOENA THE FOLLOWING. NUMBER 
ONE,

05:56:20.584 --> 05:56:22.584
WHAT'S APP

05:56:27.743 --> 05:56:29.743
AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND 
THEN EMAILS AND NOTES. GIVEN THE

05:56:29.775 --> 05:56:31.393
SYNDICATES AND RELEVANCE OF 
THESE DOCUMENTS, THE HOUSE 

05:56:31.394 --> 05:56:33.753
REQUESTED THAT THEY BE PROVIDED.
WHEN THESE REQUESTS WERE DENIED

05:56:37.692 --> 05:56:39.725
, WHEN OUR REQUEST WAS DENIED, 
THE HOUSE ISSUED SUBPOENAS 

05:56:39.925 --> 05:56:42.685
COMMANDING THAT THE DOCUMENTS BE
TURNED OVER.

05:56:46.426 --> 05:56:50.893
AT THE PRESIDENTS DIRECTION, THE
DEPARTMENT OF STATE UNLAWFULLY 

05:56:51.095 --> 05:56:58.008
DEFINED THAT SUBPOENA AND I 
STAND HERE NOW AS I STAND HERE 

05:56:58.208 --> 05:57:01.658
NOW, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS 
ALL THESE DOCUMENTS IN ITS 

05:57:01.860 --> 05:57:07.892
POSSESSION BUT REFUSES BASED ON 
THE PRESIDENTS ORDER TO LET THEM

05:57:08.067 --> 05:57:15.885
SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. THIS IS A 
FRONT TO THE HOUSE WHICH HAS 

05:57:16.646 --> 05:57:20.499
FULL POWER TO SEE THESE 
DOCUMENTS. IT IS A FRONT TO THE 

05:57:20.671 --> 05:57:27.666
SENATE WHICH HAS BEEN DENIED A 
FULL RECORD ON WHICH TO JUDGE 

05:57:28.066 --> 05:57:30.066
THE PRESIDENTS GUILT OR 
INNOCENCE AND IT IS AN AFFRONT 

05:57:30.099 --> 05:57:36.344
TO THE CONSTITUTION WHICH MAKES 
CLEAR THAT NOBODY, NOT EVEN THE 

05:57:36.517 --> 05:57:45.891
PRESIDENT IS ABOVE THE LAW. IT 
IS AN AFFRONT TO THE AMERICAN 

05:57:46.058 --> 05:57:51.430
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 

05:57:51.630 --> 05:57:59.145
ALLIES ARE HIDING FROM THEM. WHY
IT IS BEING HIDDEN. PRIOR 

05:57:59.343 --> 05:58:02.394
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS, THE BODY HAS
ISSUED SUBPOENAS REQUIRING THE 

05:58:02.593 --> 05:58:06.395
RECIPIENT TO HANDOVER RELEVANT 
DOCUMENTS. IT MUST DO SO AGAIN 

05:58:06.567 --> 05:58:13.318
HERE. IT MUST DO SO NOW AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL, NOT THE 

05:58:13.554 --> 05:58:15.554
END.

05:58:17.838 --> 05:58:21.490
OF COURSE, THE NEED FOR US AND 
THAT SUBPOENA ARISES BECAUSE AS 

05:58:21.691 --> 05:58:24.739
I HAVE NOTED, THE PRISON ORDERED
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO DEFY A 

05:58:24.940 --> 05:58:30.635
SUBPOENA FROM THE HOUSE. AT THIS
POINT I WOULD LIKE TO DESCRIBE 

05:58:30.835 --> 05:58:35.703
THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO GET THOSE 
MATERIALS AND I WILL ADDRESS IN 

05:58:35.904 --> 05:58:37.736
A MORE DETAILED FASHION EXACTLY 
WHAT DOCUMENTS THE STATE 

05:58:37.737 --> 05:58:40.389
DEPARTMENT HAS HIDDEN FROM THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WHY THE 

05:58:41.149 --> 05:58:45.866
SENATE SHOULD REQUIRE THEM TO 
TURN IT OVER. ONSET OVERNIGHT, 

05:58:46.268 --> 05:58:50.535
THERE WAS ARTICLE 1 WITH THE 
HOUSE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE 

05:58:50.937 --> 05:58:58.450
SEEING A DOCUMENT REQUEST TO THE
STATE DEPARTMENT. THE COMMITTEE 

05:58:58.867 --> 05:59:00.867
SOUGHT WRITTEN MATERIALS RELATED
TO THE PRESENCE EFFORT TO 

05:59:01.236 --> 05:59:03.236
PRESSURE UKRAINE TO ANNOUNCE 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIS 

05:59:03.733 --> 05:59:08.750
POLITICAL RIVAL AS WELL AS HIS 
DANGER TO AND EXPLAIN 

05:59:08.930 --> 05:59:11.190
WITHHOLDING OF MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN VITAL

05:59:15.314 --> 05:59:17.344
MILITARY AID. AFTER THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY

05:59:17.557 --> 05:59:19.735
DOCUMENTS, THE HOUSE COMMITTEE 
ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS ISSUED A 

05:59:19.921 --> 05:59:22.963
SUBPOENA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT
ON SEPTEMBER 27

05:59:28.311 --> 05:59:30.311
IN A LETTER ON OCTOBER 1, 
SECRETARY POMPEO ACKNOWLEDGED A 

05:59:30.343 --> 05:59:32.791
RECEIPT OF THE SUBPOENA. AT THAT
TIME, HE STATED HE WOULD RESPOND

05:59:32.994 --> 05:59:37.258
TO THE COMMITTEE SUBPOENA FOR 
DOCUMENTS BY THE RETURN DATE OF 

05:59:38.019 --> 05:59:44.974
OCTOBER 4. HIS RESPONSE NEVER 
CAME. INSTEAD, ON OCTOBER 8, 

05:59:45.173 --> 05:59:49.364
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYER WRITING
ON THE PRESENCE THE HALF ISSUED 

05:59:49.641 --> 05:59:53.019
A DIRECTION SAYING THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD STONEWALL.

05:59:57.155 --> 05:59:58.984
THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND 
TODAY THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS 

05:59:58.985 --> 06:00:04.012
NOT PRODUCED A SINGLE DOCUMENT. 
NOT A SINGLE DOCUMENT IN 

06:00:04.697 --> 06:00:11.169
RESPONSE TO THE CONGRESSIONAL 
SUBPOENA. WITNESSES HAVE 

06:00:11.586 --> 06:00:13.894
TESTIFIED AND INDICATED THAT THE
STATE DEPARTMENT HAD GATHERED 

06:00:14.218 --> 06:00:19.939
ALL OF THE RECORDS AND WAS 
PREPARED TO PROVIDE THEM BEFORE 

06:00:20.116 --> 06:00:26.614
THE WHITE HOUSE DIRECTED IT TO 
DEFY THE SUBPOENA. 

06:00:27.017 --> 06:00:30.465
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS UNLAWFUL 
OBSTRUCTION WITH THE TESTIMONY 

06:00:30.883 --> 06:00:34.733
OF THE BRAVE STATE DEPARTMENT 
EMPLOYEES, THE HOUSE WAS ABLE TO

06:00:35.487 --> 06:00:39.358
IDENTIFY WITH REMARKABLE 
PRECISION SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF 

06:00:39.538 --> 06:00:43.469
DOCUMENTS RELEVANT TO THE FIRST 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT THAT IS 

06:00:43.669 --> 06:00:49.768
SEEN RIGHT NOW. THESE DOCUMENTS 
ARE SITTING RIGHT NOW AT THE 

06:00:50.530 --> 06:00:54.435
STATE DEPARTMENT. I WOULD LIKE 
TO WALK YOU THROUGH FOUR KEY 

06:00:54.648 --> 06:00:56.828
CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS THAT 
SHOULD BE SUBPOENAED AND WHICH 

06:00:57.007 --> 06:00:59.920
ILLUSTRATE THE HIGHLY RELEVANT 
DOCUMENTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

06:01:00.671 --> 06:01:07.234
COULD PRODUCE. THEY COULD 
PRODUCE THEM IMMEDIATELY FOR 

06:01:07.996 --> 06:01:15.216
THIS TRIAL. THE FIRST CATEGORY 
CONSISTS OF TEXT MESSAGES AND 

06:01:15.968 --> 06:01:17.968
WHAT'S APP

06:01:21.660 --> 06:01:23.291
CAUGHT UP IN THESE EVENTS 
INCLUDING AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

06:01:23.292 --> 06:01:25.513
AND TAYLOR AND ALSO THE DEPUTY 
ASSISTANT  TO TERRY GEORGE KENT.

06:01:25.726 --> 06:01:28.361
ALL THREE OF WHOM CONFIRMED 
THEIR TESTIMONY THAT THEY 

06:01:29.124 --> 06:01:31.124
REGULARLY USE

06:01:34.258 --> 06:01:38.924
WHAT'S APP TO COMMUNICATE.  THE 
SECRETARY CAN EXPLAIN THAT 

06:01:39.325 --> 06:01:41.774
WHAT'S APP IS A DOMINANT FORM OF
ELECTRONIC INDICATION  IN 

06:01:41.976 --> 06:01:45.224
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD. WE 
KNOW THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS 

06:01:45.427 --> 06:01:49.826
THE RECORDS OF WHAT'S APP AND 
TEXT MESSAGES  FROM CRITICAL 

06:01:49.992 --> 06:01:53.691
EYEWITNESSES TO THESE 
PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING FROM 

06:01:53.858 --> 06:01:58.980
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND ANN TAYLOR 
AND DEPUTY ASSISTANT  TO TERRY 

06:01:59.146 --> 06:02:04.276
KENT. WE KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS 
DELIBERATELY CONCEALING THESE 

06:02:04.450 --> 06:02:10.769
REC'S AT THE DIRECTION OF THE 
PRESIDENT AND WE KNOW THEY CAN 

06:02:10.942 --> 06:02:15.029
CONTAIN HIGHLY RELEVANT 
TESTIMONY ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS 

06:02:15.195 --> 06:02:22.186
PLAN TO CONDITION OFFICIAL 
PRESIDENTIAL ACTS ON THE 

06:02:22.387 --> 06:02:25.849
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF INVESTIGATIONS 
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL AND 

06:02:26.603 --> 06:02:31.084
POLITICAL GAIN. WE KNOW THIS NOT
ONLY FROM TESTIMONY BUT ALSO 

06:02:31.251 --> 06:02:37.218
BECAUSE THE AMBASSADOR WAS ABLE 
TO PROVIDE US WITH A SMALL BUT 

06:02:37.834 --> 06:02:42.047
TELLING SELECTION OF HIS WHAT'S 
APP MESSAGES.  THOSE RECORDS 

06:02:42.218 --> 06:02:44.218
CONFIRM WITH A FULL REVIEW

06:02:47.984 --> 06:02:50.017
OF THESE MESSAGES FROM RELEVANT 
OFFICIALS AND THIS WOULD HELP TO

06:02:50.217 --> 06:02:52.355
PAINT A VIVID FIRST-HAND PICTURE

06:02:55.903 --> 06:02:58.953
OF STATEMENTS AND DECISIONS AND 
CONCERNS AND BELIEFS HELD BY 

06:02:59.154 --> 06:03:03.835
IMPORTANT PLAYERS OF EVENTS 
UNFOLDING IN REAL TIME. FOR 

06:03:04.034 --> 06:03:09.197
EXAMPLE, THINGS TO AMBASSADOR 
BROKERS MESSAGES, WE KNOW THAT 

06:03:09.519 --> 06:03:12.767
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND, A KEEP  
PLAYER IN THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN 

06:03:13.169 --> 06:03:17.396
THAT TESTIFIED IN THE HOUSE 
ABOUT EIGHT QUID PRO QUO 

06:03:17.571 --> 06:03:23.134
ARRANGEMENT WENT DIRECTLY WITH 
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT, 

06:03:23.534 --> 06:03:26.097
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY.  THIS IMAGE 
PRODUCED BY

06:03:29.832 --> 06:03:31.865
AMBASSADOR VOLKER APPEARS TO BE 
A SCREENSHOT OF A TEXT MESSAGE 

06:03:32.266 --> 06:03:34.700
THAT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 
EXCHANGE WITH  PRESIDENT 

06:03:34.915 --> 06:03:37.549
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY ABOUT PLANS 
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE  VISIT THE 

06:03:37.751 --> 06:03:40.950
VERY SAME VISIT THAT PRESIDENT 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY BADLY NEEDED 

06:03:42.422 --> 06:03:45.269
AND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP LATER 
WITHHELD AS PART OF THE QUID PRO

06:03:45.885 --> 06:03:51.930
QUO DESCRIBED BY AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND IN HIS TESTIMONY.  THIS

06:03:52.104 --> 06:03:56.849
BODY AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT ELSE 

06:03:57.049 --> 06:04:01.115
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND  
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY SET

06:04:01.717 --> 06:04:05.167
ANOTHER  REALM AND EXCHANGES 
ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING OR

06:04:05.383 --> 06:04:09.134
ABOUT MILITARY AID AND THE 
PRESIDENTS DEMAND.

06:04:13.499 --> 06:04:15.732
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS 
CONVEYED AND WHEN. WE DON'T KNOW

06:04:15.946 --> 06:04:17.946
PRESIDENT TRUMP JERKED INTO THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT TO CONCEAL 

06:04:18.529 --> 06:04:22.649
THESE RECORDS. THESE ARE RECORDS
OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT WOULD 

06:04:22.849 --> 06:04:26.500
HAVE OTHERWISE TURNED OVER IF 
NOT FOR THE PRESIDENTS DIRECTION

06:04:26.702 --> 06:04:30.706
AND DESIRE TO COVER UP HIS 
WRONGDOING. TO GET A SENSE OF 

06:04:30.880 --> 06:04:32.880
WHY

06:04:37.267 --> 06:04:39.098
WHAT'S APP MESSAGES ARE SO 
VITAL, JUST CONSIDER WHETHER 

06:04:39.099 --> 06:04:44.324
ANOTHER PIECE OF EVIDENCE  WOULD
BE CLAIMED FROM THE PARTIAL 

06:04:44.491 --> 06:04:49.607
PROTECTION. ON JULY 10 AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING AT WHICH 

06:04:49.779 --> 06:04:57.529
AMBASSADOR LIBBY CASEY  SONDLAND
QUESTIONED OFFICIALS

06:05:00.417 --> 06:05:05.703
AND THEY SAID I FEEL THAT THE 
KEY FOR MANY THINGS IS RUDY AND 

06:05:06.453 --> 06:05:11.061
I'M READY TO TALK WITH HIM AT 
ANY TIME. THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT 

06:05:11.937 --> 06:05:16.066
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AMBASSADOR
SONDLAND'S ULTIMATUM  THAT 

06:05:16.267 --> 06:05:19.875
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS RECOGNIZED 
THAT THEY NEED TO APPEASE RUDY 

06:05:20.057 --> 06:05:25.816
GIULIANI BY CARRYING OUT THE 
INVESTIGATION. OF COURSE, MR. 

06:05:26.016 --> 06:05:30.283
GIULIANI HAD PUBLICLY CONFIRMED 
THAT HE WAS NOT ENGAGED IN 

06:05:30.683 --> 06:05:34.348
FOREIGN POLICY BUT INSTEAD 
ADVANCING HIS CLIENT, THE 

06:05:35.110 --> 06:05:39.832
PRESIDENTS OWN PERSONAL 
INTERESTS. FURTHER, IN ANOTHER 

06:05:40.032 --> 06:05:43.281
TEXT MESSAGE EXCHANGE PROVIDED 
BY AMBASSADOR VOLKER, WE SEE 

06:05:44.047 --> 06:05:47.547
EVIDENCE THAT UKRAINE UNDERSTOOD
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEMANDS LOUD 

06:05:48.309 --> 06:05:55.273
AND CLEAR. ON THE MORNING OF 
JULY 25, AS AN HOUR BEFORE THE 

06:05:55.474 --> 06:05:58.725
INFAMOUS CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 

06:05:58.925 --> 06:06:02.574

WROTE TO A UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL 

06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:07.594
HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
ASSUMING THE PRESIDENT COMMENCES

06:06:07.762 --> 06:06:12.126
TRUMP HE WILL INVESTIGATE AND 
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT 

06:06:12.326 --> 06:06:17.973
HAPPENED IN 2016, WE WILL NAIL 
DOWN A DATE OR VISIT TO 

06:06:18.145 --> 06:06:26.341
WASHINGTON. GOOD LUCK AND SEE 
YOU TOMORROW. AMBASSADOR SALMON 

06:06:26.757 --> 06:06:29.795
CONFIRMS THAT THIS ACCURATELY 
SUMMARIZES THE PRESENT DIRECTIVE

06:06:30.544 --> 06:06:35.290
TO HIM EARLIER THIS MORNING. 
AFTER THE PHONE CALL BETWEEN 

06:06:36.054 --> 06:06:38.541
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, THE 

06:06:38.740 --> 06:06:45.027
UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL RESPONDED  
POINTEDLY. THE PHONE CALL WENT 

06:06:45.240 --> 06:06:48.892
WELL. HE THEN DISCUSSED 
POTENTIAL DATES FOR A WHITE 

06:06:49.653 --> 06:06:54.174
HOUSE MEETING AND IN THE VERY 
NEXT DAY, AMBASSADOR VOCAL OR 

06:06:54.575 --> 06:07:00.811
WROTE TO RUDY GIULIANI EXACTLY 
THE RIGHT MESSAGES AS WE 

06:07:00.987 --> 06:07:05.693
DISCUSSED. THESE MESSAGES 
CONFIRM MR. GIULIANI'S CENTRAL 

06:07:05.858 --> 06:07:10.257
ROLE AND PREMEDITATED NATURE OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SOLICITATION OF 

06:07:10.983 --> 06:07:15.505

WAGED BY MR. GIULIANI AND SENIOR
OFFICIALS AT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

06:07:21.287 --> 06:07:27.236
DIRECTION. AGAIN, THIS IS JUST 
SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED 

06:07:27.406 --> 06:07:32.158
FROM AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND THE 
RECORD. AS YOU WILL SING DURING 

06:07:32.774 --> 06:07:37.240
THE TRIAL PRESENTATION AND 
NUMEROUS WHAT'S APP MESSAGES, 

06:07:37.996 --> 06:07:41.293
WHILE  AMBASSADOR VOLKER AND 
SONDLAND AND GIULIANI WERE

PRESSURING  PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKY  AND TOP NEEDS TO ISSUE

06:07:46.982 --> 06:07:48.982
A STATEMENT ANNOUNCING THE 
INVESTIGATION THAT PRESIDENT

06:07:55.951 --> 06:08:01.000
WITHHOLDING AID FURTHER REVEALED
HOW MUCH MORE MATERIAL THERE 

06:08:01.749 --> 06:08:07.499
LIKELY IS THAT RELATES TO THE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. THERE 

06:08:07.700 --> 06:08:12.168
CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT A FULL 
PRODUCTION OF RELEVANT TEXT 

06:08:12.918 --> 06:08:17.409
MESSAGES AND WHAT'S APP MESSAGES
IN TOUCH WITH  UKRAINIAN 

06:08:17.590 --> 06:08:24.972
OFFICIALS INCLUDED AMBASSADOR 
SONDLAND ANN TAYLOR AND  CAN'T 

06:08:25.173 --> 06:08:31.471
WOULD FURTHER ILLUMINATE THE 
MALFEASANCE ADDRESSED IN OUR 

06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:36.141
FIRST ARTICLE. THIS LEADS TO THE
SECOND CATEGORY OF DOCUMENTS 

06:08:36.341 --> 06:08:41.624
THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS 
UNLAWFULLY WITHHOLDING. EMAILS 

06:08:41.825 --> 06:08:44.016
INVOLVING KEY STATE DEPARTMENT 
OFFICIALS CONCERNING 

06:08:44.179 --> 06:08:48.162
INTERACTIONS WITH SENIOR 
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS AND RELATED 

06:08:48.333 --> 06:08:52.594
TO MILITARY AID OF WHITE HOUSE 
MEETINGS AND THE PRESENT DEMAND 

06:08:53.343 --> 06:08:59.073
FOR INVESTIGATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
ON JULY 19, AMBASSADOR GORDON

06:09:02.757 --> 06:09:04.174
SONDLAND SPOKE DIRECTLY WITH 
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY 

06:09:04.175 --> 06:09:07.173
ABOUT THE UPCOMING JULY 25 CALL 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

06:09:07.357 --> 06:09:11.491
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. 
AMBASSADOR  SONDLAND SENT AN 

06:09:11.690 --> 06:09:14.848
EMAIL UPDATING KEY OFFICIALS  
ABOUT SECRETARY POMPEO INCLUDING

06:09:17.175 --> 06:09:19.355
SECRETARY POMPEO AND ACTING 
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF 

06:09:19.524 --> 06:09:25.507
ALBINI AND THE SENIOR ADVISOR, 
ROBERT BLAIR. IN THIS EMAIL HE 

06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:29.159
NOTED THAT HE PREPARED PRESIDENT

06:09:29.361 --> 06:09:34.640
WILLING TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT

06:09:34.840 --> 06:09:39.271
PRESIDENT TRUMP DESIRED. 
SECRETARY AND NICK MULVANEY THEN

06:09:39.437 --> 06:09:41.437
RESPONDED TO SONDLAND 

06:09:44.193 --> 06:09:46.022
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY RECEIVED
THE EMAIL AND RECOMMENDING TO 

06:09:46.023 --> 06:09:49.474
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PHONE CALL
THAT BECAME THE JULY 25th CALL 

06:09:49.874 --> 06:09:56.991
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND UKRAINE. WE 

06:09:57.191 --> 06:10:02.271
KNOW ALL OF THIS NOT BECAUSE THE
STATE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED US 

06:10:02.472 --> 06:10:07.955
WITH CRITICAL DOCUMENTS BUT 
INSTEAD BECAUSE AMBASSADOR 

06:10:08.357 --> 06:10:11.407
SONDLAND PROVIDED US OF 
REPRODUCTION OF THE EMAIL . IN 

06:10:11.609 --> 06:10:15.058
HIS PUBLIC TESTIMONY, AMBASSADOR
SONDLAND  CORRECTLY EXPLAINED 

06:10:15.271 --> 06:10:23.538
THAT THIS EMAIL DEMONSTRATED 
"EVERYONE WAS IN THE LOOP."

06:10:28.271 --> 06:10:33.983
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE WAS IN THE LOOP . IT
WAS NO SECRET. EVERYONE WAS 

06:10:34.156 --> 06:10:38.372
INFORMED VIA EMAIL ON JULY 19, 
DAYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL 

06:10:38.541 --> 06:10:43.705
CALL. AS I COMMUNICATED TO THE 
TEAM, I TOLD PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR

06:10:43.945 --> 06:10:48.172
ZELENSKY IN ADVANCE  THAT 
ASSURANCES TO RUN A FULLY 

06:10:48.936 --> 06:10:51.978
TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION AND 
TURN OVER EVERY STONE WHERE 

06:10:52.150 --> 06:10:56.842
NECESSARY IN HIS CALL WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

06:10:56.843 --> 06:11:02.189
&gt;&gt;  EVEN VIEWED ALONE, THIS 
REPRODUCED EMAIL IS DAMNING. IT 

06:11:02.392 --> 06:11:05.551
WAS SENT SHORTLY AFTER THEY 
PERSONALLY CONVEYED

06:11:09.507 --> 06:11:11.507
THE DEMAND FOR INVESTIGATION TO 
UKRAINIAN'S AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

06:11:11.540 --> 06:11:17.424
WAITING SEVERAL OFFICIALS TO 
SOUND ALARMS. IT WAS SENT JUST A

06:11:17.623 --> 06:11:22.505
FEW DAYS BEFORE THE JULY 25 CALL
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED FOR 

06:11:23.268 --> 06:11:27.160
A FAVOR AND BY ITSELF, THIS 
EMAIL SHOWS

06:11:30.823 --> 06:11:32.454
WHO WAS ENTHRALLED INTO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PLAN TO 

06:11:32.455 --> 06:11:34.604
PRESSURE THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT
FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL GAIN.

06:11:38.952 --> 06:11:41.211
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE FULL EMAIL
CHAIN AND OTHER RELATED EMAILS 

06:11:41.402 --> 06:11:48.700
TO THE KEY TIME PERIOD WOULD 
ALSO BE HIGHLY RELEVANT. WE 

06:11:48.938 --> 06:11:50.933
DON'T HAVE THOSE EMAILS BECAUSE 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS HIDING 

06:11:50.934 --> 06:11:55.205
THEM AND AT THE DIRECTION OF THE
PRESIDENT. THE SENATE SHOULD 

06:11:55.413 --> 06:12:01.498
ISSUE THE PROPOSED SUBPOENA TO 
ENSURE A COMPLETE RECORD OF THE 

06:12:01.698 --> 06:12:04.905
USE AND OTHER RELEVANT EMAILS. 
ANY DOUBT THAT THE STATE 

06:12:05.078 --> 06:12:09.014
DEPARTMENT IS CONCEALING 
CRITICAL EVIDENCE FROM THIS BODY

06:12:09.778 --> 06:12:14.496
WAS RESOLVED WHEN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT WAS RECENTLY ORDERED 

06:12:14.710 --> 06:12:19.376
TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS AND 
INCLUDED EMAILS PURSUANT TO A 

06:12:19.577 --> 06:12:22.425
LAWSUIT UNDER THE FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION ACT. THESE DOCUMENTS

06:12:23.185 --> 06:12:29.124
ARE HEAVILY REDACTED AND LIMITED
TO A VERY NARROW TIME PERIOD BUT

06:12:29.874 --> 06:12:34.010
NEVERTHELESS, DESPITE THE HEAVY 
REDACTION'S, THESE HIGHLY 

06:12:34.607 --> 06:12:39.085
LIMITED GLIMPSE INTO THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT DEMONSTRATES THAT 

06:12:39.843 --> 06:12:44.104
THOSE RECORDS ARE FULL OF 
INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THIS 

06:12:44.334 --> 06:12:48.576
TRIAL. FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERAL OF 
THESE NEWLY ELECTED OR RELEASED 

06:12:48.756 --> 06:12:53.098
EMAILS SHOW MULTIPLE CONTACT 
BETWEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

06:12:53.499 --> 06:12:58.317
INCLUDING SECRETARY POMPEO AND 
MR. GIULIANI THROUGHOUT 2019.

06:13:02.434 --> 06:13:05.486
THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT FACT. MR. 
GIULIANI SERVED AS THE PRESENCE 

06:13:05.686 --> 06:13:10.364
POINT PERSON AND EXECUTED HIS 
CORRUPT SCHEME. MR. GIULIANI 

06:13:10.767 --> 06:13:14.217
REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED THAT HIS 
ROLE WAS TO ADVANCE THE 

06:13:14.981 --> 06:13:16.981
PRESIDENTS PERSONAL AGENDA.

06:13:20.515 --> 06:13:24.581
THE PRESIDENTS POLITICAL 
INTEREST NOT TO PROMOTE THE 

06:13:24.782 --> 06:13:31.896
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST OF 
THE UNITED STATES. THE FACT THAT

06:13:32.097 --> 06:13:35.548
THE PRESIDENTS PRIVATE ATTORNEY 
WAS IN CONTACT AT KEY JUNCTURES 

06:13:35.748 --> 06:13:40.014
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE WHO 
SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE DIRECTED 

06:13:40.215 --> 06:13:47.328
BY THE PRESIDENT TO SUPPORT MR. 
GIULIANI'S EFFORTS IN UKRAINE IS

06:13:47.943 --> 06:13:53.428
RELEVANT, DISTURBING AND TELLING
. FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT ON 

06:13:53.631 --> 06:13:58.294
MARCH 26 AS MR. GIULIANI WAS 
PURSUING THE PRESIDENTS PRIVATE 

06:13:58.494 --> 06:14:05.206
AGENDA IN UKRAINE AND JUST ONE 
WEEK AFTER THEY PUBLISHED AN 

06:14:05.969 --> 06:14:10.487
ARTICLE FEATURING THE UKRAINE 
CONSPIRACY THEORY, SECRETARY 

06:14:10.688 --> 06:14:17.388
POMPEO AND MR. GIULIANI SPOKE 
DIRECTLY ON THE PHONE. THAT SAME

06:14:17.588 --> 06:14:22.187
WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP FORMED A 
PERSONAL SECRETARY AND WAS ASKED

06:14:23.072 --> 06:14:29.105
FOR A DIRECT CONNECTION TO 
SECRETARY POMPEO. BASED ON THESE

06:14:29.274 --> 06:14:33.702
RECORDS, IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT 
SECRETARY POMPEO WAS ALREADY 

06:14:34.614 --> 06:14:40.048
ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH MR. 
GIULIANI IN EARLY SPRING OF 2019

06:14:41.367 --> 06:14:45.175
AND IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THESE 
EFFORTS WERE BACKED BY THE WHITE

06:14:45.347 --> 06:14:50.435
HOUSE GIVEN THE INVOLVEMENT OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL 

06:14:50.602 --> 06:14:59.847
SECRETARY. THIS BODY AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO SEE 

06:15:00.610 --> 06:15:06.548
THESE EMAILS AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT FLUSHING OUT THESE 

06:15:06.749 --> 06:15:10.359
EXCHANGES AND THE DETAIL 
SURROUNDING MR. GIULIANI'S 

06:15:10.527 --> 06:15:16.857
COMMUNICATION WITH SECRETARY 
POMPEO. MOREOVER, BASED ON CALL 

06:15:17.024 --> 06:15:22.996
RECORDS LAWFULLY OBTAINED BY THE
HOUSE FROM THIS PERIOD, WE KNOW 

06:15:23.198 --> 06:15:28.482
FROM MARCH 24 UNTIL MARCH 30 
THAT MR. GIULIANI CALLED THE 

06:15:28.682 --> 06:15:33.763
WHITE HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES AND 
ALSO CONNECTED WITH IN AN 

06:15:34.525 --> 06:15:36.525
IDENTIFIED NUMBER NUMEROUS 
TIMES.

06:15:40.264 --> 06:15:42.701
THESE RECORDS SHOW THAT ON MARCH
27, MR. GIULIANI LACED A SERIES 

06:15:43.313 --> 06:15:48.102
OF CALLS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT
AND SECRETARY POMPEO'S ASSISTANT

06:15:48.595 --> 06:15:55.709
IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN QUICK 
SUCCESSION ALL WITHIN LESS THEN 

06:15:56.468 --> 06:15:58.468
30 MINUTES.

06:16:00.374 --> 06:16:02.374
OBTAINING EMAILS AND OTHER 
DOCUMENTS REGARDING THE STATE 

06:16:02.409 --> 06:16:05.245
DEPARTMENT'S LEADERSHIP 
INTERACTION WITH PRESIDENT 

06:16:05.459 --> 06:16:11.959
TRUMP'S PRIVATE LAWYER IN THIS 
PERIOD WHEN MR. GIULIANI WAS 

06:16:12.360 --> 06:16:14.360
ACTIVELY ORCHESTRATING THE 
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN IN UKRAINE 

06:16:14.592 --> 06:16:18.403
RELATED TO THE SHAM 
INVESTIGATION INTO VICE 

06:16:18.578 --> 06:16:24.756
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE 2016 
ELECTIONS WOULD FURTHER CLARIFY 

06:16:24.956 --> 06:16:30.840
THE PRESENCE INVOLVEMENT AND 
DIRECTION AT THIS KEY JUNCTURE 

06:16:31.255 --> 06:16:36.124
AT THE FORMATION OF A PLOT TO 
SOLICIT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

06:16:37.076 --> 06:16:43.388
INTO OUR ELECTIONS. WE ALSO KNOW
BASED ON RECENTLY OBTAINED 

06:16:43.631 --> 06:16:51.156
DOCUMENTS, EXCUSE ME, THAT AN 
ASSOCIATE OF RUDY GIULIANI HAS 

06:16:51.357 --> 06:16:54.339
ASSISTED HIM IN HIS 
REPRESENTATION OF PRESIDENT 

06:16:54.519 --> 06:17:00.046
TRUMP. THAT GIULIANI LIKELY 
SPOKE WITH SECRETARY POMPEO 

06:17:00.210 --> 06:17:05.323
ABOUT UKRAINE MATTERS EVEN 
EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY 

06:17:05.557 --> 06:17:11.426
UNDERSTOOD. ACCORDING TO 
DOCUMENTS OBTAINED, MR. GIULIANI

06:17:11.597 --> 06:17:19.183
WROTE IN EARLY FEBRUARY 2019 
THAT HE APPARENTLY SPOKE WITH 

06:17:19.396 --> 06:17:23.863
SECRETARY POMPEO ABOUT THE 
REMOVAL OF THE U. S. AMBASSADOR 

06:17:24.624 --> 06:17:31.716
IN UKRAINE, MARIA YOU BONDAGE 
AND SHE WAS VIEWED AS AN 

06:17:31.894 --> 06:17:33.894
IMPEDIMENT

06:17:35.844 --> 06:17:40.310
AND THEY ORCHESTRATED A SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER. HERE IS 

06:17:40.512 --> 06:17:45.328
WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THIS JUST 
LAST WEEK.

06:17:54.122 --> 06:17:56.971
&gt;&gt; DO BELIEVE THIS IS TO GET HER
OUT OF POST WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS 

06:17:57.172 --> 06:18:01.240
IN THE WAY  IN THE EFFORT TO GET
THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE TO 

06:18:01.440 --> 06:18:02.454
ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATIONS TO JOE 
BIDEN? 

06:18:02.455 --> 06:18:06.520
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ONLY MOTIVATION 
. 

06:18:06.521 --> 06:18:08.955
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ONLY MOTIVATION.
&gt;&gt; THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE 

06:18:09.156 --> 06:18:12.150
EMAILS  AND COMMUNICATIONS THAT 
WE KNOW.

06:18:17.688 --> 06:18:19.922
THESE ARE SOME OF THE MILK 
NEGATIONS THAT WE KNOW TO EXIST 

06:18:20.122 --> 06:18:23.268
AND THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE 
INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE

06:18:27.237 --> 06:18:29.237
THE AMBASSADORS REQUEST FOR THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE A 

06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:32.719
STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF HER 
AROUND THE TIME THAT MR. 

06:18:32.919 --> 06:18:36.275
GIULIANI WAS SPEAKING DIRECTLY 
WITH SECRETARY POMPEO.

06:18:40.036 --> 06:18:44.654
THAT STATEMENT NEVER CAME. THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT HAS GATHERED 

06:18:44.829 --> 06:18:46.829
THESE

06:18:49.171 --> 06:18:51.403
RECORDS AND THEY ARE READY TO BE
TURNED OVER PURSUANT TO A 

06:18:51.611 --> 06:18:55.318
SUBPOENA FROM THE SENATE. IT 
WOULD NOT BE A TIME CONSUMING OR

06:18:55.488 --> 06:18:58.035
LENGTHY PROCESS TO OBTAIN THEM 
AND THEY ARE CLEARLY

06:19:01.766 --> 06:19:07.813
IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT DOCUMENTS
TO THE PRESIDENTS SCHEME. IF WE 

06:19:07.979 --> 06:19:15.876
WANT THE FULL AND COMPLETE TRUTH
, WE NEED TO SEE THOSE EMAILS.

06:19:20.248 --> 06:19:22.281
THE SENATE SHOULD ALSO SEEK A 
THIRD ITEM THAT THE STATE 

06:19:22.482 --> 06:19:24.482
DEPARTMENT HAS REFUSED TO 
PROVIDE AND THAT IS MS OR 

06:19:24.515 --> 06:19:28.981
TAYLOR'S EXTRAORDINARY FIRST 
PERSON DIPLOMATIC CABLE TO 

06:19:29.732 --> 06:19:35.492
SECRETARY POMPEO'S DATED AUGUST 
29 AND SENT AT THE 

06:19:35.691 --> 06:19:37.868
RECOMMENDATION OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR, JUMBLE. IN 

06:19:38.039 --> 06:19:44.221
WHICH MS OR TAYLOR'S TRANSLATE 
OBJECTED TO THE WITHHOLDING OF 

06:19:44.422 --> 06:19:50.263
MILITARY AID FROM UKRAINE. IS A 
BATTERED TAYLOR RECOUNTED IN HIS

06:19:50.426 --> 06:19:52.426
DEPOSITION.

06:19:54.573 --> 06:19:58.639
&gt;&gt; YOUR THE END OF INVESTOR 
BULLETINS  VISIT, I ASKED FOR A 

06:19:58.840 --> 06:20:02.303
MEETING PRIVATELY IN WHICH I 
EXPRESSED TO HIM MY SERIOUS 

06:20:02.504 --> 06:20:05.138
CONCERN ABOUT THE WITHHOLDING OF
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE 

06:20:05.554 --> 06:20:07.554
WHILE THE UKRAINIANS WERE 
DEFENDING THEIR COUNTRY FOR 

06:20:07.729 --> 06:20:11.237
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. MS REPORT 
AND RECOMMENDED THAT I SEND THE 

06:20:11.438 --> 06:20:13.789
FIRST PERSON CABLE TO SECRETARY 
POMPEO

06:20:17.738 --> 06:20:19.738
DIRECTLY RELATING MY CONCERNS. I
WROTE AND TRANSMITTED SUCH A 

06:20:19.771 --> 06:20:23.221
CABLE ON AUGUST 29 DESCRIBING 
THE FOLLY I SAW HIM WITHHOLDING 

06:20:23.421 --> 06:20:28.303
MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE IN TIME 
WHEN HOSTILITY WAS STILL ACTIVE 

06:20:28.503 --> 06:20:30.536
IN THE EAST AND RUSSIA WAS 
WATCHING CLOSELY TO GAUGE THE 

06:20:30.736 --> 06:20:33.075
LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR THE 
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT.

06:20:36.632 --> 06:20:39.611
THE RUSSIANS AS I SAID WOULD 
LOVE TO SEE THE HUMILIATION OF 

06:20:39.775 --> 06:20:41.775
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY AT 
THE HANDS OF THE AMERICANS.  I 

06:20:41.900 --> 06:20:46.917
TOLD THE SECRETARY THAT I COULD 
NOT AND WOULD NOT DEFEND SUCH A 

06:20:47.086 --> 06:20:50.645
POLICY. ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED NO 
SPECIFIC RESPONSE, I HEARD THAT 

06:20:51.047 --> 06:20:54.297
SOON THEREAFTER THAT THERE IS A 
CABLE WITH HIM TO THE MEETING 

06:20:55.261 --> 06:20:57.261
FOCUSED

06:20:58.764 --> 06:20:59.780
ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO 
UKRAINE. 

06:20:59.781 --> 06:21:05.825
&gt;&gt;  WHILE WE KNOW THAT THE CABLE
WAS RECEIVED, WE DID NOT KNOW 

06:21:06.005 --> 06:21:10.948
WHETHER OR HOW THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT RESPONDED. NOR DO WE 

06:21:11.163 --> 06:21:13.343
KNOW IF THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
POSSESSES ANY OTHER INTERNAL 

06:21:13.536 --> 06:21:22.479
RECORDS RELATING TO THIS CABLE. 
THIS CABLE IS VITAL FOR THREE 

06:21:22.643 --> 06:21:26.997
REASONS. FIRST, IT DEMONSTRATES 
THE HARM THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

06:21:27.201 --> 06:21:31.063
DID TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 
WHEN HE USED FOREIGN POLICY AS 

06:21:31.826 --> 06:21:36.546
AN INSTRUMENT OF HIS OWN 
PERSONAL POLITICAL GAIN. SECOND,

06:21:36.746 --> 06:21:39.237
ON THE SAME DAY THE CABLE WAS 
SENT, PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 

06:21:39.412 --> 06:21:46.094
ZELENSKY SENIOR EIGHT  SAID THAT
HE WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

06:21:46.296 --> 06:21:50.308
HOLD ON MILITARY ASSISTANCE. HE 
ADDED THAT THE UKRAINIANS WERE 

06:21:50.476 --> 06:21:52.476
DESPERATE

06:21:53.747 --> 06:22:01.078
. IN OTHER WORDS, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S EFFORT TO USE MILITARY 

06:22:01.253 --> 06:22:07.628
AID TO APPLY ADDITIONAL PRESSURE
ON UKRAINE WAS WORKING. FINALLY,

06:22:07.828 --> 06:22:12.707
BASED ON REPORTING OF A NEW YORK
TIMES WE NOW KNOW WITHIN DAYS OF

06:22:13.467 --> 06:22:16.560
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR SENDING THIS 
CABLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP DISCUSSED

06:22:17.324 --> 06:22:22.808
UKRAINIAN SECURITY WITH 
SECRETARY POMPEO AND THE DEFENSE

06:22:22.997 --> 06:22:28.141
SECRETARY AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR. THE INVESTIGATION 

06:22:28.340 --> 06:22:31.993
UNCOVERED TESTIMONY THAT 
SECRETARY POMPEO BROUGHT 

06:22:32.409 --> 06:22:36.470
AMBASSADORS TAILORED TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND PERHAPS DURING 

06:22:37.229 --> 06:22:45.965
THIS MEETING. IT WAS PERHAPS ALL
THREE OF THEM PLEADING WITH THE 

06:22:46.236 --> 06:22:55.713
PRESIDENT TO RESUME THE CRUCIAL 
MILITARY AID. YET, THE PRESIDENT

06:22:55.884 --> 06:22:57.884
REFUSED.

06:23:02.071 --> 06:23:04.301
THIS BODY HAS A RIGHT TO SEE 
INVESTOR TAYLOR'S CABLE AS WELL 

06:23:04.502 --> 06:23:06.681
AS THE OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT 
RECORDS ADDRESSING THE OFFICIAL 

06:23:06.862 --> 06:23:11.308
RESPONSE TO IT. ALTHOUGH IT MAY 
HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AT THE TIME

06:23:11.815 --> 06:23:14.049
, THE STATE DEPARTMENT CAN NO 
LONGER CLAIM THAT THE TOPIC OF 

06:23:14.809 --> 06:23:16.809
SECURITY ASSISTANCE REMAINS 
CLASSIFIED TODAY

06:23:21.764 --> 06:23:23.803
IN LIGHT OF THE PRESENT DECISION
TO DECLASSIFY HIS TWO TELEPHONE 

06:23:24.564 --> 06:23:26.564
CALLS WITH PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKY AND MR. MULVANEY'S  

06:23:26.792 --> 06:23:33.545
PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT SECURITY
ASSISTANCE. THE FOURTH CATEGORY 

06:23:34.307 --> 06:23:37.759
OF DOCUMENTS THAT THE SENATE 
SHOULD SUBPOENA OUR 

06:23:37.928 --> 06:23:41.421
CONTEMPORANEOUS FIRST-PERSON 
ACCOUNTS FROM STATE DEPARTMENT 

06:23:41.592 --> 06:23:48.102
OFFICIALS THAT ARE CAUGHT UP IN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SCHEME.

06:23:52.032 --> 06:24:01.779
AND THIS IS AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
AND POLITICAL HOMES TO HELP 

06:24:02.181 --> 06:24:08.277
COMPLETE THE RECORD AND CLARIFY 
HOW IT UNFOLDED AND HOW THE 

06:24:09.040 --> 06:24:15.543
UKRAINIANS REACTED. MR. KENT 
WROTE THE MOST FOR AT LEAST FOUR

06:24:15.794 --> 06:24:20.678
TIMES ACCORDING TO HIS 
TESTIMONY. AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

06:24:20.874 --> 06:24:27.786
TOOK EXTENSIVE NOTES OF NEARLY 
EVERY CONVERSATION HE HAD AND 

06:24:27.987 --> 06:24:32.594
SOME IN A LITTLE NOTEBOOK. DAVID
HOLMES, THE EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN 

06:24:32.766 --> 06:24:39.565
UKRAINE WAS A CONSISTENT 
NOTETAKER OF IMPORTANT MEETINGS 

06:24:39.966 --> 06:24:41.966
WITH UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS.

06:24:45.047 --> 06:24:47.481
&gt;&gt; DID YOU TAKE NOTES OF THIS 
CONVERSATION  ON SEPTEMBER 1 

06:24:47.704 --> 06:24:49.704
WITH AMBASSADOR SOMEONE

06:24:52.148 --> 06:24:53.165
?  
&gt;&gt; I DID. 

06:24:53.166 --> 06:24:55.613
&gt;&gt; DID YOU TAKE NOTES RELATED TO
MOST OF THE CONVERSATIONS  IF 

06:24:55.814 --> 06:24:58.048
NOT ALL OF THEM THAT YOU ARE 
CITED IN THE OPEN STATEMENT? 

06:24:58.248 --> 06:25:03.330
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THEM.  
&gt;&gt;  YOU ARE AWARE I PRESUME THAT

06:25:03.531 --> 06:25:09.042
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT 
PROVIDED THOSE NOTES TO THE 

06:25:09.215 --> 06:25:10.846
COMMITTEE, IS THAT RIGHT? 
&gt;&gt; I AM AWARE. 

06:25:10.847 --> 06:25:13.280
&gt;&gt; WE WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF  
REVIEWING THEM TO ASK THESE 

06:25:13.483 --> 06:25:17.950
QUESTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.  I UNDERSTAND THAT 

06:25:18.163 --> 06:25:19.580
THEY MAY BE COMING SOONER OR 
LATER. 

06:25:19.581 --> 06:25:21.615
&gt;&gt; WE WOULD WELCOME THAT. 
&gt;&gt; THE STATE DEPARTMENT  NEVER 

06:25:21.813 --> 06:25:24.810
PRODUCED THOSE NOTES AND AS 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, DEPUTY 

06:25:24.982 --> 06:25:28.875
SECRETARY OR ASSISTANT SECRETARY
CAN'T TESTIFIED ABOUT A KEY 

06:25:29.041 --> 06:25:32.093
DOCUMENT THAT HE DRAFTED ON 
AUGUST 16 DESCRIBING HIS CONCERN

06:25:35.217 --> 06:25:37.217
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
WAS ATTEMPTING TO PRESSURE 

06:25:37.610 --> 06:25:43.493
UKRAINE INTO OPENING POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS.

06:25:48.630 --> 06:25:51.739
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LET'S START WITH YOU,
MR. KENT.  AND YOUR TESTIMONY, 

06:25:52.417 --> 06:26:00.547
YOU SAID THAT IT BECAME CLEAR TO
ME THAT GIULIANI'S EFFORTS TAKE 

06:26:01.374 --> 06:26:04.264
GET VERTICALLY MOTIVATED 
INVESTIGATIONS WERE NOW 

06:26:04.666 --> 06:26:08.277
INFECTING U. S. ENGAGEMENT WITH 
UKRAINE LEVERAGING THE DESIRE 

06:26:08.453 --> 06:26:14.830
FOR A WHITE HOUSE MEETING. DID 
YOU ACTUALLY WRITE A MEMO 

06:26:15.030 --> 06:26:17.030
DOCUMENTING YOUR CONCERNS

06:26:20.712 --> 06:26:22.712
THAT THERE WAS AN EFFORT 
UNDERWAY TO PRESSURE UKRAINE TO 

06:26:22.746 --> 06:26:24.746
OPEN AN INVESTIGATION TO BENEFIT
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

06:26:29.857 --> 06:26:32.504
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. I WROTE A MEMO TO
THE FILE IN AUGUST 16. 

06:26:32.505 --> 06:26:34.536
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE 
MEMO, DO WE? 

06:26:34.537 --> 06:26:36.357
&gt;&gt; I SUBMITTED IT  SO TO THE 
SUBPOENA. 

06:26:36.358 --> 06:26:38.802
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE NOT  RECEIVED ONE 
PIECE OF PAPER FROM THE STATE 

06:26:39.004 --> 06:26:43.066
DEPARTMENT RELATIVE TO THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 

06:26:43.067 --> 06:26:46.318
&gt;&gt; DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
CAN'T  ALSO MEMORIALIZED A 

06:26:46.522 --> 06:26:50.985
SEPTEMBER 15 CONVERSATION AT 
WHICH AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 

06:26:51.386 --> 06:26:55.049
DESCRIBED A UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL 
ACCUSING AMERICA OF HYPOCRISY 

06:26:56.016 --> 06:26:59.113
FOR ADVISING PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR
ZELENSKY AGAINST INVESTIGATING  

06:26:59.649 --> 06:27:06.013
A PRIOR UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. 
THEY DID NOT DESCRIBE THAT 

06:27:06.212 --> 06:27:08.212
DURING THE TESTIMONY

06:27:10.693 --> 06:27:13.641
AND IT COMES AFTER VOLKER MADE 
THE POINT

06:27:19.575 --> 06:27:25.054
AND THEY HAD IT UNDER PRESIDENT 
TRUMAN AND OPEN INVESTIGATIONS.

06:27:28.970 --> 06:27:30.970
HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS 
APPROPRIATE AND THEN

06:27:36.282 --> 06:27:38.112
YOU MEAN THE TYPE OF 
INVESTIGATIONS YOU ARE PUSHING 

06:27:38.113 --> 06:27:45.211
FOR US TO DO ON BY AND CLINTON. 
THE CONVERSATION MAKES CLEAR THE

06:27:45.427 --> 06:27:48.464
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS UNDERSTOOD 
THE CORRUPT NATURE OF PRESIDENT 

06:27:49.217 --> 06:27:55.119
TRUMP'S REQUEST AND THEREFORE 
DOUBTED AMERICAN CREDIBILITY ON 

06:27:55.288 --> 06:28:01.064
ANTICORRUPTION MEASURES. RECORDS
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND OTHER

06:28:01.265 --> 06:28:05.279
NOTES AND MEMORANDUMS BY SENIOR 
AMERICAN OFFICIALS IN UKRAINE 

06:28:05.461 --> 06:28:08.983
WOULD FLUSH OUT AND HELP 
COMPLETE THE RECORD FOR THE 

06:28:09.746 --> 06:28:17.515
FIRST ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT. 
THEY WOULD TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH 

06:28:17.915 --> 06:28:24.829
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO 
THIS BODY. YOU SHOULD REQUIRE 

06:28:25.029 --> 06:28:32.346
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE 
THEM. TO SUMMARIZE, THE SENATE 

06:28:32.547 --> 06:28:37.014
SHOULD ISSUE THE SUBPOENA 
PROPOSED AND THE AMENDMENT 

06:28:37.215 --> 06:28:39.807
REQUIRING THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
TO TURN OVER RELEVANT MESSAGES 

06:28:39.977 --> 06:28:41.977
AND

06:28:43.515 --> 06:28:46.916
WHAT'S APP MESSAGES AND EMAILS 
AND DEMONIC  CABLES AND NOTES. 

06:28:47.084 --> 06:28:55.203
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE REQUIRED BY 
THE CONSTITUTION TO HOLD.

06:30:19.517 --> 06:30:22.964
THEY BEGRUDGINGLY AND SLOWLY 
PRODUCED AN EXTREMIST WILL SET 

06:30:23.723 --> 06:30:29.062
OF MATERIALS. AND HAS INSISTED 
ON A PLANE HEAVY AND DUBIOUS 

06:30:30.023 --> 06:30:38.409
REDUCTIONS. PRIOR LAWSUITS FILED
BY THE PARTIES CANNOT SERVE AS A

06:30:38.609 --> 06:30:40.609
CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE. 

06:30:43.078 --> 06:30:48.972
FOR CREDIBLE OVERSIGHT. THE 
STILL ALARMING THAT THE 

06:30:49.174 --> 06:30:53.840
ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED MORE
DOCUMENTS, PURSUANT TO THE 

06:30:54.254 --> 06:30:59.321
FEDERAL OFFICE OF INFORMATION 
ACT LAWSUIT, BY PRIVATE CITIZENS

06:31:00.083 --> 06:31:02.083
AND ENTITIES

06:31:04.201 --> 06:31:11.311
AND CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS. 
FINALLY, AS WE ALL KNOW, 

06:31:11.712 --> 06:31:13.546
LITIGATION WILL TAKE AN 
EXTREMELY LONG TIME. LIKELY, 

06:31:13.547 --> 06:31:15.547
YEARS. NOT WEEKS OR MONTHS. 

06:31:18.209 --> 06:31:21.057
WHILE THE MISCONDUCT OF THIS 
PRESIDENT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE 

06:31:21.818 --> 06:31:25.215
ATTENTION. THE MISCONDUCT OF 
THIS PRESIDENT

06:31:29.386 --> 06:31:31.386
REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. IF
THIS BODY IS TRULY COMMITTED TO 

06:31:31.418 --> 06:31:36.899
A FAIR TRIAL. IT CANNOT LET THE 
PRESIDENT PLAY A GAME OF 

06:31:37.649 --> 06:31:40.762
KEEPAWAY. AND DICTATE WHAT 
EVIDENCE THE SENSORS CAN AND 

06:31:41.523 --> 06:31:43.523
CANNOT SEE

06:31:46.047 --> 06:31:48.080
BURIED ON HIS GUILT OR 
INNOCENCE. THIS BODY CANNOT 

06:31:48.282 --> 06:31:52.946
PERMIT HIM TO BURY ALL OF THE 
EVIDENCE WHILE DISINGENUOUSLY 

06:31:53.147 --> 06:31:58.230
INSISTING ON LAWSUITS THAT HE 
DOES NOT ACTUALLY THINK WE CAN 

06:31:58.431 --> 06:32:03.848
FILE. ONES THAT HE KNOWS, WILL 
NOT BE RESOLVED UNTIL AFTER THE 

06:32:04.004 --> 06:32:07.520
ELECTION THAT HE IS TRYING TO 
CHEAT, TO WIN. 

06:32:10.568 --> 06:32:18.130
INSTEAD, TO HONOR YOUR OATH TO 
DO IMPARTIAL JUSTICE. WE URGE 

06:32:18.883 --> 06:32:23.626
EACH SENATOR TO SUPPORT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT. THAT SUBPOENA 

06:32:24.027 --> 06:32:28.491
SHOULD BE ISSUED NOW. AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL, RATHER 

06:32:28.705 --> 06:32:34.589
THAN AT THE END. SO THAT THESE 
DOCUMENTS CAN BE REVIEWED, AND 

06:32:34.789 --> 06:32:41.289
THEIR IMPORTANCE BE WEIGHED, BY 
THE PARTIES, THE SENATE, AND BY 

06:32:41.490 --> 06:32:48.203
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS HOW
THINGS WORK, IN EVERY COURTROOM 

06:32:48.604 --> 06:32:55.104
IN THE NATION. AND IS HOW THEY 
SHOULD WORK HERE, ESPECIALLY 

06:32:55.304 --> 06:32:59.102
BECAUSE THE STATE, AS YOU WILL 
KNOW,

06:33:02.617 --> 06:33:05.870
WERE SELECT FIVE. THE TRUTH IS 
THERE. FACTS ARE STUBBORN 

06:33:06.617 --> 06:33:13.334
THINGS. THE PRESIDENT IS TRY TO 
HIDE IT. THIS BODY SHOULD NOT 

06:33:13.477 --> 06:33:20.900
SURRENDER TO HIS OBSTRUCTION. BY
REFUSING TO DEMAND A FULL 

06:33:21.851 --> 06:33:29.380
RECORD. THAT IS WHERE THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.

06:33:30.449 --> 06:33:35.730
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS RESERVE THE BALANCE OF 

06:33:35.931 --> 06:33:37.931
OUR TIME. 

06:33:39.729 --> 06:33:45.834
&gt;&gt; AND MR. CIPOLLONE . 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. 

06:33:48.123 --> 06:33:50.557
IN THE INTEREST OF TIME, I WILL 
NOT REPEAT ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS 

06:33:50.756 --> 06:33:54.219
THAT WE HAVE MADE ALREADY, WITH 
RESPECT TO THESE MOTIONS. I 

06:33:54.419 --> 06:34:00.101
WOULD SAY ONE THING BEFORE TURN 
IT OVER TO MY COCOUNSEL. MR. 

06:34:00.317 --> 06:34:05.384
ADAM SCHIFF CAME HERE AND SAID, 
HE IS NOT ASKING YOU TO DO 

06:34:05.799 --> 06:34:09.450
SOMETHING HE WOULD NOT DO FOR 
HIMSELF. HOUSE MANAGER SAID, WE

AND IT WAS BASED ON HIS OWN 
&gt;&gt; EMISSION. AND CONNECTED TO 

06:36:36.510 --> 06:36:38.341
ANY CONVERSATION WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. HERE IS THE QUESTION.

06:36:38.342 --> 06:36:45.241
WHAT ABOUT THE AID? AMBASSADOR 
FOLKERTS SAID IT WAS TIED ASPECT

06:36:45.599 --> 06:36:49.925
EIGHT WAS NOT TIED. ANSWER, I 
DID NOT SAY THEY WERE 

06:36:50.123 --> 06:36:51.954
CONCLUSIVELY TIED EITHER. I 
SAID, I WAS PRESUMING IT. 

06:36:51.955 --> 06:36:56.759
QUESTION, OKAY. THE PRESIDENT 
NEVER TOLD YOU THEY WERE TIED? 

06:36:56.919 --> 06:37:03.732

06:37:08.898 --> 06:37:12.210
INVESTIGATION? ANSWER:THAT IS 
CORRECT. 

06:37:17.547 --> 06:37:19.363
AND  AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND 
TESTIFIED THAT HE ASKED 

06:37:19.364 --> 06:37:21.814
PRESIDENT TRUMP DARKLY ABOUT 
THESE ISSUES. THE PRESIDENT 

06:37:22.013 --> 06:37:24.013
ESPECIALLY TOLD HIM HE SOMEONE 
ANYTHING FROM UKRAINE. I WANT 

06:37:24.047 --> 06:37:29.930
NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT 
NO QUID PRO QUO. TELL  VOLODYMYR

06:37:30.130 --> 06:37:32.812
ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 
SIMILAR COMMENTS WERE MADE TO 

06:37:32.979 --> 06:37:38.257
SIMILAR JOHNSON. THOSE ARE THE 
FACTS. THAT IS THE FACTS. NOBODY

06:37:38.472 --> 06:37:44.490
IS ABOVE THE LAW. HERE IS THE 
LAW. AS EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS

06:37:44.642 --> 06:37:50.242
KNOWS, UNDOUBTEDLY AWARE, 
SEPARATE FROM STATE PRIVILEGES 

06:37:50.456 --> 06:37:56.137
IS THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDICATION 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, MEDICATIONS

06:37:56.340 --> 06:37:58.340
A PERFORMANCE OF A PRESIDENT % 
ABILITY. THE PRESIDENTIAL 

06:37:58.730 --> 06:38:02.022
COMMUNICATION PRIVILEGE OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN. COURTS 

06:38:02.788 --> 06:38:05.683
HAVE RECOGNIZED A GREAT PUBLIC 
INTEREST IN PRESERVING THE 

06:38:05.883 --> 06:38:09.547
CONFIDENTIALITY OF CONVERSATIONS
THAT TAKE PLACE WITH THE 

06:38:09.748 --> 06:38:12.115
PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE OF 
OFFICIAL DUTIES BECAUSE SUCH 

06:38:12.262 --> 06:38:16.049
CONFIDENTIALITY IS NEEDED TO 
PROTECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

06:38:16.248 --> 06:38:20.059
EXECUTIVE DECISION-MAKING 
PROCESS. AND RAISED SEAL CASES 

06:38:20.198 --> 06:38:22.198
DECIDED

06:38:24.578 --> 06:38:26.578
IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
COURT OF APPEALS. THE SUPREME 

06:38:26.608 --> 06:38:28.226
COURT FOUND THE PRIVILEGE 
NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE THE 

06:38:28.227 --> 06:38:31.891
CANDOR OF PRESIDENTS TO ADVISORS
AND TO PROVIDE A PRESIDENT AND 

06:38:32.092 --> 06:38:34.270
THOSE WHO ASSIST HIM, WITH 
FREEDOM TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES.

06:38:36.759 --> 06:38:38.759
IN THE PROCESS OF ULTIMATELY 
SHAPING POLICY TO MAKE DECISIONS

06:38:38.792 --> 06:38:41.649
AND TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT MANY 
WOULD BE UNWILLING TO EXPRESS 

06:38:41.849 --> 06:38:46.115
EXCEPT IN PRIVATE. FOR THESE 
REASONS, PRESIDENTIAL 

06:38:46.330 --> 06:38:49.322
CONVERSATIONS ARE PRESUMPTIVELY 
PRIVILEGED. THERE IS SOMETHING 

06:38:49.470 --> 06:38:53.630
ELSE ABOUT THIS PRIVILEGE. 
COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY 

06:38:54.396 --> 06:38:59.931
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORS, AGAIN, 
QUOTING COURT. BY THE WAY, WE 

06:39:00.683 --> 06:39:05.161
ARE LAWSUITS. WILL YOUR 
LAWSUITS. 

06:39:08.463 --> 06:39:10.463
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF 

06:39:10.500 --> 06:39:13.090
THE UNITED STATES, NEWLY 
ELECTED. AND THE MEMBERS AND 

06:39:13.243 --> 06:39:18.212
MANAGERS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT 
LAWYER LAWSUITS. THE 

06:39:18.960 --> 06:39:24.110
CONSTITUTION ALLOWS LAWYER 
LAWSUITS. IT IS DISRESPECTED THE

06:39:24.308 --> 06:39:27.361
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES TO SAY THAT IN THE SAME 

06:39:27.559 --> 06:39:34.258
RIGHTS. LAWYER LAWSUITS. HERE IS
THE LAW. COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY 

06:39:35.008 --> 06:39:37.107
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORS IN THE 
COURSE OF PREPARING ADVISED TO 

06:39:37.869 --> 06:39:39.869
THE PRESIDENT

06:39:41.374 --> 06:39:42.789
, COME UNDER PRESIDENTIAL 
COMMUNICATIONS PRIVILEGE. EVEN 

06:39:42.790 --> 06:39:45.186
WHEN THE COMMUNIATIONS ARE NOT 
MADE DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT. 

06:39:46.241 --> 06:39:48.475
EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT MADE 
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT. 

06:39:48.689 --> 06:39:53.101
ADVISOR TO ADVISOR. GIVEN THE 
NEED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT 

06:39:53.250 --> 06:39:57.007
ELBOWROOM FOR ADVISORS TO OBTAIN
INFORMATION FROM ALL 

06:39:57.222 --> 06:39:59.656
KNOWLEDGEABLE SOURCES. THE 
PRIVILEGE MUST APPLY BOTH TO 

06:40:00.413 --> 06:40:06.356
MEDICATIONS, WHICH THIS ADVISORS
SOLICIT AND RECEIVE FROM OTHERS,

06:40:06.557 --> 06:40:08.557
AS WELL AS THOSE THEY AUTHORIZE 
THEMSELVES. THE PRIVILEGE MUST 

06:40:08.588 --> 06:40:13.063
ALSO EXTEND TO COMMUNICATIONS 
AUTHORED OR RECEIVED IN RESPONSE

06:40:13.807 --> 06:40:18.136
TO SOLICITATIONS MEMBERS OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY STAFF. IN 

06:40:18.337 --> 06:40:21.130
MANY INSTANCES, ADVISORS MUST 
RELY ON THEIR STAFFS TO 

06:40:21.297 --> 06:40:24.436
INVESTIGATE AN ISSUE AND 
FORMULATE ADVISED GIVEN TO THE 

06:40:25.197 --> 06:40:27.197
PRESIDENT. 

06:40:28.645 --> 06:40:32.303
LAWSUITS. THE CONSTITUTION. 

06:40:35.612 --> 06:40:39.676
A DANGEROUS MOMENT FOR AMERICA 
WHEN AND IMPEACHMENT OF THE 

06:40:40.081 --> 06:40:44.474
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
IS BEING RUSHED THROUGH BECAUSE 

06:40:44.622 --> 06:40:51.403
OF LAWYER LAWSUITS. THE 
CONSTITUTION ALLOWS THIS, IF 

06:40:51.545 --> 06:40:55.265
NECESSARY. THE CONSTITUTION 
DEMANDS IT, IF NECESSARY. THANK 

06:40:55.409 --> 06:40:57.409
YOU A CHIEF JUSTICE. 

06:41:11.506 --> 06:41:14.552
13 MINUTES FOR A BOTTLE, MR. 
ADAM SCHIFF. 

06:41:18.685 --> 06:41:23.952
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU CHIEF JUSTICE. WILL
RESPOND TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

06:41:24.152 --> 06:41:32.280
POINTS, IF I CAN. FIRST COUNSEL 
SAID THE HOUSE WOULD LIKE TO 

06:41:32.483 --> 06:41:36.132
CALL JOHN BOLTON. THE HOUSE DO 
NOT SEE HIS TESTIMONY DURING THE

06:41:36.347 --> 06:41:38.347
INVESTIGATION. FOR CIVIL, WE 
DID. INVITED JOHN BOLTON TO 

06:41:38.921 --> 06:41:43.050
TESTIFY. YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD 
US? I AM NOT COMING AND IF YOU 

06:41:43.251 --> 06:41:48.074
SUBPOENA ME I WILL SEE YOU. THAT
WAS HIS ANSWER. I WILL SEE YOU. 

06:41:49.347 --> 06:41:52.114
STAPLETON IS REPRESENTED BY THE 
SAME LAWYER, WHO REPRESENTS DR. 

06:41:52.264 --> 06:41:57.461
KUPPERMAN WHO DID TO US WHEN HE 
WAS SUBPOENAED. WE KNOW THAT 

06:41:57.612 --> 06:42:02.742
JOHN BOLTON WOULD MAKE GOOD ON 
HIS THREAT. MR. SEKULOW SAID 

06:42:02.957 --> 06:42:04.957
SOMETHING ABOUT LAWYER LAWSUITS.

06:42:07.424 --> 06:42:09.253
HAVE TO CONFESS I WAS NOT 
FOLLOWING THE ARGUMENT. 

06:42:09.254 --> 06:42:12.288
SOMETHING ABOUT LAWYER LAWSUITS.
WE ARE AGAINST LAWYER LAWSUITS. 

06:42:12.502 --> 06:42:16.151
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I
CAN TELL YOU THIS. THE TRUMP 

06:42:16.352 --> 06:42:19.201
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS IN COURT 
IN THAT CASE AND OTHER CASES 

06:42:19.950 --> 06:42:24.480
ARGUING CONGRESS CANNOT GO TO 
COURT TO ENFORCE ITS SUBPOENAS. 

06:42:24.681 --> 06:42:29.303
SO WHEN THEY SAY, SOMETHING 
ABOUT LAWYER LAWSUITS, AND THEY 

06:42:29.452 --> 06:42:34.227
SAY, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
THE HOUSE SUING TO GET THESE 

06:42:34.441 --> 06:42:37.480
WITNESSES TO SHOW UP AND THEY 
SHOULD HAVE SUED TO GET THEM TO 

06:42:37.692 --> 06:42:41.490
SHOW UP, THEIR OWN LAWYERS ARE 
IN COURT SAYING THE HOUSE HAS NO

06:42:41.636 --> 06:42:45.205
SUCH RIGHT. THEY ARE IN COURT 
SAYING, YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR 

06:42:45.406 --> 06:42:49.413
LAWSUITS. THAT ARGUMENT CANNOT 
BE MADE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. 

06:42:52.267 --> 06:42:59.014
WHAT'S MORE, IN THE KUPPERMAN 
LITIGATION THIS I'M SORRY, IN 

06:42:59.219 --> 06:43:02.867
THE McGANN LITIGATION, WHICH 
TESTED THE SAME BOGUS THEORY OF 

06:43:03.081 --> 06:43:07.544
ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY. IN THAT 
LAWSUIT, ONCE AGAIN INVOLVING 

06:43:07.744 --> 06:43:09.782
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER, DON 
McGANN, THE ONE WHO WAS TOLD TO 

06:43:09.978 --> 06:43:14.049
FIRE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND LIED 
ABOUT IT. THAT LAWSUIT. TO GET 

06:43:14.243 --> 06:43:17.907
HIS TESTIMONY. JUDGE JACKSON 
RULED ON THE VERY RECENTLY. WHEN

06:43:18.108 --> 06:43:21.763
THEY MADE THE SAME BOGUS CLAIM, 
HE IS ABSOLUTELY IMMUNE FROM 

06:43:22.524 --> 06:43:25.421
SHOWING UP. THE JUDGE SAID, THAT
IS NONSENSE. THERE IS NO SUPPORT

06:43:26.177 --> 06:43:31.920
FOR THAT IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
NOT IN CASE LAW. THE JUDGE SAID 

06:43:32.681 --> 06:43:37.147
SOMETHING MORE THAT WAS 
INTERESTING. BECAUSE WHAT WE 

06:43:37.301 --> 06:43:42.082
URGE JOHN BOLTON'S LAWYER, IS 
YOU DO NOT NEED TO FILE A 

06:43:42.842 --> 06:43:47.350
LAWSUIT. DR. KUPPERMAN, YOU DO 
NOT NEED TO FILE A LAWSUIT. 

06:43:47.565 --> 06:43:49.802
THERE IS ONE ALREADY FILED 
INVOLVING DON McGANN THAT IS 

06:43:50.003 --> 06:43:56.298
ABOUT TO BE DECIDED. UNLESS YOUR
REAL PURPOSE IS DELAY. UNLESS 

06:43:56.502 --> 06:43:59.286
YOUR REAL PURPOSE IS TO AVOID 
TESTIMONY AND YOU JUST WISH TO 

06:43:59.430 --> 06:44:04.268
GIVE DEPRESSION OF A WILLINGNESS
TO COME FORWARD. AND WITH THE 

06:44:04.423 --> 06:44:06.858
COURT'S BLESSING, IF THAT IS 
TRUE, AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE 

06:44:07.058 --> 06:44:11.125
McGANN DECISION. OF COURSE, THEY
WERE NOT WILLING. BECAUSE THEY 

06:44:11.328 --> 06:44:15.791
DID NOT WANT TO TESTIFY. FOR 
WHATEVER REASON, JOHN BOLTON IS 

06:44:15.991 --> 06:44:21.888
NOW WILLING TO TESTIFY. I DO NOT
KNOW WHEN THAT IS. MAYBE IT IS 

06:44:22.092 --> 06:44:27.773
BECAUSE HE HAS A BOOK COMING 
OUT. MAYBE IS IT WOULD BE HARD 

06:44:27.986 --> 06:44:29.986
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE WAS UNWILLING
TO SHARE IMPORTANT INFORMATION 

06:44:30.018 --> 06:44:33.601
WITH THE SENATE. THAT HE CANNOT 
SHOP FOR HOUSE DEPOSITION OR 

06:44:33.772 --> 06:44:35.772
INTERVIEW

06:44:40.167 --> 06:44:42.402
BECAUSE HE WOULD NEED COURT 
PERMISSION TO DO IT, BUT HE CAN 

06:44:42.601 --> 06:44:45.250
PUT IT INTO A BOOK. I DO NOT 
KNOW. I CANNOT SPEAK TO HIS 

06:44:45.456 --> 06:44:47.684
MOTIVATION. HE IS WILLING TO 
COME NOW. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO 

06:44:47.885 --> 06:44:51.952
HEAR HIM. BUT, OF COURSE, THEY 
WERE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND TO 

06:44:52.153 --> 06:44:55.601
THE COURT DECISION IN McGANN. 
THE COURT SAID SOMETHING 

06:44:56.017 --> 06:44:58.650
INTERESTING. ONE OF THE 
ARGUMENTS THEY HAD AND ONE OF 

06:44:59.412 --> 06:45:03.932
THE ARGUMENTS JOHN BOLTON'S 
LAWYER WAS MAKING, ASKED WHAT 

06:45:04.132 --> 06:45:06.132
THEY NEEDED THEIR OWN SEPARATE 
LITIGATION WAS JOHN BOLTON AND 

06:45:06.164 --> 06:45:08.398
DR. KUPPERMAN WERE NATIONALS 
GRITTY PEOPLE. DON McGANN IS 

06:45:08.601 --> 06:45:10.601
JUST WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL. 

06:45:14.098 --> 06:45:15.991
CURRENTLY, YOU'VE NOTHING TO DO 
WITH NATIONALS GRITTY THEY 

06:45:15.992 --> 06:45:21.691
CANNOT BE BOUND. THE JUDGE IN 
THE DON McGANN CASE THAT IT 

06:45:21.834 --> 06:45:26.691
APPLIES TO NATIONAL SECURITY 
STUFF ALSO. WE DO HAVE A COURT 

06:45:26.892 --> 06:45:31.356
DECISION. ONCE MORE, WE HAVE THE
HARRIET MYERS CASE AND THE 

06:45:31.557 --> 06:45:34.205
GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 
LIKEWISE, THE COURT MADE SHORT 

06:45:34.405 --> 06:45:39.186
SHRIFT OF THE CLAIM OF COMPLETE 
UNITY. THE COMMENTS MADE ABOUT

06:45:43.751 --> 06:45:45.927
FOLKERS TESTIMONY BY MR. 
SEKULOW. WAS ALONG THESE LINES. 

06:45:46.586 --> 06:45:52.082
HE SAID THE PRESIDENT NEVER TOLD
HIM THAT THE MEETING WAS BEING 

06:45:52.286 --> 06:45:57.566
CONDITIONED ON UKRAINE DOING A 
SHAM INVESTIGATION. CERTAINLY 

06:45:57.764 --> 06:46:01.616
THAT IS CASE CLOSED. UNLESS THE 
PRESIDENT TOLD EVERYONE I WILL 

06:46:01.830 --> 06:46:04.262
TELL YOU NOW. AND I WILL TELL 
YOU NOW. HE DID NOT TELL 

06:46:05.026 --> 06:46:08.929
EVERYONE. I GUESS IT IS CASE 
CLOSED. DO YOU KNOW WHO THE 

06:46:09.143 --> 06:46:15.229
PRESIDENT TO TELL? AMONG OTHERS.
HE TOLD MICK MULVANEY. MICK 

06:46:15.442 --> 06:46:17.260
MULVANEY WENT ON NATIONAL 
TELEVISION AND SAID YES, THEY 

06:46:17.261 --> 06:46:22.343
DISCUSSED IT. THIS 
INVESTIGATION, THIS RUSSIAN 

06:46:23.101 --> 06:46:28.382
NARRATIVE. IT WAS NOT UKRAINE 
THAT INTERVENED IN 2016. IT WAS 

06:46:28.530 --> 06:46:31.208
RUSSIA. I'M SORRY, WAS NOT 
RUSSIA, IT WAS UKRAINE. THAT 

06:46:31.353 --> 06:46:36.917
BOGUS 2016 THREE. YES THEY 
DISCUSSED IT. AND WENT REPORTER 

06:46:37.063 --> 06:46:40.823
SAID, YOU JUST DESCRIBED QUID 
PRO QUO. HIS ANSWER WAS, YES. 

06:46:41.026 --> 06:46:48.343
GET USED TO IT. GET OVER IT. WE 
DO IT ALL THE TIME. NOW, THEY 

06:46:48.542 --> 06:46:50.777
HAVE NOT THAT THEY WANT TO HEAR 
FROM MICK MULVANEY. I WONDER 

06:46:50.976 --> 06:46:54.842
WHY. THE PRESIDENT DID SPEAK TO 
MICK MULVANEY ABOUT IT. WOULD 

06:46:55.043 --> 06:46:59.722
YOU LIKE TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO 
SAY? IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE 

06:46:59.923 --> 06:47:02.972
BOTTOM OF IT, IF THERE REALLY 
CHALLENGING THE FACTS THAT THE 

06:47:03.173 --> 06:47:05.010
PRESIDENT CONDITIONED $400 
MILLION IN MILITARY AID FROM AN 

06:47:05.011 --> 06:47:08.853
ALLY AT WAR, IF MICK MULVANEY 
HAS ALREADY SAID PUBLICLY THAT 

06:47:09.054 --> 06:47:12.253
HE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT
IT AND IS PART OF THE REASON 

06:47:12.398 --> 06:47:16.368
WHY, DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD 
HEAR FROM HIM? DON'T YOU THINK 

06:47:16.984 --> 06:47:22.064
IMPARTIAL JUSTICE REQUIRES YOU 
TO HEAR FROM HIM? NOW, COUNSEL 

06:47:22.267 --> 06:47:25.057
ALSO REFERRED TO AMBASSADOR 
GORDON SONDLAND 

06:47:29.177 --> 06:47:32.627
SAYING WELL, THE PRESIDENT, 
THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO.  AT 

06:47:32.827 --> 06:47:35.060
THE TIME, HE SAID TO AMBASSADOR 
GORDON SONDLAND, NO QUID PRO QUO

06:47:35.675 --> 06:47:37.849
. AND HE BECAME AWARE OF THE 
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT. 

06:47:37.994 --> 06:47:41.490
REASONABLY, BY IS BACKED UP 
ALONE. 

06:47:44.606 --> 06:47:47.455
THE PRESIDENT KNEW IT WOULD COME
TO LIGHT. ON THE ADVICE 

06:47:48.405 --> 06:47:50.405
APPARENTLY OF

06:47:52.122 --> 06:47:54.122
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE. 

06:47:56.585 --> 06:47:58.585
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, 
THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT WAS 

06:47:58.616 --> 06:48:01.666
WITHHELD FROM CONGRESS. 
NONETHELESS, THE WHITE HOUSE WAS

06:48:01.867 --> 06:48:08.581
AWARE OF THE COMPLAINT. YES, 
THEY GOT CAUGHT. IN THE MIDST OF

06:48:08.781 --> 06:48:12.846
BEING CAUGHT, WHAT DID HE SAY? A
FALSE EXCULPATORY A FANCY WAY OF

06:48:13.047 --> 06:48:17.101
SAYING IT IS A PHONY ALIBI. NO 
QUID PRO QUO. HE WAS ASKED THE 

06:48:17.852 --> 06:48:24.415
QUESTION. HE JUST BLURTED IT 
OUT. THAT IS THE DEFENSE? THE 

06:48:24.617 --> 06:48:29.500
PRESIDENT DENIES IT? AND WHAT IS
MORE INTERESTING HE DID NOT TELL

06:48:29.699 --> 06:48:31.732
YOU ABOUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE 
CONVERSATION. WITH THE PRESIDENT

06:48:31.932 --> 06:48:34.580
SAYS NO QUID PRO QUO. HE SAID NO
QUID PRO QUO,  BUT VOLODYMYR 

06:48:35.340 --> 06:48:39.046
ZELENSKY  NEEDS TO GO TO THE 
MICROPHONE. AND HE SHOULD WANT 

06:48:39.246 --> 06:48:42.294
TO DO IT. WHICH IS THE 
EQUIVALENT OF SAYING, NO QUID 

06:48:42.695 --> 06:48:45.442
PRO QUO EXCEPT A QUID PRO QUO

06:48:48.991 --> 06:48:51.873
. AND HERE IS WHAT THE QUID PRO 
QUO IS. HE SHOULD GO TO THE 

06:48:52.041 --> 06:48:54.381
FRONT AND WANT TO DO IT. THAT IS
THERE ALIBI?

06:48:59.969 --> 06:49:02.402
AND HE DID NOT MENTION, AND YOU 
WILL HEAR ABOUT IT DURING THE 

06:49:02.603 --> 06:49:04.835
TRIAL, IF WE HAVE A REAL TRIAL. 
AND  AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND 

06:49:05.583 --> 06:49:10.329
SAID,  WE ARE OFTEN ASKED WAS 
THERE QUID PRO QUO? THE ANSWER 

06:49:10.531 --> 06:49:14.597
IS YES, THERE WAS A QUID PRO 
QUO. THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE QUID 

06:49:14.798 --> 06:49:18.402
PRO QUO. WHAT'S MORE, LIKE INTO 
THE MILITARY AID, IT WAS A 

06:49:18.553 --> 06:49:25.558
SIMPLE TWO PLUS TWO. I WILL TELL
YOU SOMETHING, WE ARE NOT THE 

06:49:25.768 --> 06:49:27.991
ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN ADD TWO PLUS
TWO. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 

06:49:28.206 --> 06:49:31.043
PEOPLE WATCHING THIS WHO CAN ADD
TWO PLUS TWO ALSO. WITH THE 

06:49:31.253 --> 06:49:34.024
PRESIDENT TELLS HIS CHIEF OF 
STAFF ROLLING OUT AID BECAUSE OF

06:49:34.174 --> 06:49:38.007
THIS, AS THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
ADMITTED, WITH THE PRESIDENT HAS

06:49:38.711 --> 06:49:44.249
NO PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR 
HOLDING UP EIGHT, THAT WE ALL 

06:49:44.462 --> 06:49:48.100
SUPPORTED AND VOTED ON IN A 
BIPARTISAN WAY. HE HAS NO 

06:49:48.314 --> 06:49:53.391
EXPLANATION FOR IT. IN THE CALL 
HE NEVER BRINGS UP CORRUPTION, 

06:49:53.793 --> 06:49:58.215
IT DOES NOT TAKE A GENIUS. IT 
DOES NOT TO@TO ADD TWO PLUS TWO.

06:49:59.689 --> 06:50:01.864
IT EQUALS 4. IN THIS CASE, IT 
EQUALS GUILT. 

06:50:05.530 --> 06:50:14.515
NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 16 
HOURS TO ASK QUESTIONS. THAT IS 

06:50:14.722 --> 06:50:22.232
A LONG TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS. 
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO 

06:50:22.436 --> 06:50:27.516
ASK ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE 
60 HOURS? 16 HOURS. WHEN YOU 

06:50:27.716 --> 06:50:32.183
WANT TO SAY TO THE COUNSEL FOR 
THE PRESIDENT, WHAT DID MICK 

06:50:32.945 --> 06:50:36.653
MULVANEY MEAN WHEN HE CAME OUT 
SO AND SO IS AT SUCH AND SUCH? 

06:50:36.854 --> 06:50:38.883
WHAT IS YOUR EXPEDITION FOR 
THAT? THAT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY 

06:50:39.502 --> 06:50:43.566
DAMNING EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY WITH
THE HOUSE THE SAYING. WHAT IS 

06:50:44.318 --> 06:50:46.318
YOUR EXPEDITION

06:50:47.627 --> 06:50:50.261
? WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO 
ASK ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS. OR ASK 

06:50:50.461 --> 06:50:55.895
MR. ADAM SCHIFF, WHAT ABOUT THIS
TEXT MESSAGE? DOESN'T THAT 

06:50:56.034 --> 06:50:59.808
SUGGEST THAT IS WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS ARGUING? WOULD YOU 

06:51:00.010 --> 06:51:02.458
LIKE TO ASK ME THAT QUESTION? I 
THINK YOU WOULD. I THINK YOU 

06:51:03.220 --> 06:51:05.220
SHOULD. 

06:51:08.743 --> 06:51:10.976
THE BACKWARDS WAY THE RESOLUTION
IS DRAFTED, YOU GET 16 HOURS TO 

06:51:11.190 --> 06:51:13.626
ASK WHAT DOCTORS YOU HAVE NEVER 
SEEN. TO KNOW WHAT IS MORE? IF 

06:51:13.826 --> 06:51:17.074
YOU DO DECIDE AT THAT POINT, 
AFTER IT IS OVER THAT YOU DO 

06:51:17.277 --> 06:51:21.092
WANT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS AFTER 
ALL, AND THE DOCTORS ARE 

06:51:21.244 --> 06:51:24.992
PRODUCED, YOU DO NOT GET ANOTHER
16 HOURS. YOU DO NOT GET 16 

06:51:25.742 --> 06:51:30.635
MINUTES. YOU DO NOT GET 16 
SECONDS TO ASK. DESIGN ME SINCE 

06:51:30.785 --> 06:51:37.587
YOU? DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE AT 
ALL? I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING I

06:51:37.801 --> 06:51:43.683
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. IT MAY BE IN
THE DOCUMENTS. YOU HAVE PROBABLY

06:51:43.885 --> 06:51:49.164
HEARD ABOUT THE THREE AMIGOS. MY
COLLEAGUES MENTIONED TWO OF THE 

06:51:49.380 --> 06:51:54.458
THREE AMIGOS. AMIGO FOLK LORE 
AND AMIGO SONDLAND. THESE ARE 

06:51:54.658 --> 06:51:57.228
TWO OF THE THREE PEOPLE THE 
PRESIDENT BUT CHARGE OF UKRAINE 

06:51:57.380 --> 06:52:04.407
PUZZLED, THE FORMER SECRETARY OF
ENERGY, RICK PERRY IS THE THIRD.

06:52:04.607 --> 06:52:08.673
WE KNOW THAT AMIGO AMBASSADOR 
GORDON SONDLAND WAS IN THE LOOP 

06:52:09.074 --> 06:52:15.740
. AND WE KNOW FROM THE TESTIMONY
OF MASTER VOLKER

06:52:20.456 --> 06:52:22.476
AND WHATSAPP, HE WAS IN THE 
LOOP. WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD 

06:52:22.694 --> 06:52:26.652
AMIGO? WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW IF
THE THIRD AMIGO WAS IN THE LOOP?

06:52:28.170 --> 06:52:32.234
AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPLAINED,
AND WE WILL GO TO THE THE PERMIT

06:52:32.437 --> 06:52:36.045
OF ENERGY RECORDS, SURPRISINGLY,
WE DO NOT GET THOSE EITHER. 

06:52:40.565 --> 06:52:42.383
ANY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OF THE 

06:52:42.384 --> 06:52:46.050
DEPARTMENT ESTATE IS COVERED BY 
THIS AMENDMENT. THAT YOU THINK 

06:52:46.812 --> 06:52:48.812
THE DEPARTMENT

06:52:51.934 --> 06:52:54.367
AND IN AND PEOPLE DESERVE TO 
KNOW WITH A THIRD AMIGO NEW? I 

06:52:54.581 --> 06:52:56.581
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. 

06:52:58.847 --> 06:53:04.531
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
ASK IN YOUR 16 HOURS. AT THE END

06:53:04.732 --> 06:53:11.843
OF THE DAY, I GUESS I WILL 
FINISH WITH SOMETHING MR. 

06:53:12.243 --> 06:53:16.924
SEKULOW SAID. IT IS A DANGEROUS 
MOMENT. BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO

06:53:17.685 --> 06:53:25.252
RUSH THROUGH THIS SOMEHOW. IT IS
A DANGEROUS MOMENT. WE ARE NOT 

06:53:25.454 --> 06:53:28.701
TRY TO RUSH THROUGH THIS TRIAL. 
WE TRY TO HAVE A REAL TRIAL 

06:53:29.470 --> 06:53:34.383
HERE. IS THE PRESIDENT THAT IS 
TRY TO RUSH THROUGH THIS. I HAVE

06:53:34.597 --> 06:53:41.240
TO TELL YOU, WHATEVER YOU DECIDE
HERE MAYBE IT WAS A WASTE OF 

06:53:41.386 --> 06:53:44.340
BREATH AND MAYBE IT IS ALREADY 
DECIDED. WHATEVER YOU DECIDE I 

06:53:44.543 --> 06:53:47.592
DO NOT TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
WILL BE. MAYBE TO SOMEONE IN 

06:53:48.205 --> 06:53:52.819
THIS CHAMBER. I GUARANTEE YOU 
THIS. WHOEVER THE NEXT PRESIDENT

06:53:53.008 --> 06:53:57.752
IS, WHETHER THEY DID SOMETHING 
RIGHT OR WRONG, THERE IS GOING 

06:53:57.973 --> 06:54:02.418

THAT PRESIDENT AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION. YOU WILL WANT TO

06:54:07.901 --> 06:54:13.340
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF SERIOUS 
ALLEGATIONS. ARE YOU PREPARED TO

06:54:13.527 --> 06:54:19.081
SAY THAT PRESIDENT CAN SIMPLY 
SAY I WILL FIGHT ALL SUBPOENAS? 

06:54:19.284 --> 06:54:24.961
ARE YOU PREPARED TO SAY AND 
EXCEPT THE PRESIDENT TO SAY HAVE

06:54:25.712 --> 06:54:29.842

YOU CANNOT SEE ME IN COURT. 

06:54:43.655 --> 06:54:46.444
ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT? THAT 
IS WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. 

06:54:48.117 --> 06:54:50.965
DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE LAST 
PRESIDENT, IF YOU ALLOW THIS TO 

06:54:51.167 --> 06:54:52.797
HAPPEN, THAT WILL ALLOW THIS TO 
TAKE PLACE.

07:09:06.493 --> 07:09:09.391
PRESIDENT. MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, 
SENATORS, COUNSEL TO THE 

07:09:09.592 --> 07:09:14.470
PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, I'M JASON CROW FOR THE 

07:09:14.669 --> 07:09:18.935
GREAT STATE OF COLORADO. THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS STRONGLY SUPPORT 

07:09:19.137 --> 07:09:21.785
THE AMENDMENT TO SUBPOENA KEY 
DOCUMENTS FROM THE OFFICE OF 

07:09:21.986 --> 07:09:28.284
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET FOR OMB. 
THIS DOCUMENT GO DIRECTLY TO ONE

07:09:28.483 --> 07:09:33.963
OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS ABUSES OF 
POWER. HIS DECISION TO WITHHOLD 

07:09:34.177 --> 07:09:39.548
VITAL MILITARY AID FROM A 
STRATEGIC PARTNER THAT IS AT WAR

07:09:41.895 --> 07:09:46.165
TO BENEFIT HIS OWN PERSONAL 
REELECTION CAMPAIGN. WHY SHOULD 

07:09:46.917 --> 07:09:52.565
THAT MATTER? WHY SHOULD ANYBODY 
CARE? WHY SHOULD I CARE?

07:09:56.921 --> 07:10:00.170
BEFORE I WAS A MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS, I WAS AN AMERICAN 

07:10:00.933 --> 07:10:06.881
SOLDIER. SERVING IN IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN. AND ALTHOUGH SOME 

07:10:07.082 --> 07:10:12.699
YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT 
TIME, THERE ARE STILL SOME 

07:10:12.837 --> 07:10:20.015
MEMORIES THAT ARE SEARED INTO MY
BRAIN. ONE OF THOSE MEMORIES WAS

07:10:20.162 --> 07:10:24.340
SCAVENGING SCRAP METAL IN THE 
STREETS OF BAGHDAD IN THE SUMMER

07:10:24.541 --> 07:10:31.854
OF 2003. THAT WE HAD TO BOLT 
ONTO THE SIDE OF OUR TRUCKS. 

07:10:32.070 --> 07:10:34.639
BECAUSE WE HAD NO ARMOR TO 
PROTECT AGAINST ROADSIDE BOMBS. 

07:10:36.935 --> 07:10:41.552
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TROOPS NOT 
GETTING THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY 

07:10:41.704 --> 07:10:51.563
NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT, IT IS 
PERSONAL TO ME. TO BE CLEAR, 

07:10:51.963 --> 07:10:55.776
HERE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $391 
MILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY. 

07:10:57.043 --> 07:11:02.326
INTENDED TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL
SECURITY, I HELPING OUR 

07:11:02.526 --> 07:11:09.236
STRATEGIC PARTNER, UKRAINE FIGHT
AGAINST BRITAIN MAX RUSSIA, AN 

07:11:09.436 --> 07:11:12.887
ADVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN. THE PRESIDENT 

07:11:13.089 --> 07:11:18.984
CANNOT CARRY OUT THIS SCHEME 
ALONE. HE NEEDED A LOT OF PEOPLE

07:11:19.185 --> 07:11:24.826
TO HELP. AND THAT IS WHY WE KNOW
AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS WE DO TODAY.

07:11:25.895 --> 07:11:31.715
BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO KNOW. 
AND THAT IS WHAT TRIALS ARE FOR.

07:11:32.797 --> 07:11:40.511
TO GET THE FULL PICTURE. WE KNOW
THERE IS MORE BECAUSE PRESIDENT 

07:11:40.729 --> 07:11:42.729
TRUMP NEEDED THE OFFICE OF 
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET TO FIGURE 

07:11:42.757 --> 07:11:48.028
OUT HOW TO STOP WHAT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN RIGHT RELEASE OF FUNDS 

07:11:48.442 --> 07:11:53.110
MANDATED BY CONGRESS. A RELEASE 
OF FUNDS THAT WAS ALREADY 

07:11:53.869 --> 07:11:55.869
UNDERWAY. 

07:11:57.986 --> 07:12:00.982
THE PEOPLE IN THIS CHAMBER DO 
NOT NEED ME TO TELL YOU THAT. 

07:12:02.056 --> 07:12:07.538
BECAUSE 87 OF YOU IN THIS ROOM 
VOTED FOR VITAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT

07:12:07.737 --> 07:12:11.546
OUR VITAL PARTNER, UKRAINE. 
WITNESSES BEFORE THE HOUSE 

07:12:11.696 --> 07:12:16.066
TESTIFIED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT 
OWNBY'S INVOLVEMENT IN CARRYING 

07:12:16.267 --> 07:12:20.423
IT OUT. IT WAS OMB

07:12:24.184 --> 07:12:25.615
THAT RELATE THE PRESIDENT'S 
INSTRUCTIONS IMPLEMENTED THE 

07:12:25.616 --> 07:12:34.271
WHOLE THING. WAS OWNBY THAT 
SCRIBBLED TO JUSTIFY IT. OMB HAS

07:12:35.099 --> 07:12:39.019
KEY DOCUMENTS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS REFUSED TO TURN OVER 

07:12:39.216 --> 07:12:44.040
TO CONGRESS. IT IS TIME TO 
SUBPOENA THOSE ARGUMENTS. 

07:12:49.783 --> 07:12:51.783
THESE DOCUMENTS WOULD PROVIDE 
INSIGHT INTO CRITICAL ASPECTS OF

07:12:52.170 --> 07:12:56.896
THE MILITARY. IT WOULD SHOW THE 
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THE 

07:12:57.650 --> 07:13:01.562
MOTIVATION BEHIND PRESIDENT 
TRUMPS FREEZE. IT WOULD REVEAL 

07:13:01.763 --> 07:13:06.549
THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY CAREER
OMB OFFICIALS, INCLUDING LAWYERS

07:13:10.911 --> 07:13:13.346
AND VIOLATED THE LAW. IT WOULD 
EXPOSE THE LINKS AND THE LINKS 

07:13:13.546 --> 07:13:19.442
OMB  WENT TO JUSTIFY THE WHOLE. 
IT WOULD REVEAL CONCERNS ABOUT 

07:13:19.644 --> 07:13:23.294
THE IMPACT OF THE FREEZE ON 
UKRAINE AND U. S. NATIONAL 

07:13:23.509 --> 07:13:27.095
SECURITY. AND IT WOULD SHOW THAT
SENIOR OFFICIALS REPEATEDLY

07:13:32.442 --> 07:13:35.889
APPEALED TO PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKY  RELEASE THE HOLD. IN 

07:13:36.090 --> 07:13:39.101
SHORT, IT WOULD SHOW EXACTLY HOW
THE PRESIDENT CARRIED OUT THE 

07:13:39.254 --> 07:13:43.001
SCHEME TO USE OUR NATIONAL 
DEFENSE FUNDS TO BENEFIT HIS 

07:13:43.206 --> 07:13:50.715
PERSONAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. WE 
ARE NOT SPECULATING ABOUT THE 

07:13:50.930 --> 07:13:52.962
EXISTENCE OF THIS DOCUMENT. WE 
ARE NOT GUESSING ABOUT WITH THE 

07:13:53.161 --> 07:13:55.194
DOCUMENTS WHICH SHOW. DURING THE
COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION IN 

07:13:55.955 --> 07:13:59.862
THE HOUSE, WITNESSES, WHO 
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE COMMITTEES,

07:14:00.263 --> 07:14:02.263
IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS, 
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE 

07:14:02.655 --> 07:14:07.312
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THAT THE OMB
CONTINUES TO HOLD TO THE STATE. 

07:14:08.194 --> 07:14:13.875
WE KNOW THESE DOCUMENTS EXIST. 
AND WE KNOW THE ONLY REASON WE 

07:14:14.075 --> 07:14:18.139
DO NOT HAVE THEM IS BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT DIRECTED OMB NOT TO 

07:14:18.340 --> 07:14:23.979
PRODUCE THEM. BECAUSE HE KNOWS 
WHAT THEY WOULD SHOW. 

07:14:27.888 --> 07:14:29.921
TO  DEMONSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE OMB DOCUMENTS AND THE 

07:14:30.121 --> 07:14:32.566
VALUE THEY WOULD PROVIDE INTO 
THE  TRIAL, I WANT TO WALK YOU 

07:14:32.767 --> 07:14:34.999
THROUGH SOME OF WHAT WE KNOW 
EXISTS. FOR WHICH THE TRUMP 

07:14:35.201 --> 07:14:40.694
ADMINISTRATION HAS REFUSED TO 
TURN OVER. AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED,

07:14:40.896 --> 07:14:42.726
THE TOP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
REFUSED TO TURN OVER ANY 

07:14:42.727 --> 07:14:45.161
DOCUMENTS TO THE HOUSE IN 
RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE SUBPOENAS 

07:14:45.511 --> 07:14:47.511
AND REQUESTS. 

07:14:49.227 --> 07:14:51.458
BASED ON WHAT IS KNOWN FROM THE 
TESTIMONY AND THE FEW DOCUMENTS 

07:14:51.661 --> 07:14:55.112
THAT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED THROUGH 
PUBLIC REPORTING, IT IS CLEAR 

07:14:55.312 --> 07:14:58.975
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO 
HIDE THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE HE IS 

07:14:59.175 --> 07:15:04.054
AFRAID OF WHAT IT WOULD SHOW. 
THE DOCUMENTS OFFER STARK 

07:15:04.257 --> 07:15:07.505
EXAMPLES OF THE CHAOS AND 
CONFUSION THAT THE PRESIDENT 

07:15:07.706 --> 07:15:12.782
SCHEME SET OFF ACROSS OUR 
GOVERNMENT. AND MAKE CLEAR THE 

07:15:12.985 --> 07:15:14.985
IMPORTANCE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT
ARE BEING CONCEALED BY THE 

07:15:15.576 --> 07:15:19.894
PRESIDENT. WE KNOW THAT OMB HAS 
DOCUMENTS THAT REVEAL AS EARLY 

07:15:20.657 --> 07:15:23.346
AS JUNE THE PRESIDENT WAS 
CONSIDERING HOLDING MOTOR AID TO

07:15:24.106 --> 07:15:31.878
UKRAINE. THE PRESIDENT AGAIN 
QUESTIONING MILITARY AID TO 

07:15:32.078 --> 07:15:34.056
UKRAINE AFTER CONGRESS 
APPROPRIATED AND AUTHORIZED THE 

07:15:34.057 --> 07:15:40.811
MONEY. 250 MILLION IN DOD FUNDS.
AND $141 MILLION IN STATE 

07:15:41.012 --> 07:15:47.467
DEPARTMENT FUNDS. THIS FUNDING 
HAD WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 

07:15:47.613 --> 07:15:51.988
BECAUSE AS MANY WITNESSES 
TESTIFIED, PROVIDING MILITARY 

07:15:52.190 --> 07:15:57.876
AID TO UKRAINE TO DEFEND ITSELF 
AGAINST RUSSIAN AGGRESSION ALSO 

07:15:58.289 --> 07:16:01.938
BENEFITS OUR OWN NATIONAL 
SECURITY. IMPORTANTLY, THE 

07:16:02.139 --> 07:16:06.821
PRESIDENT'S QUESTIONS CAME WEEKS
AFTER THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 

07:16:07.023 --> 07:16:08.944
ALREADY CERTIFIED THAT UKRAINE 
HAD UNDERTAKEN ANTICORRUPTION 

07:16:08.945 --> 07:16:16.367
REFORMS AND OTHER MEASURES 
MANDATED BY CONGRESS AS A 

07:16:16.568 --> 07:16:19.403
CONDITION FOR RECEIVING AID. 
THERE IS A PROCESS FOR MAKING 

07:16:19.618 --> 07:16:22.855
SURE THE FUNDS MAKE IT TO THE 
RIGHT PLACE AND TO THE RIGHT 

07:16:23.604 --> 07:16:27.135
PEOPLE. THE PROCESS HAS BEEN 
FOLLOWED EVERY YEAR THAT WE HAVE

07:16:27.905 --> 07:16:31.194
BEEN PROVIDING SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE. INCLUDING

07:16:31.396 --> 07:16:35.248
THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION. NONETHELESS, THE

07:16:35.995 --> 07:16:40.731
PRESIDENT QUESTIONS DAYS AFTER 
DOD ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE. ON 

07:16:40.947 --> 07:16:46.576
JUNE 18, ANNOUNCING IT WOULD 
PROVIDE 250 MILLION TO MILITARY 

07:16:46.723 --> 07:16:52.111
AID TO THE GREAT. ACCORDING TO 
PUBLIC REPORTING, THE DAY AFTER 

07:16:52.512 --> 07:16:56.323
DOD'S PRESS RELEASE, A WHITE 
HOUSE OFFICIAL AND ROBERT BLAIR 

07:16:56.469 --> 07:17:01.664
CALLED OMB ACTING DIRECTOR TO 
TALK ABOUT MILITARY AID TO 

07:17:02.422 --> 07:17:06.738
UKRAINE. ACCORDING TO PUBLIC 
REPORTS, MR. BLAIR SAID "WE NEED

07:17:06.938 --> 07:17:12.667
TO HOLD IT UP. ". OMB HAS 
REFUSED TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS 

07:17:12.834 --> 07:17:17.511
RELATED TO THIS CONVERSATION. 
THE SENATE CAN GET THEM BY 

07:17:17.706 --> 07:17:22.168
PASSING THE AMENDMENT AND 
ISSUING A SUBPOENA. THERE IS 

07:17:22.933 --> 07:17:30.699
MORE. THE SAME DAY BLAIR TOLD 
HIM TO HOLD UP THE AID,  MICHAEL

07:17:30.913 --> 07:17:35.477
DUFFEY, A POLITICAL APPOINTEE AT
OMB  WHO REPORTS TO RUSSELL BOYD

07:17:36.196 --> 07:17:40.663
SENT AN EMAIL AND SAID THE 
PRESIDENT HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT 

07:17:40.862 --> 07:17:46.909
THE AID. DUFFY  COPIED MARK 
SANDY, A CAREER OFFICIAL AT OMB 

07:17:47.052 --> 07:17:51.429
, WHO TOLD US ABOUT AN EMAIL IN 
HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HOUSE. 

07:17:51.630 --> 07:17:54.843
IN OTHERS, THE EMAIL IS NOT 
PRODUCED BY THE TRUMP 

07:17:54.990 --> 07:17:59.547
ADMINISTRATION AND THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION. WE 

07:17:59.746 --> 07:18:02.599
KNOW THE EMAIL EXISTS HOWEVER, 
BECAUSE IN RESPONSE TO A FREEDOM

07:18:03.354 --> 07:18:06.460
OF INFORMATION LAWSUIT, THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD TO 

07:18:06.661 --> 07:18:09.046
RELEASE A REDACTED EMAIL, 
CONSISTENT WITH THE DECEPTION. 

07:18:10.462 --> 07:18:15.589
OMB PROVIDED NONE OF THE 
DOCUMENTS TO THE HOUSE. WITH 

07:18:15.806 --> 07:18:17.622
THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT, THE 
SENATE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

07:18:17.623 --> 07:18:20.471
OBTAIN AND REVIEW THE FULL 
RECORD THAT FURTHER DEMONSTRATE 

07:18:20.672 --> 07:18:24.074
HOW AND WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS 
WITHHOLDING AID . 

07:18:27.585 --> 07:18:31.238
THESE DOCUMENTS WOULD ALSO SHED 
LIGHT ON THE PRESIDENT ORDER TO 

07:18:31.438 --> 07:18:36.107
IMPLEMENT THE HOLD. ON JULY 3, 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TOLD 

07:18:36.320 --> 07:18:40.172
VARIOUS OFFICIALS THAT OMB  
BLOCKED IT FROM DISPENSING $141 

07:18:40.371 --> 07:18:46.673
MILLION OF AID. OMB DIRECTED THE
STATE DEPARTMENT NOT TO SEND A 

07:18:46.874 --> 07:18:50.481
NOTE VACATION TO CONGRESS ABOUT 
SPENDING THE MONEY. WITHOUT THE 

07:18:50.631 --> 07:18:56.156
NOTIFICATION THAT AID WAS 
EFFECTIVELY BLOCKED. WHY DID OMB

07:18:56.303 --> 07:19:01.102
LOCK CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION?
WHO TOLD HIM TO DO IT. WHAT WAS 

07:19:01.868 --> 07:19:07.805
THE REASON. THE SENATE WOULD GET
THOSE ANSWERS IF IT ISSUED THE 

07:19:08.561 --> 07:19:15.450
SUBPOENA. BUT THERE IS MORE. ON 
JULY 12, BLAIR, THE WHITE HOUSE 

07:19:15.602 --> 07:19:21.411
OFFICIAL WHO CALLED AND SAID "WE
NEED TO HOLD IT UP," AND SENT AN

07:19:21.611 --> 07:19:24.349
EMAIL TO DUFFY AT OMB . BLAIR 
SAID, "

07:19:27.507 --> 07:19:29.507
THE PRESIDENT IS DIRECTING A 
HOLD ON MILITARY SUPPORT FUNDING

07:19:29.539 --> 07:19:32.535
FOR UKRAINE. " WE HAVE NOT SEEN 
THIS EMAIL. 

07:19:36.238 --> 07:19:38.670
THE ONLY REASON WE KNOW ABOUT IT
IS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF MARK 

07:19:38.871 --> 07:19:41.877
SANDY. THE CAREER OMB OFFICIAL 
WHO COMPLIED WITH HIS SUBPOENA. 

07:19:43.137 --> 07:19:46.603
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 
TRANSCRIPT EXCERPT AND FOR YOU, 

07:19:47.362 --> 07:19:52.083
SANDY TESTIFIED THE JULY TWELFTH
EMAIL DID NOT MENTION CONCERNS 

07:19:52.282 --> 07:19:56.298
ABOUT ANY OTHER COUNTRY OR ANY 
OTHER AID PACKAGE. JUST UKRAINE.

07:20:00.010 --> 07:20:03.258
THE DOZENS OF COUNTRIES WE 
PROVIDE AID AND SUPPORT TO, THE 

07:20:03.458 --> 07:20:05.829
PRESIDENT WAS NOT CONCERNED 
ABOUT ANY OF THEM. 

07:20:09.105 --> 07:20:11.105
WHY?

07:20:15.238 --> 07:20:17.238
WE KNOW WHY

07:20:20.521 --> 07:20:22.756
OMB HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE A 
COPY OF THE JULY TWELFTH EMAIL 

07:20:22.957 --> 07:20:24.957
PROGRAM IS REFUSED TO PROVIDE  
DOCUMENT SURROUNDING IT ALL 

07:20:24.989 --> 07:20:27.020
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TOLD OMB 
TO CONTINUE TO HIDE THE TRUTH 

07:20:27.219 --> 07:20:32.704
FROM CONGRESS  AND THE MARKET 
PEOPLE. WAS HE AFRAID OF. A 

07:20:33.464 --> 07:20:40.420
SUBPOENA ISSUED IN THE SENATE 
WOULD SHOW US. OMB HAS RENTS 

07:20:40.621 --> 07:20:43.566
ABOUT A KEY SERIES OF MENUS 
DOUGLAS BY THE PRESIDENT

07:20:48.554 --> 07:20:50.986
TO WITHHOLD E AID. IN THE SECOND
HALF OF JULY, THE NATIONALS GO 

07:20:51.186 --> 07:20:53.219
TO COUNCIL CONVENED A SERIES OF 
INTERAGENCY MEETINGS  ABOUT THE 

07:20:53.420 --> 07:20:55.653
PRESIDENT TOLD A MILITARY AID. 
OMB DOCUMENTS TO SHOW WHAT 

07:20:55.867 --> 07:21:01.950
HAPPENED DURING THOSE MEETINGS. 
FOR EXAMPLE, ON JULY 18 THE 

07:21:02.701 --> 07:21:06.431
NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF CONVENED
AN INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE TO 

07:21:06.631 --> 07:21:09.576
DISCUSS UKRAINE POLICY. DURING  
THE MEETING, IT WAS OMB  

07:21:10.439 --> 07:21:14.148
REPRESENTATIVE WHO ANNOUNCED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PLACED A HOLD ON

07:21:14.347 --> 07:21:19.626
ALL MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE. 
AMBASSADOR BILL TAYLOR, THE MOST

07:21:19.827 --> 07:21:24.706
SENIOR, TO UKRAINE PARTICIPATED 
IN THE MEETING. AND HE DESCRIBED

07:21:25.457 --> 07:21:28.116
HIS REACTION OF HIS OPEN 
HEARING. 

07:21:31.207 --> 07:21:33.207
&gt;&gt; IN A REGULAR SECURE VIDEO 
CONFERENCE CALL

07:21:37.508 --> 07:21:39.738
ON JULY 18, I HEARD STAFF PERSON
FROM THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT 

07:21:39.940 --> 07:21:41.977
AND BUDGET SAY, THERE WAS A HOLD
ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO 

07:21:42.173 --> 07:21:45.062
UKRAINE. BUT CANNOT SAY WHY. FOR
THE END OF AN OTHERWISE NORMAL 

07:21:45.459 --> 07:21:48.353
MEETING, A VOICE ON THE CALL, 
PERSON OFFSCREEN SAID,

07:21:51.924 --> 07:21:54.157
SHE WAS FROM OMB. HER BOSS HAD 
INSTRUCTED HER NOT TO APPROVE 

07:21:54.357 --> 07:21:56.357
ANY ADDITIONAL SPENDING ON 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE,

07:21:56.389 --> 07:22:01.468
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. I AND 
OTHERS SAT IN ASTONISHMENT. 

07:22:01.669 --> 07:22:05.333
UKRAINIANS WERE FIGHTING 
RUSSIANS AND COUNTED ON NOT ONLY

07:22:05.532 --> 07:22:08.124
THE TRAINING AND WEAPONS, ALSO 
THE ASSURANCE OF U. S. SUPPORT. 

07:22:13.463 --> 07:22:15.898
ALL  THE OMB STOPPERS AND SAID 
WAS, THE DIRECTIVE HAD COME FROM

07:22:16.096 --> 07:22:19.702
THE PRESIDENT . THE CHIEF OF 
STAFF TO OMB . IN AN INSTANT I 

07:22:19.866 --> 07:22:23.410
REALIZED ONE OF THE KEY PILLARS 
OF OUR STRONG SUPPORT UKRAINE 

07:22:23.611 --> 07:22:28.280
WAS THREATENED. 
&gt;&gt; IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 

07:22:28.480 --> 07:22:31.262
OMB WOULD NOT HAVE ANY DOCUMENTS
FOLLOWING THE BOMBSHELL 

07:22:31.414 --> 07:22:33.496
ANNOUNCEMENT. SURELY DOES. 

07:22:37.832 --> 07:22:40.264
IT WAS AGENCY THAT DELIVERED THE
SHOCKING NEWS TO THE REST OF THE

07:22:40.477 --> 07:22:42.294
U. S. GOVERNMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS WITHHOLDING VITAL 

07:22:42.295 --> 07:22:45.760
MILITARY AID FROM OUR PARTNERS. 
AND WE WOULD SEE THESE DOCUMENTS

07:22:45.960 --> 07:22:52.457
IF THE SENATE ISSUED A SUBPOENA.
THE JULY EIGHTEENTH MEETING WAS 

07:22:52.657 --> 07:22:56.720
THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF 
MEETINGS WERE OMB HELD THE LINE 

07:22:57.670 --> 07:23:05.254
ON AID. THERE WAS A SECOND 
MEETING JULY 23,  WILL BE 

07:23:05.454 --> 07:23:07.084
UNDERSTOOD AGENCIES RAISE 
CONCERN ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF 

07:23:07.085 --> 07:23:09.519
OMB HOLD ON THE EIGHTH. AND A 
THIRD MEETING ON A SENIOR LEVEL 

07:23:09.718 --> 07:23:16.218
ON JULY 26. WITNESSES TESTIFIED 
THAT AT THAT MEETING, OMB 

07:23:16.431 --> 07:23:21.098
STRUGGLED TO OFFER  AN 
EXPLANATION FOR THE HOLD. AND A 

07:23:21.299 --> 07:23:24.915
FOURTH MEETING ON JULY 31 WITH A
LEGAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE HOLD 

07:23:25.061 --> 07:23:28.242
WERE RAISED TO EACH OF THESE 
MEETINGS THERE WAS CONFUSION 

07:23:28.613 --> 07:23:30.613
ABOUT THE SCOPE

07:23:33.693 --> 07:23:35.930
AND THE REASONS FOR THE HOLD. 
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS 

07:23:36.130 --> 07:23:40.794
GOING ON. THAT WAS EXACTLY THE 
POINT. ALL OF THE AGENCIES, 

07:23:41.009 --> 07:23:44.403
EXCEPT OMB, WHICH WAS SIMPLY A 
VEIN THE PRESIDENT ORDER, 

07:23:44.549 --> 07:23:46.622
SUPPORTING MILITARY AID AND

07:23:50.352 --> 07:23:52.917
ARGUED FOR LIFTING THE HOLD. OMB
DID NOT PRODUCE A SINGLE 

07:23:53.062 --> 07:23:55.374
DOCUMENT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION 
ABOUT IS PARTICIPATION, 

07:23:55.522 --> 07:23:57.808
PREPARATION OR FOLLOW-UP FROM 
ANY OF THESE MEETINGS. 

07:24:01.314 --> 07:24:03.346
DID  THIS OMB OFFICIALS COME 
PREPARED WITH TALKING POINTS FOR

07:24:03.546 --> 07:24:06.795
THE MEETINGS. THE  OMB OFFICIALS
TAKE NOTES  DURING ANY OF THESE 

07:24:07.545 --> 07:24:13.309
MEETINGS. DID THE EXCHANGE 
E-MAILS ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON?

07:24:14.068 --> 07:24:19.390
DID THEY DISCUSS REASONS TO GIVE
ANYONE ELSE FOR THE HOLD. BY 

07:24:19.591 --> 07:24:21.838
ISSUING THE SUBPOENA, THE SENECA
FIND OUT THE ANSWERS TO ALL OF 

07:24:22.038 --> 07:24:26.908
THE QUESTIONS AND OTHERS LIKE 
IT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE 

07:24:27.656 --> 07:24:29.656
ANSWERS. 

07:24:31.786 --> 07:24:37.070
OMB COULD REVEAL KEY FACTS ABOUT
JULY 25. ON JULY 25, PRESIDENT 

07:24:37.470 --> 07:24:40.520
TRUMP CONDUCTED HIS UNCLE WITH 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. DURING WHICH

07:24:40.721 --> 07:24:42.721
HE DEMANDED  A FAVOR. 

07:24:46.008 --> 07:24:50.274
HIS FAVOR WAS FOR UKRAINE TO 
CONDUCT AN OF EDUCATION TO 

07:24:50.472 --> 07:24:52.472
BENEFIT THE PRESIDENT'S 
REELECTION CAMPAIGN. 

07:24:57.173 --> 07:25:00.756
JUST 90 MINUTES AFTER HE HUNG UP
THE PHONE

07:25:07.737 --> 07:25:09.769
THE POLITICAL APPOINTEE TO OMB 
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF NATIONAL 

07:25:09.968 --> 07:25:11.968
SKIRTED PROGRAM, EMAIL DOD TO" 
FORMALIZE" THE HOLD ON MILITARY 

07:25:12.559 --> 07:25:18.499
AID. JUST 90 MINUTES AFTER 
PRESIDENT TRUMPS CALL CALL IN 

07:25:18.720 --> 07:25:22.163
WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAD ASKED 
FOR A FAVOR. THAT EMAIL IS ON 

07:25:22.766 --> 07:25:27.445
THE SCREEN FROM YOU. WE HAVE A 
REDACTED COPY OF THE EMAIL 

07:25:27.649 --> 07:25:30.078
PROGRAM WAS RECENTLY RELEASED 
THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF 

07:25:30.279 --> 07:25:33.530
INFORMATION ACT. IT IS NOT 
RELEASED BY THE TRUMP 

07:25:33.746 --> 07:25:36.006
ADMINISTRATION IN RESPONSE TO 
THE SUBPOENA. IN THIS EMAIL 

07:25:36.379 --> 07:25:40.243
DUFFY TOLD THE DOD OFFICIAL THAT
BE SOMEONE THAT IS HE HAD 

07:25:40.442 --> 07:25:44.096
RECEIVED A "HOLD OFF ON ANY 
ADDITIONAL DOD OBLIGATIONS OF 

07:25:44.297 --> 07:25:46.829
THESE FUNDS. "
&gt;&gt; HE ADDED

07:25:50.199 --> 07:25:52.229
, THE REQUEST WAS "SENSITIVE. " 
AND THEY SHOULD KEEP THE 

07:25:52.429 --> 07:25:56.079
INFORMATION CLOSELY HELD. 
MEANING, DO NOT TELL ANYBODY 

07:25:56.281 --> 07:25:58.281
ABOUT IT. 

07:26:00.549 --> 07:26:02.784
WHY DID DUFFY CONSIDER THE 
INFORMATION SENSITIVE? WHY 

07:26:02.983 --> 07:26:08.466
DIDN'T HE WANT ANYONE TO LEARN 
ABOUT IT? ANSWERS TO THOSE 

07:26:08.680 --> 07:26:13.508
QUESTIONS MAY BE FOUND IN OMB 
E-MAILS. E-MAILS THAT WE CAN ALL

07:26:13.650 --> 07:26:17.971
SEE IF YOU ISSUE A SUBPOENA. 
THERE IS MORE. 

07:26:21.678 --> 07:26:24.249
REMEMBER THE ADMINISTRATION 
NEEDED TO CREATE A WAY TO STOP 

07:26:24.392 --> 07:26:28.183
FUNDING THAT WAS ALREADY 
UNDERWAY. THE TRAIN HAD A READY 

07:26:28.381 --> 07:26:32.394
LEFT THE STATION. SOMETHING LIKE
THIS HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

07:26:33.260 --> 07:26:40.782
LATER IN THE EVENING OF JULY 25,
OMB FOUND A WAY. EVEN THOUGH DOD

07:26:40.974 --> 07:26:43.409
HAD ALREADY NOTIFIED CONGRESS 
THAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE 

07:26:44.169 --> 07:26:52.300
RELEASED. HERE IS HOW THE SCHEME
WORKS. OMB SENT DOD A FUNDING 

07:26:52.442 --> 07:26:55.390
DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDED A 
CAREFULLY WORDED FOOTNOTE, 

07:26:55.606 --> 07:27:01.893
DIRECTING DOD TO HOLD OFF ON 
SPENDING THE FUNDS. "TO ALLOW 

07:27:02.090 --> 07:27:06.368
FOR AN INTERAGENCY PROCESS TO 
DETERMINE THE BEST USE. " 

07:27:06.771 --> 07:27:08.771
REMEMBER THAT LANGUAGE. 

07:27:11.234 --> 07:27:14.485
TO ALLOW FOR AN INTERAGENCY 
PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE BEST 

07:27:14.687 --> 07:27:21.141
USE. LET ME EXPLAIN THAT THE 
FOOTNOTE SEATED, THAT THIS BRIEF

07:27:21.294 --> 07:27:27.281
PAUSE WOULD NOT PREVENT DOD FROM
SPENDING THE MONEY BY THE END OF

07:27:27.481 --> 07:27:29.929
THE FISCAL YEAR. WHICH IS COMING
UP SEPTEMBER 30. OMB HAD TO DO 

07:27:30.129 --> 07:27:35.343
THIS BECAUSE IT KNEW THAT NOT 
SPENDING THE MONEY WAS ILLEGAL. 

07:27:35.812 --> 07:27:40.289
THEY KNEW THAT DOD WOULD BE 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT. AND THEY 

07:27:40.491 --> 07:27:43.482
WERE CORRECT. DOD WAS WORRIED 
ABOUT IT. 

07:27:47.602 --> 07:27:50.037
MR. SANDY TESTIFIED THAT IN THE 
12 YEARS OF EXPENSE AND OMB, HE 

07:27:50.798 --> 07:27:54.913
COULD RECALL THAT I CANNOT 
RECALL ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER 

07:27:55.114 --> 07:27:58.980
HAPPENING BEFORE. THE DRAFTING 
OF THE UNUSUAL FUNDING DOCUMENT 

07:27:59.179 --> 07:28:02.229
AND ISSUANCE OF THE DOCUMENT 
MUST HAVE GENERATED A 

07:28:02.432 --> 07:28:05.266
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EMAIL 
TRAFFIC,  MEMOS AND OTHER 

07:28:05.479 --> 07:28:10.814
DOCUMENTATION AT OMB . MEMOS, 
EMAIL TRAFFIC AND DOCUMENTATION 

07:28:10.962 --> 07:28:17.456
THAT WE WOULD ALL SEE IF THE 
SENATE ISSUED A SUBPOENA. WHAT 

07:28:18.217 --> 07:28:23.557
WAS THE RESULT OF THE SERIES OF 
EVENTS ON JULY 25? WHERE WAS MR.

07:28:24.314 --> 07:28:30.864
DUFFY'S GUIDANCE COMING FROM? 
WHY WAS THE REQUEST SENSITIVE? 

07:28:31.273 --> 07:28:35.944
WAS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN OMB  
DIRECTION TO DOD AND THE CALL 

07:28:36.345 --> 07:28:38.377
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD WITH 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY , JUST 90 

07:28:39.137 --> 07:28:42.642
MINUTES BEFORE? DID AGENCY 
OFFICIALS COMMUNICATE ABOUT 

07:28:42.843 --> 07:28:45.890
QUESTIONS COMING FROM CRANIAL 
OFFICIALS? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

07:28:46.640 --> 07:28:51.733
DESERVE ANSWERS. A SUBPOENA 
WOULD PROVIDE THOSE ANSWERS. 

07:28:54.838 --> 07:28:58.287
OMB DOCUMENT WOULD REVEAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DECISION 

07:28:58.488 --> 07:29:02.954
TO HAVE A POLITICAL APPOINTEE 
TAKE OVER UKRAINIAN FUNDING 

07:29:03.219 --> 07:29:06.820
POSSIBILITY. THE TENSIONS AND 
CHAOS SURROUNDING THE FREEZE 

07:29:07.021 --> 07:29:10.069
ESCALATING AT THE END OF JULY, 
WHEN DUFFY, A POLITICAL 

07:29:10.269 --> 07:29:14.279
APPOINTEE AT OMB, WITH NO 
RELEVANT EXPERIENCE IN FUNDING 

07:29:14.419 --> 07:29:19.965
APPROVAL TO AUTHORITY FOR 
RELEASING MILITARY AID AWAY FROM

07:29:20.108 --> 07:29:25.857
SANDY, A CAREER OMB OFFICIAL. 
SANDY COULD THINK OF NO OTHER 

07:29:25.998 --> 07:29:30.734
EXPLANATION OF A POLITICAL 
DOESN'T NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF A 

07:29:30.883 --> 07:29:35.254
POLITICAL APPOINTEE TAKING ON 
THIS IS AT THE ABILITY. SANDY 

07:29:35.455 --> 07:29:38.102
WAS GIVEN NO REASON, OTHER THAN 
MR. DUFFY WANTED TO BE "MORE 

07:29:38.302 --> 07:29:45.205
INVOLVED IN DAILY OPERATIONS. " 
DURING HIS DEPOSITION, SANDY 

07:29:45.607 --> 07:29:47.437
CONFIRMED HE WAS REMOVED FROM 
THE FUNDING APPROVAL PROCESS 

07:29:47.438 --> 07:29:51.705
AFTER IT RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT 
WHETHER THE HOLD WAS LEGAL UNDER

07:29:51.905 --> 07:29:56.269
THE EMPOWERMENT CONTROL ACT. 
NEEDLESS TO SAY, OMB HAS REFUSED

07:29:57.187 --> 07:30:00.058
TO TURN OVER ANY DOCUMENTS OR 
PUBLICATIONS INVOLVING THE 

07:30:00.437 --> 07:30:03.028
DECISION TO REPLACE MR. SANDY. 

07:30:07.351 --> 07:30:09.179
WHY DID DUFFY, A POLITICAL 
APPOINTEE WITH NO RELEVANT 

07:30:09.180 --> 07:30:12.215
EXPERIMENTS IN THIS AREA, TAKE 
OVER RESPONSE ABILITY FOR 

07:30:12.430 --> 07:30:17.232
UKRAINE FUNDING APPROVAL? WAS 
THE WHITE HOUSE INVOLVED IN THE 

07:30:17.384 --> 07:30:20.961
DECISION? WAS SANDY REMOVED 
BECAUSE HE EXPRESSED CONCERNS 

07:30:21.161 --> 07:30:27.259
ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE HOLD? 
BY AUGUST 7, PEOPLE IN OUR 

07:30:27.461 --> 07:30:34.973
GOVERNMENT WERE WORRIED. I WOULD
PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT WORRY, 

07:30:35.374 --> 07:30:39.375
SOMETIMES, WHAT THEY DO IS DRAFT
MEMOS. BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE 

07:30:39.530 --> 07:30:43.090
CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT 
UP IN SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T 

07:30:43.840 --> 07:30:48.449
SEEM RIGHT, THEY DO NOT WANT TO 
BE A PART OF IT. ON THAT DAY,

07:30:53.258 --> 07:30:55.490
MARK SANDY AND OTHER COLLEAGUES 
AT OMB, DRAFTED AND SENT A MEMO 

07:30:55.690 --> 07:30:58.325
ABOUT UKRAINE MILITARY AID  TO 
ACTING DIRECTOR. ACCORDING TO 

07:30:58.540 --> 07:31:03.006
SANDY, THE MEMO ADVOCATED FOR 
THE RELEASE OF FUNDS. IT SAID 

07:31:03.207 --> 07:31:06.056
THE MILITARY AID WAS CONSISTENT 
WITH AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY 

07:31:07.011 --> 07:31:10.922
INTEREST. IT WOULD HELP TO 
OPPOSE RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AND 

07:31:11.122 --> 07:31:15.552
WAS BACKED BY STRONG BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DID 

07:31:15.700 --> 07:31:17.700
NOT RECEIVE IT. 

07:31:21.483 --> 07:31:23.514
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, OMB
CONTINUED TO ISSUE FUNDING 

07:31:23.715 --> 07:31:26.725
DOCUMENTS THAT KEPT KICKING THE 
CAN DOWN THE ROAD. SUPPOSEDLY TO

07:31:26.869 --> 07:31:33.426
ALLOW FOR MORE "INTERAGENCY 
PROCESS. " INSERTING THE 

07:31:33.567 --> 07:31:38.548
FOOTNOTES FOR THE APPORTIONMENT 
DOCUMENT, STATING THAT THE LAKE 

07:31:38.748 --> 07:31:45.610
WOULD NOT AFFECT FUNDING. HERE 
IS THE SHOCKING PART. THERE WAS 

07:31:45.792 --> 07:31:55.000
NO INTERAGENCY PROCESS. THEY 
MADE IT UP. IT HAD ENDED MONTHS 

07:31:55.762 --> 07:32:02.515
BEFORE. THEY MADE IT UP BECAUSE 
NOBODY COULD SAY THE REAL REASON

07:32:02.730 --> 07:32:09.169
FOR THE HOLD. IN TOTAL, OMB 
ISSUED NINE OF THESE DOCUMENTS 

07:32:09.316 --> 07:32:15.929
BETWEEN LIGHT 25 OF THE TIMBER 
10. TO THE WHITE HOUSE RESPOND 

07:32:16.130 --> 07:32:19.113
TO OMB CONCERNS  AND 
RECOMMENDATION TO RELEASE THE 

07:32:19.273 --> 07:32:23.138
AID? DID THE WHITE HOUSE 
INSTRUCT OMB TO CONTINUE  

07:32:23.448 --> 07:32:28.929
CRATING A PAPER TRAIL IN AN 
EFFORT TO JUSTIFY THE HOLD? WHO 

07:32:29.129 --> 07:32:36.444
KNEW WHAT AND WHEN? OMB 
DOCUMENTS WOULD SHED LIGHT ON 

07:32:37.203 --> 07:32:42.125
OMB ACTIONS, AS THE PRESIDENTS 
SCHEME UNRAVELED. DID THE WHITE 

07:32:42.875 --> 07:32:49.037
HOUSE DIRECT OMB TO CONTINUE 
ISSUING THE HOLD? WHAT WAS OMB 

07:32:49.237 --> 07:32:51.672
TOLD ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS REASON
FOR RELEASING THE HOLD ?  WHAT 

07:32:51.885 --> 07:32:54.122
COMMUNICATIONS DID OMB OFFICIALS
HAVE  WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 

07:32:54.318 --> 07:32:57.972
AROUND THE TIME OF THE POLICE? 
IS THE SCHEME UNRAVELED, DID 

07:32:58.173 --> 07:33:01.579
ANYONE AT OMB CONNECT THE DOTS  
FOR THE REAL REASON FOR THE 

07:33:01.719 --> 07:33:06.905
HOLD? THE OMB DOCUMENT SWITCH A 
LIGHT ON ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS 

07:33:07.319 --> 07:33:09.319
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE 
ANSWERS. 

07:33:14.019 --> 07:33:18.698
I REMEMBER WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO
NOT HAVE THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU 

07:33:18.897 --> 07:33:20.897
NEED, WHEN YOU NEED IT. 

07:33:23.365 --> 07:33:28.389
REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT 
STAKE. THAT IS WHY THIS MATTERS.

07:33:30.883 --> 07:33:35.147
WE NEED THIS INFORMATION, SO 
THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THIS 

07:33:35.348 --> 07:33:42.661
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. EVENTUALLY,
IT WILL ALL COME OUT. WE WILL 

07:33:43.064 --> 07:33:48.962
HAVE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. 
THE QUESTION NOW, IS WHETHER WE 

07:33:49.164 --> 07:33:54.243
WILL HAVE THEM IN TIME. AND WHO 
HERE WILL BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE 

07:33:54.445 --> 07:33:56.445
OF HISTORY. 

07:34:04.124 --> 07:34:08.258
SIR, CHIEF JUSTICE WE RESERVE 
THE BALTIMORE TIME TO RESPOND TO

07:34:08.457 --> 07:34:12.069
THE ARGUMENT. 
&gt;&gt; MR. SEKULOW. 

07:34:15.158 --> 07:34:17.747
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 
AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. 

07:34:20.241 --> 07:34:24.110
MANAGER CROW, YOU SHOULD BE 
HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THE AID THAT 

07:34:24.308 --> 07:34:29.731
WAS PROVIDED TO UKRAINE OVER THE
COURSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

07:34:29.884 --> 07:34:33.439
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDED 
WEAPONS. THEY WERE NOT PROVIDED 

07:34:33.853 --> 07:34:39.333
BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. 
THE SUGGESTION THAT THE UKRAINE 

07:34:39.534 --> 07:34:41.534
FAILED TO GET ANY EQUIPMENT IS 
FALSE. 

07:34:46.852 --> 07:34:48.852
THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE WAS NOT 
FOR FUNDING UKRAINE OVER THE 

07:34:48.879 --> 07:34:51.119
SUMMER OF 2019. THERE WAS NO 
LACK OF EQUIPMENT DUE TO THE 

07:34:51.313 --> 07:34:53.313
TEMPORARY PAUSE OF FUTURE 
FUNDING. 

07:34:58.223 --> 07:35:02.696
THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE, 
WHO OVERSAW USAID SET THE HOLD 

07:35:02.891 --> 07:35:07.774
CAME AND WENT SO QUICKLY, THEY 
DID NOT NOTICE ANY CHANGE. UNDER

07:35:07.974 --> 07:35:12.641
SECRETARY OF STATE, DAVID HALE, 
HE EXPLAINED THE PAUSE WAS 

07:35:12.855 --> 07:35:17.069
FUTURE ASSISTANCE. NOT TO KEEP 
THE ARMY GOING NOW. THE MADE-UP 

07:35:17.218 --> 07:35:21.786
NARRATIVE THAT SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE WAS CONDITIONED ON 

07:35:21.988 --> 07:35:25.799
UKRAINE TAKING SOME ACTION ON 
INVESTIGATION IS FURTHER 

07:35:25.967 --> 07:35:32.550
DISPROVED BY THE STRICT FORD 
FACT THE AID WAS DELIVERED OF 

07:35:32.750 --> 07:35:34.750
THE TIMBER 11, 2019, WITHOUT 
UKRAINE TAKING ACTION ON ANY 

07:35:35.342 --> 07:35:38.032
INVESTIGATION. IT IS INTERESTING
TO NOTE, THAT THE OBAMA 

07:35:38.784 --> 07:35:43.318
ADMINISTRATION WITHHELD $585 
MILLION OF PROMISED AID TO 

07:35:44.069 --> 07:35:48.999
EGYPT. IN 2013. THE 
ADMINISTRATION PUBLIC MESSAGE 

07:35:49.212 --> 07:35:53.263
WAS THE MONEY WAS NOT OFFICIALLY
ON HOLD, AS TECHNICALLY IT WAS 

07:35:53.878 --> 07:36:00.580
NOT DUE UNTIL THE TIMBER 30. THE
END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AND THEY

07:36:00.779 --> 07:36:03.432
DID NOT DISCLOSE THE HALL TO 
ANYONE. IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS MAY 

07:36:03.628 --> 07:36:07.373
BE A PRACTICE OF A NUMBER OF 
ADMINISTRATIONS. IN FACT,

07:36:11.958 --> 07:36:16.025
THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW AID IS BEING

07:36:16.222 --> 07:36:23.671
PUT FORWARD. THERE HAPPENED 
PAUSES ON FORWARD AID IN A 

07:36:23.812 --> 07:36:25.812
VARIETY OF CONTACTS. 

07:36:28.820 --> 07:36:32.696
OVER $100 MILLION OF AID HAS 
BEEN WITHHELD DUE TO CONCERNS 

07:36:33.449 --> 07:36:35.730
ABOUT GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. IN 
AUGUST 2019, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

07:36:35.931 --> 07:36:39.783
ANNOUNCED THE ADMINISTRATION AND
SOUL WERE IN TALKS TO 

07:36:39.984 --> 07:36:43.447
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE SOUTH 
KOREA'S SHARE OF THE EXTENSIVE 

07:36:43.648 --> 07:36:47.499
U. S. MILITARY SUPPORT FOR SOUTH
KOREA. IN JUNE, PRESIDENT 

07:36:48.247 --> 07:36:51.048
TRUMP'S PAUSED OVER $550 MILLION

07:36:54.613 --> 07:36:57.058
IN FOREIGN AID TO EL SALVADOR, 
HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA BECAUSE 

07:36:57.249 --> 07:37:00.504
THEY WERE NOT SHARING THE BURDEN
OF PREVENTING MASS MIGRATION TO 

07:37:00.713 --> 07:37:03.851
THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS NOT 
THE ONLY ADMINISTRATION

07:37:07.001 --> 07:37:09.033
. AS I SAID, PRESIDENT OBAMA 
WITHHELD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

07:37:09.233 --> 07:37:16.349
DOLLARS OF AID TO EGYPT. TO BE 
CLEAR, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR, 

07:37:16.750 --> 07:37:20.549
AMBASSADOR MARIE YOVANOVITCH  
TESTIFIED OUR POLICY GOT 

07:37:20.708 --> 07:37:26.656
STRONGER UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
LARGELY BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OBAMA

07:37:26.800 --> 07:37:31.382
ADMINISTRATION, THIS 
DEMONSTRATED MADE THE DECISION 

07:37:31.783 --> 07:37:34.989
TO PROVIDE WEAPONS TO UKRAINE. 
TO HELP UKRAINE FEND OFF RUSSIAN

07:37:35.140 --> 07:37:43.363
AGGRESSION. SHE TESTIFIED IN A 
DEPOSITION THAT I FELT IN THE 

07:37:43.563 --> 07:37:45.796
THREE YEARS I WAS THERE, PARTLY 
BECAUSE OF MY EFFORTS, BUT ALSO 

07:37:46.011 --> 07:37:48.378
THE INTERAGENCY TEAMS AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO 

07:37:48.560 --> 07:37:52.712
PROVIDE LETHAL WEAPONS UKRAINE, 
THAT OUR POLICY ACTUALLY GOT 

07:37:53.473 --> 07:37:55.473
STRONGER. 

07:38:00.424 --> 07:38:02.659
DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY KENT 
HAS COME UP A COUPLE TIMES. HE 

07:38:02.858 --> 07:38:06.721
AGREED JAVELINS ARE INCREDIBLY 
EFFECTIVE FARMERS. AND RUSSIANS 

07:38:06.924 --> 07:38:10.786
ARE SCARED OF US. AMBASSADOR 
VOLKER EXPLAINED THAT PRESIDENT 

07:38:11.548 --> 07:38:14.245
TRUMP'S APPROVED EACH OF THE 
DECISIONS MADE ALONG THE WAY. AS

07:38:14.999 --> 07:38:21.552
A RESULT, AMERICAN POLICY TOWARD
UKRAINE IMPROVED. IF YOU WANT TO

07:38:21.751 --> 07:38:27.435
TALK ABOUT FACTS, WITH YOUR OWN 
DISCOVERY. AND YOUR OWN 

07:38:27.649 --> 07:38:29.649
WITNESSES THAT YOU CALLED. 

07:38:32.115 --> 07:38:34.115
IS ALL SUPPOSEDLY STARTED DUE TO
A WHISTLEBLOWER. 

07:38:39.631 --> 07:38:41.631
WHERE IS THE WHISTLEBLOWER?

07:38:44.455 --> 07:38:50.398
&gt;&gt; THE HOUSE MANAGER HAS 35 
MINUTES REMAINING. 

07:38:50.399 --> 07:38:58.519
&gt;&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, AT WAR, 
TIME MATTERS. MINUTES AND HOURS 

07:38:58.921 --> 07:39:06.544
CAN SEEM LIKE YEARS. THE IDEA 
THAT IT MADE IT THERE EVENTUALLY

07:39:07.050 --> 07:39:12.948
JUST DOES NOT WORK. AND YES, THE
AID WAS PROVIDED. WAS PROVIDED 

07:39:13.349 --> 07:39:19.644
BY CONGRESS. THE SENATE AND 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WITH 

07:39:19.846 --> 07:39:25.125
THE PRESIDENT SIGNATURE. 
CONGRESS IS THE ONE THAT SENDS 

07:39:25.541 --> 07:39:27.541
THE AID. 

07:39:29.605 --> 07:39:33.258
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE 
STATE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST 

07:39:33.659 --> 07:39:40.802
BECAUSE OF THE DELAY. HAD 
CONGRESS NOT ACTUALLY PAST 

07:39:41.530 --> 07:39:51.336
ANOTHER LAW THAT EXTENDED THE 
DEADLINE, TO ALLOW THE FUNDS 

07:39:51.537 --> 07:39:53.780
TO BE SPENT. LET ME REPEAT THAT,
THE DELAY JEOPARDIZED THE 

07:39:53.928 --> 07:39:57.218
EXPENDITURE OF MONEY TO SUCH AN 
EXTENT, THAT CONGRESS HAD TO 

07:39:57.441 --> 07:40:05.093
PASS ANOTHER LAW, TO EXTEND THE 
DEADLINE SO THAT THE MONEY AND 

07:40:05.238 --> 07:40:07.733
EQUIPMENT GOT TO THE PEOPLE ON 
THE FRONT LINES. 

07:40:11.855 --> 07:40:18.547
NEED I ALSO REITERATE, THE 
SUPPOSE IT INTERAGENCY PROFITS. 

07:40:18.750 --> 07:40:22.413
A CONCERN THAT THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS COUNSEL CONTINUED TO RAISE 

07:40:22.615 --> 07:40:24.615
BACK CORRUPTION AND MAKING SURE 
THE PROCESS WENT RIGHT. THERE 

07:40:25.204 --> 07:40:30.946
WAS NO INTERAGENCY PROCESS. THE 
WHOLE THING WAS MADE UP. IT WAS 

07:40:31.147 --> 07:40:41.032
A PHANTOM. THERE WAS A DELAY AND
DELAYS MATTER. MR. CHIEF 

07:40:41.185 --> 07:40:45.104
JUSTICE, I RESERVE THE BALANCE 
OF MY TIME. 

07:40:45.105 --> 07:40:47.531
&gt;&gt; MR. ADAM SCHIFF. 

07:40:51.663 --> 07:40:56.946
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. 
JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL POINTS I 

07:40:57.148 --> 07:40:59.148
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ON THE 
AMENDMENT. AND MY COLLEAGUES 

07:40:59.739 --> 07:41:06.425
ARGUMENTS. FIRST OF ALL, MR. 
SEKULOW MISS THE POINT THAT THE 

07:41:06.627 --> 07:41:11.359
AID ULTIMATELY GOT RELEASED. 
THEY ULTIMATELY GOT THE MONEY, 

07:41:12.108 --> 07:41:15.586
RIGHT? YES, THEY GOT THE MONEY 
AFTER THE PRESIDENT GOT CAUGHT. 

07:41:16.442 --> 07:41:21.522
AFTER THE PRESIDENT WAS FORCED 
TO RELEASE THE HOLD ON THE AID. 

07:41:21.723 --> 07:41:27.820
AFTER HE GOT CAUGHT, YES. EVEN 
THEN, EVEN THEN, THEY HELD ONTO 

07:41:28.020 --> 07:41:33.904
THE AIDS ALONG THAT IT TOOK A 
SUBSEQUENT ACT OF CONGRESS, TO 

07:41:34.117 --> 07:41:37.568
MAKE SURE IT ALL WENT OUT THE 
DOOR. IS THE PRESIDENTS WAS TO 

07:41:37.767 --> 07:41:40.816
GET CREDIT FOR THAT? WE HAD TO 
INTERVENE BECAUSE HE WITHHELD 

07:41:41.585 --> 07:41:48.330
THE AID SO LONG. AND THAT IS THE
ONLY REASON UKRAINE GOT ALL OF 

07:41:48.530 --> 07:41:53.612
THE AID THAT WE APPROVED IN THE 
FIRST PLACE. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 

07:41:53.823 --> 07:41:57.272
GLOSSED OVER THE FACT THAT WHAT 
THEY DID WAS ILLEGAL. THAT THAT 

07:41:57.673 --> 07:42:00.721
GAO, AN INDEPENDENT WATCHDOG 
AGENCY FOUND THAT THE HOLD WAS 

07:42:01.469 --> 07:42:07.221
ILLEGAL. IT NORMALLY VIOLATED 
THE LAW, IT NOT ONLY TOOK AN ACT

07:42:07.836 --> 07:42:13.115
OF CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE THEY 
ULTIMATELY GOT THE AID, THIS IS 

07:42:13.315 --> 07:42:16.310
SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEFENSE TO 
WHY YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THE 

07:42:16.453 --> 07:42:21.846
DOCUMENTS? IS THAT WHAT WE ARE 
TO BELIEVE? COUNSEL ALSO SAYS, 

07:42:22.046 --> 07:42:25.032
HE IS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO
WITHHOLD AID. AND THAT IS TRUE. 

07:42:27.939 --> 07:42:31.392
AFTER ALL, COUNSEL SAYS, 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WITHHELD AID TO 

07:42:32.153 --> 07:42:37.766
EGYPT YES, AT THE URGING OF 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. SENATORS 

07:42:38.654 --> 07:42:42.572
JOHN McCAIN AND LINDSEY GRAHAM 
URGED IT BE WITHHELD BECAUSE IT 

07:42:42.773 --> 07:42:47.240
WAS A REVOLUTION IN EGYPT. AFTER
IT WAS APPROPRIATED. IT WAS NOT 

07:42:47.443 --> 07:42:52.264
SOMETHING THAT WAS HIDDEN FROM 
CONGRESS. IT WAS A DARN GOOD 

07:42:52.433 --> 07:42:56.786
REASON WHERE WE WANTED TO GIVE 
AID TO GOVERNMENT AFTER A 

07:42:56.987 --> 07:42:59.834
REVOLUTION. WE ARE NOT SAYING 
AID HAS NEVER BEEN WITHHELD. 

07:43:00.037 --> 07:43:05.741
THAT IS ABSURD. I WOULD HOPE AND
EXPECT IT IS THE FIRST TIME AID 

07:43:05.883 --> 07:43:09.581
HAS BEEN WITHHELD  THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES TO COERCE 

07:43:09.783 --> 07:43:14.247
AN ALLY AT WAR TO HELP THEM 
CHEAT IN THE NEXT ELECTION. I 

07:43:14.462 --> 07:43:19.130
THINK THAT IS A FIRST. WHAT WE 
DO HERE MAY DETERMINE IF IT IS 

07:43:19.331 --> 07:43:21.331
THE LAST. 

07:43:24.416 --> 07:43:29.083
AND ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS 
PAUSE IN AID. THE ARGUMENT, NO 

07:43:29.284 --> 07:43:33.430
HARM, NO FOUL. GOT CAUGHT, THEY 
GOT AID. WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

07:43:37.413 --> 07:43:40.404
WELL, AS WE HER DURING THE 
TRIAL, IT IS NOT JUST THE AID. 

07:43:42.696 --> 07:43:48.992
THE AID IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING. AS MR. CROW MENTIONED, 

07:43:49.195 --> 07:43:52.642
WITHOUT IT, YOU CANNOT DEFEND 
YOURSELF. WE WILL HAVE TESTIMONY

07:43:52.843 --> 07:43:55.853
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MILITARY AID 
THE PRESIDENT WAS WITHHOLDING. 

07:43:56.308 --> 07:44:04.221
WE ALSO HAVE TESTIMONY THAT IT 
WAS THE FACT OF THE AID ITSELF, 

07:44:04.422 --> 07:44:07.075
THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO 
UKRAINE. THE FACT THAT THE 

07:44:07.828 --> 07:44:14.383
UNITED STATES KEPT IT BACK. THE 
NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE, 

07:44:14.583 --> 07:44:16.974
THIS NEW UNTESTED FORMER 
COMEDIAN, THE PRESIDENT OF 

07:44:17.154 --> 07:44:21.789
UKRAINE, AT WAR WITH RUSSIA, IS 
GOING INTO NEGOTIATING

07:44:28.592 --> 07:44:30.624
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN WITH AN EYE 
TO ENDING CONFLICT. WHETHER HE 

07:44:31.039 --> 07:44:33.039
WENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH 
POSITION OF STRENGTH OR POSITION

07:44:33.421 --> 07:44:36.823
OF WEAKNESS, WOULD DEPEND ON 
WHETHER WE HAD HIS BACK. AND SO,

07:44:37.941 --> 07:44:39.941
WHEN UKRAINIANS LEARNED

07:44:42.824 --> 07:44:44.856
AND THE RUSSIANS LEARNED THAT 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE IT IS 

07:44:45.058 --> 07:44:47.849
STATES DID NOT HAVE HIS BACK AND
WAS WITHHOLDING THE AID, WHAT 

07:44:47.999 --> 07:44:51.447
MESSAGE DID THAT SEND TO 
VLADIMIR PUTIN? WHAT MESSAGE

07:44:55.209 --> 07:44:57.648
DID IT SEND TO FIND MY PUTIN 
WHEN DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT LET 

07:44:57.854 --> 07:45:01.507
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, OUT ALLY , 
IN THE DOOR AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 

07:45:01.910 --> 07:45:04.903
BUT DID LET THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER? WHAT MESSAGE DID IT 

07:45:05.099 --> 07:45:09.840
SEND? AS MUCH THE AID. OPEN THE 
AID IS DELIVERED. OR IF ALL AID 

07:45:10.603 --> 07:45:15.468
IS DELIVERED. IT IS ALSO, WHAT 
MESSAGE DID IT SENT TO OUR 

07:45:15.648 --> 07:45:20.390
FRIENDS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
TO OUR FOES? THE MESSAGE IS SENT

07:45:20.605 --> 07:45:23.786
WAS A DISASTER. NOW

07:45:27.101 --> 07:45:29.101
, YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF

07:45:32.782 --> 07:45:34.616
, BECAUSE COUNSEL HAS SAID 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S GAVE LETHAL 

07:45:34.617 --> 07:45:41.933
WEAPONS TO UKRAINE. YOU MAY ASK 
YOURSELF, IF THE PRESIDENT IS SO

07:45:42.133 --> 07:45:45.582
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION, WHY 
DID HE DO THAT IN 2017? WHY DID 

07:45:45.783 --> 07:45:54.113
HE DO IT IN 2018? WHY WAS IT 
ONLY 2019 THAT THERE WAS A 

07:45:54.313 --> 07:45:58.684
PROBLEM? WAS THERE NO CORRUPTION
IN UKRAINE IN 2017 OR 2018?

07:46:03.876 --> 07:46:07.723
NO, UKRAINE HAS ALWAYS BATTLED 
CORRUPTION. WHAT IS DIFFERENT 

07:46:07.922 --> 07:46:11.988
WHEN YOU'RE TO THE OTHER? IT WAS
THE PRESENCE OF JOE BIDEN AS A 

07:46:12.186 --> 07:46:17.266
POTENTIAL FOR PRESIDENT. THAT 
WAS THE KEY CHANGE IN 2019 MADE 

07:46:17.469 --> 07:46:25.600
ALL THE DIFFERENCE. IT GETS BACK
TO ONE OF THE KEY MOMENTS IN THE

07:46:26.357 --> 07:46:28.357
SAGA. 

07:46:32.714 --> 07:46:35.147
A LOT OF YOU ARE ATTORNEYS. WHAT
ATTORNEYS THAT I AM. I'M SURE 

07:46:35.345 --> 07:46:38.757
YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN CASES
YOU HAVE TRIED WHERE THERE WAS 

07:46:38.911 --> 07:46:41.933
SOME VIGNETTE OR CONVERSATION. 
SOME DOCUMENT

07:46:46.925 --> 07:46:49.359
AND IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AS 
IMPORTANT ON ITS FACE. HE TOLD 

07:46:49.572 --> 07:46:51.606
YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CASE. 
THERE WAS MUCH LARGER THAN A 

07:46:52.366 --> 07:46:56.070
CONVERSATION. FOR ME, ONE OF THE
CONVERSATIONS WAS NOT JULY 25 

07:46:56.270 --> 07:47:01.151
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WITH 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. IT WAS JULY 

07:47:01.350 --> 07:47:06.765
26. THE NEXT DAY . YOU MAY HAVE 
WATCHED SOME OF THE HOUSE 

07:47:06.913 --> 07:47:10.698
PROCEEDINGS. PEOPLE WATCHING, 
MAY HAVE SEEN IT OR THEY DO NOT 

07:47:10.897 --> 07:47:13.265
THERE IS A SCENE IN A UKRAINIAN 
RESTAURANT. 

07:47:16.380 --> 07:47:19.231
WITH  AMBASSADOR GORDON 
SONDLAND. HE SAID, THERE WAS A 

07:47:19.988 --> 07:47:24.099
QUICK POLICE. TWO PLUS TWO 
EQUALS FOUR. THIS IS NOT A NEVER

07:47:24.510 --> 07:47:29.530
TRUMPER. HE IS A MILLION-DOLLAR 
DONOR AT THE TRUMP INAUGURATION.

07:47:31.009 --> 07:47:33.040
IF THERE IS A BIAS, IS A 
MILLION-DOLLAR BIAS IN HIS 

07:47:33.800 --> 07:47:41.572
FAVOR. THERE IS A SCENE IN KEY 
OF IN A RESTAURANT. AND 

07:47:41.976 --> 07:47:44.821
AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND HAS A
CELL PHONE AND THIS  SITTING 

07:47:45.021 --> 07:47:54.167
WITH DAVID HOLMES, A U. S. LIMIT
DIPLOMAT. AND AMBASSADOR GORDON 

07:47:54.369 --> 07:47:56.399
SONDLAND CALLS THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HE IS HOLDING FOR THE PRESIDENT 

07:47:56.602 --> 07:48:00.450
. AND IT IS WANT TO BE CONNECTED
. AND HE IS CONNECTED TO THE 

07:48:00.665 --> 07:48:02.665
PRESIDENT. IT IS IMPRESSIVE, 
RIGHT? HE HAS A RELATIONSHIP 

07:48:02.699 --> 07:48:07.980
WITH THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT
IS A HE BARELY KNOWS HIM, BUT 

07:48:08.181 --> 07:48:10.181
THE GUY CAN CALL HIM. 

07:48:14.276 --> 07:48:18.540
THE PRESIDENTS VOICE WAS SO 
LOUD, DAVID HOLMES, U. S. 

07:48:18.741 --> 07:48:23.821
DIPLOMAT CAN HEAR HIM. WHAT DOES
THE PRESIDENT SAY? DOES HE SAY 

07:48:24.021 --> 07:48:32.553
HOW IS REFORM COMING? HOW IS THE
ATTACK ON CORRUPTION GOING? NO. 

07:48:32.755 --> 07:48:39.869
HE JUST SAYS, IS HE GOING TO DO 
THE INVESTIGATION? IS VOLODYMYR 

07:48:40.069 --> 07:48:43.117
ZELENSKY GOING TO DO THE 
INVESTIGATION?  AND AMBASSADOR 

07:48:43.318 --> 07:48:47.384
GORDON SONDLAND SAYS, YES , HE 
WILL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT. HE 

07:48:48.153 --> 07:48:55.298
LOVES YOUR. THIS IS THE EXTENT 
OF THE PRESIDENTS INTEREST IN 

07:48:55.713 --> 07:48:58.147
UKRAINE. THE GO TO TALK ABOUT 
OTHER THINGS. AND THEN THEY HANG

07:48:58.907 --> 07:49:07.281
UP. AND DAVID HOLMES TURNED TO 
THE AMBASSADOR AND SAYS IN 

07:49:07.495 --> 07:49:09.670
LANGUAGE I WILL HAVE TO MODIFY. 

07:49:12.774 --> 07:49:17.854
TO REMOVE AN EXPLETIVE. HE SAYS 
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, 

07:49:18.255 --> 07:49:23.537
DOES THE PRESIDENT GIVE A LINK 
ABOUT UKRAINE? AND AMBASSADOR 

07:49:23.737 --> 07:49:28.415
GORDON SONDLAND SAYS NO , HE 
DOES NOT GIVE A BLANK ABOUT 

07:49:28.817 --> 07:49:32.002
UKRAINE. HE ONLY CARES ABOUT THE
BIG STUFF. LIKE THE 

07:49:32.143 --> 07:49:39.126
INVESTIGATION OF THE BIDENS THAT
RUDY GIULIANI WANTS. THIS IS A 

07:49:39.271 --> 07:49:45.073
MILLION-DOLLAR DONOR TO THE 
TRUMP INAUGURAL. ADMITTING THE 

07:49:45.272 --> 07:49:47.272
PRESIDENT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT 
UKRAINE. HE DOES NOT CARE 

07:49:47.306 --> 07:49:49.123
WHETHER THEY GET MILITARY 
DOLLARS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. HE

07:49:49.124 --> 07:49:53.806
DOES NOT CARE ABOUT WHAT 
POSITION VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY GOES

07:49:54.564 --> 07:49:56.564
INTO  WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH

07:49:59.489 --> 07:50:03.142
VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE DOES NOT CARE
ABOUT THAT. ISN'T THAT CLEAR? HE

07:50:03.355 --> 07:50:08.222
DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CORRUPTION 
IN 2017 OR 2018. HE CERTAINLY 

07:50:08.423 --> 07:50:11.470
DID NOT CARE IN 2019. ALL HE 
CARED ABOUT WAS THE STUFF THAT 

07:50:11.672 --> 07:50:14.797
AFFECTED HIM PERSONALLY. THE 
INVESTIGATION

07:50:19.195 --> 07:50:21.195
THAT HE WANTED OF THE BIDENS. 

07:50:24.683 --> 07:50:28.469
SO WHEN YOU ASK, DO YOU WANT TO 
SEE THESE DOCUMENTS? WANT TO 

07:50:28.624 --> 07:50:32.801
KNOW IF THE DOCUMENTS COOPERATE 
AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND?  

07:50:33.002 --> 07:50:37.892
WILL THE DOCUMENTS SHOW AS WE 
EXPECT THEY DO THAT THE ONLY 

07:50:38.083 --> 07:50:42.751
THING HE CARED ABOUT WAS THE BIG
STUFF THAT AFFECTED HIM? DAVID 

07:50:42.964 --> 07:50:48.795
HOLMES RESPONSE WAS, WILL YOU 
KNOW THERE IS BIG STUFF GOING ON

07:50:48.942 --> 07:50:56.159
HERE LIKE THE WAR WITH RUSSIA. 
THIS IS NOT WITHHOLDING AID 

07:50:56.580 --> 07:51:00.923
BECAUSE OF A REVOLUTION IN 
EGYPT. THIS IS WITHHOLDING AID

07:51:05.104 --> 07:51:07.136
FROM A COUNTRY IN WHICH 15,000 
PEOPLE HAVE DIED FIGHTING THE 

07:51:07.895 --> 07:51:14.853
RUSSIANS. AS AMBASSADOR TAYLOR 
SAID, AND OTHERS, RUSSIA IS 

07:51:15.053 --> 07:51:20.736
FIGHTING TO REMAKE THE MAP OF 
EUROPE. USING MILITARY FORCE. IF

07:51:20.937 --> 07:51:24.801
WE THINK THAT IS JUST ABOUT 
UKRAINE SECURITY, WE ARE VERY 

07:51:25.562 --> 07:51:30.897
DECEIVED. IT IS ABOUT OUR 
SECURITY. IS ABOUT TENS OF 

07:51:31.098 --> 07:51:33.098
THOUSANDS OF TROOPS WE HAVE IN 
YOUR. 

07:51:36.983 --> 07:51:42.064
IF WE EDUCATE OUR OWN ALLY GIVE 
RUSSIA A REASON TO BELIEVE WE DO

07:51:42.265 --> 07:51:46.732
NOT HAVE THEIR BACK, AND USE 
UKRAINE AS A PLEASING OR WORSE, 

07:51:46.945 --> 07:51:53.806
TO GET THEM JOBLESS CHEAT AND 
ELECTION, IT WILL ONLY EMBOLDEN 

07:51:53.953 --> 07:52:02.791
PUTIN TO DO MORE. THE ONLY THING
HE RESPECTS HIS STRENGTH. IF YOU

07:52:03.002 --> 07:52:05.024
THINK THAT LOOKS EXTRA TO 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, I THINK IT LOOKS

07:52:05.226 --> 07:52:07.258
LIKE SOMETHING VLADIMIR PUTIN IS
TOO ACCUSTOMED TO. THAT IS THE 

07:52:07.460 --> 07:52:13.559
KIND OF CORRUPTION THAT HE FINDS
AND PERPETUATES OF HIS OWN 

07:52:13.763 --> 07:52:18.030
REGIME AND PUSHES AROUND THE 
WORLD. MY COLLEAGUE MADE 

07:52:18.223 --> 07:52:22.290
REFERENCE TO A CONVERSATION 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE OTHER GETS 

07:52:22.490 --> 07:52:28.172
IN THE SAD SAGA. THAT IS A 
CONVERSATION THAT AMBASSADOR TO 

07:52:29.140 --> 07:52:34.609
HAS WITH ONE OF THE TOP AIDES TO
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. THIS IS A 

07:52:34.751 --> 07:52:36.751
CONVERSATION

07:52:40.176 --> 07:52:42.732
WHERE AMBASSADOR VOLKER DOES 
WHAT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

07:52:43.000 --> 07:52:47.479
HE IS TELLING UNDER YOUR MOCK 
YOU SHOULD NOT DO THE 

07:52:47.838 --> 07:52:52.556
INVESTIGATION OF YOUR FORMER 
PRESIDENT. IT WOULD BE FOR A 

07:52:52.758 --> 07:52:55.392
POLITICAL REASON. YOU SHOULD NOT
ENGAGE IN POLITICAL 

07:52:56.139 --> 07:52:58.139
INVESTIGATIONS. THE 
INVESTIGATIVE

07:53:02.305 --> 07:53:04.940
PERSON SAID, LIKE THE ONE YOU 
WANT US TO DO OF THE BIDENS AND 

07:53:05.142 --> 07:53:10.636
CLINTONS? HE THREW IT IN HIS 
FACE. UKRAINE IS NOT OBLIVIOUS 

07:53:11.041 --> 07:53:13.041
TO THE HYPOCRISY. 

07:53:18.144 --> 07:53:21.392
MR. 
&gt;&gt; LOU SAYS WHAT ARE HERE FOR? A

07:53:21.592 --> 07:53:28.317
PART OF OUR STRENGTH IS NOT ONLY
SUPPORT FOR ALLIES AND MILITARY.

07:53:28.508 --> 07:53:31.956
IT IS WHAT WE STAND FOR. WE USED
TO STAND FOR THE RULE OF LAW. WE

07:53:32.156 --> 07:53:34.601
USED TO CHAMPION THE RULE OF LAW
AROUND THE WORLD. PART OF THE 

07:53:34.802 --> 07:53:41.300
RULE OF LAW IS THAT NO ONE IS 
ABOVE THE LAW. BUT TO BE OUT IN 

07:53:41.501 --> 07:53:46.379
UKRAINE AS A DO NOT ENGAGE IN 
POLITICAL PROSECUTION. AND 

07:53:46.580 --> 07:53:50.040
HAVING THEM THROW IT IN OUR 
FACE. LIKE THE ONE YOU WANT US 

07:53:50.241 --> 07:53:58.156
TO DO. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. 
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. THAT IS

07:53:58.369 --> 07:54:05.467
WHY WE ARE HERE. I YELLED BACK. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE.

SURPRISE, A THIRD AMENDMENT, THE
CHUCK SCHUMER PROPOSED WAS 

08:02:24.281 --> 08:02:29.630
TABLED. REPUBLICANS WERE ABLE TO
SUCCESSFULLY TABLE IT OR KILL 

08:02:29.830 --> 08:02:35.111
IT. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THEY
CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD. SO FAR,

08:02:35.312 --> 08:02:38.975
REPUBLICANS HAVE KILLED ATTEMPTS
TO SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM OMB. 

08:02:39.180 --> 08:02:42.425
THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND 
BUDGET ALSO, DOCUMENTS AND 

08:02:42.625 --> 08:02:45.012
RECORDS FROM THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND DOCUMENTS AND 

08:02:45.161 --> 08:02:48.522
RECORDS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 
WITH THE DEMOCRATS WILL PUSH FOR

08:02:48.723 --> 08:02:51.663
NEXT, IS AN ATTEMPT TO SUBPOENA 
MICK MULVANEY

08:02:56.033 --> 08:02:58.265
, THE ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF, 
FORMERLY OF OMB. YOU CAN SEE 

08:02:58.481 --> 08:03:03.346
LEADER McCONNELL WALKING OUT, AS
MEMBERS HAD TO DINNER. WE EXPECT

08:03:03.547 --> 08:03:05.547
THEM TO COME BACK IN HALF AN 
HOUR. 

08:03:10.059 --> 08:03:13.653
IS THE PUSH FOR SUBPOENAS MORE 
INFORMATION. THERE MAKING THE 

08:03:13.799 --> 08:03:18.529
CASE TO GET INFORMATION AND 
LAYING OUT SOME OF THEIR 

08:03:18.672 --> 08:03:23.055
ARGUMENTS OF WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP
SHOULD BE IMPEACH. AS WE WATCH 

08:03:23.258 --> 08:03:26.706
OUTSIDE THE SENATE CHAMBERS. WE 
HAVE ROBERT GOLDEN COVERING ALL 

08:03:26.908 --> 08:03:30.370
OF THIS ON CAPITOL HILL. RHONDA,
LET'S TALK ABOUT WITH DEMOCRATS 

08:03:30.568 --> 08:03:33.000
WILL PUSH FOR. AND WHAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET ALL DAY 

08:03:33.750 --> 08:03:39.099
TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE JUST SAW, AS WE GO 

08:03:39.299 --> 08:03:43.764
SAID, IT WAS A TABLED AMENDMENT 
TO GET DOCUMENTS FROM THE OFFICE

08:03:44.520 --> 08:03:46.520
OF MANAGEMENT. 

08:04:01.794 --> 08:04:09.360
&gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY CHUCK SCHUMER 
BROUGHT IT UP AS AN OFFICE THAT 

08:04:09.575 --> 08:04:13.637
HE WANTED TO SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS 
FROM. NEXT UP, WE ARE GOING TO 

08:04:13.837 --> 08:04:16.271
SEE, ONCE A COME BACK FROM THE 
30 MINUTE RATE, WE'RE GOING TO 

08:04:16.471 --> 08:04:20.938
HEAR DEBATE OVER THE AMENDMENT 
TO POSSIBLY SUBPOENA MICK 

08:04:21.152 --> 08:04:23.732
MULVANEY, THE ACTING CHIEF OF 
STAFF OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

08:04:26.433 --> 08:04:35.390
HE IS A SOUGHT AFTER WITNESS. HE
SAID HE WOULD NOT COME. HE WANTS

08:04:35.565 --> 08:04:41.052
AT LEAST TO BE ON THE RECORD AND
IT HAS BEEN ASKED THAT HE WOULD 

08:04:41.263 --> 08:04:43.899
BE SUBPOENAED TO BE A WITNESS. 
HE IS A PERSON OF INTEREST TO A 

08:04:44.102 --> 08:04:46.102
LOT OF DEMOCRATS

08:04:48.163 --> 08:04:50.197
. LAST WEEK, I SPOKE WITH 
SENATOR DOUG JONES OF ALABAMA, 

08:04:50.397 --> 08:04:54.864
ABOUT WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT IN 
THE TRIAL. AND WHO HE WANTED TO 

08:04:55.064 --> 08:04:57.511
HEAR FROM. HE SAID AT THE TOP OF
MY LIST IS MICK MULVANEY, 

08:04:57.711 --> 08:05:01.973
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS 
ONCE A DIRECTOR OF OMB AND IS 

08:05:02.173 --> 08:05:04.620
NOW CHIEF OF STAFF. AND HE WOULD
HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT 

08:05:04.820 --> 08:05:08.883
HOUSE MEMBERS WANTED TO GET. 
&gt;&gt; RHONDA, WHAT IS INTERESTING, 

08:05:09.084 --> 08:05:13.750
AS WE ARE HEARING ABOUT 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 

08:05:13.963 --> 08:05:17.815
REPRESENTING THE DEMOCRATS. AND 
MAKE IT A CASE FOR WHY THEY 

08:05:18.015 --> 08:05:19.845
THINK THE INFORMATION IS 
VALUABLE. WHERE THEY THINK OMB 

08:05:19.846 --> 08:05:22.081
IS AT THE CENTER OF THIS. WHY 
THE SUBPOENA WOULD BE POWERFUL. 

08:05:22.281 --> 08:05:27.162
ALSO, WHETHER WANT THE RECORD 
FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT. EVEN 

08:05:27.363 --> 08:05:29.363
AS THEY REQUEST THE SUBPOENAS 
AND DOCUMENTS, WE ARE GETTING 

08:05:29.395 --> 08:05:31.427
THE SENSE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT 
THEY ARE MAKING TO IMPEACH 

08:05:31.628 --> 08:05:35.893
PRESIDENT TRUMP. BECAUSE THEY 
ARE INTRODUCING PIECES OF 

08:05:36.093 --> 08:05:38.093
EVIDENCE AS AGO LONG. 

08:05:50.111 --> 08:05:52.111
TO TO GET PAST THE OPENING 
ARGUMENTS, THERE WILL BE 

08:05:52.142 --> 08:05:54.619
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ARGUMENTS.
YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR 

08:05:54.789 --> 08:05:58.039
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM 
THEM. THEY HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT 

08:05:58.239 --> 08:06:01.892
EXTENSIVELY. THEY SEEM 
WELL-PREPARED. BY REVIEWING THE 

08:06:02.645 --> 08:06:05.694
DIFFERENT TESTIMONIES THAT HAVE 
OCCURRED IN THE PUBLIC PHASE. 

08:06:06.157 --> 08:06:10.222
THE UP AND RUNNING VIDEOS FROM 
THE PUBLIC PHASE. PUTTING 

08:06:10.422 --> 08:06:12.454
DOCUMENTS ON THE SCREEN. NEWS 
REPORTS ON THE SCREEN. THEY SEEM

08:06:12.656 --> 08:06:18.965
READY TO BRING THE CASE, THAT 
THEY BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 

08:06:19.368 --> 08:06:21.368
PARTICIPATED IN CONDUCT AND 
SHOULD BE IMPEACH. THEY ARE NOT 

08:06:21.399 --> 08:06:24.850
LETTING UP FROM THE VIEW. WHAT 
THE DATE IS ABOUT IS THE 

08:06:25.251 --> 08:06:27.251
EIGHTEENTH OF RULES FOR THE 
TRIAL. THEY ARE REALLY UTILIZING

08:06:27.842 --> 08:06:31.962
THEIR TIME IN THE TWO HOURS OF 
DEBATE, TO REALLY HAMMER DOWN 

08:06:32.366 --> 08:06:35.814
WITH THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS, WHEN 
IT COMES TO IF THE PRESIDENT DID

08:06:36.014 --> 08:06:40.696
PARTICIPATE IN THIS CONDUCT. 
HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG, THE 

08:06:40.899 --> 08:06:45.977
CORE ARGUMENT IS HE IS THE 
FRAMERS WORST NIGHTMARE. THE 

08:06:46.178 --> 08:06:49.627
FRAMERS WANTED THE IMPEACHMENT 
CLAUSE TO PROTECT FROM A 

08:06:49.831 --> 08:06:52.275
PRESIDENT WHO WOULD WILLFULLY GO
AND DO THINGS ON THEIR OWN 

08:06:52.477 --> 08:06:55.926
PERSONAL AMBITION. AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO CONTINUE TO BRING THAT 

08:06:56.127 --> 08:07:01.610
THROUGH, AS THE TRIAL CONTINUES.
&gt;&gt; RHONDA COLD AND, THANK YOU SO

08:07:01.824 --> 08:07:04.259
MUCH. THE HOUSE MANAGER WILL 
HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER CHUCK 

08:07:04.460 --> 08:07:07.107
SCHUMER'S ARGUMENTS. THEY WILL 
USE THAT TO MAKE A BROADER CASE 

08:07:07.307 --> 08:07:10.557
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 
CONGRESSMAN VAL DEMINGS IS AN 

08:07:11.305 --> 08:07:14.621
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER. IS THE 
FIRST TIME WE HEAR FROM HER IN 

08:07:14.822 --> 08:07:18.274
THAT ROLE TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; THE HOUSE MANAGERS STRONGLY 

08:07:18.475 --> 08:07:21.109
SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT TO ISSUE 
SUBPOENAS FOR DOCUMENTS, TO THE 

08:07:21.324 --> 08:07:26.954
STATE DEPARTMENT. AS WE EXPLAIN,
THE FIRST ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT

08:07:27.106 --> 08:07:33.513
CHARGES, THE PRESIDENT WAS USING
THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE, TO 

08:07:33.706 --> 08:07:39.402
SOLICIT AND PRESSURE UKRAINE, TO
ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATIONS, THAT 

08:07:39.604 --> 08:07:43.816
EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER KNOWS 
TO BE BOGUS. 

08:07:48.736 --> 08:07:50.736
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT EVEN CARE 
IF AN INVESTIGATION WAS 

08:07:50.769 --> 08:07:55.849
CONDUCTED, JUST THAT IT WAS 
ANNOUNCED. WHY? BECAUSE THIS WAS

08:07:56.049 --> 08:08:00.672
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL AND 
POLITICAL BENEFIT. 

08:08:04.792 --> 08:08:06.792
THE FIRST ARTICLE FOR THE 
CHARGES THAT THE PRESIDENT DID 

08:08:06.823 --> 08:08:10.271
SO, WITH CORRECT MOTIVE. AND 
THAT HIS USE OF POWER FOR 

08:08:11.030 --> 08:08:15.150
PERSONAL GAIN, HARMED THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED 

08:08:15.909 --> 08:08:21.449
STATES. AS A SECOND ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT CHARGES, THE 

08:08:21.651 --> 08:08:26.475
PRESIDENT SOUGHT TO CONCEAL 
EVIDENCE OF THIS CONDUCT. HE DID

08:08:26.653 --> 08:08:33.225
SO, BY ORDERING HIS ENTIRE 
ADMINISTRATION, EVERY OFFICE, 

08:08:33.984 --> 08:08:41.356
EVERY AGENCY, EVERY OFFICIAL, TO
DEFY EVERY SUBPOENA. SERVED IN 

08:08:41.556 --> 08:08:47.452
THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. 
NO PRESIDENT IN HISTORY HAS EVER

08:08:48.202 --> 08:08:54.501
DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. MANY 
PRESIDENTS HAVE EXPRESSLY GET 

08:08:54.645 --> 08:08:58.968
KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY CANNOT DO 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS. PRESIDENT 

08:08:59.155 --> 08:09:03.893
TRUMP'S DID NOT TAKE THESE 
EXTREME STEPS TO HIDE EVIDENCE 

08:09:04.308 --> 08:09:10.154
OF HIS INNOCENCE. OR TO PROTECT 
THE INSTITUTION OF THE 

08:09:10.303 --> 08:09:15.471
PRESIDENCY AS A CAREER LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. I HAVE 

08:09:15.673 --> 08:09:22.984
NEVER SEEN ANYONE TAKE SUCH 
EXTREME STEPS TO HIDE EVIDENCE, 

08:09:23.746 --> 08:09:28.266
ALLEGEDLY PROVING HIS INNOCENCE.
AND I DO NOT FIND THAT HERE 

08:09:29.015 --> 08:09:31.015
TODAY. 

08:09:32.944 --> 08:09:37.568
THE PRESIDENT IS ENGAGED IN THIS
COVER-UP. BECAUSE HE IS GUILTY. 

08:09:39.643 --> 08:09:45.126
HE KNOWS THE EVIDENCE HE IS 
CONCEALING ONLY FOR THE 

08:09:45.541 --> 08:09:47.541
DEMONSTRATE HIS CULPABILITY. 

08:09:54.884 --> 08:09:56.920
THE HOUSE HAS AMASSED POWERFUL 
EVIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT AND 

08:09:57.116 --> 08:10:04.233
HIS EYE CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS VAL DEMINGS ONE OF 

08:10:04.432 --> 08:10:07.479
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS. WITH A
REPORTER IN CALI, MIKE, WHO HAS 

08:10:07.678 --> 08:10:14.179
BEEN COVERING THE STORY IN EVERY
STAGE. MIKE, TAKE US THROUGH THE

08:10:14.376 --> 08:10:18.444
LINES OF REPORTING, THAT YOU 
HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING TODAY. WHAT 

08:10:18.642 --> 08:10:20.676
IS STANDING OUT TO YOU, SO FAR?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANKS FOR HAVING 

08:10:21.438 --> 08:10:26.720
ME. LISTEN, WE ARE FINALLY IN 
IT. WE ARE FINALLY HERE. 

08:10:27.992 --> 08:10:32.272
WATCHING THE TRIAL TAKE PLACE. 
WE SPENT LITERALLY A MONTH 

08:10:32.667 --> 08:10:37.534
PREPARING FOR THIS DAY. ABOUT 
GETTING THE FEEL OF THE 

08:10:38.283 --> 08:10:40.283
PROCEEDING. 

08:10:45.667 --> 08:10:47.667
HOW THE SENATORS ARE CONDUCTING 
THEMSELVES TO THE MANAGERS ARE 

08:10:47.836 --> 08:10:49.718
PRESENTING THE CASE. THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS PRESENTING A REBUTTAL. 

08:10:49.719 --> 08:10:52.771
GETTING A FEEL FOR THAT. WE HAVE
SEEN A SERIOUS AND ORGANIZED 

08:10:52.984 --> 08:10:57.986
CASE FROM THE MANAGERS. THEY ARE
GOING THROUGH A SERIES OF 

08:10:58.133 --> 08:11:02.519
DEMANDS. THAT THEY HAVE MADE TO 
TRY TO MAKE THE TRIAL MORE IN 

08:11:02.721 --> 08:11:06.987
THEIR FAVOR. ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
YOU HAVE SEEN THE WHITE HOUSE 

08:11:07.188 --> 08:11:11.465
GIVING A BROADSIDE DEFENSE OF 
THE PRESIDENT. AND ATTACKS ON 

08:11:11.823 --> 08:11:17.283
THE DEMOCRATS. THE SERIOUS TONE 
THEY HAVE 

08:11:17.284 --> 08:11:22.026
&gt;&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF DEFENDING THE 
IMPEACHMENT. CAUGHT IN THE 

08:11:22.226 --> 08:11:25.475
MIDDLE OF SENATORS, WHO ARE 
SITTING AND LISTENING TO AT ALL.

08:11:25.676 --> 08:11:29.743
NOT REALLY SHOWING THEIR HAND, 
EXCEPT IN BITS AND SPURTS IN 

08:11:29.944 --> 08:11:34.611
BETWEEN IN RECESSES. WE ARE 
STARTING TO GET A FEEL FOR HOW 

08:11:34.825 --> 08:11:38.677
THE PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE 
OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. IF 

08:11:38.877 --> 08:11:42.126
NOT LONGER. 
&gt;&gt; YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES, ON 

08:11:42.341 --> 08:11:45.375
CAPITOL HILL ARE DOING A GREAT 
IMPEACHMENT LIVE UPDATE. AND ONE

08:11:45.589 --> 08:11:54.923
OF THE STORIES HAS THE HEADLINE,
THE FIRST VICTIM, MR. RICH. HE 

08:11:55.139 --> 08:11:57.139
DOZED OFF A LITTLE BIT

08:12:00.203 --> 08:12:03.250
DURING THE BACK AND FORTH. TELL 
US WHAT YOU OBSERVED AND WHAT 

08:12:04.015 --> 08:12:11.383
HAPPENED. 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENT. YOU 

08:12:11.589 --> 08:12:14.019
CANNOT TALK TO ANYBODY. YOU CAN 
TAKE NOTES. YOU HAVE NOTHING 

08:12:14.221 --> 08:12:19.715
ELSE TO KEEP YOU OCCUPIED. TO 
KEEP YOU ENGAGED IN WHAT IS 

08:12:19.916 --> 08:12:23.970
GOING ON. PEOPLE WILL FALL 
ASLEEP. WE WERE KEYED ON WHO 

08:12:24.184 --> 08:12:30.884
WOULD BE THE FIRST. WE WENT IN 
KNOWING TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR

08:12:31.487 --> 08:12:34.736
THIS. TOURNAMENT OF THE FOREIGN 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE WAS THE 

08:12:35.350 --> 08:12:40.016
LUCKY MAN, AS FAR AS WE COULD 
TELL. WE HAD OUR EYES PEELED. HE

08:12:40.768 --> 08:12:48.094
WAS OUT A GOOD 20 MINUTES OR 
MORE. HE GETS THE UNFORTUNATE 

08:12:48.236 --> 08:12:53.264
DEMERIT OF IN THE FIRST SENATOR 
TO FALL ASLEEP DURING THE TRIAL 

08:12:53.632 --> 08:13:00.937
OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING INSIDE 

08:13:01.150 --> 08:13:04.200
THE CHAMBER? YOU MENTIONED THAT 
NUMBERS OF THE SENATE DO NOT 

08:13:04.401 --> 08:13:08.466
HAVE THE DEVICES. THEY HAVE TO 
SIT THERE. THEY CAN ONLY TAKE 

08:13:08.668 --> 08:13:11.101
NOTES BY HAND. IF THEY WANT TO. 
HOW MUCH ARE THEY MOVING AROUND?

08:13:11.301 --> 08:13:16.786
WE CANNOT SEE IT. WE ARE ONLY 
ABLE TO SEE THE CAMERA THAT THE 

08:13:16.991 --> 08:13:20.649
SENATE CONTROLS. YOU ARE THE 
EYES AND EARS INSIDE THE 

08:13:21.409 --> 08:13:25.516
CHAMBER. ARE THEY GETTING UP AND
LEAVING? TODAY MILL ABOUT? WHAT 

08:13:26.281 --> 08:13:29.582
YOU WATCH?
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SEEN A FEW GET UP AND 

08:13:29.782 --> 08:13:34.058
LEAVE. EARLIER IN THE DAY WHEN 
WE PUSHED, PEOPLE DID STAY IN 

08:13:34.259 --> 08:13:36.438
THEIR SEATS. THE LAST SESSION

08:13:40.960 --> 08:13:43.194
, WITH IT DEALT WITH A COUPLE OF
AMENDMENTS, PEOPLE WERE MOVING 

08:13:43.392 --> 08:13:45.625
AROUND A LITTLE BIT. SENATOR 
CRUZ GOT UP FOR A LITTLE WHILE. 

08:13:46.390 --> 08:13:49.289
CENTER WICKER IN A COUPLE 
DEMOCRATS AS WELL. WHAT STRUCK 

08:13:50.054 --> 08:13:56.189
ME WAS THE GALLERIES ARE NOT 
FULL. THE PUBLIC GALLERIES, OR 

08:13:56.391 --> 08:14:01.073
PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO COME AND 
WATCH. THE PUBLIC GALLERY WAS 

08:14:01.273 --> 08:14:08.792
BEEN EMPTY FOR THE LAST HOUR OR 
TWO. PART OF THAT IS THE TIGHTLY

08:14:09.557 --> 08:14:11.557
CONTROLLED. 

08:14:13.052 --> 08:14:16.251
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST SHOW
UP AND COME IN AND WATCH. 

08:14:19.752 --> 08:14:24.378
THAT IS ONE THING THAT HAS 
CHANGED ALL OF THIS. THE OTHER 

08:14:24.533 --> 08:14:29.103
THING IS THE SHEER NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WERE CROWDED ONTO THE 

08:14:29.704 --> 08:14:31.704
FLOOR. USUALLY IT IS A SPARSE 
PLACE,

08:14:36.617 --> 08:14:38.849
EXCEPT WHEN THERE IS A VOTE 
HAPPENING. THERE NOT A LOT OF 

08:14:39.050 --> 08:14:41.642
SENATORS. IT IS RARE TO BE 
SITTING IN SEAT LIKE THAT. 

08:14:43.116 --> 08:14:45.116
MANAGER SITTING AT THE TABLE. 

08:14:52.059 --> 08:14:54.059
IS AN INTERESTING FEEL OF THE 
ROOM. 

08:14:58.151 --> 08:15:00.472
IS AN ANYTHING WE NORMALLY SEE 
IN THE SENATE. 

08:15:00.473 --> 08:15:05.837
&gt;&gt; TELL US, WHO DO YOU SEE AND 
WHY ARE THEY SIGNIFICANT?

08:15:05.838 --> 08:15:09.740
&gt;&gt; Reporter: A FEW REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COME 

08:15:10.501 --> 08:15:19.093
OVER. MEADOWS, LOUISE ALDEN AND 
A FEW REPUBLICANS THAT THE TRUMP

08:15:19.291 --> 08:15:21.291
WHITE HOUSE TAPPED AS PART OF 
THEIR IMPEACHMENT TEAM. THEY 

08:15:21.882 --> 08:15:27.825
WERE SITTING ALONG THE RAIL OF 
THE SENATE. THEY WERE WATCHING 

08:15:28.587 --> 08:15:32.843
THE SIDELINES. THE ARE NOT CITED
TO HAVE A ACTIVE ROLE. 

08:15:41.226 --> 08:15:43.260
I DO NOT SEE ANY DEMOCRAT 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE EXCEPT 

08:15:43.460 --> 08:15:48.078
MANAGERS ON THE FLOOR TODAY. 
THEY WERE PACKED IN AT THE 

08:15:48.230 --> 08:15:52.808
TABLE, ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF 
LAWYERS AND STAFFERS FROM THE 

08:15:53.009 --> 08:15:55.009
INTELLIGENCE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 

08:15:58.293 --> 08:16:00.726
&gt;&gt; TELL US ABOUT THE FLOW OF 
TONIGHT AND THE REST OF THE 

08:16:00.928 --> 08:16:06.013
WEEK. AS WE SEE THE CONTOURS OF 
HOW THE PROCESS MAY LOOK. WE 

08:16:06.214 --> 08:16:08.445
KNOW THERE IS ONE MORE 
AMENDMENT, AT LEAST TONIGHT. WE 

08:16:08.646 --> 08:16:12.310
SEE THE AMENDMENT SENATOR 
SCHUMER HAS PROPOSED. CALLING 

08:16:12.510 --> 08:16:16.925
FOR MICK MULVANEY TO BE 
SUBPOENAED. THERE IS NO 

08:16:17.069 --> 08:16:22.987
INDICATION THAT THIS WOULD PASS.
IT LOOKS LIKE

08:16:27.743 --> 08:16:29.777
T LEADER MITCH McCONNELL HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO TABLE ALONG PARTY 

08:16:30.180 --> 08:16:32.827
LIENS. DO WE KNOW IF THERE'S 
MORE TO COME TONIGHT? DOES IT GO

08:16:33.027 --> 08:16:37.293
LONGER IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
HOURS IT'S TELL US ABOUT 

08:16:37.694 --> 08:16:40.343
TOMORROW. 
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FACT THAT WE 

08:16:40.543 --> 08:16:43.793
ARE ON WITNESS AND LIMIT, WE 
MOVE ONTO THE NEXT PHASE. THERE 

08:16:43.993 --> 08:16:52.526
A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS, WE ARE 
DOING MULVANEY, WE MAY DO A 

08:16:52.727 --> 08:16:57.607
COUPLE MORE BEYOND THAT, EACH OF
THESE IS TAKING AN HOUR TO 

08:16:57.808 --> 08:17:03.292
PROCESS. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE, WE
ARE LOOKING TO BE HER A FEW MORE

08:17:03.493 --> 08:17:11.002
HOURS TONIGHT. ONCE THE GENERAL 
RECESS COMES TO A CLOSE. THERE 

08:17:11.217 --> 08:17:15.423
WILL BE A FINAL VOTE ON 
O'CONNELL RESOLUTION. NOBODY

08:17:19.133 --> 08:17:21.167
KNOWS HOW MANY MINUTES THEY WILL
START TO ADD. MITCH McCONNELL 

08:17:21.367 --> 08:17:25.635
HAS BEEN IT CLEAR HE'S NOT GOING
TO CONTINUE INTO TOMORROW. HE IS

08:17:25.834 --> 08:17:29.085
QUESTIONED WHAT THE RULES WILL 
BE. WE WILL BE HERE AS LONG AS 

08:17:29.286 --> 08:17:31.721
WE NEED TO BE TO GET THROUGH THE
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS. 

08:17:31.722 --> 08:17:37.617
&gt;&gt; WE EXPECT TOMORROW FOR THINGS
TO KICKOFF IN TERMS OF SEEING 

08:17:38.380 --> 08:17:41.067
THE ARGUMENTS?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT IS RIGHT. WE 

08:17:41.834 --> 08:17:46.146
DO KNOW THE HOUSE MANAGERS ARE 
READY TO PRESENT THEIR CASE WHEN

08:17:46.347 --> 08:17:50.613
THE TIME COMES. WE KNOW THAT 
WILL BE TOMORROW. ADAM SCHIFF, 

08:17:50.827 --> 08:17:54.075
WE 
&gt;&gt; TO HAVE THE FIRST WORD. AND 

08:17:54.274 --> 08:17:56.109
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE VARIOUS 
MANAGERS TO PRESENT DIFFERENT 

08:17:56.110 --> 08:17:58.110
PARTS OF THE CASE. 

08:18:01.591 --> 08:18:03.409
UNDER MITCH McCONNELL'S 
PROPOSAL, WE EXPECT IT TO BE 

08:18:03.410 --> 08:18:05.642
ADOPTED. THEY WILL 24 HOURS OVER
THREE DAYS. WE EXPECT WILL GO 

08:18:05.857 --> 08:18:07.857
FROM 1:00, CERTAINLY INTO THE 
DINNER HOUR. 

08:18:11.542 --> 08:18:15.699
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, CONTINUING.
AND SATURDAY, AND THEN PROBABLY,

08:18:16.969 --> 08:18:21.292
POSSIBLY MONDAY. YOU WILL SEE 
THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM % THEIR 

08:18:22.052 --> 08:18:27.793
CASE. 
&gt;&gt; COVERING CAPITOL HILL MORNING

08:18:27.994 --> 08:18:33.076
UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT. THANKS FOR 
COVERING. WE APPRECIATE IT.  

08:18:33.476 --> 08:18:38.762
&gt;&gt;&gt; TO ME ON THE TELEPHONE IS 
AMBER PHILLIPS, A REPORTER FOR 

08:18:38.969 --> 08:18:40.993
THE SIX. TRACKING THE INS AND 
OUTS OF THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

08:18:41.194 --> 08:18:44.953
AMBER, NO REAL SURPRISES TODAY. 
ONCE WE DID SEE LEADER McCONNELL

08:18:45.816 --> 08:18:50.744
SHIFT HIS PROPOSAL, THE INITIAL 
PROPOSAL THAT HE CAME UP WITH 

08:18:50.944 --> 08:18:56.627
YESTERDAY, GOVERNING THE TIME 
AND HOW THINGS WOULD FLOW, A BIG

08:18:56.842 --> 08:18:58.842
CHANGE TODAY RIGHT IS THE 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS GOT 

08:18:59.019 --> 08:19:01.252
STARTED. EVERYTHING ELSE HAS 
BEEN FAIRLY PREDICTABLE AND 

08:19:01.405 --> 08:19:05.722
EXPECTED, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

08:19:05.974 --> 08:19:10.243
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, WE SAW 
THE RULES PACKAGE THAT WE SAW 

08:19:10.442 --> 08:19:16.740
MONDAY NIGHT. THE WAY THINGS 
WERE, ARGUMENTS WERE GOING TO GO

08:19:17.141 --> 08:19:20.732
UNTIL 1:00. AS SOON AS THEY 
STARTED DEBATING,

08:19:26.285 --> 08:19:30.752
THE RULES WERE TREAT A LITTLE 
BIT. THE DEMOCRATS A LITTLE BIT 

08:19:30.953 --> 08:19:33.602
MORE PRIME TIME COVERAGE OF 
THEIR ARGUMENTS OVER THE NEXT 

08:19:33.802 --> 08:19:38.470
FEW DAYS. UNTIL ABOUT EVIDENCE 
TO BE SITTING AT CENTERS DESKS 

08:19:38.884 --> 08:19:42.894
WITHOUT A VOTE A COUPLE WEEKS 
INTO THE TRIAL. IT WAS A 

08:19:43.036 --> 08:19:48.831
MEDIUM-SIZED DEAL, RATHER THAN A
BIG DEAL. IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE 

08:19:49.043 --> 08:19:51.879
THE BROAD OUTLINES OF THE TRIAL.
WHICH IS WHAT REPUBLICANS AND 

08:19:52.080 --> 08:19:55.877
DEMOCRATS ARE DEBATING NOW. THAT
IS, WILL WE HAVE WITNESSES AT 

08:19:56.019 --> 08:20:02.244
ALL? OR AT THE OUTSET. ARE WILL 
THEY DECIDE THIS IN A COUPLE OF 

08:20:03.001 --> 08:20:06.707
WEEKS. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A 
COUPLE SENATE REPUBLICANS, THE 

08:20:06.921 --> 08:20:10.972
SCENE OPEN TO HAVING TOP AIDES 
TESTIFY. THERE STAYING IN LINE 

08:20:11.186 --> 08:20:15.237
WITH MITCH McCONNELL. AND SAYING
, I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A BIG 

08:20:15.451 --> 08:20:17.484
DEAL OUT OF NOTHING, DEMOCRATS. 
TO HAVE ALL OF THESE VOTES 

08:20:17.835 --> 08:20:21.877
TODAY. OF COURSE THE WITNESSES 
WERE EARLIER IN THE TRIAL. 

08:20:21.878 --> 08:20:26.616
&gt;&gt; AMY KLOBUCHAR IS TAKING 
QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. LET'S 

08:20:27.231 --> 08:20:29.047
LISTEN. 
&gt;&gt; AND THEN TO THINK ABOUT THE 

08:20:29.048 --> 08:20:32.663
FACT, THAT THEY ARE WATCHING, AS
THIS PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT 

08:20:32.822 --> 08:20:40.029
TRUMP'S MESSES AROUND WITH IT. 
WHAT THEY ARE WATCHING TO SEE. 

08:20:40.229 --> 08:20:43.687
THIS IS A COUNTRY THEY HAVE 
LITERALLY INVADED AND THEY 

08:20:43.879 --> 08:20:47.742
LITERALLY HAVE THEIR EYES ON. 
AND HE DOES NOT HELP THEM OUT 

08:20:47.942 --> 08:20:52.958
WITH AID. I THOUGHT ADAM SCHIFF 
WAS EFFECTIVE. 

08:20:52.959 --> 08:20:57.895
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BERNIE SANDERS IS 
CHARTERING A PLANE. YOU HAVE 

08:20:58.096 --> 08:20:59.312
PLANE?
&gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY HAVE MY FAMILY 

08:20:59.313 --> 08:21:03.377
THERE RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE REALLY
GOOD. AND THEY ARE OUT THERE. WE

08:21:03.592 --> 08:21:06.026
JUST ANNOUNCED THREE NEW 
ENDORSEMENTS TODAY FROM STATE 

08:21:06.785 --> 08:21:08.785
LEGISLATORS. 

08:21:10.091 --> 08:21:12.091
I HAVE LEGISLATORS AND FOUR 
LEGISLATORS THAT ENDORSED ME IN 

08:21:12.660 --> 08:21:16.591
IOWA. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT 
MEANS I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT

08:21:16.792 --> 08:21:20.807
THERE FOR ME IT IS NOT JUST 
WINDOWDRESSING. THEY WERE OUT 

08:21:20.954 --> 08:21:24.910
TODAY AT THE IOWA STATE CAPITAL.
SPEAKING ABOUT THEIR SUPPORT FOR

08:21:25.674 --> 08:21:31.011
ME. THAT WILL MATTER. I WILL DO 
EVERYTHING THAT I CAN WEATHER IT

08:21:31.211 --> 08:21:33.376
IS TOWN HALLS OR SKIPPING IN. 

08:21:38.727 --> 08:21:41.161
AND IF IT IS GETTING THERE WE 
HAVE SUNDAY OFF. IT IS ALWAYS 

08:21:41.362 --> 08:21:43.393
BEEN MY PLAN. WE WERE PREPARED 
FOR THIS. MY HUSBAND AND 

08:21:43.609 --> 08:21:45.783
DAUGHTER ARE THERE RIGHT NOW. 
HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. 

08:21:56.392 --> 08:22:01.123
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
COUNTRY UNDERSTAND. NEARLY 70% 

08:22:02.031 --> 08:22:05.337
OF AMERICANS THINK THERE SHOULD 
BE WITNESSES. THEY THINK THERE 

08:22:05.538 --> 08:22:07.663
SHOULD BE EVIDENCE. WHAT DOES 
THAT MEAN TO ME?

08:22:12.036 --> 08:22:14.036
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND I HAVE TO DO 
MY JOB. 

08:22:22.199 --> 08:22:29.914
I AM SOMEONE THAT KEEPS LOOKING 
UP MY COLLEAGUES. AND SOME OF 

08:22:30.115 --> 08:22:32.115
THEM ARE LOOKING DOWN. 

08:22:34.726 --> 08:22:41.895
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY DO AFTER A 
FEW DAYS OF THIS. I THINK THE 

08:22:42.655 --> 08:22:47.994
HOUSE MANAGER DID A GREAT JOB 
AND WE NEED TO LISTEN TO 

08:22:48.741 --> 08:22:51.855
EVIDENCE. THEY CANNOT HAVE A 
CHILD WAS THERE WITNESSES. THAT 

08:22:52.055 --> 08:22:54.055
IS NOT HOW THIS WORKS. 

08:23:08.503 --> 08:23:10.542
&gt;&gt; THAT IS AMY KLOBUCHAR GOING 
TO THE MEGAPHONE AND TAKING 

08:23:11.298 --> 08:23:13.298
QUESTIONS. 

08:23:14.602 --> 08:23:17.237
SHE CAN REACH VOTERS NOT JUST 
AND I WENT, BUT AROUND THE 

08:23:17.853 --> 08:23:23.536
COUNTRY. WE HAVE BERNIE SANDERS 
AND ELIZABETH WARREN. AND 

08:23:23.739 --> 08:23:28.624
MICHAEL BENNETT WHO IS RUNNING 
AS WELL. IT WAS SO INTERESTING 

08:23:29.021 --> 08:23:32.885
TO HEAR SENATOR KLOBUCHAR PIVOT 
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HER 

08:23:33.645 --> 08:23:38.112
GROUND GAME BACK TO THE QUESTION
OF WHAT HER DUTY IS, TO BE HERE 

08:23:38.255 --> 08:23:41.893
IN WASHINGTON AND BE PART OF THE
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. 

08:23:41.894 --> 08:23:43.894
&gt;&gt;

08:23:45.684 --> 08:23:49.137
SHE IS TRYING TO CREATE A SILVER
LINING OUT OF THE SITUATION FOR 

08:23:49.895 --> 08:23:55.995
HER. I AM PULLING OF THE 
CALENDAR RIGHT NOW. LESS THAN 2 

08:23:56.134 --> 08:24:00.264
WEEKS FOR THE FIRST VOTING 
PROCESS IN IOWA. 

08:24:03.965 --> 08:24:06.068
AFTER THAT, THERE IS A DEBATE 
FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE WEEK 

08:24:06.209 --> 08:24:08.209
AFTER THAT, IS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE
PRIORITY. IT IS ABSOLUTELY 

08:24:08.227 --> 08:24:10.864
CRUCIAL MOMENTS FOR AMY 
KLOBUCHAR AND OTHER SENATORS 

08:24:11.076 --> 08:24:13.663
RUNNING FOR OFFICE. AND OF 
COURSE, THERE ARE FOLKS IN THE 

08:24:13.814 --> 08:24:19.395
HUNT TO WIN IN IOWA. ALL THE 
FOLKS ARE UP IN THE AIR RIGHT 

08:24:20.143 --> 08:24:22.143
NOW. 

08:24:24.277 --> 08:24:28.129
IOWA IS A STATE THAT VALUES ITS 
PLACE IN THE CONTEST. IT 

08:24:28.330 --> 08:24:32.594
APPRECIATE SOME CANDIDATES ARE 
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM. AT YOUR 

08:24:32.810 --> 08:24:36.863
CHURCH AND AT YOUR DINER. 
PUTTING IN THE ENERGY TO WIN YOU

08:24:37.614 --> 08:24:41.744
OVER. THIS IS A COMPLETELY NEW 
DYNAMIC. AMY KLOBUCHAR IS TRY TO

08:24:41.945 --> 08:24:46.612
HAVE A SMILE IN AND SAY I CAN 
HAVE MY SURROGATES TALK TO 

08:24:47.359 --> 08:24:52.454
PEOPLE. AND I DO NOT KNOW MY 
FAMILY WILL DRAW THE ST. CLOUD. 

08:24:52.596 --> 08:24:54.596
&gt;&gt;

08:24:57.993 --> 08:24:59.993
THOSE ARGUING FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WILL ARGUE THE SAME 

08:25:00.361 --> 08:25:02.663
CANDIDATES. SAYING  YOU SHOULD 
BE IN IOWA VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY 

08:25:02.862 --> 08:25:08.561
WENT  DEMOCRATS. THEY HAVE 
REASON TO BE UPSET WITH THE 

08:25:08.962 --> 08:25:10.793
PROCESS. AMY KLOBUCHAR TWEETED 
THIS IS MY CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. 

08:25:10.794 --> 08:25:13.160
I CAN DO BOTH AND DO TWO THINGS 
AT ONCE. 

08:25:20.541 --> 08:25:23.591
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT WAS AN INTERESTING 
MOMENT. ONE OF MY TAKEAWAYS FOR 

08:25:23.791 --> 08:25:29.071
THE WHITE HOUSE TEAM GET INTO 
THE MICROPHONES IS A MADE A 

08:25:29.834 --> 08:25:31.834
PERSONAL. 

08:25:32.936 --> 08:25:36.329
THEY WENT AFTER ADAM SCHIFF. AND
OTHER HOUSE MANAGERS. 

08:25:39.838 --> 08:25:42.270
WAS A LITTLE PROFANITY ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR AFTER THAT. THERE 

08:25:42.485 --> 08:25:45.935
TRY TO MAKE THIS PERSONAL IN A 
WAY THAT TAKES IT TO A WHOLE NEW

08:25:46.135 --> 08:25:48.135
LEVEL POLITICALLY. 

08:25:51.417 --> 08:25:53.452
TO REMIND VIEWERS THE CLINTON 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS SEEN IS NOT

08:25:53.650 --> 08:25:55.886
VERY POLITICAL AT ALL. TO THE 
EXTENT IT COULD BE IN A 

08:25:56.086 --> 08:25:58.086
POLITICAL HOTTIE. 

08:26:00.754 --> 08:26:03.105
AMY KLOBUCHAR IS DOING THE BEST 
YOU CAN TO MAKE MOMENT A 

08:26:03.260 --> 08:26:05.260
POSITIVE. 

08:26:08.270 --> 08:26:11.062
WE KNOW SHE HAS GOTTEN INTO SOME
BACK AND FORTH WITH PETE 

08:26:11.207 --> 08:26:13.960
BUTTIGIEG, A FORMER MAYOR OF A 
SMALL TOWN, ABOUT EXPENSE AND 

08:26:14.721 --> 08:26:20.659
GENDER. SHE HAD A PROMINENT 
MOMENT TODAY, BEING CALLED OUT 

08:26:20.873 --> 08:26:25.339
BY THE WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS. TO 
SAY I TO GOVERN AND KEEP MY EYE 

08:26:25.538 --> 08:26:28.332
ON THE BALL. WHICH IS DEFEATING 
TRUMP IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. 

08:26:28.479 --> 08:26:32.126
&gt;&gt; DID ANYONE ASK AMY KLOBUCHAR

08:26:36.302 --> 08:26:38.949
IF IT IS A FUTILE PROCESS. THEY 
HAVE TAKEN THREE VOTES SO FAR ON

08:26:39.151 --> 08:26:42.803
THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY 
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER. ALL HAVE 

08:26:43.417 --> 08:26:47.884
BEEN TABLED BY THE REPUBLICANS. 
SHE BRUSHED IT OFF AND PUSHED 

08:26:48.085 --> 08:26:53.981
BACK ON IT. TO FOCUS ON THE NEED
FOR MORE INFORMATION. AMBER, 

08:26:54.382 --> 08:26:58.448
WHAT ARE THE POWER DYNAMICS, AS 
YOU WATCH THE DEMOCRATS TRY TO 

08:26:58.649 --> 08:27:01.487
MAKE A CALL FOR MORE 
INFORMATION, AND GET MORE 

08:27:01.700 --> 08:27:06.168
INFORMATION AND FODDER HERE. AND
REPUBLICANS ARE ABLE TO BRUSH IT

08:27:06.368 --> 08:27:10.771
OFF AND VOTE ALONG PARTY LINES. 
&gt;&gt; IS A GREAT QUESTION. THIS 

08:27:10.918 --> 08:27:15.501
AMENDMENT ARE POLITICAL 
STATEMENTS. WE HAVE KNOWN FROM 

08:27:15.715 --> 08:27:18.281
THE VERY BEGINNING FROM IN THE 
TRIAL STARTED,

08:27:22.417 --> 08:27:31.646
WE TALK ABOUT THAT ROMNEY AND 
SUSAN COLLINS MAY VOTE TO 

08:27:32.502 --> 08:27:36.833
SUBPOENA. NOBODY HAS LINED UP 
WITH DEMOCRATS TO SUBPOENA OFF 

08:27:37.034 --> 08:27:39.882
THE BAT. THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM 
DEMOCRATS TO ARGUE AGAINST 

08:27:40.641 --> 08:27:44.503
TRUMP. IT IS IN LINE WITH WHAT 
MITCH McCONNELL WANTS. TO 

08:27:44.652 --> 08:27:49.882
CONVINCE SENATORS. I TALKED TO 
IMPEACHMENT EXPERTS WHO SAID, A 

08:27:50.450 --> 08:27:53.902
MITCH McCONNELL HAS A MAJORITY 
VOTE, HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE 

08:27:54.102 --> 08:27:59.783
WANTS TO SHAPE THE TRIAL WITH 
THE RULES. SO FAR, HE HAS DONE 

08:27:59.997 --> 08:28:02.988
AN IMPRESSIVE JOB OF KEEPING 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN LINE. 

08:28:05.680 --> 08:28:08.316
EVEN THOSE WHO MAY SPLIT IN THE 
FUTURE. AND WE TALKED ABOUT 

08:28:08.527 --> 08:28:12.379
EARLIER, TO PUSH BACK AGAINST 
HIM AGAINST CLOSED DOORS DOES 

08:28:12.593 --> 08:28:15.226
THE RULES. THE POWER DYNAMICS 
ARE BUT DEMOCRATS ARE PLAIN TO 

08:28:15.427 --> 08:28:17.861
THE FIELD OF PUBLIC OPINION. 
THAT DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF 

08:28:18.076 --> 08:28:22.342
OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE ACTUAL 
TRIAL RULES RIGHT NOW. 

08:28:22.343 --> 08:28:26.552
&gt;&gt; AMBER, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE FOR 
REPORTING AS WELL AS ANALYSIS. 

08:28:27.010 --> 08:28:31.877
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON HOW 
DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MANAGERS ARE 

08:28:32.092 --> 08:28:38.179
PERFORMING VERSUS THE WHITE 
HOUSE COUNSEL? DEMOCRATS HAVE 

08:28:38.378 --> 08:28:40.411
HAD AN ORGANIZED APPROACH. THEY 
HAVE HAD VISUAL AID. THEY HAVE 

08:28:40.611 --> 08:28:42.611
HAD VIDEOS. THEY HAVE HAD 
SCREENS. 

08:28:46.097 --> 08:28:48.097
IT IS NOT LIKE HAVING

08:28:51.994 --> 08:28:53.994
THINGS LIKE THAT GIVE YOU A 
GUARANTEED WIN. THEY HAVE 

08:28:54.025 --> 08:28:57.075
CLEARLY DONE THEIR HOMEWORK. AND
HAVE MEAT TO PUT ON THE BONES OF

08:28:57.275 --> 08:29:00.724
WHAT THEY ARE ARGUING. IS 
DIFFERENT THAN THE MESSAGE WE 

08:29:00.925 --> 08:29:03.811
GET FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL, WHICH IS MUCH MORE 

08:29:04.005 --> 08:29:08.400
ABOUT THE RHETORIC, RATHER THAN 
LET ME LAY OUT THE FACTS, ABOUT 

08:29:08.594 --> 08:29:12.505
WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE ARGUING. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY 

08:29:12.705 --> 08:29:17.185
RIGHT. YOU SET IT FOR ME. I FEEL
LIKE HOUSE MANAGERS ARE 

08:29:17.386 --> 08:29:23.001
PREPARING FOR THIS ON WHAT SINCE
NANCY PELOSI GO TO MICROPHONE. 

08:29:23.485 --> 08:29:29.112
IN OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER 
COMPLAINT EXISTED. IT IS A 

08:29:29.257 --> 08:29:31.399
FOREGONE CONCLUSION THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE THE 

08:29:32.157 --> 08:29:34.157
MAJORITY. 

08:32:07.065 --> 08:32:14.362
SHE IS RIGHT HE HAS BEEN A 
TARGET SINCE THAT PUBLIC PHASE 

08:32:15.115 --> 08:32:18.839
FROM REPUBLICANS, AND SENATE 
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SAID, HE 

08:32:19.240 --> 08:32:21.588
KIND OF CONSTRUCT A SCAM AND

08:32:25.535 --> 08:32:27.983
LED THE PROCESS HE IS A PUNCHING
BAG FOR REPUBLICANS BUT, THAT IS

08:32:28.183 --> 08:32:33.666
A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING FROM WHITE HOUSE 

08:32:33.867 --> 08:32:35.900
COUNSEL. WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE, IF THEY HAVE ANY MORE 

08:32:36.100 --> 08:32:38.842
ARGUMENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE
CHARGES DID TRUMP

08:32:44.017 --> 08:32:46.048
WITHHOLD AID FROM UKRAINE WE 
HAVE NOT HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT 

08:32:46.249 --> 08:32:48.700
THAT MUCH OTHER THAN TO SAY THIS
PROCESS HAVE BEEN A SCAM FROM 

08:32:48.897 --> 08:32:53.768
THE BEGINNING AND THE OTHER 
HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE BEEN TODAY, 

08:32:53.970 --> 08:32:56.417
THEY DO APPEAR TO BE A UNIFIED 
FRONT WILL HAVE BEEN VERY WELL 

08:32:56.623 --> 08:32:58.623
PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT AND

08:33:02.309 --> 08:33:04.339
THEY SAY, WE WERE VERY FAMILIAR 
WITH ADAM SCHIFF, WE WERE 

08:33:04.741 --> 08:33:07.335
FAMILIAR WITH JERRY NADLER WE 
HEARD VOICES AND THE LAST FEW 

08:33:07.479 --> 08:33:16.727
MONTHS, WE NOW SEE HIM, AND SHOW
HOW PREPARED SHE IS AND KEEP HER

08:33:16.928 --> 08:33:20.589
STATEMENTS TIGHT AND CONCISE AND
TRYING TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM 

08:33:20.792 --> 08:33:25.095
EVIDENCE THEY HAVE JUDY 
ARGUMENTS AND DONE IMPEACHABLE 

08:33:26.026 --> 08:33:28.806
MISCONDUCT AND, WHEN SHE WAS 
THERE,

08:33:35.628 --> 08:33:37.854
A FEW HOURS AGO SHE TALKED ABOUT
HER EXPERIENCES WITH THE OTHER 

08:33:38.055 --> 08:33:39.989
IMPEACHMENT, THE NIXON 
IMPEACHMENT AND SO, HAVE 

08:33:39.990 --> 08:33:44.143
SEASONED VOICES COMING TO THE 
DEBATE STAND TODAY WITH 

08:33:44.355 --> 08:33:47.231
DOCUMENTS AND READY WITH THE 
PROOF AND IT SHOWS THEY ARE 

08:33:47.604 --> 08:33:52.672
PREPARED NOW, WHEN THE DATA 
MEASUREMENT WE WILL SEE IN THE 

08:33:52.889 --> 08:33:56.543
NEXT FEW DAYS. ARIGHT, RHONDA 
COLEMAN ON CAPITOL HILL THANK 

08:33:56.741 --> 08:34:02.017
YOU, SO MUCH RED NATIONAL 
REPORTER FOR THE POST JOINING 

08:34:02.235 --> 08:34:10.751
US, BY PHONE. YOU HAVE BEEN 
TRACKING, DETAILS, THAT THE 

08:34:11.170 --> 08:34:16.448
LAWYERS FOR TRUMP HAVE BEEN 
LAYING OUT AND FACT CHECKING 

08:34:16.648 --> 08:34:18.885
THEM IN REAL TIME, WATCHING TO 
SEE THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THEY 

08:34:19.085 --> 08:34:23.891
HAVE BEEN DECLARING. WHAT ARE 
YOUR THOUGHTS, SO FAR? MY MAIN 

08:34:24.039 --> 08:34:31.028
THOUGHT, THEY HAVE CLOSELY HAVE 
RHETORIC DEPLOYED IN VARIOUS 

08:34:31.194 --> 08:34:35.947
DOCUMENTS AND WHICH IS TO SAY, 
THE ATTORNEYS HAVE LARGELY 

08:34:36.148 --> 08:34:39.442
AVOIDED AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
REPUBLICANS COMING AROUND TO 

08:34:39.809 --> 08:34:43.861
TALKING MORE ABOUT THAT 
ALLEGATIONS AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN

08:34:44.077 --> 08:34:48.942
MUCH OF THAT AT ALL. WE HAVE 
SEEN RHETORIC ABOUT THE PROCESS 

08:34:49.144 --> 08:34:55.641
ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS DO WHAT THEY
OUGHT TO HAVE DONE, AND A YOU 

08:34:55.858 --> 08:35:00.527
AND I SPOKE ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE 
REINFORCED AND AMPLE MICE THE 

08:35:00.723 --> 08:35:03.575
MESSAGE THAT TRUMP SOUGHT 
HIMSELF THAT'S NOT ACCIDENTAL. 

08:35:03.782 --> 08:35:08.640
WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM REALLY 
ACTUALLY WHAT IS ALLEGED ABOUT 

08:35:08.854 --> 08:35:11.893
THE CALL AND THAT'S NOT 
ACCURATE. THAT IS ALIGNED 

08:35:12.308 --> 08:35:17.378
RHETORIC AND I'M CURIOUS OVER 
THE COURSE OF THIS, IF WE WILL 

08:35:18.143 --> 08:35:22.860
SEE THAT. 
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CURIOUS TO SEE WHO 

08:35:23.072 --> 08:35:26.325
TAKES WHAT ROLE? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS ON THE FIRST 

08:35:27.088 --> 08:35:33.578
EXCHANGE, THE TWO LEAD ATTORNEYS
, WENT BACK AND FORTH, THEY 

08:35:33.733 --> 08:35:35.733
REITERATED THE SAME POINT OVER 
AND,

08:35:39.525 --> 08:35:45.012
BASICALLY THEY SAID THE SAME 
THINGS, IT WAS HARD TO 

08:35:45.213 --> 08:35:50.432
DIFFERENTIATE WHO IS DOING WHAT,
HERE? THEY DID SHAKE OUT ON THE 

08:35:50.578 --> 08:35:54.752
DEMOCRATIC SIDE I HAVE NOT SEEN 
MUCH OF THAT ON THE SIDE OF THE 

08:35:54.968 --> 08:35:59.575
PRESIDENT AND, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, 
THERE IS A GOD SEEN AS TO EIGHT,

08:36:01.456 --> 08:36:05.320
IT IS FROM LAWYER AND ABSTRACT 
AT THE SAME SIDE. THE ARGUMENT 

08:36:05.722 --> 08:36:08.979
WE'VE HEARD TODAY ARE ONES THAT 
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP THIS TIME 

08:36:09.181 --> 08:36:13.443
BY THE PRESIDENT, TEAM WHERE ARE
THEY GOING WITH THIS? WHAT IS 

08:36:13.644 --> 08:36:19.134
THE STRATEGY. .MAC A LOT OF 
TIMES, HAVE NOT HEARD FROM KEN 

08:36:19.329 --> 08:36:22.583
STARR, WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 
DERSHOWITZ, LAY OUT FOR US LET 

08:36:22.784 --> 08:36:25.231
ME KNOW ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE 
INVOLVED? 

08:36:25.232 --> 08:36:30.099
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
OBVIOUSLY STAR HAS A NUMBER 

08:36:30.304 --> 08:36:33.912
SOMEONE OF EXPERIENCE IN DEALING
WITH IMPEACHMENT. PEOPLE ARE NO 

08:36:34.062 --> 08:36:39.033
DOUBT FAMILIAR WITH THAT FROM 
THE CLINTON ERA. HIS ROLE WILL 

08:36:39.236 --> 08:36:41.479
BE LIMITED IN THE SENSE HE WILL 
PRESENT AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE 

08:36:42.246 --> 08:36:44.246
IMPEACHMENT BROADLY.

08:36:46.551 --> 08:36:49.200
HE SAID COME HE WAS NOT PART OF 
THE LEGAL TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY

08:36:49.400 --> 08:36:51.400
CLEAR. AGAIN, I THINK IT'S

08:36:55.283 --> 08:36:57.319
LOVABLY SAFE TO ASSUME, STAR 
WILL DO HEAVY LIFTING IN TERMS 

08:36:57.520 --> 08:37:02.602
OF THE RHETORICAL RESPONSES. BY 
VIRTUE OF WHO HE IS AND WHAT IS 

08:37:03.003 --> 08:37:05.438
BACK ON THE BUT AGAIN, TODAY WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A DEBATE ABOUT 

08:37:05.642 --> 08:37:09.908
RULES AND THAT IS GOING FURTHER 
THAN THAT AND A LOT OF 

08:37:10.119 --> 08:37:11.900
DISCUSSIONS. THERE'S SOME 
REPORTING SUGGESTED PERHAPS 

08:37:11.901 --> 08:37:17.422
TRUMP CAME IS CAUGHT OFFGUARD, 
BY THAT. I DON'T KNOW. WE ARE 

08:37:18.382 --> 08:37:21.702
EXPERIENCING THIS WE WILL SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS. WE ARE 

08:37:21.892 --> 08:37:25.044
EXPERIENCING IT TOGETHER WE WILL
HEAD BACK IN.

08:37:29.615 --> 08:37:32.052
WE MISSED THIS MORNING AND, LAST
WEEK FOR A FAMILY ISSUE. HE IS 

08:37:32.261 --> 08:37:38.095
THERE NOW. SO, HE REPORTED, 
TODAY ABOUT HOW AMERICANS ARE 

08:37:38.250 --> 08:37:44.039
DEALING AND OPINION POLLS ABOUT 
THIS PROCESS. CAN YOU BREAK DOWN

08:37:44.239 --> 08:37:46.239
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT AMERICANS

08:37:49.317 --> 08:37:52.111
WANT TO HEAR FROM HER WHAT THEY 
THINK SHOULD HAPPEN, IN THIS 

08:37:52.258 --> 08:37:54.258
PROCESS? BREAKDOWN FOR US.

08:37:57.447 --> 08:38:00.246
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A POLL RELEASED 
YESTERDAY WHICH FOUND VARIOUS 

08:38:00.396 --> 08:38:04.963
DETERMINATIONS. THEY BELIEVE 
THERE SHOULD BE WITNESSES. IF 

08:38:05.165 --> 08:38:08.615
YOU GO INTO THAT YOU QUICKLY 
REALIZE, PERHAPS THAT DOES NOT 

08:38:09.580 --> 08:38:13.642
SEEM, FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A 
SUBSEQUENT QUESTION WHY DO 

08:38:13.791 --> 08:38:19.188
DEMOCRATS [ INDISCERNIBLE ] WANT
A FAIR TRIAL OR ARE THEY NAILING

08:38:19.392 --> 08:38:22.190
REPUBLICANS TO THE WELL? THEY 
ARE TRYING TO HAMMER 

08:38:22.348 --> 08:38:27.706
REPUBLICANS. THEY WANT TO SEE 
THE DEMOCRATIC WITNESSES. THEY 

08:38:27.910 --> 08:38:33.393
WERE TO SEE VERY SPECIFIC 
WITNESSES MAYBE, JOE BIDEN. IF 

08:38:33.612 --> 08:38:35.612
YOU GO DEEPER INTO EACH OF THESE

08:38:38.874 --> 08:38:40.911
POLLS, ANOTHER POLL CANNOT 
TODAY, WHAT YOU SEE IS A PATTERN

08:38:41.117 --> 08:38:43.705
WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN. WHICH IS

08:38:48.015 --> 08:38:50.015
BY VERY SLIM MAJORITY AND, OR 
HALF THE POPULATION BELIEVES 

08:38:50.048 --> 08:38:53.718
TRUMP SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM 
OFFICE. THAT IS SPLIT HEAVILY 

08:38:53.913 --> 08:38:55.947
ALONG THE SAME PARTY LINES WE 
HAVE SEEN SINCE TRUMP TOOK 

08:38:56.154 --> 08:38:59.598
OFFICE IN 2017. DEMOCRATS WANT 
TO REMOVE HIM AND REPUBLICANS 

08:39:00.358 --> 08:39:05.848
ARE OPPOSED. INDEPENDENT LIVING 
WITH DEMOCRATS. YET, ONE OF THE 

08:39:05.999 --> 08:39:11.062
THINGS, NATIONALLY, AND SWING 
COUNTIES,

08:39:14.840 --> 08:39:16.865
PEOPLE ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF 
REMOVING TRUMP FROM OFFICE THE A

08:39:17.064 --> 08:39:21.066
APPROVING OF HIS JOB PERFORMANCE
AND YET, THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE 

08:39:21.216 --> 08:39:24.327
SEEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT 
MEANS. HAD 

08:39:24.328 --> 08:39:28.446
&gt;&gt;  YET, I WONDER HOW MUCH SLEEP
AROUND STATES REPUBLICANS WILL 

08:39:29.207 --> 08:39:31.207
HAVE TO WAIT DISINFORMATION AND

08:39:38.198 --> 08:39:40.031
THAT WILL BE LISTENING TO 
CONSTITUENTS THE ASK QUESTIONS 

08:39:40.032 --> 08:39:42.032
OR DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE 
PRESCRIBER SEEMS TO GET 

08:39:42.050 --> 08:39:43.889
WITNESSES AND HOW DOES THIS 
PROCESS ABOUT FULLER BETTING. 

08:39:43.890 --> 08:39:48.552
CREEK WILL BE WATCHING? 
&gt;&gt; SO, OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE 

08:39:48.751 --> 08:39:54.438
PEOPLE AT MITT ROMNEY REPRESENT 
STATES THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY 

08:39:54.853 --> 08:39:57.038
SUPER EXCITED ABOUT TRUMP. UTAH

08:40:02.159 --> 08:40:04.601
HAD THE BEST WING FROM RED TO 
BLUE IN 2016 THAT WITH THE 

08:40:04.808 --> 08:40:08.660
PENSION AND PART OF HAVING BEEN 
RUNNING IN 2012. THAT'S ALSO A 

08:40:08.862 --> 08:40:10.862
FUNCTION OF THE GENERAL DISTASTE
FOR TRUMP.

08:40:16.386 --> 08:40:18.428
I THINK EVERYBODY WILL PAY 
ATTENTION AND WHEN I WILL BE 

08:40:18.620 --> 08:40:21.048
WATCHING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY 
SIGN OF ANY MOVEMENT AT ALL FROM

08:40:21.263 --> 08:40:23.492
SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT IN ONE OF 
THOSE DATES. IF THERE'S ANY 

08:40:23.699 --> 08:40:28.052
SENSE THAT ARE CRACKED SHOWING, 
SO FAR EXTREMELY ROBUSTLY SIGNED

08:40:29.793 --> 08:40:32.564
DEFENSE WHICH IS REALLY 
DEPENDING ON CONSERVATIVE MEDIA 

08:40:32.711 --> 08:40:38.314
AND GROUNDS AT CRITICISM THAT 
EXIST ARE ANY CRACKS WHO ARE NOT

08:40:39.081 --> 08:40:44.211
NECESSARILY VERBAL, OBVIOUSLY 
THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT I'M 

08:40:44.418 --> 08:40:48.277
SKEPTICAL WE WILL SEE ANY SUCH 
CRACK. SOMETHING WE WILL KEEP AN

08:40:49.042 --> 08:40:55.750
EYE ON. WE'VE SEEN SO FAR 
REPUBLICANS FINISH AND THREE 

08:40:55.900 --> 08:40:57.900
AMENDMENTS.

08:41:00.870 --> 08:41:02.870
SCHUMER WAS TRYING TO GET 
INFORMATION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

08:41:03.449 --> 08:41:06.153
AND STATE DEPARTMENT, FROM 
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET,

08:41:06.345 --> 08:41:08.345
BUT THEY WERE TABLED LONG

08:41:13.059 --> 08:41:15.082
PARTY LINES WITH 53-47. THE NEXT
AMENDMENT THEY WILL BE DEBATING 

08:41:15.284 --> 08:41:18.337
OR ARGUING REALLY, IS THE 
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT, THE 

08:41:19.097 --> 08:41:23.154
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF USED TO 
HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP THERE

08:41:23.337 --> 08:41:26.456
AND PHILIP WHEN YOU MAKE OF THE 
BACK-AND-FORTH PROCESS AND 

08:41:27.408 --> 08:41:29.408
SENATORS LISTENING

08:41:30.924 --> 08:41:32.757
. WE ARE GETTING TO HEAR 
DEMOCRATIC SIDES MAKING 

08:41:32.758 --> 08:41:36.009
ARGUMENTS AND REPUBLICANS READ 
BUT AND VICE VERSA. ARE YOU 

08:41:36.210 --> 08:41:39.817
LEARNING ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
GENERAL APPROACH ABOUT THE 

08:41:39.981 --> 08:41:41.981
PROCESS?

08:41:44.743 --> 08:41:46.743
AS I SAID EARLIER, IT IS 
INTERESTING HOW THE DEMOCRATIC 

08:41:46.777 --> 08:41:49.817
STRATEGY, HOW DO LITIGATE THE 
IMPEACHMENT BROADLY AND NOT JUST

08:41:50.582 --> 08:41:52.582
OPPOSE IT

08:41:53.881 --> 08:41:56.327
. I THINK THAT IS IN PART A 
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THEY 

08:41:56.517 --> 08:41:59.371
WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST WATCHED 
DAYS OF THE TRIAL IN ONE OF THE 

08:42:00.136 --> 08:42:06.170
MOST COVERED. WE SAW THAT, YOU 
KNOW AND THAT SAID, I THINK THAT

08:42:09.326 --> 08:42:11.342
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER ONE 
OF THE KEY AUDIENCES HERE, IN 

08:42:11.556 --> 08:42:17.181
THAT THE TRIAL PROBABLY MORE 
THAN 1999 WITH CLINTON EITHER IS

08:42:17.324 --> 08:42:24.063
WHAT IS PLAYED ON CABLE NEWS. I 
AM NOT, I AM CYNICAL BUT

08:42:28.611 --> 08:42:30.611
OBVIOUSLY, SOME OF WHAT, FOR 
EXAMPLE TRUMP DEFENDERS ARE 

08:42:31.002 --> 08:42:35.317
DOING TODAY. WHAT WILL AIR ON 
FOX NEWS AND YOU KNOW, BE SHARED

08:42:35.530 --> 08:42:38.976
BY TRUMP SUPPORTERS, IN THE 
SENSE OF THE PRESIDENT, THAT 

08:42:39.184 --> 08:42:41.231
REALLY IS GOING TO BE KEY. 
POLLING DOES SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE

08:42:41.418 --> 08:42:47.300
WHO ARE MORE CLOSELY CHIN THE 
FOX NEWS ARE MORE LIKELY TO 

08:42:47.502 --> 08:42:51.970
REJECT THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. 
THAT WILL BE THE KEY FOR TRUMP 

08:42:52.190 --> 08:42:55.221
KEEPING SENATORS IN LINE. IF 
THERE'S NO MOVEMENT IN THE 

08:42:55.432 --> 08:42:57.432
REPUBLICAN BASE THEY ARE MUCH 
MORE LIKELY

08:43:01.109 --> 08:43:04.244
AND IF THERE IS NO MOVEMENT IN 
THAT BASE, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO

08:43:05.591 --> 08:43:08.024
CONTRARY VOTES IS HEARD ON FOX 
NEWS AS WELL, THAT IS A GOOD 

08:43:08.227 --> 08:43:11.477
TIME AND I THINK THAT'S THE 
STRATEGY ON THEIR ENGINE ON THE 

08:43:11.673 --> 08:43:15.270
DEMOCRATS I DID SOMETHING 
SIMILAR. LESS CRITICAL THAT THEY

08:43:15.414 --> 08:43:21.630
GET COVERED AND BUT, I THINK IT 
PART OF THE STRATEGY TO GET THAT

08:43:21.840 --> 08:43:28.140
MESSAGE OUT THERE BROADLY, NOT 
TO THE SENATORS, IN THE RAMP. WE

08:43:28.339 --> 08:43:31.187
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE MEMBERS
BE ATTENTIVE AND HOPEFULLY, NOT 

08:43:31.945 --> 08:43:37.076
FALL ASLEEP TOO OFTEN. WE ARE 
WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE IF 

08:43:37.274 --> 08:43:41.123
ANYBODY DOES THAT. THEY STAY 
FOCUSED AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE, 

08:43:41.338 --> 08:43:43.979
JOHN ROBERTS NEEDS TO STAY 
FOCUSED HE'S USED TO BEING ABLE 

08:43:44.732 --> 08:43:49.259
TO ENTER CHECK. HE IS A MUCH 
MORE DYNAMIC, INTERACTIVE 

08:43:49.459 --> 08:43:52.308
EXPERIENCE BRITT TELL US ABOUT 
HIS ROLE AND WHAT YOU ARE 

08:43:53.072 --> 08:43:55.072
WATCHING. 
&gt;&gt;

08:43:57.996 --> 08:44:03.468
HE MAYBE GOT TIPS FROM CLARENCE 
THOMAS. IT'S PROBABLY MUCH 

08:44:03.681 --> 08:44:06.734
EASIER FOR HIM IF ANYBODY IS 
USED TO SITTING AND LISTENING. 

08:44:06.931 --> 08:44:12.217
HE HAS HARDLY SPOKEN A WORD. IN 
A WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS 

08:44:12.419 --> 08:44:17.901
TAKEN A SEAT BACK AGAIN WE WILL 
HAVE TO WATCH FOR OURSELVES. 

08:44:18.109 --> 08:44:20.945
THANK YOU, SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
TIME, PHILIP. LET'S GO BACK. 

08:44:21.547 --> 08:44:28.052
&gt;&gt; MY NAME IS JEFFRIES, AND THE 
HONOR OF REPRESENTING, THE 

08:44:28.260 --> 08:44:32.062
EIGHTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN AND 

08:44:32.209 --> 08:44:38.174
QUEENS. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST 
DIVERSE DISTRICTS, IN THE 

08:44:38.332 --> 08:44:44.919
NATION. IN FACT BEEN TOLD THAT 
THE NINTH MOST AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

08:44:45.114 --> 08:44:52.233
DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY AND THE 
16th MOST JEWISH. ON THE HILL, 

08:44:52.432 --> 08:44:59.939
SOME FOLKS HAVE SAID, IS THAT 
COMPLICATED? IS MY FRED LYNN 

08:45:00.154 --> 08:45:07.463
GOLDENBERG SAYS AT HOME, YOU GOT
THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. YOU SEE

08:45:07.661 --> 08:45:12.742
IN AMERICA, DIVERSITY IS A 
STRENGTH. IT IS NOT A WEAKNESS. 

08:45:13.143 --> 08:45:17.782
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BINDS US 
TOGETHER, ALL OF US. AS 

08:45:17.966 --> 08:45:22.897
AMERICANS, REGARDLESS OF RACE, 
REGARDLESS OF RELIGION REGARDS 

08:45:23.655 --> 08:45:27.500
THE REGION AND SEXUAL 
ORIENTATION, REGARDLESS OF 

08:45:27.643 --> 08:45:35.287
GENDER, IS THAT, WE BELIEVE IN 
THE RULE OF LAW. WE BELIEVE IN 

08:45:35.485 --> 08:45:40.568
THE IMPORTANCE OF A FAIR TRIAL. 
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS 

08:45:41.542 --> 08:45:46.662
AMENDMENT INCLUDING, WITH 
RESPECT TO MICK MULVANEY. WHO 

08:45:46.859 --> 08:45:50.255
HAS EVER HEARD OF A TRIAL, WITH 
NO WITNESSES?

08:45:53.976 --> 08:45:56.105
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SOME ARE 
CONTEMPLATING HERE TODAY. THIS

08:46:01.688 --> 08:46:03.525
AMENDMENT WOULD ADDRESS THE 
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IT WOULD ENSURE

08:46:03.526 --> 08:46:05.359
THE TRIAL INCLUDES TESTIMONY 
FROM A KEY WITNESS THAT 

08:46:05.360 --> 08:46:09.607
PRESIDENTS ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF
AND HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF 

08:46:09.831 --> 08:46:13.578
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET. MICK 
MULVANEY. IT WOULD

08:46:17.126 --> 08:46:18.758
MAKE SURE THE SENATE WOULD 
CONSIDER HIS TESTIMONY, 

08:46:18.759 --> 08:46:23.424
IMMEDIATELY. LET'S DISCUSS WHY 
THEY NEED TO HEAR FROM MULVANEY 

08:46:24.039 --> 08:46:28.868
SO CRITICAL. THE RESOLUTION 
UNDERCUTS MORE THAN 200 YEARS, 

08:46:29.015 --> 08:46:35.618
SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
PRACTICE. IT DEPARTS FROM EVERY 

08:46:35.837 --> 08:46:40.035
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL CONDUCTED TO 
DATE. IT GOES AGAINST THE SENATE

08:46:40.184 --> 08:46:42.184
ON

08:46:44.140 --> 08:46:45.926
LONG-STANDING IMPEACHMENT RULE 
WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE 

08:46:45.927 --> 08:46:51.861
POSSIBILITY OF NEW WITNESS 
TESTIMONY. IN FACT, IT DEPARTS 

08:46:52.062 --> 08:46:57.966
FROM ANY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL TRIAL
PROCEDURE, IN AMERICA. WHY 

08:46:58.726 --> 08:47:03.147
SHOULD THIS PRESIDENT BE HELD, 
TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD?

08:47:06.685 --> 08:47:08.315
SECOND, THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
FOR WITNESS TESTIMONY, IS 

08:47:08.316 --> 08:47:11.975
NECESSARY IN LIGHT OF THE 
PRESIDENT DETERMINED EFFORT TO 

08:47:12.172 --> 08:47:18.283
BURY THE EVIDENCE, AND TO RUB 
HIS CORRUPT ABUSE OF POWER. THE 

08:47:19.032 --> 08:47:21.032
HOUSE DRIED, TO GET

08:47:23.767 --> 08:47:27.617
MR. MULVANEY'S TESTIMONY. WE 
SUBPOENAED HIM. TOGETHER WITH 

08:47:27.819 --> 08:47:31.881
OTHER KEY WITNESSES, NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON, 

08:47:32.286 --> 08:47:35.266
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE AIDE ROBERT 
BLAIR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND 

08:47:35.424 --> 08:47:40.753
BUDGET FACIAL MICHAEL DUFFY AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNSELOR, DON

08:47:40.905 --> 08:47:44.683
EISENBERG. THEY WERE CALLED TO 
TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE, AS 

08:47:44.885 --> 08:47:46.885
PART OF THIS PIECE GO

08:47:49.956 --> 08:47:51.956
. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
DETERMINED TO HIDE FROM THE 

08:47:52.558 --> 08:47:56.257
AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHAT THEY HAD 
TO SAY. THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED 

08:47:57.020 --> 08:48:03.369
THE ENTIRE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND
ALL IS TOP AIDES AND ADVISORS TO

08:48:03.578 --> 08:48:08.999
DEFINE ALL REQUESTS, FOR THEIR 
TESTIMONY. THAT, CANNOT BE 

08:48:09.145 --> 08:48:11.145
ALLOWED, TO STAND.

08:48:13.728 --> 08:48:18.596
MR. MULVANEY IS A HIGHLY 
RELEVANT WITNESS IN THIS TRIAL. 

08:48:18.998 --> 08:48:23.264
MR. MULVANEY WAS AT THE CENTER 
OF EVERY STAGE OF THE PRESIDENT 

08:48:23.679 --> 08:48:28.303
SUBSTANTIAL PRESSURE CAMPAIGN, 
AGAINST UKRAINE. BASED ON THE 

08:48:28.447 --> 08:48:33.016
EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE THE HOUSE DID
OBTAIN, IT IS CLEAR THAT 

08:48:33.433 --> 08:48:39.116
MULVANEY WAS CRUCIAL IN PLANNING
AND EXECUTING LIMITATION AND 

08:48:39.521 --> 08:48:45.140
CARRYING OUT THE COVER UP. 
EMAILS AND TESTIMONY SHALL, MR. 

08:48:45.303 --> 08:48:49.373
MULVANEY WAS IN THE LOOP ON THE 
DECISION.

08:48:56.171 --> 08:48:57.802
THE WHITE HOUSE LEADING ON 
UKRAINE'S ENOUGH OF 

08:48:57.803 --> 08:48:59.925
INVESTIGATION BENEFICIAL TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S REELECTION PROSPECT.

08:49:02.470 --> 08:49:04.787
HE WAS CLOSELY INVOLVED IN 
IMPLEMENTING THE PRESIDENT

08:49:08.568 --> 08:49:10.568
WILL CALL ON SECURITY ASSISTANT 
AND SUBSEQUENTLY, ADMITTED, THAT

08:49:10.609 --> 08:49:16.891
THE FUNDING WAS WITHHELD THE 
BOOK PRESSURE ON UKRAINE. TO 

08:49:17.648 --> 08:49:20.556
CONDUCT PHONY POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATION THAT THE PRESIDENT

08:49:21.323 --> 08:49:26.849
WANTED. PHONY POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATION. A TRIAL WOULD NOT

08:49:27.461 --> 08:49:32.336
BE COMPLETE WITHOUT THE 
TESTIMONY OF MICK MULVANEY  MAKE

08:49:33.108 --> 08:49:37.211
NO MISTAKE THE EVIDENTIARY 
RECORD WE HAVE BUILT, IS 

08:49:37.411 --> 08:49:42.079
POWERFUL AND CAN CLEARLY 
ESTABLISH THE PRESIDENT'S GUILT 

08:49:42.496 --> 08:49:46.092
ON BOTH OF THE ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT. IT'S HARDLY 

08:49:46.237 --> 08:49:49.953
COMPLETE. THE RECORD COMES TO 
YOU WITHOUT TESTIMONY OF

08:49:53.460 --> 08:49:56.304
MR. MULVANEY, AND OTHER 
IMPORTANT WITNESSES.  AND, THAT 

08:49:56.499 --> 08:50:01.181
BRINGS ME TO ONE, FINAL 
PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION. THE 

08:50:01.380 --> 08:50:04.978
AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE, THAT 
THERE CANNOT BE A FAIR TRIAL, 

08:50:05.128 --> 08:50:07.128
WITHOUT

08:50:08.687 --> 08:50:10.721
HEARING FROM WITNESSES WHO HAVE 
RELEVANT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE.

08:50:11.480 --> 08:50:17.423
THE CONSTITUTION, OUR DEMOCRACY,
THE SENATE, THE PRESIDENT, AND 

08:50:18.196 --> 08:50:24.528
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, DESERVE A FAIR TRIAL. 

08:50:24.943 --> 08:50:29.217
FAIR TRIAL REQUIRES WITNESSES. 
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE TRUTH, 

08:50:29.411 --> 08:50:35.044
THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT
THE TRUTH. THAT'S WHY THIS 

08:50:35.189 --> 08:50:42.617
AMENDMENT, SHOULD BE ADOPTED. 
BEFORE WE DISCUSS MIX KNOWLEDGE 

08:50:42.814 --> 08:50:47.658
OF THE PRESIDENTS GEOPOLITICAL 
TAKEDOWN, IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

08:50:47.797 --> 08:50:49.797
NOTE

08:50:52.158 --> 08:50:54.197
THAT CANNOT BE A TRIAL BY 
WITNESSES, IT WOULD BE A 

08:50:54.400 --> 08:50:57.447
STUNNING DEPARTURE FROM THIS 
INSTITUTION, AND PRACTICE. THIS 

08:50:57.645 --> 08:51:02.406
DISTINGUISHED BODY, HAS 
CONDUCTED 15 IMPEACHMENT TRIALS.

08:51:03.732 --> 08:51:10.232
ALL, HAVE INCLUDED WITNESSES. 
SOMETIMES THOSE TRIALS INCLUDED 

08:51:11.007 --> 08:51:13.007
A HANDFUL OF WITNESSES.

08:51:16.136 --> 08:51:21.769
OTHER TIMES, THEY INCLUDED 
DOZENS, IN ONE CASE THERE WERE 

08:51:21.924 --> 08:51:26.791
OVER 100 DIFFERENT WITNESSES. AT
THE SLIDESHOWS,

08:51:30.749 --> 08:51:32.749
THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF WITNESSES 
TO APPEAR, AND A SENATE 

08:51:32.778 --> 08:51:34.778
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, 33.

08:51:40.095 --> 08:51:41.929
IN A LIST THREE OF THOSE 
INSTANCES INCLUDING THE 

08:51:41.930 --> 08:51:43.930
IMPEACHMENT OF BILL CLINTON, 
WITNESSES APPEARED BEFORE THE 

08:51:44.057 --> 08:51:50.857
SENATE WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY 
APPEARED, FOR THE HOUSE. THAT'S 

08:51:51.070 --> 08:51:54.017
BECAUSE THE SENATE, THIS GREAT 
INSTITUTION,

08:51:58.989 --> 08:52:00.608
IS ALWAYS TAKEN ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ADMINISTER A 

08:52:00.609 --> 08:52:04.670
FAIR TRIAL SERIOUSLY. THE SENATE
HAS ALWAYS TAKEN ITS DUTY TO 

08:52:04.870 --> 08:52:08.540
OBTAIN EVIDENCE, INCLUDING 
WITNESS TESTIMONY SERIOUSLY. THE

08:52:08.743 --> 08:52:12.807
SENATE HAS ALWAYS TAKEN THE 
OBLIGATION TO EVALUATE THE 

08:52:13.569 --> 08:52:17.271
PRESIDENT CONDIT BASED ON THE 
FULL BODY OF AVAILABLE 

08:52:18.037 --> 08:52:22.354
INFORMATION SERIOUSLY. THIS IS 
THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE, 

08:52:23.310 --> 08:52:27.566
FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS FOR 
EVERYONE INVOLVED. RESPECTFULLY,

08:52:28.842 --> 08:52:33.754
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HONOR THAT 
UNBROKEN PRESENT TODAY SO THAT 

08:52:34.485 --> 08:52:39.613
MR. MULVANEY'S TESTIMONY WITHOUT
FEAR OR FAVOR, AS TO WHAT YOU 

08:52:40.373 --> 08:52:45.604
MIGHT SAY, CAN INFORM THIS 
DISTINGUISHED BODY OF AMERICANS.

08:52:48.293 --> 08:52:53.377
THIS AMENDMENT IS IMPORTANT TO 
COUNTER THE PRESIDENT'S 

08:52:53.573 --> 08:52:57.843
DETERMINATION TO BURY THE 
EVIDENCE OF HIS HIGH CRIME AND 

08:52:58.000 --> 08:53:00.000
MISDEMEANORS.

08:53:02.166 --> 08:53:07.437
AS WE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL TODAY,
DESPITE CONSIDER EVIDENCE BY THE

08:53:08.207 --> 08:53:12.926
HOUSE, TRUMP DIRECTED THE ENTIRE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TO EXECUTE A 

08:53:13.692 --> 08:53:20.751
COVER UP. HE HAS ORDERED THE 
ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION, TO IGNORE

08:53:21.252 --> 08:53:26.938
THE POWERS OF CONGRESS AND ABLE 
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO 

08:53:27.698 --> 08:53:33.847
INVESTIGATE HIS OFFENSES IN A 
MANNER THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN 

08:53:34.062 --> 08:53:36.686
AMERICAN HISTORY. IT WAS 71 
REQUESTED BY THE HOUSE FOR 

08:53:37.453 --> 08:53:42.787
RELEVANT EVIDENCE. IN RESPONSE, 
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESUMED ZERO 

08:53:43.750 --> 08:53:49.032
DOCUMENTS. 71 REQUEST,

08:53:55.313 --> 08:53:59.232
ZERO DOCUMENTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS PERSONALLY POSSIBLE FOR [ 

08:53:59.445 --> 08:54:03.859
INDISCERNIBLE ] THE SENATE OF 
INFORMATION IMPORTANT TO 

08:54:04.008 --> 08:54:10.139
CONSIDER IN THIS TRIAL. THIS 
POINT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WHEN

08:54:10.312 --> 08:54:14.070
FACED WITH CONGRESSIONAL 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PROCESS SET 

08:54:14.831 --> 08:54:18.123
FOR THE BY THE FRAMERS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE NUMBER 

08:54:18.326 --> 08:54:24.724
ONE, THE PRESIDENT REFUSED TO 
COMPLAIN ANY RESPECT. HE ORDERED

08:54:25.844 --> 08:54:34.383
HIS SENIOR AIDE, TO FALL IN 
LINE. AS SHOWN ON THE SLIDE AS A

08:54:34.585 --> 08:54:37.434
RESULT OF TRUMP'S OBSTRUCTION, 
12 KEY WITNESSES INCLUDING MR. 

08:54:38.192 --> 08:54:41.483
MULVANEY, REFUSED TO APPEAR FOR 
TESTIMONY AND THE HOUSES 

08:54:42.436 --> 08:54:47.383
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. NOBODY HAS 
HEARD WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. 

08:54:47.787 --> 08:54:52.201
THESE WITNESSES INCLUDE CENTRAL 
FIGURES IN THE ABUSE OF POWER, 

08:54:52.355 --> 08:55:00.378
CHARGE AND ARTICLE 1. WHAT IS 
THE PRESIDENT HIDING? EQUALLY 

08:55:00.778 --> 08:55:06.479
TROUBLESOME, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
HIS ADMINISTRATION DID NOT MAKE 

08:55:06.679 --> 08:55:08.296
ANY ATTEMPT TO REACH A 
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION WITH 

08:55:08.297 --> 08:55:12.768
THE HOUSE OR COMPROMISE 
REGARDING ANY DOCUMENT REQUEST 

08:55:12.966 --> 08:55:18.407
OR WHEN A SUBPOENA. WHY? BECAUSE
PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP, WAS

08:55:18.554 --> 08:55:24.949
NOT INTERESTED IN COOPERATING, 
HE WAS PLOTTING TO COVER UP. 

08:55:25.363 --> 08:55:27.599
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A STEP 
BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT 

08:55:27.802 --> 08:55:32.270
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING. 
COMPLETED TOTAL OBSTRUCTION IS 

08:55:33.229 --> 08:55:41.362
AN ESTIMATE AND IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY. EVEN NIXON, HER SPEECH 

08:55:41.507 --> 08:55:47.301
GO INCLUDED OBSTRUCTION OF 
CONGRESS DID NOT BLOCK AIDES 

08:55:47.507 --> 08:55:50.497
FROM TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF 
CONGRESS DURING THE WATERGATE 

08:55:50.648 --> 08:55:58.272
HEARINGS. IN FACT, HE PUBLICLY 
URGED WHEN ALLSTATE TO TESTIFY. 

08:55:58.673 --> 08:56:02.939
REMEMBER THOSE WITNESSES WHO 
CAME IN FRONT OF THE BODY? LOOK 

08:56:03.348 --> 08:56:05.348
AT THE SCREEN.

08:56:13.913 --> 08:56:15.913
JOHN DEAN, THE FORMER WHITE 
HOUSE COUNSEL TESTIFIED FOR 

08:56:16.291 --> 08:56:21.430
MULTIPLE DAYS, I WAS PURSUANT TO
A SUBPOENA. HR HALDEMAN NIXON'S 

08:56:21.625 --> 08:56:25.599
FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF WAS OF THE
UNIT AND TESTIFIED. ALEXANDER 

08:56:26.447 --> 08:56:32.804
BUTTERFIELD REVEALED THE 
EXISTENCE OF THE TAPES. HE 

08:56:33.004 --> 08:56:36.661
TESTIFIED PUBLICLY BEFORE THE 
SENATE. AND SO, DID SEVERAL 

08:56:36.859 --> 08:56:43.159
OTHERS TRUMP COMPLETE AND TOTAL 
OBSTRUCTION MADE RICHARD NIXON 

08:56:43.566 --> 08:56:45.566
LOOK LIKE A CHOIR BOY.

08:56:49.458 --> 08:56:51.495
TWO OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN 
TRIED BEFORE THE SENATE. HOW DID

08:56:51.692 --> 08:56:57.744
THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES? WILLIAM
JEFFERSON CLINTON, ANDREW 

08:56:57.893 --> 08:57:04.704
JOHNSON DID NOT MARK ANY 
WITNESSES FROM PARTICIPATING IN 

08:57:04.897 --> 08:57:09.566
THE SENATE TRIAL. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP BY CONTRAST REFUSES TO 

08:57:09.763 --> 08:57:14.645
PERMIT RELEVANT WITNESSES FROM 
TESTIFYING TO THIS VERY DAY. 

08:57:15.046 --> 08:57:17.847
MANY OF CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE 
AIDES TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF 

08:57:18.017 --> 08:57:22.368
CONGRESS. EVEN BEFORE THE 
COMMENCEMENT OF FORMAL 

08:57:23.123 --> 08:57:26.433
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS. DURING 
VARIOUS INVESTIGATION THE HOUSE 

08:57:26.633 --> 08:57:31.496
AND SENATE HEARD FOR MORE THAN 
TWO DOZEN WHITE HOUSE AIDES 

08:57:31.711 --> 08:57:35.368
INCLUDING THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL. THE FORMER CHIEF OF 

08:57:36.120 --> 08:57:42.668
STAFF AND MULTIPLE SENIOR 
ADVISORS TO CLINTON. PRESIDENT 

08:57:42.883 --> 08:57:49.986
CLINTON HIMSELF GAVE TESTIMONY 
ON CAMERA AND UNDER OATH. HE 

08:57:50.190 --> 08:57:53.640
ALLOWED THE MOST SENIOR ADVISOR 
INCLUDING MULTIPLE CHIEF OF 

08:57:53.852 --> 08:57:55.852
STAFF AND WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO
TESTIFY.

08:58:01.164 --> 08:58:04.210
THAT INVESTIGATION LED TO HIS 
IMPEACHMENT. AS YOU CAN SEE IN 

08:58:04.410 --> 08:58:07.948
THE CHART, TESTIMONY WAS 
DELIVERED TO THE SENATE.

08:58:12.942 --> 08:58:14.942
THERE WERE NO MISSING WITNESSES 
THAT DEFIED SUBPOENAS. NO AIDES 

08:58:14.979 --> 08:58:16.979
WHO HAD PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE CONDUCT WERE DIRECTED TO 

08:58:17.559 --> 08:58:23.295
STAY SILENT BY CLINTON. HAVE AN 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATION IN 

08:58:23.911 --> 08:58:27.762
THIS CASE. WE ARE SEEKING 
WITNESSES THE PRESIDENT HAS 

08:58:27.970 --> 08:58:29.970
BLOCK FROM TESTIFYING.

08:58:33.063 --> 08:58:35.063
APPARENTLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THINKS HE CAN DO WITH NO OTHER 

08:58:35.629 --> 08:58:40.162
PRESENT DOES BEFORE HIM, HAS 
ATTEMPTED TO DO COME IN SUCH A 

08:58:40.922 --> 08:58:47.262
BRAZEN FASHION. ABOVE THE LAW 
AND HE HIDES THE TRUTH. HE HIDES

08:58:47.477 --> 08:58:51.891
THE TRUTH FROM THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO

08:58:52.053 --> 08:58:58.194
STAND. LET ME ADDRESS BEDROCK 
PRINCIPLES ABOUT CONGRESSES 

08:58:58.337 --> 08:59:00.772
AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT 
INVESTIGATION.

08:59:04.936 --> 08:59:09.040
POWERS OF INQUIRY ARE AT THEIR 
STARTERS DURING ATTIC 

08:59:09.978 --> 08:59:14.279
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING. THIS 
THIS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN 

08:59:15.027 --> 08:59:22.207
ARTICLE 1. BILLY HUNDRED 40 
YEARS AGO, THE SUPREME COURT 

08:59:22.414 --> 08:59:27.076
RECOGNIZED, THAT WHEN THE HOUSE 
OR SENATE IS DETERMINING A 

08:59:27.279 --> 08:59:31.544
QUESTION OF IMPEACHMENT, THERE 
IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THE RIGHT 

08:59:32.302 --> 08:59:39.220
TO COMPEL THE ATTENDANCE OF 
WITNESSES. IN THE SAME MANNER 

08:59:39.380 --> 08:59:44.757
AND TO THE USE OF THE SAME NAME 
THAT COURTS OF JUSTICE CAN AND 

08:59:45.165 --> 08:59:47.699
IN LIKE CASES. OUR NATIONS

08:59:51.655 --> 08:59:53.281
FOUNDERS AND GREATEST LEGAL 
MINDS RECOGNIZE THESE PRINCIPLES

08:59:53.282 --> 08:59:57.352
EARLY ON. THE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE JOAQUIN SMITH  EXPLAINED

08:59:58.116 --> 09:00:03.635
THE PRESIDENT, SHOULD NOT HAVE 
THE POWER, OF PREVENTION OF 

09:00:03.848 --> 09:00:05.848
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF 
MISCONDUCT.

09:00:17.205 --> 09:00:23.958
PRESIDENT TRUMP, CANNOT FUNCTION
AS JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER 

09:00:24.362 --> 09:00:29.843
OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT WAS NOT 
JUST THE COURT WHO CONFIRM THIS,

09:00:30.607 --> 09:00:36.542
FOR US. SOME OF OUR NATIONS 
LEADING PUBLIC SERVANTS. 

09:00:37.513 --> 09:00:41.833
REPRESENTATIVE JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
SPEAKING ON THE FLOOR OF THE 

09:00:42.032 --> 09:00:44.885
HOUSE AFTER SHE HAD SERVED AS 
PRESIDENT. HE EXPLAINED, WHAT 

09:00:45.083 --> 09:00:48.871
MOCKERY WOULD IT BE, FOR THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 

09:00:49.029 --> 09:00:56.447
STATES, TO SAY, THAT THE HOUSTON
OF THE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT, 

09:00:56.862 --> 09:00:58.862
EXTENDING EVEN TO THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, HIMSELF, 

09:00:58.897 --> 09:01:03.362
AND YET TO SAY THAT THE HOUSE 
HAD NOT THE POWER TO OBTAIN THE 

09:01:03.576 --> 09:01:09.657
EVIDENCE AND PROOF ON WHICH 
THEIR IMPEACHMENT WAS BASED. 

09:01:10.058 --> 09:01:13.111
HAMILTON, STORY, ADAMS AND 
OTHERS HAVE RECOGNIZED, THE 

09:01:13.872 --> 09:01:18.750
PRESIDENT CANNOT INSULATE 
HIMSELF FROM CONGRESSES 

09:01:18.904 --> 09:01:24.443
INVESTIGATION OF HIS WRONGDOING.
THE PRESIDENT CAN DECIDE WHAT 

09:01:24.592 --> 09:01:29.508
EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED AT HIS OWN
TRIAL THAT WAS FUNDAMENTALLY 

09:01:29.653 --> 09:01:36.266
NULLIFIED THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
POWER OF IMPEACHMENT. THIS 

09:01:36.467 --> 09:01:39.920
MOMENT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE 
RESIDENT TRUMP SIMPLY CANNOT BE 

09:01:40.131 --> 09:01:46.022
ALLOWED TO HIDE THE TRUTH. NO 
OTHER PRESIDENT HAS DONE IT. THE

09:01:46.225 --> 09:01:51.247
SUPREME COURT DOESN'T ALLOW IT. 
THE PRESIDENT, IS NOT ABOVE THE 

09:01:51.406 --> 09:02:01.404
LAW. WITNESSES, MATTER. 
DOCUMENTS, MATTER. EVIDENCE, 

09:02:01.555 --> 09:02:11.411
MATTERS. THE TRUTH, MATTERS. WE 
NOW TURN TO THE 

09:02:11.613 --> 09:02:18.259
THIRD JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS 
MEME. COUNTRIES THIS MONEY IS 

09:02:18.415 --> 09:02:24.099
CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE CASE
FOR REMOVAL. THE MAN IS

09:02:28.071 --> 09:02:29.686
INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN KEY 
STAGES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 

09:02:29.687 --> 09:02:35.370
ABUSE OF POWER. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
KNOWS THIS. WHY ELSE WOULD HE BE

09:02:35.585 --> 09:02:41.823
TRYING SO HARD, TO PREVENT MICK 
MULVANEY  FROM TESTIFYING BEFORE

09:02:41.971 --> 09:02:43.971
YOU?

09:02:45.536 --> 09:02:47.536
THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR REASONS

09:02:50.816 --> 09:02:52.635
WHY MULVANEY'S TESTIMONY IS 
CRITICAL. TO BEGIN WITH THAT'S 

09:02:52.636 --> 09:02:57.315
ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF 
STAFF AND HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF 

09:02:57.525 --> 09:02:59.136
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET MICK 
MULVANEY HAS FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE

09:02:59.137 --> 09:03:04.226
ABOUT  PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
EFFORTS TO SHAKE DOWN UKRAINE 

09:03:04.422 --> 09:03:08.685
AND PRESSURE THE NEW PRESIDENT 
INTO ANNOUNCING, PHONY 

09:03:09.655 --> 09:03:11.655
INVESTIGATIONS.

09:03:16.002 --> 09:03:18.236
MR. MULVANEY WAS IN THE LOOP AT 
EACH CRITICAL STAGE OF  

09:03:18.804 --> 09:03:23.104
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SCHEME. HE WAS
IN THE LOOP IN THE PLANNING OF 

09:03:23.319 --> 09:03:27.585
THE SCHEME. HE WAS IN THE LOOP, 
AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. HE WAS 

09:03:27.783 --> 09:03:31.317
IN THE LOOP, WHEN THE STEAM FELL
APART.

09:03:35.093 --> 09:03:37.093
HE EVEN ADMITTED PUBLICLY THAT 
THE AIDE WAS

09:03:40.782 --> 09:03:42.615
WITHHELD IN ORDER TO PRESSURE 
UKRAINE INTO ANNOUNCING THE 

09:03:42.616 --> 09:03:44.616
INVESTIGATION IS DESIGNED TO 
ELEVATE THE PRESIDENT'S 

09:03:44.996 --> 09:03:50.937
POLITICAL STANDING. MR. MULVANEY
, PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER 

09:03:51.886 --> 09:03:56.224
ADMINISTRATION, WITNESS 
ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENT, HAS 

09:03:56.980 --> 09:04:02.855
FIRSTHAND INSIGHT INTO THE 
DECISION TO WITHHOLD HUNDRED $91

09:04:03.005 --> 09:04:08.614
MILLION IN MILITARY AND SECURITY
AID TO OF POTABLE UKRAINE 

09:04:09.575 --> 09:04:15.004
WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. INDEED, 
OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED, THAT

09:04:16.531 --> 09:04:21.608
PRESIDENT TRUMP PERSONALLY 
ORDERED, MR. MULVANEY, TO 

09:04:21.815 --> 09:04:27.653
EXECUTE THE FREEZE IN JULY, 2019
.

09:04:33.796 --> 09:04:35.796
MR. MULVANEY HOLDS A SENIOR 
STAFF POSITION AT THE WHITE 

09:04:35.831 --> 09:04:38.066
HOUSE. HE'S A MEMBER OF TRUMP'S 
CABINET . HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

09:04:38.823 --> 09:04:44.776
TRUMP'S TEAM AT 1600 
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. HE REMAINS 

09:04:45.530 --> 09:04:48.772
THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF 
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET WHICH 

09:04:48.914 --> 09:04:53.497
IMPLEMENTED THE HOLD ON THE 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN VIOLATION

09:04:53.707 --> 09:04:55.707
OF THE LAW.

09:05:01.182 --> 09:05:06.306
IN SHORT, RESPECTFULLY THE 
SENATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO 

09:05:06.500 --> 09:05:11.327
CONDUCT A COMPLETE AND FAIR 
TRIAL, THE MAN, THAT MR. 

09:05:11.476 --> 09:05:18.889
MULVANEY TESTIFY,. HIS TESTIMONY
IS CRITICAL, BECAUSE OF HIS 

09:05:19.089 --> 09:05:21.615
KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANNING OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ABUSE OF POWER

09:05:23.931 --> 09:05:30.061
AMBASSADOR GORDON THE WAS 
AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION

09:05:30.263 --> 09:05:36.772
TESTIFIED THAT THERE WAS A QUID 
PRO QUO. AMBASSADOR SONDLAND IS 

09:05:36.973 --> 09:05:44.983
NOT SO COLD NEVER TRUMPER. MR. 
SONDLAND GAVE $1 MILLION

09:05:50.576 --> 09:05:52.767
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
INAUGURATION. HE TESTIFIED THAT 

09:05:52.916 --> 09:05:58.899
EVERYBODY THAT EVERYBODY WAS IN 
THE LOOP AND IT WAS NO SECRET 

09:05:59.314 --> 09:06:04.546
WHAT WAS GOING ON. IN FACT, AS 
EARLY AS MAY 2019

09:06:08.453 --> 09:06:13.324
WAS COORDINATING ON UKRAINE 
MATTERS, WITH MR. MULVANEY. 

09:06:13.739 --> 09:06:17.793
HERE'S WHAT DAVID HOLMES AN 
OFFICIAL AT THE EMBASSY IN 

09:06:18.001 --> 09:06:20.001
UKRAINE HAS TO SAY ON THAT 
MATTER.

09:06:24.700 --> 09:06:28.765
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND MANDATE IS 
THE ACCREDITED AMBASSADOR TO THE

09:06:28.965 --> 09:06:31.401
EUROPEAN UNION DID NOT COVER 
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS LIKE 

09:06:31.817 --> 09:06:34.655
NONMEMBERS LIKE UKRAINE REMAIN 
CLEAR HAD DIRECT FREQUENT ACCESS

09:06:34.852 --> 09:06:37.906
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHIEF OF 
STAFF MICK MULVANEY AND 

09:06:38.666 --> 09:06:42.526
PORTRAYED  HIMSELF AS THE 
CONDUIT TO THE PRESIDENT AND MR.

09:06:42.673 --> 09:06:49.433
MULVANEY. AFTER THE U.S. 
DELEGATION, RETURNED FROM THE 

09:06:49.578 --> 09:06:53.541
INAUGURATION OF THE NEW 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT, IN APRIL, 

09:06:53.955 --> 09:06:58.426
THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE A 
MEETING WITH TRUMP. THEY BRIEFED

09:06:58.626 --> 09:07:03.043
HIM ON THE TRIP AND IN PART 
BECAUSE OF AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S

09:07:03.183 --> 09:07:08.778
CONNECTION, THE MICK MULVANEY 
MULVANEY.  THEN, DURING THE 

09:07:09.542 --> 09:07:15.685
GENE, 18th 2019 MEETING, 
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND INFORMED 

09:07:15.883 --> 09:07:20.767
SECURITY COUNCIL SENIOR DIRECTOR
DR. FIONA HILL, THAT HE WAS IN 

09:07:21.526 --> 09:07:23.768
CHARGE OF UKRAINE. AND,

09:07:27.469 --> 09:07:29.591
HE HAD BEEN BRIEFING SENIOR 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS, INCLUDING

09:07:30.856 --> 09:07:38.233
MR. MULVANEY. ABOUT HIS EFFORTS 
TO UNDERTAKE, A DOMESTIC 

09:07:39.006 --> 09:07:41.006
POLITICAL ERRAND IN UKRAINE.

09:07:44.943 --> 09:07:46.864
HERE IS DR. HILL, EXPLAINING 
THIS HERSELF. 

09:07:46.865 --> 09:07:53.267
&gt;&gt; I WAS UPSET WITH HIM, HE WAS 
NOT FULLY TELLING US ABOUT ALL 

09:07:53.468 --> 09:07:55.468
THE READINGS HE WAS HAVING. 
ESSENTIALLY, I'M BRIEFING THE 

09:07:56.063 --> 09:08:00.934
PRESIDENT. I'M BRIEFING TO FIRST
DRAFT MULVANEY. I'M BRIEFING 

09:08:01.086 --> 09:08:07.441
POMPEO. WHO ELSE TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH? THE POINT IS, WE HAVE A 

09:08:07.585 --> 09:08:13.120
ROBUST AGENCY THAT DEALS WITH 
UKRAINE. IT INCLUDES AMBASSADOR 

09:08:13.266 --> 09:08:20.690
TAYLOR. IT INCLUDES A LOAD OF 
HUNDRED PEOPLE. IT STRUCK ME 

09:08:20.894 --> 09:08:23.485
YESTERDAY, WHEN HE GOT UP ON THE
SCREEN THAT AMBASSADOR SONDLAND 

09:08:23.634 --> 09:08:27.999
EMAILS, HE SAID, THESE ARE 
PEOPLE THAT NEED TO KNOW HE WAS 

09:08:28.211 --> 09:08:31.659
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HE WAS BEING 
INVOLVED IN A DOMESTIC POLITICAL

09:08:31.862 --> 09:08:36.741
ERRAND. WE WERE BEING INVOLVED 
IN NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN 

09:08:36.943 --> 09:08:42.366
POLICY. DOES TWO THINGS 
DIVERSIONS. THERE IS MORE. MUCH 

09:08:42.527 --> 09:08:48.669
MORE. MONTHS LATER, TRUMP

SECURITY COUNSELOR, THAT HE WAS 
NOT PART OF WHATEVER DRUG DEAL, 

09:09:01.462 --> 09:09:07.519
SONDLAND AND MULVANEY, WERE 
COOKING UP.

09:09:13.296 --> 09:09:15.128
HE MADE THAT STATEMENT AFTER 
SONDLAND, SPECIFICALLY SAID, HE 

09:09:15.129 --> 09:09:18.276
HAD A DEAL, WITH MR. MULVANEY TO
SCHEDULE A WHITE HOUSE VISIT FOR

09:09:20.207 --> 09:09:26.706
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY IF UKRAINE 
ANNOUNCED TWO PHONY 

09:09:27.467 --> 09:09:33.356
INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE 
BIDENS, AND 2016 ELECTION 

09:09:34.167 --> 09:09:39.705
INTERFERENCE. INVESTIGATIONS 
WERE SOUGHT BY PRESIDENT DONALD 

09:09:40.468 --> 09:09:49.660
JOHN TRUMP. HERE IS THE HILLS 
TESTAMENT DISCUSSED IN THE DRUG 

09:09:49.860 --> 09:09:58.397

WILL BE A MEETING OF A DEAL HERE

09:10:01.635 --> 09:10:03.635

09:10:20.335 --> 09:10:22.335

HE RETURNED TO THE PARTISAN 
GIULIANI WAS LENA'S OUT THERE. I

09:10:28.657 --> 09:10:31.397
CAN SEE WHY HE WAS ALARMED. HE 
SAID, THERE'S SAYS INAPPROPRIATE

THAT HE INTENDS TO RUN UP A 
TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION, AND 

09:13:53.808 --> 09:13:55.808
WILL TURN OVER EVERY STONE.

QUESTIONS WITH OUR ANSWERS. 
UNDER OATH FROM MR. MULVANEY.

FREEZE ON $391 MILLION IN AID TO

09:15:16.282 --> 09:15:18.282
IS NOT JUST OF THE PEOPLE.

09:15:21.365 --> 09:15:25.217
THIS IS THE JUST OF THE PEOPLE 
FINGERING MULVANEY. HE HAS 

09:15:25.976 --> 09:15:27.976
HIMSELF, ADMITTED, HE WAS 
INVOLVED.

09:15:31.662 --> 09:15:37.007

PROCESS BY WHICH MONEY WAS HELD 

09:15:37.761 --> 09:15:42.892
UP, TEMPORARILY. SECOND PUBLIC 
REPORTS CONFIRM MR. MULVANEY'S 

09:15:43.086 --> 09:15:47.356
OWN ACCOUNTS,  THAT HE HAS 
INFORMATION ON THE GOES TO THE

HEART OF THIS INQUIRY.

09:15:52.789 --> 09:15:58.727
WHILE THE PRESIDENT OR TO THE 
HALL AND KEPT IT IN PLACE, 

09:15:58.943 --> 09:16:02.951
DESPITE DEEP-SEATED CONCERNS 
AMONG TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

09:16:03.104 --> 09:16:08.487
OFFICIALS. THE NEW YORK TIMES 
ARTICLE ON THE SCREEN, 

09:16:09.250 --> 09:16:13.158
SUMMARIZES AN EMAIL CONVERSATION
BETWEEN ROBERT BLAIR AND MICK 

09:16:13.919 --> 09:16:20.258
MULVANEY.  ON JUNE 27th, WHEN 
MICK MULVANEY  ASKED HIM DID WE 

09:16:20.473 --> 09:16:24.127
EVER FIND OUT, ABOUT THE MONEY 
FOR UKRAINE, AND WHETHER WE CAN 

09:16:24.329 --> 09:16:30.978
HOLD IT BACK? WHAT PROMPTED THAT
EMAIL? ACCORDING TO PUBLIC 

09:16:31.124 --> 09:16:40.166
REPORTS, MR. MULVANEY  WAS ON 
AIR FORCE ONE. AIR FORCE ONE. 

09:16:41.139 --> 09:16:46.880
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE 
SENT IT. WHAT OTHER 

09:16:47.481 --> 09:16:52.701
CONVERSATIONS DID HE HAVE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT AND WHITE HOUSE 

09:16:52.893 --> 09:16:59.213
OFFICIALS ABOUT THIS UNLAWFUL 
FREEZE? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 

09:16:59.397 --> 09:17:07.383
DESERVE TO KNOW. THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE CONCERNING 

09:17:07.598 --> 09:17:10.030
MR. MULVANEY'S ROLE IN 
IMPLEMENTING THIS  GAME. 

09:17:10.432 --> 09:17:15.102
ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE WITNESSES,
THE DIRECTIONS THE FREE SECURITY

09:17:15.305 --> 09:17:22.224
ASSISTANT, TO UKRAINE, WAS 
DELIVERED BY MR. MULVANEY  

09:17:22.760 --> 09:17:28.511
HIMSELF. MARK SANDY TESTIFIED 
ABOUT JULY 12th EMAIL FROM BLAIR

09:17:28.714 --> 09:17:35.015
STATING, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
DIRECTING A HOLD ON MILITARY 

09:17:35.215 --> 09:17:42.535
SUPPORT FUNDING FOR UKRAINE. WAS
MR. BLAIR ACTING AT MR. MULVANEY

09:17:42.736 --> 09:17:44.736
EXPRESSED DIRECTION? 

09:17:47.808 --> 09:17:49.636
THE MEMBERS OF THIS 
DISTINGUISHED BODY, DESERVE TO 

09:17:49.637 --> 09:17:54.507
KNOW. ON THE LIGHT 18th THE HOLD
WAS ANNOUNCED TO THE AGENCIES IN

09:17:54.722 --> 09:18:00.211
THE ADMINISTRATION OVERSEEN 
UKRAINE POLICY MATTERS. THOSE 

09:18:00.410 --> 09:18:04.473
WERE BLINDSIDED BY THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT. THAT IS VERY AID 

09:18:04.875 --> 09:18:10.357
APPROPRIATED BY THIS ON A 
BIPARTISAN BASIS, TO UKRAINE, 

09:18:10.559 --> 09:18:16.410
WHICH IS STILL AT WAR WITH 
RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS. THEY WERE 

09:18:16.573 --> 09:18:24.579
ALARMED. THE AIDE HAD 
INEXPLICABLY, BEEN PUT ON HOLD. 

09:18:24.988 --> 09:18:27.630
MEANWHILE OFFICIALS AT THE 
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IN THE OFFICE

09:18:28.031 --> 09:18:31.850
OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET BECAME 
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED, THAT THE

09:18:31.999 --> 09:18:41.169
HOLD ALSO VIOLATED THE LAW. 
THEIR CONCERN TURNED OUT TO BE 

09:18:41.335 --> 09:18:43.335
ACCURATE.

09:18:45.304 --> 09:18:48.084
PUBLIC REPORTS INDICATED THE 
WHITE HOUSE, IS IN POSSESSION OF

09:18:48.246 --> 09:18:52.811
EARLY AUGUST EMAILS EXCHANGES 
BETWEEN ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF 

09:18:53.019 --> 09:18:55.019
MICK MULVANEY  AND

09:18:58.505 --> 09:19:00.123
WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICIALS 
SEEKING TO PROVIDE AN 

09:19:00.124 --> 09:19:05.827
EXPLANATION FOR THE FUNDING. AN 
EXPLANATION I SHOULD NOTE, THEY 

09:19:06.011 --> 09:19:09.674
WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE AFTER THE
PRESIDENT HAD ALREADY ORDERED 

09:19:10.443 --> 09:19:17.593
THE HOLD. MR. MULVANEY , 
PRESUMABLY HAD ANSWERED TWO OF 

09:19:18.358 --> 09:19:23.484
THE QUESTIONS. WE DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE. BUT, HE 

09:19:23.684 --> 09:19:27.748
SHOULD PROVIDE THEM TO THE 
SENATE AND TO THE AMERICAN 

09:19:28.521 --> 09:19:33.186
PEOPLE. FINALLY, ON OCTOBER 
17th, 2019

09:19:37.713 --> 09:19:39.941
AT A PRESS BRIEFING AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, MR. MULVANEY LEFT NO 

09:19:40.543 --> 09:19:44.743
DOUBT , THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WITHHELD THE ESSENTIAL MILITARY 

09:19:44.899 --> 09:19:49.637
AID AS LEVERAGE, TO TRY TO 
EXTRACT PHONY POLITICAL 

09:19:49.817 --> 09:19:55.374
INVESTIGATION AS PART OF THIS 
EFFORT TO SOLICIT FOREIGN 

09:19:55.778 --> 09:19:59.026
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2020 
ELECTION. THIS WAS AN 

09:19:59.441 --> 09:20:02.438
EXTRAORDINARY PRESS CONFERENCE. 
MR. MULVANEY MADE CLEAR,  THE 

09:20:02.588 --> 09:20:07.563
PRESIDENT WAS IN FACT PRESSURE 
UKRAINE TO INVESTIGATE THE 

09:20:08.324 --> 09:20:15.690
CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT UKRAINE 
RATHER THAN RUSSIA, I GET 

09:20:15.890 --> 09:20:20.639
INTERFERED IN THE 2016 ELECTION.
A CONSPIRACY THEORY, PROMOTED BY

09:20:21.580 --> 09:20:26.448
NONE OTHER THAN THE GREAT 
PURVEYOR OF DEMOCRACY VLADIMIR 

09:20:27.196 --> 09:20:32.344
PUTIN, HIMSELF. WHEN WHITE HOUSE
REPORTERS ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY, 

09:20:33.108 --> 09:20:38.435
THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A QUID 
PRO QUO WERE RELATED TO SECURITY

09:20:38.633 --> 09:20:42.638
ASSISTANCE, MR. MULVANEY 
REPLIED,  WE DO THAT ALL THE 

09:20:42.828 --> 09:20:48.080
TIME WITH FOREIGN POLICY. I AM 
NEWS FOR YOU GET OVER IT.

09:20:52.452 --> 09:20:57.630
LET'S LISTEN TO A PORTION OF 
THAT STUNNING EXCHANGE. 

09:20:57.631 --> 09:21:02.400
&gt;&gt; HE MENTIONED TO ME THAT THE 
CORRUPTION RELATED TO THE DNC 

09:21:02.603 --> 09:21:06.205
SERVER, ABSOLUTELY. NO QUESTION 
THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 

09:21:06.349 --> 09:21:11.338
MONEY. THE DEMAND FOR AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEMOCRATS

09:21:11.552 --> 09:21:17.036
WAS PART OF THE REASON HE WANTED
TO WITHHOLD MONEY TO THE 

09:21:17.237 --> 09:21:18.856
UKRAINE. 
&gt;&gt; WHEN HE LOOKED BACK TO WHAT 

09:21:18.857 --> 09:21:21.700
HAPPENED IN  2016 AND CERTAINLY 
HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THAT. 

09:21:22.100 --> 09:21:27.396
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. 
YOU DESCRIBED THAT AS A QUID PRO

09:21:28.155 --> 09:21:30.155
QUO. 

09:21:34.491 --> 09:21:40.598
WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME WITH 
FOREIGN POLICY. WE WERE LOOKING 

09:21:40.800 --> 09:21:43.329
FOR MONEY THE SAME TIME. THAT 
THEY

09:21:47.086 --> 09:21:49.535
WOULD CHANGE THEIR POLICY, ON 
IMMIGRATION. BY THE WAY AND THIS

09:21:50.297 --> 09:21:52.297
SPEAKS TO

09:21:54.005 --> 09:21:57.242
GET I'M SORRY. I CAN NEVER 
REMEMBER THE GENTLEMAN. IF THAT 

09:21:57.456 --> 09:22:01.872
HIS NAME? I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU 
GO, AND IF YOU BELIEVE THIS 

09:22:02.025 --> 09:22:04.653
REPORTS, WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY 
TRANSCRIPT OF THIS.

09:22:11.057 --> 09:22:13.091
THE ONLY TRANSCRIPT I'VE SEEN 
WAS THIS MORNING. IF YOU READ 

09:22:13.296 --> 09:22:15.327
THE NEWS REPORT AND BELIEVE 
THEM, WHAT DID HE SAY YESTERDAY?

09:22:15.530 --> 09:22:17.530
McKINNEY SAID YESTERDAY HE WAS 
REALLY UPSET WITH THE POLITICAL 

09:22:17.557 --> 09:22:20.413
INFLUENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY. 
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS 

09:22:20.615 --> 09:22:23.243
WAS SO UPSET ABOUT THIS. I AM 
NEWS, GET OVER IT. THERE'S GOING

09:22:23.445 --> 09:22:24.874
TO BE POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN 
FOREIGN POLICY. 

09:22:24.875 --> 09:22:27.613
&gt;&gt; IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY PRESS 
CONFERENCE,

09:22:32.797 --> 09:22:34.414
MR. MULVANEY SPOKE WITH 
AUTHORITY AND CONVICTION ABOUT 

09:22:34.415 --> 09:22:37.769
WHY PRESIDENT  TRUMP FOUND THE 
AIDE. HE DIDN'T MINCE HIS WORDS.

09:22:39.900 --> 09:22:44.118
FOLLOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE, 
TRYING TO WALK BACK HIS 

09:22:44.263 --> 09:22:49.002
STATEMENT. AS IF HE HADN'T SAID 
THEM. AS IF HE HAD NOT MEANT 

09:22:49.149 --> 09:22:55.683
THEM. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM MAKE 
DIRECTLY SO HE CAN CLARIFY HIS 

09:22:55.839 --> 09:23:00.618
INTENTIONS. I HAVE NOT GONE TO 
THE NEED FOR EVIDENCE LET'S 

09:23:00.844 --> 09:23:04.417
BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE ARGUMENT, 
THAT HE CAN BLOCK THIS 

09:23:04.605 --> 09:23:11.144
TESTIMONY. THAT IS NOT ONLY 
WRONG, IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY 

09:23:11.292 --> 09:23:18.097
UNDERMINED BY SYSTEM OF CHECKS 
AND BALANCES. STEP BACK FOR 

09:23:18.861 --> 09:23:20.861
MOMENT AND

09:23:22.568 --> 09:23:24.188
CONSIDER THE EXTRAORDINARY 
POSITION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

09:23:24.189 --> 09:23:27.837
TRYING TO MANUFACTURE FOR 
HIMSELF. THE DEPARTMENT OF 

09:23:28.039 --> 09:23:31.707
JUSTICE HAS ALREADY SAID THE 
PRESIDENT CAN'T BE PROSECUTED OR

09:23:32.464 --> 09:23:36.373
INDICTED OFFICE. AS WE SIT HERE 
TODAY, THE PRESIDENT HAS FILED A

09:23:36.581 --> 09:23:40.786
BRIEF IN THE SUPREME COURT 
SAYING HE CANNOT BE CRIMINALLY 

09:23:40.930 --> 09:23:46.323
INVESTIGATED AS WELL. NOT WHILE 
HE'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE. SO, THE

09:23:46.530 --> 09:23:52.629
SENATE AND HOUSE ARE THE ONLY 
CHECKS LEFT WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

09:23:52.830 --> 09:23:57.046
USES HIS POWER. HE TRIES TO 
CHEAT IN THE NEXT ELECTION AND 

09:23:57.194 --> 09:24:03.383
UNDERMINE NATIONAL SECURITY. HE 
BREAKS THE LAW IN DOING SO AND 

09:24:03.799 --> 09:24:09.434
THEN TRIED TO COVER IT UP. THIS 
IS AMERICA. NOBODY IS ABOVE THE 

09:24:09.581 --> 09:24:16.601
LAW. BUT, IF THE PRESIDENT IS 
ALLOWED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IF 

09:24:16.798 --> 09:24:21.790
HE'S ALLOWED TO BE INVESTIGATED 
OR IF HE SHOULD COMPLY WITH

09:24:25.533 --> 09:24:29.787
IMPEACHMENT HE IS THE ULTIMATE 
ARBITER OF IF HE DID ANYTHING 

09:24:30.005 --> 09:24:34.671
WRONG. THAT CAN'T STAND. IF YOU 
CANNOT BE INDICTED, AND IT 

09:24:34.873 --> 09:24:38.731
CANNOT BE IMPEACHED, AND IT 
CANNOT BE REMOVED AND HE CANNOT 

09:24:38.936 --> 09:24:42.733
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, THAT IS 
INCONSISTENT WITH

09:24:46.852 --> 09:24:49.084
THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. 
YOU WILL KNOW THAT HERE, THAT 

09:24:49.842 --> 09:24:54.578
THE REASON HE BLOCKED ALL THESE 
WITNESSES INCLUDING MR. MULVANEY

09:24:54.775 --> 09:25:01.890
FROM TESTIFYING  BECAUSE OF A 
LOFTY CONCERN, BY THE OFFICE OF 

09:25:02.092 --> 09:25:05.494
THE PRESIDENCY AND THE 
PRESERVATION OF EXECUTIVE 

09:25:05.654 --> 09:25:12.448
PRIVILEGE, LET'S GET REAL. HOW 
BLOCKING WITNESSES FROM TELLING 

09:25:12.862 --> 09:25:17.282
THE TRUTH, ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS 
MISCONDUCT HELP PRESERVE THE 

09:25:17.434 --> 09:25:23.422
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY? THIS 
TYPE OF BLANKET OBSTRUCTION 

09:25:23.628 --> 09:25:28.093
UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY OF 
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY, 

09:25:28.299 --> 09:25:35.408
AND DEALS THE CONSTITUTION HIM 
MORTALLY DEATHBLOW. TO BE CLEAR 

09:25:35.615 --> 09:25:40.285
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE DOESN'T 
PROVIDE LEGALLY JUSTIFIABLE 

09:25:40.476 --> 09:25:45.866
BASIS FOR HIS COMPLETE AND TOTAL
BLOCKAGE OF EVIDENCE.

09:25:49.624 --> 09:25:52.024
IN FACT, AS YOU HEARD EARLIER 
TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER 

09:25:52.163 --> 09:25:57.236
EVEN INVOKED EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE, NOT ONCE. AND WITHOUT

09:25:58.565 --> 09:26:01.965
EVER ASSERTING THIS PRIVILEGE 
HOW CAN YOU CONSIDER HIS 

09:26:02.110 --> 09:26:09.414
ARGUMENT IN A SERIOUS FASHION? 
INSTEAD SPEAKING THROUGH

09:26:15.222 --> 09:26:17.243
MR. SIMPLE ON THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL IN A LETTER DATED 

09:26:17.456 --> 09:26:21.462
OCTOBER EIGHTH 2019, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO 

09:26:21.611 --> 09:26:28.829
PARTICIPATE IN THE INVESTIGATION
INTO HIS OWN WRONGDOING IT WAS A

09:26:29.030 --> 09:26:30.648
CATEGORICAL DECISION NOT TO 
COOPERATE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION 

09:26:30.649 --> 09:26:35.680
OF SPECIFIC FACTS OR LEGAL 
ARGUMENTS. IN FACT, EVEN THE 

09:26:35.867 --> 09:26:41.225
WORD THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP USED 
THIS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL WERE 

09:26:41.998 --> 09:26:47.677
MADE UP. IN THE LETTER HE 
REFERRED TO SO-CALLED EXECUTIVE 

09:26:47.823 --> 09:26:55.435
BRANCH CONFIDENTIALITY INTEREST.
THAT IS NOT A RECOGNIZED 

09:26:56.389 --> 09:27:00.722
JURISPRUDENTIAL FIELD. THAT'S 
NOT A PROPER ASSERTION OF 

09:27:01.480 --> 09:27:07.007
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. TO THE 
EXTENT THERE ARE PRIVILEGED 

09:27:07.423 --> 09:27:11.075
ISSUES TO CONSIDER, THOSE CAN BE
RESOLVED DURING TESTIMONY AS 

09:27:11.489 --> 09:27:18.383
THEY HAVE BEEN FOR DECADES. 
FINALLY, THE PRESIDENT CLAIMED 

09:27:18.800 --> 09:27:20.800
MR. MULVANEY COULDN'T BE 
COMPELLED TO TESTIFY BECAUSE OF 

09:27:20.831 --> 09:27:27.733
CIRCLE  ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY. EVERY
COURT TO ADDRESS THIS FICTION 

09:27:27.939 --> 09:27:35.257
HAS REJECTED IT. AS THE SUPREME 
COURT EMPHATICALLY STATED IN THE

09:27:35.454 --> 09:27:38.853
DECISION ON THE NIXON CASE, 
EVENTUALITY INTEREST OF THE 

09:27:39.037 --> 09:27:43.710
PRESIDENT MUST YIELD TO AN 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WHEN THERE 

09:27:43.850 --> 09:27:50.011
IS A NEED FOR INFORMATION AS 
THERE IS HERE TODAY. THE COPY NO

09:27:50.158 --> 09:27:55.562
DOUBT, MR. MULVANEY AS THE 
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF AND 

09:27:55.964 --> 09:27:58.814
HEAD OF THE OFFICE MANAGEMENT 
AND BUDGET, IS UNIQUELY 

09:27:59.012 --> 09:28:03.281
SITUATED, TO PROVIDE THIS 
DISTINGUISHED BODY, WITH 

09:28:03.482 --> 09:28:07.754
RELEVANT AND IMPORTANT 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHARGES IN

09:28:07.952 --> 09:28:13.835
THE PEACH CO. THE PRESIDENT 
OBSTRUCTION, HAS NO BASIS IN 

09:28:14.049 --> 09:28:19.284
LAW, AND IT SHOULD YIELD THE 
BEST BODY, COEQUAL AUTHORITY TO 

09:28:19.430 --> 09:28:24.968
INVESTIGATE IMPEACHABLE AND 
CORRUPT CONDUCT. ONE FINAL 

09:28:25.115 --> 09:28:31.723
POINT, BEARS MENTIONING. IF THE 
PRESIDENT WANTED TO MAKE 

09:28:31.925 --> 09:28:36.192
WITNESSES AVAILABLE, EVEN WELL 
PRESERVING THE EXECUTIVE 

09:28:36.392 --> 09:28:42.886
PRIVILEGE, HE CAN DO SO. IN 
FACT, TRUMP EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE

09:28:43.102 --> 09:28:46.094
FOR WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN THE 
SENATE, JUST LAST MONTH. LET'S 

09:28:46.240 --> 09:28:55.880
GO TO THE VIDEOTAPE. SO, WHEN IT
IS FAIR, 

09:28:56.298 --> 09:29:00.568
IT WILL BE FAIR IN THE SENATE, I
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE POMPEO, LOVE 

09:29:00.772 --> 09:29:03.404
TO HAVE MITCH, I WOULD LOVE 
EVERETT TERRY, MANY OTHER 

09:29:04.164 --> 09:29:06.164
PEOPLE, TESTIFY,

09:29:07.875 --> 09:29:14.171
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP HE HAS 
NOTHING TO HIDE, HIS ADVISORS, 

09:29:14.573 --> 09:29:17.422
REPEATEDLY CLAIM, THEY SHOULD 
ALL SIMPLY TESTIFY IN THE SENATE

09:29:17.823 --> 09:29:23.402
TRIAL. WHAT IS DONALD JOHN TRUMP
HIDING FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

09:29:26.965 --> 09:29:33.672
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES, A 
FAIR TRIAL DEMOCRACY NEEDS A 

09:29:34.440 --> 09:29:41.123
FAIR TRIAL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
DESERVE A FAIR TRIAL. A FAIR 

09:29:41.267 --> 09:29:47.889
TRIAL, NEEDS WITNESSES. A FAIR 
TRIAL NEEDS DOCUMENTS. A FAIR 

09:29:48.661 --> 09:29:53.324
TRIAL MEANS CONSIDERATION OF ALL
THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. A FAIR 

09:29:53.471 --> 09:30:02.316
TRIAL, NEEDS TESTIMONY FROM MICK
MULVANEY . MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, 

09:30:02.716 --> 09:30:10.577
HOUSE MANAGERS RESERVE, THE 
BALANCE OF OUR TIME. 

09:30:10.578 --> 09:30:12.578
&gt;&gt;

09:30:14.910 --> 09:30:16.910
MR. PAT CIPOLLONE ?

09:30:28.716 --> 09:30:35.616
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. MEMBERS OF 
THE SENATE. GOOD EVENING. MY 

09:30:35.830 --> 09:30:39.842
NAME IS MICHAEL PUGH PURE. I 
SERVE AS DEPUTY COUNSEL TO THE 

09:30:39.985 --> 09:30:45.320
PRESIDENT. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE, 
THE AMENDMENT, AND SUPPORTED THE

09:30:45.471 --> 09:30:48.707
RESOLUTION. THERE IS SIMPLY, NO 
NEED,

09:30:52.688 --> 09:30:55.736
TO ALTER THE PROCESS ON WITNESS,
WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS, FROM 

09:30:55.937 --> 09:31:01.225
THAT OF THE CLINTON TRIAL. IT 
WAS SUPPORTED BY THE BODY 100 

09:31:01.429 --> 09:31:10.965
TALK TO ZERO. THAT IS CORE AND 
THIS CASE IS VERY SIMPLE. THE 

09:31:11.378 --> 09:31:18.008
KEY FACTS, ARE UNDISPUTED. 
FIRST, YOU HAVE SEEN THE 

09:31:18.149 --> 09:31:23.157
TRANSCRIPTS. THE PRESIDENT 
RELEASED THEM, UNPRECEDENTEDLY 

09:31:23.927 --> 09:31:30.462
AND TRANSPARENTLY. THERE WAS NO 
SQUID, FOR ANYTHING. SECURITY 

09:31:31.214 --> 09:31:39.811
ASSISTANCE FUNDS, AREN'T EVEN 
MENTIONED ON THE CALL. SECOND, 

09:31:40.784 --> 09:31:48.949
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, AND THE 
HIGHEST RANKING OFFICIALS IN THE

09:31:49.149 --> 09:31:51.491
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT, REPEATEDLY
HAVE SAID THERE WAS NO SQUID AND

09:31:52.603 --> 09:31:59.521
THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. FERN 
THIRD, THE UKRAINIANS WERE NOT 

09:32:00.276 --> 09:32:05.361
EVEN AWARE, OF THE POND CAN THE 
AID AT THE TIME OF THE CALL AND 

09:32:05.561 --> 09:32:10.686
WORK WHERE IT, DO NOT BECOME 
AWARE OF IT, AND SOME MORE THAN 

09:32:10.891 --> 09:32:19.172
ONE MONTH LATER. FOUR, THE ONLY 
WITNESSES, IN THE HOUSE RECORD

09:32:21.458 --> 09:32:26.725
WHO ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THE 
PRESIDENT ABOUT THE AID, 

09:32:27.688 --> 09:32:30.674
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AND SENATOR 
RON JOHNSON,

09:32:34.664 --> 09:32:38.310
SAY THE PRESIDENT WAS 
UNEQUIVOCAL IN SAYING, THERE WAS

09:32:39.074 --> 09:32:48.598
NO SQUID. FIFTH, AND THIS ONE IS
PRETTY OBVIOUS, THE AID

09:32:50.444 --> 09:32:58.011
FLOWED, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY MET, WITHOUT 

09:32:58.772 --> 09:33:05.728
ANY INVESTIGATION, STARTED OR 
ANNOUNCED. FINALLY, AND I ASK 

09:33:06.495 --> 09:33:15.277
YOU NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE BIG 
PICTURE HERE. BY PROVIDING LEGAL

09:33:15.481 --> 09:33:21.783
AID TO THE UKRAINE, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE, A 

09:33:21.983 --> 09:33:26.648
BETTER FRIEND AND ALLY TO 
UKRAINE THAN HIS PREDECESSOR. 

09:33:27.397 --> 09:33:29.397
THE TIME

09:33:31.120 --> 09:33:36.002
FOR THE HOUSE MANAGERS TO BRING 
THEIR CASE IS NOW. THEY HAD 

09:33:36.761 --> 09:33:41.739
THEIR CHANCE. TO DEVELOP THEIR 
EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY SENT THE 

09:33:41.891 --> 09:33:45.631
PEACH, TO THIS CHAMBER. THIS 
CHAMBER'S ROLE,

09:33:50.418 --> 09:33:54.042
TO THE HOUSE IS UP FOR IT. WITH 
THAT YIELD THE BALANCE OF MY 

09:33:54.188 --> 09:34:02.205
TIME TO PAT CIPOLLONE . THANK 
YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. JUST A 

09:34:02.962 --> 09:34:12.553
COUPLE OBSERVATIONS. FIRST OF 
ALL, AS MR. PUGH PURE SAID 

09:34:12.975 --> 09:34:15.406
ALL WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN
THIS QUESTION IS ADDRESSED. 

09:34:15.608 --> 09:34:21.706
UNDER THE RESOLUTION, THAT WILL 
BE NEXT WEEK. THIS RESOLUTION 

09:34:22.468 --> 09:34:24.468
WAS ACCEPTED

09:34:26.778 --> 09:34:29.421
100 TO NOTHING. SOME OF YOU WERE
HERE THEN AND THOUGHT IT WAS 

09:34:29.623 --> 09:34:32.762
GREAT. IF WE KEEP GOING LIKE 
THIS, IT WILL BE NEXT WEEK.

09:34:36.540 --> 09:34:39.579
FOR THOSE OF YOU KEEPING SCORE 
AT HOME, THEY HAVE NOT EVEN 

09:34:40.345 --> 09:34:49.321
STARTED YET. WERE HERE TODAY, WE
CAME, HOPING TO HAVE A TRIAL. 

09:34:49.735 --> 09:34:54.541
DAYS SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY, 
TELLING YOU, AND THE AMERICAN 

09:34:54.692 --> 09:35:01.308
PEOPLE, THEY CAN'T PROVE THEIR 
CASE. I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT 

09:35:01.509 --> 09:35:06.382
IN FIVE MINUTES AND SEND US ALL 
A LOT OF TIME. THEY CAME HERE, 

09:35:06.797 --> 09:35:11.825
TALKING ABOUT THE GAO. IT'S AN 
ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS FOR 

09:35:11.980 --> 09:35:17.567
CONGRESS. YOU KNOW WHO DISAGREES
WITH THE GAO? DON'T TAKE IT FROM

09:35:17.766 --> 09:35:23.137
ME. THEY DO. THEY SENT YOU 
PLEASE CALL, THAT MAKES NO CLAIM

09:35:23.656 --> 09:35:31.168
OF ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW. BY 
THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHO ALSO 

09:35:31.374 --> 09:35:34.014
DOESN'T? YOU CAN SEARCH HIGH AND
LOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOESN'T

09:35:34.776 --> 09:35:41.933
SAY? SQUID, BECAUSE THERE WASN'T
ANY. ONLY IN WASHINGTON, WOULD 

09:35:42.133 --> 09:35:48.031
SOMEONE SAY THAT IT IS WRONG 
WHEN YOU DO NOT SPEND 10 FAIR 

09:35:48.232 --> 09:35:52.904
DOLLARS PATINA, EVEN IF YOU 
SPEND THEM ON TIME. LET'S TALK 

09:35:53.669 --> 09:35:57.328
ABOUT THE HOUSE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE FOR A SECOND. TWO DAYS

09:35:58.348 --> 09:36:01.231
IN THE HOUSE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, TWO DAYS THE HOUSE 

09:36:01.994 --> 09:36:05.744
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS SUPPOSED 
TO BE IN CHARGE OF IMPEACHMENT. 

09:36:06.107 --> 09:36:10.123
THE DELIVERY TIME FOR THE 
ARTICLES THEY PRODUCE WAS 33 

09:36:10.275 --> 09:36:12.275
DAYS.

09:36:14.237 --> 09:36:16.469
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE FIRST 
IMPEACHMENT IN HISTORY FOR THE 

09:36:16.664 --> 09:36:20.119
DELIVERY TIME WAS LONGER, THEN 
THE INVESTIGATION IN THE HOUSE 

09:36:20.868 --> 09:36:29.465
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THEY COME 
HERE, AND FALSELY ACCUSE PEOPLE 

09:36:29.871 --> 09:36:33.737
BY THE WAY, THEY FALSELY ACCUSED
YOU YOU WERE ON TRIAL NOW. THEY 

09:36:33.937 --> 09:36:38.305
FALSELY ACCUSED PEOPLE OF TONY 
POLITICAL INVESTIGATION. REALLY.

09:36:42.261 --> 09:36:48.158
SINCE THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS TOOK 
OVER, THAT IS ALL WE HAVE HAD 

09:36:48.362 --> 09:36:54.538
FROM THEM. THEY USED THE OFFICE,
ALL THE MONEY THAT THE TAXPAYERS

09:36:56.683 --> 09:37:00.133
SEND TO WASHINGTON TO PAY THEM 
AND CONDUCT BONY POLITICAL 

09:37:00.908 --> 09:37:05.223
INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT AND AGAINST HIS FAMILY

09:37:05.426 --> 09:37:10.023
AND ANYONE WHO KNEW HIM, THEY 
STARTED IMPEACHING HIM, THE 

09:37:10.169 --> 09:37:12.169
MINUTE HE WAS ELECTED.

09:37:15.574 --> 09:37:20.621
THEY HAVE WHIP AND ICED THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, TO 

09:37:20.774 --> 09:37:28.577
INVESTIGATE INCESSANTLY THEIR 
POLITICAL OPPONENT. AND, THEY 

09:37:28.777 --> 09:37:31.107
COME HERE AND MAKE FALSE 
ALLEGATIONS OF PHONY

09:37:35.083 --> 09:37:37.083
POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS. I 
THINK THE DOCTORS CALL THAT 

09:37:37.213 --> 09:37:45.834
PROJECTION. IT IS TIME FOR IT TO
END. IT IS TIME FOR SOMEBODY, 

09:37:46.254 --> 09:37:50.305
FOR THE SENATE TO HOLD THEM 
ACCOUNTABLE. THINK ABOUT WHAT 

09:37:50.518 --> 09:37:53.361
THEY ARE ASKING. I SAID IT. THEY
DIDN'T DENY IT AND THEY ARE 

09:37:53.557 --> 09:37:59.857
TRYING TO REMOVE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S NAME FROM THE BALLOT. 

09:38:00.259 --> 09:38:03.924
THEY CANNOT PROVE THEIR CASE. 
THEY TOLD YOU THAT ALL DAY LONG.

09:38:04.122 --> 09:38:06.122
THINK ABOUT WHAT

09:38:08.995 --> 09:38:11.230
THEY ARE ASKING SOME OF YOU 
SENATORS TODAY. SOME OF YOU ARE 

09:38:11.429 --> 09:38:17.933
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THEY ARE 
ASKING YOU TO USE YOUR OFFICE TO

09:38:18.137 --> 09:38:21.889
REMOVE YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT 
FROM THE BALLOT. THAT IS WRONG.

09:38:25.852 --> 09:38:28.299
THAT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF 
OUR COUNTRY AND TO BE HONEST 

09:38:28.501 --> 09:38:35.408
WITH YOU, IT'S NOT REALLY A SHOW
CONFIDENCE. SO, WE WILL I 

09:38:35.606 --> 09:38:40.281
SUPPOSE HAVE THIS DEBATE AGAIN 
NEXT WEEK, IF WE EVER GET THERE.

09:38:40.481 --> 09:38:47.184
IT IS GETTING LATE. I WOULD ASK 
YOU RESPECTFULLY, IF WE COULD 

09:38:47.935 --> 09:38:54.498
SIMPLY START, MAYBE TOMORROW WE 
CAN START. THEY CAN MAKE THEIR 

09:38:55.257 --> 09:38:59.981
ARGUMENT AND THEY COULD I GUESS 
MAKE A CASE THAT THEY ONCE 

09:39:00.742 --> 09:39:02.742
CALLED OVERWHELMING. WE WILL 
SEE.

09:39:06.884 --> 09:39:09.677
BUT THIS RESOLUTION IS RIGHT, 
AND IT IS FAIR, AND IT MAKES 

09:39:09.819 --> 09:39:11.819
SENSE

09:39:12.982 --> 09:39:15.617
. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO HEAR WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO SAY, BEFORE YOU 

09:39:15.832 --> 09:39:18.265
HAVE TO DECIDE THESE CRITICAL 
ISSUES. THAT IS ALL THIS IS 

09:39:18.466 --> 09:39:24.149
ABOUT. IS IT NOW, OR IS IT ONE 
WEEK FROM NOW? SERIOUSLY. CAN WE

09:39:24.914 --> 09:39:32.823
PLEASE START? THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt;  MR.

09:39:38.576 --> 09:39:40.813
PAC IS YOUR SIDE COMPLETE? THANK
YOU. THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE 14 

09:39:41.571 --> 09:39:43.571
MINUTES REMAINING.

09:40:08.431 --> 09:40:11.380
WHAT THE FRAMERS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION WERE. A TRAIL OF

09:40:15.343 --> 09:40:20.829
ONE OATH OF OFFICE FOR PERSONAL 
GAIN. THE CORRUPTION OF OUR 

09:40:21.229 --> 09:40:24.015
MONTHLY HIGH CRIMES, AND 
MISDEMEANORS, THAT IS WHAT THIS 

09:40:24.162 --> 09:40:31.597
TRIAL IS ALL ABOUT. COUNSEL FOR 
THE PRESIDENT HAS DECLINED TO 

09:40:31.799 --> 09:40:35.402
ADDRESS THE SUBJECT OF MERIT, OF
THE AMENDMENT THAT HAVE BEEN 

09:40:35.546 --> 09:40:41.744
OFFERED. I TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT
HOUSE DEMOCRATS REALLY BEEN 

09:40:41.944 --> 09:40:46.219
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO OUST 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. NOTHING CAN BE 

09:40:46.425 --> 09:40:53.129
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. IN THE 
LAST YEAR WE PASSED 400 BILLS, 

09:40:53.530 --> 09:40:59.150
275 OF THOSE BILLS, ARE 
BIPARTISAN IN NATURE. ADDRESSING

09:41:00.632 --> 09:41:03.427
ISSUES LIKE LOWERING HEALTHCARE 
COST AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG 

09:41:03.616 --> 09:41:09.369
PRICES. TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAN
VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC. WE HAVE 

09:41:09.581 --> 09:41:14.054
WORKED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I 

09:41:14.249 --> 09:41:19.339
PERSONALLY WORKED WITH HIM ALONG
WITH ALL OF YOU ON THE FIRST. WE

09:41:19.531 --> 09:41:23.798
WORKED WITH HIM ON THE U.S. 
MEXICO CANADA TRADE AGREEMENT. 

09:41:24.000 --> 09:41:28.974
WE WORKED WITH HIM TO FUND THE 
GOVERNMENT. WE DO NOT HATE

09:41:32.532 --> 09:41:34.771
THIS PRESIDENT, BUT WE LOVE THE 
CONSTITUTION. WE LOVE AMERICA. 

09:41:34.973 --> 09:41:41.054
WE LOVE OUR DEMOCRACY. THAT'S 
WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. THE 

09:41:41.267 --> 09:41:43.267
QUESTION WAS ASKED,

09:41:49.949 --> 09:41:57.509
WHY, WHY WHY ARE WE HERE? LET ME
SEE IF I COULD POSIT AN ANSWER 

09:41:57.718 --> 09:42:03.396
TO THAT QUESTION. WE ARE HERE, 
SIR, BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

09:42:03.822 --> 09:42:07.465
PRESSURED FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO 
TARGET AN AMERICAN CITIZEN FOR 

09:42:07.664 --> 09:42:13.151
POLITICAL AND PERSONAL GAIN. WE 
ARE HERE BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP

09:42:13.355 --> 09:42:16.145
SOLICITED FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 
IN THE 2020 ELECTION, AND 

09:42:16.288 --> 09:42:22.042
CORRUPTED OUR DEMOCRACY. WE ARE 
HERE, SIR BECAUSE PRESIDENT 

09:42:22.190 --> 09:42:30.418
TRUMP WITH CHILD $391 MILLION IN
MILITARY AID FROM A VULNERABLE 

09:42:30.821 --> 09:42:36.664
UKRAINE WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION IN
A MANNER THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED 

09:42:36.825 --> 09:42:41.726
UNLAWFUL. WE ARE HERE, BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, ELEVATED

09:42:41.870 --> 09:42:43.870
HIS

09:42:48.492 --> 09:42:49.927
PERSONAL, POLITICAL INTEREST AND
SUBORDINATED THE NATIONAL 

09:42:49.928 --> 09:42:52.515
SECURITY INTEREST OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. WE ARE HERE, 

09:42:52.664 --> 09:42:58.658
SIR, BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ABUSED HIS POWER AND THEN, HE 

09:42:58.859 --> 09:43:05.562
TRIED TO COVER IT UP. WE ARE 
HERE, SIR, TO FOLLOW THE FACTS, 

09:43:05.764 --> 09:43:10.434
APPLIED TO LAW, TO BE GUIDED BY 
THE CONSTITUTION, AND PRESENT 

09:43:11.209 --> 09:43:17.452
THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE,

09:43:18.563 --> 09:43:26.880
MR. SECULAR IS YOU DON'T KNOW, 
NOW YOU KNOW. I YIELD TO MY 

09:43:27.852 --> 09:43:34.138
DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE, 
CHAIRMAN SHIFT. TRACKMAN 

09:43:34.139 --> 09:43:40.443
&gt;&gt; I THANK YOU FOR YIELDING. I 
WANT TO PROVIDE A COUPLE QUICK 

09:43:40.601 --> 09:43:49.838
BACK SIX; AT THE OTHER TABLE. 
FIRST, SECURITY ASSISTANCE FUNDS

09:43:50.038 --> 09:43:55.322
WEREN'T MENTIONED AT ALL, IN THE
JULY 25th CALL BETWEEN TRUMP AND

09:43:55.936 --> 09:43:57.936
THE ZELENSKY. LET'S THINK

09:44:01.421 --> 09:44:03.453
BACK TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN 
THE CALL. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER 

09:44:03.653 --> 09:44:07.303
FROM THAT CALL THAT ZELENSKY, 
THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE 

09:44:08.283 --> 09:44:12.525
JAVELIN ANTI-TANK WEAPONS AND 
SAYS, THEY'RE READY TO ORDER 

09:44:12.671 --> 09:44:18.894
MORE. AND WHAT IS TRUMP'S 
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE? I HAVE A 

09:44:19.093 --> 09:44:24.780
FAVOR TO ASK. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT 
THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE 

09:44:25.540 --> 09:44:31.893
BRINGING UP MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
THAT TRIGGERED HIM TO GO 

09:44:32.094 --> 09:44:35.290
IMMEDIATELY TO THE FAVOR, THAT 
HE WANTED? I THINK THAT'S 

09:44:35.433 --> 09:44:40.648
TELLING. IT TAKES PLACE IN THAT 
PART OF THE CONVERSATION. YES, 

09:44:41.605 --> 09:44:44.893
MILITARY ASSISTANCE DID COME UP 
IT CAME UP IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING

09:44:45.663 --> 09:44:53.016
THE ASK. WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE DO
YOU THINK THAT SENSE? THEY ARE 

09:44:53.774 --> 09:44:58.295
NOT STUPID. THE PEOPLE WATCHING 
THIS ARE NOT STUPID. HE SAYS, 

09:44:58.497 --> 09:45:01.987
WELL THEY NEVER FOUND OUT ABOUT 
IT. BUT IN MY FIND OUT ABOUT IT 

09:45:02.708 --> 09:45:07.230
UNTIL ONE MONTH LATER HE NEEDS 
TO BE MORE CAREFUL WITH HIS 

09:45:07.432 --> 09:45:09.463
EXPRESS LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT 
SOME OF THE TESTIMONY YOU'RE 

09:45:09.664 --> 09:45:14.493
GOING TO HEAR AND YOU WILL HEAR 
BECAUSE, IT TOOK PLACE IN THE 

09:45:14.641 --> 09:45:19.413
HOUSE. THEY ARE WITNESSES IF 
THERE WERE OTHER WITNESSES YOU 

09:45:19.628 --> 09:45:25.111
WOULD HEAR IT. YOU HAD CATHERINE
CROFT. SHE'S A CAREER OFFICIAL 

09:45:25.311 --> 09:45:31.398
FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT. SHE 
TALKED ABOUT, HOW QUICKLY AFTER 

09:45:31.599 --> 09:45:33.599
THE FREEZE WENT INTO PLACE, 
UKRAINIANS FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. 

09:45:33.632 --> 09:45:38.458
SHE STARTED TO GET CONTACT. SHE 
SAID SHE WAS REALLY IMPRESSED 

09:45:38.608 --> 09:45:45.158
WITH THE DIPLOMATIC CRANE CRAFT.
SHE WAS IMPRESSED WITH HOW 

09:45:45.341 --> 09:45:49.481
QUICKLY THE CRANE FOUND OUT 
ABOUT IT. UKRAINE FOUND OUT 

09:45:50.097 --> 09:45:58.779
ABOUT IT IN FACT, LAURA COOPER, 
A CAREER OFFICIAL AT THE DEFENSE

09:45:58.930 --> 09:46:00.930
DEPARTMENT,

09:46:05.942 --> 09:46:07.942
SAID HER OFFICE STARTED GETTING 
INQUIRIES FROM UKRAINE ABOUT THE

09:46:07.969 --> 09:46:10.407
ISSUES WITH THE AID, ON JULY 
25th, THE VERY DAY OF CALL. SO 

09:46:10.605 --> 09:46:16.086
MUCH FOR UKRAINE NOT FINDING OUT
ABOUT THIS FOR ONE MONTH LATER. 

09:46:16.502 --> 09:46:18.523
I THOUGHT THIS WAS VERY TELLING 
TOO. THE NEW YORK TIMES 

09:46:19.273 --> 09:46:23.608
DISCLOSED, THAT JULY 30th, 
WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE CALL 

09:46:23.810 --> 09:46:28.074
BETWEEN TRUMP AND ZELENSKY, 
UKRAINE'S FOREIGN MINISTRY 

09:46:28.838 --> 09:46:30.838
RECEIVED A

09:46:33.157 --> 09:46:35.179
TABLE INDICATING, TRUMP HAD 
FROZEN MILITARY AID WITHIN ONE 

09:46:35.403 --> 09:46:40.462
WEEK. THAT CABLE WENT FROM 
UKRAINIAN AND PROCEED TO THE 

09:46:40.865 --> 09:46:44.277
FOREIGN MINISTRY. THE FORMER 
UKRAINIAN DEPUTY

09:46:50.617 --> 09:46:52.448
FOREIGN MINISTER SAID," WE HAVE 
THIS INFORMATION. IT WAS 

09:46:52.449 --> 09:46:54.572
DEFINITELY MENTIONED THERE WERE 
SOME ISSUES. SHE WENT ON TO SAY 

09:46:54.720 --> 09:46:58.897
THE CABLE, WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY 
PROVIDED TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKY'S

09:46:59.040 --> 09:47:04.021
OFFICE. YOU WILL LEARN MORE 
ABOUT LATER A TOP AIDE TO 

09:47:04.772 --> 09:47:08.121
ZELENSKY, REPORTEDLY DIRECTED 
HER TO KEEP SILENT, NOT DISCUSS 

09:47:08.701 --> 09:47:17.026
THE WHOLE WITH REPORTERS OR 
CONGRESS. WE HAVE TESTIMONY, 

09:47:17.238 --> 09:47:21.210
THEY KNEW. YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY. 
ZELENSKY DIDN'T WANT HIS

09:47:24.739 --> 09:47:26.977
PEOPLE TO KNOW THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES WAS ON BACK 

09:47:27.188 --> 09:47:29.424
AID FROM HIM. WHAT DOES THAT 
LOOK LIKE FOR THE NEW PRESIDENT?

09:47:29.626 --> 09:47:33.899
HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE 
HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

09:47:34.092 --> 09:47:38.961
DEFEND HIS OWN COUNTRY AND HE 
DIDN'T WANT THEM TO KNOW ABOUT 

09:47:39.162 --> 09:47:43.843
IT? MORE THAN THAT, HE DIDN'T 
WANT RUSSIANS TO KNOW ABOUT IT. 

09:47:44.245 --> 09:47:46.571
SO, YES, THE UKRAINIANS KEPT IT 
CLOSE TO THE VEST.

09:47:51.103 --> 09:47:59.278
NOW, HE WENT ON TO SAY, THE 
UKRAINIANS SAY, THEY DON'T FEEL 

09:47:59.480 --> 09:48:02.080
ANY PRESSURE. THAT'S WHAT THEY 
SAY NOW. WE KNOW THAT'S NOT 

09:48:02.217 --> 09:48:04.217
TRUE.

09:48:05.988 --> 09:48:08.428
WE HAVE TESTIMONY DAY DID NOT 
WANT TO BE USED AS A POLITICAL 

09:48:09.171 --> 09:48:13.035
PAWN IN U.S. DOMESTIC POLITICS. 
THERE IS IT THAT IT YOU'LL HEAR 

09:48:13.183 --> 09:48:21.830
MORE TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT. THEY 
TRIED TO WATER DOWN. THEY TRIED 

09:48:22.034 --> 09:48:29.081
TO LEAVE OUT SPECIFICS. THIS IS 
NOT GOING TO BE CREDIBLE. ADD 

09:48:29.230 --> 09:48:34.775
2016. YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THE 
PRESSURE. THEY FELT IT. SO, WHY 

09:48:34.923 --> 09:48:40.513
ISN'T ZELENSKY SAYING NOW, HE'S 
PRESSURED. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE 

09:48:40.716 --> 09:48:44.379
IMPACT OF THAT? CAN YOU IMAGINE 
THE IMPACT IF HE HAD TO 

09:48:45.141 --> 09:48:47.141
ACKNOWLEDGE TODAY,

09:48:50.061 --> 09:48:52.296
WE FELT PRESSURED. YOU WOULD 
TOO. WE ARE AT WAR WITH RUSSIA. 

09:48:52.497 --> 09:48:55.181
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. YEAH, WE 
FELT PRESSURE WE NEEDED THAT 

09:48:56.107 --> 09:49:05.501
MILITARY AID. I CANNOT GET IN 
THE WAY. I CANNOT EVEN GET IN 

09:49:05.700 --> 09:49:10.580
THE WHITE-HOT DOOR. DO YOU THINK
I WILL GO OUT NOW, AND ADMIT TO 

09:49:11.337 --> 09:49:18.701
THIS SCHEME? ANYBODY WHO HAS 
WATCHED THIS PRESIDENT FOR THE 

09:49:19.473 --> 09:49:23.175
LAST THREE YOU KNOW HOW 
VINDICTIVE HE CAN BE. DO YOU 

09:49:23.371 --> 09:49:26.371
THINK IT WOULD BE SMART FOR 
ZELENSKY TO CONTRADICT THE 

09:49:26.522 --> 09:49:31.909
PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE SO 
DIRECTLY HE'S PLAYING AND 

09:49:32.672 --> 09:49:34.672
PREACHED FOR?

09:49:37.381 --> 09:49:41.454
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED HE 
WOULD DENY IT. WE SHOULD NOT BE 

09:49:41.649 --> 09:49:49.169
SURPRISED IF HE ADMITTED IT. 
NOW, LET ME END WITH A COUPLE 

09:49:50.124 --> 09:49:56.271
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT PAT 
CIPOLLONE'S COMMENTS. HE SAYS,  

09:49:56.688 --> 09:50:00.505
THIS IS NO BIG DEAL. WE ARE NOT 
TALKING ABOUT ONE WE WILL HAVE 

09:50:00.648 --> 09:50:02.648
WITNESSES.

09:50:04.604 --> 09:50:07.038
WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN. WE ARE 
JUST TIME I WENT, AS IF, WELL 

09:50:07.252 --> 09:50:10.648
LATER THEY ARE GOING TO SAY YES 
WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE WITNESSES 

09:50:10.801 --> 09:50:13.041
NOW. IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF 
WHEN. OKAY.

09:50:16.587 --> 09:50:21.268
AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID, LET'S BE 
REAL. THERE WILL BE NO WHEN. 

09:50:21.473 --> 09:50:25.327
THERE WILL BE NO WHEN. DO YOU 
THINK THEY WILL HAVE AN EPIPHANY

09:50:26.084 --> 09:50:34.258
FEW DAYS FROM NOW. THEIR GOAL 
IS, GET YOU TO SAY NO NOW. GET 

09:50:34.458 --> 09:50:37.037
YOU HAVE THE TRIAL. THEN ARGUE,

09:50:41.164 --> 09:50:43.761
MAKE IT GO AWAY. LET'S DISMISSED
THE WHOLE THING. THAT'S THE 

09:50:43.919 --> 09:50:50.512
PLAN. A VOTE TO DELAY IT'S A 
VOTE TO DENY LET'S MAKE NO 

09:50:50.715 --> 09:50:52.815
MISTAKE ABOUT THAT. THEY WILL 
NOT HAVE A EPIPHANY FEW DAYS 

09:50:53.512 --> 09:50:59.246
FROM NOW. THEY WILL NOT SAY 
AMERICANS JUST THE ANSWERS. THE 

09:50:59.446 --> 09:51:03.912
WHOLE GOAL IS THAT YOU WILL 
NEVER GET TO THAT POINT. THEY 

09:51:04.125 --> 09:51:09.356
WILL NEVER GET TO THAT POINT. 
WHEN THEY SAY WHEN, THEY MAY 

09:51:09.504 --> 09:51:14.636
NEVER. 
&gt;&gt; 

09:51:19.149 --> 09:51:27.630

OTHER ANY SENATORS WISHING TO

THE AMENDMENT IS TABLED. MR. 
MAJORITY LEADER IS RECOGNIZED. 

09:57:20.431 --> 09:57:22.431
OUR

09:57:24.365 --> 09:57:26.365
ASKED DEMOCRATIC LEADER, ARE 
CERTAIN SIMILARITIES TO THESE 

09:57:26.516 --> 09:57:31.679
AMENDMENTS WHETHER HE MIGHT BE 
WILLING TO ENTER INTO A CONSENT 

09:57:31.881 --> 09:57:37.916
AGREEMENT TO STOCK THESE VOTES. 
WITHOUT A OBJECTION IT IS 

09:57:38.056 --> 09:57:43.800
PERMITTED. THANK YOU MR. CHIEF 
JUSTICE THE BOTTOM LINE IS 

09:57:43.942 --> 09:57:50.770
SIMPLE AND HAS BEEN CLEAR TO 
EVERY SENATOR AND THE COUNTRY, 

09:57:51.189 --> 09:57:53.123
WE BELIEVE WITNESSES AND 
DOCUMENTS ARE EXTREMELY 

09:57:53.124 --> 09:57:57.633
IMPORTANT AND A COMPELLING CASE 
UP AND MADE FOR THEM. WE WILL 

09:57:57.777 --> 09:58:02.924
VOTE ON ALL OF THOSE. WE WILL 
ALSO WITHOUT CONSULTING US MAKE 

09:58:03.073 --> 09:58:08.857
CHANGES A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES THAT DEVIATED FROM THE 

09:58:09.058 --> 09:58:13.620
1999 CLINT RESOLUTION. WE WANT 
TO CHANGE THOSE WERE WILLING

09:58:18.610 --> 09:58:20.629
TO DO SOME OF THOSE VOTES, 
TOMORROW. THERE'S NO REASON WE 

09:58:20.845 --> 09:58:23.077
HAVE TO DO THEM ALL, TONIGHT AND
INCONVENIENCE THE SENATE AND THE

09:58:23.838 --> 09:58:27.900
CHIEF JUSTICE. WE WILL NOT BACK 
OFF GETTING VOTES ON ALL THESE 

09:58:28.040 --> 09:58:30.040
AMENDMENTS,

09:58:32.620 --> 09:58:35.017
WHICH WE REGARD AS EXTREMELY 
SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT TO THE

09:58:35.160 --> 09:58:40.083
COUNTRY. 
&gt;&gt; AS I'VE SAID REPEATEDLY, ALL 

09:58:40.229 --> 09:58:43.991
THESE AMENDMENTS UNDER THE 
RESOLUTION, COULD BE DEALT WITH 

09:58:44.191 --> 09:58:46.191
AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

09:58:49.479 --> 09:58:51.998
THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLE. 
MR. ALEXANDER.

09:59:31.878 --> 09:59:33.878
WHAT'S HAPPENING

10:02:36.100 --> 10:02:39.821
YOUR McCONNELL ASKING IF THEY 
COULD LUMP THEM ALL TOGETHER AND

10:02:40.022 --> 10:02:42.022
VOTE ON THEM AT ONCE.

10:02:46.521 --> 10:02:48.795
THERE IS NO RUSH IN GETTING IT 
ALL DONE, TONIGHT. HOWEVER RIGHT

10:02:48.968 --> 10:02:54.240
NOW, 930 P.M. EASTERN, LEADER 
McCONNELL WANTS TO WRAP THIS UP 

10:02:54.452 --> 10:02:58.864
AND MOVE FORWARD. SO, WE ARE 
WAITING TO SEE WHICH WILL 

10:02:59.012 --> 10:03:05.009
PREVAIL. SO, STAY TUNED FOR THAT
. LET'S GET MY COLLEAGUE ON 

10:03:05.769 --> 10:03:15.372
CAPITOL HILL. RON SENATORS UNDER
LISTEN. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 

10:03:15.774 --> 10:03:19.425
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT 
JUST HOW THIS WILL GO. WHAT HAS 

10:03:19.639 --> 10:03:21.254
BEEN THE WAY TODAY ON CAPITOL 
HILL? 

10:03:21.255 --> 10:03:23.255
&gt;&gt; WELL THE MOOD

10:03:28.377 --> 10:03:30.407
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS NEXT AND FROM THE 

10:03:30.599 --> 10:03:33.248
BEGINNING, TODAY'S SENATOR 
SCHUMER SAID, HE WILL BRING A 

10:03:33.448 --> 10:03:35.283
SERIES, HE SAID SERIES OF 
AMENDMENTS, TODAY. IN THE 

10:03:35.284 --> 10:03:40.504
MORNING HE WAS NOT VERY 
FORTHCOMING ABOUT HOW MANY HE 

10:03:40.642 --> 10:03:47.062
HAD. WE ARE ENTERING NUMBER 
FIVE, THIS HAS BEEN A PART OF 

10:03:47.261 --> 10:03:49.568
THE DEMOCRATS STRATEGIES TO 
BRING UP THE EXTRA WITNESSES 

10:03:49.902 --> 10:03:56.402
THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM. THEY ARE
DISCUSSING RULES WE DON'T KNOW 

10:03:56.610 --> 10:04:01.880
WHAT WILL HAPPEN, NEXT. BUT, 
THERE IS A SENSE OF FATIGUE. WE 

10:04:02.098 --> 10:04:07.575
ARE HEARING, SOME SENATORS ARE 
NOT RETURNING TO THE CHAMBER WE 

10:04:07.775 --> 10:04:12.602
HAVE SEEN IMMEDIATE PACKING UP, 
FOR THE DAY THERE'S A SENSE OF 

10:04:12.752 --> 10:04:17.124
FATIGUE. IT HAS GONE LONGER THEN
MAYBE SOME ANTICIPATED, THE DATE

10:04:17.325 --> 10:04:21.682
TO CAPTURE THAT PETITE I WANT TO
PLAY, TAPE WHERE THE WHITE HOUSE

10:04:22.552 --> 10:04:29.456
COUNSEL PAT CIPOLLONE  MENTIONED
WE NEED TO MOVE ON. LISTEN TO 

10:04:29.602 --> 10:04:31.602
THIS. JEFF, SO,

10:04:34.787 --> 10:04:37.439
WE WILL, AS OPPOSED CAMPUS 
DEBATE, AGAIN, NEXT WEEK, IF WE 

10:04:37.639 --> 10:04:44.271
EVER GET THERE. IT IS GETTING 
LATE. I WOULD ASK YOU, 

10:04:44.417 --> 10:04:49.770
RESPECTFULLY, IF WE COULD SIMPLY
START. MAYBE TOMORROW, WE CAN 

10:04:49.916 --> 10:04:55.509
START. THEY CAN MAKE THEIR 
ARGUMENT AND I GUESS, MAKE A 

10:04:55.710 --> 10:05:00.684
CASE THEY ONCE CALLED 
OVERWHELMING. WE WILL SEE.

10:05:05.060 --> 10:05:07.853
BUT, THIS RESOLUTION IS RIGHT, 
AND IT IS FAIR, AND IT MAKES 

10:05:08.025 --> 10:05:10.025
SENSE.

10:05:11.564 --> 10:05:14.001
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO HEAR WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO SAY, BEFORE YOU 

10:05:14.752 --> 10:05:18.401
DECIDE, THERE'S CRITICAL ISSUES.
THAT'S ALL THIS IS ABOUT, IS IT 

10:05:18.544 --> 10:05:24.757
NOW OR A WEEK FROM NOW? 
SERIOUSLY. CAN WE PLEASE START? 

10:05:25.728 --> 10:05:27.728
&gt;&gt;

10:05:30.244 --> 10:05:36.745
PAT CIPOLLONE,  THE LEAD COUNSEL
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT HAS 

10:05:36.949 --> 10:05:41.827
BEEN THE STRATEGY FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE? THE REPUBLICANS SAY, THEY

10:05:42.027 --> 10:05:44.826
JUST WANT TO MOVE ON. TOO MUCH 
OF NORMALLY START OPENING 

10:05:44.972 --> 10:05:46.972
ARGUMENTS. THE HOUSE MANAGERS,

10:05:51.166 --> 10:05:53.406
HAVE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF THE 
DAY HAMMERING AWAY ON THE POINTS

10:05:53.607 --> 10:05:56.038
OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS. THEY HAVE
BEEN GOING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE 

10:05:56.250 --> 10:06:00.917
COMPILED BY THE HOUSE. THEY HAVE
VISUAL AIDS TO SELL DIFFERENT 

10:06:01.676 --> 10:06:06.971
TESTIMONY IN NEWS REPORTS AND 
THEY CAME PREPARE FOR ALL THESE 

10:06:07.119 --> 10:06:11.211
AMENDMENTS. IT IS INTERESTING TO
SEE BOTH SIDES APPROACH TODAY 

10:06:11.361 --> 10:06:15.743
DIFFERENTLY. 
&gt;&gt; AT THIS POINT WE HAVE SEEN 

10:06:15.946 --> 10:06:19.082
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AWAY FROM 
THE TABLE. THE BOTTOM RIGHT 

10:06:19.397 --> 10:06:24.425
AREA, IS WHERE TRUMP'S LEGAL 
TEAM SET AND THEY HAVE LEFT NOW.

10:06:26.910 --> 10:06:28.910
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THE 
DEMOCRATS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF 

10:06:29.506 --> 10:06:33.507
THE SCREEN, THEY HAVE BEEN 
MILLING AROUND A BIT WE DID HERE

10:06:33.828 --> 10:06:38.694
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL ASK, WHY ARE
WE HERE? IT REALLY GAVE 

10:06:39.446 --> 10:06:46.827
DEMOCRATS AND OPENING TO GIVE A 
ROBUST ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, 

10:06:47.026 --> 10:06:52.060
WHY ARE WE HERE? HE WENT BACK TO
THE CASE AND GIVE A STRONG 

10:06:52.219 --> 10:06:57.795
ORATORY FASHION, HE LAID OUT WHY
EXACTLY, THEY ARE HERE. IT MAY 

10:06:58.556 --> 10:07:02.658
HAVE BEEN RHETORICAL ON BEHALF 
OF TRUMP'S TEAM BUT CONGRESSMAN 

10:07:03.073 --> 10:07:06.125
JEFFERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT 
MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYBODY, 

10:07:06.525 --> 10:07:12.632
WISHING INKS WE ARE HERE. AND 
ALSO, HOW WE GOT HERE. LET'S GO 

10:07:12.828 --> 10:07:18.001
THROUGH HOW SCHUMER TRIED TO GET
SUPPORT FOR SO FAR.

10:07:22.578 --> 10:07:24.814
HE WANTED TO SEE DOCUMENTS AND 
INFO FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

10:07:25.017 --> 10:07:27.582
FROM OMB AND ALSO, THIS DATE 
DEPARTMENT WE ARE EXPECTING 

10:07:27.762 --> 10:07:31.304
QUESTIONS, TO COME UP ABOUT 
WHETHER WE HAVE DEFENSE 

10:07:31.505 --> 10:07:36.988
DOCUMENTS TO COME FORWARD. THERE
WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER 

10:07:37.407 --> 10:07:42.550
MITT COULD BE SUBPOENAED WHAT 
STANDS OUT TO YOU ON THAT LIST? 

10:07:43.035 --> 10:07:49.584
&gt;&gt;? WAS THE LAST TWO AMENDMENTS 
THE SUB TINA AND ALSO SO TINA 

10:07:50.539 --> 10:07:57.102
FOR AMICK. THOSE THINGS ARE 
CRITICAL TO THE QUESTION OF 

10:07:57.304 --> 10:08:04.169
WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP WITHHELD 
AID. DID THAT HAPPEN? AND MAKE

10:08:08.070 --> 10:08:10.503
IS THE KEY WITNESS THAT KNOWS A 
LOT GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES 

10:08:10.719 --> 10:08:16.551
AND LOWS ABOUT OLDER WITNESSES. 
THOSE LAST TWO WERE VERY 

10:08:16.699 --> 10:08:23.506
IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE DEMOCRATS
CASE, TO BRING FORWARD EVIDENCE,

10:08:23.718 --> 10:08:27.169
EXISTING EVIDENCE AND ALSO NEW 
EVIDENCE AND MET. AYE, THE OTHER

10:08:27.371 --> 10:08:31.477
THING LIKE  WHAT HOW SUBPOENAED 
DOCUMENTS AND THOSE THINGS 

10:08:31.637 --> 10:08:36.920
COURSE WOULD SUPPORT EVIDENCE 
AND I THINK THAT HE'S RIGHT 

10:08:37.119 --> 10:08:39.155
THERE, WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OMB 
DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY OF MICK 

10:08:39.358 --> 10:08:43.821
MULVANEY MULVANEY.  WE ARE 
WATCHING OUT TO SEE IF THERE'S 

10:08:44.025 --> 10:08:46.025
GOING TO BE

10:08:48.903 --> 10:08:53.775
THINGS CONTINUING TONIGHT OR IF 
THERE WILL BE A POSITIVE WE ARE 

10:08:53.981 --> 10:08:56.004
WATCHING TO SEE WHAT SENATORS 
ARE GOING TO BE COMING OUT 

10:08:56.219 --> 10:08:58.543
TONIGHT TO DEMOCRATS COULD GET 
THEIR WAY AND KEEP INTRODUCING

10:09:02.305 --> 10:09:04.305
AMENDMENTS ONE AFTER THE OTHER 
DRAGGING THIS OUT QUITE LATE 

10:09:04.341 --> 10:09:10.021
INTO THE NIGHT OR IF DEMOCRATS 
GO TO ALL OF THEM ALL AT ONCE IN

10:09:10.235 --> 10:09:14.701
ONE SWEEPING VOTE. THEY COULD 
ALSO CONTINUE TO SLOPPIER RUN 

10:09:14.900 --> 10:09:18.352
WHY DO DEMOCRATS NOT WANT TO 
BROTHER, WHY DO REPUBLICANS NOT 

10:09:18.761 --> 10:09:23.485
TO STOP HER NOW AND START FRESH 
IN THE MORNING WITH DEMOCRATS 

10:09:23.634 --> 10:09:29.318
CONTINUING TO OFFER MEMBERS? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS STRATEGY IS TO 

10:09:29.523 --> 10:09:31.673
TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

10:09:35.224 --> 10:09:38.411
IT'S ONLY GOING TO DELAY OPENING
ARGUMENTS. BEFORE THE TRIAL 

10:09:38.553 --> 10:09:44.554
BEGAN, REPUBLICAN SAY, THEY WANT
TO GET THIS MOVING AND GET IT 

10:09:44.757 --> 10:09:48.820
STARTED. WE HEARD THOSE COMMENTS
FROM PAT CIPOLLONE THROUGHOUT 

10:09:49.020 --> 10:09:54.102
THE DAY. LET'S JUST GET STARTED.
THEY COULD WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW 

10:09:54.505 --> 10:09:56.738
TO CARRY THROUGH WITH THESE 
OTHER SCHUMER AMENDMENTS. THAT 

10:09:56.952 --> 10:10:01.217
WILL ONLY PROLONG THIS WEEK. ONE
OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED 

10:10:01.618 --> 10:10:05.272
TODAY THAT FEELS LIKE IT COULD 
HAVE AND FOREVER AGO BUT THE 

10:10:05.472 --> 10:10:08.324
11th HOUR DECISION BY HOUSE 
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL 

10:10:08.537 --> 10:10:12.585
TO CHANGE A PART OF ORGANIZING 
RESOLUTION, TO NOT CONDEMN THE 

10:10:13.536 --> 10:10:17.468
OPENING ARGUMENT. AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE DAY IT WAS A 

10:10:18.231 --> 10:10:22.535
FLUSH BETWEEN IMMIGRANTS AND 
REPUBLICANS. DEMOCRAT SAID, IT'S

10:10:22.749 --> 10:10:27.003
GOING BY WAY TOO FAST. SCHUMER 
HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE AT 11 

10:10:27.762 --> 10:10:33.716
A.M. TODAY. IT WAS A DISGRACE 
THAT HE WAS GOING TO HANDLE IT 

10:10:33.916 --> 10:10:38.387
BY THESE AMENDMENTS. THERE HAS 
BEEN REPORTING IN THE LAST TWO 

10:10:38.587 --> 10:10:42.237
HOURS IT WAS THAT ONCE CAUCUS 
MEETING THAT PUBLICANS HAD, WERE

10:10:42.451 --> 10:10:46.301
THEY CAME FORWARD AND SAID, LOOK
WERE CONCERNED THIS IS GOING ON 

10:10:46.517 --> 10:10:51.585
LITTLE TOO FAST. WE ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BEING 

10:10:52.334 --> 10:10:57.313
BROKEN UP IN TWO DAYS. SENATOR 
COLLINS OF MAINE AND PORTMAN, 

10:10:58.033 --> 10:11:05.807
WERE THE TWO SENATORS THAT WERE 
SAYING THAT, WE NEED TO DO 

10:11:06.008 --> 10:11:09.255
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND CHANGE 
IT. THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE 

10:11:09.469 --> 10:11:12.918
VERY INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT 
THE DAY, HE SAW THE LEADER IN 

10:11:13.320 --> 10:11:19.002
THE SENATE CHANGE SOMETHING HE 
HAS SAID SINCE LAST NIGHT. 

10:11:19.424 --> 10:11:24.092
SOMETHING HE WILL BE 
CONSIDERING. CHECK MY AMBER, WE 

10:11:24.701 --> 10:11:29.730
HAVE SEEN THAT TRUMP LEGAL TEAM 
RETURNED TO THE SENATE WILL 

10:11:29.887 --> 10:11:34.654
THERE. WE WILL SEE IF WE GET A 
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IS GOING TO

10:11:34.854 --> 10:11:36.854
BE HAPPENING NEXT.

10:11:39.321 --> 10:11:41.553
McCONNELL HAS SAID WE CAN DEAL 
WITH ALL OF THESE AMENDMENTS AT 

10:11:41.754 --> 10:11:48.420
THE POLICE TIME. WE ALREADY HAVE
OPENING ARGUMENTS TAKEN CARE OF.

10:11:48.560 --> 10:11:53.898
WHAT IS YOUR READ ABOUT HOW 
THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT NOW, 

10:11:54.045 --> 10:11:56.045
AMBER?

10:11:57.804 --> 10:12:03.659
TUESDAY GOING SO LATE HAS CAUSED
EVERYBODY IN THE SENATE TO BE 

10:12:03.806 --> 10:12:05.806
SURPRISED.

10:12:07.363 --> 10:12:11.968
THESE FOLKS HAVE TO HAVE 
WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS AT THE 

10:12:12.113 --> 10:12:21.375
OUTSET. HE HAS KEPT IT CLOSE TO 
TRUST. EACH REQUIRES IT TWO HOUR

10:12:21.577 --> 10:12:23.577
DEBATE FROM BOTH SIDES.

10:12:27.061 --> 10:12:31.074
THIS IS UP IN THE AIR, NOW. 
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

10:12:31.217 --> 10:12:37.015
McCONNELL DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE 
PLANNED FOR THIS. IT'S A 

10:12:37.213 --> 10:12:41.837
STANDOFF BETWEEN THESE TWO 
LEADERS. CONNELL IS A ROUGH 

10:12:41.988 --> 10:12:47.164
SCHEDULE. DUE DATE HAVE 
EVERYBODY TAKE A BREAK AND TAKE 

10:12:47.925 --> 10:12:53.049
A BREATH AND PICK IT UP? YOU 
KNOW, I WAS GOING THROUGH MY 

10:12:53.265 --> 10:12:58.535
HEAD, OF THE BENEFITS 
POLITICALLY AND NEGATIVES FOR IT

10:12:58.747 --> 10:13:05.987
GOES ON SALON. SO LONG. 
&gt;&gt; SPOKE OF THE CLERK WILL 

10:13:06.142 --> 10:13:08.142
REPORT.

10:13:14.537 --> 10:13:19.672

SCHUMER PROPOSES AN AMENDMENT

10:18:50.835 --> 10:18:59.096
MOVING. THE WHOLE TIME, THE ONLY
THING I CAN THINK ABOUT, IS HOW 

10:18:59.297 --> 10:19:04.979
LATE IT IS IN OTHER PLACES. 
BECAUSE, RIGHT NOW, IT'S THE 

10:19:05.181 --> 10:19:07.181
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN EUROPE.

10:19:10.669 --> 10:19:17.973
WE HAVE OVER 60,000 U.S. TROOPS,
AND THERE ARE HELICOPTER PILOTS 

10:19:18.186 --> 10:19:20.970
FLIGHT ON TRAINING MISSIONS. 
TANKERS, MANEUVERING ACROSS 

10:19:21.134 --> 10:19:29.761
FIELDS AND INFANTRYMEN, WALKING 
WITH 100 POUND BACKPACKS AND YET

10:19:29.960 --> 10:19:33.350
UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS ARE GETTING 
READY TO WAKE UP IN THE 

10:19:33.496 --> 10:19:38.638
TRENCHES, FIGHTING OFF AGAINST 
RUSSIAN TRACKS AND TANKS RIGHT 

10:19:38.820 --> 10:19:44.027
NOW. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THOSE 
PEOPLE, WHAT HER START ABOUT 

10:19:44.382 --> 10:19:49.205
TIRED WE ARE OR HOW LATE IT IS. 
WE HAVE TIME TO HAVE THIS 

10:19:49.411 --> 10:19:53.315
DEBATE. THAT'S WHY THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS 

10:19:53.529 --> 10:19:57.583
AMENDMENT TO SUBPOENA HE 
DOCUMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

10:19:58.347 --> 10:20:03.481
DEFENSE. JUST LIKE THE SUBPOENA 
FOR ON THE, THE DOCUMENTS SPEAK 

10:20:03.885 --> 10:20:11.805
DIRECTLY TO ONE OF TRUMP'S 
ABUSES. HIS WITHHOLDING, THE 

10:20:12.569 --> 10:20:15.255
CRITICAL MILITARY AID FROM OUR 
PARTNER IN THE UKRAINE TO 

10:20:16.007 --> 10:20:22.983
FURTHER HIS PERSONAL CLINICAL 
CAMPAIGN. $250 MILLION OF 

10:20:23.944 --> 10:20:29.764
TAXPAYER MONEY WAS PART OF THE 
UKRAINE SECURITY ASSISTANCE 

10:20:30.442 --> 10:20:38.176
INITIATIVE. THESE FUNDS, 
APPROVED BY 87 SENATORS IN THIS 

10:20:38.324 --> 10:20:45.118
ROOM, WOULD PURCHASE ADDITIONAL 
TRAINING, EQUIPMENT, AND 

10:20:45.521 --> 10:20:47.710
ADVISING TO STRENGTHEN THE 
CAPACITY OF THE CRANE'S ARMED 

10:20:47.861 --> 10:20:51.695
FORCES. THE EQUIPMENT APPROVED 
INCLUDED SNIPER RIFLES, ROCKET 

10:20:52.589 --> 10:20:58.322
PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHERS AND 
READER AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES. 

10:20:58.728 --> 10:21:03.556
THIS WAS TO BE PURCHASED ALMOST 
EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMERICAN 

10:21:03.712 --> 10:21:09.293
BUSINESSES. THIS EQUIPMENT ALONG
WITH TRAINING PROVIDED BY DOD, 

10:21:09.693 --> 10:21:14.977
WAS INTENDED TO PROTECT OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY BY HELPING OUR

10:21:15.177 --> 10:21:23.309
FRIEND UKRAINE FIGHT AGAINST 
BRITAIN'S RUSSIA. IS RUSSIA. THE

10:21:23.509 --> 10:21:28.178
PRESIDENT MADE THE ARGUMENT, 
WELL, IT MADE IT THERE. THE AIDE

10:21:28.377 --> 10:21:32.846
EVENTUALLY MADE IT THERE. THE 
DELAY DOESN'T MATTER AND YOU 

10:21:33.264 --> 10:21:37.727
HEARD ME TALK ABOUT WHAT HE DOES
MATTER. WHAT IT DIDN'T SAY IS 

10:21:37.926 --> 10:21:43.410
THAT, ALL THE AIDE HASN'T MADE 
IT THERE. CONGRESS HAD TO PASS 

10:21:43.626 --> 10:21:52.962
IN OF THE LAW THAT $35.2 MILLION
OF THAT AID WOULD NOT FIRE. TO 

10:21:53.730 --> 10:21:56.161
THIS DAY, 18

10:21:59.659 --> 10:22:01.696
AND HALF MILLION DOLLARS REMAINS
OUTSTANDING HAS NOT MADE ITS WAY

10:22:01.897 --> 10:22:06.486
TO THE BATTLEFIELD. IT WAS DOD 
THAT REPEATEDLY ADVISED

10:22:10.028 --> 10:22:11.859
THE WHITE HOUSE, ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE SECURITY 

10:22:11.860 --> 10:22:14.904
ASSISTANCE NOT ONLY UKRAINE, BUT
U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY. IT WAS 

10:22:15.096 --> 10:22:21.753
DOD IN AUGUST, 2019 WARNED ON 
THE THE FREEZE WAS UNLAWFUL IN 

10:22:21.900 --> 10:22:25.606
THE FUNDS COULD BE LOST AS A 
RESULT IT WOULD DOD THE 

10:22:25.749 --> 10:22:28.509
SCRAMBLED THIRD THE HOLD WAS 
LIFTED WITHOUT EXPLANATION ON 

10:22:28.908 --> 10:22:34.193
SEPTEMBER 11 THIS END OF THE 
FUNDS BEFORE THEY EXPIRED AT THE

10:22:34.392 --> 10:22:39.677
END OF THE MONTH. WITHOUT A 
DOUBT, DOD HUSKY DOCUMENTS THE 

10:22:39.891 --> 10:22:42.135
PRESIDENT HAS REFUSED TO TURN 
OVER CONGRESS. KEY DOCUMENTS 

10:22:42.324 --> 10:22:47.396
THAT GO TO THE HEART OF THE WAYS
IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT DUE TO 

10:22:48.147 --> 10:22:52.475
HIS POWER. THE SUBPOENA, THOSE 
DOCUMENTS. DOD DOCUMENTS WOULD 

10:22:53.239 --> 10:22:59.763
PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO CRITICAL 
ASPECTS OF THIS AND SHOWED THE 

10:22:59.909 --> 10:23:03.444
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND 
MOTIVATION BEHIND PRESIDENTS 

10:23:03.645 --> 10:23:07.110
JUMPS FREEZE AND REVEAL THE 
CONCERN EXPRESSED BY DOD AND ON 

10:23:07.309 --> 10:23:12.178
THE OFFICIAL THAT WAS VIOLATING 
THE LAW. IT WOULD REVEAL OUR 

10:23:12.377 --> 10:23:16.041
OFFICIALS GRAVE CONCERNS, BUT 
THE IMPACT OF THE FREEZE ON 

10:23:16.806 --> 10:23:21.324
UKRAINE, AND U.S. NATIONAL 
SECURITY. IT WOULD SHOW THE 

10:23:22.085 --> 10:23:27.314
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIALLY 
RELEASED THE A.

10:23:31.075 --> 10:23:33.870
IT WOULD ESTABLISH HIS GAME THE 
USER DEFENSE FUNDS TO BENEFIT 

10:23:34.078 --> 10:23:40.013
HIS PERSONAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
WE ARTS BY COLLATING ABOUT THE 

10:23:40.210 --> 10:23:42.995
EXISTENCE OF THESE DOCUMENTS. 
GUESSING ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT 

10:23:43.141 --> 10:23:45.141
SHOW

10:23:46.913 --> 10:23:48.542
DURING THE COURSE OF THE 
INVESTIGATION, THE HOUSE 

10:23:48.543 --> 10:23:50.724
WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE 
THE COMMITTEE. ADAPTIVE MULTIPLE

10:23:50.875 --> 10:23:55.192
DOCUMENTS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO 
THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THAT DOD

10:23:55.357 --> 10:24:01.075
CONTINUES TO WITHHOLD. WE KNOW 
THE DOCUMENTS EXIST THAT WE NOW 

10:24:01.223 --> 10:24:06.824
THAT THE ONLY REASON HE DOESN'T 
HAVE THEM, IS BECAUSE THE 

10:24:07.024 --> 10:24:09.024
PRESIDENT HIMSELF, DIRECTED THE 
PENTAGON NOT TO PRODUCE THEM HE 

10:24:09.064 --> 10:24:12.002
KNOWS WHAT THEY WOULD SHOW. TO 
DEMONSTRATE

10:24:15.960 --> 10:24:17.798
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
DOCUMENTS IN THE VALUE THEY 

10:24:17.799 --> 10:24:21.444
WOULD PROVIDE A MISTRIAL, I 
WOULD LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH 

10:24:21.647 --> 10:24:23.679
SOME OF WHAT WE KNOW IT EXISTS 
AND THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

10:24:24.441 --> 10:24:28.145
CONTINUES TO REFUSE TO TURN OVER
AND AGAIN, BASED ON WHAT IS 

10:24:28.346 --> 10:24:35.865
KNOWN FROM THE TESTIMONY IN THE 
DOCUMENTS, IT IS CLEAR THE 

10:24:36.071 --> 10:24:38.865
PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO HIDE THIS
EVIDENCE, BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF

10:24:39.008 --> 10:24:45.215
WHAT IT WOULD SHOW THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT DOD HAS 

10:24:45.617 --> 10:24:48.807
DARTMOUTH THAT REVEALED THAT AS 
EARLY JUNE, THE PRESIDENT WAS 

10:24:48.960 --> 10:24:52.929
HOLDING WITHHOLDING MILITARY AID
TO THE UKRAINE AND AS I 

10:24:53.545 --> 10:24:58.414
MENTIONED EARLIER, THE PRESIDENT
BEGAN QUESTIONING MILITARY AID 

10:24:58.816 --> 10:25:04.302
JUNE OF LAST YEAR. THIS CAME 
DAYS AFTER DOD ISSUED A PRESS 

10:25:04.502 --> 10:25:09.585
RELEASE ON JUNE 18th, ANNOUNCING
IT WOULD PROVIDE 250 MILLION 

10:25:09.990 --> 10:25:15.921
PORTION OF THE AIDE TO UKRAINE. 
ACCORDING TO PUBLIC REPORTING, 

10:25:16.646 --> 10:25:18.646
UNDER THIS

10:25:20.551 --> 10:25:22.678
SECTOR OF DEFENSE ELAINE 
McCARTHY MANAGES THE DOD BUDGET,

10:25:23.401 --> 10:25:27.255
SHE LEARNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 
QUESTION. WE KNOW, THE EMAIL 

10:25:28.011 --> 10:25:32.891
DOES EXIST. IN RESPONSE TO THE 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWSUIT 

10:25:33.149 --> 10:25:39.651
THEY WERE FORCED TO RELEASE A 
REDACTED EMAIL. THE DOD RELATED 

10:25:40.053 --> 10:25:42.053
THAT OF THOSE DOCUMENTS TO THE 
HOUSE. DEPUTY

10:25:46.150 --> 10:25:48.750
LAURA COOPER AND HER TEAM WERE 
TASKED BY THE SECRETARY OF 

10:25:48.900 --> 10:25:50.981
DEFENSE RESPONDED TO THE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE UKRAINE 

10:25:51.183 --> 10:25:54.883
ASSISTANCE. MS. COOPER 
TESTIFIED, SHE PUT THE CANCER IS

10:25:55.654 --> 10:25:59.288
IN AND EMAIL AND DESCRIBE THOSE 
EMAILS DURING HER DEPOSITION. 

10:25:59.430 --> 10:26:01.430
SHE TESTIFIED DOD

10:26:04.635 --> 10:26:07.683
ASSISTANCE WAS CRUCIAL FOR 
UKRAINE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 

10:26:07.885 --> 10:26:12.968
AND HAD STRONG BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT IN CONGRESS. THAT DOD 

10:26:13.169 --> 10:26:19.668
PROVIDED NO DOCUMENTS. WITH THIS
PROPOSED MINUTES THE SENATE HAS 

10:26:20.427 --> 10:26:24.337
AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETAIN THE 
FULL RECORD THAT CAN FURTHER 

10:26:24.493 --> 10:26:26.493
DEMONSTRATE HOW AND WHY

10:26:30.835 --> 10:26:32.669
THE PRESIDENT WAS WITHHOLDING 
THE AIDE. LAURA COOPER, ALSO 

10:26:32.670 --> 10:26:34.838
TESTIFIED ABOUT THE INTERAGENCY 
MEETING THAT OCCURRED IN LATE 

10:26:34.984 --> 10:26:38.714
2019. THE MEETINGS AT WHICH DOD 
WAS SHOCKED, TO LEARN, PRESIDENT

10:26:38.861 --> 10:26:44.851
TRUMP PLACED A MYSTERIOUS HOLD 
ON THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE. WE 

10:26:45.051 --> 10:26:47.445
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT SEVERAL OF
THOSE MEETINGS, BECAUSE MS. 

10:26:47.594 --> 10:26:54.000
COOPER DISSIPATED IN IT. IN SOME
CASES WITH OTHER SENIOR DEFENSE 

10:26:54.201 --> 10:26:57.852
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS. HOWEVER, 
WE DON'T HAVE LAURA COOPER'S 

10:26:58.053 --> 10:27:03.536
NOTES FROM THOSE MEETINGS. WE 
DON'T HAVE EMAIL SHE SENT TO 

10:27:03.736 --> 10:27:09.635
SENIOR DOD VERSUS REPORTING NEWS
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. WE DON'T 

10:27:09.835 --> 10:27:14.302
HAVE EMAILS THAT SHOW THE 
RESPONSE FROM OTHER SENIOR 

10:27:14.723 --> 10:27:17.190
DEFENSE OFFICIAL PICK A DOD HAS 
REFUSED TO PROVIDE THEM. 

10:27:17.908 --> 10:27:24.869
SEPARATELY. SHE TESTIFIED ABOUT 
ONE THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE 

10:27:25.070 --> 10:27:33.200
SECRET HEALTH ON THE MILITARY. 
THE SAME DAY AS THE JULY 25th 

10:27:33.410 --> 10:27:39.083
CALL TO ZELENSKY, DOD OFFICIALS,
RECEIVED TWO EMAILS FROM THE 

10:27:39.284 --> 10:27:42.022
STATE DEPARTMENT INDICATING, 
THAT OFFICIALS FROM THE EMBASSY,

10:27:45.791 --> 10:27:48.378
THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE HOLD 
AND WERE STARTING TO ASK 

10:27:48.517 --> 10:27:50.517
QUESTIONS. SHE TESTIFIED SHE WAS
INFORMED QUOTE

10:27:54.521 --> 10:27:56.521
YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT AID"

10:29:58.485 --> 10:30:02.057
&gt;&gt;&gt; EARLIER I MENTIONED BY LATE 
JULY, OFFICIALS IN OUR EVER MET 

10:30:02.301 --> 10:30:06.994
RAISED SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF PRESIDENT 

10:30:07.253 --> 10:30:11.107
TRUMP'S HOLD ON MILITARY EIGHT. 
WE KNOW THIS FROM WITNESS 

10:30:11.360 --> 10:30:16.246
TESTIMONY AND DOCUMENTS PRODUCED
WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE ACT 

10:30:16.487 --> 10:30:18.487
DOCUMENTS. 

10:30:20.278 --> 10:30:22.278
FOR EXAMPLE, AT AN 

10:30:25.239 --> 10:30:27.673
INTERAGENCY MEETING., AUGUST 9, 
TO SAY THAT IT COULD NO LONGER 

10:30:27.914 --> 10:30:29.914
CLAIM 

10:30:30.937 --> 10:30:34.953
THE DELAY I ONLY KNOW THIS 
THROUGH RECENT REPORTING DUE TO 

10:30:35.202 --> 10:30:37.717
THE CONTENTS OF THE EMAIL. 
PRESIDENT 

10:30:40.814 --> 10:30:44.635
TRUMP CERTAINLY HASN'T MADE THIS
INFORMATION PUBLIC. IN RESPONSE 

10:30:44.871 --> 10:30:50.107
TO THE FREEDOM AT REQUEST THEY 
RELEASE THIS AUGUST 9 EMAIL 

10:30:54.925 --> 10:30:58.872
FROM THE CHIEF BUDGET OFFICER. 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SLIDE IN

10:30:59.108 --> 10:31:03.531
FRONT OF YOU IT IS ALMOST 
ENTIRELY BLACKED OUT. ACCORDING 

10:31:03.782 --> 10:31:06.115
TO PUBLIC REPORTING THE EMAIL 
SAID, 

10:31:09.455 --> 10:31:12.624
AS WE DISCUSSED AS OF AUGUST 12 
WE DO NOT THINK THAT WE COULD 

10:31:12.868 --> 10:31:18.940
AGREE THAT IT WILL NOT HAVE 
TIMELY EXECUTION AND WE HOPE 

10:31:19.179 --> 10:31:21.179
THAT WE CAN DO ALL THAT WE CAN 
EXECUTE 

10:31:24.516 --> 10:31:28.108
ONCE THE POLICY DECISION IS 
MADE. I CAN NO LONGER MAKE THE 

10:31:28.479 --> 10:31:30.479
DECLARATIVE STATEMENT. LET ME 
INTERPRET WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING

10:31:32.697 --> 10:31:35.364
SAID HERE. WHAT IS ACTUALLY 
BEING SAID IS WE ARE IN IN 

10:31:35.603 --> 10:31:40.673
TROUBLE. WE CANNOT SPEND THE 
MONEY AND THE TIME THAT WE HAVE 

10:31:41.044 --> 10:31:43.719
LEFT AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO 
COVER YOUR TRACKS ANYMORE AND 

10:31:43.955 --> 10:31:48.899
SAY THAT WE CAN. THE EXPENSE OF 
REDACTION'S WITH THE FREEDOM OF 

10:31:49.145 --> 10:31:52.657
INFORMATION ACT HIGHLIGHTS THE 
MINISTRATIONS OF FIRST TO 

10:31:52.908 --> 10:31:56.357
CONCEAL THE PRESIDENTS 
WRONGDOING. AND THEY WHY THE 

10:31:56.613 --> 10:31:58.613
SENATE MUST SUBPOENA 

10:32:02.463 --> 10:32:05.020
THE DOCUMENTS, THE  DOD 
DOCUMENTS TO SEE WHY THEY ALL 

10:32:05.262 --> 10:32:07.953
COME TO LIGHT.  YES, THERE IS 
MORE. BASED ON THE CONCERNS 

10:32:08.807 --> 10:32:12.063
EXPRESSED BY OTHERS AT  DOD  

10:32:15.152 --> 10:32:17.720
OMB  DROP FROM THE DOCUMENTS 
THAT THE STATEMENTS WOULD NOT 

10:32:19.800 --> 10:32:22.757
PRECLUDE ASKED EXECUTION WITH 
THE FUNDS. THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

10:32:27.061 --> 10:32:29.061
TALKING POINTS

10:32:31.915 --> 10:32:34.889
THAT NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY
OMB THAT WOULD PRECLUDE THE 

10:32:35.128 --> 10:32:37.953
OBLIGATION FOR THESE FUNDS BY 
THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, LET 

10:32:38.195 --> 10:32:40.870
ME ASK WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.  
EVERYBODY IS GETTING WORRIED. 

10:32:41.115 --> 10:32:43.309
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT SOMETHING 
BAD IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. NOBODY 

10:32:43.549 --> 10:32:46.895
HAS A GOOD EXPLANATION.

10:32:50.446 --> 10:32:53.156
AND NOBODY WANTS TO BE LEFT 
HOLDING THE BAG. SO THEY ARE 

10:32:53.398 --> 10:32:56.071
SENDING THE EMAILS THEY ARE 
SENDING THE MEMOS TO SAY I TOLD 

10:32:56.309 --> 10:33:02.782
YOU SO AND I WILL NOT BE HELD 
RESPONSIBLE.  DOD  TOOK ISSUE 

10:33:03.022 --> 10:33:07.786
WITH THE TALKING POINT AND SHE 
DID SO IN IN WRITING. SHE 

10:33:11.618 --> 10:33:16.280
EMAILED MR. DUFFY THAT THEY WERE
NOT ACCURATE AND THEY HAD BEEN 

10:33:16.517 --> 10:33:18.517
CONSISTENTLY 

10:33:20.349 --> 10:33:23.148
CONVEYING THAT NOTE FOR WEEKS. 
AGAIN, WE KNOW THIS FROM A PRESS

10:33:23.389 --> 10:33:26.877
REPORT NOT FROM DOCUMENTS 
PRODUCED BY CONGRESS FROM THE 

10:33:27.115 --> 10:33:29.496
TRUMP DEMONSTRATION. PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DID RELEASE OCCUPANCY 

10:33:29.740 --> 10:33:31.740
RESPONSE 

10:33:34.203 --> 10:33:38.286
TO LAWSUIT UNDER THE FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION ACT. THIS IS WHAT 

10:33:38.532 --> 10:33:40.963
HER EMAIL LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT 
WAS RELEASED BY THE TRUMP 

10:33:41.206 --> 10:33:44.313
DEMONSTRATION. HER CONCERNS THAT
THE  OMB TALKING POINT WAS, NOT 

10:33:44.957 --> 10:33:51.678
ACCURATE, WAS AGAIN ENTIRELY 
BLACKED OUT. WHAT ELSE IS BEING 

10:33:51.914 --> 10:33:59.089
HIDDEN FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
THE SENATE SHOULD ISSUE THE 

10:33:59.328 --> 10:34:04.349
SUBPOENA. THE  DOD DOCUMENTS 
WITH  SHED LIGHT ON THE  OMB 

10:34:04.607 --> 10:34:08.450
ACTIONS AS THE PRESIDENTS  TEAM 
UNRAVELED. ON SEPTEMBER 9, THEY 

10:34:09.015 --> 10:34:14.085
INFORMED DUFFY THAT THE  DOD 
COULD  FALL SHORT WITH SPENDING 

10:34:15.418 --> 10:34:19.249
.2 MILLION OR MORE WITH THE 
HOLD, SHE RESPONDED THAT IT 

10:34:19.489 --> 10:34:21.489
WOULD BE  DOD'S 

10:34:24.211 --> 10:34:28.927
FAULT . SHE RESPONDED, YOU 
CANNOT BE SERIOUS, I 

10:34:33.207 --> 10:34:37.227
AM SPEECHLESS. IT WILL COME AS 
NO SURPRISE THEN THAT THE 

10:34:37.601 --> 10:34:39.601
ADMINISTRATION REJECTED THIS 
EMAIL TOO 

10:34:42.549 --> 10:34:44.549
WHEN THEY

10:34:46.517 --> 10:34:48.581
PRODUCED THE DOCUMENT THE 
CONNECTION WITH THE FREEDOM OF 

10:34:48.821 --> 10:34:51.002
INFORMATION ACT LAWSUIT. THANKS 
TO PUBLIC REPORTING WE DO KNOW 

10:34:51.246 --> 10:34:53.680
ITS CONTENTS AND WHAT ELSE IS 
BEING HIDDEN FROM THE AMERICAN 

10:34:53.950 --> 10:34:56.372
PEOPLE? WHAT OTHER REACTIONS DID
THIS EXCHANGE SET OFF WITHIN  

10:34:57.700 --> 10:35:00.260
DOD ? WERE THOSE CONCERNS 
BROUGHT BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE?

10:35:00.501 --> 10:35:03.752
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
DOCUMENT WOULD SHED LIGHT ON 

10:35:03.990 --> 10:35:09.304
THESE DOCUMENTS. THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE DESERVE ANSWERS. MAKE NO 

10:35:13.336 --> 10:35:15.336
MISTAKE. THE RECORD BEFORE THE 
HOUSE FULLY SUPPORTS THE 

10:35:15.530 --> 10:35:18.333
CONCLUSION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
FROZE MILITARY HAD TO PRESSURE 

10:35:18.568 --> 10:35:20.862
UKRAINE INTO HELPING THE 
PRESIDENTS 

10:35:24.835 --> 10:35:26.835
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. THE  DOD 
DOCUMENTS WOULD PROVIDE FURTHER 

10:35:29.857 --> 10:35:32.661
EVIDENCE  OF THIS SCHEME. THEY 
WOULD EXPOSE THE FULL EXTENT OF 

10:35:32.900 --> 10:35:35.314
THE TRUTH TO CONGRESS AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEY WOULD 

10:35:35.549 --> 10:35:39.383
FIRMLY REBUT ANY NOTION THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ACTING ON 

10:35:39.622 --> 10:35:43.267
CONCERNS OF CORRUPTION OR OTHER 
COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE 

10:35:43.508 --> 10:35:45.508
PRESIDENT KNOWS IT. IF THERE WAS

10:35:49.773 --> 10:35:52.850
ANY DOUBT, RECENT EVENTS SHOWED 
THAT  DOD HAS DR. BISSETT ARE 

10:35:53.093 --> 10:35:57.751
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THIS TRIAL.
LA SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER, BEFORE I

10:35:57.990 --> 10:36:03.796
WAS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, I WAS 
A SOLDIER IN IRAQ AND 

10:36:04.033 --> 10:36:06.901
AFGHANISTAN I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE THE 

10:36:07.141 --> 10:36:10.567
EQUIPMENT YOU NEED. THE MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT

10:36:10.805 --> 10:36:15.535
OF DEFENSE AND ADMINISTER THIS 
VITAL AID UNDERSTAND THIS 

10:36:15.781 --> 10:36:20.828
REALITY TOO. THAT IS WHY THEY 
REPEATEDLY MADE THE CASE WITH 

10:36:21.077 --> 10:36:23.077
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE 
UKRAINE IS IMPORTANT AND IT 

10:36:23.272 --> 10:36:26.164
WOULD NOT ONLY HELP UKRAINE TO 
BOLSTER OUR TURNS AGAINST 

10:36:26.415 --> 10:36:31.444
FURTHER RUSSIAN AGGRESSION IN 
EURO. EVERY TIME WE HAVE THESE 

10:36:31.684 --> 10:36:36.031
DISCUSSIONS, THEY MAY SEEM 
ABSTRACT TO PEOPLE AROUND THE 

10:36:36.420 --> 10:36:40.875
COUNTRY. I DO THINK ABOUT THOSE 
60,000 U.S. TROOPS THAT WE HAVE 

10:36:44.999 --> 10:36:48.215
IN EUROPE. MANY OF WHOM, BY THE 
WAY, ARE STATIONED THERE WITH 

10:36:48.471 --> 10:36:52.648
THEIR FAMILIES. THE SPOUSES, 
CHILDREN AND HOW THEIR TRAINING 

10:36:52.897 --> 10:36:58.991
AND WORKING EVERY DAY. THEY WANT
TO HOLD THE LINE AND FIGHT FOR 

10:36:59.231 --> 10:37:01.809
FREEDOM AND LIBERTY IN EUROPE. 
IF THE 

10:37:04.852 --> 10:37:07.284
WAR IN UKRAINE SPILLS OVER 
OUTSIDE OF UKRAINE IT IS THOSE 

10:37:07.521 --> 10:37:13.456
MEN AND WOMEN THAT WILL HAVE TO 
GET INTO THEIR TANKS, IN THE 

10:37:13.701 --> 10:37:15.701
HELICOPTERS, AND DO 

10:37:17.227 --> 10:37:21.447
THEIR JOB. UNITED STATES SENATE 
CANNOT LET THIS INFORMATION 

10:37:24.260 --> 10:37:26.437
REMAIN HIDDEN. IT GOES DIRECTLY 
TO ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

10:37:26.677 --> 10:37:32.670
ABUSES OF POWER, AGAIN, 
WITHHOLDING AID AND 87 IN THIS 

10:37:32.908 --> 10:37:34.908
ROOM HAVE 

10:37:37.301 --> 10:37:39.780
VOTED FOR. THE PRESIDENT, THE 
SENATE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

10:37:40.029 --> 10:37:42.862
DESERVE A FAIR TRIAL, LET'S SEE 
THE DOCUMENTS AND LET'S SEE THEM

10:37:43.109 --> 10:37:47.862
NOW. AND LET THE FACTS SPEAK FOR
THEMSELVES. I WOULD LIKE TO END 

10:37:48.114 --> 10:37:50.114
BY READING A 

10:37:53.828 --> 10:37:56.281
SHORT TRANSCRIPT, SOMETHING THAT
I WAS THINKING ABOUT EARLIER 

10:37:57.858 --> 10:38:01.726
THIS EVENING. THIS IS A 
TRANSCRIPT FROM AMBASSADOR 

10:38:04.073 --> 10:38:06.901
TAYLOR'S TESTIMONY. I WANT TO 
TAKE A MINUTE TO READ IT FOR 

10:38:07.136 --> 10:38:12.431
YOU, TO YOU. HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT A TRIP THAT HE MADE TO 

10:38:12.687 --> 10:38:14.687
VISIT OUR FRIENDS 

10:38:16.823 --> 10:38:20.965
IN UKRAINE. WE HAD A MEETING 
WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER, IT 

10:38:21.210 --> 10:38:25.149
WAS THE FIRST MEETING OF THE 
DAY. WE WENT 

10:38:28.443 --> 10:38:31.486
OVER THERE. THEY INVITED US TO A
CEREMONY THAT THEY HAVE IN FRONT

10:38:31.737 --> 10:38:33.737
OF THEIR MINISTRY 

10:38:35.273 --> 10:38:40.114
EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY THEY HAVE 
THIS CEREMONY. IT IS ABOUT A 

10:38:41.692 --> 10:38:44.293
HALF HOUR CEREMONY WHERE THE 
SOLDIERS ARE IN 

10:38:49.279 --> 10:38:52.580
IN FORMATION, THE DEFENSE 
ADMINISTRATOR AND FAMILIES OF 

10:38:52.823 --> 10:38:55.310
SOLDIERS THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED 
ARE ALL THERE. AND THE SELECTION

10:38:55.553 --> 10:38:57.778
OF WHICH SOLDIERS ARE HONORED, 
SOLDIERS THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED 

10:38:58.019 --> 10:39:03.389
ARE HONORED, IS ON THE DATE OF 
ITS. WHATEVER TODAY'S DATE IS, 

10:39:07.859 --> 10:39:12.083
YOU KNOW IF WE WERE THERE, TODAY
ON 22 OCTOBER, THE FAMILIES OF 

10:39:12.323 --> 10:39:15.358
THOSE SOLDIERS THAT WERE KILLED 
ON ANY OCTOBER 22 OF THE 

10:39:15.601 --> 10:39:17.601
PREVIOUS YEARS WOULD 

10:39:19.297 --> 10:39:21.297
BE THERE.

10:39:23.013 --> 10:39:25.835
AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WAS TALKING 
ABOUT OUR FRIENDS. 

10:39:30.660 --> 10:39:35.558
AT LEAST 13,000 OF THEM HAVE 
GIVEN THEIR LIVES IN THE LAST 

10:39:35.800 --> 10:39:38.237
FIVE YEARS WITH THE FIGHT FOR 
LIBERTY IN EUROPE. THIS, LADIES 

10:39:38.478 --> 10:39:44.825
AND GENTLEMEN, IS A NATIONAL 
DISGRACE. AND ONLY THE PEOPLE IN

10:39:46.254 --> 10:39:48.254
THIS ROOM CAN 

10:39:49.835 --> 10:39:51.901
FIX IT. IT IS TIME TO ISSUE 

10:39:55.427 --> 10:39:59.602
THE SUBPOENAS. MR. CHIEF JUSTICE
WE RESERVE THE BALANCE OF OUR 

10:40:00.526 --> 10:40:02.526
TIME TO RESPOND TO THE 

10:40:05.779 --> 10:40:07.872
PRESIDENTS ARGUMENT.? MR. 
SUBLIMITY MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, 

10:40:08.117 --> 10:40:10.117
THANK YOU. 

10:40:13.778 --> 10:40:19.111
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, MEMBERS OF 
THE SENATE, I WILL BE BRIEF, 

10:40:19.359 --> 10:40:21.359
THIS MAY SEEM 

10:40:24.123 --> 10:40:26.123
LIKE SOME

10:40:28.663 --> 10:40:31.353
DÃ‰JÃ€ VU ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE 
WE HAVE BEEN ARGUING ABOUT THE 

10:40:31.596 --> 10:40:34.502
SAME ISSUES, REALLY, OVER, OVER,
AND OVER AGAIN, FOR A LONG TIME.

10:40:34.743 --> 10:40:37.429
I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
AMERICANS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY

10:40:37.672 --> 10:40:39.763
DO NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT 
WASHINGTON, IS HOW THE HOUSE 

10:40:40.004 --> 10:40:43.196
THEM ACROSS THE IT IS THE BEST 
USE OF THE TIME TO SPEND THIS 

10:40:43.438 --> 10:40:46.908
ENTIRE DAY DECIDING THE ISSUE OF
WHEN THIS BODY SHOULD DECIDE 

10:40:47.150 --> 10:40:49.150
ABOUT WHETHER 

10:40:51.085 --> 10:40:53.457
OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE WITNESSES
AND DOCUMENTS SUBPOENAED, THAT 

10:40:53.700 --> 10:40:55.873
IS THEY SHOULD BE FOR US NOW 
WHETHER THEY SHOULD 

10:41:00.048 --> 10:41:02.614
BE WITNESSES OR DOCUMENTS AS THE
MAJORITY MADE CLEAR THE 

10:41:02.857 --> 10:41:04.788
UNDERLYING RESOLUTION SIMPLY 
ALLOWS THAT ISSUE TO BE 

10:41:04.789 --> 10:41:08.148
ADDRESSED, A WEEK FROM NOW. THE 
ONLY QUESTION AT 

10:41:12.613 --> 10:41:16.907
ISSUE NOW, THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
KEEP SAYING, HOW COULD YOU HAVE 

10:41:17.151 --> 10:41:19.633
A TRIAL WITHOUT WITNESSES? HOW 
COULD YOU HAVE A TRIAL WITHOUT 

10:41:19.879 --> 10:41:22.950
DOCUMENTS? THAT IS NOT THE 
ISSUE, THE ISSUE IS WHETHER YOU 

10:41:23.328 --> 10:41:27.798
HAVE TO DECIDE THE ISSUE, TO 
SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS OR WITNESSES 

10:41:28.080 --> 10:41:30.811
NOW OR DECIDE IT IN WEEK AFTER 
HERE THE PRESENTATION. WHY ARE 

10:41:31.056 --> 10:41:35.879
THEY SO EAGER? WHY IS IT 
NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT DECISION 

10:41:36.122 --> 10:41:39.646
WITHOUT HAVING MORE INFORMATION?
IN THE CLINTON TRIAL, THIS BODY 

10:41:40.651 --> 10:41:42.651
AGREED 100 

10:41:46.845 --> 10:41:50.154
TO 0 THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO
HAVE MORE INFORMATION THAT IT 

10:41:50.397 --> 10:41:52.397
WAS RATIONAL TO HAVE MORE 
INFORMATION TO HEAR THE 

10:41:52.587 --> 10:41:55.163
PRESENTATION AND THEN DECIDE 
WHAT MORE WAS NECESSARY. WHY IS 

10:41:55.402 --> 10:41:57.402
IT 

10:41:59.659 --> 10:42:01.659
SO IMPORTANT

10:42:10.025 --> 10:42:12.578
THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE THAT 
DECISION NOW WITHOUT THAT 

10:42:12.817 --> 10:42:15.276
INFORMATION? THAT DOES NOT MAKE 
ANY SENSE. THE RATIONAL THING TO

10:42:15.517 --> 10:42:18.692
DO IS SAY HERE WHAT SORT OF CASE
THEY PRESENT AND A PORTLY TO 

10:42:18.933 --> 10:42:21.048
HEAR THE PRESIDENTS DEFENSE 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAD NO 

10:42:21.287 --> 10:42:23.476
OPPORTUNITY, IN THE HOUSE, TO 
PRESENT ANY DIFFERENT. WE HEARD 

10:42:23.727 --> 10:42:26.422
A LOT ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND 
PRESIDENT WHAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED

10:42:26.683 --> 10:42:29.595
WAS THE PROCESS THAT WAS USED IN
THE HOUSE. A PROCESS THAT BEGAN 

10:42:29.838 --> 10:42:33.129
WITHIN AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
WITHOUT A VOTE FROM THE HOUSE, 

10:42:33.392 --> 10:42:37.366
THIS WAS A POINT THAT I MADE 
EARLIER. IT IS NOT TO ANY SINGLE

10:42:37.607 --> 10:42:42.050
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT SPEAKER POLICY 

10:42:42.291 --> 10:42:46.367
HELD ON SEPTEMBER 24 DID NOT 
VALIDATE OR DID IT VALIDATE AND 

10:42:48.859 --> 10:42:53.068
GIVE POWER TO ISSUE TO ISSUE A 
SUBPOENA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

10:42:53.481 --> 10:42:56.760
THE  DOD DOCUMENTS WHAT EFFORTS 
DID THEY MAKE TO  GET THESE DOG 

10:42:57.003 --> 10:42:59.003
MEDS THAT YOU WOULD 

10:43:01.482 --> 10:43:03.482
DO THIS UNAUTHORIZED UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION, IT 

10:43:06.860 --> 10:43:11.189
WAS UNPRECEDENTED BECAUSE IT WAS
WITH AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 

10:43:11.430 --> 10:43:13.852
REPORTEDLY WITHOUT ANY VOTE FROM
THE HOUSE AND IT NEVER HAPPENED 

10:43:14.092 --> 10:43:16.573
BEFORE IN A OUR HISTORY WITH THE
PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT. IT WAS

10:43:16.817 --> 10:43:19.799
UNLAWFUL, IT WAS UNAUTHORIZED, 
AND THAT IS WHY NO DOCUMENTS 

10:43:20.045 --> 10:43:22.045
WERE PRODUCED. 

10:43:24.394 --> 10:43:29.907
THEY MADE NO OTHER EFFORTS TO 
PURSUE THAT. SO, WE HAVE HEARD 

10:43:30.148 --> 10:43:33.089
ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IT APPLIES
TO HOUSE DEMOCRATS AS WELL AND 

10:43:33.877 --> 10:43:36.792
THEY DIDN'T ABIDE BY IT. IT WAS 
UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE A PROCESS 

10:43:37.029 --> 10:43:39.385
IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAD NO 
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HIS 

10:43:42.346 --> 10:43:44.346
DEFENSE, NO

10:43:48.541 --> 10:43:50.541
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT WITNESSES
AND NO OPPORTUNITY TO BE 

10:43:50.759 --> 10:43:52.759
REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND NO 
EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER, IN THREE 

10:43:52.965 --> 10:43:55.166
ROUNDS OF HEARING. THEY WILL 
MENTION IT IN THE JUDICIARY 

10:43:55.405 --> 10:43:59.884
COMMITTEE THAT THEY GIVE HIM 
RIGHT BUT WITH THAT HEARING THE 

10:44:00.126 --> 10:44:02.126
SPEAKER ANNOUNCED THE CONCLUSION
THAT ARTICLES WOULD BE DRAFTED 

10:44:02.328 --> 10:44:06.043
AND THE COMMITTEE HAD DECIDED 
THEY WOULD HEAR NO FACT 

10:44:06.288 --> 10:44:10.096
WITNESSES. THERE WERE NO RIGHT 
FOR THE PRESIDENT SO IT MAKES 

10:44:10.346 --> 10:44:12.637
SENSE, WHAT IS RATIONAL, WHAT 

10:44:17.642 --> 10:44:22.174
100 SENATORS 21 YEARS AGO 
THOUGHT WAS RATIONAL TO HEAR A 

10:44:22.411 --> 10:44:25.069
CASE THAT COULD BE PRESENTED ON 
THE RECORD ESTABLISH A FAR AND 

10:44:25.310 --> 10:44:27.737
THEN DECIDE IF SOMETHING ELSE 
NEEDS TO BE DONE. LET THE 

10:44:27.979 --> 10:44:30.869
PRESIDENT MAKE HIS CASE. WE ARE 
READY TO GET THIS STARTED. THE 

10:44:31.112 --> 10:44:33.853
HOUSE MANAGER SHOULD BE AS WELL.
THANK YOU, MR. 

10:44:38.141 --> 10:44:42.283
CHIEF JUSTICE.? THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE 38 

10:44:43.619 --> 10:44:45.619
MINUTES REMAINING. 

10:44:50.086 --> 10:44:52.086
? MR. CHIEF JUSTICE I WILL 

10:44:55.407 --> 10:44:58.228
BE BRIEF. COUNSEL FOR THE 
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO SAY A LOT

10:44:58.471 --> 10:45:00.471
OF THINGS THAT RUBBED ME THE 

10:45:04.515 --> 10:45:06.515
WRONG WAY.

10:45:09.679 --> 10:45:12.087
HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, WE ARE 
TALKING AND SAYING THE SAME 

10:45:12.331 --> 10:45:17.222
ARGUMENT OVER, OVER, AND OVER 
AGAIN. WELL I AM READY TO KEEP 

10:45:17.462 --> 10:45:20.151
GOING. BECAUSE THIS IS AN 
IMPORTANT DEBATE, WE NEED TO 

10:45:20.393 --> 10:45:22.393
HAVE 

10:45:24.255 --> 10:45:26.669
IT NOW. HE ALSO SAID, SOMETHING 
ABOUT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

10:45:26.913 --> 10:45:29.025
DO NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT 
WASHINGTON, I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE 

10:45:31.477 --> 10:45:34.770
VERY LONG, I CAN TELL YOU THAT I
DO NOT THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

10:45:35.008 --> 10:45:39.757
CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT WHETHER OR 
NOT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON ARE 

10:45:41.838 --> 10:45:48.725
SITTING AROUND DEBATING ALL THE 
TIME, AND THINKING ABOUT, YOU 

10:45:48.963 --> 10:45:52.537
KNOW, WHAT YOU ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT RIGHT NOW. BUT THEY ARE 

10:45:52.790 --> 10:45:54.790
CONCERNED ABOUT, WHETHER 

10:45:56.891 --> 10:46:00.844
OR NOT WHETHER THEIR GOVERNMENT 
IS WORKING FOR THEM. WHETHER OR 

10:46:01.087 --> 10:46:04.701
NOT THERE IS CORRUPTION IN THE 
GOVERNMENT. THAT IS WHAT THEY 

10:46:04.943 --> 10:46:08.907
UNDERSTAND. AND THAT IS WHAT 
THIS DEBATE IS ALL ABOUT. 

10:46:09.160 --> 10:46:11.160
COUNSEL FOR THE 

10:46:13.921 --> 10:46:18.992
PRESIDENT SAID, BY NOW, BY THE 
INFORMATION NOW. THE BETTER 

10:46:19.237 --> 10:46:24.519
QUESTION IS, WHY NOT NOW? THIS 
TRIAL HAS STARTED. LET'S HAVE 

10:46:24.764 --> 10:46:31.566
THE FACTS AND THE INFORMATION 
NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE 

10:46:31.804 --> 10:46:39.241
TIME IS RIGHT THERE IS NO REASON
WHY WE SHOULDN'T ISSUE THOSE 

10:46:39.483 --> 10:46:44.902
SUBPOENAS, GET THE FACTS, GET 
THE TESTIMONY, HAVE THE DEBATE, 

10:46:45.281 --> 10:46:51.165
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE WHAT
IS REALLY GOING ON HERE. MR. 

10:46:51.405 --> 10:46:57.030
CHIEF JUSTICE I WILL YIELD THE 
BALANCE OF MY TIME TO MR. CHEF. 

10:46:57.273 --> 10:46:59.273
-- ADAM SCHIFF. 

10:47:04.507 --> 10:47:07.793
&gt;&gt; SENATORS, I WILL BE BRIEF, I 
WANT TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF 

10:47:08.035 --> 10:47:10.232
THE POINTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES 
HAVE MADE. FIRST, AT THE 

10:47:14.229 --> 10:47:16.229
ARGUMENT THAT

10:47:27.127 --> 10:47:30.077
YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE, AND I'VE 
NO DOUBT YOU WILL HEAR IT AGAIN.

10:47:30.322 --> 10:47:33.288
THAT THIS IF YOU IS ISSUED BY 
THE HOUSE AND THEY ARE INVALID. 

10:47:33.530 --> 10:47:35.704
WELL, THAT IS REALLY WONDERFUL, 
IMAGINE WHEN YOU ISSUE SUBPOENAS

10:47:35.946 --> 10:47:38.334
THEY WOULD DECLARE, YOURS 
INVALID AS WELL. WHAT IS THE 

10:47:38.584 --> 10:47:41.233
BASIS OF THE CLAIM BEING INVALID
THEY WERE NOT ISSUED THE WAY 

10:47:41.472 --> 10:47:44.155
THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS. PART 
OF THE ARGUMENT IS YOU HAVE TO 

10:47:44.398 --> 10:47:48.015
ISSUE A SUBPOENA THE WAY THAT WE
SAY AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE 

10:47:48.254 --> 10:47:50.921
AFTER THERE IS A RESOLUTION THAT
WE APPROVE OF ADOPTED BY THE 

10:47:51.161 --> 10:47:53.822
FULL HOUSE. FOR SAKE OF PLAY 
THAT THERE WAS NO RESOLUTION, NO

10:47:54.071 --> 10:47:56.071
FORMAL RESOLUTION OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THE WHEN WE 

10:47:56.312 --> 10:47:58.423
PASSED THE FORMER RESOLUTION 
THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT. THEY

10:47:58.665 --> 10:48:01.332
COMPLAINED WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE 
ONE AND THEN WHEN WE DID HAVE 

10:48:01.572 --> 10:48:03.780
ONE. THEY HAVE MADE THAT 
ARGUMENT ALREADY IN COURT AND 

10:48:04.021 --> 10:48:06.021
THEY LOST. SIMILARLY, THE 
SUBPOENA, IS INVALID. AND YOU 

10:48:06.218 --> 10:48:09.750
KNOW WHAT THE JUST SAID? THE 
SPEC THE 

10:48:13.470 --> 10:48:15.657
JUDGE SAID, IT IS NONESSENTIAL. 
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T GET TO 

10:48:15.895 --> 10:48:19.435
DECIDE HOW THE HOUSE CONDUCTS AN
IMPEACHMENT HEARING. THE 

10:48:19.809 --> 10:48:23.547
PRESIDENT DOESN'T GET TO DECIDE 
WHETHER THE SUBPOENA ISSUED IS 

10:48:23.786 --> 10:48:25.786
VALID OR INVALID? 

10:48:28.720 --> 10:48:32.479
THE HOUSE GETS TO DECIDE BECAUSE
THE HOUSES GIVEN THE SOLE POWER 

10:48:32.736 --> 10:48:34.914
OF IMPEACHMENT AND THAT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

10:48:35.166 --> 10:48:38.080
COUNSEL SAYS WHY ARE WE GOING 
THROUGH ALL THESE DOCUMENTS? 

10:48:38.322 --> 10:48:40.322
AREN'T 

10:48:42.302 --> 10:48:45.623
THESE MOTIONS THE SAME. THE FACT
OF THE MATTER IS, WE ARE NOT 

10:48:45.865 --> 10:48:48.040
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME DOCUMENTS
HERE. THEY WOULD LIKE NOTHING 

10:48:48.281 --> 10:48:50.757
BETTER THAN FOR YOU TO KNOW 
NOTHING ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS THAT

10:48:51.466 --> 10:48:53.466
WE SEEK. THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO

10:48:57.043 --> 10:48:59.043
KNOW WHAT

10:49:03.346 --> 10:49:05.051
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT DECOROUS 
ERROR WITHHOLDING. OF COURSE, 

10:49:05.052 --> 10:49:08.195
THEY DO NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT. 
THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW 

10:49:08.486 --> 10:49:10.685
WHAT STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE 
BECAUSE IF IT IS JUST ABSTRACT, 

10:49:10.926 --> 10:49:13.491
FOR YOU ARE JUST ARGUING FOR 
DOCUMENTS, WILL THEY COULD SAY, 

10:49:13.732 --> 10:49:16.404
BUT THAT IS -- THAT IS NOT 
REALLY IMPORTANT, RIGHT? IS THIS

10:49:16.646 --> 10:49:21.183
JUST SOME GENERIC THING. BUT 
WHAT YOU LEARN AS YOU HAVE 

10:49:21.426 --> 10:49:23.715
LEARNED TODAY AND TONIGHT WHAT 
THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE, WHEN YOU 

10:49:23.960 --> 10:49:27.566
SEE THE EFFORTS TO CONCEAL THOSE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 

10:49:27.806 --> 10:49:30.436
EMAILS THAT MR. CROW, MY 
COLLEAGUE, TALKED ABOUT, AND 

10:49:33.545 --> 10:49:36.383
IT IS REDACTED AND WE FIND OUT 
WHAT IS UNDER THOSE REDUCTIONS, 

10:49:36.623 --> 10:49:40.475
SURPRISE IT IS INCRIMINATING 
PERMISSION THEY HAVE REDACTED 

10:49:40.713 --> 10:49:45.574
OUT, THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE 
THE BASIS OF

10:49:49.359 --> 10:49:51.785
REDACTION AND THE FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION ACT IT IS CALLED, A 

10:49:52.030 --> 10:49:54.953
COVER-UP. THEY DO NOT WANT YOU 
TO SEE THAT TODAY. THEY DO NOT 

10:49:55.194 --> 10:49:58.016
WANT YOU TO SEE THE BEFORE AND 
AFTER THE REDACTED AND THE 

10:49:58.253 --> 10:50:00.425
NON-REDACTED, THEY WANT YOU TO 
HEAR FROM THESE WITNESSES ABOUT 

10:50:00.662 --> 10:50:02.871
THE DETAILED PERSONAL KNOW SO 
THEY TOOK, MASTER TAYLOR TOOK 

10:50:03.114 --> 10:50:06.289
DETAILED NOTES. THEY WANT TO TRY
TO CONTEST, WHAT THE 

10:50:10.667 --> 10:50:12.371
AMBASSADOR SAID ABOUT HIS 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

10:50:12.372 --> 10:50:16.174
PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE, AFTER HE 
TALKED WITH THE PRESIDENT HE 

10:50:16.948 --> 10:50:18.948
TALKED DIRECTLY WITH AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR AND TALKED 

10:50:22.453 --> 10:50:25.005
REGULAR WITH MR. MORRISON AND 
EXPLAIN THE CONVERSATION WITH 

10:50:25.244 --> 10:50:28.065
THE PRESIDENT. WELL GUESS WHAT? 
MR. MORRISON, AND AMBASSADOR 

10:50:28.306 --> 10:50:30.306
TAYLOR 

10:50:31.707 --> 10:50:34.848
TOOK DETAILED NOTES. THERE IS A 
DISPUTE ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

10:50:35.088 --> 10:50:37.088
SAID 

10:50:39.924 --> 10:50:41.924
ABOUT HIM

10:50:44.583 --> 10:50:47.478
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE THE 
NOSE? THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO 

10:50:47.719 --> 10:50:51.023
SEE THAT THE NOTES OF THIS THEY 
DO NOT WANT TO HAVE THIS DEBATE.

10:50:51.261 --> 10:50:53.678
THEY SAY, THIS IS JUST ABOUT 
DOCUMENTS. IT IS JUST ABOUT 

10:50:53.915 --> 10:50:56.347
WENT, WE WANT THE SENATORS OUT 
THERE 16 HOURS AFTER QUESTIONS 

10:50:56.595 --> 10:51:00.680
BEFORE WE SEE ANY OF THE STUFF. 
THE WHEN, AS I SAID, EARLIER 

10:51:00.926 --> 10:51:02.926
MEANS 

10:51:04.052 --> 10:51:07.612
NEVER. FINALLY, THE CLINTON 
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT CLINTON 

10:51:11.901 --> 10:51:14.213
TURNED OVER 90,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE TRIAL. I 

10:51:14.452 --> 10:51:19.678
AGREE, LET'S FOLLOW THIS THIS 
WILL NOT TAKE 90,000 DOCUMENTS. 

10:51:19.919 --> 10:51:24.435

COLLECTED, YOU HEARD THE 

10:51:24.677 --> 10:51:26.677
TESTIMONY ON 

10:51:28.720 --> 10:51:34.015
THE SCREENED FROM AMBASSADOR 
TAYLOR, THEY WILL BE TURNED OVER

10:51:34.258 --> 10:51:36.424
SHORTLY. BUT WE ARE STILL 
WAITING. BUT THEY ARE STILL 

10:51:36.676 --> 10:51:38.861
SITTING THERE AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. WE EVEN PLAYED A 

10:51:39.102 --> 10:51:42.066
VIDEO FOR YOU, OF THE SECRETARY 
ON ONE OF THE SUNDAY SHOWS, THAT

10:51:42.307 --> 10:51:44.307
WE 

10:51:45.433 --> 10:51:47.987

WANT TO HEAR FROM THESE PEOPLE 
WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE 

10:52:16.626 --> 10:52:20.142

MANAGERS 

10:58:44.663 --> 10:58:46.663
CAN RECEIVE AND HAVE TIME FOR 
REBUTTAL. 

10:58:54.962 --> 10:58:57.512
&gt;&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, SENATORS, 
COUNSEL FOR THE PRESIDENT GOT MY

10:58:57.754 --> 10:59:03.272
NAME IS SYLVIA GARCIA, I AM A 
CONGRESSWOMAN FROM TEXAS IN THE 

10:59:03.518 --> 10:59:05.518
HOUSTON REGION. 

10:59:06.899 --> 10:59:09.928
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SITTING 
FOR SOME TIME AS WELL AS YOU. 

10:59:11.858 --> 10:59:15.653
AND, IT BROUGHT TO MIND THE MANY
YEARS THAT I HAVE SPENT AS A 

10:59:19.952 --> 10:59:24.041
JUDGE, JUSTICE,, JUST AS ALL OF 
YOU ARE JUDGES IN IN THIS 

10:59:24.285 --> 10:59:27.181
HEARING, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I 
SAY IF YOU WORDS BEFORE I START 

10:59:27.639 --> 10:59:34.072
OUR ARGUMENT FOR THIS AMENDMENT.
BECAUSE THE SCHEME OF THINGS, IT

10:59:34.311 --> 10:59:38.066
IS REALLY NOT THAT VERY 
COMPLICATED. THE AMERICAN 

10:59:38.304 --> 10:59:42.339
PEOPLE, EVERY DAY, AMERICANS 
KNOW WHAT A TRIAL 

10:59:46.267 --> 10:59:48.267
LOOKS LIKE.

10:59:52.847 --> 10:59:56.013
WHETHER THEY HAVE SEEN IT ON P 
REMAIN IN, OR LAW AND ORDER OR 

10:59:56.256 --> 10:59:58.835
MAYBE THEY HAVE BEEN IN COURT 
THEMSELVES. THEY KNOW WHAT A 

10:59:59.076 --> 11:00:01.570
TRIAL IS. IT IS ABOUT MAKING 
SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN 

11:00:01.837 --> 11:00:04.279
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, BOTH 
SIDES, IT IS ABOUT WITNESSES, IT

11:00:04.515 --> 11:00:09.789
IS ABOUT DOCUMENTS, IT IS ABOUT 
GETTING A FAIR SHOT. AND THAT IS

11:00:10.034 --> 11:00:12.940
ALL THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR 
TODAY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

11:00:13.200 --> 11:00:16.595
WE HAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE 
TRIAL THAT THEY EXPECT. TO MAKE 

11:00:16.838 --> 11:00:19.834
SURE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
KNOW THAT THIS RESIDENT NEEDS TO

11:00:20.222 --> 11:00:27.162
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE IF 
IT WERE THEY, WHO ARE ACCUSED OR

11:00:27.409 --> 11:00:31.260
ALLEGED TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING, 
THEY WOULD WANT THE SAME THING. 

11:00:31.506 --> 11:00:33.506
SO FOR ME, IT IS ABOUT 

11:00:36.340 --> 11:00:40.250
MAKING SURE THAT WE GET A FAIR 
TRIAL. WHICH IS WHY I AM HERE 

11:00:40.490 --> 11:00:42.490
REPRESENTING THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS 

11:00:43.669 --> 11:00:47.037
AMENDMENT TO SUBPOENA ROBERT 
BLAIR AND MICHAEL DUFFEY. PLAYER

11:00:47.290 --> 11:00:50.553
AND DUFFY ARE THE TWO OFFICIALS 
THAT CARRIED OUT PRESIDENT 

11:00:50.799 --> 11:00:59.987
TRUMP'S ORDER TO FREE, FREEZE 
FILED SUIT MILITARY AID. IT WAS 

11:01:00.225 --> 11:01:02.225
UNCOVERED IN 

11:01:04.771 --> 11:01:06.872
THE BASEMENT THIS MONEY THEIR 
TESTIMONY WILL FURTHER AFFIRM 

11:01:07.116 --> 11:01:11.782
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD NO 
LEGITIMATE POLICY REASON FOR THE

11:01:12.021 --> 11:01:14.969
ORDER. BLAIR WORKS IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE AS A SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE

11:01:15.357 --> 11:01:20.723
ACTING CHIEF OF STAFFWILL VEINY.
DUFFY IS UP  POLITICAL APPOINTEE

11:01:20.970 --> 11:01:22.970
HE WORKS IN THE 

11:01:25.799 --> 11:01:28.944
OFFICE OF OFFICE IMAGINED HE 
SERVES AS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR

11:01:29.193 --> 11:01:31.099
FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
PROGRAMS, BOTH WERE SUBPOENAED 

11:01:31.100 --> 11:01:34.776
BY THE HOUSE INVESTIGATIVE 
COMMITTEES. BOTH WERE ORDERED 

11:01:35.012 --> 11:01:40.070
NOT TO APPEAR SO BOTH FAILED TO 
APPEAR FOR THE SCHEDULED THE 

11:01:40.822 --> 11:01:46.022
POSITIONS. DESPITE REPEATED 
OUTREACH AND DESPITE THE LEGAL 

11:01:46.262 --> 11:01:52.980
DUTY TO COMPLY. BLAIR AND DUFFY 
ARE NOT HOUSEHOLD NAMES MANY 

11:01:53.229 --> 11:01:57.460
PEOPLE HAVE NOT HEARD OF THEM 
BUT THEY OPERATED THE MACHINERY 

11:01:57.702 --> 11:01:59.702
OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THEY 

11:02:02.488 --> 11:02:04.488
IMPLEMENTED PRESIDENT 

11:02:06.131 --> 11:02:08.455
TRUMPS INSTRUCTION TO FREE THE 
MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE THEY 

11:02:08.702 --> 11:02:11.470
COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE FREEZE 
WITH EACH OTHER WITH MULVANEY, 

11:02:15.302 --> 11:02:22.193
WITH THE  OMB DIRECTOR  AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THEY 

11:02:22.434 --> 11:02:24.434
STOOD AT THE CENTER OF THIS 

11:02:27.224 --> 11:02:29.224
TANGLED WEB.

11:02:30.891 --> 11:02:33.350
SOME OF THEIR COMMUNICATIONS ARE
KNOWN TO US FROM THE TESTIMONY 

11:02:33.589 --> 11:02:35.510
OF OTHER WITNESSES BEFORE HOUSE 
COMMITTEES. OTHER COMMUNICATIONS

11:02:35.511 --> 11:02:38.052
HAVE BEEN REVEALED THROUGH 
PUBLIC REPORTING AND THE FREEDOM

11:02:38.289 --> 11:02:44.049
OF INFORMATION ACT RELEASES. BUT
THESE COMMUNICATIONS ONLY PARTLY

11:02:44.291 --> 11:02:48.193
PENETRATE THE SECRECY IN WHICH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SOUGHT 

11:02:51.288 --> 11:02:55.121
TO CLOSE WITH HIS INSTRUCTIONS 
TO FREEZE MILITARY AID TO A 

11:02:56.250 --> 11:02:58.250
VULNERABLE 

11:02:59.704 --> 11:03:03.086
DEADERICK PARTNER -- STRATEGIC 
PARTNER. EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT 

11:03:03.331 --> 11:03:06.333
OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT WERE STUMPED, 

11:03:06.588 --> 11:03:08.588
LITERALLY STUMPED ABOUT WHY THE 
FREEZE 

11:03:11.133 --> 11:03:13.450
WAS HAPPENING. THEY REPORTED 
THAT WHEN THEY TRIED TO GET 

11:03:13.692 --> 11:03:15.692
EXPLANATIONS FROM 

11:03:17.478 --> 11:03:19.478
THE TWO, CONSISTENT WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORT TO HIDE

11:03:19.611 --> 11:03:23.811
ALL EVIDENCE, THEY HAVE DEFIED 
THE HOUSES SUBPOENAS AT THE 

11:03:27.022 --> 11:03:29.022
PRESIDENTS DIRECTION. TO EXPLAIN
WHY THIS AMENDMENT SHOULD BE 

11:03:29.163 --> 11:03:33.096
PASSED, I WOULD LIKE TO WALK YOU
THROUGH SOME KEY EVENTS WHICH 

11:03:33.353 --> 11:03:35.353
THE TWO 

11:03:38.052 --> 11:03:40.084
PARTICIPATED IN. 

11:03:43.726 --> 11:03:48.064
TO START, THE TWO WERE DIRECTLY 
INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL STAGES 

11:03:48.876 --> 11:03:50.876
OF 

11:03:53.889 --> 11:03:57.122
PRESIDENT TRUMPS FREEZE OF THE 
MILITARY AID BRIGADOON 18 THE 

11:03:57.372 --> 11:03:59.372
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ISSUED A 
STATEMENT THAT THEY WOULD 

11:03:59.561 --> 11:04:02.774
PROVIDE THE 250 MILLION PORTION 
TO THE ASSISTANCE OF UKRAINE AND

11:04:03.013 --> 11:04:07.466
THAT UKRAINE MET ALL THE 
CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING THE 

11:04:07.715 --> 11:04:09.715
MONEY. THE VERY NEXT DAY ON 

11:04:12.551 --> 11:04:17.921
JUNE 19, BLAIR  AND HIS 
ASSISTANT THE ACTIVE 

11:04:22.095 --> 11:04:24.719
DIRECTOR CALLED,  OMB TO TALK 
ABOUT THE MILITARY TO UKRAINE,  

11:04:24.968 --> 11:04:27.296
ACCORDING TO PUBLIC REPORTS 
BLAIR,  

11:04:31.077 --> 11:04:40.889
WE NEED TO HOLD IT UP. THAT SAME
DAY, DUFFEY  EMAILED THE DEPUTY 

11:04:42.712 --> 11:04:47.791
UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,  
McCUSKER  OF THE MILITARY AID 

11:04:48.033 --> 11:04:52.655
THEY FAILED TO PRODUCE THAT 
EMAIL TO THE HOUSE AND ALL OF 

11:04:53.263 --> 11:04:55.420
THEIR DOCUMENTS AND A COPY OF 
THAT EMAIL WAS RECENTLY 

11:04:58.729 --> 11:05:01.260
PRODUCED AND IT WAS IN RESPONSE 
TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 

11:05:01.495 --> 11:05:03.495
ACT LAWSUIT. IN 

11:05:04.985 --> 11:05:09.656
THE EMAIL DUFFEY INFORMED  DOD, 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED  ABOUT 

11:05:10.030 --> 11:05:12.030
THIS 

11:05:13.048 --> 11:05:17.753
FUNDING RELEASE. DUFFEY , A 
CAREER OFFICIAL WHO REPORTS TO 

11:05:19.077 --> 11:05:21.576
HIM AND TESTIFIED BEFORE THE 
HOUSE ABOUT 

11:05:25.046 --> 11:05:27.046
THIS EMAIL. 

11:05:28.310 --> 11:05:30.368
THEY PROVIDED THE REQUESTED 
INFORMATION TO HIM WHICH HE 

11:05:31.701 --> 11:05:34.246
SHARED WITH DUFFEY THESE 
COMMUNICATIONS  RAISE MANY 

11:05:34.904 --> 11:05:37.168
QUESTIONS ABOUT BLAIR  AND 
DUFFEY 

11:05:41.310 --> 11:05:44.129
AND  THEY ARE IN THE BEST 
POSITION TO PROVIDE ANSWERS. FOR

11:05:44.371 --> 11:05:50.348
EXAMPLE, WHO ARE WHAT PROMPTED 
BLAIR  TO TELL THEM THAT  OMB  

11:05:50.588 --> 11:05:52.588
NEEDED TO FREEZE THE 

11:05:55.506 --> 11:05:59.464
AID? WHO? WHAT REASON WAS BLAIR 
GIVEN  AND WHO INSTRUCTED DUFFEY

11:05:59.943 --> 11:06:06.291
TO REACH OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE? WHO TOLD HIM THAT 

11:06:06.540 --> 11:06:08.540
THE PRESIDENT 

11:06:10.574 --> 11:06:14.761
HAD QUESTIONS. AND WHAT WERE 
THOSE QUESTIONS? AND DID BLAIR 

11:06:14.997 --> 11:06:20.685
AND DUFFEY  HAVE TWO MEDICATIONS
ABOUT THE MILITARY AID TO 

11:06:22.695 --> 11:06:27.044
RETRAIN -- TO UKRAINE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, WHAT ABOUT THE 

11:06:28.850 --> 11:06:33.929
FUNDING RELEASE? AND UNDER 
PRESIDENTS SO-CALLED, QUESTIONS?

11:06:34.176 --> 11:06:36.176
DUFFEY AND BLAIR  COULD PROVIDE 

11:06:40.579 --> 11:06:42.882
THE ANSWERS. THEY COULD EXPLAIN 
WHAT DIRECTIONS THEY RECEIVED, 

11:06:43.121 --> 11:06:48.505
WHEN THEY WERE PROVIDED, AND WHO
PROVIDED THEM. THE AMERICAN 

11:06:48.749 --> 11:06:53.344
PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW THESE 
FACTS. THE NEXT 

11:06:57.172 --> 11:06:59.386
SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN OUR 
TIMELINE HAPPENED AT THE END OF 

11:06:59.644 --> 11:07:07.957
JUNE. ON JUNE 27, BLAIR GOT  AN 
EMAIL FROM HIS LOSS, MULVANEY HE

11:07:08.197 --> 11:07:10.197
WAS ON AIR FORCE 

11:07:13.546 --> 11:07:16.108
1 WITH RESIDENT TRUMP. ACCORDING
TO PUBLIC REPORTS MULVANEY ASKED

11:07:16.348 --> 11:07:22.340
BLAIR,  DID WE EVER FIND OUT 
ABOUT THE MONEY FOR UKRAINE AND 

11:07:22.579 --> 11:07:27.729
WHETHER WE CAN HOLD IT BACK? 
BLAIR RESPONDED, IT WOULD BE 

11:07:27.970 --> 11:07:32.528
POSSIBLE , BUT HE SAID THEY 
SHOULD, 

11:07:36.680 --> 11:07:40.368
EXPECT CONGRESS TO BECOME 
UNHINGED. WHEN 

11:07:45.017 --> 11:07:47.351
DID MULVANEY AND BLAIR DISCUSSED
THE PRESIDENTS FREEZE ON 

11:07:47.593 --> 11:07:50.989
MILITARY AID?  WAS THERE FURTHER
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ISSUE IN 

11:07:52.317 --> 11:07:56.633
THIS EMAIL? DID MULVANEY EXPLAIN
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO FREEZE 

11:07:59.476 --> 11:08:03.923
THE MONEY, EVEN IF IT WOULD COST
CONGRESS, QUOTING AGAIN, 

11:08:06.511 --> 11:08:10.631
BECOMING UNHINGED? DID THEY 
DISCUSS WHY CONGRESS WOULD HAVE 

11:08:10.869 --> 11:08:15.067
SUCH A STRONG REACTION? AND 
WHETHER IT WOULD BE JUSTIFIED? 

11:08:15.306 --> 11:08:18.378
DID BLAIR  RAISE ANY OBJECTIONS 

11:08:23.034 --> 11:08:27.753
TO THIS DECISION TO FREEZE THE 
FUNDS? THE SENATE COULD OBTAIN 

11:08:27.995 --> 11:08:29.995
THESE ANSWERS BY HEARING FROM 
THESE WITNESSES DIRECTLY. LET'S 

11:08:32.404 --> 11:08:37.113
MOVE ON TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE FREEZE. DESPITE THE WARNING 

11:08:37.354 --> 11:08:42.603
FROM BLAIR ON HOW CONGRESS WOULD
REACT PRESIDENT TRUMP  ORDERED A

11:08:42.841 --> 11:08:46.022
FREEZE ON THE MILITARY AID TO 
UKRAINE IN JULY. BLAIR AND 

11:08:46.269 --> 11:08:48.269
DUFFEY WERE DIRECTLY  INVOLVED 

11:08:51.196 --> 11:08:54.023
WITH EXECUTING THE PRESIDENTS 
ORDER. TO BE CLEAR, CERTAIN 

11:08:57.668 --> 11:09:00.052
DECISIONS WERE SHROUDED IN IN 
SECRECY BY KEY ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

11:09:01.324 --> 11:09:03.805
REVEALED. ON JULY 3 THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT TOLD VARIOUS 

11:09:06.679 --> 11:09:12.770
OFFICIALS THAT  OMB WAS BLOCKING
IT  TO SPEND THE $41 MILLION OF 

11:09:13.011 --> 11:09:17.813
THE EIGHT, MORE SPECIFICALLY,  
OMB  DIRECTED THE STATE 

11:09:18.052 --> 11:09:20.155
DEPARTMENT NOT TO SEND A 
NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS ABOUT 

11:09:20.389 --> 11:09:27.088
SPENDING THE AID. WITHOUT THAT 
NOTIFICATION IT WAS EFFECTIVELY 

11:09:27.477 --> 11:09:33.785
FROZEN. WHO FROM  OMB ORDERED TO
STATE DEPARTMENT  NOT TO SEND IT

11:09:35.316 --> 11:09:40.218
CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION? DID 
THEY GIVE A REASON? WE JUST DO 

11:09:41.283 --> 11:09:48.695
NOT KNOW. BUT, REMEMBER, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR HIS 

11:09:49.068 --> 11:09:51.706
INSTRUCTION  OMB AND THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT REFUSED  TO PRODUCE A

11:09:52.275 --> 11:09:56.860
SINGLE DOCUMENT TO THE HOUSE, 
BUT THE DIRECTION ALMOST 

11:09:57.096 --> 11:10:01.981
CERTAINLY CAME FROM DUFFEY OR 
ONE OF HIS SUBORDINATES  ACTING 

11:10:02.235 --> 11:10:10.727
ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT. WE 
ALSO KNOW THAT ON JULY 12, BLAIR

11:10:10.964 --> 11:10:14.478
SENT AN EMAIL TO DUFFEY,  
DUFFEY, MARK 

11:10:17.517 --> 11:10:19.945
SANDY  SOUGHT THE EMAIL AND 
DESCRIBED IT IN HIS TESTIMONY 

11:10:20.181 --> 11:10:24.399
BEFORE THE HOUSE, AS SANDY 
TESTIFIED IT WAS BLAIR WHO 

11:10:24.635 --> 11:10:31.270
CONVEYED  THAT, THE PRESIDENT IS
DIRECTING A HOLD ON MILITARY 

11:10:31.510 --> 11:10:37.150
SUPPORT FUNDING FOR UKRAINE. AND
THAT EMAIL ONLY ADDRESSED  

11:10:40.313 --> 11:10:42.622
UKRAINE.  BLAIRS EMAIL RAISES 
SEVERAL QUESTIONS, BUT OTHER 

11:10:42.861 --> 11:10:47.772
DISCUSSIONS TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO FREEZE 

11:10:48.539 --> 11:10:53.303
THE AID? THIS DID THE 

11:10:56.519 --> 11:10:58.832
PRESIDENT GIVE PERMISSION FOR 
THE FREEZE? DID BLAIR NOTE THAT 

11:10:59.070 --> 11:11:05.499
THE PRESIDENT WAS HOLDING THE 
AID WITH THE POLITICAL RIVAL? WE

11:11:05.738 --> 11:11:11.529
ALSO KNOW TWO DAYS BEFORE 
ALLAIRE SENT HIS EMAIL TO DUFFEY

11:11:11.775 --> 11:11:13.775
, THEY TOLD UKRAINIAN 

11:11:16.784 --> 11:11:19.556
OFFICIALS THAT THEY HAD A DEAL 
WITH MULVANEY. THE DEAL OF 

11:11:19.791 --> 11:11:22.570
CONSISTING A WHITE HOUSE VISIT 
FOR PRESIDENT ZELINSKI AND 

11:11:24.089 --> 11:11:28.047
UKRAINE CONDUCTING THE POLITICAL
INVESTIGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT 

11:11:29.114 --> 11:11:33.754
TRUMP THOUGHT, THAT IS WHAT 
ATTEMPTED THE MASSETER TO SAY 

11:11:33.991 --> 11:11:36.634
THAT HE WAS, NOT PART OF WHAT 
EVER 

11:11:40.293 --> 11:11:43.735
DRUG DEAL THE TWO ARE COOKING 
UP. 

11:11:47.893 --> 11:11:49.893
BLAIR IS MULVANEY'S SENIOR 
ADVISOR, DID BLAIR KNOW ABOUT 

11:11:50.720 --> 11:11:58.033
THE DEAL? DID HE KNOW THAT THERE
WAS LEVER AND AND WITH THE 

11:11:58.272 --> 11:12:00.272
OFFICIAL WHITE 

11:12:02.629 --> 11:12:05.098
HOUSE VISIT. TO GET THE 
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO 

11:12:05.335 --> 11:12:07.335
INVESTIGATE HIS POLITICAL RIVAL?
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS 

11:12:10.299 --> 11:12:13.399
UNABLE TO GET ANY REASON FOR THE
HOLD, THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD, 

11:12:13.633 --> 11:12:15.708
OFFICIALS ACROSS THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS.

11:12:17.918 --> 11:12:22.501
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FREEZE ON 
THE MILITARY AID. AROUND JULY 17

11:12:22.758 --> 11:12:29.911
OR JULY 18, DUFFEY  EMAILED 
BLAIR  HE ASKED ABOUT THE REASON

11:12:30.147 --> 11:12:35.449
FOR THE FREEZE BUT HE GOT NO 
EXPLANATION. INSTEAD, DUFFEY  

11:12:36.584 --> 11:12:40.917
INSISTED, WE NEED TO LET THE 
HOLD TAKE PLACE. AND THEY 

11:12:44.873 --> 11:12:46.873
COULD, REVISIT THE ISSUE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT LATER. 

11:12:51.028 --> 11:12:54.108
IN THE HOUSE, WE HEARD TESTIMONY
FROM MULTIPLE OFFICIALS 

11:12:54.352 --> 11:12:57.993
INCLUDING AMBASSADOR TAYLOR WHO 
WAS, UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THE TOP

11:12:58.690 --> 11:13:04.371
DIPLOMAT IN UKRAINE, OUR 1. WE 
HEARD 

11:13:07.485 --> 11:13:12.031
FROM OTHER OFFICIALS TO 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AND  OMB 

11:13:12.269 --> 11:13:19.856
BUT NO ONE , NO ONE HEARD ANY 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE, ANY CREDIBLE 

11:13:20.094 --> 11:13:22.552
EXPLANATION FOR THE FREEZE AT 
THE TIME. 

11:13:27.139 --> 11:13:30.657
NO ONE. SENATORS, THINK ABOUT 
IT. NOT EVEN OUR 

11:13:33.923 --> 11:13:38.132
TOP DIPLOMAT TO UKRAINE, HAD ANY
IDEA AS TO WHY THE PRESIDENT HAD

11:13:38.374 --> 11:13:46.350
ORDERED THE FUNDS FROZEN. THAT 
IS SHOCKING. THAT SHOULD WORRY 

11:13:46.588 --> 11:13:52.128
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HERE. 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE WITNESSES. 

11:13:52.364 --> 11:13:58.337
THEY ARE UP ON THE SLIDE. AGAIN,
NO ONE, NO ONE 

11:14:02.122 --> 11:14:04.509
SAYS WHY THIS DECISION MADE SO 
SECRETLY AND WITHOUT ANY 

11:14:04.753 --> 11:14:06.753
EXPLANATION, WHY WAS 

11:14:09.699 --> 11:14:12.126
THE PRESIDENT COMPROMISING THE 
SAFETY OF A STRATEGIC ALLY IN 

11:14:12.364 --> 11:14:16.219
THE REGION? WHY WAS HE HARMING 
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST 

11:14:16.457 --> 11:14:18.457
IN THE PROCESS? ON 

11:14:21.732 --> 11:14:26.317
JULY 26, DUFFEY ATTENDED A 
MEETING FOR  THE HIGH LEVEL 

11:14:26.561 --> 11:14:31.046
EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF OFFICIALS, 
HE MADE CLEAR THAT THE FREEZE ON

11:14:31.304 --> 11:14:33.304
MILITARY AID WAS 

11:14:35.536 --> 11:14:37.597
MADE ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
EXPRESS DIRECTION BUT APPARENTLY

11:14:37.835 --> 11:14:39.835
HE COULD NOT CLEARLY EXPLAIN 
WHETHER IT WAS A 

11:14:42.900 --> 11:14:44.900
FREEZE BEYOND A VAGUE REFERENCE 
TO CONCERNS 

11:14:48.284 --> 11:14:57.544
ABOUT CORRUPTION. WITNESSES WHO 
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE ALL 

11:14:57.783 --> 11:15:02.173
PROVIDED THE SAME CONSISTENT, 
RECOUNTING OF WHAT HAPPENED. AS 

11:15:02.416 --> 11:15:09.103
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE STATEMENTS 
ON THE SLIDE, OFFICIALS WERE NOT

11:15:09.340 --> 11:15:13.121
PROVIDED, CLEAR EXPLANATION FOR 
SUCH A DRAMATIC STEP. AS WE HAVE

11:15:13.361 --> 11:15:17.947
ALREADY DISCUSSED EARLIER WE 
WILL EXPLAIN IN MORE DEPTH 

11:15:18.184 --> 11:15:22.371
DURING THE TRIAL, THESE FACTS 
CONTRADICT THE WHITE HOUSE'S 

11:15:23.187 --> 11:15:25.187
RECENT CLAIMS OF WHY PRESIDENT 

11:15:27.707 --> 11:15:30.988
TRUMP FROZE THE UKRAINE AID, 
THOSE FACTS CLEARLY SHOW A FIRST

11:15:31.228 --> 11:15:35.553
BY THIS PRESIDENT AND THOSE 
AROUND HIM TO FABRICATE 

11:15:35.792 --> 11:15:39.770
EXPLANATIONS AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT, HIS LEGAL SCHEME CAME

11:15:40.332 --> 11:15:47.210
TO LIGHT. AND FAKE -- IN FACT, 
THE COUNSEL OF THE FREEZE FOUND 

11:15:49.942 --> 11:15:51.942
THAT MULVANEY AND  OMB ATTEMPTED

11:15:55.028 --> 11:15:57.102
TO CREATE AN AFTER-THE-FACT 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PRESIDENTS

11:15:57.338 --> 11:16:01.239

JULY 25 PHONE CALL WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. TELLING HIM IT

MAKE SURE THAT  OMB CONTINUED TO
FREEZE THE MILITARY AID  THAT  

11:20:55.615 --> 11:20:58.241
UKRAINE  SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. 
THIS EMAIL, LIKE ALL OTHERS, WAS

11:20:58.486 --> 11:21:02.684
NOT PRODUCED TO THE HOUSE. 
HOWEVER, IT WAS PRODUCED 

11:21:02.935 --> 11:21:04.935
PURSUANT TO 

11:21:06.327 --> 11:21:09.264

REFLECTS, AND DUFFEY TOLD THE

GUIDANCE  THEY SHOULD HOLD OFF 
ANY ADDITIONAL  DOD OBLIGATIONS 

11:21:25.213 --> 11:21:33.197
OF THESE FUNDS. DUFFEY ADDED  
THAT THE REQUEST WAS SENSITIVE 

11:21:33.435 --> 11:21:35.435

11:21:39.296 --> 11:21:43.222

11:21:48.734 --> 11:21:50.734
WHO GAVE IT TO HIM 

11:21:54.788 --> 11:21:58.382
WAS THAT CONNECTED TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S PHONE CALL? AND WHY WAS 

11:21:58.644 --> 11:22:02.634
IT SO SENSITIVE THAT HE DIRECTED
DOD TO KEEP IT CLOSELY HELD?  

11:22:02.881 --> 11:22:04.883
THE SENATE SHOULD DEMAND THE 
ANSWERS TO 

11:22:08.754 --> 11:22:13.390
THESE QUESTIONS. THE SENATE 
SHOULD ALSO HEAR FROM DUFFEY  

11:22:13.642 --> 11:22:15.642
WHY 

11:22:18.113 --> 11:22:20.515
HE ABRUPTLY REMOVED THE CAREER  
OMB OFFICIAL THE QUESTION THE 

11:22:20.756 --> 11:22:24.794
FREEZE ON  MILITARY AID TO 
UKRAINE AND WHETHER HE DID SO AT

11:22:25.034 --> 11:22:30.552

CAREER OFFICIAL THAT HANDLED 

11:22:36.755 --> 11:22:42.507
MILITARY AID TO CRANE GOT DUFFEY
TO PROVIDE  AN EXPLANATION TO 

11:22:44.305 --> 11:22:51.383
THE FREEZE. AND OTHER OFFICIALS 
FROM THE  OMB AND THE PENTAGON 

11:22:51.623 --> 11:22:55.084
RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT  THE 
FREEZE WITH THE CONTROL ACT, THE

11:22:55.331 --> 11:23:01.802
FEDERAL LAW THAT LIMITS THE 
PRESIDENTS ABILITY TO WITHHOLD 

11:23:02.065 --> 11:23:04.715
FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED 
BY CONGRESS. IN FACT, 

11:23:08.545 --> 11:23:12.658
TWO CAREER  OMB OFFICIALS 
ULTIMATELY RESIGNED  IN PART, 

11:23:12.896 --> 11:23:16.034
BASED ON CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
HANDLING OF THE 

11:23:19.158 --> 11:23:22.737
UKRAINE MILITARY, MILITARY AID 
FREEZE, THESE CONCERNS WERE NOT 

11:23:22.975 --> 11:23:25.688
UNFOUNDED. JUST LAST WEEK, THE 

11:23:28.767 --> 11:23:30.327
NONPARTISAN GOVERNMENT 
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ISSUED A 

11:23:30.328 --> 11:23:32.328
DETAILED LEGAL 

11:23:34.546 --> 11:23:39.019
OPINION FINDING  OMB VIOLATED 
FEDERAL LAW  BY EXECUTING THE 

11:23:39.258 --> 11:23:44.905
PRESIDENTS ORDER TO FREEZE 
LETERRIUS AID TO UKRAINE. 

11:23:45.147 --> 11:23:47.147
REMARKABLY ON JULY 29, 

11:23:50.931 --> 11:23:53.302
AFTER SANDY HAD EXPRESSED HIS 
CONCERN ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF 

11:23:55.704 --> 11:23:57.704
THE FREEZE. 

11:24:00.767 --> 11:24:05.207
DUFFEY , INSTEAD DUFFEY TOOK 
OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

11:24:05.445 --> 11:24:11.529
WITHHOLDING THE AID , IT'S OFF. 
HE WAS A POLITICAL APPOINTEE HE 

11:24:11.773 --> 11:24:13.773
HAD NO 

11:24:16.661 --> 11:24:19.426
RELEVANT EXPERIENCE HE HAD NO 
DEMONSTRATION OF INTEREST IN 

11:24:19.666 --> 11:24:24.396
SUCH MATTERS. HIS LAST JOB HAS 
BEEN AS THE STATE LEVEL 

11:24:24.632 --> 11:24:29.151
REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIAL. HE 
TOOK OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

11:24:29.491 --> 11:24:35.012
WITHHOLDING AID, HE GAVE NO 
EXULTATION FOR HIS DECISION HE 

11:24:36.337 --> 11:24:41.784
ONLY SAID, THAT HE WANTED TO 
BECOME, MORE INVOLVED IN 

11:24:45.129 --> 11:24:47.129
DAILY 

11:24:48.143 --> 11:24:50.143
OPERATIONS., SANDY WHO HAS 
DECADES OF EXPERIENCE TESTIFIED 

11:24:50.249 --> 11:24:54.258
THAT NOTHING LIKE THIS HAVE EVER
HAPPENED LIKE THIS IN 

11:24:58.256 --> 11:25:01.094
HIS CAREER. HIS BOSS, POLITICAL 
.8 JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A SUDDEN 

11:25:01.333 --> 11:25:06.211
INTEREST IN BEING MORE HANDS-ON.
AND WAS LASER FOCUSED 

11:25:06.448 --> 11:25:08.448
EXCLUSIVELY 

11:25:10.926 --> 11:25:14.204
ON UKRAINE. THE SENATE SHOULD 
ASK DUFFEY, WHY HE TOOK OVER  

11:25:14.449 --> 11:25:19.692
THE HANDLING OF THE UKRAINE 
MILITARY AID. WAS HE DIRECTED 

11:25:20.510 --> 11:25:22.510
TO? WHY 

11:25:25.582 --> 11:25:27.582
WAS SANDY

11:25:29.226 --> 11:25:31.408
REMOVED FROM HIS RESPONSIBILITY 
OVER UKRAINE AID WAS IT BECAUSE 

11:25:31.651 --> 11:25:33.801
HE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE 
LEGALITY OF THE FREEZE? THESE 

11:25:34.038 --> 11:25:39.571
QUESTIONS ARE THOSE THAT DUFFEY 
WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER.  NOW, 

11:25:39.810 --> 11:25:44.174
WE MOVE ON TO WARNINGS 

11:25:48.144 --> 11:25:50.731
FROM DOD, AROUND THIS PERIOD IN 
LATE JULY AND EARLY AUGUST, 

11:25:50.970 --> 11:25:56.090
DUFFEY  IGNORED WARNINGS FROM  
DOD OF THE LEGALITY OF THE 

11:25:56.327 --> 11:25:59.379
FREEZE, THE SENATE SHOULD HEAR 
FROM HIM  AND JUDGE WHAT HE HAS 

11:25:59.617 --> 11:26:01.975
TO SAY. THROUGHOUT JULY AND 
AUGUST, DUFFEY  

11:26:05.604 --> 11:26:08.793
EXECUTED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
FREEZE OF THE MILITARY AID WITH 

11:26:09.168 --> 11:26:12.486
FUNDING DOCUMENTS THROUGH  OMB 
AND  CAREFULLY WORDED FOOTNOTES,

11:26:12.969 --> 11:26:18.679
OMB TRIED TO CLAIM  THAT THIS, 
WAS A BRIEF PAUSE. AND IT WOULD 

11:26:20.672 --> 11:26:26.623
NOT AFFECT THE ABILITY OF  DOD  
TO SPEND THE MONEY WITH TIME AS 

11:26:26.861 --> 11:26:29.766
WE NOW KNOW FROM PUBLIC 
REPORTING AS OF FREEZE CONTINUED

11:26:33.611 --> 11:26:35.914
DOD OFFICIALS GREW MORE MORE 
ALARMED. THEY KNEW THAT THE 

11:26:36.151 --> 11:26:39.565
FREEZE WOULD IMPACT THE  DOD 
ABILITY  DESPITE THE FUNDS OF 

11:26:39.810 --> 11:26:47.666
THE FISCAL YEAR. AND AND VOICING
THE 

11:26:50.126 --> 11:26:52.126
CONCERNS WITH DUFFEY ON MULTIPLE

11:26:55.090 --> 11:26:58.102
OCCASIONS.  FIRST, AND THEN 
EMAIL, AUGUST 8, NINTH, McCUSKER

11:26:58.345 --> 11:27:04.366
TOLD DUFFEY  THAT THEY COULD NO 
LONGER SUPPORT THE CLAIM OF  OMB

11:27:04.603 --> 11:27:08.904
THAT IT WOULD NOT  PRECLUDE 
TIMELY EXECUTION FOR THE AID FOR

11:27:09.140 --> 11:27:11.140
UKRAINE THE EMAIL READ, AS 

11:27:14.808 --> 11:27:20.505
WE DISCUSSED AS OF AUGUST 12 I 
DON'T NOT THINK THAT WE COULD 

11:27:20.799 --> 11:27:24.336
AGREE THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE 
TIMELY EXECUTION AND WE HOPE IT 

11:27:24.578 --> 11:27:27.566
WON'T AND WE WILL DO ALL WE CAN 
TO EXECUTE ONCE THE POLICY 

11:27:27.813 --> 11:27:30.270
DECISION IS MADE. BUT CAN NO 
LONGER MAKE THAT 

11:27:33.537 --> 11:27:39.943
DECLARATIVE STATEMENT. THEN 
AGAIN ON AUGUST 12. McCUSKER 

11:27:40.185 --> 11:27:43.835
WARNED DUFFEY IN AN EMAIL THE 
FOOTNOTES  NEEDED TO INCLUDE A 

11:27:45.342 --> 11:27:47.342
CAVEAT THAT EXECUTION 

11:27:51.748 --> 11:27:53.812
RISK INCREASES IN DELAYS, THE 
HOUSE NEVER RECEIVED THE 

11:27:54.134 --> 11:27:56.134
DOCUMENTS FROM  OMB OR  

11:27:59.395 --> 11:28:04.290
DOD.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY CONTAIN 
DUE TO THE PUBLIC REPORTING 

11:28:04.528 --> 11:28:07.608
DESPITE PERSISTENT EFFORTS BY 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE 

11:28:10.335 --> 11:28:12.335
PENTAGON'S ALARM SHOULD HAVE 
RAISED CONCERNS FOR DUFFY. DID 

11:28:12.720 --> 11:28:14.837
HE SHARE THE CONCERNS WITH 

11:28:18.564 --> 11:28:23.522
ANYONE ELSE? DID HE AGREE WITH 
THE CONCERNS OR TAKE ANY ACTIONS

11:28:23.762 --> 11:28:27.729
TO THE RESPONSE DID HE TAKE 
DIRECTION FROM BLAIR. 

11:28:32.560 --> 11:28:34.783
THESE QUESTIONS THESE ARE 
QUESTIONS THAT DUFFEY SHOULD 

11:28:35.023 --> 11:28:37.023
ANSWER DESPITE HIS ACTIONS , 
EXECUTING THE 

11:28:41.223 --> 11:28:43.223
PRESIDENTS FREEZE

11:28:45.199 --> 11:28:48.160
IN AUGUST HE SIGNED OFF ON THE 
MEMORANDUM TO THE ACTING 

11:28:48.409 --> 11:28:50.409
DIRECTOR 

11:28:52.522 --> 11:28:54.522
THE RECOMMENDED

11:28:58.754 --> 11:29:00.930
WHERE THE MILITARY AID WAS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE STRATEGY IN 

11:29:01.196 --> 11:29:03.623
THE REGION, IT SERVED TO COUNTER
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AND THAT THE 

11:29:03.869 --> 11:29:08.680
AID WAS ROOTED WITH BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT IN CONGRESS. THIS IS 

11:29:11.758 --> 11:29:14.445
CONTRARY TO THE ACTIONS OF 
DUFFEY LEADING UP TO THE MEMO.  

11:29:15.402 --> 11:29:17.402
WHAT CHANGE? 

11:29:20.680 --> 11:29:22.984
WHAT CAUSE DUFFEY TO DISAGREE 
WITH THE PRESIDENTS DIRECTION TO

11:29:23.229 --> 11:29:27.192
CONTINUE TO WITHHOLD THE AID  
DUFFEY SHOULD BE CALLED TO 

11:29:27.428 --> 11:29:32.737
EXPLAIN.  WHY HE RECOMMENDED 
THAT THE PRESIDENT RELEASED THE 

11:29:32.982 --> 11:29:34.982
AID. WHAT OTHER STEPS 

11:29:37.989 --> 11:29:44.783
YOU TOOK, AND THE WHITE HOUSE 
DISREGARDED THE RECOMMENDATION 

11:29:45.022 --> 11:29:47.022
BASED ON PUBLIC REPORTING, 

11:29:49.126 --> 11:29:51.126
WE KNOW AFTER THE PRESS REPORTED
THE FREEZE IN 

11:29:54.629 --> 11:29:56.629
LATE AUGUST,

11:29:59.862 --> 11:30:02.626
THAT WOULD PRECLUDE THE 
OBLIGATION OF THE FUNDS.BEFORE 

11:30:02.872 --> 11:30:04.872
THE END OF 

12:31:25.389 --> 12:31:28.292

12:33:14.839 --> 12:33:16.872
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I BEGIN MR. CHIEF

12:33:19.522 --> 12:33:24.588
THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT. 
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, SENATORS 

12:33:25.003 --> 12:33:27.003
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT. HOUSE 
MANAGERS STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS 

12:33:27.373 --> 12:33:30.273
AMENDMENT TO SUBPOENA JOHN 
BOLTON. I'M STRUCK WHAT WE'VE 

12:33:30.489 --> 12:33:32.489
HEARD TONIGHT. THEY

12:33:39.627 --> 12:33:41.658
COMPLAIN ABOUT PROCESS BUT THEY 
DO NOT SERIOUSLY CONTEST ANY OF 

12:33:41.864 --> 12:33:43.694
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT. THEY INSIST THAT THE 

12:33:43.695 --> 12:33:45.510
PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING 
WRONG. THAT THEY REFUSED TO 

12:33:45.511 --> 12:33:50.596
ALLOW THE EVIDENCE AND HEAR FROM
THE WITNESSES, THEY WILL NOT 

12:33:50.799 --> 12:33:52.834
PERMIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 
HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES AND THEY

12:33:53.030 --> 12:33:55.030
LIKE AND LIE

12:33:59.732 --> 12:34:01.570
AND LIE. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR 
MONTHS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

12:34:01.571 --> 12:34:03.999
REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED THAT THE 
HOUSE DENIED THE RIGHT TO 

12:34:04.199 --> 12:34:10.295
WITNESSES AND CROSS-EXAMINE 
WITNESSES. YOU HEARD MRS. 

12:34:10.696 --> 12:34:15.791
PALLONE LIGHT TODAY. I HAVE WITH
ME THE LETTER INVITING THE 

12:34:15.979 --> 12:34:19.443
PRESIDENT AND HIS COUNSEL TO 
ATTEND OUR HEARINGS TO 

12:34:19.643 --> 12:34:23.293
CROSS-EXAMINE THE WITNESSES TO 
CALL WITNESSES OF HIS OWN AND SO

12:34:23.498 --> 12:34:27.763
FORTH. AND I HAVE THE LETTER THE
WHITE HOUSE LETTER SIGNED BY 

12:34:28.169 --> 12:34:30.169
MRS. PALLONE REJECTING THAT 
OFFER.

12:34:34.467 --> 12:34:36.702
WE SHOULD EXPECT AT LEAST A 
LITTLE REGARD FOR THE TRUTH FROM

12:34:36.903 --> 12:34:40.969
THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT THAT IS 
APPARENTLY TOO MUCH TO EXPECT. 

12:34:41.370 --> 12:34:43.370
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS A 
TRIAL. AS

12:34:48.286 --> 12:34:50.286
AT A TRIAL THE LAWYERS PRESENT 
EVIDENCE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

12:34:50.322 --> 12:34:54.177
KNOW THAT. MOST 10-YEAR-OLDS 
KNOW THAT. IF YOU VOTE TO BLOCK 

12:34:54.939 --> 12:34:57.311
THIS WITNESS OR ANY OF THE 
EVIDENCE

12:35:02.703 --> 12:35:05.139
, IT SHOULD BE PRESENTED HERE, 
IT COULD ONLY BE BECAUSE YOU DO 

12:35:05.344 --> 12:35:07.571
NOT WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 
HEAR THE EVIDENCE. YOU DO NOT 

12:35:07.785 --> 12:35:09.920
WANT A FAIR TRIAL. THAT YOU ARE 
COMPLICIT IN

12:35:13.470 --> 12:35:15.470
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO 
HIDE HIS MISCONDUCT AND HIDE THE

12:35:15.508 --> 12:35:17.508
TRUTH FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

12:35:22.001 --> 12:35:23.820
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS APPOINTED 
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE HAS 

12:35:23.821 --> 12:35:25.821
STATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO 
TESTIFY IN THIS TRIAL. HE IS 

12:35:25.855 --> 12:35:27.855
PREPARED TO TESTIFY. HE SAID 
THAT

12:35:33.170 --> 12:35:35.205
HE HAS RELEVANT EVIDENCE NOT YET
DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. HIS 

12:35:35.403 --> 12:35:37.244
COMMENTS REAFFIRM WHAT IS 
OBVIOUS ON THE TESTIMONY AND 

12:35:37.245 --> 12:35:41.088
DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY THE HOUSE,
WHICH HIGHLIGHT AND CAPACITOR 

12:35:42.041 --> 12:35:47.790
BOLTON'S ROLE AND CRITICISM OF 
THE PRESIDENT'S MISCONDUCT. IN 

12:35:48.003 --> 12:35:52.270
FACT, EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE 
COLLECTED BY THE HOUSE, MAKES 

12:35:52.471 --> 12:35:55.040
CLEAR THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON NOT
ONLY HAD FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF

12:35:55.180 --> 12:35:59.773
THE UKRAINE SCHEME, BUT HE WAS 
DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH IT. HE 

12:36:00.388 --> 12:36:04.453
DESCRIBED THE TEAM AS A DRUG 
DEAL TO A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE 

12:36:04.655 --> 12:36:06.798
STAFF. HE WARNED THAT PRESENT 
TRUMP'S PERSONAL

12:36:10.338 --> 12:36:13.480
LAWYER, RUDY GIULIANI WOULD BLOW
EVERYBODY ELSE UP. IN ADVANCE OF

12:36:14.762 --> 12:36:16.762
2019 CALL,

12:36:20.703 --> 12:36:22.128
AMBASSADOR BOLTON EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

12:36:22.129 --> 12:36:24.129
WOULD ASK THE UKRAINIAN

12:36:32.275 --> 12:36:33.706
RESIDENT TO ANNOUNCE THESE 
POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH 

12:36:33.707 --> 12:36:35.738
IS OF COURSE, EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED. OF COURSE THERE IS NO 

12:36:35.941 --> 12:36:37.759
INVESTIGATION, ALL HE CARED 
ABOUT WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT TO 

12:36:37.760 --> 12:36:40.207
SMEAR THE POLITICAL RIVAL IN THE
RENOVATED STATES. HE REPEATED TO

12:36:40.407 --> 12:36:43.399
HIS STAFF TO REPORT THEIR OWN 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

12:36:43.537 --> 12:36:45.537
COUNCIL.

12:36:49.345 --> 12:36:51.345
AS THE SCHEME WAS UNFOLDING. AND
FINALLY HIS NATIONAL SECURITY 

12:36:51.373 --> 12:36:54.424
ADVISOR, OBJECTED TO THE 
MILITARY AID TO THE UKRAINE AND 

12:36:54.622 --> 12:36:57.271
ADVOCATED FOR THE RELEASE OF 
THAT AID IN INCLUDING DIRECTLY 

12:36:57.472 --> 12:37:02.339
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. AS WE ALL 
KNOW THAT IMPOUNDING CONTROL ACT

12:37:02.554 --> 12:37:06.806
MAKES THAT ILLEGAL THE 
PRESIDENT'S WITHHOLDING OF THAT 

12:37:07.021 --> 12:37:11.287
AID. HAVE THE CONGRESS VOTED 
FOR. BUT THE PRESIDENT IGNORED 

12:37:11.488 --> 12:37:15.952
WARNINGS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ALL 
HE CARED ABOUT IS SMEARING THE 

12:37:16.704 --> 12:37:20.315
POLITICAL RIVAL, THE LAW MEANT 
NOTHING TO HIM. IT AMBASSADOR

12:37:25.290 --> 12:37:27.125
BOLTON IS WILLING TO TESTIFY 
EVERYTHING HE WITNESS. PRESIDENT

12:37:27.126 --> 12:37:29.770
TRUMP DOES NOT WANT YOU HERE 
FROM AMBASSADOR BOLTON. IT HAS 

12:37:29.973 --> 12:37:31.973
NOTHING TO DO WITH EXECUTIVE

12:37:36.275 --> 12:37:38.275
PRIVILEGE OR THIS OTHER 
NONSENSE. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO 

12:37:38.293 --> 12:37:40.936
WITH NATIONAL SECURITY. IF 
PRESIDENT CARED ABOUT NATIONAL 

12:37:41.142 --> 12:37:43.142
SECURITY HE WOULD NOT HAVE 
LOCKED

12:37:54.341 --> 12:37:56.341
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO A 
STRATEGIC ALLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO 

12:37:56.380 --> 12:37:58.207
SECURE A PERSONAL POLITICAL 
FAVOR FOR HIMSELF. THE PRESIDENT

12:37:58.208 --> 12:38:00.208
DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, THE PRESIDENT

12:38:00.240 --> 12:38:04.492
DOES NOT WANT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO HEAR FIRST HAND 

12:38:04.908 --> 12:38:06.939
TESTIMONY THAT MISCONDUCT IS AT 
THE HEART OF THIS TRIAL. THE 

12:38:07.145 --> 12:38:09.145
QUESTION IS WHETHER THE SENATE 
WILL BE COMPLICIT IN THE 

12:38:09.175 --> 12:38:11.807
PRESIDENT'S CRIMES FOR COVERING 
THEM UP. ANY SENATOR THAT VOTES 

12:38:12.556 --> 12:38:14.452
AGAINST AMBASSADOR BOLTON'S 
TESTIMONY OR ANY RELEVANT 

12:38:14.453 --> 12:38:19.737
TESTIMONY SHOWS THAT HE WANTS TO
BE PART OF THE COVER-UP. THIS IS

12:38:20.486 --> 12:38:22.486
A RELEVANT

12:38:28.471 --> 12:38:30.289
WEAKNESS FOR TESTIFYING HERE. 
UNFORTUNATELY, SO FAR, I'VE SEEN

12:38:30.290 --> 12:38:32.324
EVERY REPUBLICAN SENATOR HAS 
SHOWN THEY WANT TO BE PART OF 

12:38:32.528 --> 12:38:34.355
THE COVER-UP BY VOTING AGAINST 
EVERY DOCUMENT THEY HAVE 

12:38:34.356 --> 12:38:38.019
PROPOSED. AMBASSADOR BOLTON IS A
FIRST-HAND WITNESS TO PRESIDENT 

12:38:38.219 --> 12:38:40.219
TRUMP'S ABUSE OF POWER.

12:38:44.719 --> 12:38:46.349
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
REPORTED DIRECTLY TO THE 

12:38:46.350 --> 12:38:48.350
PRESIDENT AND SUPERVISE THE 
ENTIRE

12:38:54.677 --> 12:38:56.293
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THAT 
INCLUDED THREE KEY WITNESSES 

12:38:56.294 --> 12:38:58.132
WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR UKRAINE 
MATTERS WHO TESTIFIED IN GREAT 

12:38:58.133 --> 12:39:00.365
DETAIL BEFORE THE HOUSE, BE ON A
HILL, TIM MORRISON AND 

12:39:01.121 --> 12:39:04.576
LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALEXANDER 
VINDMAN. 

12:39:15.589 --> 12:39:17.834
JOHN BOLTON WAS THE TIP OF THE 
SPEAR FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 

12:39:18.035 --> 12:39:19.653
NATIONAL SECURITY. IT WAS HIS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE 

12:39:19.654 --> 12:39:21.654
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REGARDING 

12:39:21.781 --> 12:39:23.781
FORD POLICY AND NATIONAL 
SECURITY. BY VIRTUE OF HIS 

12:39:23.921 --> 12:39:25.921
UNIQUE POSITION APPOINTED BY THE
PRESIDENT BOLTON HAD KNOWLEDGE 

12:39:26.316 --> 12:39:31.240
OF INTELLIGENCE WITH UKRAINE 
INCLUDING THE SUPPORT OF THE NEW

12:39:31.438 --> 12:39:34.286
PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHY THE 
PRESIDENT AND SOME MEMBERS OF 

12:39:34.485 --> 12:39:38.900
THIS BODY ARE AFRAID TO HEAR 
FROM AMBASSADOR BOLTON AS THEY 

12:39:39.043 --> 12:39:45.052
KNOW, HE KNOWS TOO MUCH. THERE 
IS ALSO SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 

12:39:45.253 --> 12:39:49.609
THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON KEPT A 
KEY EYE ON RUDY GIULIANI WHO WAS

12:39:50.938 --> 12:39:55.405
ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE 
PRESIDENT. AS WE DESCRIBED, 

12:39:55.808 --> 12:39:59.674
AMBASSADOR BOLTON COMMUNICATED 
DIRECTLY. HE KNOWS THE DETAILS 

12:39:59.874 --> 12:40:04.900
OF THE DRUG DEAL HE WAS WARNED 
AGAINST. PERHAPS MOST 

12:40:05.041 --> 12:40:10.988
IMPORTANTLY, BOLTON SAID HE WILL
TESTIFY AND THAT HE HAS RELEVANT

12:40:11.134 --> 12:40:17.340
INFORMATION THAT HAS NOT YET 
BEEN DISCLOSED. A KEY WITNESS 

12:40:17.553 --> 12:40:22.021
HAS COME FORWARD TO CONFIRM NOT 
ONLY THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN 

12:40:22.221 --> 12:40:25.060
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S 
BUT THAT HE HAS NEW EVIDENCE WE 

12:40:25.261 --> 12:40:29.940
HAVE NOT YET HEARD. THAT IS 
PRECISELY WHAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON

12:40:30.142 --> 12:40:34.205
HAS DONE.'S LAWYER TELLS US, 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS 

12:40:34.409 --> 12:40:37.044
"PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN MANY OF 
THE EVENTS, MEETINGS AND 

12:40:37.254 --> 12:40:39.254
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHICH THE 
HOUSE

12:40:44.969 --> 12:40:46.802
HEARD TESTIMONY AS WELL AS MANY 
RELEVANT MEETINGS AND 

12:40:46.803 --> 12:40:48.803
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET 
BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE TESTIMONY 

12:40:48.822 --> 12:40:56.954
SO FAR". SO FAR HE REFUSED TO 
APPEAR VOLUNTARILY, HIS LAWYERS 

12:40:57.156 --> 12:41:00.205
INFORMED THE HOUSE INTELLIGENT 
COMMITTEE THAT IT WOULD TAKE A 

12:41:00.964 --> 12:41:02.964
SUBPOENA. BUT AMBASSADOR

12:41:06.704 --> 12:41:08.704
CHANGED HIS TUNE. HE RECENTLY 
ISSUED A STATEMENT CONFIRMING 

12:41:09.074 --> 12:41:13.605
THAT "THAT IF THE SENATE ISSUES 
A SUBPOENA FOR MY TESTIMONY I'M 

12:41:13.810 --> 12:41:16.582
PREPARED TO TESTIFY.". THE 
QUESTION PRESENTED

12:41:24.374 --> 12:41:27.022
IS CLEAR. IT COMES DOWN TO THIS,
WILL THE SENATE DO ITS DUTY AND 

12:41:27.222 --> 12:41:29.457
HEAR ALL THE EVIDENCE? OR WILL 
ISLAMIST DOOR SHUT AND SHOW IT 

12:41:29.659 --> 12:41:32.655
IS PARTICIPATING IN A COVER-UP 
BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO HEAR 

12:41:32.797 --> 12:41:38.998
TESTIMONY FROM THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL, THE CHAIRMAN 

12:41:39.400 --> 12:41:43.271
FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR TO THE PRESENT BECAUSE 

12:41:43.470 --> 12:41:47.535
THEY FEAR WHAT HE MIGHT SAY. 
THEY FEAR HE KNOWS TOO MUCH. 

12:41:47.937 --> 12:41:49.937
CONSIDER THIS AS WELL. WHY IS

12:41:55.459 --> 12:41:57.285
PRESIDENT TRUMP SO INTENT ON 
PREVENTING US FROM HEARING 

12:41:57.286 --> 12:42:01.138
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, HIS OWN 
EMPLOYEE APPOINTEE. HIS OWN 

12:42:01.900 --> 12:42:03.900
TRUSTED CONFIDANT

12:42:05.605 --> 12:42:08.252
. BECAUSE HE KNOWS, HE KNOWS HIS
GUILT AND HE KNOWS THAT HE DOES 

12:42:09.012 --> 12:42:12.261
NOT WANT PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT 
IT TO TESTIFY. THE QUESTION IS, 

12:42:12.404 --> 12:42:16.936
WHETHER REPUBLICAN SENATORS HERE
TODAY WILL PARTICIPATE IN THAT 

12:42:17.084 --> 12:42:19.084
COVER-UP.

12:42:20.838 --> 12:42:24.024
THE REASON SEEMS CLEAR, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO LOCK 

12:42:24.161 --> 12:42:32.422
THE WITNESS BECAUSE PRESENT 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WANTS TO BLOCK

12:42:32.624 --> 12:42:35.593
THE SCHEME THAT WAS CALLED A 
DRUG DEAL. 

12:42:35.594 --> 12:42:41.041
&gt;&gt; THE JULY 25th CALL WITH 
AMBASSADOR

12:42:47.454 --> 12:42:49.454
ZELENSKY. THAT MEETING INCLUDED 
DR. HILL, LIEUTENANT  COLONEL

12:42:53.901 --> 12:42:55.901
VINDMAN AND

12:42:57.606 --> 12:43:01.871
SONDLAND AND VOLKER AND RICK 
PERRY. UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS ASKED

12:43:02.073 --> 12:43:04.306
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
SCHEDULED THE WHITE HOUSE 

12:43:04.521 --> 12:43:08.099
MEETING FOR THE NEWLY ELECTED 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. BECAUSE

12:43:11.624 --> 12:43:13.624
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT, THE NEW 

12:43:13.657 --> 12:43:17.926
PRESIDENT OF AN EMBATTLED 
DEMOCRACY, BEING INVADED BY 

12:43:18.127 --> 12:43:22.392
RUSSIA, TO SHOW THAT HE HAD 
LEGITIMACY BY THE MEETING WITH 

12:43:22.592 --> 12:43:28.073
THE UNITED STATE'S. TO DR. HILL 
TESTIFIED THAT AMBASSADOR 

12:43:29.025 --> 12:43:31.025
SONDLAND 

12:43:32.752 --> 12:43:34.985
SAID HE HAD A DEAL FOR MR. 
MULVANEY FOR A WHITE HOUSE 

12:43:35.186 --> 12:43:39.652
VISIT. THEY ANNOUNCED THE 
PRESIDENT'S POLITICALS ARRIVALS.

12:43:40.416 --> 12:43:42.808
BOLT AND ENDED THE MEETING.

12:43:46.963 --> 12:43:48.963
DR. HILL'S TESTIMONY IS ON THE 
SCREEN. AND OTHER WORDS, 

12:43:48.995 --> 12:43:53.875
AMBASSADOR BOLTON AND OTHERS AT 
THE MEETING, THEY WERE 

12:43:54.634 --> 12:43:59.156
INTERESTED IN NATIONAL SECURITY 
OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY WERE 

12:43:59.357 --> 12:44:03.169
INTERESTED IN PROTECTING AN 
AMERICAN ALLY AGAINST RUSSIAN 

12:44:03.310 --> 12:44:05.553
INVASION. THEY COULDN'T 
UNDERSTAND

12:44:09.106 --> 12:44:11.140
WHY THIS SUDDEN ORDER WAS COMING
FROM THE PRESIDENT TO ABANDON 

12:44:11.898 --> 12:44:15.641
THAT ALLY. BECAUSE THEY DID NOT 
YET KNOW, THEY DID NOT YET KNOW 

12:44:16.020 --> 12:44:24.242
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S FOUGHT TO 
EXTORT THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

12:44:26.989 --> 12:44:31.655
INTO DOING HIM A POLITICAL FAVOR
BY ANNOUNCING AN INVESTIGATION 

12:44:32.415 --> 12:44:38.030
OF A POLITICAL RIVAL. WHEN DR. 
HILL REPORTED BACK TO

12:44:43.439 --> 12:44:44.859
AMBASSADOR BOLTON ABOUT THE 
SECOND CONVERSATION, AMBASSADOR 

12:44:44.860 --> 12:44:48.106
BOLTON TOLD DR. HILL TO GO TO 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 

12:44:48.521 --> 12:44:52.573
LEGAL ADVISOR, JOHN EISENBERG 
AND TOLD HIM I'M NOT PART OF 

12:44:52.775 --> 12:44:56.998
WHATEVER DRUG DEAL MULVANEY IS 
COOKING UP ON THIS. 

12:44:56.999 --> 12:45:01.858
&gt;&gt; CYST PACIFIC INSTRUCTION I 
HAVE TO GO TO THE LAWYER TO JOHN

12:45:02.005 --> 12:45:06.389
EISENBERG OUR SENIOR COUNSEL FOR
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO

12:45:07.148 --> 12:45:12.486
BASICALLY SAY YOU TELL EISENBERG
I AM NOT PART OF THIS WHATEVER 

12:45:12.688 --> 12:45:17.770
DRUG DEAL THAT MULVANEY AND 
SONDLAND ARE COOKING UP. 

12:45:17.771 --> 12:45:20.206
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND HIM 
DO MEAN BY THE DRUG DEAL THAT 

12:45:20.405 --> 12:45:23.196
MULVANEY AND SONDLAND WERE 
COOKING UP? 

12:45:23.197 --> 12:45:25.197
&gt;&gt; I

12:45:26.906 --> 12:45:28.323
TOOK IT TO MEAN INVESTIGATIONS 
AND MEANING. 

12:45:28.324 --> 12:45:33.765
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SPEAK TO THE LAWYERS?
&gt;&gt; I CERTAINLY DID. 

12:45:33.766 --> 12:45:37.147
&gt;&gt; THESE STATEMENTS AND EVENTS 
ARE REASON ENOUGH TO INSIST 

12:45:38.028 --> 12:45:42.959
AMBASSADOR BOLTON TESTIFY. HE 
CAN ASK LANE THE CHARACTER 

12:45:43.154 --> 12:45:45.154
RATION AS THE UKRAINE DEAL AS A

12:45:51.487 --> 12:45:53.721
DRUG DEAL. AND WHY HE RAISED HIS
CONCERNS TO LEGAL COUNSEL. HE 

12:45:53.921 --> 12:45:55.921
CAN TELL US EVERYTHING ELSE HE 
KNOWS ABOUT HOW AMBASSADOR 

12:45:55.954 --> 12:45:57.954
SONDLAND, MR. MULVANEY AND 
OTHERS ATTEMPTED TO PRESS THE 

12:45:58.339 --> 12:46:00.339
UKRAINIANS TO DO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S BIDDING.

12:46:05.503 --> 12:46:07.736
ONLY AMBASSADOR BOLTON CAN TELL 
US WHAT HE WAS THINKING AND WHAT

12:46:07.944 --> 12:46:13.823
HE KNEW AS THE SCHEME DEVELOPED 
IT THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT 

12:46:14.036 --> 12:46:16.270
FEARS HIS TESTIMONY. THAT IS WHY
SOME MEMBERS OF THE BODY FEAR 

12:46:16.472 --> 12:46:17.887
HIS TESTIMONY. AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON'S INVOLVEMENT WAS NOT 

12:46:17.888 --> 12:46:23.573
LIMITED TO A FEW ISOLATED 
EVENTS, HE WAS A WITNESS AT KEY 

12:46:23.789 --> 12:46:25.789
MOMENTS OF THE UKRAINIANS

12:46:31.302 --> 12:46:33.302
TEAM. ESPECIALLY JULY, AUGUST, 
SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR. I WOULD 

12:46:33.324 --> 12:46:35.567
LIKE TO WALK THROUGH SOME OF 
THOSE EVENTS. THESE MEMBERS I'M 

12:46:35.769 --> 12:46:39.221
DESCRIBING THEM, THIS IS NOT THE
ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF ISSUES THAT 

12:46:39.982 --> 12:46:41.982
AMBASSADOR BOLTON

12:46:45.520 --> 12:46:47.755
COULD TESTIFY. ONLY EXAMPLES TO 
SHOW WHY HE IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

12:46:47.956 --> 12:46:50.594
WITNESS AND WHY THE PRESIDENT IS
DESPERATE TO BLOCK HIS 

12:46:50.791 --> 12:46:52.791
TESTIMONY. WE KNOW FROM 
AMBASSADOR

12:47:00.339 --> 12:47:02.170
BOLTON'S ATTORNEY THERE MAY BE 
OTHER MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS

12:47:02.171 --> 12:47:04.402
THAT HAVE NOT YET COME TO OUR 
ATTENTION BUT TO TAKE ONE 

12:47:04.602 --> 12:47:06.602
EXAMPLE, WE KNOW FROM WITNESS 
TESTIMONY THAT A BASSETT WHERE 

12:47:06.635 --> 12:47:08.570
BOLTON REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT 

12:47:08.571 --> 12:47:12.943
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL 
LAWYER, MR. GIULIANI. IN SPRING 

12:47:13.137 --> 12:47:16.523
AND SUMMER OF 2019, AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON CAUGHT WIND OF GIULIANI'S

12:47:21.056 --> 12:47:23.056
INVOLVEMENT IN UKRAINE AND BEGAN
TO EXPRESS CONCERN. AMBASSADOR 

12:47:23.089 --> 12:47:27.556
BOLTON EXPRESSED STRONG CONCERNS
ABOUT GIULIANI'S INVOLVEMENT IN 

12:47:28.309 --> 12:47:33.255
UKRAINE MATTERS. HE SAID THIS 
WAS A HAND GRENADE THAT WAS 

12:47:33.463 --> 12:47:36.705
GOING TO BLOW EVERYBODY UP. IT 
WAS BASED ON HIS FEAR THAT MR. 

12:47:36.906 --> 12:47:38.906
GIULIANI'S WORK ON BEHALF OF THE

12:47:42.391 --> 12:47:44.021
PRESIDENT IS ATTEMPT TO HAVE 
UKRAINE ANALYSES INVESTIGATIONS,

12:47:44.022 --> 12:47:46.483
SHAM INVESTIGATIONS AND CAMPAIGN
TO SMEAR AND AMBASSADOR 

12:47:47.270 --> 12:47:53.512
YOVANOVITCH  WOULD BACKFIRE. IT 
TURNS OUT, HE WAS RIGHT. 

12:47:53.513 --> 12:48:00.420
&gt;&gt; DID YOUR BOSS, AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON, TELL YOU THAT GIULIANI 

12:48:00.567 --> 12:48:07.374
WAS "A HAND GRENADE"? WHAT YOU 
THINK HE MEANT BY GIULIANI AS A 

12:48:08.138 --> 12:48:11.840
HAND GRENADE? 
&gt;&gt; WHAT HE MEANT WAS PRETTY 

12:48:12.040 --> 12:48:14.040
CLEAR TO ME IN THE CONTEXT. MR.

12:48:20.373 --> 12:48:22.204
GIULIANI WAS MAKING PUBLICLY 
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION THAT HE 

12:48:22.205 --> 12:48:24.205
WAS PROMOTING, THE STORYLINE HE 
WAS PROMOTING, THE NARRATIVE HE 

12:48:24.226 --> 12:48:26.226
WAS PROMOTING WAS GOING TO

12:48:31.143 --> 12:48:32.360
BACKFIRE. I THINK IT HAS 
BACKFIRED. 

12:48:32.361 --> 12:48:34.543
&gt;&gt; IN JUNE, AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
BECAME AWARE OF GIULIANI'S 

12:48:34.729 --> 12:48:37.645
COORDINATION. HE TOLD DR. HILL 
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 

12:48:37.846 --> 12:48:41.047
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF 
"NOBODY SHOULD BE MEETING WITH 

12:48:41.190 --> 12:48:46.165
GIULIANI". HE OF COURSE, DID NOT
KNOW WHY PEOPLE WERE MEETING 

12:48:46.917 --> 12:48:48.917
WITH GIULIANI

12:48:50.644 --> 12:48:54.297
. DR. HILL ALSO TESTIFIED THAT 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS CLOSELY 

12:48:54.699 --> 12:48:56.699
MONITORING WHAT GIULIANI WAS 
DOING IN THE MESSAGES HE WAS 

12:48:56.737 --> 12:49:01.613
SENDING OUT. BOLTON WAS KEENLY 
AWARE THAT MR. GIULIANI WAS 

12:49:01.814 --> 12:49:03.814
DOING THE PRESIDENT'S

12:49:09.328 --> 12:49:11.328
BIDDING. THAT IS ALSO WHY THE 
PRESIDENT FEARS HIS TESTIMONY. 

12:49:11.361 --> 12:49:13.593
DURING A MEETING ON JUNE 13th, 
2019, AMBASSADOR BOLTON MADE 

12:49:13.795 --> 12:49:19.086
CLEAR THAT HE SUPPORTED MORE 
ENGAGEMENT BY SENIOR WHITE HOUSE

12:49:19.278 --> 12:49:24.368
OFFICIALS. THE QUESTION POSED TO
GIULIANI WAS A KEY VOICE. EVERY 

12:49:24.565 --> 12:49:31.064
TIME YOU CREAM IS MENTIONED, 
GIULIANI POPS UP. AMBASSADOR 

12:49:31.823 --> 12:49:35.354
BOLTON COMMUNICATED DIRECTLY 
WITH GIULIANI AT KEY JUNCTIONS. 

12:49:35.731 --> 12:49:40.200
ACCORDING TO RECORDS BY THE 
HOUSE GIULIANI CONNECTED WITH 

12:49:40.961 --> 12:49:45.619
AMBASSADOR BOLTON'S OFFICE THREE
TIMES BETWEEN APRIL 23rd AND MAY

12:49:45.768 --> 12:49:47.768
10th

12:49:49.135 --> 12:49:54.020
, 2019. A TIME. THE CORRESPONDS 
WITH THE RECALL OF AMBASSADOR 

12:49:54.423 --> 12:49:57.672
YOVANOVITCH AND ACCELERATION OF 
MR. GIULIANI'S EFFORTS  ON 

12:49:57.871 --> 12:50:00.107
BEHALF OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
PRESSURE UKRAINE INTO OPENING 

12:50:00.306 --> 12:50:02.306
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WOULD

12:50:07.422 --> 12:50:09.422
BENEFIT HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN.
FOR INSTANCE, ON APRIL 23rd, THE

12:50:09.453 --> 12:50:11.453
DAY BEFORE THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
RECALLED AMBASSADOR YOVANOVITCH 

12:50:13.521 --> 12:50:18.390
FROM UKRAINE, MR. GIULIANI HAD 
IT A MINUTE CALL FROM THE WHITE 

12:50:18.590 --> 12:50:23.470
HOUSE. 38 MINUTES LATER HE HAD A
OF CALL WITH AMBASSADOR BOLTON. 

12:50:23.675 --> 12:50:28.139
HE CALLED TO TESTIFY WE CAN ASK 
A MASTER BOLTON DIRECTLY WHAT 

12:50:28.341 --> 12:50:30.452
TRANSPIRED ON THAT CALL AND 
WHETHER THAT PHONE CALL

12:50:34.439 --> 12:50:36.477
INFORMED THE ASSESSMENT THAT MR.
GIULIANI WAS A HAND GRENADE THAT

12:50:36.671 --> 12:50:39.414
WAS GOING TO BLOW EVERYONE UP. 
AND WE CAN ASK MR. BOLTON,

12:50:45.809 --> 12:50:47.238
WHY, WHEN THERE ARE 
APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION 

12:50:47.239 --> 12:50:52.111
COMPANIES IN UKRAINE, SEVERAL 
HUNDRED THOUSAND OF WHICH HAVE 

12:50:52.307 --> 12:50:56.731
BEEN ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS FOCUSED ON ONLY 

12:50:56.888 --> 12:50:58.888
ONE

12:51:00.441 --> 12:51:02.670
. HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING 
ELSE, HE CARED ONLY ABOUT THE 

12:51:02.871 --> 12:51:08.316
COMPANY ON WHICH THE FORMER VICE
PRESIDENT SON HAD BEEN A BOARD 

12:51:08.465 --> 12:51:10.465
MEMBER.

12:51:19.123 --> 12:51:21.158
DO YOU BELIEVE HE WAS CONCERNED 
WITH CORRUPTION? AND ONLY KNEW 

12:51:21.362 --> 12:51:23.362
ABOUT ONE COMPANY? WHEN THERE 
ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THAT 

12:51:23.389 --> 12:51:25.389
WERE ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION?

12:51:28.271 --> 12:51:30.289
ALTHOUGH AMBASSADOR BOLTON DID 
NOT LISTEN IN ON THE JULY 25th 

12:51:30.504 --> 12:51:32.322
CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
PRESIDENT'S ZELINSKI IN WHICH 

12:51:32.323 --> 12:51:36.187
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED THE 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT A FAVOR, THE

12:51:36.389 --> 12:51:41.672
FAVOR TO INVESTIGATE ONE COMPANY
AND JOE BIDEN SON. WE HAVE 

12:51:41.875 --> 12:51:43.906
LEARNED FROM WITNESS TESTIMONY 
THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS 

12:51:44.107 --> 12:51:46.107
OPPOSED TO THE CALL

12:51:49.588 --> 12:51:51.622
IN THE FIRST PLACE WHY? BECAUSE 
HE ACCURATELY PREDICTED IN THE 

12:51:51.824 --> 12:51:55.489
WORDS OF AMBASSADOR TAYLOR, "IT 
SHOULD BE SOME TALK OF 

12:51:55.688 --> 12:51:59.140
INVESTIGATION OR WORST ON THE 
CALL. ALSO WROTE. HE THOUGHT IT 

12:51:59.344 --> 12:52:05.839
WOULD BE A DISASTER. HOW DID 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON ALSO KNOW THAT

12:52:06.054 --> 12:52:10.105
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BRING THIS
UP WHAT MADE HIM SO CONCERNED 

12:52:10.324 --> 12:52:16.405
THAT A CALL WOULD BE A DISASTER?
I THINK WE KNOW. ONLY AMBASSADOR

12:52:16.606 --> 12:52:18.440
BOLTON CAN ANSWER THESE 
QUESTIONS. WE ALSO KNOW, BASED 

12:52:18.441 --> 12:52:22.026
ON EXTENSIVE WEST WITNESS 
TESTIMONY, THAT THROUGHOUT THIS 

12:52:22.178 --> 12:52:26.972
PERIOD, MULTIPLE PEOPLE ON THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF 

12:52:27.172 --> 12:52:31.838
REPORTED CONCERNS TO AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON ABOUT TYING AMERICAN 

12:52:32.253 --> 12:52:34.621
FOREIGN-POLICY TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S DOMESTIC DOMESTIC

12:52:39.971 --> 12:52:42.203
POLITICAL.. AS DR. HILL PUT IT. 
AFTER HE ABRUPTLY ENDED THE JULY

12:52:42.403 --> 12:52:47.284
10th MEETING. THEY ABRUPTLY TOLD
THE UKRAINIANS A WHITE HOUSE 

12:52:47.485 --> 12:52:51.539
MEETING COULD BE SCHEDULED IN 
EXCHANGE FOR THE INVESTIGATION. 

12:52:51.954 --> 12:52:54.911
AMBASSADOR BOLTON SPOKE TO DR. 
HILL AND DIRECTED HIM TO THE

12:53:01.301 --> 12:53:03.301
LEGAL COUNSEL, JOHN EISENBERG. 
AT THE END OF AUGUST, AMBASSADOR

12:53:03.323 --> 12:53:06.457
BOLTON ADVISED AMBASSADOR TELLER
TO SEND A CABLE TO SECRETARY

12:53:15.305 --> 12:53:17.141
POMPEO TO RELATE CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE MILITARY AID. AMBASSADOR 

12:53:17.142 --> 12:53:19.142
BOLTON ALSO ADVISED MR. 
MORRISON, DR. HILL'S SUCCESSOR 

12:53:19.309 --> 12:53:21.309
AS TOP

12:53:24.654 --> 12:53:26.485
UKRAINE OFFICIAL ON THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL, ON TWO 

12:53:26.486 --> 12:53:28.868
DIFFERENT OCCASIONS TO REPORT 
WHAT HE HEARD TO THE NATIONAL 

12:53:29.009 --> 12:53:31.009
SECURITY

12:53:37.656 --> 12:53:39.486
COUNCIL LAWYERS THAT SOUNDED SO 
SUSPICIOUS. ON SEPTEMBER 1st, 

12:53:39.487 --> 12:53:41.306
AMBASSADOR BOLTON DIRECTED MR. 
MORTON TO REPORT TO THIS 

12:53:41.307 --> 12:53:42.737
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
LAWYERS AND EXPLICIT PROPOSAL 

12:53:42.738 --> 12:53:46.994
FROM AMBASSADOR SONDLAND THAT 
COULD HELP THEM MOVE THE AID. 

12:53:47.407 --> 12:53:50.246
THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL WOULD GO 
TO THE MIKE AND AND ELSIE WAS 

12:53:50.461 --> 12:53:56.826
OPENING THE BURISMA 
INVESTIGATION. ON THE SEVENTH

12:54:03.045 --> 12:54:05.045
OF MR. MORRISON INSTRUCTED TO GO
TO THE LAWYERS ANOTHER 

12:54:05.079 --> 12:54:08.730
CONVERSATION AMBASSADOR SONDLAND
HAD. HE CONVEYED IT THEY WOULD 

12:54:08.933 --> 12:54:14.628
NOT RELEASE MILITARY AID AND 
LESS PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WOULD  

12:54:15.030 --> 12:54:18.230
ANNOUNCE THE INVESTIGATIONS 
DEMANDED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE

12:54:18.370 --> 12:54:20.370
ESTIMATE

12:54:23.566 --> 12:54:25.386
INVESTIGATION OF ONE COMPANY 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WAS SO 

12:54:25.387 --> 12:54:27.217
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION IN 
UKRAINE. ONE COMPANY THAT HAD 

12:54:27.218 --> 12:54:31.887
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S SON 
ON THE BOARD. HE JUST HAPPENED 

12:54:32.651 --> 12:54:35.137
TO PICK THAT COMPANY FROM 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO BE 

12:54:35.901 --> 12:54:39.604
CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION. THE 
PRESIDENT ALSO OPPOSED FUNDING 

12:54:40.354 --> 12:54:43.555
FOR CORRUPTION IN THE AID TO 
UKRAINE.

12:54:47.936 --> 12:54:50.173
WHY DID AMBASSADOR BOLTON TELL 
US TO REPORT THESE ISSUES TO THE

12:54:50.371 --> 12:54:52.371
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
LAWYER?

12:54:55.853 --> 12:54:58.449
BUT HE RESPONDED TO THE CONCERNS
OF DR. HILL OR LIEUTENANT 

12:54:58.593 --> 12:55:00.611
COLONEL VINELAND. OR MR. 
MORRISON.

12:55:12.730 --> 12:55:14.753
THIS IS AT THE HEART OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT IN HIS 

12:55:14.953 --> 12:55:18.003
ATTEMPT TO BLOCK THE TESTIMONY. 
WHY WOULD THE PRESIDENT OPPOSE 

12:55:18.205 --> 12:55:22.870
THE TESTIMONY FOR HIS OWN AND 
POINTY. THE NATIONAL SECURITY 

12:55:23.071 --> 12:55:27.899
ADVISOR FOR THE UNITED STATES. 
UNLESS HE KNEW THAT THAT 

12:55:28.044 --> 12:55:30.737
TESTIMONY WOULD BE DAMNING TO 
HIM.

12:55:34.454 --> 12:55:36.454
THOSE ARE OTHER REASONS THE 
PRESIDENT FEARED AMBASSADOR 

12:55:36.586 --> 12:55:41.157
BOLTON'S TESTIMONY. I LIKE TO 
TURN NOW TO AMBASSADOR BOLTON'S 

12:55:41.921 --> 12:55:43.921
KNOWLEDGE AND

12:55:49.287 --> 12:55:50.904
CONCERN ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
LEGAL WITHHOLDING OF THE 

12:55:50.905 --> 12:55:53.139
MILITARY AID TO THE UKRAINE. WE 
ALL KNOW OF COURSE UNDER THE 

12:55:53.340 --> 12:55:56.590
ANTI-IMPALEMENT ACT OF 1974, 
PAST TO PREVENT PRESIDENT NIXON 

12:55:56.790 --> 12:55:58.824
FROM REFUSING TO SPEND MONEY 
APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS, 

12:55:59.591 --> 12:56:01.591
WITHHOLDING MONEY

12:56:04.519 --> 12:56:05.938
APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS IS 
ILLEGAL. NONETHELESS, THE 

12:56:05.939 --> 12:56:07.939
PRESIDENT DID IT FOR OBVIOUS

12:56:10.819 --> 12:56:12.819
CORRUPT MOTIVES. JULY OF LAST 
YEAR AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS WELL 

12:56:13.252 --> 12:56:15.252
AWARE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
ILLEGALLY WITHHOLDING

12:56:21.370 --> 12:56:23.370
SECURITY ASSISTANT TO UKRAINE. 
HE AND HIS SUBORDINATES TRIED TO

12:56:23.404 --> 12:56:25.838
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT TO SECURE
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST IN 

12:56:26.589 --> 12:56:28.589
RELEASE AID.

12:56:32.543 --> 12:56:37.626
INSTEAD OF HOLDING THAT VITAL 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE HOSTAGE TO 

12:56:38.386 --> 12:56:40.386
THE PRESIDENT'S

12:56:42.707 --> 12:56:44.329
PERSONAL POLITICAL AGENDA. 
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF JULY, 

12:56:44.330 --> 12:56:47.183
OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL 
AGENCY MEETINGS, THE NATIONAL 

12:56:47.377 --> 12:56:49.377
SECURITY COUNCIL REPEATEDLY 
DISCUSSED THE UKRAINE

12:56:53.679 --> 12:56:55.107
ASSISTANCE. IS NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISOR AMBASSADOR BOLTON 

12:56:55.108 --> 12:56:59.363
SUPERVISE THAT PROCESS. THESE 
MEETINGS WORK THEIR WAY UP TO 

12:56:59.564 --> 12:57:01.564
THE LEVEL OF CABINET

12:57:04.431 --> 12:57:06.262
DEPUTIES. EVERY AGENCY INVOLVED 
EXCEPT FOR THE OFFICE OF 

12:57:06.263 --> 12:57:10.733
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET REPORTS TO
RELEASING THE AID. MEANWHILE 

12:57:10.931 --> 12:57:15.399
THEY SAID THE POSITION WAS BASED
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXPRESSED 

12:57:15.813 --> 12:57:20.895
ORDERS. WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF
INDIVIDUALS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

12:57:21.096 --> 12:57:24.947
DEFENSE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT 
LEGALITY OF THE FUNDS WHICH WE 

12:57:25.160 --> 12:57:27.160
KNOW IS ILLEGAL. WE NOW HAVE 
EXPLICIT

12:57:33.079 --> 12:57:35.322
RULINGS FROM THE OFFICE WHICH WE
DIDN'T NEED BECAUSE WE KNEW IT 

12:57:35.513 --> 12:57:38.762
THAT'S WHY THE LAW WAS PASSED IN
1974. THE ORDER BY PRESIDENT 

12:57:38.965 --> 12:57:40.996
TRUMP WAS ILLEGAL AND HE WAS 
OBVIOUSLY TOLD THIS AND VIOLATED

12:57:41.196 --> 12:57:46.482
THE IMPOUND AND CONTROL ACT. WE 
ALSO KNOW THE AFTER THE MEETING 

12:57:46.694 --> 12:57:48.694
ON JULY 26, TIM MORRISON TOPPED 
TALKED

12:57:53.797 --> 12:57:55.414
TO AMBASSADOR BOLTON. ACCORDING 
TO MR. MORRISON, AMBASSADOR 

12:57:55.415 --> 12:57:59.897
BOLTON SAID THE ENTIRE CABINET 
RELEASED THE DECREE WANTED TO 

12:58:00.099 --> 12:58:04.763
GET THE ISSUE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHEN DID 

12:58:04.962 --> 12:58:08.013
AMBASSADOR BOLTON FIRST BECOME 
AWARE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

12:58:08.415 --> 12:58:10.750
WITHHOLDING MILITARY AID TO THE 
UKRAINE AND CONDITIONING THE ACE

12:58:13.699 --> 12:58:15.730
RELEASE OF THE AID ON POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATION? WHAT WAS HE TOLD 

12:58:16.480 --> 12:58:18.980
THE REASON? WHAT ELSE DID HE 
LEARN ABOUT THE PRESENCE 

12:58:19.729 --> 12:58:23.245
ACTIONS? AGAIN, ONLY AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON CAN ANSWER THESE 

12:58:23.447 --> 12:58:28.931
QUESTIONS. AND AGAIN WE MUST 
PRESUME THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

12:58:29.353 --> 12:58:34.776
DESPERATE FOR US TO NOT HEAR 
THOSE ANSWERS. I HOPE NOT TOO 

12:58:34.918 --> 12:58:37.820
MANY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY ARE 
DESPERATE

12:58:44.980 --> 12:58:47.214
TO MAKE SURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
DON'T HEAR THE SAME ANSWERS. WE 

12:58:47.430 --> 12:58:48.846
KNOW AMBASSADOR BOLTON TRIED 
WITHOUT SUCCESS THROUGHOUT 

12:58:48.847 --> 12:58:51.841
AUGUST TO PERSUADE THE PRESIDENT
THAT THE A TO UKRAINE HAD TO BE 

12:58:51.984 --> 12:58:56.149
RELEASED BECAUSE THAT WAS IN 
AMERICA'S BEST INTEREST AND 

12:58:56.364 --> 12:58:58.364
NECESSARY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.
MID AUGUST, WE KNOW THAT 

12:58:58.932 --> 12:59:03.420
LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN  
RECOMMENDED

12:59:09.964 --> 12:59:11.997
IT BE LIFTED BASED ON THE 
CONSENSUS VIEWS OF THE ENTIRE 

12:59:12.199 --> 12:59:14.199
CABINET. OF THE MEMO WAS GIVEN 
TO AMBASSADOR BOLTON WHO 

12:59:14.230 --> 12:59:17.213
SUBSEQUENTLY HAD A DIRECT, 
ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION WITH THE

12:59:17.358 --> 12:59:19.358
PRESIDENT IN WHICH HE TRIED BUT

12:59:26.628 --> 12:59:28.246
FAILED TO CONVINCE HIM TO 
RELEASE THE HOLD. 

12:59:28.247 --> 12:59:30.247
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
HAD A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH 

12:59:30.279 --> 12:59:32.311
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN LATE AUGUST 
2019. BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT 

12:59:32.515 --> 12:59:35.159
YET READY TO IMPROVE THE 
RELEASE? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? 

12:59:36.124 --> 12:59:41.659
YES 266, 268. I'M ASKING YOU DID
THAT HAPPEN OR DID IT NOT ASK 

12:59:41.860 --> 12:59:43.860
EAGLE SIR I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

12:59:50.325 --> 12:59:52.325
OKAY,

12:59:55.057 --> 12:59:57.057
YES SIR, I SEE. 
&gt;&gt; YOU TESTIFIED TO THAT WHAT 

12:59:57.092 --> 13:00:00.337
WAS THE OUTCOME OF THAT MEETING 
BETWEEN AMBASSADOR BOLTON AND 

13:00:00.553 --> 13:00:02.553
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
&gt;&gt; AMBASSADOR BOLTON DID NOT YET

13:00:04.404 --> 13:00:06.035
BELIEVE HE WAS READY TO APPROVE 
THE ASSISTANCE. 

13:00:06.036 --> 13:00:11.107
&gt;&gt; WAS THERE ONGOING HOLD 
RELEASED FROM THIS MEETING? 

13:00:11.108 --> 13:00:14.905
&gt;&gt; NO SIR. 
&gt;&gt; I AUGUST 30th, OMB INFORMED 

13:00:15.730 --> 13:00:22.689
DOD THERE WAS "CLEAR DIRECTION 
TO CONTINUE TO HOLD" WHAT 

13:00:23.650 --> 13:00:25.650
RATIONALE DID THEY GIVE 
PRESIDENT

13:00:30.405 --> 13:00:34.055
AND UNDER OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS
TO REFUSE TO RELEASE THE AID? 

13:00:34.472 --> 13:00:36.305
DID THEY REFLECT THE BEST 
INTERESTS OF OUR NATIONAL 

13:00:36.306 --> 13:00:38.630
SECURITY OR PRESIDENT'S PRO PER 
PERSONAL POLITICAL

13:00:46.257 --> 13:00:48.257
INTEREST. ONLY AMBASSADOR BOLTON
COULDN'T TELL US THE ANSWER. A 

13:00:48.279 --> 13:00:50.720
FAIR TRIAL OF THIS BODY WOULD 
ENSURE THAT HE TESTIFY. THE 

13:00:50.921 --> 13:00:52.754
PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT YOU TO 
HEAR AMBASSADOR BOLTON'S 

13:00:52.755 --> 13:00:57.224
TESTIMONY. WHY IS THAT? FOR ALL 
THE OBVIOUS REASONS I STATED. OF

13:00:57.422 --> 13:01:02.908
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS THAT 
UKRAINE IS IN THE INTEREST OF 

13:01:03.109 --> 13:01:05.144
THE NATIONAL SECURITY. IF THAT 
IS TRUE WHY WOULD HE OPPOSE 

13:01:05.344 --> 13:01:07.777
TESTIMONY FROM HIS OWN FORMER 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR. MAKE 

13:01:08.540 --> 13:01:14.479
NO MISTAKE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 
NO LEGAL GROUNDS TO BLOCK THE 

13:01:14.894 --> 13:01:17.464
TESTIMONY IN THIS TRIAL. 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS NOT US 

13:01:17.605 --> 13:01:23.151
TELL TO COVER UP HIS OWN 
CONDUCT. IT IS A QUALIFIED 

13:01:23.298 --> 13:01:29.919
PRIVILEGE. TO PROTECT SENIOR 
FUNCTIONS. EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE 

13:01:30.118 --> 13:01:32.447
IS A SHIELD NOT A SWORD. IT 
CANNOT BLOCK UP

13:01:37.637 --> 13:01:39.671
WITNESS WILLING TO TESTIFY AS 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON SAID HE IS. AS

13:01:39.871 --> 13:01:41.908
WE KNOW FROM THE NIXON CASE IN 
WATERGATE, THE PRIVILEGE DOES 

13:01:42.108 --> 13:01:48.003
NOT HAVE THIS PACIFIC EVIDENCE 
OF WRONGDOING. NIXON'S ATTEMPT 

13:01:48.205 --> 13:01:53.488
TO USE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO 
CONCEAL INCRIMINATING 

13:01:53.892 --> 13:01:57.753
TAPE-RECORDING. ALL OF THIS 
EFFORT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP MUST 

13:01:57.958 --> 13:02:04.198
ALSO FAIL. THE PRESIDENT ALLIES 
RELIES ON THE THEORY OF ABSOLUTE

13:02:04.345 --> 13:02:08.221
IMMUNITY. HE CAN ORDER ANYBODY 
IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO

13:02:12.988 --> 13:02:14.988
NOT TESTIFY IN THE HOUSE OR THE 
SENATE. OBVIOUSLY IT'S 

13:02:15.021 --> 13:02:17.021
RIDICULOUS AND FLATLY REJECTED 
BY EVERY FEDERAL COURT TO 

13:02:17.040 --> 13:02:19.040
CONSIDER THE IDEA. EMBARRASSING

13:02:23.754 --> 13:02:25.573
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL WOULD TALK 
ABOUT THIS TODAY. EVEN IF 

13:02:25.574 --> 13:02:27.574
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASSERTS THAT 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON IS IMMUNE TO 

13:02:27.806 --> 13:02:30.791
COMPELLED TESTIMONY, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS NO AUTHORITY TO 

13:02:30.935 --> 13:02:32.935
BLOCK. AS ONE

13:02:38.374 --> 13:02:40.374
EXPLAINED PRESIDENTS ARE NOT 
KINGS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE 

13:02:40.410 --> 13:02:45.075
SUBJECTS WHOSE DESTINY THEY ARE 
ENTITLED TO CONTROL. THIS BODY 

13:02:45.479 --> 13:02:47.926
SHOULD NOT ACT AS IF PRESIDENT 
IS KING. WE WILL SEE WITH THE 

13:02:48.126 --> 13:02:52.482
NEXT VOTE ON THIS QUESTION. 
WHETHER THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY

13:02:55.192 --> 13:03:01.526
WANT TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT 
AGAINST ALL INVESTIGATION 

13:03:01.941 --> 13:03:03.941
AGAINST ALL SUSPICION AGAINST 
ANY CRIMES OR NOT.

13:03:08.844 --> 13:03:11.236
THE FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION 
WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT ABUSE 

13:03:11.383 --> 13:03:13.608
OF POWER WHEN IT AFFECTS 
NATIONAL SECURITY.

13:03:24.479 --> 13:03:26.109
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BEEN 
IMPEACHED FOR PLACING HIS 

13:03:26.110 --> 13:03:27.929
POLITICAL INTEREST AHEAD OF OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY. IS IMPERATIVE

13:03:27.930 --> 13:03:29.763
WE HEAR FROM THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR WHO WITNESSED 

13:03:29.764 --> 13:03:32.197
THE SCHEME FROM START TO FINISH.
TO BE CLEAR THE RECORD AS IT 

13:03:32.410 --> 13:03:34.229
STANDS FULLY SUPPORTS BOTH 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. IT IS 

13:03:34.230 --> 13:03:36.764
BEYOND ARGUMENT THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP MOUNTED A SUSTAINED

13:03:40.531 --> 13:03:42.531
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN TO BENEFIT HIM
POLITICALLY AND THEN TRIED TO 

13:03:42.564 --> 13:03:46.778
COVER IT UP. THE PRESIDENT DOES 
NOT SERIOUSLY DENY ANY OF THESE 

13:03:46.933 --> 13:03:48.933
FACTS.

13:03:51.297 --> 13:03:53.530
THE ONLY QUESTION LEFT IS THIS, 
WHY IS THE PRESIDENT SO INTENT 

13:03:53.736 --> 13:03:55.565
ON CONCEALING THE EVIDENCE AND 
BLOCKING ALL DOCUMENTS AND 

13:03:55.566 --> 13:03:58.705
TESTIMONY HERE TODAY? ONLY 
GUILTY PEOPLE TRY TO HIDE

13:04:02.263 --> 13:04:06.129
THE EVIDENCE. OF COURSE, ALL OF 
THIS IS RELEVANT. ONLY THIS YEAR

13:04:06.328 --> 13:04:11.764
TODAY IS A FAIR TRIAL. ONLY THE 
SENATE SITTING AS AN IMPARTIAL 

13:04:11.906 --> 13:04:17.498
JURY, DO NOT WORK WITH THE 
ACCUSED TO CONCEAL THE EVIDENCE 

13:04:17.901 --> 13:04:19.901
FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE 
CANNOT BE SURPRISED IF THE 

13:04:19.931 --> 13:04:21.931
PRESENT OBJECTS TO CALLING 
WITNESSES TO

13:04:29.693 --> 13:04:32.533
PROVE HIS GUILT THAT IS WHO HE 
IS. HE DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE 

13:04:32.733 --> 13:04:34.762
THE EVIDENCE HOW HE BETRAYED IS 
OFFICE AND ASK A FOREIGN 

13:04:34.964 --> 13:04:36.964
GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE IN OUR 
ELECTION. WE SHOULD BE SURPRISED

13:04:36.998 --> 13:04:41.464
THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE, THE LATEST DELIBERATIVE 

13:04:41.677 --> 13:04:43.911
BODY IN THE WORLD, WE ARE 
EXPECTED TO PUT OUR OATH OF 

13:04:44.112 --> 13:04:46.548
OFFICE AHEAD OF THE POLITICAL 
EXPEDIENTS WHERE WE ARE EXPECTED

13:04:46.750 --> 13:04:49.398
TO BE HONEST WHERE WE ARE 
EXPECTED TO PROTECT THE INTEREST

13:04:49.596 --> 13:04:51.596
OF THE AMERICAN

13:04:54.665 --> 13:04:56.665
PEOPLE WE SHOULD BE SURPRISED, 
SHOCKED THAT ANY SENATOR WOULD 

13:04:56.698 --> 13:04:59.292
VOTE TO BLOCK THIS WITNESS OR 
ANY RELEVANT WITNESS IT WOULD 

13:04:59.432 --> 13:05:01.779
SHED ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S OBVIOUS MISCONDUCT. 

13:05:01.982 --> 13:05:08.618
THE PRESIDENT IS ON TRIAL IN THE
SENATE BUT THE SENATE IS ON 

13:05:08.770 --> 13:05:13.556
TRIAL IN THE EYES OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. WILL YOU VOTE 

13:05:13.769 --> 13:05:15.802
TO ALLOW THE EVIDENCE OR BETRAY 
YOUR PLEDGE TO BE IMPARTIAL 

13:05:16.003 --> 13:05:20.869
JURY. WILL YOU BRING AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON HERE. WOULD YOU PERMIT 

13:05:21.287 --> 13:05:25.043
THE ENTIRE CONDUCT OR WOULD YOU 
CHOOSE TO BE COMPLICIT

13:05:29.403 --> 13:05:32.052
IN THE PRESIDENT'S COVER-UP? SO 
FAR, I'M SAD TO SAY I SEE A LOT 

13:05:32.252 --> 13:05:36.464
OF SENATORS VOTING FOR A 
COVER-UP, VOTING TO DENY 

13:05:36.606 --> 13:05:40.574
WITNESSES, ABSOLUTELY 
INDEFENSIBLE. AWFULLY USUALLY A 

13:05:41.324 --> 13:05:47.032
TREACHEROUS VOTE. A VOTE AGAINST
AN HONEST CONSIDERATION OF THE 

13:05:47.178 --> 13:05:49.178
EVIDENCE

13:05:51.338 --> 13:05:53.932
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. A VOTE 
AGAINST AN HONEST TRIAL. A VOTE 

13:05:54.076 --> 13:05:56.622
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. A 
REAL TRIAL WE KNOW HAS 

13:05:56.822 --> 13:06:00.693
WITNESSES. WE URGE YOU TO DO 
YOUR DUTY, ADMIT A FAIR TRIAL. 

13:06:00.887 --> 13:06:03.830
CALL THE WITNESSES. THEY MUST BE
PERMITTED

13:06:07.191 --> 13:06:09.573
, THAT'S ELEMENTARY AND AMERICAN
JUSTICE. EITHER YOU WANT THE 

13:06:09.722 --> 13:06:14.089
TRUTH, OR YOU AND YOU MUST 
PERMIT THE WITNESSES OR YOU WANT

13:06:14.290 --> 13:06:19.308
A SHAMEFUL COVER-UP. HISTORY 
WILL JUDGE. AND SO WILL BE 

13:06:19.452 --> 13:06:21.452
ELECTRIC.

13:06:29.057 --> 13:06:34.003
MR. PALLONE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. 

13:06:34.205 --> 13:06:43.953
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. WE CAME 
HERE TODAY. TO ADDRESS THE FALSE

13:06:44.154 --> 13:06:46.671
CASE BROUGHT TO YOU. BY THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS.

13:06:51.874 --> 13:06:53.874
WE HAVE BEEN RESPECTFUL

13:07:02.236 --> 13:07:07.521
WE'VE MADE OUR ARGUMENTS TO YOU 
AND YOU DON'T DESERVE AND WE 

13:07:07.722 --> 13:07:11.120
DON'T DESERVE WHAT JUST 
HAPPENED. MR. NADLER

13:07:14.650 --> 13:07:19.293
CAME UP HERE AND MADE FALSE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST OUR TEAM, HE

13:07:20.043 --> 13:07:25.751
MADE FALSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
ALL OF YOU, HE ACCUSED YOU OF A 

13:07:25.894 --> 13:07:31.176
COVER-UP. HE'S BEEN MAKING FALSE
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A PRESIDENT.

13:07:35.339 --> 13:07:39.204
THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE 
EMBARRASSED, MR. NADLER, IS YOU 

13:07:39.405 --> 13:07:43.607
FOR THE WAY YOU HAVE ADDRESSED 
THIS BODY. THIS IS UNITED STATES

13:07:43.747 --> 13:07:51.073
SENATE. YOU ARE NOT IN CHARGE 
HERE. NOW LET ME ADDRESS

13:07:55.461 --> 13:08:01.540
THE ISSUE OF MR. BOLTON, I'VE 
ADDRESSED IT BEFORE. THEY DON'T 

13:08:01.753 --> 13:08:05.606
TELL YOU THAT THEY DID NOT 
BOTHER TO CALL MR. BOLTON 

13:08:06.557 --> 13:08:15.155
THEMSELVES. THEY DIDN'T SEE OR 
SUBPOENA HIM. MR. COOPER WROTE 

13:08:15.557 --> 13:08:20.035
THEM A LETTER HE SAID VERY 
CLEARLY OF THE HOUSE CHOOSES NOT

13:08:20.235 --> 13:08:23.022
TO PURSUE THE THROUGH SUBPOENA

13:08:29.171 --> 13:08:31.002
COPPERMINE AND AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON, LET THE RECORD BE CLEAR,

13:08:31.003 --> 13:08:34.654
THAT IS A HOUSES DECISION. AND 
THEY DID NOT PURSUE AMBASSADOR 

13:08:34.855 --> 13:08:38.212
BOLTON AND THEY WITHDREW THIS UP
SUBPOENA TO MR. KUPPER MEN.

13:08:43.588 --> 13:08:46.029
AND FOR THEM TO COME HERE NOW 
AND DEMAND THAT BEFORE WE EVEN 

13:08:46.242 --> 13:08:48.242
START THE ARGUMENT,

13:08:53.769 --> 13:08:55.769
THEY ASK YOU

13:08:59.663 --> 13:09:02.652
OF SOMETHING THEY REFUSED TO DO 
FOR THEMSELVES AND ASK YOU FOR A

13:09:02.793 --> 13:09:04.793
COVER-UP

13:09:06.993 --> 13:09:08.827
THAT THEY DON'T DO IT. IT'S 
RIDICULOUS TALK ABOUT 

13:09:08.828 --> 13:09:11.203
OUT-OF-CONTROL GOVERNMENT. LET 
ME READ YOU A QUOTE. FROM MR. 

13:09:11.342 --> 13:09:18.745
NADLER. NOT SO LONG AGO. THE 
EFFECT OF IMPEACHMENT IS TO 

13:09:18.891 --> 13:09:23.277
OVERTURN THE POPULAR WILL OF THE
VOTERS. THERE MUST NEVER BE A 

13:09:24.038 --> 13:09:28.771
NARROWLY VOTED IMPEACHMENT OR AN
IMPEACHMENT SUPPORTED BY ONE OF 

13:09:29.538 --> 13:09:35.080
OUR POLITICAL PARTIES AND 
IMPOSED BY THE OTHER. SUCH AN 

13:09:35.486 --> 13:09:37.486
IMPEACHMENT WOULD PRODUCE 
DIVISIVENESS

13:09:41.795 --> 13:09:44.031
AND BITTERNESS IN OUR POLITICS 
FOR YEARS TO COME. AND WILL CALL

13:09:44.433 --> 13:09:46.503
INTO QUESTION. THE VERY 
LEGITIMACY OF OUR POLITICAL 

13:09:47.428 --> 13:09:54.000
INSTITUTION. YOU'VE JUST SEEN IT
FOR YOURSELF. WHAT HAPPENED MR. 

13:09:54.201 --> 13:10:01.477
NADLER? WHAT HAPPENED? THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE PAY THEIR 

13:10:01.629 --> 13:10:03.629
SALARY.

13:10:06.622 --> 13:10:14.969
AND THEY ARE HERE TO TAKE AWAY 
THEIR VOTE. THEY ARE HERE TO 

13:10:15.375 --> 13:10:21.962
TAKE AWAY THEIR VOICE. THEY HAVE
COME HERE AND THEY HAVE ATTACKED

13:10:23.105 --> 13:10:27.432
EVERY INSTITUTION OF OUR 
GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE ATTACKED 

13:10:28.143 --> 13:10:35.310
THE PRESIDENT THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH, THEY HAVE ATTACKED THE 

13:10:35.525 --> 13:10:37.549
JUDICIAL BRANCH. THEY SAY THEY 
DON'T HAVE TIME FOR COURT. THEY 

13:10:37.765 --> 13:10:41.907
HAVE ATTACKED THE UNITED STATE 
SENATE REPEATEDLY.

13:10:46.715 --> 13:10:49.868
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE BRING THIS 
POWER TRIP IN FOR A LANDING.

13:10:57.838 --> 13:11:05.789
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A MAN OF HIS 
WORD. HE MADE PROMISES TO THE 

13:11:05.932 --> 13:11:12.556
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HE DELIVERED
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

13:11:12.960 --> 13:11:19.684
AND THEY COME HERE AND SAY WITH 
NO EVIDENCE SPENDING THE DAY 

13:11:20.087 --> 13:11:24.305
COMPLAINING THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE
THEIR CASE. ATTACKING A 

13:11:24.449 --> 13:11:26.449
RESOLUTION

13:11:28.633 --> 13:11:31.073
THAT HAD 100% SUPPORT IN THIS 
BODY AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE HERE

13:11:31.836 --> 13:11:39.569
SUPPORTED IT AT THE TIME. IT'S A
FARCE. AND IT SHOULD END. MR. 

13:11:39.715 --> 13:11:41.715
NADLER,

13:11:44.714 --> 13:11:46.750
YOU OWE AN APOLOGY TO THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

13:11:46.953 --> 13:11:53.664
AND HIS FAMILY. YOU OWE AN 
APOLOGY TO THE SENATE BUT MOST 

13:11:54.424 --> 13:12:00.780
OF ALL, YOU OWE AN APOLOGY TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I YIELD THE

13:12:00.993 --> 13:12:10.093
REMAINDER OF MY TIME. TO MR. --.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 

13:12:10.094 --> 13:12:16.660
&gt;&gt; MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. 
CHAIRMAN NADLER TALKED ABOUT 

13:12:17.412 --> 13:12:22.770
TREACHEROUS ABOUT 12 A.M. THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY 

13:12:22.968 --> 13:12:26.985
COMMITTEE OF THIS BODY ON THE 
FLOOR OF THE SENATE SAID 

13:12:27.125 --> 13:12:32.871
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND OTHER 
NONSENSE. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A

13:12:33.010 --> 13:12:41.093
MOMENT. EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 
OTHER NONSENSE. MR. NADLER IT IS

13:12:41.854 --> 13:12:43.854
NOT NONSENSE.

13:12:46.981 --> 13:12:48.981
THESE ARE PRIVILEGES RECOGNIZED 
BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 

13:12:49.575 --> 13:12:54.054
UNITED STATES. AND TO SHRED THE 
CONSTITUTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE

13:12:54.202 --> 13:13:00.914
SENATE, TO SERVE WHAT PURPOSE? 
THE SENATE IS NOT ON TRIAL.

13:13:06.717 --> 13:13:09.317
THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW 
IT.

13:13:12.829 --> 13:13:15.815
LOOK WHAT WE'VE DEALT WITH FOR 
THE LAST, NOW, 13 HOURS.

13:13:20.561 --> 13:13:25.237
AND WE ARE HOPEFULLY CLOSING THE
PROCEEDINGS BUT NOT ON A VERY 

13:13:26.006 --> 13:13:32.564
HIGH NOTE. ONLY GUILTY PEOPLE 
TRY TO HIDE EVIDENCE SO I GUESS 

13:13:32.765 --> 13:13:35.019
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA INSTRUCTED 
HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO NOT GIVE

13:13:35.219 --> 13:13:40.714
INFORMATION, HE WAS GUILTY OF A 
CRIME. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS 

13:13:41.470 --> 13:13:48.386
MR. NADLER? IS THAT THE WAY YOU 
VIEW THE UNITED STATES 

13:13:48.533 --> 13:13:54.740
CONSTITUTION? IS THAT'S NOT THE 
WAY IT WAS WRITTEN. THAT'S NOT 

13:13:54.940 --> 13:13:56.978
THE WAY IT WAS INTERPRETED. 
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE AMERICAN 

13:13:57.174 --> 13:14:01.849
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE. I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT'S TREACHEROUS. 

13:14:02.061 --> 13:14:04.297
COME TO THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE 
AND SAY EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 

13:14:04.497 --> 13:14:10.135
OTHER NONSENSE. YIELD THE REST. 
&gt;&gt; MANAGERS HAVE 27 MINUTES 

13:14:10.277 --> 13:14:12.277
REMAINING.

13:14:20.962 --> 13:14:25.112
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, MEMBERS OF 
THE SENATE. PRESIDENTS COUNCIL

13:14:31.935 --> 13:14:34.586
NO STANDING TO TALK ABOUT LINE. 
HE TOLD THE BODY TOLD AMERICAN 

13:14:35.347 --> 13:14:41.296
PEOPLE REPEATEDLY THAT THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES REFUSED TO 

13:14:41.493 --> 13:14:44.839
ALLOW THE PRESIDENT DUE PROCESS.
I TOLD YOU

13:14:50.370 --> 13:15:00.194
PUBLIC DOCUMENT. DUE PROCESS. 
OFFERING WITNESSES, OFFERING 

13:15:00.596 --> 13:15:05.883
CROSS EXAMINATION. A FEW DAYS 
LATER WE RECEIVE A LETTER ON 

13:15:06.102 --> 13:15:08.117
WHITE HOUSE STATIONERY THAT SAID
NO, WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN 

13:15:08.331 --> 13:15:14.922
APPEARING. ON ONE HAND, THEY ARE
LYING, THE HOUSE IS CONDEMNED

13:15:19.711 --> 13:15:21.748
BY THE PRESIDENT FOR NOT GIVING 
HIM DUE PROCESS AFTER THEY 

13:15:21.954 --> 13:15:25.291
REJECTED THE OFFER OF DUE 
PROCESS. THAT LETTER REJECTING 

13:15:25.814 --> 13:15:27.814
IT WAS DECEMBER 1st.

13:15:30.888 --> 13:15:35.257
THE PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL SAID THE
HOUSE SHOULD HAVE

13:15:39.225 --> 13:15:41.874
ISSUED SUBPOENAS, WE DID ISSUE 
SUBPOENAS. THE PRESIDENT YOU MAY

13:15:42.074 --> 13:15:48.578
RECALL, SHOULD RECALL, HE WOULD 
OPPOSE ALL SUBPOENAS AND HE DID.

13:15:48.784 --> 13:15:53.249
SO MANY OF THOSE SUBPOENAS ARE 
STILL BEING FOUGHT IN COURT. 

13:15:53.449 --> 13:16:00.570
SUBPOENAS ISSUED LAST APRIL. SO 
THAT'S ALSO UNTRUE. AND IT'S A 

13:16:00.771 --> 13:16:03.714
HECK OF A NERVE TO CRITICIZE THE
HOUSE

13:16:07.479 --> 13:16:09.514
FOR NOT ISSUING SUPREME IT'S 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD

13:16:10.276 --> 13:16:12.276
OPPOSE ALL

13:16:14.798 --> 13:16:16.798
SUBPOENAS AND WE ISSUED 
SUBPOENAS AND HE POSES ALL OF 

13:16:16.833 --> 13:16:20.286
THEM AND IT IS TIED UP IN COURT.
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS, AND MOST 

13:16:20.487 --> 13:16:22.487
MEMBERS OF THE BODY NO BETTER,

13:16:26.789 --> 13:16:28.789
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE LIMITED 
PRIVILEGE.

13:16:32.696 --> 13:16:37.465
NOT AS A SHIELD AS WRONG DOING 
AS THE SUPREME COURT

13:16:42.042 --> 13:16:44.771
THE PRESENT CLAIMS ABSOLUTELY 
IMMUNITY.

13:16:48.351 --> 13:16:53.781
PRESIDENT WROTE THOSE LETTERS 
SAYING NOBODY HE WANTS TO 

13:16:53.921 --> 13:16:59.923
TESTIFY AND THEY HAVE THE NERVE 
AND THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF THE 

13:17:00.338 --> 13:17:02.338
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE 
HOUSE

13:17:05.827 --> 13:17:07.647
AND THE SENATE. AMERICANS PEOPLE
REPRESENTATIVE THROUGH THEM AND 

13:17:07.648 --> 13:17:11.465
ASSERTION OF KINGLY PREROGATIVE 
ONLY THE PRESIDENT, ONLY THE 

13:17:11.614 --> 13:17:13.614
PRESIDENT HAS RIGHTS

13:17:17.006 --> 13:17:18.636
AND PEOPLE REPRESENTATIVE IN 
CONGRESS CANNOT GET INFORMATION 

13:17:18.637 --> 13:17:24.930
FROM THE EXECUTIVE RANCH AT ALL?
THIS BODY AS COMMITTEES, IT'S A 

13:17:25.132 --> 13:17:30.831
200 YEAR RECORD OF ISSUING 
SUBPOENAS. OF HAVING THE 

13:17:31.032 --> 13:17:34.840
ADMINISTRATION OF THE DAY 
TESTIFY. OF SOMETIMES HAVING 

13:17:34.983 --> 13:17:41.145
SUBPOENAS. BUT NO PRESIDENT HAS 
EVER CLAIMED THE RIGHT TO

13:17:44.657 --> 13:17:47.375
STONEWALL CONGRESS ON 
EVERYTHING... CONGRESS SAYS

13:17:55.017 --> 13:17:57.255
NO RIGHT TO GET INFORMATION TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NO RIGHT TO

13:17:57.455 --> 13:18:00.049
GET INFORMATION IMPACT ARTICLE 2
OF THE IMPEACHMENT THAT WE HAVE 

13:18:00.189 --> 13:18:07.509
VOTED. IT IS BEYOND BELIEF THAT 
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS

13:18:13.519 --> 13:18:15.953
AND ALL GOOGLE POWERS, I CAN DO 
WHATEVER I WANT UNDER ARTICLE 2 

13:18:16.155 --> 13:18:22.394
AND THEN ASK ON THAT. DEFIES 
EVERYTHING. DEFIES THE LAW TO 

13:18:22.541 --> 13:18:28.559
WITHHOLD AID FROM UKRAINE. 
DEFIES THE LAW IN DOZENS OF 

13:18:28.961 --> 13:18:31.700
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND LIES 
ABOUT HER ALL THE TIME. AND SENT

13:18:33.444 --> 13:18:37.714
MR. PALLONE HERE TO LIE ABOUT 
IT. THESE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE. 

13:18:38.676 --> 13:18:40.676
UNDENIABLE. I RESERVE

13:18:56.809 --> 13:19:01.480
ONCE AGAIN IT WAS COMPLAINED 
THAT WE DID NOT REQUEST JOHN 

13:19:01.705 --> 13:19:06.976
BOLTON TO TESTIFY. WE DID 
REQUEST HIS TESTIMONY AND HE WAS

13:19:07.742 --> 13:19:12.662
A NO-SHOW. THE ANSWER WAS YOU 
GIVE US A SUBPOENA AND WE WILL 

13:19:13.426 --> 13:19:19.449
SUE YOU AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT 
MR. BONES ATTORNEY DID WITH DR.

13:19:23.236 --> 13:19:25.614
KUPPER MEN. THERE WAS NO 
WILLINGNESS FOR MR. BOLTON TO 

13:19:25.792 --> 13:19:31.761
TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE HE
SAID HE WOULD SUE US. WAS A 

13:19:31.966 --> 13:19:34.348
PROBLEM WITH SUING US? THEY'RE 
JUST DEPARTMENT ARGUING THAT 

13:19:34.492 --> 13:19:40.857
VERY CASE INVOLVING DR. KUPPER 
MEN THEY CAN'T SUE, DR. KUPPER 

13:19:41.006 --> 13:19:45.679
MEN CANNOT SUE THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONGRESS.

13:19:46.598 --> 13:19:51.065
CONGRESS IS TAKEN THE SAME 
POSITION ADMINISTRATION HAS 

13:19:51.266 --> 13:19:55.134
TAKEN APPARENTLY NOT THE SAME 
THAT THE LAWYERS ARE TAKING. HIS

13:19:55.895 --> 13:20:00.763
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. WE 
SUBPOENAED DON McGANN IN APRIL 

13:20:00.904 --> 13:20:10.521
OF 2019. IS JANUARY OF 2020. WE 
STILL DON'T HAVE A DECISION FROM

13:20:13.825 --> 13:20:17.678
A FINAL DECISION FROM THE COURT 
REQUIRING HIM TO TESTIFY. IN A 

13:20:17.879 --> 13:20:22.554
COUPLE MONTHS IT WILL BE ONE 
YEAR SINCE WE ISSUED THAT 

13:20:22.769 --> 13:20:24.789
SUBPOENA. THE PRESIDENT WOULD 
LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN FOR US TO

13:20:25.003 --> 13:20:27.839
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONE-YEAR OR 
TWO-YEAR OR THREE YEARS OF 

13:20:28.040 --> 13:20:31.907
LITIGATION TO GET A WITNESS TO 
COME BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE 

13:20:32.666 --> 13:20:36.940
PROBLEM IS, THE PRESIDENT IS 
TRYING TO CHEAT IN THIS 

13:20:37.081 --> 13:20:42.065
ELECTION. WE DON'T HAVE THE 
LUXURY OF WAITING ONE-YEAR OR 

13:20:42.273 --> 13:20:46.133
TWO-YEAR OR THREE YEARS WHEN THE
VERY OBJECT OF THIS SCHEME WAS 

13:20:46.336 --> 13:20:48.774
TO CHEAT IN THE NEXT ELECTION, 
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT THREAT HAS 

13:20:48.970 --> 13:20:51.821
GONE AWAY. JUST LAST MONTH THE 
PRESIDENT LAWYER IN UKRAINE 

13:20:52.023 --> 13:20:54.023
STILL TRYING TO

13:21:02.993 --> 13:21:05.029
SMEAR HIS OPPONENT STILL TRYING 
TO GET UKRAINE TO INTERFERE IN 

13:21:05.227 --> 13:21:06.859
THE ELECTION. EVEN WHILE THE 
IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION WAS 

13:21:06.860 --> 13:21:09.903
GOING ON HE WAS ASKED WHAT DID 
YOU WANT WITH THAT CALL, WELL 

13:21:10.112 --> 13:21:11.931
FOR BEING HONEST ABOUT IT, 
ZELINSKI SHOULD DO THAT 

13:21:11.932 --> 13:21:13.932
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BIDENS. 
HE HAS NOT STOPPED ASKING THEM 

13:21:14.526 --> 13:21:16.526
TO INTERFERE.

13:21:21.080 --> 13:21:23.113
YOU THINK THE UKRAINIANS HAVE 
ANY DOUBT ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS? 

13:21:23.314 --> 13:21:25.314
ONE OF THE WITNESSES, DAVID 
HOLMES TESTIFIED ABOUT THE 

13:21:25.686 --> 13:21:27.686
PRESSURE UKRAINE

13:21:31.234 --> 13:21:33.672
FEELS. HE MADE A VERY IMPORTANT 
POINT. IT IS NOT OVER. IT'S NOT 

13:21:33.887 --> 13:21:35.887
LIKE THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING 
ELSE FROM THE UNITED STATES. 

13:21:36.456 --> 13:21:42.168
THIS PRESSURE FOR UKRAINE GOES 
ON TO THIS DAY. THE PRESIDENT'S 

13:21:42.312 --> 13:21:47.905
LAWYER CONTINUES THIS SCHEME AS 
WE SPEAK INVITING OTHER NATIONS 

13:21:48.106 --> 13:21:50.106
TO ALSO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN

13:21:53.180 --> 13:21:55.896
OUR ELECTION. TO CHINA HE WANTS 
NOW TO INVESTIGATE THE BIDENS. 

13:21:56.233 --> 13:21:58.233
THIS IS NO INTANGIBLE THREAT TO 
OUR

13:22:02.529 --> 13:22:04.361
ELECTIONS. WITHIN THE LAST 
COUPLE WEEKS IS BEEN REPORTED 

13:22:04.362 --> 13:22:06.800
THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE TRIED TO 
HACK BURISMA WHY DO YOU THINK 

13:22:06.998 --> 13:22:11.267
THEY ARE HACKING BURISMA? 
BECAUSE CHAIRMAN NADLER SAYS 

13:22:11.467 --> 13:22:16.349
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE INTERESTED
IN THIS ONE COMPANY OUT OF 

13:22:16.550 --> 13:22:22.236
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
COMPANIES. THE SAME COMPANY THE 

13:22:22.441 --> 13:22:26.101
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
SMEAR JOE BIDEN HAPPENS TO BE 

13:22:26.502 --> 13:22:28.502
THE COMPANY RUSSIANS ARE HACKING

13:22:31.591 --> 13:22:34.225
. WHY WOULD THE RUSSIAN DO THAT?
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE LAST 

13:22:34.426 --> 13:22:37.476
ELECTION, THE RUSSIANS HACKED 
THE DNC. AND THEY STARTED TO 

13:22:37.678 --> 13:22:43.178
LEAK CAMPAIGN DOCUMENTS IN A 
DRIP, DRIP, DRIP. THE PRESIDENT 

13:22:43.376 --> 13:22:48.070
WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY OVER 100 
TIMES THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS 

13:22:48.249 --> 13:22:53.127
DESPITE THOSE RUSSIAN HACK 
DOCUMENTS AND NOW THE RUSSIANS 

13:22:53.329 --> 13:22:56.916
ARE ADDED AGAIN. THIS IS NO 
LOOSER A THREAT TO INDEPENDENT 

13:22:57.094 --> 13:22:59.094
ELECTIONS.

13:23:01.251 --> 13:23:03.685
THE RUSSIANS AS WE SPEAK AND 
WHAT IS HE SAYING BACK OFF OR 

13:23:03.886 --> 13:23:05.920
RUSH I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR 
HELP I DON'T WANT FOREIGN 

13:23:06.133 --> 13:23:10.609
INTERFERENCE HE'S SAYING NO COME
ON IN CHINA. AND HE'S GOT HIS 

13:23:10.801 --> 13:23:15.472
GUY IN UKRAINE CONTINUING THE 
SCHEME. WE CAN'T WAIT A YEAR OR 

13:23:15.672 --> 13:23:20.955
TWO-YEAR OR THREE YEARS LIKE WE 
HAD TO WAIT FOR DON McGANN TO 

13:23:21.171 --> 13:23:23.941
GET JOHN BOLTON INTO TESTIFY TO 
LET YOU KNOW THIS THREAT IS 

13:23:24.078 --> 13:23:28.274
ONGOING. COUNSEL ALSO SAYS THIS 
IS JUST LIKE OBAMA. THIS IS JUST

13:23:29.037 --> 13:23:31.037
LIKE OBAMA. SIDING I SUPPOSE THE

13:23:34.373 --> 13:23:36.373
FAST AND FURIOUS CASE. THEY 
DON'T MENTION THAT IN THAT 

13:23:36.408 --> 13:23:39.445
INVESTIGATION THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION TURNED OVER TENS 

13:23:39.659 --> 13:23:44.128
OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS. DON'T
WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. 

13:23:44.531 --> 13:23:48.951
THEY SAID IT'S JUST LIKE OBAMA. 
WHEN YOU FIND VIDEO OF BARACK 

13:23:49.129 --> 13:23:53.261
OBAMA UNDER ARTICLE TO YOU HE 
CAN DO ANYTHING THEN YOU COME 

13:23:53.483 --> 13:23:58.347
COMPARE BARACK OBAMA TO DONALD 
TRUMP. HE WHEN YOU FIND VIDEO OF

13:23:58.547 --> 13:24:01.596
BARACK OBAMA SAYING I WILL FIGHT
ALL SUBPOENA ON SUBPOENAS YOU 

13:24:02.359 --> 13:24:09.115
CAN COMPARE BARACK OBAMA TO 
DONALD TRUMP. AND FINALLY MR. 

13:24:09.315 --> 13:24:16.216
CIPOLLONE SAYS  PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS A MAN OF HIS WORD. WELL IT'S 

13:24:16.633 --> 13:24:19.269
TOO LATE IN THE EVENING FOR ME 
TO GO INTO THAT ONE. EXCEPT TO 

13:24:20.035 --> 13:24:24.688
SAY THIS. PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE 
HIS WORD HE WOULD DRAIN THE 

13:24:24.830 --> 13:24:30.235
SWAMP. HE SAID HE WOULD DRAIN 
THE SWAMP. AND WHAT HAVE WE 

13:24:30.441 --> 13:24:36.134
SEEN? WE'VE SEEN HIS PERSONAL 
LAWYER GO TO JAIL. IS CAMPAIGN 

13:24:36.335 --> 13:24:41.954
CHAIRMAN GO TO JAIL. IS DEPUTY 
CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN CONVICTED OF A

13:24:42.103 --> 13:24:48.520
DIFFERENT CRIME. HIS ASSOCIATES 
ASSOCIATE UNDER INDICTMENT. THE 

13:24:48.722 --> 13:24:50.722
LIST GOES ON AND ON.

13:24:53.806 --> 13:24:56.239
THAT'S HOW YOU DRAIN THE SWAMP 
YOU HAVE ALL YOUR PEOPLE GO TO 

13:24:56.446 --> 13:24:59.489
JAIL. I DON'T THINK THAT'S 
REALLY WHAT WAS MEANT I THAT 

13:24:59.704 --> 13:25:04.579
EXPRESSION BUT FOR THE PURPOSES 
OF WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY, HOW 

13:25:04.781 --> 13:25:09.039
DOES SOMEONE WHO PROMISES TO 
DRAIN THE SWAMP COURSE AND ALLY 

13:25:09.787 --> 13:25:15.752
OF OURS INTO DOING A POLITICAL 
INVESTIGATION. THAT IS THE 

13:25:15.953 --> 13:25:19.403
SWAMP. THAT'S NOT DRAINING THE 
SWAMP. THAT'S EXPORTING THE 

13:25:19.609 --> 13:25:22.383
SWAMP. I YIELD BACK. 
&gt;&gt;

13:25:25.901 --> 13:25:28.549
I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE AT 
THIS POINT FOR ME TO ADMONISH 

13:25:28.750 --> 13:25:33.416
BOTH THE HOUSE MANAGERS AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL IN EQUAL 

13:25:33.619 --> 13:25:38.503
TERMS, THE REMORA THAT THEY ARE 
ADDRESSING THE WORLD'S GREATEST 

13:25:39.263 --> 13:25:41.263
DELIBERATIVE BODY

13:25:45.817 --> 13:25:48.055
. ONE REASON IT HAS EARNED THE 
TITLE IS BECAUSE ITS MEMBERS 

13:25:48.252 --> 13:25:50.285
AVOID SPEAKING IN A MANNER AND 
USING LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT 

13:25:50.488 --> 13:25:56.170
CONDUCIVE TO CIVIL DISCOURSE. IN
THE 1905 SWING TRIAL THE SENATOR

13:25:56.372 --> 13:25:59.022
OBJECTED WHEN ONE OF THE 
MANAGERS USED THE WORD PETTY 

13:25:59.229 --> 13:26:01.229
FOGGY. THE PROVIDING

13:26:03.890 --> 13:26:06.539
OFFICER SAID THE WORD OUGHT NOT 
TO OF BEEN USE. I DON'T THINK WE

13:26:06.740 --> 13:26:09.988
NEED TO ASPIRE TO THAT HIGH OF 
STANDARD BUT I THINK THOSE 

13:26:10.189 --> 13:26:12.189
ADDRESSING THE SENATE SHOULD 
REMEMBER WHERE THEY ARE.

13:26:44.263 --> 13:26:46.263
RECOGNIZE.

13:26:48.580 --> 13:26:51.029
THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, IT 
WILL SURPRISE NO ONE THAT I MOVE

13:26:51.235 --> 13:26:56.716

FOR YAYS AND NAYS. IS THERE A 

13:26:56.913 --> 13:27:01.318

13:32:43.885 --> 13:32:50.988
DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS RECOGNIZE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. 

13:32:51.402 --> 13:32:54.038
I SEND AN AMENDMENT TO THE DESK 
TO PROVIDE FOR A VOTE FOR THE 

13:32:54.239 --> 13:32:57.090
SENATE ON ANY MOTION TO SUBPOENA
WITNESSES OR DOCUMENTS AFTER THE

13:32:57.847 --> 13:33:06.838
QUESTION.. I WAVE THE READING. 
&gt;&gt; OBJECTION TO THE WAIVING OF 

13:33:07.597 --> 13:33:12.457
THE READING? 
&gt;&gt; I WITHDRAW MY REQUEST FOR A 

13:33:12.598 --> 13:33:14.598
WAIVER.

13:33:23.090 --> 13:33:25.324
&gt;&gt; DOES ANY SENATOR HAVE ANY 
OBJECTION TO THE WAIVING OF THE 

13:33:25.526 --> 13:33:27.526
READING? THERE IS AN OBJECTION 
YES.

13:33:32.840 --> 13:33:34.054
THE COURT WOULD READ THE 
AMENDMENT. 

13:33:34.055 --> 13:33:36.055
&gt;&gt; SENATOR FROM NEW YORK MR. 
SCHUMER PROPOSES AN AMENDMENT 

13:33:36.088 --> 13:33:41.169
NUMBER 1292. ON PAGE 3 LINE 8 
STRIKE FOUR HOURS AND INSERT TWO

13:33:41.371 --> 13:33:45.237
HOURS ON PAGE 3 LINE 10 STRIKE 
THE QUESTION OF AND ALL THAT 

13:33:45.436 --> 13:33:51.737
FOLLOWS TWO RULES ONLINE 12. ON 
PAGE 3 LINE 14 INSERT ANY SUCH 

13:33:52.499 --> 13:34:00.478
MOTIONS AFTER DECIDE. ON PAGE 3 
LINE 15 STRIKE WEATHER AND ALL 

13:34:00.673 --> 13:34:05.699
THAT FOLLOWS THROUGH DOCUMENTS 
ON LINE 17. ON PAGE 3 LINE 18 

13:34:05.845 --> 13:34:12.041
STRIKE THAT QUESTION AND INSERT 
ANY SUCH MOTION. ON PAGE 3 LINE 

13:34:12.807 --> 13:34:17.223
20 THROUGH 24 STRIKE IN THE 
SENATE AND

13:34:20.774 --> 13:34:22.404
SHALL DECIDE AFTER DEPOSITION 
WHICH WITNESSES SHALL TESTIFY 

13:34:22.405 --> 13:34:26.554
AND INSERT AND THEN SHALL 
TESTIFY IN THE SENATE.

13:34:31.339 --> 13:34:36.421
&gt;&gt; THE AMENDMENT IS ARGUABLE BY 
THE PARTIES FOR TWO HOURS 

13:34:36.822 --> 13:34:42.256
EQUALLY DIVIDED. MR. SCHIFF ARE 
YOU AN OPPONENT OR  PROPONENT. 

13:34:42.401 --> 13:34:46.876
MR. VINDMAN  PROPONENT OR 
OPPONENT. MR.

13:34:51.040 --> 13:34:53.391
SCHIFF YOU MAY PROCEED AND 
RESERVE TIME FOR REBUTTAL .

13:35:05.875 --> 13:35:07.706
&gt;&gt; THIS AMENDMENT MAKES TWO 
IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE 

13:35:07.707 --> 13:35:11.357
McCONNELL RESOLUTION. THE FIRST 
IS THE McCONNELL RESOLUTION DOES

13:35:11.557 --> 13:35:13.557
NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDE

13:35:16.439 --> 13:35:19.234
FOR AN IMMEDIATE VOTE EVEN LATER
ON THE WITNESSES THAT WE HAVE 

13:35:19.376 --> 13:35:22.533
REQUESTED. THE McCONNELL 
RESOLUTION SAYS AT SOME POINT 

13:35:23.294 --> 13:35:25.294
AFTER THE

13:35:27.206 --> 13:35:29.440
TRIAL IS OVER AFTER YOU'VE HAD 
THE ARGUMENTS OF BOTH SIDES YOU 

13:35:29.642 --> 13:35:32.496
HAVE THE 16 HOURS OF QUESTIONING
THEN THERE WILL BE A DEBATE AS 

13:35:32.691 --> 13:35:37.359
TO WHETHER TO HAVE THE VOTE ON 
THE WITNESSES. THERE IS NO EVEN 

13:35:37.559 --> 13:35:43.245
GUARANTEED YOU WILL GET A CHANCE
TO VOTE ON SPECIFIC WITNESSES. 

13:35:43.660 --> 13:35:48.332
ALL OF THE RESOLUTION PROVIDES 
IS YOU WILL GET AN OPPORTUNITY 

13:35:48.529 --> 13:35:51.576
TO VOTE TO HAVE A DEBATE ON 
WHETHER TO OPENLY HAVE A VOTE ON

13:35:51.779 --> 13:35:56.816
THE WITNESS. THIS WOULD STRIP 
THAT MIDDLE LAYER. THIS WOULD 

13:35:56.953 --> 13:36:00.404
STRIP ON WHETHER TO HAVE A 
DEBATE ON IT PARTICULAR WITNESS.

13:36:01.281 --> 13:36:05.467
IF MIKE COLLEAGUES FOR THE 
PRESIDENT'S TEAM,

13:36:09.044 --> 13:36:11.080
ARE MAKING THE POINT WELL YOU 
ARE GOING TO GET THAT 

13:36:11.279 --> 13:36:13.279
OPPORTUNITY, LATER. THE REALITY 
UNDER THE McCONNELL

13:36:18.184 --> 13:36:20.219
RESOLUTION WE MAY NOT GET TO 
HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THE 

13:36:20.420 --> 13:36:22.420
PARTICULAR WITNESSES. YOU'VE 
HEARD THE DISCUSSION OF

13:36:26.317 --> 13:36:28.350
FOUR WITNESSES TONIGHT. THEY MAY
BE OTHERS THAT COME TO THE 

13:36:28.552 --> 13:36:30.984
ATTENTION OF THIS BODY IF WE ARE
ABLE TO GET DOCUMENTS THAT WE 

13:36:31.184 --> 13:36:33.921
SHOULD ALSO CALL. BUT WILL YOU 
EVER GET TO HEAR A DEBATE

13:36:37.484 --> 13:36:39.516
ABOUT WHY A PARTICULAR WITNESSES
NECESSARY? YOU MAY ONLY GET A 

13:36:39.717 --> 13:36:41.717
DEBATE OVER THE DEBATE. SO THIS 
AMENDMENT WOULD REMOVE THAT 

13:36:41.752 --> 13:36:45.405
DEBATE OVER DEBATE REGARDING 
PARTICULAR WITNESS. THE OTHER 

13:36:45.618 --> 13:36:48.051
THING THIS RESOLUTION WOULD 
PROVIDE IS THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR 

13:36:48.252 --> 13:36:51.504
FROM THESE WITNESSES DIRECTLY. 
McCONNELL RESOLUTION SAID THEY 

13:36:51.707 --> 13:36:53.707
WILL BE DEPOSED. AND THAT'S IT

13:36:57.600 --> 13:36:59.834
. IT DOESN'T SAY YOU WILL EVER 
ACTUALLY GOING TO HEAR THESE 

13:37:00.034 --> 13:37:03.581
WITNESSES FOR YOURSELF. WHICH 
MEANS THAT U.S. THE TRIERS OF

13:37:09.170 --> 13:37:11.404
FACT MAY NOT GET TO SEE AND 
WITNESS THE CREDIBILITY OF THESE

13:37:11.617 --> 13:37:14.390
WITNESSES. YOU MAY ONLY GET TO 
SEE A DEPOSITION OR A DEPOSITION

13:37:14.534 --> 13:37:16.534
TRANSCRIPT

13:37:21.155 --> 13:37:23.801
OR A VIDEO OF THE TRANSCRIPT, I 
DON'T KNOW. BUT IF THERE IS ANY 

13:37:24.002 --> 13:37:26.036
CONTEST OF THE FACTS, WOULDN'T 
YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE 

13:37:26.236 --> 13:37:28.277
WITNESSES THEMSELVES? NOW THE 
REASON WHY IT WAS DONE THIS WAY 

13:37:28.473 --> 13:37:30.473
IN THE CLINTON CASE WIDE THERE 
WERE

13:37:34.569 --> 13:37:36.569
DEPOSITIONS AND AGAIN, IN THE 
CLINTON CASE ALL THESE PEOPLE 

13:37:36.590 --> 13:37:38.590
HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED AND DEPOSED
OR TESTIFIED BEFORE,

13:37:42.286 --> 13:37:44.725
BUT THE REASON WHY IT WAS DONE 
THAT WAY AND CLINTON WAS BECAUSE

13:37:44.924 --> 13:37:47.118
OF THE SALACIOUS NATURE OF THE 
TESTIMONY. NOBODY WANTED 

13:37:47.265 --> 13:37:49.265
WITNESSES

13:37:51.420 --> 13:37:53.657
ON THE SENATE FLOOR TALKING 
ABOUT SEX. AS I SAID BEFORE THAT

13:37:53.869 --> 13:37:59.352
WILL NOT BE THE ISSUE HERE. TO 
WHATEVER DEGREE THERE WAS LITTLE

13:37:59.553 --> 13:38:01.553
RELUCTANCE IN THE CLINTON CASE 
TO HAVE LIVE TESTIMONY BECAUSE 

13:38:01.586 --> 13:38:05.037
OF ITS SALACIOUS CHARACTER, THAT
IS NOT IN ISSUE HERE. THAT IS 

13:38:05.239 --> 13:38:09.906
NOT A REASON TO HEAR THE 
WITNESSES FOR YOURSELF. THIS 

13:38:10.119 --> 13:38:12.119
RESOLUTION MAKES TWO IMPORTANT 
CHANGES AND I WOULD URGE YOUR 

13:38:12.144 --> 13:38:15.941
SUPPORT OF IT. 
&gt;&gt; MR. CIPOLLONE. 

13:38:36.929 --> 13:38:41.690
&gt;&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, MEMBERS OF
THE SENATE, GOOD MORNING.

13:38:47.892 --> 13:38:50.629
I WILL BE VERY BRIEF ON THIS. WE
STRONGLY OPPOSE THE AMENDMENT

13:38:56.026 --> 13:38:58.026
. WE SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AS 
WRITTEN WE BELIEVE THE 

13:38:58.047 --> 13:39:00.047
RESOLUTION AS TO THE TWO AREAS 
THAT MANAGER

13:39:03.531 --> 13:39:04.963
SCHIFF DISCUSSED, THE RESOLUTION
APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERS THE 

13:39:04.964 --> 13:39:08.014
QUESTIONS AND STRIKES  THE 
APPROPRIATE BALANCE IN THE 

13:39:08.214 --> 13:39:10.798
SENATE'S DISCRETION AS THE SOLE 
TRIER OF IMPEACHMENTS.

13:39:14.716 --> 13:39:17.513
THE RULES IN PLACE HERE AND THE 
RESOLUTION ARE SIMILAR TO THE 

13:39:17.656 --> 13:39:23.448
CLINTON PROCEEDING IN THAT 
REGARD IN THE SENSE THAT THIS 

13:39:23.658 --> 13:39:28.116
BODY HAS THE DISCRETION AS TO 
WHETHER TO HEAR THE WITNESS LIVE

13:39:28.317 --> 13:39:31.520
IF THERE ARE WITNESSES AT SOME 
POINT OR NOT. BUT MORE 

13:39:31.660 --> 13:39:35.669
FUNDAMENTALLY, THE PRELIMINARY 
QUESTION HAS TO BE OVERCOME 

13:39:35.833 --> 13:39:43.906
WHICH IS THEY WILL HAVE TWO 
HOURS, FOUR HOURS TOTAL, FOUR 

13:39:44.048 --> 13:39:46.048
HOURS

13:39:48.632 --> 13:39:52.700
TWO HOURS FOR THEM. TO TRY TO 
CONVINCE YOU AFTER THE PARTIES 

13:39:52.906 --> 13:39:54.906
OF MADE THEIR

13:39:58.783 --> 13:40:00.816
PRESENTATION, WHICH THEY WILL 
HAVE 24 HOURS TO DO AS TO 

13:40:01.019 --> 13:40:03.616
WHETHER OR NOT THE PRELIMINARY 
QUESTION WHETHER IT SHALL BE AN 

13:40:03.759 --> 13:40:07.314
ORDER TO CONSIDER AND ABATE ANY 
MOTION TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES OR 

13:40:07.515 --> 13:40:11.783
DOCUMENTS. THAT WAS PRECISELY 
THE CLINTON RULES, STRONGER THAN

13:40:11.996 --> 13:40:15.648
THE CLINTON RULES, I'M SORRY. 
THOSE RULES AS I'VE INDICATED 

13:40:15.849 --> 13:40:21.266
BEFORE, PAST 100 TO ZERO. WE 
THINK THE RESOLUTION STRIKES THE

13:40:21.410 --> 13:40:26.617
APPROPRIATE BALANCE AND WE URGE 
THAT THE AMENDMENT BE REJECTED. 

13:40:27.018 --> 13:40:35.153
I YIELD MY TIME. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU COUNSEL. MR. SCHIFF

13:40:35.351 --> 13:40:42.050
YOU HAVE 57 MINUTES.  ECO-DON'T 
WORRY, I WON'T USE IT. I WOULD 

13:40:42.266 --> 13:40:45.851
SAY ONLY IF THERE WAS ANY THE 
DEER LEFT, ANY VIDEO LEFT TO 

13:40:45.990 --> 13:40:50.584
CAMOUFLAGE WHERE THE PRESIDENT'S
COUNSEL IS REALLY COMING FROM, 

13:40:51.349 --> 13:40:53.349
THE VENEER

13:40:57.497 --> 13:40:59.497
IS COMPLETELY GONE NOW. AFTER 
SAYING WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN 

13:40:59.530 --> 13:41:01.553
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOTE ON 
THESE WITNESSES LATER, NOW THEY 

13:41:01.764 --> 13:41:06.836
ARE SAYING NO, WE ARE JUST GOING
TO HAVE A VOTE ON WHETHER TO 

13:41:07.041 --> 13:41:08.465
DEBATE HAVING A VOTE ON THE 
WITNESSES. 

13:41:08.466 --> 13:41:10.466
&gt;&gt; THE CAMOUFLAGE WAS PRETTY IN

13:41:16.187 --> 13:41:18.187
TO BEGIN WITH BUT IT'S 
COMPLETELY GONE NOW. WHAT THEY 

13:41:18.207 --> 13:41:20.439
REALLY WANT THEY WANT TO GET TO 
THAT DEBATE THAT GENERIC DEBATE 

13:41:20.654 --> 13:41:23.087
ON WHETHER TO HAVE A DEBATE ON 
THE WITNESSES AND HAVE YOU VOTE 

13:41:23.288 --> 13:41:25.936
IT DOWN SO YOU NEVER ACTUALLY 
HAVE A VOTE TO REFUSE THESE 

13:41:26.137 --> 13:41:29.588
WITNESSES ALTHOUGH YOU HAD TO DO
THAT TONIGHT. I DON'T SEE WHAT 

13:41:29.791 --> 13:41:35.474
THAT PURPOSE SERVES EXCEPT I 
SUPPOSED TO PUT ONE MORE LAYER 

13:41:35.889 --> 13:41:37.889
IN THE WAY OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

13:41:41.574 --> 13:41:43.810
BUT THE VENEER IS GONE, ALL THIS
PROMISE ABOUT YOUR GONNA GET 

13:41:44.566 --> 13:41:49.034
THIS OPPORTUNITY, NO, THE WHOLE 
GOAL IS YOU WILL NEVER GET A 

13:41:49.179 --> 13:41:54.925
CHANCE TO TAKE THAT VOTE AND 
WHAT'S MORE, THE VOTE ON THIS 

13:41:55.070 --> 13:41:59.445
RESOLUTION IS A VOTE THAT SAYS 
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM 

13:41:59.647 --> 13:42:01.647
THESE WITNESSES YOURSELF.

13:42:08.994 --> 13:42:10.994
YOU DON'T WANT TO EVALUATE THE 
CREDIBILITY OF THESE WITNESSES 

13:42:11.027 --> 13:42:13.027
YOURSELF. MAYBE JUST MAYBE 
YOU'LL LET THEM BE DEPOSED BUT 

13:42:13.059 --> 13:42:15.298
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THEM 
YOURSELF. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE 

13:42:15.495 --> 13:42:20.977
THESE WITNESSES COME IN AND PUT 
UP THEIR HAND AND TAKE AN OATH. 

13:42:21.380 --> 13:42:23.830
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES
OF THE DEPOSITIONS ARE GOING TO 

13:42:24.025 --> 13:42:26.025
BE. MAYBE THE PUBLIC ISN'T

13:42:30.532 --> 13:42:32.760
GOING TO EVER GET TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THOSE DEPOSITIONS WE 

13:42:32.963 --> 13:42:34.993
RELEASED ALL THE TRANSCRIPTS 
FROM OUR DEPOSITIONS THOSE 

13:42:35.755 --> 13:42:39.261
SECRET DEPOSITIONS. WE HAVE NO 
IDEA WHAT RULE THEY WILL ADOPT 

13:42:39.462 --> 13:42:43.824
FOR THESE DEPOSITIONS. MAYBE THE
PUBLIC WILL SEE THEM MAYBE WON'T

13:42:44.746 --> 13:42:46.746
MAYBE YOU'LL GET TO SEE THEM

13:42:52.664 --> 13:42:55.716
I ASSUME YOU'LL GET TO SEE THEM.
AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS A 

13:42:55.915 --> 13:42:58.762
VOTE YOU WILL HAVE TO CAST THIS 
IS NO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THEM 

13:42:58.963 --> 13:43:00.995

SCHUMER FOR MR. VAN HOLLEN

13:57:20.421 --> 13:57:22.759
PROPOSES AN AMENDMENT NUMBER

13:57:31.400 --> 13:57:33.400
THE PRESIDING OFFICER SHALL RULE

THE SENATOR MOVES TO SUBPOENA IF

13:57:35.660 --> 13:57:37.660

LIKELY TO HAVE EVIDENCE RELEVANT
RELEVANT TO ARTICLES OF 

13:57:39.519 --> 13:57:42.518

13:58:08.705 --> 13:58:14.453

WOULD PROVIDE THAT THE PRESIDING

OFFICER SHALL RULE TO AUTHORIZE

13:58:19.336 --> 13:58:21.513

EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO EITHER 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, IS 

13:58:47.706 --> 13:58:49.706
QUITE SIMPLE.

13:58:55.089 --> 13:58:57.467
IT WOULD ALLOW THE CHIEF 
JUSTICE, THE SENATORS, THE HOUSE

13:58:57.606 --> 13:59:02.809
MANAGERS, TO MAKE USE OF THE 
EXPERIENCE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE 

13:59:03.006 --> 13:59:09.101
OF THE SUPREME COURT TO HAVE 
RELEVANCE OF WITNESSES. EITHER 

13:59:09.861 --> 13:59:13.576
PARTY CAN CALL WITNESSES IF WE 
CAN'T COME TO AGREEMENT OF 

13:59:13.767 --> 13:59:18.235
WITNESSES TO OURSELVES IT WILL 
PICK A NEUTRAL ARBITER OF THE 

13:59:18.436 --> 13:59:21.086
CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME 
COURT. AFTER CHIEF JUSTICE FINDS

13:59:21.289 --> 13:59:26.514
IT WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE THAT 
WITNESS WILL BE ALLOWED TO 

13:59:26.655 --> 13:59:32.869
TESTIFY. IF CHIEF JUSTICE FINDS 
IT WOULD BE IMMATERIAL THAT 

13:59:33.270 --> 13:59:38.499
CHIEF JUSTICE NOT TESTIFY. IS 
STILL MAINTAINS THE SENATE IF 

13:59:38.639 --> 13:59:43.837
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE CHIEF 
JUSTICE YOU CAN OVERRULE HIM. IF

13:59:44.037 --> 13:59:47.490
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THE 
CHIEF JUSTICE HAS DECIDED. BUT 

13:59:47.696 --> 13:59:53.174
IT WOULD GIVE THIS DECISION TO A
NEUTRAL PARTY. THAT RIGHT IS 

13:59:53.374 --> 13:59:58.655
EXTENDED TO BOTH PARTIES, IT 
WILL BE DONE IN LINE WITH THE 

13:59:58.868 --> 14:00:00.868
SCHEDULE THAT THE MAJORITY 
LEADER HAS SET OUT, NOT THE 

14:00:00.887 --> 14:00:04.241
SCHEDULE WE WANT, WE STILL DON'T
THINK IT MAKES ANY SENSE

14:00:08.206 --> 14:00:11.053
AND HAVE A TRIAL AND THEN DECIDE
ON WITNESSES IF WE HAVE TO DO IT

14:00:11.254 --> 14:00:14.704
THAT WAY IT LOOKED LIKE WE ARE 
LET'S HAVE A NEUTRAL ARBITER 

14:00:14.906 --> 14:00:23.237
DECIDE. MUCH AS HE MADE LOATH 
THE TASK, WHETHER A WITNESS WE 

14:00:23.852 --> 14:00:25.852
WOULD HOPE THAT

14:00:29.537 --> 14:00:31.971
IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE WE CAN 
AGREE ON TONIGHT, WE COULD AGREE

14:00:32.170 --> 14:00:34.419
TO ALLOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO 
GIVE US THE BENEFIT OF HIS 

14:00:34.620 --> 14:00:36.620
EXPERIENCE IN DECIDING WHICH 
WITNESS

14:00:42.536 --> 14:00:44.570
IS RELEVANT TO THIS INQUIRY AND 
WHICH WITNESSES ARE NOT. AND 

14:00:44.772 --> 14:00:47.155
WITH THAT I RESERVE THE BALANCE 
OF MY TIME. 

14:00:47.156 --> 14:00:51.071
&gt;&gt; MR. CIPOLLONE. MR. CHIEF 
JUSTICE, MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 

14:00:51.279 --> 14:00:55.329
AND WITH NODE  DISRESPECT TO THE
CHIEF JUSTICE, THIS IS NOT AN 

14:00:56.078 --> 14:00:58.078
APPELLATE COURT

14:00:59.389 --> 14:01:01.422
, THIS IS UNITED STATES SENATE 
THERE IS NOT AN ARBITRATION 

14:01:01.623 --> 14:01:03.454
CLAUSE IN THE UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION THE SENATE WILL 

14:01:03.455 --> 14:01:09.953
HAVE THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO HOLD 
THE TRIAL. WE OPPOSE THE 

14:01:10.704 --> 14:01:16.455
AMENDMENT. 
&gt;&gt; MR. SHIFT YOU HAVE 57 MINUTES

14:01:17.216 --> 14:01:21.739
REMAINING. 
&gt;&gt; DON'T LET IT BE SAID WE 

14:01:21.949 --> 14:01:24.735
HAVEN'T MADE PROGRESS TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; THE PRESENCE COUNSEL HAS 

14:01:24.876 --> 14:01:30.273
ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IS NOT AN 
APPELLATE COURT I'M GLAD WE HAVE

14:01:30.478 --> 14:01:32.779
ESTABLISHED THAT. THIS IS A 
TRIAL. IT SHOULD BE

14:01:37.587 --> 14:01:39.620
BASED ON THE RECORD FROM THE 
COURT BELOW BECAUSE THERE'S NO 

14:01:39.821 --> 14:01:41.821
COURT BELOW BECAUSE AS THE 
COUNCIL HAS JUST ADMITTED, YOU 

14:01:41.854 --> 14:01:45.504
ARE NOT THE APPELLATE COURT. BUT
I THINK WE HAVE ALSO SEEN HERE 

14:01:45.703 --> 14:01:47.703
TONIGHT IS NOT ONLY

14:01:52.003 --> 14:01:54.036
DON'T WANT YOU TO HEAR THESE 
WITNESSES THEY DON'T WANT TO 

14:01:54.239 --> 14:01:56.472
HEAR THEM LIVE THEY DON'T WANT 
TO HEAR THEM DEPOSED, THEY DON'T

14:01:56.672 --> 14:02:02.291
WANT A NEUTRAL JUSTICE TO WEIGH 
IN BECAUSE OF THE WITH NEUTRAL

14:02:07.237 --> 14:02:09.272
JUSTICE WEIZEN AND SAYS PRETTY 
HARD TO ARGUE THAT JOHN BOLTON 

14:02:09.471 --> 14:02:14.150
IS NOT RELEVANT HERE. PRETTY 
HARD TO ARGUE MICK MULVANEY IS 

14:02:14.350 --> 14:02:16.877
NOT RELEVANT HERE I JUST WATCH 
THAT VIDEOTAPE WHERE HE SAID

14:02:20.652 --> 14:02:22.470
THEY DISCUSSED IT WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. IT'S PRETTY RELEVANT.

14:02:22.471 --> 14:02:24.471
WHAT ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN.

14:02:27.555 --> 14:02:29.587
THAT'S THE REAL REASON THEY 
DON'T WANT THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO 

14:02:29.789 --> 14:02:31.819
RULE ON THE MATERIALITY OF THE 
WITNESS RIGHT? WHAT CAN HUNTER 

14:02:32.019 --> 14:02:34.053
BIDEN TELL US ABOUT WHY THE 
PRESIDENT WITHHELD HUNDREDS OF 

14:02:34.252 --> 14:02:36.252
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

14:02:39.535 --> 14:02:41.972
TO UKRAINE. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT 
HE CAN TELL US, NOTHING. WHAT 

14:02:42.171 --> 14:02:44.766
DOES HUNTER BIDEN KNOW ABOUT WHY
THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T MEET WITH

14:02:44.905 --> 14:02:50.102
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY. HE CAN'T 
TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THAT . 

14:02:50.303 --> 14:02:52.426
WHAT CAN HE TELL US ABOUT THESE 
DEFENSE APARTMENT

14:02:56.402 --> 14:02:58.422
DOCUMENTS OR THE DOCUMENTS WHAT 
CAN HE TELL US ABOUT THE 

14:02:58.625 --> 14:03:00.625
VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND 
WITHHOLDING THE MONEY HE CAN 

14:03:00.654 --> 14:03:04.520
TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. IS 
HIS TESTIMONY IS IMMATERIAL AND 

14:03:04.721 --> 14:03:07.518
IRRELEVANT. THE ONLY PURPOSE IN 
CALLING HIM IS TO

14:03:15.287 --> 14:03:17.524
SUCCEED IN WHAT THEY FAILED TO 
DO EARLIER IN THIS WHOLE SCHEME 

14:03:17.721 --> 14:03:20.371
AND THAT IS TO SMEAR JOE BIDEN 
IT BY GOING AFTER HIS SON. WE 

14:03:20.570 --> 14:03:24.158
TRUST THE JEEP JUSTICE OF THE 
SUPREME COURT TO MAKE THAT 

14:03:24.305 --> 14:03:28.688
DECISION. THAT HE IS NOT A 
MATERIAL WITNESS. THIS ISN'T 

14:03:28.904 --> 14:03:30.904
LIKE A FANTASY FOOTBALL

14:03:34.586 --> 14:03:37.022
. WE ARE NOT MAKING TRADES OR WE
SHOULDN'T BE. WE'LL TRADE YOU 

14:03:37.221 --> 14:03:39.221
ONE COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT 
IRRELEVANT

14:03:42.905 --> 14:03:44.905
WITNESS THAT ALLOWS US TO SMEAR 
THE PRESIDENT'S OPPONENT IN 

14:03:44.939 --> 14:03:46.939
EXCHANGE FOR ONES THAT ARE 
REALLY RELEVANT BUT YOU SHOULD 

14:03:46.974 --> 14:03:54.087
HEAR. NOT A FAIR TRIAL. IF YOU 
CAN'T TRUST THE CHIEF JUSTICE 

14:03:54.489 --> 14:03:56.611
APPOINTED BY A REPUBLICAN 
PRESIDENT TO MAKE A FAIR

14:04:00.998 --> 14:04:02.998
DECISION ABOUT MATERIALITY, I 
THINK IT BETRAYS THE WEAKNESS OF

14:04:03.578 --> 14:04:06.876
YOUR CASE. I'LL BE HONEST, 
THERE'S BEEN SOME APPREHENSIVE 

14:04:07.624 --> 14:04:11.275
ON YOUR ON OUR SIDE ABOUT THIS 
IDEA.

14:04:19.071 --> 14:04:21.865
BUT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THE CHIEF
JUSTICE WOULD MAKE A FAIR AND 

14:04:22.044 --> 14:04:26.589
IMPARTIAL DECISION THAT HE WOULD
DO IMPARTIAL JUSTICE. IT'S 

14:04:26.789 --> 14:04:28.720
SOMETHING THAT MY COLLEAGUES 
REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT 

14:04:28.721 --> 14:04:35.725
DON'T. THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T 
WANT A FAIR JUDICIAL RULING 

14:04:36.485 --> 14:04:43.247
ABOUT THIS. THEY ONLY WANT ONE 
YOU CAN OVERTURN. BECAUSE THEY 

14:04:43.448 --> 14:04:46.897
DON'T WANT A FAIR TRIAL AND SO 
WE END WHERE WE STARTED. ONE 

14:04:47.100 --> 14:04:51.766
PARTY WANTING A FAIR TRIAL, ONE 
PARTY THAT DOESN'T. ONE PARTY 

14:04:52.180 --> 14:04:56.848
THAT DOESN'T FEAR OF THEIR TRIAL
AND ONE PARTY THAT IS TERRIFIED 

14:04:57.462 --> 14:05:00.399
OF A FAIR TRIAL. I YIELD BACK.

14:05:06.395 --> 14:05:08.829
