00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.470
Impeachment is a divisive issue in our country. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.690
I didn't believe in it then, I don't believe in it now.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.030
That whistleblower material must be made available to Congress.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.280
So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.060
Of course I did. 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.690
I've had conversations with many leaders their always appropriate.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.450
 I did not think that Donald Trump could shock me anymore.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.350
He's gotta go.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.070
I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.380
with an official impeachment inquiry. 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.200
Look, it's just a continuation of the witch hunt. 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.580
To impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.050
 And you read it that nobody push it. Pushed me. Yes. 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.430
In other words, no pressure.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.310
Serious, urgent, credible. 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.710
Disturbing, alarming. 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.210
This case is unique and unprecedented. 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.760
You look at that conversation, there's no threat. 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.170
There's no quid pro quo.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.360
It's a hyper partisan environment. 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.350
I'm just tired of it.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.060
It could not be explained. It was crazy. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.390
It was terrible. It's not the way I wanted my career to end. 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.730
I knew that I had to report this. 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.870
Was there a quid pro quo? The answer is yes. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.810
The instructions are coming from the President on down. 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.980
I'm too busy to watch it. 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.950
Everybody has their impression of what truth is.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.620
Who would benefit from from an investigation into the Bidens? 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.180
I assume President Trump would benefit. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.470
There we have it, see.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.270
He said, 'oh yeah, he's gonna do it. He'll do anything you ask.' 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.970
I think this is all going to blow up. And here we are. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.440
You're going to impeach and remove a president for this. 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.600
They call it the impeachment hoax. 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.380
Is this must-watch TV? Absolutely not.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.510
Today I'm asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment. 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.150
I've been very disappointed how the House has handled this.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.880
The House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment, 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.550
charging the President of the United States. 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.090
Ay. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.470
My vote is no.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.250
No. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.000
Ay.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.130
There are 23 aus and 17 now.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.550
This is really a travesty for America.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.150
Why do we keep calling this a solemn occasion

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.120
when you've been wanting to do this ever since the gentleman was elected? 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.560
Enough is enough. 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.530
I hope that we will finally move past this nightmare. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.480
The evidence is overwhelming. 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.530
That's a bunch of bog.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.670
It's a sham. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.960
It's a sham impeachment. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.210
You simply don't like him. 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.360
I don't hate the president. But I love my country

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.920
and I have no other choice. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.710
Article I is adopted.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.440
He is president today, he'll be president tomorrow.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.090
I said 'how you doing?' 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.310
'Well, I'm being impeached other than that I'm doing okay.'

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.520
I do.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.280
Those addressing the Senate should remember where they.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.130
I move to table the amendment.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.180
Table the amendment.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.050
Table the amendment.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.650
This is corruption and abuse of power in its purest form. 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.040
It is the same thing day after day after day. 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.940
Well, you're the ones who voted against new evidence, new testimony, new documents.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.120
He obstructed us, he's trying to obstruct you. 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.730
If you don't bring on a witness, if you don't have evidence

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.710
and don't have documents you don't have a trial.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.229
The President did absolutely nothing wrong.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.300
John Bolton.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.730
John R. Bolton's forthcoming book. 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.410
And the testimony of Bolton.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.670
Nothing was ever said to John Bolton, but I have not seen a manuscript.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.180
We're all staring a White House cover up in the face. 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.830
He's trying to sell a book. 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.750
It really doesn't change anything. 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.050
As a trial is any 10-year old knows, we should have witnesses.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.040
That gets us into this endless cycle of... 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.200
and this drags on for weeks and months. 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.330
I'm ready to vote and I'm ready to vote now.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.790
48 senators have pronounced Donald John Trump, President of the United States, guilty as charged. 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.870
52 senators have pronounced him not guilty as charged.
