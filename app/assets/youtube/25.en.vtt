00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.780
The BBC wants to answer important
questions facing the US today

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.620
and we need your help.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.980
Yes, you!

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.420
So if you have a story idea, leave a comment below

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.020
and we may be getting in touch sooner than you think

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.600
with our new series called 'Ask America'.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.300
But who are we?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.280
We are BBC News journalists filming stories all across the country

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.320
like this one about the many
jobs a teacher in Oklahoma has to work

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.680
to make ends meet.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.520
Yes, I knew what I was
getting into.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.740
Did I think I wasn't going to receive a raise in 10 years?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.700
Absolutely not.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.999
Or this one in Stockton about a Stanford
grad who moved back to save his hometown.

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.920
Sometimes I pinch myself like 'yo, you're the mayor.'

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.890
Especially comes like problem solving

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.180
or like 'why don't why aren't we doing this
or why don't they do that?'

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.660
And it's like 'why aren't you doing it? You're the mayor.'

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.140
And we publish these videos in all if your favourite places

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.720
and formats!

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.380
The good news
is were interested in all kinds of topics like...

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.480
immigration

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.300
education

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.200
healthcare

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.340
and sports!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520
But we'd love to hear from you if

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
there's something happening in your neck
of the woods that you think would be

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.220
interesting to the BBC's global audience

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.580
We'll be out and about in the coming
weeks to highlight your story ideas and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.160
answer your questions.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.262
