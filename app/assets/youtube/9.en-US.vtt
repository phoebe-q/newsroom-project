00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.090
When Biden led the polls in almost every battleground state,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.031
experts warned that a Trump win was still possible.

00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:11.095
But only if polls were even worse than they were in 2016.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.098
But look at where Biden is right now. He's up by 10 points.

00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:17.095
More than that - look at that. He's above 50 percent.

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:20.058
Hillary Clinton was well below 50 percent.

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.099
So did history repeat itself in 2020?

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.086
Let's compare the polling averages listed by FiveThirtyEight with the actual results.

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:36.024
Both nationally and in every battleground state, Trump outperformed the polls again.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.084
That ended up being decisive in only two states: Florida and North Carolina,

00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:44.095
where the winner was different than what was projected,

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:48.038
but didn't change the overall electoral outcome.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:54.062
But the stark difference between polls and reality in states like Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:56.076
still stands out.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.013
One pollster who predicted Trump's wide margin in Iowa correctly,

00:01:01.013 --> 00:01:03.016
against conventional wisdom,

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.063
was Ann Selzer.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:10.047
It takes a little bit of practice to live in what I call 'the corral of pot shots'

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:14.031
while your poll is out there waiting to see what happens with the election.

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.028
Polling Trump in midwestern states such as Iowa

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:20.095
has been a riddle for the industry ever since 2016.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:23.055
So what makes her methods different?

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:27.052
There are a lot of pollsters who do what I call they poll backwards,

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:30.086
that is they look at what happened in previous elections

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:37.086
and use that to adjust their sample of today to hopefully project an electorate of tomorrow.

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:43.004
And I don't do that. I take nothing from the past and build it into my polls.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:47.054
Therefore, I hope, the future can reveal itself to me in my data.

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:50.091
Part of the problem these days, according to Rachel Bitecofer,

00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:54.021
is who is available to pollsters.

00:01:54.021 --> 00:02:02.062
There is this perpetual problem of finding people from the bottom 50 percent,

00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:06.049
left and right, who are going to do a survey.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.006
They don't know who Mitch McConnell is.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.023
They don't know who Nancy Pelosi is.

00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:12.093
They don't read The New York Times.

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:14.060
They don't watch the news.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.034
What makes things even harder is that Republicans in the US

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:24.004
are much more likely to distrust news organisations who sponsor a lot of polling.

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:28.092
Which could be one explanation of why Trump underperforms in polls.

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:32.062
We're in this time period where especially the political right

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:37.082
has found value in getting people to distrust government,

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:44.023
and getting people to divest themselves from civic participation.

00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:47.023
So what could be a solution?

00:02:47.023 --> 00:02:50.030
The only way that pollsters will ever be able to measure them

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.098
is by asking longer questions and by empowering these people, telling them

00:02:54.098 --> 00:02:58.045
that if you speak to us the world is going to hear you.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:03.065
It actually requires a different questionnaire than what we normally would do with voters.
