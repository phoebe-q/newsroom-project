00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.770
Katy's always been a deep soul Katy was
a deep soul when she was a young kid she

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.019
started playing soccer when she was
about four years old

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.360
and she was a very aggressive soccer
player take a while for her to warm up

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.390
to people but once she did they were
they were best buddies

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.979
it's probably very difficult for you to
think about and to talk about back to

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.049
when you were 18 what was like

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.450
when I got to Robert's house she was
sitting in a big fluffy chair with her

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.310
legs over it and she was texting and I
went over to her and I said how you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.540
doing and she just kind of shrugged her
shoulders like a teenager sometimes will

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.360
and I didn't feel an alarm I just felt
like my girl had gotten hurt

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.960
I remember, we were walking out and we heard this and
I got it loud but then I walked in and I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.230
looked in the chair and she wasn't in
the chair didn't get alarmed then I

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.610
walked to the kitchen looked went on his
back patio little porch No

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.220
and I saw the bathroom door shut twisted
the door and I said Katie you okay

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.269
and she didn't answer my son picks me up
and takes me through the living room

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.799
outside in the yard and and just stands
me there and says mom Katie got my gun

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.460
and I don't know she's hurt

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.540
she'll never eat she'll never drink
she'll never bathe herself she'll never

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.870
converse she'll be a vegetable
she'll just be in a skilled facility for

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.639
the rest of her life as I said I'm not
ready to let go my daughter I just not

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.450
you know I mean you don't in that moment
you think you're gonna have the great

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.969
courage and stamina but you're just as
feeble as a feather in the wind your

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:54.439
heart is in your throat but yet out of
the depths of your of your gut your soul

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.740
your heart no your we're not going to
let go

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.560
Was that a big decision
to make?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:49.540
 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.200
I think I was trying to look for old
characteristics if I could see anything

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.200
from the pre-accident Katie of the
pre-injury I don't think I did

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.520
it was very surreal
I remember thinking where is Katie

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.230
you know at the same time so grateful that
she's alive and so grateful that she

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.060
didn't have to walk around the rest of
her life without a face but it was hard

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.240
I I grieved her old face a lot I have to
be honest

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.380
Katie do you still think about and long for the things that you wanted when you were 18

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.100
like to meet someone and fall in love and I can see you smiling now

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.520
Of course this is not the story I would have written for her.. but I feel like there's a reason if

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.790
she's here there's a lot to learn
there's a lot in this whole story with

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:40.800
Katie but I don't think her life is over

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:56.000
 

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:00.520
you
