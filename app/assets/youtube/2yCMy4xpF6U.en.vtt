Obama: Mr. President-Elect. How are you? Good to see you.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.690
Congratulations.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.930
It's so nice to see you. How are you?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.060
Trump: It looked like a million, million and a half people.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.330
The rest of the, you know, 20-block area,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.670
all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.360
And I want to just pray for Arnold,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.160
if we can, for those ratings, okay?

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.760
[Chuckles]

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.540
Thank you, everybody.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.280
Handshake? Handshake?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.640
-Do you want to have a handshake?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.890
-You know, coming from a different world

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.970
and only being a politician for a short period of time,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.190
how am I doing? Am I doing okay? I'm president.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.360
Hey, I'm president! Can you believe it, right?

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.640
You're in such great shape.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.840
She's in such great shape. Beautiful.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.470
You want to achieve your dreams.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.840
I said, "Who the hell wants to speak about politics

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930
when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts?"

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.710
My hands are too big.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.050
Does red -- Does red mean it's on or it's off?

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.560
On.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.560
17,000 jobs.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.310
Hang on. They don't have water.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.420
That's okay. What?

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.280
That's okay.
