CONTINUED EFFORTS TO INFORM THE 
PUBLIC PROTECT THE FIRST 

00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:48.530
AMENDMENT, AND FOSTER A HEALTHY 
DEMOCRACY. WE COULD NOT DO THIS 

00:29:48.827 --> 00:29:50.992
WITHOUT YOU. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE RUSSIAN MILITARY HAS 

00:29:54.884 --> 00:29:57.978
BEGUN THE BRUTAL ASSAULT ON THE 
PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. WITHOUT 

00:29:58.308 --> 00:29:59.439
PROVOCATION, WITHOUT 
JUSTIFICATION, WITHOUT 

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.041
NECESSITY. THIS IS A 
PREMEDITATED ATTACK. PUTIN CHOSE

00:30:03.345 --> 00:30:07.133
THIS WAR. AND NOW, HE AND HIS 
COUNTRY WILL BEAR THE 

00:30:07.427 --> 00:30:09.427
CONSEQUENCES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OMICRON AND ALL THE VARIANTS

00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:13.679
HAVE HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON 
THE PSYCHE OF THE AMERICAN 

00:30:13.976 --> 00:30:16.508
PEOPLE. THE ONLY WAY WE PUT IT 
BEHIND US 

00:30:19.695 --> 00:30:22.750
IS IF MORE AMERICANS GET 
VACCINATED. AND IF WE WERE TO 

00:30:23.047 --> 00:30:25.047
EVER EXPERIENCE UNCHECKED 
INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM, 

00:30:25.161 --> 00:30:27.995
THAT WOULD POSE A REAL CHALLENGE
TO OUR ECONOMY. 

00:30:27.996 --> 00:30:31.779
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MMES. SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:30:36.284 --> 00:30:39.582
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT BIDEN DELIVERS HIS
FIRST STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS

00:30:39.931 --> 00:30:44.337
TONIGHT. IT COMES AMID A WAR IN 
EUROPE. TWO YEARS 

00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:47.721
PANDEMIC AT A TIME WHEN 
AMERICANS ARE WORRIED ABOUT 

00:30:48.001 --> 00:30:50.987
INFLATION AND MONEY. EVEN AS THE
ECONOMY SHOWS SIGNS OF GROWTH 

00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:54.578
AND HEALTH. THIS IS A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM THE NEWSROOM OF THE 

00:30:54.903 --> 00:30:58.627
WASHINGTON POST.  I AM LIBBY 
CASEY. IT IS A CHALLENGING TIME 

00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:02.075
TO ASSESS THE STATE OF THE 
UNION. PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS 

00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.815
TEAM VIEW TONIGHT'S PRIMETIME 
ADDRESS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

00:31:05.138 --> 00:31:07.606
HIGHLIGHT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND 
SET A CLEAR AND OPTIMISTIC 

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.480
AGENDA LEADING TO THE NOVEMBER 
MIDTERMS. BUT, WAR IN UKRAINE 

00:31:10.771 --> 00:31:13.584
HAS SHIPPED DID THE FOCUS OF 
TONIGHT'S SPEECH AND DONATION. 

00:31:13.898 --> 00:31:16.578
WITH ME TONIGHT, RHONDA COLDEN 
ON CAPITOL HILL, JOYCE CO., 

00:31:16.892 --> 00:31:20.295
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. HANNAH 
JEWELL REPORTING ON THE 

00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:23.060
REPUBLICAN RESPONSE AND JAMES 
HOLMAN, HERE IN THE WASHINGTON 

00:31:23.357 --> 00:31:25.868
POST NEWSROOM. LET'S START WITH 
POLITICS REPORTER JOYCE CO., 

00:31:26.172 --> 00:31:29.823
LIGHT OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. 
JOYCE, THE WORLD IS WATCHING. 

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.199
PRESIDENT BIDEN TONIGHT. WHAT IS
AT STAKE IN 

00:31:35.384 --> 00:31:37.384
THIS MOMENT?

00:31:45.393 --> 00:31:49.120
ALL RIGHT. WE WILL GO BACK TO 
JOYCE JUST A MOMENT. PICKING US 

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.232
BACK UP HIS RHONDA COLDEN ON 
CAPITOL HILL. RHONDA, YOU WERE 

00:31:52.522 --> 00:31:56.269
AT THE CENTER OF THE ENERGY AND 
THE ACTION TOOK A LET'S TALK 

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.127
ABOUT FIRST, WHAT IS ON THE LINE
TONIGHT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, AND

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:03.430
THEN, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT 
CAPITOL HILL IS LIKE IN THIS 

00:32:03.752 --> 00:32:07.330
MOMENT. FIRST OFF, WHAT IS IN 
STORE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? 

00:32:07.331 --> 00:32:10.430
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK WHAT IS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IS 

00:32:10.726 --> 00:32:14.407
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO STRIKE A 
BALANCE. STRIKE A BALANCE TO 

00:32:14.704 --> 00:32:17.873
WHERE HE DISCUSSES HIS DOMESTIC 
AGENDA. THE THINGS THAT HAVE 

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.692
PASSED, THE SUCCESSES HIS 
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HAD HER ON 

00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:24.337
THE HILL. WHILE ALSO LOOKING 
FORWARD TO SOME OF THE THINGS HE

00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:27.762
WANTS THE HILL TO ACCOMPLISH IN 
THE SHORT-TERM. AND OF COURSE 

00:32:28.036 --> 00:32:31.728
RIGHT NOW, UKRAINE IS THE NUMBER
1 TOPIC ON THE HILL. THAT IS 

00:32:32.048 --> 00:32:35.408
WHAT IS DOMINATING THE MOOD HERE
TODAY. I RECENTLY SPOKE TO TWO 

00:32:35.712 --> 00:32:38.688
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. DAVIS IS A 

00:32:38.984 --> 00:32:42.209
LENIENCY SARAH JACOBS. THEY WERE
BOTH IN UKRAINE IN JANUARY WHEN 

00:32:42.524 --> 00:32:44.496
THERE WAS A CONGRESSIONAL 
DELEGATION VISITING WITH 

00:32:44.497 --> 00:32:47.466
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND THEY 
SAID, NO DOUBT, UKRAINE NEEDS TO

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.840
BE A FOCUS IN THIS SPEECH THAT 
WE ARE WAITING FOR IN ABOUT AN 

00:32:52.143 --> 00:32:55.680
HOUR. AND SARAH JACOBS, SHE TOLD
ME, THIS IS A DOMESTIC AGENDA. 

00:32:55.993 --> 00:32:59.394
PEOPLE MAY SAY, WELL, BIDEN 
NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE ON SOME OF 

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.227
THESE BIG ISSUES, LIKE 
INFLATION, LIKE A GAS PRICES. 

00:33:02.518 --> 00:33:05.235
BUT TO HER, SHE SAID, HER 
CONSTITUENTS ARE ASKING HER 

00:33:05.553 --> 00:33:09.228
ABOUT THE USE OF THE MILITARY IN
THIS REGION. AND WHAT HAPPENS 

00:33:09.517 --> 00:33:12.571
NEXT. THAT MAKES IT A DOMESTIC 
ISSUE. SO, NUMBERS HERE, THEY 

00:33:12.879 --> 00:33:16.265
WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE NEXT
STEPS ON UKRAINE. WE ARE 

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.142
EXPECTING TO HEAR THAT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT. AND IN TERMS OF JUST 

00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:24.384
SOME LOCAL COLOR HERE AND THE 
MOON, IT IS QUIET WHERE I AM. I 

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:27.711
AM WITH MOST MEMBERS OF THE 
MEDIA WHO ARE BROADCASTING LIVE 

00:33:27.997 --> 00:33:31.355
TONIGHT. USUALLY, WE ARE UP IN 
STATUARY HALL, WHICH IS OF 

00:33:31.636 --> 00:33:34.403
COURSE, NEAR THE HOUSE CHAMBER. 
BECAUSE OF COVERT. BECAUSE OF 

00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:38.136
SECURITY CONCERNS, THAT IS NOT A
PLACE FOR MEDIA RIGHT NOW. SO, 

00:33:38.444 --> 00:33:42.118
WE ARE ALL KIND OF GATHERED 
HERE, TALKING TO MEMBERS AS THEY

00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:45.874
COME BY. IN TERMS OF UKRAINE, 
WHAT YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 

00:33:46.196 --> 00:33:49.386
SEE ONCE WE SEE THE PICTURES 
FROM THE CHAMBER, MANY MEMBERS 

00:33:49.942 --> 00:33:52.375
ARE WEARING RIBBONS AND 
HANDKERCHIEFS, THAT ARE IN THE 

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.680
UKRAINIAN FLAG COLORS OF BLUE 
AND YELLOW. I HAVE SEEN FEMALE 

00:33:55.985 --> 00:34:00.206
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE DRESSED IN 
BLUE AND YELLOW. TO SHOW A SIDE 

00:34:00.527 --> 00:34:04.382
OF SUPPORT. YOU ARE PROBABLY 
GOING TO SEE THAT WHEN WE DO SEE

00:34:04.683 --> 00:34:07.772
THOSE IMAGES OUT OF THE CHAMBER.
THERE IS ALSO SECURITY CONCERNS 

00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:11.194
HERE TONIGHT OF COURSE. OUTSIDE 
THE CAPITAL IS SURROUNDED WITH 

00:34:11.506 --> 00:34:14.611
FENCING. IT IS TEMPORARY. THE 
CHIEF OF THE CAPITOL HILL POLICE

00:34:14.916 --> 00:34:19.035
IS SAYING. IT WILL LAST FOR THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS. IT IS ALSO UP 

00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:21.389
BECAUSE OF ANTICIPATED 
DEMONSTRATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR 

00:34:21.677 --> 00:34:25.048
WITH THE TRUCKER CONVOY THAT WAS
IN CANADA. SO, SECURITY IS TIGHT

00:34:25.343 --> 00:34:28.437
HERE OF COURSE. THE CAPITAL 
POLICE AS WELL AS METRO POLICE 

00:34:28.784 --> 00:34:32.330
ARE SURROUNDING THIS AREA AND NO
ONE IS ACTUALLY ALLOWED IN THE 

00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:37.364
CAPITAL RIGHT NOW. OTHER THAN 
THOSE ATTENDING THOSE SPEECH IN 

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:41.948
JUST A FEW MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA.
THAT IS SORT OF THE MOODY RIGHT 

00:34:42.278 --> 00:34:46.055
NOW. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SEE 
WHEN YOU DO SEE THOSE IMAGES 

00:34:46.374 --> 00:34:49.922
COMING OUT OF THE CHAMBER, YOU 
ARE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING WE 

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.806
HAVE NOT SEEN IN A WHILE, WHICH 
IS, POTENTIALLY MEMBERS WILL BE 

00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:57.208
WEARING MASKS. RIGHT NOW, MASKS 
ARE OPTIONAL ON THE HOUSE FLOOR.

00:34:57.545 --> 00:35:01.277
THAT IS A BIG SHIFT OVER THE 
LAST TWO YEARS. MASKS HAVE BEEN 

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:05.125
REQUIRED. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE 
NOT. THAT IS SOMETHING I AM SURE

00:35:05.433 --> 00:35:08.868
WILL BE TALKED ABOUT ONCE YOU 
START SEEING WHO IS WEARING A 

00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:13.496
MASK, WHO IS NOT WEARING A MASK.
BUT THAT IS ONE SIGN THAT THINGS

00:35:13.781 --> 00:35:16.480
ARE SOMEWHAT RETURNING TO NORMAL
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL. 

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:20.308
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLVIN, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. AS RHONDA LAID OUT FOR US,

00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:23.649
UKRAINE WILL BE A MAJOR FOCUS OF
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH 

00:35:23.954 --> 00:35:26.146
TONIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS AROUND 3:00 IN THE 

00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:30.105
MORNING RIGHT NOW IN KYIV.  I 
WANT TO BRING IN JAMES HOHMANN 

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.727
TO UPDATE US ON THE LATEST 
WASHINGTON POST REPORTING ON THE

00:35:34.058 --> 00:35:36.499
FIGHTING OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.
JAMES.  

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.685
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, IT WAS A DAY OF 
REGROUPING FOR THE RUSSIAN 

00:35:39.986 --> 00:35:42.647
MILITARY. THEY FIRED SEVERAL 
MISSILES THAT KYIV. AIMED FOR 

00:35:42.968 --> 00:35:46.993
THE TV TOWER THAT PROVIDES A LOT
OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE TO THE 

00:35:47.323 --> 00:35:50.471
CAPITAL CITY. THEY HIT THAT, BUT
THEY ALSO HIT A HOLOCAUST 

00:35:50.757 --> 00:35:54.208
MEMORIAL, KILLING FIVE. LOTS OF 
FIERY IMAGES JUST NORTH OF KYIV 

00:35:54.527 --> 00:35:58.287
ON THIS MAJOR ROAD ARTERY. THERE
IS A CONWAY THAT IS 40 MILES 

00:35:58.575 --> 00:36:02.005
LONG. IT'S ABOUT 20 MILES 
OUTSIDE OF KYIV. AS THE SUN IS 

00:36:02.305 --> 00:36:05.237
ABOUT TO ARRIVE IN UKRAINE'S 
CAPITAL, THERE IS FEAR, A 

00:36:05.537 --> 00:36:08.719
POTENTIAL SIEGE OF THIS CITY, 
THAT IS SOMETHING AKIN TO WHAT 

00:36:09.051 --> 00:36:12.583
WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IN RECENT 
DAYS AND THE SECOND BIGGEST CITY

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.526
OF THE COUNTRY, HERE IS KYIV. A 
CITY OF ABOUT 1.5 MILLION 

00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:19.410
PEOPLE. TONIGHT THE MAYOR OF 
HEART KEEP TELLING THE 

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.926
WASHINGTON POST THAT THE CITY IS
SURROUNDED BY RUSSIAN TROOPS BUT

00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:27.117
THAT THE UKRAINIANS ARE STILL IN
CONTROL OF THE CITY ITSELF. A 

00:36:27.405 --> 00:36:30.647
LOT OF THE MOST INTENSE FIGHTING
DURING -- WAS IN THE SOUTHERN 

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.999
PART OF THE COUNTRY. CRIMEA IS 
HERE, WHICH RUSSIA ANNEXED IN 

00:36:34.324 --> 00:36:37.846
2014. MARIO PAUL WHICH IS A 
MAJOR CITY IN THE COUNTRY, STILL

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:40.677
CONTROLLED BY THE UKRAINIAN 
MILITARY. BUT, WE ARE EXPECTING 

00:36:40.986 --> 00:36:44.957
THE RUSSIANS TO MOVE IN FROM 
BOTH THE WEST AND THE EAST IN 

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:48.894
THE COMING DAYS. THERE WAS SOME 
VERY, VERY INTENSE FIGHTING IN 

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.622
THIS AREA. THE RUSSIANS TOOK A 
CITY OF ABOUT 150,000 PEOPLE AND

00:36:52.923 --> 00:36:56.012
THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD 
TOWARD MARY APPALL. THIS IS A 

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:59.289
PRETTY INTENSE CLASH RIGHT NOW. 
AN, AS AS THAT FIGHTING 

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:01.741
CONTINUES, THIS IS INCREASING 
BECOMING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. 

00:37:03.336 --> 00:37:05.336
THIS AFTERNOON. 

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.471
680,000 UKRAINIANS HAVE NOW FLED
THE COUNTRY IN THE 6 DAYS SINCE 

00:37:12.769 --> 00:37:14.769
RUSSIA OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ITS 
INVASION. MORE 

00:37:17.797 --> 00:37:22.945
THAN HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE 
EXITED IN THE POLAND. ALL OF 

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.988
THEM GOING TO THE WEST. 
OBVIOUSLY, THEY CANNOT GO EAST. 

00:37:26.301 --> 00:37:28.845
RUSSIA IS HERE. BELARUS IS 
OBVIOUSLY CLOSELY ALLIED TO 

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:32.837
RUSSIA UP HERE. SO, THEY ALL 
MOVING TO THE WEST. THIS IS 

00:37:33.154 --> 00:37:35.373
BECOMING THE BIGGEST 
DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE IN EUROPE

00:37:35.696 --> 00:37:39.095
SINCE THE BALKAN WARS AND THE 
'90S. IS LOOKING TO BE BIGGER 

00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:43.032
AND THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS IN
2014 AND 2015. AND THESE BORDER 

00:37:43.318 --> 00:37:46.897
CHECKPOINTS, THESE BORDER 
CROSSINGS, ARE QUITE HAIRY, 

00:37:47.215 --> 00:37:49.420
FOLLOWING POLAND, THE SECOND 
BIGGEST INFLUXES GOING INTO 

00:37:49.729 --> 00:37:52.285
HUNGARY. MULLED OVER AND 
MOLDAVIA HUNGARY ARE ALSO 

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.242
GETTING REFUGEES. THERE'S A LOT 
OF PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT BIDEN 

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:01.790
TO GRANT TEMPORARY PROTECTED 
STATUS TO UKRAINIANS, SO THAT 

00:38:02.096 --> 00:38:05.402
ANY UKRAINIAN IN THE UNITED 
STATES DOES NOT HAVE TO GO BACK 

00:38:06.593 --> 00:38:09.333
TO UKRAINE. THE WHITE HOUSE 
EXPECTED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:12.708
ON THAT VERY SOON. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, TAKE US TO THE LATEST 

00:38:12.996 --> 00:38:15.065
INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN 
RESPONSES, AS NOT JUST PRESIDENT

00:38:15.394 --> 00:38:18.514
BIDEN, AS CONGRESS AND AS OTHER 
COUNTRIES GRAPPLE WITH JUST WHAT

00:38:18.828 --> 00:38:21.389
TO DO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS UP

00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:24.909
OUT TO BAN RUSSIAN FLIGHTS FROM 
ENTERING DOMESTIC AIRSPACE 

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.617
FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF CANADA AND
THE EUROPEANS. THE BIG NEWS ON 

00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:34.021
THE RESPONSE FOR TODAY WAS A 
MULTILATERAL COALITION ANNOUNCED

00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:37.642
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE 
60 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL FROM 

00:38:37.935 --> 00:38:40.407
STRATEGIC PER PETROLEUM 
RESERVES. -- WILL COME FROM THE 

00:38:40.711 --> 00:38:43.986
UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO BLUNT 
THE SURGING PRICE OF GASOLINE. 

00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:47.286
THE COMPANY THAT CONTROLS STREAM
TWO, THE PIPELINE CONNECTING 

00:38:47.614 --> 00:38:49.614
GERMANY 

00:38:51.891 --> 00:38:54.635
AND RUSSIA TODAY DECLARED 
BANKRUPTCY AND IS GOING 

00:38:54.935 --> 00:38:57.486
INSOLVENT BECAUSE OF SANCTIONS. 
YOU ARE SEEING MORE COMPANIES 

00:38:57.781 --> 00:39:00.393
LIKE APPLE ANNOUNCE THAT THEY 
WON'T SELL PRODUCTS IN RUSSIA. 

00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:03.076
ANY MORE. AND, THIS AFTERNOON, 
SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY 

00:39:06.683 --> 00:39:09.941
BLINKEN SAID THAT RUSSIA IS 
COMMITTING MORE WAR CRIMES BY 

00:39:10.269 --> 00:39:13.343
THE HOUR, AND SUGGESTED THAT 
RUSSIA BE KICKED OUT OF THE 

00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:16.993
UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS 
COUNCIL. 

00:39:16.994 --> 00:39:20.886
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAMES. 
RHONDA, LET'S GO BACK TO YOU FOR

00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:23.694
SOME OF THE SYMBOLISM OF 
TONIGHT'S SPEECH. YOU KNOW, 

00:39:24.032 --> 00:39:26.289
UKRAINE'S AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED STATES,  OKSANA 

00:39:26.608 --> 00:39:30.231
MARKAROVA, IS GOING TO BE ONE OF
THE FIRST  LADIES GUESTS 

00:39:30.529 --> 00:39:33.792
TONIGHT. WHAT IS THE SYMBOLISM 
AND THE MEANING OF THIS? 

00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:37.504
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: SHE WILL BE 1 OF 9 
GUESTS IN THE FIRST LADIES 

00:39:37.787 --> 00:39:41.063
SECTION. AND THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS INCREDIBLY SYMBOLIC, 

00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:43.408
THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION WANTS

00:39:43.698 --> 00:39:47.311
TO SHOW WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
SAYING ALL ALONG, IS THAT THEY 

00:39:47.612 --> 00:39:50.952
ARE STANDING WITH UKRAINE. SO, 
HAVING HER HERE, IN THE CHAMBER 

00:39:51.249 --> 00:39:54.930
AND YOU CAN EXPECT LIKELY THAT 
THERE WILL BE A POSITIVE SHE IS 

00:39:55.231 --> 00:39:58.369
ASKED TO STAND. THAT IS GOING TO
BE VISUALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT 

00:39:58.707 --> 00:40:02.141
MOMENT. A VERY POIGNANT MOMENT. 
AND WILL SHOW SORT OF THE 

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:05.315
DIRECTION AND THE MIND-SET RIGHT
NOW OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:09.604
AS THEY TAKE ON THIS CRISIS. AND
AS I SAID EARLIER, UKRAINE IS 

00:40:09.888 --> 00:40:12.942
CERTAINLY A CENTERPIECE RIGHT 
NOW IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE 

00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:16.162
HILL. THERE IS DISCUSSION RIGHT 
NOW ABOUT A POTENTIAL AID 

00:40:16.472 --> 00:40:19.859
PACKAGE, A $10 BILLION AID 
PACKAGE THAT THE SENATE MAY BE 

00:40:20.187 --> 00:40:23.065
CONSIDERING SOON THAT WOULD HELP
WITH EFFORTS IN THE UKRAINE. 

00:40:23.392 --> 00:40:25.841
THEY ARE ALSO DIRECTING THEIR 
ATTENTION TO THE HUMANITARIAN 

00:40:26.167 --> 00:40:28.722
ISSUES RIGHT NOW JAMES JUST 
MENTIONED TO THE TEMPORARY 

00:40:29.028 --> 00:40:34.323
PROTECTED STATUS. THAT IS 
SOMETHING I DON'T MEMBERS OF THE

00:40:34.629 --> 00:40:37.136
UKRAINIAN CONGRESSIONAL CONGRESS
ARE PUSHING FOR RIGHT NOW TO 

00:40:37.442 --> 00:40:40.511
MAKE SURE ANYONE LEAVING UKRAINE
IS PROTECTED. AGAIN, BY HAVING 

00:40:40.845 --> 00:40:46.233
THAT AMBASSADOR HERE, DURING 
THIS SPEECH THAT IS USUALLY 

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:49.046
RESERVED FOR A PRESIDENT TO 
DISCUSS HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA, 

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.301
THAT IS GOING TO BE A REALLY 
IMPORTANT MOMENT TO WATCH FOR. 

00:40:54.616 --> 00:40:57.277
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; POLITICS REPORTER, JOYCE KOH
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. TRUST, 

00:40:57.606 --> 00:41:00.300
TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW PRESIDENT
BIDEN IS APPROACHING TONIGHT'S 

00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:02.859
HIGH-PROFILE SPEECH.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: LIBBY, EARLIER 

00:41:03.159 --> 00:41:06.334
DRAFTS OF THE STATE OF THE UNION
SPEECH LOOKED MUCH DIFFERENT 

00:41:06.662 --> 00:41:09.453
JUST WEEKS AGO. THEN IT WILL 
TONIGHT WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN 

00:41:09.775 --> 00:41:14.532
DELIVERS HIS FIRST STATE OF THE 
UNION 

00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:19.905
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT, NOT JUST 
DOMESTIC ISSUES, BUT OF COURSE, 

00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:23.370
WHAT IS HAPPENING ABROAD IN 
UKRAINE. YOU KNOW, USUALLY, THIS

00:41:23.674 --> 00:41:27.032
IS A SPEECH THAT IS GIVEN TO A 
DOMESTIC AUDIENCE. JUST, THE 

00:41:27.343 --> 00:41:30.178
PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. BUT 
TONIGHT, IT WILL REALLY HAVE 

00:41:30.497 --> 00:41:33.728
EYES GLOBALLY, AS WORLD LEADERS 
AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE 

00:41:34.064 --> 00:41:37.477
LOOKING TO PRESIDENT BIDEN TO 
SEE HOW HE LEADS IN THIS MOMENT.

00:41:37.808 --> 00:41:41.203
WE DID RECEIVE SOME EXCERPTS 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE OF WHAT HE 

00:41:41.508 --> 00:41:45.185
WILL BE STAYING TONIGHT AND 
PART. AND I WANTED TO READ SOME 

00:41:45.504 --> 00:41:49.272
OF THESE TO YOU. HE IS GOING TO 
BE TONIGHT URGING CONGRESS TO 

00:41:49.571 --> 00:41:54.371
FIGHT INFLATION. REALLY, TRY TO 
TIE IN THE MESSAGING ON UKRAINE 

00:41:54.646 --> 00:41:56.880
TO UNDERSCORE AMERICAN 
PRIORITIES. SO, ON THE ECONOMY, 

00:41:57.238 --> 00:42:00.895
HE IS GOING TO URGE CONGRESS TO 
"LOWER YOUR COST COMMON LAW NOT 

00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:04.638
YOUR WAGES. REALLY TOUCHING ON 
THIS $15 AN HOUR FEDERAL MINIMUM

00:42:04.934 --> 00:42:09.497
WAGE THAT HE WANTS CONGRESS TO 
PASS. HE IS ALSO GOING TO 

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.052
"MAKE MORE CARS IN 
SEMICONDUCTORS IN AMERICA. MORE 

00:42:14.354 --> 00:42:16.354
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INNOVATION 

00:42:18.555 --> 00:42:21.367
IN AMERICA AS HE TOUTS HIS 
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THAT 

00:42:21.644 --> 00:42:24.977
BIPARTISAN BILL THAT HE SIGNED 
INTO LAW BACK IN NOVEMBER. AND 

00:42:25.284 --> 00:42:29.522
HE ALSO, THERE IS A PART OF THIS
EXCERPT THAT SAYS "MORE JOBS 

00:42:29.827 --> 00:42:33.291
WHERE YOU CAN EARN A GOOD LIVING
IN AMERICA. INSTEAD OF RELYING 

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:37.325
ON FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAINS, LET'S 
MAKE IT IN AMERICA. SO, THIS IS 

00:42:37.637 --> 00:42:40.134
REALLY PRESIDENT BIDEN, TALKING 
ABOUT AND ADDRESSING WHAT IS 

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.152
HAPPENING IN UKRAINE, BOTH IN 
TERMS OF ESTABLISHING A 

00:42:49.572 --> 00:42:54.215
DEMOCRACY THERE, AND SUPPORTING 
THE DEMOCRACY, I SHOULD 

00:42:55.431 --> 00:42:58.277
ALSO REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY AND HOW THIS COULD 

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.191
POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE AMERICANS 
HERE AT HOME, AND REALLY URGING 

00:43:01.519 --> 00:43:07.833
CONGRESS TO ACT ON THESE ISSUES,
TO BOLSTER THE U.S. ECONOMY AND 

00:43:08.148 --> 00:43:11.592
MAKE THINGS HERE IN AMERICA. 
THIS IS A SENTIMENT THAT WE HAVE

00:43:11.898 --> 00:43:15.221
HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT OVER THE 
COURSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY IN THIS

00:43:15.539 --> 00:43:20.070
FIRST YEAR. SO, THAT IS A BIT OF
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT TO HEAR FROM 

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:21.974
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH 
TONIGHT. LIBBY? 

00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:25.322
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO 
REPORTER HANNAH JEWELL TO TALK 

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:28.203
ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS ARE 
APPROACHING THE STATE OF THE 

00:43:28.525 --> 00:43:31.614
UNION. HANNAH, TONIGHT IS THE 
PRESIDENTS, BUT IT IS ALSO ONE 

00:43:31.932 --> 00:43:35.521
TO WATCH THE REACTIONS IN THE 
HOUSE CHAMBER TO GET A SENSE OF 

00:43:35.815 --> 00:43:38.840
NATIONAL UNITY AND IN MANY 
CASES, DIVISION. WHAT WILL YOU 

00:43:39.137 --> 00:43:41.267
BE WATCHING FOR? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS RHONDA JUST MENTIONED, 

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.669
LIBBY, THE MASKS ARE GOING TO 
SEE BE A REALLY INTERESTING 

00:43:44.986 --> 00:43:48.538
VISUAL SYMBOL OF THE DIVISION IN
THIS COUNTRY. AS YOU MENTIONED 

00:43:49.006 --> 00:43:52.225
EARLIER, YOU KNOW, IT IS NO 
LONGER REQUIRED TO WEAR MASKS IN

00:43:52.553 --> 00:43:56.207
THE HOUSE. I IMAGINE THAT WE ARE
GOING TO SEE PERHAPS THEY START 

00:43:56.522 --> 00:43:59.492
A FIGHT BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND 
DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER 

00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:02.549
TOOK A SHOWING THAT 
POLITICIZATION AND THE DIVISION 

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:08.115
AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE 
HAVE WITNESSED OVER THE LAST 2 

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:11.717
YEARS. BUT BEYOND THAT, LIBBY, 
THE STATE OF THE UNION PROVIDES 

00:44:12.038 --> 00:44:15.134
SUCH A FASCINATING TIME TO SEE 
WHERE EVERYONE STANDS ON CERTAIN

00:44:15.415 --> 00:44:22.206
ISSUES BY WHAT THEY DO WITH 
THEIR BODIES. DO THEY STAND, TO 

00:44:22.533 --> 00:44:25.894
THE CLOCK, TO THE RESOLUTELY SIT
DOWN WITH HER ARMS FOLDED YOU 

00:44:26.223 --> 00:44:29.845
SORT OF YOU KNOW, SCOWLING. THIS
IS A MOMENT FOR EVERY MEMBER OF 

00:44:30.404 --> 00:44:32.924
CONGRESS TO REALLY SHOW AND 
EXPRESS THEIR PLEASURE OR 

00:44:33.218 --> 00:44:35.420
DISPLEASURE. I AM PARTICULARLY 
INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW 

00:44:35.755 --> 00:44:38.848
REPUBLICANS REACT TO BIDEN'S 
EXPECTED COMMENTS OF UKRAINE. WE

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.825
HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DIVISION, AND
INDEED, SOME PIVOTS AND PUP 

00:44:43.128 --> 00:44:45.288
REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTS ABOUT 
UKRAINE AND ABOUT PUTIN'S 

00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:48.761
INVASION OF THIS COUNTRY. OVER 
THE LAST WEEK, EVEN, AS THE 

00:44:49.071 --> 00:44:52.195
INVASION HAS GOTTEN WORSE. WILL 
BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THEY 

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.219
ARE WILLING TO SET IT UP FOR AND
WHAT THEY ARE. EVEN IF WE DO SEE

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.983
MOMENTS OF UNITY WHICH EVERYBODY
IN THE CHAMBER IS STANDING UP TO

00:45:01.304 --> 00:45:03.600
APPLAUD BIDEN'S EXPECTED PRAISE 
FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY OF 

00:45:03.929 --> 00:45:05.834
UKRAINE, THERE UKRAINIAN 
RESISTANCE FIGHTERS, THERE 

00:45:05.835 --> 00:45:08.680
CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE THAT KIND 
OF UNITY AROUND REPUBLICAN 

00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:12.250
REACTIONS TO HOW THEY THINK, YOU
KNOW, BIDEN IS HANDLING THIS 

00:45:12.539 --> 00:45:14.539
CRISIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PAST WEEK I CERTAINLY 

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:18.270
SHIFTED WITH THE PRESIDENT PLANS
TO SAY. TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW 

00:45:18.545 --> 00:45:21.352
IT IS SHIFTING THE REPUBLICANS 
APPROACH AS WELL, HANNAH. 

00:45:21.353 --> 00:45:24.881
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: AS I SAID, THERE 
HAS BEEN THIS KIND OF 

00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:28.521
FASCINATING THING TO WATCH IN 
REAL TIME OVER THE LAST WEEK WE 

00:45:28.798 --> 00:45:31.598
HAD FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP LAST 
WEEK CALLING PUTIN A GENIUS, 

00:45:31.924 --> 00:45:35.638
SAYING HE WAS REALLY SMART FOR 
GETTING AWAY WITH THIS AT THIS 

00:45:35.963 --> 00:45:38.552
TIME. WITH ONLY WHAT TRUMP 
CHARACTERIZED AS SOME MINOR 

00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:41.687
SANCTIONS. THAT IS NOT HOW, OF 
COURSE, THE PRESIDENT WOULD 

00:45:42.313 --> 00:45:45.518
CHARACTERIZE IT. SO, YOU REALLY 
SAW THAT STARTING POINT. YOU 

00:45:45.797 --> 00:45:48.640
HAD, YOU KNOW, FOX NEWS HOST 
TUCKER CARLSON, LAURA INGRAM, 

00:45:48.957 --> 00:45:51.748
TALKING, EVEN SORT OF MAKING FUN
OF PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY. INGRAM 

00:45:52.054 --> 00:45:55.617
BASICALLY CALLED IT A PATHETIC 
DISPLAY, HIS SPEECH WHERE HE WAS

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.424
BEGGING PUTIN NOT TO INVADE. YOU
HAD THAT LINE. YOU HAD TRUMP 

00:45:59.728 --> 00:46:03.191
SAYING THIS. AND THEN AS THE 
INVASION WAS, YOU SAW SORT OF 

00:46:03.515 --> 00:46:06.987
THE PIVOT. YOU SAW A REPUBLICAN 
SORT OF CONGRESS PEOPLE LEADERS,

00:46:07.322 --> 00:46:09.912
INDEED TUCKER CARLSON HIMSELF, 
TRUMP HIMSELF, BEGIN TO MORE 

00:46:10.223 --> 00:46:13.309
RESOLUTELY, MORE CLEARLY, 
CONDEMN PUTIN. THE OTHER THE 

00:46:13.611 --> 00:46:16.760
PUBLIC AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, 
NOT WILLING TO ALSO CRITICIZE 

00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:20.202
TRUMP'S PRIOR COMMENTS ON THIS. 
BUT, YOU SAW THE SHIFT HAPPENING

00:46:20.513 --> 00:46:24.232
AS YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY IS SORT OF TRYING TO FIND 

00:46:24.752 --> 00:46:28.524
ITS LINE ON THIS. YOU HAD SEE 
PACK LAST WEEKEND WHERE YOU HAD 

00:46:28.814 --> 00:46:31.940
APPLAUSE FOR, YOU KNOW, SUPPORT 
FOR UKRAINE AND WHAT YOU HAVE 

00:46:32.286 --> 00:46:35.763
SEEN START TO EMERGE IS THE WAY 
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO 

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:38.523
SORT OF SHAPE THEIR CRITIQUES 
ABIDED FOREIGN-POLICY. YOU KNOW,

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:41.607
THEY CAME INTO THIS NIGHT, READY
TO CRITIQUE BIDEN'S DOMESTIC 

00:46:41.942 --> 00:46:45.515
AGENDA, BUT EVEN AS BIDEN IS 
BEGINNING TO PIVOT, SO TOO, THE 

00:46:45.816 --> 00:46:48.890
REPUBLICANS AND THE CRITICISM 
ARE GOING TO TRY AND BLAME THIS 

00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:51.730
CRISIS ON HIM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WAS ON MOMENT AGO, HANNAH, 

00:46:52.056 --> 00:46:56.194
THAT FENCING THAT IS UP AROUND 
THE CAPITAL AND IT WAS PUT UP, 

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.644
AND THE WORDS OF THE U.S. 
CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF, TO PREVENT

00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:02.479
ANY DISRUPTION TO THE WORK OF 
CONGRESS. CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.780
THAT PLAN PROTESTS AROUND 
WASHINGTON AGAINST COVERED 

00:47:04.993 --> 00:47:08.192
RESTRICTIONS THIS WEEK. TELL US 
MORE ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS ARE 

00:47:08.502 --> 00:47:11.390
RESPONDING TO THIS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU SEE THAT FENCING THAT WAS

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.534
PUT UP WITH DC NOT WANTING TO 
SEE ANOTHER JANUARY 6th. AND YOU

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:19.871
SEE THIS PERCUSSIONS OVER WHAT 
HAD PLANTED TO BE A RALLY ON THE

00:47:20.211 --> 00:47:23.684
MALL TODAY, WHICH ACTUALLY 
TURNED OUT TO BE KIND OF A BUST.

00:47:24.018 --> 00:47:28.040
THERE WAS A STAGE SET UP FOR A 
SORT OF FREEDOM RALLY THAT 

00:47:28.371 --> 00:47:31.886
DIDN'T HAPPEN. YOU HAVE SEEN 
ALSO, THERE IS MEANT TO BE A 

00:47:32.204 --> 00:47:36.052
TRUCKER CONVOY THAT IS STILL ON 
HIS WAY, INSPIRED BY THOSE IN 

00:47:36.379 --> 00:47:39.414
CANADA. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE 
AROUND INDIANA. THEY ARE MEANT 

00:47:39.746 --> 00:47:43.223
TO GET HERE FRIDAY OR SATURDAY. 
IT IS VERY UNCLEAR WHAT THEY 

00:47:43.558 --> 00:47:48.018
PLAN TO DO ONCE THEY GET HERE. 
AND, THEY HAVE ALSO ACTUALLY THE

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.161
PLANNERS OF THAT CONVOY, HAVE 
KIND OF BEEN COMPLAINING IN 

00:47:51.476 --> 00:47:54.344
THEIR CHAT ROOMS AS OUR 
REPORTING HAS TALKED ABOUT, THAT

00:47:54.653 --> 00:47:57.406
UKRAINE IS DISTRACTING FROM THE 
CAUSE AND THEIR CAUSES COVERED 

00:47:57.743 --> 00:47:59.743
RESTRICTIONS, AND A COVERED 
RESTRICTIONS, ANTI-VACCINE 

00:47:59.845 --> 00:48:04.006
MANDATES, MASKS AND SO ON. YOU 
CAN SEE THEM TRYING TO PUSH BACK

00:48:04.322 --> 00:48:07.786
AGAINST THAT, BUT ALSO HAVING 
THE WINDS SORT OF TAKEN OUT OF 

00:48:08.057 --> 00:48:10.519
THEIR SALES BY THE WAR IN 
EUROPE. 

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.440
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAD A 
JEWEL, WE WILL BE CHECKING IN 

00:48:14.755 --> 00:48:17.264
LATER ON ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN 
RESPONSE, WHICH WILL BE 

00:48:17.581 --> 00:48:20.573
DELIVERED RESPONSE, THAT WILL BE
DELIVERED BY THE GOVERNOR OF 

00:48:20.872 --> 00:48:22.892
IOWA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO THAT WHITE HOUSE 

00:48:23.213 --> 00:48:25.762
REPORTER LEAVE WOODSON. CLEVE, 
YOU HAVE BEEN TRACKING HOW 

00:48:26.091 --> 00:48:28.260
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE
FEELING ABOUT HIS JOB 

00:48:28.577 --> 00:48:31.608
PERFORMANCE, FEELING ABOUT THE 
STATE OF THE NATION. WHAT DOES 

00:48:31.907 --> 00:48:35.130
HE NEED TO DO TONIGHT TO EXCITE 
AND SATISFY THOSE SUPPORTERS? 

00:48:35.453 --> 00:48:39.739
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT. GOOD TO SEE YOU, LIBBY. 
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I

00:48:40.034 --> 00:48:44.109
THINK IS WHAT CAN BIDEN DO? YOU 
KNOW, I TALKED TO A LOT OF 

00:48:44.439 --> 00:48:47.927
SUPPORTERS WHO SAID, YOU KNOW, 
THEY SEE WHAT BIDEN IS DOING ON 

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.967
PANDEMIC, EVEN VACCINES, EVEN 
HIS RECENT ACTIONS ON UKRAINE. 

00:48:51.268 --> 00:48:54.041
BUT, WHEN THEY TALK TO THE 
REPUBLICAN FRIENDS, OR EVEN 

00:48:54.344 --> 00:48:57.242
THEIR MODERATE FRIENDS, THAT IS 
NOT SORT OF BREAKING THROUGH. 

00:48:57.566 --> 00:49:00.952
RIGHT? YOU HAVE SEEN BIDEN TALK 
ABOUT THIS SOMETIMES, TOO. HOW 

00:49:01.274 --> 00:49:05.081
HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE
ACTIONS THAT WE ARE DOING. BUT 

00:49:05.403 --> 00:49:08.660
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE AREN'T HEARING 
IT OR UNDERSTANDING IT AND IT 

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.409
NEEDS TO MAKE THAT CASE BETTER. 
SO, WHAT I THINK WE WILL SEE AS 

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.906
BIDEN SORT OF MAKING THE CASE 
THAT, DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN 

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:21.837
PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT I AM DOING.
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE. THIS 

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.977
IS WHAT I WANTED TO. IN THE 
FUTURE. YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION 

00:49:26.306 --> 00:49:29.493
IS, THE PRESIDENT WITH AN 
APPROVAL RATING OF 37%, WITH 

00:49:29.813 --> 00:49:32.649
PEOPLE HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT 
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS, WILL THAT

00:49:32.957 --> 00:49:36.476
EVEN PERMEATE THROUGH, YOU KNOW,
TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE,

00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:39.308
YOU KNOW, EITHER NEGATIVE OR 
LUKEWARM OPINIONS ABOUT THE 

00:49:39.634 --> 00:49:41.634
PRESIDENT ALREADY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S IGNORE SOME OTHER 

00:49:42.095 --> 00:49:44.962
APPROVAL RATINGS WITH JAMES 
HOMAN. HE IS LOOKING OUT THE 

00:49:45.271 --> 00:49:48.088
LATEST POLL NUMBERS FROM A 
WASHINGTON POST ABC WOULD NEWS. 

00:49:48.413 --> 00:49:51.241
JAMES, TELL US MORE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS CLEVE MENTIONED, THE 

00:49:51.533 --> 00:49:53.901
PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING, 
37%. 55% OF THE COUNTRY 

00:49:54.192 --> 00:49:56.362
DISAPPROVES OF BIDEN. THESE 
NUMBERS ARE REMARKABLY SIMILAR 

00:49:56.663 --> 00:49:59.741
TO WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS ONE 
YEAR INTO HIS PRESIDENCY. AND, 

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:04.023
IT IS NOT A GOOD TRENDLINE FOR 
PRESIDENT BIDEN. YOU CAN SEE HE 

00:50:04.321 --> 00:50:07.576
CAME INTO THE OFFICE IN THE 
MID-FIFTH THESE. AND HE HAS 

00:50:07.896 --> 00:50:10.684
FALLEN IN EVERY SINGLE 
WASHINGTON POST ABC POLL. HE IS 

00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:14.605
NOW DOWN AT HIS ALL-TIME LOW. 
THAT'S WHY THE SPEECH IS SO 

00:50:14.925 --> 00:50:18.073
IMPORTANT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST 
AUDIENCE RIDE AND WILL GET OF 

00:50:18.385 --> 00:50:22.084
THE YEAR. AND, WHEN YOU TALK TO 
FOLKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU 

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:26.064
WILL NOTICE GOING BACK TO THE 
TRENDLINE, ONE OF THE REASONS IT

00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:29.024
REALLY FELL LAST SUMMER WAS 
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:32.396
AFGHANISTAN. AND THAT WE CAN 
LOOK AT WHAT IMPACT IT HAD, 

00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:36.351
WHICH IS, PERCEPTIONS OF BIDEN 
AS A STRONG LEADER. THIS TOOK A 

00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:39.446
HUGE HIT. THEY HAVE NOT 
RECOVERED. YOU WOULD EXPECT 

00:50:39.772 --> 00:50:42.591
DURING AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS, 
THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND OF 

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.991
RALLY AROUND THE FLAG EFFECT, 
THAT PEOPLE WOULD, KIND OF 

00:50:46.307 --> 00:50:49.114
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. THE 
PROBLEM FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IS 

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:53.563
THAT ONLY 36%, ABOUT THE SAME AS
THINK THAT HE IS DOING A GOOD 

00:50:53.869 --> 00:50:57.851
JOB, THINK THAT HE IS STRONG AS 
A LEADER. MUCH WORSE, TWO THIRDS

00:50:58.148 --> 00:51:00.880
OF INDEPENDENCE DON'T THINK THAT
THE PRESIDENT IS A STRONG 

00:51:01.197 --> 00:51:04.288
LEADER. BUT, THE NEXT RESULT 
FROM OUR POLL WHICH WE RELEASED 

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:07.325
OVER THE WEEKEND, IS MORE 
TROUBLING FOR THE BIDEN 

00:51:07.649 --> 00:51:10.387
ADMINISTRATION. THOSE JOE BIDEN 
HAVE THE MENTAL SHARPNESS TO BE 

00:51:10.718 --> 00:51:13.641
PRESIDENT? 54% OF AMERICANS SAY 
NO. 59% OF INDEPENDENTS SAY NO. 

00:51:13.925 --> 00:51:18.299
WE ASKED THIS QUESTION IN A POLL
IN MAY 2020 AND THE NUMBERS WERE

00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:21.393
REVERSED. MAJORITY OF AMERICANS 
THOUGHT BIDEN DID HAVE THE 

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.494
MENTAL SHARPNESS. ONE OF THE 
TESTS FOR THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT.

00:51:24.806 --> 00:51:29.452
HE IS TALKING FOR AN HOUR. WILL 
HE CONVEY THAT HE IS A MAN IN 

00:51:29.772 --> 00:51:32.859
CHARGE WITH HIS HANDS ON THE 
STEERING WHEEL? THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:51:33.167 --> 00:51:37.448
EASES AS ONE OF THE NUMBERS THEY
REALLY WANT TO MOVE. 

00:51:37.449 --> 00:51:41.207
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAMES. 
CLEVE, LET'S GO BACK TO YOU FOR 

00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:44.273
THAT THINKING APPROVAL NUMBER 
THAT WE SAW FROM JAMES, THAT 

00:51:44.562 --> 00:51:47.858
ARC. WHEN YOU TALKED TO VOTERS, 
HOW MUCH WERE THEY THINKING 

00:51:48.177 --> 00:51:50.354
ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY, VERSUS 
THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES 

00:51:50.659 --> 00:51:54.428
OF THE PANDEMIC? AND THE LAST 
YEAR PLUS OF THE LIVES? 

00:51:54.429 --> 00:51:58.609
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EPIC IT IS ACTUALLY A MIX OF 
BOTH. RIGHT? BECAUSE WE TALKED 

00:51:58.886 --> 00:52:02.053
TO THESE VOTERS OVER THE PAST 
WEEK, AS THE BIGGEST HEADLINE 

00:52:02.379 --> 00:52:05.704
WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN 
UKRAINE. AND WHETHER BIDEN WAS A

00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:08.267
COMPETENT LEADER, WHETHER HIS 
FOREIGN-POLICY BONA FIDES WERE 

00:52:08.566 --> 00:52:11.667
GOOD ENOUGH TO GET US THROUGH. 
ONE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE, 

00:52:11.981 --> 00:52:15.752
THE THING AT THE TOP OF THE 
WASHINGTON POST OR ON CNN OR 

00:52:16.053 --> 00:52:18.465
WHATEVER, YOU KNOW, DON'T 
NECESSARILY ALWAYS REFLECT WHAT 

00:52:18.769 --> 00:52:21.598
AN INDIVIDUAL VOTER IS THINKING 
ABOUT HIS OR HER INDIVIDUAL 

00:52:21.901 --> 00:52:25.095
LIVES. PEOPLE WILL STILL IN 
DURING THE AFTER EFFECTS OR THE 

00:52:25.423 --> 00:52:27.812
EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. THEY 
ARE STILL DEALING WITH 

00:52:28.323 --> 00:52:31.866
INFLATION. WE ARE HYPER ATTUNED 
TO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. MANY

00:52:32.205 --> 00:52:35.927
OF US HAD MADE POPCORN AND WE 
ARE PREPARED TO WATCH THE SPEECH

00:52:36.256 --> 00:52:39.661
END-TO-END. MOST PEOPLE ARE KIND
OF LIVING AND ENDURING THEIR OWN

00:52:39.976 --> 00:52:43.207
LIVES. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT, 
YOU KNOW, WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN 

00:52:43.518 --> 00:52:46.592
DOES OR SAYS TONIGHT MAY NOT 
HAVE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT, AS 

00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:54.234
MUCH AS IT GOES INTO PEOPLE'S 
GENERAL PERCEPTION OF HOW 

00:52:54.841 --> 00:52:57.937
PRESIDENT IS, HOW HE IS 
BEHAVING, WHAT HE IS GOOD AT, 

00:52:58.233 --> 00:53:02.431
WHAT HE IS NOT GOOD AT. IT IS 
JUST A MIX. PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, 

00:53:02.716 --> 00:53:06.177
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT UKRAINE AT 
THE FOREFRONT OF A LOT OF 

00:53:06.488 --> 00:53:09.555
PEOPLE'S MINDS. BUT SO IS HOW 
MUCH GAS COSTS. SO WAS

00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:19.814
, YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH STUFF COST 
AT THE GROCERIES. WHETHER THE 

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:23.569
CHILDREN HAVE TO WEAR MASKS TO 
SCHOOL. ALL OF THE FACTORS IN. 

00:53:23.864 --> 00:53:27.616
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CLEVE, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
OF THE SPEECH HAS TO BE 

00:53:27.895 --> 00:53:31.243
DELIVERED, ANY BIG SPEECH LIKE 
THIS, HAS TO BE DELIVERED WITH A

00:53:31.578 --> 00:53:34.673
LOT OF CONFIDENCE. YOU KNOW, 
HITTING THE RIGHT LINES AT THE 

00:53:34.996 --> 00:53:38.072
RIGHT MOMENT. KNOWING WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO APPLY. THIS 

00:53:38.361 --> 00:53:42.131
HAS BEEN A SPEECH IN MOTION. HOW
CHALLENGING IS IT THAT IT'S BEEN

00:53:42.446 --> 00:53:45.481
GOING TO REWRITES AND REVAMPS? 
IT HASN'T HAD THAT TIME TO 

00:53:45.785 --> 00:53:49.573
REALLY SORT OF GET CRAFT GOOD 
AND AGE IN THE PRESIDENTS MIND 

00:53:49.866 --> 00:53:52.202
AND MOUTH OVER THIS PAST WEEK OR
SO. 

00:53:52.203 --> 00:53:56.167
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT. I MEAN I THINK YOU HIT IT
EXACTLY. ON THE HEAD. THE 

00:53:56.486 --> 00:53:59.591
SPEECH, AS IN -- ENVISIONED BY 
THE EARLIEST SPEECHWRITERS TWO 

00:53:59.895 --> 00:54:03.092
WEEKS AGO MIGHT BE VASTLY 
DIFFERENT. IN FACT, SOME OF MY 

00:54:03.403 --> 00:54:06.547
COLLEAGUES IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
HAVE SOME REPORTING THAT IT WAS 

00:54:06.858 --> 00:54:10.522
BEING CRAFTED OVER AND OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN. NOW, I THINK THE 

00:54:10.842 --> 00:54:14.003
WHITE HOUSE HOPES THAT, YOU 
KNOW, THOSE REWRITES WILL APPEAL

00:54:14.282 --> 00:54:16.755
TO MORE TO BIDEN'S STRENGTHS, 
RIGHT? IMPROVEMENT ON THE 

00:54:17.094 --> 00:54:19.437
PANDEMIC FRONT. YOU KNOW, 
AMERICANS BEHIND THE SANCTIONS, 

00:54:19.754 --> 00:54:22.758
OR PUNISHING PUTIN OVER ITS 
INVASION OF UKRAINE. BUT, YOU 

00:54:23.083 --> 00:54:27.305
KNOW, FOR A SPEECH THAT HAS TO 
DO A LOT, AND, YOU ALSO HAVE TO 

00:54:27.632 --> 00:54:30.937
THINK ABOUT THIS SPEECH AS 
SETTING THE TONE FOR THE NEXT 

00:54:31.254 --> 00:54:33.450
EIGHT MONTHS. YOU KNOW. MOST 
MODERATES OR INDEPENDENTS, 

00:54:33.746 --> 00:54:37.080
ACCORDING TO OUR POLL, DON'T 
REALLY APPROVE OF THE JOB THE 

00:54:37.393 --> 00:54:40.945
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING. SO, WHAT 
BIDEN IS TRYING TO SAY TO THE 

00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:44.721
AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND TO HIS 
PARTY, IS, WE ARE DOING A GOOD 

00:54:45.042 --> 00:54:48.147
JOB. AND, THIS IS WHY YOU 
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY 

00:54:48.448 --> 00:54:51.309
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT US, BUT 
ALSO, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT 

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:54.675
KEEPING US IN POWER IN NOVEMBER,
EIGHT MONTHS FROM NOW. 

00:54:54.676 --> 00:54:58.098
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANKS, CLEVE. LET'S BRING 
JOYCE KOH BACK IN. SHE IS 

00:54:58.441 --> 00:55:01.854
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. TRUST, 
TALK ABOUT BIDEN'S FIRST YEAR IN

00:55:02.162 --> 00:55:04.979
OFFICE AND SOME OF THE KEY 
MOMENTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION 

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.398
HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH, SOME OF 
THE HIGHLIGHTS THAT HAVE LED TO 

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.899
TONIGHT'S ADDRESS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW, LIBBY, PRESIDENT 

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:15.936
BIDEN HAS, YOU KNOW, RAN ON THIS
MESSAGE OF UNITY. HE HAS INFUSED

00:55:16.263 --> 00:55:20.177
UNITY INTO A NUMBER OF HIS KEY 
SPEECHES OVER THE COURSE OF THIS

00:55:20.478 --> 00:55:23.748
LAST YEAR. BUT TONIGHT, HE WILL 
BE SPEAKING TO, BY MANY 

00:55:24.045 --> 00:55:26.576
INDICATIONS, A DIVIDED NATION. 
NATION THAT IS DIVIDED ON THINGS

00:55:26.845 --> 00:55:28.994
LIKE THE PANDEMIC, THE POLITICS 
SURROUNDING THE PANDEMIC ON 

00:55:29.271 --> 00:55:31.943
SOCIAL ISSUES LIKE RACE 
RELATIONS. AND HIS IMMEDIATE 

00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:34.415
AUDIENCE, CONGAS, IS REFLECTIVE 
OF THIS. REPUBLICANS AND 

00:55:34.726 --> 00:55:37.524
DEMOCRATS, AND EVEN MEMBERS OF 
HIS OWN PARTY, AND THE 

00:55:37.821 --> 00:55:40.334
INFIGHTING THERE THAT HAS 
DIVIDED, REALLY, THE SPLIT IN 

00:55:40.649 --> 00:55:44.366
CONGRESS, WHERE THEY WERE WERE 
ABLE TO GET KEY AGENDA ITEMS OF 

00:55:44.699 --> 00:55:47.568
BIDEN'S ADMINISTRATION PASSED 
JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. SO,

00:55:48.205 --> 00:55:50.205
LOOKING BACK AT THE BIDEN 
ADMINISTRATION EVERYTHING 

00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:53.197
STARTED, BIDEN'S INAUGURATION 
BACK IN JANUARY OF 2021 WAS 

00:55:53.503 --> 00:55:56.363
REALLY JUST TRIUMPHANT FEET FOR 
DEMOCRACY. IT HAPPENED JUST TWO 

00:55:56.681 --> 00:55:59.532
WEEKS AFTER THE JANUARY 6th 
INSURRECTION AT THE CAPITAL. AND

00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:02.038
THEN, HE HAD A PRETTY HUGE 
LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT 

00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:05.438
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, WITH THE 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, WHICH WAS 

00:56:05.777 --> 00:56:09.771
AT $1.9 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS 
RELIEF PACKAGE. THAT HE SIGNED 

00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:13.624
INTO LAW TO REALLY BOOST THE 
ECONOMY AND HELP FAMILIES THAT 

00:56:13.956 --> 00:56:17.979
WERE STRUGGLING FOLLOWING THE 
CORONAVIRUS. AND THEN, HE SAW 

00:56:18.306 --> 00:56:21.165
POLL NUMBERS AND HIS APPROVAL 
RATINGS SLIP DURING THE SUMMER 

00:56:21.456 --> 00:56:23.456
WHEN 

00:56:25.753 --> 00:56:28.777
HE RESPONDED TO THE TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL IN AFGHANISTAN AS 

00:56:29.083 --> 00:56:32.150
SORT OF THE WAY THAT HE WENT 
ABOUT THAT. HIS ADMINISTRATION 

00:56:32.443 --> 00:56:35.579
HAD STOOD BY THE WAY THAT HE 
PULLED TROOPS OUT OF 

00:56:35.905 --> 00:56:37.905
AFGHANISTAN, 

00:56:39.476 --> 00:56:42.935
AND THE AIRLIFT OF MORE THAN 
100,000 PEOPLE. BUT ULTIMATELY, 

00:56:43.239 --> 00:56:45.990
13 U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS ENDED UP
GETTING KILLED IN THAT 

00:56:46.299 --> 00:56:50.990
OPERATION. SO, HE HAS REALLY 
STRUGGLED TO COME BACK FROM 

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.873
THOSE APPROVAL NUMBERS SINCE THE
SUMMER. WE SAW HE HAD SOME MORE 

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.200
LEGISLATIVE 

00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:00.522
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH THE 
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 

00:57:00.523 --> 00:57:06.769
THAT HE SIGNED INTO LAW BACK IN 
NOVEMBER. BUT, AFTER THAT, HE 

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:10.597
AND DEMOCRATS REALLY FAILED TO 
PASS TO OTHER AGENDA ITEMS. THE 

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.872
BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN AND 
ANYTHING ON A FEDERAL VOTING 

00:57:14.205 --> 00:57:18.726
RIGHTS ACT. SO, BIDEN IS REALLY 
COMING INTO THIS STATE OF THE 

00:57:19.037 --> 00:57:23.125
UNION SPEECH WITH A LONG LIST OF
AGENDA ITEMS. WE GOT SOME 

00:57:23.443 --> 00:57:29.492
EXCERPTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
EARLIER TODAY AS WELL AS 

00:57:30.215 --> 00:57:34.234
FACT SHEETS WHERE THEY LAID OUT 
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT BIDEN 

00:57:34.555 --> 00:57:37.670
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT. FIRST AND
FOREMOST, ON ECONOMIC POLICY. HE

00:57:37.998 --> 00:57:41.234
WILL BE URGING CONGRESS TO DO 
THINGS LIKE, TO HEIGHTEN THE, 

00:57:41.548 --> 00:57:45.607
RACE, I SHOULD SAY, THE FEDERAL 
MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 PER HOUR. HE

00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:49.504
WANTS TO LOWER THE COST OF A 
NUMBER OF THINGS FOR WORKING 

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:53.075
FAMILIES LIKE PRESCRIPTION DRUG 
VICES, AND HOUSING COSTS. SO, HE

00:57:53.393 --> 00:57:57.104
WILL BE URGING CONGRESS, AND WE 
WILL HEAR HIM TALK A LOT ABOUT 

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.301
THE ECONOMY. AND OF COURSE, 
PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST WITHIN THE 

00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:03.696
LAST WEEK, NOMINATED A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE TO SUCCEED JUSTICE

00:58:04.455 --> 00:58:08.609
STEPHEN BREYER. KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON. WE WILL BE HEARING HIM 

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:11.490
MAKE THAT PUSH TO CONGRESS TO 
CONFIRM HER 

00:58:16.078 --> 00:58:20.194
AS THE JUSTICE TO THE SUPREME 
COURT. SHE WOULD BE THE FIRST 

00:58:20.519 --> 00:58:24.035
BLACK WOMAN TO EVER BE CONFIRMED
TO THE SUPREME COURT. IF THAT 

00:58:24.383 --> 00:58:26.383
HAPPENS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; -- IMPORTANT TO SEE BECAUSE 

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:32.628
WE WILL SEE SOME OF THE SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES TONIGHT IN THE 

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:35.816
CHAMBER AND THE PRESIDENT 
CERTAINLY HOPES THAT A YEAR FROM

00:58:36.132 --> 00:58:40.171
NOW AT HIS NEXT STATE OF THE 
UNION, HE SEES A JUSTICE JACKSON

00:58:40.463 --> 00:58:43.640
THERE AS WELL. THANK YOU SO 
MUCH, JOYCE. I WANTED PIVOTED 

00:58:43.965 --> 00:58:48.339
JAMES HOME AND TO PICK UP HER 
JOYCE LEFT OFF ON THE ECONOMY A 

00:58:48.614 --> 00:58:51.689
FEW MOMENTS AGO. JAMES, BECAUSE,
THERE'S A REAL QUESTION OF JUST 

00:58:51.989 --> 00:58:54.843
WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN CAN DO FOR 
THE ECONOMY, FRIENDLY. BUT, 

00:58:55.171 --> 00:58:58.315
MAYBE THE BIGGER QUESTION IS 
EVEN, HOW CAN HE CONVINCE 

00:58:58.613 --> 00:59:02.690
AMERICANS THAT THE ECONOMY IS 
NOT AS BAD AS I THINK IT IS. 

00:59:03.015 --> 00:59:06.536
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS QUITE A NEEDLE TO 
THREAD. AND UNDERSTAND IT, LET'S

00:59:06.864 --> 00:59:10.746
LOOK AT THE WASHINGTON POST ABC 
POLL THAT CAME OUT OVER THE 

00:59:11.067 --> 00:59:14.265
WEEKEND. WHEN YOU HAD TOGETHER, 
YOU KNOW, YOU ASKED PEOPLE, HAD 

00:59:14.604 --> 00:59:18.215
YOU THINK THE NATION'S ECONOMY 
IS DOING. A TOTAL OF 75% SAY 

00:59:18.509 --> 00:59:22.473
EITHER NOT SO GOOD OR POOR. THAT
WAS 70% JUST NUMB THREE MONTHS 

00:59:22.795 --> 00:59:25.934
AGO. THAT NUMBER CONTINUES TO 
INCREASE. ONLY ABOUT 1 AND 4 

00:59:26.237 --> 00:59:29.521
AMERICANS THINK THE ECONOMY IS 
IN GOOD SHAPE. JUST 3% GETS 

00:59:29.849 --> 00:59:32.905
EXCELLENT. THE REASON THOSE 
NUMBERS ARE SO BAD IS BECAUSE OF

00:59:33.224 --> 00:59:36.004
IT COMES TO ECONOMIC, PEOPLE 
THINK OF THEMSELVES. MY BEING 

00:59:36.295 --> 00:59:39.934
AFFECTED? WE ASKED IN OUR POLL, 
ARE YOU BETTER OFF FINANCIALLY 

00:59:40.256 --> 00:59:42.871
THAN WHAT BIDEN BECAME 
PRESIDENT. HALF THE PEOPLE SAY 

00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:47.036
I'M ABOUT THE SAME SHAPE. 35% 
SAY NOT AS WELL OFF. 17% SAY 

00:59:47.356 --> 00:59:50.799
BETTER OFF. THIS IS A BIG RED 
FLAG NUMBER FOR THE 

00:59:51.131 --> 00:59:53.913
ADMINISTRATION. AND, THE REASON 
THAT IT IS SO FRUSTRATING FOR 

00:59:54.226 --> 00:59:57.275
THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE IS THAT, 
WAGES HAVE GONE UP, AND 

00:59:57.581 --> 01:00:01.213
EMPLOYMENT IS AROUND 4%. BUT 
INFLATION IS AT A 40 YEAR HIGH. 

01:00:01.553 --> 01:00:04.961
IS ONE BIDEN ADVISOR PUT IT TO 
BE, WHEN PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS GO 

01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:08.695
UP, THEY THINK THEY EARNED IT. 
WHEN THE PRICES EARNED AND THEY 

01:00:09.013 --> 01:00:13.056
THINK IT'S A TAX ON THEM. AND 
INFLATION IS A HUGE PROBLEM. SO,

01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:17.295
BIDEN NEEDS TO SOUND LIKE HE 
GETS IT, LIKE HE FEELS THE PAIN 

01:00:17.592 --> 01:00:20.199
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING HIGHER 
PRICES. ESPECIALLY POORER 

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.657
AMERICANS. THE CHALLENGES, RIGHT
NOW, ONLY 37%. THE SAME AS 

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:27.697
APPROVE OF HIS OVERALL JOB, 
APPROVE OF HOW BIDEN IS DOING ON

01:00:28.014 --> 01:00:31.727
THE ECONOMY. THE OTHER QUESTION 
WE ASK IS WHICH PARTY DO YOU 

01:00:32.053 --> 01:00:34.803
THINK IS BETTER? REPUBLICANS 
HAVE A 19 POINT EDGE OVER 

01:00:35.158 --> 01:00:37.954
DEMOCRATS ON THE ECONOMY. THAT 
IS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE THAT 

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:41.171
REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD ON THIS 
QUESTION IN A POST-POLL SINCE 

01:00:41.484 --> 01:00:46.376
1990. SO, WE ARE GOING TO HEAR A
LOT ABOUT UKRAINE. WERE GOING TO

01:00:46.713 --> 01:00:49.832
HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
EUROPE. THAT WILL GET THE MOST 

01:00:50.138 --> 01:00:52.339
ATTENTION TONIGHT. ULTIMATELY, 
THE, THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE 

01:00:52.924 --> 01:00:57.035
GOING TO COME DOWN A LOT MORE TO
HOW PEOPLE FEEL THE ECONOMY IS 

01:00:57.357 --> 01:01:00.850
DOING AND WHICH PARTY THE THING 
CAN HANDLE IT BETTER. AND, IN 

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:04.312
THAT VEIN, LET'S LOOK AT THIS 
QUESTION. THE POLL ESSENTIALLY 

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.426
ASKED, WHO IS TO BLAME FOR 
INFLATION. FOR RISING PRICES. 

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.812
HALF OF PEOPLE SAY BIDEN 
DESERVES A GREAT DEAL OF BLAME. 

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:14.826
BIDEN, AS HE LEAVES THE WHITE 
HOUSE THERE TO HEAD OVER TO 

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.347
CAPITOL HILL, IS GOING TO TRY TO
BASICALLY SAY THAT IT IS NOT HIS

01:01:19.673 --> 01:01:22.470
FAULT. HE HAS 4 DIFFERENT 
SECTIONS IN TONIGHT'S SPEECH 

01:01:22.798 --> 01:01:26.148
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY,
AND SPECIFICALLY, TRYING TO TIE 

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.620
IN SOME OF HIS ECONOMIC 
PROPOSALS TO HIS EFFORT TO LOWER

01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:32.681
PRICES. AND PEOPLE ARE PRETTY 
AMENABLE. TO IT. THREE QUARTERS 

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.073
OF AMERICANS SAY DISRUPTIONS 
FROM COVID DESERVE A LOT OF 

01:01:36.394 --> 01:01:39.380
BLAME FOR PRICES GOING UP, 
SUPPLY-CHAIN PROBLEM. 68% SAY 

01:01:39.702 --> 01:01:42.631
CORPORATIONS TRY TO INCREASE THE
PROFITS DESERVE BLAME. BIDEN IS 

01:01:42.961 --> 01:01:46.069
GOING TO HIGHLIGHT, NOT THOSE 
NUMBERS, BUT BOTH OF THOSE 

01:01:46.379 --> 01:01:49.911
DYNAMICS. HE'S GOING TO SAY WE 
NEED TO BRING SUPPLY CHAINS TO 

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:53.078
THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED TO 
MAKE THINGS HERE DOMESTICALLY. 

01:01:53.395 --> 01:01:56.780
AND HE IS GOING TO CALL OUT MEAT
PROCESSORS, AND MONOPOLIES 

01:01:57.107 --> 01:01:59.674
GENERALLY, SAY BUSINESSES ARE 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS. 

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:03.684
ALL OF THAT IS PART OF AN 
EFFORT, LIBBY, TO SHOW THAT HE 

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:07.271
UNDERSTANDS THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE
ARE FEELING IN THE ECONOMY, BUT 

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.468
THAT IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. THAT IS
A HARD MESSAGE TO DELIVER WHEN 

01:02:11.792 --> 01:02:15.069
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT, THOUGH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAMES 

01:02:15.397 --> 01:02:18.030
HOHMANN. AS WE WATCH THAT 
MOTIVATE PROCESS DOWN 

01:02:18.355 --> 01:02:20.934
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, YOU CAN 
ALSO SEE THE, THE SENATE 

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.756
CHAMBER,  SENATORS ARE PREPARING
TO GO, THEMSELVES, ACROSS THE 

01:02:25.064 --> 01:02:27.862
CAPITAL, OVER TO THE HOUSE 
CHAMBER TO EXPERIENCE AND 

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.091
WITNESS TONIGHT STATED THE UNION
ADDRESS. IT IS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S

01:02:31.407 --> 01:02:34.240
FIRST OFFICIAL STATE OF THE 
UNION ADDRESS. THE ADDRESS HE 

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:38.327
GAVE TO THE JOINT SESSION OF 
CONGRESS ABOUT A YEAR AGO, WAS 

01:02:38.627 --> 01:02:42.090
NOT THIS OFFICIAL STATE OF THE 
UNION. AND YOU CAN SEE THERE, 

01:02:42.427 --> 01:02:46.284
THE MASKS ARE OFF. MEMBERS OF 
THE SENATE, AS THEY HEAD OVER, 

01:02:46.595 --> 01:02:50.705
THE RULES HAVE CHANGED, AND SO, 
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO GO MASK WAS 

01:02:51.009 --> 01:02:54.195
THROUGH THE CHAMBER AND OVER TO 
THE HOUSE. THIS EVENING. CLEVE, 

01:02:54.517 --> 01:02:58.858
I WANT TO BRING YOU IN FOR TWO 
THINGS. ONE THING, CLEVE, AS WE 

01:02:59.174 --> 01:03:02.335
HEAR JAMES REFLECT ON THOSE 
NUMBERS, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TO 

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.438
COME UP WITH A STRATEGY OF HOW 
THEY TALK TO AMERICANS ABOUT THE

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:09.887
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FOR THE 
ECONOMY. AND TRY TO GET FAITH 

01:03:10.213 --> 01:03:13.141
AND CONFIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT 
BIDEN CAN LEAD THE WAY. 

01:03:13.142 --> 01:03:16.630
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. 100%. RIGHT? LIKE, IF 
BIDEN WERE TO JUST SHIFT THE 

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:20.350
BLAME AND SAY, THIS IS, YOU 
KNOW, CORPORATIONS FAULT, OR 

01:03:20.621 --> 01:03:27.140
THIS IS, YOU KNOW, RUSSIA'S 
FAULT. THAT IT MAKES IT REALLY, 

01:03:27.445 --> 01:03:30.754
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO 
ARE ASKING, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU 

01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:34.800
DOING? WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
TO LEE? SO, ONE OF THE THINGS 

01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:38.878
THAT WE WILL SEE BIDEN TRY TO DO
IS, IN VERY PLAINSPOKEN WAYS, 

01:03:39.409 --> 01:03:43.523
YOU KNOW, SAY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
OUR WAY OUT OF THIS. LIKE, THIS 

01:03:43.848 --> 01:03:48.312
IS HOW WE CHART, WE CHART A PATH
OUT OF THIS. WHILE ALSO SORT OF 

01:03:48.644 --> 01:03:52.287
NOT TAKING TOO MUCH OF THE 
BLAME, SORT OF ONTO HIMSELF. AS 

01:03:52.592 --> 01:03:55.764
JAMES, YOU KNOW, ELEGANTLY PUT, 
THAT IS A REALLY, REALLY TOUGH 

01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:58.525
NEEDLE TO THREAD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU, 

01:03:58.811 --> 01:04:02.795
CLEVE, IS WHAT IS YOU ARE GOING 
TO BE LOOKING FOR AND WATCHING 

01:04:03.102 --> 01:04:06.365
FOR. IT IS ALSO, IT IS ALWAYS 
INSIGHTFUL TO HEAR WHAT 

01:04:06.672 --> 01:04:09.162
REPORTERS BRING TO VIEWING 
TONIGHT SPEECH. WHICH WOULD 

01:04:09.475 --> 01:04:12.191
LISTEN FOR? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WONDER WHAT BIDEN SAYS TO 

01:04:12.496 --> 01:04:15.611
FOLKS THAT MAYBE WERE NOT THE 
HARDEST CORE DEMOCRATS, OR THE 

01:04:15.929 --> 01:04:18.416
BIGGEST BIDEN SUPPORTERS. FOLKS 
WHO, MAYBE THEY VOTED AGAINST 

01:04:18.738 --> 01:04:22.079
TRUMP, OR MAYBE THEY JUST, YOU 
KNOW, THEY BELIEVED IN BIDEN, 

01:04:22.383 --> 01:04:25.782
BUT NOT, YOU KNOW, 100%. I 
WONDER WHAT HIS ARGUMENT IS TO 

01:04:26.116 --> 01:04:29.867
THOSE. A LOT OF TIMES, WE KNOW 
WHAT THE RIGHT BELIEVES AND WHAT

01:04:30.173 --> 01:04:33.895
THE LEFT BELIEVES, BUT, YOU 
KNOW, IN THE MIDDLE, LIKE IN THE

01:04:34.183 --> 01:04:39.355
MARGINS ON THE MIDDLE, LIKE 
THOSE FOLKS WHO NEED A 

01:04:40.235 --> 01:04:44.115
GO TO THE POLLS. WHO NEED A 
REASON TO CONTINUE TO TRUST. I 

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:48.095
THINK THAT IS WHAT BIDEN IS 
GOING TO HIT ON. I ALSO WONDER, 

01:04:48.397 --> 01:04:51.209
YOU KNOW, WHAT SPECIFICALLY HE 
SAYS ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS, 

01:04:51.527 --> 01:04:55.278
ABOUT THE ECONOMY, YOU KNOW, FOR
FOLKS LIKE MY PARENTS, WHO WORRY

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:58.426
ABOUT THE RISING COSTS OF 
EVERYTHING. THAT IS A POCKET 

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.656
WHICH ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERY 
SINGLE THING THAT AMERICANS DO. 

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:05.637
I WONDER WHAT ARGUMENT HE MAKES 
FOR THOSE PEOPLE ABOUT WHY THEY 

01:05:05.956 --> 01:05:07.880
SHOULD KEEP PUTTING TRUST IN 
HIM. 

01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:11.215
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, CLEVE 
WOOTSON.  RHONDA COLVIN, WE ARE 

01:05:11.539 --> 01:05:15.273
WATCHING THE SENATORS  GO 
THROUGH STATUARY HALL ON THEIR 

01:05:15.581 --> 01:05:20.044
WAY OVER TO THE HOUSE CHAMBER. 
IT IS A PLACE THAT YOU AND I ARE

01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:23.266
USUALLY STATIONED, WATCHING. AND
IT IS USUALLY FULL OF PEOPLE, 

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.685
JUST JAMPACKED, ELBOW TO ELBOW, 
WITNESSING THIS MOMENT. TALK TO 

01:05:26.997 --> 01:05:29.515
US ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING 
FOR TONIGHT. 

01:05:29.516 --> 01:05:33.026
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS TRUE, YOU KNOW, IN 
YEARS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, WE 

01:05:33.351 --> 01:05:37.055
WOULD HAVE BEEN CRAMMED IN THAT 
ROOM, TRYING TO TALK TO SENATORS

01:05:37.389 --> 01:05:41.876
AND LAWMAKERS AS THEY GO BY. AND
THAT HAS NOT BEEN SO NOW FOR THE

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:46.305
SECOND YEAR IN A ROW. I THINK 
WHAT I WILL BE WATCHING FOR 

01:05:46.639 --> 01:05:49.443
TONIGHT IS LISTENING TO HELP THE
PRESIDENT ADDRESSES HIS BACK 

01:05:49.761 --> 01:05:52.196
BETTER AGENDA. YOU WILL REMEMBER
THAT THAT WAS THE 

01:05:52.483 --> 01:05:54.285
INFRASTRUCTURE, THE SOCIAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE THAT 

01:05:54.286 --> 01:05:57.116
INVOLVED CLIMATE INITIATIVES. IT
INVOLVE MORE MONEY FOR PROGRAMS 

01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:01.140
FOR CHILDREN. A LOT OF SOCIAL 
SPENDING IN THERE, AND IT WAS AN

01:06:01.462 --> 01:06:04.585
AMBITIOUS PLAN. HOWEVER, IT DID 
FIZZLE OUT BACK IN DECEMBER WHEN

01:06:04.895 --> 01:06:08.654
THE TWO KEY SWING VOTES IN THE 
SENATE SAID THEY WERE NOT 

01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:13.226
SUPPORTED. SO, IT SEEMS LIKE IT 
HAS BEEN ON PAUSE A LITTLE BIT 

01:06:13.546 --> 01:06:17.578
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL. I SUSPECT 
HE WILL WANT TO BRING IT UP 

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:21.905
SOMEHOW TOOK A SO, HOW DOES HE 
RECAST IT? HOW DOES HE DISCUSS 

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:26.035
IT? WHAT IS HIS PITCH TO THESE 
LAWMAKERS? IN HIS PITCH TO THE 

01:06:26.548 --> 01:06:29.352
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE CAN GET 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT DONE. 

01:06:29.671 --> 01:06:33.122
BECAUSE IT DID INVOLVE A LOT OF 
THOSE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES THAT 

01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:37.149
A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE WONDERING
ABOUT RIGHT NOW. SO I AM 

01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:40.974
WONDERING HOW HE ADDRESSES THAT.
IF UKRAINE DID NOT HAPPEN, OR IF

01:06:41.296 --> 01:06:44.766
SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT,
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, DIDN'T

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:49.136
HAPPEN. I SUSPECT BIDEN WOULD 
HAVE BEEN ON THE ROAD THE LAST 

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:53.156
FEW WEEKS DISCUSSING THIS MORE. 
AND HE HAS BEEN. HIS WIFE HAS 

01:06:53.533 --> 01:06:55.695
ALSO BEEN VISITING COMMUNITY 
COLLEGE DISCUSSING THAT SOCIAL 

01:06:55.989 --> 01:06:59.649
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. BUT, IT HAS
FIZZLED OUT HERE A LITTLE BIT ON

01:06:59.969 --> 01:07:03.709
CAPITOL HILL. SO, I WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE HOW HE IS GOING TO 

01:07:04.014 --> 01:07:07.778
ADDRESS THAT AGAIN. WHAT IS HIS 
PLAN FORWARD? IS HE GOING TO 

01:07:08.071 --> 01:07:11.812
BREAK IT UP? THAT IS ONE OF THE 
THEORIES HERE ON CAPITOL HILL, 

01:07:12.136 --> 01:07:16.618
IS THAT THE PLAN IS GOING TO BE 
BROKEN UP SO THAT IT CAN BE 

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:20.897
VOTED ON, ISSUE BY ISSUE INSTEAD
OF ONE LARGE PLANT. SO, I WILL 

01:07:21.199 --> 01:07:24.636
BE LISTENING TO SEE HOW HE TALKS
ABOUT GO BACK BETTER. 

01:07:24.637 --> 01:07:27.850
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WE JUST SAW THE VICE
PRESIDENT, KAMALA HARRIS, ENTER 

01:07:28.417 --> 01:07:31.581
THE HOUSE CHAMBER. THE SENATORS 
ARE COMING IN NOW. SO, SPEAKER 

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:35.276
PELOSI HAS CALLED THE HOUSE TO 
ORDER. RHONDA, I JUST HAVE TO 

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:39.602
REMARK, THE STRIKING VISUAL THIS
IS TO SEE THE MASK OFF, TO SEE 

01:07:39.901 --> 01:07:43.317
THE VICE PRESIDENT WITHOUT A 
MASK, AND TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE 

01:07:43.629 --> 01:07:47.390
COMING IN HERE, YOU KNOW, IT 
WON'T BE AS CROWDED AS IT WOULD 

01:07:47.723 --> 01:07:52.070
HAVE BEEN THREE OR FOUR YEARS 
AGO. BUT IT WILL STILL BE A FULL

01:07:52.389 --> 01:07:54.585
CHAMBER, RHONDA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. JUST, YOU KNOW,

01:07:54.887 --> 01:07:58.063
LAST YEAR I BELIEVE IT WAS 
AROUND 200 PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED 

01:07:58.376 --> 01:08:02.157
INTO THE CHAMBER. PEOPLE HAD TO 
TO BRING VIRTUAL GUESTS. THAT IS

01:08:02.484 --> 01:08:05.641
A PRACTICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY 
STILL DOING THIS YOU. A NUMBER 

01:08:05.928 --> 01:08:09.407
OF PEOPLE HAVE VIRTUAL GUESTS. 
THAT MIGHT BE AROUND TO STAY FOR

01:08:09.702 --> 01:08:13.748
YEARS TO COME. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU ARE NOT SEEING MANY MASKS. I

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:17.212
HAVE NOT SEEN JERRY MANDLER 
THERE FROM THE HOUSE. HE IS 

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:21.548
WEARING A MASK. BUT YOU KNOW, 
YOUR -- LAWMAKERS TO DO SO. YOU 

01:08:21.872 --> 01:08:25.030
ARE ALSO SPEAKING VERY CLOSELY 
TO EACH OTHER. IT LOOKS VERY 

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:28.864
2019. AND EARLIER. AND, THIS IS 
CERTAINLY A SHIFT FOR THE HOUSE.

01:08:29.194 --> 01:08:32.646
THE HOUSE, AND NOT THE SENATE, 
BUT HOUSE, DID HAVE REGULATIONS 

01:08:32.974 --> 01:08:36.438
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, 
THAT MANY MEMBERS HAD TO BE 

01:08:36.772 --> 01:08:40.612
MASSED. IN FACT, IF YOU WANT 
MASS, YOU ARE FINE. FOR THIS TO 

01:08:40.902 --> 01:08:44.914
BE A CHANGE THAT WE ARE SEEING 
ON THIS NIGHT, IT IS REALLY 

01:08:45.256 --> 01:08:47.987
INTERESTING VISUALLY. AND IT IS 
ALSO GOING TO BE INTERESTING 

01:08:48.263 --> 01:08:51.064
WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN WALKS 
THROUGH, HE KNOWS MANY OF THESE 

01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:54.474
PEOPLE PERSONALLY, AS HAVING 
SERVED IN CONGRESS FOR SUCH A 

01:08:54.795 --> 01:08:58.175
LONG TIME. HE WILL LIKELY WANT 
TO SHAKE HANDS, HUG, YOU KNOW, 

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.901
SPEAK CLOSELY. SO, IT IS REALLY 
GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:05.275
WHAT TYPE OF BALANCE HE STRIKES.
BECAUSE, HE, AGAIN, HIS 

01:09:05.578 --> 01:09:08.408
ADMINISTRATION WILL WANT TO 
CONVEY TO PEOPLE THAT, YES, THIS

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.807
PANDEMIC IS STILL HERE WITH US, 
BUT WE ARE LEARNING TO DEAL WITH

01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:16.891
IT. AND, IT IS REALLY GOING TO 
BE TRULY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 

01:09:17.197 --> 01:09:20.077
HE COMES IN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE SEEING THE MEDIA THERE

01:09:20.414 --> 01:09:24.085
AS THEY WATCH. AND THAT WOULD 
NORMALLY BE PACKED WITH THREE 

01:09:24.415 --> 01:09:26.888
QUARTERS WATCHING WHAT IS 
HAPPENING. SO, THERE ARE STILL 

01:09:27.186 --> 01:09:29.975
SOME DIFFERENCES. WE ARE STILL 
SEEING A MUCH THINNER PRESS 

01:09:30.293 --> 01:09:33.629
CORPS IN ATTENDANCE TONIGHT. AT 
THIS STATE OF THE UNION. JAMES, 

01:09:33.934 --> 01:09:37.338
SOMETHING ELSE WE ARE SEEING, 
AND A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE 

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:41.033
SENATE AND HOUSE WEARING YELLOW 
AND BLUE, THE UKRAINIAN COME OF 

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:44.733
THE COLORS OF UKRAINE, JAMES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ALSO SEEING PEOPLE WITH 

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:48.168
UKRAINIAN FLAGS. WE JUST OMIT 
ROMNEY AND JOE MANSION COMING IN

01:09:48.496 --> 01:09:51.055
TOGETHER. HOLDING A UKRAINIAN 
PLACARD AND ROMNEY APPEARED TO 

01:09:51.348 --> 01:09:54.538
HAVE A LAPEL THAT HAD AN 
AMERICAN AND UKRAINIAN FLAG. YOU

01:09:54.889 --> 01:09:58.599
SEE SOME, YOU KNOW, POPS OF 
YELLOW AND POPS OF BLUE THERE ON

01:09:58.922 --> 01:10:03.041
THE FLOOR. AND THAT IS, AND IT 
IS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. 

01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:07.011
IT IS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
RHONDA SAID IT FEELS LIKE 2019. 

01:10:07.309 --> 01:10:11.427
IT DOES FEEL SORT OF NORMAL. AND
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT IS 

01:10:11.745 --> 01:10:15.518
PART OF THE STRATEGY FOR THE 
SPEECH BY THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY 

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:19.296
ORIGINALLY HAD INTENDED THIS TO 
BE PART OF THE KIND OF PIVOT, 

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.802
RETURN TO NORMALCY TO PRE-COVID,
TO KIND OF RECOGNIZING WHERE THE

01:10:23.109 --> 01:10:27.107
REST OF THE COUNTRY IS. AND, 
WILL BE JUST A LOT LOUDER IN 

01:10:27.428 --> 01:10:31.227
THERE THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO 
WHEN THE AUDIENCE WAS SO MUCH 

01:10:31.506 --> 01:10:34.943
SMALLER, AND AT SOME POINT TO 
KIND OF SOUNDED LIKE AYDEN WAS 

01:10:35.267 --> 01:10:37.390
ECHOING IN THAT BIG, CAVERNOUS 
CHAMBER. 

01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:39.783
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING IN THE 
WASHINGTON POST CHIEF 

01:10:40.095 --> 01:10:42.586
CORRESPONDENT, DAN BALTZ. DAN, 
WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR 

01:10:42.902 --> 01:10:46.624
JOINING US. WHERE DOES THIS 
SPEECH,, IN TERMS OF JOE BIDEN'S

01:10:46.935 --> 01:10:49.965
PRESIDENCY? HOW PIVOTAL IS THIS 
MOMENT? WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY 

01:10:50.281 --> 01:10:53.067
THAT HE HAS? AND ALSO, WHAT IS 
THE LIFT? 

01:10:53.068 --> 01:10:55.902
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE OPPORTUNITY HE HAS 
OBVIOUSLY, IS TO BEGIN SOMETHING

01:10:56.214 --> 01:10:59.214
OF A RESET FOR HIS PRESIDENCY, 
GIVEN HIS LOW APPROVAL RATINGS 

01:10:59.501 --> 01:11:02.286
AND THE WARNING SIGNS THE 
DEMOCRATS SEE HEADING INTO THE 

01:11:02.603 --> 01:11:06.023
NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. BUT, THIS IS
A SPEECH THAT IS GOING TO BE 

01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:09.719
GIVEN IN A MUCH, MUCH DIFFERENT 
CONTEXT THAN THEY HAD IMAGINED 

01:11:10.013 --> 01:11:12.818
WHEN THEY STARTED WRITING THE 
SPEECH. WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER 

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:17.521
THE LAST WEEK, AND PRIOR TO THAT
IN THE RUN-UP. BUT IN THE LAST 

01:11:17.847 --> 01:11:20.348
WEEK, WITH THE RUSSIAN INVASION 
OF UKRAINE, HAS COMPLETELY 

01:11:20.673 --> 01:11:23.530
TRANSFORMED THIS MOMENT. AND HE 
NOW HAS 2 IMPORTANT AUDIENCES. 

01:11:23.839 --> 01:11:27.322
HE HAS AN IMPORTANT AUDIENCE AT 
HOME, WHICH RIGHT NOW, DOES NOT 

01:11:27.856 --> 01:11:31.822
SEE HIM AS A STRONG LEADER. DOES
NOT APPROVE OF MUCH OF WHAT HE 

01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:35.200
IS DOING AS PRESIDENT TOOK A 
BUT, HE ALSO HAS AN 

01:11:35.526 --> 01:11:38.925
INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE, AND IT 
WILL BE LOOKING AT HIM TO, IN 

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:42.699
ESSENCE, DEFINE WHAT IS PROBABLY
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN 

01:11:42.973 --> 01:11:45.789
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY. 
SO, THE QUESTION IS, HOW DOES HE

01:11:46.119 --> 01:11:49.557
BALANCE THOSE CHALLENGES? HE HAS
TO DEAL WITH THE DOMESTIC ISSUES

01:11:49.871 --> 01:11:53.503
THAT ARE FOREMOST IN THE MINDS 
OF THE VOTERS. BUT HE ALSO HAS 

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:57.516
TO EXPLAIN TO AMERICANS AND TO 
THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHY THIS 

01:11:57.836 --> 01:12:02.055
MOMENT IS SO IMPORTANT AND WHAT 
IT IS GOING TO TAKE IN THE LONG 

01:12:02.374 --> 01:12:06.404
RUN TO DEAL WITH A, YOU KNOW, OF
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO IS BENT ON, 

01:12:06.733 --> 01:12:11.400
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, TRYING TO
RE-CREATE A SOVIET, OR A RUSSIAN

01:12:11.715 --> 01:12:13.896
EMPIRE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DAN, HOW MUCH OF THE MESSAGES

01:12:14.223 --> 01:12:17.114
WEAVING TOGETHER? YOU KNOW, HOW 
MUCH DOES PRESIDENT BIDEN TALK 

01:12:17.411 --> 01:12:20.369
ABOUT THIS, THIS EXISTENTIAL 
THREAT THAT RUSSIA POSES, AND IN

01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:23.909
TERMS OF THIS TRYING TO SAVE 
DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE. AND HOW 

01:12:24.234 --> 01:12:28.049
MUCH DOES HE TIE INTO HIS GOALS 
DOMESTICALLY? IS THERE A DANGER 

01:12:28.373 --> 01:12:32.049
THERE? IS HE TRYING TO SEPARATE 
THOSE TWO THINGS, OR BRING THEM 

01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:34.532
TOGETHER? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE 

01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:37.682
CHALLENGES OF THE SPEECH. LIKE 
EVERYBODY ELSE, I AM INTERESTED 

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:42.241
TO SEE HOW THEY DO THAT. WE KNOW
THAT THE THEME OF DEMOCRACY OF 

01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:45.087
AND AUTHORITARIANISM HAS BEEN A 
LONG-STANDING THEME OF PRESIDENT

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:48.949
BIDEN SINCE CAME INTO OFFICE. 
AND IN SOME WAYS, THIS HAS BEEN 

01:12:49.266 --> 01:12:52.776
MORE OF KIND OF A DOMESTIC 
DISCUSSION, IN PART BECAUSE OF 

01:12:53.088 --> 01:12:56.656
THE CHALLENGES OUR OWN DEMOCRACY
HERE AT HOME. WE ARE NOW SEEING 

01:12:56.945 --> 01:12:59.245
THE INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
IN A MUCH MORE EXISTENTIAL WAY. 

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:03.532
SOAP I THINK THAT GIVES HIM THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT, 

01:13:03.841 --> 01:13:08.257
AND BRING IT HOME AND AWAY HE 
WAS ABLE TO DO BEFORE. IS NOT A 

01:13:08.566 --> 01:13:11.654
THEORETICAL DISCUSSION ANYMORE. 
IT IS A LIVE DISCUSSION AT THESE

01:13:11.979 --> 01:13:14.793
RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE BOMBARDING 
THE CITIES OF UKRAINE. BUT THE 

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:18.176
QUESTION IS, WE KNOW THAT THE 
SANCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED

01:13:18.509 --> 01:13:22.645
ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO, YOU KNOW,
BRING TREMENDOUS COST TO THE 

01:13:22.971 --> 01:13:25.825
RUSSIAN ECONOMY AND THE RUSSIAN 
PEOPLE AND RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS, IT

01:13:26.141 --> 01:13:30.360
IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT HERE 
AT HOME. AND IN A COUNTRY THAT 

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.995
IS ALREADY FEELING THE EFFECTS 
OF RISING GAS PRICES AND RISING 

01:13:34.321 --> 01:13:37.533
GROCERY PRICES AND HIGHER CAR 
PRICES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS, 

01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:41.964
THAT IS LIKELY TO GET WORSE. 
AND, HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TRY 

01:13:42.289 --> 01:13:47.020
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS GOING TO 
DO TO TRY TO MITIGATE THAT. HE 

01:13:47.358 --> 01:13:50.154
CAN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM, IN 
PART, BECAUSE THE POLICIES THAT 

01:13:50.466 --> 01:13:54.148
HE AND OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES HAVE 
BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT ARE GOING TO 

01:13:54.442 --> 01:13:58.551
CAUSE THOSE THINGS TO BE WORSE. 
SO, HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TRY 

01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:02.006
TO DO KIND OF A DELICATE 
BALANCING ACT IN EXPLAINING WHY 

01:14:02.309 --> 01:14:06.703
THIS IS WORTH IT. WHY THE UNITED
STATES HAS TO LEAD IN A MOMENT 

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.524
LIKE THIS. AND, SOME OF THE 
SACRIFICES THAT MAY BE BORN AT 

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:14.897
HOME. BUT THAT IS NOT A MESSAGE 
THAT IS NECESSARILY GOING TO BE 

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.454
WELL RECEIVED HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES. 

01:14:17.455 --> 01:14:21.475
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE WATCHING THE GUESTS 
OF THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED 

01:14:21.797 --> 01:14:24.877
STATES COME INTO THAT TOP 
CHAMBER THERE. AMONG HER GUESTS,

01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:27.737
THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED STATES. A SYMBOLIC 

01:14:28.066 --> 01:14:31.246
ADDITION TO THE GUEST LIST. 
OTHER GUESTS OF THE FIRST LADY 

01:14:31.579 --> 01:14:34.148
TONIGHT INCLUDE FRANCIS HAUGAN, 
THE FACEBOOK  WHISTLEBLOWER. WE 

01:14:34.464 --> 01:14:37.885
WILL ALSO SEE THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF INTEL. WE WILL SEE 

01:14:38.192 --> 01:14:41.069
A NURSE WHO HAS BEEN TREATING 
COVID PATIENTS. ALSO, A 

01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:43.568
STEELWORKER, AND A SEVENTH 
GRADER LOCALLY HERE FROM 

01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:46.966
VIRGINIA. JOSHUA DAVIS IS A 
DIABETES ADVOCATE. AND A MIDDLE 

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:50.801
SCHOOL STUDENT. THAT IS JUST 
SOME OF WHO WE WILL SEE JOINING 

01:14:51.144 --> 01:14:54.513
THE FIRST LADY TONIGHT. YOU 
KNOW, DAN, WE WERE TALKING A 

01:14:54.814 --> 01:14:57.848
LITTLE WHILE AGO ABOUT THE 
HOLDBACK BETTER AGENDA AND, YOU 

01:14:58.146 --> 01:15:01.338
KNOW, JUST THE COUNTER EFFORTS 
THAT THAT MAN RIGHT THERE, JOE 

01:15:01.658 --> 01:15:05.515
MENTIONED DID, TO SORT OF BRING 
HIS PARTY TO ITS HEELS AS IT 

01:15:06.037 --> 01:15:09.221
TRIED TO PASS ITS DOMESTIC 
AGENDA. YOU KNOW, WE WONDERED IF

01:15:09.553 --> 01:15:13.055
WE COULD HEAR THE WORDS BUILD A 
BETTER TONIGHT. WE WILL HEAR 

01:15:13.366 --> 01:15:16.335
COMPONENTS OF THAT LEGISLATION 
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM 

01:15:16.657 --> 01:15:19.681
THINK THEY CAN STILL GET 
THROUGH. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT, 

01:15:20.011 --> 01:15:22.505
THOUGH, THAT IT HAS BEEN SO 
PAIRED BACK? 

01:15:22.506 --> 01:15:25.218
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT 
OBVIOUSLY. IT IS THE THIRD 

01:15:25.501 --> 01:15:28.556
PILLAR OF HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA 
THAT BEGAN WITH THE AMERICAN 

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:31.131
RESCUE PLAN. AND THEN, THE 
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. 

01:15:31.431 --> 01:15:34.474
BUT IN MANY WAYS, TOO MANY 
PEOPLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, 

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.795
PARTICULARLY THE ACTIVIST WING 
OF THE PARTY, THE BUILD BACK 

01:15:38.068 --> 01:15:41.442
BETTER BILL WAS REALLY THE KIND 
OF BE-ALL AND END-ALL FOR WHAT 

01:15:41.761 --> 01:15:45.269
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR. BECAUSE 
IT WAS AN EFFORT TO FINALLY DO 

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:49.522
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY 
HAVE WANTED TO DO IN TERMS OF 

01:15:49.859 --> 01:15:52.056
EXPANDING DOMESTIC PROGRAMS AND 
DOMESTIC SAFETY NET PROGRAMS, 

01:15:52.382 --> 01:15:55.237
AND ALSO, DEALING WITH THE 
THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO, 

01:15:55.563 --> 01:15:59.346
THE FACT THAT THAT HAS BEEN, YOU
KNOW, IF NOT SCUTTLED, CERTAINLY

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:03.404
PUT WAY ON THE BACK BURNER, HAS 
BEEN A BLOW TO HIS PRESIDENCY 

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:07.194
AND TO MANY PEOPLE IN THE 
DEMOCRATIC 30. AND THE QUESTION 

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:11.463
IS, TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE ABLE 
TO RESURRECT PIECES OF IT? AND, 

01:16:11.744 --> 01:16:16.155
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO THAT? I THINK TONIGHT, HE IS 

01:16:16.466 --> 01:16:21.134
GOING TO HAVE TO BEGIN TO SAY, 
HERE IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO 

01:16:21.456 --> 01:16:24.876
DO. AND HERE MAYBE SOME OF THE 
PRIORITIES. I DON'T KNOW HOW 

01:16:25.201 --> 01:16:29.166
DEEPLY HE WILL GO INTO THAT. 
THAT YOU KNOW, THAT IS A LITTLE 

01:16:29.487 --> 01:16:32.453
BIT OF SAUSAGE MAKING, FRANKLY, 
THAT, FOR A BIG, DOMESTIC 

01:16:32.763 --> 01:16:34.993
AUDIENCE, ISN'T NECESSARILY 
GOING TO, YOU KNOW, RESONATE 

01:16:35.301 --> 01:16:40.060
THAT MUCH. BUT, HE HAS TO TALK 
ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS TO DO ON THE

01:16:40.386 --> 01:16:43.446
DOMESTIC FRONT. MY GUESS IS, 
AGAIN, BASED ON THE LIMITED 

01:16:43.737 --> 01:16:47.612
EXCERPTS WE HAVE SEEN OF THE 
SPEECH, HE IS GOING TO TRY TO 

01:16:47.928 --> 01:16:51.869
PUT A LOT OF THIS IN THE CONTEXT
OF DEALING WITH INFLATION. THAT 

01:16:52.185 --> 01:16:55.719
THE THINGS HE IS DOING OUR AIMED
AT LOWERING PRICES. AT EASING 

01:16:56.005 --> 01:16:59.911
THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING
AT THE PUMP OR AT THE GROCERY 

01:17:00.210 --> 01:17:04.000
STORE. AND THAT SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT HE WANTS TO DO THAT 

01:17:04.516 --> 01:17:07.948
WERE IN THE BUILD BACK BETTER 
BILL WOULD GO SOME WAYS TO 

01:17:08.272 --> 01:17:12.311
BEGINNING TO DO THAT. BUT AGAIN,
HE IS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE ON 

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:15.165
THAT THAN HE WAS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LET'S TALK ABOUT 

01:17:15.474 --> 01:17:18.353
ELEMENTS THAT WILL SURVIVE FROM 
BUILD BACK BETTER AND PRIORITIES

01:17:18.682 --> 01:17:21.849
OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. 
THINGS THAT THEY STILL HOPE THEY

01:17:22.166 --> 01:17:25.053
CAN RESURRECT THAT. OR, POINTS 
THEY BELIEVE CAN FIND BIPARTISAN

01:17:25.365 --> 01:17:28.179
SUPPORT, OR, EVEN IF NOT 
REPUBLICANS, IN TERMS OF THESE 

01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:31.919
BODIES RIGHT HERE, INDEPENDENT 
VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:35.159
ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AGENDA? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO 

01:17:35.490 --> 01:17:39.248
CALL FOR WHAT HE SAYS IS A UNITY
AGENDA, THAT HE THINKS THAT 

01:17:39.566 --> 01:17:43.045
THERE ARE THESE ELEMENTS OF HIS 
SOCIAL SPENDING PLAN THAT CAN 

01:17:43.363 --> 01:17:46.468
GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND HE 
IS GOING TO PRESENT GETTING 

01:17:46.761 --> 01:17:50.219
SOMETHING DONE, PUTTING POINTS 
ON THE BOARD, AS A WAY TO SHOW 

01:17:50.542 --> 01:17:53.989
AUTOCRACIES IN THE WORLD THAT 
THE UNITED STATES CAN GET ITS 

01:17:54.301 --> 01:17:57.130
ACT TOGETHER, AND CAN STILL PASS
MAJOR PIECES OF LEGISLATION. 

01:17:57.461 --> 01:18:00.672
INTERESTINGLY, I DON'T EXPECT WE
WILL HEAR THE TERM BUILD BACK 

01:18:00.998 --> 01:18:04.079
BETTER OTHER PRESIDENTS NOW 
TONIGHT. IN THE EARLY DRAFTS OF 

01:18:04.399 --> 01:18:07.514
THE SPEECH, ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT BIDEN WAS GOING TO 

01:18:08.022 --> 01:18:10.909
EMPHASIZE WAS CLIMATE CHANGE. HE
IS STILL GOING TO MENTION 

01:18:11.231 --> 01:18:13.964
CLIMATE CHANGE. POLLS SHOW THAT 
LIBERAL BASE VOTERS, THAT 

01:18:14.268 --> 01:18:16.419
REMAINS THE SINGLE MOST 
IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT, THE 

01:18:16.738 --> 01:18:20.199
UKRAINE CRISIS DOES CHANGE THE 
DYNAMIC A LITTLE BIT. ALL OF A 

01:18:20.531 --> 01:18:24.493
SUDDEN COMING GAS PRICES ARE UP 
MORE THAN $1 UP FROM WHERE THEY 

01:18:24.798 --> 01:18:28.571
WERE A YEAR AGO. OIL PRICES, 
OVER $100 A BARREL. IT MAKES IT 

01:18:28.894 --> 01:18:32.405
HARD TO TALK ABOUT REDUCING FUEL
CONSUMPTION AND THAT KIND OF 

01:18:32.705 --> 01:18:36.897
THING. SO, HE IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW HE TALKS

01:18:37.196 --> 01:18:40.387
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. EVEN 
THOUGH THAT WAS A HUGE PART OF 

01:18:40.702 --> 01:18:42.897
BUILD BACK BETTER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE HEARING SPEAKER 

01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:45.546
PELOSI CALL THE CHAMBER TO 
ORDER. 

01:18:45.547 --> 01:18:51.374
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE JOINT SESSION WILL COME 
TO ORDER. THE CHAIR APPOINTS AS 

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.733
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE 
PART OF THE HOUSE TO ESCORT THE 

01:18:56.012 --> 01:18:58.012
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
INTO 

01:19:02.064 --> 01:19:04.064
THE CHAMBERS.

01:19:06.402 --> 01:19:09.571
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS SPEAKER PELOSI GETS 
PREPARED FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN TO 

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:13.336
COME INTO THE CHAMBER, LET'S GO 
TO RHONDA COLVIN TO TALK ABOUT 

01:19:13.656 --> 01:19:18.041
THE OPTICS OF TONIGHT. RHONDA,  
IT IS SO SIGNIFICANT, AND WE 

01:19:18.358 --> 01:19:23.633
CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THIS TO SEE 
TWO WOMEN FLANKING THE PRESIDENT

01:19:23.947 --> 01:19:27.273
OF THE UNITED STATES. THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, A FEMALE SPEAKER OF 

01:19:27.579 --> 01:19:30.780
THE HOUSE. WHAT WILL YOU BE 
WATCHING TONIGHT IN TERMS OF 

01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:34.058
REACTIONS TO THE SPEECH? IN 
TERMS OF THE VOLUME, THE 

01:19:34.381 --> 01:19:37.813
SUPPORT, OR, PERHAPS THE SILENCE
OF MEMBERS IN THIS CHAMBER? 

01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:40.994
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THESE ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT 
MOMENTS TO SORT OF READ THE 

01:19:41.305 --> 01:19:44.508
ROOM. AND I THINK I WILL BE 
LISTENING, SINCE UKRAINE SEEMS 

01:19:44.827 --> 01:19:47.930
TO HAVE BROUGHT SOME SENSE OF 
UNITY AMONG DEMOCRATS AND 

01:19:48.253 --> 01:19:51.449
REPUBLICANS HERE ON THE HILL, 
YOU KNOW, BOTH SIDES OF THE 

01:19:51.769 --> 01:19:54.584
AISLE ARE WEARING THE RIBBONS, 
WITH THE UKRAINIAN FLAG COLORS, 

01:19:54.894 --> 01:19:58.630
OR THEY ARE DRESSED IN THE 
COLORS. I AM WONDERING HOW THEY 

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:01.092
WILL RESPOND WHEN HE 
SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT THE 

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:04.808
UKRAINE ISSUE? ARE YOU GOING TO 
HEAR APPLAUSE OR ANY SORT OF 

01:20:05.112 --> 01:20:09.132
AUDIBLE SUPPORT ON THAT ISSUE? I
THINK ALSO, IF HE MENTIONS HIS 

01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:12.296
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, WHO, HAS 
STARTED THE PROCESS OF TOURING 

01:20:12.602 --> 01:20:14.602
THE 

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:20.526
HILL SOON. HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING 
TO REACT TO THAT. THAT IS ONE OF

01:20:20.861 --> 01:20:23.749
THE THINGS WE WILL BE WATCHING 
FOR SOON. THE CONFIRMATION 

01:20:24.067 --> 01:20:27.413
HEARING PROCESS. THERE IS JUST 
SO MUCH TO WATCH WHEN YOU ARE 

01:20:27.705 --> 01:20:31.350
LOOKING AT BOTH OF THE VERBAL 
AND ALSO, THE THINGS THAT ARE 

01:20:31.655 --> 01:20:35.736
NOT SET IN THE ROOM. YOU KNOW, 
WHAT ARE THE FACES LIKE OF SOME 

01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:39.024
OF THE REPUBLICANS LEADERS IN 
THE SENATE? WHAT DO THEY LOOK 

01:20:39.342 --> 01:20:43.361
LIKE WHEN HE BRINGS UP SOME OF 
THOSE PIECES OF HIS AGENDA UP 

01:20:43.707 --> 01:20:47.431
THAT THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY 
DON'T SUPPORT? THIS IS A MOMENT 

01:20:47.754 --> 01:20:50.830
WHERE THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE HOUSE, SINCE 

01:20:51.157 --> 01:20:55.024
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY DECIDE NOT 
TO RUN FOR REELECTION, THEY ARE 

01:20:55.345 --> 01:20:58.776
GOING TO NEED HIM TO SORT OF 
RALLY THE TROOPS HERE, BECAUSE, 

01:20:59.065 --> 01:21:02.262
WE ARE IN PRIMARY SEASON. IN 
FACT, TONIGHT IS THE TEXAS 

01:21:02.542 --> 01:21:05.390
PRIMARY WE'RE HEADING INTO THE 
MIDTERM, SO, THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:09.135
GOING TO NEED HIM TO ALSO RALLY 
FOR THEM. THAT IS ANOTHER 

01:21:09.445 --> 01:21:12.500
PURPOSE OF THIS SPEECH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HANNAH JEWELL TO TALK ABOUT 

01:21:12.832 --> 01:21:15.026
THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE, WHICH 
WILL BE DELIVERED AFTER 

01:21:15.341 --> 01:21:17.341
PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKS. 
TONIGHT'S RESPONSE WILL COME 

01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:19.998
FROM IOWA GOVERNOR, KIM 
REYNOLDS. TELL US MORE. 

01:21:19.999 --> 01:21:23.012
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND REYNOLDS HAS BEEN THE 
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF IOWA 

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:26.490
SINCE 2017. WHERE SHE IS VERY 
POPULAR IN THAT STATE, THOUGH 

01:21:26.824 --> 01:21:29.928
ONLY AMONG REPUBLICANS, SHE IS A
MORE SORT OF POLARIZING FIGURE 

01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:33.079
THAN OTHER SORT OF STATE-LEVEL 
REPUBLICANS. IN THAT STATE. AND 

01:21:33.394 --> 01:21:36.782
SHE WAS PICKED BECAUSE SHE SORT 
OF IS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 

01:21:37.106 --> 01:21:39.886
KIND OF, YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR, THE
KIND OF REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP 

01:21:40.215 --> 01:21:43.423
THAT REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROJECT
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS AT THE 

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:47.223
END OF THIS YEAR. PARTICULARLY 
IN HER HANDLING OF COVERT. AND, 

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.166
SHE OPPOSED VACCINE MANDATES. 
SHIA POST MASK MANDATES. SHE 

01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:55.456
KEPT SCHOOLS OPEN FOR MOST OF 
THE PANDEMIC. AND SHE IS SOMEONE

01:21:55.782 --> 01:21:58.884
WHO HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN 
McCARTHY HAS SAID, SHE KEPT KIDS

01:21:59.194 --> 01:22:02.307
IN SCHOOL, AND CRITICAL RACE 
THEORY OUT. SO, YOU SEE THERE 

01:22:02.812 --> 01:22:05.694
HOW SHE IS REALLY PROJECTING 
THESE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO

01:22:06.028 --> 01:22:09.387
REPUBLICANS. AND I THINK IT WILL
BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW SHE 

01:22:09.694 --> 01:22:12.264
RESPONDS, YOU KNOW, AS A 
GOVERNOR OF A STATE

01:22:16.184 --> 01:22:19.406
THAT IS GOING TO DRIVE SO 
HEAVILY, BE DRIVEN BY FOREIGN 

01:22:19.725 --> 01:22:22.628
POLICY ASPECTS. WE CAN EXPECT 
HER TO PRAISE THE UKRAINIAN 

01:22:22.961 --> 01:22:26.520
RESISTANCE TO RUSSIA'S INVASION,
BUT ALSO TO CAST BLAME FOR IT ON

01:22:26.846 --> 01:22:28.986
BIDEN, REFERENCING, FOR EXAMPLE,
THE WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN.

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:32.460
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST OF THE DIPLOMATIC 
CORPS WELCOMED INTO THE CHAMBER.

01:22:32.795 --> 01:22:36.554
JAMES, THE MEMBERS OF THE 
CABINET ARE HERE, BUT THERE IS A

01:22:36.848 --> 01:22:39.591
DESIGNATED SURVIVOR, AS THERE IS
EVERY YEAR. WHAT IS YOUR 

01:22:39.906 --> 01:22:42.410
REPORTING TELL YOU? WHAT IS LEFT
BEHIND TONIGHT? 

01:22:42.411 --> 01:22:45.208
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PERSON FAMILIAR SAID THE 
PERSON TONIGHT AS COMMERCE 

01:22:45.515 --> 01:22:48.647
SECRETARY GINA REV ANDO. THE 
FORMER GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND,

01:22:48.942 --> 01:22:52.433
SORT OF A RISING STAR FROM THE 
MODERATE RING OF THE DEMOCRATIC 

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.720
PARTY. SOMEONE WHO POTENTIALLY 
HAS PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS. 

01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:58.042
SOMEONE WHO IS CONSIDERED AS 
PART OF THE VEEPSTAKES. 

01:22:58.043 --> 01:23:00.739
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT A 
QUESTIONABLE ITEM ON TONIGHT'S 

01:23:01.055 --> 01:23:03.990
AGENDA. BANNING MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS FROM TRADING STOCKS. WE

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:08.006
WONDERED IF IT WOULD MAKE IT 
INTO THE SPEECH. WHAT ARE WE 

01:23:08.325 --> 01:23:09.901
WATCHING FOR, LISTENING FOR, 
JAMES? 

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.950
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A MEMBER OF CONGRESS TOLD ME 
THAT, IT HAS BEEN PART OF 

01:23:14.249 --> 01:23:18.271
DRAFTS. IT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN 
SOME DRAFTS. IT IS AN OPEN 

01:23:18.601 --> 01:23:21.747
QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS GOING 
TO SURVIVE. WHETHER THEY WILL 

01:23:22.065 --> 01:23:25.106
TAKE THAT OUT. IT IS OBVIOUSLY 
NOT SUPER POPULAR WITH SOME 

01:23:25.437 --> 01:23:28.231
MEMBERS TO BAN LAWMAKERS FROM 
TRADING STOCKS. NANCY PELOSI, 

01:23:28.567 --> 01:23:31.739
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, SAID THAT 
THIS IS A CAPITALIST SOCIETY AND

01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:34.812
MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE SKIN IN THE 
GAME. POLLS SHOW OVERWHELMING 

01:23:35.157 --> 01:23:37.921
MAJORITIES OF AMERICANS WANT TO 
STOP LAWMAKERS FROM TRADING 

01:23:38.238 --> 01:23:40.754
STOCKS. THIS COULD BECOME A 
REALLY POTENT POLITICAL ISSUE 

01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:45.533
FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. SO, YOU CAN SEE THE 

01:23:45.864 --> 01:23:48.676
PRESIDENT MAKE THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT. BUT IF HE DOES, IT

01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:51.839
IS ONE OF THOSE WILD 
ANNOUNCEMENTS TO MAKE TO ENDORSE

01:23:52.143 --> 01:23:55.043
THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION BEFORE 
ALL THESE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, 

01:23:55.347 --> 01:23:58.174
AND IT WOULD BE QUITE 
FASCINATING TO SEE HOW PEOPLE 

01:23:58.732 --> 01:24:02.174
WOULD RESPOND. THIS IS ONE OF 
THOSE THINGS THAT MAY GET CUT 

01:24:02.482 --> 01:24:04.620
AND LEFT ON THE CUTTING ROOM 
FLOOR. 

01:24:04.621 --> 01:24:08.471
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DAN BALZ, LET'S  BRING YOU 
IN ON JUST HOW IMPORTANT THE 

01:24:09.026 --> 01:24:12.532
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS. 
IN THIS MODERN MOMENT, IN THIS 

01:24:12.855 --> 01:24:15.677
MODERN ERA. YOU KNOW, SHORT 
CLIPS, SHORT VIDEOS REALLY ARE 

01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:19.743
THE THINGS THAT SORT OF, YOU 
KNOW, PAYING ACROSS THE WEB AND 

01:24:20.069 --> 01:24:22.708
PAYING ACROSS OUR CONSCIOUSNESS.
HOW SIGNIFICANT OR IMPORTANT IS 

01:24:23.034 --> 01:24:25.908
THIS LONG, HOUR-LONG SPEECH, 
THAT A PRESIDENT GIVES ONCE A 

01:24:26.215 --> 01:24:28.215
YEAR? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIBBY, I THINK OVER THE 

01:24:28.484 --> 01:24:32.390
YEARS, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT 
HAS GONE DOWNHILL. I DON'T THINK

01:24:32.707 --> 01:24:36.662
IT CARRIES QUITE THE WAY THAT IT
WEDNESDAY. AUDIENCES ARE NOT AS 

01:24:36.982 --> 01:24:41.098
BIG AS THEY USED TO BE. AS YOU 
SUGGEST, PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS 

01:24:41.419 --> 01:24:45.676
IN DIFFERENT WAYS, AND THEY GET 
IT IN SNIPPETS AND GET IT ON THE

01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:49.671
PHONE. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY 
TUNING IN FOR THE FULL HOUR OF 

01:24:49.989 --> 01:24:53.484
THE SPEECH. SO, THAT IS, IN 
ESSENCE, KIND OF THE POLITICAL 

01:24:53.933 --> 01:24:57.468
REALITY OF IT. YET, WE KNOW THAT
EACH YEAR, IS A TREMENDOUS 

01:24:57.802 --> 01:25:01.341
AMOUNT OF WORK INVESTED IN THIS 
SPEECH. THERE IS SERIOUS TO 

01:25:01.678 --> 01:25:04.259
RATES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION.
IN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT

01:25:04.575 --> 01:25:08.126
GOES IN AND WHAT DOESN'T GET 
INTO THE SPEECH. THERE IS 

01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:11.345
CAREFUL THOUGHT TO THE 
STAGECRAFT OF THE SPEECH. AND 

01:25:11.668 --> 01:25:14.218
SO, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
INTENSE WORK SURROUNDS THIS 

01:25:14.549 --> 01:25:19.176
MOMENT. AND, IT IS THE KIND OF 
THING WHERE NO PRESIDENT 

01:25:19.837 --> 01:25:22.395
TAKE IT LIGHTLY. NO 
ADMINISTRATION CAN AFFORD TO 

01:25:22.699 --> 01:25:26.669
KIND OF WINGED AT THE STATE OF 
THE UNION. AND AS I SAID 

01:25:27.009 --> 01:25:30.307
EARLIER, WE ARE ANY PARTICULAR 
MOMENT. I MEAN, IT IS UNUSUAL 

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:34.250
FOR A STATE OF THE UNION TO 
COINCIDE WITH THIS KIND OF 

01:25:34.557 --> 01:25:36.854
FOREIGN-POLICY CRISIS. SO, I 
THINK THAT GIVES HEIGHTENED 

01:25:37.182 --> 01:25:43.109
ATTENTION. BUT WHETHER WHAT HE 
SAYS IS LONG-LASTING, I AM A 

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.203
LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL. I THINK 
THAT WHATEVER MESSAGE HE HAS 

01:25:46.533 --> 01:25:50.349
TONIGHT IS ONE THAT HE IS GOING 
TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER 

01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:54.099
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND 
FRANKLY, TO THE REST OF THE 

01:25:54.405 --> 01:25:57.370
WORLD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GLAD THAT YOU ARE -- 

01:25:57.698 --> 01:26:00.557
WATCHING US HERE TONIGHT WITH 
THE WASHINGTON POST. WE WILL 

01:26:00.885 --> 01:26:04.487
BRING YOU THE SPEECH, OF COURSE,
IN ITS ENTIRETY. WE WILL HAVE 

01:26:04.804 --> 01:26:06.994
THE REPULSIVE REBUTTAL 
AFTERWARDS AND WE WILL HAVE 

01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:09.832
ANALYSIS FROM OUR WASHINGTON 
POST COLLEAGUES. DAN BALZ, YOU 

01:26:10.133 --> 01:26:14.170
KNOW,  THE STATE OF THE UNION 
ADDRESS CAN BE A KICKOFF FOR 

01:26:14.499 --> 01:26:17.385
WHAT COMES NEXT, RIGHT? THE 
PRESIDENT TYPICALLY GOES ON THE 

01:26:17.701 --> 01:26:21.736
ROAD TO SELL THE IDEAS. AND AS 
WE LOOK AT JUST HOW MUCH MONEY 

01:26:22.056 --> 01:26:24.813
MIGHT BE SPENT ON CERTAIN 
PRIORITIES, WE WON'T GET 

01:26:25.145 --> 01:26:27.704
NECESSARILY BOTTOM LINES 
TONIGHT. WE MIGHT GET SOME. BUT 

01:26:28.012 --> 01:26:31.589
A LOT OF THOSE BOTTOM LINES WILL
COME LATER, AS THE BUDGET IS 

01:26:31.890 --> 01:26:35.774
CRAFTED. I JUST WANT TO POINT 
OUT OF COURSE, THE FIRST LADY OF

01:26:36.096 --> 01:26:38.843
THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN, 
AND THE SECOND GENTLEMAN, DOUG 

01:26:39.172 --> 01:26:42.892
IMHOFF COMING IN THE. WILL COME 
BACK TO YOU IN A MOMENT DOWN, 

01:26:43.205 --> 01:26:46.921
BUT AS WE WATCH FOR A MOMENT, 
THE FIRST LADY GREETING THE 

01:26:47.239 --> 01:26:49.769
UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED STATES. AND YOU SEE 

01:26:50.106 --> 01:26:53.577
THERE, THE OTHER GUESTS OF THE 
FIRST LADY. WE SAW MEMBERS OF 

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:57.248
THE SUPREME COURT COME IN A 
MOMENT AGO. THE CHIEF JUSTICE, 

01:26:57.557 --> 01:27:00.722
AS WELL AS FOR OTHER JUSTICES, 
INCLUDING JUSTICE BREYER, AND 

01:27:01.046 --> 01:27:04.398
WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE HIS FINAL 
APPEARANCE HERE, AS HE HAS 

01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:07.206
ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT PENDING
THE CONFIRMATION OF HIS 

01:27:07.533 --> 01:27:10.707
SUCCESSOR. SO, DAN, THIS KICKS 
OFF GOING ON THE ROAD AND 

01:27:11.036 --> 01:27:13.858
GETTING SOME HARD NUMBERS ABOUT 
THE BUDGET AND WHAT THE 

01:27:14.182 --> 01:27:17.291
PRESIDENT REALLY WANTS TO SEE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVERY PRESIDENT IN RECENT 

01:27:17.614 --> 01:27:21.661
MEMORY GOES ON THE ROAD RIGHT 
AFTER THE STATE OF THE UNION 

01:27:21.982 --> 01:27:26.355
MESSAGE. THE STATE OF THE UNION 
IS A BIG MOMENT. THEY WANT TO 

01:27:26.678 --> 01:27:29.840
TRY TO BUILD ON WHATEVER 
MOMENTUM THEY GET OUT OF THE 

01:27:30.165 --> 01:27:33.333
SPEECH. WHATEVER GUT REACTION 
THEY GET OUT OF THE SPEECH. AND,

01:27:33.622 --> 01:27:37.614
THEY WANT TO GO OUT INTO THE 
COUNTRY AND BEGIN TO HAVE THAT 

01:27:37.937 --> 01:27:40.775
RIPPLE BEYOND, YOU KNOW, THE 
BELTWAY AND THE BORDERS OF 

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:44.314
WASHINGTON. BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS 
IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS AN 

01:27:44.607 --> 01:27:48.636
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF STUFF ON HIS 
PLATE. AND, HOW MUCH HE WILL BE 

01:27:48.952 --> 01:27:53.088
ABLE TO JUGGLE ALL OF THAT. HE 
HAD SAID, YOU KNOW, A MONTH OR 

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:57.402
SO AGO, THAT HE INTENDED TO GET 
OUT OF WASHINGTON MORE IN HIS 

01:27:57.712 --> 01:28:01.776
SECOND YEAR THAN HE WAS ABLE TO 
DO IN THE FIRST YEAR. AND NOW, 

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:04.853
HE SUDDENLY HAS THIS ENORMOUS 
FOREIGN-POLICY CRISIS. THAT IS 

01:28:05.176 --> 01:28:08.714
CONSUMING A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT 
OF HIS TIME, JUST -- THE AMOUNT 

01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:12.110
OF DIPLOMATIC WORK THAT HE IS 
DOING AND OTHERS IN HIS 

01:28:12.395 --> 01:28:15.456
ADMINISTRATION ARE DOING BEHIND 
THE SCENES. SO, HE IS GOING TO 

01:28:15.776 --> 01:28:20.233
BE LIMITED IN HOW MUCH HE IS 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT WORK

01:28:20.547 --> 01:28:23.951
AND, I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO ULTIMATELY MAKE THEIR 

01:28:24.247 --> 01:28:27.476
JUDGMENTS ON HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT
THEIR OWN LIVES, THEIR OWN 

01:28:27.804 --> 01:28:31.090
ECONOMIES, THEIR OWN FINANCES, 
AND HOW WELL HE IS DEALING WITH,

01:28:31.404 --> 01:28:34.460
YOU KNOW, THE BIG CHALLENGES 
BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. 

01:28:34.461 --> 01:28:37.969
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, WE HAVE WATCHED THE 
CABIN COME IN. AND OF COURSE, 

01:28:38.293 --> 01:28:41.799
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE ARE 
WATCHING CLOSELY, THE SECRETARY 

01:28:42.085 --> 01:28:45.234
OF STATE. THE SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE. THEY LED THE GROUP IN 

01:28:45.563 --> 01:28:49.281
EARLY THERE A FEW MOMENTS AGO. 
TALK TO US ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S

01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:53.063
CABINET, WHO IS HERE TONIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WE SAW LLOYD 

01:28:53.387 --> 01:28:57.112
AUSTIN. OF COURSE, HE IS OVER, 
HAS A BIG ROLE RIGHT NOW, GIVEN 

01:28:57.429 --> 01:29:00.453
THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. AS 
DOES THE SECRETARY OF STATE, 

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.196
ANTONY BLINKEN. YOU ALMOST, IF 
YOU LOOK AT THE FACES, YOU KNOW,

01:29:04.513 --> 01:29:07.917
YOU WONDER WHAT IS GOING ON IN 
THEIR MINDS, BECAUSE THEY ARE 

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.328
DEALING WITH SO MUCH ON THE 
FRONTS. I BELIEVE I HAVE ALSO 

01:29:12.653 --> 01:29:15.225
SEEN THE ENERGY SECRETARY. I 
HAVE SEEN THE EDUCATION 

01:29:15.547 --> 01:29:19.338
SECRETARY. ALL OF THEM SEEM TO 
BE THERE AND IN SUPPORT OF 

01:29:19.637 --> 01:29:22.468
BIDEN, OF COURSE, EXCEPT THE 
DESIGNATED SURVIVOR, WHICH JAMES

01:29:22.772 --> 01:29:25.613
JUST TALKED ABOUT. THIS SHOWS, 
THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM LAST 

01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:29.032
YEAR, BECAUSE EVERYONE DID NOT 
COME. THAT OF COURSE WAS BECAUSE

01:29:29.349 --> 01:29:32.791
OF COVERT RESTRICTIONS. BUT, 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR 

01:29:33.097 --> 01:29:36.265
THE PRESIDENT TO HAVE HIS PEOPLE
BEHIND HIM, SITTING THERE, AS 

01:29:36.594 --> 01:29:39.355
PART OF THIS AUDIENCE TONIGHT. 
THIS IS, HE DEFINITELY WILL 

01:29:39.676 --> 01:29:43.113
PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK AT LLOYD 
AUSTIN'S FACE A PRESIDENT BIDEN 

01:29:43.446 --> 01:29:46.992
TALKS ABOUT THE TROOPS, OR LOOK 
AT ANTONY BLINKEN'S FACE AS THE 

01:29:47.319 --> 01:29:50.080
UKRAINE ISSUE IS MENTIONED. IT 
IS CERTAINLY AN INCREDIBLE NIGHT

01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:54.030
SO MANY ISSUES THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO

01:29:54.343 --> 01:29:57.189
OVER, AND HE HAS MOST OF HIS 
CABINET THERE. 

01:29:57.190 --> 01:30:00.735
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, THE PRESIDENT WILL 
SPEAK IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. WE 

01:30:01.077 --> 01:30:05.217
DO EXPECT HIM TO COME INTO THE 
HOUSE CHAMBER SHORTLY. IT STILL 

01:30:05.536 --> 01:30:08.613
FEELS ROOMY IN HERE. RHONDA HAS 
TALKED ABOUT HOW MANY MORE 

01:30:08.925 --> 01:30:13.034
PEOPLE ARE HERE THEY WERE HERE 
LAST YEAR. BUT, THE STATE OF THE

01:30:13.354 --> 01:30:17.370
UNION TO ME HAS THIS FEEL OF, 
PACKED TO THE GILLS. WHEN I HAVE

01:30:17.693 --> 01:30:21.109
BEEN THERE INSIDE THE CHAMBER, 
IT IS ELBOW TO ELBOW. AND THERE 

01:30:21.439 --> 01:30:24.546
IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY 
ROBUST AND ALIVE ABOUT THE. 

01:30:24.885 --> 01:30:28.019
TONIGHT, THINGS CAN BREAK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT REALLY DOES TAKE ON ENERGY

01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:32.437
OF ITS OWN. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE 
CHAMBER. EVEN WHEN ONLY HALF THE

01:30:32.764 --> 01:30:35.401
MEMBERS ARE APPLAUDING FOR 
SOMETHING, YOU CAN REALLY, I 

01:30:35.702 --> 01:30:38.468
MEAN, IT JUST GETS PHYSICALLY 
HOT IN THERE UNDER THE 

01:30:38.796 --> 01:30:41.869
TELEVISION LIGHTS WITH EVERYONE 
THERE. IT IS NOT QUITE AT FULL 

01:30:42.194 --> 01:30:45.965
CAPACITY. AND, THAT DOES HAVE AN
IMPACT ON THE ROOM, ON THE 

01:30:46.298 --> 01:30:50.091
SPEAKER. IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS
WHERE IT IS REALLY HARD TO 

01:30:50.399 --> 01:30:53.689
REHEARSE FOR A STATE OF THE 
UNION, BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING 

01:30:54.224 --> 01:30:57.727
YOU KNOW, TO YOURSELF AND THERE 
IS HIS AUDIENCE AND YOU DON'T 

01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:01.923
KNOW WHO IS GOING TO APPLAUD OR 
HOW LONG THEY WILL APPLY FOR. 

01:31:02.239 --> 01:31:04.943
SOMETIMES, LAWMAKERS STAND UP 
FOR THINGS THAT PRESIDENTS DON'T

01:31:05.263 --> 01:31:07.974
EXPECT THEM TO STAND UP FOR. 
SOMETIMES, PRESIDENTS THINK THEY

01:31:08.276 --> 01:31:11.416
HAVE AN APPLAUSE LINE, OR A 
STANDING OVATION LINE AND THEY 

01:31:11.751 --> 01:31:15.109
DON'T GET IT, EITHER BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T DELIVER IT RIGHT, OR 

01:31:15.424 --> 01:31:18.950
BECAUSE IT JUST SORT OF FALLS 
FLAT IN THE DELIVERY. THAT IS 

01:31:19.281 --> 01:31:23.403
ONE OF THE REASONS IT IS SO FUN 
TO WATCH THESE, BECAUSE THERE IS

01:31:23.736 --> 01:31:27.231
SO MUCH, YOU KNOW, WE SEE THE 
JUSTICES THERE, JUSTICE AMY 

01:31:27.545 --> 01:31:30.140
CONEY BARRETT AND JUSTICE BRETT 
CAVANAUGH, DURING BARACK OBAMA'S

01:31:30.455 --> 01:31:33.888
STATE OF THE UNION IN 2010, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS CRITICIZING THE 

01:31:34.213 --> 01:31:37.040
CITIZENS UNITED DECISION. AND, 
JUSTICE SAM ALITO SAID YOUR 

01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:40.941
LINE. YOU COULD SEE HIM MOUTHING
IT. SO, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU 

01:31:41.258 --> 01:31:44.608
ARE GOING TO GET WHEN YOU BRING 
ALL THESE VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE 

01:31:44.929 --> 01:31:47.721
INTO THIS AUGUST CHAMBER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DAN. WATCHING THE DYNAMICS, 

01:31:48.051 --> 01:31:51.095
WATCHING EVEN THIS MOMENT HERE, 
SAYING YOU KNOW, A SENATOR GET 

01:31:51.404 --> 01:31:54.857
TO SPEAK TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE. 
SEEING THERE, THE SOON TO BE 

01:31:55.145 --> 01:31:58.246
RETIRED TO JUSTICE. THERE IS 
THIS MOMENT THAT REFLECTS ON 

01:31:58.565 --> 01:32:01.204
DEMOCRACY. AND, THE AMERICAN 
SPIRIT. YOU KNOW, WATCHING THE 

01:32:01.514 --> 01:32:03.514
COLLEGIALITY. WATCHING THE 
SENATORS PROCESS TO STATUARY 

01:32:03.716 --> 01:32:06.807
HALL AND SEEING A REPUBLICAN 
STANDING NEXT TO A DEMOCRAT. DO 

01:32:07.342 --> 01:32:10.405
YOU HOLD OUT HOPE TO SEE MOMENTS
OF COLLEGIALITY AND UNITY 

01:32:10.717 --> 01:32:12.984
TONIGHT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DO. AND I THINK THAT 

01:32:13.504 --> 01:32:17.591
CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN SAID. I 
THINK ON UKRAINE, THERE WILL BE 

01:32:17.901 --> 01:32:21.332
A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNITY. THERE 
MAY BE SOME CRITICISM ON THE 

01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:24.519
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THINGS THAT 
BIDEN, THAT THEY THINK BIDEN 

01:32:24.846 --> 01:32:28.681
DIDN'T DO OR SHOULD HAVE DONE. 
BUT, IN THE SENSE OF BEING 

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:32.084
UNITED AGAINST PUTIN AND RUSSIA,
THERE ARE VERY FEW DISSENTERS ON

01:32:32.398 --> 01:32:35.875
THAT PART AND I WOULD THINK THAT
WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS SPEAKING 

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:39.656
ABOUT THAT, WE WILL SEE THAT 
UNITY. I THINK THE OTHER 

01:32:39.978 --> 01:32:43.658
QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE IS ANY
UNITY AT ALL ON ANY PIECES OF 

01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:47.228
THE DOMESTIC AGENDA. BECAUSE, WE
KNOW THE DIVISIONS THERE HAVE 

01:32:47.558 --> 01:32:50.609
BEEN SO SHARP AND THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS, WITH THE EXCEPTION 

01:32:50.938 --> 01:32:53.842
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE 
HAVE BEEN WHOLLY OPPOSED TO THE 

01:32:54.138 --> 01:32:57.618
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
TRIED TO DO. SO, I THINK THAT 

01:32:57.934 --> 01:33:02.003
WILL BE THE REAL MEASURE. BUT IT
IS ALWAYS FASCINATING ON A NIGHT

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.230
LIKE THIS, ON THIS PARTICULAR 
NIGHT, WHEN, IN ESSENCE, THE 

01:33:05.559 --> 01:33:08.750
THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT ARE
ALL IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER. AND, 

01:33:09.107 --> 01:33:12.179
MINGLING TOGETHER IN WAYS THAT 
THEY NEVER OTHERWISE WOULD DO. 

01:33:12.455 --> 01:33:15.628
AND, THERE IS A SORT OF, A 
FRIENDLINESS ABOUT IT, EVEN 

01:33:15.955 --> 01:33:19.123
THOUGH, THE MINUTE THEY STEP OUT
OF THE CHAMBER TONIGHT, THEY 

01:33:19.452 --> 01:33:22.840
WILL KINDA GO BACK TO THEIR OWN 
BARRICADES AND RESUME THE 

01:33:23.133 --> 01:33:26.634
BATTLING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
GOING ON. BUT, FOR AT LEAST A 

01:33:26.964 --> 01:33:30.464
FEW MOMENTS, AND FRANKLY, UNTIL 
THE SPEECH STARTS, THERE IS A 

01:33:30.754 --> 01:33:34.556
SENSE OF CAMARADERIE, AND A KIND
OF A NOTION THAT THIS IS THE 

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.807
COMMUNITY OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
GOVERNMENT. 

01:33:36.808 --> 01:33:39.614
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DAN, THAT SHOULD NOT BE 
REMARKABLE, BUT GIVEN THE 

01:33:39.915 --> 01:33:43.250
INSURRECTION ON THE CAPITAL LAST
YEAR, GIVEN SOME OF THE THREATS 

01:33:43.583 --> 01:33:46.926
THAT LAWMAKERS SAID THEY HAVE 
FELT UNDER EVEN BY MEMBERS OF 

01:33:47.226 --> 01:33:49.445
CONGRESS THEMSELVES. IT IS STILL
IMPORTANT, DOWN. 

01:33:49.446 --> 01:33:53.631
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND WE 
ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT THAT FAR AWAY 

01:33:53.959 --> 01:33:57.085
FROM JANUARY 6th. AND, THOSE, 
YOU KNOW, THOSE WOUNDS ARE STILL

01:33:57.387 --> 01:34:01.626
OPEN AND ROB. FOR MANY PEOPLE. 
AND AGAIN, I SAY I DON'T THINK A

01:34:01.945 --> 01:34:05.883
NIGHT LIKE THIS GOES AT ALL TO 
ERASE THAT. BUT, IT IS THE 

01:34:06.186 --> 01:34:10.035
MOMENT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TRY 
TO SPEAK TO THE COUNTRY AND FOR 

01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:13.809
THE PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATIVE 
BRANCH TO BEGIN TO GIVE SOME 

01:34:14.141 --> 01:34:16.141
SENSE OF A REACTION. 

01:34:50.945 --> 01:34:54.078
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT BITING GRADING 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AS HE COMES 

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.255
THROUGH THAT CENTER AISLE. 
GETTING A SEAT IN THE CENTER 

01:34:57.563 --> 01:35:01.896
AISLE HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A 
HOT SEAT TO BE ON. AS YOU GET A 

01:35:02.205 --> 01:35:06.035
MOMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES. YOU SEE A LOT OF 

01:35:06.353 --> 01:35:09.539
BLUE AND YELLOW THERE. MEMBERS 
OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE WEARING 

01:35:09.845 --> 01:35:13.243
THE COLORS OF UKRAINE TO SUPPORT
THAT COUNTRY AS IT WITHSTANDS 

01:35:13.568 --> 01:35:17.381
THE ATTACKS BY RUSSIA. YOU ARE 
ALSO SEEING A LACK OF MASKS. 

01:35:17.703 --> 01:35:20.588
ONLY A HANDFUL OF MEMBERS 
WEARING MASKS TONIGHT. THEY ARE 

01:35:20.894 --> 01:35:24.558
NO LONGER REQUIRED IN THE HOUSE 
CHAMBER. AND THE OPTICS OF THIS 

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.453
MOMENT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT CAN CERTAINLY 

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:30.861
SPEAK TO, AS HE TALKS ABOUT THE 
CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC TWO YEARS 

01:35:31.162 --> 01:35:34.935
IN. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE FROM 
THE WASHINGTON POST. WE WILL BE 

01:35:35.269 --> 01:35:37.746
BRINGING YOU TONIGHT'S SPEECH. 
THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE, AS WELL

01:35:38.083 --> 01:35:40.629
AS ANALYSIS. AFTER PRESIDENT 
RYDEN'S FIRST STATE OF THE 

01:35:40.947 --> 01:35:42.947
UNION.

01:36:29.378 --> 01:36:31.378
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MEMBERS 

01:36:34.492 --> 01:36:37.598
OF CONGRESS. I HAVE A HIGH 
PRIVILEGE AND DISTINCT HONOR OF 

01:36:37.921 --> 01:36:39.921
PRESENTING TO YOU THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE 

01:36:43.594 --> 01:36:45.594
UNITED STATES.

01:37:05.617 --> 01:37:07.617
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU, THANK YOU, 

01:37:10.941 --> 01:37:15.517
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY 
MUCH. THANK YOU, GENTLEMAN. 

01:37:18.881 --> 01:37:20.881
THANK YOU. 

01:37:24.106 --> 01:37:28.508
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY, 
VERY MUCH. THANK 

01:37:31.577 --> 01:37:34.550
YOU. PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

01:37:38.529 --> 01:37:41.364
MADAM SPEAKER, MADAM VICE 
PRESIDENT AND OUR FIRST LADY AND

01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:45.010
SECOND GENTLEMAN. MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS AND THE CABINET, 

01:37:45.315 --> 01:37:50.591
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. MY
FELLOW AMERICANS. LAST YEAR, 

01:37:50.901 --> 01:37:54.551
COVID-19 KEPT US APART. THIS 
YEAR, WE ARE FINALLY TOGETHER 

01:37:58.747 --> 01:38:00.747
AGAIN. TONIGHT. 

01:38:04.102 --> 01:38:08.312
TONIGHT, WE MEET AS DEMOCRATS, 
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS. 

01:38:08.619 --> 01:38:11.840
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, AS 
AMERICANS. WITH A DUTY TO ONE 

01:38:12.161 --> 01:38:14.689
ANOTHER, TO AMERICA, TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO THE 

01:38:15.212 --> 01:38:19.281
CONSTITUTION. AND IN AN 
UNWAVERING RESOLVE THAT FREEDOM 

01:38:19.572 --> 01:38:21.572
WILL ALWAYS TRIUMPH 

01:38:24.593 --> 01:38:27.522
OVER TYRANNY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

01:38:32.403 --> 01:38:34.567
THANK YOU. 

01:38:40.506 --> 01:38:44.138
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SIX DAYS AGO, RUSSIA'S 
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S SOUGHT TO SHAKE

01:38:44.452 --> 01:38:47.863
THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF THE FREE
WORLD, THINKING HE COULD MAKE IT

01:38:48.186 --> 01:38:50.186
BEND TO HIS 

01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:56.568
MENACING WAYS. BUT HE BADLY 
MISCALCULATED. HE THOUGHT HE 

01:38:56.887 --> 01:39:01.031
COULD ROLL INTO UKRAINE AND THE 
WORLD WOULD ROLLOVER. INSTEAD, 

01:39:01.359 --> 01:39:05.061
HE MET WITH A WALL OF STRENGTH 
HE NEVER ANTICIPATED OR 

01:39:05.366 --> 01:39:09.184
IMAGINED. HE MET THE UKRAINIAN 
PEOPLE.

01:39:14.691 --> 01:39:16.691
WHEN 

01:39:19.702 --> 01:39:21.702
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

01:39:24.995 --> 01:39:27.439
, TO EVERY UKRAINIAN, THEIR 
FEARLESSNESS, THEIR COURAGE, 

01:39:27.725 --> 01:39:29.725
THEIR DETERMINATION, LITERALLY 
INSPIRES THE WORLD. GROUPS 

01:39:32.898 --> 01:39:35.986
OF CITIZENS BLOCKING TANKS WITH 
THEIR BODIES. EVERYONE FROM 

01:39:36.308 --> 01:39:38.308
STUDENTS TO RETIREES TO 
TEACHERS, TURNED SOLDIERS. 

01:39:38.498 --> 01:39:41.976
DEFENDING THEIR HOMELAND. AND IN
THE STRUGGLE, PRESIDENT 

01:39:42.288 --> 01:39:44.723
ZELENSKYY SAID IN HIS SPEECH, 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, LIGHT 

01:39:45.047 --> 01:39:50.170
WILL WIN OVER DARKNESS. 
UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR OF THE 

01:39:50.502 --> 01:39:55.637
UNITED STATES IS HERE TONIGHT 
SITTING WITH THE FIRST LADY. 

01:39:55.938 --> 01:39:59.812
LET'S EACH OF US, IF YOU'RE ABLE
TO STAND, STAND AND SEND AN 

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:02.683
UNMISTAKABLE SIGNAL TO THE 
WORLD. UKRAINE. THANK YOU. THANK

01:40:02.987 --> 01:40:04.987
YOU, THANK YOU, 

01:40:08.051 --> 01:40:10.051
THANK YOU.

01:40:18.313 --> 01:40:20.313
YOU TWICE AS STRONG AS 

01:40:24.038 --> 01:40:26.038
YOU RESOLVE.

01:40:35.748 --> 01:40:41.012
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. WE, THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, STAND WITH THE 

01:40:41.315 --> 01:40:43.801
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY, WE HAVE LEARNED THIS 

01:40:44.096 --> 01:40:47.625
LESSON. WHEN DICTATORS DO NOT 
PAY A PRICE FOR THEIR 

01:40:47.927 --> 01:40:49.927
AGGRESSION, THEY CAUSE 

01:40:51.661 --> 01:40:55.043
MORE CHAOS. THEY KEEP MOVING. 
AND THE COST AND THREATS TO 

01:40:55.370 --> 01:41:01.035
AMERICA AND AMERICA TO THE WORLD
KEEPS RISING. THAT IS WHY THE 

01:41:01.532 --> 01:41:04.512
NATO ALLIANCE WAS CREATED, TO 
SECURE PEACE AND STABILITY IN 

01:41:04.814 --> 01:41:08.175
EUROPE AFTER WORLD WAR II. THE 
UNITED STATES IS A MEMBER, ALONG

01:41:08.487 --> 01:41:11.852
WITH 29 OTHER NATIONS. IT 
MATTERS. AMERICAN DIPLOMACY 

01:41:12.155 --> 01:41:16.440
MATTERS. AMERICAN RESOLVE 
MATTERS. PUTIN'S LATEST ATTACK 

01:41:16.748 --> 01:41:21.503
ON UKRAINE WAS PREMEDITATED AND 
TOTALLY UNPROVOKED. HE REJECTED 

01:41:21.826 --> 01:41:25.204
BRIEF HEATED, REPEATED EFFORTS 
AT DIPLOMACY. HE THOUGHT THE 

01:41:25.518 --> 01:41:30.644
WEST AND NATO WOULDN'T RESPOND. 
HE THOUGHT HE COULD DIVIDE US AT

01:41:30.977 --> 01:41:34.681
HOME, IN THIS CHAMBER AND THIS 
NATION. HE THOUGHT HE COULD 

01:41:35.002 --> 01:41:37.114
DIVIDE US IN EUROPE AS WELL. BUT
PUTIN 

01:41:40.985 --> 01:41:45.660
WAS WRONG. WE ARE READY. WE ARE 
UNITED, AND THAT IS WHAT WE DID.

01:41:45.956 --> 01:41:50.520
WE STAYED AT UNITED. WE PRAY 
PAIRED EXTENSIVELY AND 

01:41:50.824 --> 01:41:53.063
CAREFULLY. WE SPENT MONTHS 
BUILDING COALITIONS OF OTHER 

01:41:53.365 --> 01:41:56.084
FREEDOM LOVING NATIONS IN 
EUROPE, AND THE AMERICAS, FROM 

01:41:56.368 --> 01:41:58.899
AMERICAN TO ASIAN AND AFRICAN 
CONTINENTS, TO CONFRONT PUTIN. 

01:41:59.241 --> 01:42:02.112
LIKE MANY OF YOU, I SPENT 
COUNTLESS HOURS UNIFYING OUR 

01:42:02.425 --> 01:42:07.718
EUROPEAN ALLIES. WE SHARED WITH 
THE WORLD IN ADVANCE WHAT WE 

01:42:08.036 --> 01:42:11.527
KNEW PUTIN WAS PLANNING. AND 
PRECISELY HOW WE HE WOULD TRY TO

01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:13.810
FALSIFY AND JUSTIFY HIS 
AGGRESSION. WE COUNTERED 

01:42:14.197 --> 01:42:18.246
RUSSIA'S LIES WITH THE TRUTH. 
AND NOW, NOW HE HAS 

01:42:20.463 --> 01:42:24.095
FREE WORLD IS HOLDING HIM 
ACCOUNTABLE. ALONG WITH 27 

01:42:24.415 --> 01:42:28.931
MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
INCLUDING FRANCE, GERMANY, 

01:42:29.234 --> 01:42:33.741
ITALY, AS WELL AS COUNTRIES LIKE
THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, 

01:42:34.058 --> 01:42:36.830
KOREA, NEW ZEALAND. MANY OTHERS,
EVEN SWITZERLAND ARE INFLICTING 

01:42:37.118 --> 01:42:40.396
PAIN ON RUSSIA. AND SUPPORTING 
THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. PUTIN IS 

01:42:40.723 --> 01:42:43.187
NOW ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD MORE
THAN HE HAS 

01:42:47.288 --> 01:42:49.288
EVER BEEN.

01:43:07.622 --> 01:43:10.666
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOGETHER, ALONG WITH OUR 
ALLIES, WE ARE RIGHT NOW 

01:43:10.981 --> 01:43:13.219
ENFORCING POWERFUL ECONOMIC 
SANCTIONS. WE ARE CUTTING OFF 

01:43:13.528 --> 01:43:15.528
RUSSIA'S LARGEST BANKS AND 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM. 

01:43:15.769 --> 01:43:17.918
PREVENTING BRUSHES CENTER BANK 
FROM DEFENDING THE RUSSIAN 

01:43:18.473 --> 01:43:21.460
RUBLE. MAKING PUTIN 630 MILLION 
DOLLAR WAR FUND WORTHLESS. WE 

01:43:21.787 --> 01:43:23.787
ARE CHOKING 

01:43:25.892 --> 01:43:28.380
RUSSIA'S ACCESS. WE ARE CHOKING 
RUSSIA'S ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY 

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.920
THAT WILL 

01:43:32.941 --> 01:43:36.447
SO,, SEPARATES ECONOMIC AND WE 
CAN IT'S MILITARY FOR YEARS TO 

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:39.847
COME. TONIGHT, I SAY TO THE 
RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS AND THE 

01:43:40.173 --> 01:43:43.026
CORRUPT LEADERS WHO WILL ALIENS 
OF DOLLARS OFF THIS VIOLENT 

01:43:43.328 --> 01:43:48.406
REGIME, NO MORE. THE UNITED 
STATES, I MEAN IT.

01:43:56.276 --> 01:43:58.862
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE ASSEMBLING A DEDICATED 

01:43:59.170 --> 01:44:03.649
TASK FORCE TO GO AFTER THE 
CRIMES OF THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS.

01:44:03.969 --> 01:44:07.150
WE ARE JOINING WITH EUROPEAN 
ALLIES TO FIND AND TO SEIZE 

01:44:07.475 --> 01:44:09.717
THEIR YACHTS, THE LUXURY 
APARTMENTS, THEIR PRIVATE JETS. 

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:16.864
WE ARE COMING FOR YOU. YOUR ILL 
BEGOTTEN GAINS. AND TONIGHT, I 

01:44:17.161 --> 01:44:20.251
AM ANNOUNCING THAT WE WILL JOIN 
OUR ALLIES IN CLOSING OFF 

01:44:20.563 --> 01:44:23.121
AMERICAN AIRSPACE TO ALL RUSSIAN
FLIGHTS. -- ADDING ADDITIONAL 

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:29.463
SQUEEZE ON THEIR ECONOMY. HE HAD
NO 

01:44:33.726 --> 01:44:35.727
RUBLE HAS ALREADY LOST 30% OF 

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:42.367
ITS VALUE. THE RUSSIAN STOCK 
MARKET HAS LOST 40% OF ITS VALUE

01:44:42.692 --> 01:44:45.485
AND TRADING REMAINS SUSPENDED. 
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS REELING, 

01:44:45.794 --> 01:44:50.841
AND PUTIN ALONE IS THE ONE TO 
BLAME. TOGETHER WITH OUR ALLIES,

01:44:51.162 --> 01:44:56.734
WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE 
UKRAINIANS IN THEIR FIGHT FOR 

01:44:57.247 --> 01:44:58.838
FREEDOM. MILITARY ASSISTANCE, 
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, 

01:44:58.839 --> 01:45:02.219
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. WE ARE 
GIVING MORE THAN A ALIEN DOLLARS

01:45:02.526 --> 01:45:05.406
IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO 80 

01:45:05.737 --> 01:45:08.827
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE AS THEY DEFEND 
THEIR COUNTRY AND HELP EASE 

01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:13.209
THEIR SUFFERING.

01:45:18.028 --> 01:45:21.940
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. OUR 
FORCES ARE 

01:45:25.065 --> 01:45:28.433
NOT ENGAGED AND WILL NOT ENGAGE 
IN THE CONFLICT WITH RUSSIAN 

01:45:28.766 --> 01:45:30.766
FORCES 

01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:35.216
IN UKRAINE. OUR FORCES ARE NOT 
GOING TO EUROPE TO FIGHT 

01:45:35.531 --> 01:45:39.182
UKRAINE, BUT TO DEFEND OUR NATO 
ALLIES IN THE EVENT THAT PUTIN 

01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:42.608
DECIDES TO KEEP MOVING WEST. FOR
THAT PURPOSE, WE HAVE MOBILIZED 

01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:45.085
AMERICAN GROUND FORCES, AIR 
SQUADRONS, SHIP DEPLOYMENTS, TO 

01:45:45.407 --> 01:45:47.881
DO PROTECT NATO COUNTRIES 
INCLUDING POLAND, WITH THE WAY 

01:45:48.202 --> 01:45:54.203
AND ESTONIA. AS I HAVE MADE 
CRYSTAL CLEAR, THE UNITED STATES

01:45:54.504 --> 01:45:58.011
AND OUR ALLIES WILL DEFEND EVERY
INCH OF TERRITORY THAT IS NATO 

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.338
TERRITORY WITH THE FULL FORCE OF
OUR COLLECTIVE POWER. EVERY 

01:46:04.246 --> 01:46:06.246
SINGLE INCH.

01:46:08.263 --> 01:46:14.284
WHEN WE ARE -- CLEAR, UKRAINIANS
ARE FIGHTING BACK 

01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:19.833
CARRIAGE. THE NEXT FEW DAYS, 
WEEKS, AND MONTHS WILL BE HARD 

01:46:20.134 --> 01:46:23.516
ON THEM. PUTIN HAS UNLEASHED 
VIOLENCE AND CHAOS. BUT WHILE HE

01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:28.565
MAY MAKE GAINS IN THE 
BATTLEFIELD, HE WILL PAY A 

01:46:28.873 --> 01:46:30.873
CONTINUING HIGH PRICE OVER THE 

01:46:33.471 --> 01:46:36.890
LONG RUN. AND A POUND OF 
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, THE PROUD, 

01:46:37.202 --> 01:46:40.350
PROUD PEOPLE, POUND FOR POUND, 
READY TO FIGHT WITH EVERY INCH 

01:46:40.692 --> 01:46:44.892
OF -- THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE KNOWN
30 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE. HAVE 

01:46:45.223 --> 01:46:48.369
REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT THEY WILL 
NOT TOLERATE ANYONE WHO TRIES TO

01:46:48.646 --> 01:46:51.696
TAKE THE COUNTRY BACKWARDS. TO 
ALL AMERICANS, I WILL BE HONEST 

01:46:52.004 --> 01:46:56.258
YOU AS I ALWAYS PROMISED I WOULD
BE. A RUSSIAN DIG TATER INVADING

01:46:56.531 --> 01:46:59.926
A FOREIGN COUNTRY HAS COST 
AROUND THE WORLD. AND I AM 

01:47:00.228 --> 01:47:03.824
TAKING ROBUST ACTION TO MAKE 
SURE THE PAIN OF OUR SANCTIONS 

01:47:04.154 --> 01:47:07.446
IS TARGETED AT THE RUSSIAN 
ECONOMY. AND THAT WE USE EVERY 

01:47:07.758 --> 01:47:10.241
TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO PROTECT 
AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND 

01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:15.770
CONSUMERS. TONIGHT, I CAN 
ANNOUNCE THE UNITED STATES HAS 

01:47:16.088 --> 01:47:19.336
WORKED WITH 30 OTHER COUNTRIES 
TO RELEASE 60 MILLION BARRELS OF

01:47:19.643 --> 01:47:23.452
OIL FROM RESERVED AROUND THE 
WORLD. AMERICA WILL LEAD THAT 

01:47:23.759 --> 01:47:25.759
EFFORT. RELEASING 30 MILLION 
BARRELS FROM 

01:47:28.389 --> 01:47:32.362
THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE 
AND WE STAND READY TO DO MORE IF

01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:35.548
NECESSARY. UNITED WITH OUR 
ALLIES. OF THESE STEPS WILL HELP

01:47:35.885 --> 01:47:40.298
BLUNT GAS PRICES HERE AT HOME. 
BUT I KNOW NEWS ABOUT WHAT IS 

01:47:40.607 --> 01:47:43.822
HAPPENING CAN SEEM ALARMING TO 
ALL AMERICANS. WHAT I WANT YOU 

01:47:44.150 --> 01:47:48.123
TO KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO BE 
OKAY. WE ARE GOING TO BE OKAY. 

01:47:48.439 --> 01:47:51.529
THE HISTORY OF THIS AREA IS 
WRITTEN, PUTIN'S UKRAINE WILL 

01:47:52.321 --> 01:47:59.064
HAVE LEFT -- WEAKER AND THE REST
OF THE WORLD STRONGER. WHILE IT 

01:48:03.337 --> 01:48:05.337
SHOULD --. WHILE 

01:48:09.154 --> 01:48:14.253
IT SHOULD, SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN 
SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE FOR 

01:48:14.911 --> 01:48:18.750
AROUND THE WORLD TO SEE WHAT IS 
AT STAKE, NOW EVERYONE SEES IT 

01:48:19.048 --> 01:48:22.026
CLEARLY. WE SEE THE UNITY AMONG 
LEADERS OF NATIONS. A MORE 

01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:28.677
UNIFIED EUROPE. A MORE UNIFIED 
WEST. WE SEE UNITY AMONG THE 

01:48:28.992 --> 01:48:31.816
PEOPLE WHO ARE GATHERING IN 
CITIES AND LARGE CROWDS AROUND 

01:48:32.128 --> 01:48:35.396
THE WORLD. EVEN IN RUSSIA, TO 
DEMONSTRATE THE SUPPORT FOR THE 

01:48:35.914 --> 01:48:38.796
PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. IN THE BATTLE
BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND 

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.948
AUTOCRACIES, DEMOCRACIES ARE 
RISING TO THE MOMENT. AND OF THE

01:48:42.273 --> 01:48:45.435
WORLD IS CLEARLY CHOOSING THE 
SIDE OF PEACE AND SECURITY. THIS

01:48:45.735 --> 01:48:50.775
IS A REAL TEST. AND IT IS GOING 
TO TAKE TIME. SO, LET US 

01:48:51.062 --> 01:48:53.806
CONTINUE TO DRAW INSPIRATION 
FROM THE IRON WILL OF THE 

01:48:54.112 --> 01:48:56.877
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. TWO OUR FELLOW
UKRAINIAN AMERICANS, WHO FORGED 

01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.755
A DEEP BOND THAT CONNECTS OUR 
TWO NATIONS. WE STAND WITH YOU. 

01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:07.317
WE STAND WITH YOU. PUTIN MAY 
CIRCLE KYIV WITH TANKS. BUT HE 

01:49:07.623 --> 01:49:10.758
WILL NEVER GAIN THE HEARTS AND 
SOULS OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. 

01:49:11.085 --> 01:49:14.284
HE WILL NEVER EXTINGUISH THE 
LOVE OF FREEDOM. AND HE WILL 

01:49:14.613 --> 01:49:16.613
NEVER, NEVER WEAKEN THE RESOLVE 
OF THE 

01:49:20.266 --> 01:49:22.266
FREE WORLD.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.846
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE MEET TONIGHT IN AN AMERICA
THAT HAS LIVED THROUGH TWO OF 

01:49:35.163 --> 01:49:40.540
THE HARDEST YEARS THIS NATION 
HAS EVER FACED. THE PANDEMIC HAS

01:49:40.833 --> 01:49:43.769
BEEN PUNISHING. AND, SO MANY 
FAMILIES ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO 

01:49:44.058 --> 01:49:47.156
PAYCHECK, STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP 
WITH THE RISING COST OF FOOD, 

01:49:47.475 --> 01:49:51.590
GAS, HOUSING, AND SO MUCH MORE. 
I UNDERSTAND, LIKE MANY OF YOU 

01:49:52.144 --> 01:49:55.862
DID, MY DAD HAD TO LEAVE HIS 
HOME IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, 

01:49:56.173 --> 01:50:00.233
TO FIND WORK SO, LIKE MANY OF 
YOU, I GREW UP WITH THE FAMILY 

01:50:00.528 --> 01:50:04.230
FOR THE PRICE OF FOOD WENT UP, 
IT WAS FELT THROUGHOUT THE 

01:50:04.557 --> 01:50:08.604
FAMILY. IT HAD AN IMPACT. THAT 
IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID

01:50:08.924 --> 01:50:12.117
AS PRESIDENT WAS FIGHT THE PAST,
TO PASS THE AMERICAN RESCUE 

01:50:12.418 --> 01:50:15.462
FUND. BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE 
HURTING. WE NEEDED TO ASK, TO 

01:50:15.793 --> 01:50:19.943
ASK, AND WE DID. TWO PIECES OF 
LEGISLATION HAVE DONE MORE IN 

01:50:20.258 --> 01:50:24.100
THE CRITICAL MOMENT IN HISTORY 
TO LIFT US OUT OF THE CRISIS. 

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:27.245
FUELED OUR EFFORTS TO VACCINATE 
THE NATION AND COME BACK 

01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:29.725
COVID-19. DELIVER IMMEDIATE 
ECONOMIC RELEASE TO TENS OF 

01:50:30.054 --> 01:50:33.178
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. TO HELP 
PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. REMEMBER 

01:50:33.721 --> 01:50:37.817
THOSE LONG LINES OF CARS WAITING
FOR HOURS JUST TO GET A BOX OF 

01:50:38.114 --> 01:50:41.138
FOOD PUT IN THE TRUNK. IT CUT 
THE COST OF HEALTHCARE 

01:50:41.435 --> 01:50:45.708
INSURANCE. AND AS MY DAD USED TO
SAY, IT GAVE THE PEOPLE JUST A 

01:50:46.024 --> 01:50:49.863
LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. 
UNLIKE THE $2 TRILLION TAX CUT 

01:50:50.201 --> 01:50:52.201
PASSED IN THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION, THAT BENEFITED 

01:50:52.437 --> 01:50:55.888
THE TOP 1% OF AMERICANS, THE 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN -- THE 

01:50:56.198 --> 01:51:01.473
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN HELPED 
WORKING PEOPLE AND LEFT NO ONE 

01:51:06.479 --> 01:51:11.210
BEHIND. FOLKS. AND IT WORKED. 

01:51:16.094 --> 01:51:18.094
IT WORKS.

01:51:27.194 --> 01:51:30.670
IT WORKS. IT CREATED JOBS, LOTS 
OF JOBS. IN FACT, OUR ECONOMY 

01:51:30.985 --> 01:51:35.349
CREATED 6.5 MILLION NEW JOBS 
JUST LAST YEAR. MORE JOBS IN 

01:51:38.794 --> 01:51:42.292
ONE YEAR THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES 

01:51:45.672 --> 01:51:49.206
AMERICA. THE ECONOMY GREW AT A 
RATE OF 5.7 LAST YEAR. THE 

01:51:49.503 --> 01:51:52.701
STRONGEST GROWTH RATE IN 40 
YEARS. AND THE FIRST UP IN 

01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.581
BRINGING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE TO 
OUR ECONOMY THAT HASN'T WORKED 

01:51:56.139 --> 01:51:59.355
FOR WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS 
NATION FOR TOO LONG. FOR THE 

01:51:59.667 --> 01:52:03.735
PAST 40 YEARS, WE WERE TOLD THE 
TAX RATE FOR THOSE AT THE TOP 

01:52:04.055 --> 01:52:07.119
AND BENEFITS WOULD TRICKLE DOWN 
AND EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT. BUT 

01:52:07.438 --> 01:52:10.202
THE TRICKLE-DOWN THEORY LED TO A
WEAKER ECONOMIC GROWTH, LOWER 

01:52:10.539 --> 01:52:13.682
WAGES, BIGGER DEFICITS AND A 
WIDENING GAP BETWEEN THE TOP AND

01:52:14.002 --> 01:52:19.365
EVERYONE ELSE IN NEARLY A 
CENTURY. 

01:52:20.717 --> 01:52:24.504
HARRIS AND I RAN FOR OFFICE AND 
I REALIZED WE HAD A FUNDAMENTAL 

01:52:24.837 --> 01:52:28.348
DISAGREEMENT ON THIS. BUT RAN 
FOR OFFICE WITH THE NEW ECONOMIC

01:52:28.645 --> 01:52:32.253
VISION FOR AMERICA. INVEST IN 
AMERICA. EDUCATE AMERICANS. GROW

01:52:32.576 --> 01:52:35.993
THE WORKFORCE. BUILD THE ECONOMY
FROM THE BOTTOM UP IN THE MIDDLE

01:52:36.304 --> 01:52:41.327
OUT, NOT FROM THE TOP DOWN. 
BECAUSE, WE KNOW, BECAUSE WE 

01:52:41.662 --> 01:52:43.662
KNOW-.

01:52:47.173 --> 01:52:50.519
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BECAUSE WE KNOW, WHEN THE 
MIDDLE CLASS GROWS, WITH THE 

01:52:50.823 --> 01:52:54.852
MIDDLE CLASS GROWS, THE POOR GO 
WAY UP IN THE WILL TO DO VERY 

01:52:55.134 --> 01:52:58.202
WELL. AMERICA USED TO HAVE THE 
BEST ROADS, BRIDGES AND AIRPORTS

01:52:58.515 --> 01:53:01.517
ON EARTH. AND NOW, OUR 
INFRASTRUCTURE IS RANKED 13th IN

01:53:01.932 --> 01:53:05.898
THE WORLD. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO 
COMPETE FOR THE JOBS IN THE 21st

01:53:06.228 --> 01:53:09.945
CENTURY IF WE DON'T EXIT. THAT 
IS WHAT I, WHAT WAS SO 

01:53:10.261 --> 01:53:12.261
IMPORTANT, TO PASS THE 
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW. 

01:53:12.522 --> 01:53:16.212
AND I THANKED MY REPUBLICAN 
FRIENDS WHO JOINED, TO INVEST 

01:53:16.535 --> 01:53:18.535
AND 

01:53:20.789 --> 01:53:22.789
REBUILD AMERICA. THE SINGLE 
BIGGEST INVESTMENT 

01:53:26.823 --> 01:53:30.365
IN HISTORY. WAS A BIPARTISAN 
EFFORT. I WANT TO THANK THE 

01:53:30.646 --> 01:53:34.419
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES WHO 
WORKED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE ARE

01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:36.896
DONE TALKING ABOUT 
INFRASTRUCTURE IN WEEKS. WE ARE 

01:53:37.227 --> 01:53:39.770
NOW TALKING ABOUT AN 
INFRASTRUCTURE DECADE.

01:53:43.373 --> 01:53:45.373
IT IS 

01:53:48.448 --> 01:53:53.297
GOING TO TRANSFORM AMERICA. TO 
PUT US ON THE PATH TO WIN THE 

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:57.216
ECONOMIC COMPETITION OF THE 21st
CENTURY. AND WE FACE THE REST OF

01:53:57.539 --> 01:54:00.767
THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY CHINA. I
HAVE TOLD XI XINGPING, IT HAS 

01:54:01.104 --> 01:54:06.364
NEVER BEEN A GOOD BET TO BET 
AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE 

01:54:06.686 --> 01:54:08.796
WILL CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, 

01:54:09.093 --> 01:54:11.093
MODERNIZING ROADS, AIRPORTS, 
PORTS, WATERWAYS, ALL ACROSS 

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:15.918
AMERICA. AND WE WILL DO IT TO 
WITHSTAND THE DEFECATING, 

01:54:16.231 --> 01:54:19.017
DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND PROMOTE A JUSTICE. WE

01:54:19.344 --> 01:54:21.865
WILL BUILD A NATIONAL NETWORK OF
500,000 ELECTRIC VEHICLE 

01:54:22.176 --> 01:54:25.016
CHARGING STATIONS. BEGIN TO 
REPLACE THE POISONOUS LEAD 

01:54:25.321 --> 01:54:28.295
PIPES, SO EVERY CHILD, EVERY 
AMERICAN HAS CLEAN WATER TO 

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:32.910
DRINK, AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL. WE
ARE GOING TO PROVIDE, 

01:54:35.974 --> 01:54:40.389
AFFORDABLE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET 
FOR EVERY AMERICAN. RURAL, 

01:54:40.678 --> 01:54:44.526
SUBURBAN, URBAN AND TRIBAL 
COMMUNITIES. 4000 PROJECTS HAVE 

01:54:44.826 --> 01:54:49.419
ALREADY BEEN ANNOUNCED. MANY OF 
YOU HAVE ANNOUNCE THE 

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:54.755
DISTRICTS. TONIGHT, I AM 
ANNOUNCING THAT THIS YEAR, WE 

01:54:55.078 --> 01:54:58.198
WILL START FIXING OVER 65,000 
MILES OF HIGHWAY AND 1500 

01:54:58.496 --> 01:55:00.830
BRIDGES IN DISREPAIR. 

01:55:05.705 --> 01:55:07.705
AND FOLKS,-.

01:55:14.175 --> 01:55:17.928
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN WE USE TAX PAYERS 
DOLLARS TO REBUILD AMERICA, WE 

01:55:18.219 --> 01:55:22.819
ARE GOING TO DO IT BY BUYING 
AMERICAN. BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS.

01:55:23.263 --> 01:55:25.263
SUPPORT 

01:55:27.905 --> 01:55:33.364
AMERICAN JOBS. THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT SPENDS ABOUT $600 

01:55:33.675 --> 01:55:36.191
BILLION A YEAR TO KEEP THIS 
COUNTRY SAFE 

01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:44.285
AND SECURE. HAS BEEN A LAW ON 

01:55:46.535 --> 01:55:49.047
TO MAKE SURE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS 
SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS AND 

01:55:49.359 --> 01:55:51.091
BUSINESSES. EVERY 
ADMINISTRATION, DEMOCRAT AND 

01:55:51.092 --> 01:55:54.248
REPUBLICAN, SAYS THEY WILL DO 
IT. BUT WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING 

01:55:54.531 --> 01:55:57.897
IT. WE WILL BY AMERICA, TO MAKE 
SURE EVERYTHING, FROM THE DECK 

01:55:58.228 --> 01:56:01.531
OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER, TO THE 
STEEL ON HIGHWAY GUARDRAILS, IS 

01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:05.617
MADE IN AMERICA FROM BEGINNING 
TO END. ALL OF IT. ALL OF IT. 

01:56:10.258 --> 01:56:12.258
BUT, FOLKS.

01:56:14.048 --> 01:56:17.803
TO COMPETE FOR THE JOBS OF THE 
FUTURE, WE ALSO NEED TO LEVEL 

01:56:18.101 --> 01:56:21.932
THE PLAYING FIELD WITH CHINA AND
OTHER COMPETITORS TOOK A THAT IS

01:56:22.257 --> 01:56:28.616
WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO PASS 
THE -- INNOVATION ACT SITTING IN

01:56:28.916 --> 01:56:31.109
CONGRESS IT WILL MAKE RECORD 
INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING 

01:56:31.405 --> 01:56:33.468
TECHNOLOGIES AND AMERICAN 
MANUFACTURING. USED TO INVEST 

01:56:33.793 --> 01:56:37.271
ALMOST 2% OF THE GDP IN RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT. WE DON'T NOW. 

01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:43.346
CHINA IS. LET ME GIVE YOU AN 
EXAMPLE WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT 

01:56:46.498 --> 01:56:50.233
TO PASS. IF YOU TRAVEL 20 MILES 
EAST OF COLUMBUS, OHIO, YOU WILL

01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:55.379
FIND 1000 EMPTY ACRES OF LAND. 
IT WON'T LOOK LIKE MUCH. BUT IF 

01:56:55.697 --> 01:56:59.410
YOU STOP AND LOOK CLOSELY, YOU 
WILL SEE A FIELD OF DREAMS. THE 

01:56:59.734 --> 01:57:02.845
GROUND IN WHICH AMERICA'S FUTURE
WILL BE BILLED. THAT IS WHERE 

01:57:03.138 --> 01:57:06.133
INTEL, THE AMERICAN COMPANY THAT
HELPED BUILD SILICON VALLEY, IS 

01:57:06.458 --> 01:57:09.701
GOING TO BUILD A $20 BILLION 
SEMICONDUCTOR MEGA SITE. UP TO 

01:57:10.014 --> 01:57:13.632
EIGHT STATE-OF-THE-ART FACTORIES
IN ONE PLACE. 10,000 

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:22.532
NEW JOBS. THOSE FACTORIES, THE 
AVERAGE JOB, ABOUT 135 THOUGHT 

01:57:22.836 --> 01:57:25.220
DOLLARS. $135,000 A YEAR. THE 
MOST SOPHISTICATED MANUFACTURING

01:57:25.517 --> 01:57:29.912
IN THE WORLD. TO MAKE COMPUTER 
CHIPS THE SIZE OF A FINGERTIP. 

01:57:30.237 --> 01:57:32.351
THAT POWER THE WORLD IN EVERYDAY
LIVES. FROM 

01:57:35.939 --> 01:57:38.416
SMART PHONES, TECHNOLOGIES AND 
THE INTERNET. TECHNOLOGIES YET 

01:57:38.733 --> 01:57:42.554
TO BE INVENTED. BUT THAT IS JUST
THE BEGINNING. INTEL CEO, PAT 

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:48.405
GELSINGER, WHO WAS HERE TONIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE PAT IS. PAT, 

01:57:48.713 --> 01:57:50.713
THERE YOU ARE. PAT, 

01:57:53.068 --> 01:57:55.068
STAND UP. 

01:57:58.405 --> 01:58:00.405
PAT.

01:58:03.842 --> 01:58:07.825
PAT CAME TO SEE ME AND HE TOLD 
ME, THEY ARE READY TO INCREASE 

01:58:08.133 --> 01:58:11.422
THEIR INVESTMENT FROM $20 
BILLION TO $100 BILLION. THAT 

01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:14.316
WOULD BE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT 
AND MANUFACTURING IN AMERICAN 

01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:18.092
HISTORY. AND ALL THEY ARE 
WAITING FOR IS FOR YOU TO PASS 

01:58:18.743 --> 01:58:23.230
THIS BILL TOOK A SO, LET'S NOT 
WAIT ANY LONGER. SEND IT TO MY 

01:58:23.536 --> 01:58:27.600
DESK. I WILL SIGN IT. AND WE 
WILL REALLY TAKE OFF IN A BIG 

01:58:27.898 --> 01:58:34.391
WAY. AND, FOLKS. INTEL IS NOT 
ALONE. 

01:58:35.633 --> 01:58:39.578
HAPPENING IN AMERICA. JUST LOOK 
AROUND AND YOU WILL SEE AN 

01:58:39.914 --> 01:58:41.914
AMAZING STORY OF THE 

01:58:44.418 --> 01:58:48.466
REBIRTH OF PRIDE THAT COMES FROM
STAMPING PRODUCTS, MADE IN 

01:58:48.773 --> 01:58:50.678
AMERICA. THE REVITALIZATION OF 
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. 

01:58:50.679 --> 01:58:53.927
COMPANIES ARE CHOOSING TO BUILD 
A NEW FACTORIES HERE. WHEN JUST 

01:58:54.244 --> 01:58:59.013
A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY WOULD HAVE
GONE OVERSEAS. THAT IS WHAT IS 

01:58:59.323 --> 01:59:02.070
HAPPENING. FORD IS INVESTING $11
BILLION IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES. 

01:59:02.359 --> 01:59:05.901
CREATING 11,000 JOBS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. GM IS MAKING THE 

01:59:06.204 --> 01:59:08.635
LARGEST INVESTMENT IN ITS 
HISTORY. $7 BILLION TO BUILD 

01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:13.008
ELECTRIC VEHICLES, CREATING 4000
JOBS IN MICHIGAN. ALL TOLD, 

01:59:13.325 --> 01:59:19.237
369,000 NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS 
CREATED IN AMERICA LAST YEAR 

01:59:24.241 --> 01:59:26.241
ALONE. FOLKS.

01:59:30.041 --> 01:59:32.260
-. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; POWERED BY PEOPLE I MET LIKE 

01:59:36.475 --> 01:59:39.234
JOJO BURGESS FROM GENERATIONS OF
UNION STEELWORKERS IN 

01:59:39.517 --> 01:59:42.617
PITTSBURGH, WHO IS HERE WITH US 
TONIGHT. WHERE ARE YOU, JOJO? 

01:59:42.930 --> 01:59:46.055
THERE YOU ARE. THANKS, BUDDY. AS
OHIO, AS OHIO SENATOR SHARON 

01:59:49.982 --> 01:59:53.854
BROWN SAYS,-. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS 

01:59:57.831 --> 02:00:02.224
SHARON BROWN SAYS, IT IS TIME TO
BURY THE LABEL, RUST BELT. IT IS

02:00:02.533 --> 02:00:05.327
TIME TO SEE WHAT USED TO BE 
CALLED THE RUST 

02:00:09.857 --> 02:00:14.089
BELT, BECOME THE HOME OF 
SIGNIFICANT RESURGENCE OF 

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:16.473
MANUFACTURING. AND WITH ALL THE 
BRIGHT SPOTS IN 

02:00:20.394 --> 02:00:23.236
OUR ECONOMY, RECORD JOB GROWTH, 
HIGHER WAGES, TOO MANY FAMILIES 

02:00:23.543 --> 02:00:26.723
ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH 
THE BILLS. INFLATION IS ROBBING 

02:00:27.049 --> 02:00:30.849
THEM OF GAINS THEY THOUGHT 
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO 

02:00:31.174 --> 02:00:35.042
FEEL. I GET IT. THAT IS WHY MY 
TOP PRIORITY IS GETTING PRICES 

02:00:35.333 --> 02:00:38.946
UNDER CONTROL TOOK A LOOK. OUR 
ECONOMY ROARED BACK FASTER THAN 

02:00:39.271 --> 02:00:41.271
ALMOST ANYONE PREDICTED. BUT THE

02:00:44.231 --> 02:00:47.874
PANDEMIC THAT -- THE BUSINESSES 
HAD HARD TIME HIRING A PEOPLE 

02:00:48.196 --> 02:00:51.392
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC TO KEEP 
UP PRODUCTION IN THE FACTORIES. 

02:00:51.722 --> 02:00:54.465
YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE MAKING 
THOSE BEAMS THAT WENT INTO 

02:00:54.964 --> 02:00:58.104
BUILDINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT,
THE FACTORY WAS CLOSED. THE 

02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:01.986
PANIC ALSO DISRUPTED THE GLOBAL 
SUPPLY CHAIN. FACTORIES CLOSED. 

02:01:02.316 --> 02:01:05.655
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT TAKES 
LONGER TO MAKE GOODS AND GET 

02:01:05.966 --> 02:01:09.708
THEM TO THE WAREHOUSES, TO THE 
STORES AND PRICES GO UP. LOOK AT

02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:15.653
CARS LAST YEAR. ONE THIRD OF ALL
THE INFLATION WAS BECAUSE OF 

02:01:15.954 --> 02:01:18.179
AUTOMOBILE SALES. THERE WEREN'T 
ENOUGH SEMICONDUCTORS TO MAKE 

02:01:18.483 --> 02:01:21.809
ALL THE CARS THAT PEOPLE WANTED 
TO BUY. AND GUESS WHAT? PRICES 

02:01:22.136 --> 02:01:24.663
OF AUTOMOBILES WENT WAY UP. 
ESPECIALLY USED VEHICLES AS 

02:01:24.972 --> 02:01:29.017
WELL. SO, WE HAVE A CHOICE. ONE 
WAY TO FIGHT INFLATION IS TO 

02:01:29.348 --> 02:01:32.318
DRIVE DOWN WAGES AND MAKE 
AMERICANS POORER. I THINK I HAVE

02:01:32.638 --> 02:01:35.441
A BETTER IDEA TO FIGHT 
INFLATION. LOWER YOUR COSTS, NOT

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:39.160
YOUR 

02:01:42.166 --> 02:01:44.166
WAGES. FOLKS.

02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:53.821
THAT MEANS, MAKE MORE CARS WITH 
SEMICONDUCTORS IN AMERICA. MORE 

02:01:54.137 --> 02:01:58.991
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INNOVATION IN
AMERICA TOOK A MORE GOODS, 

02:01:59.291 --> 02:02:01.291
MOVING FASTER AND CHEAPER IN 
AMERICA. 

02:02:04.607 --> 02:02:08.016
MORE JOBS WHERE YOU CAN EARN A 
GOOD LIVING IN AMERICA. INSTEAD 

02:02:08.314 --> 02:02:11.200
OF RELYING ON FOREIGN SUPPLY 
CHAINS, LET'S MAKE IT IN 

02:02:12.205 --> 02:02:14.205
AMERICA. 

02:02:17.207 --> 02:02:19.207
LOOK. ECONOMISTS-.

02:02:30.247 --> 02:02:32.247
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ECONOMISTS CALL THIS 
INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVE 

02:02:32.896 --> 02:02:36.540
CAPACITY OF OUR ECONOMY. I CALL 
IT BUILDING A 

02:02:41.188 --> 02:02:43.188
BETTER AMERICA. MY PLAN TO 

02:02:45.826 --> 02:02:50.509
FIGHT INFLATION WILL LOWER YOUR 
COST AND LOWER THE DEFICIT. 17 

02:02:50.826 --> 02:02:53.258
NOBEL LAUREATES IN ECONOMICS 
SAID MY PLAN WOULD EASE 

02:02:53.598 --> 02:02:58.146
LONG-TERM INFLATIONARY 
PRESSURES. TOP BUSINESS LEADERS,

02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:01.523
AND I BELIEVE MOST AMERICANS 
SUPPORT THE PLANT. HERE IS THE 

02:03:01.822 --> 02:03:09.223
PLAN. FIRST, CUT THE COST OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE PAY MORE 

02:03:09.527 --> 02:03:12.575
FOR THE SAME DRUG PRODUCED BY 
THE 

02:03:16.451 --> 02:03:20.008
SAME COMPANY IN AMERICA THAN ANY
OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. JUST

02:03:20.287 --> 02:03:23.109
LOOK AT INSULIN. 1 IN 10 
AMERICAN HAS DIABETES. IN 

02:03:23.413 --> 02:03:26.439
VIRGINIA I MET A 13-YEAR-OLD 
BOY, THE HANDSOME YOUNG MAN 

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.720
STANDING UP THERE. 

02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:37.074
JOSHUA DAVIS. HE AND HIS DAD 
BOTH HAVE TYPE I DIABETES. WHICH

02:03:37.363 --> 02:03:41.854
MEANS, THEY NEED INSULIN EVERY 
SINGLE DAY. INSULIN COSTS ABOUT 

02:03:42.429 --> 02:03:46.103
$10 A VIAL TO MAKE. THAT IS WHAT
IT COSTS THE PHARMACEUTICAL 

02:03:50.431 --> 02:03:53.109
COMPANY. BUT, DRUG COMPANIES 
CHARGE FAMILIES LIKE JOSHUA AND 

02:03:53.418 --> 02:03:56.819
HIS DAD UP TO 30 TIMES THAT 
AMOUNT. I SPOKE WITH JOSHUA'S 

02:03:57.146 --> 02:04:00.843
MOM. IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO 
LOOK AT YOUR CHILD, WHO NEEDS 

02:04:01.186 --> 02:04:04.848
INSULIN TO STAY HEALTHY. AND 
HAVE NO IDEA HOW IN GODS NAME 

02:04:05.174 --> 02:04:10.066
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY 
FOR IT. WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR 

02:04:10.394 --> 02:04:14.003
FAMILY. BUT WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR
DIGNITY. YOUR ABILITY TO LOOK 

02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:18.119
YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE. TO BE THE
PARENT YOU EXPECT YOURSELF TO 

02:04:18.468 --> 02:04:23.386
BE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK 
ABOUT THAT. THAT IS WHAT I THINK

02:04:23.696 --> 02:04:26.369
ABOUT. YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY, 
JOSHUA WAS HERE TONIGHT BUT 

02:04:26.685 --> 02:04:29.191
YESTERDAY WAS HIS BIRTHDAY. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY, BY THE 

02:04:29.486 --> 02:04:34.134
WAY. FOUR JOSHUA, AND 200,000 
OTHER YOUNG 

02:04:37.250 --> 02:04:40.851
DIABETES, LET'S COUNT THE COST 
OF INSULIN AT $35 A MONTH. SO 

02:04:41.138 --> 02:04:43.138
EVERYONE CAN 

02:04:46.033 --> 02:04:49.443
AFFORD IT. AND THE DRUG 
COMPANIES WILL DO VERY, VERY 

02:04:49.754 --> 02:04:51.754
WELL. THE 

02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:59.028
PROFIT MARGIN. WHILE WE ARE AT 
IT, I KNOW WE HAVE GREAT 

02:04:59.359 --> 02:05:01.824
DISAGREEMENTS ON THIS FLOOR WITH
THIS, LET'S LET MEDICARE 

02:05:02.134 --> 02:05:04.134
NEGOTIATE THE PRICE OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 

02:05:06.992 --> 02:05:08.992
THEY ALREADY SET THE PRICE FOR 

02:05:12.103 --> 02:05:14.933
VA DRUGS. LOOK. THE AMERICAN 
RESCUE PLAN IS HELPING MILLIONS 

02:05:15.239 --> 02:05:17.239
OF FAMILIES IN A RECORDABLE, 
AFFORDABLE 

02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:24.582
CARE ACT AS TO SAVE THEM $2400 A
YEAR ON THE HEALTH AGREEMENTS. 

02:05:24.913 --> 02:05:27.864
LET'S CLOSE THE COVERAGE GAP AND
MAKE THESE SAVINGS PERMANENT. 

02:05:28.196 --> 02:05:33.955
SECOND. LET'S CUT ENERGY COSTS 
FOR FAMILIES. AN AVERAGE OF $500

02:05:34.278 --> 02:05:36.780
A YEAR BY COMBATING CLIMATE 
CHANGE. LET'S PROVIDE AN 

02:05:37.090 --> 02:05:40.420
INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT TO 
WEATHERIZE YOUR HOME AND YOUR 

02:05:40.713 --> 02:05:42.713
BUSINESS. TO BE 
ENERGY-EFFICIENT, AND GET A 

02:05:46.848 --> 02:05:49.904
TAX CREDIT FOR IT. DOUBLE 
AMERICA'S CLEAN ENERGY 

02:05:50.233 --> 02:05:53.917
PRODUCTION AND SOLAR, WIND, AND 
SO MUCH MORE. LOWER THE PRICE OF

02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:57.039
ELECTRIC VEHICLES, SAVING 
ANOTHER $80 A MONTH THAT YOU ARE

02:05:57.366 --> 02:06:04.212
NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY AT THE 
PUMP. FOLKS. THIRD. THE THIRD 

02:06:04.529 --> 02:06:07.558
THING WE CAN DO TO CHANGE THE 
STANDARD OF LIVING FOR 

02:06:07.865 --> 02:06:13.675
HARD-WORKING FOLKS IS CUT THE 
COST OF CHILDCARE. THE COST OF 

02:06:18.689 --> 02:06:24.449
CHILDCARE. FOLKS. IF YOU LIVE IN
A MAJOR CITY IN AMERICA, 

02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:29.734
PAY UP TO $14,000 PER YEAR FOR 
CHILD CARE PER CHILD. I WAS A 

02:06:30.037 --> 02:06:34.124
SINGLE DAD FOR 5 YEARS RAISING 
IT TO RAISING TWO KIDS. I HAD A 

02:06:34.428 --> 02:06:38.414
LOT OF HELP. HAD A MOM AND DAD, 
A BROTHER AND A SISTER, THAT 

02:06:39.865 --> 02:06:42.952
REALLY HELPED. THE MIDDLE CLASS 
AND WORKING FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE

02:06:43.267 --> 02:06:47.021
TO PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THE 
INCOME TO CARE FOR THE YOUNG 

02:06:47.297 --> 02:06:51.048
CHILDREN. MY PLAN, MY PLAN WOULD
CUT THE COST OF CHILDCARE IN 

02:06:51.362 --> 02:06:53.362
HALF FOR MOST FAMILIES. 

02:06:57.197 --> 02:07:02.998
AND HELP PARENTS, INCLUDING 
MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO LEFT THE 

02:07:03.314 --> 02:07:05.562
WORKFORCE DURING THE PANDEMIC 
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD 

02:07:05.868 --> 02:07:09.013
CHILDCARE. TO BE ABLE TO GET 
BACK TO WORK, GENERATING 

02:07:09.339 --> 02:07:12.280
ECONOMIC GROWTH. MY PLAN DOESN'T
STOP THERE. IT ALSO INCLUDES 

02:07:12.573 --> 02:07:15.061
HOME AND LONG-TERM-CARE. MORE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PRE-K FOR 3 

02:07:15.393 --> 02:07:18.861
AND 4-YEAR-OLDS. ALL THESE WILL 
LOWER THE COST FOR FAMILIES. 

02:07:19.173 --> 02:07:21.914
UNDER MY PLAN, NOBODY, LET ME 
SAY THIS AGAIN, 

02:07:25.543 --> 02:07:28.229
NOBODY EARNING LESS THAN 
$400,000 A YEAR WILL PAY AN 

02:07:28.547 --> 02:07:34.505
ADDITIONAL PENNY AND NEW TAXES. 
NOT A SINGLE PENNY. I MAY 

02:07:37.858 --> 02:07:42.752
BE WRONG, BUT MY GUESS IS, IF WE
TOOK A SECRET BALLOT ON THIS 

02:07:43.057 --> 02:07:46.421
FLOOR, THAT WE WOULD ALL AGREE 
THAT THE PRESENT TAX SYSTEM 

02:07:46.738 --> 02:07:51.198
AIN'T FAIR. WE HAVE TO FIX IT. 
I'M NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH 

02:07:51.511 --> 02:07:55.331
ANYBODY. BUT LET'S MAKE 
CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY 

02:07:55.643 --> 02:07:58.895
AMERICANS START PAYING THEIR 
FAIR SHARE. LOOK. LAST YEAR, 

02:08:03.803 --> 02:08:09.311
LAST YEAR, LIKE CHRIS AND  TOM 
CARPER, AND MY DISTINGUISH 

02:08:09.626 --> 02:08:14.444
CONGRESSWOMEN, WE COME FROM THE 
LAND OF CORPORATE AMERICA. 

02:08:17.782 --> 02:08:20.224
INCORPORATION AMERICA THAN ANY 
OTHER STATE IN AMERICA COMBINED.

02:08:20.536 --> 02:08:22.536
AND 

02:08:24.244 --> 02:08:29.189
I STILL WON 36 YEARS IN A ROW. 
THE POINT IS, EVEN 

02:08:29.847 --> 02:08:32.971
UNDERSTAND, YOU SHOULD PAY JUST 
YOUR FAIR SHARE. LAST YEAR, 55 

02:08:33.269 --> 02:08:36.183
OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES 
EARNED $40 BILLION IN PROFIT. 

02:08:36.494 --> 02:08:38.494
AND PAID ZERO IN 

02:08:40.586 --> 02:08:46.211
FEDERAL TAXES. NOW, LOOK. IT IS 
NOT FAIR. THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE 

02:08:46.498 --> 02:08:49.508
THE 50% MINIMUM TAX RATES FOR 
CORPORATIONS. WE HAVE GOT -- 

02:08:49.827 --> 02:08:54.204
THAT IS WHY IN THE G7 AND OTHER 

02:08:56.098 --> 02:08:59.474
PUT TOGETHER, I WAS ABLE TO BE 
SOMEWHAT HOPEFUL, 130 COUNTRIES 

02:08:59.752 --> 02:09:01.752
AGREE ON A GLOBAL TAX RATE 

02:09:04.329 --> 02:09:07.998
SO COMPANIES CAN'T GET OUT OF 
PAYING THE TAXES AT HOME BY 

02:09:08.276 --> 02:09:10.659
SHIPPING JOBS IN FACTORIES 
OVERSEAS. IT WILL RAISE BILLIONS

02:09:10.959 --> 02:09:14.042
OF DOLLARS. THAT IS WHY I 
PROPOSE CLOSING LOOPHOLES FOR 

02:09:14.337 --> 02:09:18.512
THE VERY WEALTHY WHO DON'T PAY, 
WHO PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN A 

02:09:18.809 --> 02:09:22.588
TEACHER AND A FIREFIGHTER. SO, 
THAT IS MY PLAN. BUT WE HAVE TO 

02:09:22.912 --> 02:09:27.083
GO INTO MORE DETAIL LATER. I AM 
GOING TO, WE WILL GROW THE 

02:09:27.388 --> 02:09:30.240
ECONOMY. LOWER THE COST TO 
FAMILIES. SO, WHAT ARE WE 

02:09:30.568 --> 02:09:34.248
WAITING FOR? LET'S GET THIS 
DONE. WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE GOT TO

02:09:34.564 --> 02:09:39.237
MAKE CHANGES. FOLKS.-. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHILE YOU ARE 

02:09:42.492 --> 02:09:48.150
MY NOMINEES FOR THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE. WHICH PLAYS A CRITICAL 

02:09:48.710 --> 02:09:53.678
ROLE IN FIGHTING INFLATION. MY 
PLAN WILL NOT ONLY LOWER THE 

02:09:54.003 --> 02:09:57.627
COST AND GIVE FAMILIES A FAIR 
SHOT, IT WILL LOWER THE DEFICIT.

02:09:57.951 --> 02:10:00.613
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION NOT 
ONLY BALLOONED THE DEFECATES 

02:10:00.943 --> 02:10:03.718
WITH HER TAX CUTS FOR WEALTHY 
CORPORATIONS, IT UNDERMINED THE 

02:10:04.028 --> 02:10:06.028
WATCHDOGS, THE JOB 

02:10:08.924 --> 02:10:12.007
OF THOSE KEEPING PANDEMIC RELIEF
FUNDS FROM BEING WASTED. 

02:10:12.296 --> 02:10:15.118
REMEMBER WE HAVE THOSE DEBATES 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE 

02:10:15.423 --> 02:10:18.934
WATCHDOGS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE 
EVERY DAY HOW MUCH MONEY WAS 

02:10:19.265 --> 02:10:22.572
BEING SPENT AND WAS GOING TO THE
RIGHT PLACE? UNDER MY 

02:10:22.901 --> 02:10:26.037
ADMINISTRATION, THE WATCHDOGS 
ARE BACK. AND WE ARE GOING TO GO

02:10:26.322 --> 02:10:29.254
AFTER THE CRIMINALS WHO STOLE 
BILLIONS OF RELIEF MONEY MAN FOR

02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:33.537
SMALL BUSINESSES AND MILLIONS OF
AMERICAN. TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING

02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:36.876
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL
SOON NAME A CHIEF PROSECUTOR FOR

02:10:37.869 --> 02:10:39.869
PANDEMIC 

02:10:42.889 --> 02:10:47.905
FRAUD. LOOK. I THINK WE ALL 
AGREE, 

02:10:51.607 --> 02:10:55.548
THANK YOU. BY THE END OF THIS 
YEAR, THE DEFICIT WILL BE DOWN 

02:10:55.855 --> 02:10:59.844
TO LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT WAS
BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE. THE ONLY 

02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:03.225
PRESIDENT EVER TO CUT THE 
DEFICIT BY MORE THAN $1 TRILLION

02:11:03.539 --> 02:11:06.892
IN A SINGLE YEAR. LOWERING YOUR 
COST ALSO MEANT DEMANDING MORE 

02:11:07.212 --> 02:11:09.308
COMPETITION. I AM A CAPITALIST. 
BUT CAPITALISM WITHOUT 

02:11:09.612 --> 02:11:12.414
COMPETITION IS NOT CAPITALISM. 
CAPITALISM WITHOUT COMPETITION 

02:11:14.062 --> 02:11:16.062
IS EXPLOITATION. DRIES 

02:11:19.481 --> 02:11:21.481
UP PROFITS. AND CORPORATIONS 
HAVE 

02:11:26.054 --> 02:11:33.073
TO COMPETE, THEIR PROFITS GO UP 
IN YOUR PRICES GO UP WHEN THEY 

02:11:33.377 --> 02:11:35.906
DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE. SMALL 
BUSINESSES AND FAMILY FARMERS 

02:11:36.201 --> 02:11:39.811
AND RANCHERS, I NEED NOT TELL 
SOME OF MY OF REPUBLICAN FRIENDS

02:11:40.142 --> 02:11:43.371
IN MOST STATES, GUESS WHAT? YOU 
HAVE GOT 4 BASIC MEATPACKING 

02:11:43.686 --> 02:11:47.752
FACILITIES. THAT IS IT. YOU PLAY
WITH THEM OR YOU DON'T GET TO 

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:52.664
PLAY AT ALL. AND, YOU PAY A OF A
LOT MORE. A OF A LOT MORE. 

02:11:52.992 --> 02:11:56.350
BECAUSE, THERE ARE ONLY  FOUR. 
SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH OCEAN

02:11:56.646 --> 02:11:59.708
CARRIERS. MOVING GOODS IN AND 
OUT OF AMERICA. DURING THE 

02:12:00.035 --> 02:12:02.910
PANDEMIC, ABOUT HALF A DOZEN OR 
LESS FOREIGN OWNED COMPANIES 

02:12:03.217 --> 02:12:06.310
RAISE PRICES BY AS MUCH AS 1000%
AND MADE RECORD PROFITS. 

02:12:06.617 --> 02:12:09.945
TONIGHT, I AM -- CRACKDOWN ON 
COMPANIES OVERCHARGING AMERICAN 

02:12:10.256 --> 02:12:12.256
BUSINESSES AND 

02:12:14.178 --> 02:12:16.178
CONSUMERS. FOLKS.

02:12:20.578 --> 02:12:24.907
AS WALL STREET FIRMS TAKE OVER 
MORE NURSING HOMES, QUALITY IN 

02:12:25.210 --> 02:12:28.844
THOSE HOMES HAS GONE DOWN. AND 
COSTS HAVE GONE UP. THAT ENDS ON

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:35.739
MY WATCH. MEDICARE IS GOING TO 
SET HIGHER STANDARDS FOR NURSING

02:12:36.058 --> 02:12:39.419
HOMES, AND MAKE SURE LOVED ONES 
GET THE CARE THEY DESERVE AND 

02:12:40.157 --> 02:12:43.643
THAT THEY INSPECT AND THEY ARE 
LOOKED AT CLOSELY. WE ARE ALSO 

02:12:43.939 --> 02:12:48.497
GOING TO CUT COSTS TO KEEP THE 
ECONOMY GOING STRONG AND GIVING 

02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:50.979
WORKERS A FAIR SHOT. PROVIDE 
MORE TRAINING AND 

02:12:51.279 --> 02:12:53.963
APPRENTICESHIPS, HIRE THEM BASED
ON SKILLS, NOT JUST THEIR 

02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:57.140
DEGREES. LET'S PASS THE PAYCHECK
FAIRNESS ACT. RAISE THE MINIMUM 

02:12:57.412 --> 02:13:03.734
WAGE TO $15 PER HOUR. AND EXTEND
THE CHILD TAX CREDIT SO NO ONE 

02:13:04.024 --> 02:13:07.291
HAS TO RAISE A FAMILY IN 
POVERTY. -- PROGRAMS TO INCREASE

02:13:08.302 --> 02:13:10.302
OUR HISTORIC SUPPORT FOR HBCUS. 

02:13:14.139 --> 02:13:17.960
AND INVEST IN WHAT JILL, OUR 
FIRST LADY WHO TEACHES 

02:13:18.256 --> 02:13:20.256
FULL-TIME, CALLS AMERICA'S 
BEST-KEPT SECRET. COMMUNITY 

02:13:20.977 --> 02:13:22.977
COLLEGES. LOOK. 

02:13:26.122 --> 02:13:29.667
LET'S PAST THE PRO-ACT. WHEN A 
MAJORITY OF WORKERS WANT TO FORM

02:13:29.999 --> 02:13:34.495
A UNION, THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE
TO BE 

02:13:36.343 --> 02:13:40.023
OUR WORKERS AND WE BUILD AN 
ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP IN 

02:13:40.342 --> 02:13:44.209
THE MIDDLE OUT, TOGETHER, WE CAN
DO SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT DONE IN

02:13:44.517 --> 02:13:47.916
A LONG TIME. BUILD A BETTER 
AMERICA. FOR MORE THAN TWO 

02:13:48.244 --> 02:13:51.354
YEARS, COVEN HAS IMPACTED EVERY 
DECISION IN OUR LIVES. AND THE 

02:13:51.653 --> 02:13:55.002
LIFE OF THIS NATION. AND I KNOW 
YOU ARE TIRED. FRUSTRATED. AND 

02:13:55.295 --> 02:13:58.226
EXHAUSTED. OBJECT THAT DOESN'T 
EVEN COME CLOSE TO 1 MILLION 

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:02.022
PEOPLE WHO CITIZENS ARE DYING --
AT THE KITCHEN TABLE LOOKING AT 

02:14:02.349 --> 02:14:05.443
AN EMPTY CHAIR. BECAUSE THEY 
LOST SOMEBODY. BUT I ALSO KNOW 

02:14:05.765 --> 02:14:09.149
THIS. BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESS WE
HAVE MADE, BECAUSE OF YOUR 

02:14:09.471 --> 02:14:12.631
RESILIENCE, AND THE TOOLS THAT 
WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THIS 

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.759
CONGRESS, TONIGHT, I CAN SAY WE 
ARE MOVING FORWARD SAFELY, 

02:14:19.399 --> 02:14:23.617
BACK TO A MORE NORMAL ROUTINE. 
WE HAVE REACHED A NEW MOMENT IN 

02:14:23.925 --> 02:14:27.045
THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19. 
WHERE SEVERE CASES ARE DOWN A 

02:14:27.372 --> 02:14:31.356
LEVEL NOT SEEN SINCE JULY OF 
LAST YEAR. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, 

02:14:31.673 --> 02:14:35.259
THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL 
AND PREVENTION ISSUED A NEW MASK

02:14:35.584 --> 02:14:37.681
GUIDELINES. UNDER THE NEW 
GUIDELINES, MOST AMERICANS AND 

02:14:37.993 --> 02:14:42.722
MOST OF THE COUNTRY CAN NOW GO 
MASK FREE. AND BASED ON 

02:14:43.067 --> 02:14:45.067
PROJECTIONS, BASED 

02:14:47.244 --> 02:14:50.058
ON PROJECTIONS, MORE OF THE 
COUNTRY WILL REACH A POINT 

02:14:50.367 --> 02:14:54.509
ACROSS THAT POINT ACROSS THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND THANKS

02:14:54.819 --> 02:14:58.270
TO THE PROGRESS WE MADE IN THE 
PAST YEAR, COVID-19 NO LONGER 

02:14:58.587 --> 02:15:01.833
NEED CONTROL OUR LIVES. I KNOW 
SOME ARE TALKING ABOUT LIVING 

02:15:02.165 --> 02:15:05.651
WITH COVID-19. BUT TONIGHT, I 
SAY, THAT WE NEVER JUST EXCEPT 

02:15:05.977 --> 02:15:11.429
LIVING WITH COVID-19. WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO COMBAT THE VIRUS AS 

02:15:11.975 --> 02:15:14.733
WE DO OTHER DISEASES. AND 
BECAUSE THIS VIRUS MUTATES AND 

02:15:15.038 --> 02:15:18.211
SPREADS, WE HAVE TO STAY ON 
GUARD. FOR COMMONSENSE STEPS AS 

02:15:18.524 --> 02:15:23.102
WE MOVE FORWARD SAFELY, IN MY 
VIEW. FIRST. STAY PROTECTED WITH

02:15:23.382 --> 02:15:25.849
VACCINES AND TREATMENTS. WE KNOW
HOW INCREDIBLY AFFECT OF 

02:15:26.169 --> 02:15:29.022
VACCINES ARE. IF YOU ARE 
VACCINATED AND BOOSTED, YOU HAVE

02:15:29.351 --> 02:15:31.351
THE HIGHEST DEGREE 

02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:35.670
OF PROTECTION.

02:15:38.242 --> 02:15:41.013
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON 
VACCINATING MORE AMERICANS. NOW,

02:15:41.307 --> 02:15:45.233
I KNOW PARENTS WITH KIDS UNDER 5
ARE EAGER TO SEE THE VACCINES 

02:15:45.523 --> 02:15:48.071
AUTHORIZED FOR THE CHILDREN. 
SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING HARD TO 

02:15:48.378 --> 02:15:52.096
GET THAT DONE. I WILL BE READY 
OF WITH PLENTY OF VACCINES IF 

02:15:52.399 --> 02:15:56.036
AND WHEN THEY DO. WE ARE 
ALREADY, WE ARE ALSO READY WITH 

02:15:56.356 --> 02:15:58.884
ANTIVIRAL TREATMENTS. IF YOU GET
COVID-19, THE PFIZER POLL 

02:15:59.176 --> 02:16:02.596
REDUCES YOUR CHANCES OF ENDING 
UP IN THE HOSPITAL BY 90%. I 

02:16:02.928 --> 02:16:06.210
HAVE ORDERED MORE PILLS THAN 
ANYBODY IN THE WORLD HAVE. 

02:16:06.507 --> 02:16:09.892
PFIZER IS WORKING OVERTIME TO 
GET US 1 MILLION PILLS A SMART. 

02:16:10.219 --> 02:16:13.706
AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT NEXT 
MONTH. AND NOW, WE ARE LAUNCHING

02:16:14.029 --> 02:16:18.652
THE TEST TO TREAT INITIATIVE. SO
PEOPLE CAN GET TESTED AT THE 

02:16:18.965 --> 02:16:21.795
PHARMACY IF THEY PROOF POSITIVE,
RECEIVE ANTIVIRAL PILLS ON THE 

02:16:22.098 --> 02:16:26.115
SPOT AT NO COST. AND, FOLKS.

02:16:31.381 --> 02:16:35.136
IF YOU ARE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED, OR
HAVE SOME OTHER VULNERABILITY, 

02:16:35.432 --> 02:16:37.432
WE HAVE TREATMENTS AND FREE 

02:16:40.643 --> 02:16:43.103
HIGH-QUALITY MASKS. WE'RE 
LEAVING THE ONE BEHIND HER 

02:16:43.416 --> 02:16:47.067
IGNORING ANYONE'S NEEDS AS WE 
MOVE FORWARD. ON TESTING, WE 

02:16:47.393 --> 02:16:50.552
HAVE MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF TESTS AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN 

02:16:50.848 --> 02:16:54.251
ORDER THEM FOR FREE TO YOUR 
TRUSTED. WE HAVE ALREADY ORDERED

02:16:54.519 --> 02:16:56.932
PRETESTS. IF YOU ALREADY ORDERED
PRETESTS TONIGHT, I AM 

02:16:57.228 --> 02:17:01.561
ANNOUNCING YOU CAN ORDER ANOTHER
GROUP OF TESTS, GO TO COVID 

02:17:01.875 --> 02:17:05.280
TEST.GOV STARTING NEXT WEEK AND 
YOU CAN GET MORE TEST. SECOND. 

02:17:05.608 --> 02:17:07.608
WE MUST PREPARE FOR 

02:17:10.046 --> 02:17:13.861
NEW VARIANTS. OVER THE PAST, WE 
HAVE GOTTEN MUCH BETTER AT 

02:17:14.178 --> 02:17:16.695
DETECTING NEW VARIANTS. 
NECESSARY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO 

02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:20.108
DEVELOP NEW VACCINES WITHIN 100 
DAYS INSTEAD OF MAYBE MONTHS OR 

02:17:20.421 --> 02:17:24.131
YEARS. AND IF CONGRESS PROVIDES 
THE FUNDS WE NEED, WE WILL HAVE 

02:17:24.442 --> 02:17:28.142
NEW STOCK PILES OF TESTS, MASKS,
PILLS, READY IF NEEDED. I CANNOT

02:17:28.457 --> 02:17:32.380
PROMISE A NEW VARIABLE COME. BUT
I CAN PROMISE YOU, WE WILL DO 

02:17:32.687 --> 02:17:37.828
EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO 
BE READY IF IT DOES. THIRD.

02:17:41.938 --> 02:17:45.362
CAN AND THE SHUTDOWN OF SCHOOLS 
AND BUSINESSES. WE HAVE THE 

02:17:45.679 --> 02:17:51.721
TOOLS WE NEED. IT IS TIME FOR 
AMERICA TO GET BACK TO WORK IN 

02:17:52.041 --> 02:17:55.186
FILL OUR GREAT DOWNTOWNS WITH 
PEOPLE. PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME

02:17:55.538 --> 02:17:59.942
CAN FEEL SAFE AND BEGIN TO 
RETURN TO THEIR OFFICES. WE ARE 

02:18:00.258 --> 02:18:03.495
DOING THAT HERE IN THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:18:03.826 --> 02:18:07.162
FEDERAL WORKERS WILL ONCE AGAIN 
WORK IN PERSON. OUR SCHOOLS ARE 

02:18:07.474 --> 02:18:11.716
OPEN. LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY. 
OUR KIDS NEED TO BE IN SCHOOL.

02:18:20.218 --> 02:18:25.528
75% OF ADULT AMERICANS FULLY 
VACCINATED, AND HOSPITALIZATIONS

02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:27.870
DOWN 

02:18:30.095 --> 02:18:33.378
BY 77%, MOST AMERICANS CAN 
REMOVE THEIR MASK AND STAY IN 

02:18:33.692 --> 02:18:35.692
THE CLASSROOM AND MOVE 

02:18:37.651 --> 02:18:40.122
FORWARD SAFELY. WE ACHIEVED THIS
BECAUSE WE PROVIDED FREE 

02:18:40.426 --> 02:18:44.243
VACCINES, TREATMENTS, TESTS AND 
MASKS. COURSE, CONTINUING THIS 

02:18:44.575 --> 02:18:48.031
COSTS MONEY. SO, WILL NOT 
SURPRISE YOU, I WILL BE BACK TO 

02:18:48.337 --> 02:18:53.943
SEE YOU ALL. GOOD AS SOON SENT A
REQUEST TO CONGRESS. THE VAST 

02:18:54.217 --> 02:18:57.309
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS HAVE USED 
THESE TOOLS AND MAY AGAIN. WE 

02:18:57.638 --> 02:19:00.790
MAY NEED THEM AGAIN. SO, I 
EXPECT CONGRESS, I HOPE YOU'LL 

02:19:01.131 --> 02:19:03.938
PASS IT QUICKLY. FOURTH. WILL 
CONTINUE VACCINATING THE WORLD. 

02:19:04.242 --> 02:19:07.395
WE HAVE SENT 475 MILLION VACCINE
DOSES TO 112 COUNTRIES. MORE 

02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:10.861
THAN ANY NATION ON EARTH. WE 

02:19:13.902 --> 02:19:18.833
WON'T STOP. YOU CAN'T BUILD A 
WALL HIGH ENOUGH TO KEEP OUT A 

02:19:19.167 --> 02:19:22.542
VACCINE, THE VACCINE CAN STOP 
THE SPREAD OF 

02:19:25.783 --> 02:19:29.127
THESE DISEASES. YOU KNOW, WE 
HAVE LOST SO MUCH IN COVID-19. 

02:19:29.447 --> 02:19:33.870
TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER. WORSE OF 
ALL, THE LOSS OF LIFE TOOK A 

02:19:34.224 --> 02:19:39.277
LET'S USE THIS MOMENT TO RESET. 
SO, STOP 

02:19:41.176 --> 02:19:44.266
PARTISAN DIVIDING LINE. SEE IT 
FOR WHAT IT IS. A GOD-AWFUL 

02:19:44.567 --> 02:19:49.282
DISEASE. LET'S STOP SEEING EACH 
OTHER AS ENEMIES. AND 

02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:54.251
SEEING EACH OTHER FOR HER WE 
ARE. FELLOW 

02:19:59.263 --> 02:20:01.263
AMERICANS. LOOK.

02:20:08.814 --> 02:20:13.844
THE WASHINGTON POST WE CAN  
CHANGE HOW DIVIDED WE HAVE BEEN.

02:20:14.157 --> 02:20:19.116
IT WAS A LONG TIME IN COMING. 
BUT WE CAN CHANGE HOW TO MOVE 

02:20:19.397 --> 02:20:23.969
FORWARD. AND COVID-19 ANOTHER --
WE MUST FACE TOGETHER. I 

02:20:24.271 --> 02:20:27.109
RECENTLY VISITED NEW YORK CITY 
POLICE DEPARTMENT DAYS AFTER THE

02:20:27.473 --> 02:20:30.511
FUNERALS OF OFFICER WILBUR MORA 
AND HIS PARTNER, OFFICER JASON 

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:35.855
RIVERA. THEY WERE RESPONDING TO 
A 911 CALL WHEN THE MAN SHOT AND

02:20:36.172 --> 02:20:39.817
KILLED THEM WITH THE STOLEN GUN.
OFFICER MOORE WAS 27 YEARS OLD. 

02:20:40.127 --> 02:20:44.807
OFFICER RIVERA WAS 22 YEARS OLD.
BOTH DOMINICAN AMERICANS, WHO 

02:20:45.122 --> 02:20:48.906
GREW UP ON THE SAME STREETS THAT
THEY LATER CHOSE TO PATROL AS 

02:20:51.210 --> 02:20:54.544
POLICE OFFICERS. I SPOKE WITH 
THEIR FAMILIES. AND I TOLD HIM 

02:20:54.864 --> 02:20:59.307
WE WERE FOREVER IN DEBT FOR THE 
SACRIFICES. I WILL CARRY 

02:21:00.236 --> 02:21:03.113
MISSION TO RESTORE THE TRUST AND
SAFETY AND EVERY COMMUNITY 

02:21:03.409 --> 02:21:07.213
DESERVES. LIKE SOME OF YOU THAT 
HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE, I 

02:21:07.535 --> 02:21:11.213
HAVE WORKED WITH YOU ON THESE 
ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME. I KNOW 

02:21:11.512 --> 02:21:14.038
WHAT WORKS. INVESTIGATING CRIME 
PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY 

02:21:14.359 --> 02:21:18.326
POLICING. COPS WHO WALKED THE 
BEAT WHO KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD 

02:21:18.634 --> 02:21:20.634
AND WHO CAN RESTORE TRUST 

02:21:23.556 --> 02:21:26.573
AND SAFETY. LET'S NOT ABANDON 
OUR STREETS OR CHOOSE BETWEEN 

02:21:26.874 --> 02:21:29.627
SAFETY AND EQUAL JUSTICE. LET'S 
COME TOGETHER AND PROTECT OUR 

02:21:29.928 --> 02:21:31.928
COMMUNITIES, RESTORE TRUST, AND 
HOLD LAW ENFORCEMENT 

02:21:32.075 --> 02:21:35.849
ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS WHY THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS REQUIRED 

02:21:36.233 --> 02:21:39.514
BODY CAMERAS, AND CHOKEHOLD'S 
AND RESTRICTED NO NOT WARRANTS 

02:21:39.841 --> 02:21:43.668
FOR ITS OFFICERS. THAT'S WHY THE
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN THAT YOU 

02:21:43.998 --> 02:21:45.998
ALL PROVIDED 

02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:50.910
$350 BILLION. THE CITIES, STATES
AND COUNTIES CAN USE TO HIRE 

02:21:51.233 --> 02:21:53.233
MORE POLICE, INVESTED MORE 

02:21:55.989 --> 02:21:57.989
PROVEN STRATEGIES. PROVEN 

02:22:02.532 --> 02:22:06.516
STRATEGIES LIKE PROVEN 
STRATEGIES LIKE COMMUNITY -- 

02:22:07.072 --> 02:22:09.072
TRUSTED MESSENGERS, BREAKING THE

02:22:11.708 --> 02:22:14.791
SINNER -- GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE 
SOME HOPE. WE SHOULD ALL AGREE, 

02:22:15.118 --> 02:22:19.200
THE ANSWER IS NOT TO DEFUND THE 
POLICE. IT IS TO FUND THE 

02:22:19.531 --> 02:22:21.531
POLICE. FUND THEM. 

02:22:26.325 --> 02:22:30.168
FUND THEM. FUND THEM WITH 

02:22:35.178 --> 02:22:38.640
RESOURCES AND -- RESOURCES AND 
TRAINING THEY NEED TO PROTECT 

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.950
OUR COMMUNITIES. I ASKED 
DEMOCRATS AND 

02:22:44.652 --> 02:22:47.502
REPUBLICANS ALIKE TO PASS MY 
BUDGET AND KEEP OUR 

02:22:47.816 --> 02:22:51.196
NEIGHBORHOODS SAFE. AND WE WILL 
DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO 

02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:54.665
CRACKDOWN ON GUN TRAFFICKING. OF
GHOST GUNS, THAT YOU CAN BUY 

02:22:54.962 --> 02:22:57.777
ONLINE. ASSEMBLE AT HOME. NO 
SERIAL NUMBERS. CAN'T BE TRACED.

02:22:58.110 --> 02:23:01.583
I ASKED CONGRESS TO PASS PROVEN 
MEASURES TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.

02:23:01.883 --> 02:23:04.474
PASS UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND 
CHECKS. WHY SHOULD ANYONE ON THE

02:23:05.479 --> 02:23:10.516
TERRORIST LIST BE ABLE TO 
PURCHASE A WEAPON? WHY? WHY? 

02:23:15.408 --> 02:23:18.809
AND, FOLKS. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS 
WITH HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES UP 

02:23:19.106 --> 02:23:24.525
TO 100 ROUNDS. YOU THINK THE 
DEER ARE WEARING KEVLAR 

02:23:26.515 --> 02:23:28.755
LOOK. REPEAL THE LIABILITY 
SHIELD THAT MAKES GUN 

02:23:29.068 --> 02:23:31.798
MANUFACTURERS THE ONLY INDUSTRY 
IN AMERICA THAT CAN'T BE SUED. 

02:23:32.099 --> 02:23:38.763
THE ONLY ONE. IMAGINE, HAD WE 
DONE THAT WITH TOBACCO 

02:23:39.092 --> 02:23:41.294
MANUFACTURERS. THESE LAWS DON'T 
INFRINGE ON THE SECOND 

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:46.911
AMENDMENT, THEY SAVE LIVES. THE 
MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN 

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:50.743
AMERICA IS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. 
AND HAVE IT COUNTED. AND, LOOK. 

02:23:51.037 --> 02:23:55.229
IT IS UNDER ASSAULT. IN STATE 
AFTER STATE, NEW LAWS HAVE 

02:23:58.248 --> 02:24:01.406
BEEN PASSED. NOT ONLY TO 
SUPPRESS THE VOTE, WE HAVE BEEN 

02:24:01.689 --> 02:24:04.944
TO BEFORE. BUT TO SUBVERT THE 
ENTIRE ELECTION. WE CAN'T LET 

02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:08.991
THIS HAPPEN. TONIGHT, I CALL ON 
THE SENATE TO PASS, PASS THE 

02:24:09.301 --> 02:24:12.503
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT. PASS THE 
JOHN LEWIS ACT, VOTING RIGHTS 

02:24:12.821 --> 02:24:19.300
ACT. AND WHILE YOU ARE AT IT, 
PASS THE HIGHTS ACT SO AMERICANS

02:24:19.615 --> 02:24:24.029
KNOW WHO IS FUNDING OUR 
ELECTIONS. LOOK. TONIGHT, I LIKE

02:24:24.329 --> 02:24:27.480
TO HONOR SOMEONE WHO HAS 
DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO SERVE THE 

02:24:27.805 --> 02:24:32.578
COUNTRY. JUSTICE BREYER. AN ARMY
VETERAN, CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR,

02:24:32.903 --> 02:24:36.599
RETIRING JUSTICE OF THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT. JUSTICE 

02:24:36.924 --> 02:24:40.035
BREYER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
SERVICE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, 

02:24:40.361 --> 02:24:43.270
THANK YOU. I MEAN IT. 

02:24:48.177 --> 02:24:51.120
THANK YOU. WE 

02:24:54.368 --> 02:24:59.287
ALL KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR 
IDEOLOGY, WE ALL 

02:25:01.148 --> 02:25:03.148
MOST SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY A PRESIDENT HAS 

02:25:03.324 --> 02:25:08.791
IS NOMINATING SOMEONE TO SERVE 
ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 

02:25:09.093 --> 02:25:13.631
COURT. AS I DID 4 DAYS AGO, I 
HAVE NOMINATED THE CIRCUIT COURT

02:25:13.927 --> 02:25:17.404
OF APPEALS,  KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON.  ONE OF OUR NATION'S 

02:25:17.732 --> 02:25:23.276
TOP LEGAL MINDS. WILL CONTINUE 
JUSTICE BREYER LEGACY 

02:25:28.066 --> 02:25:31.607
OF EXCELLENT. THE FORMER TOP 
LITIGATOR IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. A

02:25:31.907 --> 02:25:34.951
FORMER FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER. 
FROM A FAMILY OF PUBLIC SCHOOL 

02:25:35.315 --> 02:25:37.315
EDUCATORS FROM A 

02:25:40.566 --> 02:25:44.011
FAMILY OF -- AND POLICE 
OFFICERS, SHE IS A CONSENSUS 

02:25:44.321 --> 02:25:47.159
BUILDER. SINCE SHE HAS BEEN 
NOMINATED, SHE HAS RECEIVED A 

02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:50.376
BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT INCLUDING
THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE. 

02:25:50.696 --> 02:25:53.118
AND FORMER JUDGES SUPPORTED BY 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. 

02:25:53.428 --> 02:25:56.873
FOLKS. IF WE ARE TO ADVANCE 
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, WE NEED TO 

02:25:57.185 --> 02:25:59.185
SECURE OUR BORDER AND FIX THE 

02:26:02.101 --> 02:26:04.101
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

02:26:15.741 --> 02:26:22.465
YOU MIGHT'VE GUESSED, I THINK WE
CAN DO BOTH. AND OUR BORDER, WE 

02:26:22.770 --> 02:26:25.607
HAVE INSTALLED NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
LIKE CUTTING-EDGE SCANNERS TO 

02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:29.331
BETTER DETECT DRUG SMILING. WE 
SET UP JOINT PATROLS IN MEXICO 

02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:32.587
AND GUATEMALA TO TO CATCH HUMAN 
TRAFFICKERS. WHERE PUTTING IN 

02:26:32.892 --> 02:26:36.763
PLACE DEDICATED IMMIGRATION 
JUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LARGER --

02:26:37.311 --> 02:26:40.064
VIOLENCE COULD HAVE A CASE 
ASSERTED FASTER. THOSE WHO 

02:26:43.223 --> 02:26:46.024
DON'T LEGITIMATELY ARE NOT HERE,
CAN GET SENT BACK. SCREENING, 

02:26:46.335 --> 02:26:50.817
SECURING COMMITMENTS AND -- 
SUPPORTING PARTNERS IN SOUTH AND

02:26:51.112 --> 02:26:53.653
CENTRAL AMERICA TO HOUSE 
REFUGEES AND SECURE THEIR OWN 

02:26:53.979 --> 02:26:57.525
BORDERS. WE CAN DO ALL THIS 
WHILE KEEPING WITH THE TORCH OF 

02:26:57.838 --> 02:27:01.264
LIBERTY. WAS LED A GENERATION OF
IMMIGRANTS TO THIS LAND. MY 

02:27:01.571 --> 02:27:04.375
FORBEARERS AND MANY OF YOURS. 
PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENS 

02:27:04.711 --> 02:27:06.740
FOR DREAMERS. THOSE ARE 
TEMPORARY STATUS, ESSENTIAL 

02:27:07.065 --> 02:27:13.837
WORKERS. REVISE OUR LAWS. 
BUSINESS NETWORK GETS WORKERS 

02:27:14.158 --> 02:27:19.268
THEY NEED. FAMILIES DON'T WAIT 
DECADES ARE --. IS NOT ONLY THE 

02:27:19.602 --> 02:27:23.871
RIGHT THING TO DO, IT IS THE 
ECONOMICALLY SMART THING TO DO. 

02:27:24.196 --> 02:27:26.741
THAT'S WHY IMMIGRATION REFORM IS
SUPPORTED EVERYONE FROM LABOR 

02:27:27.017 --> 02:27:29.780
UNIONS TO RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO 
THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 

02:27:30.079 --> 02:27:32.137
LET'S GET IT DONE ONCE AND FOR 

02:27:36.797 --> 02:27:38.797
ALL. FOLKS.

02:27:47.577 --> 02:27:49.814
ADVANCING LIBERTY AND JUSTICE 
ALSO REQUIRES PROTECTING THE 

02:27:50.147 --> 02:27:52.376
RIGHTS OF WOMEN. THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AFFIRMED BY

02:27:52.677 --> 02:27:55.893
ROE V WADE, STANDING PRESIDENT 
FOR HALF A CENTURY IS UNDER 

02:27:56.202 --> 02:27:59.521
ATTACK AS NEVER BEFORE. IF YOU 
WANT TO GO FORWARD, NOT 

02:27:59.852 --> 02:28:02.425
BACKWARDS, WE MUST PROTECT 
ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. PRESERVE A

02:28:02.727 --> 02:28:05.227
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND 
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE MATERNAL 

02:28:05.554 --> 02:28:10.438
HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS. 
AND, FOLKS. FOR OUR LGBT Q PLUS 

02:28:10.748 --> 02:28:15.096
AMERICANS, LET'S FINALLY GET THE
BIPARTISAN EQUALITY ACT TO MY 

02:28:15.395 --> 02:28:18.721
DESK. THE ONSLAUGHT OF STATE 
LAWS TARGETING TRANSGENDER 

02:28:19.041 --> 02:28:21.041
AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES IS 

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:29.401
SIMPLY WRONG. SAID LAST YEAR, 
ESPECIALLY TO OUR YOUNGER 

02:28:29.699 --> 02:28:32.512
TRANSGENDER AMERICANS, I WILL 
ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK AS YOUR 

02:28:32.801 --> 02:28:36.019
PRESIDENT, SO THAT YOU COULD BE 
YOURSELF AND REACH HER GOD-GIVEN

02:28:37.864 --> 02:28:44.538
POTENTIAL. FOLKS. AS I HAVE JUST
DEMONSTRATED, IT 

02:28:45.477 --> 02:28:52.090
WE DO NOT AGREE. WE DO AGREE ON 
A LOT MORE THINGS THAT WE 

02:28:52.406 --> 02:28:55.167
ACKNOWLEDGE. I SIGNED 80 
BIPARTISAN ILLS OF THE LAW 

02:28:58.515 --> 02:29:00.515
LAST YEAR. FROM PREVENTING 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, TO 

02:29:00.718 --> 02:29:03.911
PROTECTING ASIAN AMERICANS. 
STILL TO COME IN HATE CRIMES. TO

02:29:04.237 --> 02:29:09.482
REFORM MILITARY JUSTICE. WILL 
SOON BE -- ACT THAT I 

02:29:10.136 --> 02:29:14.939
WROTE THREE DECADES AGO. IT IS 
IMPORTANT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 

02:29:15.264 --> 02:29:17.264
US TO SHOW, TO SHOW 

02:29:21.807 --> 02:29:26.217
THE NATION,, WHEN WE COME 
TOGETHER, WE CAN DO BIG THINGS. 

02:29:26.502 --> 02:29:29.875
TONIGHT, I AM OFFERING A UNITY 
AGENDA FOR THE NATION. FOR BIG 

02:29:30.182 --> 02:29:33.992
THINGS WE CAN DO TOGETHER IN MY 
VIEW. FIRST, B THE OPIOID 

02:29:34.627 --> 02:29:36.627
EPIDEMIC. THERE IS SO MUCH WE 

02:29:39.323 --> 02:29:41.323
CAN DO. INCREASED FUNDING FOR 

02:29:44.058 --> 02:29:45.298
PREVENTION, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TREATMENT, GET -- RID 

02:29:45.299 --> 02:29:46.562
REDUCTION OF OUTDATED AND ROLES 
RECOVERY. THAT STOPPED GET 

02:29:46.563 --> 02:29:48.563
DOCTORSRID  OF OUTDATED RULES 
FROM PRESCRIBINGAND  STOP 

02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:51.335
DOCTORS, TREATMENTSTHAT STOP 
DOCTORS FROM PRESCRIBING . STOP 

02:29:51.545 --> 02:29:57.148
THE FLOW OF ILLICIT DRUGS BY 
WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:29:57.353 --> 02:29:59.353
ENFORCEMENT TO GO AFTER THE 
TRAFFICKERS.

02:30:04.789 --> 02:30:06.789
KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

02:30:09.978 --> 02:30:12.084
I BELIEVE IN RECOVERY AND I 
SUPPORT THE 23 MILLION AMERICANS

02:30:12.290 --> 02:30:14.290
IN RECOVERY. SECOND,

02:30:17.038 --> 02:30:19.145
LET'S TAKE A MENTAL HEALTH. 
ESPECIALLY IN OUR CHILDREN WHO&amp;amp; 

02:30:19.358 --> 02:30:22.792
LIVES IN EDUCATION UP AND TURNED
UPSIDE DOWN. PLEDGING MONEY TO 

02:30:23.005 --> 02:30:28.041
HELP TEACHERS MAKE UP FOR LOST 
LEARNING. I URGE EVERY PARENT TO

02:30:28.246 --> 02:30:31.962
MAKE SURE YOUR SCHOOL DOES JUST 
THAT. THEY HAVE THE MONEY. WE 

02:30:32.176 --> 02:30:37.979
CAN ALL PLAY A PART. SIGN UP TO 
BE A TUTOR OR MENTOR. CHILDREN 

02:30:38.185 --> 02:30:40.801
WERE ALSO STRUGGLING BEFORE THE 
PANDEMIC. BULLYING, VIOLENCE, 

02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:48.553
TRAUMA, THE HARMS OF SOCIAL 
MEDIA. AS FRANCIS HAUGEN WHO IS 

02:30:48.765 --> 02:30:52.859
HERE TONIGHT WITH US HAS SHOWN, 
WE MUST HOLD SOCIAL MEDIA 

02:30:53.267 --> 02:30:55.958
PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE 
NATIONAL EXPERIMENT THEY ARE 

02:30:56.164 --> 02:30:58.164
CONDUCTING ON OUR CHILDREN FOR 
PROFIT.

02:31:02.732 --> 02:31:09.255
FOLKS, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR 
THE COURAGE 

02:31:12.954 --> 02:31:16.064
TO STRENGTHEN PRIVACY 
PROTECTIONS. DOWN TARGETED 

02:31:16.270 --> 02:31:18.270
ADVERTISING TO CHILDREN.

02:31:20.833 --> 02:31:24.165
DEMAND THAT THEY STOP COLLECTING
PERSONAL DATA ON THEIR CHILDREN.

02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:26.990
LET'S GET ALL AMERICANS THE 
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY 

02:31:27.198 --> 02:31:29.907
NEED. MORE PEOPLE CAN TURN FOR 
HELP

02:31:33.871 --> 02:31:36.122
IN FULL PARITY BETWEEN PHYSICAL 
AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE IF WE 

02:31:36.334 --> 02:31:40.093
TREAT IT THAT WAY IN OUR 
INSURANCE. LOOK

02:31:43.187 --> 02:31:48.163
, THE THIRD PIECE OF THAT AGENDA
IS SUPPORT OUR VETERANS

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:55.189
VETERANS ARE THE BACKBONE AND 
THE SPINE OF THIS COUNTRY. THEY 

02:31:55.398 --> 02:32:02.581
ARE THE BEST OF US. I HAVE 
ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT WE HAVE A 

02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:05.260
SACRED OBLIGATION

02:32:13.845 --> 02:32:16.370
TO EQUIP THOSE THAT WE SENT TO 
WARREN CARE FOR THEM AND THEIR 

02:32:16.576 --> 02:32:18.275
FAMILY WHEN THEY COME HOME. MY 
ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED 

02:32:18.276 --> 02:32:19.985
ASSISTANCE IN JOB TRAINING, 
HOUSING, AND HELPING LOWER 

02:32:19.986 --> 02:32:22.321
INCOME VETERANS GET VA CARE FOR 
FREE. OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ FACED 

02:32:22.529 --> 02:32:24.549
MANY DANGERS. ONE BEING 
STATIONED AT BASES AND BREATHING

02:32:24.754 --> 02:32:28.009
IN TOXIC SMOKE FROM BURN PITS. 
MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN THERE.

02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:36.318
I HAVE BEEN TO IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN OVER 40 TIMES. THE 

02:32:36.534 --> 02:32:40.889
BURN PITS THAT INCINERATE WASTE.
THE WASTE OF WAR, MEDICAL AND 

02:32:41.098 --> 02:32:46.474
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. JET FUEL AND
SO MUCH MORE AND THEY COME HOME.

02:32:46.808 --> 02:32:50.823
THE WORLD'S FITTEST AND BEST 
TRAINED WARRIORS NEVER THE SAME.

02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:56.113
HEADACHES, NUMBNESS, DIZZINESS. 
A CANCER THAT WOULD

02:33:02.808 --> 02:33:08.358
PUT THEM IN A COFFIN. ONE OF 
THOSE SOLDIERS WAS MY SON, MAJOR

02:33:09.117 --> 02:33:14.220
BEAU BIDEN. I DON'T KNOW FOR 
SURE IF THE BURN. THAT WHO LIVED

02:33:14.442 --> 02:33:19.044
NEAR IN IRAQ AND EARLIER THAN 
THAT IN KOSOVO IS THE CAUSE OF 

02:33:19.272 --> 02:33:24.513
HIS BRAIN CANCER BUT I AM 
COMMITTED TO FIND 

02:33:25.673 --> 02:33:30.740
WE CAN. COMMITTED TO MILITARY 
FAMILIES LIKE DANIEL ROBINSON 

02:33:31.474 --> 02:33:33.474
FROM OHIO

02:33:38.639 --> 02:33:40.718
THE WIDOW OF SERGEANT FIRST 
CLASS HEATH ROBINSON. HE WAS 

02:33:40.942 --> 02:33:43.029
BORN A SOLDIER. ARMY NATIONAL 
GUARD. COMBAT MEDIC IN KOSOVO 

02:33:43.403 --> 02:33:48.377
AND IRAQ. STATIONS NEAR BAGHDAD 
JUST YARDS FROM BURN PITS THE 

02:33:48.722 --> 02:33:50.928
SIZE OF FOOTBALL FIELDS. 
DANIELLE IS HERE WITH US 

02:33:51.153 --> 02:33:57.733
TONIGHT. THEY LOVE GOING TO OHIO
STATE FOOTBALL GAMES.

02:34:12.624 --> 02:34:14.624
BELOVED BUILDING LEGOS WITH 
THEIR DAUGHTER. CANCER FROM 

02:34:14.810 --> 02:34:19.033
PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO BURN PITS 
RAVAGED HIS LUNGS 

02:34:21.266 --> 02:34:27.100
DANIELLE SAID HE WAS A FIGHTER 
TO THE VERY END. HE DID NOT KNOW

02:34:27.308 --> 02:34:32.205
HOW TO STOP FIGHTING AND NEITHER
DID SHE. SHE FOUND PURPOSE TO 

02:34:32.419 --> 02:34:35.961
DEMAND THAT WE DO BETTER. 
TONIGHT, DANIELLE, WE ARE GOING 

02:34:36.177 --> 02:34:39.218
TO DO BETTER. THE VA

02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:45.360
IS FINDING NEW WAYS OF LINKING 
TOXIC EXPOSURE TO DISEASE 

02:34:45.504 --> 02:34:47.504
ALREADY HELPING MORE VETERANS 
GET BENEFIT

02:34:52.042 --> 02:34:54.081
. TONIGHT I AM ANNOUNCING WE ARE
EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO 

02:34:54.291 --> 02:34:58.178
VETERANS SUFFERING FROM NINE 
RESPIRATORY CANCERS. I'M ALSO 

02:34:58.405 --> 02:35:00.502
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO PASS A 
LAW TO MAKE SURE VETERANS 

02:35:00.713 --> 02:35:02.713
DEVASTATED BY TOXIC EXPOSURE IN 
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN FINALLY GET

02:35:03.292 --> 02:35:06.213
THE BENEFIT.

02:35:18.258 --> 02:35:24.028
FORCE, AND LAST, LET'S END 
CANCER AS WE KNOW IT.

02:35:28.133 --> 02:35:30.133
PERSONAL

02:35:31.438 --> 02:35:33.438
.

02:35:41.421 --> 02:35:44.064
THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME AND JOE 
AND

02:35:51.611 --> 02:35:55.779
KAMALA HIM SO MANY OF YOU.  
CANCER IS THE NUMBER TWO CAUSE 

02:35:55.992 --> 02:35:59.261
OF DEATH IN AMERICA, SECOND ONLY
HEART DISEASE. LAST MONTH I 

02:35:59.468 --> 02:36:04.570
ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO SUPERVISE 
THE CANCER MOONSHOT. 

02:36:05.955 --> 02:36:10.616
TO CUT CANCER DEATH RATES BY AT 
LEAST 50% OVER THE NEXT 25 

02:36:10.829 --> 02:36:15.796
YEARS. I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER 
THAN THAT. TURNED CANCERS FROM 

02:36:16.003 --> 02:36:18.264
DEATH SENTENCES INTO TREATABLE 
DISEASES. MORE SUPPORT FOR 

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:23.382
PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. TO 
GET THERE I CALL ON CONGRESS TO 

02:36:23.591 --> 02:36:25.591
FUND WHAT I CALL

02:36:30.083 --> 02:36:32.083
ARPAH 

02:36:34.632 --> 02:36:36.557
ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECT AGENCY
FOR HEALTH. IT IS PATTERNED 

02:36:36.558 --> 02:36:41.219
AFTER THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. 
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LED TO THE 

02:36:41.438 --> 02:36:46.635
INTERNET AND GPS AND SO MUCH 
MORE THAT HAVE MADE OUR FORCES 

02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:50.567
SAFER AND ABLE TO WAGE WAR WITH 
MORE CLARITY. ARPAH WILL HAVE A 

02:36:50.774 --> 02:36:53.778
SINGULAR PURPOSE  -- TO DRIVE 
BREAKTHROUGHS IN CANCER, 

02:36:53.992 --> 02:36:55.992
ALZHEIMER'S, DIABETES,

02:37:00.701 --> 02:37:03.249
AND MORE. A UNITY AGENDA FOR THE
NATION. WE CAN DO THESE THINGS. 

02:37:03.469 --> 02:37:07.737
IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER. I DON'T 
SEE A PARTISAN EDGE TO ANY ONE 

02:37:07.951 --> 02:37:10.603
OF THOSE THINGS. MY FELLOW 
AMERICANS, TONIGHT WE HAVE 

02:37:10.826 --> 02:37:17.500
GATHERED IN THIS SACRED SPACE, 
THE CITADEL OF DEMOCRACY. IN 

02:37:17.712 --> 02:37:19.712
THIS

02:37:22.042 --> 02:37:24.577
CAPITOL  GENERATIONS OF 
AMERICANS HAVE MADE GREAT 

02:37:25.324 --> 02:37:29.355
DEBATES AND DONE GREAT THINGS. 
WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM, 

02:37:30.054 --> 02:37:33.398
EXPANDED LIBERTY, DEBATED 
TOTALITARIANISM AND TERROR.

02:37:37.794 --> 02:37:39.642
WE'VE BUILT THE STRONGEST, 
FREEST, AND MOST PROSPEROUS 

02:37:39.643 --> 02:37:44.349
NATION THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
NOW IS THE HOUR. OUR MOMENT OF 

02:37:44.565 --> 02:37:48.676
RESPONSIBILITY. OUR TEST OF 
RESOLVE AND CONSCIENCE OF 

02:37:49.288 --> 02:37:54.520
HISTORY ITSELF. IT IS IN THIS 
MOMENT THAT 

02:37:55.573 --> 02:38:00.247
THIS GENERATION IS FORMED. OUR 
PURPOSE IS FOUND. OUR FUTURE IS 

02:38:00.463 --> 02:38:06.113
FORGED. WELL, I KNOW THIS 
NATION. WE WILL MEET THE TEST. 

02:38:06.331 --> 02:38:09.985
PROTECT FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. 
EXPAND FAIRNESS AND OPPORTUNITY.

02:38:10.801 --> 02:38:16.664
WE WILL SAVE DEMOCRACY. AS HARD 
AS THOSE TIMES HAVE BEEN, I'M 

02:38:16.885 --> 02:38:20.206
MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA 
TODAY THAN I HAVE BEEN IN MY 

02:38:20.409 --> 02:38:23.640
WHOLE LIFE. I SEE THE FUTURE 
THAT IS IN OUR GRASS. I KNOW 

02:38:23.849 --> 02:38:27.211
THAT THERE IS SIMPLY NOTHING 
BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. WE ARE THE 

02:38:27.425 --> 02:38:31.965
ONLY NATION ON EARTH THAT HAS 
ALWAYS TURNED EVERY CRISIS WE 

02:38:32.170 --> 02:38:35.035
HAVE FACED INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. 
THE ONLY NATION THAT COULD BE 

02:38:35.243 --> 02:38:40.933
DEFINED BY A SINGLE WORD -- 
POSSIBILITIES. ON THIS NIGHT ON 

02:38:41.144 --> 02:38:45.263
OUR 245th YEAR AS A NATION, I 
HAVE COME TO REPORT ON THE STATE

02:38:45.475 --> 02:38:50.590
OF THE NATION, THE STATE OF THE 
UNION. MY REPORT IS THIS: THE 

02:38:50.806 --> 02:38:53.398
STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG 
BECAUSE YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

02:38:54.079 --> 02:38:59.210
, ARE STRONG. WE ARE STRONGER 
TODAY THAN WE WERE A 

02:39:01.794 --> 02:39:07.673
WE WILL BE STRONGER A YEAR FROM 
NOW THAN WE ARE TODAY. THIS IS 

02:39:08.431 --> 02:39:12.400
OUR MOMENT TO MEET AND OVERCOME 
THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME, AND 

02:39:12.661 --> 02:39:18.608
WE WILL AS ONE PEOPLE. ONE 
AMERICA. THE UNITED STATES OF 

02:39:18.829 --> 02:39:24.046
AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND 
MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. 

02:39:24.611 --> 02:39:29.553
THANK YOU. GO GET HIM. 

02:39:57.989 --> 02:40:00.270
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT BIDEN PLEDGING A 
UNITY AGENDA FOR THE NATION IN 

02:40:00.529 --> 02:40:02.529
HIS FIRST OFFICIAL STATE OF THE 
UNION ADDRESS. AN HOUR-LONG 

02:40:02.646 --> 02:40:04.931
SPEECH SPANNING TOPICS FROM THE 
WAR IN UKRAINE TO THE OPIOID 

02:40:05.147 --> 02:40:11.809
EPIDEMIC. WE SEE HIM THERE 
GREETING PEOPLE IN THE CHAMBER. 

02:40:12.022 --> 02:40:14.611
THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST. I AM JOINED 

02:40:14.824 --> 02:40:19.442
TONIGHT MY COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL
HILL OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND

02:40:19.655 --> 02:40:24.563
HERE IN THE NEWSROOM. LET'S GO 

02:40:30.648 --> 02:40:34.898
JOYCE KOH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  THIS WAS BIDEN IN HIS PRIME.

02:40:35.559 --> 02:40:40.075
AT TIMES WE HAVE SEEN PRESIDENT 
BIDEN LOW ENERGY, MAYBE FUMBLE 

02:40:40.295 --> 02:40:44.123
OVER HIS WORDS. TONIGHT THE TONE
WAS ONE THAT CONVEYED STRENGTH 

02:40:44.528 --> 02:40:48.989
AND PROJECTED THIS STEADINESS AS
HE DISCUSSED

02:40:53.748 --> 02:40:56.312
WHAT HE WAS DOING ABOUT THE WAR 
IN UKRAINE AS FAR AS PUNISHMENTS

02:40:56.965 --> 02:40:59.580
ON RUSSIA AND STANDING WITH THE 
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. HE WAS MET 

02:41:00.085 --> 02:41:04.550
WITH THIS ENERGY IN THE ROOM 
THAT WAS ONE OF COLLEGIALITY. WE

02:41:04.758 --> 02:41:07.241
SAW MEMBERS OF BOTH REPUBLICAN 
AND DEMOCRATIC SIDES

02:41:12.623 --> 02:41:14.117
STANDING UP FOR STANDING 
OVATIONS NUMEROUS TIMES, 

02:41:14.118 --> 02:41:16.177
ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE SPEECH WHEN HE WAS 

02:41:16.393 --> 02:41:18.190
ADDRESSING UKRAINE AND AMERICA'S
COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING 

02:41:18.191 --> 02:41:21.050
UKRAINE. ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS 
WHERE HE WAS --

02:41:25.013 --> 02:41:27.341
WHERE THE CROWD REALLY STOOD UP 
AND GAVE A STANDING OVATION WAS 

02:41:27.563 --> 02:41:30.496
WHEN BIDEN TALKED ABOUT, REALLY 
SQUARELY TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 

02:41:30.712 --> 02:41:36.515
SAYING, RUSSIA'S PUTIN.TO SHAKE 
THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE FREE 

02:41:36.724 --> 02:41:40.892
WORLD THINKING HE COULD MAKE IT 
BEND TO HIS MENACING WAYS. HE 

02:41:41.105 --> 02:41:44.125
WENT ON TO SAY PUTIN THOUGHT HE 
COULD ROLL INTO UKRAINE AND THE 

02:41:44.349 --> 02:41:49.230
WORLD WOULD ROLLOVER. INSTEAD HE
WAS MET WITH A WALL THAT HE 

02:41:49.444 --> 02:41:51.592
NEVER COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED OR 
IMAGINED. HE WAS MET WITH THE 

02:41:52.149 --> 02:41:55.394
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. BIDEN REALLY 
TALKING ABOUT HOW STRONG THE 

02:41:55.604 --> 02:41:58.105
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE ARE IN THIS 
MOMENT WHERE RUSSIA IS 

02:41:58.328 --> 02:42:02.523
INCREASING THEIR AGGRESSION 
AGAINST CIVILIANS AS WELL AS 

02:42:03.246 --> 02:42:06.444
UKRAINIAN MILITARY. HE TALKED 
ABOUT HOW UKRAINIAN PEOPLE ARE 

02:42:06.672 --> 02:42:10.680
IN THE STREETS, BLOCKING RUSSIAN
TANKS. HE ALSO HAD THIS REALLY 

02:42:10.894 --> 02:42:15.900
PHENOMENAL MOMENT WITH THE 
UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR WHO WAS THE

02:42:16.127 --> 02:42:19.558
GUEST OF THE FIRST LADY. SHE 
STOOD UP AS HE SAID TO MAKE YOUR

02:42:19.766 --> 02:42:24.508
SIGNAL TO THE WORLD AS THIS 

02:42:25.984 --> 02:42:30.411
APPLAUDED HER IN UNITY. HE 
ANNOUNCED SEVERAL PUNISHMENTS ON

02:42:30.625 --> 02:42:35.453
RUSSIA FOR THEM TO BE EXACT. 
INCLUDING ENFORCING ECONOMIC 

02:42:35.661 --> 02:42:40.773
SANCTIONS WITH ALLIES. CUTTING 
OFF, MOST RECENTLY, RUSSIA'S 

02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:45.631
ACCESS TO THE FINANCIAL WORLD AT
LARGE. THE MOST RECENT SANCTION 

02:42:45.863 --> 02:42:50.335
BEING TARGETING THE RUSSIAN 
CENTRAL BANK. HE ALSO TALKED 

02:42:50.568 --> 02:42:52.852
ABOUT CUTTING OFF RUSSIA'S 
ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY SAYING THAT

02:42:56.784 --> 02:42:59.034
IT WILL SAP THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY 
AND WEAKEN ITS MILITARY FOR 

02:42:59.241 --> 02:43:02.613
YEARS TO COME. HE ANNOUNCED THAT
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL 

02:43:02.820 --> 02:43:04.820
BE ESTABLISHING A TASK FORCE TO 
GO AFTER RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS 

02:43:05.422 --> 02:43:09.765
SAYING THAT WE ARE JOINING WITH 
EUROPEAN ALLIES TO FIND AND SEES

02:43:09.987 --> 02:43:13.891
YOUR YACHT, LUXURY APARTMENTS, 
WE ARE COMING FOR YOUR 

02:43:14.602 --> 02:43:17.503
ILL-GOTTEN GAINS. FOURTH HE 
MENTIONED AND ANNOUNCED

02:43:21.065 --> 02:43:23.200
THAT HE WILL BE JOINING U.S. 
ALLIES IN CLOSING OFF U.S. 

02:43:23.407 --> 02:43:28.711
AIRSPACE TO RUSSIAN FLIGHT. HE 
ADDED THAT THIS WILL ADD AN 

02:43:28.927 --> 02:43:31.245
ADDITIONAL SQUEEZE ON THE 
ECONOMY. WITH THE

02:43:36.986 --> 02:43:39.276
RUBLE ALREADY DOWN 30% OF VALUE.
WHEN HE TRANSITIONED  FROM 

02:43:39.501 --> 02:43:43.205
TALKING ABOUT UKRAINE TO 
DOMESTIC POLICY HE REALLY GAVE A

02:43:43.418 --> 02:43:46.691
MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 
REASSURING THEM THAT WE ARE 

02:43:46.925 --> 02:43:51.603
GOING TO BE OKAY. HE SAID, WHEN 
THIS AREA OF HISTORY IS WRITTEN,

02:43:51.817 --> 02:43:56.169
PUTIN'S WERE ON THE PLANE WILL 
HAVE LEFT RUSSIA WEAKER AND THE 

02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:58.940
REST STRONGER

02:44:03.745 --> 02:44:05.434
AGAIN PRESENTING STRENGTH AND 
CONFIDENCE IN THE UKRAINIAN 

02:44:05.435 --> 02:44:07.579
PEOPLE, PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY 
AND THE UNITY OF THE U.S. AND 

02:44:07.789 --> 02:44:11.003
THEIR ALLIES AGAINST PUTIN AND 
RUSSIAN FORCES THAT ARE RIGHT 

02:44:11.217 --> 02:44:13.217
NOW IN UKRAINE.

02:44:15.922 --> 02:44:18.274
HE ENDED THE SPEECH BY SAYING 
THE STATE OF THE UNION IS 

02:44:18.483 --> 02:44:23.921
STRONG. THIS CAME AFTER TALKING 
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF 

02:44:24.131 --> 02:44:26.654
DEMOCRACY. THAT WAS ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE WERE WAITING TO HEAR. 

02:44:27.379 --> 02:44:33.248
HE REALLY DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS 
COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND SAID

02:44:33.457 --> 02:44:35.457
THAT IS WHAT WILL OVERCOME

02:44:39.782 --> 02:44:41.064
THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY 
CURRENTLY FACE. 

02:44:41.065 --> 02:44:43.065
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:44:46.217 --> 02:44:48.359
JOYCE KOH REPORTING OUTSIDE OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ARE WATCHING

02:44:48.577 --> 02:44:50.857
PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKE A SLOW 
DEPARTURE FROM THE CHAMBER  AS 

02:44:51.071 --> 02:44:53.180
HE SPEAKS TO SO MANY PEOPLE, 
INCLUDING JUSTICE BREYER JUST A 

02:44:53.387 --> 02:44:55.551
MOMENT AGO. THAT WAS SUCH A 
TOUCHING MOMENT IN THE SPEECH 

02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:57.760
WHEN HE PRAISED JUSTICE BREYER

02:45:01.505 --> 02:45:05.067
. HE HAD SUCH A GENUINE HUMAN 
REACTION. TELL US MORE ABOUT 

02:45:05.386 --> 02:45:07.691
SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS TONIGHT 
AND HOW CONGRESS REACT IT.

02:45:15.633 --> 02:45:17.774
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: OUT OF THE GATE 
WHEN UKRAINE WAS MENTIONED AND 

02:45:17.982 --> 02:45:20.152
HE ALSO MENTIONED HE WOULD BE 
CLOSING OFF AMERICAN AIRSPACE TO

02:45:20.362 --> 02:45:22.748
RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT, YOU SAW A LOT 
OF RESOUNDING SUPPORT. HE SAW 

02:45:22.967 --> 02:45:26.172
PEOPLE STANDING AND CLAPPING. 
YOU SEE THAT THE CHAMBER, BOTH 

02:45:26.383 --> 02:45:30.657
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, WERE 
STANDING BEHIND THE PRESIDENT ON

02:45:30.867 --> 02:45:34.114
HOW HE WANTS TO TAKE ON THIS 
ISSUE OF UKRAINE AND HELPING THE

02:45:34.708 --> 02:45:37.375
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. I DO NOT KNOW 
WHAT IT WILL BE

02:45:40.776 --> 02:45:42.909
LEGISLATION GETS TO THE FLOOR 
AND UKRAINE WHETHER IT BE A 

02:45:43.123 --> 02:45:46.729
FUNDING PACKAGE OR SOMETHING AND
HOW THAT WILL SHAPE UP. FOR NOW 

02:45:46.945 --> 02:45:49.697
THEY ALL SEEM TO BE IN A UNIFIED
SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

02:45:49.906 --> 02:45:53.359
APPROACH TO UKRAINE. HE ALSO 
DISCUSSED BUILD BACK BETTER 

02:45:53.564 --> 02:45:57.205
WITHOUT SAYING BUILD BACK AT 
HER. THAT IS THE SOCIAL SPENDING

02:45:57.426 --> 02:46:01.981
PACKAGE THAT HE TRIED TO GET 
THROUGH EARLIER IN THE WINTER. 

02:46:02.385 --> 02:46:05.483
IT SOMEWHAT FAILED IN 
NEGOTIATIONS IN THE SENATE, BUT 

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:11.241
WHAT HE DID WAS PULLED OUT PARTS
OF THAT LEGISLATION. BRINGING 

02:46:11.452 --> 02:46:14.500
DOWN THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL 
DRUGS AND HE EVEN HAD ONE OF HIS

02:46:14.708 --> 02:46:19.362
GUESTS, A YOUNG BOY THAT NEEDS 
INSULIN. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HIS

02:46:19.581 --> 02:46:21.747
PARENTS HAD TO PAY FOR THE 
INSULIN AND THAT SHOULD COME 

02:46:21.955 --> 02:46:25.137
DOWN. HE TALKED ABOUT EXPANDING 
CHILD TAX CREDITS AND MEDICARE. 

02:46:25.364 --> 02:46:30.348
THOSE ARE ALL PART OF BUILD BACK
AT HER BUT HE SORT OF RECAST IT 

02:46:30.563 --> 02:46:36.433
TONIGHT. HE IS SAYING THESE ARE 
THE ISSUES WE WOULD LIKE TO 

02:46:36.639 --> 02:46:38.883
TACKLE. WE WILL SEE IF THAT 
APPROACH WORKS. TWO THINGS THAT 

02:46:39.092 --> 02:46:41.092
STOOD OUT TO ME.

02:46:43.606 --> 02:46:46.162
HE HAD REPUBLICANS ON THEIR FEET
ON TWO ISSUES HE MIGHT BE TRYING

02:46:46.373 --> 02:46:49.041
TO GET AHEAD OF IN TERMS OF WHAT
THEY ARE READYING AS THEIR 

02:46:49.256 --> 02:46:51.416
BATTLE AGAINST HIM FOR THE 
MIDTERMS. ONE WAS A PHRASE WHERE

02:46:51.626 --> 02:46:54.700
HE SAID WE DO NOT NEED TO THE 
FUND THE POLICE WE NEED TO FUND 

02:46:54.934 --> 02:46:59.010
THEM. I SAW KEVIN McCARTHY, 
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER STANDUP. I

02:46:59.224 --> 02:47:03.341
SAW MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY STAND UP ON THAT LINE.

02:47:06.886 --> 02:47:08.886
CALLED ON MORE

02:47:11.612 --> 02:47:13.708
IMMIGRATION REFORM. I SAW TED 
CRUZ STANDUP AND A NUMBER OF 

02:47:13.919 --> 02:47:16.817
REPUBLICAN STANDUP. HE SEEMED TO
GET AHEAD OF A LOT OF THE ISSUES

02:47:17.041 --> 02:47:21.515
THAT HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED ON AND
TRYING TO MAKE A COMMONSENSE 

02:47:21.724 --> 02:47:26.462
APPROACH. WE LEARNED THAT HE 
WOULD SET UP A CHIEF PROSECUTOR 

02:47:26.672 --> 02:47:29.388
FOR PANDEMIC FRAUD AT THE DOJ. 
THAT WAS PART OF THE SPEECH WHEN

02:47:29.597 --> 02:47:32.178
HE DISCUSSED WHERE WE ARE WITH 
THE PANDEMIC AND WHERE WE ARE 

02:47:32.382 --> 02:47:36.028
GOING. THOSE WERE SOME OF THE 
HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME BUT IT SEEMED 

02:47:36.231 --> 02:47:39.246
AS IF HE KNEW THE ROOM. HE KNEW 
THAT THIS IS A DIVIDED SENATE 

02:47:39.452 --> 02:47:42.168
AND A DIVIDED HOUSE AND HE 
WANTED TO GIVE SOMETHING TO 

02:47:42.736 --> 02:47:47.551
EVERYONE TONIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

02:47:47.552 --> 02:47:50.503
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER 
PRESIDENT BIDEN LEAVES THE 

02:47:50.715 --> 02:47:52.758
CHAMBER WE EXPECT TO HEAR THE 
REPUBLICAN RESPONSE. THAT WILL 

02:47:52.972 --> 02:47:57.079
BE DELIVERED BY THE IOWA 
GOVERNOR. LET'S GO TO JAMES FOR 

02:47:57.291 --> 02:47:59.291
MORE ON THE MAJOR TAKEAWAYS

02:48:02.024 --> 02:48:04.877
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS A VERY STRIKING, 

02:48:05.096 --> 02:48:07.096
MODERATE TONE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT.

02:48:10.419 --> 02:48:12.684
BRUCE REED'S FINGERPRINTS WERE 
ALL OF THAT SPEECH. HE IS A 

02:48:12.898 --> 02:48:14.898
MODERATE CENTRIST DEMOCRAT FROM 
THE CORPORATE RING OF THE PARTY.

02:48:15.073 --> 02:48:17.611
IT WAS BILL CLINTON'S TOP IN 
THIS TO POLICY ADVISOR AND HE 

02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:22.247
HELPED BILL CLINTON RESET AFTER 
BIG LOSSES FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE 

02:48:22.958 --> 02:48:25.634
1994 WEIGHT MIDTERMS SO THAT 
CLINTON COULD WIN IN 1996.

02:48:32.272 --> 02:48:34.272
TOUGH ON POLICING AND SPEAKING 
OUT AGAINST

02:48:42.842 --> 02:48:44.867
DEFUNDING THE POLICE. WHEN HE 
TALKED ABOUT ABORTION HE NOTABLY

02:48:45.076 --> 02:48:47.846
DID NOT USE THE WORD  ABORTION. 
HE DID NOT USE THE TERM BUILD 

02:48:48.511 --> 02:48:53.265
BACK BETTER. OBVIOUSLY ENDING 
WITH WHAT HE CALLED

02:48:56.773 --> 02:48:58.688
THE UNITY AGENDA. THE FOUR 
THEMES THAT CAN BRING 

02:48:58.689 --> 02:49:01.162
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 
TOGETHER FIGHTING CANCER HELPING

02:49:01.381 --> 02:49:05.262
VETERANS TACKLE ADDICTION AND 
MENTAL HEALTH. IT WAS REALLY THE

02:49:05.888 --> 02:49:10.881
MOST MODERATE SOUNDING SPEECH WE
HAVE HEARD FROM JOE BIDEN SINCE 

02:49:11.097 --> 02:49:13.097
HE BECAME PRESIDENT.

02:49:15.955 --> 02:49:17.955
IT

02:49:20.783 --> 02:49:22.696
IS MINIMIZING DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S
LOSSES AND CLEARLY AIMED AT 

02:49:22.697 --> 02:49:24.719
APPEALING TO INDEPENDENTS WHO 
CLEARLY DID NOT LIKE DONALD 

02:49:25.203 --> 02:49:27.203
TRUMP AND MAYBE GAVE

02:49:31.251 --> 02:49:33.802
BIDEN A CHANCE AND ARE NOT HAPPY
WITH WHAT THEY'VE GOTTEN SO FAR 

02:49:34.008 --> 02:49:35.928
AND TRYING TO WIN SOME OF THOSE 
PHOTOS BACK. 

02:49:35.929 --> 02:49:39.949
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHICH IS SUCH AN INTERESTING 
OBSERVATION BY YOU, MOVING 

02:49:40.379 --> 02:49:42.379
TOWARD A DIVIDED GOVERNMENT.

02:49:45.552 --> 02:49:48.141
THERE'S A PRIMARY IN TEXAS TODAY
AND MIDTERMS SEASON IS ALREADY 

02:49:48.356 --> 02:49:50.356
UNDERWAY.

02:49:56.419 --> 02:49:58.630
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT THAT HE ENDED WITH 
A CRESCENDO

02:50:04.339 --> 02:50:07.028
THAT TIED IT ALL TOGETHER. AT 
THE VERY TOP HE SAID WE ARE 

02:50:07.242 --> 02:50:10.303
BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE A YEAR 
AGO AND WE WILL BE BETTER OFF A 

02:50:10.516 --> 02:50:12.838
YEAR FROM NOW THAN WE WERE 
TODAY. IT WOULD HAVE SOUND A 

02:50:13.048 --> 02:50:15.258
LITTLE TONE DEAF BUT HE REALLY 
DID, IN THE ECONOMIC SECTIONS 

02:50:15.470 --> 02:50:17.470
LAYOUT

02:50:21.956 --> 02:50:24.283
THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. 
THREADED THE NEEDLE WHERE HE DID

02:50:24.496 --> 02:50:27.031
NOT SOUND LIKE HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT AN ECONOMY THAT A LOT OF 

02:50:27.248 --> 02:50:29.549
AMERICANS DO NOT RECOGNIZE. WE 
TALKED ABOUT, BEFORE THE SPEECH,

02:50:31.485 --> 02:50:33.485
TRYING TO DEFLECT BLAME FOR 
RISING PRICES TO CORPORATIONS. 

02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:37.094
WE HEARD HIS ATTACK ON THE MEAT 
PROCESSING AND PACKAGING AND 

02:50:37.863 --> 02:50:43.573
KIND OF THE MORE POPULIST FIVE 
WITH THAT ALLOWED HIM TO 

02:50:43.785 --> 02:50:45.785
ULTIMATELY GET TO THE POINT 
WHERE

02:50:50.152 --> 02:50:52.515
ANOTHER MODERATE HE THING HE 
SAID WAS KIDS SHOULD BE BACK IN 

02:50:52.722 --> 02:50:55.006
SCHOOL. LET'S TURN THE PAGE ON 
COVID. LET'S CHANGE THIS FROM 

02:50:55.215 --> 02:50:57.323
PANDEMIC TO ENDEMIC WHICH IS 
WHAT A LOT OF MODERATE VOTERS 

02:50:57.535 --> 02:51:01.968
WANT TO HEAR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLD AND, LET'S TALK 

02:51:02.176 --> 02:51:07.969
ABOUT THE OP TICKS. VERY FEW 
MASKS AND A LOT OF BLUE AND 

02:51:08.183 --> 02:51:10.796
YELLOW FOR UKRAINE. THE FIRST 
LADY WEARING A BRILLIANT BLUE 

02:51:11.016 --> 02:51:15.554
DRESS WITH A LITTLE INVERTED 
SUNFLOWER RIGHT AT THE WRIST. 

02:51:15.955 --> 02:51:17.767
TALK TO US ABOUT SYMBOLISM 
TONIGHT. 

02:51:17.768 --> 02:51:19.768
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:51:23.232 --> 02:51:29.005
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SAW A LOT OF 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. HE SAW 

02:51:29.211 --> 02:51:31.348
RIBBONS IN THE COLORS OF THE 
UKRAINIAN FLAG. THESE WERE ALL 

02:51:31.555 --> 02:51:35.262
SYMBOLS TO SHOW THAT THIS WHOLE 
CHAMBER IS AWARE OF THE 

02:51:35.478 --> 02:51:38.470
SITUATION AND THEY ARE STANDING 
IN SOLIDARITY RIGHT NOW. THAT 

02:51:38.873 --> 02:51:43.486
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE MASKS. 
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES 

02:51:44.186 --> 02:51:47.888
THAT THIS CHAMBER HAS SEEN A 
MASK OPTIONAL REGULATION

02:51:51.090 --> 02:51:54.212
. BEFORE EVERYBODY HAD TO BE 
MASKED ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. YOU 

02:51:54.426 --> 02:51:59.352
FACE TO FIND IF YOU DID NOT COME
MASKED. 

02:52:00.609 --> 02:52:04.313
OPTIONAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE JUST 
A FEW -- I HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE 

02:52:04.523 --> 02:52:08.006
TO COUNT JUST SEVERAL WHO HAD 
MASKS ON. THAT, AGAIN,

02:52:17.098 --> 02:52:19.252
KIND OF UNDERSCORES WHERE HE 
WANTED TO BE TONIGHT. IS TALKING

02:52:19.462 --> 02:52:21.814
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT WE 
ARE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. 

02:52:22.039 --> 02:52:24.587
IT IS STILL WITH US. WILL HAVE 
TO BE AWARE THAT VARIANTS COULD 

02:52:24.802 --> 02:52:26.904
POP UP BUT FOR NOW THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO SHOW THAT 

02:52:27.242 --> 02:52:31.142
THE PANDEMIC IS HOPEFULLY BEHIND
US OR AT LEAST IS ENDEMIC AND 

02:52:31.364 --> 02:52:34.993
WILL MOVE FORWARD AS NEEDED. HE 
ALSO DISCUSSED THAT PEOPLE CAN 

02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:39.959
GO ON AND ORDER MORE TESTS FROM 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT IS 

02:52:40.169 --> 02:52:42.312
SOMETHING HE STARTED ABOUT A 
MONTH AGO. YOU SAYING YOU CAN 

02:52:42.529 --> 02:52:46.565
SIGN UP FOR MORE TESTS. THE 
OPTICS TONIGHT, THOSE ARE ALWAYS

02:52:46.779 --> 02:52:50.869
AN IMPORTANT HEART OF THE STATE 
OF THE UNION. SEEING WHAT IS 

02:52:51.081 --> 02:52:53.612
HAPPENING AND WHO IS DOING WHAT 
IN THE CHAMBER. I CAN TELL YOU 

02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:59.323
RIGHT NOW, MOST OF THE MEMBERS 
WHO HAVE LEFT THE CHAMBER 

02:52:59.956 --> 02:53:02.497
VERY NEAR ME. I KNOW AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE SHOW IT WAS 

02:53:02.719 --> 02:53:06.203
VERY QUIET WHERE WE WERE. THAT'S
NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE 

02:53:06.422 --> 02:53:08.576
A LOT OF LAWMAKERS COMING 
THROUGH TO GET THE REACTION. WE 

02:53:08.815 --> 02:53:11.654
HOPE TO TALK TO A FEW SOON. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING IN HANNAH JEWELL.

02:53:13.398 --> 02:53:18.559
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR AND 
THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE? 

02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:21.084
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING TO 
HEAR FROM KIM REYNOLDS THE 

02:53:21.294 --> 02:53:25.779
GOVERNOR OF IOWA ELECTED IN 2016
. SHE WAS PREVIOUSLY THE 

02:53:26.525 --> 02:53:31.133
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. WHAT WE 
WILL HERE IS HER CONTRASTING HER

02:53:31.355 --> 02:53:33.355
STYLE OF LEADERSHIP AND 
DECISIONS IN IOWA WITH THOSE OF 

02:53:33.514 --> 02:53:35.514
BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS,

02:53:39.036 --> 02:53:41.286
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 
COVID. IOWA HAS HAD VERY FEW 

02:53:41.501 --> 02:53:43.501
RESTRICTIONS. SHE'S BEEN AGAINST
MASKS,

02:53:47.974 --> 02:53:49.974
VACCINE MANDATES. SHE BAND 
SCHOOLS FROM BEING ABLE TO 

02:53:50.068 --> 02:53:52.443
IMPLEMENT MANDATES AND SCHOOLS. 
WE WILL HEAR HER TOUCH ON THAT 

02:53:52.649 --> 02:53:55.021
AS WELL AS OTHER CONTRAST SUCH 
AS HOW SHE HAS OPPOSED THE 

02:53:55.232 --> 02:53:57.232
TEACHING OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. 
THAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY

02:54:01.313 --> 02:54:03.313
TALK THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
AMONG REPUBLICANS. SHE'S OPPOSED

02:54:03.454 --> 02:54:08.369
THE INCLUSION OF TRANS KIDS IN 
SPORTS. WE HEARD BIDEN SPEAKING 

02:54:08.586 --> 02:54:10.734
ABOUT THAT AND SPEAKING UP FOR 
TRANS KIDS. SHE HAS LIMITED 

02:54:11.289 --> 02:54:13.944
ABORTION ACCESS AND CUT STATE 
TAXES AND IS A STAUNCH SUPPORTER

02:54:14.841 --> 02:54:19.399
OF DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE SEEN A 
FEW LINES FROM THIS SPEECH SHE 

02:54:19.614 --> 02:54:22.488
IS ABOUT TO GIVE AT LEAST AS IT 
WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE ADDRESS. 

02:54:22.703 --> 02:54:27.242
WE KNOW FROM THAT THAT SHE IS 
PLANNING TO DESCRIBE BIDEN AND 

02:54:27.452 --> 02:54:30.115
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SENDING THE 
COUNTRY BACK IN TIME TO THE LATE

02:54:30.331 --> 02:54:33.612
70s AND 80s. MOMENT SHE WOULD 
DESCRIBE AS A TIME OF HIGH 

02:54:33.831 --> 02:54:38.925
INFLATION, CRIME, AND COLD WAR 
TENSIONS. WE CAN EXPECT HER TO 

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:43.166
SPEAK ABOUT THE AFGHANISTAN 
WITHDRAWAL AND HOW IT, IN HER 

02:54:43.381 --> 02:54:47.903
WORDS, EMBOLDENED OUR ENEMIES TO
TRY TO PIN THE SITUATION ON 

02:54:48.119 --> 02:54:53.547
UKRAINE AT LEAST SOME BLAME ON 
BIDEN AND HIS LEADERSHIP. THE 

02:54:53.762 --> 02:54:55.762
UNITED STATES. THERE WAS 
ACTUALLY A MOMENT THAT WE HEARD 

02:54:55.928 --> 02:54:58.261
IN THE SPEECH WHEN BIDEN WAS 
SPEAKING ABOUT

02:55:02.641 --> 02:55:04.641
VETERANS AND ABOUT THOSE 
VETERANS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR 

02:55:04.723 --> 02:55:08.388
LIVES. WE HEARD REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSWOMAN LAUREN BARBER 

02:55:08.599 --> 02:55:10.599
YELLING OUT THAT YOU PUT THEM

02:55:14.783 --> 02:55:16.783
IN THE GROUND. FOLLOWED BY 
DEMOCRATS BILLING. YOU SEE THAT 

02:55:17.387 --> 02:55:21.617
SORT OF MOMENT THAT IS HAPPENING
AND THAT TENSION THERE. AS FOR 

02:55:22.345 --> 02:55:24.345
KIM REYNOLDS,

02:55:27.132 --> 02:55:29.710
THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST SPEECH 
OF HER CAREER SO FAR. OFTEN THE 

02:55:29.925 --> 02:55:32.466
BOTTLE IS USED AND GIVEN TO 
SOMEBODY WHO IS SEEN AS A RISING

02:55:32.681 --> 02:55:35.333
STAR IN THE OPPOSING PARTY. SHE 
IS NOT A YOUNG STAR, 

02:55:35.547 --> 02:55:38.721
NECESSARILY. SHE IS A 
GRANDMOTHER BUT SHE IS STILL 

02:55:38.932 --> 02:55:43.914
SEEN AS A POTENTIAL FIGURE TO 
TAKE A ROLE IN THE NATIONAL 

02:55:44.130 --> 02:55:49.204
STAGE IN THE COMING YEARS. WE 
SEEM TO SEE DURING BIDEN'S 

02:55:49.422 --> 02:55:52.657
SPEECH ONLY SEEMED TO GO THROUGH
AND TRY TO HEAD OFF A SOURCE OF 

02:55:52.867 --> 02:55:57.484
CRITICISMS AT THE PASS AHEAD OF 
MIDTERMS AND THE REBUTTAL AND 

02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:02.185
THE CRITICISM. PARTICULARLY 
AWESTRUCK WHEN IT CAME TO COVID,

02:56:02.398 --> 02:56:05.203
SOMETHING THAT IS SO CENTRAL TO 
HER REPUTATION AS A GOVERNOR WHO

02:56:05.414 --> 02:56:10.421
HANDLED COVID DIFFERENTLY THAN 
MOST OF THE COUNTRY THE LACK OF 

02:56:10.633 --> 02:56:13.662
MASKS THAT WE SAW TONIGHT MIGHT 
PREVENT HER FROM BEING ABLE TO 

02:56:13.874 --> 02:56:18.956
CLAIM THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT 
MOVING FORWARD IN THE PANDEMIC. 

02:56:19.172 --> 02:56:24.471
WE WILL SEE WHAT SHE SAYS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE 

02:56:24.704 --> 02:56:27.248
CHAMBER IS CLEARING OUT. THE 
PRESIDENT HAS LEFT AND YOU SAW 

02:56:27.455 --> 02:56:31.339
HIM THEY'RE DOING A COUPLE LAST 
HANDSHAKES EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE 

02:56:31.546 --> 02:56:33.685
THAT ARE RUNNING THE CAMERAS IN 
THE HOUSE CHAMBER TONIGHT. LET'S

02:56:33.893 --> 02:56:38.440
GO TO JAMES FOR MORE ON SOME OF 
THE DYNAMICS AT PLAY THIS 

02:56:38.652 --> 02:56:40.652
EVENING.

02:56:42.425 --> 02:56:44.790
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT 
WHAT HAPPENED. PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE

02:56:44.995 --> 02:56:46.906
HEARD SOMEBODY YELLING OUT AS 
PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS TALKING 

02:56:46.907 --> 02:56:51.803
ABOUT VETERANS, SPECIFICALLY 
ABOUT HIS SON A VETERAN WHO DIED

02:56:52.021 --> 02:56:55.225
OF CANCER. WE HEARD SOMEBODY 
YELL OUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT 

02:56:55.441 --> 02:56:57.441
WAS

02:57:01.661 --> 02:57:03.503
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN 
FROM COLORADO. AS THE PRESIDENT 

02:57:03.504 --> 02:57:05.504
WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE AMERICAN
WARRIORS AND FLAG DRAPED COFFINS

02:57:05.610 --> 02:57:07.610
SHE YELLED OUT 13 OF THEM. THAT 
GOT

02:57:11.934 --> 02:57:14.204
BOOZE AND A SHOCKED RESPONSE 
FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER

02:57:14.418 --> 02:57:16.795
BECAUSE SHE WAS YELLING THIS OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPEECH. 

02:57:17.013 --> 02:57:20.443
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS NOT SURPRISING COMING 
FROM HER. SHE DEFEATED SCOTT 

02:57:20.652 --> 02:57:25.385
TIPTON WHO WAS A VERY 
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN AND SHE 

02:57:25.598 --> 02:57:30.761
RAN AGAINST HIM FROM THE RIGHT 
IN 2020. SHE HAS RUN-IN WITH TO 

02:57:30.984 --> 02:57:35.979
A LOT OF TROUBLE REFUSING TO 
WEAR A MASK IT ALSO SAYING SHE 

02:57:36.194 --> 02:57:38.150
WAS CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON 
AROUND WASHINGTON, D.C. WHEN 

02:57:38.151 --> 02:57:42.515
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED. SHE IS 
SOMEBODY WHO IS OFTEN COMPETING 

02:57:43.479 --> 02:57:45.670
WITH MARJORIE TAYLOR

02:57:50.317 --> 02:57:52.437
GREENE TO TRY TO GET ATTENTION. 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS HAS 

02:57:52.646 --> 02:57:58.357
BECOME A PATTERN  AND A LOT OF 
THE STATE OF THE UNION'S. YOU 

02:57:58.573 --> 02:58:00.778
WILL REMEMBER THE 2009 ADDRESS 
FROM OBAMA TO CONGRESS WHERE JOE

02:58:01.005 --> 02:58:02.790
WILSON THE REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSMAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

02:58:02.791 --> 02:58:07.312
YELLED ELI AS OBAMA WAS TALKING 
ABOUT HEALTHCARE. THIS IS ONE OF

02:58:07.525 --> 02:58:09.525
THOSE THINGS WHERE IT IS 
UNFORTUNATE.

02:58:17.466 --> 02:58:20.318
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DOES GO BOTH WAYS. WE SAW 
SPEAKER PELOSI RIP UP DONALD 

02:58:20.538 --> 02:58:22.797
TRUMP'S SPEECH IN A PRIOR 
ADDRESS. THE QUESTION IS AS WE 

02:58:23.018 --> 02:58:25.686
WATCH FOR THIS QUESTION AS UNITY
AS THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING FOR 

02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:29.121
WHAT DO THESE DISPLAYS DEAL? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:58:32.656 --> 02:58:35.539
IT'S TENSION. DOES HE TRY TO BE 
BIPARTISAN OR KIND OF FDR.

02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:44.059
THERE ARE AIDES IN BOTH CAMPS. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR 

02:58:44.292 --> 02:58:46.751
BIDEN WHO THINK HE SHOULD PICK A
FIGHT WITH REPUBLICANS AND RAN 

02:58:46.978 --> 02:58:49.906
AGAINST THEM AS THE OIL OR THE 
BAD GUY. HIS IMPULSES TO TRY TO 

02:58:50.130 --> 02:58:54.533
WORK WITH THEM AND TRY TO REACH 
FROM COMMON GROUND WHICH SOME 

02:58:54.759 --> 02:58:57.014
THINK IS NAÏVE BUT WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE FLORIN. 

02:58:57.236 --> 02:58:59.702
THAT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF 
PEOPLE THAT SAY HE SHOULD RUN 

02:58:59.928 --> 02:59:02.319
AGAINST THEM RATHER THAN TRY TO 
EXTEND OLIVE BRANCHES. 

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:05.925
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO RHONDA COLDEN WHO
WAS UP ON CAPITOL HILL. 

02:59:05.926 --> 02:59:07.926
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

02:59:14.879 --> 02:59:16.929
WE ARE HERE WITH REPRESENTATIVE 
CASTRO THE DEMOCRAT FROM TEXAS. 

02:59:17.151 --> 02:59:19.646
THIS IS A BUSY NIGHT BECAUSE 
IT'S ALSO A PRIMARY NIGHT IN 

02:59:19.886 --> 02:59:22.604
YOUR STATE. I JUST WANTED TO ASK
YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT. DO YOU 

02:59:22.837 --> 02:59:25.231
THINK THAT THE REACTION THAT THE
PRESIDENT GOT THE CHAMBER TODAY,

02:59:25.452 --> 02:59:28.736
WILL THAT HELP DEMOCRATS IN THE 
MIDTERM? 

02:59:28.737 --> 02:59:31.703
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SURE HOPE SO. HE GAVE WHAT 
I THOUGHT WAS A REALLY STRONG 

02:59:31.932 --> 02:59:34.015
SPEECH. THERE WAS A LOT OF 
BIPARTISAN CLAPPING AND STANDING

02:59:34.248 --> 02:59:36.248
OVATIONS

02:59:40.129 --> 02:59:42.291
. HE TALKED ABOUT THE 
DEVASTATION OF THE PANDEMIC BUT 

02:59:42.510 --> 02:59:44.768
ALSO ABOUT HOW HE'S BRINGING 
AMERICA BACK AND HIS PLAN FOR 

02:59:44.988 --> 02:59:47.225
THE COMING YEAR. OF COURSE, HE 
TALKED ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH 

02:59:47.453 --> 02:59:49.453
RUSSIA INVADING UKRAINE WHICH 
THE WORLD IS CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:59:53.900 --> 02:59:55.481
HE REALLY DEMONSTRATED AMERICA'S
LEADERSHIP BRINGING ALLIES 

02:59:55.482 --> 02:59:57.935
TOGETHER TO CONDEMN WHAT RUSSIA 
IS DOING. I THOUGHT IT WAS A 

02:59:58.169 --> 03:00:00.169
GREAT NIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT

03:00:05.232 --> 03:00:07.232
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ALSO SAID ON HOUSE AND 

03:00:07.448 --> 03:00:13.492
TELL. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A SERIES
OF BRIEFINGS ON UKRAINE. 

03:00:13.493 --> 03:00:17.357
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SANCTIONS. AS YOU HAVE SEEN, THE

03:00:17.583 --> 03:00:19.781
WORLD AT THIS POINT HAS 
SANCTIONED RUSSIA. IT IS 

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
UNPRECEDENTED

03:00:24.826 --> 03:00:27.238
HOW SWIFTLY AND STRONGLY THE 
WORLD HAS MOVED TO CONDEMN HIM. 

03:00:27.464 --> 03:00:29.497
MANY OF US IN CONGRESS ARE 
WORKING WITH THE STATE 

03:00:29.729 --> 03:00:31.548
DEPARTMENT AND THE U.S. 
INITIATIVE WITH THE UNITED 

03:00:31.549 --> 03:00:34.122
NATIONS TO CALL DIFFERENT 
EMBASSIES AND RALLY FOR THE VOTE

03:00:34.349 --> 03:00:36.349
TOMORROW FOR THE RESOLUTION 
CONDEMNING RUSSIA. WE WILL KEEP 

03:00:36.553 --> 03:00:39.257
THE PRESSURE ON. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

03:00:39.258 --> 03:00:43.376
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. RHONDA COLVIN ON  
CAPITOL HILL.

03:00:46.890 --> 03:00:48.890
WITH HER THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. 
MOMENTARILY

03:00:52.479 --> 03:00:54.479
THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE BY IOWA 
GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. STAY 

03:00:54.516 --> 03:00:57.594
TUNED FOR THAT. IT IS A PRIMARY 
DAY IN TEXAS TODAY. HERE ARE THE

03:00:57.813 --> 03:01:03.321
BIG QUESTIONS. THE AP IS SAYING 
GREG ABBOTT IS PROJECTED TO WIN 

03:01:03.551 --> 03:01:08.751
THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND BETO 
O'ROURKE IS PROJECTED TO WIN THE

03:01:08.977 --> 03:01:11.641
DEMOCRATIC BY MARION TEXAS. THE 
RACES WE ARE WATCHING TONIGHT 

03:01:11.861 --> 03:01:13.861
AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT LATER ON.

03:01:19.645 --> 03:01:24.044
NOW THE IOWA GOVERNOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD EVENING. I'M KIM 

03:01:24.263 --> 03:01:28.731
REYNOLDS GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT 
STATE OF IOWA. LIKE YOU, I JUST 

03:01:28.957 --> 03:01:31.520
WATCH THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS. I
LISTENED AS THE GOVERNOR OF OUR 

03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:35.306
STATE, AS A MOMENT GRANDMOTHER 
OF 11 WHO IS WORRIED OUR COUNTRY

03:01:35.575 --> 03:01:40.635
IS ON THE WRONG TRACK. WE ARE 
NOW ONE YEAR INTO HIS PRESIDENCY

03:01:40.865 --> 03:01:44.590
AND INSTEAD OF MOVING AMERICA 
FORWARD, IT FEELS LIKE PRESIDENT

03:01:44.809 --> 03:01:47.951
BIDEN AND HIS PARTY HAVE SENT US
BACK IN TIME. TO THE LATE 70s 

03:01:48.175 --> 03:01:51.342
AND EARLY 80s. WHEN RUNAWAY 
INFLATION WAS HAMMERING FAMILIES

03:01:53.630 --> 03:01:56.723
. VIOLENT CRIME WAVE WAS 
CRASHING OUR CITIES. SOVIET ARMY

03:01:56.949 --> 03:02:02.325
WAS TRYING TO REDRAW THE WORLD 
MAP. EVEN BEFORE TAKING THE OATH

03:02:02.564 --> 03:02:07.142
OF OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT TOLD US
THAT HE WANTED TO QUOTE MAKE 

03:02:07.373 --> 03:02:10.102
AMERICA RESPECTED AROUND THE 
WORLD AGAIN. AND TO UNITE US 

03:02:10.334 --> 03:02:15.187
HERE AT HOME. HE HAS FAILED ON 
BOTH FRONTS. THE DISASTROUS 

03:02:15.899 --> 03:02:20.426
AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL DID MORE 
THAN COST AMERICAN LIVES. IT 

03:02:20.664 --> 03:02:24.629
BETRAYED OUR ALLIES AND EMBOLDEN
OUR ENEMIES. NORTH KOREA IS 

03:02:24.847 --> 03:02:29.315
TESTING MISSILES AGAIN AT AN 
ALARMING RATE. THE SPEAKER OF 

03:02:29.544 --> 03:02:32.697
THE HOUSE RECENTLY WARNED OUR 
OLYMPIC ATHLETES NOT TO SPEAK 

03:02:33.073 --> 03:02:35.073
OUT AGAINST CHINA. NOW

03:02:38.717 --> 03:02:40.567
, RUSSIA HAS LAUNCHED AN 
UNPROVOKED FULL-SCALE MILITARY 

03:02:40.568 --> 03:02:45.702
INVASION OF UKRAINE. AN ATTACK 
ON DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, AND THE 

03:02:45.924 --> 03:02:51.673
RULE OF LAW. NOW ALL AMERICANS 
MUST STAND UNITED IN SOLIDARITY 

03:02:51.883 --> 03:02:55.188
WITH THE BRAVE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE
AS THEY COURAGEOUSLY DEFEND 

03:02:55.946 --> 03:03:00.845
THEIR COUNTRY AGAINST AND STEER 
ANY AS THEY FIGHT FOR THEIR 

03:03:01.055 --> 03:03:05.886
FREEDOM. WE SHOULD NOT IGNORE 
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE RUN-UP TO 

03:03:06.610 --> 03:03:09.283
PRISONS INVASION. WAIVING 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIAN PIPELINES 

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:13.475
WHILE ELIMINATING OIL PRODUCTION
HERE AT HOME. FOCUSING ON 

03:03:14.077 --> 03:03:17.561
POLITICAL CORRECT THIS RATHER 
THAN MILITARY READINESS. 

03:03:18.321 --> 03:03:22.795
REACTING TO WORLD EVENTS INSTEAD
OF DRIVING THEM. WEAKNESS ON THE

03:03:23.212 --> 03:03:25.212
WORLD STAGE HAS COST

03:03:28.202 --> 03:03:30.123
. THE PRESIDENT'S APPROACH TO 
FOREIGN POLICY HAS CONSISTENTLY 

03:03:30.124 --> 03:03:32.124
BEEN TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.

03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:38.987
IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO ONCE 
AGAIN PROJECT CONFIDENCE. IT IS 

03:03:39.197 --> 03:03:42.866
TIME TO BE DECISIVE. IT IS TIME 
TO LEAD. WE CAN'T PROJECT 

03:03:43.607 --> 03:03:48.165
STRENGTH ABROAD IF WE ARE WEAK 
AT HOME. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO 

03:03:48.372 --> 03:03:50.372
DISCUSS WITH YOU TONIGHT. THE 
PRESIDENT

03:03:54.596 --> 03:03:56.596
AND DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE 
SPENT THE LAST YEAR EITHER 

03:03:56.739 --> 03:03:59.145
IGNORING THE ISSUES FACING 
AMERICANS OR MAKING THEM WORSE. 

03:03:59.552 --> 03:04:02.228
THEY WERE WARNED THAT SPENDING 
TRILLIONS WOULD LEAD TO SOARING 

03:04:02.462 --> 03:04:07.536
INFLATION. THEY WERE TOLD THAT 
THEIR ANTI-ENERGY POLICIES WOULD

03:04:07.752 --> 03:04:10.978
SEND GAS PRICES TO NEW HEIGHTS. 
THEY PLOWED AHEAD ANYWAY. 

03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:16.355
RAISING THE PRICE AT THE PUMP BY
50% AND PUSHING INFLATION TO A 

03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:22.546
FORTY-YEAR HIGH. FOUR DECADES 
AGO WHEN OUR NATION WAS LAST 

03:04:22.753 --> 03:04:24.859
REELING FROM INFLATION I WAS A 
YOUNG WORKING MOM JUST STARTING 

03:04:25.076 --> 03:04:30.574
OUT. MY HUSBAND KEVIN WORKED 
DAYS WHILE I WATCHED THE GIRLS 

03:04:30.782 --> 03:04:32.782
AND THEN WE WOULD LITERALLY 
SWITCH.

03:04:37.117 --> 03:04:39.968
WE WOULD PASS IN THE YARD AS HE 
WAS COMING HOME AND I WAS 

03:04:40.181 --> 03:04:42.299
LEAVING TO WORK EVENINGS AT THE 
LOCAL GROCERY STORE. FROM ACROSS

03:04:42.503 --> 03:04:44.570
THE CHECKOUT COUNTER I SAW THE 
PAIN OF INFLATION ON MY 

03:04:45.052 --> 03:04:47.592
NEIGHBORS FACES. I SAW WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN PRICES RISE FASTER 

03:04:48.322 --> 03:04:50.322
THAN WAGES. THE BIDEN 
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES 

03:04:50.602 --> 03:04:52.602
INFLATION IS

03:04:54.761 --> 03:04:57.255
A HIGH-CLASS PROBLEM. I CAN TELL
YOU IT IS AND EVERYBODY PROBLEM.

03:04:57.476 --> 03:04:59.476
I SAW MOMS AND DADS PAYCHECKS

03:05:03.621 --> 03:05:05.621
GET THEM LESS AND LESS. WATCHED 
WORKING PEOPLE CHOOSE WHICH 

03:05:05.727 --> 03:05:10.639
ESSENTIALS TO TAKE HOME AND 
WHICH ONES TO LEAVE BEHIND. NOW 

03:05:10.856 --> 03:05:13.691
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S DECISIONS HAVE
A WHOLE NEW GENERATION FEELING 

03:05:13.927 --> 03:05:19.125
THAT SAME PAIN. WHEN I TOOK THE 
OATH OF OFFICE FIVE 

03:05:20.733 --> 03:05:23.068
PROMISED IOWANS THAT I WOULD 
NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF WHO I WAS 

03:05:23.768 --> 03:05:27.392
WORKING FOR. THAT I WOULD NOT 
BECOME DETACHED FROM THE 

03:05:27.599 --> 03:05:31.094
PROBLEMS THEY WERE FACING, FROM 
THE PROBLEMS I HAD FACED MYSELF.

03:05:31.304 --> 03:05:33.304
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHECK

03:05:36.928 --> 03:05:38.928
GROCERIES TO SEE WHAT HIGH 
INFLATION DOES TO PEOPLE. YOU 

03:05:39.072 --> 03:05:41.382
JUST NEED TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THE
DC BUBBLE. TALK TO AMERICANS 

03:05:41.587 --> 03:05:46.642
ABOUT WHAT IS ON THEIR MIND. 
ASKED THEM WHAT ARE YOUR 

03:05:46.852 --> 03:05:50.088
CONCERNS, WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT 
NIGHT AND THEY WILL TELL YOU. I 

03:05:50.302 --> 03:05:53.525
CAN TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT ON THAT
LIST. THEY WILL NOT TELL YOU

03:05:57.562 --> 03:05:59.508
THAT SPENDING TRILLIONS MORE AND
BANKRUPTING THEIR CHILDREN IS 

03:05:59.509 --> 03:06:01.644
THE ANSWER TO THEIR PROBLEMS. 
THEY WON'T TELL YOU THAT WE 

03:06:01.868 --> 03:06:04.974
SHOULD BE PAYING PEOPLE NOT TO 
WORK AND THEY CERTAINLY WON'T 

03:06:05.725 --> 03:06:10.751
TELL YOU THAT WE SHOULD GIVE 
BILLIONS IN TAX GIVEAWAYS TO 

03:06:10.963 --> 03:06:14.269
MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES IN
DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED STATES LIKE 

03:06:14.477 --> 03:06:19.435
CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK AND NEW 
JERSEY. THAT IS 

03:06:20.338 --> 03:06:25.488
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PUSHING 
FOR OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THAT 

03:06:26.248 --> 03:06:28.248
IS ALL

03:06:32.294 --> 03:06:33.992
PART OF BUILD BACK BETTER. 
THANKFULLY THE PRESIDENT'S 

03:06:33.993 --> 03:06:36.283
AGENDA DID NOT PASS BECAUSE EVEN
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY SAID 

03:06:36.489 --> 03:06:39.121
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE SHARE THAT VIEW. ENOUGH 

03:06:40.084 --> 03:06:42.913
IS ENOUGH. IT IS NOT JUST WITH

03:06:46.374 --> 03:06:49.000
DC SPENDING. AMERICANS ARE TIRED
OF THE POLITICAL CLASS TRYING TO

03:06:49.450 --> 03:06:53.962
REMAKE THIS COUNTRY INTO A PLACE
WHERE AN ELITE FEW TELL EVERYONE

03:06:54.178 --> 03:06:59.362
ELSE WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT 
SAY. WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT 

03:06:59.567 --> 03:07:01.567
BELIEVE. THEY ARE TIRED OF 
PEOPLE PRETENDING

03:07:06.125 --> 03:07:08.741
THE WAY TO END RACISM IS BY 
CATEGORIZING EVERYBODY BY THE 

03:07:08.947 --> 03:07:11.526
RACE. THEY ARE TIRED OF 
POLITICIANS WHO TELL PARENTS 

03:07:11.737 --> 03:07:16.355
THEY SHOULD SIT DOWN, THE 
SILENT, AND LET GOVERNMENT 

03:07:16.568 --> 03:07:20.331
CONTROL THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION 
AND FUTURE. FRANKLY THEY ARE 

03:07:20.537 --> 03:07:22.537
TIRED OF THE THEATER

03:07:25.262 --> 03:07:27.518
WHERE POLITICIANS DO ONE THING 
WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE ROLLING AND

03:07:27.729 --> 03:07:32.239
ANOTHER WHEN THEY BELIEVE YOU 
CANNOT SEE THEM. WORK GOVERNORS 

03:07:32.454 --> 03:07:35.578
AND MAYORS AND FORCE MANDATES 
BUT DO NOT FOLLOW THEM. WERE 

03:07:35.790 --> 03:07:38.442
ELECTED LEADERS TELL THEIR 
CITIZENS TO STAY HOME WHILE THEY

03:07:38.649 --> 03:07:44.448
SNEAK OFF TO FLORIDA FOR SUN AND
FUN. WHERE THEY DEMAND THAT YOUR

03:07:44.667 --> 03:07:49.162
CHILD WEAR A MASK BUT THEY GO 
MASK LESS. YOU HAVE HEARD 

03:07:50.117 --> 03:07:54.099
EXCUSES. THEY WERE JUST HOLDING 
THEIR BREATH BUT IT'S THE 

03:07:54.308 --> 03:07:58.466
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING 
TO EXHALE. WAITING FOR THE 

03:07:58.893 --> 03:08:04.048
INSANITY TO STOP. WE NOW LIVE IN
A COUNTRY WHERE VIOLENT CRIME IS

03:08:04.258 --> 03:08:08.943
OUT OF CONTROL. LETTER ROLE 
PROSECUTORS ARE LEADING 

03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:12.322
PROSECUTORS, ARE LETTING PEOPLE 
OFF EASY AND MANY DEMOCRATS 

03:08:12.533 --> 03:08:14.533
STILL WANT TO

03:08:20.209 --> 03:08:22.209
DEFUND THE POLICE. IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYTHING IS BACKWARDS. THE 

03:08:22.326 --> 03:08:24.006
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION REQUIRES 
VACCINES FOR AMERICANS WHO WANT 

03:08:24.007 --> 03:08:26.869
TO GO TO WORK  OR PROTECT THIS 
COUNTRY BUT NOT FOR MIGRANTS WHO

03:08:27.077 --> 03:08:29.329
ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER. THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TREATS 

03:08:30.085 --> 03:08:34.337
PARENTS LIKE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS
BUT LEADERS AND SHOT BLISTERS 

03:08:35.058 --> 03:08:39.507
ROAM FREE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
ARE LEFT TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE 

03:08:40.233 --> 03:08:45.884
THE ENEMY. THIS IS NOT THE SAME 
COUNTRY IT WAS A YEAR AGO. THE 

03:08:46.095 --> 03:08:48.095
PRESIDENT TRIED TO PAINT A 
DIFFERENT PICTURE TONIGHT THAT 

03:08:48.140 --> 03:08:51.452
HIS ACTIONS OVER THE LAST 12 
MONTHS DO NOT MATCH THE 

03:08:51.663 --> 03:08:56.797
RHETORIC. IT IS NOT WHAT HE 
PROMISED WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE. IT

03:08:57.002 --> 03:09:01.533
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. 
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE. ACROSS 

03:09:01.751 --> 03:09:04.347
THE NATION REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS 
AND LEGISLATORS ARE SHOWING 

03:09:04.591 --> 03:09:09.337
AMERICANS WHAT CONSERVATIVE 
LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE, 

03:09:10.161 --> 03:09:14.036
MEANS TO RESPECT THE PEOPLE WE 
SERVE, TO HEAR THEM OUT AND 

03:09:14.242 --> 03:09:19.616
STAND UP FOR THEM AND WALK 
ALONGSIDE THEM. WE KNOW THAT OUR

03:09:19.832 --> 03:09:24.381
PROBLEMS REQUIRE BOLD ACTION, 
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT BOLD 

03:09:24.804 --> 03:09:28.131
ACTION DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN 
GOVERNMENT ACTION. IT IS 

03:09:28.338 --> 03:09:31.216
AMERICANS MAKING THEIR OWN 
DECISIONS FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES

03:09:31.977 --> 03:09:34.900
AND FUTURE. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS
FACE

03:09:39.065 --> 03:09:42.759
THE SAME COVID-19 VIRUS HEAD ON 
BUT WE HONORED YOUR FREEDOMS AND

03:09:42.973 --> 03:09:45.864
SON RIGHT AWAY THAT LOCKDOWNS 
AND SCHOOL CLOSURES CAME WITH 

03:09:46.081 --> 03:09:50.803
THEIR OWN SIGNIFICANT COST. THAT
MANDATES WERE NOT THE ANSWER. WE

03:09:51.206 --> 03:09:56.748
ACTUALLY LISTENED TO THE SCIENCE
ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS IN SCHOOLS.

03:09:57.507 --> 03:10:02.341
WHAT HAPPENED AND IS STILL 
HAPPENING TO OUR CHILDREN OVER 

03:10:02.561 --> 03:10:06.242
THE LAST TWO YEARS IS 
UNCONSCIONABLE. LEARNING LOSS, 

03:10:07.052 --> 03:10:13.313
ISOLATION, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION. 
SO MANY STATES OUR KIDS HAVE 

03:10:13.523 --> 03:10:19.635
BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND SO MANY 
WILL NEVER CATCH UP. THAT IS WHY

03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:22.142
IOWA WAS THE FIRST STATE IN THE 
NATION TO REQUIRE THAT SCHOOLS 

03:10:22.347 --> 03:10:27.649
OPEN THEIR DOORS. I WAS ATTACKED
BY THE LEFT, I WAS ATTACKED BY 

03:10:28.203 --> 03:10:32.631
THE MEDIA, BUT IT WAS NOT A HARD
CHOICE. IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE.

03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:37.566
KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN IS ONLY THE
START OF THE PRO PARENT, 

03:10:37.984 --> 03:10:41.103
PROFAMILY REVOLUTION THAT 
REPUBLICANS ARE LEADING IN IOWA 

03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:45.769
AND STATES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT PARENTS

03:10:45.976 --> 03:10:50.535
MATTER. IT WAS TRUE BEFORE THE 
PANDEMIC AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN 

03:10:50.748 --> 03:10:56.523
MORE IMPORTANT TO SAY OUT LOUD. 
PARENTS MATTER. THEY HAVE A 

03:10:56.728 --> 03:11:01.028
RIGHT TO KNOW AND TO HAVE A SAY 
IN WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE BEING 

03:11:01.759 --> 03:11:06.200
TAUGHT. FAMILIES ALSO HAVE EVERY
RIGHT TO LIVE IN A SAFE AND 

03:11:06.808 --> 03:11:13.202
SECURE COMMUNITY. THAT BEGINS 
WITH A SAFE AND SECURE COUNTRY. 

03:11:13.622 --> 03:11:17.514
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS 
REFUSED TO SECURE OUR BORDER. 

03:11:18.019 --> 03:11:20.944
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE
RESOURCES TO STOP HUMAN 

03:11:21.159 --> 03:11:23.159
TRAFFICKING

03:11:25.592 --> 03:11:28.374
, TO STOP THE STAGGERING INFLUX 
OF DEADLY DRUGS COMING INTO OUR 

03:11:28.591 --> 03:11:33.417
NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY HAVE REFUSED
TO PROTECT YOU. WITH TEXAS AND 

03:11:33.622 --> 03:11:38.971
ARIZONA LEADING THE WAY I ALONG 
WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS FROM 

03:11:39.197 --> 03:11:41.238
SEVERAL STATES HAVE SENT 
RESOURCES TO THE BORDER. WE HAVE

03:11:41.462 --> 03:11:45.382
ACTUALLY GONE TO THE BORDER, 
SOMETHING THAT OUR PRESIDENT AND

03:11:45.591 --> 03:11:49.578
VICE PRESIDENT HAVE YET TO DO 
SINCE TAKING OFFICE. ON THE 

03:11:49.815 --> 03:11:54.412
ECONOMY, THE CONTRAST COULD NOT 
BE MORE STARK. WHILE 

03:11:55.344 --> 03:11:58.048
IN DC ARE SPENDING TRILLIONS 
SENDING INFLATION SOARING, 

03:11:58.278 --> 03:12:02.609
REPUBLICAN LEADERS AROUND THE 
COUNTRY ARE BALANCING BUDGETS 

03:12:02.818 --> 03:12:05.877
AND CUTTING TAXES BECAUSE WE 
KNOW THAT MONEY SPENT ON MAIN 

03:12:06.089 --> 03:12:12.639
STREET IS UTTER THAN MONEY SPENT
ON BUREAUCRACY. TODAY I SIGNED 

03:12:12.853 --> 03:12:17.690
LEGISLATION THAT ELIMINATES 
IOWA'S TAX ON RETIREMENT INCOME 

03:12:18.097 --> 03:12:20.138
AND SETS OUR TAX RATE AT 3.9%

03:12:23.317 --> 03:12:27.388
. THAT IS LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT
IT WAS JUST FOUR YEARS AGO.

03:12:32.383 --> 03:12:35.181
IT SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE
THAT OUT OF THE TOP 20 STATES 

03:12:35.393 --> 03:12:37.242
WITH THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATE 17 HAVE REPUBLICAN 

03:12:37.243 --> 03:12:42.312
GOVERNORS. REPUBLICANS MAY NOT 
HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE BUT WE ARE 

03:12:42.524 --> 03:12:44.885
DOING WHAT WE CAN TO FILL THE 
LEADERSHIP VACUUM. ON THE ISSUES

03:12:45.388 --> 03:12:50.979
THAT ARE AFFECTING AMERICANS, 
REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING. WE ARE 

03:12:51.226 --> 03:12:54.417
STANDING UP FOR PARENTS AND 
KIDS. WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 

03:12:54.622 --> 03:12:58.739
LIFE. WE ARE KEEPING OUR 
COMMUNITIES SAFE

03:13:01.290 --> 03:13:04.794
THOSE IN UNIFORM. WE ARE 
FIGHTING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S 

03:13:05.003 --> 03:13:08.494
ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND THAT 
INCLUDES BIOFUELS. WE ARE 

03:13:08.701 --> 03:13:13.009
GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK NOT 
PAYING THEM TO STAY HOME.

03:13:15.345 --> 03:13:21.263
OF ALL WE ARE RESPECTING YOUR 
FREEDOM. BEHIND ME STANDS IOWA'S

03:13:21.471 --> 03:13:27.431
CAPITAL. OUR LIBERTIES WE PRIZE 
AND OUR RIGHTS WE WILL MAINTAIN.

03:13:27.638 --> 03:13:33.797
THOSE ARE NOT JUST EMPTY WORDS. 
IT IS A BELIEVE THAT THE 

03:13:34.009 --> 03:13:36.961
GREATNESS OF THIS STATE AND 
COUNTRY LIES IN OUR PEOPLE, NOT 

03:13:37.166 --> 03:13:41.400
GOVERNMENT. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE 
TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND 

03:13:42.086 --> 03:13:46.714
WORRY ABOUT THE NEXT THING THE 
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO DO TO 

03:13:46.924 --> 03:13:48.924
YOU, YOUR BUSINESS, OR YOUR 
CHILDREN.

03:13:52.224 --> 03:13:54.325
IF WE AS ELECTED LEADERS ARE 
DOING OUR JOB, THEN THE 

03:13:54.530 --> 03:13:58.043
GOVERNMENT IS WORKING WELL BUT 
OPERATING IN THE BACKGROUND. IT 

03:13:58.793 --> 03:14:04.425
IS SUPPORTING THE INGENUITY AND 
SPIRIT OF OUR PEOPLE, NOT 

03:14:04.635 --> 03:14:07.854
DROWNING THEM OUT. IT IS KEEPING
THEM SAFE, NOT RESTRICTING THEIR

03:14:08.061 --> 03:14:13.478
FREEDOM. THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE,
THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS BELIEVE,

03:14:14.155 --> 03:14:18.910
AND THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE 
DOING. I AM SO BLESSED TO BE THE

03:14:19.132 --> 03:14:22.648
GOVERNOR OF IOWA, WHERE PEOPLE 
ARE HUMBLE, HARD-WORKING,

03:14:25.504 --> 03:14:28.546
PATRIOTIC. WE TAKE CARE OF EACH 
OTHER AND YES WE ARE, AS THEY 

03:14:28.753 --> 03:14:34.586
SAY, IOWA NICE. YOU DO NOT HAVE 
TO BE FROM IOWA 

03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:38.850
THOSE ARE THE VALUES OF AMERICA 
AT ITS BEST. ALL OF AMERICA. 

03:14:39.128 --> 03:14:44.630
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, I PUT 
MY FAITH IN IOWANS AND THEY HAVE

03:14:44.836 --> 03:14:48.534
NOT LET ME DOWN. I ENCOURAGE 
THIS PRESIDENT TO DO

03:14:51.918 --> 03:14:54.755
TO PUT HIS FAITH IN YOU THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER 

03:14:55.093 --> 03:15:00.427
WAVERED IN YOUR BELIEF IN THIS 
COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF WHO LEADS

03:15:00.636 --> 03:15:07.185
IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE 
SHOWN THAT THE SOUL OF AMERICA 

03:15:07.603 --> 03:15:10.396
IS NOT ABOUT WHO LIVES IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE. IT IS MEN AND WOMEN

03:15:11.057 --> 03:15:16.598
LIKE YOU IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS
NATION WHO ARE WILLING TO STEP 

03:15:16.810 --> 03:15:20.816
UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
YOUR COMMUNITIES, OR YOUR 

03:15:21.031 --> 03:15:25.655
NEIGHBORS, AND ULTIMATELY FOR 
YOURSELVES. BY THAT MOST 

03:15:26.417 --> 03:15:33.123
IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE STATE OF 
OUR UNION IS INDEED STRONG. 

03:15:33.712 --> 03:15:39.051
THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF 

03:15:39.270 --> 03:15:41.270
AMERICA.

03:15:44.259 --> 03:15:46.259
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IOWA GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS 
WITH THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE TO 

03:15:46.462 --> 03:15:48.604
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE 
UNION ADDRESS. LET'S GO TO 

03:15:48.851 --> 03:15:50.851
RHONDA COLVIN ON CAPITOL HILL. 

03:15:57.454 --> 03:15:59.915
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M HERE WITH SENATOR CHRIS 
FROM DELAWARE. I KNOW THAT YOU 

03:16:00.144 --> 03:16:04.509
KNOW THE PRESIDENT WELL.  WHAT 
MOMENT STOOD OUT TO YOU? IF 

03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:06.846
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT TONIGHT 
WHERE YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE 

03:16:07.059 --> 03:16:11.828
STRUCK THAT BALANCE AND MAKING 
SURE THAT THE AMERICANS ARE 

03:16:12.057 --> 03:16:13.989
WATCHING THIS TONIGHT UNDERSTAND
HIS KEY ISSUES AND UNDERSTAND 

03:16:13.990 --> 03:16:18.336
WHAT IS NEXT IN UKRAINE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS HARD TO PICK JUST ONE 

03:16:18.548 --> 03:16:20.871
MOMENT FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A
REALLY STRONG SPEECH. IN THE 

03:16:21.083 --> 03:16:22.986
OPENING COUPLE OF MINUTES HE 
SPOKE FORCEFULLY AND CLEARLY 

03:16:22.987 --> 03:16:25.782
ABOUT WHAT IS AT RISK, NOT JUST 
FOR UKRAINIANS, NOT JUST FOR THE

03:16:25.998 --> 03:16:29.092
WEST, BUT UNITED STATES AS WELL 
AND DEPENDING THE INDEPENDENCE 

03:16:29.677 --> 03:16:31.677
OF UKRAINE.

03:16:36.366 --> 03:16:38.366
I THINK THAT BY HAVING THE 
UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR AS HIS 

03:16:38.528 --> 03:16:40.578
GUEST AND SPEAKING CLEARLY ABOUT
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIGHT 

03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:42.725
THEY ARE PUTTING UP AND 
CONDEMNINGAGGRESSION  HE STARTED

03:16:42.726 --> 03:16:44.886
OFF WITH A STRONG FOOTING AND 
HELP THE AVERAGE AMERICAN TO 

03:16:45.184 --> 03:16:48.815
MAYBE UNDERSTAND WHY NATO'S 
FUTURE IS VITAL TO THE UNITED 

03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:51.499
STATES. IN SOME WAYS WHAT I LIKE
MOST WAS HIS CLOSING.'S UNITY 

03:16:51.713 --> 03:16:54.701
AGENDA WHERE HE LAID OUT FOUR 
THINGS THAT ARE GENUINELY 

03:16:55.115 --> 03:16:58.202
BIPARTISAN AND IMPACT EVERY 
AMERICAN. CANCER, MENTAL HEALTH,

03:17:01.562 --> 03:17:03.773
OPIOID AN ADDICTION AND 
SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS. I THINK

03:17:04.866 --> 03:17:07.480
EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY IN SOME I 
WAS TOUCHED BY THE WAY

03:17:10.447 --> 03:17:12.990
ABOUT THOSE ISSUES AND HAS 
CALLED ALL OF US TO ADDRESS THEM

03:17:13.201 --> 03:17:15.551
IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WERE JUST IN THE REGION

03:17:19.892 --> 03:17:22.158
LOOKING AT THE SITUATION IN 
UKRAINE. YOU ALSO SIT ON THE 

03:17:22.374 --> 03:17:27.397
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IN THE 
SENATE. YOU ARE PREPARING A $10 

03:17:27.608 --> 03:17:29.538
BILLION SUPPLEMENTAL AID PACKAGE
FOR THE UKRAINIAN ISSUE. HOW 

03:17:29.539 --> 03:17:31.912
FAST IS THAT MOVING THROUGH? 
WILL IT MOVE FAST AND CAN YOU 

03:17:32.248 --> 03:17:34.749
GIVE US AN UPDATE TO MARK 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE $10 BILLION QUESTION IS 

03:17:34.965 --> 03:17:36.965
WHETHER

03:17:39.596 --> 03:17:41.713
WE WILL GET AN OMNIBUS WHICH IS 
A YEAR-LONG APPROPRIATION BILL. 

03:17:41.923 --> 03:17:44.880
I AM URGING AND THERE ARE DOZENS
OF US WORKING ON THIS IN THE 

03:17:45.090 --> 03:17:48.079
SENATE AND THE HOUSE. I'M URGING
THAT THE UKRAINE SUPPLEMENTAL BE

03:17:48.287 --> 03:17:51.101
ADDED TO THAT. I THINK WE OUGHT 
TO BE PROACTIVELY FUNDING 

03:17:51.353 --> 03:17:53.353
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR WHAT 
WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY END UP 

03:17:53.400 --> 03:17:57.910
BEING MILLIONS OF REFUGEES THAT 
WILL BE HOSTED BY POLAND AND 

03:17:58.119 --> 03:18:00.119
ROMANIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
ALREADY STRAINED

03:18:04.821 --> 03:18:06.821
BY THE COVID PANDEMIC AND 
ALREADY AT RISK FOR FURTHER 

03:18:06.931 --> 03:18:08.931
AGGRESSION BY RUSSIA. I AM 
TRYING TO BALANCE THAT 

03:18:09.001 --> 03:18:11.001
HUMANITARIAN INVESTMENT WITH 
FURTHER DEFENSE INVESTMENT. 

03:18:11.245 --> 03:18:15.911
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS ALREADY SENT
LITERALLY $1 BILLION IN MILITARY

03:18:16.123 --> 03:18:18.123
AID TO UKRAINIAN DEFENDERS

03:18:21.330 --> 03:18:23.459
. HE HAS GIVEN THEM STINGER 
MISSILES TO SHOOT DOWN RUSSIAN 

03:18:23.674 --> 03:18:25.734
JETS AND JAVELIN MISSILES TO 
SHOOT AT RUSSIAN TANKS AND 

03:18:25.957 --> 03:18:29.130
AMMUNITION AND FUEL AND OTHER 
SUPPORT BUT FRANKLY AS THIS WAR 

03:18:29.347 --> 03:18:33.279
CONTINUES AND GRINDS ALONG AND 
GETS MORE UGLY, I THINK MORE AND

03:18:33.490 --> 03:18:36.586
MORE OF US WILL WANT TO PROVIDE 
BOTH THE HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT 

03:18:36.992 --> 03:18:41.543
THAT THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE 
URGENTLY NEED AND THE SUPPORT TO

03:18:41.780 --> 03:18:45.442
STAY IN THE DEFENSE AGAINST 
BRITAIN'S AGGRESSION. 

03:18:45.443 --> 03:18:47.465
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEYOND MONEY OR FUNDING 
MEASURES SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN 

03:18:47.681 --> 03:18:50.456
THE REGION SO RECENTLY WHAT 
WOULD YOU TELL AMERICANS SHOULD 

03:18:50.665 --> 03:18:54.563
BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS NEXT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 

03:18:54.783 --> 03:18:57.574
THAT HAVE HAPPENED THE LAST WEEK
IS THAT AFTER A YEAR OF 

03:18:57.779 --> 03:19:00.958
INVESTMENT BY PRESIDENT BIDEN 
AND HIS TEAM AND REBUILDING 

03:19:01.170 --> 03:19:05.199
ALLIANCES WE HAVE SEEN SANCTIONS
IMPOSED ON RUSSIA THAT ARE 

03:19:05.445 --> 03:19:07.445
UNPRECEDENTED.

03:19:12.667 --> 03:19:14.762
EVEN IN THE SECOND WORLD WARS 
WITH DRILLING AND SWEDEN STAY 

03:19:14.969 --> 03:19:19.534
NEUTRAL. HERE THEY PICKED A SIDE
. SPORTS LEAGUES AND TEAMS 

03:19:19.967 --> 03:19:24.258
THROWING RUSSIANS OUT OF THEIR 
COMPETITIONS. 

03:19:24.899 --> 03:19:27.034
SANCTIONS HAVE COME DOWN VERY 
HARD AND WE ARE TARGETING THE 

03:19:27.242 --> 03:19:29.651
BILLIONAIRES WHO HAVE SIPHONED 
OFF THE WEALTH OF RUSSIA AND ARE

03:19:29.971 --> 03:19:31.971
HIDING IT

03:19:34.540 --> 03:19:36.829
IN PLACES LIKE MONACO AND 
LONDON. THE UNITY OF THE WESTERN

03:19:37.041 --> 03:19:38.724
ALLIANCE AGAINST PUTIN'S 
STRIKING. IT'S THE DIRECT RESULT

03:19:38.725 --> 03:19:41.392
OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S HARD WORK 
AND LEADERSHIP OVER THIS ISSUE. 

03:19:41.605 --> 03:19:44.041
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I NOTICED THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DID NOT MENTION BUILD BACK 

03:19:44.253 --> 03:19:46.253
BETTER. HE HAD SET PIECES

03:19:50.383 --> 03:19:52.765
AND DISCUSSED THAT THOSE THINGS 
NEED TO BE PASSED. WHAT ARE THE 

03:19:52.981 --> 03:19:55.470
ODDS THAT THE SENATE WILL TAKE 
UP THOSE ISSUES? EVEN JUST THE 

03:19:55.690 --> 03:19:56.878
ONE ON PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG 
PRICES. 

03:19:56.879 --> 03:20:04.369
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I NOTICED THAT SENATOR 
MANCHIN  STOOD UP AND 

03:20:05.329 --> 03:20:10.015
CLAPPING ENTHUSIASTICALLY. HE 
ALSO HIGHLIGHTED JOSH, A YOUNG 

03:20:10.228 --> 03:20:12.633
MAN FROM OHIO WHO IS DIABETIC

03:20:16.228 --> 03:20:18.436
AND STRUGGLING TO AFFORD THE 
MEDICATIONS HE SO DESPERATELY 

03:20:18.646 --> 03:20:20.950
NEEDS. THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN ALSO 

03:20:21.155 --> 03:20:23.155
BROUGHT TO HIS SPEECH.

03:20:26.956 --> 03:20:29.454
HE SAYING I KNOW HOW HARD THIS 
PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AND EVEN 

03:20:29.682 --> 03:20:34.433
THOUGH WE HAVE RECORD GROWTH WE 
ALSO 

03:20:37.743 --> 03:20:42.129
GOING TO TACKLE THINGS LIKE 
HEALTHCARE COSTS, DAYCARE AND 

03:20:42.361 --> 03:20:46.706
CHILDCARE COSTS AND PRESCRIPTION
AND MEDICATION COST IS. I WAS 

03:20:46.917 --> 03:20:48.920
ENCOURAGED TO SEE HIM CHEERING 
THAT PARTICULAR ONE.

03:20:53.076 --> 03:20:55.076
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW LET'S BRING IN

03:21:00.841 --> 03:21:02.330
HANNAH JEWELL. SHE'S BEEN 
TRACKING THE REPUBLICAN 

03:21:02.331 --> 03:21:04.229
RESPONSES TONIGHT FROM THE 
OUTBURSTS IN THE CHAMBER TO 

03:21:04.230 --> 03:21:06.230
CHEERS TO THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE

03:21:11.633 --> 03:21:13.633
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD SAY THAT SHE SET UP 

03:21:13.694 --> 03:21:17.860
THIS BIG HEARTLAND VERSUS 
COASTAL ELITE DEMOCRATIC 

03:21:18.278 --> 03:21:22.573
NARRATIVE WHICH IS PERHAPS NOT A
SURPRISE. SHE DID NAME CHECK 

03:21:22.979 --> 03:21:27.379
CALIFORNIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW 
YORK TO SET THIS UP QUITE 

03:21:27.597 --> 03:21:29.597
EXPLICITLY NAMING THE STATES OF 
HER CRITIQUE. HE HEARD AS 

03:21:29.722 --> 03:21:31.722
EXPECTED SHE SAID THAT SHE 
ACCUSED

03:21:35.900 --> 03:21:38.559
BIDENS DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN US 
BACK IN TIME TO THE LATE 70s AND

03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:42.497
EARLY 80s CAREFULLY CRITIQUING 
THE CARTER YEARS WITHOUT 

03:21:43.265 --> 03:21:47.664
ENCROACHING ON FOR THE REAGAN 
TERRITORY. THE TIME AS SHE HAD 

03:21:47.868 --> 03:21:50.111
IT IS INFLATION THAT SHE 
RECALLED

03:21:55.324 --> 03:21:57.982
WORKING IN A CHECKOUT COUNTER AT
A GROCERY STORE AND THE PAIN OF 

03:21:58.194 --> 03:22:00.093
PEOPLE ENCOUNTERING INFLATION 
AND SAYING THAT SHE RELATES THAT

03:22:00.094 --> 03:22:02.094
TO THIS TIME. SHE MADE, SPEAKING
ABOUT AFGHANISTAN

03:22:05.801 --> 03:22:07.841
AND UKRAINE, SHE MADE A STRANGE 
CLAIM THAT DEMOCRATS WERE 

03:22:08.446 --> 03:22:11.241
FOCUSING ON POLITICAL 
CORRECTNESS RATHER THAN MILITARY

03:22:11.460 --> 03:22:16.019
READINESS. YOU SEE HER HITTING 
THESE POPULAR CULTURE WAR LINES 

03:22:16.227 --> 03:22:20.728
THAT ARE USEFUL IN AN ELECTION. 
SHE IS ACTUALLY FACING AN 

03:22:20.954 --> 03:22:23.971
ELECTION QUITE SOON. SHE SAID 
THAT THE U.S. CANNOT PROJECT 

03:22:24.191 --> 03:22:26.202
STRENGTH ABROAD IF THEY ARE WEEK
AT HOME.

03:22:29.769 --> 03:22:31.513
SHE CRITIQUED THE WITHDRAWAL 
FROM AFGHANISTAN SAYING IT 

03:22:31.514 --> 03:22:33.731
EMBOLDENED OUR ENEMIES BUT ALSO 
SAID AMERICANS SHOULD STAND IN 

03:22:33.944 --> 03:22:36.368
SOLIDARITY WITH THE BRAVE PEOPLE
OF UKRAINE. SHE ALSO HIT

03:22:41.183 --> 03:22:42.890
THOSE LINES ABOUT COVID 
CONTRASTING THE RESPONSE OF 

03:22:42.891 --> 03:22:44.828
REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS LIKE 
HERSELF TO COVID WITH VERY FEW 

03:22:44.829 --> 03:22:49.538
RESTRICTIONS TO THOSE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNORS AND AT THE NATIONAL 

03:22:49.748 --> 03:22:52.581
LEVEL. SHE SAID THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO EXHALE 

03:22:52.986 --> 03:22:54.986
SPEAKING ABOUT MASKS BUT OF 
COURSE WE SAW TONIGHT ALMOST 

03:22:55.193 --> 03:22:57.334
EVERYBODY IN CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS
INCLUDED WERE NOT MASKED 

03:22:57.559 --> 03:23:01.741
TONIGHT. THEY WERE INDEED 
EXHALING WITHOUT MASKS. SHE 

03:23:02.081 --> 03:23:06.260
REALLY FOCUSED ON CHILDREN AND 
ON PARENTS SAYING WHAT HAS 

03:23:06.473 --> 03:23:09.085
HAPPENED TO OUR CHILDREN OVER 
THE LAST FEW YEARS IS 

03:23:09.295 --> 03:23:14.581
UNCONSCIONABLE. SHE SAID THAT 
PARENTS MATTER. 

03:23:15.020 --> 03:23:17.906
BELIEVE THAT PARENTS MATTER 
PRESUMABLY A PLAY ON THE PHRASE 

03:23:18.121 --> 03:23:23.650
LACK LIVES MATTER. TALKING ABOUT
THE RIGHT OF PARENTS TO MAKE 

03:23:23.856 --> 03:23:26.666
DECISIONS ABOUT COVID AND THAT 
HAS BEEN SUCH A POPULAR LINE.

03:23:34.744 --> 03:23:37.735
SO IT IS THE TALE AS OLD OF TIME
AND IS AMERICAN POLITICS BUT 

03:23:37.945 --> 03:23:39.439
CERTAINLY ONE THAT IS STILL 
GOING STRONG. 

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.819
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO JAMES HOHMANN FOR
MORE ON HOW POTENT THIS 

03:23:42.032 --> 03:23:44.378
MESSAGING IS. WE HEARD PRESIDENT
BIDEN  TALK ABOUT IN HIS SPEECH 

03:23:44.590 --> 03:23:49.648
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS HAS BEEN
A TIME OF DEEP CHALLENGES 

03:23:50.589 --> 03:23:56.350
TALKING ABOUT -- TALKING ABOUT

03:23:59.872 --> 03:24:03.395
HOW AMERICA CAN MOVE FORWARD 
WITH THE PANDEMIC. JAMES, IS IT 

03:24:04.143 --> 03:24:08.548
THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICANS
OR IS THE OPPORTUNITY PASSING 

03:24:09.251 --> 03:24:11.847
THEM BY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT MESSAGE FROM 

03:24:12.061 --> 03:24:16.706
GOVERNOR REYNOLDS WAS AIMED AT 
SUBURBAN WOMEN WHO TRADITIONALLY

03:24:17.468 --> 03:24:23.256
VOTED REPUBLICAN, BUT BACKED JOE
BIDEN IN 2020 BECAUSE THEY WERE 

03:24:23.469 --> 03:24:27.153
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP.
IT IS NOT LIKE SHE WOULD HAVE 

03:24:27.368 --> 03:24:30.076
SAID HIS NAME, BUT IT WAS A VERY

03:24:39.943 --> 03:24:42.463
UN-TRUMPY SPEECH. SHE IS NOT 
SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO BE  

03:24:42.671 --> 03:24:44.905
RUNNING FOR THE REPUBLICAN 
NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT IN 

03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:47.120
2024. SHE IS NOT

03:24:50.529 --> 03:24:52.529
THREATENING OTHER RISING FIGURES
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I HAVE 

03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:54.836
KNOWN HER SINCE SHE WAS A STATE 
SENATOR BEFORE SHE BECAME 

03:24:55.063 --> 03:25:00.229
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IN 2011. SHE
DELIVERED THE KIND OF MESSAGE, 

03:25:00.645 --> 03:25:05.225
OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE SOME 
CULTURE WAR BOX CHECKING KIND OF

03:25:05.451 --> 03:25:08.286
ELEMENTS THAT HANNAH TALKED 
ABOUT THAT OVERALL IT WAS JUST 

03:25:08.504 --> 03:25:13.461
ABOUT TRYING TO REACH THESE 
DISAFFECTED VOTERS THAT WANT TO 

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:17.351
COME HOME TO THE GOP IN THE 
MIDTERMS. 

03:25:17.352 --> 03:25:22.538
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IN 
DAVE. THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH

03:25:22.746 --> 03:25:28.915
US HERE AFTER THE SPEECHES. YOU 
HAVE BEEN COVERING THE RACES 

03:25:29.138 --> 03:25:31.138
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE 
MIDTERMS,

03:25:34.231 --> 03:25:36.427
LONG BEFORE THEY HAPPEN ON 
ANYBODY ELSE'S RADAR. I WANT TO 

03:25:36.635 --> 03:25:39.308
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE RECENT 
TEXAS. IS HIS PRIMARY DAY IN 

03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:43.560
TEXAS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE SHAPING UP 

03:25:43.774 --> 03:25:46.369
AND WHAT WE CAN READ INTO THOSE 
RESULTS. 

03:25:46.370 --> 03:25:50.685
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS IT RELATES TO THE SPEECH 
BY THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT, YOU 

03:25:50.896 --> 03:25:54.112
HAVE HIGHER REPUBLICAN 
ENTHUSIASM BUT YOU HAD

03:26:00.937 --> 03:26:02.883
MORE TURNOUT IN REPUBLICAN 
AREAS. THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN 

03:26:02.884 --> 03:26:05.889
TURNOUT SURGEON SOUTH TEXAS 
WHERE THE VOTERS MAJORITY HAVE 

03:26:06.101 --> 03:26:07.828
BEEN VERY UNHAPPY WITH 
IMMIGRATION POLICY. YOU'VE HAD 

03:26:07.829 --> 03:26:11.003
MASSIVE COMPLICATIONS IN BIG 
URBAN COUNTIES BECAUSE OF THE 

03:26:11.220 --> 03:26:15.823
VOTING LAW THAT WAS PASSED LAST 
YEAR. THE PRESIDENT MADE A 

03:26:16.033 --> 03:26:18.418
MENTION OF PASSING VOTING REFORM
BUT IT WAS ONE OF SEVERAL THINGS

03:26:18.628 --> 03:26:20.892
IN THE SPEECH THAT YOU CAN 
IMAGINE AND INTEREST GROUP,

03:26:26.277 --> 03:26:28.909
BUT ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN 
ACTIVE PLAN TO GET IT THROUGH 

03:26:29.130 --> 03:26:31.662
THE SENATE. WHAT HAPPENED IN 
TEXAS SO FAR AS THAT IT IS 

03:26:31.874 --> 03:26:34.052
PRETTY CLEAR THAT PROGRESSIVES 
WON A SEAT THAT WAS DESIGNED TO 

03:26:34.265 --> 03:26:36.265
ELECT A DEMOCRAT IN AUSTIN.

03:26:41.064 --> 03:26:43.330
THE CHAMPION OF THE AUSTIN 
EFFORT TO CUT THE FUNDING IS 

03:26:43.542 --> 03:26:48.765
PROBABLY GOING TO WIN THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION AND WILL 

03:26:48.982 --> 03:26:52.053
PROBABLY HEAD OFF TO CONGRESS. 
AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT 

03:26:52.270 --> 03:26:54.270
WAS VERY POINTEDLY SAYING HE'S 
NOT FOR

03:26:58.009 --> 03:27:00.400
DEFUNDING THE POLICE AND SAYING 
WE NEED TO FUND THE POLICE. GOT 

03:27:00.620 --> 03:27:05.301
A LOT OF CHEERS  IN THE ROOMS 
BUT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF 

03:27:05.517 --> 03:27:07.517
PROTEST FROM COREY BUSCH OF 
MISSOURI WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW 

03:27:07.723 --> 03:27:09.899
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT FULFILLED 
CLEMENCY APPLICATIONS. SO YOU 

03:27:10.110 --> 03:27:14.416
SAW THE PRESIDENT MOVING AWAY ON
A COUPLE OF PRIORITIES. NOT ON 

03:27:14.639 --> 03:27:18.064
THE REST. DON'T THINK YOU WILL 
HEAR MANY COMPLAINTS FROM 

03:27:18.289 --> 03:27:20.684
DEMOCRAT GROUPS ABOUT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT MENTIONED AND WHAT HE 

03:27:20.915 --> 03:27:27.598
DIDN'T. IT IS REALLY DOWN TO 
SOME ACADEMICS THAT STILL 

03:27:27.810 --> 03:27:30.436
SUPPORT THAT AN ACTIVIST THAT 
STILL SUPPORT IT BUT NOT REALLY

03:27:35.844 --> 03:27:37.562
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ARE YOU WATCHING AND 

03:27:37.563 --> 03:27:39.504
LISTENING FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN 
UKRAINE TO IMPACT HOW AMERICAN 

03:27:39.505 --> 03:27:41.505
VOTERS ARE THINKING ABOUT 
LEADERSHIP?

03:27:44.645 --> 03:27:48.552
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WAS THAT A QUESTION FOR ME? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS. 

03:27:48.553 --> 03:27:53.249
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MISSED THE TOP OF IT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO FAR IN TEXAS, ONE 

03:27:53.463 --> 03:27:58.236
DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT BE 
RELATED TO THIS, A NAVY SEAL 

03:27:58.453 --> 03:28:00.453
THAT WAS RUNNING FOR ANOTHER 
STATE SEE,

03:28:06.699 --> 03:28:10.034
IT IS A SAFE SEAT THANKS TO THE 
NEW MAP BUT HE IS VERY CLOSE TO 

03:28:10.261 --> 03:28:12.604
WINNING WITHOUT A RUNOFF IN A 
RACE THAT EVEN SOME OF HIS 

03:28:12.816 --> 03:28:15.038
SUPPORTERS THOUGHT MIKE TO A 
SECOND ROUND. HE IS A DECORATED 

03:28:15.248 --> 03:28:18.717
NAVY SEAL. HE WAS BROUGHT INTO 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY RICK

03:28:18.932 --> 03:28:20.932
PERRY AND FACE THE PRIMARY 
AGAINST A CHALLENGER THAT WAS 

03:28:21.068 --> 03:28:23.477
ATTACKING HIM FOR TAKING MONEY 
LINKING HIM TO THE JANUARY 6 

03:28:23.701 --> 03:28:27.897
INVESTIGATION AND LINKING HIM TO
THE EFFORT. THAT APPEARS NOT TO 

03:28:28.460 --> 03:28:34.144
HAVE WORKED. IT COULD NOT HAVE 
HURT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 

03:28:34.860 --> 03:28:38.006
FOCUSED ON UKRAINE AND AMERICAN 
STRENGTH ABROAD AND BASICALLY 

03:28:38.841 --> 03:28:43.130
REAL ISSUES AFFECTING PEOPLE'S 
LIVES AROUND THE WORLD AND NOT 

03:28:43.368 --> 03:28:45.368
ON SOME OF THOSE

03:28:48.296 --> 03:28:51.338
PICK AN ISSUE. I HAVE NOT SEEN 
MUCH OF THAT YET. PEOPLE HAVE

03:28:56.141 --> 03:28:58.249
RUNNING FOR OFFICE WITH A COUPLE
OF EXCEPTIONS THEY PICK VERY 

03:28:58.459 --> 03:29:00.528
POPULAR WAYS TO GO AFTER RUSSIA.
THAT THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED 

03:29:00.747 --> 03:29:02.747
GOING AFTER OLIGARCHS

03:29:07.849 --> 03:29:10.787
. YOU START TO SEE THAT IN THE 
CAMPAIGNS BUT THE ONES I HAVE 

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.154
BEEN SEEING A MORE COMFORTABLE 
STICKING TO THE ISSUES THEY WERE

03:29:13.363 --> 03:29:15.363
ALREADY RUNNING ON A MAYBE 
LINKING THEM TO UKRAINE. GREG 

03:29:15.491 --> 03:29:17.491
ABBOTT WHO WON THE GOVERNOR'S 
NOMINATION FOR A THIRD TERM 

03:29:17.660 --> 03:29:19.660
TONIGHT, A LITTLE BIT MORE 
DEMANDING THAN IT LOOKED AT 

03:29:19.824 --> 03:29:22.125
FIRST AT THE VERY END OF THE 
CAMPAIGN IS REPEATING THIS 

03:29:22.334 --> 03:29:25.730
REFRAIN THAT JOE BIDEN IS MORE 
CONTAINED WITH THE UKRAINIAN 

03:29:25.947 --> 03:29:28.511
BORDER THAN THE U.S. AND MEXICAN
BORDER. THAT WILL BE A THEME IN 

03:29:28.726 --> 03:29:31.672
CAMPAIGNS AT LEAST FOR THE TIME 
BEING. MORE THAN SOLIDARITY WITH

03:29:31.887 --> 03:29:33.887
UKRAINE THE IDEA

03:29:37.327 --> 03:29:39.354
THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS
TOO FOCUSED ON OTHER COUNTRIES 

03:29:39.566 --> 03:29:42.065
AND IS LETTING CRIME RUN RAMPANT
THROUGH THE COUNTRY THANKS TO 

03:29:42.278 --> 03:29:44.636
THEIR INABILITY TO SECURE THE 
BORDER. THAT IS MORE OF A SAFE 

03:29:44.859 --> 03:29:47.093
DAYS FOR REPUBLICANS TO CAMPAIGN
THAN ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENING. 

03:29:47.305 --> 03:29:49.305
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:29:54.615 --> 03:29:56.641
WE SAW FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DEFENDING VLADIMIR PUTIN. WE SAW

03:29:56.853 --> 03:29:59.000
HIM OVER THE WEEKEND REALLY MAKE
THE STRONGEST INDICATION THAT HE

03:29:59.209 --> 03:30:01.209
MAY RUN FOR PRESIDENT

03:30:04.731 --> 03:30:07.008
IN 2024. HOW MUCH IS A HERO 
FACTOR IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS 

03:30:07.222 --> 03:30:09.241
AND WHAT VOTERS ARE LOOKING FOR 
AND LEADERSHIP? 

03:30:09.242 --> 03:30:14.071
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TEXAS IS A VERY GOOD PLACE TO
LOOK AT THAT. THE FORMER 

03:30:14.285 --> 03:30:16.946
PRESIDENT ENDORSED A LOT OF 
PEOPLE IN THESE PRIMARIES. KEN 

03:30:17.157 --> 03:30:21.016
PAXTON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS 
DEFINITELY

03:30:24.989 --> 03:30:27.486
GOING TO MAKE A RUNOFF AND WILL 
DEFINITELY BE THE LEADER HEADING

03:30:27.699 --> 03:30:30.153
INTO THE RUNOFF. THE FACT THAT 
TRUMP ENDORSED HIM ALMOST 

03:30:30.363 --> 03:30:36.539
GUARANTEES THAT TRUMP WILL TAKE 
CREDIT. IF HE GETS A RUNOFF 

03:30:36.749 --> 03:30:42.040
AGAINST GEORGE P BUSH I DO NOT 
KNOW WHAT TRUMP WILL DO IN THAT 

03:30:42.247 --> 03:30:45.113
CIRCUMSTANCE BUT THAT WAS KIND 
OF LIKE PAXTON'S PEOPLE WANT IS 

03:30:45.327 --> 03:30:47.910
REMINDING PEOPLE THAT THERE IS A
TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATE. 

03:30:48.123 --> 03:30:51.760
FURTHER DOWN THE BALLOT TRUMP 
ENDORSED A LOT OF CANDIDATES AND

03:30:51.975 --> 03:30:54.566
I THINK IT HELPED TO THEM TO GET
ENOUGH ATTENTION THAT THEY MAY 

03:30:54.797 --> 03:30:59.510
AND SHOULD AVOID RUNOFFS THAT 
INCLUDES THE 

03:30:59.942 --> 03:31:02.408
COMMISSIONER AND MONICA DE LA 
CRUZ WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE ONE 

03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:06.668
SWING SEAT IN THE STATE WHICH 
CONNECTS McALLEN TO THE GREATER 

03:31:06.885 --> 03:31:12.420
SAN ANTONIO AREA. SHE RAN IN 
2020 AND DID VERY WELL BECAUSE 

03:31:12.637 --> 03:31:18.839
OF THE SURGE IN SOUTH TEXAS. SHE
LOOKS LIKE SHE WILL CLEAR THIS 

03:31:19.055 --> 03:31:23.878
RACE WITHOUT A RUNOFF. THERE IS 
A PARTY SWITCHER IN THE 

03:31:24.824 --> 03:31:29.406
AREA. HE IS A CONSERVATIVE 
DEMOCRAT. 

03:31:30.642 --> 03:31:32.642
RUNNING ADS ABOUT

03:31:35.992 --> 03:31:38.350
HOW HE SUPPORTS TRUMP. HE ALSO 
LOOKS LIKE HE WILL SUCCEED. IF 

03:31:38.559 --> 03:31:40.871
YOU FLIP THIS A LITTLE BIT, 
REPUBLICANS WHO HAD CHALLENGED 

03:31:41.082 --> 03:31:44.714
TRUMP IN ANY WAY AND THIS IS 
USUALLY BY QUESTIONING WHETHER 

03:31:44.942 --> 03:31:49.320
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
OVERTURN THE ELECTION, THEY LOOK

03:31:49.534 --> 03:31:51.794
TO BE SURVIVING IN TEXAS BUT 
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL VOTE 

03:31:52.358 --> 03:31:54.358
AGAINST THEM.

03:31:57.745 --> 03:32:00.477
MAN TAYLOR IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE 
OF BEATING A RUNOFF AGAINST SOME

03:32:00.693 --> 03:32:02.610
CANDIDATES WITH EXPERIENCE BUT 
REALLY A BALLOT THAT EXISTS 

03:32:02.611 --> 03:32:05.786
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT BIDEN WON 
THE ELECTION IN 2020. THAT 

03:32:06.001 --> 03:32:10.699
FUELED THE PRIMARY AGAINST HIM. 
IN THE JUDICIAL RACE IT LOOKS 

03:32:11.051 --> 03:32:14.861
LIKE AN INCUMBENT JUDGE WILL WIN
AGAIN FOR THAT SEE

03:32:18.338 --> 03:32:20.708
BY AT LEAST 10 POINTS BUT THE 
FACT THAT HE WAS BEING 

03:32:20.921 --> 03:32:25.157
CHALLENGED WAS DUE TO 
CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS WITH IN 

03:32:25.368 --> 03:32:27.507
TEXAS COMPLAINING THAT HE DID 
NOT DO MORE TO CHALLENGE THE 

03:32:27.725 --> 03:32:30.098
ELECTION RESULTS. SO THE STORY 
IN TEXAS OVER THE NEXT 12 WEEKS 

03:32:30.305 --> 03:32:36.500
WILL BE KEN PAXTON, NOT JUST THE
MAN BEHIND THIS TEXAS LAWSUIT TO

03:32:37.248 --> 03:32:42.057
OVERTURN THE ELECTION RESULTS 
BUT HIM IN A RUNOFF WITH GEORGE 

03:32:42.621 --> 03:32:49.137
P BUSH. YOU WILL HAVE A 
CONSERVATIVE RUNOFF WITH TRUMP 

03:32:49.350 --> 03:32:53.423
AS A DECISIVE FACTOR OR. I THINK
THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE DONALD 

03:32:53.635 --> 03:32:55.635
TRUMP IS VERY HAPPY TO BE

03:32:58.801 --> 03:33:01.377
. THE IDEA THAT HE REMAINS IN 
CONTROL OF THE PARTIES AND THEIR

03:33:01.597 --> 03:33:03.887
NARRATIVE AND FOCUS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO 

03:33:04.327 --> 03:33:06.327
BRING IN

03:33:08.529 --> 03:33:10.730
JAMES HOHMANN TO TALK ABOUT THE 
MIDTERMS. IT MAY FEEL LIKE 

03:33:10.946 --> 03:33:13.517
NOVEMBER IS FAR AWAY BUT FOR 
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS TEAM AND

03:33:13.737 --> 03:33:16.152
FOR  POLITICAL OPERATIVES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY MARCH 1 IS A BIG 

03:33:16.378 --> 03:33:18.695
DAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS THE START OF THE 

03:33:18.919 --> 03:33:20.853
PRIMARY SEASON. THE MIDTERMS 
LITERALLY HAVE BEGUN WITH THIS 

03:33:20.854 --> 03:33:25.033
VOTE IN TEXAS TODAY. THE STATE 
OF THE UNION WILL BE MUCH LATER 

03:33:25.247 --> 03:33:29.900
THAN YOU TYPICALLY WOULD SEE THE
STATE OF THE UNION. THIS IS THE 

03:33:30.113 --> 03:33:32.959
FIRST TIME IN A CENTURY WE HAVE 
SEEN THE STATE OF THE UNION 

03:33:33.182 --> 03:33:35.182
HAPPENED IN MARCH.

03:33:40.849 --> 03:33:42.849
IT IS HAPPENING AGAINST THE 
BACKDROP OF THESE ELECTIONS. I 

03:33:43.205 --> 03:33:45.335
MENTIONED RIGHT AFTER THE SPEECH
ENDED THAT IT SEEMED LIKE BIDEN 

03:33:45.553 --> 03:33:47.246
WAS PREPARING FOR DIVIDED 
GOVERNMENT. THE NUMBERS ARE 

03:33:47.247 --> 03:33:49.247
PRETTY TOUGH FOR DEMOCRATS.

03:33:53.393 --> 03:33:55.870
THESE ARE THE SENATE RACES AND 
CYCLE. IF YOU TALK TO ANY 

03:33:56.079 --> 03:33:57.782
DEMOCRAT ON CAPITOL HILL DAY 
WILL ESSENTIALLY ACKNOWLEDGE 

03:33:57.783 --> 03:34:00.826
THAT THE HOUSE IS LOST FOR THEM.
THAT REPUBLICANS WILL CONTROL 

03:34:01.035 --> 03:34:02.992
THE HOUSE. 50-50 SENATE 
DEMOCRATS STILL HAVE SOME HOPES 

03:34:02.993 --> 03:34:06.790
OF CARRYING WITH KAMALA HARRIS 
CASTING THE TIE-BREAKING VOTE. 

03:34:07.010 --> 03:34:09.049
WE CAN GO TO ANOTHER GRAPHIC 
THAT SHOWS THE COMPETITIVE 

03:34:09.801 --> 03:34:14.574
SENATE RACES. IT IS A LOT OF 

03:34:16.319 --> 03:34:20.630
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION STATES
BIDEN NARROWLY WON IN 2020. THE 

03:34:20.843 --> 03:34:23.665
WASHINGTON POST POLL THAT CAME 
OUT THIS WEEK AND SHOWED THAT 

03:34:23.887 --> 03:34:25.918
REPUBLICANS HAVE A LEAD ON THE 
GENERIC BALLOT WHICH GENERALLY 

03:34:26.325 --> 03:34:30.839
ASKS VOTERS WHO YOU WOULD RATHER
HAVE CONTROL CONGRESS.

03:34:35.399 --> 03:34:37.736
THEY HAVE THE SAME LEAD THAT THE
DEMOCRATS HAD BEFORE THE 2018 

03:34:37.954 --> 03:34:41.843
MIDTERM ELECTIONS WHICH WERE 
OBVIOUSLY HUGE FOR DEMOCRATS. IF

03:34:42.051 --> 03:34:44.866
THOSE NUMBERS HOLD YOU ARE VERY 
LIKELY TO SEE REPUBLICAN PICKUPS

03:34:45.308 --> 03:34:48.129
IN GEORGIA AND ARIZONA AND 
POTENTIALLY NEVADA

03:34:52.708 --> 03:34:58.019
AND WISCONSIN, NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
YOU COULD REALLY SEE A PRETTY 

03:34:58.232 --> 03:35:00.232
SIGNIFICANT REPUBLICAN PICKUP. 
THAT IS WHY

03:35:04.059 --> 03:35:06.174
YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE 
PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE DID NOT TALK

03:35:06.383 --> 03:35:10.679
ABOUT JANUARY 6 OR DONALD TRUMP.
HE FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES THAT 

03:35:10.889 --> 03:35:13.307
HE CALLED THE UNITY AGENDA ON 
FOREIGN-POLICY. IT IS ABOUT 

03:35:13.522 --> 03:35:15.566
TRYING TO IMPROVE HIS PARTY'S 
STANDING

03:35:19.711 --> 03:35:23.409
SO HE CAN GET MORE DONE DURING 
THE LAST YEARS OF HIS TERM. 

03:35:23.410 --> 03:35:27.158
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE 

03:35:27.843 --> 03:35:29.843
WASHINGTON POST

03:35:32.457 --> 03:35:34.568
OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF 
THE UNION ADDRESS. WE HAVE BEEN 

03:35:34.777 --> 03:35:37.128
TALKING ABOUT POLITICS AND THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS BUT LET'S GO 

03:35:37.341 --> 03:35:40.347
BACK TO THE TOP OF PRESIDENT 
BIDEN'S SPEECH. AT THE VERY 

03:35:40.561 --> 03:35:44.803
BEGINNING HE TOOK TIME TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE AMBASSADOR TO 

03:35:45.014 --> 03:35:47.130
THE UNITED STATES WHO WAS 
ATTENDING AS A GUEST OF THE 

03:35:47.343 --> 03:35:51.093
FIRST LADY. LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO EVERY UKRAINIAN. THEIR 

03:35:51.311 --> 03:35:53.522
FEARLESSNESS AND DETERMINATION 
LITERALLY INSPIRES THE WORLD. 

03:35:53.939 --> 03:35:56.163
GROUPS OF CITIZENS BLOCKING 
TANKS WITH THEIR BODIES. 

03:35:56.387 --> 03:36:01.626
EVERYBODY FROM STUDENTS TO 
RETIREES AND TEACHERS TURNING 

03:36:01.834 --> 03:36:05.066
SOLDIERS DEFENDING THEIR 
HOMELAND. THIS STRUGGLE,

03:36:11.338 --> 03:36:13.266
PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY 
SAID IN HIS SPEECH LIGHT WOMAN 

03:36:13.267 --> 03:36:15.267
OVER DARKNESS. UKRAINIAN A 
BYSTANDER  OF THE UNITED STATES 

03:36:15.391 --> 03:36:18.513
IS HERE TONIGHT SITTING WITH THE
FIRST LADY. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO 

03:36:18.720 --> 03:36:20.720
STAND

03:36:22.311 --> 03:36:27.841
SEND AN UNMISTAKABLE SIGNAL TO 
THE WORLD. THANK YOU. 

03:36:27.842 --> 03:36:33.830
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS EARLIER TONIGHT. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN ACKNOWLEDGING 

03:36:34.233 --> 03:36:37.302
THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED STATES. LET'S BRING JOYCE

03:36:37.514 --> 03:36:39.514
BACK TO THE CONVERSATION.

03:36:43.497 --> 03:36:46.065
WE KNEW THAT UKRAINE WOULD BE 
THE TOP ITEM AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:36:46.781 --> 03:36:48.781
TONIGHT'S SPEECH.

03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:03.235
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL EYES WERE ON PRESIDENT 
BIDEN AS THE RUSSIAN INVASION

03:37:18.456 --> 03:37:20.944
. HE STARTED OFF THE SPEECH BY 
TALKING ABOUT HIS SUPPORT FOR 

03:37:21.156 --> 03:37:26.139
THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE, REALLY 
EMPHASIZING THEIR COURAGE AND 

03:37:26.349 --> 03:37:28.349
MOMENTS LIKE WE HAVE SEEN

03:37:31.234 --> 03:37:33.234
ON THE GROUND WHERE UKRAINIAN 
PEOPLE ARE STANDING UP TO 

03:37:33.386 --> 03:37:39.464
RUSSIAN TANKS. THAT HE TALKED 
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN. LISTEN TO 

03:37:39.674 --> 03:37:41.674
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

03:37:47.653 --> 03:37:50.236
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SIX DAYS AGO RUSSIA WAS ONE 
OF THE PATENTS SOUGHT TO SHAKE 

03:37:50.444 --> 03:37:52.799
THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE FREE 
WORLD THINKING HE COULD MAKE IT 

03:37:53.005 --> 03:37:57.954
AND TO HIS MENACING WAYS. HE 
BADLY MISCALCULATED. HE THOUGHT 

03:37:58.169 --> 03:38:00.200
HE COULD ROLL INTO UKRAINE AND 
THE WORLD WOULD ROLLOVER. 

03:38:00.405 --> 03:38:04.824
INSTEAD, HE MET WITH A WALL OF 
STRENGTHS HE NEVER ANTICIPATED 

03:38:05.039 --> 03:38:07.039
OR IMAGINED. HE MET THE 
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE]

03:38:18.578 --> 03:38:21.320
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY
MOMENTS WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING 

03:38:21.532 --> 03:38:24.735
OF THE SPEECH WHERE A BIPARTISAN
GROUP OF LAWMAKERS, REALLY 

03:38:24.947 --> 03:38:27.385
EVERYBODY IN THE CHAMBER STOOD 
UP TO GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO

03:38:27.594 --> 03:38:29.625
THE MESSAGE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN
HAD FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN IN 

03:38:29.830 --> 03:38:31.947
SUPPORT OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE 
AS THEY ENDURE THIS INVASION OF 

03:38:32.303 --> 03:38:35.862
THEIR COUNTRY. HE DID MAKE ONE 
CLEAR DISTINCTION. PRESIDENT 

03:38:36.071 --> 03:38:40.684
BIDEN IS, OF COURSE, THE 
PRESIDENT WHO JUST WITHIN THE 

03:38:41.232 --> 03:38:43.232
LAST YEAR WITHDREW

03:38:45.725 --> 03:38:47.725
ALL OF THE TROOPS FROM 
AFGHANISTAN SO HE IS SOMEBODY 

03:38:47.854 --> 03:38:52.602
WHO IS VERY AWARE OF HOW MUCH OF
A WAR WEARY NATION WE ARE AND HE

03:38:52.814 --> 03:38:55.845
HAD A MESSAGE DIRECTLY 
ADDRESSING THAT, SAYING THAT WE 

03:38:56.059 --> 03:39:03.496
WILL NOT BE AT WAR WITH UKRAINE 
AND OUR FORCES WILL NOT BE 

03:39:03.718 --> 03:39:05.718
DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THIS 
CONFLICT, BUT REITERATING HIS 

03:39:05.892 --> 03:39:07.892
SUPPORT OF

03:39:10.725 --> 03:39:12.725
THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE

03:39:20.713 --> 03:39:25.594
. HE SAID VERY PLAINLY THAT OUR 
FORCES ARE NOT GOING TO EUROPE 

03:39:25.804 --> 03:39:29.975
TO FIGHT IN UKRAINE. HE SAID IN 
THE EVENT THAT PUTIN DECIDES TO 

03:39:30.188 --> 03:39:32.478
KEEP MOVING WEST HE WILL 
CONTINUE TO DEFEND OUR NATO 

03:39:32.689 --> 03:39:34.689
ALLIES.

03:39:36.422 --> 03:39:39.249
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH JOYCE. 
LET'S GO TO THE WASHINGTON POST 

03:39:39.463 --> 03:39:42.347
REPORTER MARIANNA SOTO MAYOR WHO
WAS IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER TONIGHT

03:39:44.483 --> 03:39:46.637
TO WITNESS PRESIDENT BIDEN STATE
OF THE UNION ADDRESS IN PERSON. 

03:39:46.852 --> 03:39:51.213
SHE JOINS US NOW. THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR TAKING A MOMENT TO TALK

03:39:51.428 --> 03:39:57.771
WITH US. FIRST OF ALL, JUST GIVE
US A SENSE OF WHAT WE WERE NOT 

03:39:57.977 --> 03:40:00.793
ABLE TO SEE AND FEEL BECAUSE WE 
WERE NOT THERE. WHAT WAS IT LIKE

03:40:01.001 --> 03:40:03.478
TO BE IN THE CHAMBER TONIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM 

03:40:03.686 --> 03:40:05.686
LAST YEAR. THE MAIN REASON WHY 
IS

03:40:10.497 --> 03:40:12.564
BARELY ANY MEMBERS WORE MASKS. 
YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR MANY 

03:40:12.779 --> 03:40:14.779
MEMBERS WERE SEPARATED FROM EACH
OTHER. EVERYBODY IN THE CHAMBER 

03:40:14.944 --> 03:40:18.760
HAD TO WEAR A MASK. NOW MANY 
PEOPLE, NOT MANY PEOPLE ATTENDED

03:40:18.989 --> 03:40:21.437
FOR THAT REASON SO THAT'S THE 
NUMBER ONE THING I NOTICED VERY 

03:40:21.967 --> 03:40:24.689
EARLY ON. I'M SURE THAT YOU SAW 
THAT MANY MEMBERS WERE WEARING 

03:40:24.902 --> 03:40:27.236
THE COLORS OF THE UKRAINIAN FLAG
BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT WE ACTUALLY

03:40:27.446 --> 03:40:32.208
SAW A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN 
BRIAN FITZPATRICK HANDING OUT 

03:40:32.545 --> 03:40:34.450
THE UKRAINIAN FLAG WHICH MANY 
MEMBERS WAVED DURING THE 

03:40:34.451 --> 03:40:36.451
BIPARTISAN MOMENT THAT

03:40:39.635 --> 03:40:41.764
HE SPOKE ABOUT BACK IN UKRAINE 
AT EVERY POSSIBLE STEP. THERE 

03:40:41.972 --> 03:40:47.711
WERE OTHER TIMES THAT 
REPUBLICANS JOINED DEMOCRATS IN 

03:40:47.916 --> 03:40:52.811
GIVING BIDEN A STANDING OVATION.
WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT ADDING MORE 

03:40:53.024 --> 03:40:55.024
TECHNOLOGY

03:40:58.137 --> 03:41:03.712
RESOURCES AND THE FIRST TIME WE 
SAW CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE 

03:41:03.929 --> 03:41:08.637
TAYLOR GREENE  AND LAUREN

03:41:16.235 --> 03:41:19.127
BOEBERT STAND UP AND CHEER WHEN 
HE SAID WE ARE ALL AGAINST  THE 

03:41:19.338 --> 03:41:24.292
FUNDING THE POLICE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU MENTIONED 

03:41:24.922 --> 03:41:26.922
BOEBERT. LET'S TALK ABOUT HER 
OUTBURST 

03:41:30.687 --> 03:41:33.308
. WHAT WAS THE REACTION BY 
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE CHAMBER? 

03:41:33.525 --> 03:41:37.129
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE 
THEY WERE SITTING VERY CLOSE TO 

03:41:37.877 --> 03:41:40.635
EACH OTHER AND THEY WERE SITTING
WITH A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN 

03:41:40.851 --> 03:41:45.379
FRESHMEN. FOR THE MOST PART, 
THEY SAT DOWN A LOT. MANY 

03:41:45.604 --> 03:41:50.156
REPORTERS WERE WATCHING THEM 
BECAUSE THEY WERE TALKING 

03:41:50.399 --> 03:41:54.580
AMONGST EACH OTHER LAUGHING AT 
TIMES WHEN BIDEN WOULD SAY 

03:41:54.793 --> 03:41:58.704
SOMETHING. OF COURSE, THE ONE 
OUTBURST CAME FROM

03:42:00.665 --> 03:42:06.216
BIDEN STARTED TO TALK ABOUT IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN. HE WAS TALKING 

03:42:06.422 --> 03:42:09.337
ABOUT THE FACT THAT MANY 
VETERANS HAD COME HOME TO THE 

03:42:09.551 --> 03:42:11.772
U.S. AFTER THOSE WARS AND 
DEVELOPED CANCER AND FOUND 

03:42:12.114 --> 03:42:16.815
THEMSELVES DRAPED WITH THE 
AMERICAN FLAG OVER THERE COFFIN 

03:42:17.033 --> 03:42:22.999
AND AT THAT POINT IS WHEN SHE 
ACTUALLY YELLED ESSENTIALLY 

03:42:23.241 --> 03:42:27.777
BLAMING BIDEN THAT IT WAS HIS 
FAULT. HE MENTIONED, YOU KILLED 

03:42:28.535 --> 03:42:30.535
13 AMERICANS

03:42:32.313 --> 03:42:37.296
. SHE WAS REFERENCING THE 13 
AMERICANS THAT DIED WHEN BIDEN 

03:42:37.514 --> 03:42:39.876
WITHDREW TROOPS FROM THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT IS SOMETHING 

03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:42.100
THAT

03:42:44.754 --> 03:42:49.296
WAS THEM NOTABLE PART BUT 
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE WAS 

03:42:50.062 --> 03:42:52.062
HAGGLING 

03:42:54.183 --> 03:42:56.212
WITH SOME MEMBERS SAME SIT DOWN 
OR BE QUIET. 

03:42:56.213 --> 03:42:58.213
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:43:01.572 --> 03:43:03.894
JAMES, IN A WAY IT SERVES A 
PURPOSE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING 

03:43:04.103 --> 03:43:06.124
ABOUT THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
WHO CHOSE NOT TO COMPORT 

03:43:06.329 --> 03:43:10.507
THEMSELVES WITH RESPECT TONIGHT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING 

03:43:10.717 --> 03:43:12.717
ON HERE. THE COLLEGIALITY

03:43:18.946 --> 03:43:22.730
. THESE ARE WAYS THAT WE SAW 
SOME UNITY ON TONIGHT IN THE 

03:43:22.941 --> 03:43:28.287
STATE OF THE UNION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT GOT LESS ATTENTION THAN 

03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:31.337
LAUREN BOEBERT AND MARJORIE 
TAYLOR GREENE  THAT I NOTICED 

03:43:31.618 --> 03:43:35.769
THAT JOE MANCHIN SAT WITH MITT 
ROMNEY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF

03:43:35.983 --> 03:43:39.597
THE AISLE. IT IS A REMINDER THAT
IT IS A 50-50 SENATE. THEY NEED 

03:43:40.202 --> 03:43:45.442
EVERY DEMOCRAT TO PASS 
EVERYTHING ON PARTY LINES. THE 

03:43:45.652 --> 03:43:50.837
PRESIDENT APPOINTED THE TIME 
BUILD BACK BETTER BECAUSE JOE 

03:43:51.048 --> 03:43:53.266
MANCHIN MADE CLEAR HE'S NOT 
GOING TO VOTE FOR BUILD BACK 

03:43:53.481 --> 03:43:58.022
BETTER. THE FIRST STATE OF THE 
UNION IS DO NO HARM. PRESIDENT 

03:43:58.229 --> 03:44:01.155
BIDEN DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO 
HURT HIMSELF TONIGHT.

03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:08.212
HE IS TRYING TO WIN BACK PEOPLE 
WHO VOTED FOR HIM

03:44:10.906 --> 03:44:15.041
THEY WERE WATCHING THOSE FIRST 
10 MINUTES ABOUT UKRAINE AND THE

03:44:15.267 --> 03:44:19.332
LAST 10 MINUTES ABOUT THE UNITY 
AGENDA, IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT 

03:44:19.548 --> 03:44:21.548
HE WILL MAKE INROADS

03:44:29.796 --> 03:44:33.986
. THESE DO NOT LEAD TO THE KIND 
OF 

03:44:38.402 --> 03:44:43.298
WILL SEE, PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL 
FLY TO

03:44:46.725 --> 03:44:48.725
WISCONSIN TOMORROW TO TRY TO 
CONTINUE HAMMERING ON SOME OF 

03:44:48.811 --> 03:44:50.811
THESE THEMES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO 

03:44:50.853 --> 03:44:55.590
TO RHONDA COLVIN FOR FINAL 
THOUGHTS TONIGHT.  

03:44:55.591 --> 03:44:59.935
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WAS A MIX OF SO MANY 
CRUCIAL ISSUES FACING THIS 

03:45:00.152 --> 03:45:02.278
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THIS 
CONGRESS. FROM WHAT I AM HEARING

03:45:02.502 --> 03:45:07.559
FROM PEOPLE ON THE HILL BETWEEN 
THE TIME YOU CAME TO ME I HAVE 

03:45:07.983 --> 03:45:10.510
BEEN TRYING TO SPEAK TO MEMBERS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LINE OF PEOPLE

03:45:10.728 --> 03:45:14.824
WHO WANTED TO TALK TO US. WE 
CAN'T BE ON ALL NIGHT BUT IT 

03:45:15.048 --> 03:45:17.048
APPEARS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE 

03:45:17.114 --> 03:45:20.229
HERE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE. 
OFF-CAMERA SOME TOLD ME THAT 

03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:23.275
THEY ARE GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT
THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS 

03:45:23.480 --> 03:45:26.945
AHEAD IN UKRAINE. IT LOOKS LIKE 
THERE IS CERTAINLY UNITY IN 

03:45:27.154 --> 03:45:32.383
THEIR AND WE SAW THE PRESIDENT 
TAP INTO THAT UNITY. OF COURSE, 

03:45:32.786 --> 03:45:34.676
THE DOMESTIC AGENDA. I JUST 
SPOKE TO A REPUBLICAN 

03:45:34.677 --> 03:45:37.529
CONGRESSMAN WHO TALK ABOUT SOME 
OF THE ISSUES HE HAD WITH 

03:45:37.933 --> 03:45:41.410
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ENERGY 
POLICIES. IT SEEMS LIKE THE 

03:45:42.172 --> 03:45:45.273
DOMESTIC PROPOSALS ARE STILL IN 
FLUX

03:45:51.083 --> 03:45:54.331
. THERE WAS A LOT TO WATCH IN 
THE NEXT COMING DAYS AND MONTHS 

03:45:54.537 --> 03:45:58.567
INCLUDING THE TRAIL TO THE 
MIDTERMS. THAT IS WHAT IS ALSO 

03:45:58.787 --> 03:46:01.339
ON SO MANY PEOPLE'S MINDS RIGHT 
NOW. THE HOUSE HAS HAD A RECORD 

03:46:01.679 --> 03:46:03.918
NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE 
DECIDED NOT TO SEEK REELECTION. 

03:46:04.124 --> 03:46:06.124
THERE IS SO CONCERNED THERE

03:46:09.079 --> 03:46:11.704
THAT THIS COULD BE A REPUBLICAN 
CONTROLLED HOUSE AFTER THE NEXT 

03:46:12.067 --> 03:46:15.185
ELECTION. A CONFLUENCE OF SO 
MANY ISSUES HAPPENING ON CAPITOL

03:46:15.396 --> 03:46:17.396
HILL.

03:46:21.657 --> 03:46:23.883
SO MANY MEMBERS ARE BEHIND THE 
PRESIDENT ON UKRAINE. IT'S JUST 

03:46:24.121 --> 03:46:26.820
THOSE DOMESTIC ISSUES THAT WILL 
TAKE SOME TIME. THE QUESTION 

03:46:27.036 --> 03:46:29.275
STILL REMAINS WILL THEY EVER BE 
ACCOMPLISHED. 

03:46:29.276 --> 03:46:34.264
