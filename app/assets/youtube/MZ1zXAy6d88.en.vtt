00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.520
- There are rules and
regulations that what she says

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.210
and what she communicates
and what she deliberates

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.110
should be part of
the historical record.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.990
But she chose to say, "No,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.410
I'm not going to follow
those rules and regulations.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.200
Not only am I going
to have private email,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.400
I'm going to put
the server in my house,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200
so that there's no way anyone

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.790
could find out
what was really said".

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.950
Certainly, it would be nice
to have a historical record,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.270
to know what the president
said in other nations

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.920
and to have classified
information back,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920
but we don't know
precisely what's been lost

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.170
and what will be able
to be recovered.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.610
And, as I said before,
he has a long list of things

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.040
he's done that I consider to be
very detrimental to the nation

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590
and I add this to the list.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.920
I don't put it at the top
of the list.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.980
It's more down
towards the bottom.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.220
- Secretary Clinton sent
and received emails

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.860
that contained
highly classified information.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.730
If the average American
did that,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.570
they'd lose their clearance,
their job,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.330
and might even go to jail.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.350
The law's the law
and it ought to be enforced.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.570
I wouldn't separate Trump from
any other public official, see?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.420
I mean, there's nothing special
about him or anybody else.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.320
The law says you got to preserve
records,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.710
so you preserve records.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.280
- Hillary Clinton
is disqualified

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.460
from being the
commander-in-chief

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.740
of the United States.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.050
In fact, one of her first acts

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.870
as president may very well
be to pardon herself.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.950
Because Hillary Clinton stored

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.340
classified information
on her private server.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.310
They've made up so many stories
about Donald Trump

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.730
over the years
that, I mean,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.960
things that I just knew
are flat-out untrue.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.890
But, nowadays, in the mainstream
media,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.750
you just need one source
to smear Donald Trump.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.140
Maybe you don't even need that.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.970
So it's hard to tell anymore
what really happened

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.890
and what didn't.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.300
The documents that were
at Mar-a-Lago,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.910
by all accounts,
were turned over.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.490
Look, if the process wasn't
followed there,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.500
then there needs to be something
that happens about that.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.900
It's not a crime,
I don't believe.
