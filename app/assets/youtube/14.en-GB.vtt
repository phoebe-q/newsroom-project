00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.480
Joe Rogan is a media phenomenon.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.440
In 2019, his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.000
was reportedly downloaded
190m times in a month.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.920
He has over 11m YouTube subscribers.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.080
And in 2020 Joe Rogan’s podcast was signed in an exclusive deal by Spotify for $100m.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.400
The format is simple. A vast array of guests talk with him about a vast array of subjects.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.720
Sometimes for hours. And Joe Rogan and his guests can also sometimes cause controversy.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.760
In December, one guest, the virologist Dr Robert Malone,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.760
made a number of misleading claims about vaccines during the podcast.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.960
Which prompted this reaction:

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.240
Having people on there, giving opinions about the vaccines

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.960
that are not based on science is just not...

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
it's counter to public health right now and it's just not the right thing to do.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.280
Dr Wallace was one of 270
healthcare professionals

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040
who wrote an open letter to Spotify

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.960
urging it to act on misinformation in
Joe Rogan’s podcast.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.160
But it was the intervention of one of rock music’s original rebels

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.240
that made this story go global.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.320
Neil Young threatened to pull his music from Spotify saying:

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
'They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.'

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.520
Well Spotify chose Rogan. And Young’s music has been removed at his request.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.960
A few days later, another Canadian legend, Joni Mitchell followed suit.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.120
And Joe Rogan has responded to the entire furore with a video on Instagram.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.600
So my pledge to you is that I will do my best

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.800
to try to balance out these more controversial

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.040
viewpoints with other people’s perspectives

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.000
so we can maybe find a better point of view.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.920
Spotify also responded. It released a statement saying the company is

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.000
working to add a content advisory to any podcast episode

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.640
that includes a discussion about Covid-19.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.600
So Rogan stays. But with a warning.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.920
And we can’t understand that decision without understanding the finances behind this.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.360
Really the bottom line for Spotify is that

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.720
if you play a Joni Mitchell or Neil Young song,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.920
70% of the money that that generates has to go to the artists and their record labels

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.200
and their publishers,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.440
when one person plays the Joe Rogan podcast, Spotify keeps all of that money

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.240
and that will very much be behind the business decision here.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.640
Exclusive podcasts are lucrative, they draw in subscribers and advertisers.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.040
But Spotify has taken a hit with this
Joe Rogan controversy.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280
Shares slumped, before recovering slightly,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.040
after the company projected
lower profit margins.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.960
And the head of Spotify has addressed what's happened in a call to investors.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.600
We're trying to balance creative expression with the safety of our users.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.520
It is a balance. But if you shift from music streaming to content creation

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.800
that comes with new responsibilities.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.880
Spotify now find themselves in a similar position to the big social media platforms

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.520
have done in recent years, where they are constantly trying to deny that they should

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.280
have any responsibility because they don't want to be regulated like a publisher.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.280
Spotify's Daniel Ek has made his position on content clear, writing:

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000
'It's important to me that we don't take on

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.640
the position of being content censor.'

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.160
But every content company takes positions on what it will and won’t publish.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.000
That’s not censorship,
that’s taking an editorial position.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.880
Some, though, argue you need to listen to Joe Rogan to understand what's happening here.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.720
Jemima Kelly writing in the Financial Times this week said

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.520
if Joe Rogan’s critics listened to his podcast:

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.360
'they would know that the presenter is a genuinely open-minded host who seeks out

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.920
all sorts of opinions rather than blindly following those of a particular tribe'.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.880
For his part Joe Rogan says he explores ideas that are controversial

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.880
but can later become mainstream,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.760
like the Wuhan lab leak theory on Covid-19.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.600
And Batya Ungar-Sargon from Newsweek argues he’s meeting a need.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.880
Joe Rogan is producing content for people

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.520
who want to see their own scepticism

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.680
reflected in what he's saying.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.360
They're not going to him for medical advice.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.760
They're going to him to hear

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.320
how other people think.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.120
They are. But on occasion they will also hear, sometimes unchecked, opinions

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.720
that are not rooted in available evidence. And for some that’s a problem.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.480
The notion that he has such a large audience

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.120
being constantly confused,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.360
fed this information,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.160
is just too much.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.520
It is harmful to our ability to,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.520
if not end, at least diminish the impacts

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.840
of this pandemic as soon as possible.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.560
Both Spotify and Joe Rogan know that he and his guests are what make the show.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.560
The podcast is different. And that difference is hugely popular.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.080
But just as Joe Rogan has the right to talk to who he wants

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.120
so musicians and scientists have the right to urge Spotify

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.920
not to give a platform to Covid advice that isn't rooted in available evidence.
