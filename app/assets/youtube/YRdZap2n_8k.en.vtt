00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:40.461
&gt;&gt;&gt; THE NATION'S TOP INFECTIOUS 
DISEASE EXPERT SAYS HE WILL WARN

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:45.124
THE SENATE THAT REOPENING THE 
ECONOMY TOO FAST COULD CAUSE 

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:50.617
NEEDLESS SUFFERING AND DEATH. 
ANTHONY FAUCI SPEAKS BEFORE THE 

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:55.324
LABOR AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE. 
ALONG WITH THREE OTHER HEALTH 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.703
OFFICIALS. YOU CAN SEE THE 
HEARING ROOM SET UP FOR SOCIAL 

00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:03.807
DISTANCE. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE 
FROM THE WASHINGTON POST. I'M 

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.973
LINDSEY CASEY. TODAY'S HEARING 
IS SCHEDULED TO START AT 10:00 

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:12.346
EASTERN TIME. 
IT'S DR. FAUCI'S FIRST TIME 

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.680
APPEARING BEFORE CONGRESS SINCE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED A 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.843
PUBLIC EMERGENCY BACK IN MARCH. 
AND THE FEDERAL OFFICIAL WHO 

00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:22.969
OVERSEES THE CORONAVIRUS TESTING
EFFORTS. WELL, JOINING ME TODAY 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.549
TO TALK ABOUT THE HEARING. 
YASMINE ABU TALA. 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.212
IT'S SO GOOD FOR YOU TO BE WITH 
US FROM YOUR HOME. SINCE WE'RE 

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:34.552
PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING. 
WHAT IS SO KEY 

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:40.879
ABOUT TODAY'S HEARING, YASMINE? 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:45.662
SEEN A HEALTH OFFICIAL TESTIFY 
SINCE MARCH. THE HEARING TODAY 

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:49.305
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT 
REOPENING THE COUNTRY. 

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:55.735
ASKING ABOUT HOW TO SAFELY 

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:03.161
GO BACK TO WORK. MOST HAVE TO 
QUARANTINE BECAUSE THEY CAME IN 

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:15.014
CONFIRMED CONTACT WITH CASES. 
AND DR. JAWA, FROM HHS. THEY ARE

00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:19.774
ALL QUARANTINING AT HOME RIGHT 
NOW, BECAUSE THEY CAME IN 

00:02:20.024 --> 00:02:25.603
CONTACT WITH VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE'S PRESS SECRET EAR, WHO 

00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:28.590
TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS 
LAST WEEK. 

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:31.717
THERE ARE QUESTIONS IF THEY 
CAN'T KEEP CASES OUT OF THE 

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:34.730
BUILDING, THEN HOW CAN AMERICANS
FEEL SAFE GOING BACK TO 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.193
WORKPLACES THAT WILL LIKELY HAVE
MUCH FEWER RESOURCES? AND LAMAR 

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:42.856
ALEXANDER, THE COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN IS ALSO CONDUCTING THE 

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:46.639
HEARING VIRTUALLY, BECAUSE ONE 
OF HIS STAFF MEMBERS TESTED 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.515
POSITIVE. SO HE'S CONDUCTING IT 
REMOTELY FROM HIS HOME. 

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:53.729
&gt;&gt; I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE 
IRONY 

00:02:56.752 --> 00:03:01.849
OF THAT, YASMEN. IT IS 

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:09.225
IMPORTANT TO -- I'M GOING TO 
TURN TO OUR CORRESPONDENT, 

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:14.735
RHONDA COLVIN. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:16.514
UNUSUAL LOGISTICS OF TODAY'S 
HEARING? 

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:18.515
&gt;&gt; GOOD TO HEAR YOU 

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:26.955
AS WELL, LIBBY.
THESE ARE GOING TO BE 

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:32.498
PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING 
REMOTELY. THAT INCLUDES CHAIRMAN

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:37.341
LAMAR ALEXANDER. AND I'M ALSO 
HEARING THAT SENATOR MURRAY, THE

00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:39.874
LEADING AIDE FROM WASHINGTON 
STATE WILL BE DOING THIS FROM 

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:43.887
HOME AS WELL. THEY WILL HAVE 
PEOPLE, INCLUDING DR. FAUCI 

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:46.425
GIVING THEIR STATEMENTS TODAY 
THIS. IS CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT 

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.180
LANDSCAPE ON THE HILL. PART OF A
NEW NORMAL. 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.654
WHEN YOU GET A SHOT OF THE ROOM,
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT THE 

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:56.140
CHAIRS ARE GOING TO BE SEPARATED
SO TATHEY ARE 6'APART. 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.357
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THIS.

00:03:59.597 --> 00:04:02.550
AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CANNOT
BE ON THE HILL RIGHT NOW 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.496
ANYWAYS. BUT THIS COMMITTEE WILL
BE FAR DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE 

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:11.629
ARE USED TO. I'M ALSO HEARING 
SOME OF THEM MAY BE ATTENDING 

00:04:12.306 --> 00:04:15.833
VIRTUALLY. AND THERE WILL BE TV 
MONITORS IN THAT ROOM AS WELL. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.886
SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THOSE 
PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY. PART OF

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:23.090
THE NORMALCY THAT YOU WILL SEE. 
THERE WILL BE A FIVE-MINUTE 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.392
ROUND OF QUESTIONING FOR EACH OF
THE SENATORS  WHO ASKED DR. 

00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:28.889
FAUCI AND OTHERS THE QUESTIONS 
THEY HAD ON THEIR MIND, 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.585
REGARDING THE ECONOMY AND 
TESTING AND VACCINES. SO THAT'S 

00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:35.819
GOING TO BE A PART OF A NORMAL 
HEARING. BUT THE REST OF IT IS 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.672
CERTAINLY NEW. AND CERTAINLY 
HISTORIC. RHONDA, WHAT ARE YOU 

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:44.632
GOING TO BE LISTENING FOR TODAY?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I'M GOING TO BE 

00:04:44.882 --> 00:04:47.438
LISTENING, HEARING MORE ABOUT 
TESTING. WE KNOW THAT WHEN DR. 

00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:53.068
FAUCI WAS HERE TWO MONTHS AGO, 
IN MARCH, IN FRONT OF A HOUSE 

00:04:53.328 --> 00:04:55.891
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, TESTING WAS
A BIG ISSUE THEN. AND THIS 

00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:59.178
COMMITTEE HAS SORT OF BEEN THE 
CENTERPOINT FOR DISCUSSIONS OF 

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:02.841
TESTING ON THE HILL. 
LAMAR ALEXANDER HAS PITCHED THE 

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:08.864
IDEA OF HAVING A SHARK TANK 
STYLE APPROACH TO GETTING MORE 

00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:12.317
TESTING HERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:15.304
HE'S HELD HEARINGSES WHERE TECH 
EXPERTS HAVE BEEN COMING TO 

00:05:15.534 --> 00:05:18.547
PROPOSE IDEAS THEY HAVE TO RAMP 
UP TESTING. IT'S BEEN A KEY 

00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:21.334
ISSUE. HE SAID IT'S CRUCIAL TO 
STARTING THE ECONOMY AGAIN. IT'S

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:24.081
CRUCIAL TO GETTING PEOPLE 
COMFORTABLE, GOING INTO THEIR 

00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:28.414
JOBS AGAIN. AND FOR SCHOOLS TO 
OPEN UP. SO HE WILL LIKELY 

00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:32.498
DEFINITELY FOCUS ON TESTING. AND
SENATOR MURRAY HAS BEEN TALKING 

00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:35.235
ABOUT TESTING IN THIS COMMITTEE,
WAY BACK IN MARCH. AND SHE'S 

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:38.208
FROM WASHINGTON STATE, WHICH WE 
KNOW IS ONE OF THE EARLY, 

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:41.255
HARD-HIT STATES. SO SHE 
DEFINITELY IS ALSO GOING TO BE 

00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:44.329
FOCUSING ON TESTING. I THINK 
THAT'S GOING TO BE KEY HERE. OF 

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:46.825
COURSE WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
YESTERDAY SAYING THAT WHEN IT 

00:05:48.512 --> 00:05:51.339
COMES TO TESTING, WE'VE 
PREVAILED. BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY 

00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:55.463
GOING TO HEAR MORE TO THAT. 
&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED THE TWO TOP 

00:05:55.713 --> 00:05:58.749
MEMBERS. THIS IS A 
REPUBLICAN-LED COMMITTEE. AND 

00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:02.423
DR. FAUCI AT FIRST DIDN'T WANT 
TO TESTIFY. OR RATHER, THE WHITE

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:05.797
HOUSE WAS NOT GOING TO LET HIM 
TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE. HE IS 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.963
APPEARING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.
WHAT DYNAMICS WILL YOU BE 

00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:11.357
WATCHING FOR? 
&gt;&gt; YEAH. THIS ISN'T A COMMITTEE 

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.656
THAT WE HAVE TYPICALLY COVERED. 
BUT IT IS A PRETTY NOTABLE 

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.581
COMMITTEE. AND HISTORICALLY, 
USUALLY HAVE BIG NAMES ON IT. 

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:20.734
HILLARY CLINTON SERVED ON THIS 
COMMITTEE, BARACK OBAMA SERVED 

00:06:20.974 --> 00:06:24.937
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND JOHN 
McCAIN. MITT ROMNEY ON THE 

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:28.691
REPUBLICAN SIDE, RAND PAUL, 
BERNIE SANDERS IS ON THIS 

00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.941
COMMITTEE, YOU'RE DEFINITELY 
GOING TO SEE SOME HOUSEHOLD 

00:06:31.102 --> 00:06:33.102
NAMES TODAY. AND A LOT OF THEM 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:24.088
&gt;&gt; THE COMMITTEE IS CHAIRED BY 
LAMAR ALEXANDER. A RETIRED 

00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:29.457
SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE. HE'S 
APPEARING REMOTELY. BECAUSE HE 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.444
SELF-QUARANTINED. BECAUSE THE 
STAFF GOT IT. TENANT USUALLY 

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:36.438
GETS FIRST DIBS ON HIGH-PROFILE 
HEARINGS LIKE THIS. IT'S 

00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:38.698
ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THIS CASE. 
BECAUSE 

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:45.085
THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T WANT 
WITNESSES APPEARING BEFORE 

00:07:45.335 --> 00:07:49.122
DEMOCRATS. THE TRUMP TEAM CAN 
EXERT A LOT MORE CONTROL OVER 

00:07:49.422 --> 00:07:53.072
THE GROUND RULES FOR HOW LONG 
PEOPLE CAN ASK WHETHER THEY CAN 

00:07:53.322 --> 00:07:55.322
HAVE FOLLOW-UP 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.122
ROUNDS OF QUESTIONING. SO THE 
SENATE PROVED MUCH MORE AMENABLE

00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:05.256
THAN THE HOUSE COMMITTEES. WHICH
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT FORGOTTEN,

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:08.180
IMPEACHED HIM LAST YEAR. AND THE
REASON WE'RE HEARING FROM THIS 

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.076
MIX OF WITNESSES. THESE ARE THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY MOST 

00:08:11.326 --> 00:08:14.000
INVOLVED WITH THE EFFORT. BUT 
THEY'RE ALSO IN KIND OF 

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.004
APPOINTED POSITIONS. SO WE'RE 
NOT HEARING FROM DEBORAH BIRX 

00:08:18.254 --> 00:08:21.130
TODAY.  BECAUSE SHE'S NOT IN 
KIND OF AN OFFICIAL ROLE. SHE'S 

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.024
BEEN APPOINTED AS THE LEADER OF 
THE TASK FORCE. BUT THE HEAD. 

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.488
CDC, THE HEAD OF THE FDA AND 
THEN TONY FAUCI, WHO HAS BEEN AT

00:08:30.798 --> 00:08:35.767
HIS JOB SINCE 1984, A 
NONPARTISAN, NONPOLITICAL JOB. 

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:39.422
BUT HE, ALL THREE ARE IN KIND OF
OFFICIAL APPOINTMENTS. 

00:08:39.672 --> 00:08:43.625
SO IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR CONGRESS
TO SUMMON THEM. 

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:47.431
CONGRESS CONTROLS THE BUDGETS 
FOR ALL THREE AGENCIES. SO ALL 

00:08:48.121 --> 00:08:53.289
THREE OF THESE GENTLEMEN, PLUS 
THE TESTING SIDE, WHICH IS KIND 

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:57.465
OF THE BIG QUESTION THAT 
REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD AS WELL AS 

00:08:57.725 --> 00:08:59.879
DEMOCRATS. 
SO THAT'S SORT OF HOW WE ENDED 

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:06.062
UP WITH SORT OF THE MIX OF THOSE
FOUR. 

00:09:06.063 --> 00:09:08.063
&gt;&gt; YASMEEN. 

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:12.812
HEARINGS ARE POLITICS. 

00:09:15.357 --> 00:09:19.090
WHAT WILL YOU BE LISTENING FOR 
IN TERMS OF STANCE TODAY. AND 

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.766
THE COMMITTEE TRYING TO GET 
ANSWERS FROM THESE WITNESSES? 

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:25.737
&gt;&gt; I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ESPECIALLY ARE EAGER TO HEAR 

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:30.224
FROM DR. FAUCI, WHO YOU KNOW, IS
KNOWN TO NOT HOLD PUNCHES, TO BE

00:09:30.914 --> 00:09:34.097
HONEST. HE'S BEEN PUBLICLY 
CRITICAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:36.907
RESPONSE BEFORE. WHICH SOMETIMES
HAS PUT HIM IN HOT WATER. YOU 

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:43.174
KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SORT
OF VITRIOLE TOWARDS HIM. FOR HIS

00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:47.078
BEING CONTRADICTORY AT? POINT. I
THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE GOING

00:09:47.328 --> 00:09:52.182
TO BE LOOK FOR A FAIR ASSESSMENT
FROM HIM AS FAR AS HOW THINGS 

00:09:52.462 --> 00:09:55.751
ARE GOING. I THINK YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THERE ARE GOING TO BE A

00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:58.446
LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT TESTING. 
THE PRESIDENT AND SEVERAL 

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:01.319
MEMBERS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION 
YESTERDAY, HELD A NEWS 

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:04.595
CONFERENCE, WHERE NAY SORT OF 
HERALDED HOW FAR THE U.S. IS 

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:08.070
COMING ON TESTING. 
THEY PUT UP A BUNCH OF CHARTS 

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.403
AND METRICS. TRYING TO SHOW HOW 
GREAT THE U.S. DOING ON TESTING.

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:14.659
BECAUSE FROM THE BEGINNING, IT 
HAS BEEN A STORYLINE THAT HAS 

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:18.353
BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND CLOUDED THEIR

00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:22.056
RESPONSE. AND I THINK THERE IS 
NO DOUBT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:10:22.316 --> 00:10:25.763
HAS GREATLY IMPROVED THEIR 
TESTING CAPACITY. BUT I THINK 

00:10:26.113 --> 00:10:28.897
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THEY ARE 
BEHIND THE CURVE. 

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:32.063
AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE U.S. 
BEING ABLE TO TEST ABOUT 300,000

00:10:32.313 --> 00:10:35.346
PEOPLE A DAY. WHETHER THAT'S 
ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO 

00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:38.933
WORK. THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS, 
IT'S NOT. I THINK THERE WILL BE 

00:10:39.193 --> 00:10:41.996
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW, IF THE
WHITE HOUSE IS HAVING CASES WITH

00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:47.049
ALL THE PRECAUTIONS THAR TAKING,
THE TESTS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. 

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:50.402
AND MEMBERS STILL NEED TO 
ISOLATE. AND THERE ARE STILL 

00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:54.940
CASES POPPING UP. TRUMP'S 
PERSONAL VALET ALSO TESTED 

00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:57.813
POSITIVE. THEN WHY SHOULD 
AMERICANS FEEL SAFE GOING BACK 

00:10:58.073 --> 00:11:00.630
TO WORK? 
AND DR. FAUCI'S COMMENTS. I 

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.603
THINK THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS AS
TO WHETHER SOME ARE REOPENING 

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:07.509
TOO QUICKLY. AND WHETHER THE 
COUNTRY ISN'T READY TO REOPEN. 

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:11.243
AND I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE PLAN

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:15.046
IS. IF WE SEE A SURGE IN CASES 
IN THE AREA. WHAT'S THE ROLE OF 

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:17.982
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? WHAT'S 
THE ROLE OF THE WHITE HOUSE? ARE

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:21.065
THEY DOING ANYTHING TO PREPARE 
FOR ANOTHER WAVE OF CASES IN THE

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:24.959
FALL. OR EVEN THE SUMMER, WITH 
SOME OF THESE STATES PREMATURELY

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:28.943
OPEN. I'M SURE THERE WILL BE 
POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING. 

00:11:29.193 --> 00:11:31.650
DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T HELD BACK. BUT
I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE 

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.683
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE OF
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE FEDERAL 

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:38.442
GOVERNMENT IS MOVING FORWARD ON 
THE REOPENING, HOW YOU DO IT. 

00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:41.925
THERE'S STILL NOT A TON OF 
CLARITY ON WHAT THE PLAN IS AND 

00:11:42.195 --> 00:11:46.299
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO RAPIDLY RAMP
UP TESTING CAPACITY TO GET 

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.322
PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. I THINK ALL
OF THOSE WILL ARISE, LIKE YOU 

00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:56.372
SEE. 
&gt;&gt; JAMES, YOUR DAILY 220 HAS 

00:11:56.622 --> 00:12:02.711
THIS HEADLINES. THE GOVERNORS  
WHO RAISED TO RELAX SOCIAL 

00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:05.846
GUIDELINES RESTRICTIONS ARE 
PAYING A NEW TOLL. 

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:08.096
THIS WHOLE HEARING 

00:12:10.372 --> 00:12:13.146
IS ABOUT REOPENING. AND THERE'S 
SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE 

00:12:13.396 --> 00:12:17.369
FEDERAL GUIDELINES JUST DON'T 
MATCH UP TO WHAT SOME GOVERNORS,

00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:20.009
ESPECIALLY REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS,
ARE CHOOSING TO DO. WHERE DO THE

00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:24.409
SENATORS FALL IN? TO HOW QUICKLY
THEIR GOVERNOR SHOULD DECIDE TO 

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:28.042
BE MOVING FORWARD? 
&gt;&gt; YEAH, LIBBY. OUR NEW POLL. WE

00:12:28.302 --> 00:12:32.279
HAVE BEEN DOING WEEKLY POLLING. 
AND THIS ONE IS A LARGE NATIONAL

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:34.726
POLL. AND IT SHOWS 
OVERWHELMINGLY, AMERICANS STILL 

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:38.529
THINK IT'S TOO SOON TO EASE A 
LOT OF THESE RESTRICTIONS. 

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:43.089
AND THE PARTISAN BREAKSTEP DOWN 
IS ALMOST EXACTLY EVEN. LIKE 

00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:46.485
50%NESS THE TOP PRIORITY SHOULD 
BE PUBLIC HEALTH, EVEN IF THAT 

00:12:46.735 --> 00:12:50.101
MEANS MORE CLOSURES. AND 49% 
BELIEVE THAT THE PRIORITY SHOULD

00:12:50.515 --> 00:12:52.715
BE REOPENING BUSINESSES. 
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT WHERE YOU 

00:12:53.142 --> 00:12:55.558
SEE THE BREAKDOWN IN THE 
REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE ON THE 

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:59.701
SENATE SIDE. I THINK SOMEONE 
LIKE LAMAR ALEXANDER IS GOING TO

00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.029
AIR MORE ON THE SIDE OF PUBLIC 
HEALTH. 

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:06.652
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOME SENATORS 
WHO I THINK ARE MUCH MORE KIND 

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:09.685
OF RARING TO GO. 
I THINK YOU SEE THAT EVEN MORE 

00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:13.142
AMONG CONSERVATIVES ON THE HOUSE
SIDE THAN THE SENATE SIDE. SO 

00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:17.142
THERE IS DEFINITELY MORE TENSION
IN OUR POLL, MORE THAN 90% OF 

00:13:17.392 --> 00:13:20.808
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE 
CLOSURES SHOULD CONTINUE. 

00:13:21.148 --> 00:13:25.062
AND THE PARTY HAS BEEN PRETTY 
UNITED ON THAT. BUT FOR THE MOST

00:13:25.748 --> 00:13:29.761
PART, AMERICANS, OUR POLLING 
SHOWS ARE FOLLOWING THE CUES OF 

00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:32.479
ANTHONY FAUCI. NATIONAL POLL 
LAST WEEK SHOWED THAT HIS 

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:36.892
FAVORABILITY RATING WAS OVER 70%
NATIONALLY. AND PEOPLE TRUST 

00:13:37.929 --> 00:13:41.005
PEOPLE LIKE TONY FAUCI FAR MORE 
THAN DONALD TRUMP WHEN IT COMES 

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.255
TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I THINK 

00:13:58.268 --> 00:14:01.551
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT HAS IGNORED SOME OF 

00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.809
THOSE GUIDELINES. I THINK FAUCI 
HAS BEEN WILLING TO SAY THINGS 

00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:08.072
THAT PUT HIM AT ODDS WITH THE 
ADMINISTRATION. ESPECIALLY EARLY

00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:12.121
ON, HE GAVE INTERVIEWS THAT 
ANNOYED PEOPLE IN THE WHITE 

00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:15.592
HOUSE. BUT HE'S ALSO DIPLOMATIC.
THAT'S HOW HE'S BEEN SINCE 1984.

00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:22.475
AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE HIM AS 
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL, EVEN 

00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:26.819
BEING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. 
EVEN IF HE KNOWS THE PRESIDENT 

00:14:27.078 --> 00:14:30.631
DOESN'T AGREE. 
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS DR. 

00:14:30.874 --> 00:14:35.735
ANTHONY FAUCI PUSHING BACK. AND 
BEING POLITICALLY SAVVY. THIS 

00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:39.088
WAS OVER A MONTH AGO, EASTER 
WEEKEND. AND THE COMMENTS THAT 

00:14:39.348 --> 00:14:42.946
HE MADE, GOT A LOT OF PUSHBACK 
FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS. 

00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:48.204
IN FACT, MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS 
CALLED FOR A "FIRE FAUCI" 

00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:53.958
CAMPAIGN. 
TRUMP HIMSELF EVEN RETWEETED 

00:14:54.214 --> 00:14:58.287
FIRE FAUCI. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT
DR. FAUCI SAID. 

00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:00.774
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY YOU, COULD 
LOGICALLY SAY, IF YOU HAD A 

00:15:01.044 --> 00:15:03.371
PROCESS THAT WAS ONGOING. AND 
YOU STARTED MITIGATION EARLIER, 

00:15:03.631 --> 00:15:06.705
YOU COULD HAVE SAVED LIVES. 
OBVIOUSLY NO ONE IS GOING TO 

00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:09.888
DENY.  THAT BUT WHAT GOES INTO 
THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS IS 

00:15:10.148 --> 00:15:12.675
COMPLICATED. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. 
OBVIOUSLY, IF WE HAD, RIGHT FROM

00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:15.111
THE VERY BEGINNING, SHUT 
EVERYTHING DOWN, IT MAY HAVE 

00:15:15.371 --> 00:15:18.045
BEEN A LITTLE DIFFERENT. BUT 
THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHBACK 

00:15:18.525 --> 00:15:20.410
ABOUT SHUTTING THINGS DOWN BACK 
THEN. 

00:15:20.411 --> 00:15:23.968
&gt;&gt; NOW, JUST ONE DAY LATER, 
FAUCI ATTEMPTED TO RETRACT OR AT

00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:28.537
LEAST CLARIFY HIS REMARKS. THIS 
WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:30.056
CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING. LET'S 
LISTEN. 

00:15:30.057 --> 00:15:36.437
&gt;&gt; I HAD AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY 
THAT I WAS ASKED A HYPOTHETICAL 

00:15:36.687 --> 00:15:38.764
QUESTION. 
AND HYPE THET CAL QUESTIONS 

00:15:39.014 --> 00:15:41.014
SOMETIMES CAN GET YOU INTO SOME 
DIFFICULTY. 

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.150
BECAUSE WHAT WOULD HAVE OR COULD
HAVE. 

00:15:43.294 --> 00:15:47.688
THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME THAT DR.
BIRX AND I WENT IN AND FORMALLY 

00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:54.287
MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE 
PRESIDENT TO ACTUALLY HAVE A, 

00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:57.324
QUOTE, SHUTDOWN IN THE SENSE OF 
NOT REALLY SHUTDOWN. BUT TO 

00:15:57.584 --> 00:16:01.562
REALLY HAVE STRONG MITIGATION. 
WE DISCUSSED IT. OBVIOUSLY THERE

00:16:02.397 --> 00:16:06.400
WOULD BE CONCERN BY SOME THAT, 
IN FACT, THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME 

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.650
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. 
NONETHELESS. 

00:16:08.817 --> 00:16:10.863
THE PRESIDENT LISTENED TO THE 
RECOMMENDATION. 

00:16:11.113 --> 00:16:20.697
AND WENT TO THE MITIGATION. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FAUCI, JUST ONE MONTH 

00:16:20.953 --> 00:16:28.083
AGO. LET'S GO TO YASMEEN. WHY 
WAS THERE A REAL PUSH BACK FROM 

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:31.651
TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS. DR. FAUCI IS
JUST TALKING ABOUT THE TIME LINE

00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:34.367
AND SAVING LIVES AND LOOKING 
BACK AT WHEN DECISIONS WERE 

00:16:34.637 --> 00:16:36.637
MADE. WHY WAS THAT SO TOUCHY? 

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:53.266
&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS PRESIDENT IS 
VERY SENSE TIVE. THERE WAS 

00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:59.069
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CRITICISM 
DOWNPLAYING THE VIRUS, PRESIDENT

00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:03.819
PRESIDENT XI FOR HIS RESPONSE, 
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW OFFICIALS 

00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:07.516
WERE WARNING HIM AT THE TIME TO 
TAKE A TOUGHER LINE IN WARNING 

00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:13.542
HOW SEVERE 

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:18.870
IT WAS. 
&gt;&gt; REGULARLY POINTS TO. 

00:17:23.413 --> 00:17:27.766
&gt;&gt; SIGNAL THAT HE WAS POINTING 
THIS SERIOUSLY. I THINK THE 

00:17:28.016 --> 00:17:33.179
PUBLIC SPEAKS FOR THEMSELVES. 
I THINK THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO 

00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:37.132
ANY INFORMATION THEY DIDN'T TAKE
SERIOUSLY. SO DR. FAUCI 

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:41.229
COMMENTS, WHILE MAY BE TO 
SOMEONE ELSE. 

00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:49.332
I THINK SO THE PRESIDENT AND 
MANY SUPPORTERS TOOK THAT AS A 

00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:51.898
DIRECT CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. AND IS THIS THAT HE 

00:17:52.248 --> 00:17:57.378
DIDN'T ACT QUICK ENOUGH. 
THAT HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO 

00:17:57.638 --> 00:18:00.005
RECOMMENDATIONS OF SOCIAL 
DISTANCING. 

00:18:00.255 --> 00:18:05.815
WHICH IS WHY THEY CAME TO THE 
PRESS BRIEFING EVERY DAY. 

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.732
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE HAD CONCERNS. 

00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:16.388
AND YOU'VE SEEN HIM DO THAT ON 
SOME OFFICIALS WHO ARE NOT 

00:18:16.648 --> 00:18:19.832
STAYING ON THE MESSAGE HE WANTED
THEM TO STAY ON. 

00:18:20.112 --> 00:18:22.988
YOU HEARD THAT WHEN THEY SAID, 
THE OUTBREAK IN THE FALL COULD 

00:18:23.248 --> 00:18:26.581
BE MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT WE'RE 
EXPERIENCING NOW. HE WAS TROTTED

00:18:26.828 --> 00:18:32.808
OUT TO THE NEXT BRIEFING THE 
NEXT DAY. AND HAD HAD TO 

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:36.984
CLARIFY. WHEN YOU SEE THIS, THEY
ARE OFTEN TRYING TO SPEAK TO THE

00:18:37.234 --> 00:18:40.927
PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS. 
SAYING, WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS 

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:43.544
DIFFERENTLY OR MAYBE THIS COULD 
HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER. 

00:18:43.804 --> 00:18:48.204
THIS IS NOT AN ADMINISTRATION 
THAT TAKES KINDLY TO THAT. WE 

00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:51.818
KNOW AND IT'S BEEN REPORTED 
SEVERAL TIMES, THERE IS HAS BEEN

00:18:52.078 --> 00:18:58.381
A HUGE MESSAGE ON PUBLIC 
RELATIONS, CRISIS RESPONSE IN 

00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:00.783
THIS PANDEMIC AND THE CRISIS 
RESPONSE. 

00:19:00.784 --> 00:19:07.304
&gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD YOU CAUGHT UP 
WITH DR. REDFIELD. WE'LL HEAR 

00:19:08.664 --> 00:19:11.467
NOT ONLY FROM DR. FAUCI. 

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.600
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT 

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.003
TESTING AGENCIES. THE CDC HASN'T
HELD A BRIEFING SINCE MARCH 9th.

00:19:32.253 --> 00:19:36.840
I THINK THERE AM BE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHETHER THE CDC HAS BEEN 

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.414
MUZZLED. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO 
GET INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE 

00:19:39.664 --> 00:19:42.547
WHO NEED IT NOW. STATES AND 
INDIVIDUALS ARE LOOKING FOR 

00:19:42.847 --> 00:19:45.924
GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW TO REOPEN, 
WHEN IT'S SAFE TO START GOING 

00:19:46.214 --> 00:19:48.967
OUT. WHEN CAN PEOPLE START 
RESUMING A BIT MORE OF THEIR 

00:19:49.237 --> 00:19:51.803
NORMAL LIVES. WHAT DOES THE NEW 
NORMALITY LOOK LIKE? I THINK 

00:19:52.213 --> 00:19:55.280
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT. I THINK FOR DR. 

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.907
HAHN, THE FTA COMMISSIONER, 
YOU'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF MEMBERS 

00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:02.956
OF CONGRESS PUT OUT STATEMENTS 
AND WARNINGS AND CRITICISMS OF 

00:20:04.006 --> 00:20:07.110
HOW THE FDA HAS HANDLED THESE 
ANTIBODY TESTS, WHICH 

00:20:29.752 --> 00:20:34.825
IT'S NOT JUST DR. FAUCI. THERE 
ARE A NUMBER OF HEALTH CONCERNS 

00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:40.798
THAT I THINK MEMBERS ARE GOING 
TO MOVE FORWARD TO. 

00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:44.011
WE HAVE NOT REALLY HAD A DECLINE
IN CASES. 

00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:48.614
I THINK THERE ARE QUESTION ABOUT
MEDICAL COUNT MEASURES, HOW TO 

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:51.721
MOVE FORWARD, WHAT IS SAFE, WHAT
IS NOT. AND THESE OFFICIALS ARE 

00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:55.254
EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THAT. 
&gt;&gt; JAMES IF YOU WERE ON THIS 

00:20:55.524 --> 00:21:00.688
COMMITTEE HEARING, WHAT WOULD 
YOU BE ASKING OF THESE 

00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:05.826
TESTIFYING? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT YASMEEN 

00:21:05.827 --> 00:21:08.631
REPORTED. 
IT IDENTIFIED AREAS WE'RE SEEING

00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:13.084
SPIKES. AND SOME OF THOSE AREAS 
ARE INSTATES THAT THESE SENATORS

00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:18.270
REPRESENT. IF YOU TAKE THE NEW 
YORK NUMBERS OUT OF THE, KIND OF

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.953
THE NATIONAL FIGURES, WE'RE 
SEEING INCREASES IN A LOT OF 

00:21:22.283 --> 00:21:25.267
PLACES. MY HOME STATE OF 
MINNESOTA HAS SEEN A BIG 

00:21:25.997 --> 00:21:29.260
INCREASE WEEK OVER WEEK. 
SO I THINK THE SENATORS FROM 

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.806
SOME OF THOSE PLACES ARE GOING 
TO BE VERY KEYED IN ON WHAT 

00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:35.880
THEIR GOVERNOR SHOULD BE DOING. 
I DO THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME POINT

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.766
SCORING. BUT I THINK THAT 
DEMOCRATS WILL TRY HARD NOT TO 

00:21:39.026 --> 00:21:42.859
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE JUST SCORING 
POINTS FOR THE SAKE OF SCORING 

00:21:43.129 --> 00:21:45.129
POINTS. BECAUSE SOMEONE LIKE 
DOCTORS AND MEDICAL 

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:49.939
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE HELD IN 
HIGH REGARD. 

00:21:50.189 --> 00:21:53.112
THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AS 
WE THINK OF THEM. 

00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:56.645
SO THAT, I THINK, WILL MAKE THE 
TONE A LOT MORE RESPECTFUL. 

00:21:56.895 --> 00:22:00.302
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS A SENATOR, I 
WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THE BIG 

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:02.552
INDUSTRIES 

00:22:04.158 --> 00:22:08.238
IN MY STATE. IS THIS IS THE 

00:22:13.272 --> 00:22:18.231
BIGGEST HEALTH CRISIS
CRISIS SINCE 1983. 

00:22:18.487 --> 00:22:20.487
WHITE-COLLARED PROFESSIONALS ARE
GETTING HAMMERED. WE HAVE A 

00:22:20.568 --> 00:22:24.721
STORY ON THE TOLLIT'S TAKING ON 
FARMERS. THERE ARE A LOT OF 

00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:28.308
PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT HEAVILY 
RURAL AGRICULTURAL STATES. 

00:22:28.558 --> 00:22:34.967
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT TRYING TO -- THEIR STATES.

00:22:35.237 --> 00:22:39.327
I THINK YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THAT
LOCALISM AND PAROCHIALISM IN 

00:22:39.577 --> 00:22:41.584
SOME WAYS. 
&gt;&gt; THIS HEARING IS SCHEDULED TO 

00:22:41.854 --> 00:22:46.407
GET UNDER WAY IN 10 MINUTES. 
WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU LIVE AND

00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:49.723
UNINTERRUPTED. 
OUR COLLEAGUE RHONDA COLVIN IS 

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:54.473
ON CAPITOL HILL. AND RHONDA, I'D
LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU HOW 

00:22:55.413 --> 00:22:59.666
DIFFERENT THIS MOMENT AND HOW 
THIS NEW NORMAL IT IMPACTING 

00:22:59.973 --> 00:23:02.269
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND FEELING 
ON THE HILL. 

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.766
&gt;&gt; I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS FAR
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I'VE 

00:23:06.163 --> 00:23:08.932
EXPERIENCED ON THE HILL. 
I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT THIS 

00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:12.898
QUIET. 
I'M IN THE RUSSELL ROTUNDA. 

00:23:13.163 --> 00:23:17.019
USUALLY A LOT OF MEDIA. WE STAND
HERE. WE GIVE LIVE REPORTS. WE 

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:20.202
DO INTERVIEWS WITH MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS. AND NONE OF THAT IS 

00:23:20.472 --> 00:23:23.519
REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IT'S
REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE. WHEN 

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:27.372
WE WERE LAST HERE. MOST OF WHAT 
WE WERE COVERING WAS THE 

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:29.762
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. IT WAS 
CERTAINLY SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. 

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:35.252
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN THIS 
MORNING. JUST A HANDFUL OF 

00:23:35.882 --> 00:23:38.681
STAFFERS ARE WALKING THROUGH THE
HALLWAY. I'M HEARING MY VOICE 

00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:41.975
ECHO AT TIMES WHEN I'M SPEAKING 
TO YOU. BECAUSE IT'S THAT QUIET 

00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:45.988
HERE. THAT IS PART OF A NEW 
NORMAL. I THINK THE HILL IS 

00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:48.265
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE ITSELF 
OUT. 

00:23:48.371 --> 00:23:51.604
THIS HAS NOT ALLOWED THE HOUSE 
TO COME BACK. HE HAS NOT GIVEN 

00:23:51.854 --> 00:23:56.427
THEM THE GO AHEAD THAT HE CAN 
RETURN BACK TO D.C. SO THAT ALSO

00:23:56.677 --> 00:23:59.444
HAS REDUCED FOOT TRAFFIC ON THE 
HILL. THEY MAY BE RETURNING 

00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:02.517
FRIDAY. BUT THINGS ARE A LITTLE 
UP IN THE AIR. IT'S INTERESTING 

00:24:02.767 --> 00:24:06.011
THAT SUCH A HIGH-PROFILE 
HEARING, SUCH AN HISTORIC 

00:24:06.271 --> 00:24:09.767
HEARING, IS TAKING PLACE DURING 
THIS TIME WHEN A LOT OF US AT 

00:24:10.017 --> 00:24:13.820
MEDIA ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
THE BEST WAY TO COVER IT, WITH 

00:24:14.401 --> 00:24:16.993
KEEPING SAFETY IN MIND. IT'S 
CERTAINLY A VERY, VERY DIFFERENT

00:24:17.243 --> 00:24:19.520
DYNAMIC THAN WHAT WE'VE 
EXPERIENCED BEFORE ON THE HILL. 

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.830
&gt;&gt; THANKS SO MUCH, RHONDA. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO YASMEEN RIGHT 

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.683
NOW. YOU BROUGHT UP AN IMPORTANT
POINT. OF HOW THE INDIVIDUALS 

00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:32.100
TESTIFYING TODAY ARE VIEWED. ARE
THEY POLITICAL IN NATURE? 

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.753
DR. FAUCI HAS SERVED IN THIS 
POSITION FOR DECADES. 

00:24:36.023 --> 00:24:38.716
THROUGH ADMINISTRATIONS OF BOTH 
POLITICAL STRIPES. SO I'M 

00:24:38.976 --> 00:24:42.203
WONDERING IF ONE OF THE GOALS 
DEMOCRATS HAVE IS TO TRY TO SHOW

00:24:42.453 --> 00:24:45.096
DAYLIGHT, BETWEEN WHAT THESE 
EXPERTS BELIEVE AND WHAT THE 

00:24:45.356 --> 00:24:47.655
ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING OR WHAT
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IS SAYING.

00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:50.926
SO IF THEY CAN SHOW A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A RECOMMENDATION FROM 

00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:55.029
THE HEAD OF THE CDC OR FROM DR. 
FAUCI AND SHOW THAT IT CONTRASTS

00:24:56.105 --> 00:25:00.372
OR IS, YOU KNOW, CONTRADICTORY 
FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE 

00:25:00.642 --> 00:25:03.965
PRESIDENT'S OWN MOUTH? IS THAT A
WAY THEY CAN KIND OF TRY TO MOVE

00:25:04.215 --> 00:25:06.512
THEIR ARGUMENTS FORWARD? 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD 

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:11.001
POINT. I THINK THESE ARE 
DOCTORS, PUBLIC HEALTHCARE 

00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:13.948
PROFESSIONALS AM. THEY'RE THE 
PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS, TRYING TO

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:17.604
ADVISE THE TASK FORCE. OBVIOUSLY
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS. 

00:25:17.854 --> 00:25:20.348
A LOT OF IT IS POLITICAL. WE 
KNOW 

00:25:20.614 --> 00:25:23.504
IT'S FOCUSED ON THE ELECTION AND
WANTING TO PAINT THE 

00:25:23.774 --> 00:25:26.891
ADMINISTRATION IN THE BEST 
POSSIBLE LIGHT. I THINK A LOT OF

00:25:27.257 --> 00:25:30.214
MEMBERS TODAY ARE GOING TO LOOK 
FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH 

00:25:30.464 --> 00:25:33.420
PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THE COUNTRY 
IS DOING. HOW SAFE OR NOT SAFE 

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.350
IT IS TO GET BACK TO WORK AND 
REOPEN. AND GIVEN WHAT THE DATA 

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.537
CLEARLY SHOWS, LIKE JAMES 
MENTIONED. YOU KNOW, SPIKES IN 

00:25:40.787 --> 00:25:42.779
SOME CASES, BEGINNING TO SHOW 
UP. 

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.497
YOU KNOW, THIS PLATEAU. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 

00:25:46.757 --> 00:25:50.240
FLATTENING THE THE CURVE. 
THE HEALTH SYSTEM GOT 

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.456
OVERWHELMED TO THE POINT THAT A 
LOT OF PEOPLE FEARED IT WOULD. 

00:25:53.716 --> 00:25:56.253
YOU DIDN'T HAVE SOME PEOPLE 
DYING IN THE STREETS. AND I 

00:25:56.503 --> 00:25:59.070
THINK SOME MEMBERS OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION POINT THAT THAT 

00:25:59.326 --> 00:26:02.549
AS EVIDENCE THAT SOCIAL 
DISTANCING AND STRINGENT 

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:05.366
MITIGATION EFFORTS WORKED. BUT I
THINK THERE WERE QUESTIONS THAT 

00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:09.983
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DOWN FLOW, 
WHERE YOU SEE THE CASES START TO

00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:13.412
GO DOWN. WHETHER WE ARE READY TO
REOPEN. OR WHETHER THE KRIESHZ 

00:26:13.682 --> 00:26:17.385
IS GOING TO BE SORT OF ENDEMIC 
IN THE U.S. AND WHAT YOU DO AND 

00:26:17.666 --> 00:26:20.479
HOW YOU DEAL WITH THAT. UNTIL 
THERE IS A VACCINE THAT IS 

00:26:20.729 --> 00:26:23.195
WIDELY AVAILABLE. I THINK 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK TO SEE. 

00:26:23.434 --> 00:26:26.508
THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE SORT OF 
A BLUNT AND HONEST PUBLIC HEALTH

00:26:26.768 --> 00:26:28.815
ASSESSMENT. EVEN IF IT'S NOT 
NECESSARILY WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

00:26:29.095 --> 00:26:31.422
AND SOME OF HIS POLITICAL 
ADVISERS WOULD LIKE. THEY SAY 

00:26:31.692 --> 00:26:34.956
THEY WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY 
ROARING BACK. BUT I THINK A LOT 

00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:37.206
OF EXPERTS HAVE SAID, 

00:26:47.614 --> 00:26:53.821
I THINK SOME MEMBERS WILL PRESS 
THE ADMINISTRATION THEY WILLING 

00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:58.264
TO SAY THAT HONESTLY. AND EVEN 
IF IT'S NOT WHAT THE POLITICAL 

00:26:58.554 --> 00:27:01.801
ADVISERS HAVE HERE. 
&gt;&gt; THE HEAD OF THIS COMMITTEE 

00:27:02.151 --> 00:27:09.884
WILL BE JOINING REMOTELY. HE 
SPOKE TO CHUCK TODD. AND HE 

00:27:10.144 --> 00:27:15.213
FOCUSED ON THE COST THIS IS ALL 
TAKING. BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT 

00:27:15.473 --> 00:27:18.359
SOLUTION HE HAS IS TESTING AND 
CONTRACT TRACING. 

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.193
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO 
HELP EVERYBODY HURT WHEN YOU 

00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:28.743
SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. SO THE
ONLY SOLUTION IS TEST TREAT, 

00:27:28.991 --> 00:27:30.912
ISOLATE. 
TREATMENT AND VACCINES. WE HAVE 

00:27:30.913 --> 00:27:34.496
TO OPEN UP THE ECONOMY. HAVE TO 
DO IT CAREFULLY. AND HAVE TO LET

00:27:34.746 --> 00:27:37.989
PEOPLE EARN A LIVING. I DON'T 
SEE US BEING ABLE TO APPROPRIATE

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:40.239
MUCH MORE 

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:46.345
MONEY TO HELP TO HELP PROVIDE A 
COUNT TO THAT. 

00:27:46.346 --> 00:27:49.319
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE HEARING ROOM 
RIGHT THERE. 

00:27:49.649 --> 00:27:53.075
SUCH AN UNUSUAL APPEARANCE WITH 
HAND SANITIZER AND WIPES AND ALL

00:27:53.332 --> 00:27:57.068
THE SEATS SPREAD SO FAR APART. 
JUST REALLY REMARKABLE AND 

00:27:57.318 --> 00:28:00.405
TELLING ABOUT THIS MOMENT. 
PHOTOGRAPHERS, WEARING MASKS. 

00:28:00.665 --> 00:28:03.928
KEEPING THEIR DISTANCE. 
JAMES, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE POINT

00:28:04.188 --> 00:28:08.501
OF THIS HEARING IS REOPENING THE
ECONOMY. 

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:11.964
SO FOR SMNL LIKE LAMAR 
ALEXANDER, WHO YOU POINTED OUT, 

00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:14.848
CAN BE LOYAL TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION, BUT ALSO HAS 

00:28:15.108 --> 00:28:17.714
SOME INDEPENDENCE AND ABLE TO 
SPEAK OUT. YOU KNOW, WHAT SORT 

00:28:17.974 --> 00:28:20.981
OF ISSUES DO REPUBLICANS NEED TO
GET HERE TODAY, IN TERMS OF 

00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:23.176
SOLUTIONS AND NEXT STEPS 
FORWARD? 

00:28:23.177 --> 00:28:26.041
&gt;&gt; YEAH. I THINK THAT THAT'S 
KIND OF THE GETTING -- WHAT 

00:28:26.977 --> 00:28:30.234
YOU'LL SEE REPUBLICANS DO, YOU 
KNOW, I THINK DAYLIGHT IS WHAT 

00:28:30.654 --> 00:28:33.193
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO TRY TO 
ESTABLISH. AND I THINK 

00:28:33.489 --> 00:28:36.784
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TRY TO 
GET THESE KIND OF PUBLIC HEALTH 

00:28:37.064 --> 00:28:40.597
FOLKS TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO 
BALANCE THE TWO? YOU KNOW, THAT 

00:28:41.007 --> 00:28:44.433
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO. WHAT'S 
REALISTIC. WHICH IS SORT OF WHAT

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.776
WE JUST HEARD IN THAT CLIP? WHAT
CAN ACTUALLY BE ACHIEVED ON 

00:28:49.036 --> 00:28:52.823
TESTING? WHO IS GOING TO GET 
PRIORITY? WHAT IS ACTUALLY 

00:28:53.423 --> 00:28:56.116
ACHIEVABLE ON CONTRACT TRACING. 
AND KIND OF, THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:28:56.376 --> 00:28:59.099
VERY FOCUSED ON BALANCE. AND 
THAT IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES 

00:28:59.349 --> 00:29:02.406
THE PRESIDENT HAS. HE HAS 
ECONOMIC PEOPLE IN HIS ORBIT. A 

00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:05.253
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE VICE 
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, WHO ARE VERY

00:29:05.523 --> 00:29:08.336
STRONG ON THE SIDE OF REOPENING,
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PUBLIC 

00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:11.232
HEALTH FOLKS. AND THEY'RE FOCUS 
IS VERY MUCH ON THE PUBLIC 

00:29:11.492 --> 00:29:16.022
HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS. 
AND THEY'RE NOT AS WORRIED. I'VE

00:29:16.282 --> 00:29:19.649
HEARD WHITE HOUSE PEOPLE 
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CDC DIRECTOR,

00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:23.628
SELF QUARANTINING FOR 14 DAYS 
BECAUSE AS FAR AS THEY'RE 

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:28.312
CONCERNED AT A LOW RISK EXPOSURE
TO WHITE HOUSE STAFFER WHO 

00:29:28.652 --> 00:29:31.508
TESTED POSITIVE. SO THERE'S SORT
OF A FEELING IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:29:31.768 --> 00:29:34.781
THAT SOME OF THESE FOLKS ARE TOO
STRONG ON WORRYING ABOUT PUBLIC 

00:29:35.054 --> 00:29:37.388
HEALTH AND NOT WORRIED ENOUGH 
ABOUT THE ECONOMY. BUT FRANKLY, 

00:29:37.638 --> 00:29:41.871
THAT'S THEIR JOB. 
AND SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE 

00:29:42.128 --> 00:29:45.604
PRESENTS TRY TO LOOK AT WHERE DO
WE DRAW THE LINE? HOW DO WE 

00:29:45.894 --> 00:29:48.818
BALANCE IT? WHAT IS REALISTIC? 
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT IT'S

00:30:07.573 --> 00:30:12.620
ANY TIME SOON. I THINK YOU'LL 
HEAR A VERY CAUTIOUS TONE AS 

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.196
WELL. 
&gt;&gt; WE JUST SAW SOME OF THE 

00:30:17.463 --> 00:30:24.113
SENATORS GATHERED. 
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO SEE THIS PLAY

00:30:24.373 --> 00:30:26.373
OUT. 

00:30:32.629 --> 00:30:37.102
&gt;&gt; YASMEEN, WHAT IS THE LATEST 
ON SORT OF THE MASK POLICY AND 

00:30:37.362 --> 00:30:39.368
SAFETY POLICY IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 

00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:42.386
&gt;&gt; SO OUR COLLEAGUES ARE 
REPORTING YESTERDAY THAT 

00:30:42.642 --> 00:30:45.129
EVERYONE NEEDS TO WEAR A MASK. 
AT THE BRIEFING YESTERDAY, 

00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:48.245
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED IF HE 
WAS THE ONE WHO MANDATED THIS. 

00:30:48.505 --> 00:30:51.855
AND HE SAID HE WAS. BUT HE WAS 
NOT WEARING A MASK. AND OUR 

00:30:52.115 --> 00:30:54.365
COLLEAGUES REPORTED THAT THE 
POLICY WILL NOT NECESSARILY 

00:30:54.632 --> 00:30:58.095
APPLY TO HIM. WHEN THE PRESIDENT
WAS ASKED WHY HE IS NOT WEARING 

00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:02.265
A MASK. HE SAID NO ONE GETS 
CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIM AND HE'S FAR

00:31:02.525 --> 00:31:06.615
ENOUGH APART FROM EVERYONE SO HE
DOESN'T NEED ONE. 

00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:11.088
&gt;&gt; THERE THIS THERE IS A POLICY 
IN PUBLIC. WHEN VICE PRESIDENT 

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:14.661
MIKE PENCE. 
HE DIDN'T WEAR A MASK, EVEN 

00:31:15.058 --> 00:31:17.794
THOUGH HE WAS IN A HEALTHCARE 
FACILITY. 

00:31:18.054 --> 00:31:21.137
SO THIS GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC 
HAS BEEN OUT FOR A WHILE. 

00:31:21.407 --> 00:31:24.074
THAT EVERYONE WEAR FACE 
COVERINGS IN PUBLIC. BUT WE 

00:31:24.324 --> 00:31:27.680
HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT 
IMPLEMENTED BY MEMBERS OF THE 

00:31:27.681 --> 00:31:30.943
ADMINISTRATION. 
SEVERAL MEMBERS, CABINET 

00:31:31.203 --> 00:31:33.660
SECRETARIES, TOP OFFICIALS, YOU 
KNOW, WEARING MASKS AT THE 

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.233
BRIEFING. BUT THE PRESIDENT 
STILL HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO. I 

00:31:37.483 --> 00:31:40.320
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL CHANGE. 
BUT IT SORT OF UNDERCUTS THE 

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.823
MESSAGE AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
A LITTLE BIT, WHEN YOU DON'T SEE

00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:47.056
THAT THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY 
FOLLOWING THE ADVICE THEY'RE 

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:50.363
GIVING EVERY OTHER AMERICAN. 
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THERE, THE VIDEO 

00:31:50.613 --> 00:31:54.136
MONITOR AS NOT ONLY GUESTS BUT 
ALSO COMMUNITY MEMBERS JOIN IN 

00:31:54.396 --> 00:31:57.493
REMOTELY. WE'VE SEEN SENATOR 
COLLINS OF MAINE. OTHER SENATORS

00:31:57.753 --> 00:32:01.446
WE'VE SEEN INCLUDE TIM KAINE, 
DEMOCRAT OF VIRGINIA, WHO WAS 

00:32:01.706 --> 00:32:05.399
JUST TALKING A MOMENT AGO TO 
SENATOR BURKE, REPUBLICAN OF 

00:32:06.129 --> 00:32:08.129
NORTH CAROLINA. ALSO 

00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:13.635
SAW KELLY LAWFULLER, ALL OF 
THOSE MEMBERS APPEARING IN 

00:32:13.895 --> 00:32:23.798
PERSON, USING THE MASKS THAT 
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO YOU CAN SEE 

00:32:24.058 --> 00:32:26.145
DR. FAUCI THERE. 
SO THEY CAN TESTIFY REMOTELY. 

00:32:27.202 --> 00:32:32.074
JAMES, THERE'S SO MUCH OF A 
QUESTION OF JUST WHAT HAPPENS 

00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:34.438
NEXT. 
AND WHAT THE ROLE OF CONGRESS IS

00:32:34.728 --> 00:32:38.931
IN THIS MOMENT. 
YOU KNOW, WE HEARD IN THAT 

00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:42.534
ALEXANDER TAPE. RELUCTANCE BY 
THE CHAIRMAN TO KEEP SPENDING 

00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:46.647
MONEY. AND THERE ARE SO MANY 
PEOPLE HURTING RIGHT NOW. 

00:32:46.907 --> 00:32:50.234
BECAUSE JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST. OR 
BECAUSE THEY'RE REGULAR SOURCES 

00:32:50.495 --> 00:32:54.167
OF INCOME HAVE DRIED UP. 
SO HOW DO THESE SENATORS FACE 

00:32:54.427 --> 00:32:57.280
THAT QUESTION OF THE COST AND 
THE PAY FOR? 

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.354
&gt;&gt; YEAH. WELL, THAT'S -- YOU 
KNOW, FOR SOMEONE LIKE KELLY 

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.277
LAWFULLER WHO HAS A PRIMARY 
CHALLENGE IN GEORGIA, WAS 

00:33:05.537 --> 00:33:10.786
APPOINTED, HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE 
FOR SELLING STOCKS AFTER SHE GOT

00:33:11.046 --> 00:33:14.073
A BRIEFING ABOUT HOW BAD THIS 
WAS GOING TO BE, BEFORE THE 

00:33:14.333 --> 00:33:18.016
PUBLIC SORT OF REALIZED. IT'S A 
DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT. THEY 

00:33:18.266 --> 00:33:23.189
HAVE TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO 
MAKE SURE THEY SHOW EMPATHY. BUT

00:33:23.479 --> 00:33:27.349
ALSO MAKE CLEAR THERE'S NOT A 
BLANK CHECK. AND DEMOCRATS HAVE 

00:33:28.169 --> 00:33:31.226
TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT, TOO. 
YOU KNOW, THE NATIONAL DEBT WAS 

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:34.739
ALREADY OUT OF CONTROL BEFORE. 
AND YOU KNOW, NOW WE'RE TALKING 

00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:39.552
ABOUT MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS. 
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, CONTRACT 

00:33:39.822 --> 00:33:43.335
TRACING IN PARTICULAR IS 
ESPECIALLY EXPENSIVE. IT'S VERY 

00:33:43.905 --> 00:33:47.545
INVOLVED. IT'S VERY HUMAN 
INTENSIVE, EVEN WHEN YOU USE THE

00:33:48.345 --> 00:33:49.494
BEST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
TECHNOLOGY. 

00:33:49.495 --> 00:33:52.948
&gt;&gt; JAMES, I'M GOING TO CUT YOU 
OFF. WE'RE GETTING STARTED, 

00:33:53.208 --> 00:33:56.601
CHAIRMAN LAMAR ALEXANDER IS 
SPEAKING. LET'S GO TO THIS NOW. 

00:33:56.861 --> 00:34:00.865
&gt;&gt; INDIVIDUALS IN THE HEARING 
ROOM, ARE AT LEAST 6 FEET APART.

00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:06.984
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRESS ARE
WORKING AS A POOL TO RELAY 

00:34:07.294 --> 00:34:11.238
OBSERVATION TO COLLEAGUES. THE 
HEARING MAY BE WATCHED ONLINE. 

00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:14.084
AND AN UNEDITED RECORDING WILL 
BE AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S 

00:34:14.461 --> 00:34:16.461
WEBSITE. 

00:34:17.547 --> 00:34:21.521
WITNESSES ARE PARTICIPATING IN 
VIDEO CONFERENCES IN A ONE-TIME 

00:34:21.781 --> 00:34:24.644
EXCEPTION. SOME SENATORS, 
INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN, ARE 

00:34:25.074 --> 00:34:26.379
PARTICIPATING BY VIDEO 
CONFERENCE. 

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.694
SENATORS, WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED, 
MAY REMOVE THEIR MASKS, TALK 

00:34:30.614 --> 00:34:35.197
INTO THE MICROPHONE WHEN THEY'RE
IN THE HEARING ROOM, AS WE'RE 6 

00:34:35.467 --> 00:34:37.467
FEET APART. I'M GRATEFUL TO 

00:34:39.726 --> 00:34:43.296
THE PRESS GALLERY, ARCHITECTURAL
CAPITAL. 

00:34:43.553 --> 00:34:46.380
COMMITTEE POLICE. ALL FOR THEIR 
HARD WORK TO KEEP US SAFE. AT 

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.033
OUR HEARING LAST THURSDAY, I 
SAID IF ALL ROADS BACK TO WORK 

00:34:50.433 --> 00:34:52.829
AND BACK TO SCHOOL, RUN THROUGH 
TESTING. 

00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:57.013
AND THAT WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS 
DONE SO FAR ON TESTING IS 

00:34:57.273 --> 00:34:59.429
IMPRESSIVE, BUT NOT NEARLY 
ENOUGH. 

00:34:59.726 --> 00:35:03.732
OVER THE WEEKEND, SENATOR 
SCHUMER, THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 

00:35:03.982 --> 00:35:07.975
WAS NICE ENOUGH TO PUT OUT A 
TWEET, QUOTING HALF OF WHAT I 

00:35:08.225 --> 00:35:11.252
SAID. HE LEFT OUT THE OTHER 
HALF, THE IMPRESSIVE PART. 

00:35:11.645 --> 00:35:15.392
LET ME SAY WHAT I MEANT BY THAT.
WHEN I SAID, IMPRESSIVE. I MEANT

00:35:15.652 --> 00:35:18.098
THAT ACCORDING TO A JOHNS 
HOPKINS UNIVERSITY STUDY, THE 

00:35:18.348 --> 00:35:21.585
UNITED STATES HAS TESTED OVER 9 
MILLION AMERICANS FOR COVID-19. 

00:35:21.992 --> 00:35:24.108
THAT'S TWICE AS MANY AS ANY 
OTHER COUNTRY. 

00:35:24.368 --> 00:35:26.415
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CHINA HAS 
DONE. 

00:35:26.675 --> 00:35:31.685
AND IT'S MORE PER CAPITA THAN 
MOST COUNTRIES, INCLUDING SOUTH 

00:35:31.935 --> 00:35:35.531
KOREA, WHICH MANY MEMBERS OF OUR
COMMITTEE HAD CITED AS AN 

00:35:35.908 --> 00:35:42.507
EXAMPLE OF A COUNTRY THAT HAD 
TESTED WELL. ACCORDING TO DR. 

00:35:42.777 --> 00:35:45.454
DEBORAH BIRX, THE UNITED STATES 
WAS DOUBLE TESTING IN THE MONTH 

00:35:45.734 --> 00:35:48.929
OF MAY. WHICH WAS ABOUT 10 
MILLION TESTS CONDUCTED. HERE'S 

00:35:49.307 --> 00:35:53.310
WHAT I MEAN BY IMPRESSIVE HERE 
IN TENNESSEE WHERE I AM TODAY. 

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:57.034
FIRST, ANYONE WHO IS SICK, FIRST
RESPONDER, HEALTHCARE WORKER CAN

00:35:57.764 --> 00:36:00.960
GET TESTED. OUR GOVERNOR BILL 
LEE IS ALSO TESTING EVERY 

00:36:01.287 --> 00:36:07.287
PRISONER, EVERY RESIDENT STAFF 
MEMBER IN A NURSING HOME, 

00:36:07.737 --> 00:36:12.526
WEEKEND -- DRIVE THROUGH 
TESTING. SUBJECT TESTING TO 

00:36:12.776 --> 00:36:15.543
LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND CAN 
GET A FREE TEST AT THE LOCAL 

00:36:16.453 --> 00:36:20.596
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THE 
GOVERNOR'S SLOGAN IS, IF IN 

00:36:20.856 --> 00:36:25.089
DOUBT, GET A TEST. 
SENT THIS TO OTHERS. 

00:36:25.339 --> 00:36:28.412
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HELPING 
HIM MAKE SURE THAT HE HAS ENOUGH

00:36:28.672 --> 00:36:33.126
SUPPLIES, IN CASE HE HAS TROUBLE
GETTING THEM THROUGH THE LABS 

00:36:33.386 --> 00:36:35.164
AND THE OTHER COMMERCIAL 
SOURCES. 

00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:38.018
AS A RESULT, OUR STATE HAS 
TESTED ABOUT 4% OF THE 

00:36:38.019 --> 00:36:40.428
POPULATION. 
GOVERNOR HOPES TO INCREASE THAT 

00:36:40.688 --> 00:36:43.831
BY 7% IN MAY. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST IN THE 

00:36:43.832 --> 00:36:47.025
COUNTRY. 
THIS IMPRESSIVE LEVEL OF TESTING

00:36:47.275 --> 00:36:50.362
IS SUFFICIENT, WE BELIEVE. 
TO BEGIN PHASE 1 OF GOING BACK 

00:36:50.618 --> 00:36:53.941
TO WORK. 
BUT AS I SAID, LAST WEEK, IT'S 

00:36:54.201 --> 00:36:59.476
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO PROVIDE 
CONFIDENCE TO 31,000 STUDENTS 

00:36:59.737 --> 00:37:02.611
AND FACULTY MEMBERS, WHO WE HOPE
WILL SHOW UP AT THE UNIVERSITY 

00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:05.224
OF TENNESSEE CAMPUS IN AUGUST, 
WHEN SCHOOL STARTS. 

00:37:05.474 --> 00:37:10.997
LAST WEEK, I TALKED WITH U.T. 
KNOXVILLE CHANCELLOR, DON D. 

00:37:11.257 --> 00:37:14.671
PLOWMAN ABOUT THAT. WE SAID, 
WHAT WOULD PERSUADE THOSE 31,000

00:37:14.931 --> 00:37:20.160
STUDENTS, AS WELL AS THE 50 
MILLION K THROUGH 12 STUDENTS IN

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.074
THE COUNTRY? AND THE OTHER 5,000
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. WHAT WILL 

00:37:24.364 --> 00:37:28.247
PERSUADE THEM TO GO BACK TO 
CAMPUS IN AUGUST. THAT'S WHERE 

00:37:28.497 --> 00:37:30.843
THE NEW SHARK TANK COMES IN. DR.
COLLINS AT THE 

00:37:31.093 --> 00:37:35.196
NATIONALINSTITUTES OF HEALTH, 
CALL ITS RAD X. WE HAD OUR HEAR 

00:37:35.456 --> 00:37:39.110
BEING THAT ON THURSDAY. A REALLY
REMARKABLE SCIENTIFIC EXERCISE. 

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.776
TAKE A FEW EARLY-STAGE CONCEPTS 
THAT ARE SWIMMING AROUND IN WHAT

00:37:43.033 --> 00:37:47.206
WE CALL THAT COMPETITIVE SHARK 
TANK. AND SEE IF DR. COLLINS AND

00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:50.873
HIS ASSOCIATES CAN FIND A NEW 
NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO CREATE 

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:54.876
MILLIONS OF NEW TESTS THAT WILL 
SCALE UP RAPIDLY AND MAKE IT 

00:37:55.122 --> 00:37:58.819
MORE LIKELY THAT STUDENTS WILL 
GO BACK TO SCHOOL IN AUGUST. 

00:38:01.009 --> 00:38:05.209
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FDA AUTHORIZED 
LAST WEEK, ITS FIRST DIAGNOSTIC 

00:38:05.649 --> 00:38:08.515
TEST, USING SALIVA, THAT A 
PERSON PROVIDES AT HOME, INSTEAD

00:38:08.765 --> 00:38:13.115
OF A NOSE SWAB OR BLOOD. IT 
AUTHORIZED ITS FIRST ANTIGEN 

00:38:13.405 --> 00:38:15.692
TEST. WE'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT 
THOSE. LIKE THE 

00:38:29.183 --> 00:38:33.961
ANOTHER PROPOSAL NOT YET APPROVE
IS TO PUT A LOLLIPOP IN YOUR 

00:38:34.222 --> 00:38:40.091
MOUTH WITH A SPONGE. TAKE A 
PHOTO. 

00:38:47.917 --> 00:38:50.814
THOUSANDS OF THOSE SAMPLES 
OVERNIGHT. THAT SAME PROCESS 

00:38:51.074 --> 00:38:54.100
COULD OCCUR IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL. 
COULD OCCUR AT A FACTORY. OF 

00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:57.953
COURSE, ANYONE TESTING NEGATIVE,
ONE DAY CAN TEST POSITIVE THE 

00:38:58.243 --> 00:39:01.817
NEXT. 
BUT SUCH WIDESPREAD SCREENING OF

00:39:02.197 --> 00:39:04.716
ENTIRE CAMPUSES, SCHOOLS OR 
PLACES OF WORK, WILL HELP 

00:39:04.976 --> 00:39:10.246
IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE SICK. 
THOSE DOWN HERE EXPOSED. THAT IN

00:39:10.496 --> 00:39:14.109
TURN SHOULD HELP PERSUADE THE 
REST OF US GOING BACK TO SCHOOL 

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:20.076
AND BACK TO WORK. IN ADDITION TO
MORE TESTING, I EXPECT DR. FAUCI

00:39:20.336 --> 00:39:23.442
TO TALK TO US ABOUT ADDITIONAL 
TREATMENTS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO 

00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:26.336
REDUCE THE RISK OF DEATH AND THE
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO DO 

00:39:26.596 --> 00:39:29.142
SOMETHING THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS 
NEVER DONE BEFORE, WHICH IS TO 

00:39:29.562 --> 00:39:34.962
START MANUFACTURING A VACCINE 
BEFORE IT ACTUALLY IS PROVEN TO 

00:39:35.212 --> 00:39:39.908
WORK, IN ORDER TO SPEED UP THE 
WORK, IN CASE IT DOES WORK. 

00:39:40.178 --> 00:39:42.312
THOSE VACCINES, THOSE TREATMENTS
ARE THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION. BUT 

00:39:42.582 --> 00:39:46.465
UNTIL WE HAVE THEM, ALL ROADS 
BACK TO WORK AND SCHOOL GO 

00:39:47.215 --> 00:39:50.248
THROUGH TESTING. THE MORE TESTS 
WE CONDUCT, THE BETTER WE CAN 

00:39:50.518 --> 00:39:53.931
IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE SICK AND 
EXPOSED AND WE CAN QUARANTINE 

00:39:54.441 --> 00:39:58.224
THE SICK AND EXPOSED, INSTEAD OF
TRYING TO QUARANTINE THE WHOLE 

00:39:58.814 --> 00:40:02.448
COUNTRY. IN MY OPINION, THIS 
REQUIRES MILLIONS OF NEW TESTS, 

00:40:03.058 --> 00:40:06.371
MANY FROM NEW TECHNOLOGIES. SOME
OF THESE WILL FAIL, BUT WE ONLY 

00:40:06.631 --> 00:40:10.134
NEED A FEW SUCCESSES TO GET 
WHERE WE WANT TO GO. 

00:40:10.394 --> 00:40:13.527
THAT'S WHY I SAID, ON THURSDAY, 
THAT WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS DONE 

00:40:13.787 --> 00:40:18.980
SO FAR IN TESTING IS IMPRESSIVE.
BUT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. 

00:40:19.237 --> 00:40:21.487
FIRST, SQUEEZE ALL THE TESTS WE 
CAN OUT 

00:40:26.377 --> 00:40:29.733
OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES. NEXT 
TRY TO FIND NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO 

00:40:30.003 --> 00:40:34.566
TRY TO CONTAIN THE DISEASE TO 
HELP US GO BACK TO WORK. ONE 

00:40:34.876 --> 00:40:38.020
OTHER THING. THIS IS A 
BIPARTISAN HEARING EXAMINING HOW

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:41.252
WELL WE'RE EQUIPPED TO GO SAFELY
BACK TO WORK AND SCHOOL AND 

00:40:41.673 --> 00:40:44.519
DETERMINE WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO 
DO IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 

00:40:44.769 --> 00:40:47.653
SUCH AN EXERCISE SOMETIMES 
ENCOURAGES FINGER-POINTING. 

00:40:47.903 --> 00:40:51.006
BEFORE WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME 
FINGER POINTING. I'D LIKE TO 

00:40:51.256 --> 00:40:55.619
SUGGEST THAT ALMOST ALL OF US, 
THE UNITED STATES AND ALMOST 

00:40:55.889 --> 00:41:00.502
EVERY COUNTRY, SO FAR AS I CAN 
TELL, UNDERESTIMATED THIS VIRUS.

00:41:00.772 --> 00:41:02.969
UNDERESTIMATED HOW CONTAGIOUS IT
WOULD BE. 

00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:07.508
UNDERESTIMATED HOW IT CAN TRAVEL
SILENTLY, IN PEOPLE WITHOUT 

00:41:07.768 --> 00:41:11.932
SYMPTOMS TO INFECT OTHER PEOPLE.
HOW IT CAN BE ESPECIALLY DEADLY 

00:41:12.192 --> 00:41:16.795
FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF OUR 
POPULATION. THE ELDERLY. 

00:41:17.045 --> 00:41:19.045
THOSE WITH PREEXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 

00:41:19.111 --> 00:41:22.425
THE NORDIC POPULATION. LET ME GO
BACK TO THE MARCH 3rd HEARING 

00:41:22.885 --> 00:41:25.041
THAT WE HAD IN OUR COMMITTEE ON 
CORONAVIRUS. 

00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:28.994
SIX WEEKS, AFTER THE FIRST CASE 
WAS DISCOVERED IN THE UNITED 

00:41:29.284 --> 00:41:31.991
STATES, A DAY WHEN ONLY TWO 
DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN THIS 

00:41:32.251 --> 00:41:35.024
COUNTRY. 
I READ AT THAT HEARING, THIS 

00:41:35.274 --> 00:41:37.971
PARAGRAPH FROM THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES," TWO DAYS EARLIER ON 

00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:43.010
MARCH 1st. THEY REPORTED THIS. 
MUCH ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS 

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.557
REMAINS UNCLEAR, "THE TIMES" 
REPORTED. AND IT'S FAR FROM 

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.910
CERTAIN. 
THIS IS MARCH 3rd. 

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.367
THAT -- MARCH 1. THAT THE 
OUTBREAK WILL REACH SEVERE 

00:41:52.617 --> 00:41:55.643
PROPORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
OR AFFECT MANY REGIONS AT ONCE. 

00:41:57.424 --> 00:42:03.270
WITH ITS TOP-NOTCH SCIENTISTS, 
MODERN HOSPITALS AND SPRAWLING 

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.716
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, 
MOST EXPERTS AGREE, UNITED 

00:42:05.986 --> 00:42:10.699
STATES IS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S 
BEST PREPARED TO PREVENT OR 

00:42:10.947 --> 00:42:15.549
MANAGE SUCH AN EPIDEMIC. 
NEW YORK TIMES ON MARCH 1. 

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:19.472
A LOT OF EFFORT HAS GONE INTO 
TRYING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY WELL 

00:42:19.732 --> 00:42:23.666
PREPARED. OVER THE LAST 20 
YEARS, FOUR PRESIDENT, SEVERAL 

00:42:24.316 --> 00:42:30.925
CONGRESSES, IN RESPONSE TO 9/11,
BIRD FLU, KATRINA, EBOLA, H1N1, 

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:33.899
MERS. 
PASSED NINE MAJOR LAWS TO TRY TO

00:42:34.168 --> 00:42:37.682
HELP GET THIS COUNTRY READY FOR 
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH TODAY. 

00:42:38.988 --> 00:42:40.988
THESE LAWS STOOD 

00:42:43.252 --> 00:42:47.625
UP TO STRATEGIC STOCKPILES. 
SECRETARY FOR PREPAREDNESS. 

00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:51.464
CREATED INCENTIVES FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENTS OF VACCINES. 

00:42:51.724 --> 00:42:55.854
AND MEDICINES THAT WE'RE USING 
TODAY. 

00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:59.001
STRENGTHEN THE CENTERS FOR 
DISEASE CONTROL. 

00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:02.741
THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF 
SENATOR BLUNT AND SENATOR MURRAY

00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:07.234
FOR FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS. WE'VE 
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FUNDING 

00:43:08.894 --> 00:43:11.677
FOR NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF 
HEALTH. ALL OF THIS WAS PART OF 

00:43:11.937 --> 00:43:14.471
A SHARED GOAL. 
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, TO TRY 

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.770
TO GET READY FOR WHAT WE'RE 
GOING THROUGH TODAY. WHETHER IT 

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:22.030
WAS KNOWN, LIKE ANTHRAX OR 
UNKNOWN LIKE COVID-19. BUT 

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.009
DESPITE ALL OF THAT EFFORT, EVEN
THE EXPERTS UNDERESTIMATED 

00:43:27.419 --> 00:43:29.773
COVID-19. 
THIS HEARING IS ABOUT HOW WE 

00:43:30.023 --> 00:43:37.929
IMPROVE OUR RESPONSE TO THIS 
VIRUS AS WELL AS THE NEXT. 

00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:42.409
DURING THE OVERSIGHT HERE I ALSO
INTEND TO FOCUS ON, AS I SAID, 

00:43:42.789 --> 00:43:45.963
THE NEXT PANDEMIC, WHICH WE KNOW
IS COMING. WHAT CAN WE LEARN 

00:43:46.243 --> 00:43:50.466
FROM THIS ONE TO BE READY FOR 
THE NEXT ONE? 

00:43:50.716 --> 00:43:53.969
CAN WE? WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM 
THE FAST TRACKING OF VACCINES 

00:43:54.219 --> 00:43:57.675
AND TREATMENTS THAT WE'RE ABOUT 
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT WILL MAKE IT 

00:43:57.932 --> 00:44:02.735
EVEN FASTER THE NEXT TIME. 
HOW CAN WE KEEP HOSPITALS IN 

00:44:03.002 --> 00:44:05.852
STATES FROM SELLING OFF 
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, WHEN THEIR

00:44:06.108 --> 00:44:11.091
BUDGET GETS TIGHT. HOW CAN WE 
MAKE SURE CONGRESS DOES OUR 

00:44:11.341 --> 00:44:17.091
SHARE FOR THE FUNDING. HOW CAN 
WE PROVIDE ENOUGH HOSPITAL BEDS 

00:44:17.351 --> 00:44:19.351
WITHOUT CANCELING ENOUGH AND 
BANKRUPTCYING HOSPITALS. 

00:44:22.781 --> 00:44:25.758
COORDINATE SUPPLY LINES. 
TO MAKE SURE THEY GET TO WHERE 

00:44:26.008 --> 00:44:29.961
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO WHEN 
THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO GO. 

00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:33.534
WHAT'S THE WAY TO MANAGE THE 
STOCKPILE. MY PREACHER ONCE 

00:44:33.794 --> 00:44:37.327
SAID, I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
YOU DO ON SUNDAY. IT'S THE REST 

00:44:37.587 --> 00:44:40.454
OF THE WEEK THAT CONCERNS ME. 
I'M AFRAID THAT DURING THE REST 

00:44:40.714 --> 00:44:43.377
OF THE WEEK, BETWEEN PANDEMICS, 
WE RELAX OUR FOCUS ON 

00:44:43.797 --> 00:44:47.530
PREPAREDNESS. 
WE BECOME PREOCCUPIED WITH OTHER

00:44:48.191 --> 00:44:50.767
IMPORTANT THINGS. OUR COLLECTIVE
MEMORY IS SHORT. JUST THREE 

00:44:51.027 --> 00:44:55.457
MONTHS AGO, THIS COUNTRY WAS 
PREOCCUPIED WITH IMPEACHING A 

00:44:55.737 --> 00:44:58.793
PRESIDENT. NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE 
ANCIENT ROMAN HISTORY. 

00:44:59.043 --> 00:45:02.706
NOW, WHILE THIS CRISIS HAS OUR 
FULL ATTENTION, I BELIEVE WE 

00:45:02.986 --> 00:45:08.396
SHOULD PUT INTO LAW THIS YEAR 
WHATEVER IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE

00:45:08.656 --> 00:45:11.429
MADE TO BE WELL PREPARED FOR THE
NEXT PANDEMIC. 

00:45:11.679 --> 00:45:14.456
IF THERE IS TO BE FINGER 
POINTING, I HOPE THEY'RE POINTED

00:45:14.716 --> 00:45:17.502
IN THAT DIRECTION. 
WE'RE FORTUNATE TODAY TO HAVE 

00:45:17.752 --> 00:45:21.575
FOUR DISTINGUISHED WITNESSES WHO
ARE AT THE HEART OF THE RESPONSE

00:45:22.415 --> 00:45:25.229
TO CORONAVIRUS. WE'RE GRATEFUL 
FOR THEIR SERVICE TO OUR 

00:45:25.629 --> 00:45:29.402
COUNTRY. I'VE ASKED THEM EACH TO
SUMMARIZE THEIR REMARKS IN FIVE 

00:45:29.662 --> 00:45:31.662
MINUTES. THEN WE'LL HAVE 
FIVE-MINUTE ROUND OF QUESTIONS 

00:45:31.758 --> 00:45:35.702
FROM EACH SENATOR. 
I'VE AGREED WE WILL END OUR 

00:45:35.952 --> 00:45:38.445
HEARING ABOUT 12:30, AFTER WE 
HAVE A FULL ROUND OF QUESTIONS. 

00:45:39.015 --> 00:45:42.135
EVERY SENATOR WILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO HAVE HIS OR HER FIVE MINUTES.

00:45:42.918 --> 00:45:47.621
SENATOR MURRAY WILL THEN HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE LAST 

00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:50.854
QUESTION OR CLOSE THE HEARING 
AND I WILL THEN CLOSE THE 

00:45:51.114 --> 00:45:54.081
HEARING. THERE WILL BE OTHER 
HEARINGS TO FOLLOW THIS HEARING,

00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:57.504
LIKE LAST THURSDAY'S HEARING. 
AND SENATORS MAY SUBMIT THEIR 

00:45:57.745 --> 00:46:00.551
QUESTIONS IN WRITING WITHIN THE 
NEXT 10 DAYS. 

00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:04.873
STAYING AT HOME INDEFINITELY IS 
NOT THE SOLUTION TO THIS 

00:46:04.874 --> 00:46:07.570
PANDEMIC. 
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY 

00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:11.084
AVAILABLE TO HELP ALL OF THOSE 
HURT BY A CLOSED ECONOMY. 

00:46:11.354 --> 00:46:17.033
ALL ROADS BACK TO WORK, BACK TO 
SCHOOL, LEAD THROUGH TESTING, 

00:46:17.383 --> 00:46:20.690
TRACKING, ISOLATION, TREATMENT, 
AND VACCINE. 

00:46:20.934 --> 00:46:24.253
THIS REQUIRES WIDESPREAD 
TESTING. 

00:46:24.513 --> 00:46:27.436
MILLIONS MORE TESTS, CREATED 
MOSTLY BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TO 

00:46:27.696 --> 00:46:29.696
IDENTIFY THOSE WHO 

00:46:47.835 --> 00:46:51.029
THIS WAY. NEAR TERM. TO GET 
THOSE STUDENTS TO SHOW UP IN 

00:46:51.289 --> 00:46:55.439
AUGUST, WE NEED MORE WIDESPREAD 
TESTING. MILLIONS MORE. 

00:46:55.739 --> 00:46:59.195
TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN 
SICK, WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED, SO 

00:46:59.488 --> 00:47:02.338
THEY CAN BE QUARANTINED BY 
CONTAINING THE DISEASE IN THIS 

00:47:02.608 --> 00:47:05.765
WAY. TO GIVE THE REST OF AMERICA
ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO BACK TO 

00:47:06.025 --> 00:47:08.281
WORK AND BACK TO SCHOOL. 
SENATOR MURRAY? 

00:47:08.282 --> 00:47:10.358
&gt;&gt; WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
MR. CHAIRMAN. 

00:47:10.618 --> 00:47:13.591
MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU. AND 
YOUR TEAM RIGHT NOW. 

00:47:13.841 --> 00:47:17.604
AS YOU TRY TO NAVIGATE THE SAME 
CHALLENGE SO MANY IN OUR COUNTRY

00:47:17.864 --> 00:47:22.568
ARE WORRIED ABOUT. 
WE ALL WISH YOUR STAFF MEMBER A 

00:47:22.828 --> 00:47:26.591
SPEEDY RECOVERY. 
AND IF EVERYONE WORKS TO TAKE 

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:29.468
APPROPRIATE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 
TODAY. I'D LIKE TO THANK NOT 

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.721
ONLY OUR WITNESSES FOR JOINING 
US TODAY. BUT ALSO OUR COMMITTEE

00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:37.337
STAFF FOR WORKING TO SET UP THE 
STATE'S FORMAT FOR MEMBERS AND 

00:47:37.594 --> 00:47:41.199
WITNESSES AND THE PUBLIC TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING 

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.803
REMOTELY. 
FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE 

00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:47.857
COUNTING ON US. 
FOR THE TRUTH. 

00:47:48.137 --> 00:47:51.850
ABOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. 
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS CLEAR 

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.546
THEY WILL NOT GET IT FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

00:47:55.813 --> 00:47:58.820
TRUTH IS ESSENTIAL. 
SO PEOPLE HAVE THE FACTS. 

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:03.043
SO THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR 
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES 

00:48:03.293 --> 00:48:06.729
AND THEIR COMMUNITY. 
LIVES ARE AT STAKE. 

00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:08.979
THE PRESIDENT ISN'T 

00:48:10.632 --> 00:48:13.706
TELLING THE TRUTH. WE MUST. AND 
OUR WITNESSES MUST AND ARE 

00:48:13.966 --> 00:48:16.995
COUNTING ON YOU TODAY. AND 
FAMILIES NEED US TO TAKE THIS 

00:48:17.245 --> 00:48:19.829
OPPORTUNITY TO DIG INTO THE 
FACTS ABOUT WHERE THINGS DID GO 

00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:22.295
WRONG. SO WE CAN FINALLY GET 
THEM ON TRACK. 

00:48:22.545 --> 00:48:26.261
BECAUSE THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO 

00:48:26.521 --> 00:48:30.092
THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SO 
FAR HAS BEEN A DISASTER ON ITS 

00:48:30.372 --> 00:48:34.045
OWN. 
DELAYS. MISSTEPS. HAVE PUT US 

00:48:34.335 --> 00:48:40.175
WAY BEHIND WHERE WE NEED TO BE 
ON DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND AX LOWED

00:48:40.435 --> 00:48:44.858
INACCURATE ANTIBODY TESTS TO 
FLOOD THE MARKET. CORRUPTION AND

00:48:45.218 --> 00:48:48.521
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE HAVE 
IMPEDED EFFORTS TO SECURE 

00:48:49.071 --> 00:48:51.798
DESPERATELY NEEDED PERSONAL 
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND 

00:48:52.068 --> 00:48:54.068
PROMOTED DANGEROUS UNPROVEN 
TREATMENT. AND WE RECENTLY 

00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:57.867
LEARNED THAT AFTER EXPERTS AT 
THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL 

00:48:58.627 --> 00:49:02.220
AND PREVENTION SPENT WEEKS 
DEVELOPING A DETAILED GUIDE TO 

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.330
HELP OUR COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND 
HOW TO SAFELY REOPEN WHEN THE 

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:10.077
TIME COMES, THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION TOSSED IT IN THE 

00:49:10.407 --> 00:49:15.377
TRASH BIN FOR BEING TOO 
PRESCRIPTIVE. 

00:49:15.777 --> 00:49:23.623
THIS IS FAR FROM THE FIRST 
ECPERTS WERE DOING THEIR JOB AND

00:49:25.183 --> 00:49:27.183
PUTTING 

00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:30.923
HEALTH FIRST. FACT. MATTER IS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

00:49:31.183 --> 00:49:32.948
AMERICANS HAVE SADLY PAID THE 
PRICE. 

00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:36.473
SINCE THIS COMMITTEE LAST HEARD 
FROM THESE WITNESSES ON MARCH 

00:49:36.743 --> 00:49:43.889
3rd, WE HAVE SEEN OVER 900 
DEATHS IN THE STATE OF 

00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:46.199
WASHINGTON. 

00:49:48.242 --> 00:49:53.832
STILL, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING
TO IGNORE THE FACTS AND IGNORE 

00:49:54.092 --> 00:49:56.639
THE EXPERTS. 
WHO HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WE ARE 

00:49:56.918 --> 00:50:04.525
NOWHERE CLOSE TO WHERE WE NEED 
TO BE. MY HOPE IS WE CAN CUT 

00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:08.368
THROUGH THIS ABOUT WHAT IS 
NEEDED TO SAFELY OPEN. HOW CLOSE

00:50:08.628 --> 00:50:12.141
WE ARE AS A COUNTRY TO MEETING 
THOSE NEEDS. AND HOW WE ACTUALLY

00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:16.334
GET THERE. 
ONE THING THAT IS ABUNDANTLY 

00:50:16.584 --> 00:50:20.267
CLEAR, WE NEED DRAMATICALLY MORE
TESTING. 

00:50:20.527 --> 00:50:25.020
IT IS UNACCEPTABLE WE STILL 
DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGIC 

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:30.854
PLAN TO MAKE SURE TESTING IS 
FREE, FAST AND EVERYWHERE. THAT 

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.727
IS WHY I THOUGHT TO MAKE SURE 
OUR COVID-19 PACKAGING INCLUDED 

00:50:35.927 --> 00:50:38.971
AN INITIAL $25 BILLION TESTING 
FUND. 

00:50:39.227 --> 00:50:44.540
AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION SUBMIT A PLAN BY 

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.133
MALE 24th. AND WHEN I SAY A 
PLAN, I DON'T MEAN A P.R. PLAN. 

00:50:48.393 --> 00:50:51.906
I MEAN A PLAN WITH SPECIFIC TIME
LINE AND NUMERIC GOALS FOR 

00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:58.076
SUPPLY AND FUNDING NEEDS, ONE 
THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THE ONE 

00:50:58.366 --> 00:51:02.729
THAT TESTS ON FUNDING AND 
DISPARITY AND BUILDING OUT OUR 

00:51:02.989 --> 00:51:05.442
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. MAKES 
CLEAR TO STATES AND TRIBES AND 

00:51:05.702 --> 00:51:08.299
EMPLOYERS AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT AND 

00:51:08.719 --> 00:51:11.982
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL DO 
TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE. 

00:51:12.232 --> 00:51:14.719
BUT TESTING ALONE WON'T BE 
ENOUGH TO REOPEN OUR COUNTRY. 

00:51:15.609 --> 00:51:19.442
WE STILL NEED FAR MORE PERSONAL 
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAN HAS 

00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:21.999
BEEN AVAILABLE FOR OUR 
HEALTHCARE WORKERS ON THE FRONT 

00:51:22.289 --> 00:51:25.702
LINE. 
AND WE WILL NEED FAR MORE FOR 

00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:30.295
OTHER WORKERS AFTER WE REOPEN. 
SO WE DESPERATELY NEED THIS 

00:51:30.555 --> 00:51:33.358
ADMINISTRATION TO STEP UP AND 
GET THAT EQUIPMENT TO STATES WHO

00:51:33.618 --> 00:51:36.345
ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR 
POWER TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES BUT 

00:51:36.605 --> 00:51:43.134
SIMPLY CANNOT GET NEARLY ENOUGH.
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS, UNLIKE 

00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:46.158
STATES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
HAS THE TOOLS TO ACTUALLY FIX 

00:51:46.428 --> 00:51:48.744
THE PROBLEM, IF ONLY THE 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD USE THEM. 

00:51:49.044 --> 00:51:53.127
AND WE ALSO NEED THAT EQUIPMENT 
TO ACTUALLY WORK AND FOR THE FDA

00:51:53.684 --> 00:51:57.261
TO ACT PROMPTLY IF IT DOES NOT. 
NOT WEEKS LATER, WHEN PEOPLE MAY

00:51:57.521 --> 00:52:01.034
HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED. AND 
JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, WE CAN'T 

00:52:01.304 --> 00:52:05.303
EXPECT PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO WORK
OR TO RESTAURANT OR 

00:52:05.573 --> 00:52:10.057
COCONFIDENTLY SEND THEIR KIDS TO
SCHOOL, IF THERE ISN'T CLEAR, 

00:52:10.307 --> 00:52:13.083
DETAILED GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW TO 
DO THAT SAFELY. 

00:52:13.353 --> 00:52:16.330
SCHOOLS, FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD 
THROUGH COLLEGE, NEED TO KNOW 

00:52:16.816 --> 00:52:19.733
HOW TO KEEP THEIR STUDENTS, 
THEIR STAFF AND THEIR EDUCATORS 

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.120
SAFE. 
WHEN SHOULD THEY WEAR MASKS? HOW

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:27.609
DO YOU RUN A SCHOOL CAFETERIA OR
A SCHOOL BUS? AND IF THEY CAN'T 

00:52:27.969 --> 00:52:31.836
REOPEN CLASSROOMS, SCHOOLS AND 
FAMILIES NEED TO KNOW WE ARE 

00:52:32.123 --> 00:52:34.799
WORKING TO ENSURE EVERY STUDENT 
GETS AN EDUCATION. 

00:52:35.079 --> 00:52:38.756
TOOLS LIKE ONLINE LEARNING CAN 
ONLY GET US SO FAR, IF WE DON'T 

00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:42.141
ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, SO 
THAT EVERY STUDENT CAN ACCESS 

00:52:42.391 --> 00:52:48.162
THEM. EVEN THEN, THERE WILL BE 
LEARNING LOSS THAT CAN BE 

00:52:48.412 --> 00:52:50.054
EXISTING EDUCATIONAL DISPARITY. 
AMONG LOW-INCOME STUDENTS, 

00:52:50.055 --> 00:52:53.722
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES, 
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND 

00:52:53.972 --> 00:52:56.778
OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, IF
WE DON'T MAKE SURE THEY GET 

00:52:57.185 --> 00:52:59.054
EQUAL ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND 
SUPPORT. 

00:52:59.055 --> 00:53:02.628
AND OF COURSE, SCHOOLS AREN'T 
THE ONLY WORKPLACES WE'VE GOT TO

00:53:02.898 --> 00:53:05.335
BE THINKING ABOUT. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

00:53:05.595 --> 00:53:09.618
INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
KNOW HOW TO SAFELY REOPEN. AND 

00:53:09.868 --> 00:53:13.811
THAT PEOPLE KNOW THEIR WORKPLACE
IS SAFE. 

00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:17.874
SECRETARY SCALIA NEEDS TO STOP 
DRAGGING HIS FEET AND DO HIS JOB

00:53:18.144 --> 00:53:22.094
AND HAVE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SET
FORWARD A RULE THAT MAKES CLEAR 

00:53:22.744 --> 00:53:25.841
WORKER SAFETY IS NOT OPTIONAL. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I HOPE THIS 

00:53:26.181 --> 00:53:31.380
COMMITTEE CAN HEAR ABOUT THOSE 
CRITICAL ISSUES FROM SECRETARY 

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.907
SCALIA AND SECRETARY DEVOSS. 
AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

00:53:35.157 --> 00:53:39.245
TO PROTECT WORKERS AND RESIDENTS
AT OUR NURSING HOMES AND OTHER 

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:41.547
CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES, 
WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE 

00:53:41.807 --> 00:53:45.773
MOST DEADLY OUTBREAKS. 
AND AS THE RATCH 

00:53:49.876 --> 00:53:52.973
OF OUTBREAK AT MEAT PACKING 
PLANT SHOWS, THIS ISN'T JUST AN 

00:53:53.243 --> 00:53:55.336
ISSUE FOR THE HEALTHCARE 
INDUSTRY, IT IS FOR EVERYONE. 

00:53:55.603 --> 00:53:58.669
AND JUST AS WE NEED TO PLAN 
BEFORE WE START TO REOPEN. WE 

00:53:58.919 --> 00:54:02.386
ALSO NEED A PLAN WELL BEFORE WE 
HAVE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE 

00:54:02.632 --> 00:54:05.179
VACCINE, TO GUARANTEE THAT WE 
CAN QUICKLY PRODUCE AND 

00:54:05.439 --> 00:54:08.862
DISTRIBUTE IT ON A GLOBAL SCALE 
AND MAKE IT FREE AND AVAILABLE 

00:54:09.192 --> 00:54:12.329
FOR EVERYONE. 
SO I'LL BE ASKING ABOUT OUR 

00:54:12.688 --> 00:54:17.670
PROGRESS ON THOSE ISSUES TODAY. 
TODAY, SAFELY REOPENING OUR 

00:54:17.929 --> 00:54:21.592
COUNTRY MAY BE A WAYS OFF. AND 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNING 

00:54:21.842 --> 00:54:24.658
MAY BE WAY BEHIND. BUT THERE'S 
STILL A LOT THAT CONGRESS NEEDS 

00:54:24.915 --> 00:54:27.311
TO DO. THERE ISN'T TIME TO 
SPARE. 

00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:30.518
SOME, INCLUDING THE WHITE HOUSE,
SAY WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED 

00:54:31.785 --> 00:54:34.481
ENOUGH ECONOMIC RELIEF. MY 
QUESTION TO THEM IS WHAT GOOD IS

00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:38.034
A BRIDGE, IF IT ONLY GETS TO YOU
THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER? WE 

00:54:38.284 --> 00:54:41.348
DON'T NEED TO WAIT AROUND TO SEE
IF PEOPLE NEED MORE HELP. WE 

00:54:41.598 --> 00:54:44.905
KNOW THEY DO. WE NEED TO WORK 
QUICKLY ON ANOTHER AGGRESSIVE 

00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:48.014
RELIEF PACKAGE. AND WE NEED TO 
MAKE SURE OUR PRIORITIES IN THAT

00:54:48.264 --> 00:54:51.611
BILL ARE PROTECTING OUR WORKERS,
OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES 

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.214
AND ADDRESSING THIS PUBLIC 
HEALTH CRISIS, NOT BAILING OUT 

00:54:55.474 --> 00:54:57.540
CORPORATIONS OR PROTECTING BIG 
BUSINESS FROM ACCOUNTABILITY. 

00:54:59.787 --> 00:55:02.990
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE 
DOING THEIR PART. THEY ARE 

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:06.197
WASHING THEIR HANDS AND WEARING 
MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND 

00:55:06.457 --> 00:55:08.953
STAYING HOME. 
THEY NEED THEIR GOVERNMENT TO DO

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.947
ITS PART, TOO. 
THEY NEED LEADERSHIP. THEY NEED 

00:55:12.207 --> 00:55:15.023
A PLAN. 
THEY NEED HONESTY. AND THEY NEED

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.179
IT NOW. 
BEFORE WE REOPEN. SO THEY CAN 

00:55:18.446 --> 00:55:21.963
REST ASSURED THAT WE ARE DOING 
THINGS SAFELY AND CONFIDENTLY, 

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:27.773
WITH THEIR HELP AND WELL BEING 
AT THE TOP PRIORITY. THANK YOU, 

00:55:28.023 --> 00:55:30.023
MR. CHAIRMAN. 

00:55:34.729 --> 00:55:38.702
&gt;&gt; IT'S AN IMPORTANT HEARING AND
I KNOW MANY PEOPLE MAY BE 

00:55:38.962 --> 00:55:42.039
WATCHING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
IF THEY ARE, I HOPE THEY NOTICE 

00:55:42.299 --> 00:55:45.862
WE HAVE 23 MEMBERS ON THIS 
COMMITTEE, I BELIEVE, ONE MORE 

00:55:46.152 --> 00:55:49.268
REPUBLICAN THAN DEMOCRAT. WE 
HAVE SOME VERY STRONG VIEWS, BUT

00:55:49.628 --> 00:55:52.602
WE'RE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND 
EXPRESS THOSE VIEWS AND RESPECT 

00:55:52.852 --> 00:55:56.315
EACH OTHER AND OUR WITNESSES. 
AND A BIG PART OF THAT GOES TO 

00:55:56.565 --> 00:55:59.091
SENATOR MURRAY AND HER STAFF. SO
THANK YOU FOR THAT. 

00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:01.907

00:58:43.509 --> 00:58:45.832
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THANK 
YOU FOR GIVING ME THE 

00:58:46.105 --> 00:58:48.988
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU 
TODAY THE ROLE, THE NATIONAL 

00:58:49.308 --> 00:58:52.155
INSTITUTES OF THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND 

00:58:52.415 --> 00:58:55.628
RESEARCH, ADDRESSING COVID-19. 
THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE HAVE 

00:58:55.948 --> 00:58:59.854
IS FOUR FOLD. ONE, TOO IMPROVE 
OUR FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:59:00.171 --> 00:59:02.848
VIRUS AND THE DISEASE IT CAUSES.
NEXT. 

00:59:03.108 --> 00:59:07.321
TO DEVELOP NEW POINT OF CARE 
DIAGNOSTICS. NEXT, TO 

00:59:08.308 --> 00:59:13.321
CHARACTERIZE, AND TEST 
THERAPEUTICS. AND FINALLY, ABOUT

00:59:14.061 --> 00:59:17.770
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINES. 
FIRST, WITH REGARD TO 

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:22.293
DIAGNOSTICS. AS YOU PROBABLY 
HEARD FROM DR. FRANCIS THURSDAY.

00:59:22.563 --> 00:59:28.093
THE NIH HAS DEVELOPED THE RAPID 
DIAG NOSTICS PROGRAM. 

00:59:28.343 --> 00:59:31.287
WITH AWARD TO THAT SPECIFIC 
PROGRAM, UP TO HALF A BILLION 

00:59:31.547 --> 00:59:35.290
DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF COVID-19 

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:39.103
DIAGNOSTICS. IT IS A NATIONAL 
CALL FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY 

00:59:39.903 --> 00:59:43.307
THAT WILL BE EVALUATED IN A 
SHARK TANK LIKE SELECTION 

00:59:43.596 --> 00:59:46.709
PROCESS. TO GET TO EITHER 
SUCCESS OR FAILURE, RAPIDLY. 

00:59:48.966 --> 00:59:53.739
MOVING ONTO THERAPEUTICS. I'LL 
TALK A BIT ABOUT THE REMDESIVIR 

00:59:54.009 --> 00:59:56.862
SUCCESS ANTI-VIRAL IN A MOMENT. 
BUT LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT THERE 

00:59:57.112 --> 01:00:00.776
ARE A NUMBER OF BROAD SPECTRUM 
ANTI-VIRALS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

01:00:01.036 --> 01:00:03.036
TESTING. 

01:00:55.308 --> 01:00:55.937
.

01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:57.457
&gt;&gt; The result was significant

01:00:57.458 --> 01:01:00.758
&gt;&gt;&gt; AND REALLY MODEST. WE HAVE
 TO REMEMBER THAT IT WAS ONLY A

01:01:00.998 --> 01:01:04.223
 MODEST RESULT SHOWING THAT THE
 DRUG MADE A 31% FASTER TIME FOR

01:01:04.463 --> 01:01:10.232
 RECOVERY. WE HOPE TO BUILD ON
 THIS MODEST SUCCESS WITH

01:01:10.478 --> 01:01:14.127
COMBINATIONS OF DRUGS AND BETA
 DRUGS. MOVING ON TO VACCINES.  

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:16.128
THERE ARE AT LEAST EIGHT

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:22.028
 CANDIDATES COVID-19 VACCINES IN
 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE NIH

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:25.304
 IS COLLABORATING WITH THE
 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WITH

01:01:25.583 --> 01:01:29.588
 THE VARIOUS STAGES OF
 DEVELOPMENT. I WILL DESCRIBE

01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:33.369
 ONE BRIEFLY, AND THAT'S NOT THE
 ONLY ONE. ONE THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:01:33.608 --> 01:01:35.608
 INVOLVED WITH HEAVILY
 DEVELOPING. IT'S THE MESSENGER

01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:39.338
 RNA PLATFORM. YOU MAY RECALL IN
 THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN JANUARY

01:01:39.579 --> 01:01:43.474
 OF THIS YEAR I SAID THAT IT
 WOULD TAKE ABOUT A YEAR TO

01:01:43.759 --> 01:01:47.918
18 MONTHS IF WE WERE
 SUCCESSFULLY IN DEVELOPING A

01:01:48.318 --> 01:01:53.069
 VACCINE. THE NIH TRIAL MOVED
 VERY QUICKLY. ON JANUARY 10TH,

01:01:53.788 --> 01:01:58.108
 THE SEQUENCE WAS KNOWN. THEY
 SENT IT TO DEVELOP A PLAN. ON

01:01:58.419 --> 01:02:01.519
 THE 14th OF JANUARY, WE STARTED
 TO

01:02:04.698 --> 01:02:09.694
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. 62 DAYS
 LATER WE ARE NOW IN PHASE ONE

01:02:10.198 --> 01:02:13.179
 CLINICAL TRIAL. THERE'S ANIMAL
 SAFETY THAT THE PHASE ONE WILL

01:02:13.459 --> 01:02:17.634
 GO IN TO PHASE TWO THREE LATE
 SPRING EARLY SUMMER, AND IF

01:02:17.879 --> 01:02:21.589
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL, WE HOPE TO
 KNOW THAT IN THE LATE FALL AND

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:25.719
 EARLY WINTER. THERE ARE SOME
 IMPORTANT ISSUES IN COVID-19

01:02:26.149 --> 01:02:29.859
 VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE
 MANY CANDIDATES THAT HOPE TO

01:02:30.099 --> 01:02:33.799
 HAVE MULTIPLE WINNERS. IN OTHER
 WORDS, IF THE SHOTS WERE ON

01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:37.028
GOAL, THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
 THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR THE 

01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:38.738
GLOBAL
 AVAILABILITY IF WE HAVE MORE

01:02:38.739 --> 01:02:43.269
 THAN ONE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE.
 WE ALLEGES AS THE CHAIRMAN

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:46.079
MENTIONED WILL BE REPRODUCING
 THE VACCINE AT RISK, AND THAT

01:02:46.331 --> 01:02:51.979
 MEAN THAT IS WE'RE INVEST
 DATEING THE CONSIDERABLE

01:02:52.224 --> 01:02:55.769
RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING BEFORE
 WE KNOW ANY GIVEN CANDIDATES OR

01:02:56.034 --> 01:03:00.549
 CANDIDATES WORK. I MUST WARN
 THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:04.019
 KNEEING TOUGHER CONSCIENCES
 WHERE CERTAIN VACCINES CAN

01:03:04.259 --> 01:03:07.794
ENHANCE THE NEGATIVE AFFECT OF
 THE INFECTION. THE BIG UNKNOWN

01:03:08.044 --> 01:03:13.984
 IS ITHACA SI. IS IT PRESENT AND
 HOW DURABLE WILL IT BE. THEN I

01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:21.699
 WANT TO NOTE THAT THEY HAVE
 LAUNCHED A PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:03:21.939 --> 01:03:25.319
PARTNERSHIP THAT IS COVID-19
 VACCINES. THE PURPOSE OF THAT

01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:30.249
 IS TO PRIORITIZE AND ACCELERATE
 CLINICAL COLLABORATION OF

01:03:30.499 --> 01:03:33.979
CANDIDATES WITH THE POTENTIAL.
 HOPEFULLY THE RESEARCH EFFORTS

01:03:34.509 --> 01:03:37.439
 TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER PUBLIC
 HEALTH EFFORTS WILL GET US

01:03:37.684 --> 01:03:40.645
QUICKLY TO AN END TO THIS ORDEAL
 THAT WE'RE ALL GOING THROUGH.

01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:46.159
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAPPY TO
 ANSWER QUESTIONS LATER.

01:03:46.599 --> 01:03:49.338
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DR., FAUCI.

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:52.150
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, CHAIRMAN
 ALEXANDER AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:03:52.389 --> 01:03:56.259
 COMMIT TEE. OUR NATION IS
 CONFRONTING THE MOST SERIOUS

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:59.919
 PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN MORE
 THAN A CENTURY. WE'RE NOT

01:04:00.194 --> 01:04:03.059
DEFENSELESS. WE HAVE POWERFUL
 TOOLS TO FIGHT THIS ENEMY. WE

01:04:03.694 --> 01:04:07.888
 HAVE TRIED AND TRUE AFFECTIVE
 PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS 

01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:10.780
SUCH
 AS THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION,

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.910
 ISOLATION AND CONTRACT TRACING
 COMBINED WITH THE IMPORTANT

01:04:14.163 --> 01:04:16.163
MITIGATION STRATEGY AND
 INCLUDING THE SOCIAL DISTANCING

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.349
 AND THE FREQUENT HAND WASHING
 AND FACE COVERINGS. THESE

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:26.129
PUBLIC TOOLS HAVE AND WILL
 CONTINUE TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.539
 COVID-19. I PREACHED THE
 OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING FOR 

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.960
THE
 WORK OF COVID-19. CDC HAS BEEN

01:04:33.359 --> 01:04:37.295
 WORKING 24/7 TO COMBAT THE
 PANDEMIC. THE CDC EMERGENCY

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:42.520
OPERATION CENTER IS SUPPORTING
 THE STATE, TRIBAL, LOCAL AND

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.600
 TERRITORIAL DEPARTMENTS IN
 BUILDING CORE CAPABILITIES LIKE

01:04:47.688 --> 01:04:51.430
 WORKFORCE, LABORATORY AND DATA
 ANALYTICS. EPIDEMIOLOGYST ARE

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.570
 CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCE FOR
 COVID-19 AND THE HEALTH SYSTEM

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:57.719
 SURVEILLANCE. THE MITIGATION
 TEAMS ARE PROVIDING THE 

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.450
GUIDANCE
 ON THE CONTACT TRACING AND THE

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.749
 LABORATORY EXPERTS ARE
 PERFORMING THE TESTING TO 

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.625
BETTER
 DEFINE THE EXTENT OF THE

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.170
POPULATION. AS LOCAL
 LEADERSHIPS MAKE THE DECISIONS

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.860
 TO REOPEN, THEY WILL REQUIRE 
THE

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.230
VARYING DEGREES OF THE FEDERAL
 SUPPORT. EACH LOCATION IS

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.911
DIFFERENT AND WILL FACE UNIQUE
 CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CDC HAS

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:23.750
CONDUCTED A STATE BY STATE
 ASSESSMENT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:28.559
 TESTING, CAPACITY AND KEY
 CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY AS 

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.384
WELL
 AS THE SURGE PLANS.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:34.220
THEY'RE PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL
 ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE

01:05:34.465 --> 01:05:36.720
PROVIDING TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL
 CARES ABOUT AND ENHANCEMENT.

01:05:36.965 --> 01:05:40.500
 WE'RE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE
 STATE PUBLIC LEADER TO DEFINE

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:47.525
 THEIR NEEDS FOR THE TESTING AND
 TESTING DEVICES, SUPPLIES AND

01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:50.015
 MANPOWER, SU SCREE LON, DATA

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:22.110
AND THEIR
 JURISDICTION AND THEN WILL

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:27.725
ADDRESS THE TESTING COMPONENTS
 OF THE RESPONSE IN GREATER

01:06:27.981 --> 01:06:30.580
DETAIL. CONTACT TRACING,
 INCREASING STATE AND CONTACT

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.359
 TRACING CAPACITY IS CRITICAL.
 IT'S A CRITICAL PART TO STOP 

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.290
THE
 CHANGE OF THE TRANSMISSION AND

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.450
 PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF
 SUSTAINING COMMUNITY

01:06:40.715 --> 01:06:43.771
TRANSMISSION. CDC'S ROLL IS TO
 PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL TRAINING,

01:06:44.366 --> 01:06:48.080
 ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR THE
 STATE AS THEY HIRE AND BUILD A

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.005
 WORKFORCE NECESSARY TO BE FULLY
 PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE

01:06:53.251 --> 01:06:55.800
PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES BY THE
 ONGOING PANDEMIC. THIS IS GOING

01:06:56.101 --> 01:07:00.690
 TO BE AN EXPANSIVE EFFORT.
 SURVEILLANCE, OUR NATION'S

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.461
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM IS BUILT ON
 A COMBINATION OF THE SYSTEMS

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.605
 INCLUDING THE EXISTING AND
 RESPIRATORY DISEASE AND THE

01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:12.460
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND COMBINE
 WITH THE COMMERCIAL AND 

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.461
RESEARCH
 LAB PLATFORMS AND IN

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:22.451
THE CASE
 REPORTING FORM PAL. THEY HAVE

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:28.591
 THESE IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19.
 IN REPORT OF THE CURBS OF THE

01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:31.741
 INFECTION, THE SURVEILLANCE FOR
 ASYSTEMATIC INFECTIONS BECOMES

01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:33.991
 AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC

01:07:36.841 --> 01:07:38.841
HEALTH TOOL
 FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION.

01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:41.431
THEY'RE WORKING WITH EACH TO

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:52.851
 DEVELOP A PROGRAM FOR THE
 SURVEILLANCE AND WE NEED TO

01:07:53.101 --> 01:07:55.941
REBUILD THE NATION'S PUBLIC
 HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THE DATA

01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:59.540
 ANALYTICS AND THEN THE
 RESILIENCE AND THEN THE 

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:01.490
NATION'S
 PUBLIC WORKFORCE. NOW, IS THE

01:08:01.491 --> 01:08:04.981
 TIME TO PUT IT IN PLACE FOR THE
 GENERATIONS TO COME. NOT ONLY

01:08:05.221 --> 01:08:08.581
 FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS
 THAT THE NATION NEEDS, BUT FOR

01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:12.061
 THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM THAT
 THE PUBLIC DESERVES. BEFORE I

01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:17.960
 CLOSE, I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE
 DEDICATION TO THE CDC STAFF 

01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:20.786
THAT
 HAS DEPLOYED TO EVERY CORNER OF

01:08:21.101 --> 01:08:24.701
 THE NATION TO FIGHT COVID-19.
 MORE THAN 4,000 EMPLOYEES HAVE

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:30.031
 DEPLOYED. SCIENCE AND DATA
 CONTINUE WITH THE EXPERT AND TO

01:08:30.401 --> 01:08:34.554
 BE THE BACKBONE OF THE U.S.
 RESPONSE. I EXTEND THE SERIOUS

01:08:34.871 --> 01:08:39.371
 GRATITUDE TO THE HEALTH CARE
 WORKERS IN THE FRONT LINES AS

01:08:39.606 --> 01:08:42.701
 WELL AS THE FAMILIES AND THEN
 THE ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL AS WELL

01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:46.411
 AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SAY
 THANK YOU TO THE STAY AT HOME

01:08:46.651 --> 01:08:48.364
 GUIDELINES AND PROTECTING TO 
THE

01:08:48.365 --> 01:08:51.310
MOST VULNERABLE. IT'S IMPORTANT
 TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT OUT OF 

01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:53.225
THE
 WOODS YET. THEY'RE MORE

01:08:53.226 --> 01:08:56.591
PREPARED, AND WE NEED TO STAY
 VIGILANTE IN THE SOCIAL

01:08:56.836 --> 01:09:00.091
DISTANCING AND REMAINING
 IMPERATIVE. WE'RE A RESILIENT

01:09:00.577 --> 01:09:03.450
 NATION, AND WE WILL STAY LONGER
 TOGETHER. THANK YOU.  

01:09:03.451 --> 01:09:05.451
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DR. RED

01:09:08.942 --> 01:09:10.942
FIELD.  WELCOME.

01:09:16.831 --> 01:09:23.220
 AN UPDATE ON THE NATION'S
 PROCESS IN TESTING FOR 

01:09:23.221 --> 01:09:25.591
COVID-19.
 ON MARCH 12TH, SECRETARY AZAR

01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:31.791
 SAY THAT I LEAVE THE EFFORTS
 WHEN HHS AND OVERSIGHT AND THE

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:37.601
 FDA AND SINCE THEN THE NATION
 HAS PERFORMED MORE THAN 9

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:41.062
MILLION COVID-19 TASKS. A
 NUMBER FAR GREATER THAN ANY

01:09:41.312 --> 01:09:44.551
OTHER COUNTRY AND DOUBLE THE PER
 CAPITA TEST PERFORMED TO DATE 

01:09:44.552 --> 01:09:46.572
IN
 SOUTH KOREA. TO REACH THIS

01:09:46.811 --> 01:09:51.761
POINT, WE KID A PHASED APPROACH
 TO MEET THE TESTING NEEDS 

01:09:51.762 --> 01:09:54.142
DURING
 MITIGATION AND NOW DURING PHASE

01:09:54.551 --> 01:09:56.622
 ONE OF THE REOPENING OF 
AMERICA.

01:09:57.982 --> 01:10:01.691
DURING MARCH 20TH WE HAD 21
 COMMUNITY BASED DRIVE-THRU

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:11.772
 TESTING SITES IN THE CDC.
 TESTING OVER A THOUSAND AND

01:10:12.092 --> 01:10:16.532
DEMONSTRATES A PROPERTY TYPE
 THAT'S IN NEARLY EVERY STATE.

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:22.182
 NEXT, THE ADMINISTRATION
 LEVERAGE TRUSTED THE RETAILERS

01:10:22.442 --> 01:10:24.442
 LIKE CVS, RITE-AID, WALMART 
THAT

01:10:24.682 --> 01:10:29.562
ARE PROVIDING TESTING AT 240
 LOCATIONS IN 33 STATES. 69% OF

01:10:30.002 --> 01:10:35.932
 WHICH ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES
 WITH THE HIGH VON BLT. TO MEET

01:10:36.177 --> 01:10:39.602
 THE NEEDS LIKE THE SWABS AND
 MEDIA TUBES, WE FIRST SUPPLIED

01:10:39.852 --> 01:10:43.242
 THE CHAIN TO A MILITARY AIR
 BRIDGE. WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH

01:10:43.912 --> 01:10:45.912
 THE MANUFACTURES TO INCREASE 
THE

01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:48.632
DOMESTIC PRODUCTION. WE
 COLLABORATE WITH THE PRIVATE

01:10:49.032 --> 01:10:55.252
 SECTOR AND THE FDA TO VALIDATE
 THE SWAB AND MEDIA TYPES THAT

01:10:55.512 --> 01:10:57.481
 EXPANDED AND MINIMIZED THE 
NEEDS

01:10:57.482 --> 01:11:01.442
FOR PPE. FINELY WE USED THE
 TITLE THREE OF THE DEFENSE

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.637
PRODUCTION ACT TO FURTHER INVEST
 IN THE MANUFACTURING TO PREPARE

01:11:04.882 --> 01:11:10.147
 US FOR THE REOPENING. TO
 SUPPORT THE NEED FOR

01:11:10.382 --> 01:11:12.712
SURVEILLANCE TESTING FOR
 REOPENING, ON APRIL 27TH WE

01:11:12.952 --> 01:11:17.112
ISSUED A NEW TESTING FRAME WORK
 THAT ALSO PRIORITIZED THE

01:11:17.352 --> 01:11:21.261
TESTING FOR PERSON'S WITHOUT
 SYMPTOMS THAT ARE PRIORITIZED 

01:11:21.262 --> 01:11:23.362
BY
 THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR ANY

01:11:23.742 --> 01:11:26.847
 REASON INCLUDING THE SCREENING
 OF THE ASYSTEMATIC INDIVIDUALS

01:11:27.232 --> 01:11:29.232
 ACCORDING TO

01:11:31.502 --> 01:11:34.422
THE STATE AND LOCAL
 PLANS. NEXT THE TEAM HAD CALLS

01:11:34.722 --> 01:11:39.747
 WITH THE LEADERSHIP FROM EACH
 STATE TO SET STATE SPECIFIC

01:11:39.992 --> 01:11:43.332
TESTING OBJECTIVE. COLLECTIVELY
 THE STATES AND TERRITORIES

01:11:43.602 --> 01:11:47.212
ESTABLISHED AN OVERALL GOAL TO
 PERFORM 12.9 MILLION TESTS OVER

01:11:47.673 --> 01:11:51.402
 THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS. THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO

01:11:51.654 --> 01:11:53.762
 AND WILL SUPPORT THE 
ACHIEVEMENT

01:11:54.012 --> 01:11:56.963
OF THIS GOAL. SPECIFICALLY, THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SHIPPING

01:11:58.292 --> 01:12:01.779
 TO STATES 12.9 MILLION SWABS 
AND

01:12:02.037 --> 01:12:05.672
OVER 9.7 MILLION TUBES OF MEDIA
 IN MAY ALONE. LAST MONTH WE

01:12:06.202 --> 01:12:10.151
ALSO DETAILED THE LOCATION AND
 CAPACITY OF EVERY LAB MACHINE 

01:12:10.152 --> 01:12:12.952
IN
 EVERY STATE THAT COULD

01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:16.713
POTENTIALLY RUB COVID-19 APHASE.
 THE TEAM HAS WORK WITH THE TEST

01:12:16.953 --> 01:12:18.942
 SUPPLIERS TO MATCH THEM WITH 
THE

01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:22.922
MACHINES. ROOKING FORWARD
 BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF 

01:12:22.923 --> 01:12:25.841
2020,
 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL 

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:29.292
HAVE
 OVER 135 MILLION SWABS AND 132

01:12:29.903 --> 01:12:34.703
 MILLION TUBES OF MEDIA AND
 DISTRIBUTE THEM TO THE PHASE AS

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:38.972
 REQUESTED TO SUPPLEMENT THE NOW
 ROBUST SUPPLY. WE ANTICIPATE

01:12:39.223 --> 01:12:41.668
 THE CURRENT TESTS AS WELL AS 
THE

01:12:41.913 --> 01:12:46.063
DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF THE NEW
 CARE TESTS LIKE THE FIRST IN

01:12:46.843 --> 01:12:49.659
 CLASS TEST AUTHORIZED BY THE 
FDA

01:12:49.924 --> 01:12:53.433
JUST LAST FRIDAY. THEY
 ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO

01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:58.553
DISTRIBUTE 300,000 TESTS PER DAY
 WITHIN JUST A FEW WEEKS. SO BY

01:12:58.893 --> 01:13:02.370
 SEPTEMBER TAKING EVERY ASPECT 
OF

01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:05.523
THE COPMENT, AUTHORIZATION AND
 THEN THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN TO

01:13:05.763 --> 01:13:08.528
CONSIDERATION, WE PROJECT THAT
 THE NATION IS CAPABLE OF

01:13:08.776 --> 01:13:13.883
PERFORMING AT LEAST 40 TO 50
 MILLION TESTS PER MONTH IF

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:18.513
NEEDED AT THAT TIME. AND IF
 THEY'RE AUTHORIZED LIKE THE

01:13:18.763 --> 01:13:23.948
APPROACHES OR ANY NOVEL
 SOLUTIONS UNCOVERED BY THE NIH

01:13:24.268 --> 01:13:28.853
 INITIATIVE, THAT NUMBER IS
 HIGHER. FINALLY, I WANT TO

01:13:29.103 --> 01:13:31.588
ACKNOWLEDGE AND EXPRESS THE
 HEART FELT GRATITUDE TO THE

01:13:31.823 --> 01:13:34.383
OFFICERS OF THE U.S. PUBLIC
 HEALTH SERVICE COMMISSION CORE.

01:13:34.823 --> 01:13:38.683
 THE UNIFORMED SERVICE THAT I'M
 HONORED TO LEAD. 3471 MEN AND

01:13:38.933 --> 01:13:42.453
 WOMAN HAVE DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT
 OF THIS PANDEMIC. ON THE CRUISE

01:13:43.163 --> 01:13:48.613
 SHIP IN JAPAN TO OUR MILITARY
 BASES IN AMERICA, TO OUR

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.383
COMMUNITY BASE TESTING SITES AND
 INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, TO FEMA

01:13:52.143 --> 01:13:55.902
 AND THE TASK FORCES TO NURSING
 FACILITIES INCLUDING KING 

01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:58.033
COUNTY
 WASHINGTON AND TO FIELD

01:13:58.273 --> 01:14:00.273
HOSPITALS IN HARD HIT
 COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION.

01:14:00.493 --> 01:14:05.553
 I THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF
 THESE OFFICERS AND THEIR

01:14:05.803 --> 01:14:10.413
FAMILIES AND ON THEIR BEHALF, I
 THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS

01:14:10.673 --> 01:14:13.478
COMMITTEE FOR SUPPORTING THE
 TRAINING NEEDS AND THE READY

01:14:14.173 --> 01:14:17.360
 BEST RESERVE TO SUPPLEMENT THE
 RANKS AND FUTURE NATIONAL

01:14:17.603 --> 01:14:27.493
EMERGENCIES. THANK YOU FOR THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE

01:14:27.883 --> 01:14:28.752
REMARKS.

01:14:28.753 --> 01:14:30.502
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU GIOR.

01:14:30.503 --> 01:14:33.703
&gt;&gt; MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE,
 THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO

01:14:33.963 --> 01:14:36.963
 PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING
 TODAY. I FIRST WANT TO START BY

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.613
 THANKING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
FOR

01:14:40.863 --> 01:14:43.853
THEIR INCREDIBLE EFFORTS AT
 MITIGATION AND EXTEND MY

01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:47.123
CONDOLENCES TO THOSE THAT HAVE
 LOST LOVED ONES. FROM DAY ONE

01:14:47.364 --> 01:14:54.093
 OF THIS PANDEMIC THE 18,000 FDA
 EMPLOYEES WHO ARE JUST

01:14:54.344 --> 01:14:57.552
INCREDIBLE SCIENTISTS AND
 DOCTORS AND NURSES HAVE TAKEN 

01:14:57.553 --> 01:14:59.553
AN
 ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:06.804
 RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC. THE
 FDA HAS WORKED TO FACILITATE TO

01:15:07.043 --> 01:15:12.144
 DIAGNOSIS, TREAT COVID-19. WE
 HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE

01:15:12.706 --> 01:15:14.914
 LABORATORIES, MANUFACTURES, OUR
 FEDERAL PARTNERS AND COMPANIES.

01:15:15.354 --> 01:15:21.144
 COMPANIES THAT DO NOT MAKE THE
 MEDICAL PROPERTIES BUT WANT TO

01:15:21.524 --> 01:15:24.564
 PITCH IN BY MAKING HAND
 SANITIZER AND PERSONAL

01:15:24.818 --> 01:15:27.594
EQUIPMENT. EVERY DECISION THAT
 WE HAVE MADE IS DRIVEN BY THE

01:15:27.834 --> 01:15:30.819
 DATA AND THE GOAL OF PROTECTING
 THE HEALTH AND AMERICAN PEOPLE.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:33.694
 IN THE PUB RE PUBLIC HEALTH, 
THE

01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:37.084
RESPONSE IS BOND TO THE URGENT
 NEEDS TO MAKE THE MEDICAL

01:15:37.334 --> 01:15:40.164
PRODUCTS AVAILABLE WITH THE
 PROVISION OF A LEVEL OF

01:15:40.414 --> 01:15:44.119
OVERSIGHT THAT HELPS WITH THE
 SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:48.814
 MEDICAL PRODUCTS. I WOULD LIKE
 TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO SAY

01:15:49.094 --> 01:15:53.614
 WHAT THE FFDA IS DOING AT THERE
 POINT AND THEY HAVE THE SAFE TO

01:15:53.894 --> 01:15:56.829
 RETURN TO WORK AND SCHOOL. IT
 STARTS WITH TESTESING AS OTHERS

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:59.874
 HAVE MENTIONED. THEY HAVE
 WORKED WITH MORE THAN 500

01:16:00.114 --> 01:16:04.364
DEVELOPERS AS AND SAY THAT THEY
 WILL BE SUBMITTING THE

01:16:04.604 --> 01:16:08.934
AUTHORIZATION REQUEST FOR THE
 COVID-19 TESTING. THIS IS SOME

01:16:09.234 --> 01:16:10.963
 NEWER TECHNOLOGY THAT NOT 
WITHIN

01:16:10.964 --> 01:16:15.364
USED FOR THE TESTING RESPONSE TO
 THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE ISSUED 92

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:19.124
 INDIVIDUALS I EMERGENCY USE
 AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THE

01:16:19.354 --> 01:16:22.594
MANUFACTURES AND LABORATORIES,
 AND WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY

01:16:22.974 --> 01:16:26.274
 MORE THAN 250 LABORATORIES AND
 THEY HAVE BEGUN TO TEST UNDER

01:16:26.544 --> 01:16:31.774
 THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WE
 OUTLINED IN MARCH. WE ARE

01:16:32.214 --> 01:16:35.729
CONDUCTING ROLLING REVIEWS AT
 THE UA SUBMISSIONS SO THAT WE

01:16:36.104 --> 01:16:39.989
 CAN QUICKLY AUTHORIZE THE TESTS
 AND DATA SUPPORTS. THE ACCURACY

01:16:40.234 --> 01:16:43.229
 IN THE TESTING IS IMPORTANT NOT
 ONLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT

01:16:43.634 --> 01:16:45.634
 BUT FOR THE PATIENT AT LARGE 
AND

01:16:45.879 --> 01:16:49.103
THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. FDA IS
 HELPING TO ENSURE THE TESTS 

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:51.460
THAT
 ARE PROVIDING THE ACCURATE

01:16:51.704 --> 01:16:56.044
ANSWERS. WE'RE ALSO MONITORING
 THE MARKETPLACE FOR FRAUDULENT

01:16:56.314 --> 01:16:59.679
 AND TAKE TAKING APPROPRIATE
 ACTION FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH,

01:16:59.924 --> 01:17:05.133
 AND WE'RE WORKING FOR MORE
 CLARITY ON WHICH TESTS HAVE 

01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:07.113
BEEN
 REVIEWED AND WHICH HAVE NOT. IT

01:17:07.114 --> 01:17:10.655
 WILL PLAY A ROLL IN

01:17:15.666 --> 01:17:18.471
THE RECOVERY
 UNLIKE THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHEN

01:17:18.921 --> 01:17:22.451
 THE BODY IS LIKE COVID-19.
 THESE TESTS CAN IDENTIFY THE

01:17:22.711 --> 01:17:24.711
 INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN OVERCOME 
AN

01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:29.781
INFECTION AND HAVE DEVELOPED AN
 IMMUNE RESPONSE. WE WILL

01:17:30.031 --> 01:17:32.741
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LABS
 AND MANUFACTURES AND ACROSS THE

01:17:32.991 --> 01:17:37.001
 GOVERNMENT FIND ONE THAT THE
 TEST IS ACCURATE IN A TIMELY

01:17:37.261 --> 01:17:40.271
 ACCESS FOR SUCH TESTS. OF
 COURSE, THE WAY THAT WE WILL

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:47.181
 BEAT THIS VIRUS IS WITH A
 VACCINE. WE'RE WORKING WITH NIH

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:50.292
 AND VACCINE DEVELOPERS AND
 PANNING FRACTURES AND EXPERTS

01:17:50.531 --> 01:17:56.851
 ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE INTEND TO
 USE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HELP

01:17:57.081 --> 01:18:00.416
INSURE THE MOST FISHLTD
 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAFE AND

01:18:00.661 --> 01:18:03.676
AFFECTIVE VACCINE TO PREVENT
 COVID-19. UNTIL THE VACCINE IS

01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:08.521
 APPROVED, HOWEVER, WE NEED THE
 MEDICAL PRODUCTS TO BRIDGE THE

01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:17.191
 GAPS. THE FDA IS WORKING NOR
 MONTHS FOR THE, AND WE HAVE

01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:20.210
CREATED AN EMERGENCY BRAMANTE
 FOR THIS ACCELERATION CALLED 

01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:22.223
THE
 CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT

01:18:22.471 --> 01:18:24.900
ACCELERATION PROGRAM OR CTAT.
 WE HAVE RE-ASSIGNED THE STAFF 

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:26.627
TO
 WORK WITH THE URGENCY AND 

01:18:26.628 --> 01:18:28.492
REVIEW
 THE REQUESTS AND COMPANIES AND

01:18:28.493 --> 01:18:32.301
 SCIENTISTS AND DOCTORS THAT ARE
 DEVELOPING THERAPIES, AND WE'RE

01:18:32.681 --> 01:18:35.871
 USING EVERY AVAILABILITY
 AUTHORITY AND FLEXIBILITY 

01:18:35.872 --> 01:18:37.511
THAT'S
 APPROPRIATE TO FACILITATE THE

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:40.787
 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAFE AND
 AFFECTIVE PRODUCTS TO TREAT

01:18:41.032 --> 01:18:47.511
COVID-19. A VARIETY OF THE
 AREAS ARE BEING EVALUATED AS

01:18:48.446 --> 01:18:53.601
 MENTIONED AND THEN THE 
ANTIVIRAL

01:18:53.851 --> 01:18:56.412
DRUGS AND THEN THE
 HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE. AS DR.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:19:00.841
FAUCI SAID WE HAVE THE POSITIVE
 RESULTS TESTIFY TRIAL AND 

01:19:00.842 --> 01:19:04.851
ISSUED
 AN EUA FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE

01:19:05.102 --> 01:19:08.602
 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS FOR
 COVID-19. TWO OTHER PROMISING

01:19:08.842 --> 01:19:12.222
 TRIPLEDS ARE THE RICH PRODUCTS
 AND PLASMA AND I AM CERTAINLY

01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:17.291
 WILLING TO GO IN TO MORE DETAIL
 IF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 

01:19:17.292 --> 01:19:19.292
HAVE
 QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. WE ARE

01:19:19.302 --> 01:19:26.261
 WORKING VERY AGGRESSIVELY AND
 CLOSELY WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS 

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.931
TO
 FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:19:27.932 --> 01:19:31.882
 IS SHONE TO BE SAFE AND AIF HE
 CANNIVE AND COULD BE THE

01:19:32.128 --> 01:19:34.352
DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE. WE
 RECOGNIZE THAT DEVELOPING THE

01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:37.782
 VACCINES AND THERAPY NEED TO GO
 HAND AND HAND AND INSURING THAT

01:19:38.027 --> 01:19:39.741
 THEY WILL BE SUFFICIENT 
SUPPLIES

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:42.442
FOR THE COMPANIES AND THE
 COUNTRY, SO WE'RE ALSO WORKING

01:19:42.742 --> 01:19:46.812
 WITH MANUFACTURES TO MAKE SURE
 THAT THIS SUPPLY CHAIN IS

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:51.472
ROBUST. MR. CHAIRMAN, RANKING
 MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:19:51.722 --> 01:19:55.192
COMMITTEE, KNOW THAT THE FDA HAS
 SOME OF THE FINIST SCIENTISTS,

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.697
 HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND
 PROFESSIONALS. WE'RE GUIDED BY

01:19:57.942 --> 01:20:01.462
 THE SCIENCE AND DATA, AND WE
 WILL NOT LET UP UNTIL WE HAVE

01:20:01.852 --> 01:20:04.842
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTS
 THAT THE NATION NEEDS TO GET

01:20:05.082 --> 01:20:09.412
 BACK TO WORK. I LOOK FORWARD TO
 YOUR QUESTIONS.

01:20:09.962 --> 01:20:13.132
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DR. HAHN, AND
 THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERTISE AND

01:20:13.362 --> 01:20:16.862
 DEDICATION TO THE COUNTRY AND
 HARD WORK. WE WILL NOW BEGIN A

01:20:17.182 --> 01:20:22.952
 ROUND OF FIVE MINUTE QUESTIONS
 FROM EACH SENATOR ON THE

01:20:23.202 --> 01:20:25.202
COMMITTEE ALTERNATING BETWEEN
 REPUBLICANS

01:20:27.852 --> 01:20:30.982
AND DEMOCRATS. EACH
 SENATOR HAS A TIME CLOCK AT THE

01:20:31.242 --> 01:20:34.052
 BOTTOM. I ASK YOU TO STAY
 WITHIN FIVE

01:20:50.823 --> 01:20:54.572
LET'S
 LOOK DOWN THE ROAD TO A FEW

01:20:54.833 --> 01:21:01.022
MONTHS. THERE'S THOUSANDS OF
 COLLEGES AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:04.035
WELCOMING 50 MILLION STUDENTS
 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE

01:21:04.282 --> 01:21:07.093
CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
 TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE OR THE

01:21:07.339 --> 01:21:10.872
PRINCIPAL OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL
 ABOUT HOW TO PERSUADE PARENTS

01:21:11.123 --> 01:21:15.192
 AND STUDENTS THAT ARE PREPARING
 FOR SCHOOL IN AUGUST? LET'S

01:21:16.412 --> 01:21:19.843
START WITH TREATMENTS AND
 VACCINES FIRST, DR. FAUCI. IF

01:21:20.712 --> 01:21:25.503
 WE COULD SAVE A FEW MINUTES FOR
 GIOR FOR TESTING.

01:21:25.782 --> 01:21:30.943
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD
 BE VERY REALISTIC AND SAY WHEN

01:21:31.202 --> 01:21:32.661
 WE'RE IN TERMS --

01:21:32.662 --> 01:21:34.612
&gt;&gt; IT'S A HER IN THIS CASE.

01:21:34.613 --> 01:21:39.693
&gt;&gt; I WOULD TELL HER IN THIS CASE
 THAT THE IDEA OF HAVING

01:21:39.952 --> 01:21:42.972
TREATMENTS AVAILABLE OR A
 VACCINE TO FACILITATE THE 

01:21:42.973 --> 01:21:46.573
REEENT
 INDUSTRY OF STUDENTS IN TO THE

01:21:46.913 --> 01:21:50.373
 FALL TERM WOULD BE SOMETHING
 THAT WOULD BE A BIT OF A BRIDGE

01:21:50.753 --> 01:21:56.052
 TOO FAR. AS I MENTIONED, THE
 DRUG THAT'S SHONE SOME DEGREE 

01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:58.733
OF
 WAS MODEST AND IN A HOSPITAL

01:21:58.993 --> 01:22:03.233
 LOSED PATIENTS. NOT YET OR
 MAYBE YET TO BE USED EITHER YET

01:22:03.513 --> 01:22:08.423
 AS A TREATMENT. IF THE ISSUE IS
 THAT THE YOUNG INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:22:08.683 --> 01:22:12.393
 WOULD BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL
 WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME COMFORT

01:22:12.813 --> 01:22:19.033
 AND THERE'S A TREATMENT,
 PROBABLY THE THING THAT YOU

01:22:19.283 --> 01:22:24.102
WOULD BE CLOSEST TO UTILIZATION
 WOULD BE LIKELY THE 

01:22:24.103 --> 01:22:25.812
CONVALESCENT
 SERUM. WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:22:25.813 --> 01:22:28.523
NECESSARILY OF TREATING A
 STUDENT THAT GETS ILL, BUT HOW

01:22:28.783 --> 01:22:30.783
 THE STUDENT WILL FEEL SAFE

01:22:34.213 --> 01:22:36.213
IN
 GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. IF THIS

01:22:36.358 --> 01:22:39.833
 IS A SITUATION THAT WE HAD THE
 VACCINE, THAT WOULD BE THE END

01:22:40.093 --> 01:22:44.463
 OF THE ISSUE IN A POSITIVE WAY.
 AS I SAID IN THE OPENING

01:22:44.863 --> 01:22:48.393
REMARKS, EVEN AT THE TOP SPEED
 THAT I'M GOING, WE DON'T SEE A

01:22:48.638 --> 01:22:51.293
 VACCINE PLAYING IN THE
 INDIVIDUALS TO GET BACK TO

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:55.283
SCHOOL THIS TERM. WHAT THEY
 REALLY WANT IS TO KNOW IF

01:22:55.543 --> 01:22:58.503
THEY'RE SAFE. THAT'S THE
 QUESTION THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:22:59.353 --> 01:23:03.413
 DUE WITH WHAT WE DISCUSSED
 EARLIER ON THE TESTING. I AM

01:23:03.663 --> 01:23:07.763
 ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE
 REMARKS AND WOULD LIKE TO AND

01:23:08.013 --> 01:23:11.913
 WHO WOULD ADDRESS THE QUESTION
 AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:15.767
TESTING AND WHAT ROLE THAT MIGHT
 PLAY IN RETURNING TO THE 

01:23:15.768 --> 01:23:16.402
SCHOOL.

01:23:16.403 --> 01:23:19.233
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DR. FAUCI. YOU

01:23:22.393 --> 01:23:27.379
SAID WHILE WE'RE DOING ABOUT TEN
 MILLION TESTS THIS MONTH, WE'RE

01:23:27.633 --> 01:23:31.613
 DOING 50 MILLION BY SEPTEMBER A
 MONTH. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:23:31.853 --> 01:23:35.273
INCREASE. IF I AM THE
 CHANCELLOR OF UNIVERSITY OF

01:23:35.523 --> 01:23:38.604
TENNESSEE, COULD I DEVELOP A
 STRATEGY THAT I CAN SAY THAT WE

01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:42.064
 HAVE A TEST THAT'S QUICK AND
 EASY? DO YOU WANT EVERYBODY ON

01:23:42.303 --> 01:23:47.613
 CAMPUS TO COME BY AND TAKE IT
 ONCE BEFORE YOU START SCHOOL. I

01:23:47.924 --> 01:23:50.914
 WOULD LET EVERYBODY KNOW ON 
THAT

01:23:51.243 --> 01:23:54.044
DAY THAT WE HAVE ISOLATED ANYONE
 THAT'S POSITIVE AND CONTINUE TO

01:23:54.293 --> 01:23:56.293
 MONITOR. IS THAT STRATEGY
 POSSIBLE IN

01:24:00.194 --> 01:24:01.573
AUGUST AND
 SEPTEMBER?

01:24:01.574 --> 01:24:04.073
&gt;&gt; SO THANK YOU.  I WILL GIVE 20
SECONDS TO

01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:08.213
DR.

01:24:11.224 --> 01:24:13.748
RED FIELD AS
 WELL. IF THERE'S A HIGH SPREAD,

01:24:13.993 --> 01:24:20.254
 IT WILL ALSO BE DIFFERENT. YES,
 TECHNICALLY WE HAVE AND THERE'S

01:24:20.564 --> 01:24:25.364
 THE ABILITY AND WE EXPECT THERE
 TO BE 25 TO 30 POINTS AVAILABLE

01:24:25.604 --> 01:24:29.913
 AND CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO TEST
 ALL OF THE STUDENTS OR IT'S 

01:24:29.914 --> 01:24:32.503
MUCH
 MORE LIKELY THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:24:32.774 --> 01:24:37.044
 A SURVEILLANT STRATEGY DONE AND
 YOU MAY TEST THE STUDENTS AT

01:24:37.404 --> 01:24:40.814
 DIFFERENT TIMES TO GIVE THE
 ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S NO

01:24:41.064 --> 01:24:43.914
CIRCULATION AND THAT'S DONE WITH
 THE LOCAL CDC AND HEALTH

01:24:44.154 --> 01:24:46.964
DEPARTMENT. THERE'S A STRATEGY
 THAT'S NEED TO BE VALIDATED AND

01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:51.554
 THEN THE POOLING SAMPLES. WE
 KNOW IN THE LABS AS MANY AS TEN

01:24:51.804 --> 01:24:55.064
 OR 20 SAMPLES WILL BE PULLED 
AND

01:24:55.314 --> 01:24:58.454
THEN ONE TEST CAN TEST 20
 STUDENTS. FINALLY, THERE'S AN

01:24:59.064 --> 01:25:03.374
 APPROACH THAT LOOKS INTERESTING
 AND PROMISING THAT FOR EXAMPLE

01:25:04.274 --> 01:25:08.590
 THE WASTE WATER FROM AN ENTIRE
 DORM COULD BE TESTED TO

01:25:08.834 --> 01:25:11.894
DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S
 CORONAVIRUS IN THAT SEWAG

01:25:12.134 --> 01:25:17.434
SECTION WASTE WATER. THERE ARE
 OTHER STRATEGIES BEING

01:25:17.694 --> 01:25:21.024
DEVELOPED. AS WE GIVE
 20 SECONDS TO DR. RED IF HE

01:25:21.274 --> 01:25:25.954
WOULD THAT'S WORKING ON THE
 STELLATAE GEE FOR THE COMMUNITY

01:25:26.314 --> 01:25:27.663
 SPREAD.

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:30.163
&gt;&gt; DR. RED FIELD.

01:25:30.164 --> 01:25:32.664
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK THAT IT'S
 REALLY IMPORTANT TO EVALUATE

01:25:32.904 --> 01:25:35.794
 CRITICALLY THE ROLE OF THE
 CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL DISTANCING

01:25:36.034 --> 01:25:39.144
 ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND
 SCHOOLS AND SITUATIONS AND NOT

01:25:39.394 --> 01:25:41.394
 TO FORGET THE

01:25:45.434 --> 01:25:49.093
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT
 WE LEARN ED LEARNED.  I THINK 

01:25:49.094 --> 01:25:52.514
WE'RE GOING
 TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ROLE OF

01:25:52.784 --> 01:25:58.183
 TESTING. I THINK THERE'S AN
 IMPORTANT ROLE OF TESTING, AND 

01:25:58.184 --> 01:25:59.823
I
 THINK THAT IT'S INDIVIDUALIZED

01:25:59.824 --> 01:26:02.764
 BASED ON WHERE THE DIFFERENT
 SCHOOLS ARE AND HOW MUCH

01:26:03.004 --> 01:26:04.473
INFECTION IS IN THE AIR.

01:26:04.474 --> 01:26:08.678
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'M GOING TO WRAP IT UP
 THERE AND SET A GOOD EXAMPLE 

01:26:08.679 --> 01:26:10.679
FOR
 THE SENATORS WITH THE

01:26:14.295 --> 01:26:16.295
FIVE
 MINUTES. SENATOR MURRAY.

01:26:27.494 --> 01:26:30.215
OPEN TOO SOON. THE PRESIDENT IS
 SENDING THE OPPOSITE MESSAGE. I

01:26:30.509 --> 01:26:33.875
 WANT TO ASK YOU TODAY, WHAT IS
 THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT

01:26:34.114 --> 01:26:37.865
 YOU HAVE FOR COMMUNITIES AND
 STATES THAT ARE REOPENING EVEN

01:26:38.104 --> 01:26:42.135
 IF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS
 MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S TOO

01:26:42.374 --> 01:26:44.374
SOON. TELL US WHAT THE
 CONSEQUENCES ARE?

01:26:44.555 --> 01:26:48.744
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE
 QUESTION SENATOR MURRAY. AS I

01:26:48.994 --> 01:26:52.215
 HAVE SAID MANY TIMES WHAT WE
 HAVE WORKED OUT IS A GUIDELINE

01:26:52.945 --> 01:26:54.945
 OF FRAME WORK AND

01:26:57.735 --> 01:27:01.135
HOW YOU SAFELY
 OPEN AMERICA AGAIN. THERE ARE

01:27:01.505 --> 01:27:05.395
 SEVERAL CHECKPOINTS OF THAT AND
 THEN DEPENDING ON THE DYNAMICS

01:27:05.745 --> 01:27:07.885
 OF AN OUTBREAK IN THE REGION

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:14.895
AND
 STATE AND CITY AND REGION

01:27:23.085 --> 01:27:25.855
AND I
 GET CONCERN IF THERE'S A

01:27:26.115 --> 01:27:32.045
SITUATION AND SUCH THAT YOU'RE
 NOT SEEING THAT GRADUAL OVER

01:27:32.285 --> 01:27:34.285
 14-DAY INCREASE THAT WOULD 
ALLOW

01:27:34.325 --> 01:27:41.034
YOU TO GO TO APHASE ONE AND THEN
 IF YOU GO TO PHASE TWO AND 

01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:43.495
PHASE
 THREE AND THEN I SAY GAIN THAT

01:27:43.815 --> 01:27:50.965
 THERE'S CONCERNS OF THE AREAS
 AND CITY STATES AND JUMP OVER

01:27:51.325 --> 01:27:54.085
 THE VARIOUS CHECKPOINTS AND
 PREMATURELY OPEN UP WITHOUT

01:27:54.485 --> 01:27:58.231
HAVING THE CAPABILITY OF BEING
 ABLE TO RESPOND AND EFFECTIVELY

01:27:58.475 --> 01:28:02.884
 AND WE WILL START TO SEE THE
 LITTLE SPIKES THAT MIGHT TURN 

01:28:02.885 --> 01:28:04.885
IN
 TO OUTBREAKS. I AM BEING VERY

01:28:05.265 --> 01:28:10.280
 CLEAR IN MY MESSAGE TO TRY TO
 FOR THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE TO

01:28:10.515 --> 01:28:15.215
 GO BY THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE
 WELL THOUGHT OUT AND.

01:28:15.475 --> 01:28:20.745
&gt;&gt; SO IF THE COMMUNITY OR A
 STATE OR REGION CAUSE NOT GO BY

01:28:21.025 --> 01:28:24.666
 THE GUIDELINES AND REOPENS, IF
 CONSEQUENCES COULD BE PRETTY

01:28:25.025 --> 01:28:27.694
 DARK, CORRECT?

01:28:27.695 --> 01:28:32.354
&gt;&gt; THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE
 REALLY SERIOUS PARTICULARLY, 

01:28:32.355 --> 01:28:34.234
AND
 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE 

01:28:34.235 --> 01:28:36.235
SHOULD
 PAY ATTENTION TO. THE STATES

01:28:36.305 --> 01:28:41.125
 EVEN IF THEY'RE DOING IT AS AN
 APPROPRIATE PACE AND MANY OF

01:28:41.385 --> 01:28:45.105
 THEM ARE AND WILL AND MAINLY A
 PACE THAT'S COMING IN TO IT AND

01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:50.416
 THE DYNAMIC OF THE OUTBREAK,
 THEY HAVE IN PLACE ALREADY THE

01:28:51.005 --> 01:28:53.905
 CAPABILITY WHEN THERE'S CASES
 AND THERE'S NO DOUBT EVEN UNDER

01:28:54.155 --> 01:28:58.795
 THE BEST OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
 WHEN YOU PULL BACK ON THE

01:28:59.046 --> 01:29:02.136
MITIGATION, YOU WILL SEE SOME
 CASES APPEAR. IT'S THE ABILITY

01:29:02.435 --> 01:29:05.059
 AND THE CAPABILITY OF 
RESPONDING

01:29:05.305 --> 01:29:08.574
TO THOSE CASES WITH GOOD
 IDENTIFICATION AND ISOLATION 

01:29:08.575 --> 01:29:10.364
AND
 CONTEXT TRACING. THAT THE WILL

01:29:10.365 --> 01:29:13.485
 DETERMINE WHETHER YOU CAN
 CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD

01:29:17.926 --> 01:29:20.066
AS YOU
 TRY TO REOPEN AMERICA TEST NOT

01:29:20.305 --> 01:29:24.625
 ONLY DOING IT, BUT HAVING IN
 PLACE THE CAPABILITY OF

01:29:24.886 --> 01:29:26.886
RESPONDING WHEN

01:29:30.336 --> 01:29:32.336
THE RETURN OF
 THE INFECTIONS OCCUR.

01:29:32.466 --> 01:29:34.466
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. THAT'S CLEAR.  IN 
ORDER TO DO THAT

01:29:35.606 --> 01:29:40.096
, WE HAVE TO
 KNOW ABOUT TESTING. THE

01:29:41.435 --> 01:29:43.756
ADMINISTRATIONS TESTS IS BY
 DISREGARD FOR SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS

01:29:43.996 --> 01:29:48.545
 WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. LAST
 WEEK AN AVERAGE OF 250,000 

01:29:48.546 --> 01:29:50.546
TESTS
 A DAY WERE PERFORMED IN THE

01:29:50.796 --> 01:29:54.116
UNITED STATES. THAT'S A SMALL
 FRACTION OF WHAT WE NEED.

01:29:54.366 --> 01:29:58.425
YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD
 THE GAL TO SAY THAT WE 

01:29:58.426 --> 01:30:00.677
PREVAILED
 ON TESTING IN A PRESS 

01:30:00.678 --> 01:30:05.126
CONFERENCE
 THAT WAS FILLED WITH MY

01:30:05.376 --> 01:30:07.946
INFORMATION AND DESTRUCTION.
 DR. GIOR, PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS

01:30:08.206 --> 01:30:14.166
 DO NOT THINK THAT THE U.S. HAS
 PREVAILED. I AM GLAD THAT MY

01:30:14.656 --> 01:30:20.957
 STATE OF WASHINGTON STATE WILL
 MEET THE MAY AND JUNE. THIS

01:30:21.856 --> 01:30:24.476
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN GIVEN US
 BROKEN PROMISES ON THAT MORE

01:30:24.726 --> 01:30:29.186
 TESTING IS COMING AND IT DOES
 NOT. WE KNOW THAT TESTING IS

01:30:29.546 --> 01:30:32.186
 GOING TO PERSIST LONG AND SO

01:30:37.206 --> 01:30:39.356
I
 WANT TO ASK YOU TODAY WILL THE

01:30:39.596 --> 01:30:42.825
 PLAN THAT'S NOW REQUIRED UNDER
 THE PACKAGE THAT WAS JUST 

01:30:42.826 --> 01:30:44.956
PASSED
 INSIDE OF THE LAW,

01:30:49.966 --> 01:30:53.196
WILL THAT
 PLAN ON TESTING INCLUDE TARGETS

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:56.516
 FOR

01:30:57.926 --> 01:30:59.926
TESTING CAPACITY AND
 PROJECTION SHORTAGES.

01:30:59.931 --> 01:31:03.541
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION
 AND STATEMENT SENATOR MURRAY.

01:31:03.836 --> 01:31:11.366
 YES, WE'RE AS WE STATED WE WILL
 CONTINUE HAVE HAVE A WORK IN

01:31:11.876 --> 01:31:14.626
 PROCESS AS WE BUILD THE
 CAPACITY. WE HAVE 12 MILLION

01:31:14.876 --> 01:31:18.396
 TESTS OVER THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS.
 WE THINK THAT THE TARGETS WILL

01:31:18.646 --> 01:31:24.496
 BE GOOD IN MAY AND JUNE. AS DR.
 FAUCI SAID WE HAVE TO BE

01:31:24.726 --> 01:31:27.927
EVIDENCE BASE. WE EXPECT THE
 TARGETS TO GO UP AS WE

01:31:28.176 --> 01:31:30.680
PROGRESSIVELY OPEN IT AS THE
 COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH PHASE 

01:31:30.681 --> 01:31:32.826
ONE
 AND THEN IN TO PHASE TWO.

01:31:33.076 --> 01:31:37.136
CERTAINLY THE NUMBERS WILL NEED
 TO GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY AGAIN IN

01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:40.776
 THE FALL WHEN WE HAVE THE FLU
 CIRCUMSTANCE LATING WITH COVID.

01:31:41.016 --> 01:31:44.936
 YES, THERE WILL BE TARGETS. THE
 TARTHS WILL NEED TO CHANGE 

01:31:44.937 --> 01:31:47.307
BASED
 ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE SEE.

01:31:47.686 --> 01:31:53.916
 WE'RE HIGHLY COMMITTED TO
 SECURING THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND 

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:55.768
WE
 WORK DAILY WITH THE

01:31:55.769 --> 01:31:59.027
MANUFACTURER. I AM PLEASED THAT
 WE'RE ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE

01:31:59.287 --> 01:32:02.746
 STATES AND WE CAN SUPPLY THEM
 WHAT THEY NEED AND THEY HAVE 

01:32:02.747 --> 01:32:03.895
THE
 ASSURANCES.

01:32:03.896 --> 01:32:07.446
&gt;&gt; MY THING TO YOU IS WHEN YOU
 PUT OUT THAT SPECIFIC PLAN THAT

01:32:07.687 --> 01:32:10.667
 YOU WERE REQUIRE TODAY DO, WE
 WILL SEE NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE

01:32:10.907 --> 01:32:15.107
 GOING TO TELL US THAT YOU WILL
 REACH AND TARGETED FOR TESTING

01:32:15.357 --> 01:32:18.541
 AND SUPPLY CHANGE CAPACITY AND
 INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING THAT WE

01:32:18.797 --> 01:32:20.797
 HOPE TO HAVE A MILLION THIS 
WEEK

01:32:20.997 --> 01:32:23.827
AND NEXT WEEK, YOU WILL GIVE US
 THE SPECIFIC TARGETS, CORRECT?

01:32:26.912 --> 01:32:31.557
 MA'AM, WE KNOW THE SPECIFICS
 AMOUNT OF TESTS THAT WE HAVE

01:32:31.877 --> 01:32:33.201
 OVER THE SUMMER.

01:32:33.202 --> 01:32:40.317
&gt;&gt; NOT HAVE BUT HOW MANY WE
 NEED.

01:32:40.577 --> 01:32:45.597
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. WE HAVE THEM BY
 WORK BEING THE STATES AND THE

01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:49.812
 CDC, SO THAT OVERALL IN MAY WE
 WILL BE TESTING ABOUT 3.9% OF

01:32:50.047 --> 01:32:51.276
 THE U.S. POPULATION.

01:32:51.277 --> 01:32:54.797
&gt;&gt; THAT'S FINE. WHAT I AM
 TELLING YOU --

01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:57.037
&gt;&gt; WE'RE OVER TIME SENATOR
 MURRAY.

01:32:57.157 --> 01:33:00.877
&gt;&gt; NOT HOW MANY WE WILL NEED BUT
 IN THE COMING MONTHS SO THAT WE

01:33:01.107 --> 01:33:03.116
 CAN BE PREPARED TO HAVE THEM.

01:33:03.117 --> 01:33:07.397
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. NOT TO BE
 REPETITIVE, BUT WE NEED TO BE

01:33:07.727 --> 01:33:11.127
 EVIDENCE IN DATA DRIVEN BECAUSE
 WHAT WE MAY SEE IN MAY OR JUNE

01:33:11.383 --> 01:33:14.067
 IS GOING TO DRIVE THE
 DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:33:14.307 --> 01:33:17.857
 TEST GOALS THAT WE HAVE. WE
 REALLY JUST NEED TO BE VERY

01:33:18.107 --> 01:33:21.302
HUMBLE ABOUT THIS AND LOOK AT
 THE DATA. WE KNOW THAT THE

01:33:21.547 --> 01:33:24.599
TESTING NEEDS WILL GO UP OVER
 MAY AND JUNE AS WE 

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.237
PROGRESSIVELY
 OPEN. WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:31.856
 PREDICT THAT. WE HAVE TO SEE
 WHAT THE DATA AND EVIDENCE 

01:33:31.857 --> 01:33:33.296
SHOWS
 AT THAT TIME.

01:33:33.297 --> 01:33:35.076
&gt;&gt; OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT.  MR.
CHAIRMAN AGAIN WHAT THE

01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:37.077
PLAN
 REQUIRES IS WHAT IS THE GOAL.

01:33:37.172 --> 01:33:40.647
 NOT HOW MUCH WE HAVE, BUT HOW
 MANY WE NEED. THAT'S WHAT WE

01:33:40.887 --> 01:33:42.907
 WILL BE LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR MURRAY

01:33:47.847 --> 01:33:49.847
.

01:34:03.978 --> 01:34:07.022
FUTURE, TOO. I THINK THAT WE
 HAVE EARNED A LOT. WE'RE

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:10.438
FIGHTING A VIRUS AT THE SAME
 TIME AND THE SCIENTISTS ARE

01:34:10.687 --> 01:34:15.386
LEARNING ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO
 BE NIMBLE AND WE NEED TO BE 

01:34:15.387 --> 01:34:17.266
SURE
 THAT WE'RE PREPARED FOR A 

01:34:17.267 --> 01:34:18.996
SECOND
 WAVE OF OUTBREAKS THAT COULD

01:34:18.997 --> 01:34:22.168
 COINCIDE WITH THE START OF THE
 FLU SEASON AND POTENTIALLY

01:34:22.552 --> 01:34:27.288
STRESSING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
 EVEN MORE THAN IT ALREADY HAS

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:28.247
 BEEN.

01:34:28.248 --> 01:34:32.957
&gt;&gt; I THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS
 AND I THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:34:33.218 --> 01:34:35.217
 COMFORTING ON WHAT HAS BEEN 
DONE

01:34:35.218 --> 01:34:40.247
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE. I AGREE
 WITH SENATOR MURRAY THAT WE 

01:34:40.248 --> 01:34:44.677
NEED
 TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC GOALS. AS

01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:47.618
 AN ACCOUNTANT, THAT'S ONE OF 
THE

01:34:47.868 --> 01:34:54.368
THINGS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR.
 DR. HAHN, THE CLINICAL PICTURE

01:34:54.768 --> 01:34:56.768
 OF COVID-19 CONTINUES TO 
EVOLVE.

01:34:56.928 --> 01:35:01.668
WHAT FIRST LOOKED LIKE A
 RESPIRATORY ILLNESS SEEMS MORE

01:35:03.595 --> 01:35:07.058
 COMP REHENCIVE AND POTENTIALLY
 AFFECTING THE BRAIN, KIDNEY AND

01:35:07.508 --> 01:35:12.998
 OTHER ORGANS, HOW DOES THIS
 EVOLVING PICTURE IMPACT THE

01:35:13.238 --> 01:35:15.238
CLINICAL OR SURROGATE REVIEW

01:35:18.768 --> 01:35:20.437
OF
 THE VACCINES AND TREATMENTS?

01:35:22.511 --> 01:35:26.398
QUESTION. THE EVOLVING PICTURE
 AND THE WAY THAT THIS IS

01:35:26.658 --> 01:35:28.658
MANIFESTING AROUND

01:35:31.608 --> 01:35:33.608
THE COUNTRY
 CLINICALLY DOES IN FACT

01:35:50.958 --> 01:35:53.571
WE HAVE
 THE ACCELERATION PROGRAM AND 

01:35:53.572 --> 01:35:55.507
THE
 TOP SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN AT THE

01:35:55.508 --> 01:35:58.208
 TABLE CONSULT BEING THE
 COLLEAGUES AT

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.880
NIH TO ADDRESS THE
 QUESTIONS.

01:36:08.738 --> 01:36:13.057
SOME PATIENT THAT IS
 HAD SEVERE COVID-19 HAD 

01:36:13.058 --> 01:36:15.058
CLOTTING
 EPISODES. WE PRIORITIZED THE

01:36:15.098 --> 01:36:18.943
 REVIEW OF THE AGENTS THAT WE
 THINK MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL AND

01:36:19.268 --> 01:36:21.328
 THE CLINICAL END POINTS OF 
THOSE

01:36:21.568 --> 01:36:26.218
TRIALS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ONE
 THAT'S A VIRAL WHERE DR. FAUCI

01:36:26.453 --> 01:36:29.658
 SAYS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A
 TIME OF RECOVERY. WE WANT TO

01:36:29.928 --> 01:36:31.978
 ADAPT IT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
AS

01:36:32.248 --> 01:36:35.738
WELL AS THE TYPE OF THERAPY
 THAT'S PUT BEFORE US.

01:36:36.018 --> 01:36:41.488
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. ANOTHER QUESTION
 TO DR. HAHN, WE HAVE MADE A LOT

01:36:41.893 --> 01:36:45.918
 OF PROGRESS IN THE VACCINE
 DEVELOPMENT. THEY HAVE IDENTIFY

01:36:46.748 --> 01:36:51.317
 THAT HAD THE IS A SIGNIFICANT
 GAP IN THE PANDEMIC 

01:36:51.318 --> 01:36:56.019
PREPAIDNESS.
 WHAT HAS HHS DONE IN ADVANCE OF

01:36:56.278 --> 01:36:58.689
 THE POTENTIAL AND NATIONAL
 DOCUMENTATION CAMPAIGN TO MAKE

01:36:58.948 --> 01:37:03.369
 SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT
 CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER THE

01:37:03.618 --> 01:37:04.112
VACCINE?

01:37:04.113 --> 01:37:07.189
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.
 THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:37:07.444 --> 01:37:10.609
POINT. AS YOU MENTIONED, IT'S
 NOT JUST ABOUT THE VACCINE OR

01:37:10.928 --> 01:37:14.089
 HOPEFULLY VACCINES THAT ARE
 DEVELOPED. IT'S ALL ABOUT

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:17.527
THE -- IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE
 SUPPLIES THAT ARE NEEDED AS 

01:37:17.528 --> 01:37:19.809
WELL
 AS THE OPERATIONAL PLAN AS WELL

01:37:20.049 --> 01:37:24.219
 AS ADMINISTERING THE VACCINES.
 THIS IS ALL IN THE GOVERNMENT

01:37:24.488 --> 01:37:28.939
 APPROACH. THERE'S A PROGRAM
 THAT'S BEEN SET UP ABOUT THE

01:37:29.638 --> 01:37:33.478
 WARP SPEED AND THAT'S DR. FAUCI
 AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 

01:37:33.479 --> 01:37:39.578
AS
 WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF HHS 

01:37:39.579 --> 01:37:41.798
AND
 DR. PETER FROM A SENATOR AND IS

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.959
 HELPING TO COORDINATE AND
 WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH DR.

01:37:45.209 --> 01:37:49.508
 FAUCI AND THE TEAM. WE HAVE A
 CHART TO LOOK FORWARD AND WHAT

01:37:50.029 --> 01:37:54.508
 ARE THE NECESSARY SUPPLY CHAIN
 ISSUES AND NEEDLES, ET CETERA 

01:37:54.509 --> 01:37:56.268
ON
 THE VARIOUS VACCINES THAT ARE

01:37:56.269 --> 01:37:59.364
 BEING DEVELOPED AND HOW MANY
 TIMES THEY HAVE TO BE DEVELOP

01:37:59.597 --> 01:38:01.829
 AND THE ROOT OF THE
 ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE LEANING

01:38:02.088 --> 01:38:04.679
 IN ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO 
INSURE

01:38:04.930 --> 01:38:08.658
WHEN A VACCINE IS READY GO, WE
 WILL HAVE THE NECESSARY 

01:38:08.659 --> 01:38:11.359
SUPPLIES
 TO ADMINISTER IT AND DO THE

01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:12.218
VACCINATION.

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:17.149
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE
 OF MORE QUESTIONS, BUT GAIN THE

01:38:17.399 --> 01:38:19.529
 CLOCK IS NOT VISIBLE THERE, SO 
I

01:38:19.769 --> 01:38:21.769
EXPECT THAT I AM AT MY TIME. I

01:38:25.869 --> 01:38:29.543
WILL SUBMIT THOSE IN WRITING.

01:38:29.544 --> 01:38:31.258
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SENATOR.

01:38:31.259 --> 01:38:32.268
&gt;&gt; SENATOR SANDERS.

01:38:32.269 --> 01:38:35.639
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME
 THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR

01:38:35.929 --> 01:38:37.929
 THE HARD WORK THAT THEY'RE 
DOING

01:38:37.994 --> 01:38:39.994
AND

01:38:42.359 --> 01:38:44.359
FOR BEING WITH US TODAY.

01:39:01.261 --> 01:39:04.324
 AND WHO FIRED THE MEMBERS OF 
THE

01:39:04.579 --> 01:39:07.019
GOVERNMENT THAT WANTED TO ACT
 AGGRESSIVELY AND THEN AMONG THE

01:39:07.269 --> 01:39:10.449
 OTHER THINGS AND THEN THE TIMES
 THAT WE NEED THE INTERNATIONAL

01:39:10.689 --> 01:39:13.903
 COOPERATION AND THEN THE 
FUNDING

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:16.359
FOR THE WORLD HEALTH
 ORGANIZATION. LET ME ALSO SAY

01:39:16.609 --> 01:39:18.609
 THAT I THINK THAT

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.360
WE UNDERSTAND
 THAT THE FACT S

01:39:46.009 --> 01:39:51.069
FACTS AND THERE'S SOME
 THAT AND THEN

01:39:55.516 --> 01:39:57.516
THERE'S 50% HIGHER
 THAN THAT.

01:40:00.299 --> 01:40:04.560
GE SOME SAY THAT THE
 NUMBER OF DEATHS ARE LIKELY

01:40:04.799 --> 01:40:10.520
HIGHER THAN THOSE NUMBERS.
 GIVEN THE SITUATION IN NEW YORK

01:40:10.761 --> 01:40:12.733
 CITY WHEN THEY WERE REALLY 
STRAP

01:40:12.734 --> 01:40:15.475
TODAY THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
 THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN PEOPLE

01:40:15.730 --> 01:40:21.194
 THAT DIED AT HOME WHO DID HAVE
 COVID THAT WERE NOT COUNTED AS

01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:24.343
 COVID BECAUSE THEY NEVER REALLY
 GOT TO THE HOSPITAL. A DIRECT

01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:28.380
 ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, I THINK
 THAT YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THE

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:33.760
 NUMBER IS LIKELY HIGHER. I
 DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENT HIGHER,

01:40:34.009 --> 01:40:36.009
 BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY IT'S
 HIGHER.

01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:45.500
&gt;&gt; DR. FAUCI, LET ME ASK YOU
 THIS. IN THE TERRIBLE

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.530
PANDEMIC
 OF 1918 THE VIRUS EXPLODED IN

01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:55.690
 THE FALL AND CAME BACK WITH A
 SLAVEN GANZ. ARE WE FEARFUL

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:59.549
THAT IF WE DO NOT GET THE ACT
 TOGETHER AS BAD AS THE 

01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:03.069
SITUATION
 IS NOW, IT COULD BE WORSE IN 

01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:04.039
THE
 FALL?

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.728
&gt;&gt; WELL, SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR
 THAT QUESTION. IT'S A

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.240
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION. I
 THINK THAT THE POSSIBILITY DOES

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:15.440
 EXIST. HOWEVER, THE REASON THAT
 I SAY IS THAT THE WHEN YOU TALK

01:41:15.925 --> 01:41:19.420
 ABOUT WILL THIS VIRUS JUST
 DISAPPEAR, AND AS I HAVE SAID

01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:23.620
 MANY TIMES, THAT'S NOT GOING TO
 HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S A HIGHLY

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.852
 TRANS MISSABLE VIRUS. EVEN IF
 WE GET THE BETTER CONTROL OVER

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:32.250
 THE SINGLE MONTHS, IT'S LIKELY
 THAT THERE WILL BE A VIRUS

01:41:32.490 --> 01:41:34.490
SOMEWHERE ON THIS PLANET THAT
 WILL

01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:42.000
EVENTUALLY GET BACK TO US.
 MY APPROACH OF A REBOUND FOR A

01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:45.914
 SECOND WAVE IN THE FALL IS THAT
 IT'S CON SEIZABLE AND 

01:41:45.915 --> 01:41:47.980
IMPOSSIBLE
 THAT IT'S GROG HAPPEN, AND B I

01:41:48.265 --> 01:41:51.730
 WOULD HOPE THAT BETWEEN NOW AND
 THEN, GIVEN THE CAPABILITY OF

01:41:52.174 --> 01:41:54.174
 DOING THE

01:41:57.885 --> 01:42:02.820
TESTING THAT YOU HEARD
 FROM ADMIRAL GIOR AND THE

01:42:03.171 --> 01:42:06.970
WORKFORCE THAT THE CDC UNDER DR.
 REDFIELD THAT THEY'RE PUTTING

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.820
 FORTH TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY 
AND

01:42:10.101 --> 01:42:14.070
ISOLATE CONTRACT TRACE, I HOPE
 IF WE DO HAVE THE THREAT OF A

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:18.719
 SECOND WAVE, WE WILL BE ABLE TO
 DEAL WITH IT VERY AFFECTIVELY 

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.150
TO
 PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING AN

01:42:21.402 --> 01:42:24.001
OUTBREAK NOT ONLY WORSE THAN NOW
 BUT MUCH LESS.

01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:26.250
&gt;&gt; OKAY. LET ME ASK.  WE HAVE 
HEARD A LOT

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:30.701
ABOUT THE VACCINES
 AND OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY IN

01:42:30.951 --> 01:42:36.321
CONGRESS AND THIS COUNTRY WANTS
 A VACCINE AND WE WANT IT AS

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.900
QUICKLY AS PAS SXBL AFFECTIVE AS
 POSSIBLE. LET ME ASK THE

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.515
HONORABLE. IF GOD WILLING A
 VACCINE IS DEVELOPED AND IF

01:42:43.761 --> 01:42:46.981
WE'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE IT AS
 QUICKLY AS WE ALL HOPE THAT WE

01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:51.581
 CAN, I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE
 VACCINE WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO

01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:55.441
 ALL PEOPLE FREE OF CHARGE. WE
 WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY

01:42:55.701 --> 01:43:01.461
 THAT NEEDS IT WILL GET IT
 REGARDLESS OF THE INCOME, IS

01:43:02.251 --> 01:43:05.210
 THAT A FAIR ASSUMPTION?

01:43:05.211 --> 01:43:11.131
&gt;&gt; SENATOR, I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
 FDA IS VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:15.311
 SURE THAT ALL POPULATIONS IN 
THE

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:19.031
UNITED STATES ARE INCLUDED IN
 THE CLINICAL TRIALS.

01:43:19.271 --> 01:43:23.761
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.
 WHAT I AM ASKING IS IF AND WHEN

01:43:24.211 --> 01:43:27.881
 THE VACCINE COMES, IT WON'T DO
 SOMEONE ANY GOOD IF THEY DON'T

01:43:28.111 --> 01:43:32.421
 GET IT. IF THEY HAVE TO PAY A
 SUM OF MONEY FOR IT IN ORDER TO

01:43:32.676 --> 01:43:34.881
 PROFIT FOR THE DRUG COMPANIES,
 THAT WILL

01:43:38.461 --> 01:43:41.200
NOT BE HELPFUL. YOU
 GUARANTEEING THE AMERICAN 

01:43:41.201 --> 01:43:43.221
PEOPLE
 TODAY THAT THE VACCINE IS

01:43:43.493 --> 01:43:46.091
AVAILABLE TO ALL PEOPLE
 REGARDLESS OF THE INCOME.

01:43:46.351 --> 01:43:48.901
&gt;&gt; SO THAT'S NOT A
 RESPONSIBILITY, BUT I'M GOING

01:43:49.171 --> 01:43:53.321
 TAKE THIS BACK TO THE TASK
 FORCE. I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT

01:43:53.561 --> 01:43:56.376
 THIS NEEDS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE
 TO EVERY AMERICAN.

01:43:56.616 --> 01:44:01.821
&gt;&gt; DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO
 COMMENT ON IT? DO YOU THINK

01:44:02.501 --> 01:44:09.351
THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THE VACCINE
 WHEN IT'S CREATED AVAILABLE TO

01:44:09.603 --> 01:44:12.366
 ALL RED'ARTLESS OF THE INCOME 
OR

01:44:12.611 --> 01:44:16.061
DO YOU THINK THAT THE HOMELESS
 SHOULD NOT HAVE THE VACCINE.

01:44:18.571 --> 01:44:19.910
YOU ASKING ME?

01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:22.120
&gt;&gt; YES, I WAS.

01:44:22.121 --> 01:44:26.610
&gt;&gt; NO, MY OFFICE IS ONE OF THE
 OFFICES COMMITTED TO SERVING 

01:44:26.611 --> 01:44:29.242
THE
 OWNS SERVED, AND WE NEED TO BE

01:44:30.071 --> 01:44:35.152
 ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT IF A
 VACCINE OR AN AFFECTIVE

01:44:35.421 --> 01:44:37.421
PREVENTIVE IS

01:44:40.368 --> 01:44:42.431
AVAILABLE, THAT IT
 REACHES ALL SOCIETIES WHETHER

01:44:42.671 --> 01:44:44.161
 THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY.

01:44:44.162 --> 01:44:48.286
&gt;&gt; GOOD. SO YOU'RE TELLING THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE TODAY THAT

01:44:48.521 --> 01:44:51.111
REGARDLESS OF INCOME, EVERY
 AMERICAN WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:53.617
 ACCESS TO THE VACCINE WHEN IT
 COMES?

01:44:53.861 --> 01:44:58.546
&gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD GAIN ACCESS TO
 IT. I DON'T CONTROL --

01:44:58.791 --> 01:45:00.791
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU REPRESENTED THE

01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:07.472
 ADMINISTRATION THAT MAKES THE
 DECISION.

01:45:07.851 --> 01:45:11.691
&gt;&gt; I WILL CERTAINLY ADVOCATE
 THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE 

01:45:11.692 --> 01:45:13.872
TO
 RECEIVE THE VACCINE REGARDLESS

01:45:14.331 --> 01:45:15.850
 OF THE INCOME.

01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:17.161
&gt;&gt; TIME-OUT SENATOR SANDERS.

01:45:17.162 --> 01:45:19.601
&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE IMPORTANT
 QUESTIONS. I DON'T WANT TO GET

01:45:19.842 --> 01:45:23.936
 THE SENATORS OFF, BUT IT'S HARD
 TO SEE THE TIME CLOCK BUT IF WE

01:45:24.212 --> 01:45:30.302
 CAN STAY CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO
 FIVE MIGHT BES, THEN ALL

01:45:30.547 --> 01:45:33.191
SENATORS CAN GET THE QUESTIONS
 IN. THANK YOU SENATOR STAND

01:45:33.431 --> 01:45:33.948
SANDERS.

01:45:33.949 --> 01:45:37.352
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU AND THE WITNESSES
 FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE

01:45:37.592 --> 01:45:40.512
 PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE
 SAFETY AND PEOPLE AROUND THE

01:45:40.771 --> 01:45:44.281
 GLOBE. LET ME ASK YOU BECAUSE
 YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE TASK FORCE

01:45:44.532 --> 01:45:47.702
 AND AT A MAJORITY OF THE PRESS
 CONFERENCES. HAS ANYONE ASKED

01:45:47.942 --> 01:45:51.882
 YOU OR ANY MEMBER TO TAKE THE
 FOOT OFF THE GAS OF TRYING TO

01:45:52.131 --> 01:45:57.572
 FIND A CURE OR ANY TYPE OF
 COUNTER MEASURE?

01:45:57.812 --> 01:46:02.272
&gt;&gt; NO, SENATOR. NOT AT ALL AS A
 MATTER OF FACT. WE HAVE BEEN

01:46:02.722 --> 01:46:07.892
 HERE FROM THE VERY BEGIN ASKING
 PUT THE RIGHT FOOT ON THE

01:46:08.178 --> 01:46:11.081
ACCELERATOR IN EVERY ASPECT AND
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 

01:46:11.082 --> 01:46:13.280
VACCINES.
 AS I HAVE DESCRIBE IN THE

01:46:13.572 --> 01:46:18.342
OPENING STATEMENT, WE ACTUALLY
 START THAT HAD IN JANUARY AND

01:46:18.592 --> 01:46:22.982
 LITERALLY DAYS AFTER THE VIRUS
 WAS KNOWN AND THE SEQUENCE

01:46:23.222 --> 01:46:26.172
PUBLISHED. I HAVE NOT BEEN
 KNOWN TO ANYONE TO PULL BACK ON

01:46:26.412 --> 01:46:30.062
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY COUNTER
 MEASURE OR THE BASIC AND

01:46:30.312 --> 01:46:32.622
RESEARCH PROJECT THAT WE HAVE
 BEEN INVOLVED IN.

01:46:32.902 --> 01:46:39.892
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DR. FAUCI. THIS IS
 FOR DR. REDFIELD. WE HAVE

01:46:40.132 --> 01:46:43.062
AUTHORIZED IN THIS COMMITTEE
 MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE LAST

01:46:43.312 --> 01:46:47.692
 DECADE THE MANLY FOR THE VIRUS,
 AND YOU TALKED ACT IT. IN THE

01:46:48.442 --> 01:46:53.022
 PAST THREE YEARS FROM FY16 TO
 FY20 THERE'S BEEN $23 MILLION A

01:46:53.262 --> 01:46:55.272
 YEAR AND WITH THE CARES ACT 
IT'S

01:46:55.532 --> 01:46:58.622
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS WITH THE
 SURVEILLANCE. WE HAVE SEEN THE

01:46:58.897 --> 01:47:05.842
 PRIVATE SECTOR GO OUT AND USE
 THE DATA AVAILABLE TO TRACK THE

01:47:06.082 --> 01:47:08.402
 PROGRESS AND THREAT OF
 CORONAVIRUS AROUND THE WORLD.

01:47:08.829 --> 01:47:11.412
 WHY IS CDC NOT CONTRACT WITH 
THE

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:18.263
PRIVATE SECTOR TECHNOLOGY
 COMPANIES TO TRY TO USE THEIR

01:47:18.612 --> 01:47:20.091
 TOOLS FOR BIO SURVEILLANCE?

01:47:20.092 --> 01:47:22.932
&gt;&gt; SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR THE
 QUESTION. THIS IS A CRITICAL

01:47:23.172 --> 01:47:25.942
 ISSUE AS YOU KNOW AND ALSO 
COMES

01:47:26.182 --> 01:47:29.972
IN TO ONE OF THE CORE
 CAPABILITIES THAT WE TALKED

01:47:30.212 --> 01:47:34.693
ABOUT WITH THE DATA ANALYTICS
 AND THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:47:34.932 --> 01:47:37.633
APPRECIATIVE IN THE FUNDING THAT
 CONGRESS HAS GIVEN. I CAN TELL

01:47:37.872 --> 01:47:41.432
 YOU THAT THIS IS UNDER A
 CRITICAL REVIEW NOW. WE DO HAVE

01:47:41.723 --> 01:47:45.891
 CONTRACTS WITH THE PRIVATE
 SECTOR GROUPS TO TRY TO MAKE 

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.851
THE
 TYPE OF AVAILABILITY AND DATA

01:47:47.852 --> 01:47:54.003
 THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN FLORIDA
 WITH ALL OF THE JURISDICTIONS

01:47:54.263 --> 01:47:58.302
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE
 PROCESS OF MAKING THAT HAPPEN.

01:48:01.142 --> 01:48:05.824
 OF LAST YEAR WE AUTHORIZED TO
 THE LEGISLATION AND THAT

01:48:06.073 --> 01:48:12.838
AUTHORIZED AT THAT TIME 30 NEW
 EMPLOYEES THAT THE CDC

01:48:13.083 --> 01:48:16.311
SPECIFICALLY IN SURVEILLANCE.
 NOW, I ASKED THE DOCTOR IN 

01:48:16.312 --> 01:48:18.403
MARCH
 HOW MUCH OF THOSE 30 WERE

01:48:18.643 --> 01:48:20.643
FILLED. SHE SAID ZERO.  AS OF 
MID-APRIL, ZERO OF

01:48:21.654 --> 01:48:25.483
THEM WERE
 FILLED. HOW MANY OF THOSE 30

01:48:25.752 --> 01:48:29.463
 EMPLOYEES THAT THIS COMMITTEE
 AUTHORIZED TO BRING ON IN THE

01:48:29.933 --> 01:48:31.662
 SURVEILLANCE AND HAS BEEN 
FILLED

01:48:31.663 --> 01:48:32.182
TODAY?

01:48:32.183 --> 01:48:38.059
&gt;&gt; SIR, GAIN THANK YOU FOR THE
 QUESTION. I KNOW THE STAFF HAS

01:48:38.983 --> 01:48:42.042
 BEEN IN DISCUSSION SINCE THE
 TESTIMONY, AND I KNOW THAT 

01:48:42.043 --> 01:48:44.043
WE'RE
 IN THE PROCESS OF CONTINUING

01:48:48.053 --> 01:48:51.493
TO
 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:48:56.503 --> 01:48:59.673
TO MOVE
 THAT FORWARD.

01:49:00.083 --> 01:49:03.792
&gt;&gt; I BROUGHT IT TO LIGHT IN THE
 FIRST OF MARCH, AND NOW WE'RE 

01:49:03.793 --> 01:49:05.782
IN
 THE MID-MAY. I AM HOPEFUL THAT

01:49:05.783 --> 01:49:10.623
 WE WILL NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THE
 SURVEILLANCE BUT EXECUTE IT AND

01:49:10.883 --> 01:49:12.637
 FOCUS THE UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT 
OF

01:49:12.638 --> 01:49:15.703
MONEY THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR
 YOU THAT THEY WILL SHOW

01:49:20.708 --> 01:49:22.708
SOME
 BENEFIT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

01:49:23.349 --> 01:49:30.853
 DR. FAUCI, LET ME GO BACK TO
 YOU. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

01:49:31.093 --> 01:49:34.997
 HOPEFULLY PEOPLE AROUND THE
 WORLD HAVE WHAT YOU FIND AND 

01:49:34.998 --> 01:49:36.727
THE
 EVENTUALLY LICENSE OF THE

01:49:36.728 --> 01:49:38.893
PRODUCT. WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST

01:49:43.913 --> 01:49:45.913
UNKNOWNS WITH THIS PA PARTICULAR
 VIRUS

01:49:48.811 --> 01:49:49.316
.

01:49:49.317 --> 01:49:55.030
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL,
 THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT

01:49:59.998 --> 01:50:01.998
 ARE IN ALL VACCINE 
DEVELOPMENTS.

01:50:02.133 --> 01:50:05.632
AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE
 DISCUSSED THIS MANY TIMES IN 

01:50:05.633 --> 01:50:07.642
THE
 PAST YOU CAN HAVE MANY THINGS 

01:50:07.643 --> 01:50:09.812
IN
 PLACE, AND YOU DO NOT REDUCE 

01:50:09.813 --> 01:50:12.213
THE
 IMMUNE RESPONSE AND IT TURNS 

01:50:12.214 --> 01:50:16.333
OUT
 TO BE PROTECTED. ONE OF THE BIG

01:50:16.623 --> 01:50:21.744
 UNKNOWNS IS THAT IT'S 
AFFECTIVE.

01:50:22.144 --> 01:50:26.233
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL GET
 A SIGNAL. THE OTHER THING

01:50:26.493 --> 01:50:30.749
THAT'S UNKNOWN THAT A CONCERN IS
 THAT WE CAN GET AROUND IT BY

01:50:31.074 --> 01:50:34.584
 DOING THE TEST PROPERLY IS THAT
 YOU GET AN ENHANCEMENT AFFECT.

01:50:35.134 --> 01:50:37.134
 THERE'S

01:50:40.336 --> 01:50:46.274
A NUMBER OF VIX SEEN S SEENS
 AND WHEN A PERSON GETS

01:50:51.402 --> 01:50:53.293
EXPOSED,
 THEY HAVE AN ENHANCE ED 

01:50:53.294 --> 01:50:56.324
ENHANCED AND WE
 WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES

01:50:56.764 --> 01:50:59.544
 NOT HAPPEN. PUTTING THOSE
 THINGS TOGETHER I FEEL

01:50:59.814 --> 01:51:03.864
OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL HAVE A
 CANDIDATE THAT WILL GET

01:51:08.084 --> 01:51:10.084
SOME
 DEGREE OF ITHACA SI.

01:51:28.685 --> 01:51:31.824
AND THEN A PATH WAY TO
 ACCESS THE ONE VACCINE AGAINST

01:51:32.214 --> 01:51:36.584
 THE OTHER AND THEN A MASTER
 PROTOCOL THAT ALLOWS FOR A

01:51:36.824 --> 01:51:40.234
COMMON CONTROL GROUP AND THEN
 ASSESSMENTS OF THE COMMON END

01:51:40.564 --> 01:51:43.224
 POINTS AND THAT ALLOWS IT AS
 POSSIBLE

01:51:47.999 --> 01:51:51.034
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
 THE VACCINE

01:52:05.888 --> 01:52:10.164
SGL SGL IN THE STATE
 OF INCOME THIS CAN THEY STARTED

01:52:10.404 --> 01:52:13.774
 TO PUB LA SIZE THE NUMBERS AND
 THOSE THAT HAD THE CORONAVIRUS

01:52:14.034 --> 01:52:16.034
 AND HAVE RECOVERED AND

01:52:20.476 --> 01:52:24.983
IT'S MY
 HOPE THAT NATIONAL LY 

01:52:24.984 --> 01:52:27.584
NATIONALLY CONSCIOUS I
 YIELD BACK.

01:52:27.829 --> 01:52:29.874
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SENATOR BIRD.
 SENATOR CASEY.

01:52:30.134 --> 01:52:34.714
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING AND
 THE SENATOR RANKING. I WANT TO

01:52:35.214 --> 01:52:40.144
 START TODAY WITH A QUESTION
 REGARDING THE NURSING HOME AND

01:52:40.405 --> 01:52:47.333
 IN PARTICULAR ACROSS THE STATE
 LIKE OURS WE HAVE AS YOU KNOW 

01:52:47.334 --> 01:52:49.283
AT
 LAST COUNT AT 57,000 CASES AND

01:52:49.284 --> 01:52:53.645
 THEN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS HAVE
 COMMON ABOVE 300,000 AND A

01:52:58.664 --> 01:53:00.664
LOT
 OF THOSE DEATHS ARE IN

01:53:06.745 --> 01:53:09.104
THE DEBT
 OF A RESIDENCE IN A NURSING 

01:53:09.105 --> 01:53:12.104
HOME
 OR WORKER. I WANT TO START

01:53:12.554 --> 01:53:18.834
TODAY WITH A QUESTION FOR DR.
 REDFIELD. DOCTOR, WHEN WE

01:53:19.155 --> 01:53:22.843
CONSIDER THIS CHALLENGE IN OUR
 LONG TERM CARE FACILITY, WHEN 

01:53:22.844 --> 01:53:25.203
WE
 LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE 

01:53:25.204 --> 01:53:28.185
DEATHS
 IN THE NURSES HOMES, I THINK

01:53:28.894 --> 01:53:32.324
 THAT A LOT OF THE FAMILIES WANT
 BASIC TRANSPARENCY AND THAT'S

01:53:32.565 --> 01:53:36.420
 ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE
 SENATOR AND I SENT YOU A LETTER

01:53:36.664 --> 01:53:41.394
 DATED APRIL 2ND AND IT WAS
 DIRECTED TO YOU AS WELL AS THE

01:53:41.915 --> 01:53:44.691
 ADMINISTRATOR TO THE CENTERS ON

01:53:48.735 --> 01:53:51.705
 THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID
 SERVICES AND IN THAT WE ASKED

01:53:51.955 --> 01:53:54.945
 FOR BASIC INFORMATION ON WHAT
 THEY WERE DOING TO ATTRACT THE

01:53:55.584 --> 01:54:00.835
 OUTBREAKS OF THE NURSING HOMES
 AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION AND

01:54:01.075 --> 01:54:03.965
 THE BASIC INFORMATION TO
 FAMILIES AND RESIDENCE AND THE

01:54:04.405 --> 01:54:06.384
 FAMILIES OF RESIDENCE AND IN 
THE

01:54:06.385 --> 01:54:10.155
NURSES HOMES AND THEN THE
 WORKERS AS WELL AS TO THE

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.825
COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH
 PROFESSIONALS. NOW, IT TOOK YOU

01:54:15.545 --> 01:54:18.975
 ABOUT A MONTH TO RESPOND TO
 THAT. IN YOUR RESPONSE, YOU DID

01:54:19.215 --> 01:54:22.845
 NOT GIVE US ANY INFORMATION ON
 THE TIMELINE. THESE FAMILIES

01:54:23.355 --> 01:54:30.485
 NEED THIS INFORMATION. NOW,
 WE'RE TOLD BY THE CMF

01:54:30.725 --> 01:54:32.875
ADMINISTRATOR AFTER PRESSING THE
 SENATOR THAT THIS INFORMATION

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.535
 MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE
 END OF MAY. I NEED TO HEAR FROM

01:54:38.785 --> 01:54:45.304
 YOU TODAY WHY HAS THERE BEEN A
 DELAY A THREE MONTH DELAY IN 

01:54:45.305 --> 01:54:47.305
THE
 BASIC INFORMATION THAT FAMILIES

01:54:47.545 --> 01:54:50.844
 AND PEOPLE WITHIN A COMMUNITY
 NEED ABOUT THE OUT BREAKS IN 

01:54:50.845 --> 01:54:52.845
THE
 NURSING HOME

01:54:56.835 --> 01:54:59.550
AND THE NUMBER OF
 CASE S

01:55:00.845 --> 01:55:01.614
CASES.

01:55:01.615 --> 01:55:05.430
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.
 YOU HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE

01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:07.670
TRAGEDIES THAT YOU

01:55:10.317 --> 01:55:11.769
HAVE
 EXPERIENCED TOGETHER AND CLEAR

01:55:11.770 --> 01:55:13.770
 LY

01:55:33.215 --> 01:55:34.094
 CLEARLY.

01:55:34.095 --> 01:55:37.125
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT
 THE CASES IN THE INDIVIDUALS

01:55:37.485 --> 01:55:40.345
 THAT ARE PATIENTS THERE OR

01:55:43.606 --> 01:55:45.936
STAFF
 TO THE CDC AND SECONDLY, THERE

01:55:46.228 --> 01:55:51.546
 WAS A POLICY IN PLACE AT ALL
 NURSING HOMES THAT ARE REQUIRED

01:55:51.825 --> 01:55:56.724
 TO NOTIFY THE MEMBERS OF THAT
 NURSING HOME OF THE EXISTENCE 

01:55:56.725 --> 01:56:00.105
OF
 THE COVID IN THE NURSING HOME

01:56:00.346 --> 01:56:02.045
 AND INCLUDING FAMILY MEMBERS 
AND

01:56:02.046 --> 01:56:05.245
VERIFYING IN TERMS OF WHEN THAT
 AND IF THAT'S OPERATIONAL AS OF

01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:08.996
 TODAY OR NEXT WEEK.
 I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITH

01:56:09.235 --> 01:56:12.385
THAT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
 THINGS THAT WE HAVE TALKED 

01:56:12.386 --> 01:56:17.246
ABOUT
 THE KEY AND REOPENING AND AS

01:56:17.606 --> 01:56:19.325
 TONY MENTIONED IT'S A 
SYSTEMATIC

01:56:19.326 --> 01:56:22.217
CASE AND WE NEED TO DO THE
 CONTACT TRACING. THE OTHER

01:56:22.466 --> 01:56:26.296
THING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO
 IS DO SURVEILLANCE AND THIS

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:31.216
VIRUS DOES APPEAR TO HAVE THE
 HIGH CAPACITY FOR THE HIGH

01:56:31.496 --> 01:56:34.391
INFECTION AND THAT MEANS FOR THE
 ADDITIONAL WAYS OF IDENTIFYING

01:56:34.686 --> 01:56:39.591
 THE CASES IS GOING TO BE
 BLUNTED. SO WE'RE DEVELOPING A

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:41.685
 NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 
AND

01:56:41.686 --> 01:56:45.065
FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT IS TO
 DO THE APPREHENSIVE 

01:56:45.066 --> 01:56:48.286
SURVEILLANCE
 IN ALL OF THE NURSING HOME IN

01:56:49.016 --> 01:56:53.696
 THE STATE AND THE CDC IS DOING
 THAT IN PAR NER SHIP WITH THE

01:56:54.086 --> 01:56:56.526
 STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH
 DEPARTMENTS. I THINK THAT'S

01:56:56.916 --> 01:57:02.236
GOING TO BE THE RESPONSIBILITIES
 TO DO THAT WITHIN THE CLINICS

01:57:02.481 --> 01:57:08.661
 THAT ARE SELECTED AND THEN THIS
 IS CRITICAL. WE GET IN FRONT OF

01:57:13.666 --> 01:57:15.666
 THIS AND DO COMPREHENSIVE
 SURVEILLANCE

01:57:28.036 --> 01:57:32.176
I WILL GOAT BACK TO
 YOU. I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT AND

01:57:32.441 --> 01:57:35.856
 I NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK JUST TO
 MAKE SURE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

01:57:36.096 --> 01:57:37.811
 THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT 
THEY'RE

01:57:37.812 --> 01:57:41.176
ALL REPORT TO GO THE CDC NOW IN
 THE INFECTION AND WORKERS OR

01:57:41.416 --> 01:57:44.556
 PATIENTS AND THAT THEY ARE
 REQUIRED NOW TO NOTIFY OTHER

01:57:44.786 --> 01:57:48.136
 MEMBERS IN THE NURSING HOME AS
 WELL AS THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF

01:57:48.376 --> 01:57:50.376
 THAT WHEN COVID

01:57:54.396 --> 01:57:58.266
IS IN ONE OF
 THOSE.

01:57:58.596 --> 01:58:02.801
&gt;&gt; I WANTED TO ASK YOU IN THE
 TESTIMONY EARLIER WITH SENATOR

01:58:03.046 --> 01:58:06.036
 MURRAY, YOU OUTLINED A BASIC
 CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE WITH

01:58:06.286 --> 01:58:08.726
REGARD TO THE STATES REOPENING.
 CAN YOU RESTATE THAT

01:58:13.677 --> 01:58:15.465
FOR US?

01:58:15.466 --> 01:58:17.466
&gt;&gt; YES.

01:58:31.397 --> 01:58:35.306
AND THEN PULLING BACK
 ON THE MITIGATION. I FEEL IF

01:58:36.412 --> 01:58:39.177
 THAT OCCURS, THERE'S A REAL 
RISK

01:58:39.407 --> 01:58:43.427
IN THE OUTBREAK AND TRYING TO BE
 ABLE TO CONTROL AND

01:58:48.337 --> 01:58:50.337
THAT'S WHAT
 WILL SET YOU BACK

01:58:54.867 --> 01:58:57.337
AND THEN TO
 TURN THE CLOCK BACK RATHER THAN

01:58:57.606 --> 01:58:59.606
 GOING FORWARD. THAT'S

01:59:03.926 --> 01:59:08.143
THE MAJOR
 CONCERN, SENATOR. SENATOR PAUL.

01:59:08.382 --> 01:59:14.137
&gt;&gt; DR. FAUCI, SCIENTISTS HAVE
 SHONE THAT MONKEYS THAT ARE

01:59:14.387 --> 01:59:17.887
INFECTED WITH COVID-19 CANNOT BE
 REINFECTED. SEVERAL STUDIES

01:59:18.132 --> 01:59:23.947
HAVE ALSO SHONE THAT PLASMA FROM
 REINFECTED PATIENTS NEUTRALIZES

01:59:24.727 --> 01:59:27.967
 THE LAB EXPERIMENTS. IN
 ADDITION, THE FUSION IS BASED

01:59:32.992 --> 01:59:34.992
ON
 THE IDEA THAT THE RECOVERING

01:59:50.777 --> 01:59:52.977
AND
 THEN YET THE MEDIA CONTINUES TO

01:59:53.357 --> 01:59:56.757
 REPORT THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
 THAT PATIENTS THAT SURVIVE THE

01:59:57.757 --> 02:00:00.917
 CORONAVIRUS HAVE IMMUNITY. I
 THINK ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THE

02:00:01.157 --> 02:00:04.467
 OPPOSITE. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
 THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

02:00:04.707 --> 02:00:07.112
IMMUNITY AND A GREAT DEAL OF THE
 EVIDENCE

02:00:11.807 --> 02:00:13.807
IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY
 DO.

02:00:26.987 --> 02:00:32.012
AND THEY WILL NOT GET IT
 AGAIN AND THAT THERE'S NO

02:00:32.257 --> 02:00:35.507
EVIDENCE OF IMMUNITY. YOU SAID
 THAT THE SURVIVORS HAVE SOME

02:00:35.773 --> 02:00:40.847
 FORM OF IMMUNITY. CAN YOU HELP
 TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THAT

02:00:42.090 --> 02:00:46.737
 THE RECORD AS IT'S BEING ACHYME
 LATIVE THAT IT LIKELY LEADS TO

02:00:46.981 --> 02:00:47.971
 THE IMMUNITY.

02:00:47.972 --> 02:00:51.078
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THANK YOU FOR THE
 QUESTION SENATOR. YOU'RE

02:00:51.317 --> 02:00:53.317
CORRECT AND I HAVE SAID THAT

02:00:57.608 --> 02:00:59.608
 GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ON T

02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:20.990
FOR OTHER
 WORKPLACES?

02:12:51.393 --> 02:12:53.393
EXAMPLE
 OF

02:25:58.265 --> 02:26:00.265
CAN

02:29:46.885 --> 02:29:48.734
SAY
 THAT EACH PRIVATE OR I 

02:29:48.735 --> 02:29:50.735
DEPENDENT
 SCHOOL WORKS WITH THE

02:29:53.735 --> 02:29:55.735
STATE
 SEEMS A WASTED EFFORT. I SAY

02:29:56.205 --> 02:29:58.205
 THAT

02:30:01.426 --> 02:30:03.426
BECAUSE THEY PLAY A ROLE.

02:30:12.115 --> 02:30:16.370
MISUNDERSTOOD. WHEN I WAS
 TALKING OF THE DIFFERENCES, I

02:30:16.695 --> 02:30:20.215
 WAS THINKING OF A HIGH SCHOOL
 AND COLLEGE IN TERMS OF HOW

02:30:24.755 --> 02:30:26.755
WE
 DO THE TRADE SCHOOL.

02:30:43.417 --> 02:30:45.417
THE
 RISK OF REOPENING PREMATURE LY

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:11.326
MATURELY
 AND 23409 HAVING ACCESS TO THE

02:31:11.826 --> 02:31:14.306
 INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO 
HAVE

02:31:14.556 --> 02:31:17.966
IT FORM AND THEN THERE'S ANY
 SORT OF RISK BENEFIT FOR THE

02:31:18.696 --> 02:31:22.626
 CHILD? YES, THEY'RE AT RISK,
 BUT THEY'RE AT RISK FOR MISSING

02:31:25.771 --> 02:31:29.866
 OUT ON A YEAR OF EDUCATION FOR
 THE BACKGROUND. I AM LESS

02:31:30.116 --> 02:31:31.495
CONCERNED WITH THE INTENTION.

02:31:31.496 --> 02:31:33.496
&gt;&gt;

02:31:36.417 --> 02:31:38.417
WHAT ARE THE THOUGHTS ON
 THAT?

02:31:52.636 --> 02:31:54.636
 SCHOOL. I DO NOT HAVE AN

02:31:58.226 --> 02:32:00.426
EASY
 ANSWER TO THAT. AS WE GET IN TO

02:32:00.676 --> 02:32:04.516
 THE PERIOD OF THE TIME WITH THE
 FALL OF REOPENING THE SCHOOLS

02:32:04.756 --> 02:32:08.246
 AND EXACTLY WHERE WE WOULD BE 
IN

02:32:08.506 --> 02:32:11.846
THE OUTBREAK. I MAY POINT OUT
 WHAT I HAVE ELUDED TO SOME OF

02:32:12.086 --> 02:32:15.686
 THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE A
 VERY LASHLG COUNTRY AND THE

02:32:15.931 --> 02:32:18.226
DYNAMICS OF THE OUTBREAKS ARE
 DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT REGIONS

02:32:18.476 --> 02:32:21.536
 OF THE COUNTRY. I WOULD IMAGINE
 THAT THE SITUATIONS WITH THE

02:32:21.786 --> 02:32:24.726
 SCHOOLS ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN A
 REGION VERSES ANOTHER. IT'S NOT

02:32:24.966 --> 02:32:30.406
 GOING TO BE UNIVERSITY. I DO
 NOT HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION OR

02:32:30.646 --> 02:32:34.806
 SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM ON WHAT
 HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLOSE THE

02:32:35.066 --> 02:32:39.595
SCHOOLS AND IT TRIGGERS THE
 CASCADE OF EVENTS AND COULD 

02:32:39.596 --> 02:32:41.075
HAVE
 THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:32:41.076 --> 02:32:45.459
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, I WILL CLOSE BY
 ASKING THE PERMISSION OF THE

02:32:45.886 --> 02:32:51.436
 CHAIR TO SUBMIT FOR THE RECORD
 ARTICLE THAT JUST CAME OUT IN

02:32:51.686 --> 02:32:55.326
 THE JOURNAL NURSING THAT
 CHILDREN ARE AT RISK FOR

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:56.066
COVID-19.

02:32:56.067 --> 02:33:00.397
&gt;&gt; THAT WILL BE INCLUDED. THANK
 YOU, SENATOR. SENATOR

02:33:05.406 --> 02:33:07.406
WARREN.  
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU

02:33:08.993 --> 02:33:11.216
, MR. CHAIRMAN AND
 THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE

02:33:11.483 --> 02:33:14.509
 TODAY. I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY IS
 STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY. IN

02:33:14.749 --> 02:33:20.132
 THE PAST 16 WEEKS OF A
 1.3 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:24.723
 INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS. WE
 NOW KNOW THAT 80,000 PEOPLE 

02:33:24.724 --> 02:33:27.947
HAVE
 DIED AND 33 MILLION PEOPLE WERE

02:33:28.292 --> 02:33:32.459
 OUT OF WORK. DR. FAUCI, YOU
 HAVE COMPRISED SIX PRESIDENTS

02:33:33.314 --> 02:33:35.297
 AND YOU HAVE BATTLED THE 
VIRUSES

02:33:35.298 --> 02:33:38.838
FOR THE ENTIRE CAREER. I JUST
 LIKE TO HEAR THE HONEST 

02:33:38.839 --> 02:33:40.839
OPINION.
 DO

02:33:43.884 --> 02:33:46.230
WE HAVE THE CORONAVIRUS
 CONTAINED?

02:33:47.425 --> 02:33:51.925
&gt;&gt; SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR THE
 QUESTION. IF YOU THINK THAT WE

02:33:52.173 --> 02:33:55.968
 HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL, WE DO
 NOT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:59.001
DYNAMICS AND SEEING THE
 HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THE

02:33:59.241 --> 02:34:03.973
INFECTIONS AND IN SOME PLACES
 SEISM AS NEW YORK CITY AND THEN

02:34:04.214 --> 02:34:07.195
 THAT'S THE PLATEAU COMING DOWN.
 IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

02:34:07.456 --> 02:34:11.406
 WE'RE SEEING THE SPIKES WHICH
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS 

02:34:11.407 --> 02:34:14.497
OF
 THE NEW CASES EVEN THOUGH SOME

02:34:14.916 --> 02:34:19.422
 ARE COMING DOWN, IT LOOKS FLAT
 WITH THE SLIGHT COMING DOWN. I

02:34:19.668 --> 02:34:22.895
 THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO IN THE
 RIGHT DIRECTION. THE RIGHT

02:34:23.138 --> 02:34:26.132
DIRECTION DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE
 HAVE BY ANY MEANS HAVE TOTAL

02:34:26.376 --> 02:34:28.113
 CONTROL OF THE ROUTE BREAK.

02:34:28.114 --> 02:34:31.268
&gt;&gt; SO THE DIRECTION AS I
 UNDERSTAND IT WE HAVE 25,000 

02:34:31.269 --> 02:34:33.244
NEW
 INFECTIONS A DAY AND OVER 2000

02:34:33.245 --> 02:34:37.971
 DEATHS A DAY. I THINK THAT'S
 THE RIGHT NUMBERS. SOME ARE

02:34:38.304 --> 02:34:44.802
ESTIMATING WE COULD BE AT
 200,000 NEW CASES A DAY BY 

02:34:44.803 --> 02:34:46.803
JUNE,
 IS THAT RIGHT DR. FAUCI?

02:34:47.221 --> 02:34:51.024
&gt;&gt; I DON'T FORESEE THAT AS
 200,000 NEW CASES BY JUNE. I AM

02:34:51.263 --> 02:34:54.596
 HOPING AND LOOKING AT THE
 DYNAMICS STARTING TO FLATTEN 

02:34:54.597 --> 02:34:57.149
OFF
 AND COME DOWN THAT WE WOULD BE

02:34:58.641 --> 02:35:01.966
 MUCH BETTER THAN THAT, SENATOR.

02:35:01.967 --> 02:35:08.243
&gt;&gt; JUST SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
 WE'RE AT 2000 NEW INFECTIONS A

02:35:08.487 --> 02:35:10.539
 DAY AND 25,000 INFECTIONS A DAY

02:35:15.472 --> 02:35:17.593
 AND 2000 DEATHS A DAY.

02:35:17.594 --> 02:35:23.223
&gt;&gt; LET ME JUST ASK. WE KNOW
 THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE

02:35:23.813 --> 02:35:27.387
 VIRUS UNDER BETTER CONTROL.
 OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE DONE

02:35:27.636 --> 02:35:29.687
 IT. WE'RE THREE MONTHS IN, AND

02:35:34.817 --> 02:35:41.391
WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SET
 RECORDS. YOU SAID THAT THE

02:35:46.395 --> 02:35:48.395
 SECOND WAVE WAS INEVITABLE.

02:35:51.696 --> 02:35:54.615
AND
 YOU SHOULD DO REASONABLY WELL.

02:35:59.962 --> 02:36:01.962
YOU IDENTIFIED WITH THE THINGS
 AND

02:36:06.445 --> 02:36:10.638
AND THIS IS THE QUOTE OF
 WE'RE IN IT FOR A BAD FALL AND

02:36:10.927 --> 02:36:15.481
 WINTER. WE'RE ABOUT 16 WEEKS
 AWAY FROM LABOR DAY, THAT'S

02:36:15.724 --> 02:36:19.052
ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME
 THIS VIRUS WAS FIRST DETECTED

02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:23.737
 HERE IN THE U.S. DON'T YOU HAVE
 ENOUGH ROBUST COUNTER MEASURES

02:36:23.981 --> 02:36:25.981
 IN PLACE THAT WE

02:36:30.213 --> 02:36:32.213
DO NOT HAVE TO
 WORRY ABOUT

02:36:35.735 --> 02:36:36.395
.

02:36:36.396 --> 02:36:40.900
&gt;&gt; WITH REGARD TO TESTING AND
 OTHER ELEMENTS AND THEN THE

02:36:41.155 --> 02:36:44.734
PROJECTION IS BY THE TIME WE GET
 TO THE END OF THE SUMMER AND

02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:52.006
 THEN EARLY FALL, THAT WE WILL
 HAVE THAT IN PLACE.

02:36:52.252 --> 02:36:55.711
&gt;&gt; WE ARE PROJECTING WHAT IS IN
 PLACE. LET ME JUST ASK THE

02:36:55.953 --> 02:37:01.647
OTHER SIDE OF THIS. IF WE DON'T
 DO BETTER ON TESTING AND 

02:37:01.648 --> 02:37:05.184
CONTACT
 TRACING AND ON THE SOCIAL

02:37:05.431 --> 02:37:10.436
DISTANCING, WILL DEATHS FROM THE
 CORONAVIRUS NECESSARILY

02:37:10.678 --> 02:37:11.170
INCREASE?

02:37:11.171 --> 02:37:15.635
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DO NOT DO AFTERNOON
 ADEQUATE RESPONSE, WE WILL HAVE

02:37:15.878 --> 02:37:19.778
 THE CONSEQUENCE OF MORE
 INFECTIONS AND MORE DEATHS.

02:37:20.357 --> 02:37:22.981
THAT'S THE REASON THAT YOU
 QUOTED ME QUIET CORRECTLY.

02:37:23.287 --> 02:37:28.046
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY, AND I
 WILL STAND BY THAT. IF WE DO

02:37:28.459 --> 02:37:32.948
 NOT RESPOND IN AN ADEQUATE WAY
 WHEN THE FALL COMES, GIVEN THAT

02:37:33.208 --> 02:37:36.583
 IT'S WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THERE
 WILL BE INFECTIONS THAT WILL BE

02:37:36.823 --> 02:37:41.407
 IN THE COMMUNITY, THEN WE RUN
 THE RISK OF HAVING THE RESIR

02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:45.334
 JANETS. I AM HOPING AT THAT
 POINT IN TIME IN THE FALL THAT

02:37:45.582 --> 02:37:48.808
 WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO
 RESPOND TO ADEQUATE. IF WE

02:37:49.048 --> 02:37:51.032
DON'T, THERE'S GOING TO BE
 PROBLEMS.

02:37:51.033 --> 02:37:54.236
&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THE HOPE. I
 WISH THAT WE COULD TELL THE

02:37:54.476 --> 02:37:59.395
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT HAS THIS PANDEMIC

02:38:04.395 --> 02:38:06.395
 UNDER CONTROL, BUT WE CAN'T.

02:38:23.422 --> 02:38:28.169
 AND THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO STOP
 SAYING THAT IF HE IGNORES BAD

02:38:33.114 --> 02:38:35.114
 NEWS, IT WILL GO AWAY.

02:40:57.826 --> 02:40:58.493
.

02:40:58.494 --> 02:41:02.274
&gt;&gt; AND THAT'S BETWEEN FOUR AND
 FIVE AND THEN THAT'S NOT AS WE

02:41:02.514 --> 02:41:04.749
 HOPE TO RECEIVE AND AS WE HAVE
 BEEN

02:41:09.264 --> 02:41:15.064
SAID BY ONE OF THE
 WITNESSES AND AS THE

02:41:15.604 --> 02:41:18.684
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS SUCH
 THAT EVEN THE FIRST BREAK

02:41:18.934 --> 02:41:24.014
THROUGH WITH THE REGARD TO CHINA
 SEEMS TO BE ON HOLD NOW. THAT'S

02:41:24.434 --> 02:41:30.653
 ANOTHER PRESENT AND THIS IS
 GOING ON FIVE OR SIX YEARS 

02:41:30.654 --> 02:41:32.643
WHERE
 THE PRICES ARE BELOW THE

02:41:32.644 --> 02:41:35.189
REDUCTION. IN THE RESULTS THE
 CONSUMERS ARE SEEING THAT FOOD

02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:38.844
 DOES NOT COME FROM GROCERY
 STORES. I AM VERY WORRIED THAT

02:41:39.114 --> 02:41:43.383
 THE HARM TO HAVE VALUE CHAIN IS
 VERY REAL AND NOT TO MENTION 

02:41:43.384 --> 02:41:45.994
THE
 FINANCIAL SITUATION THAT IS THE

02:41:46.285 --> 02:41:50.274
 FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND 
GROWERS

02:41:50.524 --> 02:41:52.524
DO. HAVING SAID THAT.  ADMIRAL, 
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE

02:41:53.634 --> 02:41:57.043
IMPORTANCE
 OF THE TESTS THAT ARE 

02:41:57.044 --> 02:41:59.013
AVAILABLE.
 THE FIVE PACKING PLANT THAT IS

02:41:59.014 --> 02:42:05.844
 WE HAVE IN KANSAS, IF WE GET A
 RAPID TEST AND WE CAN GET IT AS

02:42:06.094 --> 02:42:08.604
 WE ASK FOR IT BECAUSE OF THE 
HOT

02:42:08.914 --> 02:42:13.824
SPOTS THAT ARE DEVELOPING NOT
 ONLY IN KANSAS BUT GOING TO THE

02:42:14.229 --> 02:42:18.324
 VALUE CHAIN, THAT WOULD BE
 ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. WOULD YOU

02:42:18.614 --> 02:42:20.193
 SPEAK TO THIS, SIR?

02:42:20.194 --> 02:42:23.224
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THANK YOU, SENATOR.
 BOTH DOCTOR REDFIELD AND I HAVE

02:42:24.524 --> 02:42:28.904
 BEEN VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN
 GETTING STRATEGIES FOR THE

02:42:29.154 --> 02:42:35.854
INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY IN KANSAS.
 WE ARE SUPPLYING THE PUBLIC

02:42:36.094 --> 02:42:38.364
HEALTH LAB WITH RAPID
 DIAGNOSTICS AS WELL AS SURGING

02:42:38.609 --> 02:42:43.124
 THEM TO THE AREAS LIKE THAT.
 THE ONE TRADE OFF HOWEVER, IS

02:42:43.364 --> 02:42:47.664
 THAT THE RAPID -- THE RAPID
 POINT OF THE CARE IS VERY SLOW.

02:42:48.024 --> 02:42:52.424
 EACH MACHINE CAN ONLY DO FOUR
 PER HOUR, AND THAT'S VERY SLOW.

02:42:52.774 --> 02:42:59.455
 IT'S A MIX OF TESTING THAT YOU
 NEED FOR THOSE KIND OF

02:42:59.724 --> 02:43:04.556
SITUATIONS ON SORT OF THE TESTst
 THAT IS AVAILABLE AT A MAJOR

02:43:09.129 --> 02:43:11.129
LAB
 AND A REQUEST LAB

02:43:15.525 --> 02:43:17.525
&amp; FROM AND

02:43:21.935 --> 02:43:28.884
&amp; WE'RE
 DOING THIS AND THAT'S THE RAPID

02:43:29.224 --> 02:43:31.224
 SLOW

02:43:34.229 --> 02:43:36.229
TEST AND I FOR ONE AND

02:43:40.425 --> 02:43:43.505
&amp; THEN
 THE HOPE IS AND THEN WE

02:43:46.785 --> 02:43:51.904
DO HAVE
 THE PLANS AND THEN AS THEY

02:43:52.215 --> 02:43:55.455
DESCRIBE BY DR. FAUCI AND I
 THINK IT WILL BE UPRIGHT. THIS

02:43:55.700 --> 02:43:59.685
 IS A TOUGH GO. I HAVE TO TELL
 YOU THAT IN TERMS OF

02:43:59.925 --> 02:44:02.485
AGRICULTURE, WE'RE NOT IN GOOD
 SHAPE. I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY

02:44:02.735 --> 02:44:08.655
 AND THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING.
 WE WILL STAND BESIDE YOU WHEN

02:44:08.915 --> 02:44:12.385
 YOU'RE TAKING THE BOOS AND
 BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU'RE TAKING

02:44:13.087 --> 02:44:14.524
 THE APPLAUSE.

02:44:14.525 --> 02:44:17.289
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SENATOR ROBERTS.

02:44:17.290 --> 02:44:20.485
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND
 WITNESSES FOR CALLING THE

02:44:20.725 --> 02:44:25.515
IMPORTANT HEARING. THE LAST
 TIME THAT DR. FAUCI

02:44:29.215 --> 02:44:31.655
AND HAHN
 WERE BEFORE US WAS IN APRIL.

02:44:31.935 --> 02:44:35.535
 THE CHART HERE WAS IN THE 
UNITED

02:44:35.907 --> 02:44:41.515
STATES AND SOUTH KOREA IN THREE
 DAYS. BOTH EXPERIENCED THE

02:44:42.125 --> 02:44:45.055
FIRST CASE AND THOSE WERE SENTLY
 IDENTICAL. ON MARCH 3RD WHEN

02:44:46.225 --> 02:44:50.695
 THE WITNESSES WERE LAST YEAR,
 SOUTH KOREA HAD 28 DEATHS AND

02:44:51.055 --> 02:44:54.644
 THEY EXPERIENCED NINE. AGAIN,
 THE ECONOMIES OF BOTH NATIONS 

02:44:54.645 --> 02:44:56.514
BY
 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES WERE

02:44:56.515 --> 02:44:59.565
NEARLY IDENTICAL. NOW, THE
 STORY CHANGES.

02:44:59.815 --> 02:45:02.445
AS OF YESTERDAY, MORE THAN
 81,000 AMERICANS HAVE DIED. THE

02:45:02.835 --> 02:45:04.744
 U.S. ECONOMY HAS EXPERIENCED 
JOB

02:45:04.745 --> 02:45:08.395
LOSSES NOT SEEN SINCE THE GREAT
 DEPRESSION. MEANWHILE, THE

02:45:08.685 --> 02:45:12.935
ECONOMY OF SOUTH KOREA HAS NOT
 CHANGED AT ALL. THE DEATH TOLL

02:45:13.595 --> 02:45:16.665
 IS AT 256. SOUTH KOREA IS
 SMALLER THAN THE UNITED STATES

02:45:16.905 --> 02:45:21.775
 AND ONE SIX OF THE POPULATION.
 EVEN IF YOU BULK UP TO TOLL FOR

02:45:22.045 --> 02:45:27.295
 THE PER CAPITA IS MORE THAN 45
 TIMES THE RATE IN SOUTH KOREA.

02:45:27.685 --> 02:45:33.780
 THE HEALTH CARE AREA HERE IS
 CAUSING A NEAR DEPRESSION WHILE

02:45:34.021 --> 02:45:36.636
 SOUTH KOREA HAS PROTECTED THE
 ECONOMY BY MANAGING CORRECTLY.

02:45:36.875 --> 02:45:40.065
 I COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITH
 OTHER NATIONS. THE U.S. HAS THE

02:45:40.315 --> 02:45:43.544
 SEVENTH HIGHEST IN THE WORLD.
 THE DEATH RATE IS OFF THE 

02:45:43.545 --> 02:45:45.666
CHARTS
 HIGHER IN INDIA AND AWES TRILL

02:45:45.915 --> 02:45:49.846
 YEAH AND JAPAN AND MEXICO. IT'S
 NEARLY THREE TIMES THE DEATH

02:45:50.385 --> 02:45:54.654
 RATE IN GERMANY AND TWICE THE
 HIGHEST. THE QUESTION IS WHY.  

02:45:54.655 --> 02:45:56.475
IF WE WANT TO OPEN
 UP, WE HAVE

02:45:56.476 --> 02:45:59.455
TO LEARN THE NATIONS THAT HAVE
 MANAGED US WELL. HERE ARE THE

02:45:59.705 --> 02:46:05.696
 THINGS THAT DO NOT EXPLAIN THE
 DIFFERENCE. AND OUR HEALTH CARE

02:46:05.965 --> 02:46:10.656
 PROVIDERS HEROS ARE AS GOOD OR
 BETTER AS SOUTH KOREA. THE

02:46:11.016 --> 02:46:16.005
RESEARCH CAPACITY IS GOOD OR
 BETTER THAN SOUTH KOREA. WE

02:46:16.385 --> 02:46:19.511
HAVE MORE RESOURCES THAN SOUTH
 KOREA. IT'S 12 TIMES THE SOUTH

02:46:19.766 --> 02:46:26.714
 KOREA AND THEN 50% HIGHER. TO
 DR. FAUCI, THE DEATH RATE IN 

02:46:26.715 --> 02:46:28.715
THE
 UNITED STATES ESPECIALLY WHEN

02:46:29.486 --> 02:46:31.486
 COMPARED WITH OTHER

02:46:35.644 --> 02:46:37.644
NATIONS IS
 UNACCEPTABLE, ISN'T IT?

02:46:49.286 --> 02:46:50.595
 RATE IN ACCEPTABLE.

02:46:50.596 --> 02:46:53.835
&gt;&gt; AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER
 NATIONS SHOW THAT THE U.S. 

02:46:53.836 --> 02:46:56.366
DEATH
 RATE IS NOT ONLY UNACCEPTABLE,

02:46:56.763 --> 02:46:58.976
 BUT IT'S UNNECESSARY, ISN'T 
THAT

02:46:59.286 --> 02:46:59.875
CORRECT?

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:04.406
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN SAY
 THAT, SENATOR.

02:47:04.646 --> 02:47:09.245
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE U.S.
 HAS TO DO BETTER? ALWAYS.  YOU 

02:47:09.246 --> 02:47:11.015
HAVE TO DO BETTER
.

02:47:11.016 --> 02:47:15.096
&gt;&gt; AND THE EXPERIENCE IN SOUTH
 KOREA SHOWS HOW THEY MANAGE THE

02:47:15.346 --> 02:47:18.756
 CRISIS AND THEN THAT'S ON THE
 ECONOMIC CONDITION, ISN'T THAT

02:47:18.996 --> 02:47:19.980
 THE CASE?

02:47:19.981 --> 02:47:22.876
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE CASE, SIR. I
 UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING

02:47:23.126 --> 02:47:27.048
 WITH THIS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU
 THAT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE 

02:47:27.049 --> 02:47:29.049
IN
 SOUTH KOREA AND THE UNITED

02:47:29.236 --> 02:47:30.495
STATES AND THE OUTBREAK.

02:47:30.496 --> 02:47:34.241
&gt;&gt; AND LET ME GET TO THAT. I
 WANT TO GET TO THE FACTORS THAT

02:47:34.476 --> 02:47:37.426
 DO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE SINCE
 WE KNOW IT'S NOT THE RESOURCES

02:47:37.676 --> 02:47:41.426
 OR THE HEALTH PROVIDE OVERS.
 FIRST IS TESTING. SOUTH KOREA

02:47:41.817 --> 02:47:45.986
 BEGAN AGGRESSIVE TESTING MUCH
 EARLIER THAN THE U.S. NOW, WE

02:47:46.297 --> 02:47:52.381
 SURPASSED SOUTH KOREA IN THE
 TESTING. IN THE CRITICAL MONTH

02:47:52.641 --> 02:47:55.603
 OF MARCH, SOUTH KOREA WAS
 TESTING THE POPULATION AT A 

02:47:55.604 --> 02:47:57.604
RATE
 OF 40 TIMES THE

02:48:01.398 --> 02:48:03.766
TESTING IN THE
 UNITED STATES. WHEN WE GET TO

02:48:04.056 --> 02:48:08.496
 CEMENT, THE UNITED STATES NEEDS
 TO DO 40 TO 50 MILLION TESTS A

02:48:08.866 --> 02:48:13.896
 MONTH TO BE SAFE. THAT EQUATES
 TO 1.3 MILLION TO 1.37 MILLION

02:48:14.197 --> 02:48:19.027
 TESTS A DAY. YESTERDAY WE DID
 395,000 TESTS. WE HAVE A LONG

02:48:19.266 --> 02:48:25.376
 WAY TO GO. A SECOND FACTOR IS
 CONTRACT TRACING. SOUTH KOREA

02:48:25.756 --> 02:48:28.977
 EMBRACED A CONTRACT TRACING AND
 THE PROGRAM RIGHT FROM THE

02:48:29.216 --> 02:48:33.697
BEGINNING. THE UNITED STATES
 STILL HAS NOT ENGAGE IN A

02:48:33.956 --> 02:48:35.956
NATIONAL CONTACT

02:48:38.496 --> 02:48:41.086
TRACING
 PROGRAM, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? IS

02:48:41.357 --> 02:48:43.486
 THAT DR. FAUCI OR DR. REFIELD?

02:48:43.487 --> 02:48:46.667
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK THAT'S BEST
 DIRECT TODAY THE CDC.

02:48:47.076 --> 02:48:53.636
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE OUTBREAK STARTED,
 SIR, WE HAD AN AGGRESSIVE

02:48:54.027 --> 02:48:56.717
CONTRACT TRACING PROGRAM.
 UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE

02:48:56.957 --> 02:48:59.406
CAPACITY AND THEN MITIGATIONS
 AND THEN WE LOST THE 

02:48:59.407 --> 02:49:01.165
CONTAINMENT
 AND THAT'S CLEARLY --

02:49:01.166 --> 02:49:06.487
&gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS KEY THE ECONOMY
 AS WELL. SOUTH KOREA DID THE

02:49:07.907 --> 02:49:11.737
 TESTING AND PROTECT AND SERVE
 AND WE DID NOT HAVE TO DO THE

02:49:11.977 --> 02:49:15.466
 SHUT DOWN. SOCIAL DISTANCING IS
 A THIRD ONE AND FINALLY THE 

02:49:15.467 --> 02:49:17.467
LAST
 ONE, THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS.

02:49:17.677 --> 02:49:19.847
 WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT HELPS 
TO

02:49:20.087 --> 02:49:23.007
KEEP THE PEOPLE SAFE FROM
 SERIOUS CONDITIONS OR THE DEATH

02:49:23.307 --> 02:49:25.307
 OF COVID-19 IF THEY

02:49:28.827 --> 02:49:31.267
HAVE ACCESS
 TO HEALTH CARE?

02:49:31.507 --> 02:49:36.307
&gt;&gt; YES, OF COURSE THAT'S THE
 CASE. 97% OF THE POPULATION HAD

02:49:36.907 --> 02:49:39.167
 HEALTH INSURANCE. BEFORE
 COVID-19, MILLIONS DID NOT HAVE

02:49:39.421 --> 02:49:42.567
 IT AND LACKED THE ACCESS THE
 HEALTH CARE. THE MASSIVE JOB

02:49:42.817 --> 02:49:46.197
 LOSS IN THE LAST MONTHS
 THREATENED TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM

02:49:46.667 --> 02:49:51.337
 MILLIONS MORE AND PRESIDENT
 TRUMP IS DOING ALL THAT HE CAN

02:49:51.577 --> 02:49:53.516
 TO DISMANTLE THE AFFORDABLE 
CARE

02:49:53.517 --> 02:49:56.257
ACT AND THAT'S GOING TAKE IT
 AWAY FROM

02:50:01.147 --> 02:50:03.247
TENS OF MILLIONS OF
 MORE.

02:50:03.487 --> 02:50:08.197
&gt;&gt; CAN I MAKE A CLARIFICATION.
 I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I

02:50:08.567 --> 02:50:13.717
 DID PROJECT THAT WE WILL HAVE
 THE ABILITY TO PERFORM 40 TO 50

02:50:14.577 --> 02:50:19.452
 MILLION TESTS A MONTH IN THAT
 TIME FRAME. I SAID IF NEEDED AT

02:50:19.697 --> 02:50:23.067
 THAT TIME, I AM NOT MAKING A
 PROCLAMATION. WE HAVE TO REALLY

02:50:23.317 --> 02:50:26.076
 UNDERSTAND WHERE THE EPIDEMIC
 IS, WHAT THE COMMUNITY SPREAD 

02:50:26.077 --> 02:50:28.036
IS
 BEFORE WE CAN ESTIMATE THE

02:50:28.037 --> 02:50:31.436
NUMBER OF TESTS NEEDED. I WAS
 SIMPLY STATING THE FACT THAT 

02:50:31.437 --> 02:50:33.376
THE
 COMBINATION OF THE TESTING

02:50:33.377 --> 02:50:36.346
CAPABILITIES WILL BE AT THE
 LEVEL AND EVEN BARING NEW IN 

02:50:36.347 --> 02:50:38.347
PUT
 FROM THE NIH.

02:50:39.417 --> 02:50:43.337
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, SENATOR
 CANE.

02:50:43.577 --> 02:50:46.337
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND
 GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING

02:50:47.007 --> 02:50:51.327
 HERE THIS MORNING VIRTUALLY AND
 FOR ALL OF YOU AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:50:56.278 --> 02:51:01.397
 DOING FOR THE MANY MONTHS. .
 ALASKA IS DOING OKAY, AND WE

02:51:01.757 --> 02:51:06.411
 WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. WE
 KNOW THAT WE HAVE A GEOGRAPHY

02:51:06.657 --> 02:51:10.072
 THAT'S CHALLENGING, AND WE KNOW
 THAT WE HAVE FACILE AT AS THAT

02:51:10.317 --> 02:51:13.038
 ARE LIMITED. IN THE LAST
 HEARING WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

02:51:13.278 --> 02:51:15.278
 TO HEAR FROM DR. COLLINS, AND 
HE

02:51:15.477 --> 02:51:17.878
SHARED WHERE THEY ARE WITH THE
 RED X AND

02:51:22.187 --> 02:51:24.187
ALSO SPOKE TO RED X UP

02:51:39.458 --> 02:51:45.077
UP. I EDUCATED HIM ON THE
 COMMUNITY THAT'S GETTING READY

02:51:45.797 --> 02:51:47.797
 TO OPEN HIS

02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:56.837
SALMON FISHERY IN
 TWO DAY S DAYS AND THEN THE 

02:51:56.838 --> 02:51:59.239
GOOD NEWS
 ON THAT IS THAT THE PROTOCOLS

02:51:59.478 --> 02:52:03.078
 THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE SEEM
 TO BE WORKING. THE QUARANTINE

02:52:03.318 --> 02:52:07.748
 AND ISOLATION. NOT ONLY FOR
 THAT INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR OTHERS

02:52:08.058 --> 02:52:13.028
 THAT HE HAD COME IN CONTACT 
WERE

02:52:13.398 --> 02:52:15.398
SECURE. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE.  I 
WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE

02:52:16.738 --> 02:52:18.738
ADD MIDGE
 ADMINISTRATION AND WE'RE IN THE

02:52:18.748 --> 02:52:23.958
 STATE AT THIS MOMENT AND THE
 CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE

02:52:24.198 --> 02:52:28.858
 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
 GOING OUT TO RURAL COMMUNITIES

02:52:29.118 --> 02:52:33.227
 TO REALLY BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR
 VULNERABLES AND GOING TO SOME 

02:52:33.228 --> 02:52:36.397
OF
 THE FISHING COMMUNITIES TO 

02:52:36.398 --> 02:52:39.678
AGAIN
 UNDERHOW WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY

02:52:40.068 --> 02:52:42.068
 PROSECUTE WHEN YOU HAVE TO 
BRING

02:52:42.118 --> 02:52:45.648
THE WORKERS IN FROM THE OUTSIDE.
 WE THANK YOU FOR THE ASSISTANCE

02:52:45.908 --> 02:52:47.908
 WITH

02:52:50.850 --> 02:52:52.850
REGARDS TO ADDITIONAL
 TESTING CAPACITY.

02:53:02.798 --> 02:53:06.078
ONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT I WANT TO HAVE

02:53:06.328 --> 02:53:09.907
CLARIFIED AND THIS IS FOR YOU
 BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SO 

02:53:09.908 --> 02:53:11.908
HELPFUL
 IN SHINING THE LIGHT ON WHAT WE

02:53:12.128 --> 02:53:15.978
 NEED TO DO IN THE RURAL AREAS,
 BUT SO MUCH OF THE FOCUS HAS

02:53:16.218 --> 02:53:18.187
 BEEN ON HOT SPOTS AND 
RESPONDING

02:53:18.188 --> 02:53:20.188
TO THE HOT

02:53:23.078 --> 02:53:25.078
SPOTS. HOW DO YOU
 KEEP

02:53:33.858 --> 02:53:37.088
THE STELLATAE GEE IS THAT
 WE JUST LOCK IT OFF. THE TRAVEL

02:53:37.328 --> 02:53:41.838
 RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE
 ARE APPARENTLY WORKING, BUT

02:53:42.078 --> 02:53:45.578
THEY'RE ALSO -- THEY'RE ALSO
 DEVASTATING THE ECONOMY WHETHER

02:53:46.338 --> 02:53:49.888
 IN TOURISM, WHETHER IT'S OUR
 RESOURCE INDUSTRIES OR WHETHER

02:53:50.248 --> 02:53:55.138
 IT'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THE
 FISHERIES. IF YOU MAY SPEAK TO

02:53:55.379 --> 02:53:59.174
 THAT ASPECT OF THAT, AND THEN I
 HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION

02:53:59.408 --> 02:54:01.408
 AS IT RELATES TO CONTACT 
TRACING

02:54:01.439 --> 02:54:09.829
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT TO
 EITHER ADMIRAL GIOR OR DR.

02:54:10.133 --> 02:54:10.738
REDFIELD.

02:54:10.739 --> 02:54:15.509
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR. AS YOU
 KNOW, YOU HAVE AN OUTSTANDING

02:54:16.039 --> 02:54:17.578
 HEALTH OFFICER.

02:54:17.579 --> 02:54:18.707
&gt;&gt; WE DO.

02:54:18.708 --> 02:54:21.428
&gt;&gt; I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF
 WORKING WITH HER. YOU

02:54:24.559 --> 02:54:28.844
HAVE A
 VERY GOOD PROTOCOL IN TRYING TO

02:54:29.149 --> 02:54:32.239
 KEEP ALASKA SAFE WITH AN
 ISOLATION OF A PERIOD OF TIME

02:54:32.574 --> 02:54:36.279
 WHEN YOU ARE COMING IN.
 WE TRY TO MEET THE CHALLENGING

02:54:36.569 --> 02:54:39.099
 TESTING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE
 CANNOT REALLY, YOU KNOW, SEND

02:54:39.361 --> 02:54:43.449
 LABS OUT A THOUSAND MILES AWAY.
 WE PUT A REAL CUSTOM ECONOMIZE

02:54:43.689 --> 02:54:47.129
 MIX OF THE POINT OF CARE AND
 THEN THE MACHINES I THINK THAT

02:54:47.369 --> 02:54:50.419
 WE KID NINE OR TEN NEW TO 
ALASKA

02:54:50.669 --> 02:54:55.588
AND THEN 50,000 TESTS AND THAT'S
 FOUR TIMES THAN YOU HAVE DONE 

02:54:55.589 --> 02:54:57.589
TO

02:54:58.849 --> 02:55:03.839
 DATE FLOORED TO PROVIDE THE
 SUPPORT. I THINK THERE'S A

02:55:05.239 --> 02:55:07.699
STRATEGY THAT YOU DO HAVE. THE
 MITIGATION GIVEN THE

02:55:07.939 --> 02:55:10.849
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE FACE MASKS
 AND THE HAND WASHING AND

02:55:11.089 --> 02:55:14.569
HYGIENE, WE UNDERSTAND FULLY THE
 CHAL ECKS IN THE FISHING

02:55:14.814 --> 02:55:17.859
ENVIRONMENT AND THE REMOTES, BUT
 ALL OF THESE HAVE TO COME

02:55:18.101 --> 02:55:21.224
TOGETHER AND THE TESTING AND
 TRACING AND THE MITIGATION AND

02:55:21.679 --> 02:55:27.039
 THEN THE FACTORS TO TRY TO KEEP
 YOUR COMMUNITIES SAFE. WE

02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:32.634
REALLY UNDERSTAND CULTURALLY
 THAT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES

02:55:33.964 --> 02:55:37.559
 WERE ALMOSTAL LATED IN THE FLU
 PANDEMIC. THAT MEMORY IS STILL

02:55:37.804 --> 02:55:41.689
 VERY SHARP AND HURTFUL TO MANY
 OF THE CITIZEN. WE WANT TO DO

02:55:41.944 --> 02:55:45.148
 OUR BEST TO ASSURE THEM THAT
 WE'RE GIVING THEM THE 

02:55:45.149 --> 02:55:46.908
PROTECTION
 THAT THEY CAN.

02:55:46.909 --> 02:55:52.839
&gt;&gt; LET ME TURN TO DR. REDFIELD.
 THIS TURNS TO CONTACT TRACING.

02:55:53.089 --> 02:55:56.819
 THIS IS A KEY PART IN HOW WE
 MOVE FORWARD IN TO GETTING

02:55:57.059 --> 02:56:00.994
PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND SCHOOL.
 RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT 100

02:56:01.379 --> 02:56:04.189
PEOPLE THAT ARE INLAY VOVRLED IN
 CONTACT TRACING IN ALASKA.

02:56:04.434 --> 02:56:07.959
THAT'S CLEARLY NOT SUFFICIENT.
 THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT A

02:56:08.209 --> 02:56:10.994
NATIONAL STRATEGY, BUT I THINK
 THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE

02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:15.094
 TEAMS IN PLACE WHETHER IT'S
 AMERICA OR PEACE

02:56:19.319 --> 02:56:21.609
CORP. OR THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH CORP, WHAT DO WE

02:56:22.039 --> 02:56:25.480
 HAVE TO DO ONCE YOU HAVE TESTED
 POSITIVE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO

02:56:25.729 --> 02:56:29.419
 DO AFTER THAT. WHO ELSE NEEDS
 TO BE BROUGHT IN TO THIS? I AM

02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:33.229
 NOT CONVINCE THAT HAD WE'RE
 FOCUSSING ENOUGH ON THAT ASPECT

02:56:33.579 --> 02:56:40.400
 OF HOW WE MOVE TO REOPENING IF
 WE HAVE NOT DONE THE CONTRACT

02:56:40.649 --> 02:56:41.414
 TRACING.

02:56:41.415 --> 02:56:46.799
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, VERY MUCH,
 SENATOR. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU

02:56:47.035 --> 02:56:51.860
 SAID. IT'S CRITICAL AND THEN
 THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE OF SUCK

02:56:52.209 --> 02:56:58.569
 SAIDING IN THE CONTAINING THIS
 OUTBREAK FROM AND THE WIDE 

02:56:58.570 --> 02:57:00.570
SCALE

02:57:03.180 --> 02:57:07.714
 COMMUNITY TRANS MISSION OR NOT.
 WE'RE POSITIONED TO REDEPLOY 

02:57:07.715 --> 02:57:09.715
THE
 NUMB I OF FIVE INDIVIDUALS FOR

02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:13.930
 THE CDC. WE HAVE ANOTHER 650
 THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT IN.

02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:15.704
 MEDICAL CENTER IMPORTANTLY 
WE'RE

02:57:15.705 --> 02:57:18.180
TRYING TO WORK WITH THE HEALTH
 DEPARTMENT AND THE RESOURCES

02:57:18.425 --> 02:57:20.425
 THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:27.600
TO GIVE
 BECAUSE OF THE CONGRESS ALSO,

02:57:28.155 --> 02:57:31.400
 WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES AND 
THEN

02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:34.580
THE CENSUS BUREAU AND THEN WORK
 TOGETHER AND HAVE THE STATE

02:57:34.963 --> 02:57:39.379
DEVELOP THE CAPACITY. SOME
 STATES HAVE DONE THE STATE 

02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:41.289
WORK.
 SOME HAVE REACTIVATED THE

02:57:41.290 --> 02:57:44.540
NATIONAL GUARD WHILE THEY BEGIN
 TO DO THIS. I AGREE WITH YOU

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:49.060
 WHEN I SAY THAT IT'S A
 SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TO BUILD THE

02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:52.575
 CONTEXT TRACING THAT WE NEED IN
 THE NATION. IT'S STATE BY

02:57:52.815 --> 02:57:56.760
STATE, AND IT NEEDS TO BE
 OWINGMENTED PROBABLY IN YOUR

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:00.250
 STATE FROM WHAT YOU JUST SAID
 IT'S FIVE TO TENFOLD. WE'RE

02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:03.470
THERE TO WORK WITH THE STATES TO
 HELP THEM ACCOMPLISH THAT. THAT

02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:06.090
 NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE
 SEPTEMBER.

02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:09.414
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

02:58:09.415 --> 02:58:15.674
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR. I DON'T
 WANT TO CUT ANY SENATOR OFF, 

02:58:15.675 --> 02:58:18.720
BUT
 WE HAVE EIGHT MORE SENATOR THAT

02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:22.420
 IS HAVE FIVE MORE ROUNDS AND
 IT'S 12:30. I WOULD LIKE TO

02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:25.760
REQUEST THAT THE SENATORS AND
 WITNESSES HAVE THE SAME

02:58:26.002 --> 02:58:28.002
QUESTIONS AND TRY

02:58:31.950 --> 02:58:33.950
TO STAY WITHIN
 FIVE MINUTES.

02:58:39.860 --> 02:58:42.425
HEARING AND PLEASE PASS THE
 THANKS ALONG TO THE HARDWORKING

02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:46.711
 WOMAN AND MEN IN THE AGENCIES
 THAT I KNOW HAVE BEEN WORKING

02:58:48.340 --> 02:58:52.280
 AROUND THE CLOCK TO TRY TO
 IMPROVE THE RESPONSE AND KEEP

02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:56.360
 AMERICANS SAFE. I HOPE YOU AND
 THE WITNESSES ARE HEALTHY AND

02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:58.630
 SAFE TODAY AS IS

02:59:01.330 --> 02:59:05.930
EVERYBODY ELSE
 ON THE TEAM. I RANTED TO START

02:59:06.181 --> 02:59:08.710
 BY NEEDING THIS FROM THE CDC 
AND

02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:14.021
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS ON HOW
 WE'RE GOING TO USE FACTS AND

02:59:14.386 --> 02:59:16.611
 EVIDENCE AS GUIDANCE SO THAT 
OUR

02:59:16.850 --> 02:59:19.321
SCHOOLS AND THE DAYCARES AND
 BUSINESSES HAVE THE INFORMATION

02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:24.639
 THAT THEY NEED TO CREATE SAFE
 AND SUSTAINABLE PLANS TO 

02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:28.880
REOPEN.
 OF COURSE, THAT MEANS THAT OUR

02:59:29.121 --> 02:59:31.761
 TESTING CAPACITY NOT ONLY HAS 
TO

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:36.921
BE ENOUGH BUT IT HAS TO MEET THE
 NEEDS. THE KEY DISTINCTION

02:59:37.170 --> 02:59:40.981
BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA AND THE
 UNITED STATES IS NOT HOW MANY

02:59:41.230 --> 02:59:43.230
 TESTS PER CAPITA OVER THE 
AMOUNT

02:59:43.571 --> 02:59:47.920
OF TIME THAT WE HAVE DONE, BUT
 ON THE ON SECURITY OF THE

02:59:48.201 --> 02:59:50.201
PANDEMIC, SOUTH KOREA WAS

02:59:53.881 --> 02:59:55.881
ABLE
 TO DO MORE TEST S

02:59:58.581 --> 03:00:01.881
TESTS.  WE CONTINUE TO DO THE
 NEED AND BUILD THE

03:00:02.131 --> 03:00:05.286
CAPACITY TOWARDS THE NEED AND
 NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. I

03:00:05.541 --> 03:00:09.261
WANTED TO START WITH A QUESTION
 TO YOU DR. FAUCI. FIRST OF ALL,

03:00:09.501 --> 03:00:13.301
 THANK YOU FOR THE WORK AND
 EXPERTISE. I WANTED TO TALK

03:00:13.551 --> 03:00:16.940
ABOUT THE NURSING HOME. NEW
 HAMPSHIRE AND THE NUMBER AND 

03:00:16.941 --> 03:00:18.940
THE
 COVID-19 THAT WE HAVE BEEN

03:00:18.941 --> 03:00:22.401
SEEING IS IN NURSING HOMES. WE
 ALL KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE LOST

03:00:22.651 --> 03:00:26.441
 THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS
 IN THE NURSING HOME AND THEN IT

03:00:26.691 --> 03:00:35.621
 WAS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT
 PEOPLE COULD NOT BE THEY SAID

03:00:35.891 --> 03:00:40.511
 THAT ALL 1 MILLION NURSING HOME
 RESIDENCE SHOULD BE TESTED

03:00:40.751 --> 03:00:43.761
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS AS
 WELL AS ALL NURSING HOME STAFF.

03:00:44.011 --> 03:00:47.421
 AS A SHORT TERM GOAL, THAT
 MANGES SENSE TO ME. AFTER THAT,

03:00:47.661 --> 03:00:50.311
 WHAT WILL BE THE ONGOING 
FEDERAL

03:00:50.566 --> 03:00:52.791
RECOMMENDATIONS LOOKING LIKE.
 HOW FREQUENTLY DO WE HAVE TO

03:00:53.051 --> 03:00:56.671
 TEST THEM ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS
 AND WHAT OTHER MEASURES ARE

03:00:56.916 --> 03:01:02.071
NECESSARY TO KEEP THE LOVED ONES
 IN THE FACILITIES SAFE?

03:01:02.431 --> 03:01:07.015
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
 THE GENERAL PLAN THAT YOU

03:01:07.261 --> 03:01:09.991
MENTIONED THAT WAS RECOMMENDED
 BY DR. BURKES WAS A SOUND PLAN

03:01:10.241 --> 03:01:14.601
 IN THE IMMEDIATE. THE QUESTION
 IS IN THE LONG RANG, WE WILL

03:01:14.841 --> 03:01:19.291
 HAVE TO HAVE INFECTION CONTROL
 CAPABILITIES IN NURSING HOMES

03:01:19.631 --> 03:01:23.961
 THAT ARE REALLY PRISTINE AND
 REALLY UNSALABLE. WE HAVE TO DO

03:01:24.221 --> 03:01:31.172
 THE SIR SHRINES AND HAVE THE
 CAME BLTS OF WHEN WE IDENTIFY

03:01:31.421 --> 03:01:34.391
 SOMEONE AND YOU GET OUT OF THAT
 PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT SO THAT

03:01:34.632 --> 03:01:36.632
 IT DOES NOT SPREAD THE 
INFECTION

03:01:36.661 --> 03:01:39.871
THROUGHOUT. OVERALL, IT'S A
 GOOD START. WHEN YOU GO TO

03:01:40.126 --> 03:01:45.031
WHERE YOU NEED TO GO AND THEN
 THE SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITY.

03:01:47.102 --> 03:01:51.092
 HOUSE IS REQUIRING ALL STAFF TO
 WEAR A MASK, AND ANYONE IN

03:01:51.341 --> 03:01:54.361
REGULAR CON TAX WITH THE
 PRESIDENT HATS TO TEST DAILY.

03:01:54.816 --> 03:01:59.062
 DO YOU THINK THAT NURSING HOMES
 SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE SAME

03:01:59.301 --> 03:02:04.121
MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
 SENIORS CAN GET THE SAME LEMME

03:02:04.401 --> 03:02:05.411
 OF PROTECTION?

03:02:05.412 --> 03:02:09.102
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN
 SYSTEM IN PLACE AND THE OPTIMAL

03:02:09.371 --> 03:02:13.381
 PROTECTION OF THE PEOPLE IN THE
 NURSING HOMES, AND THAT WOULD 

03:02:13.382 --> 03:02:15.712
BE
 UNNECESSARILY TESTING EVERY

03:02:16.072 --> 03:02:19.860
PERSON UNDER, BUT THAT'S ONE
 APPROACH THAT MAY NOT BE 

03:02:19.861 --> 03:02:22.412
BRACKET
 WHEN YOU THINK OF THE NURSING

03:02:22.678 --> 03:02:26.061
 HOME IN THE COUNTRY. THERE'S A
 STRICT REGULATION AND 

03:02:26.062 --> 03:02:28.482
GUIDELINES
 ON WHO IS ALLOWED TO GO FER TO

03:02:28.732 --> 03:02:32.941
 THE NURSING HOME AND THEN THE
 STAFF, I BELIEVE, NEEDS TO BE

03:02:33.212 --> 03:02:36.172
 MONITORED VERY CAREFULLY WITH
 THE TESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT 

03:02:36.173 --> 03:02:38.173
WE
 DO NOT HAVE THE INTRODUCTION IN

03:02:38.752 --> 03:02:42.092
 TO THE NURSING HOME OF THE
 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. I'M NOT

03:02:42.333 --> 03:02:45.577
 SURE THAT YOU CAN DO THE 
TESTING

03:02:45.812 --> 03:02:48.682
EVERYDAY. JOTTED THAT IT WOULD
 BE FEASIBLE. SOMETHING THAT IS

03:02:48.992 --> 03:02:52.367
 MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE
 PAST AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE

03:02:52.612 --> 03:02:53.381
 DONE.

03:02:53.382 --> 03:02:56.722
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE LAST
 QUESTION FOR DR. FAUCI AND DR.

03:02:56.992 --> 03:03:01.633
 REDFIELD. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT
 IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET THE MASKS

03:03:02.042 --> 03:03:05.112
 TO EVERYBODY IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE,

03:03:05.362 --> 03:03:11.321
I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THEM TO
 EVERY NURSING HOME EMPLOYEE 

03:03:11.322 --> 03:03:13.322
THAT
 NEEDS THEM.

03:03:16.982 --> 03:03:18.982
COMP

03:03:21.992 --> 03:03:26.147
BOTH ARE FOR
 THE COVID-19 AND THEN THE

03:03:26.652 --> 03:03:30.822
PERSONAL EQUIPMENT EARLY ON IN
 THE CRISIS MADE THINGS WORSE

03:03:31.069 --> 03:03:34.163
 HERE. THOSE THINGS CANNOT BE
 WHEN

03:03:39.122 --> 03:03:41.122
IT COMES TO VACCINE
 DISTRIBUTION.

03:03:47.392 --> 03:03:52.417
AND WHAT STEPS DO
 WE TAKE FOR THE CAPACITY AND

03:03:52.762 --> 03:03:58.061
 THEN THE VACCINE AND WITHOUT
 PUTTING IN THE RISK AND THEN 

03:03:58.062 --> 03:04:03.301
THE
 IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LIKE THE 

03:04:03.302 --> 03:04:05.722
FLUS
 OR MEASLES VACCINE AND MAKING

03:04:06.532 --> 03:04:08.532
 SURE

03:04:11.542 --> 03:04:13.542
THAT ALL ROUTINES ARE ACT
 ASABLE

03:04:16.363 --> 03:04:19.902
AND WHEN I WAS TALK
 ABILITY THE VACCINES FOR

03:04:20.143 --> 03:04:23.763
COVID-19 AND WHAT WE SAID AS WE
 DO THE TESTING ON THE VACCINES

03:04:24.282 --> 03:04:27.663
 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE
 PRODUCTION AT RISK, AND WE WILL

03:04:27.912 --> 03:04:31.717
 START TO PUT HUNDREDS OF
 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL

03:04:32.038 --> 03:04:36.232
 GOVERNMENT MONEY IN TO THE
 DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF

03:04:36.953 --> 03:04:42.003
 THAT VACCINE DOSES BEFORE IT
 EVEN WORKS. YET WHEN WE DO, AND

03:04:42.250 --> 03:04:46.132
 I HOPE THAT WE WILL AND I HAVE
 QUESTIONS THAT WE WILL GET AN

03:04:46.372 --> 03:04:49.392
 AFFECTIVE VACCINE AND THAT WE
 WILL HAVE THE DOSES AVAILABLE 

03:04:49.393 --> 03:04:51.393
TO
 EVERYONE THAT NEEDS IT IN THE

03:04:51.403 --> 03:04:54.288
 UNITED STATES AND EVEN
 CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT IS THE NEEDS

03:04:54.528 --> 03:04:56.803
 GLOBALLY BECAUSE WE'RE
 PARTNERING WITH THE NUMBER OF

03:04:57.042 --> 03:05:00.042
 OTHER COUNTRIES. THE OTHER PART
 OF THE QUESTION IS MAKING SURE

03:05:00.302 --> 03:05:03.443
 THAT WHEN WE GET IN TO A
 SITUATION LIKE THE CO-CALLED

03:05:03.683 --> 03:05:07.118
 SHUT DOWN THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT
 NOW, THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT

03:05:07.373 --> 03:05:10.143
CHILDREN GET THE VACCINATIONS
 THAT THEY NEED. THAT WOULD BE

03:05:10.473 --> 03:05:13.308
 AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF
 SHUTTING DOWN LIKE WE ARE RIGHT

03:05:13.553 --> 03:05:15.553
 NOW. IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.  
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:05:15.798 --> 03:05:18.033
THAT WE DO
 NOT FALL BEHIND ON THAT ALSO.

03:05:18.278 --> 03:05:19.262
 THANK YOU.

03:05:19.263 --> 03:05:24.297
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL
 TAKE MY ANSWER FROM DR. 

03:05:24.298 --> 03:05:26.763
REDFIELD
 OFF LINE.

03:05:27.313 --> 03:05:30.493
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR. SENATOR
 SCOTT.

03:05:30.853 --> 03:05:34.213
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO THE PANEL AND
 THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

03:05:34.463 --> 03:05:36.573
 WITHOUT ANY QUESTION WE FIND
 OURSELF IN

03:05:41.268 --> 03:05:43.268
A SITUATION THAT
 WE'RE NOT.

03:05:54.016 --> 03:05:58.122
AND I AM THINKING OF
 THAT AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT 

03:05:58.123 --> 03:06:00.097
IN
 SOUTH CAROLINA I THINK THAT

03:06:00.098 --> 03:06:02.098
OVERALL THE CASES ARE

03:06:05.353 --> 03:06:07.353
MOVING IN
 THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE HAVE

03:06:07.583 --> 03:06:11.953
 LESS THAN 8 THOR CASES AND THE
 HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS BETTER NOW

03:06:12.273 --> 03:06:14.273
 THAN IT

03:06:17.083 --> 03:06:19.993
WAS WHEN THE PANDEMIC
 STARTED. OUR ABILITY IS I THINK

03:06:20.243 --> 03:06:27.083
 WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.
 WITH THAT IN MIND, I KNEW IN

03:06:27.323 --> 03:06:30.153
 FROM SOUTH CAROLINA TO
 WASHINGTON. WE HAVE THE PLANS

03:06:30.413 --> 03:06:34.413
 TO TEST 220,000 MORE RESIDENCE
 BY THE END OF THIS MONTH.

03:06:34.683 --> 03:06:37.723
FOCUSSING ON THE AT RISK
 POPULATIONS. BY THE END OF THIS

03:06:38.851 --> 03:06:44.682
 MONTH, WE WILL HAVE TESTED
 100% -- 100% OF THE NURSING 

03:06:44.683 --> 03:06:46.372
HOME
 RESIDENCE AND THE STAFF THAT

03:06:46.373 --> 03:06:50.672
 TAKES CARE OF THEM. AFTER
 INCREASING THE CON ABOUT 

03:06:50.673 --> 03:06:52.673
TRACING
 WORKFORCE 20 FOLD IN THE MATTER

03:06:52.703 --> 03:06:55.982
 OF WEEKS, THE STATE DEPARTMENT
 ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT 

03:06:55.983 --> 03:07:00.313
THEY'RE
 GOING INCREASE IT BY AN

03:07:00.743 --> 03:07:05.084
ADDITIONAL 1,400 CONTACT
 TRACERS. WE BUILT AND CONTINUE

03:07:05.323 --> 03:07:08.543
 TO BUILD THE RESOURCES TO HELP
 ISOLATE THE CASES AND MAP THE

03:07:08.783 --> 03:07:11.413
 EXPOSURE AND PREVENT THE SPIKES
 MOVING FORWARD. MOST

03:07:11.673 --> 03:07:14.198
IMPORTANTLY, THE HEALTH CARE
 SYSTEM THANKS IN PART TO THE

03:07:14.624 --> 03:07:17.333
 FLEXIBILITIES FROM THIS
 ADMINISTRATION HAS THE BEDS AND

03:07:17.604 --> 03:07:21.492
 THE QUESTION UPMENT TO ADDRESS
 THE MOST SERIOUS CASES WHEN 

03:07:21.493 --> 03:07:23.262
THEY
 ARRIVE. NOW, WITH THESE TOOLS

03:07:23.263 --> 03:07:26.514
 IN HAND, WE HAVE BEGUN TO
 REOPEN. TO BE CLEAR, WE

03:07:26.993 --> 03:07:34.713
CONTINUE TO SCALE UP THE TESTING
 AND TO TAKE THE MEASURE TO

03:07:34.954 --> 03:07:38.609
PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE.
 FOR THOSE WITH THE CHRONIC

03:07:38.843 --> 03:07:41.094
CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES AND
 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, THIS VIE

03:07:41.359 --> 03:07:45.994
 RISS REMAINS A THREAT. IT'S A
 DANGEROUS THREAT. A RESENT

03:07:46.364 --> 03:07:52.324
REPORT SUGGESTS THAT IN NEW YORK
 ROUGHLY 90% OF THE FATALITIES

03:07:52.569 --> 03:07:55.633
 HAD UNDERLINING ISSUES AND THEN
 TWO-THIRDS OF THE FATALITIES 

03:07:55.634 --> 03:07:57.994
ARE
 30 YEARS OR OLDER. 95% OVER THE

03:07:58.244 --> 03:08:02.764
 AGE OF 50. IN SOUTH CAROLINA
 THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE PATIENTS

03:08:03.154 --> 03:08:07.954
 THAT HAVE DIED FROM THE PATIENT
 76 AND A HALF. NEARLY

03:08:08.495 --> 03:08:13.569
TWO-THIRDS OF FATALITIES HAVE
 BEEN PATIENTS OLDER THAN 71 AND

03:08:13.824 --> 03:08:16.234
 FLESHLY 90% WERE OVER THE AGE 
OF

03:08:16.499 --> 03:08:20.138
60 AND ROUGHLY 98% IN SOUTH
 CAROLINA ARE OVER THE AGE OF 

03:08:20.139 --> 03:08:23.034
50.
 CONTRAST THAT WITH THOSE AGE 20

03:08:23.284 --> 03:08:27.714
 AND YOUNGER WHERE WE HAVE SEEN
 NO DEATHS. FEWER THAN ONE

03:08:27.964 --> 03:08:31.884
PERCENT OF DEATHS IN MY STATE
 HAVE BEEN UNDER THE AGE OF 40.

03:08:33.344 --> 03:08:35.344
 EVERY

03:08:38.544 --> 03:08:42.888
SINGLE DEATH IS A TRAGEDY.
 WE MOURN WITH OUR FAMILY 

03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:44.889
MEMBERS
 THAT

03:08:48.084 --> 03:08:50.084
HAVE LOST THEIR LOVED ONES.

03:08:52.874 --> 03:08:55.584
 WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE
 WITH UNDERLINING CONDITIONS.

03:08:55.844 --> 03:09:01.299
 WHEN WE SET OUT TO FLATTEN THE
 CURVE AND TAKING THE

03:09:01.544 --> 03:09:05.183
UNPRECEDENTED MEASURES LIKE
 STAYING AT HOME ORDERS AND 

03:09:05.184 --> 03:09:06.893
SMALL
 BUSINESS CLOSURES, WE DID NOT

03:09:06.894 --> 03:09:10.764
 SET OUT WITH A GOAL OF
 PREVENTING THE FATALITIES. THAT

03:09:11.004 --> 03:09:16.764
 WOULD BE UNREALISTIC. IT IS
 IMPOSSIBLE. WE DID NOT SET OUT

03:09:17.004 --> 03:09:19.434
 TO KEEP THE QUARANTINES IN 
PLACE

03:09:19.674 --> 03:09:24.934
UNTIL WE FOUND A SAFE AND AIF HE
 CANNIVE VACCINE THAT WOULD TAKE

03:09:25.265 --> 03:09:30.574
 TOO LONG. THERE WAS A HELPFUL
 GRAPHIC SHOWING TWO CURVES. ONE

03:09:30.819 --> 03:09:33.795
 THAT SPIKED HIGH AND THEN THE
 DAILY CASES WITHOUT THE

03:09:34.035 --> 03:09:36.503
PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND THEN THE
 FLATTER CURVE SHOWED THOSE 

03:09:36.504 --> 03:09:38.204
CASES
 WITH THOSE MEASURES IN PLACE.

03:09:38.205 --> 03:09:41.094
 THE WHOLE POINT WHICH THE
 GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATED WAS TO MAKE

03:09:41.334 --> 03:09:45.044
 SURE THAT WE DID NOT EXCEED THE
 HOSPITAL CAPACITY. WHILE I

03:09:45.334 --> 03:09:49.474
RESPECT THE NEED FOR CAUTION,
 WE'RE TWO OFTEN PRESENTED WITH

03:09:49.714 --> 03:09:53.734
 THE FALSE ECONOMY OF SAVING THE
 ECONOMY OR SAVING LIVINGS. WE

03:09:53.985 --> 03:09:58.044
 SEEN THE GOAL POSTS AROUND THE
 FLATTENING THE CURVE MOVE. I

03:09:58.294 --> 03:10:01.214
 THINK THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. AT
 THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE DOING

03:10:02.045 --> 03:10:05.600
 THAT, THE BUSINESSES HAVE
 COLLAPSED AND MENTAL AND

03:10:05.845 --> 03:10:09.115
PHYSICAL HEALTH HAVE DECLINED.
 THE DEATH OF DESPAIR ESCALATE

03:10:09.384 --> 03:10:14.640
 AND THEN THERE'S A NOSE DIVE AS
 WE WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM

03:10:15.035 --> 03:10:18.475
PRAYING FOR GOOD NEWS AROUND THE
 THERAPIES AND AROUND VACCINES.

03:10:18.814 --> 03:10:20.924
 WE SET OUT TO FLATTEN THE 
CURVE,

03:10:21.310 --> 03:10:25.276
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE DONE A
 GOOD JOB OF THAT. WE NEED TO DO

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:29.015
 BETTER, AND WE WILL DO BETTER.
 MY QUESTION IS AS WE START THE

03:10:29.255 --> 03:10:34.075
 PROCESS OF MOVING TOWARDS
 REOPENING SOUTH CAROLINA, WHAT

03:10:34.355 --> 03:10:38.225
 ELSE DO YOU SUGGEST THAT WE CAN
 DO TO

03:10:41.695 --> 03:10:43.715
PROTECT THE MOST
 VULNERABLE POPULATIONS?

03:10:43.955 --> 03:10:48.625
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR SCOTT.
 YOU GAVE A REALLY ELEGANT

03:10:48.875 --> 03:10:52.105
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I THINK IS
 ONE OF THE MODEL WAYS THE WAY

03:10:52.345 --> 03:10:56.055
 THAT YOU APPROACH THIS. I MEAN
 YOU HAVE PUT THINGS IN PLACE

03:10:56.365 --> 03:11:00.675
 THAT I THINK WOULD OPTIMIZE THE
 CAPABILITY OF REOPENING, AND AS

03:11:01.055 --> 03:11:06.145
 I WAS THINKING AS YOU WERE
 SPEAKING, I ALMOST WON'T TO

03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:09.400
CLONE THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT
 OTHER PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THAT 

03:11:09.401 --> 03:11:11.401
AND
 SEE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING.

03:11:11.565 --> 03:11:13.785
 THE ISSUE OF YOUR DIRECT
 QUESTION TO ME

03:11:17.195 --> 03:11:20.675
ON THE VULNERABLE
 POPULATIONS IS THAT AND THEN

03:11:21.025 --> 03:11:25.715
 YOU'RE PUTTING THE PLACE IN A
 GOOD SYSTEM. THE VON SXRABL THE

03:11:25.965 --> 03:11:28.444
 ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH THE
 UNDERLINING CONDITIONS SHOULD 

03:11:28.445 --> 03:11:31.825
BE
 THOSE AT THE VERY LAST OF

03:11:32.115 --> 03:11:35.475
LIFTING OF THE MITIGATIONS
 SHOULD BE THOSE WHO ARE LEFT IN

03:11:35.715 --> 03:11:39.315
 A SITUATION WHERE THEY MIGHT BE
 IN DANGER OF GETTING INFECTED.

03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:43.935
 IN OTHER WORDS, PROTECT THEM UP
 UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE

03:11:44.240 --> 03:11:47.205
RELAXATION OF THE MITIGATION.
 AS YOU SAID, VERY CORRECTLY,

03:11:47.495 --> 03:11:52.845
 THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT
 ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE FOR THE

03:11:53.095 --> 03:11:55.960
 MORBITTY AND MORTALITY. THOSE
 ARE THE INDIVIDUAL S AND

03:11:56.205 --> 03:11:58.305
PARTICULARLY I MAY SAY THAT

03:12:03.305 --> 03:12:06.725
 THOSE IN THE MORBITTY GROUP 
HAVE

03:12:06.975 --> 03:12:10.210
A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF NOT
 GETTING IN FACTOIDED BY HAVING

03:12:10.455 --> 03:12:15.348
 THE UNDERLINING CONDITIONS THAT
 WOULD MAKE THE RISK FOR A

03:12:20.305 --> 03:12:22.305
HIGH
 DEGREE OF MORBIDITY HIGHER.

03:12:26.855 --> 03:12:29.105
GETTING IN FACTOIDED BY HAVING
 THE UNDERLINING CONDITIONS THAT

03:12:29.355 --> 03:12:32.851
 WOULD MAKE THE RISK FOR A HIGH
 DEGREE OF MORBIDITY HIGHER.

03:12:33.125 --> 03:12:38.070
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DR. FAUCI. I WANT
 TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE

03:12:38.446 --> 03:12:41.755
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD
 ABOUT THE VULNERABLE 

03:12:41.756 --> 03:12:43.494
POPULATIONS
 YOU CLING MINORITIES AND SENIOR

03:12:43.495 --> 03:12:46.789
 CITIZEN. I WILL SAY WHEN YOU
 LOOK AT THE NURSING HOMES IT'S

03:12:47.026 --> 03:12:48.515
 TYPICALLY AFTERNOON CAN 
AMERICAN

03:12:48.516 --> 03:12:50.785
AND HISPANICS ARE THE CERTIFIED
 NURSING ASSISTANCES THAT ARE

03:12:51.025 --> 03:12:53.936
 PROVIDING THE CARE. YOUR FOCUS
 ON THOSE TWO VERY VULNERABLE

03:12:54.186 --> 03:12:56.896
 GROUPS IS MUCH APPRECIATED AND
 THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERTISE.

03:13:00.866 --> 03:13:03.881
SENATOR SMITH GE THANK VOW SO
 MUCH CHAIR ALEXANDER AND THANKS

03:13:04.135 --> 03:13:08.746
 TO ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE
 TODAY AND THE SERVICE. DR.

03:13:09.126 --> 03:13:14.471
FAUCI, YOU'RE IN THE POSITION OF
 BEING THE PERSON THAT SO MANY

03:13:14.716 --> 03:13:17.666
 AMERICANS IN MINNESOTA TRUST TO
 GIVE US THE STRAIGHT SCOPE AND

03:13:18.056 --> 03:13:20.786
 TELL US WHAT IS REALLY
 HAPPENING. YOU'RE ABOUT THE

03:13:21.026 --> 03:13:24.306
FACTS AND NOT THE POLITICS.
 THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. I

03:13:24.646 --> 03:13:31.076
 HAVE TO START BY ASKING A
 QUESTION THAT I THINK A LOT OF

03:13:31.326 --> 03:13:34.931
 AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS
 HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW ARE YOU

03:13:35.176 --> 03:13:37.376
 HOLDING UP? IT'S BEEN AN
 UNBELIEVABLE EFFORT.

03:13:37.621 --> 03:13:41.746
&gt;&gt; I AM DOING FINE. THANK YOU
 SENATOR FOR ASKING. THIS IS AN

03:13:41.986 --> 03:13:43.635
 IMPORTANT PROBLEM AND 
TRANSCENDS

03:13:43.636 --> 03:13:49.546
ALL OF US AND WORKING AS A TEAM.
 I ENJOY WORKING WITH THE

03:13:49.787 --> 03:13:52.516
SENATORS AND GOVERNORS BECAUSE
 IT'S AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT

03:13:52.776 --> 03:13:56.131
 WE'RE GOING MAKE THIS THING
 WORK. I AM FINE, AND I

03:13:56.376 --> 03:13:57.370
APPRECIATE MY CONCERN.

03:13:57.371 --> 03:14:00.565
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING
 ABILITY YOU AND GRATEFUL FOR 

03:14:00.566 --> 03:14:02.566
THE
 SERVICE AS

03:14:04.586 --> 03:14:07.776
WE ARE FOR ALL OF
 YOU. I THINK FIRST OF WHAT IS

03:14:08.036 --> 03:14:12.286
 HAPPENING IN THE HOME STATE OF
 MINNESOTA AND AGRICULTURE IS AN

03:14:12.656 --> 03:14:16.586
 IMPORTANT PART OF THE STATE 
WORK

03:14:16.976 --> 03:14:21.046
AND HISTORY AND THE CORE
 PROCESSES RIGHT NOW ARE LOOKING

03:14:21.581 --> 03:14:25.026
 AT THE REALITY OF THOUSANDS OF
 HOGS A DAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO

03:14:25.281 --> 03:14:27.281
 PLACE TO PROCESS THEM BECAUSE 
OF

03:14:27.446 --> 03:14:29.705
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE
 PROCESSING PLANTS. THE PEOPLE

03:14:29.946 --> 03:14:33.445
 THAT DO THE HARD WORK IN THE
 PROFESSIONING PLANTS ARE 

03:14:33.446 --> 03:14:35.666
GETTING
 SICK. HERE IS ONE STORY, AND

03:14:36.396 --> 03:14:38.656
 THIS IS A WORKER AND THEY WROTE

03:14:41.907 --> 03:14:43.907
 ABOUT THIS AND THIS IS NAMED 
AND

03:14:44.116 --> 03:14:48.556
SHE IS A MOM THAT WORKS WITH THE
 CONTRACTOR THAT DOES THE

03:14:48.796 --> 03:14:52.026
CLEANING AND WORKS FOR $14 AN
 HOUR AND 7 HOURS DAY AND FIVE

03:14:52.286 --> 03:14:59.836
 DAYS A WEEK, AND HER JOB IS TO
 SANITIZE THE MACHINES THAT

03:15:00.176 --> 03:15:04.396
PROCESS THE MEAT.
 SHE STARTED TO FEEL SICK ON

03:15:04.787 --> 03:15:11.496
APRIL 11th, BUT SHE KEPT ONGOING
 WORK. ON APRIL 21st WHEN ONE OF

03:15:11.738 --> 03:15:14.756
 THE CO-WORKERS FARNTED, SHE 
TOLD

03:15:15.001 --> 03:15:17.757
THE SUPERVISOR THAT SHE WAS
 FEELING SICK. SHE WAS TOLD IF

03:15:17.997 --> 03:15:21.416
 SHE WAS NOT FEELING SIGNS OF
 ILLNESS TO COME BACK. SHE WENT

03:15:21.657 --> 03:15:23.657
 TO THE DOCTOR AND

03:15:27.746 --> 03:15:29.746
PAID $115 TO
 GET A TEST

03:15:50.916 --> 03:15:55.597
AND A BIG PART OF
 WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

03:15:55.837 --> 03:15:59.117
 TODAY THIS SAID FACILITIES
 SHOULD CONSIDER THE APPROPRIATE

03:15:59.747 --> 03:16:01.747
 ROLL OF

03:16:05.787 --> 03:16:10.697
TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE
 CONTACT TRACING AS WE THINK OF

03:16:10.947 --> 03:16:12.947
 HOW WE MOVE FORWARD, WE ALL 
WANT

03:16:13.207 --> 03:16:16.687
TO OPEN UP THE ECONOMY AND WHAT
 GUIDANCE WOULD YOU GIVE US IN

03:16:16.937 --> 03:16:18.937
 THE SITUATION

03:16:22.077 --> 03:16:24.077
LIKE THIS HERE IN
 MINNESOTA?

03:16:25.127 --> 03:16:28.227
&gt;&gt; WELL, I CAN QUAV YOU MY
 COMMON SENSE GUIDEN. IT'S NOT

03:16:28.657 --> 03:16:32.527
 MY EXPERTISE BUT THERE'S MORE
 OTHERS THAT SEEM IF YOU WANT TO

03:16:32.802 --> 03:16:34.802
 KEEP THINGS LIKE PACKING

03:16:38.537 --> 03:16:41.437
PLANTS
 OPEN, YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE

03:16:41.687 --> 03:16:44.747
 PROTECTION FOR THE WORKERS
 INVOLVED AND ALLOWED THEM TO GO

03:16:44.987 --> 03:16:48.216
 TO WORK SAFELY AND IF AND WHEN
 THEY GET INFECTED TO 

03:16:48.217 --> 03:16:50.347
IMMEDIATELY
 BE ABLE TO GET THEM OUT AND

03:16:54.857 --> 03:16:56.857
GIVE
 THEM THE PROPER CARE.

03:16:59.507 --> 03:17:02.097
YOU HAVE
 TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE WELL

03:17:02.607 --> 03:17:08.708
 TAKEN CARE OF. THAT'S NOT A
 PROLA MACIOL BUT SPEAKING AS A

03:17:08.957 --> 03:17:10.616
 PHYSICIAN AND HUMAN BEING.

03:17:10.617 --> 03:17:14.057
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I THINK THAT YOU
 SPEAK AS A HUMAN BEING BUT ALSO

03:17:14.312 --> 03:17:16.548
 AS THE CHIEF OF THE COUNTRY AND
 THE

03:17:20.577 --> 03:17:23.951
PERSON THAT WE ALL TRUST.
 THERE'S THE POINT THAT I WANT 

03:17:23.952 --> 03:17:27.547
TO
 DRIVE HOME. THIS IS THE

03:17:27.927 --> 03:17:32.447
GUIDANCE THAT WE'RE GETTING AND
 FOLLOWING. THIS IS WHAT NEEDS

03:17:32.717 --> 03:17:36.487
 TO BE AND THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE
 IN THE COUNTRY IF YOU'RE GOING

03:17:36.727 --> 03:17:40.507
 TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY AS WE ALL
 WANT TO DO. IF WE MOVE TOWARDS

03:17:40.767 --> 03:17:43.838
 REOPENING THE PROJECT AND WE
 HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE

03:17:44.078 --> 03:17:46.587
WE'RE HAVING AT THE PROCESSING
 PLANTING AND OTHER PLACES 

03:17:46.588 --> 03:17:48.588
AROUND
 THE STATE, WE'RE GOING TO BE

03:17:53.148 --> 03:17:55.628
 RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED 
STARTED BUT

03:17:55.868 --> 03:17:57.391
IN A WORST PLACE.

03:17:57.392 --> 03:18:02.866
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR. IT DOES
 RELATE TO THE QUESTIONS THAT 

03:18:02.867 --> 03:18:04.747
ONE
 OF YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATORS ASK

03:18:04.748 --> 03:18:08.338
 ME BEFORE. ONE OF THE THINGS
 THAT I KEEP ON SAYING IS THAT

03:18:08.617 --> 03:18:12.708
 HEN YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
 OPENING UP AND PULLING BACK ON

03:18:13.077 --> 03:18:17.838
 MITIGATION, YOU REALLY MUST 
HAVE

03:18:18.187 --> 03:18:20.683
IN PLACE ST. CAPABILITY OF
 RESPONDING WHEN THERE'S AN

03:18:20.918 --> 03:18:24.239
UPTICK OF THE CASES. THAT WILL
 ABSOLUTELY OCCUR. IT'S HOW WE

03:18:24.878 --> 03:18:28.708
 DEAL WITH IT AND HOW SUCCESSFUL
 WE ARE IN PUTTING THE CLAMPS ON

03:18:28.948 --> 03:18:30.948
 IT THAT'S GOING TO PREVENT US

03:18:35.578 --> 03:18:37.578
 FROM GETTING THE KIND OF 
REBOUND

03:18:44.008 --> 03:18:44.742
REBOUND.

03:18:44.743 --> 03:18:46.818
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

03:18:51.838 --> 03:18:53.838
SENATOR
 SMITH. SENATOR RON.

03:18:59.093 --> 03:19:04.238
 THE SENATOR SPOKE. I UNDERSTAND
 THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FRAME THE

03:19:04.648 --> 03:19:07.338
 DATA THAT'S MOST POSITIVE
 POLITICALLY. I DO NOT EXPECT

03:19:07.571 --> 03:19:11.078
 THAT FROM THE ADMIRAL.
 YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT WE DID

03:19:11.333 --> 03:19:15.318
 MORE TEST THAN SOUTH KOREA. YOU
 IGNORED THE FACT THAT THEY DID

03:19:16.348 --> 03:19:19.958
 THIS AT THE BEGINNING AND WE
 TRADED WATER IN FEBRUARY

03:19:24.878 --> 03:19:29.638
AND
 MARCH. AS A RESULT AND THEN

03:19:29.888 --> 03:19:34.738
THERE WERE 140,000 TESTS. AS A
 RESULT OF THAT, THERE'S 246

03:19:34.988 --> 03:19:37.943
DEATHS AND WE HAVE ALMOST 80,000
 DEATHS. I FIND THAT OUR TESTING

03:19:38.208 --> 03:19:41.733
 RECORD IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE
 WHATSOEVER. THE FACT IS THAT

03:19:42.298 --> 03:19:46.218
 THEY'RE TEST NUMBERS ARE GOING
 DOWN BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE

03:19:46.513 --> 03:19:53.548
 THE OUTBREAK THAT WE HAVE. OURS
 ARE GOING UP AS THEY HAVE TO. I

03:19:53.788 --> 03:19:55.787
 THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US 
AS

03:19:55.788 --> 03:19:58.858
WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. MY
 IMPRESSION WITH REGARDS TO

03:19:59.108 --> 03:20:03.008
VACCINES AND WHERE I'M CRITICAL
 IS THAT WE HAVE DONE A DARN

03:20:08.008 --> 03:20:09.747
GOOD
 JOB OF MOVING AHEAD

03:20:09.748 --> 03:20:11.748
AGGRESSIVELY.

03:20:17.958 --> 03:20:21.608
THEY SAID IT'S
 DOING SOMETHING AND THEN ARE

03:20:21.848 --> 03:20:24.558
 EITHERMENT TRUMP OR OBAMA
 RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FACT THAT 

03:20:24.559 --> 03:20:27.319
WE
 HAVE A VACCINE NOW OR IN

03:20:27.571 --> 03:20:29.571
DELAYING IT IN

03:20:32.258 --> 03:20:33.497
SOME WAY?

03:20:33.498 --> 03:20:38.098
&gt;&gt; NO, SENATOR THEY'RE NOT
 RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVING THE

03:20:38.458 --> 03:20:45.938
VACCINE. WE MOVED AS WE SAID
 BECAUSE I DESCRIBED IN THE

03:20:46.188 --> 03:20:48.188
OPENING STATEMENT AND

03:20:51.759 --> 03:20:54.107
IN KNOWING
 THE VIRUS AND I DON'T THINK 

03:20:54.108 --> 03:20:55.858
THAT
 THERE'S DOING ANYTHING WRONG IN

03:20:55.859 --> 03:20:57.848
 THAT. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.  
THAT'S THE CORRECT WAY TO

03:20:57.849 --> 03:20:59.267
DO IT.  
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  THAT WAS

03:20:59.268 --> 03:21:03.899
MY
 IMPRESSION. I WAS SURPRISED WE

03:21:04.559 --> 03:21:07.030
 THE COMMENT.
 TAVS MY IMPRESSION. SENATOR AND

03:21:07.324 --> 03:21:11.869
 I WROTE A LETTER EXPRESSING THE
 DISMAY AT THE LACK OF THE

03:21:12.115 --> 03:21:15.419
ROADWAY TIME DATA. I MEAN THE
 DEMOGRAPHIC HOSPITALIZATION

03:21:18.999 --> 03:21:20.999
AND
 THEN THE TREATMENT DATA. HOW IS

03:21:21.219 --> 03:21:24.609
 IT POSSIBLE THAT THE CDC HAS 
NOT

03:21:24.969 --> 03:21:32.004
ESTABLISHED A REAL TIME SYSTEM
 AND WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO TO

03:21:32.249 --> 03:21:35.789
RECTIFY THAT SO THAT WE NERVE
 HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE

03:21:36.039 --> 03:21:38.039
 THIS AGAIN?

03:21:46.559 --> 03:21:48.559
QUESTION. I THINK THAT YOU

03:21:52.339 --> 03:21:54.339
HAVE
 HIT ONE OF THE

03:21:58.739 --> 03:22:00.919
SDSH HOW
 IMPORTANT IT IS. I THINK THAT

03:22:01.389 --> 03:22:06.269
 CONGRESS HAS MOVED FORWARD AND
 PROVIDED THE FUNDING FOR DATA

03:22:06.519 --> 03:22:12.449
 MODERNIZATION. WE'RE IN THE
 PROCESS OF EARN IMPLEMENTING.

03:22:12.809 --> 03:22:17.864
 THE REALITY IS THAT THERE'S A
 PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. EACH

03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:21.589
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS
 THEIR OWN HEALTH SYSTEMS. THIS

03:22:21.829 --> 03:22:25.319
 NATION NEEDS A MODERN HIGHLY
 CAPABLE DATA ANALYTICS SYSTEM

03:22:25.579 --> 03:22:27.579
 THIS CAN DO

03:22:29.879 --> 03:22:32.444
THE ANALYSIS. IT'S
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN

03:22:32.679 --> 03:22:35.899
 IDENTIFIED AS WE WENT THROUGH
 THE OUTBREAK. I COULD NOT AGREE

03:22:36.149 --> 03:22:41.329
 WITH YOU MORE. IT'S TIME TO GET
 THAT CORRECT.

03:22:41.579 --> 03:22:44.959
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I ASSUME THAT
 IT'S NOT BUILD IT OURSELF BUT

03:22:45.204 --> 03:22:48.119
 WORK WITH THE COMPANIES THAT
 HAVE THE CAPACITY AND WORK

03:22:53.079 --> 03:22:55.079
WITH
 IT IN THE FAVOR.

03:23:10.261 --> 03:23:12.750
AND GIVE US
 FOR THE OTHER CORONAVIRUS AND

03:23:12.990 --> 03:23:17.290
 THEN HOW LIKELY IS IT. IS IT
 EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT WE'RE

03:23:17.529 --> 03:23:21.699
GOING TO GET A VACCINE WITHIN A
 YEAR OR TWO. IS IT MORE LIKELY

03:23:21.949 --> 03:23:24.528
 THAN NOT OR IS IT A LONG SHOT?

03:23:24.529 --> 03:23:29.979
&gt;&gt; IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A LONG
 SHOT SENATOR ROMNEY. I THINK

03:23:30.220 --> 03:23:33.819
 IT'S MORE LIKELY NOT THAT WE
 WILL. THIS IS A VIRUS THAT

03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:36.070
REDUCES THE IMMUNE

03:23:39.769 --> 03:23:41.769
RESPONSE AND
 THAT PEOPLE RECOVER. MAJORITY

03:23:41.930 --> 03:23:44.010
 RECOVER. THERE'S THE MORBIDITY

03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:51.030
AND THEN THE LESS POPULATION.

03:23:54.540 --> 03:23:58.635
 THIS TELLS ME THAT WE CAN
 STIMULATE THE BODY WITH A

03:23:58.870 --> 03:24:01.980
VACCINE THAT'S GOING TO CONDUCE
 A SIMILAR RESPONSE. I THINK

03:24:02.230 --> 03:24:06.060
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. I THINK
 THAT IT'S CLEARLY MORE LIKELY

03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:09.980
 THAN NOT THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE
 TIME FRAME, WE WILL GET A

03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:11.919
VACCINE FOR THE VIRUS.

03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:14.110
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I YIELD.  
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR ROMNEY

03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:21.730
.
 WE HAVE FOUR MORE SENATORS AND

03:24:22.050 --> 03:24:25.030
 WANT THEM TO ANSWER THE
 QUESTIONS.

03:24:25.570 --> 03:24:29.670
&gt;&gt; THANKS TO THE WITNESSES FOR
 ALL OF THEM BEING HERE AND THEN

03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:33.910
 FOR THE INCREDIBLE SERVICE
 DURING THIS TIME. I WANT TO

03:24:34.171 --> 03:24:37.550
FOLLOW UP QUICK WITH AN
 ADDITIONAL THING THAT SENATOR

03:24:37.905 --> 03:24:44.590
 ROMNEY TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD
 TO SOUTH KOREA. THAT'S THE FACT

03:24:44.830 --> 03:24:50.710
 THAT WE'RE A NATION WITH THE
 POPULATION OF SOUTH KOREA AND

03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:52.951
 THEY HAVE THREE TIMES THE 
NUMBER

03:24:52.952 --> 03:24:57.410
OF DEATHS. I THINK THAT WE HAVE
 TO BE CAREFUL IN MAKING THE

03:24:57.650 --> 03:25:01.030
COMPARISONS AROUND THE WORLD.
 DR. REELED FIELD, I WANT TO

03:25:01.280 --> 03:25:04.500
FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT THE SENATOR
 AND I THINK

03:25:08.430 --> 03:25:11.305
SENATOR KING TALKED
 ABOUT THE CONTACT TRACES. I

03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:14.550
UNCTION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
 WORK WITH THE STATES FOR THE

03:25:14.805 --> 03:25:18.209
 PLANS OF REOPENING. THE CON
 TABLTH TRACING IS IMPORTANT, 

03:25:18.210 --> 03:25:20.335
BUT
 USING THAT DATA AS WELL IS FOG

03:25:20.580 --> 03:25:24.930
 TO BE OR NOT IN TERMS OF THE
 QUARANTINE PLANS THAT SENATOR

03:25:25.300 --> 03:25:29.485
 MURPHY TALKED ABILITY AND CHILD
 CARE FACILITIES TO ALLOW PEOPLE

03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:35.210
 TO PUT THEIR KIDS IN A FACILITY
 WHILE THEY'RE STILL GOING BACK

03:25:35.460 --> 03:25:38.190
 TO WORK. ALL OF THOSE ISSUES
 INCLUDING MAYBE EVEN FACILITIES

03:25:38.600 --> 03:25:42.025
 LIKE THE VACANT HOTELS AND
 MOTELS THAT MAYBE USED FOR

03:25:42.270 --> 03:25:46.600
SELF-ISOLATION. HOW IS THIS
 PLAN BEING DEVELOPED WITHIN THE

03:25:46.881 --> 03:25:51.101
 CDC? ARE THOSE PLANS GOING TO
 BE VISUALIZED BY THE STATE?

03:25:51.350 --> 03:25:55.382
WILL WE AS A MEMB WERE OF
 CONGRESS HAVE ACCESS TO THE

03:25:55.630 --> 03:25:57.630
PLANS AND HOW ARE THE STATES

03:26:01.921 --> 03:26:06.810
 GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. ER OF 
CONGRESS

03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:10.901
HAVE ACCESS TO THE PLANS AND HOW
 ARE THE STATES GOING TO PAY FOR

03:26:11.211 --> 03:26:16.280
 THIS. MY STATE IS TALKING ABOUT
 BUILDING A STATE HOUSE AND NOT

03:26:16.641 --> 03:26:20.891
 DOING THE CONTRACT TRACING AND
 TESTING. I WANT YOU TO DRILL

03:26:21.140 --> 03:26:25.816
 DOWN WHAT ACCESS AND THE PLANS
 OF BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM.

03:27:00.001 --> 03:27:03.351
AND
 THE CDC IS IN THE POSITION THAT

03:27:03.711 --> 03:27:07.201
 THEY HAVE PREPROGRAMMED AND
 INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS

03:27:07.441 --> 03:27:10.471
 THE COUNTRY AND THEN WE'RE
 BEGINNING TO HELP EACH OF THE

03:27:10.716 --> 03:27:13.321
 STATES. WE HAVE AMENDED THAT
 WITH THE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

03:27:13.561 --> 03:27:17.141
 THAT WE HAVE ON BOARD STATE BY
 STATE THROUGH THE FOUNDATION,

03:27:17.381 --> 03:27:21.661
 AND WE HAVE ABOUT $106 BILLION
 OF THE MONEY THAT CONGRESS IS

03:27:21.926 --> 03:27:25.201
 APPROPRIATE FLOOD TO THE STATES
 SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO TALK

03:27:25.441 --> 03:27:30.241
 ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO HIRE FOR
 THE RETURN CONTACT TRACING

03:27:30.491 --> 03:27:36.140
CAPABILITIES, AND THEN OF COURSE
 IT WAS MENTIONED THAT WE AND 

03:27:36.141 --> 03:27:38.141
THE
 OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND

03:27:38.721 --> 03:27:44.562
 THE PEACE CORP. AND THAT EACH
 GROUP IS GOING INSTRUCT THEIR

03:27:44.816 --> 03:27:49.221
 CONTACT TRACING PIECE TO WHAT
 THEY THINK THAT THE NEEDS ARE.

03:27:49.581 --> 03:27:54.986
 I DO THINK THAT IT'S SIMILAR TO
 WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE SENATOR

03:27:55.231 --> 03:27:57.431
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA, THESE ARE
 SIGNIFICANT UNDERSTAND CREASES.

03:27:57.681 --> 03:28:00.716
 I THINK THEY'RE GOING INCREASE
 AGAIN. THE POINT THAT YOU

03:28:00.961 --> 03:28:03.675
BROUGHT UP IS CRITICALLY
 IMPORTANT ALSO. WE FOUND THAT

03:28:04.126 --> 03:28:06.891
 AS WE ALSO STRUGGLE WITH THE
 DIFFERENT AMERICANS AROUND THE

03:28:07.152 --> 03:28:10.431
 COUNTRY WHERE WE HAD THE PUT
 MANY OF THEM IN QUARANTINE AND

03:28:10.721 --> 03:28:12.721
 AS

03:28:15.383 --> 03:28:19.888
YOU KNOW THERE'S A MILITARY
 BASIS AND WHERE DO THEY PUT

03:28:20.121 --> 03:28:22.121
SOMEONE

03:28:24.822 --> 03:28:29.412
IN THE ISOLATION THAT'S
 HOMELESS. AND THEN IS THERE A

03:28:29.732 --> 03:28:34.021
 CERTAIN HOTEL AND THEN I TAKE
 THE POINT THAT WAS MADE BY ONE

03:28:34.302 --> 03:28:36.302
 OF

03:28:38.602 --> 03:28:42.182
THE OTHER SENATORS IS SO
 IMPORTANT

03:28:52.351 --> 03:28:58.501
AND THEN HAVE TO HAVE
 AN AFFECTIVE WAY TO IDENTIFY 

03:28:58.502 --> 03:29:00.542
THE
 CASES AND THEN DO THE

03:29:00.787 --> 03:29:04.076
APPROPRIATE HEALTH MEASURE AND
 THEN THINGS HAVE TO BE

03:29:04.432 --> 03:29:06.947
COMPREHENSIVE AND THEN THERE'S
 THE JURISDICTION AT A TIME. I

03:29:07.182 --> 03:29:14.141
 SEE NO REASON WHY THESE ARE NOT
 TRANSPARENT COBMENTS AS THEY 

03:29:14.142 --> 03:29:16.142
GET
 COMPLETED. IT REALLY IS

03:29:16.218 --> 03:29:20.642
ATTRIBUTING TO THE SUPPORT THAT
 YOU HAVE GIVEN SO FAR. AS I

03:29:24.032 --> 03:29:27.512
SAID $1.6 BILLION GOT IN

03:29:32.542 --> 03:29:34.542
TO THE
 STATE. IT'S FUNDSMENTLE

03:29:36.802 --> 03:29:40.922
. WE
 DON'T HAVE TO SWITCH FROM

03:29:41.172 --> 03:29:41.931
MITIGATION.

03:29:41.932 --> 03:29:44.281
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

03:29:44.282 --> 03:29:46.982
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DR. REDFIELD.
 APPRECIATE IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:29:47.382 --> 03:29:50.591
 WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO
 DO. THANK YOU.  

03:29:50.592 --> 03:29:52.592
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH

03:29:54.912 --> 03:29:56.912
, SENATOR
 JONES.

03:30:11.002 --> 03:30:17.021
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
 REMEMBER IF THE FDA WAS GOING 

03:30:17.022 --> 03:30:20.152
TO
 BE MORE AND IF THE FDA AND THEN

03:30:20.412 --> 03:30:23.542
 TALKING ABOUT HOW WE FIX THE
 HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN GENERAL.

03:30:23.782 --> 03:30:27.452
 NOW, THIS IS BROUGHT IT IN TO
 THE CLEAR FOCUS. I HAVE GOT A

03:30:27.692 --> 03:30:31.662
 TIMELINE, AND I'M GOING SUBMIT
 FOR THE RECORD THAT SHOWS FROM

03:30:32.042 --> 03:30:37.552
 JANUARY 24TH THROUGH MARCH 5TH,
 AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHAT

03:30:38.637 --> 03:30:43.632
 SENATOR BURR ASKED EARLIER HAS
 THE ADMINISTRATION EVER PUT IN

03:30:44.042 --> 03:30:47.642
 FRONT OF TRYING TO GET TO
 TESTING? DR. HAHN, THIS WILL

03:30:47.882 --> 03:30:52.212
 END UP IN A QUESTION IN A
 MOMENT. THERE WAS A SPAN OF

03:30:52.593 --> 03:30:56.367
TIME FROM JANUARY 24TH THROUGH
 MARCH 5TH AND I HOPE THAT THE

03:30:56.682 --> 03:31:01.707
 AMERICAN PUBLIC LOOKS AT. IT
 GETS BACK TO WHAT IS WRONG WITH

03:31:02.078 --> 03:31:06.738
 THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN
 GENERAL. EARLY TESTING FROM

03:31:06.992 --> 03:31:10.502
WHAT I AM SEEING WAS CREATED BY
 THE FACT THAT THE CDC SAID IT

03:31:10.742 --> 03:31:12.792
 WAS GOING TO DO THEY'RE OWN 
TEST

03:31:13.042 --> 03:31:16.667
AND THE SOUTH KOREAN TEST THAT
 GETS CITED SO OFTEN WAS NOT

03:31:16.913 --> 03:31:20.643
GOING TO BE LOOKED AT. WE HAD
 TO DO OUR OWN. I KNOW THE FDA

03:31:20.903 --> 03:31:25.941
 WORK WITH THE CDC BUT THE LONG
 AND SHORT OF ALL OF THIS IS 

03:31:25.942 --> 03:31:31.223
THAT
 FOR NEARLY A MONTH THIS WAS IN

03:31:31.977 --> 03:31:35.659
 THAT SWIRL. THE FDA PREVENTED
 THE PRIVATE AND ACADEMIC

03:31:35.902 --> 03:31:40.288
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TESTS FOR
 WEEKS. THE CDC DENIED THE

03:31:40.713 --> 03:31:46.265
ACCESS TO FUNCTIONING TESTS AS I
 CITED IN SOUTH KOREA. THIS

03:31:46.566 --> 03:31:52.683
CREATED THROUGH ALL OF THE RED
 TAPE TO WHERE WE HAD TO COME UP

03:31:53.064 --> 03:31:56.193
 WITH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL
 APPROACH DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY

03:31:56.433 --> 03:31:59.953
 OF THE VIRUS, AND WE'RE STUCK
 WITH THAT NOW. I DON'T WANT TO

03:32:00.203 --> 03:32:02.928
 DWELL ON THAT NECESSARILY
 BECAUSE I THINK THOSE WERE

03:32:03.173 --> 03:32:06.513
MISTAKES THAT I MADE. I AM
 TIRED OF HAVING IT HEARD THAT

03:32:07.203 --> 03:32:13.443
 IT'S THE ADMINISTRATIONS FAULT.
 DR. HAHN, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

03:32:13.733 --> 03:32:19.083
 YOU A QUESTION. IN THE SPIRIT
 OF THE OF NATION PROCESS, HERE

03:32:19.963 --> 03:32:22.598
 GOING FORWARD, WILL WE SHED 
SOME

03:32:22.843 --> 03:32:28.613
OF THAT? WILL WE LOOK TO GET
 THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES

03:32:28.873 --> 03:32:32.983
THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN A QUICKER
 METHOD BECAUSE I FEAR IF WE DO

03:32:34.183 --> 03:32:38.348
 NOT, AND IF WE TREAT THROUGH 
THE

03:32:39.653 --> 03:32:43.093
BUREAUCRACY THROUGH THE EARLY
 PERIOD OF TESTING, WE CAN BE

03:32:43.333 --> 03:32:46.913
 LABOR THIS IN TO THE DISTANCE
 FUTURE, AND AT THAT POINT

03:32:47.293 --> 03:32:50.023
THERE'S NOT ONLY THE DISEASE
 ITSELF BUT THE ECONOMY TO DEAL

03:32:50.263 --> 03:32:56.613
 WITH. I WOULD LIKE YOUR COMMENT
 ON THAT ONE MONTH STRETCH, WHAT

03:32:57.043 --> 03:33:01.233
 ACCOUNTABILITY THE FDA AND CDC
 HAVE AND THEN WHETHER IT LOOKS

03:33:01.533 --> 03:33:05.143
 BETTER IN TERMS OF MOVING MORE
 QUICKLY IN TO THE FUTURE.

03:33:05.403 --> 03:33:09.493
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SENATOR WITHDRAWN
 FOR THE QUESTION. OUR TIMELINE

03:33:09.743 --> 03:33:11.642
 OF THAT PERIOD DEMONSTRATES 
THAT

03:33:11.643 --> 03:33:16.883
WE START TODAY WORK WITH THE
 TEST DEVELOPERS BEYOND CDC ON

03:33:17.153 --> 03:33:20.303
 JANUARY 24TH AND HAD THE DOUBLE
 DIGIT OF NUMBERS WORKING WITH

03:33:20.543 --> 03:33:26.123
 US. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE
 IDENTIFIED WAS IN FACT THE

03:33:26.478 --> 03:33:32.214
AVAILABILITY OF THE VIRUS AND
 OTHER SUPPLIES TO GET THAT

03:33:32.463 --> 03:33:34.953
TESTING DEVELOPMENT DONE IN A
 TIMELY FASHION. SENATOR, I

03:33:35.203 --> 03:33:38.182
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT
 THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE 

03:33:38.183 --> 03:33:40.183
A
 LOOK AND DETERMINE HOW YOU CAN

03:33:40.373 --> 03:33:43.143
 DO THINGS BETTER. I THINK
 THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

03:33:43.401 --> 03:33:46.912
 FOR ALL OF US TO DO AND
 CERTAINLY THE FDA CAN PROMISE 

03:33:46.913 --> 03:33:48.692
TO
 DO THAT. LOOKING FORWARD, SIR,

03:33:48.693 --> 03:33:52.443
 I CAN COMMIT TO YOU THAT WE'RE
 GOING LOOK AT THE REGULAR

03:33:52.694 --> 03:33:56.583
AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE DONE SO IN
 THE OUTBREAK AND PROVIDED

03:33:56.833 --> 03:33:59.514
SIGNIFICANT PLAUSIBILITY AND
 TRIED TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT

03:33:59.774 --> 03:34:03.423
BALANCE OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND
 ENABLING OF THE GREAT TEST

03:34:03.663 --> 03:34:09.663
DEVELOPERS AND THE DEVELOPER IN
 THE COUNTRY WITH THE NEED TO

03:34:10.094 --> 03:34:18.324
 INSURE THE GOLD STANDARD IN
 PLACE. WE HAVE LEARNED A AND WE

03:34:18.654 --> 03:34:21.674
 WILL CONTINUE TO LEARN AND
 IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THAT ARE

03:34:21.924 --> 03:34:23.924
 NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
 CAN

03:34:26.984 --> 03:34:28.984
DO IT IN A MORE WAY

03:34:32.824 --> 03:34:35.544
AND
 TAKING THE PLAYBOOK AND THEN

03:34:35.914 --> 03:34:40.054
 IMPLEMENTED A FORMAL CLEARLY
 DEFINED TREATMENT REVIEW

03:34:40.294 --> 03:34:44.524
PATHWAY, CAN WE DO THAT FOR
 COVID-19 IN A SIMILAR PARALLEL

03:34:44.784 --> 03:34:50.120
 TRACK THAT YOU PUT IN TO PLACE
 BACK THEN IN THE 890s IN FACT, 

03:34:50.121 --> 03:34:53.343
I
 HAVE A BILL CALLED THE 

03:34:53.344 --> 03:34:55.499
PROMISING
 PATHWAYS ACT THAT IS BASED UPON

03:34:56.084 --> 03:34:58.634
 THAT PROTOCOL THAT YOU PUT IN 
TO

03:34:58.954 --> 03:35:05.864
PLACE. CAN WE DO THAT TO MORE
 QUICKLY GET THROUGH TO THE

03:35:06.124 --> 03:35:08.124
THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES HERE
 WITH COVID-19?

03:35:08.604 --> 03:35:11.794
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY,
 BUT SOME SIMILARITIES. IF YOU

03:35:12.044 --> 03:35:16.044
 ARE REFER TO GO THE PARALLEL
 TRACT THAT I PUT IN TO PLACE

03:35:16.284 --> 03:35:20.714
 BACK IN THE LATE 80s, WHICH WAS
 WHEN THERE WAS NO AVAILABILITY

03:35:20.954 --> 03:35:24.574
 OF DRUGS AT ALL FOR HIV AND 
WHEN

03:35:24.954 --> 03:35:29.904
WE WERE TESTING DRUGS WITHIN A
 PROTOCOL THAT WE WOULD MAKE IT

03:35:30.149 --> 03:35:33.414
 AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF THE
 PROTOCOL. WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE

03:35:33.694 --> 03:35:35.694
 COMPASSIONATE USE AND SO WHAT 
WE

03:35:35.869 --> 03:35:40.924
DID WAS THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO
 INTERFERE WITH THE INTEGRITY TO

03:35:41.809 --> 03:35:46.883
 DETERMINE THE CONTROL WAY WHAT
 WAS SAFE AND WHAT WAS 

03:35:46.884 --> 03:35:50.543
AFFECTIVE.
 THERE WAS A NEED OF SOME SORT 

03:35:50.544 --> 03:35:53.817
OF
 ACCESSIBILITY TO THOSE DRUGS

03:35:54.064 --> 03:35:57.224
 OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL
 FOR THOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME

03:35:57.484 --> 03:36:01.403
 CHANCE OF HAVING IT. IN FACT,
 THAT WAS REALLY IN MANY 

03:36:01.404 --> 03:36:03.484
RESPECTS
 GO THE FIRM CONCEPT OF

03:36:03.728 --> 03:36:06.379
COMPASSIONATE YOUTH. IN FACT,
 THERE'S A VERSION OF THAT, THAT

03:36:06.624 --> 03:36:09.864
 I WILL HAND OVER TO THE
 COMMISSIONER THAT IS, YOU KNOW,

03:36:11.185 --> 03:36:14.704
 WHEN YOU HAVE THE EXPANDED
 ACCESS AND THE EMERGENCY USE

03:36:14.999 --> 03:36:16.999
 AUTHORIZATION THAT'S NOT BEEN

03:36:21.964 --> 03:36:23.964
 FULLY PROVEN IN A CLINICAL
 TRIAL.

03:36:34.195 --> 03:36:38.309
IF YOU WANT TO COMMENTED
 ON THAT.

03:36:38.684 --> 03:36:43.024
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE'S A FLEXIBILITY
 AND THE RISK AND PUBLIC

03:36:43.280 --> 03:36:46.425
EMERGENCY. WE HAVE DONE THAT ON
 THE SIDE IN THREE SEPARATE

03:36:46.665 --> 03:36:49.644
OCCASIONS AND CONTINUED TO LOOK
 AT THE REQUESTS AS THEY COME 

03:36:49.645 --> 03:36:50.159
IN.

03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:51.629
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.

03:36:51.630 --> 03:36:54.474
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

03:36:54.475 --> 03:36:56.475
&gt;&gt; THANK

03:36:57.964 --> 03:37:00.175
YOU, SENATOR BRAWN.
 SENATOR ROSEN.

03:37:08.425 --> 03:37:10.974
CHAIRMAN FOR BRINGING THIS
 HEARING. I WANT TO THANK YOU

03:37:11.445 --> 03:37:15.337
 FOR THE LIFETIME OF WORK AND
 STUDY AND PASSION. WE'RE A

03:37:15.875 --> 03:37:19.255
GRATEFUL NATION FOR THE LIFE
 LONG COMMITMENT IN FIGHTING THE

03:37:19.495 --> 03:37:22.855
 DISEASE. NOT JUST IN THE UNITED
 STATES BUT AROUND THE WORLD. IF

03:37:23.115 --> 03:37:26.785
 I TALKED TO THOSE IN NEVADA 
NECH

03:37:27.145 --> 03:37:31.420
ABOUT SAFELY REOPENING THE
 ECONOMY, ONE QUESTION THAT

03:37:31.665 --> 03:37:34.665
FREQUENTLY COMES UP IS WHEN ARE
 WE GOING HAVE A VACCINE LIKE

03:37:34.915 --> 03:37:38.035
 EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT.
 IT'S THE LIFE BLOOD FOR US AND

03:37:38.275 --> 03:37:41.475
 THEN THE JOBS ASSOCIATED AND
 THAT CAN FULLY COME BACK IF WE

03:37:41.745 --> 03:37:47.995
 KNOW THAT IT'S SAFE TO TRAVEL
 AND VISIT AND WORK AND HOTELS

03:37:48.245 --> 03:37:52.474
 AND CASINOS AND THAT TRACTIONS.
 TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, YOU HAVE 

03:37:52.475 --> 03:37:54.475
TO
 HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE VISITORS

03:37:54.765 --> 03:37:57.956
 FEELING SAFE. WE NEED THAT AND
 THAT'S IMPORTANT. HOWEVER,

03:37:58.200 --> 03:38:02.963
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS TAKES
 TIME TO DEVELOP AND INSURE BOTH

03:38:03.205 --> 03:38:09.245
 SAFETY AND ITHACA SI, I WOULD
 LIKE TO HEAR WHAT RESEARCH IS

03:38:09.705 --> 03:38:11.726
 HAPPENING REGARDING THE
 PREVENTIVE MEDICATION RESEARCH

03:38:11.995 --> 03:38:17.685
 THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN THE
 TIME FRAME BEFORE A VACCINE AND

03:38:18.035 --> 03:38:21.985
 ONE THAT'S WIDELY AVAILABLE. I
 WANT TO ASK IF THIS IS PART OF

03:38:22.235 --> 03:38:25.185
 THE PATH AND HELPING US TO
 REOPEN THE ECONOMY SAFELY AND

03:38:25.435 --> 03:38:27.435
 BRING THE VISITORS NOT ONLY 
BACK

03:38:30.425 --> 03:38:32.425
 TO NEVADA BUT ACROSS THE
 COUNTRY.

03:38:41.705 --> 03:38:45.875
COULD THIS BE USED TO
 BLOCK COVID-19 VIRUS FROM

03:38:46.145 --> 03:38:50.545
LAUNCHING ON TO THE HOST CELLS
 MUCH LIKE THE TREATMENTS FOR

03:38:50.815 --> 03:38:54.335
 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND OTHER
 DISEASES AND THING SECONDLY

03:38:54.626 --> 03:38:58.326
WOULD THE PREVENTIVE MEDICATIONS
 OPTIONS LIKE THIS HELP TO

03:38:58.607 --> 03:39:00.607
COMPLIMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

03:39:02.965 --> 03:39:06.064
 A VACCINE ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE?

03:39:06.065 --> 03:39:09.435
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION
 SENATOR ROSEN. THAT'S ACT ALE

03:39:09.675 --> 03:39:16.505
 EXTENT QUESTION. IN ALL OF THE
 THINGS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED,

03:39:16.745 --> 03:39:21.676
 THEY CAN BE DIRECT ANTEVIRALS,
 BUT THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

03:39:21.925 --> 03:39:25.074
NUMBER OF POSSIBLES SINCE
 THERE'S SEVERAL VIRAL TARGETS

03:39:25.655 --> 03:39:31.915
 AND THE REPLICATION CYCLE.
 USING THE PLASMA AS WELL AS THE

03:39:32.395 --> 03:39:36.406
 ANTIBODIES IN A PREVENTIVE MORE
 BILLTY ARE ALL FEASIBLE AND 

03:39:36.407 --> 03:39:38.407
WILL
 BE PURSUED IN PARALLEL WITH THE

03:39:38.445 --> 03:39:42.676
 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE. THE
 MODEL OF USING DRUGS AND OTHER

03:39:42.945 --> 03:39:46.666
 INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE AFFECTED
 FOR THE TREATMENT, IS REALLY A

03:39:47.105 --> 03:39:55.306
 GREAT SUCCESS STORY IN THE STOW
 WITH HIV/AIDS BECAUSE MANY OF

03:39:55.546 --> 03:39:58.726
 THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WERE
 DEVELOPED IF WERE THE FULL

03:39:58.976 --> 03:40:00.976
TREATMENT OF

03:40:02.216 --> 03:40:04.216
THE INFECTED PERSON
 ARE AFFECT IV

03:40:08.827 --> 03:40:12.816
AFFECTIVE AFFECTIVE WITH THE
 HIV. I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE

03:40:13.141 --> 03:40:17.291
APART OF OUR EFFORT AT THE SAME
 TIME AS WE'RE PUTTING A FULL

03:40:17.526 --> 03:40:20.246
 COURT PROCESS ON TRYING TO GET 
A

03:40:20.496 --> 03:40:23.640
VACCINE. IT'S AN EXCELLENT
 QUESTION. IT'S VERY RELEVANT.  

03:40:23.641 --> 03:40:25.676
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT I
 HAVE A THIRD

03:40:25.931 --> 03:40:31.146
TIME LEFT AND I AM GOING TALK
 ABOUT THE IF HE COULD MOST

03:40:31.431 --> 03:40:34.491
IMPORTANT AND THEN THE FIRST
 RESPONDERS AND GENERALLY, WHAT

03:40:34.886 --> 03:40:42.095
 DOES THE MARK GENERATION OF THE
 PPE NEED TO LOOK LARK FOR ALL 

03:40:42.096 --> 03:40:44.096
OF
 US AS WE GO ABOUT OUR LIVES?

03:40:44.316 --> 03:40:47.541
 NOT JUST WORKERS. YOU MAY NEED
 SOMETHING STRONGER AND MORE

03:40:47.786 --> 03:40:52.690
SPECIFIC. FOR THOSE OF US THAT
 WANT TO GO OUT TO EAT AND GET 

03:40:52.691 --> 03:40:54.845
ON
 AN AIRPLANE, SHOULD THAT BE 

03:40:54.846 --> 03:40:57.317
MADE
 OF A CERTAIN MATERIAL OR GLOVES

03:40:57.566 --> 03:41:01.506
 OR WHAT IS AFFECTIVE? CAN YOU
 TALK ABOUT

03:41:06.526 --> 03:41:08.566
PPE FOR THE GENERAL
 PUBLIC?

03:41:08.816 --> 03:41:12.291
&gt;&gt; THE BEST IS TO MAINTAIN THE
 PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL DISTANCING.

03:41:12.526 --> 03:41:16.936
 AS WE HAVE SAID, AND I THINK
 THAT ALL US WOULD AGREE THAT

03:41:17.196 --> 03:41:19.431
 THERE'S CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
 THAT'S BEYOND THE CONTROL WHEN

03:41:19.686 --> 03:41:24.115
 YOU NEED TO DO NECESSARY THINGS
 LIKE GO TO THE DRUGSTORE AND 

03:41:24.116 --> 03:41:26.286
GET
 MEDICATION OR THE GROCERY STORE

03:41:26.671 --> 03:41:32.036
 AND GET THE FOOD. YOU NEED SOME
 SUPPLEMENTATION. THAT'S THE

03:41:32.306 --> 03:41:35.627
REASON WHY SOME TIME AGO THE
 RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE AND I

03:41:35.866 --> 03:41:39.116
 BELIEVE IT WAS DOCTOR REDFIELD
 AT THE CDC THAT FIRST SAID THAT

03:41:39.367 --> 03:41:42.586
 AND GETTING A COVERING. WE
 DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A MASK

03:41:42.996 --> 03:41:45.966
 BECAUSE BACK THEN WE WERE
 CONCERNED THAT WE WOULD BE

03:41:46.231 --> 03:41:50.227
TAKING THE MASKS AWAY FROM THE
 HEALTH CARE PROVIDER S.

03:41:50.486 --> 03:41:53.896
BUT A MASK AND COVERING. FOR
 THE TIME BEING IT SHOULD BE A

03:41:54.151 --> 03:41:57.115
 VERY REGULAR PART OF HOW WE
 PREVENT THE SPREAD OF 

03:41:57.116 --> 03:41:59.116
INFECTION.
 IN FACT, THE MORE AND MORE THAT

03:41:59.346 --> 03:42:03.696
 YOU GO OUTSIDE RIGHT HERE AND
 WHERE I'M SITTING IN WASHINGTON

03:42:03.938 --> 03:42:07.551
 D.C., YOU CAN SEE MANY PEOPLE
 OUT THERE WITH THE MASK ON, AND

03:42:07.822 --> 03:42:11.277
 THAT GIVES ME A DEGREE OF
 COMFORT THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING

03:42:11.566 --> 03:42:13.566
 THIS VERY

03:42:15.897 --> 03:42:16.926
SERIOUSLY.

03:42:16.927 --> 03:42:18.927
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

03:42:25.897 --> 03:42:29.557
 AND YOUR SERVICE. ADMIRAL GIOR,
 BEFORE I START THE QUESTIONS I

03:42:29.827 --> 03:42:33.877
 WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE NEW ROLE
 OF THE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO

03:42:34.167 --> 03:42:38.246
 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.
 MITIGATING THIS WILL TAKE 

03:42:38.247 --> 03:42:41.347
GLOBAL
 COOPERATION. IN ORDER TO DO

03:42:41.593 --> 03:42:45.337
THAT, WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY AND
 TRANSPARENCY AT THE WHO. THIS

03:42:45.977 --> 03:42:47.866
 ORGANIZATION WAS ESTABLISHED 
FOR

03:42:47.867 --> 03:42:53.387
THE TIMELY FLOW OF ACCURATE AND
 UNBIASSED INFORMATION ON THE

03:42:53.627 --> 03:42:56.837
 CLOTHE HEALTH EMERGENCIES JUST
 AS THIS AND THE REFORMS MUST BE

03:42:57.127 --> 03:43:02.102
 MADE IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE
 TRUST THAT WE NEED HERE. I HOPE

03:43:02.492 --> 03:43:07.277
 THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH THE
 ALLIES TO PUSH FOR THEIR

03:43:07.517 --> 03:43:10.187
REFORMS. THIS QUESTION -- I
 HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. THE FIRST

03:43:10.437 --> 03:43:15.532
 ONE IS FOR DR. REDFIELD. WE'RE
 WONDERING HOW WE GOT HER TODAY

03:43:15.777 --> 03:43:19.397
 AND THEN A THIRD OF THE
 WORKFORCE IS OUT OF WORK. I 578

03:43:19.647 --> 03:43:22.917
 CONCERNED ON THE COVER UP AND
 THEN THE INFORMATION ON CHINA

03:43:23.217 --> 03:43:26.107
 AND THEN THE EFFORTS TO 
SUPPRESS

03:43:26.347 --> 03:43:29.737
THE LIFE SAVING EFFORTS AT THE
 OUTSET OF THE OUTBREAK. AS WE

03:43:30.172 --> 03:43:34.816
 CONTINUE TO REOPEN THE COMBI
 SAFETY, WE HAVE TO TAKE STEPS 

03:43:34.817 --> 03:43:36.276
TO
 INSURE THAT ANOTHER OUTBREAK

03:43:36.277 --> 03:43:40.677
 CANNOT TAKE HOLD OF THE WORLD 
IN

03:43:40.917 --> 03:43:45.343
THIS WAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT
 THEY HAVE WORKED ON THE GLOBAL

03:43:45.617 --> 03:43:50.367
 HEALTH FOR DECADES, CAN YOU
 COMMENT ON THE LEVEL AND TIMING

03:43:51.052 --> 03:43:55.021
 OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU
 RECEIVE AND RELIED UPON FROM 

03:43:55.022 --> 03:43:58.437
THE
 CHINESE COUNTERPARTS AS THIS

03:43:58.677 --> 03:44:00.946
 VIRUS EMERGED?

03:44:00.947 --> 03:44:05.687
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT
 TO TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT

03:44:05.927 --> 03:44:08.698
GLOBAL SECURITY IS FOR THE
 NATION. WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

03:44:08.972 --> 03:44:14.087
 BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT AS
 LONG AS WE'RE A NATION. CDC HAS

03:44:14.372 --> 03:44:16.196
 HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
COUNTRIES

03:44:16.197 --> 03:44:20.687
AROUND THE WORLD. WE HAVE
 OFFICES IN OVER 45 COUNTRIES

03:44:21.227 --> 03:44:26.186
 RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THOSE HAPPENS
 TO BE CHINA WHERE WE HAVE A 

03:44:26.187 --> 03:44:28.787
U.S.
 CDC THAT IS WITH THE CHINA CDC,

03:44:29.337 --> 03:44:33.107
 AND WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR
 DECADES

03:44:37.477 --> 03:44:40.557
ON FLU AND INFECTIOUS
 DISEASES.

03:44:48.397 --> 03:44:51.907
. THE ORIGINAL AND THE
 SEAFOOD MARKET IS HERE AND

03:44:52.148 --> 03:44:55.376
THERE'S A DISCUSSION FROM THE
 U.S. PERSONNEL THAT IS THERE 

03:44:55.377 --> 03:44:58.187
FOR
 THE CHI NO CDC AND I PERSONALLY

03:44:58.437 --> 03:45:02.868
 HAD THE DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK
 THAT CDC WAS THERE AND THEN

03:45:03.138 --> 03:45:05.138
MYSELF AND JANUARY 3RD.

04:04:33.625 --> 04:04:34.916
.

04:04:34.917 --> 04:04:37.868
&gt;&gt; AND THE U.S. WITH OVER 81%

04:04:42.602 --> 04:04:44.602
 AND THEN ALSO 81 THOUSAND AND

04:04:56.707 --> 04:04:57.610
,000 AND.

04:04:57.611 --> 04:05:00.388
&gt;&gt; WELL, OVERALL IT'S THE FOUR
 WITNESSES THAT WANTED TO BRING

04:05:00.629 --> 04:05:04.150
 IN THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT OUT
 OF THE WOODS. THAT'S WHAT DR.

04:05:04.406 --> 04:05:06.406
 FAUCI SAID THAT WE NEED

04:05:09.953 --> 04:05:14.758
TO TAKE
 THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. &amp; WE NEED

04:05:15.008 --> 04:05:18.945
 TO LOOK AT THE MODELS AND SAYS
 WE NEED TO SEE THE SCHOOLS NOT

04:05:19.771 --> 04:05:23.788
 SHUT DOWN AND THERE WERE NOT A
 LOT OF THE CASES. THE AMERICAN

04:05:24.148 --> 04:05:29.397
 STUDENTS NEED TO RETURN TO
 SCHOOL BEFORE THEY'RE TOO FAR 

04:05:29.398 --> 04:05:32.408
BY
 HIND. HE SAYS THAT DR. FAUCI

04:05:32.648 --> 04:05:34.972
 SHOULD NOT BE THE END ALL ON 
ALL

04:05:35.216 --> 04:05:38.478
OF THIS. NOW, WHAT IS IMPORTANT
 IS THE RESPONSE TO THAT AND

04:05:38.738 --> 04:05:40.958
ILLUSTRATES HOW HE USUALLY
 APPROACHES THE QUESTIONS LIKE

04:05:41.198 --> 04:05:45.528
 THAT. HE SAY THAT IS HE DOES
 NOT BELIEVE THAT HE IS THE END

04:05:45.791 --> 04:05:49.008
 ALL, BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW
 EVERYTHING. HE IS VERY CAN DID

04:05:49.258 --> 04:05:51.908
 WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE DOES NOT
 KNOW EVERYTHING,

04:06:24.488 --> 04:06:25.117
.

04:06:25.118 --> 04:06:28.193
&gt;&gt; AND PLEASE CONTINUE ABOUT THE
 TONE OF THE HEARING.

04:06:28.443 --> 04:06:31.798
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. HE WANTED TO MAKE
 SURE THAT WE JUST DID NOT

04:06:32.038 --> 04:06:35.918
DISMISS IT AND SAY CHILDREN DO
 NOT HAVE AS HIGH A

04:06:40.893 --> 04:06:42.893
MORTALITY
 RATE AS OLDER INDIVIDUALS.

04:06:47.059 --> 04:06:49.798
AND
 THEN THAT'S JUST FINE. THAT'S

04:06:50.088 --> 04:06:55.742
 NOT EXACTLY BEEN THE CASE SINCE
 WE HAVE SEEN THIS CORONAVIRUS

04:06:56.067 --> 04:07:00.818
 PAY OUT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
 ALL OF THE FACTS JUST YET.

04:07:01.188 --> 04:07:06.078
THINGS ARE STILL DEVELOPING.
 WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE 

04:07:06.079 --> 04:07:08.448
TONE
 OF THE HEARING AND IT WAS NOT 

04:07:08.449 --> 04:07:11.100
AS
 CON TENSOUS AS SOME THAT WE

04:07:11.348 --> 04:07:17.289
MIGHT HAVE SEEN. THEY SAID THAT
 THAT WE SHOULD HAVE APPROACHED

04:07:17.528 --> 04:07:21.408
 THIS IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION,
 AND WE DID NOT SEE MUCH OF 

04:07:21.409 --> 04:07:23.409
THAT.
 THERE'S POLITICS AND YOU DID

04:07:23.648 --> 04:07:25.648
 HAVE SENATOR WARREN AND SHE 
USED

04:07:25.679 --> 04:07:30.028
UP HER TIME TO POINT OUT AND
 CRITICIZE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

04:07:30.029 --> 04:07:32.029
DID
 NOT HANDLE THIS RIGHT IN THE

04:07:32.058 --> 04:07:35.039
 BEGINNING AND THE UP INNER OF
 DEATHS. BERNIE SANDERS SAID

04:07:35.284 --> 04:07:37.284
THAT AS WELL,

04:07:41.383 --> 04:07:43.383
TOO WITH THE
 EARLIER RESPONSE.

04:07:49.789 --> 04:07:54.334
AND IN THE
 HEARING AND THEN AT THE END SHE

04:07:54.579 --> 04:07:56.579
 IS IN A

04:07:59.749 --> 04:08:01.749
TOUGH RACE IN GEORGE AND
 THEN

04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:18.089
-- THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF
 TECHNICAL GLITCHES. THERE ARE

04:08:18.352 --> 04:08:22.179
 NOT A LOT OF ISSUES AND YOU 
HAVE

04:08:22.419 --> 04:08:25.514
TO WONDER IF THIS IS WHAT WE'RE
 GOING SEE FROM NOW ON

04:08:29.909 --> 04:08:31.909
BECAUSE OF
 THE CONGRESS DEPRESSION AL

04:09:08.379 --> 04:09:10.891
DEPRESSIONAL HE
 ENDED BY SAYING THAT SOON IS 

04:09:10.892 --> 04:09:16.364
NOT
 HELPFUL AND HE DID NOT GET THE

04:09:16.779 --> 04:09:20.599
 ANSWERS ON WHAT ARE THE
 COMPLICATIONS HERE FOR DR.

04:09:20.849 --> 04:09:21.803
REDFIELD.

04:09:21.804 --> 04:09:24.089
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THE COMPLICATIONS ARE
 SIGNIFICANT. THEY'RE SQUEEZED

04:09:24.350 --> 04:09:30.319
 INSIDE OF THE TASK FORCE AND
 THEN THERE WAS A MEETING A WEEK

04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:35.060
 AGO ON WEDNESDAY, SO A WEEK AGO
 TOMORROW WHERE DEBORAH AND THE

04:09:35.320 --> 04:09:37.320
 DOCTOR THAT LEADS THE TASK 
FORCE

04:09:37.350 --> 04:09:40.319
BASICALLY UPGRADED HIM IN THE
 ROOM AND THE REPORTING AND

04:09:40.559 --> 04:09:43.427
COMPLAINED ABOUT A LOT OF
 PROBLEMS IN THE CDC AND DELAYS

04:09:43.669 --> 04:09:47.670
 AND THE LACK OF THE RELIABLE
 DATA AND HE IS SORT OF IN MANY

04:09:47.915 --> 04:09:50.783
 WAYS THE CDC HAS NOT HAD HIS 
OWN

04:09:51.055 --> 04:09:54.179
STAND ALONE BRIEFING IN SOME
 TIME, AND SO THE CHALLENGE FOR

04:09:54.709 --> 04:09:57.710
 HIM IS THAT HE, YOU KNOW, WANTS
 TO

04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:04.579
MAKE SURE THAT HE CONTINUE IS 
CONTINUES I

04:10:04.840 --> 04:10:08.779
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
 ADMINISTRATION AND THEN THE

04:10:09.089 --> 04:10:13.810
ESCAPE GILT IN THE CDC IN SOME
 WAYS. I THINK THAT IT'S THE

04:10:14.204 --> 04:10:18.839
DEEPER PROBLEMS IN THE PUBLIC
 HEALTH THAT WE TOOK FOR 

04:10:18.840 --> 04:10:20.908
GRANTED.
 WE SORT OF ASSUME AND THAT'S 

04:10:20.909 --> 04:10:22.909
THE
 PREMIER AND THEN THAT IS A KIND

04:10:23.140 --> 04:10:25.520
 OF A THING AND WE HAVE SEEN 
THAT

04:10:25.766 --> 04:10:28.560
THERE'S BEEN SOME THINGS OVER
 TIME WITH THE BUDGET CUTS AND

04:10:28.810 --> 04:10:33.765
 SOME SORT OF THINGS. HE IS
 TRYING TO PRESERVE THE REP

04:10:34.020 --> 04:10:35.279
TUITION OF THE AGENCY.

04:10:35.280 --> 04:10:38.530
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO RHONDA ON
 THE CAPITOL HILL. WE SAW THEM

04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:42.890
 COMING IN AND WEARING MASKS.
 THEY TOOK THEM OFF AS THE

04:10:43.150 --> 04:10:46.545
HEARING WAS GOING ON AND THERE
 ARE OTHERS THAT DID NOT GO AND

04:10:46.800 --> 04:10:49.520
 THEN HE HAS HAD THE 
CORONAVIRUS,

04:10:49.780 --> 04:10:52.570
AND THEY WERE CONCERNS ON
 WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD SPREAD

04:10:52.835 --> 04:10:54.835
 IT

04:10:57.530 --> 04:10:59.530
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.

04:11:26.410 --> 04:11:29.380
&amp; I
 CAN TELL YOU THIS MORNING AND I

04:11:29.815 --> 04:11:32.320
 HAVE SEEN MOST THAT COME HERE 
TO

04:11:32.573 --> 04:11:37.095
DO THE REMOTE HITS WITH THE
 NETWORKS AND THEN THEY'RE

04:11:37.345 --> 04:11:41.615
WEARING MASKS AND THEN WE'RE
 WEARING THEM AS THEY WALK AND

04:11:41.900 --> 04:11:43.900
 THERE ARE A LOT

04:11:47.530 --> 04:11:49.530
OF PEOPLE AND
 GLOVES, TOO.

04:11:57.232 --> 04:12:01.030
&amp; THEN IN THE IN
 THE LAST BILL WHEN PEOPLE GAVE

04:12:01.520 --> 04:12:03.520
 THE SPEECHES AND SOME WEARING

04:12:08.151 --> 04:12:12.207
 THE MASKS AND OTHERS WERE NOT
 AND THEN THE COLLEAGUES

04:12:16.122 --> 04:12:19.271
AND THEN
 THE MASKS AND THEN AND IT'S

04:12:24.206 --> 04:12:26.881
SORT
 OF AN INTERESTING THOUGHT AND.

04:12:28.801 --> 04:12:30.851
 THE DATES AND THEN PREMATURE 
AND

04:12:31.211 --> 04:12:35.021
THEN THERE'S A RISK THAT YOU
 TRIGGERED THE OUTBREAK AND THEN

04:12:35.341 --> 04:12:41.121
 THE CONTROL AND THEN THAT'S
 GOING TO LEAD TO THE SUFFERING

04:12:41.370 --> 04:12:44.934
 AND DEATH THAT COULD BE AVOIDED
 AND JAMES DID YOU GET THE

04:12:45.186 --> 04:12:47.544
MESSAGE AND DID THEY GET THAT?

04:12:47.545 --> 04:12:51.711
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY DID. AND YOU
 KNOW, IN SAYING THAT THIS IS

04:12:51.956 --> 04:12:57.416
 PROBABLY THE PRIMARILY IN
 NORTHEAST PROBLEM. I THINK THAT

04:12:57.781 --> 04:13:01.951
 HE CONVEYED DR. FAUCI VERY
 SPECIFICALLY MADE THE ECONOMIC

04:13:02.221 --> 04:13:06.430
 ARGUMENT, AND THAT'S IF WE JEEP
 TOO SOON, IT'S GOING TO HURT 

04:13:06.431 --> 04:13:08.431
THE
 ECONOMY MORE IN THE LONG TERM.

04:13:08.436 --> 04:13:12.912
 I THINK THAT KIND OF THE KEY
 THAT DR. FAUCI HAS BEEN IN THE

04:13:13.261 --> 04:13:16.991
 SENIOR LEVELS IN THE GOVERNMENT
 SINCE THE MID-1980s. HE KNOWS

04:13:17.231 --> 04:13:23.891
 AND UNDERSTAND SORT OF HOW THIS
 IS GOING TO GO AND PLAY. AT ONE

04:13:24.251 --> 04:13:31.880
 POINT HE IS TEED UP GAIN AND
 THEN MAKING THAT CRISPER FOR 

04:13:31.881 --> 04:13:34.030
THE
 CAMERAS AND THEN THE WHOLE DAY 

04:13:34.031 --> 04:13:36.010
I
 THINK HIS THEME WAS A REALITY

04:13:36.011 --> 04:13:39.076
 CHECK. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT
 WAS MOST INTERESTING WITH THE

04:13:39.311 --> 04:13:41.311
 REALITY CHECK FROM DR. FAUCI 
WAS

04:13:41.371 --> 04:13:44.740
ON THE VACCINE. HE DID, YOU
 KNOW, HE HAD A VERY NEW 

04:13:44.741 --> 04:13:46.766
MESSAGE.
 HE SAYS THAT HE IS HOPEFUL THAT

04:13:47.011 --> 04:13:50.624
 THERE'S SIGN THAT IS A VACCINE
 CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR THE NOVEL

04:13:50.891 --> 04:13:53.691
 CORONAVIRUS. WE HAVE NEVER
 DEVELOPED A NOVEL VACCINE FOR

04:13:53.941 --> 04:13:56.991
 THE CORONAVIRUS LIKE THIS. HE
 SAYS THERE'S ALSO A RISK AND

04:13:57.241 --> 04:14:00.192
 THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THE FIRST
 VACCINES THAT WE DEVELOP AND

04:14:00.456 --> 04:14:05.251
 THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE EX
 PER MEANTLE PHASE IS IMPORTANT,

04:14:05.511 --> 04:14:08.838
 IS THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE
 CONSEQUENCES THAT IN SOME 

04:14:08.839 --> 04:14:11.126
PEOPLE
 THE VACCINE HAS BEEN TESTED, IT

04:14:11.441 --> 04:14:13.801
 CAN MAKE THE CORR OR MUST

04:14:17.841 --> 04:14:19.881
HAVE
 WORSE AND THEN DEADLIER.

04:14:28.171 --> 04:14:30.530
AND
 THIS IS WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE 

04:14:30.531 --> 04:14:32.531
CARE
 ABOUT AND MATTERS HUGELY AND

04:14:32.696 --> 04:14:34.989
 THEN I DO THINK THAT THE REST 
OF

04:14:35.241 --> 04:14:38.011
THE SENATORS AND THIS IS NOT
 COMING AROUND THE CORNER. YOU

04:14:38.511 --> 04:14:46.631
 HAVE TO GET USED TO AND THEN AT
 ONE POINT WHEN LAMAR WAS ASKING

04:14:47.011 --> 04:14:50.332
 ABOUT AND THEN THE ADMIRAL SAYS
 THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO

04:14:50.581 --> 04:14:53.571
 TEST THE WATER COMING OUT OF 
THE

04:14:53.842 --> 04:14:57.952
SEWAGE PIPES AND THEN ONE OF THE
 DORMS TO SEE IF THERE'S A

04:14:58.247 --> 04:15:02.762
CORONAVIRUS IN THE PIPES. I
 THINK THAT IT WAS SORT OF AN

04:15:03.322 --> 04:15:07.560
 ILLUSTRATION ON HOW IT'S 23409
 GOING GO BACK TO NORMAL ANY 

04:15:07.561 --> 04:15:09.531
TIME
 SOON. THIS IS THE THING THAT

04:15:09.532 --> 04:15:12.951
 THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE
 FALL. I DO THINK THAT THE

04:15:13.201 --> 04:15:15.791
REALITY CHECK AS INTENDED WAS
 DELIVERED BOTH TO THE SENATORS

04:15:16.031 --> 04:15:18.744
 IN THE ROOM AND TO THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE WATCHING.

04:15:18.991 --> 04:15:22.433
&gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE VACCINE
 WHEN DR. FAUCI WAS PRESSED A

04:15:22.671 --> 04:15:24.671
 COUPLE OF TIMES ON THE 
QUESTION.

04:15:24.747 --> 04:15:27.972
HE SAYS IT'S NOT A LONG SHOT.
 IT WAS SOME WHAT REASSURING AND

04:15:28.212 --> 04:15:31.572
 A LITTLE FRIGHTENING. WHAT YOU
 WANT TO HEAR IS THAT IT'S GOING

04:15:31.822 --> 04:15:33.833
 TO HAPPEN IN A TIMELINE IN 
WHICH

04:15:34.072 --> 04:15:37.012
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. HE GAVE
 THE EXPLANATION ON WHY IT'S NOT

04:15:37.252 --> 04:15:40.962
 A LONG SHOT AND BECAUSE THERE
 ARE CASES OF PEOPLE ABLE TO

04:15:41.237 --> 04:15:45.122
RECOVER TO HAVE BODIES AS HE PUT
 IT CLEARING THE VIRUS, HE DOES

04:15:45.392 --> 04:15:50.167
 BELIEVE THEY CAN WORK TOWARDS
 FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THE

04:15:50.532 --> 04:15:54.895
IMMUNITY FROM THE CORONAVIRUS
 AND THEN LEADING TO THE

04:15:55.152 --> 04:15:57.622
IMMUNITY. JAMES, IF YOU ARE
 SOMEONE ASKING THE QUESTIONS ON

04:15:57.862 --> 04:16:01.071
 THE VACCINE, DID YOU WALK AWAY
 FROM THE HEARING MORE ASSURED 

04:16:01.072 --> 04:16:02.941
OR
 MORE CONCERN ABOUT JUST HOW 

04:16:02.942 --> 04:16:04.942
LONG
 IT CAN TAKE TO DEVELOP THE

04:16:05.152 --> 04:16:05.647
VACCINE?

04:16:05.648 --> 04:16:08.961
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT WE ALL CREATED
 WAS THE HONESTLY. I THINK THAT

04:16:09.199 --> 04:16:13.672
 HE GAVE AN ANSWER THAT CONVEYED
 BUT WE'RE SO USED WHEN AND

04:16:13.902 --> 04:16:17.352
THAT'S SO OVER THE TOP AND THEN
 BLAYNELY AT ODDS WITH THE FACTS

04:16:17.612 --> 04:16:21.082
 ON THE GROUND AND THAT THEY DO
 NOT HAVE A LOT OF CREDIBILITY.

04:16:21.327 --> 04:16:23.327
 I THINK THAT THERE'S

04:16:26.542 --> 04:16:28.542
A GREAT
 DEAL OF CREDIBILITY.

04:16:50.307 --> 04:16:52.892
AND THEN
 ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS THAT WE

04:16:53.130 --> 04:16:55.127
 MADE DURING THE HEARING WAS 
THAT

04:16:55.128 --> 04:17:00.081
THEN YOU HAVE TO START TO THINK
 ABOUT THE DELIVERY MECHANISM 

04:17:00.082 --> 04:17:02.202
FOR
 THE VACCINES AND THAT IT'S NOT

04:17:02.487 --> 04:17:06.722
 EVEN IF YOU COME UP WITH WHAT
 WORKS, YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT

04:17:06.982 --> 04:17:10.712
MAKES ENOUGH DOSES TO BE ABLE TO
 CREATE THE IMMUNITY AND TO BE

04:17:11.692 --> 04:17:15.749
 ABLE TO GET THOSE DOSES TO THE
 DEVELOPING WORLD THAT MAY NOT 

04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:17.755
BE
 ABLE TO AFFORD THEM AND THE

04:17:18.007 --> 04:17:21.862
LIGHT. I THINK THAT IT'S
 REFRESHING TO HEAR SOMEONE BE

04:17:22.138 --> 04:17:27.348
 REALISTIC ON THE POSSIBILITIES,
 AND I DO THINK THAT HE IS BEING

04:17:27.695 --> 04:17:31.972
 HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC AND THE
 CHALLENGES.

04:17:32.342 --> 04:17:39.422
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO THEM ON THE
 QUESTION OF VACCINES. AND THEN

04:17:39.932 --> 04:17:43.488
 COMMIT TO THE FREE VACCINES.
 THEY SORT OF KICKED

04:17:46.987 --> 04:17:48.822
THE CAN BACK
 TO HIM.

04:17:48.823 --> 04:17:52.363
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SPENT A
 LOT OF THE QUESTIONING TIME

04:17:52.753 --> 04:17:58.098
ABOUT IS THE VACCINES, BERNIE
 SANDERS AND ASKING WILL ALL

04:17:58.352 --> 04:18:02.413
PEOPLE DESPITE THE INCOME OR
 WHERE THEY ARE, WILL THEY BE

04:18:07.423 --> 04:18:09.423
 ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE.

04:18:13.523 --> 04:18:17.281
GRCHLT
 FAUCI DID SAY THAT THEY HAVE 

04:18:17.282 --> 04:18:20.333
NOT
 WORKED AS FAST IN HIS KNOWLEDGE

04:18:20.663 --> 04:18:23.923
 AS FAST ON THE VACCINE COMPARED
 TO OTHER TIMES. IT DOES APPEAR

04:18:24.167 --> 04:18:27.152
 THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S MORE
 PROGRESS THAN THE LAST TIME 

04:18:27.153 --> 04:18:29.153
THAT
 THE WITNESSES WERE ON THE HILL.

04:18:29.283 --> 04:18:32.108
 IT'S MUCH A QUESTION. YOU HAVE
 EVEN HAD SENATORS

04:18:37.123 --> 04:18:41.949
START TO PUT
 OUT THE LEGISLATION --

04:18:42.293 --> 04:18:46.093
&gt;&gt; CONTACT TRACING AND THE D.C.
 AND THEN YESTERDAY THAT THEY

04:18:46.338 --> 04:18:49.994
 HIRED THE FIRST 17 CONTACT
 TRACERS THAT THEY WANT TO HIRE

04:18:50.238 --> 04:18:52.238
 700 OF THEM. THE CDC PLAN THAT

04:18:57.048 --> 04:18:59.048
 HAS NOT BEEN RELEAS DE

04:19:07.493 --> 04:19:10.143
LEASED AND THAT'S
 LESS THAN WHAT THEY THINK IS

04:19:10.578 --> 04:19:14.387
 REALISTIC. THAT'S WHY THE TECH
 COMPANIES THAT ARE COMPETITORS

04:19:15.123 --> 04:19:17.893
 LIKE APPLE AND SAMSUNG AND
 GOGGLE ROW WORKING TOGETHER TO

04:19:18.273 --> 04:19:22.143
 TRY TO DEVELOP AN APP THAT WE
 CAN INSTALL ON THE PHONES AND

04:19:22.393 --> 04:19:25.333
 AUSTRALIA HAS SOMETHING LIKE
 THIS AND THEN A BUNCH OF

04:19:25.573 --> 04:19:27.532
COUNTRIES HAVE ROLLED OUT THE
 APP.

04:19:27.533 --> 04:19:30.986
IT'S BASICALLY A CONTRACT
 TRACING APP SO THAT IF, YOU

04:19:31.253 --> 04:19:34.273
KNOW, YOU TEST POSITIVE THAT YOU
 CAN IDENTIFY THAT AND THEN IT

04:19:34.523 --> 04:19:36.873
 TELLS ANYONE THAT'S REALLY 
CLOSE

04:19:37.123 --> 04:19:41.422
TO, YOU KNOW, LESS THAN FIVE
 FEET FROM YOU FOR MORE THAN 

04:19:41.423 --> 04:19:43.423
FIVE
 MINUTES IT TELLS THEM THAT THEY

04:19:43.428 --> 04:19:46.713
 WERE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH
 SOMEONE THAT WAS IN THE

04:19:47.040 --> 04:19:51.588
POSITION. THE TECH COMPANIES
 ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP THAT APP

04:19:51.973 --> 04:19:56.237
 FOR CIVIL LIBERTY REGIONS. THE
 GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE 

04:19:56.238 --> 04:19:58.232
DECISION
 TO HAVE THE TECH COMPANIES DO

04:19:58.233 --> 04:20:06.198
 THAT AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT DO
 THAT FOR IT TO WORK, YOU WILL

04:20:06.573 --> 04:20:09.893
 NEED TENS OF MILLIONS OF
 AMERICANS TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.

04:20:10.139 --> 04:20:14.395
 THE NAME IS THAT YOU DO GIVE UP
 THE DEGREE AS PART OF THAT.

04:20:14.658 --> 04:20:17.864
THAT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A KEY
 ELEMENT OF THE CONTRACT TRACING

04:20:18.104 --> 04:20:20.334
 FOR THE COUNTRY AND 30 MILLION
 PEOPLE.

04:20:20.579 --> 04:20:24.249
