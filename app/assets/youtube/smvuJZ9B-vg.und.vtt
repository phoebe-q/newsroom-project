00:31:45.229 --> 00:31:47.813
CLOSING ARGUMENTS, BOTH SIDES 
ARE LOADED TWO HOURS AND HE SAID

00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:50.816
SENATORS GAVE HIM A WORD THEY 
WANTED THINGS TO BE CONCISE. HE 

00:31:51.055 --> 00:31:53.055
ONLY LOOKS TO USE ABOUT HALF OF 

00:31:57.121 --> 00:31:59.463
HIS TIME. AS FAR AS WITNESSES 
ARE CONCERNED HE TOLD REPORTERS 

00:31:59.689 --> 00:32:01.750
YESTERDAY THAT HE WOULD BE 
CALLING WITNESSES IF THAT IS 

00:32:01.993 --> 00:32:03.993
DETERMINED BY THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TODAY AND 

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.563
THEY WILL BE TAKING THAT UP AND 
DECIDING WHEN IT GETS STARTED ON

00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:09.791
THE SENATE FLOOR 

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.985
AS WELL. AS FAR AS WHAT WE ARE 
LISTENING FOR IN THOSE CLOSING 

00:32:15.217 --> 00:32:17.217
ARGUMENTS, YESTERDAY REPUBLICAN 

00:32:20.184 --> 00:32:22.042
SENATORS POSED A QUESTION TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS 

00:32:22.043 --> 00:32:24.043
ASKING THEM THE DEFINING 
QUESTIONS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:26.251
KNEW AND WHEN DID HE 

00:32:29.477 --> 00:32:31.760
KNOW IT. TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS WERE 
NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THAT 

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.990
DEFINITIVELY AND THEY BLAMED THE
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS FOR 

00:32:34.215 --> 00:32:38.195
NOT DOING ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM 
THAT ANSWER DESPITE THE FACT 

00:32:38.425 --> 00:32:40.680
THEY ARE REPRESENTING THE 
PRESIDENT AS THEIR CLIENT AND 

00:32:40.904 --> 00:32:42.960
REPRESENTING HIM AND SHOULD KNOW
THAT ANSWER FROM A 

00:32:47.891 --> 00:32:51.253
FIRST-HAND SOURCE. ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE WILL LISTEN FOR TODAY 

00:32:51.482 --> 00:32:54.249
IS TO SEE IF THEY CAN GIVE ANY 
SUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS TO THAT IN

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.874
DEFENSE OF TRUMP, AS WELL AS THE
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE KNEW 

00:32:58.124 --> 00:33:00.818
ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 
AND HIS SAFETY, AND ONCE HE DID 

00:33:01.043 --> 00:33:04.630
AND WHAT HE DID FINDING OUT 
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE.

00:33:04.631 --> 00:33:06.631
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING IN 

00:33:10.249 --> 00:33:14.105
RHONDA COVEN INTO THIS 
CONVERSATION LIVE ON CAPITOL 

00:33:14.341 --> 00:33:16.408
HILL, THE BIG QUESTION IS DID 
SENATORS GET THEIR QUESTIONS 

00:33:16.635 --> 00:33:18.747
ANSWERED YESTERDAY DURING THE 
Q&amp;amp;A. DID THEY HEAR ANYTHING FROM

00:33:18.972 --> 00:33:21.162
TRUMP'S LAWYERS THAT GAVE THEM 
BELIEF HE SHOULD 

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.865
BE ACQUITTED, OR GAVE THE 
REPUBLICANS DEEPER QUESTIONS AND

00:33:29.089 --> 00:33:31.855
CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR
CONVICTION. WHAT DO WE KNOW 

00:33:32.086 --> 00:33:34.086
ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS ARE 

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.647
WEIGHING THIS?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: WE HAVE NOT SEEN A 

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:40.802
LOT OF REACTION FROM EITHER SIDE
SINCE LAST NIGHT WHEN THE Q&amp;amp;A 

00:33:41.643 --> 00:33:45.228
PORTION ENDED SO WE ARE NOT SURE
WHAT THE THINKING IS. WE CAN SAY

00:33:45.452 --> 00:33:50.325
FROM THE Q&amp;amp;A THAT ONE OF THE 
MAIN ISSUES FOR SOME OF THE 

00:33:50.556 --> 00:33:53.062
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TRUMP KNEW 

00:33:53.296 --> 00:33:58.838
AND WHEN HE KNEW IT, THAT SEEMS 
TO BE THERE FOCUSED WHICH IS THE

00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:01.379
TIMELINE OF WHEN HE KNEW VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS IN 

00:34:01.605 --> 00:34:03.605
DANGER, HE SAID THE 

00:34:05.966 --> 00:34:08.198
DISPARAGING TWEET, WHY DID HE 
NOT CALL IT OFF MORE 

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:11.177
EMPHATICALLY AND WHY DID HE NOT 
SEND ANY HELP? ACCORDING TO THE 

00:34:11.406 --> 00:34:14.448
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS THEY FOUND 
NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HELPED BRING

00:34:14.677 --> 00:34:16.677
THE NATIONAL GUARD AND HE WAS 
NOT PART OF 

00:34:20.683 --> 00:34:22.279
THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS APPEAL IS 

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.029
HE DID NOT ACT WHEN HE WAS 
SUPPOSED TO ACT AND HE ABANDONED

00:34:25.254 --> 00:34:29.924
HIS VICE PRESIDENT. THAT SEEMS 
TO BE ONE OF THE STICKING POINTS

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.150
FOR THESE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
WHO WE ARE CLOSELY WATCHING 

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.654
TODAY AS OF THE VOTE IS TAKEN, 
IT IS BILL CASSIDY OF 

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.799
LOUISIANA AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF 
ALASKA, THEY ASKED THE QUESTIONS

00:34:44.033 --> 00:34:46.559
ABOUT TRUMP'S ACTIVITY AS A 
RIGHTS WERE GOING ON AT THE TOP 

00:34:46.787 --> 00:34:49.474
OF TODAY WE WILL SEE THE SENATE 
VOTE ON WHETHER THEY SHOULD 

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.947
SUBPOENA WITNESSES FOR THIS 
TRIAL. WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS 

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.712
LIKELY AND IT IS SOMETHING WE 
WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. THERE

00:34:56.951 --> 00:34:58.954
IS INDICATION AT LEAST WITH ONE 
SENATOR, DEMOCRAT 

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.133
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, WHO TWEETED 
LAST NIGHT HE IS THINKING 

00:35:04.222 --> 00:35:06.222
WITNESSES MAY BE NEED TO CALL TO
FLESH OUT 

00:35:10.518 --> 00:35:12.518
THE SITUATION ON THE 
CONVERSATION WITH TRUMP AND TRY 

00:35:12.709 --> 00:35:16.175
TO ESTABLISH IF PRESIDENT TRUMP 
KNEW IF VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 

00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:18.416
PENCE WAS 

00:35:21.482 --> 00:35:23.679
IN DANGER.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO DIVE BACK AT THE 

00:35:23.906 --> 00:35:26.443
Q&amp;amp;A YESTERDAY THAT GOT TO THE 
HEART OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE 

00:35:26.669 --> 00:35:28.504
BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THE 
QUESTIONS THE SENATORS HAVE, 

00:35:28.505 --> 00:35:30.505
HERE IS THE QUESTION POSED BY 

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:37.091
SUSAN COLLINS AND LISA MURKOWSKI
AND THE QUESTION WAS WHEN DID 

00:35:37.326 --> 00:35:39.632
DONALD TRUMP KNOW ABOUT THE 
BREACH OF THE CAPITAL AND WHAT 

00:35:39.863 --> 00:35:42.886
DID HE DO IN THE IMMEDIATE 
AFTERMATH? LET'S LISTEN. 

00:35:42.887 --> 00:35:45.985
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE ABLE TO PIECE TOGETHER
A TIMELINE AND IT GOES ALL THE 

00:35:46.297 --> 00:35:52.343
WAY BACK TO THE DECEMBER 31 AND 
JANUARY 2 TIME FRAME, A LOT OF 

00:35:53.444 --> 00:35:58.865
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE 
AUTHORITIES AND GETTING FOLKS TO

00:35:59.098 --> 00:36:04.305
HAVE SECURITY BEFORE HAND, ON 
THE DAY WE HAVE 

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:14.504
TWEET AT 2:38 SO IT WAS SOMETIME
BEFORE THEN WITH THE RUSH TO 

00:36:14.736 --> 00:36:17.176
BRING THIS IMPEACHMENT THERE HAS
BEEN NO INVESTIGATION INTO THAT.

00:36:17.177 --> 00:36:20.797
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES HELLMAN, THE WAY THIS 
ATTORNEY TALKED YOU WOULD THINK 

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.175
THERE WAS SOME SORT OF FIREWALL 
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS CLIENT. HE 

00:36:24.398 --> 00:36:28.356
IS REPRESENTING DONALD TRUMP AND
THE QUESTION THE TWO SENATORS 

00:36:30.244 --> 00:36:32.876
WERE ASKING WAS WHEN DID HE 
LEARN ABOUT THE BREACH AND WHAT 

00:36:33.106 --> 00:36:37.108
SPECIFIC ACTIONS DID HE TAKE IT 
AND IT AND WHEN? THEY SAID BE AS

00:36:37.336 --> 00:36:40.676
DETAILED AS POSSIBLE AND INSTEAD
WE HEARD THE LAWYERS OFF YOU 

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:44.283
SKATING WITH OLD DATES AND A 
TIMELINE. BUT ULTIMATELY DID WE 

00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:46.511
LEARN 

00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:50.204
ANYTHING NEW?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE STONEWALLING IS A 

00:36:50.205 --> 00:36:53.549
REFLECTION OF THE TRUMP LAWYERS 
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE THE 

00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:56.209
VOTES THEY NEED AND DO NOT NEED 
TO PERSUADE SENATOR MURKOWSKI 

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.805
OR COLLINS. WE DID NOT LEARN 
ANYTHING NEW FROM THE 

00:37:04.029 --> 00:37:06.029
PRESENTATION BY THE TRUMP 
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS OTHER THAN A 

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.057
FLAT DENIAL THAT TRUMP EVER 

00:37:10.026 --> 00:37:12.335
KNEW IT VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE WAS IN GRAVE DANGER WHICH 

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.154
IS NOT TRUE. OUR REPORTING SAYS 
OTHERWISE AND THE SENATOR FROM 

00:37:17.382 --> 00:37:21.671
ALABAMA REITERATED LAST NIGHT 
THAT HE IN FACT SPOKE TO THE 

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.501
PRESIDENT BY PHONE AND TOLD HIM 
MIKE PENCE HAD BEEN EVACUATED. 

00:37:24.738 --> 00:37:26.738
IT 

00:37:28.414 --> 00:37:30.250
WOULD BE IN FITTING WITH 
STANDARD SECRET SERVICE 

00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:34.175
OPERATING PROCEDURE TO ALERT THE
PRESIDENT IF THE FIRST, SECOND 

00:37:34.406 --> 00:37:37.050
AND THIRD PEOPLE IN LINE FOR 
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION WERE ALL

00:37:37.276 --> 00:37:41.583
BEING EVACUATED SO IT DOES NOT 
PASS THE SMELL TEST THAT HE WAS 

00:37:41.827 --> 00:37:44.567
NEVER TOLD HIS VICE PRESIDENT 
WAS IN DANGER, AND UNDERCUTS THE

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.003
CREDIBILITY OF THE REST OF THEIR
ARGUMENT. BUT ALSO THERE WAS NO 

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.625
REAL EFFORT TO SHOW THE 
PRESIDENT CARED. IT IS NOT JUST 

00:37:52.858 --> 00:37:56.421
THE QUESTION OF WHAT TRUMP KNEW 
BUT ALSO WHETHER HE CARED. AND 

00:37:56.658 --> 00:37:59.615
IN THE TWEET WE JUST SAW 
MENTIONED BY THE TRUMP DEFENSE 

00:38:00.283 --> 00:38:02.283
ATTORNEY, THE 2:38 2:30 8 

00:38:06.008 --> 00:38:09.912
PM TWEET, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
CONTINUING TO CRITICIZE MIKE 

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.958
PENCE THING HE DID NOT DO THE 
RIGHT THING HE DID NOT HAVE 

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:16.192
BACKBONE AFTER HE APPARENTLY 
KNEW THE CAPITAL HAD BEEN 

00:38:16.265 --> 00:38:18.457
BREACHED AND THE VICE PRESIDENT 
HAVE BEEN EVACUATED. THE LAWYER 

00:38:18.687 --> 00:38:23.504
AT ONE POINT SET OF COURSE TRUMP
CARED ABOUT MIKE PENCE, THEY 

00:38:23.729 --> 00:38:26.533
HAVE A LONG-STANDING CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP. BUT THAT IS BELIED

00:38:26.886 --> 00:38:29.275
BY THE FACT THE CROWD WAS 
CHANTING HANG 

00:38:33.128 --> 00:38:35.870
LIKE PENCE WHICH WAS PLAYING ON 
CABLE NEWS AND WE KNOW FROM OUR 

00:38:36.098 --> 00:38:38.313
OWN REPORTING OF THE WASHINGTON 
POST THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

00:38:39.843 --> 00:38:41.925
WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT ON 
TELEVISION AND RELISHING IT AND 

00:38:42.158 --> 00:38:44.164
RESISTANT TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP
IT.

00:38:44.165 --> 00:38:48.291
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IT
GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT SOME 

00:38:48.515 --> 00:38:50.515
OF THESE REPUBLICANS HAVE 

00:38:53.123 --> 00:38:55.203
ALSO TROUBLING. IF WE HEAR 
REPUBLICAN SAY I'M VOTING TO 

00:38:55.428 --> 00:38:58.752
CONVICT IT MAY BE QUITE CLOSELY 
TIED INTO THIS MOMENT AND IF 

00:38:58.982 --> 00:39:02.354
THEY SAY THEY WILL ACQUIT, THEY 
WILL USE OTHER REASONS. WE WILL 

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:05.251
CERTAINLY BE ASKING THEM IF THEY
HAVE THIS ANSWER SET ASIDE 

00:39:08.464 --> 00:39:12.391
FOR THEM.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT IS 

00:39:12.618 --> 00:39:17.082
ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE ROOM NEW 
FIRSTHAND THAT TRUMPS DEFENSE 

00:39:17.308 --> 00:39:21.966
ATTORNEY WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY 
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. ABOUT 

00:39:22.192 --> 00:39:24.517
WHAT THE PRESIDENT KNEW BECAUSE 
MANY OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE

00:39:24.761 --> 00:39:26.918
STILL GOING TO VOTE TO ACQUIT, 
INCLUDING 

00:39:31.752 --> 00:39:34.230
SENATOR TURBERVILLE, WERE THERE 
THAT DAY AND TRYING TO REACH THE

00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:36.755
WHITE HOUSE AND CALLING THEIR 
CONTACTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:39.275
THEY WERE PLEADING FOR THE 
NATIONAL GUARD TO DEPLOY AND FOR

00:39:39.497 --> 00:39:42.057
SWAT TEAMS TO ARRIVE. THERE WAS 
FRESH REPORTING LAST 

00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:47.601
NIGHT ABOUT HOUSE MINORITY 
LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY CALLING 

00:39:49.676 --> 00:39:51.968
YOU TRUMP AND GETTING THROUGH 
THEM ON THE PHONE, AND ACCORDING

00:39:52.202 --> 00:39:54.642
TO THIS REPORT, SOME SORT OF 
PROFANE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 

00:39:54.874 --> 00:39:57.372
McCARTHY AND TRUMP WHERE 
McCARTHY WAS YELLING 

00:40:00.906 --> 00:40:04.052
AT TRUMP TO SEND HELP AND TRUMP 
WAS A WELL KEVIN, I GUESS YOU 

00:40:04.278 --> 00:40:06.362
SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT HARDER TO 
OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE 

00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:10.441
ELECTION WHICH APPARENTLY SET 
McCARTHY OFF. IT IS REMARKABLE 

00:40:10.673 --> 00:40:15.124
THERE ARE ALL OF THESE 
REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW WHAT REALLY

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:17.421
HAPPENED AND THEY ARE WILLING TO
TALK TO JOURNALISTS ON 

00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:20.172
BACKGROUND ABOUT IT, BUT ARE NOT
WILLING TO SAY SO PUBLICLY EVEN 

00:40:20.406 --> 00:40:24.702
THOUGH UNDER OATH ON THE FLOOR 
OF THE SENATE TRUMPS LAWYERS ARE

00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:29.219
MAKING CONTRARY NAMES.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR TURBERVILLE HAS 

00:40:29.438 --> 00:40:31.438
REPEATED AGAIN 

00:40:33.443 --> 00:40:35.853
AND RECOUNTED THAT CONVERSATION 
HE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP BUT I 

00:40:36.094 --> 00:40:38.114
WILL PARAPHRASE HERE, MISTER 
PRESIDENT THEY ARE GETTING THE 

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:42.409
VICE PRESIDENT OUT OF HERE, I 
HAVE GOT TO GO. AT THE TIME THE 

00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:45.649
VICE PRESIDENT WAS BEING WHISKED
AWAY, THAT IS BEFORE THE TIME 

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.876
WHEN DONALD TRUMP SENT THE TWEET
CONDEMNING 

00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:56.109
MIKE PENCE. THE CONCERN HERE IS 
IF YOU JUST HAD A SENATOR TELL 

00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:59.001
YOU THE VICE PRESIDENT IS BEING 
WHISKED AWAY FOR SAFETY AND HE 

00:40:59.234 --> 00:41:02.218
HAS GOT TO GO, THEN NINE OR 10 
MINUTES LATER YOU SEND OUT THIS 

00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:04.449
SWEET CONDEMNING THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, THAT GETS TO THE 

00:41:04.506 --> 00:41:08.603
HEART OF THIS. IN REGARDS TO 
THAT McCARTHY PHONE CALL THAT IS

00:41:09.352 --> 00:41:11.352
ALLEGED, CONGRESSWOMAN 

00:41:14.565 --> 00:41:19.275
HERRERA BUTLER, A REPUBLICAN 
FROM WASHINGTON STATE, PUT OUT A

00:41:19.512 --> 00:41:21.582
STATEMENT SAYING SHE WAS TOLD 
ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION BY KEVIN

00:41:21.816 --> 00:41:24.153
McCARTHY AND SHE POINTED OUT 
THAT SHE WENT ON RECORD ABOUT 

00:41:24.384 --> 00:41:26.384
THAT MID-JANUARY TO HER LOCAL 
NEWSPAPER. SHE 

00:41:28.808 --> 00:41:31.703
IS SAYING I WILL SAY IT IS NOT 
LIKE BRAND EVIDENCE SHE IS 

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:36.352
UNVEILING AT THE LAST MINUTE, I 
TALKED TO MY LOCAL NEWSPAPER ON 

00:41:36.597 --> 00:41:38.683
JENNY WERE 17th AND SHARED IT 
WITH LOCAL COUNTY REPUBLICAN 

00:41:38.911 --> 00:41:40.911
EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS. I WAS 
TOLD THIS 

00:41:44.515 --> 00:41:46.163
CONVERSATION HAPPENED.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND YOUR POINT ABOUT THE 

00:41:46.164 --> 00:41:48.164
FIREWALL, A GREAT WAY TO PUT IT,

00:41:52.168 --> 00:41:57.320
THE TRUMP DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WERE
ACTING LIKE THERE'S SOME HUNDRED

00:41:57.552 --> 00:41:59.855
FIREWALL BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR 
CLIENT BUT WE KNOW THAT TRUMP 

00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:02.136
HAS BEEN HANDS-ON IN THE DEFENSE
STRATEGY AND FORMALLY THE 

00:42:02.372 --> 00:42:04.578
ARGUMENTS THAT WERE OFFERED 
YESTERDAY. AND ONE OF THE HOUSE 

00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:06.861
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAID RING 
Q&amp;amp;A YESTERDAY THAT IF THE TRUMP 

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:09.392
TEAM IS ANY EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE
THEY ARE URGED AND WELCOME TO 

00:42:09.616 --> 00:42:11.664
PRESENT IT. THEY'VE HAD EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY AND STILL HAVE EVERY

00:42:11.894 --> 00:42:16.523
OPPORTUNITY. IN FACT TRUMP WAS 
ASKED TO TESTIFY AND REFUSED TO 

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.443
TESTIFY TO AVOID 
SELF-INCRIMINATION. AND SO THE 

00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:23.961
ARGUMENT FROM THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS IS IF THERE

00:42:24.197 --> 00:42:26.197
IS ANYTHING UNDERCUT THIS 

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.527
STORYLINE THIS OUT THERE AND THE
TIMELINE WE KNOW ABOUT AND THE 

00:42:32.754 --> 00:42:35.419
REPORTING THAT HAS BEEN COPIOUS,
THEY COULD OFFER IT UP, THE FACT

00:42:35.641 --> 00:42:38.968
THAT THEY ARE NOT AS MORE THAN 
JUST A REFLECTION OF THEIR 

00:42:39.197 --> 00:42:43.000
CONFIDENCE THEY ARE ULTIMATELY 
GOING TO WIN, IT IS ALSO A 

00:42:43.234 --> 00:42:46.063
REFLECTION OF THE FACT THERE ARE
NOT GOOD FACTS FOR 

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:52.120
THE PRESIDENT. WHICH IS WHY SOME
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN THE 

00:42:52.353 --> 00:42:54.877
WHITE HOUSE, SENIOR PEOPLE IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND CABINET 

00:42:55.224 --> 00:42:57.224
SECRETARIES RESIGNED IN THE 
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF JANUARY 6

00:42:57.306 --> 00:43:01.597
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO UPSET THE 
PRESIDENT WAS DRAGGING HIS FEET 

00:43:01.832 --> 00:43:05.618
AND WAS REVELING, ALLEGEDLY, IN 
THE MAYHEM IN THE CAPITAL 

00:43:05.876 --> 00:43:09.294
INSTEAD OF ACTING TO GET THE MOB

00:43:13.004 --> 00:43:14.844
TO LEAVE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE OF THE KEY MOMENTS OF 

00:43:14.845 --> 00:43:16.927
DRAMAS WHETHER HOUSE IMPEACHMENT
MANAGERS OPT TO CALL WITNESSES 

00:43:17.155 --> 00:43:21.742
TODAY WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A VOTE
IN THE SENATE AND AT LEAST TWO 

00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:23.971
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ARE PUBLICLY
PUSHED FOR THEM, SENATOR JEFF 

00:43:24.037 --> 00:43:29.681
MERKLEY OF OREGON AND SENATOR 
WHITE HOUSE. I WANT TO GO BACK 

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.447
TO RHONDA FOR THIS QUESTION OF 
WHETHER OR NOT, EVERYTHING JAMES

00:43:34.682 --> 00:43:39.250
AND I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT, 
WHETHER IT BRINGS MORE OF 

00:43:41.272 --> 00:43:44.341
DESIRE ON BEHALF OF SENATORS 
HERE TO HEAR FROM WITNESSES AND 

00:43:44.564 --> 00:43:46.564
WHO COULD ANSWER THESE 

00:43:48.568 --> 00:43:49.821
QUESTIONS, RHONDA?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: RIGHT AND BECAUSE 

00:43:49.822 --> 00:43:54.249
WE'RE HEARING THESE TWO SENATORS
SAY THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE 

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.480
WITNESSES IS SOME MEDICATION 
THAT MAY NOT FEEL THEIR 

00:43:56.548 --> 00:43:58.548
QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED DURING 
LAST NIGHT'S 

00:44:01.169 --> 00:44:05.346
Q&amp;amp;A PROCESS. ONE OF THE AREAS WE
KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT IS KEY, 

00:44:05.577 --> 00:44:07.873
AND THE REASON WHY THEY WANT 
WITNESSES, IS THE IDEA THAT 

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.963
TRUMP DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO CALL 
THE RIOT OFF. AND THE 

00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:15.192
CONVERSATION WITH TURBERVILLE, 
THERE SEEMS 

00:44:18.487 --> 00:44:21.729
TO BE THE DETAILS NO ONE IS SURE
ABOUT, IT IS THE HEART OF THE 

00:44:21.958 --> 00:44:23.958
REASON WHY SHELDON WHITEHOUSE  
ASKED THAT PERHAPS TOMMY 

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.507
TURBERVILLE AND PERHAPS KEVIN 
McCARTHY BE CALLED AS WITNESSES.

00:44:28.733 --> 00:44:31.503
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THROUGH THE
WEEK THAT THIS IS A TRIAL WHERE 

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:35.774
IF THEY DID WANT TO PROLONG IT, 
HAVING WITNESSES SEEMS TO BE 

00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:38.605
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE 
INCREDIBLY RELEVANT. NOT ONLY IS

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.393
IT ABOUT THE TURBERVILLE 
CONVERSATION, BUT ALSO THE 

00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:43.797
UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE 
HERE THERE WERE 

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.365
ALSO WITNESSES. YOU ALSO HAVE 
STAFFERS WHO COULD WEIGH IN ON 

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.176
SOME OF THESE DETAILS AND WE 
HAVE THE AFFIDAVITS WERE WRITTEN

00:44:53.536 --> 00:44:56.572
FROM THE FBI FROM MEMBERS OF THE
MOB WHO SAID YES I WAS THERE 

00:44:56.804 --> 00:45:00.497
BECAUSE I FELT DIRECTED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU WOULD THINK

00:45:00.722 --> 00:45:04.196
OUT OF ANY IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
THIS ONE WOULD BE THE ONE TO 

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:09.233
CALL WITNESSES. WE WILL SEE WHAT
THEY DECIDE, WE ARE NOT HAVING 

00:45:09.459 --> 00:45:12.577
ANY SORT OF STRONG INDICATION ON
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THEY 

00:45:12.814 --> 00:45:15.756
WILL SUCCEED IN THE VOTE TO CALL
WITNESSES. BUT IF THEY DID THOSE

00:45:15.986 --> 00:45:17.986
WITNESSES WOULD 

00:45:19.706 --> 00:45:21.794
BE SUBPOENAED. IT WOULD NOT BE 
LIKE RASKIN MENTIONED YESTERDAY 

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:26.112
WHERE THEY DID INVITE TRUMP LAST
WEEK TO TESTIFY AND HE DECLINED.

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.846
THIS WOULD BE A SUBPOENA AND THE
WITNESSES WOULD BE COMPELLED TO 

00:45:29.074 --> 00:45:32.868
COME IF THE SENATE PASSES THAT.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA, THE 

00:45:37.844 --> 00:45:40.276
TRIAL OF DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST 
IMPEACHMENT ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO 

00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:42.560
OVER THE UKRAINE SCANDAL, THEN 
MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER 

00:45:42.786 --> 00:45:47.733
WAS CONSTANTLY SAYING REPEATEDLY
WHEN HE DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES,

00:45:47.964 --> 00:45:50.380
WHEN HE DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES 
AND THEY WANTED TO HEAR FROM 

00:45:50.613 --> 00:45:53.807
JOHN BOLTON. BUT THEY WERE NOT 
IN POWER IN THE SENATE AND 

00:45:54.034 --> 00:45:56.324
DEMOCRATS DID NOT HOLD THE 
MAJORITY, THEY ARE IN POWER IN 

00:45:56.563 --> 00:45:59.774
THE SENATE NOW AND THAT'S TALK 
ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT A 

00:46:03.086 --> 00:46:04.475
YEAR MAKES.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: THAT IS RIGHT, THEY 

00:46:04.476 --> 00:46:07.762
DO HOLD THE POWER SO THEY COULD 
FORESEEABLY TRY TO GET ENOUGH 

00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:10.938
VOTES TO GET WITNESSES IF THAT 
IS THEIR DESIRE BUT WE ALSO HAVE

00:46:13.903 --> 00:46:16.572
TO REMEMBER SOME DEMOCRATS, EVEN
IF THEY ARE NOT SAYING IT 

00:46:16.806 --> 00:46:19.697
PUBLICLY, THEY DO WANT TO MOVE 
ON FROM THIS AND THEY WANT TO 

00:46:19.923 --> 00:46:23.044
PICK BACK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF
WITH BIDEN CONFIRMATIONS IN THE 

00:46:24.099 --> 00:46:27.717
$1.9 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS AID 
PACKAGE THAT RIGHT NOW IS BEING 

00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:29.953
WORKED ON IN 

00:46:31.686 --> 00:46:34.578
THE HOUSE. SO FOR BOTH SIDES 
THERE IS A DESIRE TO MOVE THIS 

00:46:34.801 --> 00:46:38.474
AS QUICKLY ALONG AS POSSIBLE. 
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, CHUCK SCHUMER

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.558
NOW HAS THE MAJORITY, THE 50-50 
SENATE, AND, LET HARRIS BRING 

00:46:42.785 --> 00:46:48.758
THE TIEBREAKER VOTE. SO THERE IS
FORESEEABLY THE POTENTIAL THEY 

00:46:48.989 --> 00:46:51.284
COULD CALL WITNESSES BUT WE ARE 
NOT HEARING A STRONG INDICATION 

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:54.630
THE VOTE WOULD PASS IT I SAY DO 
NOT TAKE ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE 

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.860
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL, ANYTHING 
COULD HAPPEN IN CONVERSATIONS 

00:46:56.935 --> 00:47:01.550
COULD BE HAD LAST NIGHT TO DO A 
WHIP COUNT ON THE WITNESSES 

00:47:01.788 --> 00:47:04.424
VOTE. WE COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
AT THE START OF THE DAY.

00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:06.425
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

00:47:08.313 --> 00:47:10.640
JAMES HELLMAN TO YOU ABOUT THIS 
QUESTION OF WITNESSES, ARE YOU 

00:47:10.868 --> 00:47:12.868
HEARING DEVELOPMENTS ON THAT 
FRONT? LET'S REMIND THE VIEWERS 

00:47:13.065 --> 00:47:17.548
OF THE POLITICS AT PLAY.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 

00:47:17.773 --> 00:47:20.041
EVERYONE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE 
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE WITNESSES AND

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:25.047
THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MIKE 
PENCE COME TESTIFY, WHITE HOUSE 

00:47:25.277 --> 00:47:27.277
AIDES WHO ARE IN THE ROOM 

00:47:30.361 --> 00:47:32.182
WITH TRUMP. THERE ARE SOME 
PRIVILEGED QUESTIONS, AND 

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:34.183
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE PROTECTIONS 
IT WAS STILL APPLY TO DONALD 

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:36.847
TRUMP IS A FORMER PRESIDENT, 
WHERE PEOPLE WOULD NOT 

00:47:37.076 --> 00:47:41.787
NECESSARILY BE FORCED, OR BE 
COMPELLED TO TALK ABOUT 

00:47:42.012 --> 00:47:47.768
CONVERSATIONS WITH TRUMP. BUT 
THE POLITICAL QUESTIONS ARE WHAT

00:47:47.994 --> 00:47:52.593
TRUMPS THE DAY OR CARRIES THE 
DAY, AND THAT IS DEMOCRATS DO 

00:47:52.821 --> 00:47:55.729
WANT TO MOVE ON AND THE POLLING 
ISN'T OVERWHELMING FOR REMOVING 

00:47:56.091 --> 00:47:58.418
TRUMP OR BLOCKING HIM FROM BEING
ABLE TO RUN AGAIN, FOR 

00:48:01.038 --> 00:48:03.359
CONVICTING HIM. IT IS A COUPLE 
POINTS HIGHER BUT SIMILAR TO 

00:48:03.588 --> 00:48:07.012
WHAT IT WAS OVER THE LAST 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. AND THE 

00:48:07.242 --> 00:48:10.418
OVERWHELMING FOCUS OF MOST 
VOTERS ARE POCKETBOOK ISSUES AND

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.791
WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN COVID, 
THE 

00:48:17.724 --> 00:48:19.971
COVID RELIEF, JAY POWELL THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN THIS 

00:48:20.214 --> 00:48:23.660
WEEK THAT THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATE IS PROBABLY ABOUT 10% RIGHT

00:48:23.896 --> 00:48:28.417
NOW IS PEOPLE UP AND LEAVING THE
WORKFORCE. PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTS

00:48:28.646 --> 00:48:32.042
TO DESPERATELY PASSES $1.9 
TRILLION COVID RELIEF PLAN NEXT 

00:48:32.266 --> 00:48:34.266
WEEK IN THE HOUSE HAS BEEN 
MOVING FORWARD WITH 

00:48:37.532 --> 00:48:40.637
THE MARKUP. BUT THERE IS A RISK 
IF YOU DRAG IT OUT EVEN ANOTHER 

00:48:40.865 --> 00:48:43.389
WEEK, EVEN AS THEY DO COMMITTEE 
BUSINESS ON THE SIDE, THERE WILL

00:48:43.617 --> 00:48:47.860
BE A PERCEPTION THAT DEMOCRATS 
ARE FOCUSED ON PUNISHING TRUMP 

00:48:48.087 --> 00:48:51.617
AND SET OF HELPING THEM THAT IS 
A HUGE CONCERN ESPECIALLY AT THE

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.840
LEADERSHIP 

00:48:55.073 --> 00:48:57.662
LEVEL. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, JEFF 
MERKLEY,  TWO OF THE MOST 

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.750
LIBERAL SENATORS ARE LESS 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT AND THEY'RE 

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:06.094
BOTH FROM VERY BLUE STATES. 
THEIR BASE WOULD LOVE TO DRAW 

00:49:06.323 --> 00:49:08.323
THIS OUT AND 

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:12.869
GET ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT WE ALL 
SORT OF ASSUME HAPPENED DURING 

00:49:13.093 --> 00:49:15.093
THOSE COUPLE OF HOURS ON THAT 
JANUARY 

00:49:18.373 --> 00:49:20.485
6 AFTERNOON. BUT THE PRESSURE 
FROM LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO BE 

00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:23.347
STRONG, AND FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
WHICH IS TAKING A HANDS-OFF ROLE

00:49:23.572 --> 00:49:28.241
BUT PRIVATELY IS EAGER TO TURN 
THE PAGE. AND ON THE REPUBLICAN 

00:49:28.463 --> 00:49:33.172
SIDE, WILL AGAIN IF THERE WAS 
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE, IF CALLING

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.972
WITNESSES WOULD HELP TRUMPS CASE
AND PEOPLE WOULD COME AS I WAS 

00:49:36.205 --> 00:49:39.920
WITH TRUMP AND HE WAS TERRIFIED 
ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS

00:49:40.167 --> 00:49:42.285
ALARMED BUT INSTEAD HE WAS 
STYMIED BY THIS OR THAT, 

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:46.515
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE EAGER TO 
HAVE THOSE WITNESSES COME TO 

00:49:46.736 --> 00:49:48.736
CLEAR OR 

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.647
EXONERATE TRUMP. BUT THERE IS NO
INDICATION THOSE WITNESSES 

00:49:55.015 --> 00:49:57.015
EXIST. AND REPUBLICANS FOR THEIR
POLITICAL PURPOSES WOULD MUCH 

00:49:57.106 --> 00:50:00.838
RATHER TURN THE PAGE AND MOVE 
ON, THEY DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE

00:50:01.071 --> 00:50:05.594
TO BE TIED TO THIS LOW POLY 
POINT OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY 

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.349
AND THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK
ABOUT COVID RELIEF, EVEN IF THEY

00:50:09.585 --> 00:50:12.419
DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR THE 
BILL, THEY WANT TO CRITICIZE JOE

00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:16.735
BIDEN FOR HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS 
THAT ARE LESS POPULAR. SO BOTH 

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.980
OF THIS RARE ALIGNED POLITICAL 
INCENTIVE WHICH IS 

00:50:21.698 --> 00:50:23.698
QUITE DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR'S
FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WHEN 

00:50:23.772 --> 00:50:26.308
DEMOCRATS DESPERATELY WANTED 
WITNESSES AND THEY WANTED TO 

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.945
HEAR FROM JOHN BOLTON AND HEAR 
FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE DIRECTLY 

00:50:29.174 --> 00:50:33.306
INVOLVED IN THE UKRAINE AFFAIR 
WHO HAD REFUSED TO TESTIFY 

00:50:33.542 --> 00:50:36.843
DURING THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS. BUT REPUBLICANS 

00:50:37.193 --> 00:50:42.310
WERE EAGER TO MOVE ON BECAUSE IT
WAS NOT IN THEIR INTEREST DEVON 

00:50:42.542 --> 00:50:47.409
IN THIS PEOPLE TESTIFY. SO THERE
ARE WEIRD CHANGES OF INCENTIVES 

00:50:47.639 --> 00:50:49.639
BUT IN THIS CASE, NEITHER SIDE 
AT THE LEADERSHIP 

00:50:52.548 --> 00:50:54.821
LEVEL ESPECIALLY, WANTS TO HEAR 
FROM WITNESSES AND IT WOULD BE 

00:50:55.046 --> 00:50:57.941
INTERESTING IF IT COMES UP FOR A
VOTE, IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE 

00:50:58.187 --> 00:51:01.312
WITNESS QUESTION WILL NOT PASS 
YOU COULD END UP HAVING A 

00:51:01.539 --> 00:51:04.271
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAY
THEY WANT WITNESSES BECAUSE THEY

00:51:04.502 --> 00:51:09.893
KNOW THE MEASURE WILL NOT 
ACTUALLY PASS. AND YOU COULD 

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.785
ALSO SEE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO 
ARE POSSIBLY ON THE FENCE USING 

00:51:15.011 --> 00:51:18.730
THE LACK OF WITNESSES AS A 
REASON OR JUSTIFICATION FOR 

00:51:18.962 --> 00:51:20.962
VOTING 

00:51:22.261 --> 00:51:24.261
AGAINST CONVICTION. SAYING I 
WANTED TO HEAR FROM WITNESSES 

00:51:24.341 --> 00:51:27.112
AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET 
THEM. THAT COULD BE THE EXCUSE 

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:31.611
ONE OR TWO REPUBLICANS USED TO 
VOTE AGAINST CONVICTION.

00:51:31.612 --> 00:51:34.942
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY 
TODAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT 

00:51:35.167 --> 00:51:40.685
WE WILL WATCH, YOU KNOW JAMES, 
WE SAW CONGRESSMAN CASTRO COME 

00:51:40.912 --> 00:51:43.309
INTO THE BUILDING WITH A 
BREAKFAST VILLAGE AND A CUP OF 

00:51:43.532 --> 00:51:46.551
COFFEE, POWERING THROUGH THIS, 
THEY DO HAVE SUCH A BIG DAY 

00:51:46.776 --> 00:51:50.968
AHEAD OF THEM AS DO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S LAWYERS. WE DID HEAR 

00:51:51.196 --> 00:51:54.811
FROM CONGRESSMAN CASTRO 
YESTERDAY, JAMES, ANSWERING THE 

00:51:55.037 --> 00:51:58.659
QUESTION THAT MITT ROMNEY AND 
SUSAN COLLINS PUT ON BOTH SIDES 

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:02.439
ABOUT MIKE PENCE AND WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW ABOUT MIKE 

00:52:02.676 --> 00:52:05.569
PENCE BEING IN DANGER AND MISTER
VANDER WIEN SAID NO HE DID NOT 

00:52:05.792 --> 00:52:09.208
KNOW HE WAS IN DANGER WHICH 
DEFIES ALL THE REPORTING AND ALL

00:52:09.435 --> 00:52:11.435
INFORMATION THAT HAS COME OUT. 

00:52:15.044 --> 00:52:17.902
BUT WHAT CONGRESSMAN CASTRO SAID
IT WAS ON TELEVISION AND WE ALL 

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:20.440
KNEW IT, IF YOU ANYWHERE NEAR 
THE TELEVISION ENTIRE WORLD KNEW

00:52:20.666 --> 00:52:23.175
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN THE 
CAPITAL BUILDING AND THAT IT WAS

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:25.829
BEING RANSACKED AND UNDER SIEGE.
SO STEPPING BACK FOR MOMENT AND 

00:52:26.066 --> 00:52:28.066
GIVING THE OBVIOUS 

00:52:29.877 --> 00:52:32.256
REALITY CHECK ON THE TIMELINE 
AND WHAT EVERYONE KNEW FRANKLY 

00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:34.481
IF YOU ARE ANYWHERE NEAR MEDIA 
IN 

00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.625
THAT MOMENT. ONE OF THE 
ARGUMENTS PEOPLE ARE MAKING 

00:52:43.957 --> 00:52:46.046
AGAINST WITNESSES IS ALL OF 
THESE JURORS, ALL OF THE 

00:52:46.269 --> 00:52:48.261
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THEY ARE 
ALL WITNESSES THEMSELVES BECAUSE

00:52:48.262 --> 00:52:52.820
THEY WERE THERE ON THAT DAY. AND
THOSE FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS IS A 

00:52:53.047 --> 00:52:57.181
LOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. LET'S 
GO LIVE TO NATIONAL REPORTER 

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.172
NICOLE ELLIS WHO HAS BEEN 
CHRONICLING THESE AND TALKING TO

00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:05.727
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO GET THEM 
ON THE RECORD. REGARDLESS OF 

00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:08.592
WHETHER THE SENATE VOTES TO 
CONVICT DONALD TRUMP TODAY, 

00:53:08.837 --> 00:53:12.919
LAWMAKERS WILL HAVE TO RECONCILE
WITH A CAPITAL COMPLEX THAT MAY 

00:53:13.143 --> 00:53:16.896
NOT EVER BE THE SAME. WHAT ARE 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TELLING YOU?

00:53:16.897 --> 00:53:20.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: A GREAT POINT, A LOT
OF MEMBERS IN CONGRESS I SPOKE 

00:53:20.893 --> 00:53:25.328
TO THIS VOTE WILL NOT CHANGE 
WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE ON JANUARY 

00:53:25.557 --> 00:53:29.730
6 WHICH IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT
FOR CONGRESSWOMAN GRACE MING 

00:53:29.955 --> 00:53:34.973
FROM NEW YORK, HER FAMILY JOINED
HER IN DC AND HAS A HUSBAND AND 

00:53:35.222 --> 00:53:39.212
TWO SONS AND THEY FELL SHORT OF 
COMING WITH HER TO WORK THAT DAY

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.122
AND THEY DECIDE TO STAY AT THEIR
DC RESIDENTS 

00:53:45.474 --> 00:53:48.702
HER SHE SAID TO ME WHAT HER DAY 
WAS LIKE AFTER SHE LEFT HOME AND

00:53:48.933 --> 00:53:50.933
LET'S TAKE 

00:53:52.249 --> 00:53:56.144
A LISTEN.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AROUND 1:30 OR TWO I GOT AN 

00:53:56.367 --> 00:53:59.970
ALERT, WE GET THOSE ALL THE TIME
WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THE 

00:54:00.191 --> 00:54:02.191
COMPLEX, WE GOT THE ALERT WITH 
THEY WERE 

00:54:05.486 --> 00:54:07.875
EVACUATING THE CANNON BUILDING 
AND MINUTES LATER THEY SAID STAY

00:54:08.103 --> 00:54:12.111
AWAY FROM DOORS AND WINDOWS ON 
THE SAME ALERT. MINUTES LATER 

00:54:12.334 --> 00:54:15.163
THEY SAID THAT WE WERE ON A 
LOCKDOWN AND THEY SAID NO ONE 

00:54:15.398 --> 00:54:19.180
COULD ENTER OR EXIT. THIS MADE 
ME A BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE I KNEW 

00:54:19.407 --> 00:54:21.732
THAT ONLY MEMBERS AND STAFF WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE 

00:54:25.886 --> 00:54:28.553
BUILDINGS. AROUND 2 PM I HEARD 
LOUD NOISES OUTSIDE AND IT GOT 

00:54:28.781 --> 00:54:31.418
LOUDER AND LOUDER. THERE WAS 
STOMPING AND BANGING AND 

00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:33.643
CHANTING. 

00:54:35.303 --> 00:54:37.980
IN RETROSPECT I DID WHAT I 
PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE 

00:54:38.216 --> 00:54:40.561
WHICH WAS TO TURN ON THE 
TELEVISION. I REALIZED THEY WERE

00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:44.727
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY ROOM. THEY WERE
COMING FROM THE SENATE SIDE OVER

00:54:44.961 --> 00:54:49.983
TO OUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN THE 
ROOM I WAS IN 

00:54:50.906 --> 00:54:54.167
BETWEEN THAT HALLWAY. I REALIZED
AT THAT MOMENT THAT EVEN IF THE 

00:54:54.464 --> 00:54:56.464
CAPITAL POLICE KNEW THAT I 

00:54:58.539 --> 00:55:00.539
WAS THERE, THEY WERE PROBABLY 
NOT ABLE TO COME 

00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:07.184
GET ME. I REALIZED IF SOMEONE 
WERE TO OPEN THE DOOR OR KNOCK 

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:11.437
DOWN THE DOOR, THAT I WOULD BE 
ON MY OWN.

00:55:11.438 --> 00:55:15.356
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DID YOU THINK THAT DYING WAS 
A POSSIBILITY?

00:55:15.357 --> 00:55:20.295
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS SOUNDS ODD, BUT I WAS 
LESS NERVOUS ABOUT THEM FINDING 

00:55:20.523 --> 00:55:25.751
ME ARE COMING INTO THE DOOR IN 
THE ROOM WHERE I WAS THEN I WAS 

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:30.460
FOR THEM TO DISCOVER THAT I WAS 
A MINORITY WOMAN. I DID NOT WANT

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.680
THEM TO SEE ME 

00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:37.722
AT ALL.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN THIS CONVERSATION I ALSO 

00:55:37.792 --> 00:55:41.719
ASKED REPRESENTATIVE MING IF SHE
WOULD TELL HER CHILDREN ABOUT 

00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:43.951
JANUARY 6 WHO WERE BOTH 

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.178
CONSIDERABLY YOUNG. SHE SAID 
EARLY LAST YEAR IN FEBRUARY WHEN

00:55:48.407 --> 00:55:50.784
CORONAVIRUS STARTED TO TAKE HOLD
IN AMERICA SHE STARTED TO TALK 

00:55:51.006 --> 00:55:54.118
TO THEM ABOUT RACE AND WAS 
CONCERNED FOR THEIR SAFETY THEN 

00:55:54.336 --> 00:55:57.161
AND HAD TO HAVE FRANK 
CONVERSATIONS EARLY IN THEIR 

00:55:57.399 --> 00:55:59.482
LIVES. AND SHE FELT COMFORTABLE 
DOING THAT AGAIN AFTER JANUARY 

00:56:01.235 --> 00:56:03.235
6. BUT SHE TALKED A LITTLE MORE 
ABOUT HOW 

00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.972
SO MANY CHILDREN, SO MANY 
VETERANS, SO MANY STUDENTS AND 

00:56:11.851 --> 00:56:14.440
YOUNG ADULTS, THEY USED TO COME 
THROUGH THE CAPITAL AND HOW IT 

00:56:14.684 --> 00:56:16.935
WAS SUCH AN OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE 
PLACE WHICH SHE MENTIONED AND 

00:56:17.154 --> 00:56:19.232
COLLEAGUES MENTIONED THROUGHOUT 
THE HEARING AS WELL. AND HOW SHE

00:56:19.453 --> 00:56:21.472
FEELS THIS EXPERIENCE AND WHAT 
HAPPENED AT THE CAPITAL HAS 

00:56:21.697 --> 00:56:25.986
ROBBED ALL OF THEM OF SUCH A 
SACRED SPACE FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. 

00:56:30.247 --> 00:56:32.247
THAT CONTEXTUALIZES HOW THIS 
EXPERIENCE HAS CHANGED THE LIVES

00:56:32.292 --> 00:56:35.289
OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I'VE 
SPOKEN TO, BUT LIKELY CHANGE THE

00:56:35.513 --> 00:56:40.038
DYNAMIC OF THIS BUILDING AND 
WHERE THEY EXPERIENCES AND SO 

00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:46.236
MANY OF US HAVE CAST OUR EYES 
AND OUR PROFESSIONAL LIVES IN 

00:56:46.461 --> 00:56:49.347
THIS MOMENT AND IN SO MANY PRIOR
TO IT. BACK TO YOU.

00:56:49.348 --> 00:56:52.782
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU, NICOLE ELLIS 
JOINING 

00:56:57.284 --> 00:56:59.284
RHONDA COLEMAN FOR 

00:57:00.945 --> 00:57:02.991
THIS REALITY, FOR HOW MEMBERS OF
PROCESSING THIS AND TALKING 

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.220
ABOUT IT AS THEY GO 

00:57:07.919 --> 00:57:10.333
BACK HOME. SORT OF THINKING 
ABOUT THEIR OWN SAFETY BUT ALSO 

00:57:10.554 --> 00:57:14.846
WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE 
POLITICALLY OF DIVISION AND 

00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:19.497
STRIFE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: RIGHT. WELL ON THE 

00:57:19.539 --> 00:57:22.850
HUMAN AND THERE IS STILL A LOT 
OF CONCERN, SENATORS AND 

00:57:23.076 --> 00:57:25.076
REPRESENTATIVES ARE STILL 
WORKING THROUGH THIS. ON THE 

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.103
HOUSE SIDE NANCY PELOSI HAS 
ASKED HER COLLEAGUES TO START 

00:57:29.323 --> 00:57:31.323
RECORDING THEIR EXPERIENCES AND 
SHE HAS SET 

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.156
UP TIME THEY CAN GO AND TALK TO 
A CAMERAMAN AND DISCUSS WHERE 

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.981
THEY WERE THAT DAY TO DOCUMENT 
FOR HISTORY BUT ALSO TO HELP 

00:57:40.385 --> 00:57:42.385
PROCESS IT. THERE IS ALSO 
COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES 

00:57:42.472 --> 00:57:44.472
AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS AND STAFF. 
THAT 

00:57:47.311 --> 00:57:49.903
IS ONGOING AND THAT IS HAPPENING
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF WHAT WE 

00:57:50.137 --> 00:57:53.485
ARE SEEING THIS WEEK. I KNOW 
THAT SENATORS HAVE SAID THAT IF 

00:57:53.705 --> 00:57:57.052
THIS IS A VOTE FOR ACQUITTAL FOR
TRUMP THEY ARE WORRIED WHAT THIS

00:57:57.274 --> 00:58:00.803
WILL TELL THE RIOTERS, THAT 
ESSENTIALLY THEY WERE CLAIMING 

00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:06.117
THEY HAD ONE AND WE SAW THE 
SHAMAN WITH THE HORNS AND HE 

00:58:06.336 --> 00:58:10.818
SAID WE WON THE DAY, WHAT WILL 
IT SAY IF TRUMP IS ACQUITTED. 

00:58:11.066 --> 00:58:16.370
THAT IS ALSO ON THE MINDS. SO 
YES MEMBERS ARE STILL WORKING 

00:58:16.592 --> 00:58:19.097
THROUGH THIS AND PROCESSING IT 
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A LOT OF 

00:58:19.321 --> 00:58:22.600
POLITICS ON THEIR MIND. I KNOW 
FROM WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM 

00:58:22.822 --> 00:58:26.773
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, WHEN 
THE DEMOCRATS WENT THROUGH THEIR

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:29.289
EXHIBITS AND SHOWING HOW CLOSE 
THE MEMBERS WERE TO DANGER, IT 

00:58:29.508 --> 00:58:31.508
WAS SO SOBERING. WE 

00:58:33.914 --> 00:58:37.389
HEARD REPORTS FROM OUR POOL 
REPORTERS IN THE CHAMBER SAYING 

00:58:37.616 --> 00:58:39.906
A LOT OF SENATORS WERE RELIVING 
THOSE EXPERIENCES THEY HAD FELT 

00:58:41.473 --> 00:58:46.485
THAT DAY. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
WILL BE ENDURING ON THE HILL, NO

00:58:46.703 --> 00:58:49.952
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE 
VOTE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

00:58:50.184 --> 00:58:52.943
WILL STILL BE ON THE MINDS OF 
MEMBERS AND STAFF, AND THE STAFF

00:58:53.172 --> 00:58:55.797
HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT HOW THIS 
AFFECTED THEM AND HOW IT HAS 

00:58:56.018 --> 00:58:58.141
FELT LIKE A HOME INVASION 
REALLY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT 

00:58:58.367 --> 00:59:02.570
EVEN AFTER THIS VOTE, THEY ARE 
STILL DEALING WITH, THE SECURITY

00:59:02.797 --> 00:59:06.687
AND THE GATES OUTSIDE WILL 
LIKELY BE UP FOR A WHILE. THIS 

00:59:06.913 --> 00:59:12.146
IS NOT A PLACE I WILL SEE TOUR 
GROUPS COMING ANYTIME SOON.

00:59:12.147 --> 00:59:16.684
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANKS RHONDA, THIS TRIAL HAS
POINTED OUT AND HIGHLIGHTED 

00:59:16.909 --> 00:59:19.259
DIVISIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AND 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 

00:59:19.483 --> 00:59:21.079
SPECIFICALLY. WE ASKED OUR 
COLLEAGUE, LILLIAN CUNNINGHAM, 

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.080
TO REFLECT ON THE PRECEDENTS OF 
THE 

00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:28.226
POLITICAL STRAIN.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: I'M LILLIAN 

00:59:28.227 --> 00:59:30.227
CUNNINGHAM THE CREATOR AND HOST 
OF THE 

00:59:33.497 --> 00:59:34.846
PRESIDENTIAL PODCAST. THE 
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 

00:59:34.847 --> 00:59:36.847
PARTIES ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING 
AND EVOLVING AND THEY HAVE 

00:59:40.025 --> 00:59:42.204
REINVENTED THEMSELVES MULTIPLE 
TIMES OVER OUR HISTORY AND AT A 

00:59:42.431 --> 00:59:46.555
FEW CRUCIAL MOMENTS THEY'VE GONE
SO FAR TO EXPLICITLY REBRAND 

00:59:46.782 --> 00:59:50.271
THEMSELVES. ONE EXAMPLE THAT WAS
IN 1864. THE CIVIL WAR WAS 

00:59:50.627 --> 00:59:52.627
RAGING AND 

00:59:55.882 --> 00:59:59.466
PRESIDENT LINCOLN, A REPUBLICAN,
WAS GOING TO RUN FOR REELECTION.

00:59:59.682 --> 01:00:04.328
HE HAD A BIT OF A PARTY PROBLEM.
YOU WERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO 

01:00:04.555 --> 01:00:07.283
SUPPORTED HIS GOAL OF SAVING THE
UNION BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS 

01:00:07.555 --> 01:00:09.555
THEY DID NOT IDENTIFY 

01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:14.118
AS REPUBLICANS. THEY HAD A BIT 
OF AN ISSUE OF THE IDEA OF 

01:00:14.352 --> 01:00:17.217
VOTING FOR A REPUBLICAN. THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD AN IDEA HE 

01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:22.424
DECIDED TO ADOPT A FEW NEW PARTY
PLATFORMS IN THAT ELECTION BUT 

01:00:22.651 --> 01:00:27.226
IT ALSO DECIDED TO TEMPORARILY 
CHANGE ITS NAME TO THE NATIONAL 

01:00:30.797 --> 01:00:35.903
UNION PARTY. AND IN PROOF OF THE
POWER THE POLITICAL LABELS HOLD,

01:00:36.145 --> 01:00:38.425
THAT NAME CHANGE WAS ENOUGH TO 
MAKE A NUMBER OF NON-REPUBLICANS

01:00:38.652 --> 01:00:41.799
FEEL OKAY ABOUT THE IDEA FOR 
VOTING FOR LINCOLN IN THE 

01:00:42.191 --> 01:00:47.004
UPCOMING ELECTION. IT WORKED AND
LINCOLN DID WHEN THE 1864 

01:00:51.883 --> 01:00:54.100
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. NOT TOO 
LONG AFTER THAT THE NATIONAL 

01:00:54.337 --> 01:00:57.119
UNION PARTY IS A NAME 
DISAPPEARED AND THEY RETURN TO 

01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:59.366
THE NAME OF THE 

01:01:02.739 --> 01:01:04.739
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

01:01:09.567 --> 01:01:13.470
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SEE TO 
BELIEVE IN WAITING ISN'T AN 

01:01:13.817 --> 01:01:15.878
OPTION, WATCH FOR THE NEWSROOM 
OF THE WASHINGTON POST, WE 

01:01:16.104 --> 01:01:20.845

WHY IT MATTERS, THANKS FOR

ABOUT OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO 
INFORM THE PUBLIC, PROTECT THE 

01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:38.042
FIRST AMENDMENT AND FOSTER A 
HEALTHY DEMOCRACY WE COULD NOT 

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.345
DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

01:01:50.169 --> 01:01:52.169
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS ARE 
ARRIVING OUT INTO 

01:01:56.393 --> 01:02:01.210
THE CAPITAL. YOU CAN SEE GOING 
THROUGH THE SCANNER AND HAVE TO 

01:02:01.445 --> 01:02:04.868
GIVE A SYMPATHETIC LAUGH BECAUSE
FOR ALL OF US TO GO TO CAPITOL 

01:02:05.098 --> 01:02:09.183
HILL A LOT, THIS IS PART OF THE 
PROCESS, YOU GET REALLY FAST. IF

01:02:09.408 --> 01:02:11.408
YOU FLY A LOT 

01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:16.436
YOU GET TO GOING THROUGH 
SECURITY AND REMOVE EVERYTHING 

01:02:16.546 --> 01:02:19.784
FROM YOUR POCKETS BUT BECAUSE IT
IS A STRUGGLE TO GET THROUGH THE

01:02:21.135 --> 01:02:24.051
METAL DETECTOR ISSUES A NEW IT 
IS TO BE WITH THEM ON CAPITOL 

01:02:24.279 --> 01:02:29.062
HILL AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS.
ONE OF THE LAWYERS QUESTION IF 

01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:33.964
HE WAS UNDER OATH, APPEARING IN 
THE WELL OF THE SENATE ARGUING 

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.200
AGAINST THE CONVICTION OF THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE 

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.745
UNITED STATES. THIS IS NOT THE 
NORMAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE 

01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:44.638
ATTORNEYS, THEY ARE NOT 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLARS 

01:02:49.426 --> 01:02:52.477
OR EXPERTS, AND THEY ARE 
ESSENTIALLY PERSONAL INJURY 

01:02:52.706 --> 01:02:55.140
LAWYERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN THIS 
CASE IN SOME WAYS AT THE 

01:02:59.607 --> 01:03:02.171
LAST MINUTE. LET'S GO TO AARON 
BLAKE, SENIOR REPORTER FOR THE 

01:03:02.406 --> 01:03:05.281
FIX, AND I WANTED TO START OFF 
WITH AN IMPORTANT POINT. WE HAVE

01:03:05.508 --> 01:03:07.618
HEARD A COUPLE OF TIMES 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS BLAME 

01:03:07.844 --> 01:03:09.844
THE 

01:03:11.561 --> 01:03:13.616
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, TRYING TO 
CLAIM IT WAS A RUSHED AND 

01:03:17.913 --> 01:03:19.915
QUICK PROCESS. BUT DONALD TRUMP 
CYCLE THROUGH ATTORNEYS BEFORE 

01:03:20.147 --> 01:03:22.634
LANDING ON THESE GENTLEMEN, 
CERTAINLY NOT THE FAULT OF THE 

01:03:27.465 --> 01:03:29.615
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS THE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH 

01:03:29.842 --> 01:03:31.842
LEGAL TEAM HE HAD 

01:03:35.183 --> 01:03:39.080
GONE THROUGH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK WE'RE HAVING A 

01:03:39.318 --> 01:03:41.828
PROBLEM WITH YOUR AUDIO AND WE 
WILL TRY TO FIX THAT. YOU'RE 

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:47.261
ECHOING AND FAR AWAY WE WILL TRY
TO FIX THAT BUT LET'S BRING YOU 

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.193
AND JAMES, A TIMELINE JAMES OF 
THE LAWYERS GETTING 

01:03:54.516 --> 01:03:56.343
THE CASE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WOULD BE THESE THREE SOUTH

01:03:56.344 --> 01:03:58.434
CAROLINA LAWYERS BUT THEY WERE 
UNWILLING TO ARGUE THE ELECTION 

01:03:58.659 --> 01:04:02.207
WAS STOLEN AND THAT TRUMP DID 
WHEN AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT 

01:04:02.443 --> 01:04:06.284
WANTED TO BE AS RATIONALE IT 
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO 

01:04:06.516 --> 01:04:08.989
BE TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING LIKE  
BECAUSE THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN 

01:04:09.222 --> 01:04:11.222
FROM HIM, THEY WOULD NOT 

01:04:14.866 --> 01:04:18.901
DO THAT. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO 
ARGUE AS A LAWYER SOMETHING YOUR

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:21.588
KNOWING NOT TRUE, AND THE KEY 
MOMENT YESTERDAY WAS A QUESTION 

01:04:21.819 --> 01:04:23.819
FROM BERNIE SANDERS ASKING 
MICHAEL VANDER WIEN, WAS TRUMP 

01:04:23.921 --> 01:04:28.097
WRONG TO SAY THE ELECTION WAS 
STOLEN. WAS IT A BIG LIE? HE 

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:31.377
TOOK UMBRAGE AT THAT AND REFUSE 
TO ANSWER 

01:04:35.153 --> 01:04:37.449
THE QUESTION, WHICH IS DIFFERENT
FROM EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN 

01:04:37.693 --> 01:04:39.762
BRUCE CASTRO, HIS LAW PARTNER IN
PHILADELPHIA AND THE PERSONAL 

01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:43.196
INJURY FIRM, DID SAY THAT THE 
PEOPLE 

01:04:48.003 --> 01:04:50.003
REJECTED FROM. YOU DON'T NEED 
IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE THE AMERICAN

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:53.148
PEOPLE REJECTED AT THE BALLOT 
BOX. SOMETHING OUR SOURCES TELL 

01:04:53.378 --> 01:04:55.378
US QUITE PERTURBED THE 

01:04:57.188 --> 01:04:59.053
FORMER PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LINDSEY GRAHAM COMING IN NOW 

01:04:59.054 --> 01:05:03.360
AND THE SENATOR OPTING NOT TO 
WEAR A MASK. WE KNOW THAT 

01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:07.413
CONGRESS HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO GET THEIR VACCINATIONS FOR 

01:05:07.649 --> 01:05:09.709
CORONAVIRUS BUT WE ARE STILL 
LEARNING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT 

01:05:09.943 --> 01:05:12.368
YOU CAN GIVE OTHER PEOPLE 
CORONAVIRUS EVEN IF YOU HAD THE 

01:05:12.597 --> 01:05:14.881
VACCINES OF THE FACT HE IS 
TALKING TO REPORTERS AND STAFF 

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.943
AND EVERYONE ELSE WITHOUT A MASK
ON, IT COULD POTENTIALLY 

01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:24.371
ENDANGER OTHERS.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RAND PAUL WALKED BY A MINUTE 

01:05:24.594 --> 01:05:27.325
AGO WITH NO MASK IN THE FUNDING 
ABOUT WATCHING THIS FEED AS WE 

01:05:27.552 --> 01:05:30.708
WAIT FOR THE TRIAL TO BEGIN, IT 

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:36.996
IS POLITICIANS TOO, AND YOU 
MENTION THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 

01:05:37.226 --> 01:05:40.520
MANAGER JOAQUIN CASTRO WITH HIS 
COFFEE AND BREAKFAST SANDWICH, 

01:05:40.755 --> 01:05:43.613
AND THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER 
HAVING A BAG LIKE 

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:48.843
MARY POPPINS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF HE HAD THE MARY POPPINS 

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:53.646
BACK HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN 
THROUGH THEIR FASTER. A BACKPACK

01:05:53.881 --> 01:05:55.739
OR PURSE OR BRIEFCASE IS GOING 
TO CAPITOL HILL.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.699
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE FEMALE LAWYER WITH 
HIM WITH 

01:06:02.577 --> 01:06:04.430
RIGHT THROUGH.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS A REMINDER OF HOW 

01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:07.718
DIVIDED WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. A 
BUNCH OF THESE REPUBLICANS ARE 

01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:12.816
NOT WEARING MASKS ANYMORE. AT 
THE SAME TIME PRESIDENT BIDEN IS

01:06:13.048 --> 01:06:16.574
URGING PEOPLE TO MASK UP BUT WE 
ARE DURING A PANDEMIC AND YOU 

01:06:16.805 --> 01:06:19.306
ARE NYR IN SEPARATE ROOMS THIS 
MORNING RATHER THAN THE SAME 

01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:22.707
ROOM AS WE'RE TAKING THE 
PANDEMIC SERIOUSLY. IT IS A 

01:06:22.947 --> 01:06:27.698
REFLECTION OF HOW DIVIDED THE 
COUNTRY IS, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 

01:06:27.926 --> 01:06:32.284
WHO WORK IN THE CAPITAL LIKE 
RHONDA WAS SAYING A FEW MINUTES 

01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:36.137
AGO, FOR THEM IT WAS LIKE 9/11. 
THEY EQUATE JANUARY 6 WITH 9/11 

01:06:36.361 --> 01:06:41.366
IN THEIR MINDS. AND THE FACT 
THAT EVERYTHING A MEMBER OF THE 

01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:43.599
SENATE STOOD UP 

01:06:45.747 --> 01:06:47.747
LAST NIGHT TO APPLAUD EUGENE 
GOODMAN, OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN,

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:49.416
FORGETTING THE CONGRESSIONAL 
MEDAL WHICH WAS UNANIMOUSLY 

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:52.743
AGREED TO AND CHUCK SCHUMER AND 
MITCH McCONNELL BOTH SPOKE, THEY

01:06:52.979 --> 01:06:56.965
ALL AGREE THAT EUGENE GOODMAN 
WAS A HERO FOR SAVING THEIR 

01:06:57.207 --> 01:06:59.207
LIVES, BUT THEY COULD 

01:07:02.467 --> 01:07:04.913
NOT AGREE WHY IT IS EUGENE 
GOODMAN NEEDED TO SAVE THEIR 

01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:07.141
LIVES. THAT 

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.989
REFLECTS SOMETHING, SOMETHING 
PROFOUND ABOUT THE STATE OF 

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:17.996
AMERICAN 2021. AND JUST HOW 
DIVIDED THE COUNTRY IS RIGHT 

01:07:18.224 --> 01:07:23.887
NOW. WE CANNOT AGREE IS THIS 
WEEK HAS SHOWN, A SHARED SET OF 

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:26.587
FACTS. JAMES WE HAVE BREAKING 
NEWS AND THIS WAS 

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:34.040
COMING FROM POLITICO AND THE 
WASHINGTON POST HAS MATCHED THIS

01:07:34.273 --> 01:07:36.273
REPORTING PERIOD MITCH McCONNELL
IS TELLING COLLEAGUES IN A 

01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:38.431
LETTER HE IS GOING TO VOTE TO 
ACQUIT. JAMES. 

01:07:38.432 --> 01:07:40.914
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT, 
FRANKLY NOT SURPRISING, BUT IT 

01:07:45.332 --> 01:07:48.022
IS REVEALING. IT IS A HUGE BLOW 
FOR ANY HELP FROM THE 

01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:50.279
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS THAT MAY 
SOMEHOW GET UNEXPECTEDLY 

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:56.037
TO 17. THE TRANSPORTATION 
SECRETARY 

01:08:00.261 --> 01:08:02.569
WIFE RESIDE IMMEDIATELY IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF JANUARY 6 THAT SHE 

01:08:02.804 --> 01:08:04.883
WAS SO ANGRY THE PRESIDENT DID 
NOT SEND HELP IMMEDIATELY. 

01:08:05.143 --> 01:08:08.124
McCONNELL MADE IT CLEAR HE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING AND HE

01:08:08.354 --> 01:08:10.679
HAD HIS AIDES AND CLOSE ADVISERS
CALLING UP SUPPORTERS TO SAY 

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:17.818
THAT HE WAS OPEN TO VOTING TO 
CONVICT TRUMP. AND THEN HE LET 

01:08:18.043 --> 01:08:22.916
THE TRIAL BALLOON GO OUT AND 
WATCH AS A REPUBLICAN PARTY 

01:08:23.144 --> 01:08:25.268
RALLIED BEHIND TRUMP, TRIBALISM 

01:08:29.697 --> 01:08:32.101
HAS BEEN TRUMP'S BEST FRIEND THE
LAST FEW YEARS REALLY. AND 

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:35.418
McCONNELL BACKED AWAY FROM THAT.
I THINK THE CRUCIAL VOTE WAS ON 

01:08:35.656 --> 01:08:40.361
THE CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER, RAND 
PAUL FELLOW KENTUCKIAN, PUT UP 

01:08:40.597 --> 01:08:42.597
THE 

01:08:45.602 --> 01:08:49.608
TEST VOTE THE WEEK BEFORE LAST 
AND VOTED TO SAY THE TRIAL 

01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:52.315
WASN'T CONSTITUTIONAL AFTER HE 
DID THAT IT WAS CLEAR HE WOULD 

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.624
NOT VOTE TO CONVICT. BUT IT IS 
STILL SIGNIFICANT AS HE FANCIES 

01:08:55.855 --> 01:08:57.855
HIMSELF AS AN INSTITUTIONALIST, 
ALTHOUGH HIS RECORD OVER THE 

01:08:57.948 --> 01:09:01.901
PAST FEW YEARS DOES NOT ALWAYS 
LIVE UP TO THAT. HE IS SOMEONE 

01:09:02.127 --> 01:09:05.635
WHO DID OPPOSE IN VERY STRONG 
TERMS THE EFFORT BY PEOPLE TO 

01:09:05.861 --> 01:09:09.824
BLOCK THE CERTIFICATION OF THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS ON 

01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:16.912
JANUARY 6. HE HAS BEEN IN THE 
SENATE SINCE 1984. HE DOES CARE 

01:09:17.141 --> 01:09:21.317
ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE 
PREROGATIVE. AND THE FACT THAT 

01:09:21.551 --> 01:09:27.056
HE HAS FALLEN IN LINE DESPITE 
HIS CLEAR ANGER AT TRUMP, HE 

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:34.150
ALSO BLAMES TRUMP FOR COSTING 
HIM HIS JOB.

01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:36.151
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, POLITICS 

01:09:37.628 --> 01:09:40.681
IS WHAT MITCH McCONNELL OPERATES
ON AND HE IS A MASTERFUL 

01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:43.668
POLITICIAN. THE POINT YOU ARE 
ABOUT TO MAKE IS HE COST HIM A 

01:09:43.892 --> 01:09:47.191
MAJORITY LEADERSHIP IN THE 
SENATE, BY INTERFERING IN THE 

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.433
GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS. LET'S GO
TO 

01:09:52.076 --> 01:09:54.670
RHONDA COLEMAN TO BRING HER IN 
ON THIS BREAKING IS THAT MITCH 

01:09:54.915 --> 01:09:56.915
McCONNELL PLANTS EVENTUALLY QUIT
AND IS LETTING HIS COLLEAGUES 

01:09:56.991 --> 01:10:00.067
KNOW NOW. IT WILL NOT BE A 
SURPRISE AND A WAIT AND SEE HOW 

01:10:00.288 --> 01:10:03.444
I VOTE ON THE FLOOR, WHICH MAKES
SENSE AS YOU DO NOT WANT TO KEEP

01:10:04.965 --> 01:10:07.674
THE CAUCUS GUESSING IS A NEED 
THAT TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEIR 

01:10:08.222 --> 01:10:10.159
OWN DECISIONS.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS RIGHT AND HE SAID 

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.256
EARLIER HE HAS NOT TOLD HIS 
CAUCUS OUT TO VOTE AND HE IS 

01:10:14.486 --> 01:10:17.437
LEFT IT UP TO THEM AND 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAID THEY 

01:10:17.684 --> 01:10:20.894
FELT NO PRESSURE FROM THE LEADER
TO CHOOSE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. 

01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:23.182
BUT ALSO THIS NEWS ABOUT MITCH 
McCONNELL IS INTERESTING BECAUSE

01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:28.011
FOUR WEEKS AGO HE WAS ON THE 
FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND HE SAID 

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:33.440
FROM PROVOKED THE MOB AND THE 
MOB WAS FED LIES AND THAT IS A 

01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:38.208
WHOLE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CASE 
AND THAT IS TRUMP INCITED THIS 

01:10:38.428 --> 01:10:41.020
MOB AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
McCONNELL SEEM TO AGREE WITH A 

01:10:41.252 --> 01:10:43.973
FEW WEEKS AGO. AND THAT IS ONE 
OF THE REASONS WE WERE WATCHING 

01:10:44.202 --> 01:10:47.586
TO SEE HOW HE ACTED AND HOW HE 
WOULD MAKE HIS DECISION TO VOTE.

01:10:47.807 --> 01:10:51.287
THAT IS WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT 
RIGHT NOW. HE SAID THAT THEN AND

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:56.163
AS YOU POINTED OUT HE IS A 
MASTERFUL POLITICIAN. KENTUCKY 

01:10:56.387 --> 01:11:00.613
IS STILL A STATE THAT IS VERY 
SUPPORTIVE OF FORMER PRESIDENT 

01:11:00.974 --> 01:11:03.964
TRUMP. HE IS READING THE TEA 
LEAVES BACK HOME AND NOW 

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:07.264
DECIDING TO VOTE TO ACQUIT. IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING 

01:11:10.438 --> 01:11:13.743
TO SEE IF THIS WAYS ON THE MINDS
OF THOSE IN HIS CAUCUS AND IF 

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:17.488
HIS VOTE HAS ANY SORT OF 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OTHER 

01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:19.329
REPUBLICAN SENATORS HE MAY BE ON
THE FENCE.

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:23.806
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AARON BLAKE LET'S BRING YOU 
BACK TO THE CONVERSATION, YOU 

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:27.742
KNOW RHONDA'S LAST POINT IS 
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IF MITCH 

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:30.819
McCONNELL WAS GOING TO VOTE TO 
CONVICT IT WOULD GIVE COVER TO 

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:33.041
SOME OF THE MODERATES LIKE LISA 
MURKOWSKI AND 

01:11:35.965 --> 01:11:39.076
SUSAN COLLINS, WHO ONE YEAR AGO 
VOTED TO ACQUIT THE PRESIDENT IN

01:11:39.298 --> 01:11:41.551
THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AND 
LISA MURKOWSKI CITING CONCERNS 

01:11:41.774 --> 01:11:43.774
WITH THE PROCESS AND NOT WITH 

01:11:46.173 --> 01:11:47.961
TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH I THINK IT MAKES THE 

01:11:47.962 --> 01:11:53.338
IDEA THAT WE WILL HAVE SEVERAL, 
MORE THAN A COUPLE OF A FEW 

01:11:53.565 --> 01:11:56.172
VOTES TO CONVICT IN THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATE CAUCUS, VERY 

01:11:56.398 --> 01:11:58.657
UNLIKELY IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
LIKELY BEFORE WE LEARNED THIS 

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.013
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHAT
MITCH McCONNELL ACTUALLY SAID 

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:08.950
ABOUT THE CAPITAL RIOT. A LOT OF
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOURS AND 

01:12:09.393 --> 01:12:14.379
FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS, THEY 
REFERENCE THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE 

01:12:14.608 --> 01:12:17.774
IN THERE IS ONE POINT OR SENATOR
KEVIN KRAMER ACTUALLY SAID THE 

01:12:19.671 --> 01:12:21.950
PRESIDENT WAS INCITING WITH HIS 
SPEECH AND HE USED THE WORD 

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:26.457
INCITING OF COURSE NOW IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS GOING TO ACQUIT. 

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.313
MITCH McCONNELL GAVE A SPEECH, I
BELIEVE ON 

01:12:34.242 --> 01:12:39.638
JANUARY 19,, TO SAY THAT THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PROVOKED TO THE

01:12:39.864 --> 01:12:44.745
PRESIDENT. WE CAN PARSE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROVOKED AND 

01:12:45.098 --> 01:12:49.129
INCITED. THEY ARE LISTED AS 
SYNONYMS IN MERRIAM-WEBSTER. BUT

01:12:49.377 --> 01:12:51.962
THE IDEA THAT HE MADE THAT 
STATEMENT 13 DAYS LATER, IT WAS 

01:12:52.182 --> 01:12:55.334
NOT A HEAT OF THE MOMENT 
REACTION, NOT 

01:12:59.037 --> 01:13:01.037
HIMSELF CAN SAID THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF 

01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:06.516
AND VOTE TO INCITE THESE PEOPLE 
AND IT IS SHOWING HOW UNLIKELY 

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.270
IT IS WE WILL GET PAST MITT 
ROMNEY AND LISA MURKOWSKI AND 

01:13:10.492 --> 01:13:13.062
SUSAN COLLINS OF THIS CAUCUS 
VOTING TO CONVICT, A VERY 

01:13:17.188 --> 01:13:18.924
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TACTICS 

01:13:18.925 --> 01:13:24.118
THE DEFENSE TEAM HAS USED THE 
TRIAL AND LIKELY MORE TODAY, THE

01:13:24.343 --> 01:13:28.840
ARGUMENT THAT DEMOCRATS AND 
CELEBRITIES, QUESTIONS OF THEIR 

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:33.357
RELEVANCE, BUT EVEN CELEBRITIES 
USE OF THE TERM FIGHT OFTEN 

01:13:33.581 --> 01:13:35.581
POLITICAL SPEECH SO HOW ARE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WORKING TO 

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.620
COUNTER THAT CHARGE IN THESE 
CLOSING 

01:13:40.718 --> 01:13:42.677
ARGUMENTS TODAY?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THE IDEA I REFERENCED

01:13:42.678 --> 01:13:46.508
YESTERDAY WHEN I WROTE ABOUT ALL
OF THIS IS YOU CAN PULL 

01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:49.884
ANECDOTES IN CHERRY PICK THINGS,
THERE ARE MANY CLIPS I THINK 

01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:54.659
THEY PLAYED THAT WERE 
POTENTIALLY OBJECTIONABLE, 

01:13:54.891 --> 01:13:56.891
LANGUAGE POLITICIANS MIGHT WANT 

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:02.140
TO AVOID. BUT WHEN YOU PULL IT 
OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF THESE 

01:14:02.369 --> 01:14:04.369
THINGS LEADING TO SOMETHING OR 
ALLEGEDLY LEADING TO SOMETHING 

01:14:04.504 --> 01:14:07.942
VIOLENT, WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE 
PRESIDENT HAVING CLAIMED FOR 

01:14:08.171 --> 01:14:12.827
MANY WEEKS AND MONTHS WITHOUT 
ANY REAL SUBSTANTIATION THAT THE

01:14:13.175 --> 01:14:16.645
ELECTION WAS GOING TO BE STOLEN 
FROM HIM OR WOULD BE STOLEN, 

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:24.330
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WITH THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE FOCUSED A LOT ON,

01:14:24.565 --> 01:14:26.618
WAS THE APPARENT INDIFFERENCE TO
WHAT HAPPENED EARLY IN THE 

01:14:26.839 --> 01:14:30.372
CAPITAL RIOT. I THINK THE CASE 
FOR THEM IS BRING ALL OF THOSE 

01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:34.296
THINGS TOGETHER. ANY ONE OF THE 
THINGS COULD SEE RESEMBLANCE TO 

01:14:34.651 --> 01:14:37.656
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN POLITICAL 
LIFE BEFORE BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:42.628
NOT JUST A COMBINATION OF THEM 
BUT THE RESULT OF PEOPLE 

01:14:42.859 --> 01:14:44.859
STORMING THE 

01:14:46.737 --> 01:14:49.170
CAPITAL, HISTORIC, NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE SAW HAPPEN AFTER ANY OF 

01:14:49.399 --> 01:14:51.216
THE CLIPS THEY PLAYED OF 
DEMOCRATS TALKING ABOUT 

01:14:51.217 --> 01:14:55.341
FIGHTING. IT REALLY REINFORCES 
THAT YOU CAN CHERRY PICK YOUR 

01:14:55.577 --> 01:14:58.163
CASE BUT IT DOES NOT BEAR ANY 
RESEMBLANCE TO THE REALITY OF 

01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:00.386
WHAT HAPPENED ON 

01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:05.920
JANUARY 6. I WOULD EXPECT AS WE 
DEBATE THE WITNESSES TODAY 

01:15:06.145 --> 01:15:08.309
DEMOCRATS WILL REINFORCE IT IS 
NOT JUST ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 

01:15:09.164 --> 01:15:11.863
SAYING FIGHT A FEW TIMES IN THE 
SPEECH AND NOT JUST ABOUT HIM 

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:14.638
SAYING THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN A
FEW TIMES BUT A COMBINATION OF 

01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:17.143
ALL THE THINGS COMING TOGETHER 
AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK 

01:15:17.384 --> 01:15:20.871
THAT COMBINATION COMBINES TO THE
INCITEMENT, THAT IS THE ARGUMENT

01:15:21.098 --> 01:15:25.591
AND NOT WHAT WE SAW IN ANY OF 
THE CLIPS WE SAW FROM THE TRUMP 

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.820
LEGAL TEAM 

01:15:30.785 --> 01:15:32.733
ON FRIDAY.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES THE 

01:15:32.734 --> 01:15:35.436
SENATE WILL GAVEL IN AND LET'S 
GO TO JAMES HILLMAN ON WHAT TO 

01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:37.696
EXPECT. FIRST THE QUESTION OF 
WITNESSES AND LET'S REMIND THE 

01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:41.631
VIEWERS AND OURSELVES THAT IT IS
UP TO THE TO SIDES AS TO WHETHER

01:15:44.124 --> 01:15:46.433
THEY REQUEST TO CALL WITNESSES 
AND AT THAT POINT THE SENATE 

01:15:46.657 --> 01:15:49.410
PASSED AWAY IN WENT TO FIGURE 
OUT IF SENATORS HAVE TO GO ON 

01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:51.803
THE RECORD AND VOTE YES OR NO TO
ALLOW THE 

01:15:55.715 --> 01:15:57.294
WITNESSES RIGHT?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES THIS COULD BE DISPATCHED 

01:15:57.295 --> 01:15:59.764
WITH QUICKLY AND FOR THE REASONS
WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES 

01:15:59.995 --> 01:16:04.332
AGO, THAT IS BOTH SIDES OF 
POLITICAL INCENTIVES TO MOVE ON.

01:16:04.558 --> 01:16:06.558
AND NOT DRAG IT OUT FOR 

01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:14.251
DIFFERENT REASONS. IT IS JUST 
NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN. THOUGH 

01:16:14.474 --> 01:16:18.614
THERE IS SOME CHANCE THAT EVERY 
SENATOR HAS A LOT OF POWER AND A

01:16:20.006 --> 01:16:22.006
SINGLE SENATOR OR SOMEONE LIKE 

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:27.126
A SHELDON WHITEHOUSE OR JEFF 
MERKLEY, TWO OF THE MORE LIBERAL

01:16:27.353 --> 01:16:30.112
MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER , COULD 
MAKE SOME KIND OF MOTION A CALL 

01:16:30.334 --> 01:16:34.515
FOR WITNESSES WHICH COULD FORCE 
A VOTE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF 

01:16:34.743 --> 01:16:38.836
MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER 
DOES NOT WANT THEM TO, HE HAS 

01:16:39.057 --> 01:16:41.057
QUITE A LOT OF POWER TO MOVE ON 

01:16:44.907 --> 01:16:47.093
FROM THAT. IT IS NOTABLE THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 

01:16:47.316 --> 01:16:49.656
NOT AGITATING FOR WITNESSES AND 
THEY ALSO COULD BE SAYING WE 

01:16:50.024 --> 01:16:52.474
WANT WITNESSES. AND PRIVATELY 
THEY DID WANT TO CALL WITNESSES.

01:16:55.127 --> 01:16:58.708
BUT PUBLICLY THEY UNDERSTAND THE
BIGGER PICTURE AND THEY DO NOT 

01:16:58.937 --> 01:17:03.914
WANT TO STYMIE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S
FIRST 100 DAYS. EVEN DURING THE 

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:06.553
Q&amp;amp;A YESTERDAY WE COULD HAVE HER 
THAT AS A REFRAIN, CALL 

01:17:06.786 --> 01:17:10.161
WITNESSES AND LET US BRING THEM 
IN AND ASK THESE QUESTIONS BUT 

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:15.237
THEY DID NOT DO THAT. IT WOULD 
BE FASCINATING TO WATCH AS WE 

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.662
DON'T KNOW ENTIRELY HOW IT WILL 
PLAY OUT BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS

01:17:18.883 --> 01:17:23.570
SOMETHING THAT WILL DRAG ON FOR 
A BIG PART OF THE MORNING.

01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:25.617
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AFTER THAT WE GO THROUGH 
PROCEDURAL MOTIONS AND THEN 

01:17:25.839 --> 01:17:28.494
MAYBE GET ON TO CLOSING 
STATEMENTS WHICH COULD BE A 

01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:32.733
MAXIMUM OF FOUR HOURS BETWEEN 
THE TWO SIDES. INTERESTINGLY, 

01:17:32.964 --> 01:17:36.446
WHEN ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON 
THE HILL WAS ASKING A TRUMP 

01:17:36.663 --> 01:17:40.404
LAWYER FOR A LONG THEY WOULD GO,
THE TRUMP ATTORNEY DID NOT TO 

01:17:40.626 --> 01:17:44.020
REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME HE HAD. HE
CONFUSED HIMSELF HOW MUCH TIME 

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:47.564
HE HAD, WHICH GOES ON YOU OF AN 
EXPERIENCE THIS IS IN A 

01:17:51.494 --> 01:17:54.563
VERY HIGH-STAKES. BUT NOT A LOT 
OF RISK ESSENTIALLY FOR 

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:56.815
CONVICTION GIVEN HOW REPUBLICANS
OF COMING TO THIS TRIAL WITH 

01:17:57.048 --> 01:17:59.758
THEIR MINDS MADE UP. DEMOCRATS 
HAVE THEIR MINDS MADE UP BUT 

01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:02.604
REPUBLICANS ARE THE ONES WHERE 
WATCHING.

01:18:02.605 --> 01:18:06.548
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS IS I 
READ McCONNELL'S NOTE 

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:11.691
HE SENT TO HIS REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES. WHAT MATTERS IS THE 

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.001
FINAL VOTE, HE SAID THIS IS A 
VOTE OF CONSCIENCE AND I WILL 

01:18:17.227 --> 01:18:19.227
NOT BEGRUDGE ANY REPUBLICAN 
SENATOR FOR VOTING TO CONVICT 

01:18:19.337 --> 01:18:21.412
AND HE SAID THIS IS A CLOSE 
CALL.

01:18:21.413 --> 01:18:25.767
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITH A CLOSE CALL HE SAYS I 
AM PERSUADED THAT IMPEACHMENTS 

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:29.970
ARE A TOOL PRIMARILY OF REMOVAL 
AND WE THEREFORE 

01:18:33.867 --> 01:18:35.727
LACKED JURISDICTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 

01:18:35.728 --> 01:18:37.795
ABOUT ALL WEEK, LIBBY, THE 
PROCEDURAL OFFRAMP. HE IS NOT 

01:18:38.022 --> 01:18:41.770
DEFENDING TRUMP'S CONDUCT OR 
BACKING OFF HIS EARLIER COMMENT 

01:18:42.282 --> 01:18:44.282
THAT TRUMP PROVOKED 

01:18:46.398 --> 01:18:50.266
HIS GROUP, HE IS FOCUSING ON 
BASICALLY 

01:18:53.527 --> 01:18:55.527
CONSTITUTIONAL LOOPHOLES TO TRY 
TO JUSTIFY 

01:18:58.002 --> 01:19:00.038
NOT GETTING WITH THE BASIN 
HAVING A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS

01:19:00.258 --> 01:19:04.538
TURN AGAINST HIM WHEN HE IS THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE SENATE.

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:06.539
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK TO 

01:19:08.623 --> 01:19:11.338
JOYCE COE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
WERE WATCHING TO SEE IF THERE 

01:19:11.562 --> 01:19:14.287
WILL BE A VOTE ON WITNESSES AND 
WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM THE 

01:19:17.799 --> 01:19:19.084
TRUMP TEAM?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REPORTER: THIS MORNING BRUCE 

01:19:19.085 --> 01:19:21.085
CASTOR ONE OF TRUMP'S ATTORNEY 
TOLD OUR REPORTERS YESTERDAY 

01:19:21.163 --> 01:19:23.398
THAT THEY WOULD BE CALLING 
WITNESSES IF THAT IS WHAT THE 

01:19:23.622 --> 01:19:25.642
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS HAVE 
DECIDED. AS THERE HAS BEEN A 

01:19:25.868 --> 01:19:29.175
SMALL NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS PRESSURING HOUSE 

01:19:29.401 --> 01:19:31.417
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAYING THEY
WANT TO CALL WITNESSES IN THIS, 

01:19:31.645 --> 01:19:33.645
WE HAVE NOW HEARD 

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.221
FROM TRUMP'S LEGAL DEFENSE AND 
THEY ARE SIDE OF THINGS. AND ONE

01:19:38.444 --> 01:19:45.134
OF OUR REPORTERS REPORTING THAT 
A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH A TRUMP 

01:19:45.355 --> 01:19:49.026
LEGAL TEAM WHO SAID THE SOLE 
CHARGE OF INCITEMENT DOES NOT 

01:19:49.261 --> 01:19:53.875
DIRECTLY DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE. 
THEY ALSO SAID THEY ARE VERY 

01:19:54.096 --> 01:19:56.096
MUCH READY IF WITNESSES BEGIN 

01:19:59.943 --> 01:20:02.356
GETTING CALLED. THEY SAID THE 
FIRST TWO WITNESSES THAT TRUMP'S

01:20:02.575 --> 01:20:07.026
LEGAL DEFENSE WOULD CALL WOULD 
BE NANCY PELOSI AND MARIELLE 

01:20:07.255 --> 01:20:10.022
BOWSER TO ASK THEM UNDER OATH 
AND ON CAMERA WHY THEY DID NOT 

01:20:10.247 --> 01:20:14.421
REQUEST ADDITIONAL SECURITY AND 
NATIONAL GUARD ASSISTANCE. IF 

01:20:14.646 --> 01:20:19.851
DEMOCRATS WANT TO GO DOWN THAT 
ROAD WE ARE READY. I JUST WANTED

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:23.532
TO MENTION THAT BOWSER DID 
REQUEST A NATIONAL GUARDSMEN TO 

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:28.577
BE THERE THAT DAY AND THAT 
REQUEST WAS DENIED. WE HEARD 

01:20:28.808 --> 01:20:31.832
REPORTS THAT NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK
SCHUMER WERE ON THE PHONE CALLS 

01:20:36.605 --> 01:20:41.459
THAT DAY WITH THE GOVERNOR OF 
MARYLAND TO SEE THEY COULD GET 

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.703
ANY BACKUP REINFORCEMENTS, THAT 
IS 

01:20:46.802 --> 01:20:49.077
THE LATEST REPORT FROM OUR 
REPORTER WHO HAS HEARD FROM A 

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.300
PERSON FAMILIAR WITH TRUMP'S 
LEGAL TEAM ON WHAT THEIR 

01:20:51.345 --> 01:20:53.345
RESPONSE WOULD BE TO POTENTIAL 
WITNESSES 

01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:58.084
GETTING CALLED. THANK YOU AND 
AARON BLAKE I REMEMBER IN REAL 

01:20:58.319 --> 01:21:01.422
TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR OF 
VIRGINIA SAYING HE WAS GETTING 

01:21:01.652 --> 01:21:03.652
CALLS FROM DEMOCRATIC 

01:21:06.432 --> 01:21:08.481
HOUSE LEADERSHIP, AND IT WAS 
NANCY PELOSI, IMAGINE GETTING A 

01:21:08.718 --> 01:21:10.978
CALL FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE 
HOUSE BECAUSE PEOPLE INSIDE THE 

01:21:11.204 --> 01:21:13.374
CAPITOL COMPLEX WERE URGENTLY 
TRIED TO SCRAMBLE TO FIGURE OUT 

01:21:13.598 --> 01:21:15.598
HOW TO GET SOME SORT OF NATIONAL
MOBILIZE AND 

01:21:20.487 --> 01:21:22.641
MILITARIZE HELP.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS AMAZING IT IS 

01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:25.633
CHARACTERIZED AS A THREAT FROM 
TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM TO CALL NANCY

01:21:27.711 --> 01:21:31.567
PELOSI AND CALL MURIEL BOWSER, 
JUST TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT 

01:21:31.798 --> 01:21:35.600
HAPPENED THAT DAY. THEY HAVE 
BEEN MAKING THESE KINDS OF 

01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:39.522
THREATS FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW. 
LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS BEEN DOING 

01:21:39.749 --> 01:21:43.989
THIS ON FOX NEWS AT NIGHT 
CALLING PEOPLE WITH INFLUENCE ON

01:21:44.355 --> 01:21:49.409
THE WHOLE PROCESS, YOU KNOW 
BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY 

01:21:49.644 --> 01:21:52.123
CLINTON, THERE WAS A TIME HE WAS
TALKING TO SEAN HANNITY 

01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:57.831
ABOUT THAT. THE IDEA THAT WE 
WOULD NOT WANT TO LEARN MORE 

01:21:58.052 --> 01:22:00.052
ABOUT THE SITUATION FROM 
WITNESSES LIKE THAT IS A 

01:22:00.066 --> 01:22:02.066
COMMENTARY ON THIS PROCESS. 

01:22:05.169 --> 01:22:07.339
MURIEL BOWSER AND NANCY PELOSI, 
WHEN THEY ASKED FOR NATIONAL 

01:22:07.817 --> 01:22:09.817
GUARD HELP, MAY NOT BE AN 
IMPORTANT QUESTION AROUND 

01:22:14.677 --> 01:22:17.073
INCITEMENT HERE BUT LEARNING 
ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THINGS, 

01:22:17.312 --> 01:22:19.312
AND MAYBE GETTING CLUES FROM THE
CAPITAL POLICE, 

01:22:23.129 --> 01:22:24.927
FROM DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 
OFFICIALS AND THE FORMER DEFENSE

01:22:24.928 --> 01:22:27.122
SECRETARY, ABOUT HOW THIS 
PROCESS PLAYED OUT ON JANUARY 6 

01:22:27.346 --> 01:22:31.171
AND THE DAYS BEFORE IT WOULD BE 
VALUABLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

01:22:31.401 --> 01:22:33.900
YOUNG EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. I 
THINK IT IS ODD THESE THINGS ARE

01:22:34.124 --> 01:22:37.468
BEING HELD OUT THERE IS A 
THREAT. IT ALSO PUTS PRESSURE ON

01:22:38.712 --> 01:22:42.237
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE NOW IF THEY DO
NOT CALL WITNESSES LOOKS LIKE 

01:22:42.461 --> 01:22:45.908
THEY WILL HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
THREATENED BY THEIR TRUMP LEGAL 

01:22:46.136 --> 01:22:52.306
TEAM. CERTAINLY NOT A GREAT 
SITUATION FOR THEM AS THEY 

01:22:52.529 --> 01:22:55.748
CONFRONT A KEY DECISION TODAY ON
CALLING WITNESSES.

01:22:55.749 --> 01:22:58.991
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLVIN, OUR COLLEAGUE 
MIKE DEBONIS IS 

01:23:03.666 --> 01:23:06.189
THERE TODAY, SAYING A LOT OF US 
OCCURS ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH 

01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:09.542
THE VICE PRESIDENT SOCIAL 
QUESTIONS UNANSWERED AND WENT 

01:23:09.768 --> 01:23:13.518
ASKED ABOUT WITNESSES SHE SAID I
WILL LISTEN FOR ANY ARGUMENT, 

01:23:13.741 --> 01:23:15.776
NOT ADVOCATING FOR IT BUT 
WILLING TO LISTEN AND ENTERTAIN 

01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:18.001
THE 

01:23:20.015 --> 01:23:22.190
CONVERSATION, RHONDA. WHAT DO 
THESE SENATORS DO IF THEY STILL 

01:23:22.409 --> 01:23:26.190
HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AT 
THIS MOMENT?

01:23:26.191 --> 01:23:28.942
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY COULD VOTE FOR WITNESSES
IF THEY FEEL IT WOULD GET THEM 

01:23:29.168 --> 01:23:32.521
SOME ANSWERS. BUT THE POINT THAT
MURKOWSKI IS STILL BRINGING UP, 

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.209
IT RAISES AN INTERESTING POINT, 
THE TIME THE IMPEACHMENT 

01:23:38.432 --> 01:23:42.100
MANAGERS SPENT ON THE DANGER 
MIKE PENCE WAS IN AND SHOWING 

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:45.710
THE VIDEO THAT HAD NOT BEEN SEEN
BEFORE, LOOKING AT THE TRUMP 

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:48.670
TIMELINE OF WHEN HE KNEW MIKE 
PENCE WAS IN TROUBLE AND WHEN HE

01:23:48.894 --> 01:23:50.894
EVENTUALLY SENT OUT THE 

01:23:54.119 --> 01:23:58.898
VIDEO TWEET, THAT SEEMS TO BE 
THE MOST CONCERNING ISSUE RIGHT 

01:23:59.123 --> 01:24:01.417
NOW OUT OF ALL THE ISSUES THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SPENT TWO 

01:24:01.638 --> 01:24:04.742
DAYS ON. THEY BROUGHT UP HOW IT 
MAKES US LOOK ON THE WORLD STAGE

01:24:04.971 --> 01:24:07.713
AND THE COST IT HAS TAKEN TO 
FORTIFY THE CAPITAL AS WELL AS 

01:24:07.941 --> 01:24:09.941
OTHER UNITED STATES 

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:15.655
STATE CAPITALS. THEY HAVE DONE 
SO MUCH OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS 

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:21.834
BUT WHAT STICKS IN PEOPLE'S 
MINDS IS THE ISSUE WITH PINS. IT

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:25.537
APPEARS TRUMP ABANDONED HIS VICE
PRESIDENT AND PUTTING THE 

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:30.252
CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND 
DANGER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

01:24:30.475 --> 01:24:34.275
SENATE, CHUCK GRASSLEY AND NANCY
PELOSI ALL IN LINE FOR THE 

01:24:34.495 --> 01:24:36.495
PRESIDENCY IS SOMETHING WERE TO 
HAPPEN, THEY WERE ALSO 

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:42.158
IN DANGER. AND THEY SPENT A LOT 
OF WEDNESDAY TALK ABOUT THE FACT

01:24:42.384 --> 01:24:44.384
THAT THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
WERE USING MIKE PENCE 

01:24:48.742 --> 01:24:52.999
A LOT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW 
THIS TRIAL PLAYED OUT AND HOW IT

01:24:53.232 --> 01:24:55.485
WAS ARGUED THAT WAS A CRITICAL 
PART OF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

01:24:55.718 --> 01:24:57.300
ARGUMENT THAT SEEM TO WORK AMONG
THE REPUBLICANS.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:25:01.596
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AARON BLAKE YOU HAVE BEEN 
FOCUSED ON THE WRITING OF THE 

01:25:01.825 --> 01:25:04.245
TIMELINE OF THE SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN. DO YOU 

01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:07.851
ANTICIPATE WE WILL GET MORE 
CLARITY ON THAT TODAY? 

01:25:10.433 --> 01:25:14.359
NOT IF THERE ARE WITNESSES 
CALLED AND THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM 

01:25:14.581 --> 01:25:19.565
HASN'T BEEN WILLING TO EXPOUND 
MUCH ON THAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS 

01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:21.786
INTERESTING YESTERDAY THAT TO 
THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE 

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.950
LAWMAKERS ASKING 

01:25:26.717 --> 01:25:29.384
SINCERE QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO 
GET MORE INFORMATION THEY'RE 

01:25:29.613 --> 01:25:31.758
COMING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE 
ROAD SENATORS OPEN FOR 

01:25:35.185 --> 01:25:37.229
CONVICTION AND LISA MURKOWSKI 
AND SUSAN COLLINS ASKED A LOT 

01:25:37.453 --> 01:25:40.852
ABOUT WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW 
THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DANGER 

01:25:41.222 --> 01:25:43.395
TO LAWMAKERS AND MICHAEL VANDER 
WIEN RESPONDED THAT HE TWEETED 

01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:51.718
AT 2:38 BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE 
INVESTIGATION. WHILE YOU CAN 

01:25:51.948 --> 01:25:54.441
TALK TO THE CLIENT ABOUT THESE 
THINGS, THE TIMELINE IS A VERY 

01:25:54.667 --> 01:25:56.703
BASIC THING TO GO OVER THE 
MOMENT YOU TAKE UP 

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:02.589
A CLIENT. AND THEN OF COURSE WE 
HAD MET ROMNEY ASKING ABOUT 

01:26:02.807 --> 01:26:04.890
WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT 
KNEW THAT VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 

01:26:05.113 --> 01:26:08.732
PENCE WAS IN DANGER WHEN HE 
TWEETED WHAT HE DID AT 2:2 4 PM 

01:26:08.958 --> 01:26:10.958
AND AT 

01:26:13.103 --> 01:26:15.732
THIS POINT VANDER WIEN HAD AN 
ANSWER SAY NO THE PRESIDENT DID 

01:26:15.964 --> 01:26:20.057
NOT KNOW. SO HOW DO YOU KNOW 
THAT HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT VICE 

01:26:20.289 --> 01:26:22.843
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE'S PERIL 
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE CAN 

01:26:23.063 --> 01:26:26.730
DEPRECIATE A SITUATION IN THE 
CAPITAL. ALL THESE THINGS THAT 

01:26:26.953 --> 01:26:31.831
COULD BE SHED LIGHT UPON, IF YOU
CALL WITNESSES, BUT WITHOUT THAT

01:26:32.094 --> 01:26:37.137
IT WOULD JUST BE AN AMORPHOUS 
BLOB WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT. 

01:26:37.376 --> 01:26:41.174
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE 
ARE SEEING SENATORS LIKE SHELDON

01:26:41.394 --> 01:26:45.121
WHITEHOUSE AND  JEFF MERKLEY 
LANE MORE THEIR COLLEAGUES TO 

01:26:46.662 --> 01:26:49.187
CALL WITNESSES AS WE ARE NOT 
GOING TO FIND THAT STUFF OUT 

01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:53.127
TODAY UNLESS WE HAVE SOME 
WITNESSES CALLED. AND OF COURSE 

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.649
THEY DO NOT WANT TO DRAG OUT THE
PROCESS GIVEN THE OUTCOME. 

01:26:57.650 --> 01:26:59.650
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS FILTERING INTO 

01:27:01.619 --> 01:27:04.312
THE CHAMBER. JAMES HOME AND IF 
PEOPLE JUST JOINED THIS LAST FEW

01:27:04.548 --> 01:27:06.747
MINUTES THAT'S JUMP OFF THE 
POINT, THE VERY IMPORTANT POINT,

01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:09.033
THAT THE BIG QUESTION THAT A LOT

01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:15.467
OF MODERATES WHO MAY BE OPEN TO 
CONVICTION HAVE IS THE TIMELINE 

01:27:15.698 --> 01:27:17.763
AROUND WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH, AND 

01:27:17.989 --> 01:27:21.299
THE HOURS AFTER THE ATTACK WAS 
UNFOLDING LIVE ON NATIONAL 

01:27:23.058 --> 01:27:25.250
BROADCAST, AND WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF DEMANDING 

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500
THE 

01:27:30.313 --> 01:27:34.286
RIOTERS STOP, INSTEAD OF CLEARLY
SENDING IN NATIONAL MILITARIZE 

01:27:34.536 --> 01:27:37.356
HELP, WAS TWEETING DISPARAGING 
COMMENTS ABOUT MIKE PENCE. SO WE

01:27:38.168 --> 01:27:40.168
HEARD TRUMPS LAWYER 

01:27:43.661 --> 01:27:46.269
YESTERDAY SAY HE DID NOT KNOW 
THAT MIKE PENCE WAS IN DANGER 

01:27:46.496 --> 01:27:48.953
BUT IT DOESN'T SQUARE WITH ALL 
OF THE REPORTING IN THE TIMELINE

01:27:49.178 --> 01:27:51.389
WHICH HAS BEEN LAID OUT, 
INCLUDING BY OTHER SENATORS WHO 

01:27:51.605 --> 01:27:57.011
TALK TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS AMAZING ABOUT ALL OF 

01:27:57.369 --> 01:27:59.490
THAT, LIBBY, IS MIKE PENCE 
CONTINUE TO BE LOYAL TO 

01:27:59.717 --> 01:28:04.223
PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGH THIS AND
MIKE PENCE'S TEAM TOLD OUR 

01:28:04.455 --> 01:28:08.511
COLLEAGUES THAT THE TRUMP LAWYER
WAS LYING, THAT TRUMP DID KNOW 

01:28:08.726 --> 01:28:11.663
AND HE DID NOT CARE AND DID NOT 
DO ANYTHING, THAT HE DID NOT 

01:28:11.884 --> 01:28:17.071
CHECK ON MIKE PENCE. THE ONLY 
TIME THAT TRUMP ENDED UP FINDING

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:20.539
OUT MIKE PENCE WAS OKAY IS WHEN 
MARK SHORT, MIKE PENCE CHIEF OF 

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.760
STAFF, WHO CALLED MARK MEADOWS, 
TRUMPS CHIEF 

01:28:25.854 --> 01:28:28.959
OF STAFF, TO SAY THEY WERE SAFE 
AND THIS IS AN HOUR AFTER WHAT 

01:28:29.179 --> 01:28:31.179
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. TRUMP 
NEVER INQUIRED. 

01:28:35.367 --> 01:28:39.076
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT A LOT OF 
THESE SENATORS KNOW THIS TO BE 

01:28:39.299 --> 01:28:42.186
TRUE, THEY KNOW MIKE PENCE THAT 
HE USED TO BE IN CONGRESS FOR A 

01:28:42.403 --> 01:28:44.403
DECADE, AND SO THEY ARE STILL 
GOING TO VOTE 

01:28:47.701 --> 01:28:50.284
TO ACQUIT. BUT THESE PEOPLE ON 
THE MARGIN WHO ARE TAKING THIS 

01:28:50.504 --> 01:28:52.820
SERIOUSLY, THEY HAVE ALL TAKEN 
OATHS TO RENDER IMPARTIAL 

01:28:53.039 --> 01:28:55.718
JUSTICE AND THIS IS THE DECISIVE
THING BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO 

01:28:55.944 --> 01:28:57.944
TRUMPS STATE 

01:28:59.782 --> 01:29:02.112
OF MIND. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
THE LEGAL STANDARD AND THE 

01:29:02.332 --> 01:29:06.788
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD FOR 
INCITING AN INSURRECTION. IF 

01:29:07.005 --> 01:29:13.750
TRUMP DID NOT CARE THAT HIS 
NUMBER TWO WAS IN GRAVE JEOPARDY

01:29:13.962 --> 01:29:18.539
AND TRUMP DID NOT WANT TO DO 
ANYTHING TO STOP IT, IT DOES 

01:29:18.788 --> 01:29:22.960
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE WAS TRYING,
OR CERTAINLY AT THE VERY LEAST, 

01:29:23.184 --> 01:29:27.852
HAPPY WITH HIS SUPPORTERS WHO HE
HAD JUST SPOKEN TO ONE HOUR 

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:32.930
EARLIER BREACHING THE CAPITAL IS
USING THE SENATE CHAMBER.

01:29:53.961 --> 01:29:57.465
TO CALL WITNESSES, THE SENATE 
COULD DEBATE AND VOTE ON THAT, 

01:29:57.871 --> 01:30:00.898
BUT WE WILL SEE IF ANYONE EVEN 
BRINGS THAT UP, WE ARE HEARING 

01:30:01.043 --> 01:30:03.073
FROM SOME DEMOCRATS ON THE 
SENATE

01:30:08.898 --> 01:30:10.957
SAY THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
WITNESSES BUT WHETHER THAT WOULD

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.160
CULMINATE IN A DISCUSSION AND 
DEBATE ON THE FLOOR TODAY, 

01:30:13.235 --> 01:30:18.946
REMAINS TO BE SEEN, AND THEN AT 
THAT POINT WE CAN MOVE INTO THE 

01:30:19.148 --> 01:30:21.148
CLOSING ARGUMENTS AFTER OTHER 
PROCEDURAL THINGS.

01:30:25.473 --> 01:30:28.153
JUST IN THE MOMENT WE HAVE HERE 
AS WE PREPARE FOR THE SENATE TO 

01:30:28.355 --> 01:30:30.613
CONVENE, THIS COULD WRAP UP 
TODAY, WE COULD SEE A FINAL VOTE

01:30:30.815 --> 01:30:32.483
TODAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT VERY WELL COULD WRAP UP 

01:30:32.484 --> 01:30:34.626
TODAY, AND THAT IS FAR DIFFERENT
THAN LAST TIME.

01:30:40.294 --> 01:30:42.294
RELATED CLOSING ARGUMENTS, IF 
YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS THE STATE

01:30:42.339 --> 01:30:44.410
OF THE UNION ADDRESS THAT 
EVENING AND THEN THE NEXT DAY 

01:30:44.613 --> 01:30:47.283
THEY CAME IN AND VOTED -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL HOLD OFF NOW, I WANT 

01:30:47.499 --> 01:30:49.563
TO THANK RHONDA, JAMES, ERIN, 
SENATOR LEAHY IS THERE AND WE 

01:30:49.766 --> 01:30:53.041
CAN SEE CHAPLAIN BARRY LACK 
STARTING UP, HE'S BEEN STARTING 

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:55.239
WITH A PUT

01:30:59.196 --> 01:31:01.485
PRAYER THAT HAS BEEN A MESSAGE 
TO SENATORS AS THEY BEGAN TO 

01:31:01.701 --> 01:31:02.955
START THE DAY. LET'S WATCH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

01:31:02.956 --> 01:31:10.131
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET US PRAY. OH LORD, OUR GOD
. YESTERDAY THIS CHAMBER 

01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:17.268
REVERBERATED TO A STANDING 
OVATION FOR THE COURAGE OF 

01:31:18.232 --> 01:31:24.815
OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN IN 
DEFENDING THIS BUILDING AND 

01:31:25.579 --> 01:31:33.349
HUMAN LIFE. MAY OUR LEGISLATIVE 
JURORS STRIVE TO EMULATE HIS 

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:41.580
COURAGE IN THEIR DEFENSE OF THE 
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. 

01:31:42.001 --> 01:31:49.419
LORD, TOUCH AND MOVE THEM TO 
BELIEVE THAT THE AND DOES NOT 

01:31:49.839 --> 01:31:56.202
JUSTIFY THE MEANS. HELP THEM TO 
REMEMBER THAT THE END 

01:31:57.298 --> 01:32:04.368
INHERENT AND BUILT IN TO THE 
MEANS. FILL OUR SENATORS WITH 

01:32:05.129 --> 01:32:12.914
THE SPIRIT THAT COMBINES COMMON 
SENSE WITH COMMITMENT, 

01:32:13.055 --> 01:32:22.106
CONSCIENCE, AND COURAGE. WE PRAY
IN YOUR MERCIFUL NAME, AMEN.

01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.167
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PLEASE JOIN ME IN RECITING 
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

01:32:39.091 --> 01:32:40.717
ONE NATION UNDER GOD, 
INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND 

01:32:40.718 --> 01:32:43.753
JUSTICE FOR ALL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:32:56.346 --> 01:32:58.346
SENATORS, PLEASE BE SEATED.

01:33:03.752 --> 01:33:08.658
IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION, THE 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE 

01:33:08.859 --> 01:33:10.859
TRIAL ARE PROVED TO DATE, AND

01:33:14.223 --> 01:33:16.320
I ASKED THE SERGEANT AT ARMS TO 
MAKE THE PROCLAMATION. 

01:33:16.321 --> 01:33:18.321
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEAR YE,

01:33:21.047 --> 01:33:23.047
ALL PERSONS ARE COMMANDED TO 
KEEP SILENCE ON PAIN OF 

01:33:23.079 --> 01:33:28.371
IMPRISONMENT WHILE THE SCENTED 
OF THE UNITED STATES IS SITTING 

01:33:28.587 --> 01:33:30.652
FOR THE TRIAL OF THE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED BY THE 

01:33:30.857 --> 01:33:32.670
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AGAINST
DONALD DRAW JOHN TRUMP FORMER 

01:33:32.671 --> 01:33:38.894
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE HAS PROVIDED

01:33:44.562 --> 01:33:46.854
UP TO TWO HOURS OF ARGUMENT BY 
THE PARTIES EQUALLY DIVIDED. ON 

01:33:47.049 --> 01:33:50.553
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT 
IT SHALL BE IN ORDER TO CONSIDER

01:33:50.766 --> 01:33:54.661
AND DEBATE UNDER THE IMPEACHMENT
RULES, AND EMOTION TO SUBPOENA 

01:33:54.863 --> 01:34:00.126
WITNESSES OR DOCUMENTS. ARE BOTH
PARTIES READY TO PROCEED AT THIS

01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.273
POINT?

01:34:13.723 --> 01:34:16.338
THEY MAY PROCEED.

01:34:27.034 --> 01:34:29.092
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT, GOOD
MORNING, SENATORS, OVER THE LAST

01:34:29.305 --> 01:34:30.921
SEVERAL DAYS WE PRESENTED 
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT 

01:34:30.922 --> 01:34:35.049
ESTABLISHES THE CHARGES IN THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT. WE'VE 

01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:39.980
SHOWN YOU HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CREATED A POWDER CAKE, LIT A 

01:34:40.185 --> 01:34:44.756
MATCH AND CONTINUED HIS 
INCITEMENT EVEN AS HE FAILED TO 

01:34:44.955 --> 01:34:46.799
DEFEND US FROM THE ENSUING 
VIOLENCE. WE'VE SUPPORTED ARE 

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.092
SOME POSITION WITH IMAGES, 
DOCUMENTS, TWEETS AND OTHER 

01:34:51.308 --> 01:34:53.308
EVIDENCE LEAVING NO DOUBT

01:34:56.017 --> 01:34:58.118
THAT THE SENATE SHOULD CONVICT. 
WE BELIEVE WE HAVE PROVEN OUR 

01:34:58.319 --> 01:35:00.792
CASE. BUT LAST NIGHT, 
CONGRESSMAN JAMIE HERRERA ISSUED

01:35:01.549 --> 01:35:03.549
A STATEMENT

01:35:06.548 --> 01:35:08.548
CONFIRMING THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE INSURRECTION, WHEN HOUSE 

01:35:08.579 --> 01:35:10.579
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY

01:35:16.857 --> 01:35:18.857
CALLED THE PRESIDENT TO BEG FOR 
HELP, PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED 

01:35:18.941 --> 01:35:21.029
AND I QUOTE, WELL, KEVIN, I 
GUESS THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE 

01:35:21.244 --> 01:35:24.210
UPSET ABOUT THE ELECTION THEN 
YOU ARE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS 

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:31.685
IS AN ADDITIONAL CRITICAL PIECE 
OF EVIDENCE FURTHER CONFIRMING 

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:35.401
THE CHARGES BEFORE YOU AS WELL 
AS THE PRESIDENT WILLFUL 

01:35:35.805 --> 01:35:38.028
DERELICTION OF DUTY AND 
DESERTION OF DUTY AS COMMANDER 

01:35:38.168 --> 01:35:40.168
OF

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:47.200
CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES, HIS 
STATE OF MIND AND HAS FURTHER 

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400
INCITEMENT OF THE INSURRECTION 
ON JANUARY 6. FOR THAT REASON 

01:35:49.501 --> 01:35:51.785
AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE PROPER 
TIME TO DO SO, UNDER THE 

01:35:51.988 --> 01:35:54.247
RESOLUTION THE SENATE ADOPTED TO
SET THE RULES FOR THE TRIAL, WE 

01:35:54.462 --> 01:35:56.462
WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SUBPOENA

01:36:00.194 --> 01:36:01.644
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA REGARDING 
HER COMMUNICATIONS WITH HOUSE 

01:36:01.645 --> 01:36:04.063
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY, 
AND TO SUBPOENA HER NOTES THAT 

01:36:04.199 --> 01:36:09.494
SHE MADE REGARDING WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD KEVIN 

01:36:09.698 --> 01:36:12.101
McCARTHY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
INSURRECTION. WE WOULD BE 

01:36:12.241 --> 01:36:15.658
PREPARED TO PROCEED BY ZOOM 
DEPOSITION OF AN HOUR OR LESS, 

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:21.441
JUST AS SOON AS CONGRESSMAN 
HERRERA BUTLER IS AVAILABLE TO 

01:36:21.641 --> 01:36:23.998
PROCEED TO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE
TRIAL INCLUDING THE

01:36:29.037 --> 01:36:30.497
INTRODUCTION OF THAT TESTIMONY 
SO SHORTLY THEREAFTER, 

01:36:30.498 --> 01:36:32.173
CONGRESSMAN BUTLER FURTHER 
STATED THAT SHE HOPES OTHER 

01:36:32.174 --> 01:36:36.277
WITNESSES TO THIS PART OF THE 
STORY, OTHER PATRIOTS AS SHE PUT

01:36:36.478 --> 01:36:41.210
IT, WOULD COME FORWARD AND IF 
THAT HAPPENS, WE WOULD SEEK THE 

01:36:41.412 --> 01:36:43.267
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THEIR 
DEPOSITIONS VIA ZOOM, ALSO FOR 

01:36:43.268 --> 01:36:45.150
LESS THAN AN HOUR, OR TO 
SUBPOENA OTHER RELEVANT 

01:36:45.151 --> 01:36:47.151
DOCUMENTS AS WELL.

01:36:54.075 --> 01:36:56.498
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, GOOD MORNING, AND 
GOOD MORNING TO THE AMERICAN 

01:36:56.637 --> 01:36:58.637
PEOPLE.

01:37:01.541 --> 01:37:04.256
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY ON
THE ISSUE OF WITNESSES, IS, THAT

01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:06.518
THE HOUSE MANAGER JUST GOT UP 
HERE AND DESCRIBED THE ARTICLES 

01:37:07.295 --> 01:37:14.296
OF IMPEACHMENT AND THE CHARGES, 
THERE IS NO PLURAL HERE, THAT'S 

01:37:14.469 --> 01:37:18.242
WRONG. THERE'S ONE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT AND THERE'S ONE 

01:37:18.376 --> 01:37:25.356
CHARGE AND THAT HIS INCITEMENT 
OF VIOLENCE AND INSURRECTION

01:37:32.487 --> 01:37:35.179
. WHAT YOU ALL NEED TO KNOW AND 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW

01:37:35.381 --> 01:37:37.259
IS AS OF LATE YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON, THERE WAS A 

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.817
STIPULATION GOING AROUND THAT 
THERE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ANY 

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.884
WITNESSES. BUT, AFTER WHAT 
HAPPENED HERE IN THIS CHAMBER 

01:37:43.885 --> 01:37:47.167
YESTERDAY, THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
REALIZE THEY DID NOT INVESTIGATE

01:37:47.369 --> 01:37:49.369
THIS CASE BEFORE BRINGING THE 
IMPEACHMENT

01:37:54.756 --> 01:37:57.043
, THEY DID NOT GIVE THE PROPER 
CONSIDERATION AND THE WORK, THEY

01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:00.282
DIDN'T PUT THE WORK IN THAT WAS 
NECESSARY TO IMPEACH THE FORMER 

01:38:00.424 --> 01:38:02.424
PRESIDENT

01:38:05.271 --> 01:38:10.604
. BUT, IF THEY WANT TO HAVE 
WITNESSES, I'M GOING TO NEED AT 

01:38:10.744 --> 01:38:18.684
LEAST OVER 100 DEPOSITIONS, NOT 
JUST ONE. THE REAL ISSUE IS 

01:38:18.819 --> 01:38:26.350
INCITEMENT. THEY PUT INTO THEIR 
CASE OVER 100 WITNESSES, PEOPLE,

01:38:26.565 --> 01:38:28.888
WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH 
CRIMES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:36.220
AND EACH ONE OF THOSE, THEY SAID
THAT MR. TRUMP WAS A 

01:38:36.978 --> 01:38:44.424
CO-CONSPIRATOR WITH. THAT'S NOT 
TRUE. BUT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO 

01:38:45.187 --> 01:38:47.187
DEFEND THAT.

01:38:48.962 --> 01:38:51.636
THE ONLY THING THAT I ASK, IS IF
YOU VOTE FOR WITNESSES, DO NOT 

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.916
HANDCUFF ME BY LIMITING THE 
NUMBER OF WITNESSES THAT I CAN 

01:38:57.054 --> 01:39:02.093
HAVE. I NEED TO DO A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION THAT THEY DID NOT 

01:39:02.233 --> 01:39:04.233
DO.

01:39:07.696 --> 01:39:10.161
I NEED TO DO THE 91 ONCE TAL 
INVESTIGATION THAT NANCY PELOSI 

01:39:10.926 --> 01:39:12.926
CALLED FOR.

01:39:17.624 --> 01:39:19.624
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
ALREADY. IT'S A DERELICTION OF 

01:39:19.696 --> 01:39:21.696
THE HOUSE MANAGERS DUTY.

01:39:26.047 --> 01:39:28.047
AND NOW, AT THE LAST MINUTE 
AFTER A STIPULATION HAD 

01:39:28.119 --> 01:39:33.271
APPARENTLY BEEN WORKED OUT, THEY
WANT TO GO BACK ON THAT. I THINK

01:39:33.472 --> 01:39:36.145
THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE AND 
IMPROPER. WE SHOULD CLOSE THIS 

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:42.648
CASE OUT TODAY. WE HAVE EACH 
PREPARED OUR CLOSING ARGUMENTS,

01:39:46.854 --> 01:39:49.508
I HAD EIGHT DAYS TO GET READY 
FOR THIS THING, BUT WE EACH HAD 

01:39:49.718 --> 01:39:54.196
THOSE EIGHT DAYS EQUALLY TO 
PREPARE OURSELVES, AND THE HOUSE

01:39:54.959 --> 01:40:00.336
MANAGERS NEED TO LIVE WITH THE 
CASE THAT THEY BROUGHT. BUT IF 

01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:06.941
THEY DON'T, PLEASE, AND ALL 
FAIRNESS, AND IN ALL DUE PROCESS

01:40:07.286 --> 01:40:09.286
, DO NOT

01:40:11.608 --> 01:40:19.240
LIMIT MY ABILITY TO DISCOVER, 
DISCOVER, DISCOVER THE TRUTH. 

01:40:19.441 --> 01:40:21.441
THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER SHAM

01:40:25.991 --> 01:40:28.139
. AND THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
POSITION, MY POSITION.

01:40:37.372 --> 01:40:43.831
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. RASKIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 

01:40:44.266 --> 01:40:47.772
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS THE PROPER
TIME THAT WE WERE ASSIGNED TO 

01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:49.970
TALK ABOUT WITNESSES, THIS IS 
COMPLETELY WITHIN THE COURSE OF 

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:53.902
THE RULE SET FORTH BY THE 
SENATE, THERE'S NOTHING REMOTELY

01:40:54.119 --> 01:40:59.265
UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS. I THINK 
WE'VE DONE A COMPREHENSIVE JOB 

01:40:59.469 --> 01:41:01.469
WITH ALL OF THE

01:41:06.463 --> 01:41:08.326
EVIDENCE THAT WAS AVAILABLE. 
LAST NIGHT, THIS WAS BREAKING 

01:41:08.327 --> 01:41:10.402
NEWS AND IT RESPONDED DIRECTLY 
TO A QUESTION THAT WAS BEING 

01:41:10.613 --> 01:41:12.613
RAISED BY THE PRESIDENTS DEFENSE
COUNSEL SAYING, WE HAD NOT 

01:41:12.683 --> 01:41:14.683
SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN TO THEIR 
SATISFACTION ALTHOUGH I THINK 

01:41:14.806 --> 01:41:16.806
WE'VE

01:41:18.403 --> 01:41:20.403
PROVEN IT TO THE SATISFACTION OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, CERTAINLY, 

01:41:20.438 --> 01:41:22.808
THAT THE PRESIDENT, AFTER THE 
BREACH AND INVASION TOOK PLACE,

01:41:29.224 --> 01:41:31.487
WAS NOT WORKING ON DEFENDING THE
SIDE OF THE CAPITOL BUT RATHER 

01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:33.571
WAS CONTINUING TO PURSUE HIS 
POLITICAL GOALS, AND THE 

01:41:33.572 --> 01:41:35.572
INFORMATION THAT CAME OUT LAST 
NIGHT BUT  CONGRESS WOMAN 

01:41:35.633 --> 01:41:37.277
BUTLER, BACKED UP BY 
CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES, THAT SHE 

01:41:37.278 --> 01:41:41.971
HAD TAKEN, I THINK WILL PUT TO 
REST ANY LINGERING DOUBTS RAISED

01:41:42.172 --> 01:41:46.456
BY THE PRESIDENTS COUNCIL WHO 
NOW SAYS HE WANTS TO INTERVIEW 

01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:48.524
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, THERE'S ONLY
ONE PERSON THE PRESIDENTS 

01:41:48.525 --> 01:41:51.571
COUNCIL REALLY NEEDS TO 
INTERVIEW AND THAT IS THEIR OWN 

01:41:51.707 --> 01:41:56.336
CLIENT. AND BRING HIM FORWARD AS
WE SUGGESTED LAST WEEK BECAUSE A

01:41:56.552 --> 01:42:01.314
LOT OF THIS ARE MATTERS THAT ARE
IN HIS HEAD, WHY DID HE NOT ACT 

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:03.515
TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY, AFTER HE 
WENT

01:42:10.152 --> 01:42:12.152
OF THE ATTACK. WHY WAS HE 
PRESSING THE POLITICAL CASE? 

01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:14.537
THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE IS 
RELEVANT TO THAT. AND FINALLY,

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.612
I WAS A LITTLE BIT MYSTIFIED BY 
THE POINT ABOUT THE ARTICLE OF 

01:42:21.813 --> 01:42:23.813
IMPEACHMENT, WHICH I REFERRED 
TO, THE

01:42:27.336 --> 01:42:29.336
DERELICTION OF DUTY, AND 
DESERTION OF DUTY IS BUILT INTO 

01:42:29.947 --> 01:42:31.947
THE INCITEMENT

01:42:36.615 --> 01:42:38.615
CHARGE, OBVIOUSLY. THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES IS OUT 

01:42:38.721 --> 01:42:40.721
INCITING A VIOLENT INSURRECTION,
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT DOING HIS JOB

01:42:40.796 --> 01:42:43.253
AT THE SAME TIME, JUST TO GET A 
POLICE OFFICER IS MUGGING YOU, 

01:42:43.454 --> 01:42:49.041
YEAH, HE IS GUILTY OF THEFT AND 
ARMED ROBBERY, WHATEVER IT MIGHT

01:42:49.247 --> 01:42:51.921
BE BUT HE'S ALSO NOT DOING HIS 
JOB AS A POLICE OFFICER, SO IT'S

01:42:52.122 --> 01:42:56.408
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF HIS INTENT 
AND WHAT HIS CONDUCT IS. 

01:42:56.409 --> 01:43:02.093
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF I MAY. FIRST OF ALL IT'S 
MY UNDERSTANDING, IT'S BEEN 

01:43:02.234 --> 01:43:07.894
REPORTED THAT MR. McCARTHY 
DISCLAIMS THE RUMORS THAT HAVE 

01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:10.099
BEEN THE BASIS

01:43:12.845 --> 01:43:14.845
OF THIS MORNING'S ANTICS BUT 
REALLY, THE RUMORS THAT HAVE 

01:43:14.916 --> 01:43:16.916
BEEN THE BASIS OF THIS ENTIRE 
PROCEEDING. THIS ENTIRE 

01:43:17.328 --> 01:43:19.328
PROCEEDINGS IS

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.113
BASED ON RUMORED REPORT, 
INNUENDO. THERE'S NOTHING TO IT 

01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:25.391
AND THEY DIDN'T DO THEIR WORK. 
JUST LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH MR.

01:43:25.607 --> 01:43:27.607
LEE, TWO OR THREE NIGHTS AGO.

01:43:35.081 --> 01:43:37.081
OF SOME SUPPOSED CONVERSATION 
THAT HAPPENED, AND THEY HAD TO 

01:43:37.133 --> 01:43:39.412
WITHDRAW THAT, THEY HAD TO BACK 
OFF OF THAT BECAUSE IT WAS 

01:43:39.612 --> 01:43:44.192
FALSE, IT WAS A FALSE NARRATIVE.
BUT IT IS ONE ARTICLE OF 

01:43:44.393 --> 01:43:46.734
IMPEACHMENT, YEAH, THEY THREW A 
LOT OF STUFF IN IT, IN VIOLATION

01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:49.274
OF RULE 23. RULE 23 SAYS YOU 
CANNOT COMBINE

01:43:54.467 --> 01:43:56.733
COUNTS, IT'S A DEFECT IN THEIR 
ENTIRE CASE, IT'S ONE OF THE 

01:43:56.950 --> 01:44:01.463
FOUR REASONS WHY YOU CAN DEVOTE 
TO ACQUIT IN THIS CASE. 

01:44:01.666 --> 01:44:06.587
JURISDICTION, RULE 23, DUE 
PROCESS, THE FIRST AMENDMENT, 

01:44:06.787 --> 01:44:08.787
THEY ALL APPLY IN THIS CASE.

01:44:16.076 --> 01:44:20.847
LET ME, LET ME, LET ME TAKE MY 
OWN ADVICE AND COOL THE 

01:44:21.051 --> 01:44:23.051
TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM A LITTLE
BIT.

01:44:31.522 --> 01:44:33.358
IT'S ABOUT THE INCITEMENT, IT'S 
NOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS 

01:44:33.359 --> 01:44:35.359
AFTERWARDS, THAT IS THE 
IRRELEVANT STUFF, THAT'S THE 

01:44:35.777 --> 01:44:37.777
IRRELEVANT STUFF,

01:44:39.516 --> 01:44:41.575
IT'S NOT THE THINGS THAT WERE 
SAID FROM THE ELECTION TO 

01:44:41.793 --> 01:44:44.760
JANUARY 6, IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO 
THE LEGAL ANALYSIS.

01:44:48.765 --> 01:44:51.022
THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THIS 
BODY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT 

01:44:51.225 --> 01:44:53.225
HAPPENED AFTER THE

01:44:57.596 --> 01:44:59.278
INSURGENTS INTO THE CAPITOL 
BUILDING, BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T 

01:44:59.279 --> 01:45:04.020
HAVE TO DO WITH INCITEMENT . 
INCITEMENT, IT'S A POINT IN 

01:45:04.793 --> 01:45:09.981
TIME, FOLKS. IT'S A POINT IN 
TIME, WHEN THE WORDS ARE SPOKEN 

01:45:10.195 --> 01:45:15.212
AND THE WORDS SAY, IMPLICITLY 
SAY, EXPLICITLY SAY

01:45:20.671 --> 01:45:25.646
, COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR 
LAWLESSNESS. AND WE DON'T HAVE 

01:45:25.846 --> 01:45:30.043
THAT HERE. SO. FOR THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS TO SAVE WE MEET

01:45:33.459 --> 01:45:35.301
TO HAVE POSITIONS ABOUT THE 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED AFTER, 

01:45:35.302 --> 01:45:38.066
THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE. 
BUT,

01:45:43.756 --> 01:45:46.263
THAT, IF HE DOES, THERE ARE A 
LOT OF DEPOSITIONS THAT NEED TO 

01:45:46.465 --> 01:45:48.465
BE HAPPENING, NANCY PELOSI'S 
DEPOSITION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN, 

01:45:48.545 --> 01:45:51.444
VICE PRESIDENT HARASSES 
DEPOSITION, ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO 

01:45:52.206 --> 01:45:58.630
BE TAKEN, AND NOT BY ZOOM. NONE 
OF THESE DEPOSITIONS SHOULD BE 

01:45:58.830 --> 01:46:01.598
DONE BY ZOOM. WE DIDN'T DO THIS 
HEARING BY ZOOM

01:46:07.436 --> 01:46:11.458
. THESE DEPOSITIONS SHOULD BE 
DONE IN PERSON, IN MY OFFICE, IN

01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:13.591
PHILADELPHIA

01:46:15.989 --> 01:46:17.989
.

01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:27.532
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CIVIL 
LAWYERS ARE HERE BUT THAT'S THE 

01:46:27.731 --> 01:46:29.731
WAY IT WORKS, FOLKS. WHEN YOU 
WANT SOMEBODY'S DEPOSITION, YOU 

01:46:29.775 --> 01:46:33.482
SEND A NOTICE OF DEPOSITION, AND
THEY APPEAR AT THE PLACE WHERE 

01:46:33.686 --> 01:46:35.773
THE NOTICE SAYS, THAT CIVIL 
PROCESS! I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU 

01:46:36.532 --> 01:46:41.106
ARE LAUGHING. IT IS CIVIL 
PROCESS, THAT'S THE WAY LAWYERS 

01:46:41.306 --> 01:46:43.464
DO IT. WE SEND NOTICES OF 
DEPOSITION -- 

01:46:43.465 --> 01:46:50.877
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD REMIND EVERYBODY THAT
WE WILL HAVE ORDER IN 

01:46:51.764 --> 01:46:53.764
CHAMBER

01:46:55.203 --> 01:46:57.203
DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS.

01:47:02.432 --> 01:47:04.493
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVEN'T LAUGHED AT ANY OF 
YOU, AND THERE'S NOTHING 

01:47:05.256 --> 01:47:07.256
LAUGHABLE HERE.

01:47:16.166 --> 01:47:18.597
HE MENTIONED MY CLIENT COMING IN
TO TESTIFY. THAT IS NOT THE WAY 

01:47:18.811 --> 01:47:21.069
IT'S DONE. IF HE WANTED TO TALK 
TO DONALD TRUMP, YOU SHOULD'VE 

01:47:21.285 --> 01:47:23.547
PUT A SUBPOENA DOWN, LIKE I'M 
GOING TO SLAP SUBPOENAS ON A 

01:47:23.762 --> 01:47:25.762
GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE IF 
WITNESSES ARE WHAT IS REQUIRED 

01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:28.745
FOR THEM TO TRY TO GET THEIR 
CASE BACK IN ORDER. WHICH HAS 

01:47:28.948 --> 01:47:32.202
FAILED MISERABLY, FOR FOUR 
REASONS. THERE IS NO 

01:47:32.405 --> 01:47:39.026
JURISDICTION HERE, THERE HAS 
BEEN NO DUE PROCESS HERE, THEY 

01:47:39.238 --> 01:47:41.238
HAVE COMPLETELY VIOLATED AND 
IGNORED AND STEP ON

01:47:47.433 --> 01:47:49.433
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. THEY HAVE TRAMPLED ON 

01:47:49.466 --> 01:47:55.639
IT, LIKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO 
RESPECT FOR IT. AND IF THIS IS 

01:47:55.851 --> 01:47:58.087
ABOUT NOTHING ELSE, IT HAS TO BE
ABOUT THE RESPECT OF OUR 

01:47:58.291 --> 01:48:01.076
COUNTRY, OUR CONSTITUTION AND 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT 

01:48:01.215 --> 01:48:03.215
UP

01:48:07.517 --> 01:48:09.668
. SO I ASK, WHEN CONSIDERING 
VOTING ON THIS

01:48:14.748 --> 01:48:17.414
WITNESS MATTER, AND TO BE CLEAR,
THIS MAY BE THE TIME TO DO IT, 

01:48:17.616 --> 01:48:19.616
BUT AGAIN, AND EVERYBODY NEEDS 
TO KNOW, THE BACKROOM POLITICS 

01:48:20.210 --> 01:48:22.412
I'M NOT TOO ADEPT AT IT, NEITHER

01:48:26.001 --> 01:48:28.884
. BUT THERE WAS A STIPULATION, 
THEY FELT VERY COMFORTABLE AFTER

01:48:29.649 --> 01:48:31.649
DAY TO

01:48:33.171 --> 01:48:35.298
, UNTIL THEIR CASE WAS TESTED ON
DAY THREE

01:48:45.245 --> 01:48:48.145
. NOW IS THE TIME TO END THIS. 
NOW IS THE TIME TO HEAR THE 

01:48:48.347 --> 01:48:50.656
CLOSING ARGUMENTS. NOW IS THE 
TIME TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE. 

01:48:51.431 --> 01:48:53.431
THANK YOU.

01:49:00.486 --> 01:49:02.336
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. RASKIN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: WE WERE INVOLVED IN

01:49:02.337 --> 01:49:04.990
NO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE 
STIPULATION. AND I HAVE NO 

01:49:05.752 --> 01:49:07.752
FURTHER COMMENT.

01:49:16.971 --> 01:49:18.971
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

01:49:22.545 --> 01:49:27.559
I WOULD REMIND, I WOULD REMIND 
EVERYBODY

01:49:32.429 --> 01:49:34.559
AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS NOTED 
ON JANUARY 21, 2020,

01:49:43.886 --> 01:49:45.933
CITING THE TRIAL OF CHARLES 
SWAIN IN 1905, ALL PARTIES OF 

01:49:46.135 --> 01:49:48.135
THIS CHAMBER MUST REFRAIN FROM 
USING LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT 

01:49:48.170 --> 01:49:50.170
CONDUCIVE TO CIVIL DISCOURSE.

01:49:56.368 --> 01:49:58.425
I LISTENED TO CHIEF JUSTICE 
ROBERTS SAY THAT, I AGREED WITH 

01:49:58.629 --> 01:50:02.135
HIM, AND I THOUGHT FOR OUR 
COLLEAGUES, I WOULD REPEAT IT, 

01:50:02.339 --> 01:50:04.339
AS I DID LAST NIGHT.

01:50:25.026 --> 01:50:27.796
SO THE QUESTION WE HAVE BEFORE 
US IS WHETHER WE SHOULD BE

01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:34.390
, AND THE RULES OF IMPEACHMENT, 
AND EMOTION TO SUBPOENA 

01:50:34.445 --> 01:50:36.445
WITNESSES OR DOCUMENTS.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:48.658
IS THERE A SUFFICIENT SECOND, IT
APPEARS THERE IS. THE CLERK WILL

01:50:48.874 --> 01:50:50.874
CALL THE ROLE.

01:50:59.738 --> 01:51:01.738
[ ROLL CALL ] 

01:57:26.836 --> 01:57:28.836
SENATORS VOTING IN THE 
AFFIRMATIVE,

01:58:31.063 --> 01:58:33.460
SENATORS VOTING IN THE NEGATIVE.

01:59:13.182 --> 01:59:15.182
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT?

01:59:20.414 --> 01:59:22.522
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: I WOULD LIKE TO 
CHANGE MY VOTE

01:59:26.567 --> 01:59:28.567
TO AYE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. GRAHAM, MR. GRAHAM, AYE. 

01:59:31.089 --> 01:59:33.089
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT

01:59:38.226 --> 01:59:40.468
? HE MET MR. SULLIVAN? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JUST A POINT OF INQUIRY, THE 

01:59:40.685 --> 01:59:43.123
CONFUSION HERE WAS THAT A VOTE 
ON ONE WITNESS OR MANY WITNESSES

01:59:43.339 --> 01:59:47.499
THAT MEGA DEBATE IS NOT ALLOWED,
THE SENATOR FROM ALASKA.

01:59:51.163 --> 01:59:53.163
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT IT'S UP

01:59:57.746 --> 01:59:59.838
POINT OF INQUIRY AS TO WHAT WE 
JUST VOTED ON. 

01:59:59.839 --> 02:00:02.397
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD ADVISE THAT IS NOT 
ALLOWED DURING THE VOTE.

02:00:37.313 --> 02:00:41.573
THE POINTS OF ORDER AND DEBATE 
ARE NOT ALLOWED DURING THE VOTE,

02:00:41.719 --> 02:00:45.786
THAT IS ESTABLISHED SENATE 
PROCEDURE AND WE ALWAYS FOLLOW 

02:00:45.921 --> 02:00:47.921
IT.

02:03:24.528 --> 02:03:29.723
ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT 
SHALL BE AN ORDER TO CONSIDER 

02:03:29.926 --> 02:03:32.736
DEBATE UNDER THE RULES OF 
IMPEACHMENT, ANY MOTION TO 

02:03:32.876 --> 02:03:37.731
SUBMIT SUBPOENA WITNESSES OR 
DOCUMENT, THAT MOTION IS AGREED 

02:03:37.948 --> 02:03:39.948
TO BY A VOTE OF

02:03:43.266 --> 02:03:45.316
55 TO 45. MAJORITY LEADER? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I SUGGEST THE 

02:03:45.531 --> 02:03:49.321
ABSENCE OF A QUORUM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLE.

02:04:07.104 --> 02:04:09.370
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE HAS VOTED THAT 
THEY CAN CALL WITNESSES, THIS IS

02:04:09.584 --> 02:04:11.444
LIVE COVERAGE FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST, WE WILL STAY 

02:04:11.445 --> 02:04:13.492
GLUED TO THE SENATE FLOOR HERE 
AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. A 

02:04:13.693 --> 02:04:15.545
SURPRISE THIS MORNING, THAT THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ASKED

02:04:15.546 --> 02:04:19.084
TO CALL A WITNESS, CONGRESSWOMAN
HERRERA BEUTLER, WHO HAS GONE ON

02:04:19.299 --> 02:04:21.550
THE RECORD SAYING THAT SHE WAS 
TOLD ABOUT A CONVERSATION  THAT 

02:04:21.752 --> 02:04:23.752
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:29.326
KEVIN McCARTHY HAD WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE DAY THE 

02:04:29.401 --> 02:04:31.401
RIOT TOOK PLACE. NOW, WE'VE 
HEARD THE COUNTER ARGUMENT BY 

02:04:32.023 --> 02:04:34.023
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

02:04:39.795 --> 02:04:41.878
LAWYERS, AT FIRST SAYING, I'M 
GOING TO HAVE TO SUBPOENA 100 

02:04:42.094 --> 02:04:44.176
WITNESSES BUT THEN SAYING THAT 
HE WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD, SO 

02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:46.690
THAT WAS THE THREAT THAT HE LAID
ON THE TABLE WHILE ALSO 

02:04:46.905 --> 02:04:48.804
ASSERTING THAT THEY'VE HEARD 
ENOUGH, THEY HAD SEEN ENOUGH 

02:04:48.805 --> 02:04:51.604
FROM THE EVIDENCE AND THEY WERE 
READY TO MOVE FORWARD, BUT THEN,

02:04:54.034 --> 02:04:56.097
THE ATTORNEY SAYING THAT HE 
WANTED NOT ONLY TO HEAR FROM 

02:04:56.298 --> 02:04:58.373
WITNESSES BY ZOOM, WHICH IS HOW 
LEAD IMPEACHMENT MANAGER JAMIE 

02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:03.288
RASKIN SAID THE REQUEST COULD BE
SATISFIED BUT TRUMP'S LAWYER, 

02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:06.050
SAID THAT

02:05:08.408 --> 02:05:10.516
HE WANTS TO SEE THE WITNESSES IN
PERSON, IN PHILADELPHIA, WHERE 

02:05:10.717 --> 02:05:12.717
HE PRACTICES LAW.

02:05:17.295 --> 02:05:19.579
LET'S GO TO JAMES HOLMAN FOR THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS. THERE WAS 

02:05:19.783 --> 02:05:21.783
SOME CONFUSION BUT ALASKA 
SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN WHO AFTER 

02:05:22.033 --> 02:05:24.296
THE VOTE SAID, WAIT ARE WE 
VOTING ON A SPECIFIC WITNESS OR 

02:05:24.509 --> 02:05:26.580
ALL WITNESSES AND SENATOR LEAHY 
WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN IT BECAUSE IT

02:05:26.781 --> 02:05:28.781
WAS BREAKING FROM PROCEDURE. 
BUT,

02:05:32.334 --> 02:05:34.396
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF 
CONFUSION THERE AS TO WHAT 

02:05:34.598 --> 02:05:36.251
EXACTLY THEY WERE OPENING THE 
DOOR FOR, JAMES. 

02:05:36.252 --> 02:05:39.789
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WERE OPENING THE DOOR 
TO THE DEBATE CALLING WITNESSES,

02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:43.739
AND NOTABLY, SO AT THE END, 
THERE, FIVE REPUBLICANS ENDED UP

02:05:43.943 --> 02:05:46.479
JOINING EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT TO
VOTE TO CALL WITNESSES OR

02:05:50.126 --> 02:05:52.178
TO OPEN THE DEBATE ABOUT CALLING
THE WITNESSES SO THE SENATE 

02:05:52.382 --> 02:05:58.153
STILL HAS TO VOTE FOR, TO CALL 
EACH WITNESS. THIS NOTE IS AND 

02:05:58.913 --> 02:06:06.149
TO ALLOW MIKE VAN DER VEEN TO  
HARASS 100 PEOPLE BY CALLING IT 

02:06:06.556 --> 02:06:11.297
BRINGING THEM TO PHILADELPHIA, 
THE FIVE VOTES INCLUDE THE USUAL

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:15.215
SUSPECTS, LISA MURKOWSKI, BEN 
SASS, MITT ROMNEY, SUSAN 

02:06:15.967 --> 02:06:22.157
COLLINS, THEN LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS
BEEN ADVISING, GRAHAM, CHANGING 

02:06:22.807 --> 02:06:24.807
HIS VOTE FROM NO TO YES

02:06:31.158 --> 02:06:33.422
, HE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN 
SAYING PUBLICLY FOR DAYS, THAT 

02:06:33.623 --> 02:06:35.707
IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE 
WITNESSES, HE WANTS THEM TO CALL

02:06:35.908 --> 02:06:41.245
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE LIKE KAMALA 
HARRIS TO MUDDY THINGS UP AND 

02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:43.461
POTENTIALLY TO GUM UP THE BIDEN 
AGENDA

02:06:46.975 --> 02:06:49.178
. THIS IS A SURPRISE 
DEVELOPMENT, IT'S A SIGNIFICANT 

02:06:49.315 --> 02:06:53.124
DEVELOPMENT. IT ALMOST CERTAINLY
MEANS THAT THE TRIAL WILL NOT 

02:06:53.338 --> 02:06:55.449
CONCLUDE TODAY, AND THAT IS 
NOTEWORTHY BECAUSE

02:07:02.328 --> 02:07:04.328
BOTH SIDES WERE EXPECTING TO 
GIVE CLOSING ARGUMENTS, AND YOU 

02:07:04.372 --> 02:07:06.372
KNOW, YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE 
MITCH McCONNELL SENDING OUT A 

02:07:06.446 --> 02:07:09.286
STATEMENT SAYING I'M PLANNING TO
VOTE AGAINST CONVENTION 

02:07:09.692 --> 02:07:11.743
CONVICTION LATER TODAY, THEY'RE 
NOT ABLE TO DO A ZOOM DEPOSITION

02:07:11.943 --> 02:07:13.943
OF THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM 
WASHINGTON STATE, YOU KNOW, 

02:07:14.183 --> 02:07:18.806
RIGHT AWAY, SO THIS IS A BIG 
DEVELOPMENT THAT I THINK DOES 

02:07:19.007 --> 02:07:21.007
KIND OF REFLECT

02:07:27.278 --> 02:07:29.342
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A TRIAL AND 
TRIALS CAN HAVE SURPRISING 

02:07:29.547 --> 02:07:31.547
DEVELOPMENTS. THE OTHER THING I 
THINK THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT FROM 

02:07:31.605 --> 02:07:35.938
MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN, HE CLAIMED
DURING THE BIZARRE SPECTACLE 

02:07:36.141 --> 02:07:38.141
THAT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED 
AFTER THE MOB

02:07:41.932 --> 02:07:43.932
REACHED THE CAPITOL WAS 
IRRELEVANT, THAT WAS THE WORD HE

02:07:43.988 --> 02:07:45.988
USED, IRRELEVANT, THAT IS 
REMARKABLE BECAUSE 

02:07:50.764 --> 02:07:52.449
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS HAVE 
ARGUED IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

02:07:52.450 --> 02:07:54.450
UNDERSTAND TRUMP'S STATE OF 
MIND, HOW HE RESPONDED ONCE THE 

02:07:54.523 --> 02:07:57.276
CAPITOL WAS BREACHED, AND IN 
FACT,  THAT WAS A CENTRAL FOCUS

02:08:02.735 --> 02:08:04.997
OF A BUNCH OF THE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS WHO WERE ON THE FENCE 

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:06.832
YESTERDAY INCLUDING COLLINS AND 
MURKOWSKI, AND TRUMP'S LAWYER 

02:08:06.833 --> 02:08:08.833
NOW SAYING HOW TRUMP RESPONDED 
TO THE MOB, TOTALLY IRRELEVANT 

02:08:08.907 --> 02:08:12.515
AND FRANKLY, THAT IS A TACIT 
ADMISSION THAT THE FACTS ARE BAD

02:08:12.684 --> 02:08:18.954
FOR TRUMP WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
FACT THAT HE DID NOT CARE ABOUT 

02:08:19.170 --> 02:08:23.306
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO 
REPUBLICANS AND IF ANYTHING HE 

02:08:23.507 --> 02:08:27.106
WAS ENJOYING IT AND WATCHING IT 
ON TELEVISION AS IT PLAYED OUT. 

02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:32.768
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE QUORUM, THE SENATE HAS TO
HAVE A RESOLUTION TO DETERMINE 

02:08:32.968 --> 02:08:37.659
THE WITNESSES. SO AS JAMES 
POINTS OUT, THIS IS OPENING THE 

02:08:37.874 --> 02:08:43.455
DOOR TO IT BUT THIS IS NOT 
DECISIVE ABOUT WHAT WITNESSES 

02:08:43.657 --> 02:08:45.729
WOULD BE CALLED. RHONDA COLEMAN,
YOU KNOW, YOU WARNED US THAT 

02:08:45.929 --> 02:08:48.270
NOTHING IS PREDICTABLE OR 
DETERMINED AHEAD OF TIME

02:08:53.335 --> 02:08:55.771
IN CONGRESS, IN A TRIAL, AND IN 
A CASE LIKE THIS, SO RHONDA, 

02:08:55.973 --> 02:08:57.973
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS CALLING TO 

02:08:58.024 --> 02:09:00.223
HEAR FROM CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA 
BEUTLER 

02:09:04.374 --> 02:09:05.797
? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SAID THAT THIS MORNING, 

02:09:05.798 --> 02:09:11.327
THAT YOU CAN NEVER SAY ANYTHING 
IS OFF THE TABLE HERE ON THE 

02:09:11.529 --> 02:09:14.000
HILL AND THIS IS PROOF OF IT. 
IT'S ALSO PROOF THAT THAT AREA 

02:09:14.218 --> 02:09:16.218
OF THE IMPEACHMENT

02:09:18.973 --> 02:09:20.973
MANAGERS ARGUMENT, THAT THEY 
WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT TRUMP 

02:09:21.022 --> 02:09:23.129
KNEW AND WHEN HE KNEW IT, IS 
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT, AND IS 

02:09:23.331 --> 02:09:25.624
WEIGHING ON THE MINDS OF THESE 
SENATORS WHO ARE ON THE FENCE, 

02:09:25.827 --> 02:09:28.103
AND WONDERING ABOUT THAT PART OF
THE WHOLE TIMELINE. AND WE DID 

02:09:28.866 --> 02:09:30.866
HEAR FROM

02:09:39.971 --> 02:09:42.264
VAN DER VEEN, HE ALSO MADE THE 
ARGUMENT YESTERDAY THAT THIS IS 

02:09:42.479 --> 02:09:44.479
A CHARGE OF INCITEMENT, IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TRUMP WAS 

02:09:44.537 --> 02:09:46.827
DOING AFTER THE RIOT OR WHILE 
THE RIGHT WAS GOING ON, THE 

02:09:47.038 --> 02:09:49.313
CHARGES INCITEMENT, AND WE SAW 
HIM SAY THAT TODAY, HE WAS  

02:09:49.886 --> 02:09:54.053
GESTICULATING, AND IT FELT LIKE 
A MADE-FOR-TV MOMENT THERE, AND 

02:09:54.254 --> 02:09:56.542
IT APPEARS NOW THAT THEY WILL BE
ABLE TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES, SO 

02:09:56.742 --> 02:09:58.792
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE OUT ON ANY 
OTHERS, OTHER THAN 

02:09:58.997 --> 02:10:00.997
REPRESENTATIVE BEUTLER  HAS 
NAMED BY RASKIN AS SOMEBODY WHO 

02:10:01.059 --> 02:10:03.059
KNOWS MORE ABOUT

02:10:14.343 --> 02:10:16.395
THE DETAILS ABOUT THE CALL WITH 
KEVIN McCARTHY AND TRUMP WHILE 

02:10:16.597 --> 02:10:18.673
THE RIGHT WAS GOING ON. AND HER 
STATEMENT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT 

02:10:18.874 --> 02:10:21.546
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IT. IT'S
ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:23.787
THIS VOTE IS TO SUBPOENA 
WITNESSES, SO THIS IS NOT AN 

02:10:23.991 --> 02:10:25.615
INVITE, THIS WOULD BE A 
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA THAT 

02:10:25.616 --> 02:10:28.278
WOULD COMPEL ANYONE ON THE LIST 
TO COME HERE OR DO IT VIA ZOOM. 

02:10:28.482 --> 02:10:30.941
AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT, 
TOO, THAT MUCH OF THE CONGRESSES

02:10:31.143 --> 02:10:33.191
WORK RIGHT NOW, AND HEARINGS, 
HAVE BEEN ZOOM-BASED. I KNOW THE

02:10:33.393 --> 02:10:36.174
TRUMP LAWYER SAID THAT HE WANTS 
TO SEE THEM IN HIS OFFICE,

02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:42.898
IN PHILADELPHIA, BUT THE WORK ON
THE HILL, BECAUSE OF THE 

02:10:43.099 --> 02:10:45.175
PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE STILL 
EXPERIENCING, A LOT OF IT HAS 

02:10:45.377 --> 02:10:47.835
BEEN DONE OVER ZOOM, SO, THAT IS
WHY RASKIN BROUGHT THAT PART UP 

02:10:48.036 --> 02:10:51.792
TO BE DONE VIA ZOOM. SO WE WILL 
SEE WHAT COMES NEXT. THE GRAHAM 

02:10:51.996 --> 02:10:54.293
VOTE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A 
SURPRISE BECAUSE HE HAS ONCE 

02:10:54.486 --> 02:10:56.486
SAID THAT HE DIDN'T THINK 
WITNESSES, ESPECIALLY THE 

02:10:56.718 --> 02:10:58.718
RIOTERS SHOULD

02:11:07.203 --> 02:11:09.265
ALLOWED IN, THAT WOULD CREATE A 
CIRCUS ENVIRONMENT, BUT TO SEE 

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.720
HIM ADD HIS NAME TO THE LIST, 
THAT IS INTERESTING, AND IT'S 

02:11:11.921 --> 02:11:13.965
SOMETHING I THINK WE WILL 
DISSECT A LITTLE LATER AS WE 

02:11:14.181 --> 02:11:16.430
HEAR FROM HIM, AND PERHAPS HERE 
WHY HE MADE THAT DECISION. IT 

02:11:16.645 --> 02:11:18.922
COULD BE POLITICALLY BASED, HE 
MAY WANT TO BRING AN KAMALA 

02:11:19.125 --> 02:11:21.182
HARRIS, ONE OF THE DEFENSE 
LAWYER SAID, THEY WOULD LIKE TO 

02:11:21.384 --> 02:11:26.516
SEE HER, THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
NANCY PELOSI AND OF COURSE, THAT

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.020
WOULD CREATE MORE OF A PARTISAN 
ARGUMENT FOR THEM. BUT OF COURSE

02:11:29.229 --> 02:11:31.293
THE PIECE OF MANAGERS ARE 
PROBABLY GOING TO SAY THOSE ARE 

02:11:32.046 --> 02:11:34.046
GERMANE WITNESSES

02:11:35.822 --> 02:11:38.496
, AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH 
THIS WITNESS TIME, IS TO SEE 

02:11:38.710 --> 02:11:40.710
WHAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THOSE 
CALLS,

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:50.920
THAT REPUBLICANS HAD OUT TO 
TRUMP, TO REALLY ESTABLISH WHAT 

02:11:50.981 --> 02:11:52.981
HIS THINKING WAS, DURING THE 
INSURRECTION, AND YOU CAN JUST 

02:11:53.013 --> 02:11:54.878
TELL THAT THAT PART OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARGUMENT, 

02:11:54.879 --> 02:11:56.105
ALL THIS WEEK, WAS REALLY 
SUCCESSFUL. 

02:11:56.106 --> 02:11:58.625
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES HALLMAN, WHY SUBPOENA 
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BEUTLER, 

02:11:58.824 --> 02:12:00.824
AND LET'S JUST REMIND OUR 
VIEWERS AND TAKE THEM THROUGH 

02:12:00.869 --> 02:12:04.945
WHAT EXACT  SHE SAYS THAT SHE 
KNEW BECAUSE SHE SHARED A 

02:12:05.161 --> 02:12:07.190
STATEMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA LAST 
NIGHT THAT IT WAS JUST REPEATING

02:12:07.965 --> 02:12:12.738
COMMENTS THAT SHE HAS MADE 
REPEATEDLY OVER THE LAST MONTH. 

02:12:12.941 --> 02:12:14.394
WHAT DOES SHE SAY THAT SHE 
KNOWS? 

02:12:14.395 --> 02:12:18.274
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAS 
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF A PHONE 

02:12:18.476 --> 02:12:23.227
CONVERSATION THAT KEVIN McCARTHY
,  THE REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE 

02:12:23.431 --> 02:12:25.431
HOUSE, HAD WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WHILE THE CAPITOL WAS UNDER 

02:12:25.493 --> 02:12:27.590
SIEGE . WHILE IT WAS BEING 
BREACHED, WHILE MEMBERS OF 

02:12:27.810 --> 02:12:29.810
CONGRESS'S LIVES WERE IN 
JEOPARDY. AND

02:12:33.342 --> 02:12:38.092
SHE KNOWS THAT McCARTHY ASKED 
TRUMP TO SEND HELP AND TRUMP 

02:12:38.297 --> 02:12:40.297
RESPONDED TO McCARTHY, I GUESS 
THESE PEOPLE CARE MORE ABOUT 

02:12:40.327 --> 02:12:47.503
STOPPING THE ELECTION FROM BEING
COUNTED THEN YOU DO, KEVIN. AND 

02:12:47.706 --> 02:12:49.706
McCARTHY, USING PROFANITY TO 
RESPOND

02:12:59.825 --> 02:13:01.653
AND EXPRESS ANGER AT THE 
PRESIDENT, INDEED McCARTHY WOULD

02:13:01.654 --> 02:13:03.498
LATER, DURING THE IMPEACHMENT 
PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE SAY 

02:13:03.499 --> 02:13:05.499
THAT HE SUPPORTED A CENSURE 
RESOLUTION FOR TRUMP, THEN HE 

02:13:05.573 --> 02:13:08.002
TRIED TO MAKE NICE, FLEW TO 
MAR-A-LAGO AND POSTED THE 

02:13:08.137 --> 02:13:12.739
PICTURE WITH TRUMP GIVING THUMBS
UP, BUT HERRERA BEUTLER WAS 

02:13:12.953 --> 02:13:15.243
THERE THAT DAY, SHE'S ONE OF THE
10 REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR 

02:13:15.998 --> 02:13:17.998
IMPEACHMENT 

02:13:19.955 --> 02:13:22.001
AND SHE, AS A REPUBLICAN MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS COULD TESTIFY TO 

02:13:22.201 --> 02:13:24.201
TRUMP'S STATE OF MIND, DURING 
THAT TERRIFYING TIME

02:13:28.737 --> 02:13:30.737
WHEN THE NATIONAL GUARD WASN'T 
COMING, HELP WASN'T COMING, AND 

02:13:31.343 --> 02:13:34.492
STAFFERS WERE BARRICADING 
THEMSELVES IN ROOMS, SO SHE CAN 

02:13:34.693 --> 02:13:36.693
SPEAK VERY MUCH TO THE FACT THAT

02:13:47.399 --> 02:13:49.216
TRUMP, IN SOME WAYS WAS 
RELISHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING, 

02:13:49.217 --> 02:13:51.476
WHICH DOES SHOW THAT THIS IS 
SOMETHING HE WAS FINE WITH, AND 

02:13:51.679 --> 02:13:53.679
MAYBE EVEN WANTED. BUT IT'S 
NOTABLE BECAUSE IT IS A 

02:13:53.733 --> 02:13:55.798
REPUBLICAN, THIS IS NOT SOME 
DEMOCRAT, THIS IS NOT, AND IT'S 

02:13:56.001 --> 02:13:57.841
ALSO, SHE'S SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T 
HAVE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. SHE 

02:13:57.842 --> 02:14:00.146
CAN'T SAY THAT SHE'S NOT GOING 
TO TESTIFY ABOUT YOU KNOW, WHAT 

02:14:00.345 --> 02:14:02.345
TRUMP WAS SAYING PRIVATELY TO 
HIS ADVISORS

02:14:08.158 --> 02:14:09.801
-- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WANT TO PAUSE YOU THERE. 

02:14:09.802 --> 02:14:11.647
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. ONE 
MIGHT SAY, HERRERA BEUTLER, 

02:14:11.648 --> 02:14:14.328
MIGHT TESTIFY AS TO WHAT KEVIN 
McCARTHY TOLD HER  DONALD TRUMP 

02:14:14.530 --> 02:14:16.586
SAID TO HIM, RIGHT, SO WHY NOT 
JUST SUBPOENA SOMEONE IN 

02:14:17.346 --> 02:14:19.346
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

02:14:27.024 --> 02:14:29.263
ORBIT WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM, WHY 

02:14:29.467 --> 02:14:31.467
NOT SUBPOENA KEVIN McCARTHY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; KEVIN McCARTHY WOULD BE A 

02:14:31.527 --> 02:14:33.805
HOSTILE WITNESS, HE SOMEONE WHO,
HE WANTS TO BE SPEAKER OF THE 

02:14:34.014 --> 02:14:37.510
HOUSE IN 2023, AND HE HAS FIRMLY
TIED HIMSELF TO TRUMP.  AND HE'S

02:14:37.712 --> 02:14:40.005
NOT GOING TO PLAY BALL, BUT IT 
DOES SEEM THAT HERRERA BEUTLER 

02:14:40.210 --> 02:14:42.843
WILL  THE STATEMENT INDICATES 
THAT SHE WILL. FRANKLY, WE DON'T

02:14:42.986 --> 02:14:46.999
KNOW WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS 
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED 

02:14:47.167 --> 02:14:49.167
BETWEEN

02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:54.643
YOU KNOW SOMEONE LIKE JAMIE 
RASKIN OR ONE OF THE OTHER 

02:14:54.845 --> 02:14:56.845
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THEY CAN 
CALL HER A BEUTLER AND SAY, 

02:14:56.899 --> 02:14:59.769
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO APPEAR, 
AND SHE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SAID

02:14:59.983 --> 02:15:05.144
YES. SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE 
IDEA THAT DEMOCRATS, OF WANTING 

02:15:05.348 --> 02:15:07.614
THEM TO CALL HER, SUGGEST THAT 
THIS WOULD BE A VERY SHORT 

02:15:07.827 --> 02:15:12.145
DETOUR, RASKIN WOULDN'T HAVE 
PULLED THE SURPRISE MOVE, IF HE 

02:15:12.345 --> 02:15:14.345
THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO

02:15:21.171 --> 02:15:23.205
RESIST COMPLIANCE, YOU KNOW, AND
THIS WOULD DRAG IT OUT ANOTHER 

02:15:23.406 --> 02:15:26.064
WEEK. HE WOULD ONLY DO THIS IF 
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A QUICK 

02:15:26.279 --> 02:15:28.279
WAY TO ESTABLISH EVIDENCE FOR 
THE RECORD, THAT TRUMP WAS 

02:15:28.327 --> 02:15:30.781
TOTALLY CALLOUS WHEN THE MOB WAS
IN THE CAPITOL. 

02:15:30.782 --> 02:15:33.165
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO JAMES, THIS IS WHAT  
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BEUTLER 

02:15:44.484 --> 02:15:46.755
SAID LAST NIGHT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
SHE SAID IN MY JANUARY 12 

02:15:46.957 --> 02:15:48.832
STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT, A 

02:15:48.833 --> 02:15:50.688
REMINDER, THAT SHE VOTED TO 
IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP. I 

02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:52.341
REFERENCED A CONVERSATION HOUSE 
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY 

02:15:52.342 --> 02:15:54.576
RELAYED TO ME THAT HE HAD HAD 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHILE THE 

02:15:54.778 --> 02:15:56.836
ATTACK WAS ONGOING. SHE THEN 
LAYS OUT THE DETAILS. AND THEN, 

02:15:57.052 --> 02:15:59.310
SHE SAYS, THAT SHE HAS YOU KNOW,
SHARE THIS WITH THOUSANDS OF 

02:15:59.523 --> 02:16:01.672
RESIDENTS ON A TELEPHONE TOWN 
HALL, SHE TOLD HER

02:16:10.192 --> 02:16:12.027
EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS, SHE 
TOLD THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER, AND 

02:16:12.028 --> 02:16:14.060
SHE ENDS WITH THIS, JAMES, TO 
THE PATRIOTS WHO ARE STANDING 

02:16:14.276 --> 02:16:16.111
NEXT TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT, 
AND THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE 

02:16:16.112 --> 02:16:18.153
HAPPENING, OR EVEN TO THE FORMER
VICE PRESIDENT, IF YOU HAVE 

02:16:18.369 --> 02:16:21.056
SOMETHING TO ADD HERE, NOW WOULD
BE THE TIME. SO WHY NOT JUST TRY

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:23.376
AND ADMIT THIS STATEMENT, WHY 
CAN'T LEAD

02:16:28.005 --> 02:16:29.442
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER RASKIN 
REFERENCED THE STATEMENT AND 

02:16:29.443 --> 02:16:34.557
READ THIS INTO THE RECORD, WHY 
YOU'RE FROM 

02:16:35.162 --> 02:16:36.579
HERSELF? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MANAGERS KNOW THAT THIS 

02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:41.101
IS SOMETHING THAT ON THE FENCE 
PUBLICANS CARE ABOUT DEEPLY, AND

02:16:41.314 --> 02:16:43.551
THEY KNOW IT IS A POINT OF 
DISCOMFORT FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS

02:16:43.753 --> 02:16:46.502
WHO ARE INCREDIBLY UNEASY WITH 
WHAT TRUMP

02:16:57.276 --> 02:16:59.922
DID THAT DAY WHO ARE NOT TROMPE 
L'OEIL IS, SO THIS IS A LEGAL 

02:17:00.128 --> 02:17:02.444
STRATEGY. IT ALSO COMES ON THE 
HEELS, THERE WAS A LOT OF 

02:17:02.645 --> 02:17:04.302
FRUSTRATION AMONG REPUBLICANS 
THAT THE TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM 

02:17:04.303 --> 02:17:06.303
WOULDN'T GIVE ANYTHING WHEN IT 
CAME TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 

02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:08.448
TIMELINE, ONLY IN SOME WAYS THE 
TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM BROUGHT THIS 

02:17:08.649 --> 02:17:11.262
ON THEMSELVES, BY SAYING, WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIMELINE IS,

02:17:11.394 --> 02:17:13.394
SO

02:17:17.037 --> 02:17:19.037
THIS IS JAMIE RASKIN'S WAY OF 
SAYING, WELL, HERE'S REPUBLICAN 

02:17:19.087 --> 02:17:21.347
CONGRESSWOMAN WHO WILL HELP FILL
IN THE TIMELINE FOR US. AND THAT

02:17:21.550 --> 02:17:26.239
IS WHEN HE SAW MICHAEL VAN DER 
VEEN MAKE THE STERLING CLAIMED 

02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:28.444
THAT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED 
AFTER THE CAPITOL WAS 

02:17:39.595 --> 02:17:41.435
BREACHED WAS IRRELEVANT, WHICH 
DOES SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE 

02:17:41.436 --> 02:17:43.515
ACTUALLY QUITE TERRIFIED, AND 
THE TONE THAT VAN DER VEEN TOOK 

02:17:43.718 --> 02:17:46.190
OF, I'M GOING TO MAKE 100 PEOPLE
COME TO PHILADELPHIA, AND WE ARE

02:17:46.394 --> 02:17:48.860
GOING TO HAVE DEPOSITIONS IN MY 
OFFICE WHICH IS NOT HOW IT WORKS

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.928
AT ALL, THAT  KIND OF CAME OFF 
AS A THREAT, AND THAT COULD NOT 

02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:53.973
POSSIBLY HAVE PLAYED WELL WITH 
THE COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, ROMNEY 

02:17:53.974 --> 02:17:55.974
TYPES, AND IT PUTS THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO WANT TO 

02:17:56.019 --> 02:18:01.293
VOTE TO ACQUIT, IT PUTS THEM IN 
A VERY BAD SPOT. SO PART OF IT 

02:18:01.433 --> 02:18:05.734
IS, THEATER, PART OF IT IS 
STRATEGY, SOME OF IT

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.160
IS THAT ACTUALLY HAVING HERRERA 
BEUTLER SAY THIS UNDER OATH, 

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:17.624
DOES VERY MUCH STRENGTHEN THEIR 
ARGUMENT  THAT TRUMP WAS 

02:18:17.839 --> 02:18:19.839
DERELICT IN HIS DUTY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLDEN, HERE'S WHAT WE

02:18:19.882 --> 02:18:21.882
ARE HEARING FROM INSIDE OF THE 
SENATE CHAMBER,

02:18:32.005 --> 02:18:34.055
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION 
THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY 

02:18:34.258 --> 02:18:36.104
AFTERMATH AND WE SAW THAT 
OURSELVES, WE HEARD SENATOR 

02:18:36.105 --> 02:18:38.168
SULLIVAN ASKED WHAT ARE WE 
VOTING ON, AFTER THE VOTE HAD 

02:18:38.385 --> 02:18:40.385
ALREADY TAKEN PLACE, AND TO 
REMIND HER VIEWERS WHAT THEY 

02:18:40.471 --> 02:18:42.554
VOTED ON IS TO SORT OF ENTERTAIN
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SPECIFIC 

02:18:42.756 --> 02:18:44.756
WITNESSES, SO HERE'S WHAT KAREN 
SHARES WITH US, THAT SENATOR 

02:18:44.826 --> 02:18:47.677
GRAHAM WAS EXPLAINING THINGS AND
HUDDLED WITH SENATORS INCLUDING 

02:18:47.883 --> 02:18:49.883
LEE, COTTON, HOGAN, FISHING, 
DANES AND YOUNG AND THEY WERE 

02:18:49.929 --> 02:18:53.590
ALL SURROUNDING EACH OTHER, AND 
THE STAFF OF McCONNELL WERE 

02:18:54.352 --> 02:18:56.352
TALKING TO MURKOWSKI, COLLINS 
AND

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:02.263
ROMNEY, AND THE DEMOCRATS WERE 
HAVING THEIR OWN HUDDLES ON THE 

02:19:03.024 --> 02:19:05.024
SITE. SO, MY QUESTION FOR YOU 
IS,

02:19:08.681 --> 02:19:10.522
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY START 
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL

02:19:10.523 --> 02:19:12.523
WITNESSES, DO WE AND

02:19:22.962 --> 02:19:24.810
ANTICIPATE THAT REPUBLICANS 
GETTING ON THE SAME PAGE AND 

02:19:24.811 --> 02:19:26.273
DEMOCRATS GETTING THEIR OWN 
STRATEGY TOGETHER HERE? 

02:19:26.274 --> 02:19:28.378
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE 
DECISIONS WERE LATEBREAKING, AND

02:19:28.591 --> 02:19:30.660
I THINK I REFERENCED TO THAT 
EARLIER, IN THE MORNING SHOW, 

02:19:30.878 --> 02:19:33.519
THAT A LOT OF TALKING MIGHT HAVE
HAPPENED AFTER THEY LEFT 

02:19:33.655 --> 02:19:35.655
YESTERDAY

02:19:38.483 --> 02:19:40.537
, THIS MORNING, SO IT SEEMS LIKE
BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 

02:19:40.738 --> 02:19:43.201
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE WAY
FORWARD HERE, AND WHAT TO DO 

02:19:43.402 --> 02:19:44.861
NEXT. AND THAT'S PRETTY 
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE, UTILIZING 

02:19:44.862 --> 02:19:46.862
WITNESSES COULD MEAN EVERYTHING,
HONESTLY, TO BOTH SIDES. YOU SEE

02:19:46.924 --> 02:19:51.507
THERE THAT VAN DER VEEN DOES 
LOOK A BIT  CONCERNED NOW THAT 

02:19:51.708 --> 02:19:53.872
HE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT 
ARGUMENT, THE CHARGES ABOUT

02:20:02.853 --> 02:20:05.126
EXCITEMENT, NOT ABOUT WHAT HE 
WAS DOING DURING THE TIME OF THE

02:20:05.328 --> 02:20:07.564
RIDE, IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY IS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 

02:20:07.766 --> 02:20:10.019
NEXT, WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT WAY
FORWARD BUT I THINK ANY 

02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:12.220
WITNESSES THAT WOULD HAVE ANY 
EFFECT WOULD BE WITNESSES THAT 

02:20:12.294 --> 02:20:14.554
CAN SPEAK TO THIS POINT IN THE 
TIMELINE ABOUT TRUMP AND HIS 

02:20:14.756 --> 02:20:16.813
MINDSET DURING THE INSURRECTION 
BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE HEARD 

02:20:17.015 --> 02:20:19.086
TRUMP'S TEAM TALK ABOUT HE'S THE
MOST LAW AND ORDER PRESIDENT, 

02:20:19.287 --> 02:20:24.007
BUT IF HE WAS NOT CALLING IN THE
GARDEN OR BEING A PART OF THOSE 

02:20:24.206 --> 02:20:26.356
CONVERSATIONS OR WAS IT 
CONCERNED ABOUT MIKE PENCE, THEN

02:20:33.197 --> 02:20:35.269
THE IMPATIENT MANAGERS CAN USE 
THAT TO SHOW THEIR WHOLE POINT, 

02:20:35.470 --> 02:20:37.744
THAT HE SAID HE'S NOT SUPPORTING
THE RIOTERS YET HE DIDN'T DO 

02:20:37.948 --> 02:20:40.464
ANYTHING TO STOP THEM, SO HOW 
COULD HE HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. I 

02:20:40.667 --> 02:20:42.739
THINK NOW THAT THEY ARE AT THIS 
PART WHERE THEY COULD 

02:20:42.954 --> 02:20:46.464
FORESEEABLY HAVE SOMETHING 
WITNESSES, THEY ARE FIGURING OUT

02:20:46.677 --> 02:20:48.910
WHO WOULD BE THE MOST COMPELLING
VOICES AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE 

02:20:49.115 --> 02:20:51.184
ARE SEEING THAT APPETITE NOW 
FROM THIS GROUP OF SENATORS, WHO

02:20:51.401 --> 02:20:54.521
WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE 
AND THAT ALSO SHOWS YOU THE Q 

02:20:54.724 --> 02:20:56.724
AND A THEY WENT THROUGH

02:21:04.515 --> 02:21:06.550
YESTERDAY, DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE 
MUCH OF AN EFFECT. THEY DIDN'T 

02:21:06.754 --> 02:21:08.788
UTILIZE ALL OF THEIR TIME WITH 
THE Q&amp;amp;A, YESTERDAY WENT THROUGH 

02:21:08.989 --> 02:21:10.828
RATHER QUICKLY, WE NOTED 
YESTERDAY THAT THE DEFENSE TEAM 

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:13.293
ALSO DIDN'T EVEN USE A QUARTER 
OF THEIR TIME. THEY JUST CAME TO

02:21:13.496 --> 02:21:15.914
ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS OF AN 
ARGUMENT, WHEREAS THE IMPATIENT 

02:21:16.057 --> 02:21:18.057
MANAGERS BROKERS BETWEEN TWO 
DAYS, SO IT SHOWS THAT ENOUGH 

02:21:18.224 --> 02:21:20.224
HASN'T HAPPENED YET

02:21:22.725 --> 02:21:25.154
TO PUT MINDS AT EASE IN THE 
GROUP OF SENATORS WHO WANT MORE 

02:21:25.358 --> 02:21:27.308
ANSWERS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S BRING ERIN BLAKE INTO 

02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:29.309
THE

02:21:34.795 --> 02:21:36.795
CONVERSATION, SENIOR REPORTER 
FOR THE FIX. YOU DON'T HAVE A 

02:21:36.887 --> 02:21:38.912
CRYSTAL BALL BUT YOU ARE A GOOD 
JOURNALIST, SO YOU'VE ALREADY 

02:21:39.112 --> 02:21:40.754
WRITTEN ABOUT WITNESSES, THAT 
COULD POTENTIALLY GIVE IMPORTANT

02:21:40.755 --> 02:21:43.019
TESTIMONY AT THIS TRIAL. TALK 
ABOUT, WHO IS REALLY RELEVANT TO

02:21:43.783 --> 02:21:48.229
THIS TRIAL? THE MAC SO I 
INITIALLY WROTE ABOUT

02:21:51.463 --> 02:21:54.949
POTENTIAL WITNESSES EARLY THIS 
WEEK BEFORE THE TRIAL STARTED, 

02:21:55.148 --> 02:21:57.701
SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO NOW. 
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

02:22:01.063 --> 02:22:03.063
,

02:22:06.237 --> 02:22:08.272
THAT THEY WOULDN'T CALL ANY 
WITNESSES, THAT SEEMED TO BE A 

02:22:08.476 --> 02:22:10.476
QUESTIONABLE DECISION GIVEN THAT
WE DIDN'T SEE ANY IMPEACHMENT IN

02:22:11.105 --> 02:22:13.105
THE HOUSE.

02:22:23.644 --> 02:22:25.906
AND THAT WE ALSO WOULDN'T SEE 
ANY IN THE ACTUAL TRIAL, IT 

02:22:26.108 --> 02:22:28.215
DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE IDEA
THAT THE DEMOCRATS PUT FORWARD, 

02:22:28.414 --> 02:22:30.259
WHICH IS, THIS WAS SO 
SIGNIFICANT THAT WE REALLY 

02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:32.260
NEEDED TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH 
HERE AND HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. 

02:22:32.334 --> 02:22:37.645
SOME OF THE ONES THAT I 
MENTIONED BEFORE, WHERE THE 

02:22:37.850 --> 02:22:39.503
CAPITOL RIOTERS, WHO HAVE CITED 
THE PRESIDENT'S INVITATION, 

02:22:39.504 --> 02:22:41.785
EITHER WHEN THEY WERE IN THE 
BUILDING ON SOME OF THOSE LIVE 

02:22:41.987 --> 02:22:44.038
STREAMS, OR IN THEIR COURT 
CASES, SEVERAL OF THEM, IN THEIR

02:22:44.241 --> 02:22:46.516
DEFENSES HAD SAID THEY FELT  
LIKE THEY WERE INVITED BY THE 

02:22:46.716 --> 02:22:48.815
PRESIDENT, THAT MIGHT BE LEGALLY
EXPEDIENT FOR THEM TO TRY AND 

02:22:49.016 --> 02:22:54.330
SHIFT LAME TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT
RATHER THAN THEMSELVES. SOME 

02:22:54.546 --> 02:22:56.546
OTHER ONES, WERE THESE WHITE 
HOUSE AIDES OR FORMER AIDES, 

02:22:56.596 --> 02:22:58.642
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDES WHO 
WERE INVOLVED IN PLANNING OF THE

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:02.995
JANUARY 6 RALLY, THE SHIFT FOR 
THE RALLY CHANGED OVER TIME, THE

02:23:03.209 --> 02:23:05.209
IDEA OF A MARCH TOWARD THE

02:23:13.238 --> 02:23:15.491
CAPITOL CAME ON LATE, FIGURING 
OUT HOW ALL OF THESE THINGS CAME

02:23:15.692 --> 02:23:17.692
TOGETHER AND JUST WHAT THE 
PLANNING INVOLVED, AND HOW THIS 

02:23:17.781 --> 02:23:19.864
MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEABLE 
WOULD SEEM TO  THE AN IMPORTANT 

02:23:20.067 --> 02:23:22.554
THING, AND IN THE LAST FEW DAYS,
THE LAST FEW THINGS THAT HAVE 

02:23:22.769 --> 02:23:24.809
SURFACED, ARE THE ONES THAT 
WE'VE HEARD THE MOST ABOUT, WITH

02:23:25.016 --> 02:23:30.600
THESE PHONE CALLS THE PRESIDENT 
HAD WITH LAWMAKERS EARLY IN THE 

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.360
ATTEMPTED INSURRECTION,

02:23:37.181 --> 02:23:38.823
JAMIE HERRERA BEUTLER, WHO IS 
BASICALLY STEPPING FORWARD, 

02:23:38.824 --> 02:23:40.824
PUTTING ON A PRESS RELEASE 
SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE 

02:23:40.913 --> 02:23:42.974
HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED  THE 
COLLEGE TO TALK ABOUT THESE 

02:23:43.188 --> 02:23:46.073
THINGS. SHE COULD SPEAK TO THIS 
IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS AT 

02:23:46.276 --> 02:23:48.523
THE VERY LEAST INDIFFERENT TO 
WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE 

02:23:48.725 --> 02:23:51.076
CAPITOL. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE 
IS SENATOR  TOMMY TURBERVILLE

02:23:55.252 --> 02:23:57.706
, THIS IS THE OTHER CALL THAT WE
KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD 

02:23:57.908 --> 02:24:01.390
EARLY ON WHEN THEY CALLED MIKE 
LEE SEEKING TO TALK TO TOMMY 

02:24:01.592 --> 02:24:03.662
TURBERVILLE AND WE KNOW THAT HE 
AND TUPPER BILL TALKED ABOUT 

02:24:03.863 --> 02:24:06.569
OVERTURNING THE ELECTION BEFORE 
TURBERVILLE ENDED THE CALL BY 

02:24:06.772 --> 02:24:08.772
TELLING THE PRESIDENT THAT

02:24:37.188 --> 02:24:39.267
, EVEN AS THESE LAWMAKERS WERE 
IN SIGNIFICANT DANGER. IT ALSO 

02:24:39.468 --> 02:24:41.342
SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT 
POTENTIALLY, THE PRESIDENT MIGHT

02:24:41.343 --> 02:24:43.422
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION 
WITH MIKE PENCE AROUND THE TIME 

02:24:43.619 --> 02:24:45.934
OF HIS TWEET. THE SENATOR LEE 
NOW SAYS THE CALL ACTUALLY CAME 

02:24:46.151 --> 02:24:48.151
AFTER THE TWEET ATTACKING VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE, SO THESE ARE 

02:24:48.270 --> 02:24:50.270
SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT 
WITNESSES, WE ARE NOT GOING TO 

02:24:50.352 --> 02:24:52.651
SEE ALL OF THEM I WOULD GUESS 
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WANT TO KEEP 

02:24:52.865 --> 02:24:54.719
THIS SOMEWHAT EXPEDIENT, BUT 
CERTAINLY THESE ARE ONES THAT 

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.047
WOULD SEEM TO ANSWER SOME OF THE
BIG QUESTIONS THAT STILL REMAIN 

02:24:57.248 --> 02:24:59.248
IN THIS TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WILL KICK THIS QUESTION TO 

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:01.290
YOU, WHY SUBPOENA CONGRESSWOMAN 
HERRERA BEUTLER AND NOT  THE 

02:25:01.344 --> 02:25:03.414
PERSON WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE 
PHONE CALL, SHE SAID SHE WAS 

02:25:03.631 --> 02:25:05.504
TOLD ABOUT, KEVIN McCARTHY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK WHAT CONGRESSMAN 

02:25:05.505 --> 02:25:09.271
BEUTLER PROVIDES A SOMEBODY WHO 
SEEMS TO BE MOTIVATED TO TALK , 

02:25:09.481 --> 02:25:12.168
SUBPOENAING A LOWER RANKING 
HOUSE MEMBER IS NOT A SEVERE A 

02:25:12.928 --> 02:25:14.928
STEP AS

02:25:16.686 --> 02:25:18.686
THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER, THAT 
WOULD RATCHET THINGS UP AND 

02:25:18.745 --> 02:25:23.059
PROBABLY LAND CREDENCE TO THE 
TRUMP TEAMS THREATS TO CALL 

02:25:23.277 --> 02:25:26.148
PEOPLE LIKE NANCY PELOSI, AND 
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WHO 

02:25:26.555 --> 02:25:28.835
MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN TALKED 
ABOUT JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO. I 

02:25:29.050 --> 02:25:31.050
ALSO THINK  THAT HERRERA BEUTLER

02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.950
, SORRY, I CAN'T SAY HER NAME 
CORRECTLY, SHE PROVIDES MORE OF 

02:25:40.165 --> 02:25:42.212
AN ENTRÉE INTO WHO ELSE COULD 
SPEAK TO THIS. SHE HAS 

02:25:42.416 --> 02:25:44.416
REFERENCED THE IDEA THAT OTHER, 
PATRIOTS, AND THE HOUSE SHOULD 

02:25:44.436 --> 02:25:46.758
BE WILLING TO SPEAK UP. MAYBE 
SHE WILL PROVIDE SOME

02:25:58.164 --> 02:26:00.164
POINTERS ABOUT WHERE THEY SHOULD
GO NEXT, ARE THERE OTHER 

02:26:00.233 --> 02:26:02.323
LAWMAKERS WHO COULD ATTEST TO 
THE DETAILS OF THAT PHONE CALL 

02:26:02.524 --> 02:26:04.794
WITH KEVIN McCARTHY, SO I VIEW 
THIS MORE AS THEM PICKING OUT 

02:26:05.007 --> 02:26:07.007
THE MOST LOGICAL FIRST STEP

02:26:11.176 --> 02:26:13.256
IN WITNESSES, DOESN'T THAT THEY 
WILL CALL A WHOLE BUNCH OF 

02:26:13.461 --> 02:26:15.461
WITNESSES AFTER THAT BUT 
CERTAINLY, THE FACT THAT SHE HAS

02:26:15.559 --> 02:26:17.632
MOTIVATION, AND HAS COME 
FORWARD, IN A WAY, TO TALK ABOUT

02:26:17.837 --> 02:26:19.880
THESE THINGS, SUGGESTS THAT THIS
WOULD BE A WITNESS THAT WOULD 

02:26:20.083 --> 02:26:22.342
PROVIDE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF THE
INITIAL YOU KNOW, ENTRY INTO 

02:26:22.544 --> 02:26:24.195
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET AT 
HERE. 

02:26:24.196 --> 02:26:26.989
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AARON,  I WANT TO GET A SENSE
FROM YOU ABOUT

02:26:31.561 --> 02:26:33.613
HOW SPRAWLING AND FAR-REACHING 
THIS COULD GO. AS YOU POINT OUT,

02:26:33.815 --> 02:26:35.434
THE IMPATIENT MANAGERS, JUST 
FOCUSING ON ONE CONGRESSWOMAN, 

02:26:35.435 --> 02:26:39.568
DOES SORT OF LIMIT THE WAY THAT 
THIS COULD EASILY SORT OF GROW 

02:26:39.783 --> 02:26:41.963
AND EXPAND AND MULTIPLY, BUT WE 
DID JUST HEAR

02:27:03.381 --> 02:27:05.625
VAN DER VEEN SAY THAT HE WOULD 
LIKE TO SUBPOENA 100 PEOPLE? 

02:27:05.827 --> 02:27:08.093
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS HAS BEEN THE THREAT, THE
IDEA THAT IF DEMOCRATS START 

02:27:08.295 --> 02:27:10.369
CALLING WITNESSES THAT THE TRUMP
TEAM WILL JUST CALL A WHOLE 

02:27:10.569 --> 02:27:12.654
BUNCH OF WITNESSES, OR ATTEMPT 
TO CALL A WHOLE BUNCH OF 

02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:14.857
WITNESSES, YOU KNOW, IT'S A 
THREAT BECAUSE IT MIGHT PUT 

02:27:14.905 --> 02:27:17.183
SOMEBODY LIKE THE SPEAKER IN A 
TOUGH SPOT, IF SHE WERE TO 

02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:19.469
ACTUALLY HAVE TO TESTIFY, THE 
TRUMP TEAM COULD USE THESE  

02:27:19.674 --> 02:27:21.674
WITNESSES LIKE MURIEL BOWSER TO 
SHIFT THE ATTENTION TOWARD WHAT 

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:23.732
WAS DONE BEFORE THIS HAPPENED, 
HOW MUCH PREPARATION THERE HAVE 

02:27:23.792 --> 02:27:26.260
BEEN, TO REALLY SHIFT THE FOCUS 
ON TO OTHER ISSUES BUT I REALLY 

02:27:26.462 --> 02:27:28.513
THINK THAT DEMOCRATS WERE IN 
MANY WAYS, KIND OF FORCED INTO 

02:27:28.716 --> 02:27:31.372
THIS POSITION. THERE WAS A LOT 
OF CALLS FOR WITNESSES, THAT 

02:27:31.577 --> 02:27:33.869
DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE, IN LIGHT OF
WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT FROM THE 

02:27:34.071 --> 02:27:37.535
McCARTHY CALL, IN LIGHT OF SOME 
OF THESE OTHER REVELATIONS, SO, 

02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:40.023
THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD GO 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND NOT ASK

02:27:40.224 --> 02:27:42.224
TO HEAR MORE INFORMATION, I 
THINK

02:27:46.759 --> 02:27:48.759
RISKS LOOKING PRETTY BAD. BEYOND
THAT THOUGH, I DON'T BELIEVE 

02:27:48.818 --> 02:27:51.257
THEY WANT TO DROP US OUT A LOT. 
THE TRUMP TEAM UNDERSTANDS THAT,

02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:53.460
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE THREATENING 
TO CALL THE WITNESSES BECAUSE 

02:27:53.503 --> 02:27:55.503
THEY KNOW DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT 
THIS HANGING OVER THE ENTIRETY 

02:27:55.552 --> 02:27:58.357
OF BIDEN'S FIRST 100 DAYS. SO 
THAT THREAT IS GEARED AS MUCH 

02:27:58.498 --> 02:28:01.757
TOWARD HAVING WITNESSES THAT MAY
BE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO SEE

02:28:05.736 --> 02:28:07.996
OR DRYING THINGS OUT IN A WAY 
THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE VERY 

02:28:08.216 --> 02:28:10.216
CLEAR, THEY DON'T WANT THIS 
PROCESS TO BE.

02:28:24.444 --> 02:28:26.444
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY HAVE SIMPLE MAJORITIES 
THERE, ONLY A COUPLE OF 

02:28:26.476 --> 02:28:28.741
REPUBLICAN SAY, YEAH, I WOULD 
LIKE TO HEAR FROM HER. THEY CAN 

02:28:28.943 --> 02:28:33.407
SUBPOENA HER, AND IF THEY DO 
THAT, AS I BELIEVE YOU MIGHT 

02:28:33.608 --> 02:28:38.562
HAVE POINTED OUT TO US, YOU OR 
JAMES, THIS IS GOING TO SLOW 

02:28:38.765 --> 02:28:40.765
THINGS DOWN A LOT,

02:28:49.433 --> 02:28:51.907
AND AT THE TIME WHICH WHENEVER 
ONE OF OUR TEAM WAS DOING THAT, 

02:28:52.122 --> 02:28:54.172
I WAS DOING MENTAL CALCULATIONS 
ABOUT JUST HOW LONG THIS COULD 

02:28:54.374 --> 02:28:56.832
GO AND HOW FAR WE TEACHING IT 
IS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET 

02:28:57.034 --> 02:28:59.293
THE PROCESS PLAY OUT. WE ARE NOT
TRYING TO SHOVE THINGS ALONG 

02:28:59.497 --> 02:29:01.623
BUT, WE ARE NOW IN A HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND, SO HERE'S SATURDAY, 

02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:03.820
TOMORROW IS SUNDAY, THEN MONDAY 
IS PRESIDENTS' DAY, THE SENATE 

02:29:04.417 --> 02:29:09.610
HAD PLANNED TO BE OUT NEXT WEEK,
AND FRANKLY, WE DIDN'T 

02:29:09.811 --> 02:29:11.811
ANTICIPATE BEING HERE TOMORROW. 
SO WHAT ARE WE NOW THINKING 

02:29:11.875 --> 02:29:13.875
ABOUT THE TIMELINE AND WHAT 
COULD HAPPEN?

02:29:21.498 --> 02:29:23.761
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T KNOW IF I DIDN'T 
ANTICIPATE BEING HERE. WE JUST 

02:29:23.963 --> 02:29:26.430
NEVER KNOW HERE ON THE HILL. I 
CAN TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHEN 

02:29:26.645 --> 02:29:29.165
WE WALKED IN, IT WAS PRETTY DEAD
AND I FOUND PARKING EASILY WHICH

02:29:29.366 --> 02:29:32.043
IS ALWAYS A SIGN THAT IT'S NOT 
AS BUSY AS A WEEK THE WEEKDAY 

02:29:32.245 --> 02:29:35.529
AND EVEN HERE IN THE ROTUNDA ON 
THE SENATE SIDE, WHEN WE CAME IN

02:29:35.744 --> 02:29:37.744
THIS MORNING, IT WAS REALLY JUST
MYSELF AND OUR VIDEOGRAPHER, 

02:29:37.817 --> 02:29:39.679
JUSTIN, AND THERE WEREN'T MANY 
REPORTERS, IT LOOKED LIKE 

02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:41.680
EVERYBODY WAS TAKING THE DAY 
OFF, SO THERE WAS THE 

02:29:41.757 --> 02:29:43.757
SPECULATION THAT THIS WOULD BE 
ALL WRAPPED BROADER UP STORY 

02:29:43.954 --> 02:29:46.615
TODAY. ABOUT BUTTHE POWER 
STRUCTURE IN THE SENATE, RIGHT? 

02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:50.235
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THESE CORE 
SENATORS WHO ARE IN THAT 

02:29:50.996 --> 02:29:53.610
MODERATE COLUMN, ROMNEY, 
MURKOWSKI, COLLINS, THEY'RE 

02:29:54.066 --> 02:29:59.626
REALLY DRIVING DECISIONS HERE. 
THEY REALLY HAVE SOME POWER IN 

02:29:59.915 --> 02:30:02.965
THIS PROCEEDING, BUT AS WELL AS 
WHEN THE SENATE TAKES UP VOTES. 

02:30:03.235 --> 02:30:06.515
THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO 
BE, YOU KNOW, LOBBIED AND 

02:30:06.816 --> 02:30:10.475
WHIPPED TO GO ON ONE SIDE OR THE
OTHER WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY 

02:30:10.755 --> 02:30:13.645
CLOSE VOTES, AND I THINK WE'RE 
SEEING EVIDENCE OF THAT POIR 

02:30:13.915 --> 02:30:17.745
THAT IF AT ANY MOMENT ENOUGH OF 
THOSE IN THE MIDDLE WANT TO JOIN

02:30:18.035 --> 02:30:20.926
A DECISION OF THE MAJORITY OR 
THE MINORITY THAT THEY CAN 

02:30:21.205 --> 02:30:24.325
REALLY CHANGE THINGS AND SHIFT 
THINGS. SO I THINK THIS IS ALSO 

02:30:24.625 --> 02:30:27.645
EVIDENCE TOO OF WHAT THE POWER 
STRUCTURE IN THE SENATE LOOKS 

02:30:27.925 --> 02:30:30.505
LIKE RIGHT NOW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AARON BLAKE, LET'S GET YOU IN

02:30:30.795 --> 02:30:34.535
HERE ONE MORE TIME BEFORE WE LET
YOU GO. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS 

02:30:34.815 --> 02:30:38.690
ARE ON PAUSE IN THE SENATE RIGHT
NOW. BUT WHAT WE CAN EXPECT TO 

02:30:38.965 --> 02:30:41.805
BE HAPPENING IS THEY ARE 
FIGURING OUT WHO WANTS TO HEAR 

02:30:42.085 --> 02:30:44.345
FROM WHICH POTENTIAL WITNESSES, 
RIGHT, BECAUSE EVERYONE NEEDS TO

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:47.055
KNOW WHO'S REALLY DRIVING THIS 
TRAIN, PERHAPS AS MODERATE 

02:30:47.345 --> 02:30:49.595
SENATORS THAT RONDA WAS JUST 
TALKING ABOUT, AND WHO 

02:30:49.885 --> 02:30:53.425
SPECIFICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO 
WANT TO HEAR FROM:  SO PROBABLY 

02:30:54.505 --> 02:30:57.705
A LOT OF STRATEGIZING, HAMMERING
THINGS OUT, FIGURING THINGS OUT 

02:30:57.985 --> 02:31:01.415
BEHIND THE SCENES RIGHT NOW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. AND A LOT OF THIS IS 

02:31:01.705 --> 02:31:05.085
GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW THIS IS 
GOING TO TAKE PLACE. MICHAEL van

02:31:05.375 --> 02:31:07.835
der VEEN, THE TRUMP LAWYER 
EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE 

02:31:08.115 --> 02:31:10.925
PROPOSAL FROM JAMIE RASKIN TO 
HAVE THIS DEPOSITION TAKE PLACE 

02:31:11.215 --> 02:31:15.705
OVER A ZOOM CALL. I THINK van 
der VEEN AT ONE POINT SAID HE 

02:31:15.985 --> 02:31:19.465
NEEDED TO DO THESE DEPOSITIONS, 
AND HE NEEDED TO THEM IN HIS 

02:31:19.745 --> 02:31:21.765
OFFICE IN PHILADELPHIA. HE SAID 
PHILADELPHIA. SO, AGAIN, 

02:31:22.045 --> 02:31:25.445
RETURNING TO THE IDEA THAT THIS 
IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DRAWN 

02:31:25.725 --> 02:31:30.966
OUT IF DEMOCRATS DEMAND ON GOING
DOWN THIS PATH AND HAVING MORE 

02:31:31.485 --> 02:31:34.694
DETAILED, LESS CURSORY 
INTERVIEWS AND LESS QUICK 

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:38.235
INTERVIEWS THAN DEMOCRATS SEEM 
TO WANT, THAT'S GOING TO BE 

02:31:38.505 --> 02:31:41.365
SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO 
FIGURE OUT. BUT, OF COURSE, WE 

02:31:41.724 --> 02:31:45.259
HAVE A SITUATION WHICH DEMOCRATS
HAVE CONTROL OVER MUCH OF THIS 

02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:48.475
PROCESS. THEY ALSO HAVE TO 
BALANCE THAT AGAINST LOOKING 

02:31:49.275 --> 02:31:52.325
LIKE THEY ARE RAILROADING THE 
PRESIDENT OR BEING UNFAIR IN HOW

02:31:52.595 --> 02:31:55.675
MANY WITNESSES THEY'RE ALLOWING,
THINGS LIKE THAT. THIS IS ALL A 

02:31:55.955 --> 02:31:59.845
VERY DELICATE PROCESS THAT THEY 
NOW HAVE ENTERED INTO IN A 

02:32:00.455 --> 02:32:04.455
RATHER QUICK FASHION, A RATHER 
SURPRISING FASHION TO SOME 

02:32:04.735 --> 02:32:07.315
PEOPLE, AND NOW IT'S REALLY 
ABOUT FIGURING OUT ALL THE 

02:32:07.605 --> 02:32:11.159
DETAILS WHICH I THINK IS REALLY 
WHAT TODAY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT 

02:32:11.434 --> 02:32:14.955
WHICH IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
WE ALL EXPECTED IT TO BE ABOUT. 

02:32:15.255 --> 02:32:18.135
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AARON BLAKE, THANKS SO MUCH. 
MARCO RUBIO IS TWEETING RIGHT 

02:32:18.595 --> 02:32:22.005
NOW. HE SAYS THIS, NOW THAT WE 
ARE GOING TO HAVE WITNESSES, NO 

02:32:22.305 --> 02:32:25.734
ONE CAN CLAIM THIS IS A FAIR 
TRIAL UNLESS BOTH SIDES ARE NOW 

02:32:26.005 --> 02:32:28.555
ALLOWED TO CALL THEM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THAT'S THE HUGE THING. 

02:32:29.005 --> 02:32:30.954
YOU SEE THESE CONFERRING 
SENATORS, IT'S PRETTY 

02:32:30.955 --> 02:32:33.765
NOTEWORTHY. YOU ALWAYS CAN TELL 
WHO'S TALKING TO WHO, AND THAT'S

02:32:34.064 --> 02:32:36.924
MITCH McCONNELL TALKING TO A 
LAWYER THERE AND A GROUP OF 

02:32:37.204 --> 02:32:40.805
OTHER SENATORS. AND WHAT THEY'RE
TRYING TO DO IS KIND OF COME UP 

02:32:41.105 --> 02:32:44.395
WITH A DEAL, SOME KIND OF 
AGREEMENT. YOU KNOW, IT WAS 

02:32:44.785 --> 02:32:49.744
OBVIOUSLY A 55-45 VOTE. SO YOU 
NEED KIND OF A SEPARATE 

02:32:50.044 --> 02:32:53.040
ORGANIZING RESOLUTION IN TERMS 
OF CALLING WITNESSES. SO WHAT'S 

02:32:53.344 --> 02:32:57.465
PROBABLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND
WHY THIS DELAY COULD GO ON FOR A

02:32:57.744 --> 02:33:01.354
WHILE, THIS IS KIND OF A NATURAL
THING THAT HAPPENS IN TRIALS, IS

02:33:01.645 --> 02:33:03.915
BASICALLY THE PROSECUTION AND 
THE DEFENSE ARE NEGOTIATING SOME

02:33:04.204 --> 02:33:07.894
KIND OF TRADE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,
YOU KNOW, WHERE MAYBE IN 

02:33:08.175 --> 02:33:11.684
EXCHANGE FOR THE ONE WITNESS 
THEY GET, SOME OTHER WITNESS, 

02:33:12.019 --> 02:33:17.985
OR, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE 
YOUR SIDE CALL THREE WITNESSES. 

02:33:18.274 --> 02:33:21.674
YOU KNOW, AND PROCESS SORT OF 
DOES MATTER IN THE SENATE, BUT 

02:33:21.955 --> 02:33:24.864
IT ALSO IS SIGNIFICANT FOR 
OPTICS. OBVIOUSLY JAMIE RASKIN 

02:33:25.144 --> 02:33:28.335
JUST WANTS THE ONE WITNESS, AND 
THEN THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD AND 

02:33:29.134 --> 02:33:34.054
KIND OF DEAL WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR ISSUE. THE 

02:33:34.754 --> 02:33:37.714
REPUBLICANS HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE
IF THIS IS GOING TO GET DELAYED 

02:33:37.994 --> 02:33:42.084
AND IF THEIR PRESIDENTS' DAY 
WEEK IS GOING TO BE MESSED UP TO

02:33:42.365 --> 02:33:44.894
MAKE THIS AS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR 
DEMOCRATS AS POSSIBLE, BUT ALSO 

02:33:45.224 --> 02:33:48.675
TO GUM UP PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 
AGENDA TO KIND OF PORTRAY THIS 

02:33:48.954 --> 02:33:51.784
AS SOMEHOW SLOWING DOWN COVID 
RELIEF OR WHATEVER, EVEN THOUGH,

02:33:52.245 --> 02:33:55.524
AS YOU NOTED, THE SENATE WAS 
ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE OFF NEXT 

02:33:55.804 --> 02:33:58.084
WEEK. SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE 

02:33:58.364 --> 02:34:01.364
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT NOT JUST 
THE LEGAL STRATEGY HERE, BUT 

02:34:01.644 --> 02:34:04.724
ALSO THE POLITICAL SORT OF 
MESSAGING STRATEGY OF HOW DO YOU

02:34:05.004 --> 02:34:07.844
TALK ABOUT THIS. AND IT'S NOT 
JUST MARCO RUBIO. YOU'RE SEEING 

02:34:08.144 --> 02:34:11.026
LINDSAY GRAHAM ALSO TWEET, YOU 
KNOW, IF THEY'RE GOING TO DRAG 

02:34:11.304 --> 02:34:15.194
THIS OUT, WE'RE GOING TO DRAG IT
OUT A REALLY LONG TIME AND GRIND

02:34:15.474 --> 02:34:18.064
EVERYTHING TO A HALT AND 
ESSENTIALLY DOING WHAT YOU SAW 

02:34:18.334 --> 02:34:21.744
MICHAEL van der VEEN, THE TRUMP 
LAWYER, DO TO THREATEN TO CALL 

02:34:22.204 --> 02:34:24.844
100 WITNESSES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY. BUT THE QUESTION ABOUT 

02:34:25.144 --> 02:34:28.394
THAT, JAMES, BOTTOM LINE, YOU 
NEED A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO CALL A

02:34:28.664 --> 02:34:31.043
SPECIFIC WITNESS, RIGHT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. 

02:34:31.044 --> 02:34:38.754
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, YOU KNOW, PARTISAN PICKS,
I MEAN, YESTERDAY WE HEARD A 

02:34:39.023 --> 02:34:42.824
QUESTION BY MARCO RUBIO PUT 
FORTH TO THE ATTORNEYS THAT 

02:34:43.524 --> 02:34:46.264
DIDN'T SAY THE NAME HILLARY 
CLINTON BUT WAS ALL ABOUT 

02:34:46.544 --> 02:34:50.224
HILLARY CLINTON, LIKE I'M GOING 
TO PARAPHRASE HERE, BUT COULD IN

02:34:50.504 --> 02:34:53.314
THE FUTURE THIS SORT OF SNOWBALL
OF PARTISANSHIP CONTINUE AND WE 

02:34:53.604 --> 02:34:57.084
COULD AT SOME POINT SUBPOENA A 
SECRETARY OF STATE AND HAVE HER 

02:34:57.363 --> 02:35:01.604
-- A FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE 
AND HAVE HER COME BEFORE THE 

02:35:01.884 --> 02:35:04.714
CONGRESS. HILLARY CLINTON WAS 
THE NAME THAT HE WAS NOT SAYING.

02:35:04.994 --> 02:35:08.324
SO IF WE SEE PARTISAN ENGAGEMENT
AND THE REPUBLICANS TRY TO CALL,

02:35:08.614 --> 02:35:11.174
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO'S, LIKE, 
COMPLETELY OFF THE RADAR HERE 

02:35:11.459 --> 02:35:14.344
LIKE A HILLARY CLINTON AND THE 
DEMOCRATS TRY TO CALL SOMEONE, 

02:35:14.644 --> 02:35:17.654
LIKE LET'S SAY THEY WANT TO HEAR
FROM DONALD TRUMP, BUT 

02:35:17.954 --> 02:35:20.894
REPUBLICANS FEEL LIKE THAT IS 
JUST LIKE A NONSTARTER AND NOT 

02:35:21.174 --> 02:35:23.743
GOING TO HAPPEN, YOU KNOW, WHERE
DOES THAT GO? 

02:35:23.744 --> 02:35:27.374
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. SO IT ENDS UP -- 
TECHNICALLY THERE'S SOME 

02:35:27.854 --> 02:35:30.064
PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS. BUT 
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE 

02:35:30.344 --> 02:35:34.058
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT, LIKE, IF 
REPUBLICANS WANT TO CALL KAMALA 

02:35:34.344 --> 02:35:38.054
HARRIS AND ASK HER ABOUT WHEN 
SHE URGED PEOPLE ON TWITTER TO 

02:35:38.334 --> 02:35:41.134
DONATE TO A DEFENSE FUND FOR 
PEOPLE WHO WERE GETTING ARRESTED

02:35:41.413 --> 02:35:45.598
AS PART OF THE PROTESTS OVER THE
SUMMER AFTER GEORGE FLOYD WAS 

02:35:45.874 --> 02:35:48.624
KILLED WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT 
THE REPUBLICAN -- THE DEFENSE 

02:35:48.904 --> 02:35:51.173
LAWYERS FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT
MENTIONED, LIKE, EIGHT TIMES 

02:35:51.451 --> 02:35:54.914
YESTERDAY, THAT'S JUST NOT 
GERMANE AT ALL TO THE TRIAL. AND

02:35:55.204 --> 02:35:59.343
NO DEMOCRAT IS GOING TO VOTE TO 
CALL KAMALA HARRIS, AND, IN 

02:35:59.614 --> 02:36:03.324
FACT, YOU KNOW, SO YOU COULD 
HAVE 50 -- I MEAN, IT'S A 

02:36:03.613 --> 02:36:05.884
TIEBREAKING VOTE, SO THERE'S 
SOME WEIRD SCENARIO WHERE KAMALA

02:36:06.163 --> 02:36:10.663
HARRIS COULD HAVE TO COME BREAK 
THE TIE IF IT WAS A 50/50 SPLIT.

02:36:10.954 --> 02:36:13.944
BUT THE TRUTH IS PEOPLE LIKE 
MITT ROMNEY ARE SERIOUS MINDED 

02:36:14.234 --> 02:36:18.574
ABOUT THIS, AND ROMNEY'S NOT 
GOING TO PLAY ALONG WITH SOME --

02:36:18.854 --> 02:36:21.404
YOU KNOW, OF THE KIND OF 
PROCEDURAL GAMES THAT SOMEONE 

02:36:21.704 --> 02:36:25.393
LIKE TED CRUZ OR JOSH HAWLEY 
WOULD WANT TO PLAY. SO 

02:36:25.674 --> 02:36:28.284
ULTIMATELY THIS COULD END UP 
GETTING BOGGED DOWN, AND THERE 

02:36:28.753 --> 02:36:35.103
IS SOME KIND OF LEGAL OBLIGATION
OF FAIRNESS WHERE IF THERE ARE 

02:36:35.384 --> 02:36:39.194
PEOPLE -- THE TRUMP TEAM WANTS 
TO CALL THAT COULD BE 

02:36:39.484 --> 02:36:43.134
EXCULPATORY, IT COULD BE HARD TO
SAY NO TO THEM FOR SOME OF THE 

02:36:43.414 --> 02:36:46.303
DEMOCRATS. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT
THEY'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

02:36:46.594 --> 02:36:49.893
DO THAT. THE TRUMP DEFENSE 
LAWYERS COULD HAVE HAD DAN ASK 

02:36:50.204 --> 02:36:53.904
AVINO, THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER 
CADDY TURNED SOCIAL MEDIA GURU, 

02:36:54.203 --> 02:36:57.614
TURNED DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE CHIEF 
OF STAFF WHO WAS WITH TRUMP IN 

02:36:57.954 --> 02:37:01.594
THE ROOM WHEN ALL THIS WAS 
PLAYING OUT, YOU COULD HAVE DAN 

02:37:01.894 --> 02:37:05.818
ASK AVINO, YOU KNOW, IF THEY HAD
A GOOD STORY TO TELL, TRUMP'S 

02:37:06.159 --> 02:37:09.763
LAWYERS COULD SAY THEY WANTED 
HIM TO COME AND TALK ABOUT HOW 

02:37:10.303 --> 02:37:13.123
HORRIFIED DONALD TRUMP WAS THAT 
DAY. BUT HE WASN'T. SO THEY'RE 

02:37:13.403 --> 02:37:15.943
NOT EAGER TO HAVE SKAVINO 
TESTIFY. NOW, THE QUESTION THAT 

02:37:16.213 --> 02:37:19.033
WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST 
COUPLE MINUTES IS WHAT IF 

02:37:19.313 --> 02:37:23.653
DEMOCRATS SAY WE WANT DAN 
SKAVINO TO TESTIFY WHO WAS WITH 

02:37:23.933 --> 02:37:27.563
TRUMP WHILE ALL THIS WAS PLAYING
OUT, AND CABLE TV WAS ON AND HAD

02:37:27.833 --> 02:37:31.163
A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT WAS IN 
TRUMP'S MIND, SKAVINO WOULD NOT 

02:37:31.434 --> 02:37:34.713
WANT TO TESTIFY. HE WOULD BE A 
HOSTILE WITNESS. HE WOULD SAY 

02:37:34.993 --> 02:37:37.263
HIS COMMENTS WERE PROTECTED BY 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE HE 

02:37:37.546 --> 02:37:40.663
WAS GIVING THE PRESIDENT CANDID 
ADVICE. AND THEN YOU ACTUALLY 

02:37:40.943 --> 02:37:44.813
COULD END UP GOING INTO A COURT 
PROCEEDING, YOU KNOW, WHERE 

02:37:45.253 --> 02:37:48.543
BECAUSE CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN 
ROBERTS ISN'T OVERSEEING THIS, 

02:37:48.833 --> 02:37:52.233
IT GOES TO THE COURTS AND GETS 
BOGGED DOWN AND DRAGGED OUT, AND

02:37:52.513 --> 02:37:55.483
SO THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS DON'T 
WANT TO CALL PEOPLE FROM THE 

02:37:55.763 --> 02:38:00.573
WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE MATERIAL 
WITNESSES, AND, INSTEAD, THEY 

02:38:01.958 --> 02:38:06.283
WANT JAMIE HERRERA BEULLER WHO'S
NOT A WITNESS. JAMIE RASKIN WHEN

02:38:06.573 --> 02:38:09.683
HE WAS IN THE MARYLAND STATE 
SENATE BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED TO 

02:38:09.973 --> 02:38:13.633
CONGRESS, HE WAS FAMOUS FOR 
PLAYING MULTIPLE CHESS GAMES IN 

02:38:13.953 --> 02:38:16.223
THE BASEMENT OF THE STATE 
CAPITOL IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND, 

02:38:16.493 --> 02:38:20.273
AND HE WOULD GO PLAY CHESS AND 
BEAT ALL OF THEM. IT DOES FEEL 

02:38:20.553 --> 02:38:24.033
LIKE JAMIE IS TRYING TO PLAY 
SOME CHESS HERE, YOU KNOW, THAT 

02:38:24.313 --> 02:38:27.993
HE IS -- HE'S THOUGHT THROUGH 
KIND OF HOW THIS WOULD PLAY OUT 

02:38:28.276 --> 02:38:31.123
AND HOW THE REPUBLICANS WOULD 
LIKELY RESPOND TO WHAT HE TRIED 

02:38:31.413 --> 02:38:34.963
TO DO. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE 
TALKED TO HERRERA BEULLER BEFORE

02:38:35.263 --> 02:38:38.705
HE DID THIS SURPRISE THING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT 

02:38:39.353 --> 02:38:41.853
YOU OFF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE DO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE 

02:38:42.143 --> 02:38:44.843
DEMOCRATS  WHEN THEY WERE 
WALKING TO THE CHAMBER TWO 

02:38:45.123 --> 02:38:47.643
MINUTES BEFORE THIS STARTED SAID
THERE WEREN'T GOING TO BE 

02:38:47.913 --> 02:38:50.172
WITNESSES AND THEY'RE WORTH THE 
VOTES FOR WITNESSES. 

02:38:50.173 --> 02:38:52.703
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS IS KIND OF A MOVE, 

02:38:52.973 --> 02:38:56.554
THIS IS SORT OF A GAMBIT THAT 
RASKIN SORT OF SPRING IN SOME 

02:38:56.833 --> 02:38:58.542
WAYS ON EVEN THESE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS. 

02:38:58.543 --> 02:39:01.667
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT
OUT THAT JUST LIKE WE'VE SEEN 

02:39:01.943 --> 02:39:03.993
TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS COLLABORATING 
AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH 

02:39:04.272 --> 02:39:06.573
THE REPUBLICANS, JAMES, THE 
DEMOCRATS CAN ALSO HAVE 

02:39:06.863 --> 02:39:09.293
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, OF COURSE.

02:39:09.563 --> 02:39:11.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OF COURSE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT OUR COLLEAGUE ANNIE 

02:39:12.095 --> 02:39:16.073
LINSKY IS POINTING OUT ON 
TWITTER THIS, ANOTHER REMINDER 

02:39:16.358 --> 02:39:20.663
OF SOMEONE WHO COVERED RASKIN IN
THE MARYLAND STATEHOUSE, HE CAN 

02:39:20.953 --> 02:39:24.372
PLAY MULTIPLE GAMES OF CHESS AND
WIN THEM ALL. SO THIS IDEA OF 

02:39:24.653 --> 02:39:27.943
RASKIN PLAYING A GAME OF CHESS 
AND MAYBE NOT LOOPING IN THE 

02:39:28.223 --> 02:39:30.743
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN THE 
SENATE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE 

02:39:31.023 --> 02:39:33.823
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER'S JOB, AND 
SO THEY MAY BE DECIDING TO CARRY

02:39:34.093 --> 02:39:37.943
OUT THEIR JOB THE WAY THEY BEST 
SEE FIT. I DO WANT TO BRING 

02:39:38.213 --> 02:39:40.181
RHONDA COLVIN INTO THE 
CONVERSATION. WE'RE LEARNING 

02:39:40.182 --> 02:39:43.123
MORE ABOUT SORT OF HOW THE 
RELATIONSHIPS ON THE SENATE 

02:39:43.403 --> 02:39:47.433
FLOOR ARE PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW 
AND WHERE THE AREAS OF TENSION 

02:39:47.712 --> 02:39:52.863
ARE, AND WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR
COLLEAGUE KIM THAT THERE ARE 

02:39:54.515 --> 02:40:00.523
SOME REAL MOMENTS OF TENSION AND
ARGUMENT HAPPENING ON THE 

02:40:01.103 --> 02:40:04.703
FLOOR AS EVERYONE TRIES TO 
FIGURE OUT SORT OF WHAT THE NEXT

02:40:06.082 --> 02:40:08.532
STEPS FORWARD ARE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. AND I THINK THAT 

02:40:08.803 --> 02:40:12.813
ILLUSTRATES THAT THIS WAS A BIT 
UNANTICIPATED BY BOTH SIDES, 

02:40:13.193 --> 02:40:17.292
REALLY, THAT THEY PROBABLY WERE 
SETTING UP FOR A SHORTER DAY OR 

02:40:17.573 --> 02:40:22.942
AT LEAST A WRAPUP TO THIS TRIAL 
MOVING FORWARD. WE TALKED 

02:40:23.243 --> 02:40:26.118
EARLIER ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS HAVE
WANTED THIS TO NOT BE PROLONGED 

02:40:26.402 --> 02:40:29.987
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUT BIDEN'S
AGENDA BACK ON THE TABLE AND IN 

02:40:30.282 --> 02:40:33.204
THE FOREFRONT. BUT YOU SEE WHEN 
YOU HAVE THESE UNANTICIPATED 

02:40:33.522 --> 02:40:37.412
MOMENTS WHAT SENATORS HAVE TO DO
TO FIGURE OUT THEIR OWN NEXT 

02:40:37.692 --> 02:40:42.207
STEPS AND THEIR CAULK US' NEXT 
STEPS. I THINK THIS IS SO 

02:40:42.482 --> 02:40:45.092
INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS A 
DEVELOPING STORY THAT WE REALLY 

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:48.453
CAN'T FORECAST JUST YET UNTIL WE
GET SOME FURTHER DETAILS. BUT IT

02:40:48.733 --> 02:40:51.762
IS SHOWING THAT THIS WAS NOT 
VERY PLANNED AND THAT EVERYONE 

02:40:52.047 --> 02:40:56.033
SORT OF HAD THEIR IDEA OF HOW 
THIS DAY WAS GOING TO GO. SO IT 

02:40:56.302 --> 02:40:59.673
ALMOST SEEMS A BIT OF A SCRAMBLE
WHICH MAY BE GOOD AND BAD 

02:40:59.963 --> 02:41:03.582
BECAUSE IF IT'S A SCRAMBLE, YOU 
MAY NOT BE GIVING ENOUGH TIME TO

02:41:03.872 --> 02:41:06.942
WHAT CREDIBLE WITNESSES MAY HELP
YOUR SIDE. YOU MAY JUST WANT TO,

02:41:07.228 --> 02:41:11.062
YOU KNOW, PICK A FEW THAT MIGHT 
WORK FOR YOU AND GO WITH THAT, 

02:41:11.342 --> 02:41:13.603
BUT THEY MAY NOT BE YOUR 
STRONGEST TESTIMONIES, REALLY. 

02:41:13.882 --> 02:41:16.963
YOU KNOW, WE MENTIONED THAT THIS
COULD FORESEABLY BE A TIME WHERE

02:41:17.242 --> 02:41:20.722
YOU COULD SEE THEM CALLING IN 
CAPITOL OFFICERS WHO CAN DETAIL 

02:41:22.172 --> 02:41:24.922
WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED ON THE 
LEVEL OF THIS BEING A 

02:41:25.213 --> 02:41:27.762
PREMEDITATED ATTACK THAT STARTED
AS PEOPLE WERE COMING FROM THE 

02:41:28.062 --> 02:41:32.093
ELLIPSE. YOU CAN TALK TO 
STAFFERS WHO HAD TO BARRICADE. 

02:41:32.372 --> 02:41:35.502
YOU COULD ALSO BRING IN OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND THE 

02:41:35.792 --> 02:41:40.302
HOUSE TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY WENT 
THROUGH. SO THIS IS CERTAINLY --

02:41:40.582 --> 02:41:42.471
THE DETAILS ARE STILL COMING 
FORWARD. 

02:41:42.472 --> 02:41:46.152
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO NOW TO SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT PAUL

02:41:46.452 --> 02:41:51.652
CANE WHO JOIN US BY PHONE. PK, 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT 

02:41:51.924 --> 02:41:55.547
KIND OF A SURPRISE THIS MAY HAVE
ABOUT TO MEMBERS OF THIS SENATE 

02:41:55.828 --> 02:41:57.791
JURY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WAS JUST SORTING THROUGH 

02:41:57.792 --> 02:42:00.413
ALL THE REPORTING THAT ALL OF US
CONGRESSIONAL REPORTERS HAVE 

02:42:00.692 --> 02:42:06.152
BEEN DOING AND SHARING VIA POOL 
TO GIVE A SENSE OF HOW 

02:42:06.442 --> 02:42:09.502
SURPRISING THIS WAS. LET ME READ
THREE DIFFERENT SENATORS, ALL 

02:42:09.792 --> 02:42:16.193
FROM THE VERY LIBERAL END OF 
THINGS, YOU KNOW, VERY 

02:42:16.472 --> 02:42:19.272
ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRATIC SENATORS 
MOMENTS BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGAN. 

02:42:19.562 --> 02:42:25.132
SO BETWEEN 9:50 AND 10:00 A.M. 
DICKEN THAL OF CONNECTICUT. MY 

02:42:25.422 --> 02:42:28.662
ADVICE RIGHT NOW IS THIS CASE IS
SO POWERFUL, EVERYBODY KNOWS 

02:42:28.952 --> 02:42:32.162
THAT TRUMP DIDN'T GIVE A DAM 
ABOUT ANYBODY IN THIS BUILDING 

02:42:32.452 --> 02:42:35.872
OR AS VICE PRESIDENT EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS IN REAL DANGER. THE 

02:42:36.162 --> 02:42:39.257
EVIDENCE IS SO POWERFUL ALREADY 
IN THE RECORD. I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:42:39.532 --> 02:42:45.974
WE -- THAT THEY NEED THEM, THEY 
BEING THE MANAGERS, NEED THEM, 

02:42:46.422 --> 02:42:49.612
WITNESSES. MAZIE HIRONO OF 
HAWAII TO OUR "THE WASHINGTON 

02:42:49.902 --> 02:42:53.982
POST" MIKE DEBONUS. I THINK THEY
MADE SUCH A STRONG CASE. IF I 

02:42:54.262 --> 02:42:57.913
BROUGHT IN ADDITIONAL WITNESSES,
DOT, DOT, DOT, IF I THOUGHT THAT

02:42:58.192 --> 02:43:00.792
ANY FURTHER WITNESSES WOULD 
CHANGE ANY REPUBLICAN MINDS, I 

02:43:01.082 --> 02:43:07.562
SAY GO FOR IT, BUT I DON'T THINK
SO. ELIZABETH WARREN AROUND THE 

02:43:07.872 --> 02:43:13.052
SAME TIME, WHILE SAYING THAT SHE
WOULD DEFER TO HOUSE MANAGERS, 

02:43:13.332 --> 02:43:16.501
WARREN SAID I THINK THE CASE HAS
ALREADY BEEN MADE PRETTY CLEAR 

02:43:16.822 --> 02:43:20.162
THAT DONALD TRUMP KNEW WHAT HE 
WAS DOING AND INCITING A RIOT, 

02:43:20.452 --> 02:43:23.601
AND THAT HE WANTED PEOPLE TO 
RIOT. I THINK THIS IS FURTHER 

02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:26.432
EVIDENCE OF THAT. IT STRENGTHENS
A CASE THAT IS ALREADY 

02:43:26.712 --> 02:43:29.591
UNDENIABLE. THESE ARE THREE OF 
THE MOST LIBERAL SENATORS, VERY 

02:43:29.912 --> 02:43:34.161
ANTI-TRUMP SENATORS WHO CLEARLY 
AT 9:50, 9:55 A.M. WALKED ONTO 

02:43:34.482 --> 02:43:37.312
THE SENATE FLOOR BELIEVING THAT 
THERE WOULD BE NO WITNESSES 

02:43:37.602 --> 02:43:43.432
CALLED, AND THEY WOULD BE MOVING
TOWARD A FINAL VOTE TODAY AND 

02:43:43.717 --> 02:43:47.932
THAT THEY EXPECTED THE VOTE TO, 
YOU KNOW, HAVE A MAJORITY TO 

02:43:48.402 --> 02:43:54.651
CONVICT BUT NOT THE 2/3 MAJORITY
TO, YOU KNOW, FULLY CONVICT, AND

02:43:54.932 --> 02:43:59.212
THEY GOT THROWN A CURVE BALL. 
THERE WAS -- SOMETHING HAPPENED 

02:43:59.493 --> 02:44:04.241
TODAY, LAST NIGHT AND TODAY, AND
IT WAS A BREACH BETWEEN WHAT THE

02:44:04.662 --> 02:44:08.192
HOUSE MANAGERS AND SENATE 
LEADERSHIP. CHUCK SCHUMER REALLY

02:44:09.252 --> 02:44:12.372
MISMANAGED THIS ENTIRE PROCESS 
BY -- HE WANTED TO AVOID LOOKING

02:44:12.652 --> 02:44:18.121
LIKE HE WAS GOING SOFT ON TRUMP,
BUT SCHUMER REALLY JUST WANTS TO

02:44:18.401 --> 02:44:24.011
GET ON WITH THE DEMOCRATIC 
AGENDA. HE REALLY WANTS TO PASS 

02:44:24.292 --> 02:44:27.073
A LEGISLATIVE COVID RELIEF 
PACKAGE THAT WILL SEND CHECKS 

02:44:27.452 --> 02:44:32.591
DIRECTLY TO MOST AMERICAN 
VOTERS. AND HE GAVE A LINE TO 

02:44:33.392 --> 02:44:37.502
EVERYONE THAT OUR LINE WAS -- ON
WITNESSES, WE WILL DEFER TO THE 

02:44:37.782 --> 02:44:40.316
MANAGERS, WE'LL DEFER TO THE 
MANAGERS, WE'LL DEFER TO THE 

02:44:40.801 --> 02:44:43.421
MANAGERS, ALWAYS BELIEVING THAT 
THE MANAGERS WOULD IN TURN NOT 

02:44:43.692 --> 02:44:47.342
NEED WITNESSES BECAUSE THE CASE 
WOULD BE SO UNDENIABLE IN THE 

02:44:48.072 --> 02:44:53.572
WORDS OF SENATOR WARREN. BUT IN 
THE LAST 24 HOURS IT BECAME 

02:44:53.862 --> 02:44:58.572
INCREASINGLY CLEAR OVER AND OVER
AGAIN THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF 

02:44:58.871 --> 02:45:02.861
CONFUSION SURROUNDING WHAT 
DONALD TRUMP DID HIMSELF ABOUT 

02:45:03.572 --> 02:45:06.892
THIS INSURRECTION. THEY HAD 
NEVER GOTTEN TO THE CORE 

02:45:07.192 --> 02:45:10.892
QUESTION OF EVERY PRESIDENTIAL 
SCANDAL GOING BACK TO WATERGATE.

02:45:11.191 --> 02:45:17.932
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW, AND
WHEN DID HE KNOW IT? AND THAT 

02:45:18.231 --> 02:45:22.701
HAS BEEN THE DISPUTE. AND BILL 
CASSIDY OF LOUISIANA TOLD ME 

02:45:23.001 --> 02:45:26.331
YESTERDAY MORNING THAT WAS THE 
CENTRAL ISSUE FOR HIM. HE WANTED

02:45:26.602 --> 02:45:28.602
TO HAVE 

02:45:30.491 --> 02:45:33.271
THE QUESTION ANSWERED, DID THE 
PRESIDENT KNOW THAT THE VICE 

02:45:33.552 --> 02:45:37.902
PRESIDENT WAS, LIKE, STEPS AWAY 
FROM POTENTIAL MORTAL ROOMS? DID

02:45:38.182 --> 02:45:42.461
HE KNOW THAT THE SENATE WAS IN 
DANGER AND BEING EVACUATED? AND 

02:45:42.751 --> 02:45:45.512
THE TRIAL DEFENSE OF DONALD 
TRUMP, HIS LAWYERS GAVE A 

02:45:45.792 --> 02:45:49.131
TERRIBLE ANSWER TO THAT 
QUESTION. THEY GAVE NO ANSWER AT

02:45:49.451 --> 02:45:52.881
ALL. THEY LEFT IT COMPLETELY 
CONFUSED AND UP IN THE AIR AS TO

02:45:53.287 --> 02:45:58.031
WHETHER TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THIS --
YOU KNOW, KNEW THE DANGER OF 

02:45:58.812 --> 02:46:04.012
THIS ATTACK. AND THAT OPENED THE
DOOR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE 

02:46:04.466 --> 02:46:08.482
ANTI-TRUMP, INCLUDING JAMIE 
HERRERA BEUTLER OF WASHINGTON 

02:46:08.851 --> 02:46:12.721
STATE, A REPUBLICAN WHO VOTED TO
IMPEACH TRUMP, AND SHE BASICALLY

02:46:13.001 --> 02:46:17.171
HAD BEEN TELLING HER HOMETOWN 
PRESS FOR A FEW WEEKS ABOUT THIS

02:46:17.461 --> 02:46:21.951
CALL WITH KEVIN McCARTHY IN 
WHICH McCARTHY OUTLINED FOR 

02:46:22.273 --> 02:46:26.921
LAWMAKERS JUST HOW AWFUL TRUMP 
WAS TOWARD THE FEAR OF WHAT WAS 

02:46:27.201 --> 02:46:32.661
HAPPENING IN THE CAPITOL. ONCE 
THAT GOT RE -- ONCE IT WENT FROM

02:46:33.161 --> 02:46:37.461
THE SMALLTOWN WASHINGTON STATE 
PRESS INTO THE NATIONAL AND 

02:46:38.932 --> 02:46:43.291
INTERNATIONAL PRESS, IT BECAME 
THE MANAGERS WENT, OH, WAIT A 

02:46:43.572 --> 02:46:47.121
SECOND, WE NOW HAVE AN OBVIOUS 
WITNESS TO CALL. AND THAT SET UP

02:46:47.401 --> 02:46:49.911
THIS SCENARIO WHERE THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS COME IN TODAY SAYING, 

02:46:50.191 --> 02:46:53.781
YEAH, WE WANT A WITNESS. WE WANT
AT LEAST THIS ONE WITNESS, 

02:46:54.071 --> 02:46:56.071
CONGRESSWOMAN -- THE REPUBLICAN 
FROM 

02:46:59.711 --> 02:47:02.641
WASHINGTON STATE. BUT NOW -- 
THIS WAS A TOTALLY ORGANIC 

02:47:02.921 --> 02:47:05.801
MOMENT. THE DEMOCRATS WENT INTO 
THE FLOOR TODAY EXPECTING TO NOT

02:47:06.081 --> 02:47:09.701
EVEN VOTE ON WITNESSES, TO HAVE 
A MOTION THAT WOULD GO STRAIGHT 

02:47:10.221 --> 02:47:13.631
TO CLOSING ARGUMENTS. ONCE 
RASKIN STOOD UP AND ASKED FOR 

02:47:13.922 --> 02:47:16.881
WITNESSES, THEY WERE STUCK. THEY
WERE HAMSTRUNG BECAUSE SCHUMER 

02:47:17.161 --> 02:47:21.501
HAD SET THEM UP FOR WEEKS WITH 
THIS ANSWER OF WE WILL DEFER TO 

02:47:21.781 --> 02:47:26.481
THE MANAGERS, WE WILL DEFER TO 
THE MANAGERS. THE MANAGERS ASKED

02:47:26.781 --> 02:47:29.801
FOR WITNESSES, AND NOW THEY'VE 
GOT THEM, AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT 

02:47:30.091 --> 02:47:32.140
THE NEXT STEPS ARE IN THIS 
PROCESS. 

02:47:32.141 --> 02:47:35.231
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE NEXT 
STEPS ARE IN THIS PROCESS. PK, 

02:47:35.511 --> 02:47:39.411
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE 
CONGRESS HAVEFIGURED OUT, 

02:47:39.681 --> 02:47:42.891
EVERYTHING CHANGES. HOW LONG 
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS JOB? 

02:47:43.171 --> 02:47:47.041
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, IF YOU INCLUDE THE 37 
YEARS OR SO AT ROLL CALL, THIS 

02:47:47.313 --> 02:47:52.330
IS 20, 21 YEARS OF JUST FOCUSED 
ENTIRELY ON CONGRESS. 

02:47:52.331 --> 02:47:56.631
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND YOU CAN STILL SEE CURVE 
BALLS HAPPEN. SO, PK, IMPORTANT 

02:47:56.910 --> 02:48:01.951
TO REMIND OUR VIEWERS THAT EVEN 
THOUGH MICHAEL van der VEEN, 

02:48:02.451 --> 02:48:05.341
TRUMP'S LAWYER, THREATENED TO 
SUBPOENA 100 WITNESSES AND HAVE 

02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:11.091
THEM DRAGGED TO PHILADELPHIA TO 
BE DEPOSED, IT'S NOT UP TO HIM. 

02:48:11.391 --> 02:48:14.211
IT'S UP TO THE SENATE. THE 
SENATE GETS TO DECIDE WHICH 

02:48:14.501 --> 02:48:17.031
WITNESSES AND HOW MANY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THIS 

02:48:17.331 --> 02:48:22.791
IS UP TO THE SENATE NOW. AND IT 
ALWAYS WAS. I MEAN, WITH 

02:48:23.191 --> 02:48:27.651
SCHUMER'S MESSAGING LINE, THE 
REASON IT WAS SO STUPID WAS THAT

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:31.501
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN UP TO THE 
SENATORS. IT HAS NEVER BEEN UP 

02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:36.691
TO THE HOUSE MANAGERS. WITNESSES
ARE ALWAYS CALLED BY THE SENATE.

02:48:36.971 --> 02:48:39.771
THE SUBPOENAS, IF THEY DO BRING 
WITNESSES, ARE VOTED ON AND 

02:48:40.051 --> 02:48:44.161
APPROVED BY THE SENATE. SO IT IS
UP TO A MAJORITY OF THE SENATE 

02:48:44.441 --> 02:48:47.790
TO DECIDE WHAT WITNESSES THEY 
WANT. AND NOW THE REALITY IS YOU

02:48:48.501 --> 02:48:52.711
HAVE A GROUP OF 54 WHO HAVE 
VOTED AFFIRMATIVELY WITH THE 

02:48:53.021 --> 02:48:55.021
MANAGERS 

02:48:56.131 --> 02:48:59.181
TO CALL WITNESSES. THE 55th VOTE
IS LINDSAY GRAHAM. DISCOUNT 

02:48:59.470 --> 02:49:02.930
LINDSAY GRAHAM BECAUSE HE 
CHANGED HIS VOTE TO YES MERELY 

02:49:03.221 --> 02:49:08.511
BECAUSE HE'S ON TRUMP'S SIDE, 
AND GRAHAM WANTED -- THOUGHT 

02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:12.361
THAT MAYBE IF THIS WAS THE ONLY 
VOTE ON WITNESSES, HE WANTED TO 

02:49:12.652 --> 02:49:15.931
VOTE YES BECAUSE LINDSAY GRAHAM 
WANTS TO CALL 100 WITNESSES, 

02:49:16.491 --> 02:49:20.021
JUST LIKE THE TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM
DOES. SO NOW YOU HAVE THE OTHER 

02:49:21.231 --> 02:49:27.431
54 WHO VOTED YES ARE ESSENTIALLY
THEIR OWN PORTION OF THE JURY 

02:49:27.711 --> 02:49:33.014
POOL. THEY GET TO DECIDE WHAT 
WITNESSES WILL COME FORWARD NOW.

02:49:33.291 --> 02:49:37.521
THEY CAN -- WE COULD HAVE LIKE A
SLOW PROCESS WHEREBY THEY VOTE 

02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.871
ONE BY ONE, OR THEY COULD 
ESSENTIALLY PASS A NEW 

02:49:42.141 --> 02:49:47.695
RESOLUTION THAT WOULD GOVERN THE
REST OF THE TRIAL, AND IT COULD 

02:49:47.981 --> 02:49:53.051
SPECIFY HOW MANY WITNESSES ARE 
GOING TO BE CALLED, IS IT JUST 

02:49:53.331 --> 02:49:59.480
HERRERA BEUTLER, ARE THERE A FEW
OTHERS? I THINK WE ARE STUCK 

02:49:59.881 --> 02:50:04.271
HERE WHERE NOBODY -- YOU KNOW, 
USUALLY YOU HAVE THIS PLANNED 

02:50:04.551 --> 02:50:07.960
OUT SO THAT YOU KNEW GOING IN 
YOU WERE GOING TO GET WITNESSES,

02:50:08.381 --> 02:50:11.701
SO THERE ALREADY WOULD HAVE BEEN
A RESOLUTION DRAFTED, AND, YOU 

02:50:11.981 --> 02:50:18.430
KNOW, YOU'D MOVE TO THAT RIGHT 
NOW. BUT BECAUSE THIS IS, LIKE, 

02:50:19.031 --> 02:50:22.785
REALLY UNKNOWN THEATER, YOU'RE 
STUCK, AND THEY HAVE TO -- THIS 

02:50:23.061 --> 02:50:30.771
COULD TAKE HOURS TODAY TO MAP 
OUT THE NEXT STEPS. AND, YOU 

02:50:31.050 --> 02:50:34.701
KNOW, THERE'S A SHORT OPTION 
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, DESIGNATE A 

02:50:35.611 --> 02:50:39.851
COUPLE OF SENATORS TO OVERSEE 
JUST ONE OR TWO DEPOSITIONS 

02:50:40.131 --> 02:50:46.570
WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID IN 1999, 
TWO SENATORS AND THE HOUSE 

02:50:46.990 --> 02:50:49.751
MANAGERS AND THE BILL CLINTON 
DEFENSE TEAM WENT AND DEPOSED 

02:50:50.190 --> 02:50:56.730
THREE WITNESSES. IT TOOK A WEEK 
TO DO. OR THE OTHER OPTION IS --

02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:00.530
AND THIS WOULD TAKE CONSENSUS 
FROM REPUBLICANS TO DO, AND I'M 

02:51:00.810 --> 02:51:04.600
NOT SURE THEY'LL AGREE TO GET 
ALONG, TO GO ALONG WITH THIS, 

02:51:04.890 --> 02:51:08.670
THE OTHER OPTION IS THEY COULD 
HAVE DONE AT THE OUTSET OF THIS 

02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:13.290
TRIAL, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TO SIMPLY FORM A TRIAL COMMITTEE

02:51:13.570 --> 02:51:18.010
AND AT THE OUTSET AND LET THEM 
DO ALL THE LEGAL WORK AND ALL 

02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:21.260
THE DEPOSITIONS AND EVERYTHING 
FROM THE BEGINNING WHILE THE 

02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:25.370
REST OF THE SENATE WENT ABOUT 
DOING ITS BUSINESS AND THEN HAVE

02:51:25.649 --> 02:51:31.450
THE TRIAL COMMITTEE COME IN AND 
PRESENT ALL OF THE DEPOSITIONS 

02:51:32.090 --> 02:51:35.359
AND WITNESSES' TESTIMONY, VIDEO 
TESTIMONY IF THEY NEED ANY OF 

02:51:35.639 --> 02:51:38.820
IT, THEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT 
FROM THE OUTSET. THAT'S WHERE IT

02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:43.250
OFTEN HAS BEEN DONE IN JUDICIAL 
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS. BUT NOW, YOU

02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:47.650
KNOW, YOU'RE STUCK. THE TRIAL 
HAS ALREADY BEGUN. TO PAUSE THE 

02:51:47.939 --> 02:51:51.529
TRIAL AND TO MOVE INTO ANY SORT 
OF LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS, THEY 

02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:56.180
HAVE TO HAVE A CONSENT 
AGREEMENT, AND I DON'T THINK 

02:51:56.459 --> 02:52:01.970
REPUBLICANS AT THIS STAGE 
PROBABLY WON'T AGREE TO THAT 

02:52:02.369 --> 02:52:06.589
BECAUSE THEY WOULD CONSENT TO GO
BACK INTO LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS. 

02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:11.429
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PARTISAN 
$1.9 TRILLION COVID RELIEF BILL.

02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:17.559
SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO 
LET THE DEMOCRATS MOVE TO THAT 

02:52:18.039 --> 02:52:21.679
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. I THINK WE 
COULD BE STUCK HERE IN LIMBO FOR

02:52:22.599 --> 02:52:24.558
A BIT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR CONGRESSIONAL 

02:52:24.559 --> 02:52:27.115
CORRESPONDENT PAUL KANE, THANK 
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, 

02:52:27.409 --> 02:52:29.969
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AND YOU 
CAN CONTINUE TO READ THE 

02:52:30.269 --> 02:52:32.729
REPORTING OF PK AND ALL OF OUR 
OTHER CONGRESSIONAL 

02:52:33.009 --> 02:52:36.059
CORRESPONDENTS, SOME OF WHOM ARE
ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW AT 

02:52:36.379 --> 02:52:39.229
WASHINGTONPOST.COM. WE DO HAVE 
AN ONGOING LIVE BLOG, AND WE'LL 

02:52:39.499 --> 02:52:42.929
CONTINUE TO BRING YOU LATEST IN 
JUST WHAT THEY ARE SHARING WITH 

02:52:43.209 --> 02:52:46.299
US. RHONDA COLVIN, YOU KNOW, WE 
ARE HEARING THIS FROM OUR 

02:52:46.579 --> 02:52:49.549
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
BE INSIDE THE SENATE CHAMBER 

02:52:50.069 --> 02:52:53.339
THAT SENATORS INCLUDING ROMNEY 
AND RON JOHNSON OF WISCONSIN 

02:52:53.619 --> 02:52:58.429
WERE IN A HEATED ARGUMENT AS 
THIS CALL FOR WITNESSES THREW 

02:52:59.839 --> 02:53:04.419
EVERYTHING INTO CHAOS. SO THIS 
WAS AS PAUL KANE JUST SHARED 

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:08.649
WITH US A CURVE BALL. YOU KNOW, 
DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING TO ADJUST, 

02:53:08.929 --> 02:53:13.019
BUT ALSO REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING 
TO SCRAMBLE AND ADJUST RIGHT 

02:53:13.479 --> 02:53:15.479
NOW, RHONDA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND OF COURSE 

02:53:15.729 --> 02:53:18.839
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FOCUS OF 
THEIR ARGUMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. 

02:53:19.119 --> 02:53:22.009
BUT IT DOES SHOW YOU HOW 
UNANTICIPATED THIS WAS. AND I 

02:53:22.288 --> 02:53:25.459
KEEP SAYING THAT, AND ALSO THIS 
LONG PAUSE IS ALSO ILLUSTRATING 

02:53:25.819 --> 02:53:29.319
THAT POINT TOO, THAT EVERYONE IS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT 

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:32.379
MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THEY 
THOUGHT THEY HAD THE DAY ALREADY

02:53:32.659 --> 02:53:35.829
FIGURED OUT. I THINK 
REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW, MAY 

02:53:36.109 --> 02:53:39.069
DIRECT SOME ANGER TOWARD MR. 
ROMNEY, AS WELL AS THE OTHER 

02:53:39.348 --> 02:53:43.098
REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED TO CALL 
WITNESSES BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, 

02:53:43.378 --> 02:53:47.199
THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE WISH 
OF THE CAUCUS. HOWEVER, YOU ALSO

02:53:47.479 --> 02:53:50.888
HAD LINDSAY GRAHAM A PART OF 
THAT VOTE TOO. SO I THINK RIGHT 

02:53:51.169 --> 02:53:54.552
NOW THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO 
READJUST, REFIGURE OUT WHAT THE 

02:53:56.752 --> 02:54:00.141
NEXT FEW DAYS LOOK LIKE, AND I 
THINK THE REPUBLICANS LEFT LAST 

02:54:00.421 --> 02:54:02.991
NIGHT -- AT LEAST THE 
REPUBLICANS WHO HAD SAID THEY 

02:54:03.281 --> 02:54:07.806
WERE OPPOSED TO CONVICTION, THEY
LEFT LAST NIGHT FEELING THAT THE

02:54:08.091 --> 02:54:11.971
DEFENSE TEAM DID A PRETTY GOOD 
JOB AT SORT OF CHANGING THE 

02:54:12.252 --> 02:54:17.651
TONE, THAT THE SENATE SENT A FEW
DAYS THIS WEEK AND REALLY 

02:54:17.962 --> 02:54:20.241
EMOTIONALLY GRAPPLING WITH THE 
IMAGES THAT THE IMPEACHMENT 

02:54:20.531 --> 02:54:23.081
MANAGERS SHARED, AND THEN 
YESTERDAY WE HAD A VERY QUICK 

02:54:23.361 --> 02:54:26.971
DEFENSE ARGUMENT THAT THIS WAS 
ABOUT FIRST SPEECH AND NOT ABOUT

02:54:27.251 --> 02:54:32.281
WHAT TRUMP WAS DOING AFTER OR 
DURING THE RIOT, IT'S ABOUT THE 

02:54:32.571 --> 02:54:35.691
BEGINNING AND THE PROVOKING. SO 
I THINK REPUBLICANS FELT THAT 

02:54:35.981 --> 02:54:39.611
THEY COULD LEAVE ON A NOTE OF 
THIS IS ALREADY SUMMED UP, BUT 

02:54:39.891 --> 02:54:43.281
THIS IS SUCH A CURVE BALL. AND I
THINK THAT ARGUMENT THAT OUR 

02:54:43.571 --> 02:54:46.341
COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING IS 
HAPPENING OR THOSE TENSE WORDS 

02:54:46.621 --> 02:54:50.381
BETWEEN ROMNEY AND OTHERS IS 
JUST EVIDENCE THAT NO ONE WAS 

02:54:50.671 --> 02:54:53.721
REALLY PREPARED FOR THIS, AND IT
IS FORCING THE REPUBLICANS TO 

02:54:54.032 --> 02:54:57.611
FIGURE OUT THE NEXT BEST STEPS 
BECAUSE IF WE HAD ENDED TODAY, 

02:54:57.891 --> 02:55:02.431
IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE AN 
ACQUITTAL, AND A QUICK 

02:55:02.711 --> 02:55:06.111
ACQUITTAL. BUT NOW EVEN THAT 2/3
VOTE MIGHT STILL BE HARD TO GET 

02:55:06.401 --> 02:55:09.801
TO, THIS IS AT LEAST SHOWING 
THAT WITNESSES COULD BRING IN A 

02:55:10.101 --> 02:55:14.039
WHOLE NEW ELEMENT TO THIS TRIAL 
THAT WAS UNEXPECTED. 

02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:18.541
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES HOMAN, YOU KNOW, WE CAN
ASSUME THAT RON JOHNSON IS 

02:55:18.821 --> 02:55:21.521
FRUSTRATED WITH MITT ROMNEY 
BECAUSE HE'S ONLY ONE OF A 

02:55:21.871 --> 02:55:24.814
HANDFUL OF REPUBLICANS WHO SIDED
WITH DEMOCRATS TO OPEN THE DOOR 

02:55:25.091 --> 02:55:27.991
TO CALLING WITNESSES, RIGHT? SO 
ROMNEY IS DEPARTING FROM THE 

02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:32.581
REPUBLICAN GAME PLAN HERE. BUT 
YOU HAVE TO WONDER, YOU KNOW, 

02:55:32.901 --> 02:55:35.491
WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY REALLY IS 
THIS? BECAUSE TRUMP'S LAWYERS 

02:55:35.771 --> 02:55:38.321
COULD HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER SOME 
OF THESE ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS 

02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:42.241
WHICH WE KNEW GOING INTO 
YESTERDAY'S PRESENTATION BY THEM

02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:45.600
THAT REPUBLICANS HAD. THEY ALSO 
COULD HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER THE 

02:55:45.890 --> 02:55:50.620
QUESTIONS IN THE Q&amp;amp;A PERIOD, THE
ACTUAL Q&amp;amp;A PERIOD. BUT THEY 

02:55:50.898 --> 02:55:54.410
DIDN'T. THEY EITHER OBJECT FEW 
SKATED, CHANGED -- OBJECT VIEW 

02:55:54.700 --> 02:55:57.400
SKATED, CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND 
WHAT THEY CALLED A QUICK 

02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:00.390
TIMELINE AND LACK OF DISCOVERY 
FOR THEIR OWN INABILITY TO 

02:56:00.661 --> 02:56:02.980
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT DONALD 
TRUMP'S ACTIVITIES AND STATE OF 

02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:05.359
MIND. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, LIBBY. THIS IS WHAT 

02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:08.210
HAPPENS WHEN YOU HIRE A PERSONAL
INJURY LAWYER TO REPRESENT YOU 

02:56:08.490 --> 02:56:10.660
IN AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. THESE 
PEOPLE AREN'T CONSTITUTIONAL 

02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:13.500
SCHOLARS. THEY'VE NEVER PLAYED 
AT THIS LEVEL. YOU KNOW, THEY 

02:56:13.780 --> 02:56:16.610
LITERALLY DO KIND OF AMBULANCE 
CHASING STUFF. THEY HAVE 

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:20.270
BILLBOARDS AND RUN TV CUSTOMER 
SALS IN PHILADELPHIA SAYING IF 

02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:23.540
YOU HAVE BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT,
CALL US. THESE AREN'T 

02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:26.070
IMPEACHMENT LAWYERS. THESE 
AREN'T THE EXPERTS AT THIS. AND 

02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:34.317
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THEIR 
STRATEGY YESTERDAY, NOT THE 

02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:38.880
LERCHT OF THEIR DEFENSE, BUT THE
STONEWALLING OF THIS CREATED 

02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:42.240
THIS SITUATION. IF THEY HAD 
GIVEN SOME KIND OF TIMELINE, IF 

02:56:42.519 --> 02:56:45.379
THEY HAD GIVEN SOME DETAIL ON 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING, 

02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:48.500
EVEN IF THEY HAD EMPHASIZED THE 
THINGS THE PRESIDENT DID DO 

02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:53.820
LATER IN THE DAY, ALL OF THAT 
WOULD HAVE SORT OF PREVENTED 

02:56:54.100 --> 02:56:59.370
THIS FROM BECOMING A BIG ISSUE. 
BUT THEIR SORT OF REFUSAL TO SAY

02:56:59.650 --> 02:57:01.650
ANYTHING, THEIR ATTACKS ON THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

02:57:01.930 --> 02:57:07.360
CLEARLY IN SOME WAYS PROVOKED 
PEOPLE LIKE RASKIN TO SAY, OKAY,

02:57:07.650 --> 02:57:10.240
WELL, THEN LET'S CALL A 
REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS AS

02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:13.670
A WITNESS IF THAT'S THE ARGUMENT
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE. AND 

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.990
THEN I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY 
STONEWALLED SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT

02:57:17.279 --> 02:57:19.883
CAME TO THESE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS WHO WERE ON THE FENCE, 

02:57:20.432 --> 02:57:23.799
REFUSING TO GIVE ANYTHING TO 
SUSAN COLLINS OR LISA MURKOWSKI 

02:57:24.150 --> 02:57:28.170
ON MITT ROMNEY, ALL THREE OF 
WHOM ASKED VARIATIONS OF THE 

02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:31.580
QUESTION, WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT
KNOW, WHEN DID HE KNOW IT, WHAT 

02:57:31.859 --> 02:57:35.929
DID HE DO? AND BY NOT ENGAGING 
AT ALL, THEY HAVE LED THE 

02:57:36.209 --> 02:57:39.350
GROUNDWORK NOW FOR THERE TO BE 
DISCOVERY FOR THESE QUESTIONS TO

02:57:39.629 --> 02:57:43.470
BE ANSWERED. AND THAT'S WHY YOU 
HEARD MICHAEL van der VEEN -- 

02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:46.915
YOU KNOW, HE WAS CLEARLY CAUGHT 
OFF GUARD SAYING ITS IRRELEVANT 

02:57:47.189 --> 02:57:52.919
WHAT TRUMP DID AFTER THE MOB 
BREACHED THE CAPITOL WHICH IS AN

02:57:53.209 --> 02:58:00.259
ARGUMENT THAT IS -- YOU KNOW, NO
ONE WOULD SAY MAKES SENSE. 

02:58:00.260 --> 02:58:04.599
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND MOST IMPORTANTLY MAY NOT 
MAKE SENSE TO THOSE REPUBLICANS 

02:58:05.149 --> 02:58:07.959
WHO ARE GENUINELY TRYING TO 
GRAPPLE WITH THE QUESTION OF 

02:58:08.259 --> 02:58:11.099
SHOULD THEY VOTE TO CONVICT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

02:58:11.379 --> 02:58:13.379
FOR HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS. THEY HAVE ASKED 

02:58:13.619 --> 02:58:17.759
SPECIFICALLY FOR CLARIFICATION 
OF THE TIMELINE OF WHAT TRUMP 

02:58:18.049 --> 02:58:21.538
WAS DOING IN THOSE HOURS AFTER 
THE ATTACK BEGAN TO UNFOLD. 

02:58:21.539 --> 02:58:24.899
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S WILD IS
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, SO 

02:58:25.179 --> 02:58:29.189
OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST
LEGAL TEAM. THE FIRST LEGAL TEAM

02:58:29.459 --> 02:58:34.839
WAS THE THREE LAWYERS FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA WHO QUIT TWO WEEKENDS 

02:58:35.159 --> 02:58:38.974
AGO. BUT ALREADY THESE LAWYERS 
COST BILL CASSIDY WHO WAS 

02:58:39.279 --> 02:58:42.019
PLANNING TO VOTE THAT THE TRIAL 
WASN'T CONSTITUTIONAL, COULDN'T 

02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:45.159
MOVE FORWARD, AND THEN CHANGED 
HIS VOTE BECAUSE OF THE POOR 

02:58:45.439 --> 02:58:49.469
QUALITY OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL
DEFENSE. YOU KNOW, IN A REAL 

02:58:49.749 --> 02:58:53.119
COURT OF LAW, IN A TRADITIONAL 
COURT OF LAW, YOU WOULD BE ABLE 

02:58:53.398 --> 02:58:56.219
TO ARGUE THAT YOU GOT BAD 
COUNSEL AS GROUNDS FOR AN 

02:58:56.509 --> 02:58:59.389
APPEAL. YOU CAN'T ARGUE THAT IN 
AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. BUT 

02:59:00.189 --> 02:59:04.629
THERE'S NO DISPUTING THAT TRUMP 
HAS BEEN POORLY SERVED BY BAD 

02:59:04.899 --> 02:59:10.629
LAWYERING, AND THAT THAT IS NOW 
POTENTIALLY PUT HIM IN JEOPARDY.

02:59:10.899 --> 02:59:13.419
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
REPUBLICANS -- ONCE YOU OPEN 

02:59:13.698 --> 02:59:19.374
THIS BOX, ONCE YOU HAVE MORE 
WITNESSES WHO REALLY COULD SPEAK

02:59:20.789 --> 02:59:24.529
TO THE PRESIDENT'S CALLOUSNESS 
ON JANUARY 6th THAT COULD 

02:59:24.809 --> 02:59:28.858
ESTABLISH HIS DEER LEX OF DUTY, 
YOU COULD LOSE A FEW 

02:59:32.238 --> 02:59:34.779
AND SO IT'S AMAZING THAT EVERY 
LAWYER WOULD BE TYPICALLY 

02:59:35.069 --> 02:59:37.588
THRILLED AT THE CHANCE TO 
REPRESENT A CLIENT WHO ALMOST 

02:59:37.869 --> 02:59:40.928
CERTAINLY CAN'T LOSE IN COURT, 
YOU KNOW, THEY ONLY HAD TO GET 

02:59:41.638 --> 02:59:44.858
34 REPUBLICANS. BUT IN THIS CASE
THEY'RE LITERALLY IN REAL TIME 

02:59:45.148 --> 02:59:49.328
WATCHING THEMSELVES LOSE MEMBERS
OF THE JURY OR AT LEAST ALIENATE

02:59:49.608 --> 02:59:51.608
THEM. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE'VE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON 

02:59:51.849 --> 02:59:55.058
THE LBJ ROOM ON CAPITOL HILL. 
THAT IS WHERE TRUMP'S TEAM HAS 

02:59:55.338 --> 02:59:58.978
BEEN PREPARING. SO JUST A LITTLE
WHILE AGO WE SAW THE DEFENSE 

02:59:59.248 --> 03:00:03.248
TEAM LEAVE THAT LBJ ROOM. AND 
THEY DID NOT STOP FOR COMMENT. 

03:00:03.518 --> 03:00:08.118
BUT WHEN ASKED ABOUT WITNESSES, 
BRUCE CASTOR SAYS THEY'LL 

03:00:13.138 --> 03:00:15.138
CALL LOTS. 

03:00:19.708 --> 03:00:22.548
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BRUCE CASTOR TELLING A 
JOURNALIST THEY WILL CALL LOTS. 

03:00:22.828 --> 03:00:26.128
A REMINDER, THOUGH, THAT IT'S 
NOT UP TO THEM. THEY CAN PROPOSE

03:00:26.398 --> 03:00:29.758
WHO THEY'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM AND
PUT NAMES OUT THERE, BUT, RHONDA

03:00:30.068 --> 03:00:32.868
COLVIN, IT'S ULTIMATELY UP TO 
THE SENATORS IN THIS ROOM, THE 

03:00:33.148 --> 03:00:37.318
JURY TO DECIDE SPECIFICALLY 
WHICH WITNESSES THEY DEEM 

03:00:37.598 --> 03:00:39.798
RELEVANT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S CORRECT. AND ALSO 

03:00:40.088 --> 03:00:42.917
EARLIER WHEN RIGHT BEFORE THEY 
TOOK THAT VOTE, IF YOU REMEMBER 

03:00:43.188 --> 03:00:47.628
MR. van der VEEN TALKED ABOUT 
THIS IS NOT A CIVIC PROCESS, AND

03:00:47.908 --> 03:00:50.988
HE WAS SORT OF ATTACKING THE 
PROCESS OR EVEN THE IDEA OF 

03:00:51.278 --> 03:00:54.878
BRINGING IN WITNESSES, AND THAT 
IS -- LIKE JAMES JUST POINTED 

03:00:55.158 --> 03:00:58.378
OUT, IT IS A REMINDER THAT THESE
ARE NOT CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS, 

03:00:58.658 --> 03:01:03.458
THEY AREN'T MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE, HAVEN'T BEEN BEFORE, AND

03:01:03.858 --> 03:01:07.308
THEY ARE ATTACKING A PROCESS 
THAT WAS SET UP BY THE SENATE. 

03:01:07.588 --> 03:01:11.028
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 
PROCEEDING, AND IT DOESN'T GO BY

03:01:11.318 --> 03:01:14.662
THE RULES OF SUCH. IT GOES BY 
RULES THAT WERE AGREED UPON BY 

03:01:14.948 --> 03:01:18.278
BOTH PARTIES. THEY WERE VOTED ON
JUST THIS PAST MONDAY AND PASSED

03:01:18.558 --> 03:01:21.597
AS THE RULES OF THIS 
IMPEACHMENT. AND A PART OF THE 

03:01:21.868 --> 03:01:24.417
RULES WERE THAT THEY WOULD AFTER
THE OPENING ARGUMENTS CONCLUDED 

03:01:24.697 --> 03:01:27.397
WOULD VOTE ON WITNESSES. AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT 

03:01:27.678 --> 03:01:31.318
NOW. BUT THAT DOES -- THAT DID 
STAND OUT TO ME AS SORT OF 

03:01:31.608 --> 03:01:34.688
SEEING HIS FRAME OF MIND AND 
THINKING THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE 

03:01:34.978 --> 03:01:37.408
ANTICIPATED JAMIE RASKIN'S MOVE 
THERE, EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENSE 

03:01:37.687 --> 03:01:40.458
TEAM DID SAY THEY'D CALL 
WITNESSES IF THAT'S WHAT THE 

03:01:40.737 --> 03:01:43.827
SENATE WANTED. BUT IT JUST 
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS PART OF 

03:01:44.113 --> 03:01:47.367
THEIR THINKING OF HOW THIS DAY 
WOULD PLAY OUT TODAY. SO THEY 

03:01:47.647 --> 03:01:50.418
SAY THEY'RE GOING TO BRING LOTS 
OF WITNESSES. THAT'S PROBABLY AN

03:01:50.717 --> 03:01:53.507
ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
HEAR A LOT BECAUSE THAT ALSO 

03:01:53.787 --> 03:01:56.578
APPEALS TO SOME OF THESE 
SENATORS WHO WANT TO WRAP THIS 

03:01:56.848 --> 03:02:00.098
UP VERY QUICKLY. AND WE HEARD 
ONE OF TRUMP'S LAWYERS EVEN SAY 

03:02:00.377 --> 03:02:03.857
WE'RE GOING TO WRAP UP SOON 
BECAUSE WE WANT YOU ALL TO GET 

03:02:04.137 --> 03:02:07.977
BACK TO THE COVID RELIEF BILL. 
AND SO I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

03:02:08.267 --> 03:02:11.467
USE THAT AS AN ARGUMENT, SAYING,
WELL, NOW IF WE'RE OPENING UP 

03:02:11.737 --> 03:02:14.567
WITNESSES, WE'RE JUST GOING TO 
BRING A LOT THROUGH HERE AND 

03:02:14.847 --> 03:02:17.627
PROLONG THIS AND TRY TO TIRE OUT
THE SENATE BEFORE ANYTHING 

03:02:18.087 --> 03:02:20.627
HAPPENS. BUT IT DOES, AGAIN, 
JUST UNDERSCORE THAT BOTH SIDES 

03:02:20.927 --> 03:02:23.847
WERE PROBABLY UNPREPARED FOR 
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE TODAY. 

03:02:24.127 --> 03:02:27.477
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M LOOKING AT OUR MONITOR TO
SEE WHO'S DOING WHAT AT THIS 

03:02:27.757 --> 03:02:30.495
MOMENT. JOURNALISTS ARE TAKING A
PHOTOGRAPH THERE. AND I SEE 

03:02:30.797 --> 03:02:34.157
FRANK THORP, ONE OF THE 
JOURNALISTS WHO'S THERE IN THAT 

03:02:35.277 --> 03:02:38.057
SCRUM. YOU KNOW, RHONDA, IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE 

03:02:38.337 --> 03:02:41.017
HILL REPORTERS HAVE REALLY JUST 
DONE AN IMPRESSIVE JOB OF 

03:02:41.317 --> 03:02:43.317
COLLABORATING AND WORKING 
TOGETHER DURING THIS 

03:02:43.457 --> 03:02:45.462
UNPRECEDENTED, DIFFICULT TIME 
COVERING CAPITOL HILL DURING 

03:02:45.737 --> 03:02:49.337
THESE COVID SAFETY PROTOCOLS. 
AND SO WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF 

03:02:49.757 --> 03:02:52.667
GREAT POOLED INFORMATION AND 
JOURNALISTS CYCLE THROUGH AND 

03:02:52.947 --> 03:02:56.861
TAKING TURNS OF BEING IN 
IMPORTANT PLACES OF RELEVANCE, 

03:02:57.147 --> 03:03:01.167
BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THE HUGE 
SCRUMS OF REPORTERS THAT WE HAVE

03:03:01.667 --> 03:03:04.217
ALL GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO ON 
CAPITOL HILL BECAUSE OF SAFETY 

03:03:04.497 --> 03:03:07.027
ISSUES RIGHT NOW. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. IF THIS WAS A 

03:03:07.316 --> 03:03:10.387
PRE-COVID ERA, WOULD YOU SEE FAR
MORE REPORTERS IN THAT AREA 

03:03:10.667 --> 03:03:13.767
RIGHT NOW. IN FACT, A FEW YEARS 
AGO, THE GALLERY PUT OUT 

03:03:14.047 --> 03:03:16.276
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE DON'T 
GATHER TOO CLOSELY BECAUSE WE 

03:03:16.547 --> 03:03:20.107
COULD TRIP UP SENATORS, AND MANY
OF THEM ARE IN ELDER AGE, AND 

03:03:20.377 --> 03:03:23.456
THAT WAS A REAL THREAT. THERE 
WERE SO MANY REPORTERS HERE ON 

03:03:23.747 --> 03:03:26.837
THE HILL DURING THE TRUMP ERA 
THAT IT ENDANGERED A LOT OF 

03:03:27.116 --> 03:03:30.357
THESE MEMBERS BECAUSE THERE WERE
SO MANY. BUT NOW YOU REALLY 

03:03:30.636 --> 03:03:34.446
CANNOT GATHER IN MOST PLACES. 
SCRUMS ARE DISCOURAGED. AND WE 

03:03:34.746 --> 03:03:40.387
DO RELY ON A ROTATING POOL 

03:03:42.666 --> 03:03:46.026
IN THERE AND GET SOME DETAILS 
AND ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH THE 

03:03:46.307 --> 03:03:49.696
REST OF THE WORLD, MUCH LIKE THE
CAMPAIGN SEASON AS WELL. WE HAD 

03:03:49.977 --> 03:03:52.977
A PRETTY BIG POOL SYSTEM OF 
REPORTERS WHO COVERED THE BIDEN 

03:03:53.267 --> 03:03:55.987
CAMPAIGN AND WOULD TELL OTHERS 
WHAT'S HAPPENING. SO THIS IS 

03:03:56.256 --> 03:03:58.786
ALMOST -- THIS IS ALSO 
JOURNALISTIC HISTORY TOO, IF YOU

03:03:59.066 --> 03:04:02.386
WANT TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, 
THAT IN PRIOR TIMES, CERTAINLY, 

03:04:02.666 --> 03:04:04.937
THIS UNEXPECTED EVENT TODAY 
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY 

03:04:05.217 --> 03:04:07.746
REPORTERS TO THE SCENE. YOU'RE 
SEEING THERE ON YOUR SCREEN, 

03:04:08.026 --> 03:04:11.895
RIGHT NOW IT IS A REMINDER THAT 
WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC. 

03:04:11.896 --> 03:04:14.706
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, RHONDA, WE'RE WATCHING 
SOME OF THE CLUSTERS IN THE 

03:04:15.007 --> 03:04:19.026
CHAMBER. AND AS YOU CAN SEE 
MURKOWSKI, ALONG WITH DEBBIE 

03:04:19.486 --> 03:04:22.436
STABENOW AND MARK KELLY. WE'VE 
SEEN THESE CLUSTERS GATHERING 

03:04:22.716 --> 03:04:26.386
AROUND. AND ONLY IF TO BE A FLY 
ON THE WALL, RHONDA, TO HEAR 

03:04:26.666 --> 03:04:29.456
WHAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING, BUT WE
DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE 

03:04:29.756 --> 03:04:33.236
CAMERAS, SO WE CAN ONLY SEE 
THOSE WHO HAVE GONE INTO THE 

03:04:33.516 --> 03:04:36.346
LINE OF SIGHT THAT THIS CAMERA 
IS CONTROLLED BY CONGRESS. YOU 

03:04:36.626 --> 03:04:39.406
CAN SEE RAND PAUL THERE CHOOSING
TO BE MASKLESS, DESPITE THE 

03:04:39.686 --> 03:04:43.316
DANGERS HE POSES TO OTHER HUMAN 
BEINGS IN THAT CHIM BER. I ALSO 

03:04:43.616 --> 03:04:46.396
WANT TO POINT OUT AND BRING 
JAMES INTO THE CONVERSATION. YOU

03:04:46.686 --> 03:04:50.081
KNOW, WE DID SEE JASON MILLER 
COME OUT AND SHOW SOMETHING TO 

03:04:50.356 --> 03:04:53.145
THOSE JOURNALISTS, YOU KNOW, A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO. 

03:04:53.146 --> 03:04:56.736
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND, IN FACT, WE HAVE -- AS 
YOU NOTED, FRANK THORP WAS 

03:04:57.016 --> 03:05:02.865
THERE. I SAW JOHN BRESNAHAN WAS 
THERE. I WAS WATCHING TO SEE 

03:05:03.156 --> 03:05:06.586
WHAT THEY TWEETED OUT. WHAT IT 
WAS WAS A PICTURE THAT JASON WAS

03:05:06.876 --> 03:05:09.455
HOLDING. AND IT'S CLEARLY FOR 
SHOW. AND IT WAS INTENTIONAL 

03:05:09.756 --> 03:05:13.746
THEY WANTED IT TO BE SEEN. BUT 
IT SAYS WITNESS LIST 301 SO FAR.

03:05:14.026 --> 03:05:16.596
AND THEY'RE JUST SCRATCHING OUT 
POTENTIAL NAMES OF RANDOM PEOPLE

03:05:16.876 --> 03:05:21.469
THAT THEY COULD CALL, PEOPLE WHO
WERE INVOLVED. IT REALLY SPEAKS 

03:05:21.746 --> 03:05:24.546
TO THEIR STRATEGY WHICH IS 
THEY'RE THREATENING TO GUM UP 

03:05:24.826 --> 03:05:27.406
THE SENATE, DRAG THIS OUT AS 
LONG AS POSSIBLE, DERAIL 

03:05:27.686 --> 03:05:30.245
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FIRST 100 
DAYS. AND JASON MILLER WAS ONE 

03:05:30.946 --> 03:05:34.176
OF THE PRESIDENT'S TOP 
STRATEGISTS ON HIS CAMPAIGN. 

03:05:34.475 --> 03:05:37.800
IRONICALLY HE WAS ONE OF TED 
CRUZ' TOP STRATEGISTS IN 2016 

03:05:38.085 --> 03:05:41.225
BEFORE CRUZ LOST THE PRIMARY TO 
TRUMP, AND HE'S BEEN THERE DOING

03:05:41.515 --> 03:05:46.865
SORT OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SIDE 
OF THINGS. THERE WAS A PHOTO ON 

03:05:47.145 --> 03:05:50.495
THE FRONT PAGE OF OUR NEWSPAPER 
TODAY, OR I GUESS INSIDE OUR 

03:05:50.895 --> 03:05:54.256
PAPER, OF MILLER APPLAUDING WHEN
TRUMP'S DEFENSE LAWYERS CAME IN 

03:05:54.536 --> 03:05:57.676
AFTER FINISHING THEIR CASE. SO 
THE ARGUMENT FROM THE TRUMP TEAM

03:05:57.966 --> 03:06:01.635
HERE SEEMS TO BE OPEN THE 
PANDORA'S BOX, AND WE'RE GOING 

03:06:01.915 --> 03:06:05.625
TO MAKE THIS MISERABLE AND DRAG 
IT OUT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. BUT 

03:06:06.076 --> 03:06:08.535
WITH Z WHAT THAT REALLY 
ILLUSTRATES, LIBBY, IS THEY'RE 

03:06:08.815 --> 03:06:13.345
AFRAID OF WITNESSES. THEY'RE 
AFRAID OF OPENING THE DOOR TO 

03:06:13.675 --> 03:06:17.135
HAVE PEOPLE THAT COULD -- YOU 
KNOW, THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE 

03:06:17.413 --> 03:06:20.535
THE VOTES THAT THEY NEED, AND 
HAVING PEOPLE COME IN AND START 

03:06:20.825 --> 03:06:23.375
TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 
STATE OF MIND LEADING UP TO 

03:06:23.655 --> 03:06:26.916
JANUARY 6th AND ON THE DAY OF 
CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE 

03:06:27.195 --> 03:06:29.360
POLITICALLY AND LEGALLY 
PROBLEMATIC FOR THE DEFENSE. 

03:06:29.635 --> 03:06:34.876
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO NOW TO NATIONAL 
REPORTER HANNAH JULE. SO, 

03:06:35.166 --> 03:06:39.145
HANNAH, THE SENATE STILL IN THIS
QUORUM CALL AS THEY SEE WHO 

03:06:39.415 --> 03:06:42.535
THOSE WITNESSES COULD BE AND THE
RULES OF THE TRIAL. IN THE 

03:06:42.805 --> 03:06:44.805
MEANTIME, CAN YOU TELL OUR 
VIEWERS ABOUT CONGRESSWOMAN 

03:06:46.088 --> 03:06:49.145
JAMIE HERRERA BEUTLER WHO WAS 
THE FIRST NAME MENTIONED BY LEAD

03:06:49.435 --> 03:06:51.864
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER JAMIE RASKIN
THIS MORNING? 

03:06:51.865 --> 03:06:57.165
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, LIBBY. SO JAMIE HERRERA
BEUTLER, I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE 

03:06:57.455 --> 03:07:00.545
ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND OUT 
EXACTLY WHO SHE IS. LET ME GIVE 

03:07:00.815 --> 03:07:03.345
YOU A LITTLE INTRODUCTION. SHE'S
A REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF THE 

03:07:03.624 --> 03:07:05.584
HOUSE. SHE REPRESENTS 
WASHINGTON'S 3rd DISTRICT. SHE 

03:07:05.585 --> 03:07:09.465
WAS ELECTED TO THE HOUSE IN 2010
AS PART OF THAT TEA PARTY WAVE 

03:07:09.735 --> 03:07:12.015
OF REPUBLICANS ELECTED TO 
CONGRESS. BUT SHE REPRESENTS A 

03:07:12.285 --> 03:07:14.505
PRETTY MODERATE DISTRICT. AND 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, SHE VOTED YES 

03:07:14.785 --> 03:07:18.044
ON IMPEACHMENT. SHE WAS ONE OF 
ONLY 10 REPUBLICANS WHO DID SO 

03:07:18.345 --> 03:07:21.765
ON THE HOUSE FLOOR THAT DAY SHE 
SAID I'M NOT CHOOSING SIDES, I'M

03:07:22.045 --> 03:07:24.275
CHOOSING TRUTHS. AND IN A 
STATEMENT RELEASED JANUARY 12th,

03:07:24.565 --> 03:07:28.594
SHE EXPLAINED THAT VOTE, SAYING,
QUOTE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

03:07:28.875 --> 03:07:31.395
UNITED STATES INCITED A RIOT, 
AIMING TO HALT THE PEACEFUL 

03:07:31.675 --> 03:07:34.904
TRANSFER OF POWER FROM ONE 
ADMINISTRATION TO THE NEXT. SHE 

03:07:35.185 --> 03:07:37.665
ALSO SAID HOUSE REPUBLICAN 
LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY DESCRIBES 

03:07:38.015 --> 03:07:41.315
PLEADING WITH THE PRESIDENT TO 
GO ON TELEVISION AND CALL FOR AN

03:07:41.595 --> 03:07:44.975
END TO THE MAYHEM TO NO AVAIL. 
SO THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WANT

03:07:45.255 --> 03:07:50.025
TO CALL HER AS A WITNESS AND TO 
SUBPOENA HER NOTES REGARDING HER

03:07:50.314 --> 03:07:52.860
COMMUNICATIONS WITH MINORITY 
LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY ON THE DAY

03:07:53.145 --> 03:07:56.525
OF THE RIOT. AND SHE HAS SAID 
THAT SHE WAS BRIEFED ON THAT 

03:07:56.804 --> 03:07:59.694
CALL BETWEEN TRUMP AND McCARTHY 
IN WHICH McCARTHY URGED THE 

03:07:59.977 --> 03:08:03.435
PRESIDENT TO CALL OFF THE 
RIOTERS BUT SAYS THAT HE 

03:08:04.934 --> 03:08:07.445
REFUSED. LAST NIGHT BEUTLER ALSO
PUT OUT A STATEMENT URGING 

03:08:07.715 --> 03:08:10.434
REPUBLICANS TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST
THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS 

03:08:10.724 --> 03:08:14.794
ROLE IN INCITING THE RIOT. SHE 
SAID IN A STATEMENT LAST NIGHT 

03:08:15.075 --> 03:08:18.029
WHEN -- QUOTE, WHEN McCARTHY 
FINALLY REACHED THE PRESIDENT ON

03:08:18.394 --> 03:08:21.404
JANUARY 6th AND ASKED HIM TO 
PUBLICLY AND FORCEFULLY CALL OFF

03:08:21.684 --> 03:08:23.955
THE RIOT, THE PRESIDENT 
INITIALLY REPEATED THE FALSEHOOD

03:08:24.234 --> 03:08:27.814
THAT IT WAS ANTIFA THAT HAD 
BREACHED THE CAPITOL. McCARTHY 

03:08:28.084 --> 03:08:30.524
REFUTED THAT AND TOLD THE 
PRESIDENT THESE WERE TRUMP 

03:08:30.804 --> 03:08:33.054
SUPPORTERS, THAT'S WHEN, 
ACCORDING TO McCARTHY, THE 

03:08:33.334 --> 03:08:35.865
PRESIDENT SAID, WELL, KEVIN, I 
GUESS THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE 

03:08:36.135 --> 03:08:40.945
UPSET ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN 
YOU ARE, THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF 

03:08:41.394 --> 03:08:45.174
JAMIE BEUTLER WHO IS THE FIRST 
WITNESS WHO HAS BEEN -- WELL, 

03:08:45.454 --> 03:08:49.604
MAY BE CALLED IN THIS TRIAL. SO 
THIS IS THE TESTIMONY AND THESE 

03:08:49.884 --> 03:08:52.344
ARE THE NOTES THAT THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE HOPING 

03:08:52.624 --> 03:08:54.884
TO INTRODUCE INTO THIS TRIAL, 
EVIDENCE WHICH CERTAINLY SPEAKS 

03:08:55.154 --> 03:09:00.174
TO WHAT TRUMP WAS DOING AND 
SAYING WHILE THE CAPITOL WAS 

03:09:00.444 --> 03:09:02.865
UNDER SIEGE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANKS SO MUCH, HANNAH 

03:09:03.144 --> 03:09:06.424
RICHARD JEWELL REPORTING FOR US.
RHONDA COLVIN, IF PEOPLE ARE 

03:09:06.704 --> 03:09:09.619
JUST TUNING IN, IF PEOPLE 
THOUGHT THIS WAS A FOUR GONE 

03:09:09.904 --> 03:09:13.044
CONCLUSION AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING
WAIT A MINUTE. PEOPLE NEED TO 

03:09:14.414 --> 03:09:18.764
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. CAN YOU 
RECAP FOR US WHAT THE REASONING 

03:09:19.064 --> 03:09:22.004
IS AND GO A LITTLE DEEPER HERE 
AFTER HANNAH'S COMMENTS ABOUT 

03:09:22.284 --> 03:09:27.984
WHY IMPEACHMENT MANAGER JAMIE 
RASKIN WANTS TO HEAR FROM MISS 

03:09:28.414 --> 03:09:31.554
HERRERA BEUTLER, AND ALSO WHAT 
KIND OF A SURPRISE THIS WAS FOR 

03:09:31.833 --> 03:09:36.164
MEMBERS OF THIS JURY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. TO RECAP IF ANYONE 

03:09:36.444 --> 03:09:39.294
MISSED IT, TODAY WAS ABOUT 
VOTING ON WHETHER OR NOT TO 

03:09:39.574 --> 03:09:42.384
SUBPOENA WITNESSES IN THIS 
TRIAL. THIS WAS A PART OF THE 

03:09:42.664 --> 03:09:46.324
RULES SET UP BY THE SENATE THAT 
AFTER THE Q&amp;amp;A PROCESS THAT 

03:09:46.613 --> 03:09:48.904
HAPPENED YESTERDAY WHERE 
SENATORS ASKED QUESTIONS TO BOTH

03:09:49.204 --> 03:09:51.974
SIDES, THE DEFENSE AND THE 
PROSECUTION, THEN THE NEXT STEP 

03:09:52.254 --> 03:09:56.084
IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WAS TO 
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO BRING 

03:09:56.364 --> 03:09:58.364
WITNESSES 

03:10:00.704 --> 03:10:03.794
INTO THIS. WE WE WERE TOLD THAT 
BOTH SIDES REALLY DIDN'T HAVE 

03:10:04.074 --> 03:10:08.393
MUCH OF AN APPETITE TO PROLONG 
THIS. THEY WERE WANTING THIS TO 

03:10:08.723 --> 03:10:11.594
MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY TODAY AND 
HAVE A VOTE ON THE IMPEACHMENT. 

03:10:11.869 --> 03:10:15.114
HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT WHAT 
HAPPENED. AND WE HAD A SERIES OF

03:10:15.573 --> 03:10:18.184
REPUBLICANS, SOME OF THEM WE 
EXPECTED -- BECAUSE THEY WERE 

03:10:18.463 --> 03:10:21.613
PART OF THAT GROUP THAT HAS NOT 
CONFIRMED WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

03:10:21.894 --> 03:10:25.274
GOING TO VOTE TO CONVICT OR 
ACQUIT DONALD TRUMP, WITH THE 

03:10:25.553 --> 03:10:28.304
ADDITION ALSO OF LINDSAY GRAHAM 
WHO'S, OF COURSE, BEEN HELPING 

03:10:28.583 --> 03:10:33.274
OUT THE TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM. SO 
THAT GROUP OF REPUBLICANS VOTED 

03:10:33.554 --> 03:10:37.593
WITH DEMOCRATS IN BRINGING IN 
WITNESSES INTO THIS TRIAL. AND 

03:10:37.873 --> 03:10:42.293
JAMIE RASKIN WHO IS THE LEAD 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER BROUGHT UP 

03:10:42.604 --> 03:10:45.674
TODAY THAT ONE CONGRESSWOMAN, AS
HANNAH POINTED OUT, 

03:10:47.154 --> 03:10:50.513
REPRESENTATIVE HERRERA BEUTLER 
HAS NOTES AND DETAILS THAT ARE 

03:10:50.783 --> 03:10:53.888
RELEVANT TO THIS ISSUE THAT'S 
REALLY AT THE CORE OF SOME OF 

03:10:54.193 --> 03:10:56.698
THESE REPUBLICANS WHO AREN'T AT 
EASE WITH THIS IMPEACHMENT RIGHT

03:10:56.998 --> 03:11:00.563
NOW. IT'S AT THE CORE OF THEIR 
QUESTIONS. AND THAT IS WHAT DID 

03:11:00.833 --> 03:11:04.163
TRUMP KNOW, WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?
WHAT WAS HIS PROCESS OF MIND 

03:11:04.453 --> 03:11:06.973
WHEN HE LEARNED THAT VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS IN 

03:11:07.253 --> 03:11:10.873
DANGER, HOW WAS HE REACTING TO 
THAT, AND, OF COURSE, THERE IS 

03:11:11.153 --> 03:11:14.613
THIS CALL BETWEEN KEVIN McCARTHY
WHO IS THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER

03:11:15.743 --> 03:11:19.993
THAT HE HAD WITH TRUMP ASKING 
HIM TO CALL THINGS OFF AND TRUMP

03:11:20.282 --> 03:11:24.623
SEEMED NOT TO CARE. SO HERRERA 
BEUTLER HAS DETAILS ABOUT THAT 

03:11:25.073 --> 03:11:27.623
CALL. AND IT'S ALSO JUST 
AMPLIFYING SOME OF THESE 

03:11:27.903 --> 03:11:30.378
CONCERNS THAT THE SENATE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD THAT THEIR 

03:11:30.663 --> 03:11:34.353
QUESTIONS WERE NOT ANSWERED 
YESTERDAY, THAT THEY WANTED TO 

03:11:34.923 --> 03:11:37.603
KNOW SPECIFICALLY WITH DETAIL 
HOW MUCH TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE 

03:11:37.873 --> 03:11:40.863
RIOT WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING, THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS HAVE BEEN 

03:11:41.152 --> 03:11:45.353
ARGUING THAT HE ONLY NEEDED TO 
TURN ON THE TV OR THE RADIO TO 

03:11:45.623 --> 03:11:48.463
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF THE 
REST OF AMERICA WAS WATCHING, 

03:11:48.733 --> 03:11:51.436
THAT THE CAPITOL WAS DEALING 
WITH AN INSURRECTION, AND THAT 

03:11:51.713 --> 03:11:54.003
IT WAS UNDER SIEGE, AND 
APPARENTLY THAT IS SOMETHING 

03:11:54.283 --> 03:11:59.353
THAT IS REALLY, REALLY TROUBLING
TO SENATORS LIKE MITT ROMNEY, 

03:11:59.633 --> 03:12:02.103
LISA MURKOWSKI, SENATOR COLLINS,
THEY ARE TROUBLED THAT THE 

03:12:03.303 --> 03:12:06.442
FORMER PRESIDENT DID NOT REACT 
QUICKLY WHEN HE LEARNED THAT 

03:12:06.723 --> 03:12:08.973
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND THE 
REST OF THEM WERE 

03:12:12.073 --> 03:12:14.372
ALL IN DANGER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE'RE SEEING MAJORITY LEADER 

03:12:14.662 --> 03:12:16.923
CHUCK SCHUMER THERE AT THE 
PODIUM, AND WE'RE SEEING 

03:12:17.209 --> 03:12:20.293
SENATORS TAKE THEIR SEATS. SO 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO 

03:12:20.582 --> 03:12:23.033
LEARN. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE 
FROM "THE WASHINGTON POST." 

03:12:23.313 --> 03:12:29.347
LET'S GO TO THE SENATE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ASK YOU NOW TO CONSENT TO 

03:12:29.793 --> 03:12:33.641
INITIATE THE QUORUM CALL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANY OBJECTIONS? 

03:12:33.642 --> 03:12:35.903
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, AS I 
UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE 

03:12:36.182 --> 03:12:38.703
DISCUSSIONS UNDER WAY, SO I ASK 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THE 

03:12:38.992 --> 03:12:42.194
SENATE RECESS UNTIL 12:30 P.M. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THERE OBJECTION? HEARING 

03:12:42.473 --> 03:12:44.621
NONE, WE STAND IN RECESS UNTIL 
12:30. 

03:12:44.622 --> 03:12:46.752
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU, 

03:12:51.492 --> 03:12:55.302
MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY. WE HAVE A RECESS HERE 

03:12:55.582 --> 03:12:59.913
FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. IF YOU'RE 
JUST TUNING IN, THE IMPEACHMENT 

03:13:00.252 --> 03:13:03.327
TRIAL OF DONALD TRUMP TOOK A 
DRAMATIC TURN THIS MORNING AS 

03:13:03.622 --> 03:13:06.633
THE SENATE VOTED TO CALL 
WITNESSES AND SUBPOENA 

03:13:06.922 --> 03:13:10.633
DOCUMENTS. SO WE'RE IN THIS 
BREAK RIGHT NOW. BUT HERE'S 

03:13:10.972 --> 03:13:14.192
WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY. 55 
SENATORS VOTED YES TO WITNESSES,

03:13:14.472 --> 03:13:16.923
AND THAT INCLUDED FIVE 
REPUBLICANS. HERE'S WHO THEY 

03:13:17.423 --> 03:13:20.272
WERE, REPUBLICAN SENATORS SUSAN 
COLLINS OF MAINE, LISA MURKOWSKI

03:13:20.552 --> 03:13:24.692
OF ALASKA, MITT ROMNEY OF UTAH, 
ALSO BEN SASSE OF NEBRASKA VOTED

03:13:25.152 --> 03:13:28.462
IN FAVOR OF WITNESSES. NOW, 
BEFORE THE VOTE WAS FINALIZED, 

03:13:28.742 --> 03:13:32.372
ANOTHER SENATOR JOINED THEM. 
THAT WAS LINDSAY GRAHAM OF SOUTH

03:13:32.652 --> 03:13:37.772
CAROLINA THAT BROUGHT THAT TOTAL
TO 55-45. AND THAT HAS THROWN 

03:13:38.047 --> 03:13:43.092
THE REST OF THE TRIAL TIMING IN 
FLUX. RHONDA COLVIN WAS JUST 

03:13:43.382 --> 03:13:45.922
TALKING TO US ABOUT HOW THE 
ANTICIPATION THIS WAS GET 

03:13:46.372 --> 03:13:50.852
WRAPPED UP TODAY. RHONDA, THE 
BIG NEWS PRIOR TO THIS WAS 

03:13:51.142 --> 03:13:53.382
MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL 
SENT COLLEAGUES A LETTER SAYING 

03:13:53.682 --> 03:13:56.932
HE PLANS TO VOTE TO ACQUIT 
DONALD TRUMP. AND THAT WAS A 

03:13:57.212 --> 03:14:00.392
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE 
HE HADN'T COMMITTED TO THAT, AND

03:14:00.672 --> 03:14:05.562
IT SENT, YOU KNOW, AN INDICATION
TO ALL OF HIS COLLEAGUES THAT 

03:14:05.852 --> 03:14:09.952
THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY WAY, 
REALLY, FRANKLY, THAT 

03:14:10.232 --> 03:14:12.252
REPUBLICANS -- ENOUGH 
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE SIDING WITH

03:14:12.532 --> 03:14:15.641
DEMOCRATS TO CONVICT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

03:14:15.912 --> 03:14:18.901
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND THEN 
THIS POTENTIAL GAME CHANGER THAT

03:14:19.182 --> 03:14:25.331
IS GOING TO THROW EVERYTHING UP 
IN THE AIR. 

03:14:25.332 --> 03:14:28.302
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. AND THE MINORITY 
LEADER'S DECISION TO GO FOR AN 

03:14:28.582 --> 03:14:32.132
ACQUITTAL MAY HAVE ALSO SET THE 
TONE TOO FOR THIS UNANTICIPATED 

03:14:32.402 --> 03:14:35.952
MOMENT HERE THAT BECAUSE HE CAME
OUT TODAY, THIS MOMENT, MOMENTS 

03:14:36.442 --> 03:14:40.142
BEFORE THEY GAVELED IN TODAY, 
SAYING THAT HE WAS GOING TO VOTE

03:14:40.422 --> 03:14:43.782
TO ACQUIT, THAT ALMOST SIGNALED 
THAT THIS WOULD KIND OF GO TO A 

03:14:44.052 --> 03:14:47.621
MORE SPEEDY PROCESS, THAT IT 
WOULD QUICKLY CULMINATE TO A 

03:14:47.902 --> 03:14:50.942
VOTE TODAY. BUT, OF COURSE, THAT
IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT'S 

03:14:51.212 --> 03:14:55.132
INTERESTING ABOUT MITCH 
McCONNELL'S DECISION IS IT'S NOT

03:14:55.712 --> 03:14:59.012
HIGHLY SURPRISING. HOWEVER, HE 
ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO WAS ON THE 

03:14:59.292 --> 03:15:01.882
SENATE FLOOR, IT WAS THE DAY 
BEFORE BIDEN'S INAUGURATION, AND

03:15:02.166 --> 03:15:06.142
HE SAID THE WORDS THAT TRUMP 
PROVOKED THE MOB, HE FED THEM 

03:15:06.422 --> 03:15:09.432
LIES AND THAT WORDS MATTER. THAT
WHOLE THING IS WHAT THE 

03:15:09.712 --> 03:15:12.211
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS HAVE BEEN 
ARGUING THIS WHOLE WEEK IS THAT 

03:15:12.492 --> 03:15:15.291
TRUMP PROVOKED THIS MOB. AND 
THOSE WERE THE WORDS THAT MITCH 

03:15:15.571 --> 03:15:18.091
McCONNELL USED. SO WE WERE 
LOOKING CLOSELY AT WHAT MITCH 

03:15:19.492 --> 03:15:23.392
McCONNELL'S DECISION MAKING WAS 
AS WE MOVED TOWARD A VOTE ON 

03:15:23.671 --> 03:15:28.352
ACQUITTAL OR CONVICTION, AND IT 
JUST -- IT SHOWS YOU HOW PERHAPS

03:15:28.622 --> 03:15:32.152
MINDS HAVEN'T BEEN MADE UP FOR A
WHILE. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO

03:15:32.431 --> 03:15:34.972
ARE STILL THINKING THIS THROUGH.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MITCH 

03:15:35.242 --> 03:15:38.021
McCONNELL THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE 
PROCESS HAS SAID THAT HE HAS NOT

03:15:38.291 --> 03:15:41.252
TOLD HIS CAUCUS WHAT TO DO. HE 
IS LEAVING EVERYONE'S DECISION 

03:15:41.541 --> 03:15:44.341
UP TO THEM. THAT'S A LITTLE 
DIFFERENT FROM THE SIGNALS THAT 

03:15:44.611 --> 03:15:48.741
HE SENT IN THE LAST IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL. HE WANTED IT TO GO 

03:15:49.021 --> 03:15:52.701
QUICKLY AND SMOOTHLY WITHOUT 
WITNESSES. THAT WAS ONE OF THE 

03:15:52.987 --> 03:15:56.081
AREAS AND THE STICKING POINTS OF
THE LAST IMPEACHMENT IS THAT THE

03:15:56.371 --> 03:15:58.501
DEMOCRATS WERE CALLING FOR 
WITNESSES. EVERYDAY CHUCK 

03:15:58.771 --> 03:16:02.001
SCHUMER HELD A PRESS BRIEFING 
BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGAN. I WAS 

03:16:02.281 --> 03:16:04.821
THERE. AND HE WAS CALLING FOR 
WITNESSES, AND MITCH McCONNELL 

03:16:05.091 --> 03:16:08.741
DID NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AND 
GOT HIS CAUCUS ALL ON THE SAME 

03:16:09.051 --> 03:16:13.281
PAGE ABOUT A SPEEDY TRIAL LAST 
TIME. BUT THIS TIME WE WERE 

03:16:13.561 --> 03:16:16.741
SEEING SOME DIFFERENT SIGNALS 
FROM MITCH McCONNELL WHERE HE 

03:16:17.021 --> 03:16:20.246
DID ADMIT AND SAID VERY 
EXPLICITLY THAT THE FORMER 

03:16:20.531 --> 03:16:23.863
PRESIDENT'S WORDS DID MATTER, 
AND THAT WAS IN A FLOOR SPEECH 

03:16:24.161 --> 03:16:27.641
ON THE SENATE WHICH IS IN 
RECORD. SO, OF COURSE TODAY, 

03:16:27.911 --> 03:16:31.491
THOUGH, HE HAS DECIDED THAT HE 
WILL VOTE TO ACQUIT. AGAIN, 

03:16:31.766 --> 03:16:35.011
THOUGH, EVEN THOUGH HE HAS SAID 
THAT NOW, WE ARE STILL WAITING 

03:16:35.292 --> 03:16:38.731
FOR ALL OF THESE DETAILS ABOUT 
THE REST OF THIS TRIAL TO FIRM 

03:16:39.004 --> 03:16:43.051
UP. WE DON'T KNOW REALLY THE 
NEXT STEPS YET. SO DID 

03:16:43.541 --> 03:16:45.811
EVERYTHING CHANGE, DID SOME 
CHANGE? WE DON'T KNOW. WE'RE 

03:16:46.101 --> 03:16:48.711
WAITING TO SEE WHAT'S NEXT WITH 
THE WITNESSES, WHO THESE 

03:16:48.981 --> 03:16:51.900
WITNESSES ARE AND THE REAL 
IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY FROM THIS 

03:16:52.171 --> 03:16:56.131
MOMENT TODAY THAT WE'RE WAITING 
ON IS THAT THE SENATE WILL BE 

03:16:56.651 --> 03:16:59.241
CHOOSING THESE WITNESSES. SO 
EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENSE IS 

03:16:59.521 --> 03:17:02.011
SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO BRING 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN, THEY 

03:17:02.301 --> 03:17:05.901
REALLY CAN'T DO THAT. IT'S GOING
TO HAVE TO BE AGREED UPON WHO 

03:17:06.201 --> 03:17:09.001
THESE WITNESSES ARE. SO WE'RE 
JUST WAITING ON NEXT STEPS. WE 

03:17:09.291 --> 03:17:12.631
OF COURSE NOW HAVE THIS LONG 
BREAK SO EVERYONE CAN SORT OF 

03:17:12.911 --> 03:17:16.211
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO JAMES HOMAN. WE 

03:17:16.490 --> 03:17:20.710
KNOW THAT JASON MILLER FLASHED 
THAT LIST OF, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSED

03:17:20.981 --> 03:17:26.221
WITNESSES THEY WANT TO CALL 
WHICH WE SAW HIM DO IN GREAT 

03:17:26.501 --> 03:17:29.391
SHOWY FASHION TO THE 
JOURNALISTS. WASN'T JUST SORT OF

03:17:29.686 --> 03:17:34.641
LIKE, YOU KNOW, CAUGHT ON HOT 
MIC SORT OF MOMENT, JAMES. 300 

03:17:34.921 --> 03:17:38.463
SOME WITNESSES SO FAR IS WHAT 
THEY'RE CONSIDERING. BUT RHONDA 

03:17:38.741 --> 03:17:42.160
REMINDED US THAT IT'S NOT UP TO 
THEM. IT'S NOT UP TO TRUMP'S 

03:17:43.135 --> 03:17:46.111
TEAM TO ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHICH 
WITNESSES ARE CALLED AND 

03:17:46.390 --> 03:17:49.810
WHETHER, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 
DELIVERED. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN 

03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:53.180
JASON MILLER'S HAND RIGHT THERE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND IF YOU ZOOM IN, LIBBY, 

03:17:53.460 --> 03:17:56.970
AND YOU LOOK AT THE NAMES THERE,
THAT WAS ENTIRELY FOR SHOW. THAT

03:17:57.251 --> 03:18:00.300
LIST -- YOU KNOW, THE TOP IS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY 

03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:03.461
PELOSI, VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA 
HARRIS, ALL THE MEMBERS -- THE 

03:18:03.745 --> 03:18:05.981
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE 
LISTED THERE, ALL THE DEMOCRATIC

03:18:06.260 --> 03:18:09.945
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ARE 
LISTED. THIS ISN'T A SERIOUS 

03:18:10.491 --> 03:18:14.281
LIST OF WITNESSES THAT WOULD 
ACTUALLY ILLUMINATE FACTS. THIS 

03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:17.820
IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO BULLY OR 
INTIMIDATE DEMOCRATS INTO 

03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:22.640
BACKING DOWN AND NOT OPENING THE
PANDORA'S BOX. YOU HAVE 

03:18:22.921 --> 03:18:25.711
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ARE ON 
THE HILL RIGHT NOW SAYING, WELL,

03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:29.520
IF YOU CALL A SINGLE WITNESS, 
THIS IS GOING TO DRAG ON FOR 

03:18:29.801 --> 03:18:32.601
MONTHS AND MONTHS. IN FACT, 
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF HAVING

03:18:32.880 --> 03:18:34.550
JUDICIAL IMPEACHMENT TRIALS 
SIMULTANEOUS TO OTHER 

03:18:34.551 --> 03:18:36.551
LEGISLATION PASSING. ALL OF 
THIS, THOUGH, IS BEING 

03:18:36.790 --> 03:18:38.930
NEGOTIATED. THE SENATE 
ULTIMATELY IS A BODY THAT 

03:18:39.210 --> 03:18:42.711
REQUIRES A LOT OF CONSENT FOR 
THINGS TO MOVE FORWARD, A LOT OF

03:18:42.995 --> 03:18:45.830
THINGS CAN GET HELD UP BY A 
SINGLE SENATOR OBJECTING WHICH 

03:18:46.111 --> 03:18:49.990
IS WHY OFTEN YOU DO HAVE DEALS 
THAT ARE WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE 

03:18:50.260 --> 03:18:52.260
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS. THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT 

03:18:52.470 --> 03:18:56.630
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO, I 
ASSUME, AND THEY HOPE CAN COME 

03:18:56.910 --> 03:19:02.770
OUT AT 12:30 AND ANNOUNCE SOME 
KIND OF AGREEMENT. WE DO KNOW 

03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:05.310
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE 
TEAM WAS TOTALLY CAUGHT OFF 

03:19:05.596 --> 03:19:08.390
GUARD. THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS 
GOING TO BE WRAPPED UP BY 

03:19:08.680 --> 03:19:11.660
LUNCHTIME. THEY BELIEVED THAT 
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO KIND OF 

03:19:11.950 --> 03:19:14.740
JUST GET THIS OVER WITH, AND 
THEY HAD THEIR ONE-HOUR CLOSING 

03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:18.230
ARGUMENT READY TO GO. SO THEY'VE
BEEN CAUGHT OFF GUARD. REMEMBER,

03:19:18.510 --> 03:19:21.490
THE TRUMP LAWYERS DON'T KNOW 
EACH OTHER WELL. THEY DON'T HAVE

03:19:21.770 --> 03:19:24.550
A HISTORY OF WORKING TOGETHER. 
THEY DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP 

03:19:25.660 --> 03:19:30.590
WITH THEIR CLIENT, DONALD TRUMP,
AND ONE OF THE LAWYERS, DOUG 

03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:35.560
SCHOEN OR DAVID SCHOEN IS NOT 
THERE TODAY BECAUSE IT'S THE 

03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:40.220
JEWISH SABBATH. SO HE LEFT 
BEFORE 5:00 YESTERDAY AND ISN'T 

03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:45.120
AROUND FOR THEM TO STRATEGIZE. 
SO THE SENATE IS STILL GOING TO 

03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:49.409
HAVE TO VOTE ON WHICH SPECIFIC 
WITNESSES TO CALL. CLEARLY THERE

03:19:49.710 --> 03:19:54.240
WERE 55 VOTES FOR JAMIE HERRERA 
BEUTLER. WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW

03:19:54.510 --> 03:19:58.320
EASY SHE WILL BE TO GET ON A 
ZOOM DEPOSITION. WE OBVIOUSLY 

03:19:58.599 --> 03:20:01.970
HAVE TALKED ABOUT HER PRESS 
RELEASE, BUT SHE ALSO SAID THERE

03:20:02.250 --> 03:20:06.709
COULD BE OTHER PATRIOTS WHO 
MIGHT COME FORWARD AND PERHAPS 

03:20:06.999 --> 03:20:09.840
SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS BEHIND
THE SCENES ARE WHETHER SOME OF 

03:20:10.120 --> 03:20:14.718
THOSE PEOPLE MIGHT BE WILLING TO
TESTIFY. 

03:20:14.719 --> 03:20:19.490
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES, LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT 
THE TIMING OF THIS. AND AS YOU 

03:20:19.773 --> 03:20:23.719
SAID, IT'S UNKNOWN IF -- NOW, 
THIS IS A LOT OF IFS BECAUSE WE 

03:20:23.989 --> 03:20:26.509
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE 
PROCEDURAL STEPS TO FIND OUT 

03:20:26.780 --> 03:20:29.690
WHAT WITNESSES THEY WANT TO 
CALL, IF THEY HAVE THE MAJORITY 

03:20:29.959 --> 03:20:32.970
OF VOTES TO CALL THEM. SO, IF, 
FOR EXAMPLE, CONGRESSMAN HERRERA

03:20:33.250 --> 03:20:36.395
BEUTLER IS SUBPOENAED, AND THEY 
CAN HAVE HER APPEAR BY ZOOM, HOW

03:20:36.670 --> 03:20:39.749
LONG COULD THIS GO? POTENTIALLY 
WE COULD WRAP THIS UP IN THE 

03:20:40.029 --> 03:20:43.339
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, OR, 
FRANKLY, THIS COULD GO ON A LOT 

03:20:43.629 --> 03:20:46.710
LONGER AS THE SENATE TRIES TO 
TURN ITS ATTENTION BACK TO COVID

03:20:46.990 --> 03:20:48.689
RELIEF. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS 

03:20:48.690 --> 03:20:51.259
ONCE YOU START AN IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN 

03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:54.019
DEFINITELY STILL DO SENATE 
BUSINESS, AND, IN FACT, WE'VE 

03:20:54.300 --> 03:20:57.699
SEEN THAT THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS, RIGHT? AT THE END OF THE 

03:20:57.979 --> 03:21:01.379
DAY SCHUMER HAS SAID, WELL, YOU 
KNOW, I MAKE A MOTION FOR THE 

03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:05.009
SENATE TO BE IN REGULAR BUSINESS
FROM 11:00 TO 12:00 SO THESE 

03:21:05.300 --> 03:21:08.439
COMMITTEES CAN DO THEIR WORK AND
WE CAN ADVANCE THIS AND THAT, 

03:21:08.729 --> 03:21:11.299
AND THERE'S BEEN UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT. THAT WAS PART OF THE 

03:21:11.609 --> 03:21:14.629
DEAL THAT WAS REACHED OUT IN 
ADVANCE WITH McCOME AND SCHUMER.

03:21:14.919 --> 03:21:17.749
SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE IS THEY FEEL 

03:21:18.030 --> 03:21:21.020
LIKE THEY WERE BLINDSIDED. THE 
TRUTH, AS PAUL KANE WAS TELLING 

03:21:21.309 --> 03:21:23.569
US A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WERE 

03:21:24.054 --> 03:21:26.339
BLINDSIDED AS WELL. SO 
REPUBLICANS FELT THEY HAD THIS 

03:21:26.619 --> 03:21:29.759
DEAL TO SORT OF GET THIS OVER 
WITH TODAY AND THE HOUSE 

03:21:30.109 --> 03:21:33.219
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAYING, NO,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WE HAVE A

03:21:33.510 --> 03:21:37.569
HALF-BAKED CASE, WE'RE GOING TO 
FULLY BAKE OUR CASE. SO THAT IS 

03:21:38.310 --> 03:21:43.909
PART OF THE QUESTION IS THAT IF 
ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE SIDE HAS AN 

03:21:44.189 --> 03:21:47.519
INCENTIVE TO DRAG THIS OUT, WILL
THEY ACTUALLY TRY TO DRAG IT 

03:21:47.804 --> 03:21:50.359
OUT? THERE IS A SCENARIO, 
FRANKLY, WHERE THIS STILL WRAPS 

03:21:50.649 --> 03:21:54.029
UP ON MONDAY, OR EVEN IN THEORY 
THIS COULD WRAP UP TODAY, THAT 

03:21:54.299 --> 03:21:57.629
SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY. BUT YOU 
COULD HAVE A THEORY OF -- A 

03:21:57.914 --> 03:22:01.418
SCENARIO WHERE THEY VOTE TO CALL
HERRERA BEUTLER, AND THAT'S ALL,

03:22:01.969 --> 03:22:08.639
AND SHE DOES HER ZOOM SUBPOENA 
TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON, AND, 

03:22:08.934 --> 03:22:11.509
YOU KNOW, THEY COME BACK 
TOMORROW OR ON PRESIDENTS' DAY 

03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:16.289
AND THEN HAVING THE:ES ARMS, AND
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE 

03:22:16.579 --> 03:22:19.049
PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE TEAM SAY 
WHAT SHE SAID IS IRRELEVANT 

03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:22.189
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
DID AFTER THE RIOT WAS INCITED 

03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:26.578
IS IRRELEVANT, AND THEN YOU KIND
OF GET BACK TO ESSENTIALLY WHERE

03:22:26.861 --> 03:22:31.484
WE WERE THIS MORNING. THAT ALL 
IS SORT OF UNPREDICTABLE. IT IS 

03:22:31.779 --> 03:22:35.198
HARD TO IMAGINE IF YOU CALL ONE 
WITNESS THAT YOU JUST REALLY 

03:22:35.471 --> 03:22:39.039
STICK WITH ONE WITNESS. BUT, 
AGAIN, IT'S UP TO THE SENATE. SO

03:22:39.319 --> 03:22:42.159
IF DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT MORE 
THAN ONE, THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO 

03:22:42.439 --> 03:22:45.429
BE MORE THAN ONE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO NOW TO CAPITOL HILL 

03:22:45.699 --> 03:22:49.969
REPORTER WHO'S JOINING US FROM 
THE SENATE GALLERY. HELLO. SO, 

03:22:50.239 --> 03:22:55.009
YOU KNOW, PAUL KANE WAS POINTING
OUT TO US TODAY THAT DEMOCRATIC 

03:22:55.279 --> 03:22:58.608
SENATORS HEADING INTO THE TRIAL 
WERE TALKING ABOUT AND SAYING 

03:22:58.888 --> 03:23:02.438
THEY DID NOT SEE A NEED TO CALL 
WITNESSES WHICH GETS AT THEIR 

03:23:02.709 --> 03:23:07.629
STATE OF MIND AND THEIR 
EXPECTATION, FRANKLY, OF WHAT 

03:23:07.909 --> 03:23:10.929
WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. I THINK WHAT WE SAW 

03:23:11.228 --> 03:23:14.459
HAPPEN THIS MORNING WAS A 
SURPRISE. SENATE DEMOCRATS DID 

03:23:14.758 --> 03:23:18.669
NOT SOUND LIKE FOR THE LAST FEW 
DAYS THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED 

03:23:18.948 --> 03:23:23.439
IN HAVING THE WITNESS PANDORA'S 
BOX BE OPENED. EVERYONE WAS 

03:23:23.719 --> 03:23:26.799
EXPECTING WHEN WE LEFT LAST 
NIGHT THAT WE WOULD COME BACK AT

03:23:27.079 --> 03:23:30.429
10:00 A.M., AND WE WOULD BE OUT 
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON. 

03:23:30.709 --> 03:23:33.509
AND NOW THAT'S CLEARLY NOT 
HAPPENING. BUT OFFICIALLY NO ONE

03:23:33.813 --> 03:23:36.428
HAS EVER FIRMLY COMPLETELY 
CLOSED THE DOOR ON THE WITNESS 

03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:39.638
QUESTION. THE SENATE DEMOCRATS 
KEPT PITCHING THAT TO THE HOUSE 

03:23:40.079 --> 03:23:45.289
MANAGERS. THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
KEPT SAYING TBD, TBD, WE DON'T 

03:23:45.589 --> 03:23:48.389
KNOW. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, THIS
IS -- WHAT JAMES IS SAYING. THIS

03:23:48.668 --> 03:23:52.849
IS UP TO THE SENATE. THE SENATE 
HAS TO BE THE ONE, THE BODY THAT

03:23:53.132 --> 03:23:55.969
VOTES TO APPROVE ANY OF THE 
SUBPOENAS. NOW WE HAVE THIS 

03:23:56.249 --> 03:23:58.768
GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT DO WE 
WANT ANSWERS ANSWERED IN THE 

03:23:59.050 --> 03:24:02.169
AFFIRMATIVE, OKAY. IT MEANS 
NOTHING. IT'S THEORETICAL UNTIL 

03:24:02.459 --> 03:24:05.478
YOU GET INTO THE SPECIFIC PEOPLE
THAT WOULD HAVE THE SUBSEQUENT 

03:24:05.764 --> 03:24:08.718
MOTIONS VOTED ON. AND NOW THE 
PROBLEM IS, THOUGH, THAT, YOU 

03:24:08.988 --> 03:24:11.548
KNOW, IF YOU DO NOTHING 
FOLLOWING THIS, THEN WHAT WAS 

03:24:11.828 --> 03:24:15.358
THAT VOTE THAT WE JUST WATCHED 
THIS MORNING? IS IT JUST TO MAKE

03:24:15.629 --> 03:24:17.868
A STATEMENT THAT PEOPLE WOULD 
LIKE EMOTIONALLY TO HAVE 

03:24:18.139 --> 03:24:20.378
WITNESSES, THAT WE DON'T 
ACTUALLY GO AFTER ANY WITNESSES?

03:24:20.678 --> 03:24:23.958
SO IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU JUST 
LEAVE IT THERE, THAT'S WEIRD, 

03:24:24.248 --> 03:24:27.338
RIGHT? BUT IF YOU KEEP GOING, AS
JAMES SAID, IT'S DIFFICULT TO 

03:24:27.620 --> 03:24:30.418
JUST STOP AT ONE, UNLESS THERE'S
ONE ALL-ENCOMPASSING WITNESS 

03:24:30.688 --> 03:24:33.808
THAT EVERYONE CAN AGREE UPON. SO
THE BALANCING ACT GOING FORWARD 

03:24:34.168 --> 03:24:36.693
IS EXTREMELY DELICATE, BOTH 
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES AND ALSO 

03:24:37.408 --> 03:24:40.193
WITHIN EACH PARTY. REMEMBER, THE
HOUSE MANAGERS DO SEEM TO WANT 

03:24:40.498 --> 03:24:43.368
THESE WITNESSES. THEY WANTED TO 
CALL ON THE PRESIDENT WHO SAID 

03:24:43.658 --> 03:24:46.738
HE REFUSED, AND IT'S THE SENATE 
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN WISHY 

03:24:47.018 --> 03:24:49.518
WASHY ABOUT THIS AND CHANGED 
THEIR POSITION ABOUT WHAT THEY 

03:24:49.798 --> 03:24:53.500
WERE SAYING A FEW DAYS AGO AND 
THEY VOTED TODAY, AND, YES, A 

03:24:53.768 --> 03:24:56.778
HANDFUL OF REPUBLICANS TOO. BUT 
IF YOU HAVE MOTIONS BROUGHT BY 

03:24:57.068 --> 03:24:59.928
THE MANAGERS WHO ARE THEN VOTED 
DOWN BY SENATE DEMOCRATS, THAT'S

03:25:00.218 --> 03:25:03.053
GOING TO CREATE TENSIONS WITHIN 
THE PARTY AS WELL, UNLESS THE 

03:25:03.338 --> 03:25:07.948
REQUESTS ARE SO OUTLANDISH THAT,
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY 

03:25:08.248 --> 03:25:10.248
SENSE -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COULD THERE BE THAT 

03:25:10.278 --> 03:25:13.388
COORDINATION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY 
THESE ARE REPUBLICANS, RIGHT? 

03:25:13.668 --> 03:25:15.827
LISA MURKOWSKI, SUSAN COLLINS, 
THEY ARE REPUBLICANS. 

03:25:15.828 --> 03:25:18.347
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO ARE THEY GOING TO COME TO 

03:25:18.628 --> 03:25:21.698
AN AGREEMENT WITH THEIR CAUCUS 
AND SAY, LOOK, YOU KNOW, YES, I 

03:25:21.968 --> 03:25:25.528
WILL ALSO SIDE WITH YOU TO HEAR 
FROM A WITNESS THAT COULD EITHER

03:25:26.068 --> 03:25:29.708
PROVE TO BE EXCULPATORY TO THE 
PRESIDENT OR CHANGES THE TONE OR

03:25:29.978 --> 03:25:33.048
TENOR OF THE CONVERSATION. I 
GUESS THE QUESTION IS, THOUGH, 

03:25:33.328 --> 03:25:36.567
THEY'VE GOTTA HAVE SOME DEMOCRAT
ON BOARD, THOUGH, RIGHT? 

03:25:36.568 --> 03:25:40.178
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. IN ORDER TO APPROVE 
ANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

03:25:40.478 --> 03:25:43.277
WITNESSES, THEY HAVE TO HAVE AT 
LEAST ONE DEMOCRAT ON BOARD 

03:25:43.548 --> 03:25:47.118
BECAUSE IF YOU END UP AT 50/50, 
THE TIE GOES TO THE DEMOCRATS 

03:25:47.408 --> 03:25:49.798
BECAUSE HARRIS CASTS THE 
TIEBREAKING VOTE. SO THE 

03:25:50.308 --> 03:25:53.508
REPUBLICANS DO NEED 51. THEY 
NEED TO SWAY AT LEAST ONE 

03:25:53.788 --> 03:25:55.788
DEMOCRAT. AND, LOOK, THERE ARE 
BIPARTISAN CONVERSATIONS 

03:25:55.807 --> 03:25:58.888
HAPPENING ALL OVER THE FLOOR 
RIGHT NOW. WE SAW JOE MANCHIN 

03:25:59.208 --> 03:26:02.958
ACTUALLY GO INTO THE GOP COKE 
ROOM TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THEM AT

03:26:03.238 --> 03:26:05.758
ONE POINT DURING THIS BREAK 
BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, 

03:26:06.038 --> 03:26:09.898
FORMALLY SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING
TO RECONVENE UNTIL 12:30. THE 

03:26:10.178 --> 03:26:14.297
SITUATION, THOUGH, THAT YOU HAVE
IS -- I THINK THAT YOU NEED THAT

03:26:14.578 --> 03:26:17.898
PARODY TO GET ONE OF THE 
MODERATE DEMOCRATS ON BOARD TO 

03:26:18.178 --> 03:26:21.068
JOIN THE REPUBLICANS AND TO KEEP
THE REPUBLICANS ON BOARD WITH 

03:26:21.338 --> 03:26:24.440
THE DEMOCRATS, YOU WOULD NEED TO
HAVE THAT NOTION OF PARODY. BUT 

03:26:24.718 --> 03:26:28.058
IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT 
ANYMORE, AND YOU CAN KEEP THE 

03:26:28.347 --> 03:26:30.633
DEMOCRATS TOGETHER AS A BLOC, 
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, YOU COULD 

03:26:30.917 --> 03:26:34.908
JUST MAKE THIS GO AS LONG AS YOU
-- BECAUSE THE SENATE HAS TO BE 

03:26:35.198 --> 03:26:37.975
THE APPROVING BODY, RIGHT? SO 
YOU COULD JUST TECHNICALLY HAVE 

03:26:38.658 --> 03:26:42.158
THE DEMOCRATS ALL, IF THIS THEY 
CAN STICK TOGETHER PLUS ONE 

03:26:42.448 --> 03:26:45.438
APPROVE THE WITNESSES THEY WANT 
TO APPROVE. THE TRUMP LAWYERS 

03:26:45.718 --> 03:26:48.908
WILL KEEP MAKING THE MOTIONS, 
THEY WILL KEEP GETTING SHUT DOWN

03:26:49.208 --> 03:26:51.907
PRESUMABLY, IF BOTH PARTIES 
STICK TOGETHER, BUT THEN YOU 

03:26:52.198 --> 03:26:54.767
LOSE POTENTIALLY YOUR HIGH 
GROUND OF HAVING THIS BE A 

03:26:56.247 --> 03:26:59.028
BIPARTISAN PROCESS. AND, LOOK, 
THIS TIME -- THIS TRIAL, THERE 

03:26:59.308 --> 03:27:02.097
ARE MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES IN 
PLAY THAN THERE WAS THE FIRST 

03:27:02.378 --> 03:27:05.207
TIME THAT TRUMP WAS UP ON 
IMPEACHMENT CHARGES. AND I DON'T

03:27:05.497 --> 03:27:09.608
KNOW THAT THAT CHANGES. BUT, YOU
KNOW, THIS IS NOT A PURE 

03:27:09.888 --> 03:27:12.558
COURTROOM WHERE NOTHING IS -- 
NOTHING BUT THE FACTS ARE 

03:27:12.827 --> 03:27:18.228
SUPPOSED TO COME INTO PLAY, 
LIKE, IF THIS TOOK WEEKS OR 

03:27:18.507 --> 03:27:21.547
MORE, YOU CAN WEAR AT THE 
PATIENCE OF SENATORS, AND THEY 

03:27:21.827 --> 03:27:24.657
CAN HAVE THAT FACTOR INTO THE 
DECISION MAKING TOO. SO THERE'S 

03:27:24.947 --> 03:27:28.887
A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE. AND 
SO THEY HAVE TO -- IT'S GOING TO

03:27:29.197 --> 03:27:32.227
BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
THEY ANNOUNCE AFTER 12:30, AND 

03:27:32.507 --> 03:27:35.907
IF IT DOES INCLUDE WITNESSES, 
WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THOSE LISTS

03:27:36.177 --> 03:27:39.357
BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 
INDICATOR ALSO OF WHAT TYPE OF 

03:27:39.637 --> 03:27:43.177
CASE -- ADDITIONAL CASE EACH 
SIDE IS GOING TO PUT ON, AND IF 

03:27:43.457 --> 03:27:46.327
IT'S IN ALL SERIOUS NE AND THESE
ARE ALL LEGITIMATE WITNESSES 

03:27:46.607 --> 03:27:49.127
THAT COULD ACTUALLY SWAY A 
DEMOCRAT TO BACK THE TRUMP 

03:27:49.407 --> 03:27:52.608
WITNESS OR A REPUBLICAN TO BACK,
YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE MANAGERS' 

03:27:52.887 --> 03:27:55.107
WITNESS, THAT'S GOING TO BE 
REALLY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING 

03:27:55.387 --> 03:27:57.387
HOW LONG 

03:28:01.977 --> 03:28:06.586
THIS GOES, HOW PARTISANLY 
ACRIMONIOUS IT IS WELL. 

03:28:06.587 --> 03:28:09.677
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S JUST TALK THROUGH WHAT 
SOME OF THESE MODERATE 

03:28:09.957 --> 03:28:12.377
REPUBLICANS -- I'M CALLING THEM 
MODERATES BECAUSE I'M THINKING 

03:28:12.827 --> 03:28:15.637
OF SUSAN COLLINS AND MITT 
ROMNEY, BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT BILL 

03:28:15.907 --> 03:28:19.047
CASSIDY ON THAT LIST, BILL 
CASSIDY WHO'S NOT REALLY A 

03:28:19.317 --> 03:28:21.036
MODERATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOT REALLY A MODERATE. 

03:28:21.037 --> 03:28:24.327
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. SO THESE REPUBLICANS 
WHO HAVE SO FAR VOTED THAT THIS 

03:28:24.607 --> 03:28:31.487
IS CONSTITUTIONAL TO MOVE 
FORWARD, WHAT 

03:28:32.427 --> 03:28:36.357
THAT THE DRVES TEAM JUST HAS NOT
BEEN ABLE TO OR BEEN WILLING TO 

03:28:36.647 --> 03:28:39.726
ANSWER AT THIS POINT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY. SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK

03:28:40.007 --> 03:28:45.447
TO MY NOTES FROM YESTERDAY 
BECAUSE I COVERED IT OVER THE 

03:28:45.897 --> 03:28:48.162
WEEK. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FIRST PLACE SOME OF THEM 

03:28:48.302 --> 03:28:50.302
WANT 

03:28:53.231 --> 03:28:57.312
MORE INFORMATION. I HOPE YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND ME CLEAR ENOUGH. I'M 

03:28:57.565 --> 03:28:59.933
WEARING MULTIPLE MASKS AND I 
KNOW IT IS A LITTLE BIT MUFFLED 

03:29:00.152 --> 03:29:02.553
SOUND EVEN TO MY EARS SO MY 
APOLOGIES. BUT THEY ASKED THE 

03:29:02.773 --> 03:29:04.773
FIRST 

03:29:06.912 --> 03:29:08.832
MODERATE QUESTION ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THEY WANTED 

03:29:08.833 --> 03:29:12.213
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY 
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW THAT 

03:29:12.432 --> 03:29:14.792
THE CAPITAL HAD BEEN BREACHED SO
THEY COULD PUT ALL OF HIS 

03:29:15.012 --> 03:29:17.012
ACTIONS 

03:29:20.013 --> 03:29:23.453
AND STATEMENTS INTO THE CONTEXT 
AND FRANKLY NOBODY COULD ANSWER 

03:29:23.672 --> 03:29:25.672
THAT 

03:29:28.692 --> 03:29:31.312
WITH SPECIFICITY. THE SOLE 
PROPRIETOR OF THAT WAS TRUMP AND

03:29:31.513 --> 03:29:33.513
YOU DON'T PUT 

03:29:36.972 --> 03:29:39.272
HIM UP FOR TESTIMONY. SO THAT 
LEFT EVERYBODY WITH A 

03:29:41.012 --> 03:29:43.012
UNSATISFIED FEELING. LATER ON, 
ROMNEY 

03:29:45.672 --> 03:29:49.932
AND COLLINS IF THE VICE 
PRESIDENT WAS AWARE THAT HE HAD 

03:29:50.202 --> 03:29:54.732
BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CHAMBER 
WHEN HE TWEETED ABOUT PENCE. AND

03:29:54.952 --> 03:29:56.952
AGAIN, THE ANSWERS HAD TO REST 

03:30:00.652 --> 03:30:02.652
ON CONJECTURE BECAUSE THE HOUSE 
DIDN'T REALLY PROVE THEIR CASE 

03:30:02.813 --> 03:30:06.033
AND THEY SAID WE CAN'T NOTE THAT
IT 

03:30:11.042 --> 03:30:13.293
WAS BUT THEY CAN'T SAY AGAIN 
WITH SPECIFICITY THAT THEY CAN 

03:30:13.512 --> 03:30:15.512
SHOW 

03:30:16.952 --> 03:30:18.432
UP TO TESTIFY. THE 
BACK-AND-FORTH IS HAPPENING. 

03:30:18.433 --> 03:30:21.293
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION 
THAT HAS BEEN AT THIS TRIAL BUT 

03:30:21.443 --> 03:30:27.672
A LOT OF IT WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE, A 

03:30:27.893 --> 03:30:30.513
LOT OF IT WAS IN THE PUBLIC 
DOMAIN ALREADY THAT HAD TO BE 

03:30:32.392 --> 03:30:34.793
JUST CURATED INTO THE CASES THAT
EACH SIDE MADE. THERE'S NOT A 

03:30:36.552 --> 03:30:38.252
LOT OF NEWLY UNEARTHED 
TESTIMONY. THERE'S BEEN NO 

03:30:38.253 --> 03:30:40.253
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE TRIAL. IT 

03:30:43.191 --> 03:30:45.191
HAS BEEN 

03:30:46.432 --> 03:30:49.693
GOING ON. IF IT HASN'T BEEN 
ADDED TO THE PRESS OR VIA SOCIAL

03:30:49.913 --> 03:30:51.913
MEDIA IT DOESN'T EXIST 

03:30:55.573 --> 03:30:57.573
RIGHT NOW.

03:31:01.412 --> 03:31:04.113
BUT TO KIND OF BOLSTER THEIR 
CASE AND ALMOST TO GET THIS 

03:31:04.262 --> 03:31:06.433
QUESTION ANSWERED IN OPEN FORUM 
MAY BE TO GET THE MORE SUPPORT 

03:31:06.653 --> 03:31:13.772
FROM THEIR PEERS THAN YOU WANT 
TO CONNECT THESE DOTS THAT ARE 

03:31:13.992 --> 03:31:17.032
LEFT HANGING. AND FRANKLY NOBODY
CAN DO 

03:31:22.052 --> 03:31:23.638
IT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. REALLY 

03:31:23.639 --> 03:31:25.793
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. WE CAN 
HEAR YOU PERFECTLY SO YOU ARE 

03:31:26.013 --> 03:31:28.013
DOING A GREAT 

03:31:32.973 --> 03:31:34.973
JOB. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

03:31:40.552 --> 03:31:42.552
THEY ALREADY HAVE FLIGHTS BOOKED
HOME, SO, WE WERE ANTICIPATING 

03:31:42.712 --> 03:31:45.432
THIS COULD WRAP UP TODAY AS WERE
THEY. LET'S GO TO 

03:31:50.153 --> 03:31:53.763
TOM HAMBURGER. YOU KNOW THIS 
AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER, 

03:31:53.933 --> 03:31:55.933
RIGHT? THINGS ARE STILL 

03:31:59.592 --> 03:32:01.592
IN FLUX.

03:32:04.922 --> 03:32:10.033
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE DEFENSE 
TEAM AND WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO 

03:32:10.253 --> 03:32:12.253
HAVE TO FIGURE 

03:32:13.722 --> 03:32:15.572
OUT NEXT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS YOU JUST NOTED AND OUR 

03:32:15.573 --> 03:32:17.752
COLLEAGUES HAVE REPORTED, THE 
DEFENSE TEAM WAS SURPRISED 

03:32:22.773 --> 03:32:25.913
THIS MORNING BY THIS AS INDEED 
WERE SO MANY OF US IN WASHINGTON

03:32:26.133 --> 03:32:28.133
BY THIS TURN OF EVENTS 

03:32:30.813 --> 03:32:32.813
AND SO JASON 

03:32:34.973 --> 03:32:36.932
MILLER DISTRIBUTED THIS DAUNTING
LIST OF WITNESSES THAT THEY 

03:32:36.933 --> 03:32:38.933
WOULD LIKE 

03:32:42.092 --> 03:32:44.693
TO CALL IT IS THE DEFENSIVE 
RESPONSE IT SEEMS TO BE IF YOU 

03:32:44.912 --> 03:32:46.912
WANT TO 

03:32:50.152 --> 03:32:52.933
CALL WITNESSES MANAGER KURT 
MANAGER RASKIN WE HAVE QUITE A 

03:32:53.233 --> 03:32:55.963
LONG LIST TO COUNTER AND THIS 
WILL TURN INTO AN EMBARRASSING 

03:32:56.177 --> 03:32:58.177
AND DIFFICULT MASS. THAT SEEMS 
TO BE THE TACTICAL RESPONSE, 

03:32:58.293 --> 03:33:03.053
THAT THE BOOK THE DIFFICULTY AS 
YOU KNOW FOR THE REPUBLICANS IS 

03:33:03.272 --> 03:33:05.272
THAT THEY 

03:33:07.072 --> 03:33:09.432
DON'T HAVE, THEY MAY NOT HAVE 
THE VOTES IN THE SENATE TO 

03:33:09.652 --> 03:33:11.812
DETERMINE WHAT THE RULES WILL BE
FOR CALLING WITNESSES AND INDEED

03:33:12.032 --> 03:33:14.032
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE 

03:33:17.172 --> 03:33:19.172
RULES APPLY APPROVED THAT WOULD 
INCLUDE THEM TO PROMOTE 

03:33:23.822 --> 03:33:26.652
THE WITNESSES. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A GOOD POINT, YOU 

03:33:26.872 --> 03:33:28.872
KNOW, THIS IS A POLITICAL 
ENDEAVOR AND SO 

03:33:33.412 --> 03:33:35.822
OF COURSE THERE'S POLITICS THAT 
ARE PLAYED OUT ON BOTH SIDES OF 

03:33:36.037 --> 03:33:38.593
THE AISLE BUT THE MORE THE 
REPUBLICANS CAN TRY TO SHOW A 

03:33:38.812 --> 03:33:40.953
FAN'S ARGUMENT AND SAY IF THEY 
GET A WITNESS, WE CAN 

03:33:44.413 --> 03:33:46.533
WITNESS TOO, IT GOES TO HOW THEY
ARE CHARACTERIZING AND COLORING 

03:33:46.753 --> 03:33:48.271
THIS PROCESS TO THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC. 

03:33:48.272 --> 03:33:50.272
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT 

03:33:53.952 --> 03:33:56.243
IS RIGHT. AND YOU ARE SO 
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT TO CALL THIS 

03:33:56.463 --> 03:34:00.886
A POLITICAL PRODUCT. IT DIFFERS 
IN SO MANY WAYS FROM THE RULES, 

03:34:01.092 --> 03:34:05.453
TRADITIONS AND NORMS OF A COURT 
PROCEEDING. AND SO THAT IS PART 

03:34:05.673 --> 03:34:07.673
OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING 

03:34:11.572 --> 03:34:13.572
PLAYING OUT

03:34:15.903 --> 03:34:18.853
. IT IS THE POLITICS OF HOW TO 
PURSUE THIS QUESTION OF DONALD 

03:34:21.173 --> 03:34:25.973
TRUMP'S CULPABILITY, 
RESPONSIBILITY, WAS HE, AS THE 

03:34:26.192 --> 03:34:30.553
DEMOCRATIC MANAGERS HAVE CHARGED
THE PERSON 

03:34:35.572 --> 03:34:39.193
WHO INCITED WHO LIT THE FUSE OF 
THE JANUARY 6th ASSAULT ON THE 

03:34:39.413 --> 03:34:42.013
CAPITAL OR NOT? AND THEY 
BELIEVED THEY 

03:34:45.193 --> 03:34:48.793
HAVE FOUND DURING THE 11th HOUR 
MEETING LAST NIGHT, SOME 

03:34:49.012 --> 03:34:51.012
POTENTIALLY COMPELLING 

03:34:54.193 --> 03:34:56.593
EVIDENCE REGARDING THE CALL 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND 

03:34:57.913 --> 03:35:03.133
REPRESENTATIVE McCARTHY AND SO 
THEY'VE DECIDED NOW TO OPEN UP 

03:35:03.353 --> 03:35:05.353
THIS 

03:35:07.673 --> 03:35:09.803
PANDORA'S BOX OF WITNESSES AND 
SELECTION OF WITNESSES AND THEY 

03:35:09.953 --> 03:35:11.953
ARE DOING SO, AS YOU 

03:35:15.673 --> 03:35:20.333
POINT OUT, THIS IS A POLITICALLY
VOLATILE QUESTION AND THE MOVE 

03:35:20.533 --> 03:35:23.573
BY HOUSE MANAGERS SEEMS TO RUN 
CONTRARY TO THE CAUTIONS THEY 

03:35:23.793 --> 03:35:25.472
RECEIVED FROM SENATE LEADERSHIP,
THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AND 

03:35:25.473 --> 03:35:29.493
EVEN FROM OUR REPORTING SOME OF 
THE CAUTIONS RECEIVED FROM THE 

03:35:29.653 --> 03:35:31.653
BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JUST TWO DAYS 

03:35:34.092 --> 03:35:36.012
AGO,, YOUR COLLEAGUES WERE 
REPORTING ON DEMOCRATS SAYING WE

03:35:36.013 --> 03:35:38.013
JUST HAVE TO MOVE ON SO LET'S 
TALK ABOUT HOW 

03:35:41.232 --> 03:35:45.893
THE DEMOCRATS THAT YOU WERE 
REPORTING ON VIEWED THIS PROCESS

03:35:46.253 --> 03:35:48.253
AND WHAT ADVANTAGES WERE TO JUST
MOVING 

03:35:50.813 --> 03:35:53.232
IT ALONG QUICKLY WITH EXPEDIENCY
AND THEN TRYING TO GET TO THE 

03:35:53.433 --> 03:35:55.433
NEXT PHASE OF THE BIDEN 

03:35:58.173 --> 03:35:59.582
PRESIDENCY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REPORTING EARLIER THIS WEEK 

03:35:59.583 --> 03:36:02.193
AND JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AS
YOU SAID, THEY HAD NOTED THAT 

03:36:02.393 --> 03:36:04.393
THE 

03:36:06.993 --> 03:36:09.032
DEMOCRATIC MANAGERS LED BY A 
CONGRESSMAN JIMMY RASKIN HAD 

03:36:09.643 --> 03:36:14.253
INDEED WANTED TO CALL WITNESSES 
BUT THAT VERY STRONG DESIRE TO 

03:36:14.473 --> 03:36:17.714
FIND WITNESSES AND THEY THOUGHT 
THEY WERE POTENTIALLY DRAMATIC 

03:36:17.933 --> 03:36:19.933
WITNESSES BOTH IN THE LIGHTHOUSE
AND POTENTIALLY IN THE CONGRESS.

03:36:20.065 --> 03:36:22.065
THEIR DESIRE TO DO THAT 

03:36:25.613 --> 03:36:27.613
WAS TEMPERED BY THE POLITICAL 
REALITIES AND THE DESIRES 

03:36:27.683 --> 03:36:31.001
EXPRESSED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN 
HIMSELF, NANCY PELOSI AND 

03:36:35.853 --> 03:36:38.833
SPEAKER SCHUMER, ANY DESIRE TO 
CALL WITNESSES OR HAVE A DRAWN 

03:36:39.052 --> 03:36:40.886
OUT PROCESS TO PROVE THE 
MANAGERS CASE AGAINST DONALD 

03:36:40.887 --> 03:36:43.630
TRUMP HAD TO BE TEMPERED AGAINST
THE POLITICAL REALITIES. 

03:36:43.832 --> 03:36:45.832
POLITICAL REALITY NUMBER ONE, 
THEY NEED 

03:36:49.063 --> 03:36:51.142
TO GET 17 REPUBLIC SENATE VOTES 
TO CONVICT AND THAT SEEMS 

03:36:54.468 --> 03:36:56.468
VERY UNLIKELY AND THERE WAS 
LITTLE, ALMOST NO MOVEMENT AMONG

03:36:56.593 --> 03:37:01.713
REPUBLICANS TOWARD CONVICTION. 
TWO, THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE 

03:37:01.922 --> 03:37:03.922
REALITY OF 

03:37:06.544 --> 03:37:09.233
THIS COUNTRY IN AN ECONOMIC AND 
HEALTH CRISIS AND JILL BIDEN'S 

03:37:09.523 --> 03:37:12.512
DESIRE TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD, 
AND AGENDA FORWARD THAT WOULD 

03:37:12.733 --> 03:37:16.177
NOT BE BOGGED DOWN AS HE SAID BY
THE POLITICS OF 

03:37:21.073 --> 03:37:24.233
THE PAST. IN A JANUARY 12 CALL 
WITH SPEAKER PELOSI, JOE BIDEN 

03:37:24.393 --> 03:37:27.793
SAID WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD, 
THOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME DESIRE 

03:37:28.013 --> 03:37:30.013
TO HOLD DONALD TRUMP RESPONSIBLE
TO, IN 

03:37:34.333 --> 03:37:38.136
ESSENCE, PROSECUTE HIM FOR WHAT 
WAS BELIEVED TO BE POTENTIAL 

03:37:38.333 --> 03:37:40.252
WRONGDOING REGARDING JANUARY 
6th, THAT THERE WERE MORE URGENT

03:37:40.253 --> 03:37:42.873
ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND SO THERE
WAS THIS POLITICAL REALITY 

03:37:43.093 --> 03:37:44.832
TEMPERING THE DESIRE OF THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, THE 

03:37:44.833 --> 03:37:46.833
PROSECUTORS TO 

03:37:48.312 --> 03:37:50.312
CALL WITNESSES AND PROVE THEIR 
CASE WITH DRAMATIC LIVE 

03:37:53.073 --> 03:37:54.545
TESTIMONY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH, REALLY 

03:37:54.546 --> 03:37:56.546
APPRECIATE 

03:37:57.552 --> 03:38:01.893
YOUR TIME. LET'S GO NOW TO OUR 
POLITICAL REPORTER. JOYCE, WE 

03:38:02.103 --> 03:38:04.103
HEARD CHOMPS DEFENSE TEAM 
EARLIER TODAY SAY 

03:38:08.393 --> 03:38:12.853
THEY HOPED TO WRAP EVERYTHING UP
REALLY BY THIS AFTERNOON. SO, 

03:38:13.003 --> 03:38:15.003
WHAT DOES THIS NEW CURVEBALL OF 
POTENTIAL SLATE OF WITNESSES AND

03:38:15.163 --> 03:38:17.613
SUBPOENAS DUE TO THEIR DEFENSE? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP'S 

03:38:17.833 --> 03:38:21.753
DEFENSE TEAM WAS LOOKING TO WRAP
THIS UP TODAY. THEY WERE 

03:38:21.973 --> 03:38:23.973
EXPECTING TO GO HOME TODAY. OUR 
COLLEAGUES HAVE REPORTED THAT 

03:38:24.153 --> 03:38:27.373
THEY ALREADY BOUGHT FLIGHTS HOME
AND THEY HAD, YOU KNOW, HAD 

03:38:27.593 --> 03:38:29.593
THESE 

03:38:30.833 --> 03:38:34.643
VERY SHORT DEFENSE REMARKS 
YESTERDAY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT 

03:38:34.803 --> 03:38:36.873
THIS WOULD BE A RELATIVELY DUE 
PROCESS. ONE OF TRUMP'S 

03:38:38.753 --> 03:38:41.993
ATTORNEYS, DAVID SCHOEN ISN'T 
EVEN ON THE FLOOR TODAY.  HE 

03:38:42.293 --> 03:38:44.293
LEFT YESTERDAY FOR 

03:38:46.352 --> 03:38:49.463
RELIGIOUS RELIGIONS BUT YOU KNOW
HE ISN'T EVEN HERE IN THE MIDST 

03:38:49.703 --> 03:38:54.586
OF EVERYTHING REALLY CHANGING 
TODAY. SO A LOT REALLY TAKING 

03:38:55.920 --> 03:39:01.023
SHAPE TODAY WHEN MOST OF THE 
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM 

03:39:01.233 --> 03:39:04.713
JUST THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD 
VOTE TODAY AND IT WOULD BE OVER 

03:39:04.957 --> 03:39:07.253
BY LUNCH TIME. WE DID HEAR FROM 
SENATOR TED CRUZ WHO SPOKE TO 

03:39:07.473 --> 03:39:10.553
THE REPORTERS JUST A FEW MINUTES
AGO AND HE HAS BEEN IN THESE 

03:39:10.863 --> 03:39:12.672
MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ATTORNEYS ADVISING THEM AND 

03:39:12.673 --> 03:39:15.553
TALKING TO THEM AND THIS IS WHAT
HE HAD TO SAY. HE CALLED THIS 

03:39:15.773 --> 03:39:20.386
POLITICAL THEATER AND SAID THE 
HOUSE MANAGERS WERE FEELING HEAT

03:39:20.707 --> 03:39:25.871
ON THE LEFT AND HE SAID THAT 
THEY DID NOT WANT TO CALL 

03:39:26.756 --> 03:39:30.683
WITNESSES AND HE SAID IF THEY 
DO, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE 

03:39:30.843 --> 03:39:33.503
ONE-SIDED SAYING THAT TRUMP'S 
DEFENSE WOULD ALSO BE CALLING 

03:39:33.653 --> 03:39:35.492
WITNESSES AS WELL. TALKS ABOUT 
NANCY PELOSI SAYING THAT THEY 

03:39:35.493 --> 03:39:37.793
COULD CALL HER AND SHE CAN 
TESTIFY AS TO WHEN SHE KNEW 

03:39:38.213 --> 03:39:40.213
ABOUT THE THREATS ON 

03:39:42.953 --> 03:39:44.953
THE CAPITAL

03:39:50.232 --> 03:39:52.733
, THAT IS FROM TED CRUZ. AND 
THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WAS 

03:39:52.963 --> 03:39:55.863
POSED TO TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM 
YESTERDAY FROM REPUBLICAN 

03:39:56.033 --> 03:39:59.483
SENATORS WHO HAD ASKED THE 
QUESTION OF TRUMP WHEN HE KNEW 

03:39:59.681 --> 03:40:03.603
OF COURSE HE'S THE ONE ON TRIAL.
WHEN HE KNEW AND WHAT YOU DID 

03:40:03.813 --> 03:40:06.463
ABOUT IT AND THEY COULDN'T EVEN 
ANSWER THAT, SO, TED CRUZ 

03:40:06.673 --> 03:40:09.483
THREATENING TO CALL HOUSE 
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI TO ANSWER 

03:40:09.813 --> 03:40:12.993
THOSE QUESTIONS. HE ALSO SAID HE
CALLED THIS OPENING PANDORA'S 

03:40:13.613 --> 03:40:15.934
BOX SAYING THAT THEY ARE THE 
PROSECUTORS THAT THEY HAVEN'T 

03:40:16.151 --> 03:40:18.273
PROVEN THEIR CASE AND THE REASON
WHY HE CALLS THIS A HAIL MARY 

03:40:18.433 --> 03:40:20.062
HAPPENING IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS 
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES. WE ALSO

03:40:20.063 --> 03:40:21.812
SAW JASON MILLER, ONE OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADVISORS, 

03:40:21.813 --> 03:40:24.533
WALKING AROUND VERY VISIBLY WITH
THIS PIECE OF PAPER WITH A LIST 

03:40:24.787 --> 03:40:30.913
OF WITNESSES THAT THE DEFENSE 
COULD CALL HAD A NUMBER OF 301 

03:40:31.523 --> 03:40:38.683
WITNESSES AND ON THAT LIST OF 
NAMES WAS PELOSI, KAMALA HARRIS,

03:40:38.843 --> 03:40:41.973
CHUCK SCHUMER, JUST A FEW OF 
THEM. AND EARLIER, BEFORE THIS 

03:40:42.189 --> 03:40:44.973
ALL SORT OF CAME TO LIGHT BEFORE
THE VOTE AND BEFORE TODAY'S 

03:40:45.203 --> 03:40:47.313
PROCEEDINGS, WE HAD HEARD FROM 
SOMEONE THAT WAS FAMILIAR WITH 

03:40:47.533 --> 03:40:50.993
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM, 
THEIR LEGAL STRATEGIES SAYING 

03:40:51.703 --> 03:40:55.003
THAT TRUMP'S LAWYERS, YOU KNOW, 
WERE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT 

03:40:55.253 --> 03:40:59.633
THAT THERE WERE TALKS ABOUT EVEN
WITNESSES AT THAT POINT AND THEY

03:40:59.853 --> 03:41:01.853
THREATENED TO CALL 

03:41:03.493 --> 03:41:05.493
NANCY PELOSI, MURIEL BOWSER TO 
ASK THEM UNDER OATH AND 

03:41:08.753 --> 03:41:10.753
ON CAMERA WHY THEY DID NOT 
REQUEST ADDITIONAL SECURITY AND 

03:41:10.853 --> 03:41:12.853
NATIONAL 

03:41:14.153 --> 03:41:17.173
GUARD ASSISTANCE. THEY SAID IF 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO GO DOWN THAT 

03:41:17.343 --> 03:41:19.343
ROAD WE ARE READY AND THIS IS 
ACCORDING TO A PERSON FAMILIAR 

03:41:19.393 --> 03:41:21.763
WITH TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM. SO IT 
DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THEY ARE 

03:41:21.913 --> 03:41:24.893
HAPPY. ONE THING WE ARE WAITING 
FOR AND ACTUALLY I SHOULD 

03:41:25.113 --> 03:41:27.113
MENTION THAT IN 

03:41:29.053 --> 03:41:31.653
RELATION TO THAT ASSERTION THAT 
MURIEL BOWSER AND 

03:41:36.672 --> 03:41:40.473
NANCY PELOSI DID NOT CALL ON 
ADDITIONAL SECURITY OR, YOU 

03:41:40.693 --> 03:41:43.753
KNOW, THE REQUEST OF NATIONAL 
GUARD IT IS SIMPLY JUST NOT 

03:41:43.953 --> 03:41:46.113
TRUE. MURIEL BOWSER HAD CALLED 
ON NATIONAL GUARD AND DC COUNCIL

03:41:46.333 --> 03:41:49.073
SAID THAT THAT REQUEST WAS 
DENIED BY THE DEPARTMENT 

03:41:54.093 --> 03:41:57.003
OF DEFENSE AFTER THE GOVERNORS 
OF MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA SAYING 

03:41:57.153 --> 03:41:59.353
THAT INITIALLY THAT REQUEST WAS 
DENIED SO I JUST WANT TO CLEAR 

03:41:59.573 --> 03:42:03.274
THAT UP BUT TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS 
THREATENING TO CALL THOSE 

03:42:03.493 --> 03:42:05.493
WITNESSES TO POTENTIALLY PELOSI 
AND 

03:42:07.853 --> 03:42:10.073
MURIEL BOWSER. WE ARE STILL 
WAITING TO HEAR FROM WHAT IS 

03:42:10.273 --> 03:42:12.273
GOING 

03:42:15.273 --> 03:42:19.353
ON IN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S WORLD. 
HE IS STILL AT CAMP DAVID AND WE

03:42:19.573 --> 03:42:21.516
HAVE NOT HEARD ANY REACTION 
FOLLOWING THIS REVELATION THAT 

03:42:21.517 --> 03:42:26.353
THERE WILL BE WITNESSES CALLED 
IN THIS TRIAL, HIS TEAM HAS 

03:42:26.593 --> 03:42:29.053
RELEASED A SHORT NOTE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL BE MEETING WITH 

03:42:29.193 --> 03:42:32.072
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS LATER
TODAY. 

03:42:32.073 --> 03:42:34.073
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO 

03:42:38.373 --> 03:42:43.312
TO YOU. LET'S TALK THROUGH FIRST
THE REALITY OF HOW LIKELY IS IT 

03:42:43.533 --> 03:42:50.191
THEY COULD GET WITNESSES AND 
THEN WHAT IS THERE POLITICAL 

03:42:50.443 --> 03:42:52.443
ADVANTAGE TO BE CLAMORING FOR 
WITNESSES AND TALKING A 

03:42:56.273 --> 03:42:57.939
LOT ABOUT THAT GOAL OF THEIRS 
RIGHT NOW? 

03:42:57.940 --> 03:43:03.673
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, SO YOU NEED 51 VOTES TO
CALL WITNESSES. IT IS NOT JUST 

03:43:03.873 --> 03:43:06.493
THE REGULAR SENATE, KAMALA 
HARRIS ACTUALLY WOULD NOT BE 

03:43:06.713 --> 03:43:12.513
ABLE TO CAST A TIE-BREAKING VOTE
IN THE FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS. SO IT

03:43:12.733 --> 03:43:14.733
REALLY IS GOING TO COME DOWN 

03:43:17.433 --> 03:43:19.433
TO WHAT A COUPLE OF THESE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE FENCE 

03:43:24.393 --> 03:43:26.393
WILL DO.

03:43:41.693 --> 03:43:43.693
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS SOMEONE 
LIKE 

03:43:45.851 --> 03:43:47.851
NANCY PELOSI AS JOYCE WAS JUST 
TALKING ABOUT, THAT ACTUALLY 

03:43:47.933 --> 03:43:51.853
MIGHT HELP THE DEMOCRATIC CASE. 
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE QUITE 

03:43:52.103 --> 03:43:54.103
COMPELLING FOR THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS TO HAVE 

03:43:58.226 --> 03:44:00.226
NANCY PELOSI SITTING ON THE 
FLOOR OF THE SENATE TALKING 

03:44:00.379 --> 03:44:03.803
ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE THAT DAY 
AND THE HORROR OF IT AND HOW IT 

03:44:04.007 --> 03:44:07.174
HAS AFFECTED HER MEMBERS AND HER
STAFF AND HOW THE DEATH THREATS 

03:44:07.393 --> 03:44:09.393
THAT 

03:44:10.673 --> 03:44:12.793
SHE'S GOTTEN AFTER TRUMP HAS 
ATTACKED HER FOR YEARS AND 

03:44:13.023 --> 03:44:15.023
YEARS, SOME OF THE MOST 
COMPELLING FOOTAGE WAS WHEN 

03:44:19.273 --> 03:44:21.353
THEY SHOWED THE SLASHERS STYLE 
HORROR MOVIE OF THESE CLIPS OF 

03:44:21.574 --> 03:44:23.574
CREEPY 

03:44:25.473 --> 03:44:27.473
GUYS WAVING CONFEDERATE FLAGS 
SAYING, NANCY, WHERE 

03:44:31.733 --> 03:44:34.693
ARE YOU? THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE 
QUITE COMPELLING TO RELITIGATE 

03:44:34.913 --> 03:44:37.289
THAT AND CERTAINLY NOT HELPFUL 
TO TRUMP. 

03:44:37.290 --> 03:44:39.290
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IN ADDITION TO THAT, JAMES, 
WE KNOW FROM 

03:44:42.413 --> 03:44:44.557
IN REAL-TIME THAT PEOPLE LIKE 
THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AND THE

03:44:44.774 --> 03:44:48.243
GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND WERE 
TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS

03:44:48.463 --> 03:44:50.463
CALLING THEM WITH DESPERATE 
PLEAS TO 

03:44:54.473 --> 03:44:56.262
SEND HELP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS EVEN HITS AT THE 

03:44:56.263 --> 03:44:59.240
VALIDITY OF WHAT TRUMP'S LAWYERS
ARE ALLEGING. 

03:44:59.241 --> 03:45:01.241
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
PANDORA'S BOX, 

03:45:04.613 --> 03:45:08.662
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT IT IS NINE 
PEOPLE THE DEMOCRATS COULD CALL.

03:45:08.863 --> 03:45:11.579
BUT NOT ON THAT LIST ARE PEOPLE 
RELATED TO THE MILITARY BECAUSE 

03:45:11.778 --> 03:45:15.464
JOE BIDEN IS NOW PRESIDENT, 
TRUMP REALLY CAN'T CLAIM 

03:45:19.093 --> 03:45:21.093
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OR ARMY 
SECRETARY FROM 

03:45:24.333 --> 03:45:26.754
TALKING ABOUT THE ORDERS THAT 
WERE GIVEN ARE NOT GIVEN. WE DO 

03:45:26.973 --> 03:45:30.206
KNOW FROM IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, 
IT LISTED 

03:45:33.373 --> 03:45:35.373
SEVERAL PEOPLE INCLUDING MIKE 
PENCE BUT TRUMP'S NAME WAS NOT 

03:45:35.513 --> 03:45:38.293
ON THAT LIST. AGAIN YOU SORT OF 
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 

03:45:43.294 --> 03:45:45.294
HOSTILE WITNESSES.

03:45:48.943 --> 03:45:52.333
BUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE 
PENCE BE A HOSTILE WITNESS AND 

03:45:52.593 --> 03:45:54.933
END UP PRAISING TRUMP AND THAT 
COULD END UP NOT HELPING THE 

03:45:55.153 --> 03:45:57.774
CASE BUT IT CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE
GOING TO START OPENING THE DOOR 

03:45:57.994 --> 03:46:00.970
AND HAVE REPUBLICANS PULLING IN 
THAT PEOPLE LIKE NANCY PELOSI 

03:46:01.334 --> 03:46:04.613
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PRESSURE 
FROM THE LEFT OF SENATE 

03:46:04.813 --> 03:46:07.174
DEMOCRATS TO SAY LET'S CALL MIKE
PENCE, LET'S CALL MARK MEADOWS 

03:46:12.113 --> 03:46:14.393
AND THAT, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY 
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO WATCH AS

03:46:14.534 --> 03:46:19.013
A TEST VOTE FOR HOW MANY 
REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU

03:46:24.033 --> 03:46:26.033
GET ROMNEY

03:46:27.813 --> 03:46:29.813
THAT IS WHY THIS IS 

03:46:31.913 --> 03:46:34.275
SO FASCINATING AND SO MUCH CHAOS
RIGHT NOW BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN

03:46:38.553 --> 03:46:40.453
THE CAPITAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS 12:16 RIGHT NOW WHICH 

03:46:40.454 --> 03:46:42.454
MEANS 

03:46:45.073 --> 03:46:47.406
THERE'S ABOUT 16 MINUTES LEFT 
UNTIL THEY COME BACK AND. SO WE 

03:46:47.607 --> 03:46:49.913
WILL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
IT REALLY IS TRULY A BIG? 

03:46:53.813 --> 03:46:56.830
AND SO WE ARE WATCHING TO SEE AT
12:30 IF WE GET MORE CLARITY ON 

03:46:57.033 --> 03:46:59.033
JUST WHAT WITNESSES MAY BE IN 
THE 

03:47:03.334 --> 03:47:05.853
MIX, RHONDA. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE ALL 

03:47:06.073 --> 03:47:08.654
LEARNING IS THIS HAPPEN SO WE 
ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE NEXT

03:47:08.873 --> 03:47:10.873
STEPS ARE, WHAT OUTSIDES ARE 

03:47:13.173 --> 03:47:15.233
AGREEING TO, BUT THEIR THINKING 
IS RIGHT NOW. I AND THINKING 

03:47:15.434 --> 03:47:17.793
BACK TO THE LAST IMPEACHMENT AND
THE QUESTION OF WITNESSES WAS A 

03:47:18.013 --> 03:47:20.013
REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND IF 
EVERYONE REMEMBERS THERE WAS A 

03:47:20.194 --> 03:47:23.233
SERIES OF CLOSED DOOR THE 
POSITIONS WHERE THEY CAME A 

03:47:23.453 --> 03:47:25.453
DETAILED WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT 
THE UKRAINE CALL BUT LATER 

03:47:25.633 --> 03:47:27.633
WITNESSES WERE ON FRONT OF THE 
HOUSE 

03:47:30.233 --> 03:47:32.233
IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEES WHICH WAS
LED BY THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND 

03:47:32.513 --> 03:47:35.094
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES AND 
THERE WAS 

03:47:39.873 --> 03:47:43.513
THIS -- THERE WAS THIS THEME 
THAT WAS NOT A 

03:47:48.514 --> 03:47:53.473
FAIR PROCESS A GROUP THAT WILL 
AGREE TO WHO HAS WITNESSES AND 

03:47:53.693 --> 03:47:58.463
WHAT WITNESSES THERE ARE AND HOW
MANY WITNESSES COME TO THIS, 

03:47:58.693 --> 03:48:01.083
THEY MIGHT START THOSE CLAIMS 
THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THE 

03:48:01.313 --> 03:48:03.313
WITNESSES THAT THEY WANTED WHICH

03:48:06.633 --> 03:48:08.522
WAS SOMETHING THAT THE HOUSE 
REPUBLICANS DURING THE LAST 

03:48:08.523 --> 03:48:10.833
IMPEACHMENT REALLY TALKED A LOT 
ABOUT. MAJOR SAID THAT THIS WAS 

03:48:11.036 --> 03:48:13.843
A SHAM PROCESS ALL THE WAY UP 
INTO THE DAY OF THE VOTE OR 

03:48:14.023 --> 03:48:16.174
IMPEACHMENT OF THE HOUSE THEY 
KEPT SAYING THEY DIDN'T GET THE 

03:48:16.383 --> 03:48:18.546
WITNESSES THEY WANTED TO WHEN 
YOU DO OPEN THE DOOR FOR 

03:48:18.764 --> 03:48:20.764
WITNESSES THERE'S ALSO THIS 
CHRIS WARE BECOMES A 

03:48:25.214 --> 03:48:28.784
VERY PARTISAN AND YOU COULD HEAR
CLAIMS FROM THE REPUBLICAN 

03:48:29.033 --> 03:48:31.293
SENATORS AS WELL AS TRUMP'S 
DEFENSE TEAM SAYING, WELL, WE 

03:48:31.523 --> 03:48:33.993
WANTED THESE WITNESSES BUT THEY 
WOULDN'T LET US HAVE THEM. SO 

03:48:34.253 --> 03:48:36.704
THAT IS ANOTHER PART AND FACTOR 
OF OPENING UP THE IDEA OF 

03:48:36.924 --> 03:48:39.294
WITNESSES IN THIS BUT OF COURSE 
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR DETAILS

03:48:39.517 --> 03:48:41.883
TO EMERGE AS TO WHERE THEY GO 
NEXT. 

03:48:41.884 --> 03:48:47.866
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JOINING US NOW BY PHONE IS 
ROSALYN, YOU BEEN WRITING ABOUT 

03:48:48.734 --> 03:48:54.881
THIS DEBATE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT 

03:48:59.643 --> 03:49:01.643
KNEW ABOUT 

03:49:05.063 --> 03:49:13.594
THE DANGER THAT HE WAS 

03:49:17.313 --> 03:49:24.143
IN ON THE SIXTH AND HOW 

03:49:29.174 --> 03:49:36.212
REACTED TO THAT INFORMATION PLUS

03:49:40.074 --> 03:49:49.113
HELP GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT 
ANSWER. 

03:49:49.114 --> 03:49:51.114
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

03:49:52.114 --> 03:49:59.163
YEAH, THERE ARE A TON 

03:50:04.634 --> 03:50:10.144
PEOPLE THAT COULD HELP 

03:50:17.673 --> 03:50:22.763
ON THAT INCLUDING 

03:50:29.764 --> 03:50:34.963
IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

03:50:41.984 --> 03:50:51.217
AT THE TIME BUT ALSO SOME PEOPLE
WHO ARE RIGHT THERE IN THE 

03:50:51.434 --> 03:50:53.757
SENATE CHAMBER, WE KNOW THAT 
AFTER, SHORTLY AFTER THE SENATE 

03:50:53.974 --> 03:50:56.254
ACTION WAS HALTED BY THE WRITERS
THAT DAY, THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

03:50:56.474 --> 03:50:58.904
PLAYED THE PHONE CALL. HE WAS 
TRYING TO REACH HIM BUT HE 

03:50:59.184 --> 03:51:01.184
ACTUALLY CALLED SENATOR MICHAEL 
E AND SO THEY HAVE SOME 

03:51:01.323 --> 03:51:03.344
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS DOING AND THINKING

03:51:03.554 --> 03:51:05.967
IN THOSE HOURS AS DOES, YOU 
KNOW, THE THEN HOUSE MINORITY 

03:51:06.163 --> 03:51:08.883
LEADER, KEVIN McCARTHY LET ME 
SEE HOW TO PHRASE THIS, THERE IS

03:51:09.113 --> 03:51:11.757
A QUESTION ABOUT HOW MIKE LEE 
WANTS IT IN THE RECORD AS JUST 

03:51:11.994 --> 03:51:14.564
HOW HIS NAME WAS INVOKED EARLY 
IN THIS PROCESS, RIGHT? SO, 

03:51:14.794 --> 03:51:17.264
LET'S TALK ABOUT SENATOR LEE AND
THE RELEVANCE AND SORT OF, YOU 

03:51:17.493 --> 03:51:19.493
KNOW, WHAT HIM STAYING AND 
TRYING TO OBJECT ACTUALLY MEANT 

03:51:19.714 --> 03:51:22.442
FOR BOTH THE PROCESS AS WELL AS 
CLARITY ON WHAT HE KNOWS. 

03:51:22.443 --> 03:51:25.574
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. I'M GOING TO START AT 
THE END OF THAT. SO, HERE'S WHAT

03:51:25.804 --> 03:51:28.353
APPARENTLY HE KNOWS. HE KNOWS HE
RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THEN 

03:51:28.553 --> 03:51:30.553
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT AFTER 
SENATE ACTION WAS HALTED THAT 

03:51:30.584 --> 03:51:33.033
DAY. ON THE LINE WAS TRUMP. HE 
APPARENTLY BEGAN THE CALL BY 

03:51:33.254 --> 03:51:35.283
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE, HEY 
TOMMY, FROM WHICH BIKE WE 

03:51:35.494 --> 03:51:37.491
UNDERSTOOD THAT TRUMP WAS 
ACTUALLY TRYING TO REACH TOMMY 

03:51:37.492 --> 03:51:39.786
TURBERVILLE. HE APPARENTLY HAD 
THE WRONG NUMBER. WE HAD HE HAD 

03:51:40.013 --> 03:51:42.034
PREVIOUSLY SAID HE THEN HANDED 
HIS PHONE OVER TO TOMMY 

03:51:42.274 --> 03:51:44.794
TURBERVILLE AND THE TWO OF THEM 
SPOKE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. NOW, 

03:51:45.033 --> 03:51:47.323
THERE HAD BEEN THIS QUESTION 
ABOUT THE FIRST TIME OF THAT 

03:51:47.565 --> 03:51:49.823
PHONE CALL AND THE REASON IS 
BECAUSE AT 2:24 P.M. THAT 

03:51:50.064 --> 03:51:52.184
AFTERNOON, DONALD TRUMP TREATED 
A NEW ATTACK OF THE VICE 

03:51:52.404 --> 03:51:54.924
PRESIDENT. HE TREATED THAT MIKE 
PENCE LACKED COURAGE. AND THEY 

03:51:55.174 --> 03:51:57.754
TOLD TRUMP ON THAT PHONE CALL 
THAT MIKE PENCE HAD JUST BEEN 

03:51:57.993 --> 03:52:00.313
EVACUATED FROM THE CHAMBER SO 
THERE WAS THIS QUESTION. IS IT 

03:52:00.554 --> 03:52:02.533
POSSIBLE THAT TRUMP PADS 
LITERALLY JUST BEEN TOLD BY 

03:52:02.534 --> 03:52:04.934
TURBERVILLE THAT HIS VICE 
PRESIDENT WAS IN DANGER AND HE 

03:52:05.184 --> 03:52:07.163
THEN RESPONDED TO THAT 
INFORMATION BY TWEETING A NEW 

03:52:07.164 --> 03:52:09.674
ATTACK ON HIM? IT LOOKS LIKE 
THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. IT 

03:52:09.904 --> 03:52:12.953
MIGHT BE JUST TODAY A CELL PHONE
LOG FROM THE CALL AND WE HAVE 

03:52:13.204 --> 03:52:15.204
NOW GIVEN THAT AS WELL AS THE 
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.

03:52:19.794 --> 03:52:21.794
THE 

03:52:23.913 --> 03:52:27.203
FIRST THINK THING THAT HE THINGS
TO DO IS CALL TOMMY TO REVEAL. 

03:52:27.454 --> 03:52:29.454
WHY TOMMY TURBERVILLE? BECAUSE 

03:52:33.074 --> 03:52:38.124
HE WAS OBJECTING TO THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE. HE WAS 

03:52:38.324 --> 03:52:40.324
PURSUING THE EFFORTS TO STOP 
THIS CERTIFICATION PROCESS AS 

03:52:40.334 --> 03:52:42.874
THE RIDER STORMED THROUGH THE 
BUILDING. HE WAS THEN TOLD IN A 

03:52:43.114 --> 03:52:45.674
FOUR MINUTE PHONE CALL THAT, YOU
KNOW, AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT 

03:52:45.924 --> 03:52:47.924
ARE GOING ON, THE SENATE IS 

03:52:51.193 --> 03:52:53.193
BEING EVACUATED AND HIS OWN VICE
PRESIDENT HAD JUST BEEN 

03:52:53.417 --> 03:52:57.868
EVACUATED AND, YOU KNOW, HE HAD 
JUST TWEETED THIS ATTACK. DID HE

03:52:58.234 --> 03:53:04.717
GO ON TWITTER AND SAY, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK ABOUT MY 

03:53:05.383 --> 03:53:13.944
VICE PRESIDENT, TO PLEASE DON'T 
HURT HIM, PLEASE DON'T DO 

03:53:14.984 --> 03:53:19.607
VIOLENCE. GO HOME, WE 

03:53:25.786 --> 03:53:27.786
PENCE MORE 

03:53:31.364 --> 03:53:39.303
IN COMING DAYS. NO, HE DOESN'T 

03:53:45.676 --> 03:53:55.063
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HE DOESN'T 
FOR 

03:53:57.893 --> 03:54:05.664
A WHILE LONGER BEFORE HE SAYS 

03:54:10.314 --> 03:54:19.084
PEACEFUL WHICH THEY HAVE NOTED 
AS KIND 

03:54:23.044 --> 03:54:29.574
OF AN ODD THING TO 

03:54:36.094 --> 03:54:45.764
A CROWD THAT IT WAS AT THAT 

03:54:48.904 --> 03:54:55.158
VERY MOMENT COMMITTING VIOLENCE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

03:55:01.174 --> 03:55:11.094
APPRECIATE YOU LAYING OUT THIS 
TIMELINE AND DIGGING INTO THIS 

03:55:11.455 --> 03:55:14.014
BECAUSE AS YOU POINT OUT, YOU 
KNOW, THE FACTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO

03:55:14.214 --> 03:55:16.233
UNDERSTANDING, YOU KNOW, WHAT 
HAPPENED, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU 

03:55:16.464 --> 03:55:18.744
BRING UP SOME REALLY IMPORTANT 
POINTS ABOUT, OKAY, SO IF THE 

03:55:18.993 --> 03:55:21.094
TIMELINE IS CLARIFIED AND NOW 
AND CORRECTED, WHAT DOES THAT 

03:55:21.304 --> 03:55:23.364
STILL SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S 
KNOWLEDGE THAT AFTERNOON? RIGHT?

03:55:23.634 --> 03:55:26.563
THE SENATORS WANT TO KNOW WHAT 
DID HE KNOW THAT MIKE PENCE FOR 

03:55:26.794 --> 03:55:29.904
EXAMPLE WAS IN DANGER. WHEN DID 
HE KNOW IT AND WHAT DID HE DO? 

03:55:30.124 --> 03:55:33.714
AS YOU POINT OUT, HE DIDN'T COME
OUT AND USE SOCIAL MEDIA OR ANY 

03:55:33.914 --> 03:55:36.838
OTHER TOOL AT HIS DISPOSAL TO 
TRY TO CALM THE CROWDS AND I 

03:55:37.093 --> 03:55:39.704
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT 
OUT THAT TWITTER IS NOT THE ONLY

03:55:39.934 --> 03:55:42.364
TOOL AT HIS DISPOSAL. COULD'VE 
GONE INTO THE BRIEFING ROOM, 

03:55:42.614 --> 03:55:45.707
DONE IN OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS HE CAN 

03:55:45.913 --> 03:55:48.137
COMMUNICATE WITH THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC. SO YOU KNOW, AS HOUSE 

03:55:48.398 --> 03:55:50.398
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND TRUMP'S
LAWYERS TRY TO PROVE THEIR 

03:55:50.627 --> 03:55:53.063
POINTS HERE, HOW SIGNIFICANT 
WILL THIS TIMELINE BE TO BOTH OF

03:55:53.304 --> 03:55:55.713
THEIR, YOU KNOW, LINES OF EITHER
ATTACK OR DEFENSE? 

03:55:55.714 --> 03:55:58.434
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF 
INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY IN 

03:55:58.684 --> 03:56:00.754
THE PUBLIC REALM. IN PART 
BECAUSE THESE EVENTS WERE NOT 

03:56:01.005 --> 03:56:03.754
HIDDEN OR SECRET. THEY HAPPENED 
IN REAL TIME AND WE WATCHED IT 

03:56:04.014 --> 03:56:06.684
UNFOLD ON OUR TELEVISION. SO WE 
NOW THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY LAID 

03:56:06.914 --> 03:56:09.748
OUT FOR THE SENATORS AS PART OF 
THEIR CASE, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW 

03:56:09.985 --> 03:56:11.985
THAT THE COUNTING OF THE 
ELECTORAL VOTE WAS HALTED 

03:56:12.104 --> 03:56:14.726
BECAUSE THERE WERE WRITERS IN 
THE BUILDING. AND WE KNOW THAT 

03:56:15.043 --> 03:56:17.524
ALL OVER THE NEWS THAT 
AFTERNOON, AS SOON AS THAT 

03:56:17.724 --> 03:56:20.263
HAPPENED, THAT BECAME THE STORY 
OF THE DAY AND THERE WERE ALL 

03:56:20.494 --> 03:56:22.954
KINDS OF WRITERS SORT OF 
BATTLING WITH COPS ON THE FRONT 

03:56:23.204 --> 03:56:26.488
STEPS HE DIDN'T TWEET ABOUT WHAT
WAS GOING ON UNTIL 2:38 P.M., 

03:56:26.711 --> 03:56:29.098
WHICH WAS ABOUT 40 MINUTES AFTER
THE WRITERS HAD BREACHED THE 

03:56:29.348 --> 03:56:31.554
OUTSIDE PERIMETER OF THE 
CAPITAL. THIS IS THE TWEET WHERE

03:56:31.824 --> 03:56:34.274
HE SAYS STAY PEACEFUL. IT THEN 
TAKES THEM ANOTHER MAYBE HALF 

03:56:34.514 --> 03:56:37.197
HOUR BEFORE HE SENDS A SECOND 
TWEET AND THEN ANOTHER HOUR 

03:56:37.425 --> 03:56:40.614
BEFORE HE PUTS OUT A VIDEO WHERE
HE TELLS THE WRITERS TO GO HOME.

03:56:40.864 --> 03:56:43.631
BUT IN THAT VIDEO, IT HAD BEEN 
REALLY RATE OUT REPEATEDLY IN 

03:56:43.897 --> 03:56:46.904
THE TRIAL, HE ALSO HAS ALL THESE
OTHER COMMENTS ABOUT HOW HE 

03:56:47.084 --> 03:56:49.938
KNOWS HOW THEY FEEL AND HOW, YOU
KNOW, THAT HE LOVES THEM, THEY 

03:56:50.207 --> 03:56:53.265
WERE VERY SPECIAL. SO, ALL OF 
THAT IS PUBLIC. THERE IS ALSO A 

03:56:53.524 --> 03:56:56.424
PRIVATE COMPONENT. THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE WHITE 

03:56:56.854 --> 03:56:58.854
HOUSE AND KNOW WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS SAYING. THERE ARE 

03:56:59.064 --> 03:57:01.902
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO TRIED TO
REACH THEM THAT DAY. HE WAS 

03:57:02.134 --> 03:57:04.244
FRUSTRATED BY HIS INABILITY TO 
REACH TRUMP AND BY HOW 

03:57:04.474 --> 03:57:07.187
DISTRACTED HE SEEMED AND THAT HE
WASN'T ACTING MORE QUICKLY. SO, 

03:57:07.414 --> 03:57:09.414
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY SENATE 
ACTION HAS BEEN BROKEN TODAY 

03:57:09.596 --> 03:57:11.596
BECAUSE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
CALLING WITNESSES AND SPEAKING 

03:57:11.754 --> 03:57:13.754
DOCUMENTS. THERE'S A LOT MORE 
INFORMATION WE COULD LEARN 

03:57:13.843 --> 03:57:16.424
THROUGH THE AVENUES BY WITNESS 
TESTIMONY. HAVING SAID THAT, WE 

03:57:16.664 --> 03:57:19.074
ALSO KIND OF KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
THAT AFTERNOON AT THE HIGH 

03:57:19.364 --> 03:57:21.153
LEVEL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ARE THERE STILL MORE 

03:57:21.154 --> 03:57:23.354
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF 
THE TIMELINE AND WHAT 

03:57:23.595 --> 03:57:25.123
INFORMATION WE ARE ALSO LOOKING 
FOR? 

03:57:25.124 --> 03:57:27.672
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM 
KEVIN McCARTHY HIMSELF ABOUT 

03:57:27.939 --> 03:57:30.734
THIS PHONE CALL HE HAD WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW. IT IS ONE 

03:57:30.964 --> 03:57:32.772
THING TO HEAR FROM ANOTHER 
CONGRESSWOMAN, JAMIE HERRERA 

03:57:32.773 --> 03:57:34.994
BUTLER ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS TOLD 
BY KEVIN McCARTHY HAPPENED 

03:57:38.654 --> 03:57:42.674
ON IT. ONLY WHAT HE TOLD HIS 
COLLEAGUES IS THAT THE PRESIDENT

03:57:42.904 --> 03:57:47.044
TOLD HIM ON THAT PHONE CALL THAT
THE WRITERS APPEAR TO CARE MORE 

03:57:47.264 --> 03:57:49.886
ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN KEVIN IN
KEVIN 

03:57:54.054 --> 03:57:58.074
McCARTHY DID. AT THE MOMENT HE'S
BEING TOLD BY ONE OF HIS CLOSEST

03:57:58.324 --> 03:58:02.264
ALLIES IN THE HOUSE THAT THEY 
ARE DOING VIOLENCE AND 

03:58:02.518 --> 03:58:06.792
THREATENING HIS OWN PEOPLE. I 
WOULD LIKE SOMEDAY TO HEAR FROM 

03:58:07.024 --> 03:58:10.273
KEVIN McCARTHY ABOUT THAT. THE 
OTHER PIECE THAT I THINK REMAINS

03:58:11.434 --> 03:58:14.357
SOMEWHAT FUZZY AND WOULD BE GOOD
TO HAVE MORE CLARITY ABOUT IS 

03:58:15.674 --> 03:58:19.544
MORE ON THE NATIONAL GUARD 
QUESTION. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 

03:58:21.534 --> 03:58:23.714
REPORTING ABOUT A SORT OF SERIES
OF MEETINGS THAT 

03:58:28.274 --> 03:58:30.274
TOOK PLACE

03:59:14.126 --> 03:59:20.012
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING 
THE TIME TO TALK WITH US. IN A 

03:59:20.293 --> 03:59:22.836
MOMENT WE WILL HEAD BACK TO THE 
SENATE CHAMBER AS THEY ARE 

03:59:23.044 --> 03:59:25.044
ANTICIPATED 

03:59:27.554 --> 03:59:32.298
TO RESUME THAT THERE IS 
INCREASING CHATTER THAT STILL 

03:59:32.547 --> 03:59:36.314
CALL ENDED TODAY, BOTH SIDES OF 
THE AISLE SAY THEY ARE 

03:59:36.524 --> 03:59:38.524
DISCUSSING ALLOWING THE 
STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN 

03:59:38.914 --> 03:59:40.914
HERRERA BUTLER INTO THE RECORD 
THAT STATEMENT THAT SHE HAS 

03:59:41.054 --> 03:59:43.054
SHARED THAT WOULD CLOSE 

03:59:46.734 --> 03:59:50.664
OFF WITNESSES AND THEN PROCEED 
TO CLOSING STATEMENTS. SO THAT 

03:59:50.876 --> 03:59:53.314
WOULD MEAN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO
HEAR FROM HER IN PERSON, GET 

03:59:57.234 --> 04:00:01.454
A DEPOSITION AND MIKE IS SAYING 
THAT ONE OF THE IMPEACHMENT 

04:00:01.704 --> 04:00:03.523
MANAGERS CONGRESSWOMAN WHEN 
ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE DEAL 

04:00:03.524 --> 04:00:06.898
DID NOT DENY, THEY WERE WORKING 
ON THE ISSUE. ONE OF 

04:00:11.834 --> 04:00:14.724
THE DEMOCRATS SAID I THINK MOST 
SENATORS WOULD SUPPORT THAT. SO 

04:00:14.894 --> 04:00:19.873
THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT THAT
COULD BE ONE OFFRAMP HERE. 

04:00:19.874 --> 04:00:22.584
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ABSOLUTELY. ONE OF HIS BEST 
FRIENDS IN THE SENATE HOLDS HIS 

04:00:27.234 --> 04:00:31.564
SENATE SEAT AND THERE IS A 
DESIRE BY DEMOCRATS NOT TO OPEN 

04:00:31.784 --> 04:00:34.513
THE PANDORA'S BOX ESPECIALLY BY 
PEOPLE LIKE HIM AND WE JUST SAW 

04:00:34.758 --> 04:00:36.894
MICHAEL BENNET FROM COLORADO 
WALK BY WHO WOULD BE IN THAT 

04:00:37.114 --> 04:00:39.114
SAME CAMP AS WELL AND THIS 

04:00:42.553 --> 04:00:44.553
COULD BE

04:00:49.674 --> 04:00:51.978
THEY WOULD BE STIPULATING WHICH 
MEANS THEY ARE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE 

04:00:52.184 --> 04:00:54.276
INKING, ACCEPTED AS TRUE THAT 
THE CALL TOOK PLACE 

04:00:57.692 --> 04:00:59.894
AS DESCRIBED BY HERRERA BUTLER. 
THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THEIR 

04:01:00.124 --> 04:01:02.284
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE THE 
VOTES TO PREVAIL EVEN IF THEY 

04:01:02.494 --> 04:01:04.944
ACKNOWLEDGE FOR THE RECORD WHICH
IS WHAT THIS DEAL WOULD MEAN 

04:01:05.168 --> 04:01:07.544
THAT TRUMP WAS FOCUSED ON, YOU 
KNOW, NOT 

04:01:12.074 --> 04:01:14.074
SENDING HELP THAT TRUMP RESISTED
CALLS FROM HIS CLOSEST 

04:01:14.274 --> 04:01:18.604
REPUBLICAN ALLIES FROM KEVIN 
McCARTHY TO COME TO THE AID OF 

04:01:18.844 --> 04:01:20.844
THESE 

04:01:22.634 --> 04:01:24.915
IMPERILED LAWMAKERS. SO, I THINK
THAT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR 

04:01:25.123 --> 04:01:28.994
SOME OF THOSE ON THE FENCE 
REPUBLICANS IF THEY AGREE TO 

04:01:29.264 --> 04:01:31.264
THAT STIPULATION FOR PEOPLE LIKE
MARKOWSKI, COLLINS 

04:01:34.014 --> 04:01:36.153
AND ROMNEY IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
DEFENSE TEAM SAYS, YEAH, THAT IS

04:01:36.355 --> 04:01:40.874
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID. BUT IT 
ALSO WOULD MEAN THE NEED TO HEAR

04:01:41.094 --> 04:01:44.534
FROM ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WHO 
WOULD TESTIFY TO THAT EFFECT 

04:01:44.754 --> 04:01:46.754
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE 
TEAM WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY 

04:01:51.714 --> 04:01:53.714
ADMITTING IT.

04:02:08.924 --> 04:02:11.207
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE FROM 
THE WASHINGTON POST AND WE WILL 

04:02:11.408 --> 04:02:15.874
BRING THIS TO YOU. SENATOR PAT 
LEAHY IS IN THE CHAIR, HE IS THE

04:02:16.095 --> 04:02:18.924
PRESIDING OFFICER OVER THIS 
TRIAL, IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS NOT 

04:02:19.094 --> 04:02:25.374
THE SUPREME COURT'S CHIEF. IT IS
ALSO NOT KAMALA HARRIS WHO OFTEN

04:02:25.594 --> 04:02:28.534
ACTS AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE 
IN HER ROLE AS VICE PRESIDENT 

04:02:28.734 --> 04:02:30.734
AND SENATOR LEAHY IS LEADING 

04:02:34.994 --> 04:02:36.994
THIS GROUP. WE CAN SEE SOME OF 
THE LAWYER/IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

04:02:38.454 --> 04:02:40.594
GATHERED NOW. WE WILL BE WAITING
TO SEE WHEN THEY GAVEL 

04:02:43.614 --> 04:02:46.594
BACK IN AND LET US ALL KNOW JUST
WHAT NEXT STEPS WILL BE TAKEN. I

04:02:46.795 --> 04:02:48.795
WANT TO 

04:02:52.034 --> 04:02:54.034
REMIND YOU

04:03:23.693 --> 04:03:25.693
THAT IS THE STATEMENT PUT OUT BY
WASHINGTON STATE REPUBLICAN 

04:03:25.874 --> 04:03:27.874
CONGRESSWOMAN 

04:03:29.914 --> 04:03:31.914
HERRERA BUTLER. WE CAN SEE MITT 
ROMNEY THEY'RE TALKING TO 

04:03:32.095 --> 04:03:35.155
REPORTERS. HE IS OF COURSE 
SOMEONE OF INTEREST. WE WILL 

04:03:35.374 --> 04:03:38.594
WANT TO KNOW IF THIS ARRANGEMENT
WOULD SATISFY HIM BECAUSE HE'S 

04:03:38.814 --> 04:03:40.814
ONE OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO HAS 
VOTED 

04:03:43.574 --> 04:03:45.513
ON THIS ABILITY TO CALL 
WITNESSES. NOW JUST WHICH 

04:03:45.514 --> 04:03:49.974
WITNESSES THEY WOULD BE HAVE YET
TO BE VOTED ON BY MEMBERS OF THE

04:03:50.192 --> 04:03:54.554
SENATE. RHONDA, THERE'S BEEN 
SOME ATTACKS AGAINST 

04:03:54.804 --> 04:03:56.804
CONGRESSWOMAN ALREADY 

04:03:58.654 --> 04:04:00.654
FROM FRESHMAN 

04:04:03.874 --> 04:04:05.874
TAYLOR GREEN

04:04:22.894 --> 04:04:24.894
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

04:04:26.374 --> 04:04:28.444
THAT'S RIGHT. WHATEVER COMES, 
WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO LEARN HERE 

04:04:28.664 --> 04:04:30.664
WHEN THEY MAKE 

04:04:34.113 --> 04:04:36.694
A DECISION, THEY ARE JUST 
SHOWING THAT THAT IMPEACHMENT 

04:04:36.894 --> 04:04:38.894
TRIAL DID NOT GO THROUGH 

04:04:43.154 --> 04:04:45.154
AS SMOOTHLY

04:04:50.408 --> 04:04:52.408
THIS IS SIGNALING THAT A LOT OF 

04:04:55.754 --> 04:04:57.473
SENATE REPUBLICANS LIKE ROMNEY, 
COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, THEY ARE 

04:04:57.474 --> 04:04:59.855
TROUBLED BY THE DETAILS THEY 
LEARNED TO SPEAK SO, WHATEVER 

04:05:00.075 --> 04:05:03.299
HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES 
WE DO KNOW THAT THIS PROCESS DID

04:05:03.500 --> 04:05:05.500
NOT MOVE FORWARD 

04:05:07.574 --> 04:05:09.744
AS QUICKLY AS TAUGHT BY THE 
SENATE REPUBLICANS OR AS QUICKLY

04:05:09.964 --> 04:05:11.964
AS IT DID THE LAST 

04:05:14.454 --> 04:05:16.103
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, WE ALL KNOW THAT 

04:05:16.104 --> 04:05:18.104
CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE TAYLOR 
GREEN IS SEEN AS A REAL OUTLIER 

04:05:18.274 --> 04:05:22.346
IN THE REPUBLICAN RANKS, BUT, 
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 

04:05:22.546 --> 04:05:25.914
AMERICANS WHO STILL SUPPORT 
DONALD TRUMP AND WHO STILL 

04:05:26.134 --> 04:05:28.295
BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTION WAS 
STOLEN, WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT 

04:05:28.514 --> 04:05:30.514
TRUE. WHAT SORT OF PERIL CAN 

04:05:33.634 --> 04:05:35.614
CONGRESSWOMAN PUT HERRERA BUTLER
BE IN WASHINGTON WITH THIS 

04:05:35.615 --> 04:05:37.615
INFORMATION SHE 

04:05:40.174 --> 04:05:41.933
IS SHARING? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHE'S IN A REALLY INTERESTING

04:05:41.934 --> 04:05:43.934
POSITION BECAUSE WASHINGTON 
STATE IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES 

04:05:44.065 --> 04:05:46.294
IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS A TOP 
TWO PRIMARY SYSTEM. SO SHE 

04:05:46.514 --> 04:05:50.015
DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT JUST
LOSING A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 

04:05:50.234 --> 04:05:55.294
INSTEAD EVERY CANDIDATE, 
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT WOULD 

04:05:55.544 --> 04:05:57.544
VOTE 

04:05:59.814 --> 04:06:02.175
AND SO THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY 
WOULD MEAN SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO 

04:06:02.434 --> 04:06:05.874
GET REELECTED WITH DEMOCRATIC 
VOTES OVER KIND OF A CHALLENGE. 

04:06:06.095 --> 04:06:08.095
IT IS THE 

04:06:11.555 --> 04:06:13.555
SAME WAY

04:06:28.046 --> 04:06:30.574
WE ALL KNOW IT IS A CONCERN OF 
MANY REPUBLICANS AND IS THIS 

04:06:30.795 --> 04:06:32.795
SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO WEIGH IN 
THIS POLITICAL PROCESS FRANKLY 

04:06:32.901 --> 04:06:34.901
AND WE EVEN HEARD THROUGH 

04:06:38.758 --> 04:06:42.104
THE PRIMARY THE WORD DANGLED AND
USED A LOT BY TRUMP'S LAWYERS, 

04:06:42.305 --> 04:06:44.415
THEY WERE USING IT IN RELATION 
TO SOMETHING ELSE. EVERY TIME 

04:06:44.634 --> 04:06:47.474
YOU BRING UP THAT WORD IT CAN'T 
HELP BUT RESONATE FOR THEIR 

04:06:47.675 --> 04:06:53.815
FUTURE MEDICAL FATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, IT WAS FUNNY, TO ONE OF

04:06:55.794 --> 04:06:57.794
THE SENATORS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY
TEXTING ME OF THAT 

04:07:02.554 --> 04:07:07.535
WAS HAPPENING I RESPONDED AND 
SAID WELL ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY 

04:07:07.754 --> 04:07:12.154
IS GOOD TO REMIND THEM FOR THE 
PURPOSES BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE 

04:07:12.365 --> 04:07:15.500
THEM LESS LIKELY TO CROSS HIM 
AND HE SAID ACTUALLY YOU ARE 

04:07:15.700 --> 04:07:17.700
RIGHT THAT IS A 

04:07:21.355 --> 04:07:23.355
GOOD POINT.

04:07:33.515 --> 04:07:36.495
WE WILL SEE IF THAT WILL SATISFY
JUST WHAT SENATORS WANT 

04:07:41.515 --> 04:07:43.515
TO HEAR.

04:07:59.715 --> 04:08:03.126
IN RESPONSE, MICHAEL VANITY 
THREATENED TO CALL 100 WITNESSES

04:08:05.807 --> 04:08:07.807
AND GATHER 100 WITNESSES BACK IN
PHILADELPHIA WHICH 

04:08:12.315 --> 04:08:14.315
OBVIOUSLY WOULD

04:08:19.445 --> 04:08:21.174
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. AND FOR THOSE OF US 

04:08:21.175 --> 04:08:23.558
WHO WERE WATCHING THE EARLIER 
PART OF THIS, HE WAS SORT OF 

04:08:23.754 --> 04:08:25.754
ARGUING ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT 
THAT IS NOT 

04:08:30.255 --> 04:08:32.255
WHAT HAPPENED

04:08:34.354 --> 04:08:38.794
EVEN THOUGH THAT IS HIS AREA OF 
EXPERTISE, THE SENATE HAS 

04:08:39.015 --> 04:08:43.074
ADOPTED SPECIFIC ROLES AND PART 
OF THE RULES FOR THIS 

04:08:43.275 --> 04:08:45.275
IMPEACHMENT IS TO HAVE THIS TYPE
OF VOTE WHERE THEY 

04:08:50.174 --> 04:08:52.295
CAN DECIDE AFTER THEY'VE HEARD 
THESE OPENING ARGUMENTS IF THEY 

04:08:52.515 --> 04:08:55.134
WANT TO INCLUDE WITNESSES OR NOT
SO AGAIN THAT SEEMS TO BE PART 

04:08:55.354 --> 04:08:57.253
OF THE MORNING WHERE HE 
ILLUSTRATED HE MIGHT'VE BEEN 

04:08:57.254 --> 04:08:59.254
CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY JAMIE 
RASKIN'S POINT ABOUT RINGING IN 

04:09:04.215 --> 04:09:06.955
HERRERA BUTLER IT ALSO SHOWS HOW
JAMIE RASKIN IS READING THE 

04:09:07.174 --> 04:09:09.714
ROOM. OUT OF ALL THE DETAILS 
WE'VE HEARD THIS WEEK THE 

04:09:09.934 --> 04:09:11.934
AFTERMATH, YOU KNOW, 

04:09:14.674 --> 04:09:16.674
THE GLOBE ABOUT WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING HERE IN AMERICA, THE 

04:09:16.764 --> 04:09:19.275
ONE DETAIL THAT SEEMS TO HAVE 
BEEN REALLY CRUCIAL TO THIS 

04:09:24.295 --> 04:09:26.654
ENTIRE TRIAL WAS WHAT HAPPENED 
WITH MIKE PENCE. THE IMPEACHMENT

04:09:26.855 --> 04:09:30.105
MANAGERS SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON 
THAT IN THEIR ARGUMENTS THAT HE 

04:09:30.305 --> 04:09:33.235
WAS PUT IN DANGER BY HIS OWN 
PRESIDENT, HIS RUNNING MATE, 

04:09:33.435 --> 04:09:35.435
SOMEBODY HE WAS REALLY LOYAL TO 
AND THAT SEEMS 

04:09:39.954 --> 04:09:42.695
TO RALEIGH REALLY STRIKE A CHORD
AND THAT IS AT THE CORE OF WHY 

04:09:42.945 --> 04:09:47.094
WE ARE SEEING THIS WITNESS VOTE 
TURNOUT THE WAY THAT IT DID. SO 

04:09:47.314 --> 04:09:49.895
AGAIN JAMIE RASKIN BRING IN HIS 
IDEA TO BRING A WITNESS THAT CAN

04:09:50.115 --> 04:09:52.515
EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS
CALL WITH KEVIN McCARTHY. IT 

04:09:52.735 --> 04:09:56.135
JUST SHOWS YOU THAT IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGER TEAM, THEY ARE LOOKING 

04:09:56.354 --> 04:09:58.294
AT THE ROOM, THEY ARE 
CONSIDERING WHERE THE SENATORS 

04:09:58.295 --> 04:10:00.715
THAT FALL IN THE MIDDLE, WHAT 
THEY ARE CARING ABOUT AND 

04:10:00.934 --> 04:10:03.315
THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THAT IS 
GOING TO BE PART OF THEIR FIGHT 

04:10:03.534 --> 04:10:06.134
MOVING FORWARD IN THIS LAST LEG 
OF THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. 

04:10:06.135 --> 04:10:08.135
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF 

04:10:10.693 --> 04:10:12.693
THIS STATEMENT IS ULTIMATELY 
SEEN AS SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER THE

04:10:16.475 --> 04:10:18.344
SENATORS QUESTION, IT WOULD 
ALSO, THE TIME WHERE SENATOR 

04:10:18.345 --> 04:10:22.315
MIKE LEE HAS TURNED OVER HIS 
PHONE RECORDS AND INFORMATION TO

04:10:24.535 --> 04:10:28.444
THIS ROOM, SO, WE MAY END UP 
SEEING THESE SORT OF TWO PIECES 

04:10:28.965 --> 04:10:31.374
OF EVIDENCE, PAPER EVIDENCE 
ESSENTIALLY COME INTO PLAY TO 

04:10:31.605 --> 04:10:33.605
ARGUE DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

04:10:37.514 --> 04:10:39.514
MINDSET POTENTIALLY IN THESE 
CRUCIAL HOURS THAT RHONDA WAS 

04:10:39.785 --> 04:10:41.534
JUST DESCRIBING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH. AND RHONDA SAID THERE 

04:10:41.535 --> 04:10:44.554
IS DIVISION IN BOTH CHAMBERS 
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND 

04:10:44.784 --> 04:10:46.798
THERE'S ALSO DIVISION AMONG 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN 

04:10:47.219 --> 04:10:51.075
BOTH CHAMBERS. THEY WERE SAYING 
LOOK AT THE PANICKED REACTIONS 

04:10:51.585 --> 04:10:55.320
OF TRUMP'S LAWYERS TO WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AND TO THE VOTE FOR 

04:10:55.544 --> 04:10:58.004
WITNESSES AND THEIR FREAK OUT 
AND KIND OF THE DIVISIONS AMONG 

04:10:58.245 --> 04:11:00.245
THE LEGAL 

04:11:02.995 --> 04:11:08.715
TEAM AND THERE YOU HAVE HUNDRED 
WITNESSES. THERE ARE SOME THAT 

04:11:09.465 --> 04:11:13.605
ARE SAYING THEY FEEL LIKE THEY 
ARE ONTO SOMETHING AND THEY, YOU

04:11:13.935 --> 04:11:15.935
KNOW, HAVE SORT OF SENSED THIS 
FEAR OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S 

04:11:16.425 --> 04:11:19.955
DEFENSE TEAM AND SO THERE IS 
ULTIMATELY DEMOCRATS THAT ARE 

04:11:20.675 --> 04:11:25.875
GOING TO VOTE IN LINE WITH THEIR
LEADERS. I EXPECT, BUT IT IS 

04:11:26.045 --> 04:11:28.155
INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE 
CLEARLY IS SOME SENSE ON THE 

04:11:28.325 --> 04:11:31.615
DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAT THERE IS A 
LOT HERE AND THAT REPUBLICANS 

04:11:31.758 --> 04:11:35.593
ARE HYPERSENSITIVE ABOUT THE 
LACK OF RESPONSE WHILE I LOVE 

04:11:35.795 --> 04:11:39.065
THEM WERE IN DANGER. IT IS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE THE FOCUS ON

04:11:39.247 --> 04:11:41.247
THIS AT THE END HERE MEANS 

04:11:44.685 --> 04:11:48.054
THAT ULTIMATELY TRUMPS RESPONSE 
TO THE RIGHT IS GETTING MORE 

04:11:48.275 --> 04:11:50.635
ATTENTION WHICH ISN'T A GOOD OR 
BAD THING BUT ALL THE COMMENTS 

04:11:50.855 --> 04:11:53.236
LEADING UP TO THE BREACH OF THE 
CAPITAL WHICH WAS A HUGE 

04:11:53.455 --> 04:11:57.154
EMPHASIS FOR, YOU KNOW, FOR THE 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS BUT 

04:11:57.371 --> 04:12:01.515
INSTEAD WE ARE LOOKING AT THE 
REACTION IN THE PIVOTAL MINUTES 

04:12:01.735 --> 04:12:03.735
AFTER THE CAPITAL HAD BEEN 
BREACHED 

04:12:06.675 --> 04:12:09.035
AND PERHAPS THE FOCUS IS THERE 
BECAUSE THAT IS AS YOU JUST 

04:12:09.255 --> 04:12:11.255
NOTED, SUCH AN IMPORTANT AREA OF
CONCERN FOR THE SWING 

04:12:11.395 --> 04:12:14.014
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE ULTIMATELY 
THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO 

04:12:14.234 --> 04:12:16.305
DECIDE EVEN IF TRUMP DOESN'T GET
DISQUALIFIED FROM HOLDING OFFICE

04:12:16.815 --> 04:12:18.815
IN 

04:12:21.415 --> 04:12:24.214
THE FUTURE, THE MOST BIPARTISAN 
IMPEACHMENT VOTE IN AMERICAN 

04:12:24.365 --> 04:12:25.807
HISTORY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AS WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

04:12:25.808 --> 04:12:27.808
EARLIER THIS MORNING, JAMES, 
TRUMP'S LAWYER ARGUED THAT THAT 

04:12:27.920 --> 04:12:29.644
IS IRRELEVANT. THAT THAT 
TIMELINE AND WHAT PRESIDENT 

04:12:29.645 --> 04:12:32.575
TRUMP DID AFTER THE ATTACK 
STARTED AND FROM THAT TIME ON, 

04:12:32.885 --> 04:12:37.797
THAT IT IS IRRELEVANT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THAT IS ONE OF THE 

04:12:37.995 --> 04:12:40.588
REASONS THAT IF THERE IS A DEAL 
THAT IS COMING TOGETHER RIGHT 

04:12:40.835 --> 04:12:43.200
NOW AND I THINK THAT THERE IS 
PUSHBACK TO THE DEAL AND THERE 

04:12:43.505 --> 04:12:47.753
IS A DESIRE TO GET THE DEAL DONE
AND IF THERE IS A DEAL, THE 

04:12:47.955 --> 04:12:50.355
DEFENSE LAWYERS ARE STIPULATING 
THAT ALL OF THE THIS TERRIBLE 

04:12:50.574 --> 04:12:55.735
STUFF THAT IS ALLEGED THAT THAT 
HAPPENED AND THEY CAN BE 

04:12:55.954 --> 04:12:57.954
COMFORTABLE STIPULATING 

04:12:59.325 --> 04:13:01.325
THAT BECAUSE THEIR CLAIM IS THAT
IT 

04:13:05.155 --> 04:13:07.895
IS IRRELEVANT SO I DO THINK IF 
WE WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE 

04:13:08.095 --> 04:13:10.244
WERE GOING TO HEAR THE CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES THIS 

04:13:10.444 --> 04:13:12.555
AFTERNOON YOU WOULD HEAR MICHAEL
VAN DER VEENS EMPHASIZE THAT.  

04:13:12.775 --> 04:13:15.815
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE 
THE CHARGE 

04:13:19.494 --> 04:13:21.795
IS THAT TRUMP INCITED THAT GROUP
TO BREACH THE CAPITAL SO IT 

04:13:22.015 --> 04:13:25.695
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DID 
ONCE THE CAPITAL WAS BREACHED 

04:13:25.915 --> 04:13:27.915
JUST BASED ON LOOKING AT 

04:13:31.815 --> 04:13:36.868
THE TEXT OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS CLEARLY THINK IT 

04:13:37.075 --> 04:13:39.075
MATTERS A GREAT DEAL INCLUDING 
MARKOWSKI AND COLLINS AND ROMNEY

04:13:39.235 --> 04:13:41.795
WHO BELIEVED THAT IT DOES SPEAK 
TO WHAT HIS STATE OF MIND WAS 

04:13:42.014 --> 04:13:44.355
AND WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS HAPPY 
THAT THERE WAS THIS ATTEMPTED 

04:13:44.575 --> 04:13:45.672
INSURRECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND ALSO POTENTIALLY 

04:13:45.673 --> 04:13:47.985
ENDANGERING A LIFE NOT ONLY ON 
ALL THE INDIVIDUALS SOME OF WHOM

04:13:48.187 --> 04:13:50.535
ARE IN THIS CHAMBER NOW MANY OF 
WHOM ARE 

04:13:55.294 --> 04:13:57.014
NOT JANITORS, CAPITAL POLICE, 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, 

04:13:57.015 --> 04:13:59.015
JOURNALIST, BUT ALSO THE LIFE OF

04:14:01.895 --> 04:14:04.625
MIKE PENCE WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO SORT OF PAINT HIM AS A

04:14:04.845 --> 04:14:08.436
PATRIOT AND SOMEONE WHO YOU CAN 
EITHER SIDE WITH HIM OR YOU CAN 

04:14:08.655 --> 04:14:11.455
SIDE WITH DONALD TRUMP, THAT IS 
THE ARGUMENT THEY ARE TRYING TO 

04:14:11.675 --> 04:14:14.024
GET IN THE HEADS OF THOSE 
SENATORS. WE ARE STILL WATCHING 

04:14:14.345 --> 04:14:16.485
AND WAITING FOR THE SENATE TO 
KICK BACK AND HEAR. WHY WOULD 

04:14:16.655 --> 04:14:19.455
DEMOCRATS POTENTIALLY AGREE TO 
ALLOWING THE STATEMENT OF 

04:14:19.675 --> 04:14:24.821
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BUTLER, 
WHAT DO THEY GAIN BY MOVING FROM

04:14:25.035 --> 04:14:27.035
THE PROCESS 

04:14:28.995 --> 04:14:30.995
MORE 

04:14:32.955 --> 04:14:34.933
QUICKLY? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WHY

04:14:34.934 --> 04:14:36.934
THIS WOULD BE SUMMED UP TODAY 
AND 

04:14:41.035 --> 04:14:43.781
KIND OF PUT A PERIOD TO TODAY, 
SO THAT THEY COULD GO AND HANDLE

04:14:43.981 --> 04:14:47.535
HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AND 
THE REST OF HIS CABINET, ALSO 

04:14:47.755 --> 04:14:49.755
VOTE ON THE NEXT CORONAVIRUS AID
BILL, SO, 

04:14:54.134 --> 04:14:56.134
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, AND 
EXPEDITIOUS TRIAL FOR THEM MEANS

04:14:56.167 --> 04:14:57.964
THAT THEY CAN GET BACK TO 
HELPING ESTABLISH THE NEW 

04:14:57.965 --> 04:14:59.965
PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT OF 

04:15:03.595 --> 04:15:06.522
THEIR PARTY SO THAT WAS REALLY A
MOTIVATION OF SOME OF THE 

04:15:06.724 --> 04:15:09.236
DEMOCRATS WHO WANTED TO MOVE ON 
IN FACT ONE OF THE BIG 

04:15:09.455 --> 04:15:11.985
CONFIRMATION HERE UPCOMING AND 
AS THEY JUST SENT BY THE 

04:15:13.605 --> 04:15:16.906
JUDICIARY CHAIR ON FEBRUARY 
22nd, THEY WILL START THE 

04:15:17.205 --> 04:15:19.134
CONFIRMATION HEARING PROCESS OF 
MAYOR GARLAND WHO IS SET TO BE 

04:15:19.135 --> 04:15:21.135
THE NEW 

04:15:23.675 --> 04:15:26.605
ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO THEY 
ALREADY PUT THAT ON THE CALENDAR

04:15:26.895 --> 04:15:30.465
WHILE THEY WERE GOING THROUGH 
THIS WEEK'S TRIAL AND I THINK 

04:15:30.675 --> 04:15:32.734
THAT WAS A SINGLE THAT THEY ARE 
FORWARD THINKING RIGHT NOW. 

04:15:32.735 --> 04:15:35.153
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT, WE ARE JUST 
WAITING TO SEE AS THIS GET 

04:15:35.355 --> 04:15:37.355
STARTED. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART 
IS THAT ONCE YOU START OPENING 

04:15:37.465 --> 04:15:40.408
THE BOX OF WITNESSES NOW WHILE 
IT IS NOT UP TO TRUMP'S TEAM 

04:15:44.015 --> 04:15:46.595
TO DECIDE THAT IT IS NOT GOING 
TO BE A FREE-FOR-ALL BY ANY 

04:15:46.815 --> 04:15:50.935
MEANS BUT IT DOES SORT OF BRING 
FORTH THE POLITICAL 

04:15:51.218 --> 04:15:55.035
GRANDSTANDING THAT THE ATTEMPT 
AT BRINGING WITNESSES WOULD HAVE

04:15:55.255 --> 04:15:58.470
BECAUSE TRUMPS SIDE OF THE AISLE
COULD SAY I CALLED NANCY PELOSI 

04:15:58.674 --> 04:16:00.674
AND THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

04:16:04.775 --> 04:16:06.744
THAT PROCESS WHICH GIVES 
REPUBLICANS SOME FODDER AND ALSO

04:16:06.745 --> 04:16:08.745
DISTRACTS FROM THE POINT OF THIS
ACTUAL 

04:16:11.455 --> 04:16:12.994
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EXACTLY. AND DEMOCRATS FEEL 

04:16:12.995 --> 04:16:14.995
LIKE MOST PEOPLE ACCEPT THE 
FACTS OF THE CASE. EVEN 

04:16:17.955 --> 04:16:19.955
MOST AMERICANS EVEN THOUGH ONLY 
LIKE 60% OF AMERICANS THINK 

04:16:20.135 --> 04:16:24.246
TRUMP SHOULD BE BARRED FROM 
HOLDING OFFICE WHICH IS A 

04:16:24.448 --> 04:16:26.105
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER, A FAR 
GREATER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE 

04:16:26.106 --> 04:16:28.523
BELIEVE HE DESERVES SOME OF THE 
BLAME FOR PROVOKING THIS OR FOR 

04:16:32.384 --> 04:16:35.035
INCITING IT. SO, THEY SORT OF 
FEEL LIKE THEY'VE PROVEN THE 

04:16:35.435 --> 04:16:39.805
CASE AND THE QUESTION IS IF YOU 
DO LOOK AT THE FIRST HUNDRED 

04:16:40.385 --> 04:16:42.585
DAYS, REMEMBER THE FIRST HUNDRED
DAYS IS ALWAYS BEEN A PRESIDENT 

04:16:42.725 --> 04:16:45.963
USUALLY ACHIEVES HIS MOST 
CONSEQUENTIAL LEGISLATIVE 

04:16:46.165 --> 04:16:48.044
ACHIEVEMENTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
SOME MOMENTUM, YOU HAVE A 

04:16:48.045 --> 04:16:50.045
HONEYMOON PERIOD 

04:16:53.255 --> 04:16:58.399
HISTORICALLY THAT THE FIRST 
MOVES OF BIDEN WOULD ULTIMATELY 

04:16:58.806 --> 04:17:00.955
HURT THEM AND THEY DON'T WANT TO
LOOK DISTRACTED BY GETTING 

04:17:01.504 --> 04:17:05.924
POLITICAL VENGEANCE AND IN WORDS
OF THE HOUSE OR THE TRUMP 

04:17:06.115 --> 04:17:08.935
DEFENSE LAWYERS, SO, THERE ARE A
LOT OF VERY VALID CONSIDERATIONS

04:17:09.259 --> 04:17:13.175
EVEN IF YOU HAD KIND OF A 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO WAS 

04:17:13.395 --> 04:17:15.395
TRYING TO GET ATTENTION BY 
SAYING LET'S CALL HUNTER BIDEN 

04:17:15.608 --> 04:17:17.955
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW CYCLE
THAT IS DIVIDED INSTEAD OF 

04:17:19.015 --> 04:17:21.015
TALKING ABOUT 

04:17:24.235 --> 04:17:26.235
COVID RELIEF.

04:17:35.675 --> 04:17:42.495
ONCE YOU SORT OF OPEN THE DOOR, 
UNPREDICTABLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN 

04:17:42.715 --> 04:17:45.995
AND UNPREDICTABLE THINGS CAN 
PLAY OUT IN WAYS THAT ARE GOOD 

04:17:46.215 --> 04:17:48.215
OR BAD 

04:17:51.454 --> 04:17:55.075
FOR DEMOCRATS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY BE 

04:17:55.295 --> 04:17:57.239
GETTING SETTLED HERE. WE HAVE 
CONFIRMATION FROM OUR REPORTING 

04:17:57.240 --> 04:18:01.735
TEAM THAT THE DECISION BY HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER JAMIE RASKIN

04:18:01.935 --> 04:18:04.382
TO SAY HE WANTS TO CALL A 
WITNESS WAS A SURPRISE TO SENATE

04:18:04.582 --> 04:18:06.582
DEMOCRATS WHO 

04:18:09.795 --> 04:18:13.635
WERE BLINDSIDED. BEN CARDIN, THE
SENDER SAYING, YUP, THAT'S WHAT 

04:18:13.855 --> 04:18:15.855
HAPPENED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW 
THAT THESE HOUSE 

04:18:20.515 --> 04:18:22.406
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS WOULD BE 
CALLING FOR WITNESSES. LET'S GO 

04:18:22.407 --> 04:18:24.407
NOW LIVE TO THE SENATE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATE WILL BE 

04:18:29.315 --> 04:18:31.315
IN ORDER.

04:18:44.915 --> 04:18:46.915
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU 

04:18:48.615 --> 04:18:50.615
ARE RECOGNIZED. 

04:18:53.855 --> 04:18:55.901
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD JOHN TRUMP BY HIS 

04:18:56.105 --> 04:18:58.105
COUNSEL IS PREPARED TO STIPULATE
THAT 

04:19:02.166 --> 04:19:03.844
IF REPRESENTATIVE HERRERA, 
BUTLER, WERE TO TESTIFY UNDER 

04:19:03.845 --> 04:19:07.165
OATH AS PART OF THESE 
PROCEEDINGS, THE TESTIMONY WOULD

04:19:07.385 --> 04:19:11.380
BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATEMENT
SHE ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 12th 2021

04:19:11.581 --> 04:19:13.842
AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S 
COUNSEL IS AGREEABLE TO 

04:19:16.885 --> 04:19:21.605
THE ADMISSION OF THAT PUBLIC 
STATEMENT INTO EVIDENCE AT THIS 

04:19:21.825 --> 04:19:23.825
TIME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU 

04:19:25.825 --> 04:19:30.035
MR. CASTOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. THE 

04:19:30.245 --> 04:19:32.615
MANAGERS ARE PREPARED TO ENTER 
INTO THE AGREEMENT. I WILL NOW 

04:19:32.885 --> 04:19:40.275
READ THE STATEMENT. THIS IS THE 
STATEMENT CONGRESSWOMAN FEBRUARY

04:19:40.647 --> 04:19:42.647
1221. IN MY JANUARY 

04:19:44.895 --> 04:19:46.895
12 STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT I 

04:19:47.065 --> 04:19:49.515
REFERENCED A CONVERSATION HOUSE 
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY 

04:19:49.735 --> 04:19:52.315
RELAYED TO ME THAT HE HAD HAD 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHILE THE 

04:19:52.500 --> 04:19:54.500
JANUARY 6th ATTACK WAS ONGOING. 
HERE ARE 

04:19:58.979 --> 04:20:01.163
THE DETAILS. WHEN McCARTHY 
FINALLY REACHED THE PRESIDENT ON

04:20:01.417 --> 04:20:03.635
JANUARY SIXTH AND ASKED HIM TO 
PUBLICLY AND FORCEFULLY CALL OFF

04:20:03.839 --> 04:20:05.839
THE RIOT, THE PRESIDENT 
INITIALLY REPEATED 

04:20:07.875 --> 04:20:10.895
THE FALSEHOOD THAT IT WAS AND HE
THOUGHT THAT HAD BREACHED THE 

04:20:11.115 --> 04:20:15.505
CAPITAL. CARTHY REFUTED THAT AND
TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT THESE 

04:20:15.725 --> 04:20:17.725
WERE TRUMP SUPPORTERS. THAT IS 
WHEN ACCORDING TO McCARTHY, THE 

04:20:21.227 --> 04:20:23.227
PRESIDENT SAID, WELL, KEVIN, I 
GUESS THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE 

04:20:23.326 --> 04:20:25.326
UPSET ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN 

04:20:29.166 --> 04:20:32.155
YOU ARE. SINCE I PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCED MY DECISION TO VOTE 

04:20:32.375 --> 04:20:34.244
FOR IMPEACHMENT I HAVE SHARED 
THESE DETAILS AND COUNTLESS 

04:20:34.245 --> 04:20:37.187
CONVERSATIONS WITH CONSTITUENTS 
AND COLLEAGUES AND MULTIPLE 

04:20:37.386 --> 04:20:39.386
TIMES THROUGH THE MEDIA AND 
OTHER 

04:20:42.365 --> 04:20:47.525
PUBLIC FORUMS. I TOLD IT TO THE 
DAILY NEWS OF LONGVIEW ON 

04:20:48.025 --> 04:20:54.796
JANUARY 17th, I'VE SHARED IT 
WITH LOCAL COUNTY REPUBLICAN 

04:20:55.335 --> 04:21:01.742
EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL 
AS OTHER CONSTITUENTS WHO ASKED 

04:21:02.555 --> 04:21:09.806
ME TO EXPLAIN MY VOTE. I SHARED 

04:21:12.629 --> 04:21:19.548
OF RESIDENTS ON MY TELEPHONE 
TOWN HALL 

04:21:23.335 --> 04:21:25.796
EIGHTH. MR. PRESIDENT, I NOW 
MOVE THAT THE SENATE ADMIT THE 

04:21:25.945 --> 04:21:27.074
STATEMENT INTO EVIDENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITHOUT OBJECTION THE 

04:21:27.075 --> 04:21:28.516
STATEMENT WILL BE ADMITTED INTO 
EVIDENCE AND DOES EITHER PARTY 

04:21:28.517 --> 04:21:29.954
WISH TO MAKE ANY FURTHER MOTIONS
RELATED TO WITNESSES OR 

04:21:29.955 --> 04:21:31.264
DOCUMENTS AT THIS TIME? MR. 
PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT'S 

04:21:31.265 --> 04:21:33.008
COUNSEL HAVE NO FURTHER MOTIONS.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND MR. PRESIDENT WE HAVE NO 

04:21:33.009 --> 04:21:35.009
FURTHER MOTIONS 

04:21:37.235 --> 04:21:38.934
EITHER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE CHAIR WOULD KNOW THAT

04:21:38.935 --> 04:21:41.215
NEITHER PARTY WISHES TO MAKE 
FURTHER MOTIONS UNDER SECTION 6 

04:21:41.435 --> 04:21:43.435
OF SENATE 

04:21:46.675 --> 04:21:48.675
RESOLUTION 47.

04:22:04.980 --> 04:22:07.267
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M ADVISED THAT THE HOUSE 

04:22:07.467 --> 04:22:09.467
MANAGERS HAVE NO OBJECTION TO 
THE ADMISSION 

04:22:11.841 --> 04:22:13.764
OF EVIDENCE PROPOSED TO BE 
ADMITTED BY THE FORMER 

04:22:13.765 --> 04:22:15.604
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL UNDER THE

INTO EVIDENCE BY THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS. PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 

04:22:27.485 --> 04:22:29.805
OF THE RESOLUTION AS AGREED TO 
BY LEADER McCALL AND MYSELF A 

04:22:30.020 --> 04:22:32.020
FEW DAYS AGO, BOTH PARTIES HAVE 
MADE TIMELY FILINGS OF 

04:22:35.835 --> 04:22:37.835
THIS EVIDENCE WITH THE SECRETARY
OF THE STENNETT AND HAVE 

04:22:37.998 --> 04:22:39.998
PROVIDED COPIES TO EACH OTHER. I
THEREFORE ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT 

04:22:40.106 --> 04:22:42.106
THAT THEY DISPENSE 47 AND THAT 

04:22:46.175 --> 04:22:48.075

04:23:00.020 --> 04:23:02.300
THAT EACH SENATOR SHALL DECIDE 
FOR HIM OR HERSELF THE WEIGHT TO

04:23:06.447 --> 04:23:08.509
BE GIVEN SUCH EVIDENCE. THIS 
REQUEST HAS THE APPROVAL OF BOTH

04:23:08.722 --> 04:23:11.015
PARTIES ON THE REPUBLICAN 
LEADER. 

04:23:11.016 --> 04:23:13.016
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITHOUT OBJECTION IS 

04:23:16.696 --> 04:23:18.696
SO ORDERED.

04:23:39.045 --> 04:23:41.045
IT WILL BE EQUALLY DIVIDED 
BETWEEN THE MANAGERS AND THE 

04:23:41.129 --> 04:23:42.799
PART OF THE HOUSE 
REPRESENTATIVES AND THE COUNSEL 

04:23:42.800 --> 04:23:44.800
FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT 

04:23:46.585 --> 04:23:49.775
IN PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF 
PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE IN THE

SENATE WHEN SITTING ON 
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS THE ARGUMENT 

04:23:52.784 --> 04:23:56.387
SHALL BE OPEN AND CLOSED ON THE 
PART OF THE 

04:23:59.535 --> 04:24:01.535
HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES. SO, THE 

04:24:03.863 --> 04:24:06.834
CHAIR RECOGNIZES MR. RASKIN TO 
BEGIN THE PRESENTATION ON THE 

04:24:07.034 --> 04:24:09.776
PART OF THE HOUSE 
REPRESENTATIVES. MR. RASKIN, 

04:24:09.916 --> 04:24:13.771
UNDER RULE 22 YOU MAY RESERVE 
TIME IF 

04:24:18.780 --> 04:24:20.394
YOU WISH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 

04:24:20.395 --> 04:24:25.111
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, BEFORE I 
PROCEED IT WAS SUGGESTED BY 

04:24:25.311 --> 04:24:29.100
DEFENSE COUNSEL THAT DONALD 
TRUMP'S CONDUCT DURING 

04:24:33.048 --> 04:24:34.767
THE ATTACK AS DESCRIBED IN 
CONGRESSWOMAN BUTLER'S STATEMENT

04:24:34.768 --> 04:24:38.728
IS SOMEHOW NOT PART OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFENSE FOR WHICH

04:24:38.932 --> 04:24:40.932
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

04:24:42.942 --> 04:24:47.596
BEEN CHARGED I WANT TO REJECT 
THAT FALSEHOOD AND THAT POLICY 

04:24:47.795 --> 04:24:50.627
IMMEDIATELY. AFTER HE KNEW THAT 
VIOLENCE WAS UNDERWAY AT THE 

04:24:51.015 --> 04:24:54.297
CAPITAL, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK 
ACTIONS THAT FURTHER INCITED THE

04:24:54.516 --> 04:24:59.640
INSURGENTS TO BE MORE INFLAMED 
AND TO TAKE EVEN MORE SELECTIVE 

04:24:59.861 --> 04:25:02.254
AND FOCUSED ACTION AGAINST 

04:25:07.254 --> 04:25:09.254
MIKE PENCE.

04:25:45.879 --> 04:25:50.075
THE PRESIDENT SAID WELL, KEVIN, 
I GUESS THESE PEOPLE, MEANING 

04:25:50.275 --> 04:25:52.275
THE MOBSTERS, THE 
INSURRECTIONIST ARE MORE UPSET 

04:25:52.374 --> 04:25:54.374
ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN 

04:25:58.002 --> 04:26:00.002
YOU ARE.

04:26:16.625 --> 04:26:18.498
HE NOT ONLY PERPETUATED THE 
CONTINUING OFFENSE BUT ALSO 

04:26:18.499 --> 04:26:23.677
PROVIDES TO US HERE TODAY, 
FURTHER DECISIVE EVIDENCE TO HIS

04:26:23.897 --> 04:26:26.181
INTENT TO INCITE THE 
INSURRECTION IN THE 

04:26:31.176 --> 04:26:33.176
FIRST PLACE

04:26:35.314 --> 04:26:39.057
IT OF COURSE REFLECTS THAT THEY 
HAVE 

04:26:42.413 --> 04:26:44.077
NO DEFENSE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS 
SCANDALOUS AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

04:26:44.078 --> 04:26:48.273
CONDUCT IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
VIOLENT ASSAULT ON THE CAPITAL 

04:26:48.474 --> 04:26:51.627
THAT HE INCITED. SENATORS, THINK
ABOUT IT FOR 

04:26:54.737 --> 04:26:56.812
A SECOND. SAY YOU LIGHT A FIRE 
AND YOU ARE CHARGED 

04:27:00.340 --> 04:27:02.583
WITH ARSON. THE DEFENSE COUNSEL 
SAYS EVERYTHING THAT I DID AFTER

04:27:02.728 --> 04:27:06.124
THE FIRE STARTED IS IRRELEVANT 
AND THE COURT WOULD REJECT THAT 

04:27:06.344 --> 04:27:08.638
IMMEDIATELY AND SAY THAT IS NOT 
TRUE AT ALL. IT IS EXTREMELY 

04:27:08.838 --> 04:27:10.838
RELEVANT TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU 
COMMITTED 

04:27:15.100 --> 04:27:18.279
THE CRIME. IF YOU RUN OVER AND 
TRY TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES IF YOU

04:27:18.539 --> 04:27:21.930
GET LOTS OF WATER AND SAY HELP, 
HELP, THERE'S A FIRE, YOU CALL 

04:27:22.173 --> 04:27:26.380
FOR HELP, A COURT WILL INFER, 
THEY COULD INFER THAT YOU DIDN'T

04:27:26.615 --> 04:27:29.440
INTEND FOR THE FIRE TO BE LIT IN
THE FIRST PLACE. THEY WOULD 

04:27:29.714 --> 04:27:33.176
ACCEPT YOUR DEFENSE, PERHAPS, 
THAT IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT. 

04:27:33.436 --> 04:27:36.536
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN WITH FIRE. BUT 
ON THE OTHER HAND WITH A FIRE 

04:27:36.696 --> 04:27:39.281
ERUPTS, YOU GO AND YOU POUR MORE
FUEL ON IT. STANDBY AND YOU 

04:27:40.395 --> 04:27:42.395
WATCH 

04:27:45.401 --> 04:27:53.946
IT, GLEEFULLY. ANY REASONABLE 
PERSON WILL INFER THAT YOU NOT 

04:27:54.647 --> 04:27:58.662
ONLY INTENDED THE FIRE TO START 
BUT THAT ONCE IT GOT STARTED AND

04:27:58.991 --> 04:28:03.112
BEGAN TO SPREAD, YOU INTENDED TO
CONTINUE TO KEEP THE FIRE GOING.

04:28:03.737 --> 04:28:09.092
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE WE 
ARE, MY FRIENDS. OF COURSE YOUR 

04:28:09.518 --> 04:28:15.450
CONDUCT WHILE A CRIME IS ONGOING
IS RELEVANT TO YOUR 

04:28:17.009 --> 04:28:21.266
BOTH TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE 
OFFENSE, BUT ALSO DIRECTLY 

04:28:21.436 --> 04:28:23.436
RELEVANT, DIRECTLY ELIMINATING 
TO WHAT YOUR PURPOSE WAS 

04:28:23.929 --> 04:28:30.500
ORIGINALLY. WHAT WAS YOUR 
INTENT? IN ANY COURT IN THE LAND

04:28:30.670 --> 04:28:33.132
WOULD LAUGH OUT OF COURT, ANY 
CRIMINAL DEFENDANT WHO SAID WHAT

04:28:33.331 --> 04:28:35.856
I DID AFTER I ALLEGEDLY KILLED 
THAT PERSON IS IRRELEVANT TO 

04:28:36.113 --> 04:28:40.252
WHETHER OR NOT I INTENDED TO 
KILL THEM. I MEAN, COME ON. 

04:28:40.511 --> 04:28:44.276
DONALD TRUMP'S REFUSAL NOT ONLY 
TO SEND HELP BUT ALSO TO 

04:28:44.425 --> 04:28:47.590
CONTINUE TO FURTHER FIGHT THE 
INSURGENTS AGAINST HIS OWN VICE 

04:28:47.999 --> 04:28:51.598
PRESIDENT, HIS OWN VICE 
PRESIDENT, PROVIDES FURTHER 

04:28:51.897 --> 04:28:54.279
DECISIVE EVIDENCE OF BOTH HIS 
INTENT TO START THIS VIOLENT 

04:28:54.578 --> 04:28:56.991
INSURRECTION AND HIS CONTINUED 
INCITEMENT ONCE THE ATTACK HAD 

04:28:57.390 --> 04:28:59.390
BEGUN TO OVERRIDE 

04:29:02.517 --> 04:29:08.258
THE CAPITAL. ALL RIGHT SENATORS,
THAT WAS IN 

04:29:11.378 --> 04:29:15.771
RESPONSE TO THIS NEW EVIDENTIARY
PARTICLE THAT CAME IN. BUT IN MY

04:29:16.338 --> 04:29:19.371
CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR REMARKABLE ATTENTION AND 

04:29:19.561 --> 04:29:22.777
YOUR SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE 
BEFITTING YOUR OFFICE. WE HAVE 

04:29:23.336 --> 04:29:27.926
OFFERED YOU OVERWHELMING AND 
IRREFUTABLE AND CERTAINLY 

04:29:28.188 --> 04:29:33.649
UNREFUTED EVIDENCE THAT FORMER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP INCITED THIS 

04:29:33.786 --> 04:29:36.069
INSURRECTION AGAINST US. TO 
QUOTE THE STATEMENT 

04:29:36.938 --> 04:29:38.938
REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY MADE 
IN JANUARY, QUOTE, ON JANUARY 

04:29:39.077 --> 04:29:42.095
SIX, 2021, A VIOLENT MOB 
ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES 

04:29:42.758 --> 04:29:47.198
CAPITAL TO OBSTRUCT THE PROCESS 
OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND STOP THE 

04:29:47.408 --> 04:29:48.977
COUNTING OF PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTORAL VOTES. THIS 

04:29:48.978 --> 04:29:52.147
INSURRECTION CAUSED INJURY, 
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IN THE 

04:29:52.336 --> 04:29:55.256
MOST SACRED SPACE IN OUR PUBLIC.
SHE CONTINUED. REPRESENTATIVE 

04:29:55.489 --> 04:29:57.489
CHENEY CONTINUED, MUCH MORE WILL

04:30:01.017 --> 04:30:03.017
BECOME CLEAR

04:30:06.025 --> 04:30:08.591
IN COMING DAYS AND WEEKS. BUT 
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS ENOUGH. THE 

04:30:08.738 --> 04:30:11.419
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
SUMMONED THIS MOB, ASSEMBLED 

04:30:11.768 --> 04:30:15.186
THIS MOB AND LIT THE FLAME OF 
THIS ATTACK. EVERYTHING THAT 

04:30:15.568 --> 04:30:19.108
FOLLOWED WAS HIS DOING. NONE OF 
THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT

04:30:19.480 --> 04:30:21.480
THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT 
COULD'VE IMMEDIATELY AND 

04:30:21.560 --> 04:30:24.698
FORCEFULLY INTERVENED TO STOP 
THE VIOLENCE. HE DID NOT. THERE 

04:30:25.018 --> 04:30:28.418
HAS NEVER BEEN A GREATER 
BETRAYAL BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE

04:30:28.568 --> 04:30:32.747
UNITED STATES OF THE OFFICE AND 
HIS OATH TO THE CONSTITUTION. I 

04:30:33.164 --> 04:30:38.708
WILL VOTE TO IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT. REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY

04:30:39.417 --> 04:30:45.144
WAS RIGHT. SHE BASED HER VOTE ON
THE FACTS, ON THE EVIDENCE AND 

04:30:45.330 --> 04:30:48.686
ON THE CONSTITUTION. AND 
EVIDENCE, THE VIDEO, 

04:30:51.208 --> 04:30:53.790
DOCUMENTARY, EYEWITNESSES, ONLY 
GROWN STRONGER AND STRONGER AND 

04:30:54.010 --> 04:30:56.428
MORE DETAILED WRITE UP TO TODAY,
RIGHT UP TO 10 MINUTES AGO. OVER

04:30:56.617 --> 04:31:05.740
THE COURSE OF THE SENATE TRIAL. 
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU ALL

04:31:05.940 --> 04:31:07.940
NOTICED THAT DESPITE THE VARIOUS
PROPAGANDA REELS AND SO ON, 

04:31:08.067 --> 04:31:11.914
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS HAVE 
SAID ALMOST NOTHING TO CONTEST 

04:31:12.418 --> 04:31:14.522
OR OVERCOME THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE 
OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

04:31:14.678 --> 04:31:17.467
CONDUCT THAT WE HAVE PRESENTED 
MUCH LESS HAVE THEY BROUGHT 

04:31:17.838 --> 04:31:24.978
THEIR CLIENT FORWARD TO TELL US 
HIS SIDE OF THE STORY. WE SENT 

04:31:25.378 --> 04:31:28.461
THEM A LETTER LAST WEEK, WHICH 
THEY REJECTED. THE FORMER 

04:31:28.718 --> 04:31:30.718
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

04:31:33.799 --> 04:31:39.753
STATES REFUSED TO COME AND TELL 
US. AND I ASK ANY OF YOU, IF YOU

04:31:39.998 --> 04:31:42.738
WERE CHARGED WITH INCITING 
VIOLENT INSURRECTION AGAINST OUR

04:31:42.958 --> 04:31:47.352
COUNTRY AND YOU WERE FALSELY 
ACCUSED, WOULD YOU COME AND 

04:31:47.561 --> 04:31:51.196
TESTIFY? I KNOW I WOULD. I WOULD
BE THERE AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING 

04:31:51.647 --> 04:31:57.208
WAITING FOR THE DOORS TO OPEN. 
I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE OF 100 

04:31:57.468 --> 04:32:00.858
SENATORS IN THIS ROOM AND I HOPE
IT IS TRUE OF 100 SENATORS IN 

04:32:01.092 --> 04:32:03.690
THIS ROOM. SENATE WAS LECTURED 
SEVERAL TIMES YESTERDAY ABOUT 

04:32:03.967 --> 04:32:05.967
CANCEL CULTURE. THOUGH NOT EVEN 
TWO 

04:32:09.898 --> 04:32:14.548
WEEKS AGO, THE PRESIDENT'S MOST 
RELIABLE SUPPORTERS IN THE 

04:32:15.431 --> 04:32:18.658
HOUSE, I'M SORRY, NOT THE 
PRESIDENT, THE FORMER 

04:32:18.798 --> 04:32:20.798
PRESIDENT'S MOST RELIABLE 
SUPPORTERS IN THE HOUSE TRIED TO

04:32:21.008 --> 04:32:23.349
CANCEL OUT REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY
BECAUSE OF HER COURAGEOUS AND 

04:32:23.502 --> 04:32:26.418
PATRIOTIC DEFENSE OF THE 
REPUBLIC AND THE TRUTH AND THE 

04:32:27.008 --> 04:32:30.178
CONSTITUTION, THEY TRIED TO 
STRIP HER OF HER LEADING ROLE AS

04:32:30.498 --> 04:32:34.998
CHAIR OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN 
CONFERENCE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I

04:32:35.468 --> 04:32:37.468
HOPE EVERYBODY TAKES A SECOND 
REFLECT ON THIS. THE CONFIDENCE 

04:32:37.509 --> 04:32:39.891
REJECTED THIS PLAINLY 
RETALIATORY AND COWARDLY ATTEMPT

04:32:40.138 --> 04:32:43.233
TO PUNISH HER FOR TELLING THE 
TRUTH TO HER CONSTITUENTS AND 

04:32:44.478 --> 04:32:46.478
HER COUNTRY AND VOTING 

04:32:49.064 --> 04:32:52.519
FOR IMPEACHMENT. WHO SAYS YOU 
CAN'T STAND UP AGAINST BULLIES? 

04:32:53.005 --> 04:33:00.238
WHO SAYS? IN MY MIND, LIZ CHENEY
IS A HERO FOR STANDING UP FOR 

04:33:00.458 --> 04:33:07.308
THE TRUTH. AND RESISTING THIS 
RETALIATORY CANCEL CULTURE. BUT 

04:33:07.667 --> 04:33:13.777
SHE BEAT THEM ON A VOTE OF 145 
-61, MORE THAN 2-1 VOTE. YOU 

04:33:13.947 --> 04:33:15.947
KNOW, BEN FRANKLIN, A GREAT 

04:33:18.848 --> 04:33:21.260
CHAMPION IN INDICTMENT AND AN 
ENEMY OF POLITICAL FANATICISM 

04:33:21.434 --> 04:33:23.570
AND COWARDICE AND OF COURSE 
ANOTHER GREAT PHILADELPHIAN ONCE

04:33:24.678 --> 04:33:31.667
WROTE THIS. I HAVE OBSERVED THAT
WRONG IS ALWAYS GROWING MORE 

04:33:32.118 --> 04:33:36.096
WRONG UNTIL THERE IS NO BEARING 
IT ANYMORE. AND THAT RIGHT, 

04:33:38.398 --> 04:33:43.382
HOWEVER OPPOSED, COMES RIGHT AT 
LAST. COMES RIGHT AT LAST. THINK

04:33:46.548 --> 04:33:53.478
ABOUT THAT. THIS IS AMERICA. 
HOME OF THE BRAVE, LAND OF THE 

04:33:53.708 --> 04:33:55.708
FREE. THE AMERICA OF BEN 
FRANKLIN 

04:33:58.318 --> 04:34:02.937
WHO SAID YOU MAKE YOURSELF A 
SHEEP, THE WOLVES WILL EACH YOU.

04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:06.779
DON'T MAKE YOURSELF A SHEEP. THE
WOLVES WILL EACH YOU. THE 

04:34:07.128 --> 04:34:11.450
AMERICA OF THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO 
SAID IN ANOTHER DIFFICULT 

04:34:11.837 --> 04:34:15.531
MOMENT, A LITTLE PATIENCE AND WE
SHALL SEE THE REIGN OF WHICH IS 

04:34:15.768 --> 04:34:19.657
PASSOVER THEIR SPIRITS DISSOLVE 
AND THE PEOPLE RECOVERING THEIR 

04:34:19.941 --> 04:34:22.538
TRUE SIGHT RESTORE THEIR 
GOVERNMENT TO ITS 

04:34:27.140 --> 04:34:32.378
TRUE PRINCIPLES. THE MIND, ONCE 
ENLIGHTENED, CANNOT AGAIN 

04:34:37.219 --> 04:34:39.725
BECOME DARK. NOW, WE SHOWED YOU 
HOUR AFTER HOUR OF REAL-TIME 

04:34:39.929 --> 04:34:42.578
EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING EVERY 
STEP OF DONALD TRUMP'S 

04:34:42.918 --> 04:34:45.609
CONSTITUTIONAL CRIME. WE SHOWED 
YOU HOW HE INDOCTRINATED THE MOB

04:34:45.784 --> 04:34:50.377
ABOUT HOW THE ELECTION HE LOST 
BY MORE THAN 7 

04:34:55.174 --> 04:34:57.174
MILLION VOTES

04:35:24.998 --> 04:35:31.288
EIGHT FEDERAL JUDGES HE HIMSELF 
NAMED TO THE BENCH, ALL FOUND NO

04:35:31.508 --> 04:35:35.708
BASIS IN FACT OR LAW FOR HIS 
OUTLANDISH AND ARRANGED 

04:35:35.928 --> 04:35:39.448
INVENTIONS AND CONCOCTIONS ABOUT
THE ELECTION. IN THE MEANTIME, 

04:35:40.508 --> 04:35:43.158
PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIED TO BULLY 
STATE-LEVEL OFFICIALS TO COMMIT 

04:35:43.378 --> 04:35:45.378
A FRAUD ON 

04:35:48.827 --> 04:35:51.095
THE PUBLIC BY LITERALLY FINDING 
VOTES. WE EXAMINE THE KEY STUDY 

04:35:51.298 --> 04:35:53.298
OF GEORGIA WHERE HE CALLED TO 
THREATEN REPUBLICAN BRAD TO 

04:35:56.298 --> 04:36:00.034
FIND HIM 11,780 VOTES, THAT'S 
ALL HE WANTED HE SAID. 11,780 

04:36:00.238 --> 04:36:02.318
VOTES. DON'T WE ALL? THAT'S ALL 

04:36:05.478 --> 04:36:07.574
HE WANTED TO NULLIFY BIDEN'S 
VICTORY AND TO WIN THE ELECTION.

04:36:07.877 --> 04:36:13.439
HE ENDED UP WITH SAVAGE DEATH 
THREATS AGAINST HIM AND HIS 

04:36:13.996 --> 04:36:16.039
FAMILY TELLING HIM HE DESERVED A
FIRING SQUAD. ANOTHER ELECTION 

04:36:16.358 --> 04:36:20.138
OFFICIAL URGED TRUMP TO CUT IT 
OUT WHERE PEOPLE WOULD GET HURT 

04:36:25.149 --> 04:36:28.458
AND KILLED. A WARNING A DAY. HE 
ENDED UP SAYING THAT HIM AND HIS

04:36:28.678 --> 04:36:32.938
FAMILY SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP, 
GAVE HIM MONEY AND NOW TRUMP 

04:36:33.108 --> 04:36:37.660
THROUGH US UNDER THE BUS. WE SAW
WHAT HAPPENED IN LANSING, 

04:36:38.158 --> 04:36:40.978
MICHIGAN WITH THE STREETS MOB HE
CULTIVATED WHICH LED TO TWO 

04:36:41.235 --> 04:36:44.929
SHOCKING C JUST AND A CRIMINAL 
CONSPIRACY BY EXTREME THIS TO 

04:36:45.099 --> 04:36:47.099
LIKELY GET 

04:36:50.158 --> 04:36:52.158
GOVERNOR WHITMER.

04:36:55.034 --> 04:36:56.917
AND OVERTHROW THEIR POPULAR 
ELECTION OF VOTES AND REPLACE 

04:36:56.918 --> 04:36:58.918
THEM WITH TRUMP ELECTORS, WE 
SHOWED YOU THE PROCESS OF 

04:36:59.017 --> 04:37:01.017
SUMMONING THE MOB, REACHING OUT,
URGING PEOPLE TO COME TO 

04:37:01.118 --> 04:37:03.219
WASHINGTON FOR A WILD TIME. AS 
WE CELEBRATE PRESIDENTS' DAY ON 

04:37:03.433 --> 04:37:09.914
MONDAY, THINK, IMAGINE, IS THERE
ANOTHER PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY

04:37:10.115 --> 04:37:12.198
WHO WOULD URGE SUPPORTERS TO 
COME TO WASHINGTON FOR A WILD 

04:37:12.417 --> 04:37:14.417
TIME? YOU SAW HOW 

04:37:18.004 --> 04:37:20.599
HE EMBRACED THE ELEMENTS LIKE 
THE PROUD BOYS WHO ARE TOLD IN A

04:37:20.759 --> 04:37:22.215
NATIONALLY TELEVISED 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DEBATE TO

04:37:22.216 --> 04:37:24.216
STAND BACK AND STANDBY WHICH 
BECAME THEIR 

04:37:28.498 --> 04:37:30.443
OFFICIAL SLOGAN AS THEY 
CONVERGED ON WASHINGTON WITH 

04:37:30.444 --> 04:37:32.953
OTHER EXTREMIST GROUPS AND 
COMPETED TO BE THE LEAD STORM 

04:37:33.098 --> 04:37:35.098
TROOPERS OF THE ATTACK ON 

04:37:38.179 --> 04:37:40.457
THIS BUILDING. YOU SAW THE 
ASSEMBLY OF THE MOB ON JANUARY 

04:37:40.817 --> 04:37:44.741
SIX. AND HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT 
ANGRY MOB MUST HAVE LOOKED TO 

04:37:45.117 --> 04:37:47.528
DONALD TRUMP AS HE PEERED DOWN 
WITH THE SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT 

04:37:47.748 --> 04:37:49.748
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
EMBLAZONED ON. HE 

04:37:53.598 --> 04:37:57.578
WAS -- THEY WERE ARMED TO THE 
TEETH AND READY TO FIGHT AND 

04:38:01.924 --> 04:38:05.728
OTHER SUPPORTERS, ALL OF THEM 
SAYING, STOP THE STEEL RIGHT 

04:38:06.082 --> 04:38:10.192
NOW. AND HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO
MARCH WITH THEM TO THE CAPITAL, 

04:38:10.330 --> 04:38:11.976
EVEN THOUGH THE PERMIT FOR THE 
RALLY SPECIFICALLY FOR BETA 

04:38:11.977 --> 04:38:13.977
MARCH BUT HE SAID 

04:38:17.358 --> 04:38:19.891
HE WOULD MARCH WITH THEM GIVING 
THEM MORE COMFORT THAN WHAT THEY

04:38:20.105 --> 04:38:22.199
WERE DOING WAS LEGITIMATE AND 
OKAY. BUT OF COURSE HE STAYED 

04:38:22.418 --> 04:38:25.352
BACK AS HE PRESUMABLY DIDN'T 
WANT TO BE TOO CLOSE TO THE 

04:38:25.554 --> 04:38:27.607
ACTION AT THE CAPITAL AS THE 
LAWYERS 

04:38:30.978 --> 04:38:33.637
CALLED IT. NOT IN INSURRECTION 
THEY URGED US YESTERDAY. IT IS 

04:38:33.775 --> 04:38:36.617
AN ACTION. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE 
TOO CLOSE TO THE ACTION WHEN ALL

04:38:36.753 --> 04:38:39.868
HELL WAS ABOUT TO BREAK LOOSE. 
NOW, INCITEMENT , AS WE 

04:38:40.038 --> 04:38:42.565
DISCUSSED, REQUIRES AN 
INHERENTLY FACT-BASED 

04:38:43.848 --> 04:38:45.848
EVIDENTIARY INQUIRY. AND THIS IS
WHAT 

04:38:48.440 --> 04:38:53.055
WE DID. WE GAVE YOU MANY HOURS 
OF SPECIFIC, FACTUAL DETAILS 

04:38:53.342 --> 04:38:55.342
ABOUT 

04:38:57.035 --> 04:38:58.927
TO USE CHENEY'S WORDS, THE 
PRESIDENT, HOW THE PRESIDENT 

04:38:58.928 --> 04:39:00.928
SUMMONED 

04:39:03.928 --> 04:39:05.928
THE MOB

04:39:07.519 --> 04:39:12.614
, ASSEMBLED THE MOB, INCITED IT,
LIT THE MATCH, SENDING THEM OFF 

04:39:13.238 --> 04:39:18.240
TO THE CAPITAL WHERE THEY 
THOUGHT AS THEY YELLED OUT THAT 

04:39:18.459 --> 04:39:20.861
THEY HAD BEEN INVITED BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

04:39:21.006 --> 04:39:22.097
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THEY 
UNLEASHED UNPARALLELED, VIOLENT 

04:39:22.098 --> 04:39:23.217
AGAINST OUR OVERWHELMED AND 
BESIEGED BUT HEROIC POLICE 

04:39:23.218 --> 04:39:25.218
OFFICERS

04:39:35.432 --> 04:39:37.432
NOW I'M CONVINCED MOST SENATORS 
MUST BE CONVINCED BY THIS 

04:39:37.493 --> 04:39:39.493
OVERWHELMING AND SPECIFIC DETAIL
BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS ARE. BUT 

04:39:39.573 --> 04:39:41.683
SAY YOU STILL HAVE YOUR DOUBTS. 
YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT REALLY 

04:39:41.884 --> 04:39:43.884
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SENDING 

04:39:46.718 --> 04:39:48.597
HIS FOLLOWERS TO PARTICIPATE IN 
A PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT RALLY. 

04:39:48.598 --> 04:39:50.598
THE KIND THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN 
ORGANIZED BY 

04:39:53.170 --> 04:39:55.170
JULIAN BOND TO MY OPPOSING 
COUNSEL 

04:39:59.179 --> 04:40:02.555
BROUGHT UP. OR JOHN LEWIS FOR 
THE STUDENT NONVIOLENT DONATING 

04:40:02.754 --> 04:40:05.258
COMMITTEE. MAYBE THE PRESIDENT 
REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO

04:40:05.468 --> 04:40:08.633
BE LIKE THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON 
AND DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING WHO 

04:40:13.658 --> 04:40:17.159
SAID  NONVIOLENCE IS THE ANSWER 
TO THE CRUCIAL MORAL AND 

04:40:17.377 --> 04:40:19.458
POLITICAL QUESTIONS OF OUR TIME 
SO LET'S STAY YOU ARE STILL 

04:40:19.659 --> 04:40:22.360
FLIRTING WITH THE IDEA THAT 
DONALD TRUMP'S CONDUCT WAS 

04:40:22.574 --> 04:40:24.574
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE AS HE 
PROCLAIMED RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND

04:40:24.641 --> 04:40:29.088
HE'S THE INCIDENT INNOCENT 
VICTIM OF A MASS ACCIDENT OR 

04:40:29.288 --> 04:40:31.574
CATASTROPHE LIKE A FIRE OR A 
FLOOD AS WE WERE INVITED TO 

04:40:31.775 --> 04:40:33.775
FRAME IT ON 

04:40:36.158 --> 04:40:37.823
OUR OPENING-DAY BY DISTINGUISHED
COCOUNSEL OR OPPOSING COUNSEL 

04:40:37.824 --> 04:40:39.824
AND YOU THINK, MAYBE, WE ARE 
JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY 

04:40:44.138 --> 04:40:46.238
TO BLAME FOR THIS NIGHTMARE AND 
CATASTROPHE. WE ARE JUST LOOKING

04:40:46.458 --> 04:40:48.868
FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME. WELL, 
HERE'S THE KEY QUESTION THEN IF 

04:40:49.048 --> 04:40:51.048
YOU ARE IN 

04:40:52.498 --> 04:40:54.788
THAT CATEGORY. HOW DID DONALD 
TRUMP REACT WHEN HE LEARNED THE 

04:40:54.958 --> 04:40:58.951
VIOLENT STORMING OF THE CAPITAL 
AND THE THREATS TO SENATORS, 

04:40:59.150 --> 04:41:03.886
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND HIS OWN
VICE PRESIDENT? AS WELL AS THE 

04:41:04.128 --> 04:41:07.740
IMAGES HE SAW ON TV OF THE 
PUMMELING AND BEATING AND 

04:41:08.048 --> 04:41:10.048
HARASSMENT OF OUR 

04:41:12.757 --> 04:41:15.239
POLICE OFFICERS? DID HE SPRING 
INTO ACTION TO STOP THE VIOLENCE

04:41:15.456 --> 04:41:17.456
AND 

04:41:19.633 --> 04:41:22.818
SAVE US? DID HE EVEN WONDER 
ABOUT HIS OWN SECURITY SINCE AN 

04:41:23.058 --> 04:41:25.058
OUT-OF-CONTROL ANTIGOVERNMENT 
MOB COULD COME AFTER HIM TOO? 

04:41:25.254 --> 04:41:30.418
DID HE QUICKLY TRIED TO GET IN 
TOUCH WITH OR DENOUNCE THE PROUD

04:41:30.928 --> 04:41:32.928
BOYS? THE OATH KEEPERS? THE 

04:41:35.250 --> 04:41:38.448
RALLY ORGANIZERS? AND EVERYONE 
ON THE EXTREME RIGHT COULD TELL 

04:41:38.658 --> 04:41:41.597
THEM THAT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE 
HAD IN MIND. IT WAS A BIG 

04:41:41.827 --> 04:41:43.320
MISTAKE. CALL IT OFF AS 
REPRESENTATIVE GALLAGHER BEGGED 

04:41:43.321 --> 04:41:45.490
HIM TO DO ON NATIONAL 

04:41:50.518 --> 04:41:52.518
TELEVISION. NO.

04:41:54.379 --> 04:41:58.308
HE DELIGHTED IN IT. HE REVELED 
IN IT. HE EXALTED IN IT. HE 

04:41:58.728 --> 04:42:01.229
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE 
PEOPLE AROUND HIM DID NOT SHARE 

04:42:01.423 --> 04:42:05.364
HIS DELIGHT. AND THEN A LONG 
PERIOD OF SILENCE ENSUED WHILE 

04:42:05.500 --> 04:42:09.108
THE MOB BEAT THE DAYLIGHTS OUT 
OF POLICE OFFICERS AND INVADED 

04:42:09.426 --> 04:42:13.313
THIS BUILDING AS YOU SAW IN 
SECURITY FOOTAGE AND PROCEEDED 

04:42:13.466 --> 04:42:17.461
TO HUNT DOWN VICE PRESIDENT MIKE
PENCE AS A TRAITOR AND ANNOUNCED

04:42:17.685 --> 04:42:22.179
AND CURSED SPEAKER PELOSI, BOTH 
OF WHOM YOU HEARD MOB MEMBERS 

04:42:22.929 --> 04:42:27.108
SAY THEY WANTED TO KILL. THEY 
WERE BOTH IN REAL DANGER. AND 

04:42:27.385 --> 04:42:29.966
OUR GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE BEEN 
THROWN INTO ABSOLUTE TURMOIL 

04:42:30.368 --> 04:42:33.438
WITHOUT THE HEROISM OF OUR 
OFFICERS AND THE BRAVERY AND 

04:42:33.691 --> 04:42:36.319
COURAGE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THIS ROOM. HERE'S WHAT ANTHONY 

04:42:36.499 --> 04:42:38.718
GONZALEZ OF OHIO SAID. HE'S A 
FORMER PRO FOOTBALL PLAYER. WE 

04:42:39.010 --> 04:42:41.010
ARE EMPLOYING THE PRESIDENT TO 
HELP 

04:42:44.779 --> 04:42:46.779
TO STAND

04:42:51.714 --> 04:42:57.068
HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. AND 
AS I'VE EMPHASIZED THIS MORNING 

04:42:57.271 --> 04:43:01.048
THAT DERELICTION OF DUTY, THAT 
DESERTION OF DUTY WAS CENTRAL TO

04:43:01.290 --> 04:43:06.027
HIS INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION 
AND AN EXTRA GOAL FROM IT. 

04:43:06.347 --> 04:43:08.347
INEXTRICABLE. 

04:43:11.238 --> 04:43:14.828
BOUND TOGETHER. IT REVEALS HIS 
STATE OF MIND THAT DAY, WHAT HE 

04:43:15.019 --> 04:43:18.958
WAS THINKING AS HE PROVOKED THE 
MOB TO VIOLENCE AND FURTHER 

04:43:19.418 --> 04:43:21.418
VIOLENCE, IT SHOWS HOW HE 
PERPETUATED HIS CONTINUING 

04:43:21.520 --> 04:43:23.520
OFFENSE ON JANUARY SIX, HIS 
COURSE 

04:43:26.488 --> 04:43:30.328
OF CONDUCT CHARGED IN THE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AS HE 

04:43:30.629 --> 04:43:32.909
FURTHER INCITED THE MOB DURING 
THE ATTACK, AIMING IT AT VICE 

04:43:33.154 --> 04:43:35.715
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE HIMSELF, 
WHILE FAILING TO QUELL IT AS 

04:43:35.962 --> 04:43:37.962
COMMANDER IN 

04:43:40.238 --> 04:43:44.848
CHIEF OR HIS REAL ROLE, THAT 
DAY, INSIGHT OR IN CHIEF. AND IT

04:43:45.049 --> 04:43:47.049
POWERFULLY DEMONSTRATES 

04:43:49.560 --> 04:43:51.834
THAT THAT HE KNEW OF COURSE THAT
VIOLENCE WAS FORESEEABLE. THAT 

04:43:52.158 --> 04:43:55.314
IT WAS PREDICTABLE, THAT DAY 
SINCE HE WAS 

04:43:58.498 --> 04:44:03.268
NOT SURPRISED AND THROUGH HIS 
OMISSION AND COMMISSION THAT DAY

04:44:03.488 --> 04:44:05.488
HE ABUSED HIS 

04:44:08.711 --> 04:44:10.711
OFFICE BY

04:44:13.238 --> 04:44:15.768
SIDING WITH THE INSURRECTIONIST 
AT ALMOST EVERY POINT RATHER 

04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:18.118
THAN WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE 
UNITED STATES. RATHER THAN WITH 

04:44:18.264 --> 04:44:20.264
THE CONSTITUTION. IN JUST 

04:44:22.634 --> 04:44:24.300
A MOMENT MY COLLEAGUE WILL 
ADDRESS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

04:44:24.301 --> 04:44:26.740
CONDUCT, HIS ACTIONS AND 
INACTIONS, HIS CULPABLE STATE OF

04:44:27.032 --> 04:44:29.198
MIND DURING THE ATTACK AS HE 
WILL ESTABLISH YESTERDAY'S 

04:44:29.473 --> 04:44:33.319
EXPLOSIVE REVELATIONS ABOUT 
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN 

04:44:33.529 --> 04:44:35.486
McCARTHY'S DESPERATE CALL TO 
TRUMP AND TRUMPS TRULY 

04:44:35.487 --> 04:44:37.693
ASTOUNDING REACTION CONFIRMED 
THAT TRUMP WAS DOING NOTHING TO 

04:44:37.977 --> 04:44:43.240
HELP THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM OR 
THIS BUILDING. IT IS NOW CLEAR 

04:44:43.482 --> 04:44:45.482
BEYOND DOUBT THAT TRUMP 
SUPPORTED THE ACTIONS OF THE MOB

04:44:45.573 --> 04:44:47.573
AND SO HE MUST BE CONVICTED. IT 

04:44:50.579 --> 04:44:54.959
IS SIMPLE. HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW 
COMBUSTIBLE THE SITUATION WAS, 

04:44:55.543 --> 04:44:58.858
HE KNEW THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE 
IN THE CROWD WHO WERE READY TO 

04:44:59.049 --> 04:45:01.755
JUMP INTO ACTION TO ENGAGE IN 
VIOLENCE AT ANY SIGNAL THAT HE 

04:45:01.907 --> 04:45:04.912
NEEDED THEM TO FIGHT LIKE HELL  
TO STOP  THE STEEL AND THEN HE 

04:45:05.119 --> 04:45:08.818
AIMED THEM RIGHT HERE WHERE HE 
TOLD 

04:45:13.827 --> 04:45:18.488
THEM THE STEAL WAS OCCURRING.  
THE INJURED AND 

04:45:23.486 --> 04:45:25.507
KILLED PEOPLE, CONVINCED THAT 
THEY WERE ACTING ON HIS 

04:45:25.678 --> 04:45:30.298
INSTRUCTIONS AND WITH HIS 
APPROVAL AND PROTECTION. AND 

04:45:30.827 --> 04:45:33.555
WHILE THAT HAPPENED, HE FURTHER 
INCITED THEM WHILE FAILING TO 

04:45:33.694 --> 04:45:35.694
DEFEND US. IF THAT IS NOT GROUND
PORK AND JET CONVICTION, IF THAT

04:45:39.262 --> 04:45:41.520
IS NOT MISDEMEANOR AGAINST THE 
REPUBLIC AND THE UNITED STATES 

04:45:41.682 --> 04:45:43.682
OF AMERICA, THEN NOTHING IS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MUST 

04:45:47.078 --> 04:45:49.159
BE CONVICT DID FOR THE SAFETY 
AND SECURITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY 

04:45:49.359 --> 04:45:53.554
AND OUR PEOPLE. MISTRESSES 
PELINI. -- 

04:45:58.578 --> 04:46:00.578
MR. SICILY.

04:46:08.199 --> 04:46:10.199
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

04:46:14.034 --> 04:46:15.713
MR. PRESIDENT, AS DISTINGUISHED 
SENATORS, AS WE'VE DEMONSTRATED,

04:46:15.714 --> 04:46:17.714
THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP INCITED THE

04:46:21.153 --> 04:46:23.153
VIOLENCE AND NEW VIOLENCE WAS 
FORESEEABLE ON JANUARY SIX. HE 

04:46:23.239 --> 04:46:25.691
KNEW THAT MANY IN THE CROWD WERE
POSED FOR VIOLENCE AT HIS URGING

04:46:25.892 --> 04:46:28.378
AND IN FACT MANY OF THE SEA AND 
THOUSANDS OF THE CROWD WERE 

04:46:28.599 --> 04:46:32.798
WEARING BODY ARMOR AND HELMETS 
AND HOLDING STICKS AND 

04:46:33.018 --> 04:46:35.018
FLAGPOLES. AND THEN HE NOT ONLY 
PROVOKED THAT VARIES IN 

04:46:39.461 --> 04:46:41.555
CROWD, BUT AIMED THEM AT THE 
CAPITAL. HE LITERALLY POINTED AT

04:46:41.756 --> 04:46:44.879
THIS BUILDING, AT US, DURING HIS
SPEECH. HE POINTED TO THE 

04:46:45.099 --> 04:46:46.958
BUILDING WHERE CONGRESS WAS 
GOING TO CERTIFY THE ELECTION 

04:46:46.959 --> 04:46:49.460
RESULTS AND WHERE HE KNEW THE 
VICE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WAS 

04:46:49.661 --> 04:46:51.661
PRESIDING OVER THE 

04:46:55.500 --> 04:46:58.024
PROCESS. NOW, NO ONE IS 
SUGGESTING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

04:46:58.239 --> 04:47:00.239
INTENDED EVERY DETAIL OF WHAT 
HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIXTH. BUT 

04:47:00.339 --> 04:47:04.519
WHEN HE DIRECTED THE SEA OF 
THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM WHO WERE 

04:47:04.738 --> 04:47:09.331
REPORTEDLY READY TO ENGAGE IN 
REAL VIOLENCE, WHEN HE TOLD THEM

04:47:09.531 --> 04:47:11.531
TO FIGHT LIKE HELL, HE INCITED 
VIOLENCE, TARGETED AT THE 

04:47:11.834 --> 04:47:13.834
CAPITAL  COMMAND HE MOST 
CERTAINLY FORESAW IT. 

04:47:18.519 --> 04:47:20.949
MY COLLEAGUE WILL STAND UP AFTER
ME AND WALK YOU THROUGH THE 

04:47:21.089 --> 04:47:23.089
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT 
SUPPORTS THOSE CLAIMS. I WANT 

04:47:27.501 --> 04:47:32.209
TO STOP AND START BY TALKING 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT. 

04:47:32.349 --> 04:47:33.825
THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION 
YESTERDAY ABOUT WHAT THE 

04:47:33.826 --> 04:47:35.631
PRESIDENT KNEW AND WHEN HE KNEW 
IT. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS 

04:47:35.632 --> 04:47:37.916
THAT WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT DID THAT DAY. 

04:47:38.117 --> 04:47:40.117
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT, THAT IS 
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HAS 

04:47:40.179 --> 04:47:44.578
REMAINED SILENT ABOUT WHAT HE 
WAS DOING DURING ONE OF THE 

04:47:44.716 --> 04:47:49.190
BLOODIEST ATTACKS ON OUR CAPITAL
SINCE 1812. DESPITE A FULL AND 

04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:51.916
FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO COME 
FORWARD, HE'S REFUSED TO COME 

04:47:52.118 --> 04:47:54.118
AND TELL 

04:47:57.330 --> 04:47:59.634
HIS STORY. AS MANAGER RASKIN 
SAID, WE WOULD ALL DO THAT. IN 

04:47:59.834 --> 04:48:01.834
FACT, I WOULD INSIST 

04:48:03.834 --> 04:48:06.538
ON IT. IF I WERE ACCUSED OF A 
GRAVE AND SERIOUS CRIME THAT I 

04:48:06.758 --> 04:48:09.461
WAS INNOCENT OF, I WOULD DEMAND 
THE RIGHT TO TELL MY SIDE OF THE

04:48:09.662 --> 04:48:11.662
STORY. PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLINED.
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTS THAT

04:48:14.689 --> 04:48:16.799
ARE UNDISPUTED THAT WE KNOW TO 
BE TRUE DESPITE THE PRESIDENTS 

04:48:17.019 --> 04:48:19.019
REESE'S REFUSAL 

04:48:22.228 --> 04:48:24.228
TO TESTIFY.

04:48:30.602 --> 04:48:32.602
PURSE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
COUNSEL HAVE RESORTED TO 

04:48:32.699 --> 04:48:34.158
ARGUMENTS THAT THE EVIDENCE 
PRESENTED WAS SOMEHOW 

04:48:34.159 --> 04:48:36.159
MANUFACTURED OR HIDDEN FROM IT 

04:48:40.619 --> 04:48:42.619
FROM THEM.

04:48:47.941 --> 04:48:52.549
WHEN THEY WERE ENTITLED TO HAVE 
THEM UNDERSTAND IN RESOLUTION 47

04:48:52.769 --> 04:48:54.769
AND THEY CANNOT AND HAVE NOT 

04:48:58.799 --> 04:49:00.799
ALLEGED OTHERWISE. AS TO THEIR 
DESPERATE CLAIM THAT EVIDENCE 

04:49:00.919 --> 04:49:04.689
WAS SOMEHOW MANUFACTURED, THEY 
HAVE NOW ALLEGED THAT ONE TWEET 

04:49:04.839 --> 04:49:09.293
FROM THEIR CLIENT WAS ACTUALLY 
INACCURATE. WE GOT THESE TWEETS 

04:49:09.494 --> 04:49:13.440
WHICH ARE STATEMENTS FROM THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT FROM A PART 

04:49:13.641 --> 04:49:15.641
PUBLIC ARCHIVE AND THEY ARE 

04:49:19.480 --> 04:49:21.480
ALL CORRECT.

04:49:37.916 --> 04:49:39.916
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT KNEW 
THAT AND WHEN HE 

04:49:44.579 --> 04:49:46.579
KNEW IT.

04:49:59.354 --> 04:50:04.379
THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AS YOU 
CAN SEE HERE FROM JUST AFTER 12 

04:50:04.599 --> 04:50:08.579
P.M. TO JUST BEFORE TWO P.M., 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED HIS 

04:50:08.799 --> 04:50:14.459
STATEMENT THAT THE RALLY WHICH 
INCITED INITIAL WAVE OF 

04:50:14.679 --> 04:50:18.659
PROTESTERS COMING DOWN TO THE 
CAPITAL. AND HIS SPEECH WAS 

04:50:21.973 --> 04:50:23.973
STILL ONGOING AND YOU SAW THE 
EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE BROADCASTING 

04:50:24.036 --> 04:50:26.036
THAT ON 

04:50:27.794 --> 04:50:29.794
THEIR PHONES. A MUCH 

04:50:31.942 --> 04:50:33.942
LARGER WAVE CAME TOWARD US AT 
THE CAPITAL. RIPPING DOWN 

04:50:38.787 --> 04:50:42.581
SCAFFOLDING AND TRIGGERING CALLS
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE. 

04:50:42.819 --> 04:50:44.678
30 MINUTES LATER AT 1:49 P.M. AS
THE VIOLENCE INTENSIFIED, 

04:50:44.679 --> 04:50:46.679
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED A VIDEO 
OF HIS REMARKS AT 

04:50:50.096 --> 04:50:53.340
THE RALLY WE WILL NOT TAKE IT 
ANYMORE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS 

04:50:56.770 --> 04:50:58.770
ALL ABOUT. DURING THE HALF HOUR 
FOLLOWING THAT TWEET, THE 

04:50:59.450 --> 04:51:03.411
SITUATION HERE DRASTICALLY 
DETERIORATED. THEY REACH THE 

04:51:06.619 --> 04:51:08.619
CAPITAL BARRIERS THAN ITS STEPS,
THAN THE 

04:51:11.165 --> 04:51:12.782
COMPLEX ITSELF. BY 212, THE 
INSURRECTIONIST MOB HAD 

04:51:12.783 --> 04:51:15.691
OVERWHELMED THE POLICE AND 
STARTED THEIR VIOLENT ATTACK ON 

04:51:17.179 --> 04:51:19.664
THE CAPITAL. AS YOU ALL KNOW, 
THIS ATTACKER HEARD AND PLAYED 

04:51:19.864 --> 04:51:23.220
OUT ON LIVE TELEVISION. EVERY 
MAJOR NETWORK WAS 

04:51:28.239 --> 04:51:30.551
SHOWING IT. WE'VE SHOWN YOU 
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL,

04:51:30.752 --> 04:51:34.578
SIDE-BY-SIDE, EXACTLY WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD'VE SEEN ON TV OR

04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:36.859
HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT. WE'VE ALSO 
SHOWN YOU THAT HE WOULD'VE SEEN 

04:51:37.078 --> 04:51:41.666
AROUND 2:12 P.M. IMAGES OF ICED 
PENS BEING RUSHED OFF THE SENATE

04:51:41.880 --> 04:51:46.239
FLOOR. NOW I WON'T REPLAY ALL OF
THAT FOR YOU, BUT FOR TIMING 

04:51:46.489 --> 04:51:48.317
PURPOSES, HERE'S THE FOOTAGE 
REACTING TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE

04:51:48.318 --> 04:51:51.459
LEADING THE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT 

04:51:56.034 --> 04:51:57.720
SEEMED LIKE THEY JUST DID THAT 
REALLY QUICKLY. 

04:51:57.721 --> 04:52:02.319
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES THEY DID, THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHAT HAPPENED. I SAW THE 

04:52:06.279 --> 04:52:07.984
MOTIONS TOO. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DEFENSE COUNSEL SEEMS TO 

04:52:07.985 --> 04:52:09.985
SUGGEST 

04:52:11.099 --> 04:52:13.720
THAT SOMEHOW THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT AWARE 

04:52:13.923 --> 04:52:17.992
OF THIS. THE PRESIDENT HAD NO 
IDEA THAT HIS VICE PRESIDENT HAD

04:52:18.259 --> 04:52:23.115
BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE SENATE 
FLOOR FOR HIS SAFETY BECAUSE 

04:52:23.329 --> 04:52:26.149
VIOLIN WRITERS HAD BROKEN INTO 
THE CAPITAL AND THOUSANDS MORE 

04:52:26.793 --> 04:52:29.852
COMING. AND WITH THE CAPITAL 
POLICE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED. 

04:52:30.097 --> 04:52:33.644
THIS WAS ON LIVE TELEVISION. SO 
DEFENSE COUNSEL SUGGESTING THAT 

04:52:34.199 --> 04:52:37.398
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES KNEW LESS ABOUT THIS THAN

04:52:37.578 --> 04:52:40.759
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS 
JUST 

04:52:44.359 --> 04:52:47.740
NOT POSSIBLE. THAT THE SECRET 
SERVICE FAILED TO MENTION THAT 

04:52:47.894 --> 04:52:51.338
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS BEING 
RUSHED FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION. 

04:52:51.578 --> 04:52:57.237
BUT NOBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
THOUGHT TO ALERT HIM. AND NONE 

04:52:57.498 --> 04:52:59.550
OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
RAISED A CONCERN TO THE 

04:52:59.770 --> 04:53:04.203
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT THE VICE
PRESIDENT WAS BEING EVACUATED 

04:53:05.214 --> 04:53:13.173
FROM THE SENATE FLOOR AS A 
VIOLENT MOB ASSAULTED THE 

04:53:13.432 --> 04:53:15.407
CAPITAL. THAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE. 
AND WITH EACH PASSING MINUTE ON 

04:53:15.408 --> 04:53:18.459
THE TIMELINE OF EVENTS ON 
JANUARY SIXTH, IT GROWS MORE AND

04:53:19.029 --> 04:53:21.215
MORE INCONCEIVABLE. THAT'S 
CONTINUE FORWARD IN TIME. 

04:53:21.624 --> 04:53:26.120
BETWEEN 212 22:24, THE SENATE 
RECESSED, SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI 

04:53:26.619 --> 04:53:28.629
WAS USHERED OFF THE FLOOR, THE 
CAPITAL POLICE ANNOUNCED A 

04:53:28.899 --> 04:53:31.768
BREACH OF A LOCKDOWN AND THE 
INSURRECTIONIST MOB BEGAN 

04:53:32.133 --> 04:53:37.609
CHANTING, HANG THE MIKE PENCE. 
IT WAS UNFOLDING ON LIVE TV IN 

04:53:37.869 --> 04:53:43.418
FRONT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. SO 
AGAIN, LET ME ASK YOU, DOES IT 

04:53:43.739 --> 04:53:45.739
STRIKE YOU AS CREDIBLE THAT 
NOBODY, NOT A 

04:53:50.163 --> 04:53:54.525
SINGLE PERSON INFORMED THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HIS VICE 

04:53:54.900 --> 04:53:59.375
PRESIDENT HAD BEEN EVACUATED OR 
THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 

04:54:00.419 --> 04:54:03.908
AT THE TELEVISION OR HIS TWITTER
ACCOUNT AND LEARN ABOUT THE 

04:54:04.057 --> 04:54:06.799
EVENTS THAT WERE HAPPENING? 
REMEMBER, THIS WAS THE DAY OF 

04:54:07.253 --> 04:54:09.576
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. REMEMBER,
HIS OBSESSION WITH STOPPING THE 

04:54:09.999 --> 04:54:14.369
CERTIFICATION. IT IS JUST NOT 
CREDIBLE THAT 

04:54:16.339 --> 04:54:18.588
NO POINT, KNEW HIS VICE 
PRESIDENT WAS IN THIS BUILDING 

04:54:19.079 --> 04:54:25.039
AND WAS IN REAL DANGER. 
SENATORS, I SUBMIT TO YOU THESE 

04:54:25.381 --> 04:54:28.529
FACTS, THIS TIMELINE IS 
UNDISPUTED. AT 224 P.M. AFTER 

04:54:29.029 --> 04:54:31.029
WRITERS REACHED THE BARRIERS 
COME AFTER CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE,

04:54:31.359 --> 04:54:35.279
AFTER WRITERS STORMED THE 
BUILDING, AFTER VICE PRESIDENT 

04:54:35.970 --> 04:54:41.407
PENCE WAS RUSHED FROM THE SENATE
FLOOR AND JUST BEFORE VICE 

04:54:41.681 --> 04:54:43.945
PRESIDENT PENCE WAS FURTHER 
EVACUATED FOR HIS SAFETY, 

04:54:44.115 --> 04:54:46.115
PRESIDENT TRUMP DECIDED TO 
ATTACK HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT ON

04:54:46.139 --> 04:54:48.313
TWITTER. THE UNDISPUTED FACTS 
CONFIRM THAT NOT ONLY MUST 

04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:51.769
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE BEEN AWARE 
OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S DANGER 

04:54:52.246 --> 04:54:54.722
BUT HE STILL SENT OUT A TWEET 
ATTACKING HIM, FURTHER INCITING 

04:54:54.922 --> 04:55:00.139
THE VERY MOB THAT WAS JUST A FEW
FEET INSIDE OF THIS 

04:55:01.616 --> 04:55:07.990
BUILDING. THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS
THERE WITH HIS FAMILY. HE WAS IN

04:55:08.679 --> 04:55:12.096
DANGER FOR HIS LIFE. THEY WERE 
CHANTING, HANG MIKE PENCE AND 

04:55:12.239 --> 04:55:14.239
HAD ERECTED A 

04:55:15.756 --> 04:55:17.833
NOOSE OUTSIDE AND AS WE SHOWN 
THE MOB RESPONDED TO PRESIDENT 

04:55:18.280 --> 04:55:23.663
TRUMP'S ATTACK INSTANTLY. THE 
TWEET WAS READ ALOUD ON A 

04:55:23.953 --> 04:55:26.029
BULLHORN IF YOU REMEMBER THAT 
VIDEO. INSURRECTIONIST AGAIN 

04:55:27.189 --> 04:55:29.189
CHANTING ABOUT MIKE 

04:55:32.679 --> 04:55:40.203
PENCE. AND THEY FURTHER INSIDE 
OF THE MOB IN REAL TIME TO 

04:55:40.927 --> 04:55:44.989
TARGET THE VICE PRESIDENT WITH 
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE INSURRECTION 

04:55:45.377 --> 04:55:50.219
WAS ONGOING AND THAT IS OF 
COURSE INCLUDED IN THE CONDUCT 

04:55:50.719 --> 04:55:52.719
CHARGE

04:55:55.642 --> 04:56:00.899
IT IS IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT THAT 
CONTINUED DURING THE COURSE OF 

04:56:04.959 --> 04:56:07.605
THE ASSAULT AND IT IS PART OF 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRIME AND WAS

04:56:07.804 --> 04:56:11.179
ENTIRELY AND COMPLETELY APART OF
HIS INDEFENSIBLE FAILURE TO 

04:56:11.340 --> 04:56:13.340
PROTECT 

04:56:15.949 --> 04:56:18.241
THE CONGRESS. NOW, THERE'S BEEN 
SOME CONFUSION AS TO THE PHONE 

04:56:18.639 --> 04:56:21.949
CALL I REFERENCED WITH SENATOR 
LEE SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT 

04:56:22.119 --> 04:56:25.598
CERTAIN FACTS THAT ARE NOT IN 
DISPUTE. FIRST, SENATOR LEE HAS 

04:56:25.759 --> 04:56:28.386
CONFIRMED THAT THE CALL OCCURRED
AT 226 P.M. SO I HAVE ADDED THAT

04:56:28.574 --> 04:56:33.331
TO THE TIMELINE ABOVE. REMEMBER,
BY THIS PHONE CALL, THE VICE 

04:56:33.532 --> 04:56:35.947
PRESIDENT HAS JUST BEEN 
EVACUATED ON LIVE TELEVISION FOR

04:56:36.083 --> 04:56:41.231
HIS OWN SAFETY. AND DONALD TRUMP
HAD COME AFTER THAT, TWEETED AN 

04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:43.430
ATTACK 

04:56:45.835 --> 04:56:49.864
ON HIM WHICH THE INSURGENTS READ
ON A BULLHORN AND A FEW MINUTES 

04:56:50.039 --> 04:56:53.722
AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET, HE 
DIDN'T REACH OUT TO CHECK ON THE

04:56:53.968 --> 04:56:56.279
VICE PRESIDENT'S SAFETY. HE 
CALLED THE SENATOR TO ASK ABOUT 

04:56:56.459 --> 04:56:58.599
DELAYING THE CERTIFICATION. THE 
CALL 

04:57:03.301 --> 04:57:05.301
WAS INTERRUPTED,

04:57:11.895 --> 04:57:15.245
THE SENATOR HAS SINCE EXPLAINED,
AND I QUOTE, I LOOKED AT THE 

04:57:15.450 --> 04:57:18.379
PHONE AND IT SAID THE WHITE 
HOUSE ON IT. I SAID HELLO? THE 

04:57:18.619 --> 04:57:20.619
PRESIDENT SAID A FEW WORDS, I 
SAID MR. PRESIDENT, THEY ARE 

04:57:20.700 --> 04:57:22.700
TAKING THE VICE PRESIDENT OUT 
AND THEY WANT ME TO GET OFF THE 

04:57:22.809 --> 04:57:24.578
PHONE AND I'VE GOT TO GO,". THAT
WAS HIS SECOND EVACUATION THAT 

04:57:24.579 --> 04:57:26.579
DAY. A MINUTE LATER, LIVE FEEDS 

04:57:29.996 --> 04:57:32.087
DOCUMENTED THEM IN SURGING MIKE 
PENCE IS A TRAITOR. AT THIS 

04:57:37.099 --> 04:57:43.140
POINT, EVEN IF SOMEHOW HE HAD 
MISSED IT EARLIER, IT IS 

04:57:43.277 --> 04:57:44.518
INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT WAS UNAWARE THAT THE 

04:57:44.519 --> 04:57:46.120
VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN DANGER. 
AND WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT DO 

04:57:46.121 --> 04:57:50.459
AFTER HEARING THAT? DOES HE RUSH
TO SECURE THE CAPITAL? DOES HE 

04:57:50.679 --> 04:57:55.565
DO ANYTHING TO QUELL THE MOB? 
DOES HE CALL HIS VICE PRESIDENT 

04:57:55.855 --> 04:58:00.290
TO CHECK ON HIS SAFETY? WE ALL 
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THOSE 

04:58:00.449 --> 04:58:04.055
QUESTIONS TOO. THERE CAN BE NO 
DISPUTE. HE TOOK NONE OF THOSE 

04:58:04.273 --> 04:58:06.273
STEPS. NOT A 

04:58:09.710 --> 04:58:13.239
SINGLE ONE. EVEN AFTER LEARNING 
THAT SENATORS WERE BEING 

04:58:13.594 --> 04:58:17.009
EVACUATED AND THAT VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE ALSO BEEN 

04:58:17.465 --> 04:58:22.519
EVACUATED, HE DID NOTHING TO 
HELP THE VICE PRESIDENT. AND 

04:58:23.059 --> 04:58:28.170
HERE'S SOME MORE EVIDENCE THAT 
WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED. AT SOME 

04:58:28.301 --> 04:58:32.199
POINT OVER THE FOLLOWING 30 
MINUTES, PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE 

04:58:32.399 --> 04:58:36.159
TO MINORITY LEADER KEVIN 
McCARTHY AND THEY HAVE REVEALED 

04:58:36.378 --> 04:58:39.225
EVIDENCE THAT HAS NOW BEEN 
STIPULATED AS PART OF THE 

04:58:43.673 --> 04:58:46.159
EVIDENTIARY RECORD AND THAT 
CONVERSATION, KEVIN McCARTHY IS 

04:58:46.379 --> 04:58:49.721
PLEADING WITH THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING. HE 

04:58:49.922 --> 04:58:54.319
FIRST TRIES TO ASSIGN THE BLAME 
TO ANOTHER GROUP AND LEADER 

04:58:54.519 --> 04:58:57.899
McCARTHY SAYS, NO, THESE ARE 
YOUR SUPPORTERS MR. PRESIDENT. 

04:58:58.119 --> 04:59:00.119
AND WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT SAY 

04:59:04.219 --> 04:59:11.129
IN RESPONSE? NOT SEND PEOPLE 
RIGHT AWAY, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU

04:59:11.791 --> 04:59:16.229
WERE IN DANGER. HE SAYS, WELL, 
KEVIN, AND I QUOTE, WELL, KEVIN,

04:59:16.379 --> 04:59:17.987
I GUESS THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE 
UPSET ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN 

04:59:17.988 --> 04:59:21.722
YOU ARE. AND QUOTE. I GUESS 
THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE UPSET 

04:59:21.922 --> 04:59:23.922
ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN 

04:59:25.717 --> 04:59:28.509
YOU ARE. THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID
HE CONVEYED IN THAT TWEET AT 

04:59:28.770 --> 04:59:30.969
SIX: 01 WAS ESSENTIALLY SAYING 
YOU GOT WHAT 

04:59:35.468 --> 04:59:41.467
YOU DESERVE. LET ME SAY THAT 
AGAIN. NOT ONLY WAS THE 

04:59:41.728 --> 04:59:44.189
PRESIDENT FULLY AWARE OF THE 
VICE PRESIDENT'S SITUATION AND 

04:59:44.569 --> 04:59:46.749
THE SITUATION THAT WE WERE ALL 
IN WHEN HE WAS ASKED FOR HELP, 

04:59:46.880 --> 04:59:50.109
WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO DEFEND THE 
CAPITAL, PRESIDENT 

04:59:53.381 --> 04:59:55.381
TRUMP REFUSED THAT REQUEST 

04:59:58.599 --> 05:00:02.579
FOR ASSISTANCE. HIS SINGULAR 
FOCUS, STOPPING THE 

05:00:02.880 --> 05:00:04.880
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION OF

05:00:08.639 --> 05:00:10.639
HIS OPPONENT.

05:00:14.439 --> 05:00:16.439
HE INCITED THE VIOLENCE TO STOP 
THE CERTIFICATION. HE ATTACKED 

05:00:16.519 --> 05:00:18.519
THE VICE PRESIDENT AND FURTHER 
INCITED THE INSURRECTION TO 

05:00:18.622 --> 05:00:21.476
PRESSURE THE VICE PRESIDENT TO 
STOP THE CERTIFICATION. HE 

05:00:21.791 --> 05:00:25.009
CALLED SENATOR HUBBELL REAL TO 
STOP IT AND HE REFUSED TO SEND 

05:00:25.418 --> 05:00:26.912
HELP TO CONGRESS. AND THIS 
CONGRESS ON THE VICE PRESIDENT 

05:00:26.913 --> 05:00:29.298
OF THE UNITED STATES WERE IN A 
MORTAL DANGER BECAUSE HE WANTED 

05:00:29.514 --> 05:00:32.860
TO STOP THE CERTIFICATION. AND 
HE DID THESE THINGS, ATTACKING 

05:00:33.079 --> 05:00:35.439
THE VICE PRESIDENT, CALLING 
SENATOR 

05:00:39.714 --> 05:00:43.244
TARBORO, REFUSING THE REQUEST 
WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE 

05:00:43.621 --> 05:00:45.621
VIOLENT ATTACK THAT WAS UNDERWAY
AT 

05:00:48.439 --> 05:00:50.520
THAT POINT. HE CHOSE RETAINING 
HIS OWN POWER OVER THE SAFETY 

05:00:54.939 --> 05:00:57.019
OF AMERICANS. I CAN'T IMAGINE 
ANY MORE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF HIS

05:00:57.220 --> 05:01:01.975
STATE OF MIND. THE CALL ENDING 
WITH A SCREAMING MATCH WITH 

05:01:02.179 --> 05:01:06.819
VIOLENT WRITERS BREAKING THROUGH
THE WINDOWS OF THE OFFICE. 

05:01:07.039 --> 05:01:09.131
SENATORS, THE PRESIDENT KNEW 
THIS 

05:01:12.479 --> 05:01:14.479
WAS HAPPENING. THEY DIDN'T DO 
ANYTHING TO HELP HIS VICE 

05:01:14.599 --> 05:01:16.599
PRESIDENT OR ANY 

05:01:19.615 --> 05:01:22.639
OF YOU OR ANY OF THE BRAVE 
OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES 

05:01:22.770 --> 05:01:24.668
SERVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT
THEY. HIS SOLE FOCUS WAS 

05:01:24.669 --> 05:01:27.355
STEALING THE ELECTION FOR 
HIMSELF. AND HE APPARENTLY HAS 

05:01:27.554 --> 05:01:31.270
STILL NOT THOUGHT OF ANYONE 
ELSE. ACCORDING TO MORE NEW 

05:01:31.473 --> 05:01:34.379
FACTS REVEALED LAST NIGHT, THE 
VICE PRESIDENT'S TEAM DOES NOT 

05:01:34.599 --> 05:01:37.523
AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S 
COUNSEL OR HIS 

05:01:41.924 --> 05:01:44.210
ASSESSMENT EITHER. PENCE IS TEAM
DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE TRUMP 

05:01:44.859 --> 05:01:49.240
LAWYERS ASSESSMENT THAT TRUMP 
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS SAFETY. 

05:01:49.441 --> 05:01:53.439
TRUMP DID NOT CALL HIM THAT DAY.
OR FOR FIVE DAYS AFTER THAT. NO 

05:01:53.652 --> 05:01:56.578
ONE ELSE CALLED AS PENCE WAS 
EVACUATED TO ONE ROOM OR ANOTHER

05:01:56.800 --> 05:01:58.800
WITH A SCREAMING 

05:02:01.583 --> 05:02:03.583
MOB NEARBY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OBJECTION, THIS IS NOT 

05:02:08.259 --> 05:02:10.999
IN EVIDENCE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COUNCIL WILL SIT DOWN. 

05:02:13.300 --> 05:02:15.300
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, NUMBER 

05:02:19.759 --> 05:02:21.759
-- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:02:25.637 --> 05:02:27.637
THE COUNCIL WILL HAVE A CHANCE 

05:02:31.640 --> 05:02:39.175
TO SPEAK AND THE CHAIR WILL 
CONSIDER THE ISSUE. 

05:02:39.176 --> 05:02:42.760
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, REMEMBER AS ONE OF 
YOU SAID DURING THIS ATTACK, 

05:02:42.900 --> 05:02:47.079
THEY COULD HAVE KILLED US ALL. 
STAFF, THE OPPOSITE IS 

05:02:47.294 --> 05:02:50.840
PROTECTING ALL OF US, EVERYONE. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY 

05:02:52.939 --> 05:02:54.939
INCITED IT, BUT CONTINUED 
INCITING IT AS 

05:02:57.298 --> 05:02:59.298
IT OCCURRED WITH ATTACKS ON HIS 
VICE PRESIDENT AND THEN 

05:02:59.361 --> 05:03:03.332
WILLFULLY REFUSED TO DEFEND US 
FURTHERING HIS PROVOCATION AND 

05:03:03.533 --> 05:03:07.340
INCITEMENT BY THE MOB, SIDING 
WITH THE MOB, SIDING WITH THE 

05:03:08.159 --> 05:03:12.520
VIOLENT INSURRECTION AS THEY 
KILLED POLICE OFFICERS SWORN TO 

05:03:16.459 --> 05:03:18.459
PROTECT US BECAUSE THEY WERE 
COMICAL, MORE UPSET ABOUT THE 

05:03:18.540 --> 05:03:20.540
ELECTION THAN 

05:03:23.770 --> 05:03:25.770
LEADER McCARTHY.

05:03:49.079 --> 05:03:53.039
THERE CAN MEDO DOUBT THAT AT THE
MOMENT WE MOST NEEDED A 

05:03:53.239 --> 05:03:55.239
PRESIDENT TO PRESERVE, PROTECT 
AND 

05:03:59.260 --> 05:04:01.260
DEFEND US

05:04:14.159 --> 05:04:18.138
THAT IS WHY HE MUST BE 
CONVICTED. I WOULD LIKE TO 

05:04:18.359 --> 05:04:22.139
CONCLUDE BY MAKING ONE FINAL 
POINT THAT FILES FROM DIRECTLY 

05:04:22.359 --> 05:04:25.301
WHAT I JUST DISCUSSED. OUR CASE 
AND THE ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT 

05:04:26.552 --> 05:04:28.552
BEFORE YOU 

05:04:30.759 --> 05:04:32.759
ABSOLUTELY INCLUDES PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S DERELICTION OF DUTY ON 

05:04:37.207 --> 05:04:39.207
JANUARY SIX.

05:04:44.360 --> 05:04:49.161
THAT IS A FURTHER BASIS ON WHICH
TO CONVICT AND THERE CAN BE NO 

05:04:49.363 --> 05:04:52.037
DOUBT OF THAT. THE ONGOING 
CONSTITUTIONAL MISCONDUCT IS 

05:04:52.239 --> 05:04:56.179
LIKE ANY CONTINUED OFFENSE AND 
THE PROOF OF THAT IS 

05:04:56.400 --> 05:04:58.400
OVERWHELMING. 

05:05:01.220 --> 05:05:02.899
MOST DIRECTLY, HIS DERELICTION 
OF DUTY OFFERS CONCLUSIVE, 

05:05:02.900 --> 05:05:04.900
IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT HE 
ACTED WILLFULLY AS 

05:05:08.559 --> 05:05:13.181
WE CHARGE. HE WASN'T FURIOUS OR 
SAD OR SHOCKED, LIKE VIRTUALLY 

05:05:13.354 --> 05:05:18.769
EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA. HE WAS
REPORTED BY THOSE AROUND HIM AS 

05:05:18.990 --> 05:05:22.760
DELIGHTED. RATHER THAN RUSH TO 
OUR AID OR DEMAND HIS MOB 

05:05:23.019 --> 05:05:25.462
RETREAT HE WATCHED THE ATTACK ON
TV AND PRAISE THE MOB TO LEADER 

05:05:25.669 --> 05:05:31.723
McCARTHY AS MORE LOYAL TO HIM. 
MORE UPSET ABOUT THE ELECTION 

05:05:31.922 --> 05:05:36.683
AND THAT WAS ALL THAT MATTERED. 
HIS REACTION IS ALSO FURTHER 

05:05:36.869 --> 05:05:43.219
EVIDENCE OF HIS INTENT. HE ACTED
EXACTLY THE WAY A PERSON WOULD 

05:05:43.433 --> 05:05:46.140
ACT IF THEY HAD INDEED INCITED 
THE MOB TO VIOLENCE TO STOP THE 

05:05:48.159 --> 05:05:50.159
STEAL.  MOREOVER AS I'VE SHOWN 

05:05:52.299 --> 05:05:54.179
PRESIDENT TRUMP DERELICTION AND 
DUTY INCLUDES HIS DECISION TO 

05:05:54.180 --> 05:05:58.160
FURTHER INSIGHT THE MOB, EVEN IF
HE FAILED TO 

05:06:03.162 --> 05:06:05.162
PROTECT US.

05:06:21.421 --> 05:06:23.421
ENCOURAGING AND PROVOKING THE 
MOB 

05:06:27.253 --> 05:06:29.253
TO VIOLENCE.

05:07:07.997 --> 05:07:10.068
HE CONTINUED TO TELL HIS 
SUPPORTERS WAS STOLEN AND HE HAD

05:07:10.278 --> 05:07:12.278
ACTUALLY WON IN 

05:07:14.240 --> 05:07:16.793
A LANDSLIDE. AND HE WASN'T 
SURPRISED. HE SAW THIS AS A 

05:07:16.969 --> 05:07:18.479
PREDICTABLE RESULT OF HIS 
REPEATED DEMANDS THAT HIS 

05:07:18.480 --> 05:07:21.555
FOLLOWERS STOP THE STEAL BY ANY 
MEANS POSSIBLE.  THIS WAS ALL 

05:07:21.757 --> 05:07:25.356
CONNECTED. HIS DERELICTION OF 
DUTY, HIS DESERTION OF DUTY WAS 

05:07:25.556 --> 05:07:27.556
PART AND PARCEL OF THE 

05:07:31.378 --> 05:07:33.378
CRIME CHARGED

05:07:38.440 --> 05:07:45.330
HE WAS DELIGHTED BY THE ATTACK 
AND HE SAW IT AS A NATURAL 

05:07:45.531 --> 05:07:48.057
RESULT OF HIS CALL TO STOP THE 
STEAL AND THAT HE CONTINUED TO 

05:07:48.260 --> 05:07:52.709
INSIGHT AND  TARGET VIOLENCE AS 
THE ATTACK UNFOLDED, WE 

05:07:53.093 --> 05:07:55.762
RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT YOU MUST 
VOTE TO CONVICT AND DISQUALIFY. 

05:07:59.574 --> 05:08:01.843
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIX, SO 
THEY CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN 

05:08:04.159 --> 05:08:07.925
THIS COUNTRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 

05:08:07.926 --> 05:08:11.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UP MS. 
DEAN. 

05:08:11.856 --> 05:08:16.141
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'VE GOT A POINT OF ORDER MR.
PRESIDENT. 

05:08:16.142 --> 05:08:18.289
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, MOMENTS AGO, 

05:08:22.088 --> 05:08:26.248
HOUSE MANAGER RECORDED AGAIN -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CENTER 

05:08:29.355 --> 05:08:32.430
WILL WITHHOLD AND ADVISED BY THE
PROLETARIAN THAT DEBATE IS NOT 

05:08:33.332 --> 05:08:35.332
IN 

05:08:36.460 --> 05:08:40.760
ORDER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DEBATE IS NOT IN ORDER 

05:08:41.439 --> 05:08:47.040
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT DEBATE. HE 
SAID SOMETHING THAT IS NOT TRUE.

05:08:47.629 --> 05:08:52.620
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COURT HAS BEEN -- AND THE
CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLE. 

05:08:52.621 --> 05:08:54.621
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MS. BALDWIN. 

05:09:05.240 --> 05:09:07.581
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THERE OBJECTION? OBJECTION

05:09:11.892 --> 05:09:13.892
IS HEARD.

05:09:32.400 --> 05:09:34.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. BENNETT. 

05:10:11.922 --> 05:10:15.240
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR LEE RAISING CONCERNS 
HERE BUT THERE IS A QUESTION 

05:10:15.933 --> 05:10:22.006
APPOINTED IN ORDER AND WHETHER 
OR NOT SENATOR CAN RAISE 

05:10:23.010 --> 05:10:27.134
OBJECTIONS IN THIS MOMENT BASED 
ON PROCEDURE. JAMES HOMAN IS MY 

05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:30.160
GUEST, I'M LIBBY CASEY AND YOU 
ARE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE FROM 

05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:38.819
THE WASHINGTON POST. WE ARE 
GOING TO KEEP OUR EYES ON AS AN 

05:10:38.970 --> 05:10:42.250
AUTHORITY FIGURE OUT HOW THEY 
DECIDE TO PROCEED. AT THE HEART 

05:10:42.764 --> 05:10:49.787
OF THIS IS MIKE LEE'S OBJECTIONS
TO A PHONE CALL THAT THEY ARE 

05:10:49.924 --> 05:10:51.745
TALKING ABOUT A PHONE CALL THAT 
HE RECEIVED, JAMES. 

05:10:51.746 --> 05:10:58.003
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE 
THAT CAME UP THE OTHER NIGHT 

05:10:58.139 --> 05:11:00.910
AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF DEBATE 
AND IT IS RELEVANT BECAUSE IT 

05:11:01.176 --> 05:11:05.617
WAS SCOOPED A FEW HOURS AGO THAT
MIKE LEE ACTUALLY TURNED OVER 

05:11:05.898 --> 05:11:08.850
HIS PHONE RECORDS TO THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ON THE 

05:11:09.346 --> 05:11:11.672
HOUSE DEFENSE TEAM. IT IS NOT 
CLEAR WHAT EXACTLY HE IS 

05:11:11.996 --> 05:11:14.480
COMPLAINING ABOUT BECAUSE HE 
ALSO RECOUNTED THE SAME VERSION 

05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:17.742
OF EVENTS HIMSELF ON THE RECORD 
TO THE DOES RETINUES. HE TOLD 

05:11:18.130 --> 05:11:20.150
REPORTERS THIS VERSION OF EVENTS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER JANUARY SIX. 

05:11:20.370 --> 05:11:23.407
IT SEEMS SENATOR LEE IS 
FRUSTRATED AND ANNOYED THAT HIS 

05:11:23.743 --> 05:11:29.763
NAME IS BEING CITED AND INVOKED 
AS PART OF THE CASE 

05:11:31.776 --> 05:11:34.810
PRESIDENT AND IT WAS INTERESTING
BECAUSE DURING THE PRESENTATION 

05:11:35.060 --> 05:11:38.739
WE JUST HEARD THERE WAS A QUOTE 
FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO WAS ALSO

05:11:39.118 --> 05:11:41.890
DEAD SET AGAINST IMPEACHING THE 
PRESIDENT BUT ONE SENATOR HERE'S

05:11:42.106 --> 05:11:47.499
THAT AND DIDN'T MENTION LINDSEY 
GRAHAM BY NAME BUT THEY DID 

05:11:47.846 --> 05:11:51.616
MENTION MICHAEL LEE BECAUSE THIS
IS IMPORTANT TO THIS IDEA THAT 

05:11:52.014 --> 05:11:57.080
TRUMP WAS TRYING TO REACH TOMMY 
TO BARRVILLE, THE SENATOR FROM 

05:11:57.503 --> 05:12:00.480
ALABAMA. TRUMP CALLED MIKE LEE'S
CELL PHONE INSTEAD OF TO BRAZILS

05:12:00.820 --> 05:12:04.107
CELL PHONE BECAUSE OF SOME 
CONFUSION OR MIXUP SO IT SEEMS 

05:12:04.247 --> 05:12:06.595
LIKE ALLEGIS DOESN'T WANT TO BE 
PART OF THE STORYLINE AT ALL BUT

05:12:06.731 --> 05:12:08.599
AGAIN THE KEY THING IS THAT JUST
LAST NIGHT SENATOR TURBERVILLE 

05:12:08.600 --> 05:12:10.901
CONFIRMED ONCE AGAIN THAT WHAT 
HE SAID ONCE AGAIN NOT JUST ON 

05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:14.223
JANUARY SIX AND IMMEDIATE THE 
AFTER BUT ALSO EARLIER THIS WEEK

05:12:14.478 --> 05:12:19.410
IS TRUE, THAT HE TOLD THE 
PRESIDENT THAT MIKE PENCE HAD 

05:12:19.958 --> 05:12:25.544
JUST BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE 
SENATE CHAMBER AND THAT HE 

05:12:25.700 --> 05:12:27.970
COULDN'T TALK BECAUSE HE HAD TO 
GO BECAUSE HE WAS BEING 

05:12:28.250 --> 05:12:31.338
EVACUATED AND THAT PHONE CALL 
CAME AS THE MOB WAS BREACHING 

05:12:31.709 --> 05:12:33.709
THE SENATE CHAMBER AND HE WAS 
TELLING HIS PEOPLE NOT TO BACK 

05:12:33.891 --> 05:12:35.891
DOWN.

05:12:37.523 --> 05:12:40.170
IT IS OBVIOUSLY PRETTY CLEAR 
FROM THE PRESENTATION WE HEARD 

05:12:40.560 --> 05:12:44.121
THAT OF COURSE HE DID NO. THE 
QUESTION IS WHEN EXACTLY HE 

05:12:44.700 --> 05:12:48.560
DIDN'T FIND OUT FROM TELEVISION 
BUT DID HE FIND OUT FROM 

05:12:48.760 --> 05:12:50.760
TUBERVILLE OR THE SECRET SERVICE
OR SOMEONE ELSE BUT THERE'S 

05:12:50.840 --> 05:12:52.940
REALLY NO DISPUTING THAT TRUMP 
OF COURSE NEW THAT THE CAPITAL 

05:12:53.142 --> 05:12:56.900
WAS UNDER SIEGE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLEMAN JOINING US 

05:12:57.120 --> 05:12:59.120
FROM 

05:13:02.140 --> 05:13:05.262
CAPITOL HILL. ABOUT THE TIMING 
OF THE PHONE CALL VERSUS TRUMP 

05:13:05.461 --> 05:13:07.461
STREET ATTACKING 

05:13:10.680 --> 05:13:14.150
MIKE PENCE BUT, YOU KNOW, AS 
JAMES WAS TALKING ABOUT, 

05:13:14.410 --> 05:13:16.410
REGARDLESS OF THE PRECISE ORDER 
WHICH OF COURSE IS STILL 

05:13:16.480 --> 05:13:19.781
IMPORTANT BUT REGARDLESS OF THE 
PRECISE ORDER AS THE ATTACK WAS 

05:13:19.973 --> 05:13:22.380
STILL GOING ON, TRUMP DID NOT DO
ANYTHING TO TRY TO PROTECT PENCE

05:13:22.580 --> 05:13:25.177
OR CALM THE MOB THAT WAS REALLY 
WISHING LISTENING TO HIM IN 

05:13:29.080 --> 05:13:34.017
THAT MOMENT?  THAT'S RIGHT. IF 
YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE STORY 

05:13:34.220 --> 05:13:36.320
YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE 
TIMELINE OF TRUMP'S TWEETS AS 

05:13:36.520 --> 05:13:40.920
WELL THAT HE DID POST A 
DISPARAGING TWEET AGAINST MIKE 

05:13:41.142 --> 05:13:43.142
PENCE WHILE THE RIDE WAS 

05:13:45.716 --> 05:13:48.220
GOING ON AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW 
THERE WAS THAT LONG LAPSE 

05:13:48.450 --> 05:13:50.850
BETWEEN THE MOMENT WHEN THE 
WRITERS GOT INTO THE CAPITAL AND

05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:53.883
UNTIL HE'S PUT OUT A VIDEO, SO, 
TELLING PEOPLE TO GO HOME BUT 

05:13:54.660 --> 05:13:57.957
ALSO SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED THE
ELECTION WAS STOLEN, ALL-IN-ONE 

05:13:58.160 --> 05:14:04.460
VIDEO. SO EVEN IF YOU WANT TO, 
YOU KNOW, GO WITH MIKE LEE WHO 

05:14:04.681 --> 05:14:07.562
SEEMS FAIRLY FRUSTRATED EVERY 
TIME THIS STORY IS BROUGHT UP, 

05:14:07.777 --> 05:14:09.777
THERE ARE OTHER INDICATIONS THAT
HE 

05:14:14.660 --> 05:14:16.660
WAS ABSENT.

05:14:22.820 --> 05:14:25.341
HE WASN'T WILLING TO HELP WHEN 
HE SAW THERE WAS DANGER SO YOU 

05:14:25.541 --> 05:14:27.541
DO HAVE MULTIPLE EVIDENCE 
SHOWING THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

05:14:27.613 --> 05:14:29.613
CHECKED OUT DURING THE TIMES 
THAT THE RIGHT 

05:14:34.140 --> 05:14:37.070
WAS ONGOING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO HANNAH JEWELL WHO

05:14:37.273 --> 05:14:39.273
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS TODAY. HANNAH, WHAT IS

05:14:39.359 --> 05:14:41.359
STANDING OUT TO YOU IN THE 
PASSIONATE CLOSING 

05:14:45.831 --> 05:14:48.760
ARGUMENT? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE LAID OUT THE ARGUMENT THAT

05:14:48.980 --> 05:14:53.313
NOT ONLY DID TRUMP INSIGHT BI IT
BUT HE REVELED IN IT IN HIS 

05:14:54.028 --> 05:15:01.693
WORDS AND MY EARS ALSO PERKED UP
WHEN WE HEARD AGAINST AGAIN THE 

05:15:01.937 --> 05:15:05.144
PHRASE CANCEL CULTURE TALKING 
ABOUT THE DEFENSES EARLIER THIS 

05:15:05.297 --> 05:15:07.243
WEEK CALLING THE IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL CONSTITUTIONAL CANCEL 

05:15:07.244 --> 05:15:10.140
CULTURE. HE TURNED THAT AROUND 
ONTO THE REPUBLICANS SAYING THAT

05:15:10.370 --> 05:15:13.244
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO TRIED AND
FAILED TO CANCEL LIZ CHENEY 

05:15:13.481 --> 05:15:15.481
BECAUSE SHE VOTED FOR 
IMPEACHMENT AND THOSE WHO HAVE 

05:15:15.612 --> 05:15:18.190
BEEN LISTENING TO THE BROADCAST 
ALL WEEK FIRST OF ALL, THANK 

05:15:18.550 --> 05:15:23.381
YOU, WELCOME. BUT YOU MAY HAVE 
HEARD ME EXPLAIN THE ORIGINS OF 

05:15:23.740 --> 05:15:30.519
THIS TERM AND HOW STRANGE IT IS 
THAT A PHRASE THAT 

05:15:31.371 --> 05:15:35.164
INTERNET SPEAK AND ACTIVISM THAT
POP CULTURE HAS ENDED UP ON THE 

05:15:35.409 --> 05:15:37.905
UNITED STATES SENATE IN AN 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AND IT HAS 

05:15:38.870 --> 05:15:42.470
REALLY BEEN CO-OPTED TO PAIN 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACTIVISM AND 

05:15:42.700 --> 05:15:47.601
FREE SPEECH ITSELF AS SOMETHING 
SINISTER, SO, RASKIN APPEARED TO

05:15:48.254 --> 05:15:53.120
BE USING THIS PHRASE AND YOU 
KNOW, IN A SOMEWHAT CHEEKY AND 

05:15:53.331 --> 05:15:57.046
KNOWING MANNER TO SAY THINGS 
THAT REPUBLICANS RECUSED US OF, 

05:15:57.323 --> 05:15:59.911
THEY ALSO DO THAT TO THEIR OWN 
BUT I HAVE TO WORRY IF USING IT 

05:16:00.113 --> 05:16:01.756
IN THIS WAY FURTHER ENTRENCHES 
THIS VERY TIRED AND AND FRANKLY 

05:16:01.757 --> 05:16:03.757
SOME WAYS DANGEROUS CULTURE AND 
IT IS ALREADY SO STEEP TO THESE 

05:16:07.251 --> 05:16:09.251
TERMS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

05:16:14.580 --> 05:16:18.554
:, LET'S CIRCLE BACK TO 
WITNESSES AND THE FRANKLY 

05:16:18.755 --> 05:16:20.755
ASTOUNDING DECISION BY DEMOCRATS
TO 

05:16:23.960 --> 05:16:25.960
MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT WITNESSES 
EVEN THOUGH, FOR A MOMENT, THEY 

05:16:26.835 --> 05:16:29.840
WERE ABLE TO GET A HANDFUL OF 
REPUBLICANS ON BOARD AND CALLING

05:16:30.037 --> 05:16:32.037
FOR AT LEAST POTENTIALLY ONE 
COME 

05:16:36.160 --> 05:16:38.320
AROUND A. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT. THEY HAD AN OPEN DOOR 

05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:41.014
TO POTENTIALLY CALLING WITNESSES
INTO THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, 

05:16:41.404 --> 05:16:44.970
THAT IS WHAT SOLVES THE 
PROCEEDINGS IN THE LAST FEW 

05:16:45.326 --> 05:16:47.099
HOURS, BUT THEY APPARENTLY 
BROKERED A DEAL WHERE THEY 

05:16:47.100 --> 05:16:49.100
DECIDED TO JUST ADD 

05:16:51.423 --> 05:16:55.020
THE STATEMENT INTO THE EVIDENCE 
INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY BRINGING HER

05:16:55.222 --> 05:16:57.698
IN BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, THEY HAVE 
THE VOTES, THEY DID VOTE AND 

05:16:57.898 --> 05:16:59.898
APPROVED THE 

05:17:01.241 --> 05:17:03.554
IDEA OF A SUBPOENA OF AWARENESS 
INTO THIS TRIAL. SO THERE WAS 

05:17:03.755 --> 05:17:05.755
THE BOX HAD 

05:17:07.303 --> 05:17:09.361
BEEN OPEN TO POSSIBILITIES WERE 
THERE. I THINK THIS COULD POINT 

05:17:09.562 --> 05:17:11.642
OUT I'M 

05:17:16.660 --> 05:17:21.644
SURE THIS POINTS TO SOMEONE OF 
THE URGENCY THAT MEMBERS OF THE 

05:17:21.843 --> 05:17:24.360
SENATE DO WANT TO APPLY HERE, 
THAT THEY WANT TO MOVE ON AND 

05:17:24.580 --> 05:17:27.021
THAT WAS THE PLAN. WE EVEN HAD 
REPORTED THAT DEMOCRATS HAD AN 

05:17:27.179 --> 05:17:30.229
EARLY CALL WHERE THEY HAD NO 
INDICATION THAT THEY HAD THAT 

05:17:30.560 --> 05:17:32.560
PAUSE TO CONSIDER THAT 

05:17:36.720 --> 05:17:39.849
SERIOUSLY. EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE MAY BE WRAPPED UP BY 

05:17:40.751 --> 05:17:43.303
NOW BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT 
HAPPENED SO THE DEMOCRATS 

05:17:43.550 --> 05:17:45.550
DECIDED TO BROKER THAT DEAL WITH
THE DEFENSE 

05:17:47.956 --> 05:17:50.310
LAWYERS AND IN SAYING THAT THEY 
WOULD ONLY ADD TESTIMONY AS A 

05:17:50.461 --> 05:17:52.461
PART OF THE EVIDENCE THE 
STATEMENT THAT THEY PUT OUT 

05:17:52.581 --> 05:17:54.670
THERE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY 
QUESTIONING THEM UNDER 

05:17:58.380 --> 05:18:00.054
OATH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO YOU FOR THE 

05:18:00.055 --> 05:18:02.055
POSSIBILITY OF WITNESSES THAT 
HAS NOW BEEN CLOSED. THE DOOR 

05:18:02.220 --> 05:18:05.665
WAS KICKED OPEN, THE DOOR HAS 
BEEN SHUT. WHAT REASONING DO 

05:18:05.864 --> 05:18:09.837
DEMOCRATS HAVE FOR MOVING 
FORWARD WITHOUT TRYING TO CALL A

05:18:10.254 --> 05:18:14.611
WITNESS? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY DON'T WANT TO COME UP 

05:18:15.369 --> 05:18:21.955
HIS AGENDA. THEY REALLY JUST 
WANT TO MOVE ON. THEY FEEL LIKE 

05:18:22.116 --> 05:18:24.033
THE FACTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED 
THAT IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT 

05:18:24.034 --> 05:18:28.784
TRUMP DIDN'T SEND HELP AFTER HE 
WAS ASKED TO. THAT THERE'S 

05:18:28.989 --> 05:18:31.301
REALLY NOT FACTS AND DISPUTE AND
THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO 

05:18:31.503 --> 05:18:35.696
DRAG THIS OUT FOR WEEKS OR EVEN 
MONTHS DURING THIS CRITICAL 

05:18:35.896 --> 05:18:37.896
PERIOD AND THE ECONOMY IS 
REELING IN 

05:18:42.181 --> 05:18:46.054
A RECESSION. DEMOCRATS THINK 
THAT THEY ARE FOCUSING ON WHAT 

05:18:46.261 --> 05:18:49.880
VOTERS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT, BUT,
THERE IS GOING TO BE TENSION AND

05:18:50.081 --> 05:18:52.563
FALLOUT FROM THIS. CHUCK 
SCHUMER, THE DEMOCRATIC 

05:18:56.290 --> 05:18:59.040
MAJORITY LEADER IS FACING A 
POTENTIAL PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN 

05:18:59.242 --> 05:19:02.530
2022. IT IS UNCLEAR FROM WHO BUT
SOMEONE ON THE LEFT IS LUCKY TO 

05:19:03.372 --> 05:19:07.141
PRIMARY HIM IN NEW YORK BUT IT 
WAS TOO QUICK TO CUT A DEAL, TO 

05:19:09.220 --> 05:19:13.420
MOVE ON AND TO GET THIS BEHIND 
EVERYONE SO THIS IS SOMETHING 

05:19:13.640 --> 05:19:16.141
THAT WILL BE RE-LITIGATED 
CERTAINLY NOT IN A FORMAL WAY, 

05:19:16.354 --> 05:19:20.400
BUT THE DEMOCRATS WILL ARGUE 
ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS THE RIGHT 

05:19:20.704 --> 05:19:24.302
THING TO DO, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY 
NOT HAVE HAD ANY SORT OF IMPACT 

05:19:24.502 --> 05:19:27.120
ON THE OUTCOME EVEN AS A DRAG 
THIS PROCESS 

05:19:31.019 --> 05:19:32.528
OUT LONGER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, JAMES, THE CONVERSATION 

05:19:32.529 --> 05:19:37.239
RIGHT NOW IS DEMOCRATS VERSUS 
DEMOCRATS. DID THEY CAVE OR DID 

05:19:37.440 --> 05:19:39.466
THEY NOT CAVE? IT HAS TOTALLY 
TURNED AWAY FROM 

05:19:44.108 --> 05:19:46.108
THE REPUBLICANS

05:19:48.719 --> 05:19:53.175
. THE PHRASING IS DID THEY CAVE,
DID THEY NOT CAVE? LET'S TALK 

05:19:53.482 --> 05:19:55.482
ABOUT WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN 
PROVIDED BY PERSONAL TESTIMONY 

05:19:55.584 --> 05:19:59.887
BY CONGRESS WOMAN HERRERA BUTLER
THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT OR NOT 

05:20:00.095 --> 05:20:01.632
DIFFERENT FROM HER WRITTEN 
STATEMENT. 

05:20:01.633 --> 05:20:05.213
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS PART OF THE ISSUE 
THAT THIS IS CONVERSATION THAT 

05:20:05.413 --> 05:20:12.898
SHE HEARD ABOUT FROM McCARTHY. 
SO IT IS SECONDHAND. SO, PART OF

05:20:13.118 --> 05:20:17.118
IT IS THEY COULD'VE GOTTEN 
HERRERA BUTLER TO TESTIFY BUT 

05:20:17.279 --> 05:20:19.279
SHE STILL WOULD'VE BEEN 
RECOUNTING WHAT McCARTHY 

05:20:23.498 --> 05:20:26.824
SAID AND IT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED. SO, YOU COULD FIGHT TO

05:20:27.043 --> 05:20:30.697
HAVE HER APPEAR AND THEN 
REPUBLICANS WOULD DEMAND SOME OF

05:20:30.841 --> 05:20:32.841
THEIR OWN WITNESSES AND THAT 
COULD END UP 

05:20:36.677 --> 05:20:38.957
ADDING TIME. IT STILL APPEARED 
THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT MIKE 

05:20:39.139 --> 05:20:41.139
PENCE WOULD BE SORT OF THE STAR 
WITNESS FOR IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

05:20:41.298 --> 05:20:43.298
WASN'T WILLING 

05:20:45.438 --> 05:20:47.520
TO TESTIFY THAT HE IS NOT 
BREAKING RANKS WITH TRUMP EVEN 

05:20:47.722 --> 05:20:50.657
IF HE PRIVATELY IS STILL ANGRY 
AT HIS FORMER RUNNING MATE AND 

05:20:52.957 --> 05:20:54.957
FEELS THAT TRUMP'S 

05:20:56.886 --> 05:20:58.576
LAWYERS MISREPRESENTED THE 
NATURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND

05:20:58.577 --> 05:21:03.206
THE NATURE OF THE PRESIDENTS 
CONCERN FOR PENCE ON 

05:21:07.357 --> 05:21:10.796
JANUARY SIX. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL RIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE WE 

05:21:11.046 --> 05:21:15.669
MAY BE SEEING PEOPLE TAKE THEIR 
SEATS. A REMINDER THAT MIKE LEE,

05:21:16.008 --> 05:21:20.216
THE SENATOR HAS OBJECTED TO THE 
USE OF HIS NAME IN THIS 

05:21:20.596 --> 05:21:26.337
PROCEEDING AND SO THEY WENT INTO
A QUORUM TO SORT THIS OUT. LET'S

05:21:26.643 --> 05:21:30.078
GO BACK NOW TO THE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT I ASK UNITED 

05:21:30.256 --> 05:21:31.819
UNANIMOUS DISPENSE THAT IT BE 
ORDERED WITH. 

05:21:31.820 --> 05:21:34.878
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM UTAH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WITHDRAW MY APPEAL. 

05:21:34.879 --> 05:21:38.775
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITHDRAWN. THE CHAIR WOULD 
ADVISE EVERYBODY, THE 

05:21:39.115 --> 05:21:45.338
EVIDENTIARY RECORD IS CLOSED, AS
FOR US 

05:21:49.219 --> 05:21:52.735
THOSE THINGS NOT ADMITTED TO 
EVIDENCE AS THOSE REFERENCED IN 

05:21:52.925 --> 05:21:56.314
TRIAL. NEW EVIDENCE IS NOT 
PERMITTED IN CLOSING ARGUMENT. 

05:21:56.975 --> 05:21:59.397
REFERENCES TO SUCH NEW EVIDENCE 
WILL 

05:22:02.835 --> 05:22:04.835
BE STRICKEN.

05:22:15.294 --> 05:22:18.995
THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE THE 
FLOOR IF THEY WISH 

05:22:23.435 --> 05:22:29.220
TO RESUME. HOUSE MANAGERS? 

05:22:46.153 --> 05:22:47.804
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOUSE MANAGER. 

05:22:47.805 --> 05:22:51.381
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ESTEEM SENATORS, GOOD 
AFTERNOON. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR 

05:22:51.634 --> 05:22:54.080
YOUR KIND ATTENTION THIS WEEK AS
WE ENGAGED IN A PROCESS 

05:22:54.714 --> 05:22:59.781
FORMULATED AND PUT TO PAPER BY 
THE FOUNDERS IN MY HOME CITY OF 

05:22:59.938 --> 05:23:03.825
PHILADELPHIA, WHICH IS GETTING 
ITS FAIR SHARE OF ATTENTION THIS

05:23:04.562 --> 05:23:09.126
WEEK. IN 1787, 234 YEARS 

05:23:12.104 --> 05:23:16.231
IMPORTANCE OF THE PRESIDENTS 
DERELICTION OF DUTY. I WILL 

05:23:16.400 --> 05:23:22.436
FOCUS ON THREE SPECIFIC ASPECTS 
OF THIS CASE FIRST, THE DEFENSE 

05:23:22.937 --> 05:23:26.047
SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS JUST ONE 
SPEECH AND ONE SPEECH CANNOT 

05:23:27.182 --> 05:23:29.182
INCITE INSURRECTION. AND THE 
DEFENSE SUGGESTED BECAUSE THE 

05:23:29.264 --> 05:23:34.395
ATTACK WAS PREPLANNED BY SOME 
INSURRECTIONIST DONALD TRUMP IS 

05:23:34.692 --> 05:23:36.692
SOMEHOW 

05:23:39.231 --> 05:23:45.654
NOT CULPABLE. NOR ARE THEY WHAT 
WE ALLEGES, SO, LET'S BE CLEAR. 

05:23:45.871 --> 05:23:47.871
WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT 

05:23:50.789 --> 05:23:54.623
DONALD TRUMP'S JANUARY SIX 
SPEECH BY ITSELF INSIDE OF THE 

05:23:54.776 --> 05:23:57.571
ATTACK. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT HIS 
COURSE OF CONDUCT LEADING UP TO 

05:23:57.861 --> 05:23:59.873
AND INCLUDING THAT SPEECH IN 
SIDE OF 

05:24:03.321 --> 05:24:05.321
THE ATTACK.

05:24:21.640 --> 05:24:25.632
HIS BIG LIE, THE ONLY WAY HE 
COULD LOSE WAS IF THE WAS 

05:24:26.106 --> 05:24:29.797
RIGGED. TWO, THAT TO ENSURE THE 
ELECTION WOULD NOT BE STOLEN, TO

05:24:29.938 --> 05:24:32.248
PREVENT THE FRAUD THEY HAD TO 
STOP THE STEAL AND THREE, THEY 

05:24:32.462 --> 05:24:35.547
HAD TO FIGHT TO STOP  THE STEAL 
OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A COUNTRY

05:24:35.752 --> 05:24:40.776
ANYMORE. THIS CONDUCT TOOK TIME 
AND IT CULMINATED AND 

05:24:44.789 --> 05:24:47.187
DONALD TRUMP SENDING A SAVE THE 
DATE ON DECEMBER 19th, 18 DAYS 

05:24:47.361 --> 05:24:50.410
BEFORE THE ATTACK IN TELLING HIS
BASE EXACTLY WHEN, WHERE AND WHO

05:24:54.350 --> 05:24:57.853
TO FIGHT. AND WHILE HE WAS DOING
THIS, HE SPENT $50 MILLION FROM 

05:24:58.014 --> 05:25:01.830
HIS LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO 
SIMULTANEOUSLY BROADCAST HIS 

05:25:02.049 --> 05:25:04.522
MESSAGE TO STOP THE STEAL  OVER 
ALL 

05:25:08.291 --> 05:25:11.086
MAJOR NETWORKS. DONALD TRUMP 
INVITED THEM, HE INCITED THEM, 

05:25:11.345 --> 05:25:15.843
THEN HE DIRECTED THEM. HERE ARE 
A FEW CLIPS THAT WILL HELP BRING

05:25:15.996 --> 05:25:18.610
THAT STORY TO LIGHT.

05:25:26.488 --> 05:25:28.729
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CAN YOU GIVE A DIRECT ANSWER 
YOU WILL ACCEPT THE ELECTION? 

05:25:28.951 --> 05:25:31.712
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE TO SEE. KNOW I'M NOT 
GOING TO JUST SAY YES, THIS 

05:25:31.912 --> 05:25:33.997
ELECTION WILL BE THE MOST RIGGED
ELECTION IN HISTORY. THIS IS 

05:25:34.210 --> 05:25:36.086
GOING TO BE THE GREATEST 
ELECTION DISASTER IN HISTORY. 

05:25:36.087 --> 05:25:38.827
THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN TAKE THIS 
ELECTION AWAY FROM US IS IF THIS

05:25:39.027 --> 05:25:41.027
IS A 

05:25:43.449 --> 05:25:45.530
RIGGED ELECTION. IS A RIGGED 
ELECTION. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY 

05:25:45.749 --> 05:25:50.279
WE ARE GOING TO LOSE. WE WILL 
HAVE 

05:25:54.149 --> 05:25:56.789
A VERY PEACEFUL -- THERE WON'T 
BE A TRANSFER FRANKLY, THERE 

05:25:56.929 --> 05:26:00.129
WILL BE A CONTINUATION. THAT IS 
THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO 

05:26:00.339 --> 05:26:02.339
LOSE IS IF 

05:26:04.779 --> 05:26:07.490
THIS MISCHIEF AND IT WILL HAVE 
TO BE ON A BIG SCALE, SO, BE 

05:26:07.704 --> 05:26:09.904
CAREFUL. BUT THIS WILL BE ONE OF
THE GREATEST MOST FRAUDULENT 

05:26:14.379 --> 05:26:18.070
ELECTIONS EVER. WE ARE NOT GOING
TO LET THIS ELECTION BE TAKEN 

05:26:18.379 --> 05:26:23.059
AWAY FROM US. THAT IS THE ONLY 
WAY THEY ARE GOING TO WIN IT. 

05:26:23.424 --> 05:26:27.683
THIS IS A FRAUD ON THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC. THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT

05:26:28.089 --> 05:26:31.934
TO OUR COUNTRY. WE WERE GETTING 
READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION. 

05:26:32.248 --> 05:26:35.883
FRANKLY, WE DID WIN THIS 
ELECTION. WE WERE WINNING AND 

05:26:36.267 --> 05:26:40.909
ALL THE KEY LOCATIONS BY A LOT 
ACTUALLY AND THEN OUR NUMBERS 

05:26:41.311 --> 05:26:44.972
STARTED MIRACULOUSLY GETTING 
WHITTLED AWAY AND THIS IS A CASE

05:26:45.189 --> 05:26:48.892
WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL 
AN ELECTION. THEY ARE TRYING TO 

05:26:49.129 --> 05:26:52.401
RIGGED ELECTION AND WE CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN. YOU CAN'T LET 

05:26:52.963 --> 05:26:55.399
ANOTHER PERSON STEAL THAT 
ELECTION FROM YOU. ALL OVER THE 

05:26:55.559 --> 05:27:02.808
COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE TOGETHER IN 
HOLDING UP SIGNS,  STOP THE 

05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:04.948
STEAL. IF WE DON'T ROOT OUT THE 
FRAUD, THE TREMENDOUS AND 

05:27:05.192 --> 05:27:07.192
HORRIBLE FRAUD  THAT HAS TAKEN 
PLACE IN OUR 2020 ELECTION, WE 

05:27:07.202 --> 05:27:10.629
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE. WE
CANNOT ALLOW A COMPLETELY 

05:27:11.412 --> 05:27:13.412
FRAUDULENT ELECTION 

05:27:16.633 --> 05:27:21.399
TO STAND. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT 
LIKE HELL. I CAN TELL YOU. IF 

05:27:21.549 --> 05:27:25.028
YOU DON'T FIGHT  FOR YOUR 
COUNTRY FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE,

05:27:25.422 --> 05:27:27.704
YOU WILL NOT HAVE A COUNTRY 
LEFT. WE 

05:27:31.289 --> 05:27:33.600
WILL NOT BEND, WE WILL NOT 
BREAK, WE WILL NOT YIELD, WE 

05:27:33.800 --> 05:27:36.138
WILL NEVER GIVE IN, WE WILL 
NEVER GIVE UP, WE WILL NEVER 

05:27:36.338 --> 05:27:38.629
BACK DOWN, WE WILL NEVER, EVER 
SURRENDER. ALL OF US HERE TODAY 

05:27:38.878 --> 05:27:42.351
DO NOT WANT TO SEE OUR ELECTION 
VICTORY STOLEN. WE WILL NEVER 

05:27:42.904 --> 05:27:46.940
GIVE UP, WE WILL NEVER CONCEDE. 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. YOU DON'T 

05:27:48.338 --> 05:27:51.196
CONCEDE WHEN THERE IS THEFT 
INVOLVED. AND TO USE A FAVORITE 

05:27:51.395 --> 05:27:53.970
TERM THAT ALL OF YOU PEOPLE 
REALLY CAME UP WITH, 

05:27:57.509 --> 05:27:59.825
WE WILL STOP THE STEAL BECAUSE 
YOU WILL NEVER TAKE BACK OUR 

05:28:00.025 --> 05:28:04.998
COUNTRY WITH WEAKNESS.  YOU HAVE
TO SHOW STRENGTH THEN YOU HAVE 

05:28:05.332 --> 05:28:08.578
TO BE STRONG. MAKE NO MISTAKE, 
THIS ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM 

05:28:08.778 --> 05:28:14.308
YOU, FROM ME, FROM THE COUNTRY. 
AND WE FIGHT. WE FIGHT LIKE HELL

05:28:14.725 --> 05:28:18.888
AND IF YOU DON'T FIGHT LIKE  
HELL, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE 

05:28:19.471 --> 05:28:23.477
A COUNTRY ANYMORE.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR POINT IS THIS. THIS WAS 

05:28:23.630 --> 05:28:25.277
NOT ONE SPEECH. THIS WAS A 
DELIBERATE, PURPOSEFUL EFFORT BY

05:28:25.278 --> 05:28:30.847
DONALD TRUMP OVER MANY MONTHS, 
THAT RESULTED IN THE WELL 

05:28:31.376 --> 05:28:34.758
ORGANIZED MOBS ATTACK ON JANUARY
THE SIXTH. THAT BRINGS ME TO MY 

05:28:34.977 --> 05:28:36.977
SECOND POINT. 

05:28:38.286 --> 05:28:40.451
THE VIOLENCE. DEFENSE COUNSEL 
ARGUES THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT

05:28:40.827 --> 05:28:48.164
DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE KNOWN 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. YET, WE ARE 

05:28:48.785 --> 05:28:53.291
NOT SUBJECTING, NOR IS IT 
NECESSARY FOR US TO PROVE THAT 

05:28:53.503 --> 05:28:58.727
DONALD TRUMP KNEW EVERY DETAIL 
OF WHAT WOULD UNFOLD ON JANUARY 

05:28:58.997 --> 05:29:01.980
SIXTH OR EVEN HOW HORRIBLE AND 
DEADLY THE ATTACK WOULD BECOME. 

05:29:02.177 --> 05:29:04.527
BUT, HE DID KNOW. AS HE LOOKED 
OUT ON THAT FEE OF THOUSANDS IN 

05:29:04.670 --> 05:29:06.286
FRONT OF THEM, SOME WEARING BODY
ARMOR AND HELMETS, OTHERS 

05:29:06.287 --> 05:29:08.287
CARRYING WEAPONS, THAT THE 
RESULT WOULD 

05:29:12.367 --> 05:29:14.498
BE VIOLENCE. THE EVIDENCE 
OVERWHELMINGLY 

05:29:19.349 --> 05:29:21.349
DEMONSTRATES THIS.

05:29:24.435 --> 05:29:27.012
A FEW POINTS ON THIS. DONALD 
TRUMP KNEW THE PEOPLE HE WAS IN 

05:29:27.187 --> 05:29:32.147
THE SIDING, LEADING UP TO 
JANUARY SIX. HE SAW THE VIOLENCE

05:29:32.367 --> 05:29:34.790
THEY WERE CAPABLE OF. HE HAD A 
PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF PRAISING

05:29:39.707 --> 05:29:43.567
AND SUPPORTING VIOLENCE, NEVER 
CONDEMNING IT. IT IS NOT A 

05:29:43.786 --> 05:29:45.656
COINCIDENCE THAT THOSE SAME 
PEOPLE, THE PROUD BOYS, THE 

05:29:45.657 --> 05:29:47.657
ORGANIZER OF THE TRUMP CARAVAN, 
THE SUPPORTERS AND SPEAKERS AT 

05:29:47.727 --> 05:29:52.577
THE SECOND MILLION MARCH ALL 
SHOWED UP ON JANUARY SIX. AND 

05:29:52.777 --> 05:29:54.777
DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR 

05:29:58.207 --> 05:30:02.147
WAS DIFFERENT. THIS WAS MONTHS 
OF CULTIVATING A BASE OF PEOPLE 

05:30:02.367 --> 05:30:05.567
WHO WERE VIOLENT, PRAISING THAT 
VIOLENCE AND THEN 

05:30:08.904 --> 05:30:10.771
LEADING THEM, LEADING THAT 
VIOLENCE, THAT RAGE STRAIGHT TO 

05:30:10.772 --> 05:30:13.054
A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS 
WHERE HE KNEW HIS VICE PRESIDENT

05:30:15.586 --> 05:30:18.787
WAS RESIDING. AND DONALD TRUMP 
HAD WARNINGS ABOUT THE CROWD ON 

05:30:21.903 --> 05:30:23.903
JANUARY SIX. THERE WERE DETAILED
POSTS ONLINE ABOUT 

05:30:28.447 --> 05:30:30.447
ATTACK PLANS.

05:30:32.786 --> 05:30:35.070
THERE WERE CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT
MANY WOULD BE ARMED AND READY TO

05:30:35.267 --> 05:30:38.366
ATTACK THE CAPITAL. DESPITE 
THESE CREDIBLE WARNINGS OF 

05:30:38.586 --> 05:30:42.201
SERIOUS DANGEROUS THREATS TO OUR
CAPITAL, WHEN THE CROWD WAS 

05:30:42.402 --> 05:30:44.681
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE 
PRESIDENT, READY TO TAKE ORDERS 

05:30:45.287 --> 05:30:47.846
AND ATTACK, HE SAID WE ARE GOING
TO 

05:30:52.766 --> 05:30:55.266
THE CAPITAL AND WE FIGHT. WE 
FIGHT LIKE HELL AND IF YOU DON'T

05:30:55.486 --> 05:30:57.777
FIGHT LIKE HELL, YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE.

05:30:58.216 --> 05:31:00.216
IS A 

05:31:03.438 --> 05:31:05.438
SHORT CLIP.

05:32:03.377 --> 05:32:07.316
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY THE 
GOP. [ APPLAUSE 

05:32:10.906 --> 05:32:14.666
] 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DESTROY THE GOP, DESTROY THE 

05:32:15.006 --> 05:32:16.695
GOP. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER TAKE 

05:32:16.696 --> 05:32:20.436
BACK OUR COUNTRY WITH WEAKNESS. 
YOU HAVE TO SHOW STRENGTH THEN 

05:32:20.586 --> 05:32:22.586
YOU HAVE TO 

05:32:25.286 --> 05:32:27.286
BE STRONG.

05:32:31.026 --> 05:32:35.367
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS, THE VIOLENCE ON 
JANUARY SIX WAS DEMONSTRABLY 

05:32:35.568 --> 05:32:39.566
FORESEEABLE. TRUMP EVEN SAID SO 
HIMSELF AT 6:01 P.M. THE DAY OF 

05:32:40.006 --> 05:32:44.328
THE ATTACK, THE LAST THING HE 
SAID BEFORE HE WENT TO SLEEP, 

05:32:44.540 --> 05:32:46.540
QUOTE, THESE ARE THE THINGS 

05:32:50.386 --> 05:32:52.386
THAT HAPPEN.

05:32:56.828 --> 05:32:58.745
THAT BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL 
POINT, THE INSURRECTIONIST, 

05:32:58.746 --> 05:33:01.266
DEFENSE COUNSEL HAS SUGGESTED 
THESE PEOPLE COME HERE ON THEIR 

05:33:01.516 --> 05:33:05.042
OWN. THE DEFENSE BRIEF STATES 
THAT THE INSURRECTION DID SO FOR

05:33:05.246 --> 05:33:09.345
THEIR OWN ACCORD AND FOR THEIR 
OWN REASONS AND ARE BRIE BEING 

05:33:09.566 --> 05:33:13.606
CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. IT IS 
TRUE THAT ON SOME INSURRECTION 

05:33:14.136 --> 05:33:20.713
IS ARE BEING PROSECUTED BUT IT 
IS NOT 

05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:27.866
THAT THEY DID 

05:33:37.786 --> 05:33:42.810
ACCORD AND FOR THEIR 

05:33:50.035 --> 05:33:57.876
THE OF THE ENTRANCE 

05:34:03.169 --> 05:34:09.416
MAKES CLEAR THE EXACT OPPOSITE 
THAT 

05:34:15.276 --> 05:34:24.196
FOR DONALD TRUMP AT HIS 
INVITATION, AT HIS DIRECTION, 

05:34:26.553 --> 05:34:32.665
AT HIS COMMAND. THEY SAID 

05:34:39.226 --> 05:34:45.885
BEFORE THE ATTACK, DURING THE 
ATTACK, THEY SAID 

05:34:50.635 --> 05:35:00.359
THE ATTACK, LEADING UP TO 
JANUARY SIX 

05:35:03.866 --> 05:35:08.289
IN POST AFTER 

05:35:18.819 --> 05:35:20.819
SUPPORTERS 

05:35:21.956 --> 05:35:27.266
CONFIRMED THIS WAS 

05:35:31.804 --> 05:35:36.886
FOR DONALD TRUMP. 

05:35:39.886 --> 05:35:41.886
IT 

05:35:45.235 --> 05:35:53.355
WAS AT HIS DIRECTION. 

05:35:58.464 --> 05:36:01.076
ONE SUPPORTER 

05:36:10.665 --> 05:36:19.515
HIM AND I QUOTE, IF CONGRESS 

05:36:23.005 --> 05:36:29.826
ILLEGALLY CERTIFIES BIDEN, TRUMP
WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY 

05:36:34.606 --> 05:36:37.465
BUT TO DEMAND 

05:36:48.276 --> 05:36:52.095
CAPITAL. AND KILL/BEAT 

05:37:01.915 --> 05:37:10.716
FOR IT. THEY EVEN SAY PUBLICLY, 

05:37:13.249 --> 05:37:19.825
AND PROUDLY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD HELP 

05:37:24.252 --> 05:37:26.640
NATIONAL GUARD, SO, ALL THEY 
HAVE TO DO IS OVERWHELM 2000 

05:37:26.907 --> 05:37:30.071
CAPITAL POLICE OFFICERS. DURING 
HIS SPEECH ON JANUARY SIX, TRUMP

05:37:30.205 --> 05:37:31.674
SUPPORTERS CHANTED HIS WORDS 
BACK TO HIM, THEY EVEN LIVE 

05:37:31.675 --> 05:37:33.004
TREATED HIS COMMANDS, DURING THE
ATTACK, THE INSURRECTIONIST THAT

05:37:33.005 --> 05:37:34.414
THE CAPITAL CHANTED DONALD 
TRUMP'S WORDS FROM HIS TWEETS, 

05:37:34.415 --> 05:37:36.145
RALLIES AND FROM THE SPEECH ON 
THE SIXTH. THEY HELD SIGNS THAT 

05:37:36.146 --> 05:37:37.718
SAID ENCHANTED FIGHT FOR TRUMP, 
STOP THE STEAL.  THEY AMPLIFY 

05:37:37.719 --> 05:37:38.854
HIS DEMANDS, ANOTHER WRITER 
WHILE LIVE STREAMING THE 

05:37:38.855 --> 05:37:40.282
INSURRECTION FROM THE CAPITAL 
SAID, QUOTE, HE WILL BE HAPPY, 

05:37:40.283 --> 05:37:41.718
WE ARE FIGHTING FOR TRUMP. IS 
MORE THE INSURRECTIONIST WERE 

05:37:41.719 --> 05:37:43.144
NOT HIDING, THEY BELIEVE THEY 
WERE FOLLOWING THE ORDERS FROM 

05:37:43.145 --> 05:37:44.294
OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THEY 
FELT SECURE ENOUGH IN THE 

05:37:44.295 --> 05:37:45.988
LEGITIMACY OF THEIR ACTIONS TO 
TAKE SELFIES, TO POST PHOTOS AND

05:37:45.989 --> 05:37:47.404
VIDEOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AFTER 
THE ATTACK, WRITER AFTER WRITER 

05:37:47.405 --> 05:37:49.105
CONFIRMED THIS TOO. JENNA RYAN, 
WHO WAS LATER ACCUSED FOR HER 

05:37:49.106 --> 05:37:50.683
ROLE IN THE INSURRECTION SAID, 
QUOTE, I THOUGHT I WAS FOLLOWING

05:37:50.684 --> 05:37:52.374
MY PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT WE WERE 
FOLLOWING WHAT WE WERE CALLED TO

05:37:52.375 --> 05:37:53.802
DO. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REQUESTED THAT WE BE INDICES ON 

05:37:53.803 --> 05:37:55.618
THE 6th . WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR 
THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD NOT 

05:37:55.619 --> 05:37:57.174
PROTECT  THEM, SOME OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS SAID THEY FELT DUPED,

05:37:57.175 --> 05:37:58.454
THEY FELT TRICKED. LISTEN TO 
SOME OF THIS EVIDENCE. 

05:37:58.455 --> 05:38:00.455
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVEN IF THEY THINK FOR A 
SECOND THAT THEY ARE GOING TO 

05:38:00.515 --> 05:38:02.124
GET AWAY WITH IT TODAY, THEY GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING. BECAUSE 

05:38:02.125 --> 05:38:04.007
TODAY IS JUST THE DAY AND TODAY 
IS JUST THE BEGINNING. THEY 

05:38:04.008 --> 05:38:05.604
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY RESISTANCE 
UNTIL THEY HAVE SEEN A PATRIOT 

05:38:05.605 --> 05:38:07.605
FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE PARTIES WILL WITHHOLD. 

05:38:07.796 --> 05:38:09.796
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS IN THE RECORD. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD IS 

05:38:09.798 --> 05:38:11.437
CLOSED. AS 47 DESCRIBES THE 
SCOPE OF THOSE THINGS ADMITTED 

05:38:11.438 --> 05:38:12.638
INTO EVIDENCE AS THOSE 
REFERENCED IN TRIAL. NEW 

05:38:12.639 --> 05:38:13.918
EVIDENCE IS NOT PERMITTED IN 
CLOSING ARGUMENT. REVENANT 

05:38:13.919 --> 05:38:15.835
EVIDENCE TO SUCH WILL BE 
STRICKEN. WHO YIELDS TIME? 

05:38:15.836 --> 05:38:17.784
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THE STATEMENT 
WAS IN EVIDENCE, THE SLIDE WAS 

05:38:17.785 --> 05:38:19.785
NOT SO WE WILL WITHDRAW THIS 
DIED -- BE SLIDE. THE STATEMENT 

05:38:19.895 --> 05:38:22.796
WAS IN EVIDENCE. THEY TOLD YOU 
THEMSELVES THEY WERE FOLLOWING 

05:38:22.989 --> 05:38:24.354
THE PRESIDENT'S ORDERS AND YOU 
WILL SEE SOMETHING CLEARLY. 

05:38:24.355 --> 05:38:26.074
DONALD TRUMP KNEW WHO THESE 
PEOPLE WERE. AS THE SLIDESHOWS, 

05:38:26.075 --> 05:38:27.824
THE PEOPLE WHO HIS VIOLENCE HE 
PRAYS WERE ALL THERE ON JANUARY 

05:38:27.825 --> 05:38:29.825
SIXTH. THE PROUD BOYS WHO DONALD
TRUMP TOLD TO STAND BACK AND 

05:38:29.850 --> 05:38:31.664
STAND BY IN SEPTEMBER OF 2020, 
KEITH LEE, ORGANIZER OF THE 

05:38:31.665 --> 05:38:34.302
TRUMP CARAVAN THAT TRIED TO 
DRIVE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN BUS OFF

05:38:34.445 --> 05:38:36.445
THE ROAD, KATRINA PEARSON, THE 
SPEAKER AT THE SECOND MILLION 

05:38:36.553 --> 05:38:38.553
MAGA MARCH. THEY WERE ALL THERE.
THE VIDEO YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE 

05:38:38.604 --> 05:38:39.894
IS IN THE RECORD. CORRECTION. 
THE RECORD DID INCLUDE 

05:38:39.895 --> 05:38:41.884
APPROPRIATELY THE LAST VIDEO, SO
WE WILL KEEP THAT IN THE RECORD 

05:38:41.885 --> 05:38:43.885
AND I WILL KEEP IT IN MY 

05:38:48.185 --> 05:38:50.185
CLOSING REMARKS.

05:39:33.735 --> 05:39:35.735
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE FROM 
THE WASHINGTON POST. THERE'S 

05:39:35.825 --> 05:39:37.825
THIS QUESTION 

05:39:40.565 --> 05:39:42.664
OVER EVIDENCE WHETHER ALL OF THE
VIDEOS AND SLIDES THAT THE 

05:39:42.864 --> 05:39:44.864
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ARE SHOWING
RIGHT NOW WERE ALREADY PART OF 

05:39:45.065 --> 05:39:47.065
THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD SO JAMES 
HOLMAN, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME 

05:39:47.202 --> 05:39:49.062
BACK-AND-FORTH THAT WE ARE 
WITNESSING HERE AND THE QUESTION

05:39:49.063 --> 05:39:51.605
IS WHETHER OR NOT CONGRESSMAN 
DEAN CAN BE PERMITTED TO SHOW 

05:39:51.825 --> 05:39:54.835
SOME OF THESE, YOU KNOW, VIDEOS 

05:39:58.005 --> 05:40:00.005
AND INFORMATION. I'M JUST 
LAUGHING FROM IT BECAUSE ONE OF 

05:40:00.206 --> 05:40:02.760
THE ATTORNEYS FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, MICHAEL VAN DER VEENS  

05:40:04.849 --> 05:40:09.285
JUST SLAMMED DOWN WHAT HE HAD IN

05:40:14.312 --> 05:40:17.740
HIS HANDS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT PROMPTED IT WAS KATRINA 

05:40:17.939 --> 05:40:19.939
PEARSON, A FREQUENT KIND OF 

05:40:23.125 --> 05:40:25.535
FOX NEWS TALKING HEAD ON TRUMP'S
BEHALF SPOKE OF AND RALLY ON 

05:40:25.705 --> 05:40:29.565
JANUARY SIX AND WAS TALKING 
ABOUT FIGHTING. I BELIEVE WHAT 

05:40:29.787 --> 05:40:31.886
THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT WAS 
INTRODUCED INTO EVIDENCE THAT IT

05:40:32.105 --> 05:40:34.245
WAS PART OF THE EVIDENTIARY 
RECORD BUT THAT WAS NOT ACTUALLY

05:40:34.466 --> 05:40:36.466
PLAYED DURING THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT ARGUMENT SO IT IS 

05:40:36.505 --> 05:40:40.730
THE FIRST TIME THAT PUBLIC EVENT
IS BEING PLAYED DURING THE 

05:40:43.095 --> 05:40:45.095
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS SO THE 
OBJECTION WAS THAT YOU CAN'T ALL

05:40:45.205 --> 05:40:47.707
OF A SUDDEN SHOW US THIS VIDEO 
WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN THE 

05:40:47.906 --> 05:40:51.711
CLOSING ARGUMENT WHICH YOU 
WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE CLOSING OR 

05:40:51.912 --> 05:40:56.565
NEW INFORMATION AND THAT WAS THE
SAME THAT HE WAS OBJECTING 

05:40:56.859 --> 05:40:58.859
BEFORE APPARENTLY ANY RESPONSE 
TO 

05:41:01.227 --> 05:41:05.025
OUR COLLEAGUE RELATED TO WHAT 
SOURCES THAT HE HAS IN MIKE 

05:41:05.245 --> 05:41:07.448
PENCE WERE TELLING HIM YESTERDAY
IN RESPONSE TO THE TRUMP 

05:41:12.205 --> 05:41:16.385
DEFENSE TEAM CLAIMING HOW GOOD 
THE RELATIONSHIP WAS BETWEEN 

05:41:16.636 --> 05:41:19.145
TRUMP AND PENCE AND MIKE LEE 
OBJECTING SAYING YOU CAN'T PUT 

05:41:19.396 --> 05:41:22.219
THIS UP BECAUSE THIS WASN'T PART
OF THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD BUT WE

05:41:22.425 --> 05:41:25.321
ACTUALLY WITHDREW THAT I THINK 
TO SOME DEGREE TO REDUCE 

05:41:25.738 --> 05:41:31.545
SCRUTINY OF IT AND REDUCE THE 
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION BEING PAID 

05:41:32.365 --> 05:41:39.389
TO THE UNDERLYING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM 

05:41:39.565 --> 05:41:43.275
THE MIKE LEE OBJECTION AND THIS 
IS WHAT WAS SUBMITTED INTO THE 

05:41:43.485 --> 05:41:48.769
RECORD OF EVIDENCE BY THE 
VARIOUS TEAMS WHETHER OR NOT IT 

05:41:48.962 --> 05:41:54.885
HAS BEEN PLAYED OR AIRED IT HAD 
STILL BEEN SUBMITTED AHEAD OF 

05:41:55.125 --> 05:41:57.125
TIME AND I WOULD LIKE TO 

05:42:01.225 --> 05:42:08.155
REMIND VIEWERS THAT SEE WHERE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER DEAN GOES 

05:42:09.765 --> 05:42:11.765
FROM HERE. 

05:42:51.245 --> 05:42:53.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATORS WILL TAKE THEIR 
SEATS. THE SENATE WILL BE 

05:42:58.786 --> 05:43:00.786
IN ORDER.

05:43:13.343 --> 05:43:15.343
REPRESENTATIVE YOU 

05:43:18.520 --> 05:43:22.086
MAY CONTINUE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU. I HAVE TO SAY THAT

05:43:22.326 --> 05:43:25.405
OF ALL THE TRIALS I'VE EVER BEEN
A PART OF, THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE

05:43:29.555 --> 05:43:33.365
OF THEM. AS THE SLIDESHOW, THE 
PEOPLE HE CULTIVATED HIS 

05:43:34.265 --> 05:43:38.726
VIOLENCE HE PRAISED WERE ALL 
THERE ON JANUARY SIX. THE PROUD 

05:43:39.255 --> 05:43:44.385
BOYS WHO DONALD TRUMP TOLD TO 
STAND BACK AND STAND BY IN 

05:43:44.585 --> 05:43:46.736
SEPTEMBER OF 2020, KEITH LEE, 
THE ORGANIZER OF THE TRUMP 

05:43:47.017 --> 05:43:49.585
CARAVAN THAT TRIED TO DRIVE THE 
BIDEN CAMPAIGN BUS OFF THE ROAD,

05:43:49.725 --> 05:43:51.725
KATRINA PEARSON, THE SPEAKER AT 
THE SECOND MILLION MAGA MARCH, 

05:43:52.055 --> 05:43:57.665
THEY WERE ALL THERE. THERE IS 
ONE FINAL CLIP ALSO SUBMITTED IN

05:43:59.306 --> 05:44:01.306
THE RECORD.

05:44:08.475 --> 05:44:11.789
SENATORS, SOME OF THE 
INSURRECTIONIST ARE FACING 

05:44:11.987 --> 05:44:13.987
CRIMINAL CHARGES. DONALD TRUMP 
WAS ACTING AS OUR 

05:44:14.105 --> 05:44:16.105
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. HE WAS 

05:44:18.438 --> 05:44:22.674
OUR PRESIDENT. HE USED HIS 
OFFICE AND THE AUTHORITY IT 

05:44:23.044 --> 05:44:26.205
COMMANDS TO INCITE AN ATTACK. 
AND WHEN CONGRESS AND THE 

05:44:26.625 --> 05:44:31.625
CONSTITUTION WERE UNDER ATTACK, 
HE ABANDONED HIS DUTIES, 

05:44:32.284 --> 05:44:34.945
VIOLATED HIS OATH, FAILING TO 
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND. 

05:44:35.155 --> 05:44:39.418
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE BECAUSE 
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

05:44:39.764 --> 05:44:44.565
STATES INSTRUCTED THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE TO ATTACK THE LEGISLATIVE

05:44:44.965 --> 05:44:46.965
BRANCH. HE KNEW WHAT HIS 
SUPPORTERS WERE CAPABLE OF, HE 

05:44:47.226 --> 05:44:51.955
INFLAMED THEM, SEND THEM DOWN 
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, NOT ON ANY 

05:44:52.096 --> 05:44:54.132
OLD DAY BUT ON THE DAY WE WERE 
CERTIFYING THE ELECTION RESULTS 

05:44:54.274 --> 05:44:57.105
AS THEY WERE BANGING ON OUR 
DOORS, HE FAILED TO DEFEND US 

05:44:57.465 --> 05:45:04.125
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE WANTED. 
HE WANTED TO REMAIN IN POWER. 

05:45:04.315 --> 05:45:07.441
FOR THAT CRIME AGAINST THE 
REPUBLIC, HE MUST BE HELD 

05:45:07.645 --> 05:45:09.645
ACCOUNTABLE. SENATORS, THE 
INSURRECTIONIST ARE 

05:45:13.526 --> 05:45:18.326
STILL LISTENING. BEFORE I END, I
MUST ADMIT UNTIL WE WERE 

05:45:18.476 --> 05:45:20.434
PREPARING FOR THIS TRIAL, I 
DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF MANY 

05:45:20.435 --> 05:45:22.435
OF 

05:45:24.515 --> 05:45:29.915
THESE FACTS. I WITNESSED THE 
HORROR BUT I DIDN'T KNOW. I 

05:45:30.055 --> 05:45:31.484
DIDN'T KNOW HOW DELIBERATE THE 
PRESIDENT'S PLANNING WAS. HOW HE

05:45:31.485 --> 05:45:33.244
HAD INVESTED IN IT. HOW MANY 
TIMES HE INCITED HIS SUPPORTERS 

05:45:33.245 --> 05:45:35.245
WITH THESE LIES. HOW CAREFULLY 
AND CONSISTENTLY HE INCITED THEM

05:45:35.317 --> 05:45:37.645
TO VIOLENCE ON JANUARY SIX. 
WHILE MANY OF US MAY HAVE TUNED 

05:45:37.865 --> 05:45:41.005
OUT HIS RALLIES, I ALSO DID NOT 
KNOW THE EXTENT THAT HIS 

05:45:41.205 --> 05:45:44.805
FOLLOWERS WERE LISTENING OR 
HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD. AND 

05:45:45.024 --> 05:45:49.465
HONESTLY, I DID NOT KNOW HOW 
CLOSE THE MOB ACTUALLY CAME TO 

05:45:49.685 --> 05:45:53.145
THEIR VIOLENT ENDS. THAT THEY 
WERE JUST STEPS AWAY FROM ALL OF

05:45:53.365 --> 05:45:55.365
US, THAT THE DEATH TOLL COULD 
HAVE BEEN 

05:45:58.245 --> 05:46:02.385
MUCH HIGHER BUT FOR THE BRAVERY 
OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROTECTED 

05:46:02.585 --> 05:46:06.045
US. BUT NOW WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE
BRAVERY OF PEOPLE LIKE OFFICER 

05:46:06.265 --> 05:46:08.265
GOODMAN AND ALL THE MEN AND 
WOMEN IN THE 

05:46:11.112 --> 05:46:13.112
CAPITAL POLICE. OF THE 
CUSTODIANS WHO, WITH PRIDE AND A

05:46:13.173 --> 05:46:15.173
SENSE OF DUTY IN THEIR WORK, 
CLEANED UP SHATTERED GLASS, 

05:46:16.305 --> 05:46:18.305
SPLINTERED WOOD AND 

05:46:20.077 --> 05:46:22.774
BLOODSTAINED FLOORS. WE KNOW THE
SACRIFICE OF LIFE AND LIMB. WE 

05:46:22.976 --> 05:46:26.085
KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. WE 
KNOW WHAT HE FAILED 

05:46:30.695 --> 05:46:33.025
TO DO THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
BEAR WITNESS AND FACE THE 

05:46:33.245 --> 05:46:35.345
REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THESE HALLS, WHAT HAPPENS IF WE 

05:46:35.545 --> 05:46:38.932
DON'T CONFRONT THESE FACTS? WHAT
HAPPENS IF THERE IS 

05:46:43.945 --> 05:46:47.425
NO ACCOUNTABILITY? FOR THOSE WHO
SAY WE NEED TO GET PAST THIS, WE

05:46:47.641 --> 05:46:52.825
NEED TO COME TOGETHER, WE NEED 
TO UNIFY, IF WE DON'T SET THIS 

05:46:53.045 --> 05:46:56.419
RIGHT AND CALL IT WHAT IT WAS, 
THE HIGHEST OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

05:46:56.635 --> 05:46:59.685
CRIMES BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, THE PAST WILL NOT

05:47:02.025 --> 05:47:06.105
BE PASSED. THE PAST WILL BECOME 
OUR FUTURE. FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN

05:47:06.325 --> 05:47:08.325
AND FOR 

05:47:09.965 --> 05:47:13.225
THEIR CHILDREN. SENATORS, WE ARE
IN A DIALOGUE WITH HISTORY. A 

05:47:13.442 --> 05:47:17.905
CONVERSATION WITH OUR PAST, WITH
A HOPE FOR OUR FUTURE. 234 YEARS

05:47:22.665 --> 05:47:27.655
FROM NOW, IT MAY BE THAT NO ONE 
PERSON HERE AMONG US IS 

05:47:27.905 --> 05:47:30.205
REMEMBERED. AND YET, WHAT WE DO 
HERE, WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF 

05:47:30.419 --> 05:47:34.465
EACH OF US HERE IN THIS MOMENT 
WILL BE REMEMBERED. HISTORY HAS 

05:47:37.015 --> 05:47:39.015
FOUND US. I ASK THAT YOU NOT 
LOOK THE 

05:47:43.706 --> 05:47:45.706
OTHER WAY.

05:47:47.317 --> 05:47:52.655
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD NOW LIKE TO BRING UP 

05:47:57.666 --> 05:47:59.666
THE NEXT.

05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:11.430
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

05:48:12.835 --> 05:48:17.075
MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED 
SENATORS. THERE IS AN OLD QUOTE 

05:48:17.276 --> 05:48:20.615
FROM HENRY CLAY, SON OF 

05:48:24.875 --> 05:48:26.985
KENTUCKY, THAT THE USE OF A 
SMALL AND TRIVIAL CHARACTER ARE 

05:48:27.205 --> 05:48:29.205
THE ONES THAT STRIKE DEEPEST IN 
THE GRATEFUL AND 

05:48:32.415 --> 05:48:34.745
APPRECIATING HEART. I WANT TO 
SAY ON BEHALF OF ALL THE HOUSE 

05:48:34.965 --> 05:48:38.608
MANAGERS THAT WE ARE VERY 
GRATEFUL FOR THE COURTESIES THAT

05:48:38.822 --> 05:48:40.929
YOU HAVE EXTENDED TO US AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL DURING THE 

05:48:41.145 --> 05:48:43.545
COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. YOU'VE 
HEARD MY COLLEAGUE, MANAGER 

05:48:43.765 --> 05:48:46.345
DEAN, GO THROUGH THE 
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT MAKES

05:48:46.546 --> 05:48:50.196
CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MUST 
BE CONVICTED AND DISQUALIFIED 

05:48:50.397 --> 05:48:55.279
FOR HIS HIGH CRIME. I'M NOT 
GOING TO REPEAT THAT EVIDENCE. 

05:48:55.445 --> 05:48:57.445
IT SPEAKS 

05:48:59.245 --> 05:49:02.276
FOR ITSELF. EARLIER IN THIS 
TRIAL, YOU MIGHT RECALL A FEW 

05:49:02.496 --> 05:49:05.986
DAYS AGO, THAT I MENTIONED MY 
EXPECTATION THAT PRESIDENT 

05:49:06.855 --> 05:49:09.845
TRUMP'S LAWYERS MIGHT DO 
EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO AVOID 

05:49:10.255 --> 05:49:12.255
DISCUSSING THE FACTS OF 

05:49:14.265 --> 05:49:18.705
THIS CASE. AND I CAN UNDERSTAND 
WHY. I MEAN, THE EVIDENCE THAT 

05:49:18.925 --> 05:49:23.645
ALL OF US PRESENTED, THAT 
MANAGER DEAN JUST SUMMARIZED IS 

05:49:25.285 --> 05:49:29.145
PRETTY DEVASTATING AND SO RATHER
THAN ADDRESS IT, THE PRESIDENT 

05:49:29.365 --> 05:49:34.221
HAS OFFERED UP DISTRACTIONS. 

05:49:38.145 --> 05:49:40.145
EXCUSES. ANYTHING BUT ACTUALLY 
TRYING TO DEFEND AGAINST 

05:49:44.585 --> 05:49:47.165
THE FACTS. THEY SAID THINGS LIKE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOW A PRIVATE

05:49:47.385 --> 05:49:52.477
CITIZEN SO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM CAN DEAL WITH HIM OR WE 

05:49:52.677 --> 05:49:54.815
HAVEN'T SET A CLEAR STANDARD FOR
INCITEMENT, THEY TALKED A LOT 

05:49:55.035 --> 05:49:58.025
ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND THAT ALL 
POLITICIANS SAY WORDS LIKE 

05:49:58.225 --> 05:50:02.499
FIGHT. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A 
MINUTE TO EXPLAIN WHY EACH OF 

05:50:03.737 --> 05:50:05.737
THOSE DISTRACTIONS ARE 

05:50:07.705 --> 05:50:09.705
PRECISELY THAT, DISTRACTIONS. 
AND WHY THEY DO NOT PREVENT, IN 

05:50:09.799 --> 05:50:11.799
ANY WAY, 

05:50:13.885 --> 05:50:15.885
THE SENATE FROM CONVICTING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

05:50:20.165 --> 05:50:22.205
NUMBER ONE, EVERY PRESIDENT IS 
ONE DAY A PRIVATE 

05:50:25.205 --> 05:50:27.205
CITIZEN AGAIN. SO, I MEAN, THE 
ARGUMENT THAT BECAUSE PRESIDENT 

05:50:27.365 --> 05:50:29.745
TRUMP HAS LEFT OFFICE ON THE HE 
SHOULD BE IMPEACHED FOR CONDUCT 

05:50:29.965 --> 05:50:35.455
COMMITTED WHILE HE WAS IN OFFICE
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I MEAN, WHY 

05:50:35.675 --> 05:50:38.632
WOULD THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDE 
THE IMPEACHMENT POWER 

05:50:41.875 --> 05:50:45.005
AT ALL IF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM SERVES AS A SUITABLE 

05:50:45.225 --> 05:50:48.865
ALTERNATIVE ONCE A PRESIDENT 
LEAVES OFFICE? IT WOULDN'T. 

05:50:49.085 --> 05:50:54.504
IMPEACHMENT IS A REMEDY SEPARATE
AND APART FROM THE CRIMINAL 

05:50:54.720 --> 05:50:58.285
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND FOR GOOD 
REASON. THE PRESIDENCY, I MEAN, 

05:50:58.505 --> 05:51:01.085
IT COMES WITH SPECIAL POWERS. 

05:51:05.575 --> 05:51:07.444
EXTRAORDINARY POWERS, NOT THE 
STOWED ON ORDINARY CITIZENS. AND

05:51:07.445 --> 05:51:11.517
IF THOSE POWERS ARE ABUSED, THEY
CAN CAUSE GREAT DAMAGE TO OUR 

05:51:11.718 --> 05:51:15.771
COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE TO BE 
DEALT WITH IN A SEPARATE FORUM. 

05:51:18.095 --> 05:51:20.095
THIS FORUM. AND IT WOULD 

05:51:23.925 --> 05:51:26.085
BE UNWISE TO SUGGEST THAT GOING 
FORWARD, THE ONLY APPROPRIATE 

05:51:26.337 --> 05:51:28.337
RESPONSE 

05:51:30.165 --> 05:51:31.831
TO CONSTITUTIONAL OFFENSES 
COMMITTED BY A PRESIDENT ARE 

05:51:31.832 --> 05:51:33.493
CRIMINAL CHARGES WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT RETURNS TO PRIVATE 

05:51:33.494 --> 05:51:37.778
LIFE. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF 
POLITICAL SYSTEM ANY OF US WANT.

05:51:37.964 --> 05:51:39.964
AND IT IS NOT THE KIND OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM THE 

05:51:41.245 --> 05:51:47.405
FRAMERS INTENDED. SECOND, IT IS 
TRUE, WE HAVE INCITED 

05:51:51.985 --> 05:51:53.505
CRIMINAL STATUTES ESTABLISHING 
ELEMENTS OF INCITEMENT BECAUSE, 

05:51:53.506 --> 05:51:56.465
AGAIN, THIS ISN'T A CRIMINAL 
TRIAL. IS NOT A 

05:52:00.855 --> 05:52:03.775
CRIMINAL CASE. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS CHARGED WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL

05:52:03.995 --> 05:52:07.785
OFFENSE. AND YOU ARE TO ASK WITH
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT HE 

05:52:08.005 --> 05:52:12.705
COMMITTED THAT HIGH CRIME AS 
UNDERSTOOD BY OUR FRAMERS 

05:52:12.865 --> 05:52:17.598
MUSCLE, THE RELEVANT QUESTION, 
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS 

05:52:17.799 --> 05:52:21.165
WOULD HAVE YOU IGNORE IS WHAT 
OUR FRAMERS HAD CONSIDERED A 

05:52:21.375 --> 05:52:23.375
PRESIDENT INCITING A 

05:52:25.225 --> 05:52:28.995
VIOLENT MOB TO ATTACK OUR 
GOVERNMENT WHILE SEEKING TO STOP

05:52:33.237 --> 05:52:35.144
THE CERTIFICATION OF OUR 
ELECTIONS. WITH THE OF CONSIDER 

05:52:35.145 --> 05:52:37.297
THAT AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE? WHO

05:52:42.314 --> 05:52:44.566
AMONG US, WHO AMONG US REALLY 
THINKS THE ANSWER TO THAT 

05:52:44.786 --> 05:52:46.786
QUESTION 

05:52:48.725 --> 05:52:52.425
IS NO? THIRD, DUE PROCESS. SO, 
JUST TO BE 

05:52:55.859 --> 05:52:58.345
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, THE HOUSE WITH
THE SOLE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT 

05:52:58.565 --> 05:53:00.706
DETERMINES WHAT THE PROCESS 
LOOKS LIKE IN THE HOUSE AND THE 

05:53:00.906 --> 05:53:02.906
SENATE DOES THE SAME FOR 

05:53:06.101 --> 05:53:09.710
THE TRIAL. DURING THIS TRIAL, 
THE PRESIDENT HAS COUNSEL. 

05:53:10.725 --> 05:53:12.725
THEY'VE ARGUED VERY VIGOROUSLY 
ON 

05:53:15.925 --> 05:53:19.065
HIS BEHALF. WE HAD A FULL 
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE, 

05:53:19.285 --> 05:53:22.739
ADVERSARIAL PRESENTATIONS, 
MOTIONS, THE PRESIDENT WAS 

05:53:22.940 --> 05:53:27.565
INVITED TO TESTIFY, HE DECLINED.
PRESIDENT WAS INVITED TO PROVIDE

05:53:28.205 --> 05:53:30.205
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. 

05:53:33.438 --> 05:53:35.946
HE DECLINED. YOU CAN'T CLAIM 
THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS WHEN YOU

05:53:36.165 --> 05:53:38.165
WON'T PARTICIPATE IN 

05:53:40.285 --> 05:53:42.645
THE PROCESS. AND WE KNOW THIS 
CASE ISN'T ONE THAT REQUIRES A 

05:53:42.865 --> 05:53:46.709
COMPLICATED LEGAL ANALYSIS. YOU 
LIVED IT. THE MANAGERS AND I, WE

05:53:48.445 --> 05:53:53.125
LIVED IT. OUR COUNTRY LIVED IT. 
THE PRESIDENT, IN PUBLIC VIEW, 

05:53:53.346 --> 05:53:59.635
RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN, INCITED A
VIOLENT MOB. A MOB THAT 

05:53:59.855 --> 05:54:04.865
TEMPORARILY, AT LEAST, STOPPED 
US FROM CERTIFYING ELECTION. IF 

05:54:05.066 --> 05:54:08.946
THERE WERE EVER AN EXIGENT 
CIRCUMSTANCE, THIS 

05:54:13.075 --> 05:54:15.075
IS IT. 

05:54:17.045 --> 05:54:20.865
NUMBER FOUR. WE ALL KNOW THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE, AS WE

05:54:21.085 --> 05:54:25.845
PREDICTED, SPENT A LOT OF TIME, 
A WHOLE LOT OF TIME, COMPARING 

05:54:29.517 --> 05:54:32.085
HIS CONDUCT TO OTHER POLITICIANS
USING WORDS LIKE FIGHT. OF 

05:54:32.305 --> 05:54:34.305
COURSE YOU SAW 

05:54:36.805 --> 05:54:39.397
THE ARTISTS A VIDEO. AS I SAID 
ON THURSDAY, WE TRUST YOU TO 

05:54:39.597 --> 05:54:44.325
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE 
WHAT YOU WILL NOT FIND IN THOSE 

05:54:45.405 --> 05:54:50.415
VIDEO MONTAGES THAT THEY SHOWED 
YOU IS ANY OF THOSE SPEECHES, 

05:54:51.445 --> 05:54:53.445
THOSE 

05:54:54.905 --> 05:54:57.845
REMARKS CULMINATING IN A VIOLENT
INSURRECTION ON OUR NATIONS 

05:54:58.045 --> 05:55:00.045
CAPITAL. THAT IS 

05:55:03.485 --> 05:55:05.485
THE DIFFERENCE. THE PRESIDENT 
SPENT MONTHS INFLAMING HIS 

05:55:05.566 --> 05:55:08.771
SUPPORTERS TO BELIEVE THAT THE 
ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM 

05:55:08.971 --> 05:55:13.206
HIM, FROM THEM. WHICH WAS NOT 
TRUE. HE SUMMONED 

05:55:16.176 --> 05:55:18.879
ASSEMBLED THE MOB AND WHEN THE 
VIOLENCE ERUPTED, HE DID NOTHING

05:55:19.079 --> 05:55:21.665
TO STOP IT. INSTEAD, INCITING 

05:55:26.375 --> 05:55:31.705
IT FURTHER. SENATORS, ALL OF 
THESE ARGUMENTS OFFERED BY THE 

05:55:31.925 --> 05:55:33.925
PRESIDENT HAVE ONE FUNDAMENTAL 
THING IN 

05:55:36.212 --> 05:55:39.785
COMMON. ONE. THEY HAVE NOTHING 
TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT 

05:55:40.005 --> 05:55:44.445
FACTUALLY, WHETHER OR NOT THE 
PRESIDENT INCITED THIS ATTACK. 

05:55:44.665 --> 05:55:46.665
THEY'VE 

05:55:48.425 --> 05:55:50.825
GIVEN YOU A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS 
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND 

05:55:51.045 --> 05:55:53.045
WHAT HAPPENED HERE ON THAT 
TERRIBLE DAY. AND THEY 

05:55:56.205 --> 05:55:58.205
DO THAT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE 
THOSE DISTRACTIONS ARE GOING 

05:56:01.605 --> 05:56:03.605
TO WORK. THAT YOU WILL IGNORE 
THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT INSTEAD 

05:56:03.755 --> 05:56:06.650
OF CONFRONTING IT. I THINK THEY 

05:56:11.585 --> 05:56:16.524
ARE WRONG. SOME OF YOU KNOW THIS
ALREADY. I'M THE YOUNGEST MEMBER

05:56:16.745 --> 05:56:24.665
OF OUR MANAGER TEAM BUYS QUITE A
FEW YEARS. SO PERHAPS SOME OF IT

05:56:24.866 --> 05:56:26.866
NAÏVE, BUT, I JUST DON'T 

05:56:30.746 --> 05:56:34.325
BELIEVE THAT. I REALLY DON'T. I 
DON'T BELIEVE THERE EFFORT IS 

05:56:34.546 --> 05:56:37.285
GOING TO WORK. AND HERE IS WHY. 
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THIS BODY IS

05:56:38.752 --> 05:56:42.077
CAPABLE OF. I MAY NOT HAVE 
WITNESSED IT, BUT I READ ABOUT 

05:56:42.285 --> 05:56:46.125
IT. IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. I'VE 
SEEN THE 

05:56:51.145 --> 05:56:53.145
C-SPAN FOOTAGE

05:56:55.685 --> 05:56:57.845
, ARCHIVES, SOMETIMES OF WATCH 
THEM FOR HOURS AND YES I'VE 

05:56:58.054 --> 05:57:00.135
ACTUALLY DONE THAT AND THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY IN THOSE 

05:57:00.335 --> 05:57:02.625
BOOKS AND IN THOSE TAPES, THE 
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN

05:57:02.846 --> 05:57:07.135
DEFINED RIGHT HERE ON THIS 
FLOOR. THE 13th AMENDMENT, THE 

05:57:07.335 --> 05:57:12.665
AMENDMENT ABOLISHING SLAVERY WAS
PASSED IN THIS VERY ROOM. IN 

05:57:12.886 --> 05:57:14.886
THIS ROOM. NOT 

05:57:17.566 --> 05:57:20.940
FIGURATIVELY, LITERALLY. WEAR 
YOU OFF IT AND WHERE I STAND. IN

05:57:21.145 --> 05:57:25.785
1964, THIS BODY, WITH THE HELP 
OF SENATORS LIKE JOHN SHERMAN 

05:57:26.005 --> 05:57:30.785
COOPER AND SO MANY OTHERS, THIS 
BODY SECURED PASSAGE OF THE 

05:57:30.986 --> 05:57:32.986
CIVIL 

05:57:35.305 --> 05:57:40.225
RIGHTS ACT. WE MADE THE DECISION
TO ENTER WORLD WAR II FROM THIS 

05:57:40.515 --> 05:57:42.515
CHAMBER. WE HAVE CERTAINLY HAD 

05:57:46.695 --> 05:57:48.806
OUR STRUGGLES, BUT WE'VE ALWAYS 
RISEN TO THE OCCASION WHEN IT 

05:57:49.026 --> 05:57:51.026
MATTERED THE MOST. NOT BY 

05:57:55.025 --> 05:57:57.025
IGNORING INJUSTICE OR COWERING 
TO BULLIES AND THREATS, BUT BY 

05:57:57.157 --> 05:57:59.725
DOING THE RIGHT THING, BY TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND THAT 

05:57:59.935 --> 05:58:02.230
IS WHY SO MANY NATIONS AROUND 
THE WORLD ASPIRE TO BE LIKE 

05:58:02.431 --> 05:58:04.431
AMERICA. THEY STAND UP 

05:58:06.415 --> 05:58:08.505
TO DICTATORS AND TYRANTS BECAUSE
AMERICA IS A GUIDING LIGHT FOR 

05:58:08.705 --> 05:58:10.705
THEM. A 

05:58:13.815 --> 05:58:16.366
NORTH STAR. THEY DO SO, THEY 
LOOK TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN 

05:58:16.585 --> 05:58:18.585
A GUIDING LIGHT, A NORTH STAR IN

05:58:22.846 --> 05:58:26.651
THESE MOMENTS. BECAUSE THE 
PEOPLE WHO SAT IN YOUR CHAIRS 

05:58:26.851 --> 05:58:29.425
WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CHOICES 
THAT DEFINE US ROSE TO THE 

05:58:29.626 --> 05:58:34.966
OCCASION. I WANT TO OFFER ONE 
MORE EXAMPLE OF A DECISION IN 

05:58:35.186 --> 05:58:37.186
THIS ROOM BY THIS BODY THAT 
RESONATED 

05:58:41.706 --> 05:58:43.706
WITH ME.

05:58:47.746 --> 05:58:50.486
THE FIRST DAY I STOOD UP IN THIS
TRIAL, I MENTIONED THAT I WAS 

05:58:50.706 --> 05:58:52.865
THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS LIKE MANY 
OF YOU AND MANY SENATORS 

05:58:53.085 --> 05:58:55.004
GRACIOUSLY APPROACHED ME AFTER 
MY PRESENTATION AND ASKED ME 

05:58:55.005 --> 05:58:57.526
WHERE MY PARENTS WERE FROM AND I
TOLD THOSE WHO ASKED, MY FOLKS 

05:58:57.746 --> 05:59:01.785
WERE FROM EAST AFRICA. IN 1986, 
1986, THIS BODY CONSIDERED A 

05:59:01.986 --> 05:59:07.985
BILL TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT 
REAGAN'S VETO OF LATEST FLASHING

05:59:08.205 --> 05:59:10.205
LEGISLATION IMPOSING SANCTIONS 
ON 

05:59:13.052 --> 05:59:15.052
SOUTH AFRICA. 

05:59:16.505 --> 05:59:19.463
TWO SENATORS WHO SIT IN THIS 
ROOM, ONE DEMOCRAT AND ONE 

05:59:21.375 --> 05:59:26.165
REPUBLICAN VOTED TO OVERRIDE 
THAT VETO. THAT VOTE WAS NOT 

05:59:26.385 --> 05:59:32.117
ABOUT GAINING POLITICAL FAVOR. 
AND IN FACT, IT WAS MADE DESPITE

05:59:32.317 --> 05:59:34.317
POTENTIALLY LOSING 

05:59:36.742 --> 05:59:39.047
POLITICAL FAVOR AND I HAVE TO 
IMAGINE THAT THAT VOTE WAS CAST 

05:59:39.266 --> 05:59:41.999
LIKE THE DECISIONS BEFORE IT 
BECAUSE THERE ARE MOMENTS THAT 

05:59:42.206 --> 05:59:44.206
TRANSCEND PARTY POLITICS AND 
THAT REQUIRE US TO PUT COUNTRY 

05:59:44.285 --> 05:59:47.895
ABOVE OUR PARTY BECAUSE THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT DOING SO ARE

05:59:48.116 --> 05:59:50.116
JUST 

05:59:51.945 --> 05:59:53.945
TOO GREAT. SENATORS, THIS IS ONE
OF 

05:59:56.826 --> 05:59:58.826
THOSE MOMENTS. 

06:00:00.756 --> 06:00:02.756
MANY FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING 
TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS MAY NOT KNOW

06:00:02.854 --> 06:00:07.345
THIS, BUT, HOUSE MEMBERS LIKE ME
AND MANAGER ASKING, WE ARE NOT 

06:00:07.545 --> 06:00:09.545
ALLOWED ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
WITHOUT 

06:00:13.085 --> 06:00:15.085
EXPRESS PERMISSION. KNOW IT IS, 
CERTAINLY THE SENATORS ARE AWARE

06:00:15.673 --> 06:00:17.673
OF THAT. THIS FLOOR 

06:00:20.876 --> 06:00:25.469
IS SACRED. IT IS ONE OF THE 
REASONS WHY I, LIKE SO MANY OF 

06:00:25.681 --> 06:00:27.681
YOU, OFFENDED TO SEE IT 
DESECRATED BY 

06:00:30.576 --> 06:00:32.245
THAT MOB. TO SEE THOSE 
INSURRECTIONIST DIMINISHING AND 

06:00:32.246 --> 06:00:35.206
DEVALUING AND DISRESPECTING 
THESE HALLOWED HALLS THAT MY 

06:00:35.406 --> 06:00:37.406
WHOLE LIFE I HAVE HELD IN 

06:00:41.406 --> 06:00:43.406
SUCH ALL. BECAUSE OF THOSE RULES
THAT I 

06:00:46.185 --> 06:00:48.517
JUST MENTIONED, THIS WILL BE THE
ONLY TIME I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE 

06:00:48.717 --> 06:00:51.206
TO STAND BEFORE YOU LIKE THIS. 
WHEN THE TRIAL IS OVER, I WILL 

06:00:51.426 --> 06:00:56.465
GO BACK TO BEING NOT AN 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER BUT JUST 

06:00:56.715 --> 06:01:00.966
BEING A HOUSE MEMBER. THE TRIAL 
WILL END AND WE WILL RESUME OUR 

06:01:01.186 --> 06:01:06.204
LIVES AND OUR WORK. BUT, FOR 
SOME, THERE WILL BE NO END. 

06:01:10.486 --> 06:01:12.646
NO END. NO END TO THE PAIN ON 
WHAT HAPPENED ON 

06:01:16.756 --> 06:01:18.756
JANUARY SIX. THE OFFICERS WHO 
STRUGGLED TO RECOVER FROM THE 

06:01:18.866 --> 06:01:21.941
INJURIES THEY SUSTAINED TO 
PROTECT US, THE STRUGGLE TO 

06:01:23.425 --> 06:01:28.866
RECOVER TODAY. THE FAMILIES WHO 
CONTINUE TO MOURN THOSE WHO THEY

06:01:29.086 --> 06:01:31.086
LOST ON THAT TERRIBLE, 

06:01:35.585 --> 06:01:42.952
TRAGIC DAY. I WAS STRUCK 
YESTERDAY BY DEFENSE COUNSEL'S, 

06:01:43.204 --> 06:01:47.236
CONTINUED REFERENCES TO HATE. 
ONE OF MY 

06:01:52.246 --> 06:01:54.666
FAVORITE QUOTES OF DR. MARTIN 
LUTHER KING JR., IT IS ONE THAT 

06:01:54.885 --> 06:01:59.406
HAS SUSTAINED ME  DURING TIMES 
OF ADVERSITY. I DECIDED TO STICK

06:02:02.206 --> 06:02:04.206
WITH LOVE. THAT HATE IS TOO 
GREAT A BURDEN 

06:02:07.718 --> 06:02:10.266
TO BEAR. THIS TRIAL IS NOT BORN 
FROM HATRED. FAR 

06:02:14.856 --> 06:02:19.406
FROM IT. IT IS BORN FROM LOVE OF
COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY. OUR DESIRE

06:02:19.626 --> 06:02:21.626
TO 

06:02:22.686 --> 06:02:28.215
MAINTAIN IT. OUR DESIRE TO SEE 
AMERICA AT ITS BEST AND IN THOSE

06:02:28.435 --> 06:02:32.726
MOMENTS THAT I SPOKE OF, CIVIL 
RIGHTS ACT, 

06:02:36.212 --> 06:02:39.820
WE REMEMBER THOSE MOMENTS 
BECAUSE THEY HELPED DEFINE AND 

06:02:40.006 --> 06:02:42.006
ENSHRINE AMERICA AT 

06:02:44.346 --> 06:02:49.016
ITS BEST. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT 
OUR CERTIFICATION OF THE 

06:02:50.456 --> 06:02:53.665
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES IN THE 
EARLY HOURS OF JANUARY SEVENTH, 

06:02:53.886 --> 06:02:57.946
OUR REFUSAL TO LET OUR REPUBLIC 
BE THREATENED AND TAKEN DOWN BY 

06:02:58.166 --> 06:03:03.655
A VIOLENT MOB WILL GO DOWN IN 
HISTORY AS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS 

06:03:03.936 --> 06:03:07.536
TOO. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS 
BODY CAN RISE TO THE OCCASION 

06:03:07.754 --> 06:03:09.754
ONCE 

06:03:11.566 --> 06:03:13.566
AGAIN TODAY. BY CONVICTING 

06:03:16.766 --> 06:03:18.766
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DEFENDING 

06:03:20.454 --> 06:03:26.596
OUR REPUBLIC. AND MISTAKES, -- 
THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. 

06:03:26.816 --> 06:03:29.346
BECAUSE THE COLD, 

06:03:32.526 --> 06:03:36.370
HARD TRUTH IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
ON JANUARY 6th CAN HAPPEN 

06:03:40.586 --> 06:03:46.576
AGAIN.  I FEAR LIKE MANY OF YOU 
DO THAT THE VIOLENCE WE SAW ON 

06:03:46.826 --> 06:03:51.076
THAT DAY MAYBE JUST THE 
BEGINNING. WE'VE SHOWN YOU THE 

06:03:53.164 --> 06:03:55.164
ONGOING RISKS, THE 

06:03:57.026 --> 06:03:59.026
EXTREMIST GROUPS WHO GROW MORE 
EMBOLDENED 

06:04:01.358 --> 06:04:08.597
EVERY DAY. SENATORS, THIS CANNOT
BE THE BEGINNING. IT CAN'T BE 

06:04:08.797 --> 06:04:16.036
THE NEW NORMAL. IT HAS TO BE THE
END. AND THAT DECISION IS IN 

06:04:21.046 --> 06:04:23.046
YOUR HANDS. 

06:04:31.297 --> 06:04:36.146
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS, MY 
DAUGHTER HANNAH SAID SOMETHING 

06:04:36.366 --> 06:04:43.576
TO ME LAST NIGHT THAT STOPPED ME
COLD AND BROUGHT ME UP SHORT. 

06:04:43.796 --> 06:04:45.796
HER KIDS 

06:04:48.986 --> 06:04:51.566
HAVE BEEN VERY MOVED BY ALL THE 
VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE, THE 

06:04:51.720 --> 06:04:55.506
OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILIES, BUT
HANNAH TOLD ME LAST NIGHT SHE 

06:04:55.726 --> 06:04:58.485
FELT REALLY SORRY FOR THE KID OF
A MAN WHO SAID GOODBYE TO HIS 

06:04:58.694 --> 06:05:00.694
CHILDREN BEFORE HE LEFT HOME TO 
COME AND JOIN 

06:05:04.146 --> 06:05:06.396
TRUMP'S ACTIONS. THEIR FATHER 
HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DAD 

06:05:06.580 --> 06:05:08.791
MIGHT NOT BE COMING HOME AGAIN 
AND THEY MIGHT NOT EVER SEE HIM 

06:05:08.991 --> 06:05:10.991
AGAIN. IN OTHER WORDS, 

06:05:14.186 --> 06:05:16.356
HE WAS EXPECTING VIOLENCE, HE 
MIGHT DIE AS INSURRECTIONIST 

06:05:16.576 --> 06:05:18.576
DID. AND THAT 

06:05:21.006 --> 06:05:24.060
SHOOK ME. HANNAH SAID HOW CAN 
THE PRESIDENT PUT CHILDREN AND 

06:05:24.226 --> 06:05:28.826
FAMILIES IN THAT SITUATION AND 
THEN JUST RUN AWAY FROM THE 

06:05:29.216 --> 06:05:36.525
WHOLE THING? THAT SHOOK ME. AND 
I WAS 

06:05:37.696 --> 06:05:42.477
BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST SAW THE 
LINE ABOUT YOUR FATHER GOING TO 

06:05:43.087 --> 06:05:45.676
WASHINGTON, YOU MIGHT NOT SEE 
HIM AGAIN, I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT 

06:05:46.006 --> 06:05:49.717
IT, WELL, LIKE A PROSECUTOR, 
LIKE A MANAGER. I THOUGHT WHAT 

06:05:49.876 --> 06:05:54.086
DAMNING EVIDENCE THAT IS THAT 
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING 

06:05:55.105 --> 06:05:56.946
VIOLENCE THAT A PROTEST CALLED 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

06:05:56.947 --> 06:06:02.288
STATES AND SAYING GOODBYES TO 
THEIR KIDS, BUT HANNAH, MY DEAR 

06:06:02.726 --> 06:06:09.276
HANNAH THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE A 
HUMAN BEING. SHE THOUGHT OF IT, 

06:06:09.536 --> 06:06:15.566
IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME, LIKE A 
PATRIOT. SOMEONE WHO JUST LOST 

06:06:15.736 --> 06:06:20.703
HER BROTHER AND DOESN'T WANT TO 
SEE ANY OTHER KIDS IN AMERICA GO

06:06:21.082 --> 06:06:25.036
THROUGH THAT KIND OF AGONY AND 
GRIEF. SENATORS, WHEN I SAY ALL 

06:06:25.358 --> 06:06:29.796
THREE OF MY KIDS ARE BETTER THAN
ME, YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT 

06:06:30.699 --> 06:06:34.803
ENGAGED IN IDLE FLATTERY. MAYBE 
SOME OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY 

06:06:35.296 --> 06:06:38.536
ABOUT YOUR KIDS. THEY ARE 
LITERALLY BETTER PEOPLE THAN ME.

06:06:39.036 --> 06:06:43.628
THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF THEIR MOM 
AND THEY ARE BETTER THAN ME. AND

06:06:43.806 --> 06:06:47.995
HANNAH SAW THROUGH THE LEGALITY 
OF THE SITUATION. SHE SAW 

06:06:48.197 --> 06:06:52.106
THROUGH THE POLITICS OF THE 
SITUATION, ALL THE WAY TO THE 

06:06:52.726 --> 06:06:54.997
HUMANITY OF THE SITUATION. THE 
MORALITY OF 

06:06:59.486 --> 06:07:02.256
THE SITUATION. THAT WAS ONE OF 
THE MOST PATRIOTIC THINGS I EVER

06:07:02.596 --> 06:07:08.688
HEARD ANYBODY SAY. THE CHILDREN 
OF THE INSURRECTIONIST, EVEN THE

06:07:09.386 --> 06:07:13.078
VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS ONES, THEY
ARE OUR CHILDREN TOO. THEY ARE 

06:07:13.256 --> 06:07:16.146
AMERICANS AND WE MUST TAKE CARE 
OF THEM. AND THEIR FUTURE. WE 

06:07:19.137 --> 06:07:21.666
MUST RECOGNIZE AND EXERCISE 
THESE CRIMES AGAINST OUR NATION 

06:07:21.906 --> 06:07:27.666
AND THEN WE MUST TAKE CARE OF 
OUR PEOPLE AND OUR CHILDREN, 

06:07:28.236 --> 06:07:31.626
THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR MINDS AS 
TOMMY RASKIN USED TO SAY, IT IS 

06:07:31.796 --> 06:07:36.496
HARD TO BE HUMAN. MANY OF THE 
CAPITAL AND METROPOLITAN POLICE 

06:07:36.636 --> 06:07:38.636
OFFICERS AND GUARDS MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO WERE BEING 

06:07:41.686 --> 06:07:44.387
UP THEM BY THE MOB ALSO HAVE 
KIDS. YOU REMEMBER OFFICER FOR 

06:07:44.529 --> 06:07:46.606
KNOWN WHO HAD A HEART ATTACK 
AFTER BEING TASED AND ROUGHED UP

06:07:46.826 --> 06:07:49.406
FOUR HOURS BY THE MOB AND THEN 
BIG FOR HIS LIFE TELLING THE 

06:07:49.626 --> 06:07:51.626
INSURRECTIONIST THAT HE HAD 

06:07:53.746 --> 06:07:58.046
FOUR DAUGHTERS. AND THAT JUST 
ABOUT BROKE MY HEART ALL OVER 

06:07:58.266 --> 06:08:00.786
AGAIN. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR 
A LONG TIME LAST NIGHT. MY KIDS 

06:08:00.986 --> 06:08:02.986
FELT TERRIBLE THAT OTHER KIDS 
FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE PULLED 

06:08:03.146 --> 06:08:05.686
INTO THIS NIGHTMARE BY A 
PRESIDENT OF THE 

06:08:10.706 --> 06:08:13.957
UNITED STATES. SENATORS, WE 
PROVED HE BETRAYED HIS COUNTRY. 

06:08:14.157 --> 06:08:16.486
WE PROVED HE BETRAYED HIS 
CONSTITUTION. WE PROVED HE 

06:08:16.706 --> 06:08:18.706
BETRAYED HIS OATH 

06:08:20.380 --> 06:08:24.176
OF OFFICE. THE STARTLING THING 
TO RECOGNIZE NOW IS THAT HE IS 

06:08:24.378 --> 06:08:26.378
EVEN BETRAYING 

06:08:28.026 --> 06:08:31.846
THE MOB. HE TOLD THEM HE WOULD 
MARCH WITH THEM AND HE DIDN'T. 

06:08:32.065 --> 06:08:34.065
THEY BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS 
RIGHT THERE WITH HIM SOMEWHERE 

06:08:34.196 --> 06:08:36.196
IN THE CROWD FIGHTING THE 

06:08:39.516 --> 06:08:41.516
FANTASY CONSPIRACY TO STEAL THE 
ELECTION AND STEAL THEIR COUNTRY

06:08:41.806 --> 06:08:45.166
AWAY FROM THEM. THEY THOUGHT 
THEY WERE ONE BIG TEAM WORKING 

06:08:45.386 --> 06:08:49.086
TOGETHER. HE TOLD THEM THEIR 
GREAT JOURNEY TOGETHER WAS JUST 

06:08:49.306 --> 06:08:50.978
BEGINNING AND NOW THERE ARE 
HUNDREDS OF CRIMINAL 

06:08:50.979 --> 06:08:54.127
PROSECUTIONS GETTING GOING ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE GETTING

06:08:54.328 --> 06:09:00.906
SET TO SAY GOODBYE TO MEMBERS OF
THEIR FAMILY AND THE PRESIDENT 

06:09:01.126 --> 06:09:03.126
WHO 

06:09:06.046 --> 06:09:07.766
CONTACTED THEM, SOLICITED THEM, 
LURED THEM, INVITED THEM, 

06:09:07.767 --> 06:09:11.690
INCITED THEM, THAT PRESIDENT HAS
SUDDENLY GONE QUIET AND DARK. 

06:09:11.876 --> 06:09:13.876
NOWHERE TO 

06:09:17.046 --> 06:09:19.346
BE FOUND. HE CANNOT BE TROUBLED 
TO COME HERE TO TELL US 

06:09:23.255 --> 06:09:25.586
WHAT HAPPENED. AND TELL US WHY 
THIS WAS THE PATRIOTIC AND THE 

06:09:25.786 --> 06:09:28.746
CONSTITUTIONAL THING TO DO. 
SENATORS, THIS TRIAL IN THE 

06:09:28.966 --> 06:09:33.502
FINAL ANALYSIS IS NOT ABOUT 
DONALD TRUMP. THE COUNTRY IN THE

06:09:33.757 --> 06:09:37.467
WORLD KNOW WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. 
THIS TRIAL IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE. 

06:09:37.681 --> 06:09:39.681
WHO 

06:09:42.686 --> 06:09:49.046
WE ARE. MY FRIEND DARA WILLIAMS 
SAYS THAT SOMETIMES THE TRUTH IS

06:09:49.266 --> 06:09:51.799
LIKE A SECOND CHANCE. WE'VE GOT 
A CHANCE HERE WITH 

06:09:55.226 --> 06:09:59.056
THE TRUTH. WE STILL BELIEVE IN 
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. 

06:09:59.257 --> 06:10:03.086
PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIED TO 
SIDELINE OR RUN OVER EVERY EVER 

06:10:03.296 --> 06:10:05.296
OTHER BRANCH 

06:10:08.517 --> 06:10:10.517
OF GOVERNMENT.

06:10:14.116 --> 06:10:16.116
THIS CASE IS ABOUT WHETHER OUR 
COUNTRY DEMANDS A 

06:10:19.916 --> 06:10:21.549
PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT TRANSFER OF
POWER TO GUARANTEE THE 

06:10:21.550 --> 06:10:26.076
SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE. ARE 
WE GOING TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE OR

06:10:27.092 --> 06:10:30.120
DEFEND US? NOT JUST HONOR THEM 
WITH METALS AS YOU RIGHTFULLY 

06:10:31.353 --> 06:10:37.046
DID YESTERDAY BUT ACTUALLY BACK 
THEM UP AGAINST SAVAGE, BARBARIC

06:10:41.127 --> 06:10:43.127
INSURRECTIONARY VIOLENCE? WILL 
WE RESTORE THE HONOR OF OUR 

06:10:43.258 --> 06:10:45.258
CAPITAL AND THE PEOPLE WHO 

06:10:48.956 --> 06:10:51.026
WORK HERE? WILL WE BE A 
DEMOCRATIC NATION THAT THE WORLD

06:10:51.901 --> 06:10:53.901
LOOKS TO FOR UNDERSTANDING 
DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PRACTICES 

06:10:54.016 --> 06:11:00.006
AND CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT 
AND THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND MEN?

06:11:00.226 --> 06:11:02.226
WELL, THE 

06:11:06.107 --> 06:11:10.906
SENATE CONDONE THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES INCITING AN 

06:11:11.126 --> 06:11:13.126
ATTACK ON OUR CHAMBERS, OUR 
OFFICES, OUR STAFF AND THE 

06:11:13.286 --> 06:11:16.296
OFFICERS WHO PROTECT US? WHEN 
YOU SEE THE FOOTAGE OF OFFICER 

06:11:16.550 --> 06:11:18.626
HODGES STUCK IN THE DOORWAY, 
LITERALLY BEING TORTURED BY 

06:11:23.647 --> 06:11:25.647
THE MOB,

06:11:27.913 --> 06:11:30.066
THE GOVERNMENT DID THAT TOO, 
THAT WOULD BE TORTURE. AND WHEN 

06:11:30.286 --> 06:11:32.687
YOU SEE THAT FOOTAGE AND HE'S 
SHOUTING IN AGONY FOR HIS DEAR 

06:11:32.906 --> 06:11:36.306
LIFE, IT IS ALMOST UNWATCHABLE. 
WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 

06:11:36.527 --> 06:11:38.527
UNITED STATES ESCAPES A VIOLENT 
MOB THAT HAS ENTERED THIS 

06:11:40.466 --> 06:11:42.586
CAPITAL BUILDING, SEEKING TO 
HANG HIM AND CALLING OUT, 

06:11:42.806 --> 06:11:46.454
TRADER, TRADER, TRADER. AND WHEN
THEY 

06:11:51.486 --> 06:11:53.486
SHUT DOWN THE COUNTING OF 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, IS THIS

06:11:53.646 --> 06:11:57.506
THE FUTURE YOU IMAGINED FOR OUR 
KIDS? IS IT TOTALLY APPROPRIATE 

06:11:57.716 --> 06:11:59.716
AS WE'VE BEEN 

06:12:01.516 --> 06:12:05.376
TOLD WHERE OR HIS REPRESENTATIVE
CHENEY SAID IS THAT THE GREATEST

06:12:05.597 --> 06:12:07.687
BETRAYAL OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
OATH OF OFFICE IN THE HISTORY OF

06:12:09.846 --> 06:12:13.026
OUR COUNTRY? AND IF WE CAN'T 
HANDLE THIS TOGETHER AS A 

06:12:13.295 --> 06:12:20.036
PEOPLE, ALL OF US, FORGETTING 
THE LINES OF PARTY AND IDEOLOGY 

06:12:20.236 --> 06:12:23.846
ANGIOGRAPHY AND ALL OF THOSE 
THINGS, IF WE CAN'T HANDLE THIS,

06:12:24.036 --> 06:12:27.847
HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO CONQUER
THE OTHER CRISES OF OUR DAY? IS 

06:12:32.306 --> 06:12:34.687
THIS AMERICA? IS THIS WHAT WE 
WANT TO BEQUEATH TO OUR CHILDREN

06:12:38.426 --> 06:12:40.426
AND GRANDCHILDREN? I WAS NEVER A
GREAT SUNDAY SCHOOL STUDENT. 

06:12:40.586 --> 06:12:42.586
ACTUALLY, I WAS PRETTY TRUANT 
MOST OF THE TIME. BUT 

06:12:47.466 --> 06:12:49.992
ONE MISE LINE ALWAYS STUCK WITH 
ME FROM THE BOOK OF EXODUS AS 

06:12:50.195 --> 06:12:52.507
BOTH BEAUTIFUL AND HAUNTING, 
EVEN AS A KID AFTER I ASKED WHAT

06:12:52.716 --> 06:12:54.716
THE WORDS MEANT. THOU SHALT NOT 
FOLLOW A MULTITUDE TO 

06:12:59.607 --> 06:13:02.929
DO EVIL. THE OFFICER WHO 

06:13:07.947 --> 06:13:09.947
GOT CALLED

06:13:11.717 --> 06:13:13.876
THE N WORD 15 TIMES AND SPENT 
HOURS WITH HIS COLLEAGUES 

06:13:14.096 --> 06:13:15.985
BATTLING INSURRECTIONIST WHO HAD
METAL POLES AND BASEBALL BATS 

06:13:15.986 --> 06:13:17.945
AND HOCKEY STICKS, BEAR SPRAY 
AND CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAGS 

06:13:17.946 --> 06:13:21.801
POSED THE RIGHT QUESTION TO THE 
SENATE AND TO ALL OF US. IS 

06:13:26.766 --> 06:13:31.457
THIS AMERICA? DEAR SENATORS, 
THAT IS GOING TO BE UP TO YOU 

06:13:31.658 --> 06:13:36.126
NOW AND WHAT OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES
YOU ARE ON, WHATEVER YOU CAME TO

06:13:36.346 --> 06:13:39.259
WASHINGTON TO DO TO WORK ON FROM
DEFENSE TO AGRICULTURE TO ENERGY

06:13:39.460 --> 06:13:43.631
TO AEROSPACE TO HEALTHCARE, THIS
IS ALMOST CERTAINLY HOW YOU WILL

06:13:45.932 --> 06:13:47.932
BE REMEMBERED BY HISTORY. THAT 
MIGHT NOT 

06:13:50.916 --> 06:13:53.636
BE FAIR. IT REALLY MIGHT NOT BE 
FAIR BUT NONE OF US CAN ESCAPE 

06:13:53.856 --> 06:13:55.856
THE DEMANDS OF HISTORY AND 
DESTINY 

06:13:59.856 --> 06:14:01.856
RIGHT NOW. OUR REPUTATIONS AND 
OUR LEGACY WILL BE INEXTRICABLY 

06:14:01.946 --> 06:14:05.386
INTERTWINED WITH WHAT WE DO 
HERE. AND WITH HOW YOU EXERCISE 

06:14:06.686 --> 06:14:10.092
YOUR OATH TO DO IMPARTIAL 
JUSTICE. 

06:14:13.246 --> 06:14:17.976
IMPARTIAL JUSTICE. I KNOW AND I 
TRUST YOU WILL DO IMPARTIAL 

06:14:18.178 --> 06:14:19.816
JUSTICE, DRIVEN BY YOUR 
METICULOUS ATTENTION TO THE 

06:14:19.817 --> 06:14:22.787
OVERWHELMING FACTS OF THE CASE 
AND YOUR LOVE FOR OUR 

06:14:23.006 --> 06:14:25.006
CONSTITUTION, WHICH I KNOW 
DWELLS IN 

06:14:29.066 --> 06:14:31.066
YOUR HEART.

06:14:36.716 --> 06:14:38.797
THE NAMESAKE OF MY SON, THE 
TIMES HAVE FOUND US, IS 

06:14:41.993 --> 06:14:44.367
THIS AMERICA, WHAT KIND OF 
AMERICA WILL WE BE? IT IS NOW 

06:14:44.587 --> 06:14:47.415
LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. 
GODSPEED TO THE SENATE OF THE 

06:14:49.106 --> 06:14:51.917
UNITED STATES. WE RESERVE ANY 
REMAINING 

06:14:55.846 --> 06:14:57.846
TIME. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE HOUSE HAS RESERVED 

06:15:01.928 --> 06:15:04.446
28 MINUTES. 

06:15:19.486 --> 06:15:21.486
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

06:15:23.776 --> 06:15:26.706
PROCEED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEFORE I START MY 

06:15:30.086 --> 06:15:32.431
PREPARED CLOSING, I REALLY WANT 
TO CLEAN UP A FEW THINGS FROM 

06:15:32.631 --> 06:15:37.778
THE MESS THAT WAS THE CLOSING OF
THE HOUSE MANAGERS. I DON'T WANT

06:15:38.052 --> 06:15:40.820
TO RUIN MY CLOSING BECAUSE I 
THINK THE ENDING IS PRETTY GOOD.

06:15:40.998 --> 06:15:42.998
WHAT 

06:15:44.256 --> 06:15:46.256
THEY 

06:15:47.866 --> 06:15:49.974
DIDN'T -- THEY STARTED OFF BY 
MISSTATING THE LAW AND THEY 

06:15:50.846 --> 06:15:53.606
STARTED OFF BY MISSTATING THE 
INTENT OF OUR STIPULATION. WHAT 

06:15:53.826 --> 06:15:56.816
WE DID TODAY WAS STIPULATE TO 

06:16:01.503 --> 06:16:03.503
AN ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN
A MAGAZINE. APPARENTLY THEY'VE 

06:16:03.621 --> 06:16:05.712
HAD FOR WEEKS ACCORDING TO THE 
DOCUMENTS THEY PRODUCE TODAY BUT

06:16:05.912 --> 06:16:10.599
FOR SOME REASON THIS MORNING 
POPPED UP WITH IT. THE 

06:16:12.057 --> 06:16:14.057
STIPULATION WAS THAT THEY CAN 
PUT 

06:16:18.086 --> 06:16:20.086
THAT IN.

06:16:21.916 --> 06:16:23.785
DID NOT STIPULATE TO ITS 
CONTENTS FOR TRUTHFULNESS AND 

06:16:23.786 --> 06:16:25.786
THEY TRIED TO PORTRAY THAT IN 
THEIR CLOSING AS THE 

06:16:25.927 --> 06:16:27.831
STIPULATION. THE STIPULATION WAS
READ INTO THE RECORD. THE 

06:16:27.832 --> 06:16:31.019
PROPONENTS OF THAT CONVERSATION,
THE REAL ONES HAVE DENIED ITS 

06:16:31.227 --> 06:16:38.577
CONTENT, ITS VERACITY. WITH 
RESPECT TO -- I'M NOT GOING TO 

06:16:39.227 --> 06:16:41.227
TALK ABOUT THE 

06:16:44.666 --> 06:16:46.666
TORTURED ANALYSIS

06:16:57.107 --> 06:16:59.667
WHAT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS 
THE DOCTORING OF EVIDENCE. FIRST

06:16:59.887 --> 06:17:04.792
OF ALL, THEY SENT US THEIR 
EVIDENCE ON TUESDAY THE NINTH AT

06:17:07.346 --> 06:17:09.346
232 P.M. BY EMAIL. I WAS IN 

06:17:11.846 --> 06:17:13.846
THIS ROOM TRYING THE CASE 
ALREADY WHEN THEY SENT THEIR 

06:17:13.987 --> 06:17:15.987
EVIDENCE, 

06:17:18.427 --> 06:17:21.397
DUE PROCESS. THEY USED EVIDENCE 
THAT WAS FLAT WRONG TWO OR THREE

06:17:21.799 --> 06:17:26.816
NIGHTS AGO WITH SENATOR LEE AND 
HAD TO WITHDRAW IT. THEY TRIED 

06:17:27.033 --> 06:17:33.537
TO USE IT AGAIN TODAY. THEY 
TRIED TO USE EVIDENCE THAT THEY 

06:17:33.757 --> 06:17:37.976
HAD NEVER PRESENTED IN THE CASE 
IN THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENT, THAT 

06:17:38.178 --> 06:17:45.576
IS A VERY DESPERATE ATTEMPT BY 
THE PROSECUTING TEAM LINE OF 

06:17:45.796 --> 06:17:49.585
THEM. BY PROSECUTING TEAM THAT 
NEW THAT THEIR CASE 

06:17:54.567 --> 06:18:02.086
HAS COLLAPSED. THEIR CLOSING DID
NOT MENTION ONE PIECE OF LAW. 

06:18:02.306 --> 06:18:06.718
THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE 
CONSTITUTION ONCE. THEY DIDN'T 

06:18:08.016 --> 06:18:11.748
TALK ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
AND ITS APPLICATION. THEY DIDN'T

06:18:12.396 --> 06:18:17.311
TALK ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND HOW 
IT APPLIES TO THIS PROCEEDING 

06:18:17.460 --> 06:18:19.460
FOR 

06:18:22.467 --> 06:18:24.467
MY CLIENT.

06:18:42.208 --> 06:18:48.597
BASIC RULE OF ANY COURT IS NOT 
WHEN YOU CLOSE A CASE OUT, YOU 

06:18:48.799 --> 06:18:53.931
CLOSE ON THE FACTS THAT WERE 
ADMITTED IN THE TRIAL. IT IS A 

06:18:54.136 --> 06:18:58.926
BASIC FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF 
DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS AND 

06:18:59.185 --> 06:19:01.667
THAT WAS VIOLENTLY BREACHED 
TODAY ON 

06:19:05.238 --> 06:19:08.506
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND YOU HAVE 
TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY? WHY DID 

06:19:09.357 --> 06:19:12.957
THEY RESORT TO THOSE TACTICS AT 
THIS MOMENT 

06:19:17.977 --> 06:19:19.977
IN TIME?

06:19:23.567 --> 06:19:25.567
SENATORS, 

06:19:28.577 --> 06:19:35.757
GOOD AFTERNOON. WHAT TOOK PLACE 
HERE AT THE U.S. CAPITOL ON THE 

06:19:35.957 --> 06:19:38.221
26th THE SIXTH WAS A GREAT 
TRAGEDY OVER THE COURSE OF THIS 

06:19:38.433 --> 06:19:42.627
TRIAL YOU HAVE HEARD ON EITHER 
SIDE OF THIS DEBATE ARGUE THAT 

06:19:42.828 --> 06:19:46.857
THE INFILTRATION OF THE ARGUER 
WAS ANYTHING LESS THAN A HEINOUS

06:19:47.078 --> 06:19:49.408
ACT ON THE HOME OF AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY. ALL 

06:19:54.368 --> 06:19:58.578
OF US STARTING WITH MY CLIENT 
ARE DEEPLY DESERVED BY THE 

06:19:58.801 --> 06:20:00.908
GRAPHIC VIDEOS OF THE CAPITAL 
ATTACK THAT HAD BEEN SHOWN IN 

06:20:03.288 --> 06:20:05.167
RECENT DAYS. THE ENTIRE TEAM 
CONDEMNED AND HAVE REPEATEDLY 

06:20:05.168 --> 06:20:07.168
CONDEMNED THE VIOLENCE AND 
LAWBREAKING THAT OCCURRED ON 

06:20:09.088 --> 06:20:11.088
JANUARY SIXTH ON THE STRONGEST 
POSSIBLE TERMS WE THAT INDICATED

06:20:11.260 --> 06:20:13.260
THAT EVERYBODY BE 

06:20:15.048 --> 06:20:19.278
FOUND, PUNISHED, TO THE MAXIMUM 
EXTENT OF THE LAW. YET, THE 

06:20:19.498 --> 06:20:21.498
QUESTION 

06:20:23.339 --> 06:20:25.409
BEFORE US IS NOT WHETHER THERE 
WAS A VIOLENT INSURRECTION OF 

06:20:26.268 --> 06:20:28.268
THE CAPITAL. ON THAT POINT, 

06:20:30.781 --> 06:20:32.781
EVERYONE AGREES. BASED ON THE 
EXPLICIT TEXT OF THE HOUSE 

06:20:32.877 --> 06:20:37.959
IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE, THIS TRIAL 
IS ABOUT WHETHER MR. TRUMP WILL 

06:20:39.839 --> 06:20:43.589
FULLY ENGAGED IN INCITEMENT OF 
VIOLENCE AND EVEN INSURRECTION 

06:20:43.809 --> 06:20:45.809
AGAINST THE 

06:20:49.046 --> 06:20:52.189
UNITED STATES. AND THAT 
QUESTION, THEY HAVE POSED IN 

06:20:52.409 --> 06:20:54.939
THEIR ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT HAS
TO BE SET UP AGAINST THE LAW OF 

06:20:57.455 --> 06:21:03.029
THIS COUNTRY. NO MATTER HOW MUCH
TRULY HORRIFYING FOOTAGE WE SEE 

06:21:03.243 --> 06:21:07.709
OF THE CONDUCT OF THE RIOTERS 
AND HOW MUCH EMOTION HAS BEEN 

06:21:07.929 --> 06:21:12.630
INJECTED INTO THIS TRIAL, THAT 
DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT 

06:21:12.849 --> 06:21:18.260
MR. TRUMP IS INNOCENT OF THE 
CHARGES AGAINST HIM. DESPITE ALL

06:21:18.460 --> 06:21:20.460
OF THE 

06:21:21.800 --> 06:21:23.870
VIDEO PLAYED AT NO POINT IN 
THEIR PRESENTATION DID YOU HEAR 

06:21:24.090 --> 06:21:29.434
THE HOUSE MANAGERS PLAY A SINGLE
EXAMPLE OF MR. TRUMP URGING 

06:21:29.634 --> 06:21:32.249
ANYONE TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE OF 

06:21:36.360 --> 06:21:40.400
ANY KIND. AT NO POINT DID YOU 
HEAR ANYTHING THAT COULD EVER 

06:21:40.610 --> 06:21:42.610
POSSIBLY BE CONSTRUED AS MR. 
TRUMP ENCOURAGING OR SANCTIONING

06:21:46.980 --> 06:21:48.980
AN INSURRECTION. SENATORS, YOU 
DID NOT HEAR THOSE TAPES BECAUSE

06:21:49.060 --> 06:21:54.331
THEY DO NOT EXIST. BECAUSE THE 
ACT OF INCITEMENT NEVER 

06:21:54.597 --> 06:21:59.630
HAPPENED. HE ENGAGED IN THE 
LANGUAGE OF INCITEMENT 

06:21:59.850 --> 06:22:01.989
WHATSOEVER ON JANUARY 6th OR ANY
OTHER DAY FOLLOWING THE 

06:22:02.191 --> 06:22:04.191
ELECTION.  NO 

06:22:07.631 --> 06:22:09.640
UNBIASED PERSON HONESTLY 
REVIEWING THE TRANSCRIPT OF MR. 

06:22:09.861 --> 06:22:11.861
TRUMP'S SPEECH ON THE ELLIPSE 
COULD 

06:22:14.051 --> 06:22:15.769
POSSIBLY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS 
SUGGESTING VIOLENCE. HE 

06:22:15.770 --> 06:22:17.770
EXPLICITLY TOLD THE CROWD THAT 
HE EXPECTED THE PROTESTS OUTSIDE

06:22:17.863 --> 06:22:21.502
THE CAPITAL TO BE PEACEFUL AND 
PATRIOTIC. THEY CLAIM THAT IS 

06:22:25.771 --> 06:22:27.911
NOT ENOUGH. HIS ENTIRE PREMISE 
WAS THAT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 

06:22:28.131 --> 06:22:30.898
JOINT SESSION SHOULD CONTINUE. 
HE SPENT NEARLY THE ENTIRE 

06:22:31.098 --> 06:22:34.243
SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HOW HE 
BELIEVES THE SENATORS AND 

06:22:34.443 --> 06:22:36.443
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SHOULD VOTE 
ON 

06:22:40.511 --> 06:22:45.422
THE MATTER. THE SUPREME COURT 
RULED IN BRANDENBURG THAT THERE 

06:22:45.641 --> 06:22:47.641
IS A VERY CLEAR STANDARD 

06:22:51.193 --> 06:22:54.351
FOR INCITEMENT. IN SHORT, YOU 
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WORDS 

06:22:54.571 --> 06:22:56.858
THEMSELVES. THE WORDS HAVE TO 
EITHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY 

06:22:57.059 --> 06:23:02.432
CALL FOR THE WORDS. CALL FOR 
LAWLESSNESS OR VIOLENCE. WHETHER

06:23:07.322 --> 06:23:09.322
THE SPEECH, YOU HAVE TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER THE SPEECH WAS

06:23:09.412 --> 06:23:11.412
INTENDED TO PROVOKE THE 
LAWLESSNESS AND WHETHER THE 

06:23:11.582 --> 06:23:15.963
VIOLENCE WAS THE LIKELY RESULT 
OF THE WORD ITSELF. THEY FAIL ON

06:23:16.182 --> 06:23:18.182
ALL 

06:23:21.192 --> 06:23:25.222
THREE PRONGS. THE CLAIM THAT HE 
GAVE A SPEECH ENCOURAGING HIS 

06:23:25.436 --> 06:23:27.562
SUPPORTERS TO GO ATTACK THE 
CAPITAL HAS BEEN REPEATED SO 

06:23:27.782 --> 06:23:32.372
OFTEN, UNCRITICALLY, WITHOUT ANY
EXAMINATION OF THE EXAMINATION 

06:23:32.592 --> 06:23:36.012
FAX THAT THE AMERICANS LISTENING
AT HOME WERE PROBABLY SURPRISED 

06:23:36.232 --> 06:23:38.232
TO LEARN IT IS 

06:23:41.462 --> 06:23:46.072
NOT TRUE. FURTHERMORE, SOME OF 
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM FOLLOWED

06:23:46.292 --> 06:23:48.452
HIS STATEMENTS IN THE WEEKS 
LEADING UP TO JANUARY SIX VERY 

06:23:48.652 --> 06:23:51.158
CLOSELY. WE KNOW THAT HE WAS NOT
TRYING TO FOMENT AN INSURRECTION

06:23:51.357 --> 06:23:55.766
DURING THE TIME BECAUSE NO ONE 
FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE TO

06:23:55.965 --> 06:23:57.965
THE MAYOR OF WASHINGTON 

06:24:00.937 --> 06:24:02.937
DC BEHAVED IN A FASHION 
CONSISTENT WITH THE BELIEF THAT 

06:24:02.966 --> 06:24:04.966
VIOLENCE WAS BEING 

06:24:08.368 --> 06:24:10.368
ADVOCATED FOR.

06:24:12.099 --> 06:24:14.183
MR. TRUMP DID NOT SPEND THE 
WEEKS PRIOR TO JANUARY SIXTH 

06:24:14.384 --> 06:24:16.248
INCITING VIOLENCE. HE SPENT 
THOSE WEEKS PURSUING HIS 

06:24:16.249 --> 06:24:18.104
ELECTION CHALLENGE TO THE COURT 
SYSTEM AND OTHER LEGAL 

06:24:18.105 --> 06:24:20.105
PROCEDURES EXACTLY AS THE 
CONSTITUTION AND THE 

06:24:24.024 --> 06:24:26.024
CONGRESS PRESCRIBED. TO BELIEVE 
BASED ON THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE 

06:24:26.084 --> 06:24:29.223
SEEN THAT MR. TRUMP ACTUALLY 
WANTED AND INDEED WILLFULLY 

06:24:29.474 --> 06:24:31.906
INCITED AN INSURRECTION TO 
OVERTHROW THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 

06:24:32.107 --> 06:24:34.107
WOULD 

06:24:37.123 --> 06:24:40.265
BE ABSURD. THE GATHERING ON 
JANUARY SIXTH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

06:24:40.464 --> 06:24:45.403
AN ENTIRELY PEACEFUL EVENT. 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 

06:24:45.603 --> 06:24:47.603
PEOPLE, INCLUDING MR. TRUMP, 
SHOWED UP THAT DAY WITH 

06:24:50.523 --> 06:24:52.523
THAT INTENTION. A SMALL 
PERCENTAGE, A SMALL FRACTION OF 

06:24:53.952 --> 06:24:55.952
THOSE PEOPLE THEN ENGAGED IN 
TRULY 

06:24:58.143 --> 06:25:01.713
HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR, BUT AS WE NOW
KNOW, THAT THOSE ACTORS WERE 

06:25:06.443 --> 06:25:09.433
PREPLANNED AND PREMEDITATED AND 
ACTED EVEN BEFORE THE SPEECH WAS

06:25:09.653 --> 06:25:14.373
COMPLETED TO WHICH IS THE BASIS 
OF THE ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT. 

06:25:16.473 --> 06:25:21.793
IT WAS PREPLANNED AND 
PREMEDITATED BY FRIENDS LEFT AND

06:25:26.814 --> 06:25:28.814
RIGHT GROUPS.

06:25:32.403 --> 06:25:34.123
THE HOUSE MANAGERS FALSE 
NARRATIVE IS A BRAZENLY 

06:25:34.124 --> 06:25:39.710
DISHONEST ATTEMPT TO SMEAR, TO 
CANCEL CONSTITUTIONAL CANCEL 

06:25:39.924 --> 06:25:43.090
CULTURE, THEIR NUMBER ONE 
POLITICAL OPPONENT TAKING 

06:25:48.054 --> 06:25:49.742
NEUTRAL STATEMENTS TAKING 
POLITICAL RHETORIC, REMOVING 

06:25:49.743 --> 06:25:53.492
WORDS AND FACTS FROM CONTEXT AND
ASCRIBING TO THEM THE MOST 

06:25:53.758 --> 06:25:55.758
SINISTER 

06:25:57.704 --> 06:26:00.713
INTENTIONS POSSIBLE. THEIR STORY
WAS BASED NOT ON EVIDENCE, BUT 

06:26:00.934 --> 06:26:02.934
ON THE SHEER PERSONAL AND 

06:26:06.834 --> 06:26:09.593
POLITICAL ANIMUS. THE FLIMSY 
THEORY OF INCITEMENT YOU HEARD 

06:26:09.794 --> 06:26:15.824
FROM THE HOUSE MANAGERS COULD BE
USED TO IMPEACH, INDICT OR EXPEL

06:26:16.044 --> 06:26:18.044
COUNTLESS OTHER 

06:26:21.254 --> 06:26:23.254
POLITICAL LEADERS. MANY LEADING 
FIGURES AND OTHER PARTIES HAVE 

06:26:23.274 --> 06:26:25.274
ENGAGED IN FAR MORE INCENDIARY 
AND 

06:26:30.254 --> 06:26:32.254
DANGEROUS RHETORIC.

06:26:35.964 --> 06:26:38.714
AND WE PLAYED SOME OF THEM. ARE 
NOT GOING TO REPLAY IT. I'M NOT 

06:26:38.924 --> 06:26:41.194
GOING TO REPLAY YOU THE WORDS, 
YOU ALL SAW THE EVIDENCE. I'M 

06:26:41.414 --> 06:26:43.726
NOT GOING TO REPLAY YOU MOB 
SEEMS. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE 

06:26:43.939 --> 06:26:45.939
THOSE PEOPLE AT OTHER PLATFORM, 
ANYMORE VIEW FROM THE AMERICAN 

06:26:46.164 --> 06:26:48.164
PEOPLE AS TO WHAT THEY DID. THEY
SHOULD 

06:26:52.004 --> 06:26:54.004
BE CANCELED. 

06:26:56.684 --> 06:26:58.353
DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS SPENT 
MONTHS PRIOR TO JANUARY SIXTH 

06:26:58.354 --> 06:27:02.647
ATTACKING THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF
OUR NATION'S MOST CHERISHED 

06:27:02.862 --> 06:27:05.375
INSTITUTIONS AND TRADITIONS. 
THEY DIDN'T JUST QUESTION THE 

06:27:05.815 --> 06:27:09.295
INTEGRITY OF ONE ELECTION, THEY 
CHALLENGED THE INTEGRITY OF OUR 

06:27:10.813 --> 06:27:12.813
ENTIRE NATION. EVERYTHING FROM 
OUR 

06:27:14.725 --> 06:27:16.725
FOUNDING FATHERS, OUR 
CONSTITUTION DECLARATION 

06:27:18.594 --> 06:27:22.644
OF INDEPENDENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS AND UNITED STATES 

06:27:22.854 --> 06:27:25.812
MILITARY. THEY SAID THAT OUR 
SOCIETY WAS ROOTED IN HATRED. 

06:27:26.013 --> 06:27:30.001
THEY EVEN SAID THAT AMERICA 
DESERVED, AND I WILL QUOTE, 

06:27:33.464 --> 06:27:37.112
A RECKONING. AS YOU HEARD 
YESTERDAY THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER,

06:27:37.312 --> 06:27:39.312
DEMOCRAT LEADERS INCLUDING THE 
CURRENT PRESIDENT AND VICE 

06:27:40.625 --> 06:27:44.135
PRESIDENT REPEATEDLY MADE 
COMMENTS THAT PROVIDED MORAL 

06:27:44.355 --> 06:27:50.091
COMFORT TO MOBS ATTACKING POLICE
OFFICERS. DURING THAT TIME, MANY

06:27:50.294 --> 06:27:56.466
OFFICERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE
INJURED. AS WE ALL KNOW TWO 

06:27:56.668 --> 06:28:00.085
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES IN LOS 
ANGELES WERE AMBUSHED AND SHOT 

06:28:00.298 --> 06:28:06.709
AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. MEMBERS OF
THIS VERY BODY HAVE BEEN IN 

06:28:06.925 --> 06:28:10.643
DANGER. SENATORS FROM MAINE TO 
KENTUCKY AND MOST POINTS IN 

06:28:10.957 --> 06:28:12.957
BETWEEN HAVE BEEN HARASSED 

06:28:17.175 --> 06:28:20.644
BY MOBS. LAST AUGUST, A MENACING
LEFT-WING MOB SWARMED SENATOR 

06:28:20.865 --> 06:28:22.865
RAND PAUL AND HIS WIFE AS 

06:28:24.905 --> 06:28:28.975
THEY LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
THEY HAD TO BE RESCUED BY 

06:28:29.225 --> 06:28:32.154
POLICE. FOR MONTHS, OUR FEDERAL 
COURTHOUSE IN PORTLAND WAS 

06:28:32.355 --> 06:28:36.295
PLACED UNDER SIEGE BY VIOLENT 
ANARCHISTS WHO ATTACKED LAW 

06:28:37.162 --> 06:28:42.256
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DAILY AND 
REPEATEDLY AND TRIED TO SET FIRE

06:28:42.470 --> 06:28:49.186
TO THE BUILDING. SPEAKER PELOSI 
DID NOT CALL THE VIOLENT SIEGE 

06:28:49.388 --> 06:28:52.630
OF THE FEDERAL BUILDING 
INSURRECTION. SHE CALLED THE 

06:28:52.956 --> 06:28:54.956
FEDERAL AGENTS PROTECTING THE 

06:28:57.655 --> 06:29:04.045
COURTHOUSE QUOTE STORM TROOPERS.
THEY WERE BESIEGED BY MOBS 

06:29:06.659 --> 06:29:08.365
THROUGH BRICKS, ROCKS AND 
BOTTLES AT SECRET SERVICE 

06:29:08.366 --> 06:29:10.366
AGENTS. SET FIRE TO A 

06:29:14.036 --> 06:29:16.036
HISTORIC STRUCTURE

06:29:20.247 --> 06:29:22.247
WHEN MY CLIENT ADMINISTRATION 
SENT IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO 

06:29:22.307 --> 06:29:25.010
SECURE THE NATION'S CAPITAL CITY
ADMITS THE VIOLENCE DEMOCRAT 

06:29:26.095 --> 06:29:28.095
LEADERS DEMANDED THAT THE FORCES

06:29:31.675 --> 06:29:33.834
BE WITHDRAWN. THE WASHINGTON DC 
MAYOR SAID THE PRESENCE OF THE 

06:29:34.475 --> 06:29:37.975
NATIONAL GUARD WASN'T A FRONT TO
THE SAFETY OF THE DISTRICT 

06:29:44.115 --> 06:29:50.716
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TOOK AN INADEQUATE AND 
IRRESPONSIBLE FORCE POSTURE ON 

06:29:50.925 --> 06:29:53.945
JANUARY 6th BECAUSE OF THEIR 
COMMITMENT TO THE FALSE 

06:29:54.160 --> 06:29:57.916
NARRATIVE OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST 
JUNE. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN ALL NOW 

06:29:58.046 --> 06:30:00.046
AGREE

06:30:02.956 --> 06:30:04.915
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ACTED 
PROPERLY BY TAKING ACTION TO 

06:30:04.916 --> 06:30:10.056
STOP A RIOTOUS MOB, ESTABLISHING
AN APPROPRIATE SECURITY 

06:30:10.276 --> 06:30:12.566
PERIMETER, AND PREVENT THE WHITE
HOUSE FROM POTENTIALLY BEING 

06:30:12.707 --> 06:30:14.707
OVERRUN.

06:30:20.847 --> 06:30:26.737
ISSUING A DELAY IN ISSUING A 
STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

06:30:26.958 --> 06:30:31.218
SOMEHOW EVIDENCE THAT HE 
CONSENTED OR SUPPORTED THE 

06:30:31.358 --> 06:30:38.748
VIOLENCE. JOE BIDEN, KAMALA 
HARRIS, AND COUNTLESS OTHERS 

06:30:38.968 --> 06:30:40.968
REPEATEDLY CONFUSED TO CONDEMN 
THE EXTREMISTS

06:30:45.058 --> 06:30:47.549
, AS RIOTS WERE CONTINUING 
DAILY, AND BUSINESSES WERE BEING

06:30:47.689 --> 06:30:52.349
RAMSHACKLE, AS NEIGHBORHOODS 
WERE BEING BURNED. AS BOMBS WERE

06:30:52.489 --> 06:30:54.489
EXPLODING.

06:30:55.954 --> 06:30:57.898
THEY REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO TELL 
THEIR VIOLENT SUPPORTERS TO 

06:30:57.899 --> 06:31:03.544
STAND DOWN. SOME EVEN SUGGESTED 
THAT THE MOBS ACTIONS WERE 

06:31:03.691 --> 06:31:08.530
JUSTIFIED. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS
LITERALLY URGED HER FOLLOWERS TO

06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:13.920
DONATE MONEY TO A FUND TO BAIL 
OUT THE VIOLENT EXTREME RIOTERS

06:31:16.960 --> 06:31:21.211
SO THAT THEY COULD GET OUT AND 
CONTINUE TO DO IT OVER AND OVER 

06:31:21.351 --> 06:31:23.351
AGAIN.

06:31:24.811 --> 06:31:28.931
SHE LATER SAID THAT THOSE FOLKS 
WERE NOT GOING TO LET UP, AND 

06:31:29.151 --> 06:31:36.116
THAT THEY SHOULD NOT. ALL OF 
THIS WAS FAR CLOSER 

06:31:36.992 --> 06:31:41.292
ACTUAL DEFINITION OF INCITEMENT,
THEN ANYTHING PRESIDENT TRUMP 

06:31:41.512 --> 06:31:47.162
HAS EVER SAID OR DONE, NEVERMIND
WHAT HE SAID ON THE SIXTH. IT IS

06:31:47.922 --> 06:31:49.922
A HYPOCRISY

06:31:52.862 --> 06:31:57.333
, THAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE 
LAID AT THE FEET OF THIS 

06:31:57.473 --> 06:31:59.473
CHAMBER.

06:32:02.933 --> 06:32:04.933
THE HOUSE MANAGER SUGGESTED IN

06:32:08.414 --> 06:32:11.709
-- THAT THIS RECENT HISTORY IS 
IRRELEVANT TO THE CURRENT 

06:32:12.124 --> 06:32:17.132
PROCEEDINGS. BUT, NOT ONLY IS 
THE DEMOCRATS BEHAVIOR 

06:32:17.354 --> 06:32:22.140
SURROUNDING LAST YEAR'S RIOTS 
HIGHLY RELEVANT AS PRESIDENT, 

06:32:22.364 --> 06:32:24.564
AND NOT ONLY DOES IT REVEAL THE 
DISHONESTY AND INSINCERITY OF 

06:32:24.784 --> 06:32:29.110
THIS ENTIRE ENDEAVOR, IT ALSO 
PROVIDES CRUCIAL CONTEXT THAT 

06:32:29.875 --> 06:32:34.335
SHOULD INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON

06:32:35.095 --> 06:32:37.095
JANUARY 6th.

06:32:40.605 --> 06:32:42.605
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
INFILTRATED 

06:32:44.936 --> 06:32:47.781
IT SEEMS, THEY THOUGHT THAT IT 
WAS ALL A GAME. THEY APPARENTLY

06:32:53.646 --> 06:32:55.185
BELIEVE THAT VIOLENT MOBS, 
DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, 

06:32:55.186 --> 06:32:57.186
RIOTING, ASSAULTING POLICE, AND 
VANDALIZING HISTORIC TREASURES 

06:32:57.376 --> 06:33:04.177
WAS SOMEHOW NOT ACCEPTABLE IN 
THE UNITED STATES. WHERE MIGHT 

06:33:04.397 --> 06:33:06.397
THEY HAVE GOTTEN THAT IDEA?

06:33:09.677 --> 06:33:13.167
I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT IT 
WAS NOT FROM MR. TRUMP. IT WAS 

06:33:13.387 --> 06:33:18.518
NOT MR. TRUMP, IT WAS NOT ANYONE
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT 

06:33:18.668 --> 06:33:23.038
SPENT SIX MONTHS IMMEDIATELY 
PRIOR TO THE CAPITAL ASSAULT 

06:33:24.018 --> 06:33:26.018
GIVING

06:33:28.238 --> 06:33:30.238
RHETORICAL AID AND COMFORT TO 
MOBS, MAKING EXCUSES FOR 

06:33:30.428 --> 06:33:34.389
RIOTERS, CELEBRATING RADICALISM 
AND EXPLAINING THAT

06:33:38.639 --> 06:33:39.938
ANGRY, FRUSTRATED, AND 
MARGINALIZED PEOPLE WERE 

06:33:39.939 --> 06:33:44.959
ENTITLED TO BLOW OFF STEAM LIKE 
DEATH. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. 

06:33:45.399 --> 06:33:47.530
THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE FOR 
DEPRAVED ACTIONS OF THE RIOTERS 

06:33:47.750 --> 06:33:52.940
HERE AT THE CAPITAL, OR ANYWHERE
ELSE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 100% 

06:33:53.160 --> 06:33:58.265
OF THOSE GUILTY OF COMMITTING 
CRIMES DESERVE LENGTHY PRISON 

06:33:58.400 --> 06:34:02.770
SENTENCES FOR THEIR SHAMEFUL AND
DEPRAVED CONDUCT. BUT, THIS

06:34:05.970 --> 06:34:07.970
TRIAL HAS RAISED THE QUESTION 
ABOUT WORDS, ACTIONS, AND 

06:34:08.491 --> 06:34:13.781
CONSEQUENT SIS. AS A NATION, WE 
MUST ASK OURSELVES, HOW DID WE 

06:34:14.001 --> 06:34:15.980
ARRIVE AT THIS PLACE, WHERE 
RIOTING AND PILLAGING WOULD 

06:34:15.981 --> 06:34:21.359
BECOME COMMONPLACE? I SUBMIT TO 
YOU, THAT IT WAS MONTH AFTER 

06:34:21.492 --> 06:34:26.672
MONTH OF POLITICAL LEADERS AND 
MEDIA PERSONALITIES BLOODTHIRSTY

06:34:27.432 --> 06:34:34.632
FOR RATINGS, GLORIFYING CIVIL 
UNREST AND

06:34:42.642 --> 06:34:46.803
ATTACKING MEASURES THAT ARE 
REQUIRED TO QUELL VIOLENT MOBS. 

06:34:47.243 --> 06:34:49.182
HOPEFULLY WE CAN LEAVE THIS 
CHAMBER IN UNIFORM AGREEMENT 

06:34:49.183 --> 06:34:51.923
THAT ALL RIOTING IS BAD. AND 
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DESERVES 

06:34:52.363 --> 06:34:54.363
OUR RESPECT AND SUPPORT

06:34:56.648 --> 06:35:02.424
. THAT HAS BEEN MR. TRUMP'S 
POSITION FROM THE BEGINNING. THE

06:35:02.638 --> 06:35:05.599
REAL QUESTION IN THIS CASE IS, 
WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE 

06:35:05.804 --> 06:35:09.404
FOR SUCH ACT OF MAYHEM AND 
VIOLENCE WHEN THEY ARE 

06:35:09.544 --> 06:35:14.384
COMMITTED. HOUSE DEMOCRATS WANT 
TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS. ONE FOR 

06:35:14.514 --> 06:35:20.064
THEMSELVES, AND ONE FOR THEIR 
POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THEY HAVE 

06:35:20.284 --> 06:35:21.783
CARRIED OUT A GROSSLY 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL EFFORT TO 

06:35:21.784 --> 06:35:28.484
PUNISH MR. TRUMP FOR PROTECTED 
FIRST AMENDMENT SPEECH. IT IS AN

06:35:28.704 --> 06:35:31.765
EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF HIS 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, SINCE HE 

06:35:32.204 --> 06:35:35.925
UTTERED NOT A SINGLE WORD 
ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE, THIS 

06:35:36.145 --> 06:35:38.575
ACTION CAN ONLY BE SEEN AS AN 
EFFORT TO

06:35:43.105 --> 06:35:44.644
CENSOR DISFAVORED POLITICAL 
SPEECH, AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

06:35:44.645 --> 06:35:46.645
A DISAPPROVED VIEWPOINT. IT IS 
AN UNPRECEDENTED ACTION,

06:35:47.965 --> 06:35:50.925
WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DO GRAVE 
AND LASTING DAMAGE TO BOTH THE 

06:35:51.095 --> 06:35:58.325
PRESIDENCY, AND THE SEPARATION 
OF POWERS, AND THE FUTURE OF 

06:35:59.086 --> 06:36:01.086
DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNMENT.

06:36:06.126 --> 06:36:08.326
YESTERDAY, WE PLAYED YOU A VIDEO
OF COUNTLESS DEMOCRAT MEMBERS OF

06:36:08.546 --> 06:36:10.525
THE SENATE URGING THEIR 
SUPPORTERS TO FIGHT. WE SHOWED 

06:36:10.526 --> 06:36:12.726
YOU THOSE VIDEOS NOT BECAUSE WE 
THINK YOU SHOULD BE FORCIBLY 

06:36:12.946 --> 06:36:16.506
REMOVED FROM OFFICE FOR SAYING 
THOSE THINGS, BUT BECAUSE YOU 

06:36:16.646 --> 06:36:19.746
KNOW YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCIBLY 
REMOVED FROM OFFICE FOR SAYING 

06:36:20.506 --> 06:36:25.967
THOSE THINGS. BUT, RECOGNIZING 
THE HYPOCRISY

06:36:33.617 --> 06:36:38.267
YESTERDAY, IN QUESTIONING, HOUSE
REPRESENTATIVE RASKIN ADMITTED 

06:36:38.397 --> 06:36:40.397
THAT

06:36:43.587 --> 06:36:45.526
DEMOCRATS HAD INVENTED AN 
ENTIRELY NEW LEGAL STANDARD. IN 

06:36:45.527 --> 06:36:48.037
FACT, THEY HAVE CREATED A NEW 
LEGAL THEORY. THE RASKIN 

06:36:48.167 --> 06:36:52.717
DOCTRINE. THE RASKIN DOCTRINE IS
BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN

06:36:59.177 --> 06:37:01.177
DETERMINING PROTECTED SPEECH 
BASED ON THE PARTY LABEL NEXT TO

06:37:01.348 --> 06:37:03.748
YOUR NAME. REGARDLESS OF WHAT 
YOU HAVE HEARD OR SEEN FROM THE 

06:37:03.968 --> 06:37:06.348
HOUSE MANAGERS, IF YOU PAY CLOSE
ATTENTION, YOU WILL SEE THAT ANY

06:37:06.558 --> 06:37:09.968
SPEECH MADE BY DEMOCRAT ELECTED 
OFFICIALS IS PROTECTED SPEECH, 

06:37:10.408 --> 06:37:13.918
WHILE ANY SPEECH MADE BY 
REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS IS 

06:37:14.678 --> 06:37:16.678
NOT PROTECTED.

06:37:18.278 --> 06:37:21.448
THE CREATION OF THE RASKIN 
DOCTRINE ACTUALLY REVEALS THE 

06:37:21.578 --> 06:37:23.578
WEAKNESS

06:37:26.558 --> 06:37:31.479
OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS CASE. WE 
REVIEWED THIS IN DEPTH 

06:37:31.609 --> 06:37:36.699
YESTERDAY. UNDER SUPREME COURT 
PRECEDENT

06:37:41.149 --> 06:37:44.429
-- BY THE WAY, BOND DID NOT BURN
HIS DRAFT CARD, HE HAD IT AS A 

06:37:44.649 --> 06:37:46.829
PART OF HIS DEFENSE. BUT IN 
BOND, AND INWOOD, THE COURT 

06:37:47.589 --> 06:37:51.119
CLEARLY DIRECTED ALL TO KNOW 
THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS HOLD THE 

06:37:51.289 --> 06:37:53.289
HIGHEST PROTECTIONS OF SPEECH.

06:37:56.430 --> 06:38:00.969
THE HIGHEST PROTECTIONS, AND I 
REMIND YOU WHY. BECAUSE, YOU ALL

06:38:01.190 --> 06:38:07.965
NEED TO BE FREE TO HAVE ROBUST 
POLITICAL DISCUSSION, BECAUSE 

06:38:08.730 --> 06:38:10.730
YOUR DISCUSSION

06:38:12.670 --> 06:38:14.870
IS ABOUT HOW OUR LIVES ARE GOING
TO GO.

06:38:20.970 --> 06:38:22.909
AND, THAT SHOULD NOT BE 
SQUELCHED BY ANY POLITICAL 

06:38:22.910 --> 06:38:27.931
PARTY. ON EITHER SIDE OF THE 
AISLE, NO MATTER WHO IS THE 

06:38:28.150 --> 06:38:30.150
MAJORITY PARTY AT THE TIME.

06:38:33.790 --> 06:38:35.790
WHY WOULD THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
MAKE UP THEIR OWN LEGAL 

06:38:35.981 --> 06:38:40.749
STANDARD? I WILL TELL YOU WHY. 
BECAUSE, THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT 

06:38:40.951 --> 06:38:45.091
SATISFY THE EXISTING 
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD SET 

06:38:45.311 --> 06:38:47.741
FORTH BY THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT, WHICH HAS EXISTED

06:38:49.921 --> 06:38:54.721
FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY. 
THEY ARGUE

06:38:58.611 --> 06:39:00.781
THAT MR. TRUMP IS AN ELECTED 
OFFICIAL HAS NO FIRST AMENDMENT 

06:39:01.002 --> 06:39:06.231
RIGHTS. IT IS THE COMPLETE 
OPPOSITE OF THE LAW. WE HAVE 

06:39:06.452 --> 06:39:10.632
SHOWN YOU, WITHOUT 
CONTRADICTION, THAT IS WRONG. 

06:39:11.072 --> 06:39:13.802
THEY ALSO KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT 
SATISFY THE THREE-PART TEST OF 

06:39:13.932 --> 06:39:19.642
BRANDENBURG, AS ELUCIDATED IN 
THE BIBLE BELIEVERS CASE.

06:39:23.120 --> 06:39:25.522
WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT 
MR. TRUMP'S WORDS WERE DIRECTED 

06:39:26.292 --> 06:39:29.062
TO INCITING IMMINENT LAWLESS 
ACTION.

06:39:33.283 --> 06:39:35.458
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT MR. 
TRUMP INTENDED HIS WORDS TO 

06:39:36.223 --> 06:39:38.733
INCITE VIOLENCE, AND THE 
VIOLENCE WAS

06:39:43.493 --> 06:39:45.683
PREPLANNED AND PREMEDITATED BY A
GROUP OF LAWLESS ACTORS WHO MUST

06:39:45.903 --> 06:39:49.413
BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST 
EXTENT OF THE LAW, BUT IT PROVES

06:39:49.633 --> 06:39:52.813
THAT HIS WORDS WEREN'T WHAT SET 
THIS INTO MOTION. WHAT WAS THE 

06:39:53.023 --> 06:39:55.023
INCITEMENT? WITH NO ABILITY

06:39:58.043 --> 06:40:00.134
AND NO EVIDENCE TO SATISFY THE 
EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL 

06:40:00.273 --> 06:40:06.593
STANDARDS, WHAT OUR HOUSE 
MANAGERS TO DO? THEY HAD TO MAKE

06:40:06.813 --> 06:40:12.473
UP THEIR OWN LAW. THIS IS NOT 
ONLY INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST, 

06:40:12.915 --> 06:40:14.915
FOLKS, IT IS DOWNRIGHT SCARY.

06:40:20.604 --> 06:40:23.764
WHAT TYPE OF PRECEDENT WOULD BE 
SET IF THE SENATE DID VOTE TO 

06:40:23.894 --> 06:40:26.494
CONVICT. CAN CONGRESS NOW IGNORE
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT ON THE 

06:40:27.254 --> 06:40:29.254
CONTOURS OF PROTECTED FREE 
SPEECH?

06:40:32.804 --> 06:40:34.804
WILL CONGRESS BE PERMITTED TO 
CONTINUALLY MAKE UP THEIR OWN 

06:40:34.969 --> 06:40:38.034
LEGAL STANDARDS, AND APPLY THOSE
NEW STANDARDS TO ELECTED 

06:40:38.794 --> 06:40:40.794
OFFICIALS SPEECH?

06:40:45.050 --> 06:40:47.444
THIS WOULD ALLOW CONGRESS TO USE
THE AWESOME IMPEACHMENT POWER

06:40:51.374 --> 06:40:53.374
AS A WEAPON TO IMPEACH THEIR 
FELLOW COLLEAGUES IN THE 

06:40:53.554 --> 06:40:57.264
OPPOSING PARTY. THIS IS NOT A 
PRESIDENT THAT THIS SENATE CAN 

06:40:57.485 --> 06:40:59.485
SET HERE TODAY.

06:41:02.724 --> 06:41:05.115
IF THE SENATE ENDORSES THE HOUSE
DEMOCRATS ABSURD NEW THEORY, YOU

06:41:05.335 --> 06:41:08.465
WILL SET A PRECEDENT THAT WILL 
TROUBLE LEADERS FROM BOTH 

06:41:08.595 --> 06:41:12.985
PARTIES, LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES
TO COME.

06:41:19.306 --> 06:41:21.306
BUT, THAT WILL NOT BE THE ONLY

06:41:26.755 --> 06:41:28.755
DISGRACEFUL PRESIDENTS TO COME 
FROM THIS CASE. THIS HAS BEEN, 

06:41:28.865 --> 06:41:30.614
PERHAPS, THE MOST UNFAIR AND 
FLAGRANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

06:41:30.615 --> 06:41:32.805
PROCEEDING IN THE HISTORY OF THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.

06:41:39.985 --> 06:41:42.146
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, 
CONGRESS HAS ASSERTED THE RIGHT 

06:41:42.356 --> 06:41:45.156
TO TRY AND PUNISH A FORMER 
PRESIDENT WHO IS A PRIVATE 

06:41:45.916 --> 06:41:47.916
CITIZEN. NOWHERE

06:41:51.916 --> 06:41:53.916
, IN THE CONSTITUTION, IS THE 
POWER ENUMERATED OR IMPLIED. 

06:41:54.116 --> 06:41:56.286
CONGRESS HAS NO AUTHORITY, NO 
RIGHT, AND NO BUSINESS HOLDING A

06:41:56.506 --> 06:42:01.236
TRIAL OF CITIZEN TRUMP, LET 
ALONE A TRIAL TO DEPRIVE HIM OF 

06:42:01.456 --> 06:42:05.596
SOME FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL RIGHTS. 
THERE WAS MENTION OF A JANUARY 

06:42:06.356 --> 06:42:12.586
EXCEPTION ARGUMENT. THE JANUARY 
EXCEPTION ARGUMENT IS A CREATION

06:42:12.806 --> 06:42:18.246
OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS OWN 
CONDUCT, BY DELAYING. THEY SAT 

06:42:18.466 --> 06:42:24.117
ON THE ARTICLE. THEY COULD HAVE 
TRIED THE PRESIDENT WHILE HE WAS

06:42:24.336 --> 06:42:26.736
STILL IN OFFICE, IF THEY REALLY 
BELIEVED HE WAS AN IMMINENT 

06:42:26.941 --> 06:42:32.937
THREAT. THEY DID NOT. THE 
JANUARY EXCEPTION IS A RED 

06:42:33.097 --> 06:42:40.207
HERRING, IT IS NONSENSE. 
BECAUSE, FEDERAL, STATE, 

06:42:40.647 --> 06:42:42.647
LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN 
INVESTIGATE.

06:42:50.278 --> 06:42:52.278
THE JANUARY EXCEPTION ALWAYS 
EXPIRES ON JANUARY 20th.

06:42:57.637 --> 06:43:02.987
HOUSE DEMOCRATS, IN THIS DEEPLY 
UNFAIR TRIAL HAVE SHAMEFULLY 

06:43:03.417 --> 06:43:08.017
TRAMPLED EVERY TRADITION, NORM, 
AND STANDARD OF DUE PROCESS. IN 

06:43:08.238 --> 06:43:15.807
A WAY THAT I HAVE NEVER, EVER, 
SEEN BEFORE. MR. TRUMP WAS GIVEN

06:43:15.948 --> 06:43:17.948
NO

06:43:20.858 --> 06:43:22.858
RIGHT TO REVIEW THE SO-CALLED 
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM AT TRIAL. 

06:43:23.058 --> 06:43:27.678
HE WAS GIVEN NO OPPORTUNITY TO 
QUESTION ITS PROPRIETY. HE WAS 

06:43:27.893 --> 06:43:31.558
GIVEN NO CHANCE TO ENGAGE IN 
FACT-FINDING. MUCH OF WHAT WAS 

06:43:31.778 --> 06:43:37.018
INTRODUCED BY THE HOUSE WAS 
UNVERIFIED SECOND OR THIRD HAND 

06:43:37.238 --> 06:43:39.238
REPORTING CRIBBED FROM A BIASED 
NEWS MEDIA INCLUDING STORIES 

06:43:39.738 --> 06:43:41.738
BASED ON

06:43:44.418 --> 06:43:46.397
ANONYMOUS SOURCES WHOSE 
IDENTITIES ARE NOT EVEN KNOWN TO

06:43:46.398 --> 06:43:51.918
THEM, LET ALONE MY CLIENT. THEY 
MANUFACTURED AND DOCTORED 

06:43:52.048 --> 06:43:56.669
EVIDENCE, SO MUCH SO THAT THEY 
HAD TO WITHDRAW IT.

06:44:06.319 --> 06:44:10.479
THEY WENT ON FOR TWO DAYS, SO IN
THE EVENING I WAS ABLE TO GO 

06:44:10.695 --> 06:44:16.159
BACK AND TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT 
THIS STUFF. I SAW FROM MR. 

06:44:16.379 --> 06:44:19.219
CADMAN, AND MS. BATEMAN, AND MR.
BRENNAN, WE ALL WORKED HARD AND 

06:44:19.439 --> 06:44:24.979
LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE. VOLUMES 
IN TINY PRINT, AND 

06:44:30.539 --> 06:44:32.939
STARTED WITH LITERALLY 12 OR 14 
HOURS, TO REALLY LOOK AT THE 

06:44:33.159 --> 06:44:36.019
EVIDENCE BEFORE WE HAD TO GO ON.
AND JUST IN THAT SHORT TIME OF 

06:44:36.779 --> 06:44:41.160
LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE, WE SAW 
THEM FABRICATING TWITTER 

06:44:41.299 --> 06:44:43.299
ACCOUNTS.

06:44:44.740 --> 06:44:47.380
WE SAW THE MASKED MAN SITTING AT
HIS DESK WITH THE NEW YORK 

06:44:48.140 --> 06:44:50.640
TIMES, THERE. AND, WHEN WE LOOK 
CLOSELY, WE FOUND THAT THE DATE 

06:44:50.860 --> 06:44:55.030
WAS WRONG, THE CHECK HAD BEEN 
ADDED. THEY FABRICATED EVIDENCE.

06:44:55.660 --> 06:45:03.520
THEY MADE IT UP. THEY NEVER 
ADDRESSED THAT, IN THEIR CLOSING

06:45:04.485 --> 06:45:11.520
. AS THOUGH IT WERE ACCEPTABLE. 
AS THOUGH 

06:45:18.100 --> 06:45:20.910
AS THOUGH THAT IS THE WAY THAT 
IT SHOULD BE DONE HERE IN THE 

06:45:21.130 --> 06:45:29.526
SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. FRAUD. FLAT-OUT. FRAUD.

06:45:35.741 --> 06:45:38.321
WHERE I COME FROM, IN THE COURTS
THAT I PRACTICE IN, THEY ARE 

06:45:39.091 --> 06:45:44.091
VERY HARSH WITH REPERCUSSIONS 
FOR WHAT THEY PULLED IN THIS 

06:45:44.221 --> 06:45:46.221
TRIAL.

06:45:56.721 --> 06:46:01.501
AS WE HAVE SHOWN, THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS WERE CAUGHT CREATING 

06:46:01.721 --> 06:46:03.721
FALSE REPRESENTATIONS OF TWEETS

06:46:06.381 --> 06:46:13.711
. MANIPULATING VIDEOS, AND 
INTRODUCING INTO THE RECORD, 

06:46:13.911 --> 06:46:18.061
COMPLETELY DISCREDITED LIES, 
SUCH AS THE FINE PEOPLE HOAX AS 

06:46:18.817 --> 06:46:20.817
FACTUAL EVIDENCE.

06:46:23.281 --> 06:46:25.881
MOST OF WHAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS 
HAVE SAID AND SHOWN YOU WOULD BE

06:46:26.102 --> 06:46:31.732
INADMISSIBLE IN ANY RESPECTABLE 
COURT OF LAW. THEY WERE NOT 

06:46:31.952 --> 06:46:35.868
TRYING A CASE, THEY WERE TELLING
A POLITICAL TALE. A FABLE. AND, 

06:46:36.069 --> 06:46:38.069
A PATENTLY FALSE ONE AT THAT.

06:46:47.290 --> 06:46:49.290
HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE DENIED DUE 
PROCESS, AND RUSH TO THE 

06:46:49.442 --> 06:46:51.442
IMPEACHMENT, BECAUSE THEY KNOW 
THAT A FAIR TRIAL WOULD REVEAL 

06:46:51.642 --> 06:46:53.642
MR. TRUMP'S INNOCENCE OF THE 
CHARGES AGAINST HIM.

06:46:57.022 --> 06:46:59.172
THE MORE ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT 
COMES OUT, THE CLEARER IT IS 

06:46:59.392 --> 06:47:01.392
THAT THIS WAS A PREPLANNED, AND 
PREMEDITATED ATTACK, WHICH HIS 

06:47:01.582 --> 06:47:06.502
LANGUAGE IN NO WAY INCITED. 
BECAUSE THEIR CASE IS SO WEAK, 

06:47:06.722 --> 06:47:12.137
THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE TAKEN A 
KITCHEN SINK APPROACH TO THE 

06:47:12.338 --> 06:47:14.051
SUPPOSEDLY SINGLE ARTICLE OF 
IMPEACHMENT. THEY ALLEGE THAT 

06:47:14.052 --> 06:47:16.052
MR. TRUMP INCITED THE JANUARY 
6th VIOLENCE

06:47:19.512 --> 06:47:21.663
. THEY ALLEGE THAT HE ABUSED 
POWER BY ATTEMPTING TO PRESSURE 

06:47:21.872 --> 06:47:25.132
GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE 
RAVENS BERGER TO UNDERMINE THE 

06:47:25.352 --> 06:47:28.182
RESULTS OF THE 2020 ELECTION, 
AND THEY ALLEGE THAT HE GRAVELY 

06:47:28.592 --> 06:47:32.508
ENDANGER THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM 
BY INTERFERING BY INTERFERING 

06:47:32.712 --> 06:47:37.823
WITH THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF 
POWER. AT LEAST THREE THINGS, 

06:47:37.953 --> 06:47:42.283
THERE. UNDER THE SENATE RULES, 
EACH OF THESE ALLEGATIONS MUST 

06:47:42.713 --> 06:47:46.453
HAVE BEEN ALLEGED IN A SEPARATE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT.

06:47:50.298 --> 06:47:54.583
I NEED NOT REMIND THIS CHAMBER, 
THAT RULE 23 OF THE RULES OF 

06:47:54.798 --> 06:47:58.253
PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE IN THE 
SENATE, WHEN SITTING ON 

06:47:59.013 --> 06:48:01.013
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS

06:48:04.763 --> 06:48:06.727
PROVIDES, IN PERTINENT PART, 
THAT AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT 

06:48:06.728 --> 06:48:14.783
SHALL NOT BE DIVISIBLE, THEREON.
WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE, THE 

06:48:15.003 --> 06:48:19.093
ARTICLE AT ISSUE HERE ALLEGES 
MULTIPLE WRONGS IN THE SINGLE 

06:48:19.293 --> 06:48:23.893
ARTICLE, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
TO KNOW IF TWO THIRDS OF THE 

06:48:24.113 --> 06:48:29.324
MEMBERS AGREED ON THE ENTIRE 
ARTICLE. OR JUST ON PARTS OF IT,

06:48:29.543 --> 06:48:33.883
AS THE BASIS FOR A VOTE TO 
CONVICT. BASED ON THIS ALONE, 

06:48:34.104 --> 06:48:39.744
THE SENATE MUST VOTE TO ACQUIT 
MR. TRUMP. 

06:48:41.284 --> 06:48:44.979
OBEY YOUR OWN RULES, IF IT IS 
NOT THE CONSTITUTION YOU ARE 

06:48:45.204 --> 06:48:50.164
GOING TO OBEY. IN SHORT, THIS 
IMPEACHMENT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE 

06:48:50.384 --> 06:48:54.214
CHARADE FROM BEGINNING TO END. 
THE ENTIRE SPECTACLE

06:48:58.844 --> 06:49:00.803
HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT THE 
UNHINGED PURSUIT OF A 

06:49:00.804 --> 06:49:02.804
LONG-STANDING POLITICAL VENDETTA
AGAINST MR. TRUMP BY THE 

06:49:03.304 --> 06:49:06.054
OPPOSITION PARTY. AS WE HAVE 
SHOWN

06:49:09.121 --> 06:49:11.121
, DEMOCRATS WERE OBSESSED WITH 
IMPEACHING MR. TRUMP FROM THE 

06:49:11.264 --> 06:49:15.164
VERY BEGINNING OF HIS TERM. THE 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS TRIED TO IMPEACH

06:49:15.384 --> 06:49:18.454
HIM IN HIS FIRST YEAR. THEY 
TRIED TO IMPEACH HIM IN HIS 

06:49:19.215 --> 06:49:24.765
SECOND YEAR. THEY DID IMPEACH 
HIM IN HIS THIRD YEAR, 

06:49:25.625 --> 06:49:30.195
IMPEACHED HIM AGAIN IN HIS 
FOURTH YEAR NOW, THEY HAVE 

06:49:30.410 --> 06:49:35.805
CONDUCTED A PHONY IMPEACHMENT 
SHOW TRIAL, WHEN HE IS A PRIVATE

06:49:36.025 --> 06:49:38.025
CITIZEN OUT OF OFFICE.

06:49:41.445 --> 06:49:43.445
THIS HASTILY ORCHESTRATED AND 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL CIRCUS

06:49:48.375 --> 06:49:50.375
, IS THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS FINAL 
DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO ACCOMPLISH 

06:49:50.575 --> 06:49:54.665
THEIR OBSESSIVE DESIRE OF THE 
LAST FIVE YEARS. SINCE THE 

06:49:54.885 --> 06:49:59.735
MOMENT HE STEPPED INTO THE 
POLITICAL ARENA, MY CLIENT --

06:50:03.475 --> 06:50:05.655
SINCE MY CLIENT STEPPED IN, THEY
HAVE BEEN POSSESSED BY AN 

06:50:05.875 --> 06:50:09.365
OVERWHELMING ZEAL TO VANQUISH AN
INDEPENDENT-MINDED OUTSIDER TO 

06:50:10.125 --> 06:50:16.310
SHAME, DEMEAN, SILENCE, AND 
DEMONIZE HIS SUPPORTERS. IN THE 

06:50:16.525 --> 06:50:19.465
DESPERATE HOPE THAT THEY WILL 
NEVER EVER POSE AN ELECTORAL 

06:50:19.596 --> 06:50:21.596
CHALLENGE.

06:50:23.195 --> 06:50:26.635
WE HEARD ONE OF THE CONGRESSMEN 
ON THE SCREEN. IF YOU DON'T 

06:50:27.056 --> 06:50:29.706
IMPEACH HIM, HE MIGHT BE ELECTED
AGAIN. THAT IS THE FEAR.

06:50:34.511 --> 06:50:38.956
THAT IS WHAT IS DRIVING THIS 
IMPEACHMENT. WHEN YOU DELIBERATE

06:50:39.316 --> 06:50:45.226
OVER YOUR DECISION, THERE ARE 
FOUR DISTINCT GROUNDS

06:50:48.656 --> 06:50:54.906
WHICH YOU MUST ACQUIT MY CLIENT.
FIRST, IS JURISDICTION. 

06:50:57.206 --> 06:51:05.536
NO JURISDICTION. IF YOU BELIEVE 
THAT, YOU STILL GET TO SAY IT. 

06:51:05.956 --> 06:51:15.146
NUMBER TWO, RULE 23. IT HAD TO 
BE DIVISIBLE. EACH ALLEGATION

06:51:19.656 --> 06:51:22.712
HAD TO BE SINGULARLY SET OUT IN 
FRONT OF YOU SO THAT IT COULD BE

06:51:22.912 --> 06:51:25.507
VOTED ON, AND TO SEE IF TWO 
THIRDS OF YOU THINK THAT THEY 

06:51:25.727 --> 06:51:28.346
PROVED THAT CASE OR NOT. THEY 
DID NOT DO THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO 

06:51:28.567 --> 06:51:33.497
ASK YOURSELF, WHY? THEY KNOW THE
SENATE RULES. THEY GOT THEM, AND

06:51:33.717 --> 06:51:40.407
SO DID I. WHY DID THEY DO IT? 
BECAUSE, THEY HAVE NOT 

06:51:40.627 --> 06:51:47.247
INVESTIGATED. FIRST OF ALL. BUT 
ALSO, WHAT THEY FOUND OUT, AS 

06:51:47.467 --> 06:51:51.767
THEY WERE PREPARING ALL OF THIS,
THEY COULD NOT DO IT. SO COME IF

06:51:51.982 --> 06:51:54.847
THEY THREW AS MUCH IN AS THEY 
COULD, AND MADE AS MANY

06:51:58.502 --> 06:52:04.157
BOLD, BALD ALLEGATIONS AS THEY 
COULD, THEN MAYBE, TWO THIRDS OF

06:52:04.378 --> 06:52:07.627
YOU WOULD FALL FOR IT. THAT IS 
WHY THE RULES DON'T ALLOW IT TO 

06:52:07.847 --> 06:52:09.847
GO THAT WAY.

06:52:12.167 --> 06:52:17.597
DUE PROCESS, I HAVE EXHAUSTED 
THE SUBJECT. IT IS A REALLY GOOD

06:52:17.817 --> 06:52:24.157
REASON, FOR ALL OF YOU, ALL OF 
YOU IN THIS CHAMBER, TO STOP THE

06:52:24.298 --> 06:52:30.787
POLITICS. TO READ THE 
CONSTITUTION AND APPLY IT TO 

06:52:31.553 --> 06:52:33.553
THIS PROCEEDING.

06:52:37.153 --> 06:52:42.468
AND, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LACK 
OF DUE PROCESS IS WAY OVER THE 

06:52:42.608 --> 06:52:50.649
TOP. SHOCKING. YOU MUST NOT 
STAND FOR IT. AND 

06:52:51.968 --> 06:52:55.628
FIRST AMENDMENT. THE ACTUAL 
FACTS OF THIS CASE. THERE WERE 

06:52:55.848 --> 06:52:58.128
NO WORDS OF INCITEMENT.

06:53:04.678 --> 06:53:07.008
NOBODY GETS TO TELL YOU WHICH 
GROUNDS TO PICK, AND NOBODY GETS

06:53:07.228 --> 06:53:11.358
TO TELL YOU HOW MANY GROUNDS TO 
CONSIDER. SENATORS, DO NOT LET 

06:53:11.578 --> 06:53:18.098
HOUSE DEMOCRATS TAKE THIS MANIC 
CRUSADE ANY FURTHER. THE SENATE 

06:53:18.318 --> 06:53:21.438
DOES NOT HAVE TO GO DOWN THIS 
DARK PATH OF ENTITY AND 

06:53:21.578 --> 06:53:23.578
DIVISION.

06:53:25.258 --> 06:53:29.329
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO INDULGE THE 
IMPEACHMENT LUST, DISHONESTY, 

06:53:29.548 --> 06:53:33.809
AND THE HYPOCRISY. IT IS TIME TO
BRING THIS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

06:53:34.048 --> 06:53:36.048
POETICAL THEATER TO AN END.

06:53:39.058 --> 06:53:41.879
THERE IS TIME TO ALLOW OUR 
NATION TO MOVE FORWARD. IT IS 

06:53:42.099 --> 06:53:45.728
TIME TO ADDRESS THE REAL 
BUSINESS PRESSING THIS NATION. 

06:53:46.709 --> 06:53:52.279
THE PANDEMIC. OUR ECONOMY. 
RACIAL INEQUALITY.

06:53:56.549 --> 06:54:01.099
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY. 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU 

06:54:01.319 --> 06:54:04.759
NEED TO BE THINKING AND WORKING 
ON, FOR ALL OF US IN AMERICA. 

06:54:05.199 --> 06:54:07.199
ALL OF US.

06:54:10.209 --> 06:54:14.639
WITH YOUR VOTE, YOU CAN DEFEND 
THE CONSTITUTION. YOU CAN 

06:54:14.769 --> 06:54:18.219
PROTECT DUE PROCESS. AND, YOU 
CAN ALLOW

06:54:22.539 --> 06:54:28.259
AMERICA'S HEALING TO BEGIN. I 
URGE THE SENATE TO ACQUIT, AND 

06:54:28.389 --> 06:54:32.749
VINDICATE, THE CONSTITUTION OF 
THIS GREAT REPUBLIC, THANK YOU.

06:54:39.189 --> 06:54:44.410
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEELED TIME. -- WE YIELD 
TIME.

06:54:47.430 --> 06:54:51.960
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, SENATORS. I 
UNDERSTAND

06:54:55.390 --> 06:54:57.580
I TOTALLY HAVE AROUND 27 
MINUTES, BUT I WILL RETURN ALL 

06:54:57.800 --> 06:55:02.580
OF THAT WITH JUST ABOUT FIVE 
BACK TO YOU. THERE ARE A FEW 

06:55:02.795 --> 06:55:08.250
THINGS THAT I HAVE TO ADDRESS. 
IN AN EXTRAORDINARY AND PERHAPS 

06:55:08.470 --> 06:55:10.209
UNPRECEDENTED ACT OF 
SELF-RESTRAINT ON MY PART, I 

06:55:10.210 --> 06:55:13.450
WILL RESIST THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
REBUT EVERY SINGLE FALSE THING 

06:55:13.670 --> 06:55:18.880
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST HEARD. WE 
WILL RETURN TO YOU PERHAPS 22 OR

06:55:19.640 --> 06:55:21.640
23 MINUTES.

06:55:27.410 --> 06:55:29.580
A FEW POINTS. NUMBER ONE, WE 
HAVE DEFINITELY MADE PROGRESS IN

06:55:29.800 --> 06:55:32.160
THE LAST FEW DAYS, BECAUSE A FEW
DAYS AGO, THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM, 

06:55:32.370 --> 06:55:34.971
ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WAS PERHAPS 
A MEMBER WHO HAS SINCE LEFT THE 

06:55:35.190 --> 06:55:37.360
TEAM, LECTURED US, THAT THIS WAS
NOT AN INSURRECTION. AND SAID, 

06:55:37.580 --> 06:55:39.519
THAT THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
WERE OUTRAGEOUS IN USING THE 

06:55:39.520 --> 06:55:43.841
WORD INSURRECTION. TODAY, 
COUNSEL, IN THEIR CLOSING 

06:55:44.051 --> 06:55:46.631
STATEMENT SAID THAT IT WAS A 
VIOLENT INSURRECTION, AND 

06:55:47.051 --> 06:55:52.431
DENOUNCED IT. I WOULD CERTAINLY 
LOVE TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO

06:55:52.651 --> 06:55:55.481
CALL IT A VIOLENT INSURRECTION, 
AND DENOUNCED IT AS WELL. I 

06:55:55.701 --> 06:55:57.851
BELIEVE, THOUGH I DO NOT HAVE A 
VERBATIM TEXT, THAT COUNSEL 

06:55:58.071 --> 06:56:00.071
CALLED FOR LONG SENTENCES

06:56:04.275 --> 06:56:06.451
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE 
INVOLVED. AGAIN, I WOULD LOVE TO

06:56:06.671 --> 06:56:10.581
HEAR THAT COME FROM THE 
PRESIDENT, AS WELL. THE 

06:56:10.801 --> 06:56:12.991
PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL CLAIMS THAT 
THERE IS NO PRECEDENT

06:56:20.156 --> 06:56:22.561
IN THE BODY OF LAW THAT THE 
SENATE HAS FOR IMPEACHING AND 

06:56:22.781 --> 06:56:24.271
CONVICTING A PRESIDENT WHO 
INSIGHTS VIOLENT INSURRECTION 

06:56:24.272 --> 06:56:26.272
AGAINST THE CONGRESS AND THE 
GOVERNMENT

06:56:36.691 --> 06:56:39.081
OF THE UNITED STATES. I GUESS 
THAT IS TRUE, BECAUSE IT NEVER 

06:56:39.301 --> 06:56:41.301
OCCURRED TO ANY OTHER PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, FROM 

06:56:41.481 --> 06:56:43.400
GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOHN ADAMS,
THOMAS JEFFERSON, JAMES MADISON,

06:56:43.401 --> 06:56:45.401
TO JAMES MONROE, TO ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN, TO RONALD REAGAN, TO 

06:56:45.593 --> 06:56:47.791
GEORGE W. BUSH, TO BARACK OBAMA,
TO INCITE A VIOLENT INSURRECTION

06:56:48.011 --> 06:56:50.192
AGAINST THE UNION. YOU ARE 
RIGHT. WE HAVE NO PRECEDENT FOR 

06:56:50.851 --> 06:56:54.772
THAT. SO, THEY THINK THAT IS 
SOMEHOW A MARKET IN THEIR FAVOR.

06:56:57.792 --> 06:57:00.432
A SCORE FOR THEM, THAT THIS 
SENATE HAS TO BE THE FIRST ONE 

06:57:01.191 --> 06:57:03.482
TO DEFINE INCITEMENT OF VIOLENT 
INSURRECTION AGAINST THE UNION. 

06:57:04.242 --> 06:57:10.832
AND SO, THE GENTLEMAN PUTS IT TO
ME. HE SAYS, INCITING 

06:57:11.727 --> 06:57:17.402
PRESIDENT FOR COMMITTING 
INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE 

06:57:17.842 --> 06:57:21.722
INSURRECTION AGAINST THE UNION 
IS THE NEW RASKIN DOCTRINE. WE 

06:57:21.942 --> 06:57:24.462
HAVE TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM THAT 
THERE ARE WELL-KNOWN PRINCIPLES 

06:57:24.592 --> 06:57:26.722
AND ELEMENTS OF INCITEMENT, 
WHICH WE HAVE TALKED TO YOU 

06:57:26.942 --> 06:57:28.942
ABOUT AD NAUSEAM,

06:57:32.182 --> 06:57:34.182
AND THAT THIS IS AN 
INTRINSICALLY AND INHERENTLY 

06:57:34.462 --> 06:57:36.972
FACT-BASED JUDGMENT. BUT, IF 
THAT IS THE RASKIN DOCTRINE, 

06:57:37.187 --> 06:57:40.582
THEN A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES CANNOT INCITE VIOLENT 

06:57:41.552 --> 06:57:45.102
INSURRECTION AGAINST THE UNION 
AND THE CONGRESS, THEN I EMBRACE

06:57:45.322 --> 06:57:50.122
IT AND TAKE IT AS AN HONOR. MOST
LAW PROFESSORS NEVER GET A 

06:57:50.342 --> 06:57:52.472
DOCTRINE NAMED AFTER THEM, SO I 
WILL ACCEPT THAT. FINALLY, THE 

06:57:52.692 --> 06:57:54.692
COUNCIL GOES BACK

06:57:58.913 --> 06:58:00.998
TO JULIAN BOND'S CASE, BECAUSE I
THINK, IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, 

06:58:01.203 --> 06:58:03.203
THEIR BEST ARGUMENT IS 
PATHETICALLY WEAK AS IT IS, AND 

06:58:03.373 --> 06:58:08.603
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT. REMEMBER, THE KEY 

06:58:08.823 --> 06:58:11.003
ARGUMENT IS ABOUT STIFLING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SPEECH. 

06:58:11.443 --> 06:58:13.833
SOMEONE TELL ME WHEN HIS SPEECH 
HAS EVER BEEN STIFLED. HE SAYS 

06:58:14.053 --> 06:58:17.133
WHENEVER HE WANTS, WHATEVER HE 
WANTS.

06:58:21.173 --> 06:58:23.173
IF YOU CONVICTING FOR INCITEMENT
INSURRECTION HE WILL CONTINUE TO

06:58:23.343 --> 06:58:27.253
SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS ON THAT 
DAY. MEMBER, THEY REFERRED 

06:58:27.473 --> 06:58:29.473
YESTERDAY TO INTERFERENCE WITH 
HIS LIBERTY, WHICH I FOUND 

06:58:29.993 --> 06:58:32.263
ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE, BECAUSE 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HE WILL NOT

06:58:32.483 --> 06:58:35.418
SPEND ONE MINUTE IN PRISON OR 
JAIL. FROM CONVICTION ON THESE 

06:58:35.553 --> 06:58:38.843
CHARGES. IT IS A CIVIL REMEDY TO
PROTECT ALL OF US

06:58:42.503 --> 06:58:44.503
, TO PROTECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY,
OUR CHILDREN, OUR CONSTITUTION, 

06:58:44.683 --> 06:58:49.203
OUR FUTURE. THAT IS WHAT 
IMPEACHMENT, TRIAL, CONVICTION 

06:58:49.643 --> 06:58:51.643
ARE ALL ABOUT.

06:58:58.304 --> 06:59:00.833
JULIAN BOND. I KNEW JULIAN BOND.

06:59:04.473 --> 06:59:06.844
MOST PEOPLE SAID DON'T RESPOND 
TO THIS BUT I HAVE TO RESPOND. 

06:59:07.063 --> 06:59:10.003
JULIAN BOND WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS 
ACTIVIST WHO DECIDED TO GO INTO 

06:59:10.133 --> 06:59:13.404
POLITICS, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN 
THIS ROOM, LIKE ALL OF US WHO 

06:59:13.619 --> 06:59:20.825
ARE IN POLITICS. AND, THEY TRIED
TO KEEP HIM OUT. HE WAS A MEMBER

06:59:21.044 --> 06:59:25.384
OF THE STUDENT NONVIOLENT 
COORDINATING COMMITTEE, WHICH 

06:59:25.604 --> 06:59:29.254
LAUNCHED THE VOTING RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. THERE IS A 

06:59:29.474 --> 06:59:34.909
GREAT STORY THAT BOB MOSES CALLS
IN HIS BOOK, CALLED 

06:59:36.044 --> 06:59:38.044
EQUATIONS"

06:59:40.319 --> 06:59:42.904
, HE WAS A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR
AND HE SAW

06:59:48.104 --> 06:59:49.853
BLACKS CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTERS 
IN MISSISSIPPI, COLLEGE STUDENTS

06:59:49.854 --> 06:59:52.674
I THINK AT NORTH CAROLINA AT&amp;amp;T. 
HE SAW A PICTURE OF THEM IN THE 

06:59:52.894 --> 06:59:56.804
NEW YORK TIMES, AND THEY WERE 
SITTING IN AT A LUNCH COUNTER 

06:59:57.025 --> 06:59:59.619
AND HE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE, 
AND HE SAID, THEY LOOKED THE WAY

06:59:59.825 --> 07:00:05.259
THAT I FELT. HE SAID HE HAD TO 
GO DOWN SOUTH TO MISSISSIPPI., 

07:00:05.464 --> 07:00:07.464
THEY LAUNCHED THE VOTING RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT.

07:00:11.535 --> 07:00:13.845
THAT IS WHERE THE PHRASE ONE 
PERSON ONE VOTE COMES FROM. IT 

07:00:14.065 --> 07:00:16.065
WAS NOT INVENTED BY THE SUPREME 
COURT, THEY WOULD GO 

07:00:16.245 --> 07:00:18.245
DOOR-TO-DOOR TO TRY TO REGISTER 
PEOPLE TO VOTE. ANYWAY, JULIAN 

07:00:18.384 --> 07:00:23.564
BOND WAS A PART OF THAT. THE 
STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING 

07:00:24.325 --> 07:00:29.015
COMMITTEE. NONVIOLENCE. IT WAS 
THE END, AND IT WAS THE MEANS. 

07:00:29.235 --> 07:00:32.275
NONVIOLENCE. AND, HE RAN FOR THE
STATE LEGISLATURE IN GEORGIA. A 

07:00:33.035 --> 07:00:36.685
PATH THAT OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS 
ACTIVIST FOLLOWED, LIKE OUR 

07:00:36.815 --> 07:00:41.645
GREAT LATE BELOVED COLLEAGUE 
JOHN LEWIS IN OUR HEARTS TODAY. 

07:00:41.775 --> 07:00:43.775
AND,

07:00:46.522 --> 07:00:49.115
WHEN HE GOT ELECTED, THEY WANTED
TO TRY TO KEEP HIM FROM BEING 

07:00:49.335 --> 07:00:54.155
SWORN INTO THE GEORGIA 
LEGISLATURE. SO, THEY SAID THE 

07:00:54.375 --> 07:00:56.134
STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING 
COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN A POSITION 

07:00:56.135 --> 07:00:58.135
AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR. YOU 
REMEMBER

07:01:07.610 --> 07:01:10.395
,  YOU ARE A REMEMBER OF SNCC. 
WE WILL NOT ADMIT YOU BECAUSE 

07:01:10.610 --> 07:01:12.945
YOU ARE AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR.
AND THE SUPREME COURT IN ITS 

07:01:13.165 --> 07:01:15.165
WISDOM SAID THAT YOU CANNOT 
PREVENT SOMEONE FROM SWEARING AN

07:01:15.330 --> 07:01:17.906
OATH TO BECOME A MEMBER  OF A 
LEGISLATIVE BODY BECAUSE OF A 

07:01:18.125 --> 07:01:20.535
POSITION THAT THEY TOOK, OR A 
GROUP THEY WERE A PART OF, 

07:01:20.755 --> 07:01:23.146
BEFORE THEY WERE SWORN IN. THAT 
IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF DONALD 

07:01:23.355 --> 07:01:25.746
TRUMP. HE GOT ELECTED TO OFFICE,
HE SWORE AN OATH TO THE 

07:01:25.963 --> 07:01:27.954
CONSTITUTION, TO PRESERVE, 
PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE 

07:01:27.955 --> 07:01:29.955
CONSTITUTION.

07:01:33.796 --> 07:01:36.186
HE SERVED AS PRESIDENT FOR FOUR 
YEARS, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END, 

07:01:36.406 --> 07:01:38.406
WHEN HE WANTED TO EXERCISE HIS 
RIGHTS UNDER THE IMAGINARY 

07:01:38.566 --> 07:01:40.515
JANUARY EXCEPTION, AND HE 
INCITED A VIOLENT MOB IN 

07:01:40.516 --> 07:01:43.336
INSURRECTION, TO COME UP HERE, 
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. HE

07:01:43.556 --> 07:01:45.726
IS BEING IMPEACHED AND CONVICTED
FOR VIOLATING HIS OATH OF OFFICE

07:01:45.946 --> 07:01:48.326
THAT HE TOOK. HE IS NOT BEING 
PREVENTED FROM TAKING HIS OATH 

07:01:48.546 --> 07:01:52.026
IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT IS ON OUR SIDE

07:01:58.937 --> 07:02:01.666
. HE TRIED TO OVERTURN THE WILL 
OF THE PEOPLE, THE VOICE OF THE 

07:02:01.866 --> 07:02:04.286
PEOPLE. HE LOST THAT ELECTION BY
MORE THAN 7 MILLION VOTES. SOME 

07:02:04.506 --> 07:02:06.666
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT. 
COUNSEL FOR THE PRESIDENT COULD 

07:02:06.874 --> 07:02:11.156
NOT BRING THEMSELVES TO ADMIT 
THAT THE ELECTION IS OVER. IN 

07:02:11.376 --> 07:02:13.376
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION FROM THE 
DISTINCT GENTLEMAN FROM VERMONT,

07:02:13.527 --> 07:02:16.136
HE REFUSED TO ANSWER THAT BUT HE
SAID IT WAS IRRELEVANT. DESPITE 

07:02:16.356 --> 07:02:18.766
ALL OF THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU 
HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE BIG LIE, 

07:02:18.986 --> 07:02:21.167
AND HOW THAT SET THE STAGE FOR 
HIS INCITEMENT OF THE 

07:02:21.386 --> 07:02:23.386
INSURRECTIONARY VIOLENCE AGAINST
US.

07:02:26.362 --> 07:02:28.737
THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS ON OUR 
SIDE. WE ARE DEFENDING THE BILL 

07:02:28.951 --> 07:02:30.951
OF RIGHTS. WE ARE DEFENDING THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE.

07:02:34.987 --> 07:02:37.187
WE ARE DEFENDING THE SEPARATION 
OF POWERS, AND WE ARE DEFENDING 

07:02:37.397 --> 07:02:39.547
THE U.S. SENATE AND THE U.S. 
HOUSE. AGAINST A PRESIDENT WHO 

07:02:39.767 --> 07:02:44.967
ACTED NO BETTER THAN A MARAUDER,
AND A MEMBER OF THAT MOB BY 

07:02:45.187 --> 07:02:48.027
INCITING THOSE PEOPLE TO COME 
HERE, AND IN MANY WAYS, HE WAS 

07:02:48.242 --> 07:02:50.617
WORSE. HE NAMED THE DATE, HE 
NAMED THE TIME, AND HE BROUGHT 

07:02:51.377 --> 07:02:55.072
THEM HERE, AND NOW HE MUST PAY 
THE PRICE. THANK YOU, MR. 

07:02:55.207 --> 07:02:57.207
PRESIDENT.

07:02:58.697 --> 07:03:03.927
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU, MR. RASKIN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ESTHER PRESIDENT.

07:03:06.317 --> 07:03:07.836
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MAJORITY LEADER IS 
RECOGNIZED.

NOW READY TO VOTE ON THE ARTICLE

07:03:13.782 --> 07:03:17.787

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CLERK WILL READ THE 
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT.

INSURRECTION. 

07:04:15.848 --> 07:04:17.848
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE WILL BE IN ORDER.

07:04:24.078 --> 07:04:25.837
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES 
THAT THE HOUSE OF 

07:04:25.838 --> 07:04:27.817
REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE THE 
SOLE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT, AND 

07:04:27.818 --> 07:04:29.978

PHONE CALL ON JANUARY 2nd, 2021,

07:07:07.876 --> 07:07:12.446

GRAVELY ENDANGERED THE SECURITY

07:07:37.402 --> 07:07:41.218

RESPONDED FOR DONALD JOHN TRUMP,

07:19:52.809 --> 07:19:57.350

IMPEACHMENT, EXHIBITED AGAINST 
HIM BY THE HOUSE

07:20:19.000 --> 07:20:21.280
FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGE

07:21:15.820 --> 07:21:18.780
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OUR MOVE THAT THE

07:21:23.690 --> 07:21:25.649
SENATE, ON THE ISSUE OF 
IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD JOHN 

07:21:25.650 --> 07:21:27.800
TRUMP, RESIGNED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SITTING IN THE COURT OF 

07:21:28.020 --> 07:21:30.020
IMPEACHMENT, STANDS ADJOURNED.

07:21:34.170 --> 07:21:36.800
CAN HAVE ORDER, PLEASE? THE 
PRESIDING OFFICE OF THE ACTING 

07:21:37.020 --> 07:21:40.380
SERGEANT AT ARMS WILL ESCORT THE
HOUSE MANAGERS OUT OF THE SENATE

07:21:40.540 --> 07:21:42.540

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

07:22:24.990 --> 07:22:26.990
THE SENATE VOTES NOT TO CONVICT 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP OF 

07:22:27.190 --> 07:22:29.190
INCITING AN INSURRECTION, AND 
THE CHARGE OF HIGH CRIMES AND 

07:22:29.390 --> 07:22:33.715
MISDEMEANORS. YOU CAN SEE, THE 
SENATE HAS NOW GAMBLED OUT, 

07:22:33.920 --> 07:22:35.869
SEVEN REPUBLICANS JOINED WITH 
THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, IN

07:22:35.870 --> 07:22:37.870
A VOTE TO CONVICT, MAKING THIS 
THE MOST BIPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT 

07:22:38.020 --> 07:22:40.630
TRIAL IN HISTORY, YET IT WAS NOT
ENOUGH TO MEET THE 67 VOTES 

07:22:40.850 --> 07:22:43.040
NEEDED FOR CONVICTION. LET'S 
LISTEN NOW TO THE SENATE FLOOR, 

07:22:43.260 --> 07:22:47.800
FOR A MOMENT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATE IS NOT IN ORDER. 

07:22:48.230 --> 07:22:50.430
THE SENATE WILL BE IN ORDER. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I ASK 

07:22:51.200 --> 07:22:55.170
UNANIMOUS CONSENT THE SENATE TO 
BE IN A PERIOD OF MOURNING 

07:22:55.390 --> 07:22:57.500
BUSINESS WITH SENATORS PERMITTED
TO SPEAK THEREIN FOR UP TO 10 

07:22:57.720 --> 07:22:59.559
MINUTES EACH. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITHOUT OBJECTION, SO 

07:22:59.560 --> 07:23:01.830
ORDERED. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW, SENATORS CAN TAKE TO THE

07:23:02.050 --> 07:23:05.960
FLOOR BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT 
NEWS OF THIS DAY IS THAT DONALD 

07:23:06.180 --> 07:23:08.350
TRUMP IS ACQUITTED, ESSENTIALLY 
IN THIS TRIAL. THIS IS A 

07:23:09.120 --> 07:23:11.120
WASHINGTON POST SPECIAL REPORT.

07:23:16.840 --> 07:23:19.010
I'M LINDA CASEY, WE WILL BE 
WATCHING TO SEE IF IMPEACHMENT 

07:23:19.230 --> 07:23:20.979
MANAGERS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
LAWYERS SPEAK AT THE 

07:23:20.980 --> 07:23:22.939
MICROPHONES, WHICH WE DO 
ANTICIPATE THEM DOING HERE. A 

07:23:22.940 --> 07:23:24.884
VICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP'S 
LAWYERS, I'M GOING TO BRING 

07:23:24.885 --> 07:23:26.885
JAMES HOME AND INTO THE 
CONVERSATION.

07:23:35.321 --> 07:23:37.470
A VICTORY FOR HIS LAWYERS, AND 
FOR DONALD TRUMP, BUT FRANKLY, 

07:23:37.690 --> 07:23:40.290
JAMES, NOT BASED ON THE WAY THEY
ARGUED THE CASE. EVEN JUST NOW, 

07:23:40.510 --> 07:23:42.459
IN THESE CLOSING ARGUMENTS, WE 
HEARD DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS 

07:23:42.460 --> 07:23:44.460
MAKE FALSE STATEMENTS, CERTAIN 
THINGS THAT JUST ARE NOT TRUE. 

07:23:44.650 --> 07:23:47.270
YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT DON'T EVEN
GET TO THE HEART OF THE CASE, 

07:23:47.490 --> 07:23:50.350
BUT WE COULD ALL SEE AND HEAR 
WITH OUR OWN EYES AND EARS, WERE

07:23:50.570 --> 07:23:53.780
DIRECTLY IN CONTRADICTION TO 
BOTH THE EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS 

07:23:54.000 --> 07:23:56.310
WHAT THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
HAD LITERALLY JUST SAID MOMENTS 

07:23:56.450 --> 07:23:58.450
BEFORE

07:24:02.281 --> 07:24:05.080
. WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT HOW WE
GOT HERE, BUT LET'S JUST GET 

07:24:05.300 --> 07:24:07.690
YOUR REACTION RIGHT NOW, TO THE 
NEWS OF HOW THIS VOTE WENT 

07:24:07.910 --> 07:24:09.659
TODAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, IT IS A VICTORY FOR 

07:24:09.660 --> 07:24:11.840
TRUMP. HE, IN THEORY, CAN RUN 
AGAIN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024, 

07:24:12.061 --> 07:24:14.800
WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT. HISTORY 
WILL JUDGE TRUMP, EVEN IF THE 

07:24:14.930 --> 07:24:19.946
SENATE DID NOT JUDGE HIM 
NEGATIVELY. AS YOU NOTED, THIS 

07:24:20.150 --> 07:24:21.910
IS THE MOST BIPARTISAN 
IMPEACHMENT VOTE IN U.S. 

07:24:21.911 --> 07:24:23.911
HISTORY. ONE OF THE REASONS IT 
WAS SO BIPARTISAN, SEVEN 

07:24:24.090 --> 07:24:27.830
REPUBLICANS VOTED TO CONVICT THE
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THEIR OWN 

07:24:28.046 --> 07:24:31.300
PARTY, IS THAT THEY DID NOT FEEL
SATISFIED WITH THE CASE THAT THE

07:24:31.520 --> 07:24:34.580
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS MADE. THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS 

07:24:34.790 --> 07:24:39.841
REFUSED TO GIVE A TIMELINE, 
REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT TRUMP

07:24:40.601 --> 07:24:44.231
DID AFTER THE CAPITAL WAS 
BREACHED. AND,

07:24:49.171 --> 07:24:52.461
I THINK JAMIE RASKIN HAD A LOT 
OF ANALOGIES THIS WEEK. HE WAS A

07:25:00.011 --> 07:25:01.750
FORMER CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 
PROFESSOR. THEY LIKE TO USE 

07:25:01.751 --> 07:25:03.751
ANALOGIES. A LOT OF THESE 
REPUBLICANS WHO WERE ON THE 

07:25:03.931 --> 07:25:05.875
FENCE, INCLUDING BILL CASSIDY 
WHO WAS YESTERDAY WALKING AROUND

07:25:05.876 --> 07:25:08.476
WITH A DRAFT SPEECH OF THE 
POTENTIAL VOTE TO ACQUIT THE 

07:25:08.691 --> 07:25:10.650
PRESIDENT, EVERYONE WE WERE 
WATCHING, INCLUDING WHEN WE WERE

07:25:10.651 --> 07:25:12.545
NOT WATCHING, RICHARD BYRD OF 
NORTH CAROLINA, RETIRING NEXT 

07:25:12.546 --> 07:25:17.311
YEAR, DECIDED TO VOTE TO 
CONVICT. THE ANALOGY THAT LEAD 

07:25:17.531 --> 07:25:19.531
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER RASKIN USED 
THERE IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS, I 

07:25:19.701 --> 07:25:21.620
THINK RESONATED WITH THOSE 
REPUBLICANS, WHICH IS THAT IT 

07:25:21.621 --> 07:25:25.101
REALLY WAS QUITE RELEVANT TO 
THEM, WHAT TRUMP DID AFTER THE 

07:25:25.321 --> 07:25:27.321
CAPITAL WAS BREACHED.

07:25:29.871 --> 07:25:32.231
HIS REFUSAL TO SEND HELP, HIS 
DELAY IN TELLING PEOPLE TO LEAVE

07:25:32.446 --> 07:25:34.380
PEACEFULLY REALLY DID SAY 
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS INTENT, THAT

07:25:34.381 --> 07:25:39.061
IS WHAT RASKIN WAS ARGUING WHEN 
HE SAID IT'S LIKE AN ARSONIST 

07:25:39.281 --> 07:25:43.201
WHO STARTS A FIRE, THE USE WATER
TO PUT THE FIRE OUT RIGHT AWAY, 

07:25:43.421 --> 07:25:46.811
YOU CAN ARGUE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
BUT IF THEY WATCH THAT THEN YOU 

07:25:46.951 --> 07:25:48.951
CAN'T.

07:26:00.801 --> 07:26:03.202
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WAS GO TO RHONDA COLEMAN FOR 
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR SEVEN 

07:26:03.421 --> 07:26:06.241
REPUBLICANS TO SAY THAT DONALD 
TRUMP IS GUILTY OF HIGH CRIMES 

07:26:07.001 --> 07:26:09.387
AND MISDEMEANORS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

07:26:16.241 --> 07:26:18.401
ONE OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS FROM 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY MADE

07:26:18.621 --> 07:26:20.621
THEIR IMPEACHMENT VOTE AS WELL 
AS SOME SENATE REPUBLICANS IS 

07:26:20.791 --> 07:26:22.791
THAT THESE PROCEEDINGS WERE VERY
POLITICAL. THEY WERE DRIVEN BY 

07:26:22.982 --> 07:26:25.506
PARTISANSHIP, AND HOW DEMOCRATS 
FOR A LONG TIME WANTED TO 

07:26:25.641 --> 07:26:28.252
IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP, HOWEVER, 
WE ARE SEEING THAT SEVEN MEMBERS

07:26:30.401 --> 07:26:32.791
OF HIS OWN PARTY CAME FORWARD 
TODAY, AND DECIDED TO VOTE TO 

07:26:33.002 --> 07:26:38.140
CONVICT HIM. THAT IS HISTORIC OF
COURSE, AND IT IS ALSO QUITE 

07:26:38.272 --> 07:26:40.272
STUNNING.

07:26:46.966 --> 07:26:49.322
AND TAKING BACK TO WHEN I WAS 
HERE LAST YEAR, COVERING THE 

07:26:49.542 --> 07:26:51.542
FIRST IMPEACHMENT VOTE, I THINK 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE 

07:26:51.672 --> 07:26:54.512
FOR MANY OF US IN THE CONDITION 
THE SENATE IS IN, IN SUCH A 

07:26:54.732 --> 07:26:56.681
POLARIZED NATURE, TO HEAR THAT 
SEVEN REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED 

07:26:56.682 --> 07:26:59.402
WITH THE DEMOCRATS TO CONVICT 
HIM. SO, THAT ARGUMENT THAT THIS

07:26:59.532 --> 07:27:04.052
IS A POLITICAL STUNT, I DON'T 
KNOW IF THAT HOLDS WATER 

07:27:04.262 --> 07:27:06.262
ANYMORE, IF IT WILL HOLD WATER 
HISTORICALLY, BECAUSE WE HAVE 

07:27:06.412 --> 07:27:08.412
JUST SEEN SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S PARTY DISCUSSED TO 

07:27:08.572 --> 07:27:10.572
GO WITH DEMOCRATS.

07:27:13.792 --> 07:27:15.962
RICHARD BURR, I WAS THINKING 
ABOUT HIM, AND I WAS LISTENING 

07:27:16.182 --> 07:27:18.342
OUT FOR HIS NAME, SPECIFICALLY 
BECAUSE HE CAME OUT WITH A 

07:27:18.562 --> 07:27:23.539
STATEMENT SAYING THAT TRUMPS 
RHETORIC LED TO THE 

07:27:23.762 --> 07:27:26.362
INSURRECTION. THAT WAS A PRESS 
RELEASE HE PUT OUT ON THE DAY OF

07:27:27.122 --> 07:27:29.622
THE INSURRECTION. AND, BECAUSE 
HE IS NOT RUNNING FOR 

07:27:29.842 --> 07:27:33.512
RE-ELECTION I WAS KEEPING MY EYE
ON HIM. HE OF COURSE, IS ONE OF 

07:27:33.732 --> 07:27:38.042
THE SEVEN REPUBLICANS. BUT 
AGAIN, YOU ARE JUST SEEING THAT 

07:27:38.258 --> 07:27:40.422
THIS BIPARTISAN NATURE SHOWS YOU
THAT THIS WAS NOT POLITICAL, AT 

07:27:41.182 --> 07:27:44.092
THE END. THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS, THEIR WORK IN TRYING 

07:27:44.308 --> 07:27:47.972
TO ESTABLISH THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WAS DISTANT AND DID NOT HELP 

07:27:48.172 --> 07:27:50.982
WHEN THE CAPITAL WAS UNDER 
INSURRECTION REALLY HIT HOME AND

07:27:51.192 --> 07:27:54.432
STRUCK A CHORD WITH THESE 
MEMBERS, AND WE ARE SEEING NOW 

07:27:54.652 --> 07:27:56.652
THAT THIS IS

07:27:59.017 --> 07:28:01.017
A VERY HISTORIC MOMENT, THAT 
THESE REPUBLICANS VOTED IN THIS 

07:28:01.152 --> 07:28:02.431
WAY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE SEEING SENATORS 

07:28:02.432 --> 07:28:07.993
WALKING AWAY THERE. THERE IS 
MARK WARNER OF VIRGINIA, IT IS 

07:28:08.212 --> 07:28:11.023
ICY OUT. A LOT OF THE SENATORS 
ARE EAGER TO HIT THE ROAD AND 

07:28:11.237 --> 07:28:14.077
GET HOME TO THEIR STATES, 
BECAUSE THE SENATE IS IN RECESS 

07:28:14.293 --> 07:28:19.708
NEXT WEEK. SO, EVEN THOUGH WE 
HEARD IN A FASCINATING TWIST, 

07:28:20.132 --> 07:28:22.283
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYER SAY IT 
WAS TIME TO GET ON WITH 

07:28:22.503 --> 07:28:24.503
BUSINESS, INCLUDING RACIAL 
JUSTICE,

07:28:33.159 --> 07:28:35.733
THEY ARE IN RECESS NEXT WEEK. 
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WON'T BE

07:28:35.933 --> 07:28:37.912
WORKING. SENATORS DO THINGS FROM
THEIR HOME DISTRICT, OBVIOUSLY, 

07:28:37.913 --> 07:28:40.303
BUT THEY ARE NOT SCHEDULED TO BE
IN WASHINGTON, NEXT WEEK. SO, 

07:28:40.523 --> 07:28:42.693
THAT DOESN'T THROW SOME COLD 
WATER ONTO THIS QUESTION OF HOW 

07:28:42.913 --> 07:28:46.823
QUICKLY THEY HAD TO MOVE ON THIS
TO GET ONTO COVID-19 RELIEF AND 

07:28:47.043 --> 07:28:49.463
EVERYTHING ELSE. WE CAN TALK 
ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT, BUT I 

07:28:49.663 --> 07:28:51.663
WANT TO SHARE THIS REPORTING 
FROM OUR COLLEAGUE, MIKE, TO 

07:28:51.821 --> 07:28:53.821
THAT POINT THAT RHONDA MADE 
ABOUT SENATOR BURR'S VOTE, MIKE 

07:28:54.533 --> 07:28:57.630
SAYS THAT THERE WERE GASPS IN 
THE CHAMBER WHEN SENATOR BURR 

07:28:58.393 --> 07:29:00.393
VOTED GUILTY.

07:29:03.713 --> 07:29:05.713
HERE IS WHAT ELSE WE KNOW, 
SENATOR PAT TOOMEY OF 

07:29:05.873 --> 07:29:08.023
PENNSYLVANIA JUST PAST REPORTERS
AND SAID THE VOTE TO CONVICT WAS

07:29:08.228 --> 07:29:10.403
THE RIGHT CALL, BUT HE WOULD NOT
COMMENT FURTHER THAN THAT. 

07:29:10.623 --> 07:29:12.843
SENATOR TOOMEY, ANOTHER ONE OF 
THOSE WHO IS RETIRING.

07:29:16.723 --> 07:29:19.103
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EXACTLY. WHEN YOU HEARD BURR 
EARLIER IN THE LINEUP, YOU HEARD

07:29:19.318 --> 07:29:21.723
THAT GASP AND DID RAISE THE 
QUESTION OF HOW MANY OF THE 

07:29:21.943 --> 07:29:23.943
OTHER FOUR RETIRING 

07:29:28.709 --> 07:29:33.651
RICHARD SHELBY FROM ALABAMA DID 
NOT DO SO NOR DID CHUCK GRASSLEY

07:29:35.425 --> 07:29:37.425
COME WHO CONTINUES TO BE THE 
SUBJECT

07:29:42.289 --> 07:29:49.353
AND ALSO FOUND TRUMP NOT GUILTY.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO BACK TO YOU, 

07:29:52.246 --> 07:29:54.429
. IT IS FOR THOSE WHO DID VOTE 
GUILTY

07:29:58.858 --> 07:30:01.119
. LOVE THAT YOU PUT IN CONTEXT 
AND REMINDED US ABOUT A 

07:30:01.320 --> 07:30:03.603
STATEMENT SENATOR BURR SENT OUT 
THAT THERE WAS OTHER REPUBLICANS

07:30:03.805 --> 07:30:08.738
COME INCLUDING MITCH McCONNELL 
WAS ALSO CRITICIZED PRESIDENT 

07:30:08.953 --> 07:30:12.885
TRUMP AND THE LANGUAGE HE USED 
AND HIS ROLE IN INCITING THOSE 

07:30:13.099 --> 07:30:17.438
ATTACKERS ON JANUARY 6 WHO 
ULTIMATELY WALKED BACK AND DID 

07:30:17.642 --> 07:30:20.484
NOT VOTE TO CONVICT SO WHAT 
MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE WHO

07:30:20.641 --> 07:30:23.166
DID? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, WHAT MAKES THE 

07:30:23.378 --> 07:30:25.606
DIFFERENCE IS THERE ALL GOING TO
HAVE TO EXPLAIN

07:30:29.293 --> 07:30:31.360
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO ANY 
CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE WONDERING 

07:30:31.561 --> 07:30:33.566
ABOUT THEIR VOTE IF THEY ARE 
FROM A

07:30:39.578 --> 07:30:41.424
SPACE THAT WANTED TO SEE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACQUITTED AND 

07:30:41.425 --> 07:30:43.520
THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO 
EXPLAIN THAT AND THE OTHER ONE 

07:30:43.744 --> 07:30:45.591
WHO PUT OUT IS IN THE VERY 
EARLY.  

07:30:45.592 --> 07:30:48.065
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL HOLD ONE MOMENT, 
RHONDA AND IT IS SENATOR BLUNT  

07:30:48.280 --> 07:30:50.348
AT THE MICROPHONE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK YOU MAKE A DECISION 

07:30:51.122 --> 07:30:56.164
LIKE THIS BASED ON ANY PARTY 
DECISION OR POLITICAL DECISION. 

07:30:56.375 --> 07:31:00.092
IT WAS MY VIEW WHEN WE STARTED 
AND IT IS MY VIEW NOW THAT THE 

07:31:00.294 --> 07:31:02.294
PURPOSE OF PRESIDENTIAL 
IMPEACHMENT

07:31:06.512 --> 07:31:08.796
IS TO REMOVE A PERSON FROM 
OFFICE AND NOT TO PUNISH AN 

07:31:09.012 --> 07:31:11.302
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS NO LONGER IN 
OFFICE. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO 

07:31:11.502 --> 07:31:14.209
DO THAT, IF OTHERS THINK THAT IS
APPROPRIATE THAT THIS IS A 

07:31:14.973 --> 07:31:16.973
POLITICAL PROCESS

07:31:22.396 --> 07:31:24.396
BUT NOBODY ARGUES THAT. FRANKLY,
I THOUGHT THE HOUSE MANAGERS 

07:31:24.477 --> 07:31:28.401
MADE A MISTAKE BY ASSUMING THAT 
BECAUSE ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS AND

07:31:28.615 --> 07:31:30.615
A HANDFUL OF REPUBLICANS HAD 
VOTED THAT WE HAVE JURISDICTION 

07:31:30.706 --> 07:31:35.452
TO NEVER ARGUE WITH THOSE OF US 
WHO THOUGHT WE DID NOT HAVE 

07:31:35.668 --> 07:31:40.673
JURISDICTION WHILE WE WERE WRONG
. MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THE 

07:31:40.875 --> 07:31:43.364
CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR ON THAT 
AND THE PEOPLE I WORK FOR IF YOU

07:31:44.110 --> 07:31:46.110
ASK PEOPLE

07:31:48.699 --> 07:31:50.699
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IN MISSOURI 
AND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF 

07:31:50.801 --> 07:31:53.082
IMPEACHMENT WOULD BE, NINE OUT 
OF 10 OF THEM WOULD SAY TO 

07:31:53.298 --> 07:31:55.379
REMOVE SOMEONE FROM OF IS A NOT 
TO PUNISH SOMEBODY WHO 

07:31:55.573 --> 07:31:57.573
PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN OFFICE.

07:32:00.130 --> 07:32:02.130
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE OF THE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS WHO VOTED TO ACQUIT 

07:32:02.217 --> 07:32:06.340
DONALD TRUMP.  JAMES HOHMANN , 
WE WERE WARNED BY IMPEACHMENT 

07:32:06.541 --> 07:32:11.944
MANAGERS THAT SENATORS MIGHT 
GIVE THAT IS THE REASON, THE 

07:32:12.711 --> 07:32:16.738
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION. THEY 
COMPARED IT TO A DEFENSE 

07:32:16.939 --> 07:32:20.025
ATTORNEY FILING A MOTION, LOSING
THAT MOTION IN A COURT 

07:32:20.227 --> 07:32:22.227
PROCEEDING AND NOT MOVING ON

07:32:25.391 --> 07:32:27.650
. UNSETTLED WAS THE QUESTION OF 
CONSTITUTIONALITY IF YOU ARE A 

07:32:27.853 --> 07:32:31.393
SENATOR WHO DID NOT THINK IT WAS
CONSTITUTIONAL BUT THE BODY YOU 

07:32:31.609 --> 07:32:34.906
SERVE IN VOTED IT WAS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN USE THAT AS A REASON 

07:32:35.106 --> 07:32:39.999
TO VOTE NO. IT IS NOT LIQUID DO 
NOT SPEND ALL DAY TUESDAY

07:32:49.057 --> 07:32:50.719
HEARING ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH 
SIDES ABOUT THE JURISDICTIONAL 

07:32:50.720 --> 07:32:52.354
MATTER AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
MATTER. JAMIE RASKIN CALLED IT 

07:32:52.355 --> 07:32:57.711
THE JANUARY EXEMPTION AND THE 
IDEA  IF YOU ACCEPT THE LOGIC 

07:32:57.912 --> 07:32:59.912
ABOUT WHAT SENATOR BLUNT JUST 
SAID, ANYTHING A PRESIDENT DOES 

07:32:59.992 --> 07:33:05.481
CANNOT BE PUNISHED BY CONGRESS 
BECAUSE HE IS LEAVING. HE IS 

07:33:05.676 --> 07:33:08.416
SOMEONE WHO IS AN ESTABLISHMENT 
MINDED SENATOR, BUT HE IS UP FOR

07:33:08.632 --> 07:33:12.960
REELECTION NEXT YEAR AND A STATE
WHERE JOSH HAWLEY IS THE JUNIOR 

07:33:13.175 --> 07:33:16.486
SENATOR AND IS A LEADING FIGURE 
BEHIND THE CHALLENGE OF THE 

07:33:16.689 --> 07:33:21.497
CERTIFICATION JANUARY 6. A POLL 
SHOWED JOSH HAWLEY IS MORE 

07:33:21.698 --> 07:33:23.698
POPULAR IN MISSOURI

07:33:27.576 --> 07:33:29.650
THEN ROY BLUNT IS AND HE IS 
CONCERNED ABOUT A PRIMARY 

07:33:29.864 --> 07:33:31.864
CHALLENGE. TALKING ABOUT THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY

07:33:36.249 --> 07:33:38.733
GIVES HIM A PROCEDURAL OUT SO 
THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO DEFEND 

07:33:38.950 --> 07:33:41.035
TRUMP'S UNDERLYING CONDUCT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE JUST SAW THE ATTORNEYS OF 

07:33:41.238 --> 07:33:46.125
PRESIDENT TRUMP. LET'S GO TO OUR
COLLEAGUE WHO HAS BEEN FOCUSING 

07:33:46.338 --> 07:33:52.263
ON THE DEFENSE THIS WEEK AND 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY, JOYCE

07:33:56.538 --> 07:33:58.216
?  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: IT WAS DIFFICULT TO

07:33:58.217 --> 07:34:00.938
EXTRACT WHAT FORM OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S DEFENSE WAS  TO BE 

07:34:01.133 --> 07:34:03.133
CHARGED INCITEMENT OF 
INSURRECTION

07:34:08.778 --> 07:34:11.256
. HE TALKED MORE ABOUT THE BLACK
LIVES MATTER PROTEST THAN HE DID

07:34:11.472 --> 07:34:14.135
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT DAY THAT
WE SAW ON JANUARY 6. HE DID NOT 

07:34:14.352 --> 07:34:16.352
ILLUSTRATE WHAT LED TO THE

07:34:23.447 --> 07:34:25.447
FIVE DEATHS OR ILLUSTRATE THE 
COUNTLESS INJURIES THAT WE SAW 

07:34:25.503 --> 07:34:27.985
THAT DAY OR WHAT LED TO THE 
HOUSE AND THE SENATE HAVING TO 

07:34:28.188 --> 07:34:32.358
BE EVACUATED  BECAUSE MEMBERS OF
THE MOB CAME TO THE CAPITOL 

07:34:32.577 --> 07:34:34.577
ATTACKING POLICE OFFICERS .

07:34:38.447 --> 07:34:42.760
HE DID TRY TO DRAW A FALSE 
EQUIVALENCY AND TRUMP'S RESPONSE

07:34:42.962 --> 07:34:45.848
TO THAT AND I WILL SEND IT BACK 
TO YOU AND WE CAN TALK MORE 

07:34:46.614 --> 07:34:49.750
ABOUT THIS.'S BUT WE WANT TO GO 
TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE THE 

07:34:49.953 --> 07:34:54.109
MAJORITY LEADER IS SPEAKING. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 

07:34:56.072 --> 07:34:59.212
CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICAN CIVIL 
LIFE

07:35:02.613 --> 07:35:08.641
. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
WORDS HE SPOKE BUT THE EXAMPLE 

07:35:08.843 --> 07:35:11.429
IT SET. WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL 
ADDRESS ESTABLISHED FOR ALL TIME

07:35:12.799 --> 07:35:17.018
THAT NO ONE HAD THE RIGHT TO THE
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY

07:35:22.510 --> 07:35:24.616
, THAT IT BELONGED TO THE 
PEOPLE. WHAT AN AMAZING LEGACY 

07:35:24.817 --> 07:35:28.541
AND WHAT AN AMAZING GIFT TO 
FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE 

07:35:28.740 --> 07:35:32.012
KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS COUNTRY WILL
ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN ANY ONE 

07:35:32.168 --> 07:35:38.444
PERSON. THAT IS WHY MEMBERS OF 
BOTH PARTIES TAKE TURNS READING 

07:35:38.649 --> 07:35:42.364
WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS ONCE A YEAR
IN FULL INTO THE RECORD TO 

07:35:42.563 --> 07:35:49.008
PLEDGE, AND ATTACHMENT TO THE 
SELFLESSNESS AT THE CORE OF OUR 

07:35:49.223 --> 07:35:51.223
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THIS TRIAL

07:35:57.693 --> 07:35:59.730
WAS ABOUT THE FINAL ACTS OF A 
PRESIDENT WHO REPRESENTS THE 

07:35:59.934 --> 07:36:01.934
ANTITHESIS OF OUR FIRST 
PRESIDENT AND SOUGHT TO PLACE 

07:36:02.361 --> 07:36:06.589
ONE MAN BEFORE THE ENTIRE 
COUNTRY, HIMSELF LET THE RECORD 

07:36:07.354 --> 07:36:09.354
SHOW THAT

07:36:16.068 --> 07:36:18.116
BEFORE GOD, HISTORY, AND THE 
SOLEMN OATH WE SHARE TO THE 

07:36:18.319 --> 07:36:20.717
CONSTITUTION, THERE IS ONLY ONE 
CORRECT VERDICT IN THIS TRIAL, 

07:36:20.876 --> 07:36:22.876
GUILTY.

07:36:26.965 --> 07:36:29.411
I PRAY THAT WHILE JUSTICE WAS 
NOT DONE IN THIS TRIAL, IT WILL 

07:36:29.619 --> 07:36:31.690
BE CARRIED FORWARD BY THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ABOVE ANY OF

07:36:31.905 --> 07:36:37.209
US IN THIS CHAMBER DETERMINE THE
DESTINY OF OUR GREAT NATION. I 

07:36:37.425 --> 07:36:42.168
YIELD THE FLOOR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER

07:36:42.371 --> 07:36:48.027
SPEAKING ON THE FLOOR. HE BEGAN 
BY SAYING 43 PEOPLE CHOSE

07:36:51.005 --> 07:36:53.005
OVER AMERICA AND THAT IS HIS

07:36:58.280 --> 07:37:00.119
CRITIQUE YOU CAN SEE MITCH 
McCONNELL PREPARING TO MAKE 

07:37:00.120 --> 07:37:02.399
REMARKS AND WE WILL GO TO THAT 
AS IT BEGINS PRACTICES LIVE 

07:37:02.612 --> 07:37:04.612
COVERAGE FROM THE WASHINGTON 
POST 

07:37:08.675 --> 07:37:10.152
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JANUARY 6 WAS A DISGRACE. 

07:37:10.153 --> 07:37:12.314
AMERICAN CITIZENS ATTACH THEIR 
OWN GOVERNMENT TO USE TERRORISM

07:37:16.551 --> 07:37:18.857
TO TRY TO STOP A SPECIFIC PIECE 
OF DOMESTIC BUSINESS THEY DID 

07:37:19.460 --> 07:37:23.550
NOT LIKE HOOK FOUL AMERICANS 
BEAT HER OWN POLICE. THEY 

07:37:23.755 --> 07:37:29.365
STORMED THE SENATE FLOOR. THEY 
TRIED TO HUNT DOWN THE SPEAKER 

07:37:29.565 --> 07:37:35.042
OF THE HOUSE. THEY BUILT A 
GALLOWS AND CHANTED ABOUT 

07:37:35.214 --> 07:37:42.168
MURDERING THE VICE PRESIDENT. 
THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY HAD 

07:37:42.920 --> 07:37:49.472
BEEN FED FALSEHOODS BY THE MOST 
POWERFUL MAN ON EARTH

07:37:53.686 --> 07:37:56.783
, BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY AND HAD 
LOST AN ELECTION. FORMER 

07:37:56.999 --> 07:38:02.927
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACTIONS 
PRECEDED THE RIOT  FOR A 

07:38:03.085 --> 07:38:05.584
DISGRACEFUL DERELICTION OF DUTY

07:38:11.176 --> 07:38:14.122
. THE HOUSE ACCUSED THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT OF, QUOTE, INCITEMENT.

07:38:14.322 --> 07:38:20.126
THAT IS A SPECIFIC TERM FROM THE
CRIMINAL LAW. 

07:38:21.166 --> 07:38:25.241
THAT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT TO 
REITERATE SOMETHING I SAID WEEKS

07:38:25.401 --> 07:38:27.439
AGO. THERE IS NO QUESTION

07:38:36.421 --> 07:38:37.884
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
PRACTICALLY AND MORALLY 

07:38:37.885 --> 07:38:41.020
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVOKING THE 
EVENTS OF THE DAY. NO QUESTION 

07:38:41.777 --> 07:38:48.629
ABOUT IT. THE PEOPLE WHO STORMED
THIS BUILDING BELIEVES THEY WERE

07:38:48.843 --> 07:38:52.040
ACTING ON THE WISHES AND 
INSTRUCTIONS OF THEIR PRESIDENT.

07:38:53.996 --> 07:38:58.832
AND HAVING THAT BELIEF WAS A 
FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCE

07:39:01.952 --> 07:39:03.952
GROWING CRESCENDO

07:39:11.139 --> 07:39:12.597
OF FALSE STATEMENTS, CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES, AND RECKLESS 

07:39:12.598 --> 07:39:15.525
HYPERBOLE, WHICH THE DEFEATED 
PRESIDENT KEPT SHOUTING INTO THE

07:39:15.739 --> 07:39:23.751
LARGEST MEGAPHONE ON PLANET 
EARTH. THE ISSUE IS NOT ONLY THE

07:39:23.957 --> 07:39:27.828
INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE OF THE 
PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 6

07:39:33.988 --> 07:39:36.289
, AND IT IS NOT JUST HIS 
ENDORSEMENT OF REMARKS IN WHICH 

07:39:36.489 --> 07:39:41.852
AN ASSOCIATE URGED, QUOTE, TRIAL
BY COMBAT, BUT IT WAS ALSO THE 

07:39:42.008 --> 07:39:47.566
ENTIRE MANUFACTURED ATMOSPHERE 
OF LOOMING CATASTROPHE, THE 

07:39:48.327 --> 07:39:56.205
INCREASINGLY WILD MYTHS ABOUT A 
REVERSAL LANDSLIDE ELECTION THAT

07:39:56.420 --> 07:40:00.446
WAS SOMEHOW BEING STOLEN WITH 
SOME SECRET

07:40:04.079 --> 07:40:06.079
COUP BY ARONOW PRESIDENT 

07:40:08.625 --> 07:40:10.720
. I DEFENDED THE RIGHT OF THE 
PRESIDENT TO BRING ANY 

07:40:10.934 --> 07:40:14.545
COMPLAINTS TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. 
THE LEGAL SYSTEM SPOKE

07:40:23.935 --> 07:40:26.248
. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SPOKE. 
AS I STOOD UP AND SAID CLEARLY 

07:40:26.449 --> 07:40:29.558
AT THAT TIME THE ELECTION WAS 
SETTLED AND IS OVER. THAT REALLY

07:40:29.758 --> 07:40:35.379
OPENED UP A CHAPTER OF EVEN 
WILDER AND MORE UNFOUNDED CLAIMS

07:40:37.578 --> 07:40:43.763
. THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD 
CANNOT SPEND WEEKS TENDERING 

07:40:44.165 --> 07:40:46.934
THAT SHADOWY FORCES ARE STILL IN
OUR COUNTRY AND THEN

07:40:52.182 --> 07:40:54.392
ACT SURPRISED WHEN PEOPLE 
BELIEVE HIM AND DO RECKLESS 

07:40:54.545 --> 07:40:56.545
THINGS. SADLY,

07:40:59.614 --> 07:41:02.381
MANY MAKE OVERHEATED COMMENTS OR
USE METAPHORS. WE SAW THAT.

07:41:07.047 --> 07:41:10.316
THINGS THAT LISTENERS MIGHT TAKE
LITERALLY, BUT THAT WAS 

07:41:11.292 --> 07:41:15.594
DIFFERENT. THAT WAS DIFFERENT 
FROM WHAT WE SAW

07:41:19.237 --> 07:41:21.443
. THIS WAS AN INTENSIFYING 
CRESCENDO OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES

07:41:21.597 --> 07:41:24.992
ORCHESTRATED BY AN OUTGOING 
PRESIDENT WHO SEEMED DETERMINED 

07:41:25.207 --> 07:41:29.000
TO EITHER OVERTURN THE VOTER 
DECISION OR ELSE TORCH

07:41:32.481 --> 07:41:34.481
OUR INSTITUTIONS ON THE WAY OUT.

07:41:40.675 --> 07:41:43.077
THE UNCONSCIONABLE BEHAVIOR DID 
NOT END WHEN THE VIOLENCE BEGAN

07:41:50.352 --> 07:41:52.301
. WHATEVER FORMER PRESIDENT 
CLAIMS HE THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE 

07:41:52.302 --> 07:41:59.980
BEEN THAT DAY, WHATEVER REACTION
HE SAYS HE MEANT TO PRODUCE BY 

07:42:00.739 --> 07:42:08.113
THAT AFTERNOON, WE KNOW HE WAS 
WATCHING THE SAME TELEVISION AS 

07:42:08.318 --> 07:42:10.318
THE REST OF US.

07:42:13.490 --> 07:42:19.822
A MOM WAS ASSAULTING THE CAPITOL
IN HIS NAME . THESE CRIMINALS

07:42:22.248 --> 07:42:30.343
WERE CARRYING HIS BANNERS, 
HANGING HIS FLAGS, AND SCREAM IN

07:42:30.560 --> 07:42:37.986
THEIR LOYALTY TO HIM. IT WAS 
OBVIOUS THAT ONLY PRESIDENT 

07:42:38.139 --> 07:42:40.139
TRUMP COULD

07:42:45.259 --> 07:42:49.656
AND THIS. AND HE WAS THE ONLY 
ONE WHO COULD. FORMER AIDES 

07:42:49.876 --> 07:42:55.078
PUBLICLY BEGGED HIM TO DO SO 
LOYAL ALLIES CALLED THE 

07:42:55.846 --> 07:43:01.990
ADMINISTRATION FRANTICALLY. THE 
PRESIDENT DID NOT ACT SWIFTLY. 

07:43:02.392 --> 07:43:08.776
HE DID NOT DO HIS JOB. HE DID 
NOT TAKE STEPS SO FEDERAL LAW 

07:43:08.978 --> 07:43:16.175
COULD BE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED AND
ORDER RESTORED. NO. INSTEAD

07:43:20.992 --> 07:43:25.329
ACCORDING TO PUBLIC REPORTS, THE
WATCHED TELEVISION HAPPILY AS 

07:43:25.534 --> 07:43:27.534
THE CHAOS UNFOLDED

07:43:29.844 --> 07:43:36.220
. HE KEPT PRESSING HIS SCHEME TO
OVERTURN THE ELECTION. 

07:43:37.393 --> 07:43:42.841
AFTER IT WAS CLEAR THAT VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS IN 

07:43:43.593 --> 07:43:50.876
SERIOUS DANGER, EVEN AS THE MOM 
WITH A TRUMP BANNER WAS BEATING 

07:43:51.030 --> 07:43:57.928
COPS AND BREACHING PARAMETERS, 
THE PRESIDENT SENT A

07:44:02.076 --> 07:44:04.076
TWEET ATTACKING HIS OWN VICE 
PRESIDENT .

07:44:08.027 --> 07:44:09.853
PREDICTABLY AND FORESEEABLY 
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, MEMBERS

07:44:09.854 --> 07:44:11.854
OF THE MOB

07:44:16.663 --> 07:44:18.924
SEEMED TO INTERPRET THIS AS 
FURTHER INSPIRATION TO 

07:44:19.142 --> 07:44:24.027
LAWLESSNESS AND VIOLENCE, NOT 
SURPRISINGLY. LATER

07:44:28.680 --> 07:44:33.433
EVEN WHEN THE PRESIDENT DID 
HALFHEARTEDLY BEGIN CALLING FOR 

07:44:34.188 --> 07:44:37.460
PEACE , HE DID NOT CALL RIGHT 
AWAY

07:44:41.139 --> 07:44:44.221
FOR THE RIOT TO END. HE DID NOT 
TELL THE MOB  TO DEPART UNTIL 

07:44:44.994 --> 07:44:48.008
EVEN LATER. AND EVEN THEN

07:44:52.903 --> 07:44:55.009
WITH POLICE OFFICERS BLEEDING 
AND BROKEN GLASS COVERING 

07:44:55.178 --> 07:45:02.018
CAPITOL FLOORS,  HE KEPT 
REPEATING ELECTION LINES AND 

07:45:02.223 --> 07:45:06.849
PRAISING THE CRIMINALS. IN 
RECENT WEEKS,

07:45:14.599 --> 07:45:16.643
HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE TRIED TO USE
THE 74 MILLION AMERICANS WHO 

07:45:16.858 --> 07:45:19.499
VOTED TO REELECT HIM AS A KIND 
OF HUMAN SHIELD AGAINST 

07:45:19.656 --> 07:45:24.227
CRITICISM USING THOSE WHO VOTED 
FOR HIM IS A HUMAN SEAL

07:45:27.701 --> 07:45:30.929
SHIELD AGAINST CRITICISM. ANYONE
WHO

07:45:34.815 --> 07:45:37.196
DECRIES HIS BEHAVIOR IS ACCUSED 
OF INSULTING MILLIONS OF VOTERS.

07:45:38.268 --> 07:45:40.268
THAT IS

07:45:45.412 --> 07:45:47.412
AN ABSURD DEFLECTION. 74 MILLION
AMERICANS DID NOT INVADE THE 

07:45:48.049 --> 07:45:51.991
CAPITOL . HUNDREDS

07:45:57.675 --> 07:45:59.886
OF RIOTERS DID AND 74 MILLION 
AMERICANS DID NOT 

07:46:05.816 --> 07:46:07.816
DO THIS. ONE PERSON DID. JUST 
ONE

07:46:11.819 --> 07:46:14.362
. I HAVE MADE MY VIEW OF THIS 
EPISODE VERY PLAIN.

07:46:19.428 --> 07:46:22.194
BUT OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 
GAVE THE SENATE A SPECIFIC TASK.

07:46:22.827 --> 07:46:28.890
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US A 
PARTICULAR ROLE. THIS BODY IS 

07:46:29.108 --> 07:46:33.643
NOT INVITED TO ACT AS THE 
NATION'S OVERARCHING MORAL 

07:46:33.805 --> 07:46:35.805
TRIBUNAL

07:46:40.994 --> 07:46:43.069
. WE ARE NOT FREE TO WORK 
BACKWARD FROM WHETHER THE 

07:46:43.269 --> 07:46:47.139
ACCUSED PARTY MIGHT PERSONALLY 
DESERVE SOME KIND OF PUNISHMENT.

07:46:47.342 --> 07:46:52.796
JUST AS JOSEPH STORY OUR FIRST 
GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR 

07:46:53.756 --> 07:46:55.792
EXPLAINED TO HUNDRED YEARS AGO

07:46:59.456 --> 07:47:05.297
, THE PROCESS OF IMPEACHMENT AND
CONVICTION IS A NARROW TOOL FOR 

07:47:05.509 --> 07:47:08.118
A NARROW PURPOSE.

07:47:16.681 --> 07:47:18.546
STORY EXPLAINED THIS LIMITED 
TOOL EXISTS TO, QUOTE, SECURITY 

07:47:18.547 --> 07:47:21.216
STATE AGAINST  GROSS OFFICIAL 
MISDEMEANOR.

07:47:26.919 --> 07:47:31.362
THAT IS TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY 
FROM GOVERNMENT OFFICERS.

07:47:39.181 --> 07:47:41.181
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WERE STILL IN
OFFICE, I WOULD'VE CAREFULLY 

07:47:41.227 --> 07:47:43.227
CONSIDERED WHETHER THE HOUSE 
MANAGERS PROVED THEIR SPECIFIC 

07:47:43.357 --> 07:47:51.005
CHARGE. BY THE STRICT CRIMINAL 
STANDARD, THE SPEECH OF THE 

07:47:51.162 --> 07:47:55.685
PRESIDENT PROBABLY WILL NOT 
INSIGHTFUL BUT HOWEVER

07:48:00.439 --> 07:48:04.889
IN THE CONTEXT OF IMPEACHMENT 
THE SENATE MIGHT HAVE

07:48:08.321 --> 07:48:10.321
DECIDED THIS WAS ACCEPTABLE 
SHORTHAND FOR THE RECKLESS 

07:48:10.536 --> 07:48:12.536
ACTIONS THAT

07:48:18.401 --> 07:48:20.464
PRECEDED THE RIOT. IN THIS CASE 
THE QUESTION IS MOOT BECAUSE 

07:48:20.677 --> 07:48:22.677
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS  
CONSTITUTIONALLY NOT ELIGIBLE 

07:48:22.882 --> 07:48:28.920
FOR CONVICTION AND THIS IS A 
CLOSE QUESTION NO DOUBT. DONALD 

07:48:29.137 --> 07:48:35.779
TRUMP WAS THE PRESIDENT WHEN THE
HOUSE VOTED, THOUGH NOT WHEN THE

07:48:36.205 --> 07:48:42.607
HOUSE CHOSE TO DELIVER THE 
PAPERS. BRILLIANT SCHOLARS ARGUE

07:48:43.038 --> 07:48:49.400
BOTH SIDES OF THIS 
JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION. THE 

07:48:49.603 --> 07:48:51.798
TEXT IS LEGITIMATELY AMBIGUOUS

07:48:57.675 --> 07:49:02.276
. I RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES WHO 
HAVE REACHED EITHER CONCLUSION. 

07:49:02.492 --> 07:49:09.530
BUT AFTER INTENSE REFLECTION, I 
BELIEVE THE BEST CONSTITUTIONAL 

07:49:09.736 --> 07:49:12.129
READING SHOWS THAT ARTICLE 2 
SECTION 4 EXHAUSTS

07:49:19.350 --> 07:49:21.350
THE SET OF PERSONS WHO CAN 
LEGITIMATELY BE IMPEACHED, 

07:49:21.407 --> 07:49:24.355
TRIED, OR CONVICTED. IT IS THE 
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, 

07:49:24.509 --> 07:49:27.005
AND CIVIL OFFICERS

07:49:33.437 --> 07:49:35.532
. WE HAVE NO POWER TO CONVICT 
AND DISQUALIFY A FORMER 

07:49:35.738 --> 07:49:40.889
OFFICEHOLDER WHO IS NOW A 
PRIVATE CITIZEN. HERE IS ARTICLE

07:49:41.047 --> 07:49:45.827
2 SECTION 4., QUOTE,, THE 
PRESIDENT

07:49:49.246 --> 07:49:51.578
, THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND ALL 
CIVIL OFFICERS

07:49:57.073 --> 07:49:59.073
OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL BE 
REMOVED FROM OFFICE ON 

07:49:59.160 --> 07:50:01.160
IMPEACHMENT FOR AND CONVICTION 
OF TREASON, BRIBERY, OR OTHER 

07:50:01.216 --> 07:50:03.216
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

07:50:09.681 --> 07:50:12.329
. UP ONE BASICALLY AGREES THE 
SECOND HALF OF THE SENTENCE 

07:50:12.489 --> 07:50:15.192
EXHAUSTS THE LEGITIMATE GROUNDS 
FOR CONVICTION

07:50:18.208 --> 07:50:20.497
. THE DEBATE AROUND THE 
CONSTITUTION FRAMING MAKES IT 

07:50:21.254 --> 07:50:23.254
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

07:50:26.513 --> 07:50:28.513
. CONGRESS, CONVICT FOR REASONS 
BESIDES THOSE

07:50:32.068 --> 07:50:34.337
. IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT THE 
LIST OF PERSONS IN THE SAME 

07:50:34.538 --> 07:50:37.184
SENTENCE IS ALSO EXHAUSTED. 
THERE IS NO REASON WHY ONE WOULD

07:50:37.341 --> 07:50:42.310
LIST, ONE LIST WOULD BE 
EXHAUSTIVE BUT THE OTHER WOULD 

07:50:42.520 --> 07:50:46.675
NOT. ARTICLE II, SECTION 4 

07:50:51.543 --> 07:50:53.229
MUST LIMIT BOTH WHITE 
IMPEACHMENT AND CONVICTION CAN 

07:50:53.230 --> 07:50:55.230
OCCUR AND TO WHOM

07:51:00.695 --> 07:51:02.695
. IF THIS PROVISION DOES NOT 
LIMIT IMPEACHMENT AND CONVICTION

07:51:02.775 --> 07:51:06.158
POWERS, THEN IT HAS NO LIMITS AT
ALL. THE HOUSE

07:51:14.571 --> 07:51:16.864
HAS SOLE POWER OF IMPEACHMENT, 
AND THE SENATE SO POWER TO TRY 

07:51:17.638 --> 07:51:19.638
ALL IMPEACHMENTS

07:51:21.854 --> 07:51:23.697
WOULD CREATE AN UNLIMITED 
CIRCULAR LOGIC AND POWER IN 

07:51:23.698 --> 07:51:25.572
CONGRESS TO BAN ANY PRIVATE 
CITIZEN FROM FEDERAL OFFICE. 

07:51:25.573 --> 07:51:31.053
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE CLAIM. BUT
IT IS THE ARGUMENT OF THE

07:51:35.710 --> 07:51:37.710
HOUSE MANAGERS. ONCE AT THE 
HOUSE AND THE SENATE HAVE 

07:51:37.790 --> 07:51:42.096
ABSOLUTE UNQUALIFIED 
JURISDICTIONAL POWER. THAT WAS 

07:51:42.850 --> 07:51:44.850
VERY HONEST

07:51:54.039 --> 07:51:55.892
BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIMITING 
PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

07:51:55.893 --> 07:51:57.750
TEXT THAT WOULD EMPOWER THE 
SENATE TO CONVICT FORMER 

07:51:57.751 --> 07:51:59.823
OFFICERS THAT WERE NOT ALSO LET 
THEM CONVICT AND DISQUALIFY ANY 

07:52:00.025 --> 07:52:02.025
PRIVATE CITIZEN. AN ABSURD AND 
RESULTS TO WHICH NO ONE 

07:52:02.090 --> 07:52:08.381
SUBSCRIBES. ARTICLE II, SECTION 
4  MUST HAVE FOR US. IT TELLS US

07:52:09.147 --> 07:52:11.147
THE PRESIDENT

07:52:13.810 --> 07:52:16.474
, THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND CIVIL 
OFFICERS MAY BE IMPEACHED AND 

07:52:16.623 --> 07:52:19.922
CONVICTED. DONALD TRUMP IS NO 
LONGER THE PRESIDENT

07:52:27.526 --> 07:52:29.449
. LIKEWISE, THE PROVISIONS STATE
OFFICERS SUBJECT TO IMPEACHMENT 

07:52:29.450 --> 07:52:32.154
AND CONVICTION SHALL BE REMOVED 
FROM OFFICE IF CONVICTED.

07:52:37.160 --> 07:52:39.160
AS JUSTICE

07:52:42.059 --> 07:52:45.087
STORY EXPLAINED, THE SENATE UPON
CONVICTION IS BOUND  IN ALL 

07:52:45.242 --> 07:52:53.373
CASES TO ENTER A JUDGMENT OF 
REMOVAL FROM OFFICE. REMOVAL IS 

07:52:53.524 --> 07:52:55.524
MANDATORY UPON CONVICTION

07:52:57.774 --> 07:53:04.402
. CLEARLY HE EXPLAINED THAT THE 
MANDATORY SENTENCE CANNOT BE 

07:53:04.553 --> 07:53:10.693
APPLIED TO SOMEONE WHO HAS LEFT 
OFFICE. THE ENTIRE PROCESS 

07:53:11.683 --> 07:53:13.683
REVOLVES AROUND REMOVAL

07:53:19.016 --> 07:53:23.074
. IF REMOVAL BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE,
CONVICTION BECOMES CONSENSUAL

07:53:26.264 --> 07:53:29.174
. IT DOES SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE 
AND OFFICEHOLDER CAN ELUDE 

07:53:29.946 --> 07:53:33.874
SENATE CONVICTION BY RESIGNATION
OR EXPIRATION OF TERMS

07:53:41.018 --> 07:53:43.075
, AN ARGUMENT WE HEARD MADE BY 
THE MANAGERS. BUT THIS 

07:53:43.276 --> 07:53:45.276
UNDERSCORES IMPEACHMENT WAS 
NEVER MEANT TO BE THE FINAL FORM

07:53:45.389 --> 07:53:54.550
FOR AMERICAN JUSTICE. 
IMPEACHMENT, CONVICTION, AND 

07:53:54.759 --> 07:53:56.759
REMOVAL

07:53:59.505 --> 07:54:03.942
ARE A SPECIFIC INTERGOVERNMENTAL
SAFETY VALVE

07:54:09.128 --> 07:54:12.378
. IT IS NOT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM OR INDIVIDUAL 

07:54:12.535 --> 07:54:20.296
ACCOUNTABILITY THE PARAMOUNT 
GOAL. INDEED JUSTICE

07:54:24.318 --> 07:54:27.867
STORY SPECIFICALLY REMINDED THAT
WHILE FORMER OFFICIALS  WERE NOT

07:54:28.081 --> 07:54:32.251
ELIGIBLE FOR IMPEACHMENT OR 
CONVICTION, THEY WERE, AND THIS 

07:54:32.453 --> 07:54:39.063
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, STILL 
LIABLE TO BE TRIED AND PUNISHED 

07:54:39.279 --> 07:54:43.634
IN THE ORDINARY TRIBUNALS OF 
JUSTICE. PUT ANOTHER WAY, IN THE

07:54:43.849 --> 07:54:48.180
LANGUAGE OF TODAY, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS STILL LIABLE FOR 

07:54:48.394 --> 07:54:53.182
EVERYTHING HE DID WHILE HE WAS 
IN OFFICE AS AN ORDINARY 

07:54:54.141 --> 07:54:56.141
CITIZEN.

07:55:03.236 --> 07:55:05.236
UNLESS THE STATUTES OF 
LIMITATIONS IS WHEN COME HE IS 

07:55:05.322 --> 07:55:07.594
STILL LIABLE FOR EVERYTHING HE 
DID WHILE HE WAS IN OFFICE. HE 

07:55:07.798 --> 07:55:10.080
DOES NOT GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING 
YET. WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE 

07:55:10.283 --> 07:55:15.147
SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE 
CIVIL LITIGATION AND FORMER 

07:55:15.299 --> 07:55:19.680
PRESIDENTS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM 
BEING ACCOUNTABLE BY EITHER ONE.

07:55:22.240 --> 07:55:27.242
I BELIEVE THE SENATE WAS RIGHT 
NOT TO GRAB POWER THE 

07:55:27.446 --> 07:55:32.185
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT GIVE US, 
AND THE SENATE WAS RIGHT NOT TO 

07:55:32.945 --> 07:55:36.337
ENTERTAIN SOME PROCESS TO TRY TO
OUT RUN

07:55:42.445 --> 07:55:44.789
THE LOSS OF JURISDICTION. IT 
TOOK BOTH SIDES MORE THAN A WEEK

07:55:44.992 --> 07:55:46.992
JUST TO PRODUCE THE PRETRIAL 
BRIEFS. SPEAKER PELOSI'S

07:55:52.387 --> 07:55:54.387
OWN DECISIONS CONSIDER WHAT 
PRESIDENT BIDEN CONFIRMED. A 

07:55:54.550 --> 07:55:58.476
SENATE PRODUCT BEFORE 
INAUGURATION DAY WAS NEVER 

07:55:58.635 --> 07:56:04.433
POSSIBLE. THIS HAS BEEN A 
DISPIRITING TIME

07:56:08.058 --> 07:56:10.833
, BUT THE SENATE HAS DONE OUR 
DUTY. THE FRAMERS

07:56:14.623 --> 07:56:16.623
HELD UP AGAIN

07:56:22.059 --> 07:56:24.935
. ON JANUARY 6 BE RETURNED TO 
OUR POST AND CERTIFIED THE 

07:56:25.094 --> 07:56:28.786
ELECTION WE WERE NOT INTIMIDATED
WE FINISHED THE JOB

07:56:32.040 --> 07:56:34.040
. SINCE THEN,

07:56:37.025 --> 07:56:39.717
WE RESISTED THE CLAMOR TO DEFY 
OUR OWN GUARDRAILS IN HOT 

07:56:39.875 --> 07:56:42.846
PURSUIT OF A PARTICULAR OUTCOME

07:56:46.320 --> 07:56:53.437
. WE REFUSED TO CONTINUE A CYCLE
OF RECKLESSNESS BY STRAINING OUR

07:56:53.593 --> 07:56:55.913
OWN CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDARIES IN
RESPONSE

07:57:00.916 --> 07:57:02.916
. THE SENATE DECISION TODAY

07:57:06.030 --> 07:57:13.088
DOES NOT CONDONE ANYTHING THAT 
HAPPENED ON OR BEFORE THAT 

07:57:13.850 --> 07:57:18.953
TERRIBLE DAY. IT SIMPLY SHOWS 
THAT SENATORS

07:57:21.985 --> 07:57:26.719
FORMER PRESIDENT FAILED TO DO. 
WE PUT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY 

07:57:26.878 --> 07:57:29.383
FIRST.

07:57:35.868 --> 07:57:41.911
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SENATOR FROM MARYLAND.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU . THEY TAKE THIS 

07:57:42.127 --> 07:57:47.305
TIME TO EXPLAIN WHY I VOTED TO 
CONVICT THE FORMER PRESIDENT. 

07:57:47.505 --> 07:57:49.505
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SENATOR BEN CARDIN

07:57:52.258 --> 07:57:54.510
SPEAKS. LET'S RECAP WHAT WE JUST
SAW. MITCH McCONNELL CONDEMNING 

07:57:55.271 --> 07:57:58.769
DONALD TRUMP AN INCREDIBLY HARSH
LANGUAGE

07:58:02.050 --> 07:58:06.047
, BLAMING HIM FOR THE ATTACK OF 
JANUARY 6 IMPLYING THAT DONALD 

07:58:06.263 --> 07:58:08.263
TRUMP IS NOT FREE FROM CRIMINAL

07:58:11.712 --> 07:58:13.944
PROSECUTION FOR WHAT HE HAS 
DONE. MITCH McCONNELL VOTED 

07:58:14.099 --> 07:58:19.717
ACQUITTAL, SO HE IS GIVING THIS 
DEVASTATING SPEECH THAT HOLDS NO

07:58:20.480 --> 07:58:26.431
ACTUAL WEIGHT OR REPERCUSSIONS 
BECAUSE HE VOTED ACQUITTAL 

07:58:26.647 --> 07:58:30.428
CITING CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. 
THE REASON WHY PRESIDENT DONALD 

07:58:31.189 --> 07:58:36.342
TRUMP TRIAL TO NOT GO FORWARD 
WHILE HE WAS STILL IN OFFICE IS 

07:58:36.491 --> 07:58:39.388
BECAUSE MITCH McCONNELL DID NOT 
LET IT HAPPEN.

07:58:44.864 --> 07:58:50.069
WE HAVE RECEIVED A STATEMENT 
FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD

07:58:50.271 --> 07:58:53.751
TRUMP REACTING TO HIS ACQUITTAL.
HE THANKED HIS LAWYERS AND 

07:58:53.964 --> 07:58:55.964
CALLED THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL THE
GREATEST

07:59:00.617 --> 07:59:02.871
WITCH-HUNT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY. HE DID NOT MENTION THE 

07:59:03.074 --> 07:59:05.135
EVENTS JANUARY 6 AND SAID HIS 
MOVEMENT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT 

07:59:05.349 --> 07:59:09.561
HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN THAT IS THE 
STATEMENT FROM FORMER PRESIDENT 

07:59:09.778 --> 07:59:11.778
DONALD TRUMP LET'S GO TO 
NATIONAL REPORTER

07:59:19.953 --> 07:59:22.417
JOYCE KOH TO FIND OUT MORE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: THIS IS SIMILAR  TO

07:59:22.619 --> 07:59:24.619
WHAT WE HEARD THE FIRST TIME 
AROUND DURING HIS FIRST 

07:59:25.241 --> 07:59:30.467
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TALKING ABOUT 
THIS AS A WITCH-HUNT BUT HE ALSO

07:59:30.682 --> 07:59:35.756
SAID IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY THAT
THE POLITICAL PARTY IN AMERICA 

07:59:35.970 --> 07:59:37.970
IS GIVEN A FREE PASS

07:59:40.805 --> 07:59:44.181
TO TRANSFORM JUSTICE INTO A TOOL
OF POLITICAL VENGEANCE AND 

07:59:44.588 --> 07:59:48.243
SUPPRESS ALL PEOPLE AND 
VIEWPOINTS WITH WHOM THEY 

07:59:48.392 --> 07:59:50.392
DISAGREE

07:59:51.447 --> 07:59:53.893
. PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE 
STATEMENT REALLY STANDING BY HIS

07:59:54.048 --> 07:59:58.008
ACTIONS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING 
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

07:59:58.775 --> 08:00:03.936
TALKED ABOUT DURING THE 10 HOURS
OF ARGUMENTS 

08:00:05.200 --> 08:00:12.138
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THEY 
REALLY BROUGHT UP THIS SCENARIO.

08:00:12.355 --> 08:00:15.294
WHAT IF HE GETS ACQUITTED AND 
REELECTED AND REMAINS A PART OF 

08:00:15.494 --> 08:00:20.059
A VERY POWERFUL LEADER IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THIS 

08:00:20.812 --> 08:00:22.812
HAPPENS AGAIN?

08:00:27.689 --> 08:00:29.543
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER JAMIE 
RASKIN SAID TO HIS COLLEAGUES 

08:00:29.544 --> 08:00:31.915
DONALD TRUMP WILL STOP INCITING 
VIOLENCE, DO YOU THINK

08:00:38.185 --> 08:00:40.244
DONALD TRUMP WILL STOP INCITING 
VIOLENCE TO GET HIS WAY? WITH 

08:00:40.451 --> 08:00:43.169
YOU BUT THE LIVES OF YOUR FAMILY
ON THAT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE 

08:00:43.370 --> 08:00:45.370
DEMOCRACY? HE SAID PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DECLARED HIS CONDUCT 

08:00:45.595 --> 08:00:48.989
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE, SO IF HE 
GETS BACK INTO OFFICE AND IT 

08:00:49.408 --> 08:00:53.566
HAPPENS AGAIN WE WILL HAVE NO 
ONE TO BLAME BUT OURSELVES. 

08:00:53.776 --> 08:00:57.833
THESE ARE VERY STRONG WORDS FROM
REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN . WE

08:00:57.987 --> 08:01:05.246
SEE EXACTLY THAT IN THIS 
STATEMENT AS FAR AS TAKING BLAME

08:01:05.454 --> 08:01:09.229
FOR ANYTHING OR EVEN MENTIONING 
THE INSURRECTION AND VIOLENCE 

08:01:09.430 --> 08:01:14.821
THAT HAPPENED TODAY CALLING THIS
A WITCH-HUNT REMAINED THOSE THAT

08:01:15.023 --> 08:01:17.023
HAVE COME AFTER HIM ON THIS

08:01:25.202 --> 08:01:27.202
,  THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS, FOR EVEN TAKING THIS 

08:01:27.282 --> 08:01:29.192
AS A CASE. PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DEFENDING HIMSELF AFTER BEING 

08:01:29.193 --> 08:01:31.246
ACQUITTED TODAY IN THE SENATE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU 

08:01:34.840 --> 08:01:36.947
,  JOYCE KOH. SENATOR BILL 
CASSIDY WHO VOTED TO CONVICT 

08:01:37.149 --> 08:01:40.088
DONALD TRUMP HAS ALSO ISSUED A 
STATEMENT WRITING THIS . OUR 

08:01:40.302 --> 08:01:42.684
CONSTITUTION AND COUNTRY IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ANY ONE PERSON

08:01:46.149 --> 08:01:48.406
. I VOTED TO CONVICT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS GUILTY AND 

08:01:48.621 --> 08:01:54.281
THIS IS SENATOR CASSIDY.  LET'S 
GO TO YOU, JAMES HOHMANN . THE 

08:01:54.497 --> 08:01:56.781
SPEECH BY MITCH McCONNELL COULD 
HAVE GONE DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE

08:01:56.987 --> 08:02:01.929
OF THE MOST POTENT AND GAME 
CHANGING SPEECHES FROM THAT 

08:02:02.137 --> 08:02:04.137
CHAMBER IN MODERN HISTORY, BUT 
IT WILL NOT

08:02:09.259 --> 08:02:11.558
BECAUSE HE DID NOT VOTE TO 
CONVICT THE MAN WHO WAS THE 

08:02:11.776 --> 08:02:14.494
LEADER OF HIS PARTY WHO STILL IN
MANY WAYS IS THE LEADER OF THE 

08:02:14.697 --> 08:02:16.697
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: ABSOLUTELY 

08:02:26.793 --> 08:02:29.266
. IT IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT
TO LOSE HIS LEADERSHIP JOB 

08:02:29.480 --> 08:02:31.986
TRYING TO PROTECT HIS JOB AND HE
DID NOT WANT TO HAVE AN 

08:02:32.200 --> 08:02:34.200
INSURRECTION OF HIS OWN 
POLITICALLY ON HIS HANDS. HE IS 

08:02:34.291 --> 08:02:36.291
VERY PROUD OF THE FACT HE IS THE
LONGEST-SERVING REPUBLICAN 

08:02:36.932 --> 08:02:41.528
LEADER EVER. IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
THE CASE OF MITCH McCONNELL 

08:02:41.728 --> 08:02:44.178
WANTED TRUMP TO BE CONVICTED, HE
COULD HAVE COME OUT FOR IT. HE 

08:02:44.378 --> 08:02:46.888
IS A VERY STRONG LEADER IN THE 
REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE. THIS IS 

08:02:47.099 --> 08:02:51.416
HIM TRYING TO HAVE HIS CAKE AND 
EAT IT TOO. WHAT HE WANTS PEOPLE

08:02:51.631 --> 08:02:54.690
TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS PAGE IS 
THAT HE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE 

08:02:54.850 --> 08:02:58.840
INSTITUTION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT
HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 

08:02:58.995 --> 08:03:04.492
INTERPRETATION CLICK THAT IS 
MERELY A PROCEDURAL OFFERING 

08:03:04.907 --> 08:03:09.319
LOOKING FOR A LOOPHOLE AND 
LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO BE ABLE

08:03:09.520 --> 08:03:12.843
TO VOTE NO. HE SAID AS MUCH 
BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLEAR ABOUT IN

08:03:13.058 --> 08:03:15.058
HIS VIEW THE WRONGNESS

08:03:19.446 --> 08:03:21.088
OF TRUMP'S CONDUCT BEFORE AND ON
JANUARY 6. 

08:03:21.089 --> 08:03:23.551
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLVIN ON CAPITOL HILL
. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

08:03:23.758 --> 08:03:25.758
REPUBLICANS WHO WILL JUSTIFY 
THEIR VOTE,  RHONDA. 

08:03:30.159 --> 08:03:32.239
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: THEY WILL PROBABLY 
SOUND A LOT LIKE WHAT MITCH 

08:03:32.440 --> 08:03:34.440
McCONNELL JUST SAID 

08:03:37.039 --> 08:03:39.548
. THAT THEY JUST DID NOT FEEL 
THAT THEY HAD THE AUTHORITY TO 

08:03:39.761 --> 08:03:42.050
CONVICT A PRESIDENT WHO IS NO 
LONGER IN OFFICE BUT WE HEARD 

08:03:42.251 --> 08:03:44.251
THAT BEFORE THE TRIAL EVEN BEGAN

08:03:48.481 --> 08:03:50.481
. IT IS SOMETHING HOUSE 
REPUBLICANS CITED AS A REASON, 

08:03:50.560 --> 08:03:52.654
AND I JUST HAVE TO COMMENT ON 
MITCH McCONNELL STATEMENT AND 

08:03:52.854 --> 08:03:57.464
REMIND PEOPLE OF THE TIMELINE 
THAT WHEN THE HOUSE PASSED THE 

08:03:57.677 --> 08:03:59.677
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT, THE 
SENATE WAS OUT

08:04:03.267 --> 08:04:05.371
. SINCE MITCH McCONNELL RUNS THE
CALENDAR AND THE SCHEDULE, HE 

08:04:05.583 --> 08:04:07.583
SAID HE WOULD NOT BRING THEM 
BACK

08:04:18.400 --> 08:04:20.400
FOR ANY SPECIAL REASON. THEY 
REMAINED OUT UNTIL THE DAY 

08:04:20.449 --> 08:04:22.152
BEFORE JOE BIDEN WAS 
INAUGURATED. HE PRETTY MUCH 

08:04:22.153 --> 08:04:24.251
ALONE CONTROLLED WHEN THE SENATE
COULD HAVE TAKEN UP THE ARTICLE 

08:04:24.453 --> 08:04:26.980
OF IMPEACHMENT AND ACCEPTED THE 
ARTICLE. IT IS SO INTERESTING TO

08:04:27.194 --> 08:04:29.574
HEAR HIM USE THE STATEMENT FOR 
HIS THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE DONE 

08:04:29.779 --> 08:04:32.060
AND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL SO QUICKLY
ON THE 19th BECAUSE THEY DID NOT

08:04:32.276 --> 08:04:36.045
GET THE ARTICLE IN TIME AND THAT
WILL NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE IF 

08:04:36.805 --> 08:04:42.310
THE SENATE HAD NOT BEEN IN 
RECESS AND HE IS THE ONE THAT 

08:04:42.509 --> 08:04:44.509
MADE THAT DECISION. OTHERS COULD
USE THAT ARGUMENT

08:04:49.707 --> 08:04:51.707
AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS COULD 
BELIEVE THAT AS A REASON WHY 

08:04:51.771 --> 08:04:56.692
THEY DID NOT WANT TO MOVE 
FORWARD WITH CONVICTION. FOR 

08:04:56.895 --> 08:04:59.389
MITCH McCONNELL TO SAY THAT WHEN
HE WAS THE ONE IN CONGRESS WHO 

08:04:59.619 --> 08:05:02.984
COULD HAVE CHANGED THE SCHEDULE,
IT IS SO INTERESTING BUT WE WILL

08:05:03.188 --> 08:05:06.568
SEE HOW THIS AFFECTS REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS WHEN THEY GO BACK HOME 

08:05:06.983 --> 08:05:09.683
AND IF WE ARE HEARING STORIES 
ABOUT ANY OF THEM HAVING TO 

08:05:09.870 --> 08:05:11.870
RECEIVE ANY BACKLASH

08:05:14.237 --> 08:05:16.295
FROM THEIR DECISION AND THE 
SEVEN WHO DECIDED TO VOTE TO 

08:05:17.061 --> 08:05:19.061
CONVICT 

08:05:21.271 --> 08:05:23.354
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A 
DEVELOPING STORY ABOUT THE 

08:05:23.555 --> 08:05:25.632
FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
THE HOUSE HAS HAD ITS ISSUES 

08:05:25.828 --> 08:05:28.725
WITH MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY 

08:05:28.927 --> 08:05:33.519
SHOULD TAKE HER OFF OF 
COMMITTEES BUT NOW WITH THE 

08:05:33.721 --> 08:05:36.661
SENATE REPUBLICANS, THEY NOW 
HAVE SEVEN AMONG THEM WHO 

08:05:36.866 --> 08:05:38.554
BELIEVE THE ONE TIME 
STANDARDBEARER OF THE PARTY 

08:05:38.555 --> 08:05:42.306
SHOULD BE CONVICTED FOR THE 
INSURRECTION.  

08:05:42.307 --> 08:05:46.654
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND RHONDA,  CONGRESSMAN 
GREEN WAS ATTACKING 

08:05:47.085 --> 08:05:53.313
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BEUTLER  
TODAY. AS WE KNOW, HER STATEMENT

08:05:54.078 --> 08:05:56.078
SAID THAT

08:06:00.073 --> 08:06:02.321
THE TOP REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE 
KEVIN McCARTHY TOLD HER ABOUT A 

08:06:02.522 --> 08:06:07.438
CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD WITH 
DONALD TRUMP THAT WAS IN TERMS 

08:06:07.640 --> 08:06:10.283
OF HIS ALLEGED KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
SITUATION ON THE GROUND. HIS 

08:06:10.441 --> 08:06:14.878
LAWYER MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN SAID
HIS CLIENT DID NOTHING WRONG  

08:06:15.085 --> 08:06:18.707
AND HE SAID THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS HAD NO EVIDENCE. LET'S 

08:06:18.861 --> 08:06:20.861
LISTEN

08:06:23.501 --> 08:06:24.960
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH HORRIFYING

08:06:24.961 --> 08:06:29.734
FOOTAGE WE SEE OF THE CONDUCT OF
THE RIOTERS AND HOW MUCH EMOTION

08:06:29.951 --> 08:06:31.951
HAS BEEN  INJECTED INTO THIS 
TRIAL

08:06:35.938 --> 08:06:38.428
, IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT 
MR. TRUMP IS INNOCENT OF THE 

08:06:38.644 --> 08:06:40.825
CHARGES AGAINST HIM, DESPITE ALL
OF THE VIDEO PLAYED

08:06:46.107 --> 08:06:48.551
AT NO POINT IN THE PRESENTATION 
TO DO HERE AT THE HOUSE MANAGERS

08:06:48.756 --> 08:06:54.554
PLAY A SINGLE EXAMPLE OF MR. 
TRUMP URGING ANYONE TO ENGAGE IN

08:06:54.760 --> 08:06:59.532
VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND. AT NO 
POINT DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING THAT

08:07:00.291 --> 08:07:03.351
COULD POSSIBLY BE CONSTRUED AS 
MR. TRUMP SANCTIONING 

08:07:03.505 --> 08:07:07.951
INSURRECTION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SEVEN REPUBLICANS DO NOT 

08:07:08.166 --> 08:07:10.166
AGREE TO THAT.

08:07:13.280 --> 08:07:18.607
RHONDA COLVIN, ANOTHER DISAGREES
AND THAT IS MITCH McCONNELL  WE 

08:07:18.822 --> 08:07:23.155
JUST HIRED HIM TO SAY THE EXACT 
OPPOSITE OF THIS. CAN YOU GIVE 

08:07:23.365 --> 08:07:26.676
US THE LANES REPUBLICANS ARE IN 
RIGHT NOW? THERE IS SHADES OF 

08:07:26.878 --> 08:07:32.264
WAR THEY FILE IN THE SPECTRUM IF
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID SOMETHING 

08:07:32.469 --> 08:07:36.637
WRONG OR NOT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: YOU HAVE A LOT OF 

08:07:37.389 --> 08:07:39.389
THEM 

08:07:41.639 --> 08:07:42.883
TALKING ABOUT THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY ARGUMENT THAT 

08:07:42.884 --> 08:07:47.046
THE PROCEEDING THIS WEEK WAS NOT
EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL SO THEY DO 

08:07:47.249 --> 08:07:49.987
NOT HAVE A CHOICE AND HAD TO GO 
WITH HOW THEY FEEL AND THEY 

08:07:50.202 --> 08:07:54.000
BELIEVE IT SHOULD ONLY APPLY TO 
SOMEONE CURRENTLY IN OFFICE

08:07:57.923 --> 08:08:00.233
. THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE 
ATTACKING ON THE FIRST DAY OF 

08:08:00.447 --> 08:08:03.129
DELIBERATIONS THIS WEEK WHEN 
THEY VOTED IF THIS WAS 

08:08:03.331 --> 08:08:05.331
CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT

08:08:12.051 --> 08:08:14.051
YOU'RE GETTING PAST THAT THEY 
DID HAVE JURISDICTION ON TUESDAY

08:08:14.104 --> 08:08:16.104
TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS PROCESS 
AND IMPEACHMENT MANAGER JAMIE 

08:08:16.169 --> 08:08:21.383
RASKIN  ASKED THEM TO ABANDON 
THAT IDEA. YOU HAVE THAT LANE 

08:08:21.595 --> 08:08:26.357
NEVER REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE 
THAT YOU ALSO HAVE MODERATE 

08:08:26.560 --> 08:08:28.785
REPUBLICANS WHO WE WERE WATCHING
ALL OF THIS TIME WHO BELIEVE YOU

08:08:28.997 --> 08:08:31.372
CANNOT OVERLOOK THE ACTIONS OF 
JANUARY 6

08:08:35.130 --> 08:08:37.191
. THEY WERE MAINLY FOCUSED ON 
THE TIMELINE WHERE TRUMP WAS 

08:08:37.394 --> 08:08:40.884
CHECKED OUT AND AIDES FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE SAID HE WAS NOT 

08:08:41.090 --> 08:08:48.476
RESPONDING AND THAT HE LEFT VICE
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE IN DANGER. 

08:08:48.679 --> 08:08:53.118
THEY FOCUSED ON WHEN DID HE KNOW
THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN 

08:08:53.277 --> 08:08:55.277
TROUBLE

08:08:59.742 --> 08:09:02.025
? THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS 
BEEN CITED IN SOME OF THE 

08:09:02.228 --> 08:09:07.134
STATEMENTS I'VE BEEN READING. 
THAT ROMNEY SAID HE WAS VERY 

08:09:07.558 --> 08:09:09.558
TROUBLED ABOUT THE MIKE PENCE 
ASPECT AND THE FACT PRESIDENT 

08:09:09.642 --> 08:09:12.318
TRUMP DID NOT COME TO ASSIST HIM
OR ASK ABOUT HIM OR SEND THE 

08:09:12.534 --> 08:09:14.534
NATIONAL GUARD BUT THAT WAS 
SOMETHING THAT REALLY TROUBLED 

08:09:14.941 --> 08:09:16.941
SENATOR ROMNEY

08:09:18.724 --> 08:09:21.504
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. THAT IS 
WHY THEY MADE THAT DECISION

08:09:28.182 --> 08:09:30.673
. I THINK AS WE GO FORWARD 
THROUGHOUT THIS DAY WE WILL SEE 

08:09:30.884 --> 08:09:32.944
SOME MORE STATEMENTS FROM 
REPUBLICANS WHY THEY VOTED THE 

08:09:33.146 --> 08:09:35.014
WAY THEY DID. THIS IS A 
SITUATIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE 

08:09:35.015 --> 08:09:40.138
GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER ONE WAY 
OR THE OTHER WHY THEY VOTED THE 

08:09:40.350 --> 08:09:45.996
WAY THEY DID. A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS 

08:09:46.212 --> 08:09:48.877
NEXT AS THIS EMBOLDENS THOSE WHO
ARE PART OF THE MOB WHO NOW SEE 

08:09:49.651 --> 08:09:52.951
THE PERSON WHO THEY BELIEVE THEY
CAME HERE TO DO THIS FOR 

08:09:53.151 --> 08:09:57.515
ACQUITTED. THAT IS ANOTHER 
CONCERN BECAUSE MANY OF THESE 

08:09:57.719 --> 08:10:02.056
MEMBERS ARE STILL GRAPPLING WITH
THE EMOTION OF SUCH A CLOSE CALL

08:10:02.815 --> 08:10:05.833
JANUARY 6. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET'S GO TO HANNAH

08:10:18.381 --> 08:10:20.381
JEWELL

08:10:22.547 --> 08:10:24.226
.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: JANUARY 6 IS NOT 

08:10:24.227 --> 08:10:26.227
OVER FOR THOSE  WHO STORMED

08:10:31.924 --> 08:10:34.428
THE THAT DAY. THIS GROUP OF 200 
WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED SO FAR 

08:10:34.643 --> 08:10:36.891
INCLUDES PROFESSIONALS AND A 
BLUE COLLARED WORKERS  AND YOUNG

08:10:37.103 --> 08:10:39.103
MEN AND MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITH A
HISTORY OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE 

08:10:39.192 --> 08:10:43.527
LIKE TAX PROBLEMS AND 
BANKRUPTCIES AND 15% OF WHOM 

08:10:43.728 --> 08:10:48.406
WERE MILITARY VETERANS OF SOME 
KIND. THIS ALL INCLUDED MEMBERS 

08:10:48.824 --> 08:10:53.945
OF THE PROUD BOYS. THEY WERE 
MOSTLY WHITE BUT NOT ENTIRELY. 

08:10:54.147 --> 08:10:58.385
THEY ALL BELIEVE THAT THE 
ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN

08:11:01.565 --> 08:11:04.644
. SOME ARE MOUNTING AS PART OF 
THE DEFENSE THE FACT THEY FELT 

08:11:04.859 --> 08:11:07.418
THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE ORDERS 
OF THE PRESIDENT. SOME

08:11:11.664 --> 08:11:14.264
FEEL BETRAYED AS IT BECOMES 
CLEAR HOW MUCH TROUBLE THEY ARE 

08:11:14.420 --> 08:11:16.420
IN

08:11:22.233 --> 08:11:24.696
AS HE IS NOT. IN ONE CASE A 
TEENAGER WHO WAS CHARGED WITH 

08:11:24.901 --> 08:11:27.517
SHOVING AN OFFICER, HIS PARENTS 
HAD BROUGHT HIM AND ARE NOW 

08:11:27.688 --> 08:11:29.688
ASKING

08:11:32.131 --> 08:11:34.131
AUTHORITIES TO DROP THE CHARGES.
THEY SAID THEY ARE EMBARRASSED 

08:11:34.195 --> 08:11:36.279
FOR TAKING THE SENDER AND 
BELIEVING TOO MUCH IN THE IDEA 

08:11:36.495 --> 08:11:38.564
OF A FRAUDULENT ELECTION AND 
BELIEVING THE THEN PRESIDENT WE 

08:11:38.765 --> 08:11:41.589
ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF
THE PROUD BOYS IN PARTICULAR

08:11:45.227 --> 08:11:48.265
AND HE TOLD THEM TO STAND BACK 
AND STAND BY FOR NOW FACING 

08:11:48.422 --> 08:11:50.422
CHARGES

08:11:53.322 --> 08:11:56.572
. MEANWHILE, THE FBI STILL 
OFFERS A REWARD OF $100,000

08:12:03.658 --> 08:12:05.549
FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE 
ARREST OF WHOEVER WAS 

08:12:05.550 --> 08:12:07.550
RESPONSIBLE FOR PLACING THE PIPE
BOMBS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THE 

08:12:07.587 --> 08:12:09.477
NIGHT BEFORE THE INSURGENCY. IN 
HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT, MICHAEL 

08:12:09.478 --> 08:12:11.478
VAN DER VEEN  SAID THAT THE

08:12:15.518 --> 08:12:17.571
RIOTERS WERE ALREADY AT THE 
CAPITOL BEFORE THE END OF THE 

08:12:17.785 --> 08:12:20.487
SPEECH AND SOME WERE BUT MANY 
WERE NOT  AND WENT OVER AT THE 

08:12:20.690 --> 08:12:24.780
CONCLUSION . SOMETHING ELSE THAT
CAME OUT TO ME WAS WHEN MANAGER 

08:12:24.996 --> 08:12:30.167
DEAN SAID THAT INSURRECTION IS 
ARE STILL LISTENING TO WE WILL 

08:12:30.368 --> 08:12:35.095
CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE 
LEARNED TODAY AND WHETHER OR NOT

08:12:35.309 --> 08:12:40.659
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN ACHIEVE A
LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THE

08:12:40.875 --> 08:12:42.719
POLITICAL SYSTEM MAY NOT HAVE AS
WELL.  

08:12:42.720 --> 08:12:44.720
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THANK YOU 

08:12:48.083 --> 08:12:50.350
,  HANNAH JEWELL. JAMES, AS SHE 
SPEAKS ABOUT WHAT IS FACING 

08:12:51.120 --> 08:12:53.719
THOSE  CHARGED IN CRIMINAL COURT
AND WE SAW IMAGES

08:12:57.338 --> 08:13:01.480
OF THE BRUTALITY AND ACTED ON 
POLICE OFFICERS AND ON THE 

08:13:01.683 --> 08:13:07.901
PROPERTY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
MITCH McCONNELL HAD A REALLY 

08:13:08.654 --> 08:13:14.745
INTERESTING STATEMENT THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL LIABLE 

08:13:15.150 --> 08:13:19.253
FOR EVERYTHING HE DID IN OFFICE.
HE DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING

08:13:19.456 --> 08:13:25.560
YET. WHAT DO YOU READ INTO THAT 
STATEMENT AND WORK THIS GO FROM 

08:13:25.721 --> 08:13:27.909
HERE?  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: HIS LEGAL PROBLEMS 

08:13:28.113 --> 08:13:32.447
ARE JUST BEGINNING . HE FACES AN
EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF LEGAL 

08:13:33.407 --> 08:13:38.990
SCRUTINY SEPARATE AND APART FROM
JANUARY 6. ESPECIALLY IN NEW 

08:13:39.152 --> 08:13:45.459
YORK WHERE HIS FINANCES ARE 
BEING LOOKED INTO. ON JANUARY 6 

08:13:45.865 --> 08:13:49.879
IN HIS EFFORT TO SPREAD IT OUT 
ABOUT THE ELECTION, HE IS

08:13:53.899 --> 08:13:55.920
UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN 

08:13:56.079 --> 08:14:03.188
ATLANTA. THEY ARE LOOKING INTO 
HIS PHONE CALL WITH BRAD 

08:14:03.348 --> 08:14:08.393
RAFFENSPERGER, THE GEORGIA 
SECRETARY OF STATE. HE TRIED TO 

08:14:08.551 --> 08:14:14.554
ASK FOR ENOUGH VOTES TO BE FOUND
SO THAT HE COULD BE DECLARED THE

08:14:14.705 --> 08:14:16.705
WINNER

08:14:25.043 --> 08:14:27.101
IN GEORGIA. THERE'S ALSO REPORTS
HE MET OTHER PHONE CALLS TO 

08:14:27.318 --> 08:14:29.176
PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH BRAD 
RAFFENSPERGER AND TWO OTHER 

08:14:29.177 --> 08:14:31.177
GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIALS . 
THERE IS CALLS THAT TRUMP MADE 

08:14:31.251 --> 08:14:33.512
TO ELECTION OFFICIALS THAT WE 
KNOW ABOUT IN MICHIGAN AND 

08:14:33.728 --> 08:14:37.646
PENNSYLVANIA AS WELL. 
INTERESTINGLY, HE HAS GOTTEN 

08:14:38.410 --> 08:14:42.463
AWAY WITH SOMETHING WITH THIS 
ACQUITTAL BECAUSE HIS LEGAL TEAM

08:14:43.991 --> 08:14:46.570
CAN ARGUE IN CRIMINAL COURT THAT
HE IS BEEN ACQUITTED

08:14:51.794 --> 08:14:54.076
AND IT IS ADMISSIBLE THAT HE IS 
BEEN ACQUITTED BY THE SENATE. 

08:14:54.288 --> 08:14:56.288
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND HE CAN RUN FOR 
REELECTION.

08:15:00.329 --> 08:15:02.624
HAD THEY VOTED TO CONVICT HIM A 
SIMPLE MAJORITY WOULD HAVE BEEN 

08:15:03.376 --> 08:15:06.407
ALL NEEDED. SENATOR SUSAN 
COLLINS OF MAINE IS ON THE FLOOR

08:15:06.619 --> 08:15:14.462
AND IT IS A REMINDER THAT SHE IS
ONE OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO 

08:15:14.665 --> 08:15:15.724
JOINED TO CONVICT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 

08:15:15.725 --> 08:15:19.591
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO UNDERMINE PUBLIC 
CONFIDENCE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 

08:15:19.747 --> 08:15:25.328
ELECTION, UNLESS HE WANTED. 
EARLY ON THE 

08:15:26.677 --> 08:15:32.487
4 AS THE BALLOTS CONTINUED TO BE
COUNTED, PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMED

08:15:32.647 --> 08:15:38.018
VICTORY AND ASSERTED DEMOCRATS 
WERE TRYING TO STEAL THE 

08:15:38.171 --> 08:15:40.171
ELECTION

08:15:41.828 --> 08:15:44.481
. ON NOVEMBER 8, THE DAY AFTER 
SEVERAL MEDIA OUTLETS HAD 

08:15:44.639 --> 08:15:49.733
DECLARED JOE BIDEN THE APPARENT 
WINNER BASED ON 

08:15:50.656 --> 08:15:57.141
RESULTS, PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED
THIS WAS A STOLEN ELECTION.

08:16:03.404 --> 08:16:08.619
WITHOUT HIS POST ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN, TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME 

08:16:09.383 --> 08:16:13.939
THEY BEGAN. OVER THE ENSUING 
DAYS AND MONTHS, THE PRESIDENT 

08:16:14.097 --> 08:16:16.097
DISTORTED

08:16:20.858 --> 08:16:22.954
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, 
CONTINUING TO CLAIM THAT HE HAD 

08:16:23.172 --> 08:16:26.294
ONE CHECK WHILE COURT AFTER 
COURT THREW OUT HIS LAWSUITS, 

08:16:26.510 --> 08:16:32.032
AND STATES CONTINUED TO CERTIFY 
THEIR RESULTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

08:16:32.185 --> 08:16:36.325
FALSEHOODS CONVINCED A LARGE 
NUMBER OF AMERICANS

08:16:40.335 --> 08:16:45.468
THAT HE HAD WON AND THAT THEY 
WERE BEING CHEATED. THE 

08:16:45.668 --> 08:16:51.648
PRESIDENT ALSO EMBARKED ON AN 
INCREDIBLE EFFORT TO PRESSURE 

08:16:51.846 --> 08:16:56.330
STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS TO 
CHANGE THEIR RESULTS IN THE 

08:16:56.487 --> 08:17:05.905
STATES. THE MOST EGREGIOUS 
EXAMPLE OCCURRED IN JANUARY WITH

08:17:06.106 --> 08:17:10.006
THIS PHONE CALL WHEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COULD BE HEARD ALTERNATING

08:17:11.238 --> 08:17:18.565
BETWEEN LOBBYING AND 
INTIMIDATING AND THREATENING THE

08:17:18.769 --> 08:17:20.769
ELECTION OFFICIALS IN

08:17:26.611 --> 08:17:29.190
GEORGIA. I JUST WANT TO FIND 
11,000 VOTES HE STATED ,

08:17:32.634 --> 08:17:35.868
SEEKING THE EXACT NUMBER OF 
VOTES NEEDED TO CHANGE THE 

08:17:36.025 --> 08:17:38.524
OUTCOME IN THE STATE.

08:17:42.009 --> 08:17:44.671
DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S PLEAS 
AND THREATS,  THE GEORGIA 

08:17:44.885 --> 08:17:51.909
OFFICIALS REFUSED  TO YIELD TO 
THE PRESSURE, AS DID STATE 

08:17:52.066 --> 08:18:00.684
OFFICIALS IN OTHER STATES. IN 
DECEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POST

08:18:01.441 --> 08:18:07.722
ELECTION CAMPAIGN BECAME FOCUSED
ON JANUARY 6, THE DAY CONGRESS 

08:18:08.154 --> 08:18:13.311
WAS SCHEDULED TO COUNT THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. 

08:18:13.514 --> 08:18:18.879
ALTHOUGH THIS COUNTY AND IS A 
CEREMONIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 

08:18:19.028 --> 08:18:21.028
ACT

08:18:22.044 --> 08:18:25.394
, IT IS NEVERTHELESS THE 
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED FINAL 

08:18:25.597 --> 08:18:35.512
STEP IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, 
AND IT MUST OCCUR BEFORE A NEW 

08:18:35.669 --> 08:18:43.798
PRESIDENT CAN BE INAUGURATED. ON
DECEMBER 19, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

08:18:43.958 --> 08:18:45.958
TWEETED

08:18:49.451 --> 08:18:51.451
HIS SUPPORTERS AND SAID A BIG 
PROTEST IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 

08:18:51.522 --> 08:18:57.329
JANUARY 6. BE THERE. IN RESPONSE
, SOME OF HIS CAMPAIGN 

08:18:57.543 --> 08:19:03.734
SUPPORTERS CHANGE THE DATE FOR 
THE PROTEST RALLY AND THEY HAD 

08:19:03.951 --> 08:19:05.951
ORIGINALLY HAD THE SCHEDULED TO 
OCCUR

08:19:09.492 --> 08:19:11.637
AFTER THE INAUGURATION TO HAPPEN
INSTEAD ON JANUARY 6.

08:19:15.280 --> 08:19:18.886
HAVING FAILED TO PERSUADE THE 
COURTS AND STATE ELECTION 

08:19:19.039 --> 08:19:24.526
OFFICIALS, PRESIDENT TRUMP NEXT 
BEGAN TO PRESSURE VICE PRESIDENT

08:19:25.290 --> 08:19:31.191
MIKE PENCE TO USE HIS ROLE UNDER
THE 12th AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN 

08:19:31.953 --> 08:19:33.953
THE ELECTION

08:19:35.277 --> 08:19:38.092
. THE PRESIDENT MET WITH VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON JANUARY 

08:19:38.255 --> 08:19:47.286
6, AND THEN INCREASED THE 
PRESSURE BY TWEETING, IF THE 

08:19:47.489 --> 08:19:53.081
VICE PRESIDENT COMES THROUGH FOR
US, WE WILL WIN THE PRESIDENCY. 

08:19:53.501 --> 08:20:00.357
THAT IS WHAT IT SAID. VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE REFUSED TO 

08:20:00.573 --> 08:20:07.301
YIELD. ISSUED A PUBLIC LETTER ON
JANUARY 6 MAKING CLEAR THAT HIS 

08:20:07.510 --> 08:20:14.562
GOALS TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE 
CONSTITUTION WOULD PREVENT HIM 

08:20:14.777 --> 08:20:16.777
FROM DECIDING UNILATERALLY

08:20:19.487 --> 08:20:23.431
WHICH ELECTORAL VOTES SHOULD BE 
COUNTED AND WHICH SHOULD NOT. 

08:20:23.645 --> 08:20:31.646
DURING HIS SPEECH ON JANUARY 6, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP KEPT UP 

08:20:32.458 --> 08:20:34.458
DRUMBEAT OF PRESSURE

08:20:37.798 --> 08:20:40.798
ON VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. IN
FRONT OF A LARGE, AGITATED CROWD

08:20:42.139 --> 08:20:46.810
, HE URGED THE VICE PRESIDENT TO
STAND UP

08:20:54.606 --> 08:20:56.606
FOR THE GOOD OF OUR 
CONSTITUTION. I HOPE MIKE HAS 

08:20:56.667 --> 08:20:58.953
THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT HE HAS TO
DO, PRESIDENT TRUMP CONCLUDED. 

08:20:59.728 --> 08:21:03.075
MR. PRESIDENT, RATHER THAN 
FACILITATING THE PEACEFUL 

08:21:03.289 --> 08:21:08.153
TRANSFER OF POWER, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS TELLING

08:21:14.495 --> 08:21:16.495
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO 
IGNORE THE CONSTITUTION AND TO 

08:21:16.563 --> 08:21:21.291
REFUSE TO COUNT THE CERTIFIED 
VOTES. HE WAS ALSO FURTHER 

08:21:21.506 --> 08:21:28.500
AGITATING THE CROWD, DIRECTING 
THEM TO MARCH TO THE CAPITOL . 

08:21:28.708 --> 08:21:34.180
IN THIS SITUATION, CONTEXT WAS 
EVERYTHING.

08:21:39.708 --> 08:21:41.708
INTO A PILE OF DRY LEAVES

08:21:44.893 --> 08:21:49.061
IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM TOSSING 
IT INTO A POOL OF WATER. ON 

08:21:49.822 --> 08:21:54.537
JANUARY 6 THE ATMOSPHERE AMONG 
THE CROWD OUTSIDE

08:21:57.103 --> 08:22:00.717
HOUSE WAS COMBUSTIBLE, LARGELY 
THE RESULT

08:22:05.848 --> 08:22:09.249
OF AN ILL WIND BLOWING FROM 
WASHINGTON FOR THE PAST MONTHS. 

08:22:09.464 --> 08:22:13.006
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD STOKED 
DISCONTENT WITH A STEADY BARRAGE

08:22:13.208 --> 08:22:17.139
OF FALSE CLAIMS THAT THE 
ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM 

08:22:17.899 --> 08:22:19.899
HIM. THE

08:22:21.487 --> 08:22:25.795
ALLEGEDLY RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS 
WITH INTEGRATED AND RIDICULED BY

08:22:26.556 --> 08:22:31.705
THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE 
PREDICTABLE RESULT THAT HIS 

08:22:31.919 --> 08:22:38.525
SUPPORTERS VIEWED ANY OFFICIAL 
THAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE AN 

08:22:38.678 --> 08:22:44.084
OBSTACLE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
REELECTION AS AN ENEMY OF THE 

08:22:44.237 --> 08:22:48.962
CAUSE. THAT SET THE STAGE

08:22:52.403 --> 08:22:59.397
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 
200 YEARS.

08:23:03.629 --> 08:23:07.062
NEARLY 30 MINUTES AFTER THE 
CAPITOL  FIRST CAME UNDER ATTACK

08:23:07.411 --> 08:23:14.009
, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, AND EVERYONE ELSE 

08:23:14.213 --> 08:23:16.803
HERE IN THE CAPITOL  WAITED IN 
VAIN

08:23:21.909 --> 08:23:27.949
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO CONDEMN THE
VIOLENCE AND TELL HIS MISGUIDED 

08:23:28.104 --> 08:23:30.822
SUPPORTERS TO LEAVE THE CAPITOL 
.

08:23:34.982 --> 08:23:38.433
RATHER THAN DEMAND AN END TO THE
VIOLENCE, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

08:23:38.588 --> 08:23:44.169
EXPRESSED HIS FRUSTRATION ONCE 
AGAIN THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT 

08:23:44.564 --> 08:23:50.278
HAD NOT STOPPED THE VOTE 
CERTIFICATION AS HE HAD URGED

08:23:53.503 --> 08:23:55.699
. SHORTLY AFTER THE VICE 
PRESIDENT WAS TAKEN AWAY

08:23:59.117 --> 08:24:01.117
FROM THIS CHAMBER TO AVOID THE 
MOB

08:24:06.826 --> 08:24:10.280
CHANTING, HANG MIKE PENCE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED MIKE 

08:24:10.429 --> 08:24:15.672
PENCE DO NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO
DO WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

08:24:19.477 --> 08:24:22.144
. INSTEAD OF PREVENTING A 
DANGEROUS SITUATION, PRESIDENT 

08:24:22.346 --> 08:24:28.995
TRUMP CREATED ONE. RATHER THAN 
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

08:24:29.413 --> 08:24:31.413
TRANSFER OF POWER

08:24:33.760 --> 08:24:39.639
, HE INCITED AN INSURRECTION 
WITH THE PURPOSE OF PREVENTING 

08:24:40.067 --> 08:24:42.067
THAT TRANSFER OF POWER FROM 
INCURRING.

08:24:45.673 --> 08:24:51.671
WHETHER BY DESIGN OR BY VIRTUE 
OF A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE 

08:24:51.870 --> 08:24:53.870
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTION,

08:24:58.053 --> 08:25:01.645
PRESIDENT TRUMP SUBORDINATING 
THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY TO 

08:25:01.857 --> 08:25:08.276
HIS OWN SELFLESS INTEREST 
SELFISH INTEREST BEARS 

08:25:08.483 --> 08:25:16.069
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INVASION 
OF THE CAPITOL . MR. PRESIDENT, 

08:25:16.488 --> 08:25:23.293
THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS NOT 
ABOUT ANY SINGLE WORD UTTERED BY

08:25:24.046 --> 08:25:30.315
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON JANUARY 6, 
2021. IT 

08:25:34.857 --> 08:25:40.676
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAILURE 
TO OBEY THE OATH HE SWORE 

08:25:41.320 --> 08:25:47.902
JANUARY 20, 2017. HIS ACTIONS 
INTERFERE WITH THE PEACEFUL 

08:25:48.116 --> 08:25:54.759
TRANSITION OF POWER, THE 
HOMEWORK OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND

08:25:55.518 --> 08:26:02.772
OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY WHERE AN 
ABUSE OF POWER AND CONSTITUTE 

08:26:02.974 --> 08:26:05.355
GROUNDS FOR CONVICTION.

08:26:09.294 --> 08:26:14.470
TWO ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE 
AGAINST CONVECTION THAT 

08:26:15.228 --> 08:26:19.079
DESERVED, AND. THE FIRST IS THAT
THIS WAS A

08:26:23.637 --> 08:26:28.265
SNAP IMPEACHMENT, THAT THE HOUSE
FAILED TO HOLD HEARINGS, CONDUCT

08:26:29.021 --> 08:26:31.021
AN INVESTIGATION

08:26:32.570 --> 08:26:38.507
, AND INTERVIEW WITNESSES. THAT 
IS TRUE. WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE 

08:26:38.666 --> 08:26:43.521
HOUSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE 
THOROUGH AND COMPILED A MORE 

08:26:44.285 --> 08:26:50.477
COMPLETE RECORD. NEVER THE LESS,
THE RECORD IS CLEAR THAT THE

08:26:52.214 --> 08:27:00.728
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT TRUMP ABUSED
HIS POWER, VIOLATED HIS OATH TO 

08:27:00.924 --> 08:27:02.924
UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION

08:27:05.887 --> 08:27:07.126
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE'RE LEAVING SUSAN COLLINS 

08:27:07.127 --> 08:27:10.216
TO GO TO THE IMPEACHMENT 
MANAGERS WHO ARE ADDRESSING THE 

08:27:10.431 --> 08:27:13.954
PRESS AND THIS IS JAMIE RASKIN  
THAT WE WILL HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE

08:27:14.730 --> 08:27:19.101
TO SAY. IT IS JUST FASCINATING 
TO HEAR A SUSAN COLLINS 

08:27:19.315 --> 08:27:25.284
REASONING WAS FOR HER GUILTY 
THOSE. LET'S GO NOW TO THE HOUSE

08:27:26.043 --> 08:27:28.043
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS.

08:27:31.237 --> 08:27:33.511
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULD LIKE TO START BY 
THANKING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR

08:27:33.713 --> 08:27:39.274
ENGAGING SO SERIOUSLY WITH THIS 
PROCESS. I WANT TO THINK MEMBERS

08:27:39.479 --> 08:27:41.655
OF THE SENATE, THE HOUSE, AND 
THE TERRIFIC MEMBERS OF THE 

08:27:41.795 --> 08:27:43.795
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER TIM.

08:27:46.294 --> 08:27:52.049
TRUMP STORMED OUR HOUSE WITH THE
MOB HE INCITED AND WE DEFENDED 

08:27:52.803 --> 08:27:57.244
OUR HOUSE. HE VIOLATED OUR 
CONSTITUTION, AND WE DEFENDED 

08:27:57.668 --> 08:28:02.210
THE CONSTITUTION. THEY TRIED TO 
TRUST OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE 

08:28:02.413 --> 08:28:04.413
REVIVED IT AND PROTECTED IT

08:28:09.511 --> 08:28:11.511
. THIS WAS THE MOST BIPARTISAN 
PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT IN THE 

08:28:11.596 --> 08:28:16.785
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
WINDOWS THAT IMPEACHMENT FOR 

08:28:16.983 --> 08:28:19.298
REASONS THAT WE COULD EXPLORE 
SOME OTHER TIME BECOME PARTISAN,

08:28:19.499 --> 08:28:23.184
BUT THIS WAS THE MOST BIPARTISAN
IMPEACHMENT EVENT IN THE HISTORY

08:28:23.385 --> 08:28:28.893
OF THE COUNTRY. IT WAS ALSO THE 
LARGEST SENATE VOTE FOR A 

08:28:29.648 --> 08:28:33.865
PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT, 57-43 
AND OF COURSE

08:28:37.284 --> 08:28:42.209
THE VOTE TO IMPEACH 232-197 IN 
THE HOUSE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR 

08:28:42.361 --> 08:28:44.361
MAJORITY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

08:28:48.266 --> 08:28:49.686
THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 
INCITED VIOLENT INSURRECTION 

08:28:49.687 --> 08:28:53.593
AGAINST THE UNION AND AGAINST 
THE CONGRESS. SENATOR MITCH 

08:28:53.801 --> 08:28:55.801
McCONNELL JUST WENT TO THE FLOOR

08:28:59.021 --> 08:29:02.030
ESSENTIALLY TO SAY THAT WE MADE 
OUR CASE ON THE FACT THAT HE 

08:29:02.176 --> 08:29:04.293
BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP WAS 
PRACTICALLY AND MORALLY 

08:29:04.438 --> 08:29:09.179
RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING THE 
EVENTS OF JANUARY 6

08:29:11.786 --> 08:29:14.697
DESCRIBED IT AS A DISGRACEFUL 
DERELICTION OF DUTY, THE 

08:29:14.912 --> 08:29:17.651
DESERTION OF HIS OFFICE, AND 
MADE A SERIES

08:29:27.508 --> 08:29:29.767
OF STATEMENTS THAT WE DO NOT 
EVEN MAKE SAYING THAT THIS WAS 

08:29:29.970 --> 08:29:32.454
NOT OVER YET BY A LONGSHOT, AND 
THAT THERE WAS THE PATH OF 

08:29:32.670 --> 08:29:34.722
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT WHO IS 

08:29:34.936 --> 08:29:41.372
DISGRACED AND TWICE IMPEACHED. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE CONVINCED 

08:29:41.549 --> 08:29:49.227
A BIG MAJORITY IN THE SENATE OF 
OUR CASE. I AM VERY PROUD OF THE

08:29:49.430 --> 08:29:52.334
HARD WORK OF THESE MANAGERS WHO 
WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT OVER 

08:29:53.089 --> 08:29:59.502
SEVERAL WEEKS TO MAKE THIS CASE 
TO THE SENATE AND TO THE UNION.

08:30:03.948 --> 08:30:08.137
I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE WORD 
ABOUT WOMEN SAYS THAT WE WERE 

08:30:08.341 --> 08:30:15.538
ABLE TO GET TREATED WITNESSES 
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET 

08:30:18.080 --> 08:30:22.227
AND GET A STIPULATION TO THE 
STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN JAIME

08:30:22.430 --> 08:30:24.891
HERRERA BEUTLER AND GET IT INTO 
EVIDENCE TODAY  BY ASKING FOR 

08:30:25.093 --> 08:30:30.726
HER AS A WITNESS. IF YOU LISTEN 
TO MITCH McCONNELL AND THE 

08:30:30.932 --> 08:30:32.932
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NOW 
EXPLAINING WHY THEY VOTED

08:30:38.416 --> 08:30:44.242
NOT TO CONVICT, ALL OF THEM ARE 
HINGING IT ON A LEGAL ARGUMENT 

08:30:44.646 --> 08:30:46.959
THAT COULD NEVER BE OVERCOME BY 
ANY NUMBER OF WITNESSES THAT WE 

08:30:47.721 --> 08:30:49.721
COULD'VE HAD

08:30:52.631 --> 08:30:54.460
5000 WITNESSES AND MITCH 
McCONNELL WOULD BE MAKING THE 

08:30:54.461 --> 08:30:56.461
SAME SPEECH BECAUSE HE SAYS THE 
SENATE NEVER HAS JURISDICTION 

08:30:56.553 --> 08:31:01.076
OVER A FORMER RESIDENT THERE FOR
REASONS I DO NOT NEED TO 

08:31:01.220 --> 08:31:05.922
BELABOR, WE REJECT THAT 
COMPLETELY. IT IS AT ODDS WITH 

08:31:06.679 --> 08:31:11.087
OUR HISTORY. THE TEXT OF THE 
CONSTITUTION AND THE ORIGINAL 

08:31:11.303 --> 08:31:17.337
INTENT AND UNDERSTANDING AND THE
SENATE'S OWN PRECEDENTS AND SO 

08:31:17.482 --> 08:31:20.551
ON. NO NUMBER OF WITNESSES 
DEMONSTRATING

08:31:24.228 --> 08:31:28.389
DONALD TRUMP CONTINUED TO INCITE
THE INSURRECTION IS EVEN AFTER 

08:31:28.607 --> 08:31:31.977
THE INVASION OF THE CAPITAL 
WOULD CONVINCE THEM. THEY WERE 

08:31:32.187 --> 08:31:34.187
HINGING IT ON A MATTER OF LAW

08:31:38.826 --> 08:31:40.863
, WHICH WE THOUGHT WE HAD 
SETTLED ON TUESDAY WHEN THE 

08:31:41.067 --> 08:31:43.067
SENATE ELECTED TO EXERCISE 
JURISDICTION AND REJECT THAT 

08:31:43.194 --> 08:31:45.194
ARGUMENT

08:31:48.514 --> 08:31:50.643
. IT IS WHAT IT IS. MITCH 
McCONNELL CLEARLY FEELS DONALD 

08:31:50.839 --> 08:31:53.117
TRUMP REMAINS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, EVEN IF HE

08:31:53.317 --> 08:31:55.317
HAS BEEN DISGRACED

08:31:57.871 --> 08:32:00.387
. THAT IS NOT MY JURISDICTION 
AND I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO 

08:32:00.587 --> 08:32:03.689
SAY ABOUT THAT. THEY WILL HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH THE POLITICAL 

08:32:03.903 --> 08:32:09.671
DYNAMICS WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTY.
WE DID GET

08:32:13.046 --> 08:32:17.595
HE IS A FORMER PRESIDENT NOW, SO
THAT IS GOOD NEWS. HE IS NOT 

08:32:17.796 --> 08:32:20.567
ASSERTING THAT SOMEHOW HE IS 
STILL PRESIDENT AND THEY

08:32:26.242 --> 08:32:28.511
RECOGNIZE AT LEAST IN A DE FACTO
SENSE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE 

08:32:28.713 --> 08:32:30.713
SELECTION, WHICH IS THAT 
PRESIDENT BIDEN WON

08:32:42.307 --> 08:32:44.542
HELP WITH THAT, I WILL CLOSE MY 
REMARKS. QUESTIONS ARE OPEN FOR 

08:32:44.747 --> 08:32:47.526
ANY OF US AND I WILL SHARE THE 
PODIUM WITH MY COLLEAGUES.

08:32:56.757 --> 08:33:04.169
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU POSTED ON THE RAND PAUL 
MOTION. SO WHAT IS SAID ABOUT 

08:33:04.587 --> 08:33:06.813
NOT PUSHING HARDER AGAINST HER 
WITNESSES

08:33:14.979 --> 08:33:17.033
TO SHED MORE LIGHT ON THE 
THINKING YOU COULDN'T HAVE GROWN

08:33:17.260 --> 08:33:19.114
THE NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN 
DEFECTORS? BUCKET THAT I TRUST 

08:33:19.115 --> 08:33:20.763
THAT. DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO 
ADDRESS? 

08:33:20.764 --> 08:33:23.482
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HEARD FROM THE MINORITY 
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL THAT WE 

08:33:23.683 --> 08:33:25.683
HAVE PROVEN THE CASE

08:33:29.054 --> 08:33:31.340
. HE SAID SPECIFICALLY THE HOUSE
MANAGERS HAVE PROVEN THE FACT OF

08:33:32.098 --> 08:33:37.201
THE CASE. BEFORE WE STARTED 
YESTERDAY, WE KNEW WE RESTED 

08:33:37.617 --> 08:33:44.462
WITH OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE. 
THESE WERE ALSO WITNESSES TO THE

08:33:44.601 --> 08:33:50.021
CRIME. THEY KNEW WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING, AND THEN WE FOUND 

08:33:50.781 --> 08:33:54.199
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM 
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BEUTLER  

08:33:54.603 --> 08:34:00.364
WHICH YESTERDAY EVENING WE 
DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO

08:34:00.575 --> 08:34:06.425
AFTER AND WE GOT THAT 
INFORMATION. TO FURTHER AMPLIFY 

08:34:06.841 --> 08:34:11.363
WHAT WE HAD ALREADY PROVEN IN 
COURT. THERE IS NO OTHER 

08:34:12.122 --> 08:34:15.355
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES THAT WERE 
FRIENDLY TO US THAT ONE IS ON 

08:34:16.106 --> 08:34:23.066
THE SCREEN. THE BODY CAMERAS OF 
THE CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS  AND

08:34:23.282 --> 08:34:25.282
HOW MUCH WERE WITHOUT A GIVEN 
THEN

08:34:30.344 --> 08:34:32.187
ACTUAL SCENE THE DAY OF THE 
INSURRECTION? INDIVIDUALS WE 

08:34:32.188 --> 08:34:34.998
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CALLED LIKE 
THE PRESIDENT WHO INVITED IS IN 

08:34:35.151 --> 08:34:38.131
FACT THE DEFENDANT AND DOES NOT 
HAVE TO TESTIFY. OTHERS WHO MAY 

08:34:38.343 --> 08:34:41.478
HAVE BEEN THERE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT WERE NOT A FROM THE 

08:34:41.682 --> 08:34:44.165
WITNESS TO US AND WOULD HAVE 
REQUIRED A SUBPOENA AND THEY ARE

08:34:44.380 --> 08:34:49.085
STILL LITIGATING AGAIN 
IMPEACHMENT ONE YEAR LATER AND 

08:34:49.241 --> 08:34:54.722
SO WE BELIEVE THIS HAS SHOWN 
THAT THIS PRESIDENT IS A 

08:34:54.924 --> 08:34:56.924
DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY. MITCH 
McCONNELL

08:35:03.589 --> 08:35:05.661
HIMSELF SAID THIS. THEY HAVE 
DECIDED TO HANG THEIR HAT ON 

08:35:05.878 --> 08:35:08.292
JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS NOT BASED
IN EVIDENCE OR BASED ON THE 

08:35:08.435 --> 08:35:12.474
FACTS AND TO BE JUDGED FOR THAT 
WE HAVE DONE OUR DUTY TO THE 

08:35:13.226 --> 08:35:15.726
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

08:35:21.545 --> 08:35:24.341
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LET ME INTRODUCE SPEAKER 
PELOSI AND I WILL COME TO YOU 

08:35:24.495 --> 08:35:28.142
NEXT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT HAD NOT BEEN MY ATTENTION 

08:35:28.346 --> 08:35:30.011
TO COME TO THIS PRESENT 
AVAILABILITY, HOWEVER TEMPTING 

08:35:30.012 --> 08:35:35.365
IT WOULD BE TO SING THE PRAISES 
OF OUR HOUSE MANAGERS ON BEHALF 

08:35:36.121 --> 08:35:40.991
NOT ONLY OF THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES BUT ON BEHALF OF

08:35:41.199 --> 08:35:45.752
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I HAVE TO 
SAY ON BEHALF OF MY 

08:35:45.906 --> 08:35:51.786
GRANDCHILDREN TO HELP FROM EACH 
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. WE CANNOT 

08:35:52.544 --> 08:35:59.261
BE PROUDER OF YOUR PATRIOTIC 
PRESENTATIONS, THE CLARITY WITH 

08:35:59.463 --> 08:36:03.373
WHICH HE PRESENTED, AND THE 
INSPIRATION THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

08:36:03.575 --> 08:36:05.575
TO SO MANY PEOPLE.

08:36:11.634 --> 08:36:13.950
THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT REMINDS 
ME WHEN WE RECRUIT CANDIDATES TO

08:36:14.149 --> 08:36:19.564
RUN FOR OFFICE , WE ALWAYS SAY I
COULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

08:36:19.780 --> 08:36:23.635
UNIVERSITY OR THE HEAD OF MY 
HOSPITAL DEPARTMENT OR THIS OR 

08:36:23.783 --> 08:36:25.844
THAT. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

08:36:31.297 --> 08:36:33.760
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO RUN 
FOR CONGRESS. WE ALWAYS SAY WE 

08:36:33.974 --> 08:36:36.272
DO NOT WANT ANYBODY WITHOUT 
OPTIONS IF THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 

08:36:36.482 --> 08:36:38.635
LOOKING TO YOU TO RUN, BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE OPTIONS

08:36:43.064 --> 08:36:45.971
. THAT SHOULD NOT BE A REASON 
FOR YOU NOT TO RUN. WHAT WE SAW 

08:36:46.186 --> 08:36:48.226
TODAY WAS A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS
WHO APPARENTLY HAVE NO OPTIONS 

08:36:48.439 --> 08:36:54.240
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID TO 
DEFEND THEIR JOB TO PROTECT THE 

08:36:54.454 --> 08:36:58.535
INSTITUTION IN WHICH THEY SERVE.
IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE 

08:36:58.680 --> 08:37:02.418
VANDALIZED AND SO MANY BAD WAYS

08:37:06.248 --> 08:37:08.730
THAT I WILL NOT EVEN GO INTO 
HERE AND THAT THEY WERE NOT 

08:37:08.946 --> 08:37:10.946
RESPECT THEIR ATTITUDES THAT'S 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, 

08:37:11.339 --> 08:37:13.339
MIKE PENCE,

08:37:14.811 --> 08:37:20.479
HANG MIKE PENCE WAS THE CHANT 
AND THEY JUST DISMISS THAT. WHY?

08:37:25.298 --> 08:37:27.298
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET 
ANOTHER JOB. WHAT IS SO 

08:37:27.356 --> 08:37:31.485
IMPORTANT ABOUT ANY ONE OF US? 
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THE 

08:37:31.684 --> 08:37:37.091
POLITICAL SURVIVAL OF ANYONE OF 
US THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 

08:37:37.292 --> 08:37:41.597
EVER CONSTITUTION THAT WE TAKE 
AN OATH TO PROTECT AND DEFEND? 

08:37:42.015 --> 08:37:45.329
BUT WHY I CAME OVER WAS BECAUSE 
I LISTENED TO MITCH McCONNELL. 

08:37:46.087 --> 08:37:51.722
MITCH McCONNELL WHO WHEN THIS 
DISTINGUISHED GROUP OF HOUSE 

08:37:51.938 --> 08:37:53.938
MANAGERS WERE GATHERED

08:37:58.963 --> 08:38:01.367
ON JANUARY 15 TO DELIVER THE 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT CANNOT

08:38:10.787 --> 08:38:12.682
BE RECEIVED BECAUSE MITCH 
McCONNELL HAD SHUT DOWN THE 

08:38:12.683 --> 08:38:15.483
SENATE AND WAS GOING TO KEEP IT 
SHUT DOWN UNTIL THE INAUGURATION

08:38:16.681 --> 08:38:19.319
FOR HIM TO MAKE THIS INDICTMENT 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND THEN 

08:38:19.470 --> 08:38:25.574
SAY BUT I CANNOT VOTE FOR IT 
BECAUSE IT IS AFTER THE FACT THE

08:38:25.787 --> 08:38:27.787
FACT THAT HE ESTABLISHED

08:38:30.783 --> 08:38:35.145
THAT IT CANNOT BE DELIVERED 
BEFORE THE INTEGRATION. WHEN YOU

08:38:35.359 --> 08:38:39.587
THINK ABOUT JANUARY 6 BETWEEN 
JANUARY 6 AND JANUARY 20, YOU 

08:38:39.790 --> 08:38:42.231
ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT TWO WEEKS
.

08:38:48.109 --> 08:38:52.823
SO THE BIG LIE THAT WE TALKED 
ABOUT, STOP THE STEAL 

08:38:56.656 --> 08:38:58.918
, WAS THE MOMENTUM FOR GETTING 
THESE PEOPLE ON THE SIXTH. THEY 

08:38:59.117 --> 08:39:01.117
HONESTLY BELIEVE FOR WHATEVER 
REASON,

08:39:04.240 --> 08:39:08.525
MAYBE TOO MUCH SOCIAL MEDIA, WHY
THEY WERE THINKING THAT WAS TRUE

08:39:09.285 --> 08:39:15.919
THE ELECTION WAS NOT LEGITIMATE.
SO A WEEK 

08:39:19.433 --> 08:39:22.976
IN THE HOUSE AND THANK YOU TO 
THOSE OF YOU  WHO PARTICIPATED 

08:39:23.951 --> 08:39:30.307
RIGHT AWAY WITH JAMIE RASKIN,  
TED LIEU, AND

08:39:35.118 --> 08:39:37.387
DAVID CICILLINE. THEY HAD IT 
READY TO GO AND THEN TWO DAYS 

08:39:37.588 --> 08:39:41.554
LATER  READY WITH THE CASE TO 
TAKE TO THE SENATE. WE CANNOT 

08:39:41.768 --> 08:39:43.768
RECEIVE IT. AND THEN

08:39:48.876 --> 08:39:51.636
BY THE LAW IT SHOWS YOU RECEIVED
IN THE NEXT DAY START THE TRIAL.

08:39:51.838 --> 08:39:53.838
SO FOR MITCH McCONNELL

08:40:02.405 --> 08:40:04.473
, WHO CREATED THE SITUATION 
WHERE IT CANNOT HAVE BEEN HIRED 

08:40:04.688 --> 08:40:06.973
BEFORE THE 20th, OR EVEN BEGUN 
BEFORE THE 20th IN THE SENATE, 

08:40:07.175 --> 08:40:13.764
TO SAY ALL THE THINGS THAT HE 
SAID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HOW 

08:40:13.964 --> 08:40:17.640
HORRIBLE HE WAS AND IS, AND THEN
SAY,

08:40:22.624 --> 08:40:25.664
BUT THE TIME THAT THE HOUSE 
CHOSE TO BRING OVER. WE DID NOT 

08:40:25.813 --> 08:40:27.813
CHOOSE

08:40:32.043 --> 08:40:34.503
. YOU CHOSE NOT TO RECEIVE IT I 
THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. 

08:40:34.717 --> 08:40:36.717
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:40:40.239 --> 08:40:42.731
YOU CAN HAVE THE CASE AFTER THE 
PERSON IS OUT OF OFFICE. THE 

08:40:42.932 --> 08:40:46.310
SENATE RULES AND THAT WAY ON 
THIS

08:40:52.149 --> 08:40:54.609
SO YOU DO NOT MATTER ACCEPTED 
WAS NOT THE REASON THAT HE VOTED

08:40:54.806 --> 08:40:56.806
THE WAY THAT HE DID

08:41:01.016 --> 08:41:03.950
. IT WAS THE EXCUSE THAT HE 
USED. THAT IS WHY I THINK IT IS 

08:41:04.166 --> 08:41:09.568
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT WAS A 
VERY IMPORTANT SPEECH. I THOUGHT

08:41:09.768 --> 08:41:11.880
THE SPEECH OF CHUCK SCHUMER WAS 
REMARKABLE. I THINK HE WAS 

08:41:12.094 --> 08:41:15.838
INSPIRED BY ALL OF YOU BECAUSE 
YOU RAISED THE LEVEL ALL OF ALL 

08:41:16.056 --> 08:41:18.984
OF THIS TO SUCH A PLACE OF 
PATRIOTISM AND KNOWLEDGE OF OUR 

08:41:19.186 --> 08:41:23.716
HISTORY AND WHAT WE OWE OUR 
CHILDREN. WE ALWAYS SAY ONGOING 

08:41:23.925 --> 08:41:25.925
DIVISION OF OUR FOUNDERS

08:41:28.554 --> 08:41:31.724
, WORTHY OF THE SACRIFICE OF OUR
MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, AND 

08:41:31.924 --> 08:41:35.881
RESPECTING THE ASPIRATIONS OF 
OUR CHILDREN. THEY DID ALL OF 

08:41:36.086 --> 08:41:42.479
THAT. AS THE DISTINGUISHED 
MANAGER SAID EARLIER ON THIS 

08:41:43.237 --> 08:41:47.966
PRESIDENTIAL WEEKEND, HER SENSE 
OF PATRIOTISM IS STIRRED

08:41:52.448 --> 08:41:55.160
, AND WE ARE CALLED UPON IN A 
STRONGER WAY. I WANT TO THANK 

08:41:55.363 --> 08:42:02.712
THEM. THANK YOU  VERY MUCH 
MADELEINE DEAN,  STACEY 

08:42:02.868 --> 08:42:07.287
PLASKETT, TED LIEU, JOE NEGUSE ,

08:42:11.676 --> 08:42:13.676
JOAQUIN CASTRO .

08:42:18.947 --> 08:42:21.223
WE JUST COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD 
AND I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY 

08:42:21.434 --> 08:42:24.249
GRANDCHILDREN WHO ARE VERY SAD 
THAT JUSTICE WAS NOT DONE. BY 15

08:42:24.407 --> 08:42:27.062
VOTES THE SENATE VOTED TO 
CONVICT

08:42:43.520 --> 08:42:45.384
A GOOD BIPARTISAN STATEMENT 
ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED. IT 

08:42:45.385 --> 08:42:47.054
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
WITHOUT THAT BRILLIANT 

08:42:47.055 --> 08:42:49.353
PRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT
AND I YIELDED THE FLOOR BACK TO 

08:42:49.568 --> 08:42:53.032
ALL OF YOU AS I LEAVE . 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WAS GOING TO GO NEXT TO 

08:42:53.189 --> 08:42:55.966
SCOTT. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS GOING TO ASK THE SPEAKER 

08:42:56.167 --> 08:43:01.023
IF SHE HAD A COMMENT. THE 
PRESIDENT SO WAS LIABLE

08:43:04.459 --> 08:43:10.198
CRIMINALLY FOR EVERYTHING HE DID
IN OFFICE PRODUCING NOW THAT THE

08:43:10.400 --> 08:43:12.716
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR THE STATE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD PURSUE? 

08:43:12.894 --> 08:43:17.628
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HE EVEN HEDGED ON THAT. DO 
YOU REMEMBER WHEN HE TALKED 

08:43:18.387 --> 08:43:23.532
ABOUT INCITEMENT? HE WAS HEDGING
ALL OVER THE PLACE

08:43:26.544 --> 08:43:29.788
. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS FOR 
DONORS OR WHAT, BUT WHATEVER IT 

08:43:29.945 --> 08:43:31.945
WAS

08:43:34.830 --> 08:43:36.937
, IT WAS A VERY DISINGENUOUS 
SPEECH. I SAY THAT REGRETTABLY 

08:43:37.135 --> 08:43:39.673
BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANT TO BE ABLE
TO WORK WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF 

08:43:39.873 --> 08:43:43.595
THE OTHER PARTY. I THINK OUR 
COUNTRY NEEDS A STRONG 

08:43:44.354 --> 08:43:49.590
REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO HAVE TRIED 

08:43:49.793 --> 08:43:55.397
TO OF HAD IT EVERY WHICH WAY. 
WILL BE GOING FORWARD TO MAKE 

08:43:55.603 --> 08:43:58.917
SURE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS 
AGAIN IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING 

08:43:59.123 --> 08:44:04.607
AND EVALUATING WHAT CAUSED THIS 
IN TERMS OF ITS MOTIVATION BUT 

08:44:04.761 --> 08:44:06.761
ALSO

08:44:11.298 --> 08:44:13.993
IN TERMS OF THE SECURITY THAT WE
HAVE TO HAVE AS WE GO FORTH, 

08:44:14.201 --> 08:44:16.201
RECOGNIZING HOW INFLAMING EVEN 
SOME OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS 

08:44:16.636 --> 08:44:20.173
CAN BE. I DEFER TO ALL OF THESE 
DISTINGUISHED LAWYERS ABOUT THIS

08:44:20.872 --> 08:44:22.872
.

08:44:25.861 --> 08:44:28.946
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS CENSURE AN OPTION

08:44:32.553 --> 08:44:34.480
? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS EVERYBODY OFF THE 

08:44:34.481 --> 08:44:41.822
HOOK. THESE COWARDLY SENATORS 
WHO CANNOT FACE 

08:44:43.455 --> 08:44:47.058
PRESIDENT DID AND WHAT WAS AT 
STAKE FOR OUR COUNTRY ARE NOT 

08:44:47.245 --> 08:44:54.280
GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO GET A 
SLAP ON THE WRIST. WE DO NOT 

08:44:54.684 --> 08:44:56.949
CENSURE PEOPLE FOR INCITING 
INSURRECTION  THAT KILLS PEOPLE 

08:44:57.701 --> 08:45:01.429
IN THE CAPITOL.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES?

08:45:06.788 --> 08:45:08.788
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS A

08:45:12.153 --> 08:45:17.873
NOTE FROM A DEPOSITION POSSIBLY 
LEAVING TWO OTHER DEPOSITIONS. 

08:45:18.291 --> 08:45:24.131
DID YOU TRY AND REACH OUT TO HER
AT ALL SEPARATELY?

08:45:27.884 --> 08:45:29.314
HOUSE GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN 
IT? 

08:45:29.315 --> 08:45:31.315
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW WHAT,

08:45:37.727 --> 08:45:40.203
WE TRIED THIS CASE AS 
AGGRESSIVELY AS WE COULD ON THE 

08:45:40.419 --> 08:45:42.419
LAW AND ON THE FACTS.

08:45:46.235 --> 08:45:48.235
WE GOT EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED

08:45:53.513 --> 08:45:55.414
WHICH WAS ENTERING INTO THE 
EVIDENTIARY RECORD OF THE 

08:45:55.415 --> 08:45:57.415
STATEMENT BY ARE CALLING 
CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BEUTLER 

08:46:00.407 --> 08:46:02.929
. I WAS ABLE TO READ THAT BEFORE
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, AND IT 

08:46:03.143 --> 08:46:06.911
BECAME A PART OF THE CASE. WE 
COULD'VE HAD 500 WITNESSES

08:46:10.388 --> 08:46:12.877
, AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE OVERCOME
THE KIND OF ARGUMENTS BEING MADE

08:46:13.079 --> 08:46:15.079
WHO WERE HANGING THEIR HATS

08:46:26.156 --> 08:46:28.210
THAT WAS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL TO 
TRY A FORMER PRESIDENT OR THE 

08:46:28.410 --> 08:46:30.410
FIRST AMENDMENT GAVE HIM A RIGHT
TO INCITE INSURRECTION AGAINST 

08:46:31.062 --> 08:46:33.062
THE UNION.

08:46:37.982 --> 08:46:40.028
WE THINK WE OVERWHELMINGLY PROVE
THEIR CASE AND THE STATEMENT OF 

08:46:40.234 --> 08:46:42.898
MITCH McCONNELL SHOW THEY KNEW 
WE DID AND ALL THAT MIGHT'VE 

08:46:43.054 --> 08:46:45.054
HAPPENED

08:46:49.401 --> 08:46:51.673
IF WE HAD BARGAINED FOR 10 
WITNESSES ON OUR SIDE AND 10 

08:46:51.875 --> 08:46:53.875
WITNESSES ON THEIR SIDE, THE 
FIRST PERSON THEY SAID THEY 

08:46:53.921 --> 08:46:59.338
WANTED TO BRING UP AND 
CROSS-EXAMINE IS NANCY PELOSI 

08:46:59.758 --> 08:47:02.053
THEY WOULD HAVE TURNED THIS INTO
A CIRCUIT AND WE CONDUCTED WITH 

08:47:02.809 --> 08:47:09.005
THE QUORUM. YOU CAN SEE THE 
CONDUCT OF THE LAWYERS ON THE 

08:47:09.208 --> 08:47:12.229
OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE
TRACK RECORD IS OF DONALD TRUMP.

08:47:21.385 --> 08:47:23.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHY DID SHE NOT RAISE HER 
COMMENTS SOONER?

08:47:29.652 --> 08:47:31.945
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW THE
STATEMENT WAS YESTERDAY. THAT 

08:47:32.147 --> 08:47:34.147
STATEMENT WAS RELEASED 
YESTERDAY.

08:47:48.057 --> 08:47:50.106
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT THE 
PREMISES THAT SOMEHOW WE FAILED 

08:47:50.320 --> 08:47:53.070
TO PROVE THE FACTS OF THE CASE 
AND IN THE EYES OF THE COUNTRY 

08:47:53.289 --> 08:47:55.289
WE OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED THE 
FACTS OF THE CASE. SENATOR 

08:47:55.301 --> 08:47:57.462
McCONNELL JUST CONCEDED THAT 
THAT THAT WASN'T THE ISSUE

08:48:02.080 --> 08:48:04.749
FOR YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE 43 
SENATORS WHO SAY NO, THE FACTS 

08:48:04.951 --> 08:48:07.045
WOULD HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE 
TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT 

08:48:07.259 --> 08:48:09.259
THINK HE WAS SUBJECT TO THE 
JURISDICTION OF THE SENATE. 

08:48:09.351 --> 08:48:13.469
FORGIVE ME FOR REACTING STRONGLY
TO THAT, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME TO 

08:48:13.674 --> 08:48:15.674
BE A BIZARRE CONCLUSION

08:48:18.604 --> 08:48:22.376
TO SAY THAT SOMEHOW IF WE HAD 
ONE MORE WITNESS MITCH McCONNELL

08:48:22.584 --> 08:48:25.555
WOULD'VE COME OVER TO OUR SIDE. 
JUST LISTEN TO HIS WORDS.

08:48:39.501 --> 08:48:41.950
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DID THE WHITE HOUSE TELL YOU 
THEY WANTED IT AS SHORT AS 

08:48:42.167 --> 08:48:44.460
POSSIBLE? BUT I NEVER SPOKE TO 
ANYONE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. AND

08:48:44.679 --> 08:48:49.676
I MADE THE CALL. SO IF YOU WANT 
TO BLAME SOMEBODY. 

08:48:49.677 --> 08:48:55.884
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 
IN TERMS OF WITNESSES WHO EXPECT

08:48:56.097 --> 08:49:00.287
WHEN YOU GET IN A SITUATION LIKE
THIS, IF WE HAD NEEDED ANY 

08:49:00.487 --> 08:49:03.873
WITNESSES TO MAKE THEIR CASE HE 
WOULD'VE INSISTED ON

08:49:08.984 --> 08:49:11.292
WITNESSES IN A SIX WEEK TRIAL 
BUT WE DO NOT. WE OVERWHELMINGLY

08:49:11.491 --> 08:49:13.133
PROVED OUR CASE. SENATOR 
McCONNELL JUST CONCEDED THAT. 

08:49:13.134 --> 08:49:16.713
ALL OF THEM SAY YOU WANT CHECK 
ON THE FACTS.

08:49:22.245 --> 08:49:28.026
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU SAID SOMETHING. WE HAVE 
TWO THING TO DO. WE HAD TO HAVE 

08:49:28.782 --> 08:49:30.782
A MOTION

08:49:39.818 --> 08:49:41.818
FOR WITNESSES, WHICH WE DID 
WHICH WAS AFTER THE PROSECUTION 

08:49:41.848 --> 08:49:44.349
AND THE DEFENSE MADE THE CASE WE
MADE A MOTION TO ALLOW FOR 

08:49:44.562 --> 08:49:46.562
WITNESSES, AND THEN AFTER THAT 
WE REQUESTED ONE WITNESS. THE 

08:49:46.609 --> 08:49:51.096
REPUBLICAN COUNSEL  SAID HE WAS 
GOING TO BRING 100 WITNESSES. WE

08:49:51.248 --> 08:49:58.175
GOT STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN 
JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER . THE 

08:49:58.385 --> 08:50:02.113
DEFENSE GOT NOTHING. I THINK 
THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS 

08:50:02.328 --> 08:50:09.295
MAKING A LOT AND DISMISSING THE 
INCREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF HAVOC, MY

08:50:09.448 --> 08:50:16.750
HIM, AND WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAD
DONE OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS TO 

08:50:16.963 --> 08:50:18.963
BRING DESTRUCTION TO OUR 
DEMOCRACY

08:50:21.730 --> 08:50:24.007
BY TALKING ABOUT IF YOU ARE TWO 
OR THREE MORE WITNESSES WHICH 

08:50:24.221 --> 08:50:28.345
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REMEMBER THERE IS A REASON 

08:50:28.540 --> 08:50:32.922
THE REQUEST FOR WITNESSES COMES 
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE 

08:50:33.326 --> 08:50:35.326
THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SEE THE FORMER PRESIDENTS 

08:50:35.936 --> 08:50:40.450
COUNSEL  AND DECIDE IF WE NEEDED
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES

08:50:44.941 --> 08:50:47.452
THAT WE HAD DOZENS OF WITNESSES 
AND IT WAS ONLY LEFT THAT WE 

08:50:47.662 --> 08:50:49.662
LEARNED ABOUT THIS NEW 
INFORMATION THAT WE GOT THE BEST

08:50:49.775 --> 08:50:51.775
OF BOTH WORDS

08:50:59.528 --> 08:51:01.796
. WE GOT THE TESTIMONY IN THE 
RECORD BEFORE THE JURY WITHOUT 

08:51:02.011 --> 08:51:04.011
ANY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH IT. 
THIS IS A CONGRESSWOMAN WHO 

08:51:04.091 --> 08:51:06.751
REPEATS A TELEPHONE CALL BETWEEN
KEVIN McCARTHY AND THE FORMER 

08:51:06.969 --> 08:51:08.969
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
IN WHICH KEVIN McCARTHY IS 

08:51:09.072 --> 08:51:11.072
PLEADING FOR HELP AND THE 
PRESIDENT FIRST TRIES TO BLAME 

08:51:11.734 --> 08:51:16.364
INTO THE AND HE SAYS THESE ARE 
YOUR SUPPORTERS AND WE ARE IN 

08:51:16.567 --> 08:51:18.644
DANGER AND HE SAYS MAYBE THEY 
CARE MORE ABOUT THE ELECTION 

08:51:18.846 --> 08:51:23.217
THAN YOU DO THINK THAT CAME 
THROUGH THE STATEMENT READ BY 

08:51:23.378 --> 08:51:25.378
MR. RASKIN 

08:51:27.931 --> 08:51:30.446
BUT WE GOT THE EVIDENCE IN THAT 
WE WANTED TO PRESENT AND THAT 

08:51:30.650 --> 08:51:35.107
WAS A VICTORY. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE DEFENDANT PRESIDENT TRUMP

08:51:43.317 --> 08:51:45.653
WAS LEFT OFF ON A TECHNICALITY, 
AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU

08:51:45.862 --> 08:51:48.700
HEARD MITCH McCONNELL SAY THAT 
THEY LET HIM OFF ON A PROCEDURAL

08:51:48.851 --> 08:51:52.519
ISSUE, WHICH WAS BECAUSE OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MATTER.

08:51:52.736 --> 08:51:54.709
THE COLONEL PROCEED TO THE 
SUBSTANCE DOCTRINAL 

08:51:54.710 --> 08:51:56.710
INTERPRETATION

08:52:10.801 --> 08:52:12.875
BOTH ON THE LIBERAL SIDE AND THE
CONSERVATIVE SIDE DISAGREES WITH

08:52:13.074 --> 08:52:15.373
THAT ASSESSMENT, BUT THEY LET 
HIM OFF ON A TECHNICALITY . YOU 

08:52:15.574 --> 08:52:17.652
ALSO HEARD MITCH McCONNELL SAY 
THAT WE PROVED OUR CASE THAT 

08:52:17.851 --> 08:52:19.744
SUBSTANTIVELY DONALD TRUMP IS 
GUILTY  OF INCITING INSURRECTION

08:52:19.745 --> 08:52:23.417
AND I KNOW FOR ALL OF US IT HAS 
BEEN AN HONOR TO WORK ON THIS 

08:52:23.574 --> 08:52:31.238
CASE, AND EVEN THOUGH WE DID NOT
GET 67 VOTES, THIS HAS BEEN THE 

08:52:31.434 --> 08:52:34.348
MOST BIPARTISAN VOTE FOR 
IMPEACHMENT EVER AND WE KNOW 

08:52:34.552 --> 08:52:39.146
THAT WE SPOKE THE TRUTH ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR. THE AMERICAN 

08:52:39.359 --> 08:52:45.363
PEOPLE BY AND LARGE HAVE AGREED 
WITH US. ONE FINAL REMARK ON ALL

08:52:46.132 --> 08:52:53.211
OF THIS COMMIT THIS EPISODE FROM
JANUARY 6 HAS BEEN VERY TAXING 

08:52:53.634 --> 08:52:55.634
ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

08:52:58.210 --> 08:53:00.826
USHERING IN A NEW ERA, THANKS TO
DONALD TRUMP, OF POLITICAL 

08:53:00.985 --> 08:53:07.529
VIOLENCE. MOST OF ALL, MY 
REACTION TO THE DECISION OF A 

08:53:07.742 --> 08:53:12.879
MAJORITY OF SENATORS NOT TO 
CONVICT DONALD TRUMP DESPITE THE

08:53:13.094 --> 08:53:18.740
EVIDENCE IS NOT ONLY SADNESS BUT
ALSO APPREHENSION FOR THE NATION

08:53:27.168 --> 08:53:29.264
BECAUSE AS I SAID DURING MY 
REMARKS, THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF 

08:53:29.485 --> 08:53:31.572
THE DEFENSE COUNSEL IS THAT 
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG  WITH 

08:53:31.785 --> 08:53:34.651
WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID AND HE 
COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. AS A

08:53:34.852 --> 08:53:37.719
NATION WE JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT
THAT IS NOT THE CASE

08:53:42.307 --> 08:53:44.153
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK WE WILL CLOSE IT UP. 

08:53:44.154 --> 08:53:46.253
I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY 
THAT THIS WAS THE MOST 

08:53:47.023 --> 08:53:50.650
BIPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND

08:53:50.854 --> 08:53:52.861
THE LARGEST VOTE IN THE U.S. 
SENATE EVER 

08:53:57.080 --> 08:53:59.923
TO CONVICT A PRESIDENT WHO HAS 
BEEN IMPEACHED. IT WAS THE MOST 

08:54:00.107 --> 08:54:04.261
BIPARTISAN CONVICTION VOTE IN 
THE SENATE THAT WE HAVE EVER 

08:54:04.411 --> 08:54:07.860
SEEN IN THE CASE OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT. THERE 

08:54:08.063 --> 08:54:10.885
IS ONE OTHER NUMBER TO LOOK OUT 
FOR IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY

08:54:15.975 --> 08:54:18.254
PICKED THERE IS 57 SENATORS WHO 
VOTED TO CONVICT ON THE FACTS 

08:54:18.467 --> 08:54:21.286
AND THE LAW. ADD TO THAT THE 
NUMBER OF SENATORS WHO SAY

08:54:25.765 --> 08:54:27.765
THEY BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP WAS 
FACTUALLY GUILTY BUT THAT THE 

08:54:27.881 --> 08:54:29.881
SENATE DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION
OR THERE WAS SOME OTHER 

08:54:30.513 --> 08:54:34.314
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE TO TAKE THE
ONES WHO SAY WE DO NOT THINK 

08:54:34.527 --> 08:54:38.051
THAT WE COULD CONVICT HIM 
BECAUSE OF THIS EXCEPTION. HE 

08:54:38.265 --> 08:54:41.236
WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT AT 
THE END OF HIS TERM

08:54:50.109 --> 08:54:52.788
. IF 20 OF THEM SAY THAT, THAT 
MEANS YOU HAVE A SUPER MAJORITY 

08:54:53.000 --> 08:54:55.107
WHO SAY THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 
IS GUILTY OF THESE CRIMES, WHICH

08:54:55.322 --> 08:54:57.931
WE THINK WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THANK YOU 

08:55:04.147 --> 08:55:05.585
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS A POSTTRIAL PRESS 

08:55:05.586 --> 08:55:07.274
CONFERENCE WITH THE HOUSE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS, WHO ARE 

08:55:07.275 --> 08:55:09.275
PROUD OF THE PROSECUTION DESPITE
LOSING THE VOTE.

08:55:16.195 --> 08:55:18.056
JAMIE RASKIN SAID DONALD TRUMP 
TRASHED OUR CONSTITUTION AND 

08:55:18.057 --> 08:55:19.908
THEY DEFENDED IT. HE MENTIONED 
MITCH McCONNELL'S COMMENTS ON 

08:55:19.909 --> 08:55:23.820
THE SENATE FLOOR AS A COMPLEMENT
TO THE CASE . HOUSE SPEAKER 

08:55:24.021 --> 08:55:26.021
NANCY PELOSI SHOWED UP AND 
CALLED REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE

08:55:26.107 --> 08:55:28.249
WHO VOTED ACQUITTAL COWARDLY, 
TAKING AIM AT MITCH McCONNELL

08:55:34.178 --> 08:55:36.469
WHO REFUSED TO CALL THE SENATE 
BACK WHEN TRUMP WAS STILL IN 

08:55:36.672 --> 08:55:40.020
OFFICE. TO CATCH YOU UP ON THIS 
BREAKING NEWS DAY, THE SENATE 

08:55:40.222 --> 08:55:43.709
HAS VOTED TO ACQUIT 57-43 THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

08:55:43.862 --> 08:55:45.862
STATES

08:55:50.924 --> 08:55:52.577
DONALD TRUMP IN HIS SECOND 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. SEVEN 

08:55:52.578 --> 08:55:54.426
REPUBLICANS JOINED THE 
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN A VOTE TO 

08:55:54.427 --> 08:55:56.427
CONVICT TRUMP ON THE CHARGE OF 
INSURRECTION 

08:56:00.434 --> 08:56:02.309
PRACTICES THE MOST BIPARTISAN 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN HISTORY BUT

08:56:02.310 --> 08:56:06.488
EVEN THAT VOTE COUNT WAS NOT 
ENOUGH TO MEET THE THRESHOLD 

08:56:06.893 --> 08:56:08.574
NEEDED FOR CONVICTION. THE 
PARTICULAR BONE SPEAKER PELOSI 

08:56:08.575 --> 08:56:13.538
WAS PICKING AT IS THAT IT WAS UP
TO MITCH McCONNELL. HE WAS THE 

08:56:13.740 --> 08:56:15.740
ONE WHO DECIDED

08:56:19.519 --> 08:56:21.803
NOT TO ALLOW THIS ARTICLE TO GO 
FORWARD TO THE SENATE. HIS 

08:56:22.018 --> 08:56:26.360
REASON FOR NOT VOTING TO CONVICT
WAS ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS 

08:56:26.776 --> 08:56:28.849
LET'S PLAY A PART OF THE SPEECH 
THAT THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 

08:56:29.052 --> 08:56:31.052
ARE REFERRING TO.

08:56:34.402 --> 08:56:36.402
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL 
LIABLE FOR EVERYTHING HE DID 

08:56:36.482 --> 08:56:38.482
WHILE IN OFFICE. AS AN ORDINARY 
CITIZEN

08:56:44.771 --> 08:56:46.869
. UNLESS THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS IS RUN, HE IS STILL 

08:56:47.083 --> 08:56:49.350
LIABLE FOR EVERYTHING HE DID 
WHAT HE WAS IN OFFICE. YOU DO 

08:56:49.551 --> 08:56:51.551
NOT GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING YET.

08:56:57.352 --> 08:56:59.458
WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE 

08:56:59.658 --> 08:57:02.395
CIVIL LITIGATION. FORMER 
PRESIDENTS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM 

08:57:02.609 --> 08:57:04.609
BEING ACCOUNTABLE BY EITHER ONE

08:57:08.284 --> 08:57:09.566
. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WAS LATER MITCH 

08:57:09.567 --> 08:57:12.795
McCONNELL ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
AFTER THE SENATE VOTED TO ACQUIT

08:57:13.653 --> 08:57:15.653
DONALD TRUMP. LET'S BRING

08:57:19.794 --> 08:57:21.439
JAMES HOHMANN INTO THE 
CONVERSATION AND YOU CAN 

08:57:21.440 --> 08:57:26.052
UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION OF 
SPEAKER PELOSI  BECAUSE IT IS 

08:57:26.266 --> 08:57:32.048
LIKE HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT
TOO. YOU HEAR CONDEMNING THE 

08:57:32.250 --> 08:57:34.345
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE 

08:57:34.547 --> 08:57:38.691
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER SPEAK 
ON THE TAIL OF MITCH McCONNELL 

08:57:38.907 --> 08:57:42.035
CONDEMNING THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 

08:57:42.036 --> 08:57:44.036
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DOES MAKE IT REALLY HARD

08:57:51.355 --> 08:57:53.035
THAT THE SPEECH OF MITCH 
McCONNELL COMBINED WITH 

08:57:53.036 --> 08:57:55.295
STATEMENTS FROM ROB PORTMAN WHO 
VOTED NOT GUILTY OR PUT OUT A 

08:57:55.509 --> 08:57:58.020
STATEMENT TO SAY WHAT HE DID WAS
INEXCUSABLE BUT I AM OPPOSING 

08:57:58.224 --> 08:58:00.224
IMPEACHMENT, IT REALLY DOES MEAN

08:58:07.772 --> 08:58:10.067
EVEN THOUGH HE WILL BE ELIGIBLE 
AGAIN IN 2024 AND WILL CONTINUE 

08:58:10.283 --> 08:58:12.359
TO BE THE DOMINANT FORCE IN 
REPUBLICAN POLITICS, IT IS NOT 

08:58:12.561 --> 08:58:14.406
ANYTHING LIKE EXONERATION. IT 
FEELS DIFFERENT THAN ONE YEAR 

08:58:14.407 --> 08:58:16.771
AGO WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE 
DEFENDING HIS CONDUCT

08:58:21.434 --> 08:58:23.931
AND YOU SAW THAT AT THE END OF 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN JAMIE 

08:58:24.146 --> 08:58:26.146
RASKIN SAID  HAD

08:58:29.286 --> 08:58:31.564
PEOPLE LIKE PORTMAN AND OTHERS 
AND YOU HAVE A SUPER MAJORITY OF

08:58:31.761 --> 08:58:33.761
THE CONGRESS WHO SAY WHAT TRUMP 
DID WAS

08:58:38.973 --> 08:58:40.230
DERELICT IN HIS DUTY AS 
PRESIDENT. 

08:58:40.231 --> 08:58:42.884
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WILL GO TO RHONDA COLVIN  
. THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER  JAMIE

08:58:43.638 --> 08:58:47.309
RASKIN  DEFENDED THE DECISION 
WHEN IT SAYS

08:58:52.327 --> 08:58:54.780
. LET'S TALK THROUGH HOW THAT 
PLAYED OUT TODAY AND WHAT HE HAD

08:58:54.993 --> 08:58:56.900
TO SAY IF THAT WOULD'VE MADE A 
DIFFERENCE.  

08:58:56.901 --> 08:58:58.901
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: 

08:59:04.172 --> 08:59:06.172
IS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TODAY 
WHEN THERE WAS THE UNANTICIPATED

08:59:06.270 --> 08:59:08.270
TWIST WHERE THE SENATE DECIDED 
THAT THEY WOULD ENTERTAIN THE 

08:59:08.313 --> 08:59:10.414
IDEA OF BRINGING IN WITNESSES 
BASED ON MR. RASKIN SAYING HE 

08:59:10.617 --> 08:59:13.725
WANTED TO CALL A REPRESENTATIVE 
CONGRESSWOMAN JAIME HERRERA 

08:59:13.938 --> 08:59:17.650
BEUTLER WHO HAD INFORMATION 
ABOUT A CALL  FOR KEVIN McCARTY 

08:59:17.865 --> 08:59:23.657
WAS TALKING WITH TRUMP AND I WAS
AT THE HEART OF A LOT OF THE 

08:59:23.851 --> 08:59:26.164
MODERATE REPUBLICAN CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6. 

08:59:26.314 --> 08:59:28.380
THEY WERE WORRIED AND CONCERNED 
THE DEFENSE TEAM DID NOT REALLY 

08:59:29.020 --> 08:59:34.808
TELL THEM WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS
DOING WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THAT 

08:59:35.010 --> 08:59:40.987
MIKE PENCE WAS IN DANGER. THAT 
IS TO KICKOFF THE DAY. IT ENDED 

08:59:41.143 --> 08:59:43.143
UP

08:59:52.937 --> 08:59:54.937
WHERE THE TWO SIDES WITH THE 
IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND THE 

08:59:54.987 --> 08:59:56.845
DEFENSE TEAM AGREED THAT THE 
STATEMENT BY THAT REPRESENTATIVE

08:59:56.846 --> 08:59:59.195
COULD BE ENTERED AS EVIDENCE, 
BUT SHE WOULD NOT BE BROUGHT IN 

08:59:59.405 --> 09:00:01.405
TO SPEAK OR DO A ZOOM CALL.

09:00:09.765 --> 09:00:12.284
WHAT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT 
WE JUST SAW, IT WAS A CHANCE FOR

09:00:12.496 --> 09:00:14.349
THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS EVEN 
THOUGH THEY WERE NOT VICTORIOUS 

09:00:14.350 --> 09:00:16.350
AND GETTING THE SUPER MAJORITY, 
THEY KEPT POINTING OUT HOW 

09:00:16.415 --> 09:00:20.146
BIPARTISAN THIS WAS AND THEY 
FELT THEY HAD ENOUGH BY OFFERING

09:00:20.350 --> 09:00:22.006
THE EVIDENCE FROM CONGRESSWOMAN 
HERRERA BEUTLER TO UNDERSCORE 

09:00:22.007 --> 09:00:24.724
THE ARGUMENT IN THE TRIAL , 
WHICH IS TRUMP WAS NOT CONCERNED

09:00:24.927 --> 09:00:30.313
ABOUT HELPING ANYBODY  AND HE 
COMMITTED A DERELICTION OF DUTY.

09:00:30.517 --> 09:00:35.710
THEY SAID THEY BELIEVED THE 
SENATE LET HIM OFF ON A 

09:00:35.913 --> 09:00:38.392
TECHNICALITY THAT THEY WERE MORE
CONCERNED IT WAS A 

09:00:38.797 --> 09:00:41.915
CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE AND NOT 
NECESSARILY THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS

09:00:42.118 --> 09:00:46.134
RIGHT OR WRONG. IT APPEARS THEY 
FEEL GOOD

09:00:51.357 --> 09:00:53.653
ABOUT THEIR KIDS AND WHAT THEY 
DID HERE TODAY. THERE WAS A 

09:00:53.867 --> 09:00:56.150
QUESTION FROM A REPORTER POINTED
OUT WHEN YOU HAVE THE RAND PAUL 

09:00:56.353 --> 09:00:58.353
RESOLUTION A FEW WEEKS AGO

09:01:06.587 --> 09:01:08.670
HE DID A TEST VOTE ON THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY, YOU ONLY HAVE

09:01:08.877 --> 09:01:10.742
FIVE REPUBLICANS GO WITH 
DEMOCRATS TO SAY THE IMPEACHMENT

09:01:10.743 --> 09:01:14.942
TRIAL TO GO FORWARD. THIS 
TUESDAY SIX REPUBLICANS WENT 

09:01:15.142 --> 09:01:16.634
WITH DEMOCRATS ON 
CONSTITUTIONALITY AND TODAY YOU 

09:01:16.635 --> 09:01:20.348
HAVE SEVEN REPUBLICANS JOINING 
DEMOCRATS IN THE CALL TO CONVICT

09:01:20.549 --> 09:01:22.549
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE 
QUESTION WAS

09:01:25.915 --> 09:01:27.915
IF THE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS 
WOULD HAVE WAITED OR HAVE ADDED 

09:01:28.553 --> 09:01:32.580
MORE WITNESSES, COULD THAT MAYBE
HAVE GOTTEN THEM TO THE SUPER 

09:01:32.794 --> 09:01:37.363
MAJORITY TEXT THEY WERE ONLY SHY
10 VOTES. THE IMPEACHMENT 

09:01:37.565 --> 09:01:39.565
MANAGERS WERE SAYING THIS IS NOT
THE POINT

09:01:45.860 --> 09:01:48.324
. WE BROUGHT OUR CASE AND IT DID
APPEAL TO A NUMBER OF 

09:01:48.533 --> 09:01:50.383
REPUBLICANS AND I WOULD HAVE THE
MOST BIPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT 

09:01:50.384 --> 09:01:52.384
TRIAL EVER IN AMERICAN HISTORY

09:02:01.954 --> 09:02:03.799
.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JAMES HOHMANN, WE WILL GO TO 

09:02:03.800 --> 09:02:05.882
YOU FOR MORE ON THAT. JAMIE 
RASKIN DEFENDED THE DECISION TO 

09:02:06.083 --> 09:02:08.083
MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT WITNESSES, 
BUT THE QUESTION GETS AT THE 

09:02:08.206 --> 09:02:10.477
HEART AT WHAT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS
AND SUPPORTERS  OF THE 

09:02:10.689 --> 09:02:12.689
DEMOCRATIC WING OF AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT ARE ASKING RIGHT NOW 

09:02:12.750 --> 09:02:17.306
PICTURE THEY HAVE PUSHED TO GET 
WITNESSES AND WHY NOT? WHY NOT 

09:02:17.508 --> 09:02:21.035
JUST SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND 
CALL THE WITNESSES? 

09:02:21.036 --> 09:02:23.309
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
DEBATED IN PRIMARIES THE JAMIE 

09:02:24.085 --> 09:02:26.738
RASKIN  POINTED OUT IN RESPONSE 
TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION

09:02:35.595 --> 09:02:37.595
RHONDA HIGHLIGHTED THEY COULD'VE
CALLED 100 WITNESSES AND MITCH 

09:02:37.704 --> 09:02:39.567
McCONNELL WOULD HAVE DELIVERED 
THAT EXACT SAME SPEECH ON THE 

09:02:39.568 --> 09:02:42.489
SENATE FLOOR . YOU DID HERE 
SPEAKER PELOSI SAY THERE STILL 

09:02:42.693 --> 09:02:44.693
NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION TO 
LEARN MORE

09:02:53.000 --> 09:02:55.053
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE 
FAILURES OF SECURITY PLANNING 

09:02:55.267 --> 09:02:57.307
THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO 
SEE MORE EVIDENCE EMERGE DURING 

09:02:57.507 --> 09:02:59.567
SOME OF THESE TRIALS. MORE THAN 
200 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED. 

09:02:59.781 --> 09:03:01.781
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE

09:03:10.980 --> 09:03:12.980
CAPITOL IS STILL NOT BEEN 
CHARGED AND IT APPEARS PRESIDENT

09:03:13.047 --> 09:03:15.047
BIDEN IS GOING TO KEEP AROUND 
THE TRUMP APPOINTED U.S. 

09:03:15.157 --> 09:03:17.213
ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA BECAUSE HE THINKS HE IS

09:03:17.413 --> 09:03:19.698
DOING A GOOD JOB  AND YOU COULD 
SEE MORE SERIOUS CHARGES 

09:03:19.900 --> 09:03:21.900
BROUGHT. THERE COULD BE

09:03:25.912 --> 09:03:27.595
DISCOVERY IN THOSE CRIMINAL 
CASES THAT IMPLICATES EITHER 

09:03:27.596 --> 09:03:29.973
TRUMP OR HIS CLOSE ALLIES. EVEN 
IF THAT HAPPENED, CERTAINLY

09:03:35.463 --> 09:03:37.541
THERE WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
NOT GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF 

09:03:37.742 --> 09:03:39.742
EVERYTHING GOING ON JANUARY 6. 
STACEY PLASKETT MADE A GOOD 

09:03:39.829 --> 09:03:41.829
POINT WHEN SHE WALKED TO THE 
MICROPHONE AND SAID REPUBLICANS 

09:03:41.899 --> 09:03:46.908
AND TRUMP ARE STILL LITIGATING 
DON McGAHN'S TESTIMONY FROM THE 

09:03:47.124 --> 09:03:49.124
FIRST IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING

09:03:55.175 --> 09:03:57.641
MORE THAN A YEAR LATER THE HOUSE
POINTED TO THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT

09:03:57.855 --> 09:04:00.016
THAT IS STILL CAUGHT UP IN THE 
WASHINGTON, D.C.

09:04:08.195 --> 09:04:10.195
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THE 
IDEA THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 

09:04:10.292 --> 09:04:12.292
BROUGHT TO FRUITION THE 
WITNESSES YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM 

09:04:12.347 --> 09:04:14.416
THE MOST OR ALL WHO WOULD CLAIM 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN THE 

09:04:14.632 --> 09:04:19.212
CONSERVATIVE HAD A MAJORITY ON 
THE SUPREME COURT'S HE COULD 

09:04:19.427 --> 09:04:21.789
DRAG THIS OUT FOR THE FULL FIRST
YEAR OF THE

09:04:34.328 --> 09:04:36.629
JOE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. IS NOT 
JUST THEY WANTED TO GET HOME TO 

09:04:36.834 --> 09:04:38.930
THEIR SPOUSES FOR VALENTINE'S 
DAY. ONCE YOU OPEN UP THE BOX, 

09:04:39.132 --> 09:04:41.625
IT COULD GO ON AND ON AND THEN 
YOU SAW THE CONGRESSMAN FROM 

09:04:42.398 --> 09:04:47.612
RHODE ISLAND, DAVID CICILLINE, 
WHO SAID WE GOT INTO THE RECORD 

09:04:47.826 --> 09:04:49.826
WHAT WE WANTED TO GIVE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS 

09:04:49.916 --> 09:04:52.221
MOVEMENT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
HAS ONLY JUST  BEGUN. STAY TUNED

09:04:52.422 --> 09:04:53.645
FOR MORE FROM THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT. 

09:04:53.646 --> 09:04:58.666
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHE IS NOT GOING AWAY. IS 
BEEN MAKING PLANS TO COME BACK. 

09:04:58.880 --> 09:05:00.880
I THINK WE WILL SEE HIM MORE 
SOON

09:05:06.109 --> 09:05:08.835
. YOU COULD SEE THEM HOLD A 
RALLY IN THE NEXT WEEK. IT WILL 

09:05:09.035 --> 09:05:11.295
BE FASCINATING TO SEE IF THIS 
EMBOLDENS HIM  AND HE WAS 

09:05:11.499 --> 09:05:13.499
EMBOLDENED BY NOT GETTING 
CONVICTED IN THE FIRST

09:05:18.360 --> 09:05:20.003
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RHONDA COLVIN, WHAT ARE YOUR 

09:05:20.004 --> 09:05:22.439
FINAL THOUGHTS HERE AS WE SAY 
GOODBYE TO THE SENATE  AND WATCH

09:05:22.642 --> 09:05:24.642
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

09:05:28.642 --> 09:05:30.538
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Reporter: I THINK THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE ENCOURAGED THEY 

09:05:30.539 --> 09:05:32.539
DID HAVE SEVEN REPUBLICANS JOIN 
THEM 

09:05:37.984 --> 09:05:40.093
IN THE IDEA DONALD TRUMP SHOULD 
BE CONVICTED THAT THEY'RE GOING 

09:05:40.299 --> 09:05:42.811
AWAY NOT LIKE LAST TIME WERE 
SOME OF THEM WERE DISPIRITED AND

09:05:43.028 --> 09:05:44.910
DISCOURAGED BY THE LUST 
IMPEACHMENT. THIS TIME THEY SEE 

09:05:44.911 --> 09:05:47.909
SENATE REPUBLICANS TO JOIN THEM.
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING FOR NEXT

09:05:57.365 --> 09:05:59.068
IS HOW THIS AFFECTS SENATE 
REPUBLICANS AND HOUSE 

09:05:59.069 --> 09:06:02.331
REPUBLICANS. WHERE DO THEY GO 
FROM HERE? NOW THAT THE FORMER 

09:06:02.546 --> 09:06:06.065
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR JANUARY 6, THEY 

09:06:06.280 --> 09:06:12.663
HAVE TO ADDRESS HIM IN THE PARTY
. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN BETWEEN 

09:06:12.865 --> 09:06:14.865
NOW AND THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE?

09:06:20.927 --> 09:06:23.462
AS YOU JUST MENTIONED, HE MIGHT 
TAKE THIS AS A TIME TO FEEL 

09:06:23.663 --> 09:06:28.394
EMBOLDENED THAT HAS BEEN A 
CONCERN. WE ARE ALL GOING TO 

09:06:28.595 --> 09:06:31.480
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THIS 
PLAYS OUT.  

09:06:31.481 --> 09:06:35.605
