Two and a half years in the making….
The longest script ever written...

And starring Theresa May, as you’ve never
seen her before, in….

……….. The Brexit Games

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:33.140
The highs, the lows, the erm dancing and the
incredible story of Theresa’s journey so

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
far.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.970
She’s just got her deal past her Cabinet,
but heads are rolling….…

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.050
And she’s running out of time…

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.809
With this deal the world could see the biggest
breakup in history, and the fates of thousands...

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.030

of tie-clad, multilingual challengers...

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.640

least this time it won’t be in a giant room

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.650
full of toast.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.900
Then she’ll have to win the battle of a
lifetime in parliament as MPs go to vote….

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.090
Or face one of these…

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.740

the same again.
