00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.632
The fight goes on and the opposition now believes
that people who are standing in the streets,

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:17.070
on the front line of the fight, will not just
be ready to go just because the government

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
is reshuffled.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.359
And we have to continue the fight . My mother
yesterday made an appeal to opposition leaders,

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.920
to the people here and said we need to fight
whichever way we can and of course avoid violence

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
as much as we can.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.290
But we have to fight for our rights, our freedom
and make politicians change the system.
